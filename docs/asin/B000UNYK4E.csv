1095577,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000UNYK4E,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 4]","Ever since Morgan Freeman did the booming voice of The Evening Star in a short skit on `The Electric Company,' it has been clear to me that he could easily play God.  Also, given the impressive comedic resume of Steve Carrell, it is a no-brainer that he would be Jim Carrey's replacement in the sequel, `Evan Almighty'.  While Carrell is certainly versatile, his performance makes me suspicious of two possible developments:  Something went wrong with Carrey's contract or the makers went out of their way to show us that another ""everyman"" is interchangeable as God`s representative.""  So it makes sense to move on to another pilgrim coming to grips with God.  Watching this film gave me the distinct feeling I was watching Cecil B. DeMille's comedic rendition of a modern parable with digital enhancement.  Much of the movie reminded me of `Liar, Liar,' even if the plot was distinctively different.This time the pilgrim is former anchorman, Evan Baxter (Carrell), newly elected to become a U.S. Congressman.  He's been chosen to be the modern day Noah without much space to refuse.  Freeman's portrayal of God is every bit as intimate and informal as George Burns, and somewhat similar in wit and delivery.  Sprinkling incessant clues of ""GEN""esis 6:14, animals keep appearing (in pairs of course) and cling to him like a bad haircut, God won`t leave him alone until Evan builds an ark (with a modern anagram to match--A.cts of R.andom K.indness.)  In his political entourage are his tart-talking assistant, Rita Daniels; his practical chief assistant, Marty Stranger; and a worshipping know-it-all prot&eacute;g&eacute;.At home Evan, who has all the on-board commitment of Jonah, chides God like a real prophet, ""Do me a favor--love me less.""  And his wife sounds more like the wife of Job than the wife of Noah when she skeptically chides him with her reproach:  ""Does God know He's destroying our lives?""  The newly elected politician has that all-too-familiar conflict between juggling his time with his work and spending time with his family.  In the meantime, his main vainglory arises from whether or not he'll support a bill by a senior Congressman (played with overbearing officiousness by John Goodman).`Evan Almighty' was almost a flop at the box office considering the operating budget, and hardly garnered much more from the critics.  Perhaps because of the poor grades, I expected less and got more.  I thought while some of the laughs weren't of the highest caliber, the pace of the movie exercised good judgment.  With some fast-paced delivery from Carrell and company, the developments were enough to inspire smiles from this side of the aisle.  Just when I thought they'd paint themselves into a corner, they rose to the occasion with admirable warmth and wit.",3,"""Be Careful What You Ask For""",1192060800,"10 11, 2007",2007,2781,"['Ever', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'did', 'booming', 'voice', 'Evening', 'Star', 'short', 'skit', 'Electric', 'Company', 'been', 'clear', 'could', 'easily', 'play', 'God', 'Also', 'given', 'impressive', 'comedic', 'resume', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'no-brainer', 'would', 'be', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'replacement', 'sequel', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'Carrell', 'certainly', 'versatile', 'performance', 'suspicious', 'two', 'possible', 'developments', 'Something', 'went', 'wrong', 'Carrey', 'contract', 'makers', 'went', 'way', 'show', 'everyman', 'interchangeable', 'God', 's', 'representative', 'sense', 'move', 'pilgrim', 'coming', 'grips', 'God', 'Watching', 'film', 'gave', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'comedic', 'rendition', 'modern', 'parable', 'digital', 'enhancement', 'Much', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'even', 'plot', 'was', 'distinctively', 'different.This', 'time', 'pilgrim', 'former', 'anchorman', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'Carrell', 'newly', 'elected', 'become', 'U.S', 'Congressman', 'been', 'chosen', 'be', 'modern', 'day', 'Noah', 'much', 'space', 'refuse', 'Freeman', 'portrayal', 'God', 'bit', 'intimate', 'informal', 'George', 'Burns', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'wit', 'delivery', 'Sprinkling', 'incessant', 'clues', 'GEN', 'esis', '6:14', 'animals', 'keep', 'appearing', 'pairs', 'course', 'cling', 'bad', 'haircut', 'God', 'won', 't', 'leave', 'alone', 'Evan', 'ark', 'modern', 'anagram', 'match', 'A.cts', 'R.andom', 'K.indness', 'political', 'entourage', 'are', 'tart-talking', 'assistant', 'Rita', 'Daniels', 'practical', 'chief', 'assistant', 'Marty', 'Stranger', 'worshipping', 'know-it-all', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'home', 'Evan', 'who', 'on-board', 'commitment', 'Jonah', 'God', 'real', 'prophet', 'Do', 'favor', 'love', 'less', 'wife', 'more', 'wife', 'Job', 'wife', 'Noah', 'when', 'skeptically', 'reproach', 'Does', 'God', 'know', 'destroying', 'lives', 'newly', 'elected', 'politician', 'all-too-familiar', 'conflict', 'juggling', 'time', 'work', 'spending', 'time', 'family', 'meantime', 'main', 'vainglory', 'arises', 'not', ""'ll"", 'support', 'bill', 'senior', 'Congressman', 'played', 'overbearing', 'officiousness', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'was', 'almost', 'flop', 'box', 'office', 'considering', 'operating', 'budget', 'hardly', 'garnered', 'much', 'more', 'critics', 'Perhaps', 'poor', 'grades', 'expected', 'less', 'got', 'more', 'thought', 'laughs', 'were', ""n't"", 'highest', 'caliber', 'pace', 'movie', 'exercised', 'good', 'judgment', 'fast-paced', 'delivery', 'Carrell', 'company', 'developments', 'were', 'enough', 'inspire', 'smiles', 'side', 'aisle', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', ""'d"", 'paint', 'corner', 'rose', 'occasion', 'admirable', 'warmth', 'wit']",N/A

1095579,AY7EXIYJ2LG5S,B000UNYK4E,ADSHippin,"[1, 2]","Steve Carell did a stellar job as the new Noah, and of course Morgan Freeman is an actor with few rivals. We even got to see an un-credited lovely Catherine Bell reprise her roll from Bruce Almighty in the first couple of minutes of the film.  I loved the animal chorography, the stunts as well the special effects, all of which are very well done.  The dialogue though a little long at times wasn't offensive and for a family oriented light PG rated movie it too wasn't bad.  Kids will especially like the animal sequences and there was even a kid's game on the DVD that I purchased.  I can see a number of families loading this movie on to their mini van's DVD player for long trips.Having said what I liked.  I did have some big problems with the movie perhaps because I live in the Washington DC Metro/Northern Virginia suburbs. As a consequence I know the area very well.  Because of this I found myself thinking of all the millions of people who would be killed if a flood where to come down the Potomac River. This is to say nothing of the trillions of dollars in damages that would be done. Landmarks such as the Capitol itself,the Lincoln, and the Jefferson both of which are on the river or within a couple of blocks of it would be destroyed.  To be honest the flood and thinking of the problems makes me think of disaster movies rather than comedies.Then there is the issue of why would God want Evan to become like our child hood visions of Noah?  Why would god want to humiliate Evan with the clothes, hair and beard?  Why wouldn't god simply cajole Evan into fighting the evil land use bill that the John Goodman's Character is pushing (the central point of the movie)?On the lighter side I want to know what short cut Evan uses to get around Washington DC and avoid the traffic.  Which is considered by many (including myself) to be some of the worst in the US.It could be argued that I have taken this movie just a little too seriously.

Jim Carrey was perfect as Bruce, the person who God chose to take over, basically to teach him a lesson. I never got around to reviewing it but had I done so I would have rated it at 4 stars.So what made ""Evan Almighty"" Better? The biggest difference here is that the film was more central plot driven. With Bruce you got a series of scenarios based aroung the main theme. Here you have a strong central plot with a couple of sub-plots that all merge at the end. Evan, Played outstandingly by Steve Carell (The 40-Year-Old Virgin (Rated Widescreen Edition)) is a newly elected congressman who when running for office promised to ""CHANGE THE WORLD."" On the night before his first day in office he kneels down to pray for the first time in what must have been many years, asking God to help him. God's answer, of course, is to appear the next day and ask him to build an Ark, as in Noah and the flood. Evan of course fights this concept until he basically has no choice but to believe and begins to build. This of couse freaks out his family not to mention his Congressional staff and fellow congressmen. To go further into the plot would spoil many of the great surprises.Along the way we are treated to hysterical sight gags, some slapstick, and some very emotional scenes as the supporting characters all come to terms with what Evan is doing. The cast is outstanding. Morgan Freeman is great in his reprisal of God. Lauren GrahamGilmore Girls - The Complete First Five Seasonsis perfect as Evan's wife. Other co-stars include John Goodman as the evil Congressman and John Michael Higgins, Wanda Styles, and Jonah Hill as the congressional staff.Please do not hesitate to go see this. I know some of the critics are panning it but believe me it's one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years, which is a strong statement since I'm such a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" fanatic.

Here was a movie that has a countdown to doom and a Noah-like conscript God tells to build an ark. The Big Man even trucks in the supplies and tools to get the job done. What follows is a modern-day comedy of a man who in his heart wants to ""Change the world."" Even in his desire to stand out from others, Evan Baxter didn't exactly intend to have it happen quite this way. He unwillingly takes on the Noah look in front of the international media as a laughing stock.Who in these days would like to admit that God told him to build an ark to avert the promised flood? It all adds to a comic retelling of the biblical account with fun twists and a climactic ending. Steve Carell plays the comic role well. Super effects and animal depictions are all well-placed. Admonitions come without heavy-handed preachments, but rather in tasteful, quiet moments that reflect positive principles weighed against man's agency to chose the right course of action.

1095589,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000UNYK4E,Bill Garrison,"[7, 10]","Evan Almighty is a big summer comedy with a big budget and so it must be judge by summer blockbuster standards. It obviously didn't make as much money as its producers hoped, and the movie does have a lot of shortcomings, BUT I thought it was a delightful comedy that is just perfect for familes looking for wholesome entertainment. Evan Almighty is a sequel to Bruce Almighty. In Bruce Almighty, Jim Carrey was the star. He made the movie great. He was given the powers of God and hilarity ensued. Evan, played by Steve Carrell, had a small but funny part in that movie. Carrell, now a major star in his own right, headlines this movie. In Evan Almighty, Evan doesn't get to play God. Instead, he gets to play Moses.God, Morgan Freeman returning as the amiable God as a man, appears to Evan and tells him to build an Ark because a flood is coming. This is a problem because Evan has just been elected to Congress. As a freshman Congress, Evan has a lot of pressure to uphold his campaign promise to ""change the world."" Of course, God has other ideas. You've probably seen it in the commercials. No matter what Evan does, animals keep following him and his beard keeps growing. Eventually Evan gives in and builds the arc.Aware of the history behind the movie, I really enjoyed it. While not as good as its predecessor, this movie still has a strong Christian theme and should be enjoyed by all but the most cynical. The cast is for the most part decent. Wanda Sykes is hilarious as Carrell's assistant. Jonah HIll plays a congressional aide without using any swear words. John Goodman plays the evil congressman in the movie (don't expect a civics lesson, this movie plays fast and loose with how the Congress works). Lauren Graham plays the beautiful, suffering wife.The whole family should enjoy this movie. It doesn't have the wide-ranging appeal of the original, but is still a lot of fun.",3,"Not great, but still a good family movie",1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,1894,"['Evan', 'Almighty', 'big', 'summer', 'comedy', 'big', 'budget', 'must', 'be', 'judge', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'standards', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'producers', 'hoped', 'movie', 'have', 'lot', 'shortcomings', 'BUT', 'thought', 'was', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'just', 'perfect', 'familes', 'looking', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'sequel', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'star', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'was', 'given', 'powers', 'God', 'hilarity', 'ensued', 'Evan', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'had', 'small', 'funny', 'part', 'movie', 'Carrell', 'now', 'major', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'movie', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'Evan', ""n't"", 'get', 'play', 'God', 'Instead', 'play', 'Moses.God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'returning', 'amiable', 'God', 'man', 'Evan', 'build', 'Ark', 'flood', 'coming', 'problem', 'Evan', 'just', 'been', 'elected', 'Congress', 'freshman', 'Congress', 'Evan', 'lot', 'pressure', 'uphold', 'campaign', 'promise', 'change', 'world', 'course', 'God', 'other', 'ideas', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'commercials', 'matter', 'what', 'Evan', 'animals', 'keep', 'following', 'beard', 'growing', 'Eventually', 'Evan', 'builds', 'arc.Aware', 'history', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'predecessor', 'movie', 'still', 'strong', 'Christian', 'theme', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'cynical', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'decent', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'hilarious', 'Carrell', 'assistant', 'Jonah', 'HIll', 'congressional', 'aide', 'using', 'swear', 'words', 'John', 'Goodman', 'evil', 'congressman', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'civics', 'lesson', 'movie', 'fast', 'loose', 'how', 'Congress', 'works', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'beautiful', 'suffering', 'wife.The', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'wide-ranging', 'appeal', 'original', 'still', 'lot', 'fun']",N/A

How far you've fallen!After a glowing moment inLittle Miss Sunshine, Steve Carell's choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since. AlthoughThe 40-Year-Old Virginwas entertaining, it was dwarfed by his ""Sunshine"" character. Hoping to find something that'd get me to spew popcorn from my nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible guffaws might await me here. Not much...Given the trite and clich&eacute;d script, the entire film felt forced and unemotional. Poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current U.S. administration's take on the environment, Evan Almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserably.Nearly every person on Earth knows the story of Noah and The Ark. God's wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while Noah, his family, and two of each of His creatures on Earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark. It was a huge moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text).So why would God appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the world's animals for a few minutes after a dam break? The simple answer is that He never would. Too much emphasis was given to U.S. government policy and not enough on world events, making Evan Almighty a terribly myopic and Ameri-centric film. Although designed as a comedy, it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs. Maybe a few grunts and a smile, but little else.John Goodman (Cars) pulls in another forced performance as the despicable Congressman Chuck Long who's only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 Items or Less) as God can't help mop up this soaking wet disaster-of-a-film.The only funny moments are between Carell and the animals, especially as Evan learns what animal magnetism is REALLY like. Birds literally flock to him. Sheep herd around him. Lions take pride in being near him (please forgive the puns).The special effects were fun to watch but were brief (with good reason). The ""flood"" was interesting in that the Ark was obviously guided by His hand and shoved in just the right direction.But other than that you're in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.",2,"""A Story Of Biblical Disproportions""",1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,2388,"['Oh', 'Mr.', 'Carell', 'How', 'far', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'glowing', 'moment', 'inLittle', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'choice', 'films', 'beginning', 'contrast', 'starkly', 'what', 'come', 'AlthoughThe', '40-Year-Old', 'Virginwas', 'entertaining', 'was', 'dwarfed', 'Sunshine', 'character', 'Hoping', 'find', 'something', ""'d"", 'get', 'spew', 'popcorn', 'nose', 'decided', 'rent', 'EVAN', 'ALMIGHTY', 'see', 'what', 'possible', 'guffaws', 'might', 'await', 'here', 'Not', 'much', 'Given', 'trite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'script', 'entire', 'film', 'felt', 'forced', 'unemotional', 'Poking', 'bit', 'fun', 'flagging', 'family', 'values', 'current', 'U.S.', 'administration', 'take', 'environment', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'also', 'put', 'profound', 'biblical', 'moment', 'humorous', 'terms', 'miserably.Nearly', 'person', 'Earth', 'story', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'God', 'wrath', 'was', 'sent', 'down', '30', 'days', 'nights', 'rain', 'flooded', 'entire', 'planet', 'Noah', 'family', 'two', 'creatures', 'Earth', 'rode', 'out', 'wetness', 'relative', 'comfort', 'gopher', 'wood', 'ark', 'was', 'huge', 'moment', 'human', 'history', 'believe', 'biblical', 'text', '.So', 'why', 'would', 'God', 'appear', 'one', 'man', 'ask', 'build', 'ark', 'would', 'only', 'carry', 'world', 'animals', 'few', 'minutes', 'dam', 'break', 'simple', 'answer', 'never', 'would', 'Too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'was', 'given', 'U.S.', 'government', 'policy', 'not', 'enough', 'world', 'events', 'making', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'terribly', 'myopic', 'Ameri-centric', 'film', 'designed', 'comedy', 'really', 'never', 'anything', 'approaching', 'belly', 'Maybe', 'few', 'grunts', 'smile', 'little', 'else.John', 'Goodman', 'Cars', 'forced', 'performance', 'despicable', 'Congressman', 'Chuck', 'Long', 'who', 'only', 'goals', 'are', 'create', 'development', 'opportunities', 'protected', 'national', 'land', 'holdings', 'Even', 'strong', 'presence', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', '10', 'Items', 'Less', 'God', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'mop', 'up', 'soaking', 'wet', 'disaster-of-a-film.The', 'only', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'Carell', 'animals', 'especially', 'Evan', 'what', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'REALLY', 'Birds', 'literally', 'flock', 'Sheep', 'herd', 'Lions', 'take', 'pride', 'being', 'please', 'forgive', 'puns', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'were', 'brief', 'good', 'reason', 'flood', 'was', 'interesting', 'Ark', 'was', 'obviously', 'guided', 'hand', 'shoved', 'just', 'right', 'direction.But', 'other', ""'re"", 'little', 'more', 'insult', 'common', 'sense', 'intellect']",N/A

1095594,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000UNYK4E,Caleb Williams,"[1, 6]","Tom Shadyac, the director of this movie has brought us some excellent comedy movies in the past both as producer and director. Ace Ventura Pet Detective, Nutty Professor 1 & 2, Liar Liar plus others are all great movies, even the prequel to this Bruce Almighty was a mildly amusing and heart breaking movie. Evan Almighty was on the other end of the comedy spectrum when compared to his other triumphs. Steve Carell of The Office fame has fast become one of the most recognisable names in comic acting yet this is a black mark on his career also. This movie being the most expensive comedy film in history had a lot behind it in terms of money and publicity, the only thing it didn't have behind it was good comedy.The story revolves around Evan Baxter who we may remember from Bruce Almighty, he's quit local TV news and was elected to congress. He's now upped stakes and moved him and his family to suburban north Virginia, and his congressional campaign I here you ask? He plans to change the world, I just don't think he imagined it in the way it would actually turn out. After a series of strange events from being followed by animals to growing a beard that just wont be shaved, he becomes convinced that he's going insane, along with the people around him. One day he's approach by a black man in a white suit who calls himself God, he tells Evan he must build an Ark and carry two of every animal as there's soon going to be a flood to wipe away all the evil in the world.I have to be honest, I can see another one of these movies being made to tell of another biblical tale and then us simply being even more disappointed with the results. I also can't help but think there's a bit of a religious propaganda undertone in there somewhere. Well, Christianity could do with a few more members of the church and if this is the way to bring them in, then so be it. I have to admit there were a few parts of this movie that I enjoyed, especially when Evan was going through the ""Noah"" transformation but I think at $200 Million being spent on this movie, I think many would agree that the money could have been spent more wisely elsewhere.Get it if you like Carell, but expect to be disappointed.",1,Just Not Funny,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,2199,"['Tom', 'Shadyac', 'director', 'movie', 'brought', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'movies', 'past', 'producer', 'director', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Pet', 'Detective', 'Nutty', 'Professor', '1', '2', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'others', 'are', 'great', 'movies', 'even', 'prequel', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'was', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'heart', 'breaking', 'movie', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'was', 'other', 'end', 'comedy', 'spectrum', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'triumphs', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Office', 'fame', 'fast', 'one', 'most', 'recognisable', 'names', 'comic', 'acting', 'yet', 'black', 'mark', 'career', 'also', 'movie', 'being', 'most', 'expensive', 'comedy', 'film', 'history', 'had', 'lot', 'terms', 'money', 'publicity', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'was', 'good', 'comedy.The', 'story', 'around', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'who', 'may', 'remember', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'quit', 'local', 'TV', 'news', 'was', 'elected', 'congress', 'now', 'upped', 'stakes', 'moved', 'family', 'suburban', 'north', 'Virginia', 'congressional', 'campaign', 'here', 'ask', 'change', 'world', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'imagined', 'way', 'would', 'actually', 'turn', 'out', 'series', 'strange', 'events', 'being', 'followed', 'animals', 'growing', 'beard', 'just', 'wont', 'be', 'shaved', 'convinced', 'going', 'insane', 'people', 'One', 'day', 'approach', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'suit', 'who', 'God', 'must', 'build', 'Ark', 'carry', 'two', 'animal', 'soon', 'going', 'be', 'flood', 'wipe', 'away', 'evil', 'world.I', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'movies', 'being', 'made', 'tell', 'biblical', 'tale', 'then', 'simply', 'being', 'even', 'more', 'disappointed', 'results', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'bit', 'religious', 'propaganda', 'undertone', 'somewhere', 'Well', 'Christianity', 'could', 'do', 'few', 'more', 'members', 'church', 'way', 'bring', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'have', 'admit', 'were', 'few', 'parts', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'when', 'Evan', 'was', 'going', 'Noah', 'transformation', 'think', '200', 'Million', 'being', 'spent', 'movie', 'think', 'many', 'would', 'agree', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'more', 'wisely', 'elsewhere.Get', 'like', 'Carell', 'expect', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Who knew a movie could take the delicate and often touchy subjects God and religion, and find the humor in it? Unfortunately, Evan Almighty doesn't accomplish nearly as much as it's far better predecessor.Evan Almighty picks up the story of Evan Baxter (yes, the same news anchor who was a bane to the existence Bruce in the first film) as he and his family move to a new town after Evan becomes a newly elected Congressman. Evan is the perfect picture of consumerism, vanity, and a man desperate for the attention and approval of his peers (while mostly disregarding the opinions of his family). Unfortunately for Evan, God has other plans for him. After instructing Evan to build an Ark and save his family plus two of every kind of animal from the imminent flood, Evan begins to struggle with his desire to continue in his own life plan, or trust in the wisdom of God.At a PG rating, this movie is fairly appropriate for kids and families. Some of the aspects of the story will tug a little at the heartstrings, but overall it was a little tired and boring. The best thing this movie had going for it was the spot-on entertaining portrayal of God by Morgan Freeman. Steve Carrell has gained a lot of comic success with his hit showThe Office - Season Threeand his hilarious turn inThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated Widescreen Edition), but I'm sad to say that while he was great as a supporting character in the previous Almighty film, he didn't do so well as the primary character.Bottom line, while God's warmth and sense of humor is a veritable breath of fresh air in this movie, everything else is a bit contrived and predictable to a fault.

1095599,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B000UNYK4E,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[0, 0]","""Evan Almighty"" is a slight and fairly inoffensive sitcom of a movie that milks its preposterous premise to the fullest extant possible, with Steve Carroll as fastidious TV newsman-turned-junior-congressman Evan Baxter. Current comedy-flave Carroll can be funny just walking through a room, and Morgan Freeman is appropriately magisterial as God, who takes Congressman Baxter at his word when he asks the Almighty for guidance. In response, the Almighty drops a load of wood and a box of tools in the neighborhood of  the Baxters' overblown McMansion of a house and commands him to build an ark. And then, as Congressman Baxter does not take the duty assignments of the omniscient and omnipresent deity immediately to heart, a number of hints are dropped upon him, with all the subtly of a hammer mashing a thumb or other body part - which does happen, fairly often.  Pairs of animals - large, small and everything in between begin appearing, slithering, flying or trotting, according to their nature. For a wonder, every possible opportunity for a poop joke was not exploited to the fullest, for which this viewer was grateful.For another wonder, as obnoxious as the character of Evan Baxter can appear to be... it seems that has a genuinely happy family life. His sensible wife, played by Lauren Graham, and his three sons all love and accept him... with some reservations, though,  when he starts taking the ark-building all too seriously. But they come to welcome it as a chance for the family to work together at something; and of course, what kid wouldn't turn down a chance to fill an ark with all the animals that appear in a glorious variety, all in pairs... especially when the animals begin helping to build the ark, too.  Most of the budget seems to have gone for animals and special effects. Wanda Sykes, as Baxter's secretary has all the funniest lines. One might wish that John Goodman, as the conniving senior congressman with an agenda had a little more screen time. What success ""Evan Almighty"" had in theaters, it works best as a family movie. There are a sprinkling of clever sight gags, of which the halo of fish around Evan Baxter's head was the most amusing.Extras in this release include some very amusing deleted scenes; a couple of them could have been included - but not the long dash to rescue the dogs in the face of the coming flood -  and the expected collection flubs and actor crack-ups. There is a long feature about the various animals used in filming, and on construction ark itself, plus a game of ""match the animal pairs"". It is not one of those all-time great movie comedies of the year, but it is an agreeable enough movie for an evening... and God knows, there are much worse movies out there.",3,An Agreeable Use of an Evening,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2734,"['Evan', 'Almighty', 'slight', 'fairly', 'inoffensive', 'sitcom', 'movie', 'preposterous', 'premise', 'fullest', 'extant', 'possible', 'Steve', 'Carroll', 'fastidious', 'TV', 'newsman-turned-junior-congressman', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'Current', 'comedy-flave', 'Carroll', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'walking', 'room', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'appropriately', 'magisterial', 'God', 'who', 'Congressman', 'Baxter', 'word', 'when', 'Almighty', 'guidance', 'response', 'Almighty', 'load', 'wood', 'box', 'tools', 'neighborhood', 'Baxters', 'overblown', 'McMansion', 'house', 'build', 'ark', 'then', 'Congressman', 'Baxter', 'not', 'take', 'duty', 'assignments', 'omniscient', 'omnipresent', 'deity', 'immediately', 'heart', 'number', 'hints', 'are', 'dropped', 'subtly', 'hammer', 'mashing', 'thumb', 'other', 'body', 'part', 'happen', 'fairly', 'often', 'Pairs', 'animals', 'large', 'small', 'everything', 'begin', 'appearing', 'slithering', 'flying', 'trotting', 'according', 'nature', 'wonder', 'possible', 'opportunity', 'poop', 'joke', 'was', 'not', 'exploited', 'fullest', 'viewer', 'was', 'grateful.For', 'wonder', 'as', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'can', 'appear', 'be', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'family', 'life', 'sensible', 'wife', 'played', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'three', 'sons', 'love', 'accept', 'reservations', 'though', 'when', 'taking', 'ark-building', 'too', 'seriously', 'come', 'welcome', 'chance', 'family', 'work', 'together', 'something', 'course', 'what', 'kid', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'down', 'chance', 'fill', 'ark', 'animals', 'appear', 'glorious', 'variety', 'pairs', 'especially', 'when', 'animals', 'begin', 'helping', 'build', 'ark', 'too', 'Most', 'budget', 'have', 'gone', 'animals', 'special', 'effects', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Baxter', 'secretary', 'funniest', 'lines', 'One', 'might', 'wish', 'John', 'Goodman', 'conniving', 'senior', 'congressman', 'agenda', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'What', 'success', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'had', 'theaters', 'best', 'family', 'movie', 'are', 'sprinkling', 'clever', 'sight', 'gags', 'halo', 'fish', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'head', 'was', 'most', 'amusing.Extras', 'release', 'include', 'very', 'amusing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'couple', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'not', 'long', 'dash', 'rescue', 'dogs', 'face', 'coming', 'flood', 'expected', 'collection', 'flubs', 'actor', 'crack-ups', 'long', 'feature', 'various', 'animals', 'used', 'filming', 'construction', 'ark', 'game', 'match', 'animal', 'pairs', 'not', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'movie', 'comedies', 'year', 'agreeable', 'enough', 'movie', 'evening', 'God', 'are', 'much', 'worse', 'movies', 'there']",N/A

But it was a success and like a lot of success, it's met with a ""crank out another one"" response, even if it isn't as sharply written or better than the first one. So in this we follow Steve Carell instead of Jim Carrey, it's more expensive than any other comedies out there yet it's just not funny. Amusing if you want to kill time but still not that funny.Steve Carell plays Evan Baxter, a news anchor quitting his position to become a politician with the campaign of ""changing the world"". Moving along with his wife Joan and 3 kids, Evan is adjusting pretty well until God shows up, played by Morgan Freeman again, and tells him to build an ark. Skeptical and reluctant at first, Evan eventually sees that he has to build the ark even with his family falling apart and the townspeople who think he's crazy.I can't completely knock the film since it does have a good message (albeit done with the subtlety of a hammer) but at the end it suffers from a few problems, namely that some of the jokes aren't very amusing. Some fall incredibly flat like Evan's beard problem or Jonah Hill's weird encyclopedic-yet-creepy knowledge but luckily we have Carell who's always quite funny and even if you might've seen that kind of comedy before, he at least has the sincerity and slapstick know-how to make it work. However we have the way-too-cute Lauren Graham playing his wife who suffers the fate a lot of actresses have in where they play the role right even if the role is thinner than paper. And to be honest, I never found Wanda Sykes and her ""angry black woman"" schtick funny once but maybe that's just me.It's funny watching the special features where they talk about the special effects and how they want the audience to believe what they're saying rather than say it's an effect shot because this is some shoddy walk. In particular, the water just looks fake and when the flood does happen, the water just looks so off that the whole scene completely takes you out. But the massive set which they did construct for real is impressive although how this film managed to cost as much as Lord of the Rings when the scope of this seems smaller is beyond me. It's sad to say but the film will probably go down in history not as an incredibly funny movie with a great story but rather simply, the most expensive comedy ever made.Should you rent it? Hm, I'd like to say yes but the film left a bad taste in my mouth, kind of like a flat Pepsi.

Well, it is silly and isn't as strong as ""Bruce Almighty"" was, but it is a decent family comedy.  You can guess from the promos and the cover art that the story of Noah has something to do with the plot.Steve Carrell plays Evan Baxter, the newsman from ""Bruce Almighty"".  He has just been elected to the U.S. Congress and is looking forward to adding to his resume of success.  He moves his family into an impossibly large mansion for a freshman Congressman, but let's go with the flow here.  He also gets an even more impossibly nice office in the Capitol for a freshman Congressman.  We soon learn that he is being co-opted by Congressional leader Chuck Long (John Goodman).Just as Evan is straining to handle the pressures and complexities of his new position, God (Morgan Freeman) appears, in part because of the prayers of Evan and his family.  He commands Evan to build an Ark and Evan assumes that either he is being tricked or he has lost his mind.  You can imagine the strain this new calling puts on Evan's wife, Joan, (Lauren Graham) and three sons (you know, like Noah had).I don't want to talk about the plot, such as it is.  Again, it isn't deep or complex or profound.  However, it is nice to see a religious topic actually used without making it utterly ridiculous or an object of contempt.  For that alone, I praise it.

He did so in such a non-judgmental and gentle way, it made the loss feel all that more terrible!Another scene that left a lump in my throat was seeing all animals marching into the ark, two by two. When I saw the orangutangs, who are so incredibly intelligent and beautiful, and at the same time such an endangered species - a tear rolled down my cheek! Then another memory instantly came to mind - about the construction of a real ark. You might be saying to yourself: ""this Amazon reviewer must be off his rocker."" No, it's true! This ark has been constructed by the Norwegian government on the island of Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean! It won't be holding animals! It will literally be preserving, in a sort of suspended animation - the seeds of life! Every important food crop, and other plant life, on the face of the Earth will be preserved in a fortress-like bunker deep inside a mountain! Bravo for the Norwegian government's foresight!But I digress... This movies greatest strength is that it's gentle. Destruction of the wilderness, corruption in government, endangering innocent peoples lives, putting your family second to your career and forgetting your conscience, are all potentially heavy topics, which are handled in Evan Almighty with great finesse! My hats off to the filmmakers for a job well done!The only two other movies I can recommend that directly concern protecting the environment is the brilliant Canadian film:Spirit Bear; based on a true story.

Evan has the misfortune of retaining Bruce's director (Tom Shadyac) as well, which is unfortunate. Shadyac's claim to fame is to provide Jim Carrey with his best-known vehicle, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. However, without Carry's rubber-faced antics, his direction, and the movie as a whole, seems a bit lackluster.Enter Industrial Light and Magic with their jaw-dropping flood sequence. Oh, yikes. I'm getting ahead of myself, aren't I? Silly me.Evan Almighty begins with Evan Baxter somehow winning a congressional race with the worst campaign dialogue in history: ""Change the world."" Naturally, such a directive is going to need a little divine influence. Morgan Freeman once again portrays a version of God who has little to do than influence animals to flock toward poor Evan.Thankfully, there aren't any enlarged breast gags or dogs that pee into a toilet in this film. Instead, we have birds that drop their excrement for the sake humor. I guess such scatological humor has to be used in some form, right? How divine.Of course, there's plenty to like about Evan Almighty. The story is a fun idea. After all, how neat would it be to have five or six subdivision lots paid for and plenty of gopher wood delivered at your doorstep? It's all part of the premise. God starts off subtle (which is pretty true to life, if you ask me) with repetitive hints. The subtlety wears off after a while, and even the audience will eventually get tired of seeing GEN 6:14 everywhere.Possibly the brightest point of Evan Almighty is its affirmation of the family and its (visceral) positive message of hope even in the midst of eventual disaster. Even with all its flaws, it manages to get across a visual sermon that even politics can be redeemed.In the end, Evan Almighty is never able to rise above what is essentially a flood of mediocrity. I've seen a few Christian pastors who said they recommended this film for their churches, but for the life of me I have no idea why.

This was a fun movie, and a great choice for the whole family. Evan Baxter is the former Buffalo news anchor who has just been elected to Congress with the lofty campaign slogan ""Change the World.""This inspires God (played by Morgan Freeman) to speak to Evan about building an ark. God is angry that the beautiful Appalachian mountain vistas he has created are being destroyed by those desiring to create huge residential areas. He is upset with those who want to destroy the natural beauty of the world.Animals start following Baxter around two by two, and (like in the Tim Allen flick ""The Santa Clause"") he begins to look like his predecesor (Noah).Evan becomes alienated from his congressional colleagues and from his family, but by this point in the film, he is convinced that he is doing the work of the Lord.As the plot unfolded, I started wondering, ""Were the animals really necessary to the storyline, since the judgment of God was only falling on one region of the world rather than the entire planet?"" But my wife told me that having the animals come to Evan from around the world demonstrated to the people that Evan wasn't crazy, and that this truly was a move of God.Secondly, having the animals come to Evan ties this in neatly with the Noah story from Genesis 6.The movie is not what I would call laugh out loud funny, but there are plenty of cute and heartwarming moments. The message of the film seems to be that we can change the world with one random act of kindness at a time. Both the message and the movie are winners in my book.

It was also good to see Shadyac remain true to scripture (With God (Freeman) holding true to his promise never to flood the world again) but at the same time, he allows his audience the opportunity to expand their personal views on the concepts of prayer and making a difference in the lives of others.God (Freeman) mentioned the following:""If someone prays for patience, you think God gives them patience? Or does he give them the opportunity to be patient? If he prayed for courage, does God give him courage, or does he give him opportunities to be courageous? If someone prayed for the family to be closer, do you think God zaps them with warm fuzzy feelings, or does he give them opportunities to love each other?""Lastly, Evan's ARK does play a significant role, other than being the film's signature vessel.

You'll save yourself almost and hour and a half, and wonder what idiot movie exec let the budget for this mess rise above 75 million.First off, this is supposed to be a comedy. The result is a movie where most, if not all, of the humor comes from Steve Carell, but even he can't sugar-coat most of this poorly written dialogue. And while Jonah Hill and JMH provide a few laughs, they are tossed to make room for Wanda Sykes. Now, she was already overrated, but in this movie she give a killing performance that just screams razzie. I didn't find myself laughing at any of her crap ""jokes."" And again, they're just trying SO hard to be funny, it ends up laughable, but in a bad sort of way.Steve Carell is given the unfortunate job of carrying this movie on his shoulders, and even though he does a good job for most of the movie, the character could have been interchangeable for most of the movie. Lauren Graham makes a good mother, but again, a poorly written character. And John Goodman just sinks lower and lower with every role he plays, and this one is no exception.The story isn't that great. A bit predictable and a bit too long, even though it's a short movie. But when it anti-climaxes at the flood, it's a fun and enjoyable ride complete with great effects and some interesting symbolism. But that lasts for what, all about five minutes?As for it's family-friendliness, it's a little confused. While it does have plenty of predictable, but nice messages for the whole family and all those annoying/cute/CGI animals running around, it does stumble. Most glaring of these unfriendly errors is when Carell says if the flood isn't a ""Water-Type Flood,"" he'll be ""Pi$$ed."" That's really nice for the little ones. And then you're half expecting for somebody to get struck down when they keep saying OMG. Sure, these little gaffs won't offend most, but if the movie is marketing to a primarily Christian family audience, you have to keep the questionable stuff out.So overall, Steve Carell plays the role of Atlas in this movie, carrying the whole film on his shoulders. Unfortunately, you can only do so much with bad writing. And there's plenty in this movie. From the pathetic excuse at comedy from Wanda Sykes, a story that annoys you more than anything, and a few language gaffs that could have been avoided.

I saw this and then saw the rating (which suprised me considering Bruce Almighty) and we agreed on it. And it was very entertaining.I actually enjoyed the fact that cussing was kept to a minimum (if at all) and so was vulgarity. I loved Morgan Freeman's portrayal of God and the fact that they kept the sense of humor.Steve Carell WAS very restrained in this movie, as compared to his other roles, but I thought he did an excellent job. I've seen more than 1 review stating that it wasn't as good as 40 Y.O. Virgin, but it's a completely different kind of comedy and his character is very different.I also didn't really find it sacrilegious or making fun of religion. Some people love that type of humor. I find it tiresome. So for me that was a plus.In conclusion: yes, it can be a family film, but it can also be watched and enjoyed by two adults.

1095617,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B000UNYK4E,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[0, 0]","This Bible-believing Christian has learned the hard way over the years that the best response to most modern movie or TV attempts at ""religious programming"" is AVOIDANCE.  If they are not gratuitously insulting like Happy Feet or theologically empty at best like theOh, God! series: (Oh God / Oh God Book II / Oh God You Devil)they are downright cringeworthy like arguably the worst Bible-based film of all time and a contender for worst film of all timeNoah's Ark.  Thus having successfully avoided the first movie in this series,Bruce Almighty, I was all set to ignoreEvan Almightyas well until my friend talked me into it because nothing looking better that one of us hadn't already seen was playing that night.  Thus expecting to have both my intelligence AND my faith insulted, I was pleasantly surprised.Of course it goes without saying that this is a peculiar little movie and not just because in it God commands a modern day man to build an ark.  We're asked to believe that a network television news anchor has successfully run for Congress... as a Republican.  Though it is never specifically stated we KNOW Evan Baxter is supposed to be a Republican because:1. He's initially ""OK"" with PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT in and around our national parks.2. One of his party leaders turns out to be corrupt, and who in Hollywood has ever heard of a corrupt Democrat?3. He actually OWNS a Bible, though he has to go hunting for it.4. His supporters WAVE American flags as opposed to burning them.If you can suspend disbelief enough to get past THAT jarring concept, it turns out that you are in for a surprisingly enchanting little ride.  Increasingly intimidated by the daunting task he has let himself in for both in carrying out his hilariously vacuous campaign promise to ""Change the World"" as a freshman congressman and in keeping his fracturing family together, Evan takes his, as far as viewers can tell, not even remotely religious wife's advice and prays one of the worst prayers for assistance God can ever have heard...and God ANSWERS it.  Soon ancient tools, stacks of wood, and flocks of animals begin to show up, and in the film's longest running gag, references to Genesis 6:14 begin to pop up all over:Make thee an ark of gopher wood...God Himself appears to and tells an utterly disbelieving Evan Baxter that if he wants to ""change the world"" he should build an ark and makes it (gently) clear that He won't be accepting ""no"" for an answer.  A stubborn to the point of idiocy Evan tries desperately not to believe as his beard and hair begin to grow with lightning speed, his business suit is replaced by a robe, and animals begin to follow him everywhere, all of which he desperately tries to hide both from his family and from those in Congress.Finally with his career and marriage in shambles Evan accepts the inevitable and begins to construct the ark to the jeers of his neighbors and the nation and with the assistance of the animals, eventually his family, and the occasional miracle from God when he has the sense to ask for it.  Of course in the end it turns out that obeying God was a REAL good idea for a host of reasons, only some of which are as obvious from the beginning as saving Evan's family and curing him of his ""clean"" fetish.Defects?  Well, the slapstick eventually got a little old for me as did Evan's absolute cluelessness; atheists in the audience will be picking up on things much faster than he does.  And as you'd expect, theologically the movie is a bit of a mess.  There is no trace of Christianity to be found anywhere; to the extent there is any Biblical connection at all, Morgan Freeman is the God of the Old Testament, as imagined by Hollywood liberals: He appears to and helps you ONLY if you are dumb enough to ask Him to, and He never bothers you about worship or obedience to any silly rules not required by the problem at hand.On the other hand He DOES display a love and concern for His Creation INCLUDING man, which makes a nice contrast with so many new age religions, and perhaps most surprising of all it turns out that He has a VERY GOOD reason for all of this, arguably several.  A hint of ""environmental wackoism"" is quickly and mercifully dropped, and this movie also comically explores an important Biblical theme: sometimes God picks somebody for reasons of His own and is EXTREMELY reluctant to accept ""no"" for an answer (see Saul of Tarsus, history of).  Another important Biblical theme perhaps unintentionally on display is Man's ability to disbelieve despite the most in your face miracles (see Jesus of Nazareth, history of).Perhaps most usefully, this movie hammers home so compellingly its repeated references to Genesis 6:14 that one assumes a lot of viewers will find themselves intrigued enough to dig up a Bible themselves and read again or for the very first time the fascinating story that there is a surprising amount of reason to accept as literal truth.  Those without a Bible could do worse than theKJV New Defenders Study Bible, which combines arguably still the best English translation (because not as ""messed with"" according to questionable theories as later translations and having almost 400 years to catch its errors) with thoughtful footnotes examining among other things the scientific implications of what the Bible says, such as for example the casually tossed off reference that prior to the Flood, IT DID NOT RAIN, thus explaining how anyone could seriously suggest the rainbow as a symbol of ANYTHING, and revealing the author(s) of Genesis to be either one(some) of the unsung heroes of early (and I do mean EARLY) Science Fiction,...or just POSSIBLY some ordinary Joe(s) merely writing down what he(they) actually

When last we saw Evan in ""Bruce Almighty"", he was playing the foil to Jim Carrey and having one of the most spectacular on air meltdowns ever recorded.In the new film ""Evan Almighty"", Evan has left his job as a Buffalo anchorman to take his place as a newly elected member of Congress. Evan ran under the campaign of ""Change the World"" and with his wife Joan (Lauren Graham), and their three sons, heads off to their new home in Virginia to embark on their new life.Evan's first day seems to be going well as he finds that he has been reassigned to a much larger office, and that he has been approached to co-sponsor a bill by prominent Congressman Long (John Goodman). This huge honor is not lost on Evan and he sets out to read the very long bill proposal at the sacrifice of a planned family outing. Needless to say this does not sit well with his children.Evan's life soon takes a series of unexpected turns when his alarm starts to go off at 6:14 every morning and mysterious shipments of wood and tools begin to arrive at his home. They are quickly dismissed as oddities, but even Evan has a hard time dismissing the arrival of a man who claims to be God (Morgan Freeman), who instructs Evan to build an Ark to prepare for a new flood.Try as he might, Evan cannot avoid the facts as he soon finds himself followed by all manner of animals and growing a beard that will not go away, despite numerous shaves.Those around Evan are convinced he is cracking from the stress of his new job, when he finally relents and begins to build the massive ark on lots adjoining his home. As the ark takes form, Evan begins to change and soon sports long hair and a beard and is clad in biblical robes.This sudden transformation as well as his declaration before Congress and the television public that God has instructed him to build an Ark soon leads Evan to be barred from his duties in Congress, and a laughing stock to the nation.Undaunted, Evan presses on, even though the strain is wearing on his family and friends as he is convinced he is doing the right thing.What follows is a funny and touching adventure as Evan and company learn about priorities, life, and what truly matters in one of the most enjoyable family comedies in years.The film works very well without being over the top or preachy in its messages. Carell once again shows why he is one of the funniest individuals in film and television.Morgan Freeman is delightful as the almighty himself as he has a very smooth and compassionate style that helps him recapture the performance he did so well in the first film.While not side-splitting funny, ""Evan Almighty"" has a lot going for it, and Carell and Freeman as well as the fine supporting cast keeps the film afloat.3.5 stars out of 5.sknr.net",3,A family film that makes you smile.,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,2815,"['Evan', 'Baxter', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'man', 'who', 'going', 'places', 'When', 'last', 'saw', 'Evan', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'was', 'playing', 'foil', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'having', 'one', 'most', 'spectacular', 'air', 'meltdowns', 'ever', 'recorded.In', 'new', 'film', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'Evan', 'left', 'job', 'Buffalo', 'anchorman', 'take', 'place', 'newly', 'elected', 'member', 'Congress', 'Evan', 'ran', 'campaign', 'Change', 'World', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'three', 'sons', 'heads', 'new', 'home', 'Virginia', 'embark', 'new', 'life.Evan', 'first', 'day', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'been', 'reassigned', 'much', 'larger', 'office', 'been', 'approached', 'co-sponsor', 'bill', 'prominent', 'Congressman', 'Long', 'John', 'Goodman', 'huge', 'honor', 'not', 'lost', 'Evan', 'out', 'read', 'very', 'long', 'bill', 'proposal', 'sacrifice', 'planned', 'family', 'outing', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'children.Evan', 'life', 'soon', 'series', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'when', 'alarm', 'go', 'off', '6:14', 'morning', 'mysterious', 'shipments', 'wood', 'tools', 'begin', 'arrive', 'home', 'are', 'quickly', 'dismissed', 'oddities', 'even', 'Evan', 'hard', 'time', 'dismissing', 'arrival', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'Evan', 'build', 'Ark', 'prepare', 'new', 'flood.Try', 'might', 'Evan', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'facts', 'soon', 'followed', 'manner', 'animals', 'growing', 'beard', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'away', 'numerous', 'shaves.Those', 'Evan', 'are', 'convinced', 'cracking', 'stress', 'new', 'job', 'when', 'finally', 'relents', 'build', 'massive', 'ark', 'lots', 'adjoining', 'home', 'ark', 'form', 'Evan', 'change', 'soon', 'sports', 'long', 'hair', 'beard', 'clad', 'biblical', 'robes.This', 'sudden', 'transformation', 'as', 'well', 'declaration', 'Congress', 'television', 'public', 'God', 'instructed', 'build', 'Ark', 'soon', 'Evan', 'be', 'barred', 'duties', 'Congress', 'laughing', 'stock', 'nation.Undaunted', 'Evan', 'even', 'strain', 'wearing', 'family', 'friends', 'convinced', 'doing', 'right', 'thing.What', 'funny', 'touching', 'adventure', 'Evan', 'company', 'learn', 'priorities', 'life', 'what', 'truly', 'matters', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'comedies', 'years.The', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'being', 'top', 'preachy', 'messages', 'Carell', 'once', 'again', 'why', 'one', 'funniest', 'individuals', 'film', 'television.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'delightful', 'almighty', 'very', 'smooth', 'compassionate', 'style', 'recapture', 'performance', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'first', 'film.While', 'not', 'side-splitting', 'funny', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'lot', 'going', 'Carell', 'Freeman', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'afloat.3.5', '5.sknr.net']",N/A

1095622,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B000UNYK4E,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[5, 6]","""The idea has recently arisen,"" Chesterton wrote, ""that if one is moral one cannot be melodramatic.""  The ""recently"" he refers to is about 100 years ago, so let me slightly update his phrase to post- modern TV and film. ""The idea has recently arisen that if one makes a film for the dreaded ""F"" genre (family), one cannot be melodramatic. Even Almighty sends that idea packing.It's not what's in this movie that makes it so good, it's what's left out. No overuse of computerized camera, which makes up the bulk of TV shows like Grays Anatomy, not to mention every movie since the Matrix. From the little I've seen of The Office, I'd say the writing in EA is, if anything better. Why? It's restrained. All art, to quote Chesterton again, is about limits. this genre starts out with the ground rules: you can't say certain things, can't do certain things, can't show certain things. Get anyone creative in there and that's the recipe for great films and TV, not the Fox fomula of everything always edgier, which shows they've learned nothing from not only Chesterton but also Marshall McLuhan (and it's also why despite my love of the medium of TV, I've cut the cable.Guess what? You don't have to make a one joke movie and tack on an overdone moral on the end like every F genre film from Ferris Beuller to Home Alone. You can actually have some smarts in a film, some-- get ready- metaphysics-- and not leave your brain on the cutting room floor. Now compare this to Dogma. That entire movie could be thrown away except for the spectacular, well- acted, gripping final scene. You can't do that with Evan Almighty. With a subtle, restrained film, you need every frame.Fox's one contribution to good TV, The Simpsons, broke the ridiculous lockdown on animation and showed you could have fun with it (which is what cartoons are for-- they don't need to go over the edge like later Adult Swim (early AS was brilliantly restrained and zany for all its warnings). EA follows The Simpsons and Groening's even more brilliant Futurama, probably the best animated show ever made, in its witty pop culture innuendo, which in EA is so subtle and restrained one may not even notice it. But note the timing of the Beatles' song, Revolution, or what ARK spells when the divine Morgan Freeman writes in the sand. And having the animals line up in twos and be drawn to Evan as to St. Francis, is a stroke of genius that never gets old.It's also not another wooden retread of the flood story, but a witty and imaginative twist. Throwing in the outtakes at the end, as with Being There and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, gives viewers what would otherwise be the bonus feature on the DVD. It seems to me an attempt to say, hey watch The Office, as well as sell the hit loaded soundtrack, but it does something wonderful as well. The great thing is that Evan, in the film, is not almighty. the great thing in the outtake is Steve Carell and the gang having fun in an F genre film.

Don't get me wrong I like Jim Carey but Bruce Almighty wasn't my cup of tea. Hearing that Steve Carell would be the star I was excited and open-minded. I didn't catch it in theater (at the same time my co-workers were telling me that I wasn't missing much). I was still hopeful (due to Carell) and saw the film on DVD.  I loved it. The comedy was great and not silly. The story also took a serious approach with Evan and his family issues.

1095624,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000UNYK4E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Some plot SPOILERS here.EVAN ALMIGHTY - more a spinoff sequel than a direct one - is a gentler movie than its predecessorBruce Almighty (Widescreen Edition), and that's why it's not as much fun. Steve Carell, while certainly a funny hombre, is not as subversive as Jim Carrey. And, without Carrey's very capricious presence, this loose sequel becomes more kid friendly, more wholesome, and quite predictable. And that's fine, if you're in the mood for that. But folks expecting more of BRUCE ALMIGHTY's Carrey-centric comedy will be disappointed (because, of course, dude isn't here). Also, the film doesn't allow Carell, master of the strained expression, to be as funny as he could be. At least, Morgan Freeman is back, and that's a very good thing. The plot concerns God (Freeman) deciding to restage the great biblical flood. Tons of green went into the CG effects, and that's nice. But, still...To get to the nitty gritty, EVAN ALMIGHTY might thrill the young 'uns, but the rest of the audience might find it harder to get on board.In BRUCE ALMIGHTY, Evan Baxter (Carell) was a minor character played for cheap laughs. Here, he's tapped to play the modern-day Noah and promoted to leading character status. Evan - former anchorman now turned newly elected Congressman - has just relocated to Washington, D.C. with his wife and three sons. Looking to further his goal to ""Change the World"" (his campaign slogan), he is coaxed by his wife to give praying a try. Evan does so, and his career path takes a weird turn when God hears his prayer and responds. Next thing you know, Evan is being plagued by the numbers 6:14. Then he has a very old-school tool kit and a massive supply of lumber mysteriously delivered to his doorstep.A hunch leads Evan to thumb thru the Bible, to Genesis 6:14, which turns out to be God's command to build an ark. Soon he meets an old guy claiming to be God. Evan is initially skeptical, but, soon, all manner of beasts in pairs begins to hound him everywhere. Then Evan gets Old Testamenty as his beard and hair sprout to a ridiculous shagginess, and he begins sporting a shabby (but very comfortable) sack cloth robe. Soon he's prophesizing an imminent flood and, even though a very dubious carpenter, managing to construct a gynormous honking ark (thanks to his manual, Ark Building for Dummies). Naturally, everyone - from his co-workers to the press to even his normally understanding wife (Lauren Graham, from GILMORE GIRLS and BAD SANTA) - begins to think him cuckoo. It doesn't look good for Evan, but, no worries. God works in mysterious, whimsical ways...So, kids will like this movie, and probably even like it a lot, what with the cute gags and the variety of animals cued on screen and the bird droppings and even Evan's uncool dances. But chances are, the grown-ups will find it only mildly appealing and maybe even in the ho-hum territory. The comedy isn't divine as much as goofy and silly (again, catered to kidlike sensibilities). Your finding it funny may hinge on just how much bird poop humor you can stand. However, I did enjoy the fun end credits segment in which the cast grooves to C&C; Music Factory's ""Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)"".The star power (and talents) of Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston are missed. But give the actors who are here some credit; they go a ways into making this film viewer friendly. Who knows what God really looks like? I don't, but I certainly buy Morgan Freeman's take on him. Freeman is serene and dignified and amiable and sweet and not at all heavy handed; he hands out his sermons and life lessons with grace. I particularly liked his scene with Lauren Graham in the diner. And isn't it cool that God has a sense of humor? By the way, lovely Lauren Graham is underused but still sparkles in her few scenes. John Goodman is wickedly effective as Evan's political mentor, who happens to dabble in some shady profiteering and land grabbing. Wanda Sykes, sorry, but she's like a rash, just irritating. I did like her comments though when she first laid eyes on Evan's crazy man beard: ""Did you fall in a mine shaft?"" And then ""Did you just come out of a coma?"" And then ""Were you attacked by a werewolf?"" As for Steve Carell, he's okay here. But you could tell he was being held back by the script and by the PG rating.EVAN ALMIGHTY has its heart in the right place, which I guess is as comforting as saying your blind date has a good personality. It's a decent watch, especially if you're babysitting, and that ark certainly looks majestic. But, ultimately, the story just doesn't deliver enough and is undermined by its overblown CG effects and its PG-rated silliness. The highlight for me is Morgan Freeman's downhome and playful performance, but, then again, my feeling is that Morgan Freeman can do no wrong. With that being said, if you're looking for films deploying biblical zaniness, stick with BRUCE ALMIGHTY or evenOh, God!",3,"""Did you fall in a mine shaft?""",1209081600,"04 25,

If you have to choose between watching this in either format, go with HD DVD without hesitation... the quality difference in video (not so much sound) is well worth any added cost.As for the movie, I loved it.  First, it was every bit as funny as the original one if not more.  The actors did a phenomenal job and it is one more reason why I love watching Steve Carell.  Morgan Freeman makes an awesome ""creator of us all"" and the addition of Wanda Sykes added a lot of comedic value to the film.  In fact, most of the laugh out loud moments involved her comments throughout the show.I appreciated the fact that this movie seemed to be written with the family in mind.  It really struck a cord with me how the script focused a lot on the importance of family and sticking together.  Which is why I was a little befuddled by some of the comments in the show.  When the youngest kid made a comment about a duck's private parts I just cringed knowing that my son had just watched that.  I just had to shake my head and question why that line was put in there.  It wasn't that funny -- except the shock value might have made a few people laugh -- and it didn't add any value to the plot or story.  I thought they had handled not crossing the line of mocking God until the very last line of the movie when God gives us a ""new commandment.""  Again, not funny though it was playing with a gag that had made its run through the movie.  I just wish that if they were going to make a movie for the kids (which I think is GREAT and preferred) then make sure the entire script reflects this.  It might be one reason why the movie didn't resonate with critics so well.

The best part of that entire movie was Steve Carell's character ""Evan"".  Unfortunately his performance didn't carry on to this film.  I'm a huge Steve Carell fan & have been since his days on ""The Daily Show"".  After seeing the trailer for the film it looked funny enough, & I figured even if this movie was bad, Carell could save it.Unfortunately that was not the case here.  No one performance was able to save this stupid, Stupid, STUPID movie & with the likes of John Goodman & Wanda Sykes (not to mention Carell) onboard you know there's a major problem.  There's nothing even ""family"" about this film; as adults will find nothing humorous about it.  You'll get alot of really stupid immature child safe humour, but that's about it.  The Evan character isn't even anything like the character from the 1st film?The other thing wrong about this picture is it's REALLY, REALLY preachy.  I understand it's a film about god & building an ark, but the 1st film kept that to a minimum & centered around Jim Carey's ""Bruce"" character.  About the only thing this film does right is demonstrate exactly how proposterous the idea of ""Noah's Ark"" really is.  ""Evan Almighty"" is just another example of Hollywood cashing in on a one time moneymaker without any real thought or energy :(.  Steve, I understand you gotta eat too, but come on man you're better than this.I thought the movie was absolutely horrible & couldn't recommend it to anyone.  Even the biggest Steve Carell fan will wish they hadn't wasted their time on this wretched dung heap.

1095633,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,B000UNYK4E,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[6, 11]","With views all over the map here, I feel a need to comment. My wife insisted that we watch this as the previews made it look hysterical. I never saw them, so don't know, but if they did, the guy who created them should get a 1000% raise. This is a bad film. Maybe even a terrible film. There were about 6 good laughs in it, but the cliches and the overacting and the paperboard (not even substantial enough to be cardboard) characters made a tedious and silly movie that makes no sense. Why did he need animals for a two minute flood? Because without them, the film would have nothing going for it.But besides all of the above, the themes are utterly stupid and theologically insulting. Environmentalism is the new religion in Hollywood (if you're an environmentalist though, don't watch the extras where they show how they built a full size ark out of steel and cedar, and presumably scrapped it when the film was complete as it was too large for an amusement park that wanted it.) If God came and spoke to a man today, I don't think he'd tell him to fight for the environment. I think He'd tell him to demand repentance. Throughout history, those chosen by God said ""Amend your ways, you sinners."" But THAT speech would be a bit hypocritical coming from a Hollywood that celebrates and worships everything God finds repellent. So, random acts of kindness (contorted to acts of random kindness here) and stopping development are God's new concerns. Yeah, right. A loving God wants us to be his children, and we do so not by protecting woodpeckers or helping little old ladies across the street, important though those acts may be, but by placing ourselves under His authority. Hollywood, and much of America, thinks you can earn salvation by being good enough. But the message over and over is that actions are the result of your obedience, not the end in themselves. It does have one solid line, where God says ""If you pray for courage, wouldn't God give you not courage, but the opportunity to be courageous?""So this movie achieves a rare triple crown. Boring and stupid with special effects substituting for content, overacted and poorly directed, and thematically trite. Avoid avoid avoid.

1095636,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000UNYK4E,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[0, 1]","Mocking biblical events is something that Hollywood has been doing for a long time--with mostly bad jokes and no taste. Evan Almighty is not an exception to Hollywood's heavenly equation. Once again, we deal with a cute, but tiresome lesson of ""be yourself and help others"" that most of us are used to by now--in other words, nothing new. All of this combined with a predictable story, non existent jokes, CGI disasters, and many creatures from the animal kingdom. Also there is a clear example that politicians suffer from amnesia as soon as they take office, and they need God to remind them of their campaign promises.Yes, Steve Carell is a charming actor--and could be very good for family movies such as this--but his full potential, as an actor, is missing.Brief Introduction Story:Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) is a charismatic newsman-turned-congressman who won his new title because of his catchy slogan ""Change the World"" that he used so eagerly during the campaign. Now in his new position, he decides to move in to a new big house along with his wife Joan (Lauren Graham) and their three boys. On the first night in his new house, before going to bed, Evan prays to God for wisdom. The next day, a series of strange events are happening--like animals following him around and getting materials he didn't order. Then, while he is in his front yard, God (Morgan Freeman) tells him that he has to build an ark. At first, Evan didn't believe him, but more ""signs"" appear before him. Finally he acknowledges it and decides to build it. While he is doing so, he has to deal with his personal problems with his not-so-happy wife. Also, he has important duties as a congressman that can make a difference for his community.Review:Right away, we get to know what kind of character Mr. Baxter is. He is a likable guy who loves his family, but very meticulous about his image and doesn't like pets that much. But after his encounter with God, Mr. Baxter changes physically--a la Santa Clause movie--but most importantly, he finally begins to understand the meaning of family values, love for animals and why the almighty chose him. I like Steven Carell and Morgan Freeman. They are terrific actors, but their acting abilities are in ""cruise-control"" in this one. In other words, they don't try hard enough to give more ""punch"" to their characters--especially Freeman who is just being Freeman for the tenth time. Because of this flaw, the movie feels tired and with very little excitement.You expect some decent special effects when it comes to an event such as the Great Flood, but if you're going to watch this movie, just don't get your hopes up. I'd like to call it ""mini flood"" because the special effects are not that impressive. Basically it's more like a straight-to-video quality. Not even the computer animated animals look good. These trained and mostly ""CGI"" creatures are no more than background images for the film--there is very little interaction between Mr. Baxter and them. No strong feelings, very little drama.The Verdict:I wonder what Mel Gibson would have done with a film like this. Maybe Noah would have gotten a ""super hero"" status and the animals would have been more aggressive for survival--it would have been rated R too. Evan Almighty is a ""straight-to-video"" sequel from the decent 2003 original. This time we get a lame story with cheesy special effects. Not even the ""A-class actors"" couldn't save this boring sequel. Hollywood needs better writers to make family movies more fun again.",3,Evan Almighty is not an exception to Hollywood's heavenly equation,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,3517,"['Mocking', 'biblical', 'events', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'doing', 'long', 'time', 'mostly', 'bad', 'jokes', 'taste', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'not', 'exception', 'Hollywood', 'heavenly', 'equation', 'Once', 'again', 'deal', 'cute', 'tiresome', 'lesson', 'be', 'help', 'others', 'most', 'are', 'used', 'now', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'new', 'combined', 'predictable', 'story', 'non', 'existent', 'jokes', 'CGI', 'disasters', 'many', 'creatures', 'animal', 'kingdom', 'Also', 'clear', 'example', 'politicians', 'suffer', 'amnesia', 'as', 'soon', 'take', 'office', 'need', 'God', 'remind', 'campaign', 'promises.Yes', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'charming', 'actor', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'family', 'movies', 'such', 'full', 'potential', 'actor', 'missing.Brief', 'Introduction', 'Story', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'charismatic', 'newsman-turned-congressman', 'who', 'won', 'new', 'title', 'catchy', 'slogan', 'Change', 'World', 'used', 'so', 'eagerly', 'campaign', 'Now', 'new', 'position', 'move', 'new', 'big', 'house', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'three', 'boys', 'first', 'night', 'new', 'house', 'going', 'bed', 'Evan', 'God', 'wisdom', 'next', 'day', 'series', 'strange', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'animals', 'following', 'around', 'getting', 'materials', 'did', ""n't"", 'order', 'Then', 'front', 'yard', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'build', 'ark', 'first', 'Evan', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'more', 'signs', 'appear', 'Finally', 'build', 'doing', 'so', 'deal', 'personal', 'problems', 'not-so-happy', 'wife', 'Also', 'important', 'duties', 'congressman', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'community.Review', 'Right', 'away', 'get', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Baxter', 'likable', 'guy', 'who', 'family', 'very', 'meticulous', 'image', ""n't"", 'like', 'pets', 'much', 'encounter', 'God', 'Mr.', 'Baxter', 'physically', 'la', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'movie', 'most', 'importantly', 'finally', 'understand', 'meaning', 'family', 'values', 'love', 'animals', 'why', 'almighty', 'chose', 'Steven', 'Carell', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'terrific', 'actors', 'acting', 'abilities', 'are', 'cruise-control', 'one', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'give', 'more', 'punch', 'characters', 'especially', 'Freeman', 'who', 'just', 'being', 'Freeman', 'tenth', 'time', 'flaw', 'movie', 'feels', 'tired', 'very', 'little', 'excitement.You', 'expect', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'when', 'event', 'such', 'Great', 'Flood', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', ""'d"", 'like', 'call', 'mini', 'flood', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'impressive', 'Basically', 'more', 'straight-to-video', 'quality', 'Not', 'even', 'computer', 'animated', 'animals', 'look', 'good', 'trained', 'mostly', 'CGI', 'creatures', 'are', 'more', 'background', 'images', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'interaction', 'Mr.', 'Baxter', 'strong', 'feelings', 'very', 'little', 'drama.The', 'Verdict', 'wonder', 'what', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'Maybe', 'Noah', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'super', 'hero', 'status', 'animals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'aggressive', 'survival', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'R', 'too', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'straight-to-video', 'sequel', 'decent', '2003', 'original', 'time', 'get', 'lame', 'story', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'Not', 'even', 'A-class', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'boring', 'sequel', 'Hollywood', 'better', 'writers', 'make', 'family', 'movies', 'more', 'fun', 'again']",N/A

It is a lot different than Bruce Almighty and I was glad to see that. Anyway, this is basically a movie about change. The concept of change is everywhere in this movie and the character Evan goes through a lot of changes. Sure, it is a funny movie, not the funniest, but the movie has a good feeling to it that works really well. It has a good message. Steve Carell does a great job as being someone who gives in to something that he doesn't understand, but he uses faith and trust to guide him. He is loyal in his task, and his focus is incredible. He really does a great job of showing that single focus for something he believes in... but the movie is great because it shows him evolve into that.

1095639,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000UNYK4E,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 3]","After Universal Studios' smash hit comedy ""Bruce Almighty"", I figured that the powers-that-be would waste little time in trying to cash in on that success and attempt a sequel. But time went by and I never heard any word on another Jim Carrey `Bruce' sequel. That is, until about three or so years later when I read about a sequel to ""Bruce Almighty"", directed yet again by Tom Shadyac (""Bruce Almighty"" and ""Liar Liar""), but this one wouldn't focus on Jim Carrey's character from the first movie; but instead would follow the exploits of rival anchorman Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who would find himself face-to-face with God (Morgan Freeman reprising his role) in the appropriately named ""Evan Almighty"".""Evan Almighty"" follows the blossoming political career of former news anchorman Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who has recently become a junior congressman and has moved his family into an upper-class suburban neighborhood. But things don't seem to go as planned for Evan, whose motto of ""Change the world"" is shared by none other than the Almighty God (Morgan Freeman). It seems that God is planning another flood of Biblical proportions and He wants Evan Baxter and his family to build an ark to save not only themselves but all the animals, in pairs of two of course, and anyone else who will listen to their message. Of course, Evan resists, but it isn't long before God's request gets through to him after numerous shipments of lumber arrive at his front steps and animals follow him everywhere he goes, Evan finally submits to God's will and with the aid of his family builds the ark, becoming a modern day tale of Noah that must be seen to be believed.I for one thought Jim Carrey's film ""Bruce Almighty"" was absolutely hilarious, and when I heard that the sequel was not even going to feature Jim at all, I figured that this must not be all that good of a movie, since he chose to pass up on the chance to make a sequel for what was easily one of his funniest movies in a while. However, I've been wrong before and I was wrong yet again, because not only is ""Evan Almighty"" funny, but I think it is actually a better movie than its predecessor, which surprises me to say.I never thought that based on the first film that Steve Carell would be able to make his character of Evan into anyone worth watching or even rooting for, but after seeing him in this movie I was clearly mistaken. Evan's journey over the course of this film sees him go from self-absorbed junior congressman who puts his family on the backburner to further his political career, to a humble man that is all about his family and is willing to listen and do what God wants. His was a much deeper journey than Bruce's was in the first film, but even with the somewhat more dramatic story, the movie was still just as funny, if not funnier in some instances than ""Bruce Almighty"". Morgan Freeman continues his terrific portrayal of God that he started in the first film. As far as actors go, Morgan is probably one of the few, if not the only actor, who could pull off this role without camping it up or crossing questionable lines. He always manages to portray God as He should be, as a loving Creator who wants His creation to love Him and to change the world for the betterment of mankind. John Goodman as a morally questionable senator was fun to watch, and was an appropriate choice for a source of conflict in the movie. Lauren Graham (TV's ""Gilmore Girls"") was very good as Evan's loving wife who supports him in all that he does while struggling to hold herself and her family together when it seems her husband has possibly lost his mind after choosing to become a modern day Noah. And lastly, Wanda Sykes was hilarious as Evan's assistant and provided some of the funniest one-liners in the entire film, a benefit no doubt of her stand-up comedy roots.

I was hesitant to watch its sequel, ""Evan Almighty,"" for a number of reasons.  Firstly, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) was technically a villain in the first film.  Secondly, I wasn't too sure about the PG rating for the film, thinking that a toned-down sequel would lose some of the schtick of the first film.  Also, I found it hard to swallow the idea of a modern-day ""Noah's Ark"" story.  I was quite surprised with the end result, however.Morgan Freeman reprises his role as God, and does a fine and funny job of it.  This time around, we find Evan giving up his day job as a newscaster and heading for Capitol Hill.  He's taken under the wing of congressman Long (John Goodman), a seedy but slick politician who's out to make a profit by manipulating a few environmental roadblocks.  Long believes that with Baxter in his corner, he can get the necessary changes made to go ahead with his development plans.Of course, God has other plans for both parties, and asks Evan to literally build an ark (with animal pairings to boot).  What is the reasoning behind building an ark?  God works in mysterious ways, and despite resisting him at first, Evan goes along with the Big Guy and builds the ark for better or worse.  The result is an environmental message draped with a blanket of generic Christian (or Jewish, since the story of Noah's ark is from the Old Testament) values that no one except the most staunch atheist will find offensive.  It's nice to see some Biblical values presented in a positive light, but don't turn to this film for some deep theological wisdom.With a solid supporting cast including Lauren Graham and Wanda Sykes, among others, ""Evan Almighty"" is an excellent, family-friendly film that will please the youngsters and the old folks equally.  The special effects are excellent, but it's the plot that makes this film worth repeat viewings.

Critics weren't that impressed with it, and its opening weekend only pulled in half the sales of the original movie, Bruce Allmighty. Nonetheless, it did earn a #1 spot in the box office for a short period of time.This movie will make you smile. It's a family movie - the plot is predictable and slightly formulaic. It's mostly about Steve Carell being goofy - most of the other characters were somewhat flat & undeveloped.But for me, Steve Carell's goofiness is enough to carry a movie. When the critics point out plot problems, I think they miss the point. It's funny, it's got a great moral to the story (in fact, a much better social statement than Bruce Allmighty), and it's appropriate for all ages. Plus, they went to great pains working with the Humane Society to make sure all the animals were respected (and if you like animals, there were A LOT in this movie).I really didn't think that John Goodman and Morgan Freeman added much to the movie. But, we did get some great laughs from Wanda Sikes, and from Ed Helms - who rose to fame with Steve Carell in theThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart - Indecision 2004, and now appears with Steve Carell in NBC'sThe Office: Seasons One and Two. This movie obviously didn't have as much edgy humor as either of those shows, but again, the point is to entertain the entire family, with a story that has a good moral.Good family movie.

Packing up his wife Joan (Lauren Graham) and three kids, they move to a valley in Virginia.  They've got a new car and a just built giant house.  Life is good.Things seem to be going well for the freshman Congressman at work, too.  Evan has a nice, big office, and Congressman Long (John Goodman) is asking him to be a junior sponsor on a new bill.  This could be just the ticket he needs to launch his political career and fulfill his campaign promise to change the world.But then weird things start to happen.  A box of building supplies appears on their doorstep.  The next morning, lumber is delivered.  And everywhere Evan goes the numbers 614 keep appearing.Then God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan and tells him to build an ark.  If anyone asks why, he's to tell them that a flood is coming.  Never mind that the city is in the middle of a huge drought.  Can God get Evan's attention?  Will Evan obey?It took me a while to give BRUCE ALMIGHTY a chance, and when I did, I discovered a comedy I really enjoyed.  So I had to give this one a try.  While the first is aimed at adults, this is more of a family comedy.  The worse thing we get is some crude humor, but you may want to preview it before you show it to them.  And kids would definitely love watching the animal antics.The movie is funny.  While not wall to wall laughs, I laughed plenty and had a smile on my face at the end.  It worked because everything was believable, or as believable as it could be giving the situation.  I identified with Evan's reactions to God's appearances.  And of course a giant ark would create a media circus.  Yet the movie is heartwarming.  Some of the morals are rather blatant, but the action never slows down too long for the lessons.I've heard people complain about the variety of animals that show up.  Granted, they didn't need to be there.  But if you view the story as a modern day Noah, their presence was appropriate.  And they really added to the story.  There are lots of cute moments with them and lots of laughs as well.  I can't even imagine how much training went into this film.And that's not to take away from the human stars.  Everyone did a great job.  Steve Carell gets bonus points in my book for a few of those scenes with the animals.  I certainly would have been freaking out if I had had to shoot them.  Special mention must be made of Wanda Sykes who plays one of Evan's Congressional aids.  Her character could have been over the top, but she pulls it back and gets lots of laughs.Those most familiar with the Biblical story of Noah will find a couple jokes here only they will get.  Yet the majority of the Bible jokes are explained for a wider audience.  There may be some points of concern for people who believe the Bible, but they are minor to the enjoyment of the film.  It certainly didn't ruin it for me.Yes, there were a few slow spots.

As in the first, Morgan Freeman returns as God on a mission to help the world with a little help from the least likely of prospects.Steve Carell (TV' ""The Office"") stars as Evan Baxter, a top news anchor dropping out from in front of the camera to become a congressman. Vowing to make a change, he starts out at the top, aided by long time congressman Chuck Long (John Goodman). Before his first day, he offers a private prayer to God for guidance and to help make that difference.Within days the world is changed forever for Evan Baxter as he speaks with God who tells him he wants him to build an ark. Sound familiar? Even Baxter thinks so but he doubts that he has actually spoken to the Almighty. But with a little convincing he begins to see the light and up goes the ark.The expected results occur, everything from Congress thinking he's gone insane to his wife (Lauren Graham) thinking he's having a mid-life crisis. Only his three sons get into the act as well as a huge number of animals that begin showing in pairs.The end play offers a twist to the flood scenario that makes sense in the build up of the film. All lose ends are tied up nicely with a satisfying result. But oddly enough it seems that many who saw this film, or who were counting on it, missed the point.Upon its release to theaters, the talk revolved around not the story that was being told her but more about the costs to make it. If not the costs, discussion roamed to the area of the number of actual animals used in the film. But rarely did you see any discussion of God when this movie was spoken of.Perhaps this movie needs to be seen once again or at home on DVD for it to be truly appreciated. It's rare these days to find a film that not only revolves around God but to find God mentioned at all. And the story here relies less on your belief system and more on the concepts of God and caring for one another.This is by no means a great movie. It is not necessarily a movie that everyone will want to add to their collection. But it is an uplifting tale that, while simplistic in its answers, does make you think.

1095661,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000UNYK4E,Mike Zimmerman,"[0, 0]","After being elected to congress, former anchorman Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) moves with his family (Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett) to his new stomping grounds. Of course, he's visited by the Almighty himself (Morgan Freeman) who recently finished with Bruce Nolan. This time around, God wants Evan to build an arc for an upcoming flood. Of course, the congressman finds it hard to believe, but when animals flock around him, his beard starts growing, he loses his job, and winds up with lumber on his backyard, he has no choice but to fulfill his purpose. But with skeptics including his family and aides (Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill), and scheming Chairman of Congress Chuck Long (John Goodman) plotting something sinister, something sure is going to make it harder than it seems.Back in '03, director Tom Shadyac reunited with Jim Carrey after the recent abomination that was ""The Majestic"" to bring the comic actor back to original grounds with ""Bruce Almighty"". Sure, it got a little sentimental at the end, but the comedy (God is black? And played by Morgan Freeman?) and the money it raked in ensured it to be a success story. Of course, who could forget Steve Carell's turn in the film? I guess this is why they wanted to make ""Evan Almighty"".Much is to be debated here. Because of the amount of special effects, the star power (Steve Carell, as usual), and possibly something I may be missing, ""Evan Almighty"" has the estimated budget of $175 million. It's adequate, especially since it's being released in summer, so what am I to complain? Well, the film sucks... almost.One of the things is the rating. ""Bruce Almighty"" had Jim Carrey dropping the F bomb on live TV, Jennifer Aniston's breasts were made larger, a woman's skirt blew in the wind, a monkey jumping out of the crack of a cholo, a peeing dog... I could go on. For some reason (::cough:: Evan's kids), Shadyac wanted to appeal to families and play it oh-so-safe so no one gets offended. However, this puts a damper on the comedy. All we get are tired gross-out gags (almost hardly any scene goes by without bird doo-doo, and a couple of penis gags), unfunny slapstick, semi-nudity, cutaways to animals, and - I can't believe I'm saying this - Carell himself!You know what? Unfunny and Steve Carell - who also serves as producer - dare not go in the same sentence. Thanks to hits like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (which gets a reference in the film), ""Little Miss Sunshine"", and TV's ""The Office"", Carell has become a Hollywood director's choice when it ain't Larry the Cable Guy or Owen Wilson. Sadly, ""Evan Almighty"" could be proof that maybe he should be more choosier with his selection of projects. Because of the shallowness of Steve Oedekerk's script, he overcompensates with screaming, mugging, and any other comedy tic that Jim Carrey successfully handled in the past. Because of this, promising performers like John Goodman, Lauren Graham (from ""Bad Santa"" and ""Gilmore Girls"" to this?), Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, and Wanda Sykes (the strongest out of the bunch, even if this isn't one of her good days) just stand there looking lost.Thank God (no pun intended) that Morgan Freeman comes off like a seasoned pro. Much like the recent talented mention, Freeman is more calm and assured in his talents. Carell would've benefited from his lack of cheesy tics.And note to Shadyac and Oedenkirk: having the always delightful and talented Arden Myrin (of ""MadTV"") not given ANYTHING to say or do is pretty much a crime against humanity. Will Sasso stole the show in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" and Bobby Lee managed to squeeze out some laughs in ""Kickin' it Old Skool""; Myrin's just... there. Okay, so ""MadTV"" ain't much of a big deal like ""Saturday Night Live"", but at least it has some performers looking to hit big (I hope you're reading this, Mrs. Nicole Parker).It's a testament that original writers Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe don't fill the air with maudlin scenes (which, I heard, drowned the Adam Sandler summer bomb ""Click""). ""Evan Almighty"" stumbles when trying to be serious (Lauren Graham, sadly, ain't no Jennifer Aniston...

So I do enjoy that aspect of this movie.  That being said, it was probably the best part of the movie, as a lot of it is just downright cheesy.  It's technically a sequel to Bruce Almighty, but the only tie-in is Morgan Freeman, so this could be watched without watching that one first.Evan Baxter is a news reporter turned Congressman who's just moved to VA to start his term.  He has a new house and car, and has uprooted his family to take this position.  But he's the new guy in town so he has to set himself  to prove what he's worth, especially to another bullying Congressman.  But when a prayer goes awry has lots of wood, animals, and other implements being delivered to his home, it becomes tougher and tougher to maintain his position.  And when his hair and beard starts growing, well that's another story entirely.  God wants him to build an arc, but in suburban VA that is a mighty task indeed.Characters:Steve Carell: Evan BaxterMorgan Freeman: GodLauren Graham: Joan BaxterWanda Sykes: RitaJohn Goodman: Congressman Chuck LongI like Carell in the office, and really, that's about the only place I like him.  I think he's just a little too over the top for most other things.  Morgan Freeman however, was the best part of this movie.  He just makes a great God and has such a calm relaxed demeanor that it's a pleasure to watch him.  Sykes was a little underused as one of Evan's assistants.  She provided some comic relief but was used so sparsely that her contributions didn't really matter.  And Goodman was a very heavy handed bad guy, but he did a good job of it given the subject matter he had to work with.The plot was ok.  Like Bruce Almighty it was based off of the Christian religion and this time centered around the Noah's Ark story.  I did think they correlated the stories well between that in the bible and putting a modern spin on it.  And it was fun to watch the animals.  But Carrell almost put too much effort into making the film funny and it felt forced.  Actually, most of the comedy in it felt pretty forced.  And if you're a strict Christian some of the joking might not be to your tastes.  Being non-religious, it didn't bother me at all though so I'm not the best judge at making that call.The cinematography and music were average as well.  The music was mostly background and instrumental and there wasn't any focus on it, so I can't say I particularly enjoyed it or even would have missed it if it wasn't there.  The special effects done with the animals was great and there were quite a few used so the variety was nice.  But the beard growing and some of the other stuff wasn't particularly well done and contributed to the cheesiness factor.An ok movie but nothing spectacular.  I'd watch it if it came on tv and nothing better was on, but I wouldn't seek it out again.Review by M.

What made Bruce Almighty work was that the audience could relate to Bruce-a man who had such bad luck that it seemed that the universe was against him until he gets this once in a lifetime opportunity.  Who hasn't felt like the universe was against them at some point in their lives?  From the moment Evan's journey starts, I can't relate to him and the film makers don't even try to get me to relate.  I agree that this was just a strong enviromential campaign run amuck.  Do you KNOW how long it took Noah and his family to build the first Ark?  But I'm supposed to believe Evan and his small family was able to build one in what-a few months?  The laughing public not wondering where the heck animals that shouldn't even be in that region roaming around came from.  And I agree with another reviewer-why were they needed if in fact God wasn't going to flood the world and start over?  That flood had nothing on Katrina or the Tsunami of '04-so what was up with the animals?  I think the series should have stuck with the original concept of another lucky and seeming miserable human getting the opportunity to see what an awesome task of being God for a short period of time and racking up the laughs that way.

1095676,AV33FCIDH59N8,B000UNYK4E,Reviewer,"[9, 9]","This is a GREAT movie inspite of the reviews given to it by certain critics.  (especially critics who happened to compete with it's opening debute).  This movie is NOT about a man building an ark, although that appears to be on the surface.  It is about a man who is forced into circumstances which seem to be unalterable, taking him further away from his own personal aims in life only to find himself again.  He must surrender his own life's plans for plans that appear completely incongruent to his own by Divine interference.  He is pushed to the edge of his sanity while his stable and well grounded wife watches him hopelessly slip away. Ultimately, when his own strategies fail, he surrenders to his divine mission and plunges into his project whole heartedly at the cost of his job, family, and his reputation.  Steve Carell plays the role so beautifully, full of laughs and humor, drama and tears.  And Morgan Freeman, who plays God, is so wonderfully warm and true, he touches the hearts of all.  And how many times in our real lives are we seemingly pulled off course, away from our goals, only to arrive at the point where we wanted to be - made stronger, wiser, and more experienced than if we made a straight line towards our target? (Are the critics so dumb that they cannot see beyond the superficial appearance of this movie?  What planet are they from?)The movie doesn't preach so much as to teach us the importance of our courage, commitment, faith, and love.  The movie reveals a core of values and give courage to notice our opportunities to make some difference in life while having the faith to do it when nothing around seems to support us.  People who think this movie is about the remake of Noah's ark missed the premise entirely. This movie has a full gamut of emotions and is tenderly linked to the tangibility that makes up our humaness.  It is a movie for the whole family to enjoy.Also, practicing what it teaches, this movie was the first ""green"" movie ever made.  It cost $175 million dollars to make and every scrap of construction materials that were used in the movie (even to make a life size ark) was recycled and given to an earth-conscious charities.  It has more heart, soul, and substance than anything out there right now and is the perfect movie for the entire family.

1095680,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000UNYK4E,Robert Moore,"[1, 6]","I love both Lauren Graham (memo to Hollywood:  put her in SOMETHING, please!) and Steve Carrell so I figured this movie couldn't be that bad.  But it was.  I can honestly say that this is a movie completely devoid of wit or intelligence.  My friend and I are both fans of Carrell and especially Graham, but just over the halfway point we were in misery.  We finally skipped to the final two chapters on the DVD just to see how it ended, but all in all it was a pretty tortorous experience.I'm becoming increasingly concerned about Steve Carrell's movie career.  I've been a fan of his for a long time.  In fact, I saw him on stage years before he ever appeared on TV or in movies, as part of Second City in Chicago, where he did an incredibly memorable impersonation of Fabio (in the previous scene he'd been wearing a suit, so he merely took off jacket and shirt, put on a long wig, and stood in front of a fan that would blow his hair back).  I followed him with joy on The Daily Show, liked him in his various supporting film roles leading up to THE OFFICE and THE FORTY YEAR OLD VIRGIN, and have seen most if not all of his movies.  But let's face it:  his movies of late have been absolutely miserable experiences.  In fact, of the movies that I've seen in the last year, the two worst just might be EVAN ALMIGHTY and DAN IN REAL LIFE.  The last movie that I can say that I genuinely enjoyed that he was in was LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.Lauren Graham, where are you?  For most of this decade Lauren Graham was my favorite actress on TV.  I honestly think she is the finest comic actress in the history of TV (yes, I like her more than Lucille Ball).  Since the end of THE GILMORE GIRLS I've wanted in vain for her reemergence.  And her movie roles have been far too few.  I liked BAD SANTA and that was about it.  Hollywood needs to find a new vehicle for her considerable talents.  Unfortunately, based on EVAN ALMIGHTY you wouldn't think she had any.Frankly, I'm really unhappy about the state of comedy in Hollywood right now.  I personally don't care for the films of the Judd Apatow collective (too much sophomoric humor; not enough genuine wit; no romance to speak of, as was the case in the great screwball comedies of the past) and I think they've exerted an unhealthy influence on comedy as a whole.  The only comedic film of the past year that I have enjoyed was JUNO (which I enjoyed very much indeed).  My favorite film genre is the romantic comedy, but there simply have been no great romantic comedies in recent years.  Broad, unfunny farces like EVAN ALMIGHTY seems to be all that we get.  Hollywood needs to find the new Meg Ryan and get their comedic rear end back into gear.I know this is getting some good reviews here, but I can't imagine any serious movie buff finding this to be anything but awful.  The film critics universally blasted this.  If you have seen a very large number of movies (the kind of person who has watched a couple of hundred a year for several years), it is just impossible to enjoy this movie.  If you are a more casual watcher of movies, averaging only a few dozen a year, the film might dupe you.

1095681,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000UNYK4E,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 3]","*Spoilers*In ""Evan Almighty,"" God turns out to be a celestial one-trick-pony (or should that be a PAIR of one-trick-ponies?).Apparently, the good Lord does what every cheapjack Hollywood mogul does when he's run out of fresh ideas and inspiration: He remakes one of the old standbys that proved its worth the first time around.  And what more dramatic material to bring up to date than the story of Noah and the worldwide flood?Well, I guess if Billy Bob Thornton can single-handedly build a fully functioning rocket in his own barn, then Steve Carell can certainly construct a full-scale, floatable ark in his backyard - although in fairness to Thornton, it should be pointed out that his character doesn't have God Himself, in the person of a gap-toothed Morgan Freeman, providing him with the resources and know-how necessary to get the job done.""Evan Almighty"" is an in-name-only sequel to the hit comedy ""Bruce Almighty"" from a few years back.  In the lead role, Jim Carrey has been replaced by Steve Carell, who played the manipulative, sarcastic Buffalo weatherman, Evan Baxter, in the previous film.  Somehow, Baxter seems to have undergone a complete personality transformation over the course of several years, since now he is a puppy-dog idealist who has just been elected to the U.S. Congress on the ever-so-trite slogan, "" Change the World.""  However, no sooner does he move his family from upstate New York to suburban Virginia than he begins receiving visitations from a strange man claiming to be God and commanding Evan to build an ark on the lot next door.  Naturally, his family and co-workers believe the poor man has gone off the deep end, although here the movie betrays its lack of internal consistency since the ""miracles"" that are occurring to him - being followed all over town by pairs of exotic animals, being unable to shave his newly grown beard and whiskers etc. - are there for all to see, thus making the disbelief of the populace either a monument to their own stupidity or, more likely, an implausible, heavy-handed plot device.  And speaking of plot devices, why do all these non-indigenous creatures like giraffes, elephants and lions - let alone all the birds - show up to this location when the flood itself turns out to be a mere local event?  Exactly what are they fleeing from (unless there`s a zoo with very flimsy cages nearby which we know nothing about)?And, of course, to smooth things over for modern audiences, who might be made a trifle uncomfortable by all the wanton death and destruction in the original story, the Steve Oedekerk script is quick to point out that THIS flood is no act of wrath on the part of God, and that even the first one was actually a tale about commitment and love.  Is there nothing Hollywood can't reduce to sheer dreck and utter pablum?Directed by Tim Shadyac, ""Evan Almighty"" is said to be the most expensive comedy ever made.  Well, the ""expense"" we can see, what will all the CGI effects and animal-control needed to make the concept come to life on screen.  The ""comedy,"" on the other hand, is a trifle more difficult to discern.  Even though the movie gets its requisite dog-poop joke out of the way in the first five minutes, this is a decidedly more tame, family-friendly movie than the often raunchy ""Bruce Almighty.""  That would be fine if the jokes in ""Evan Almighty"" happened to be funny.  Instead of humor, however, we`re given a God who smiles smugly and delivers sappy little homilies about belief and faith in terms so simpering and blithe they make your average Sunday School lesson seem edgy and dark in comparison.Carell does what he can with a poorly written part, but Freeman's arch condescension wears thin very early on.  Wanda Sykes, as one of Baxter's Congressional aides, repeats her trick from the wretched ""Monster-in-law"" of hijacking all the movie's best lines, and one wishes she could at least have been assigned the role of Mrs. Noah as a means of garnering her a bit more time on screen.Here's hoping that God comes up with new and better material - or at least a better ghost-writer - the next time around.",2,God needs a new scenarist,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,4119,"['*Spoilers*In', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'God', 'out', 'be', 'celestial', 'one-trick-pony', 'should', 'be', 'PAIR', 'one-trick-ponies', '.Apparently', 'good', 'Lord', 'what', 'cheapjack', 'Hollywood', 'mogul', 'when', 'run', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'inspiration', 'one', 'old', 'standbys', 'proved', 'worth', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'what', 'more', 'dramatic', 'material', 'bring', 'up', 'date', 'story', 'Noah', 'worldwide', 'flood', 'Well', 'guess', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'can', 'single-handedly', 'build', 'fully', 'functioning', 'rocket', 'own', 'barn', 'then', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'can', 'certainly', 'construct', 'full-scale', 'floatable', 'ark', 'backyard', 'fairness', 'Thornton', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'God', 'Himself', 'person', 'gap-toothed', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'providing', 'resources', 'know-how', 'necessary', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'in-name-only', 'sequel', 'hit', 'comedy', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'lead', 'role', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'been', 'replaced', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'who', 'played', 'manipulative', 'sarcastic', 'Buffalo', 'weatherman', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'previous', 'film', 'Somehow', 'Baxter', 'have', 'undergone', 'complete', 'personality', 'transformation', 'course', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'puppy-dog', 'idealist', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'elected', 'U.S.', 'Congress', 'ever-so-trite', 'slogan', 'Change', 'World', 'However', 'sooner', 'move', 'family', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'suburban', 'Virginia', 'receiving', 'visitations', 'strange', 'man', 'claiming', 'be', 'God', 'commanding', 'Evan', 'build', 'ark', 'lot', 'next', 'door', 'Naturally', 'family', 'co-workers', 'believe', 'poor', 'man', 'gone', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'here', 'movie', 'lack', 'internal', 'consistency', 'miracles', 'are', 'occurring', 'being', 'followed', 'town', 'pairs', 'exotic', 'animals', 'being', 'unable', 'shave', 'newly', 'grown', 'beard', 'whiskers', 'etc', 'are', 'there', 'see', 'thus', 'making', 'disbelief', 'populace', 'monument', 'own', 'stupidity', 'more', 'likely', 'implausible', 'heavy-handed', 'plot', 'device', 'speaking', 'plot', 'devices', 'why', 'do', 'non-indigenous', 'creatures', 'giraffes', 'elephants', 'lions', 'let', 'alone', 'birds', 'show', 'up', 'location', 'when', 'flood', 'out', 'be', 'mere', 'local', 'event', 'Exactly', 'what', 'are', 'fleeing', 's', 'zoo', 'very', 'flimsy', 'cages', 'nearby', 'know', 'nothing', 'course', 'smooth', 'things', 'modern', 'audiences', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'made', 'trifle', 'uncomfortable', 'wanton', 'death', 'destruction', 'original', 'story', 'Steve', 'Oedekerk', 'script', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'THIS', 'flood', 'act', 'wrath', 'part', 'God', 'even', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'tale', 'commitment', 'love', 'there', 'nothing', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reduce', 'sheer', 'dreck', 'utter', 'pablum', 'Directed', 'Tim', 'Shadyac', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'said', 'be', 'most', 'expensive', 'comedy', 'ever', 'made', 'Well', 'expense', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'all', 'CGI', 'effects', 'animal-control', 'needed', 'make', 'concept', 'come', 'life', 'screen', 'comedy', 'other', 'hand', 'trifle', 'more', 'difficult', 'discern', 'Even', 'movie', 'requisite', 'dog-poop', 'joke', 'way', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'decidedly', 'more', 'tame', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'often', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'jokes', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'happened', 'be', 'funny', 'Instead', 'humor', 'however', 're', 'given', 'God', 'who', 'smugly', 'delivers', 'sappy', 'little', 'homilies', 'belief', 'faith', 'terms', 'simpering', 'blithe', 'make', 'average', 'Sunday', 'School', 'lesson', 'seem', 'edgy', 'dark', 'comparison.Carell', 'what', 'can', 'poorly', 'written', 'part', 'Freeman', 'arch', 'condescension', 'wears', 'thin', 'very', 'early', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'one', 'Baxter', 'Congressional', 'aides', 'trick', 'wretched', 'Monster-in-law', 'hijacking', 'movie', 'best', 'lines', 'one', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'been', 'assigned', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Noah', 'means', 'garnering', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'screen.Here', 'hoping', 'God', 'up', 'new', 'better', 'material', 'least', 'better', 'ghost-writer', 'next', 'time', 'around']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[3, 3]","The idea of God appearing on Earth and beginning to give direct orders to a congressman (or any other politician) is just too much to resist, but ""Evan Almighty"" takes a different tact than one might expect for a comedy.  Instead of it being a conniving little weasel who abruptly finds himself getting marching orders from above, it's an honest and well-meaning congressmen, freshly elected and eager to make a difference, and glad for the helping hand even when everybody around him thinks he's gone nuts.  Steve Carrel does a great job as Congressman Evan Baxter; it's John Goodman who skillfully steps into the 'shady, conniving weasel' (no offence to the four-legged variety of weasels) as a Washington career politician who provides the foil for Evan; and Morgan Freeman is simply brilliant as the Big Guy Himself.It's the way the role of God is handled that more than anything distinguishes the movie.  Certainly not a cranky fire-and-brimstone deity here, God is portrayed by Freeman as witty and playful, with a quiet but powerful drive underneath.  His faith in the people of Earth is evidenced by his reliance on Evan to steadfastly build an Ark as ordered despite continued (and usually highly humorous) setbacks; the fact that He'd still be so bright-eyed optimistic about humanity in spite of the current state of the world is an unexpected and interesting angle to take.There are a few times when ""Evan Almighty"" misses opportunities for more comedic value (it's funny but generally not hilarious), but that's all made up for by all the right notes it hits.  Boasting a great array of creatures (to file up and board the ark of course) to give the movie extra punch for us animal lovers, this is an all-round winner, and a unique entry in moviedom.

I found myself gently nodding to all Amazon wrote about this film, so go back and read what they wrote for more details.  Here's my simple take on the film.It's generally funny, but some jokes are strained and/or too contrived. The acting is wonderful by all involved. The script is fairly pedestrian and predictable, but the director moves things along at a nice pace. The effects are good, but as Amazon noted, the huge flood sequence would have killed hundreds if not thousands, but everyone laughs it off for the message of protecting the environment. That somehow seems a bit warped in my view.This film got rotten reviews by mainstream critics, but I found that it all went down rather easily. I'm not one for ""message films"" as I really don't like being preached to by Hollywood which is the capital of hypocrisy (next to Washington, D.C.), but I always like films in which people attempt to be better people, heed a call from God, or promote being kind to one another. In addition, I nearly always like or have something good to say about a family friendly film such as this.I expected this film to be rather awful letdown and delayed seeing it, but it was much more enjoyable than I expected and after a very slow start at the box-office, it did become a hit in the end.

Carell's comedy loosely mimics the outrageous overacting style of Jim Carrey, and it's never more apparent than in the outtakes on ""Almighty"".""The Ark-itects of Noah's Ark"" gives us an in-depth look at how the enormous ark is actually built in full-scale for the film. The designers wanted it to be simple, since it has to retain the idea that one man and his sons built the entire thing in a relatively short period of time.""Becoming Noah"" shows Academy Award-winning makeup artist David Anderson discuss the 4-6 hour process Carell had to go through every day once he hit his ""transformations"". Often starting at 2 a.m. and finishing shooting 12 hours later, Carell had 19 wigs and 17 different beards showing various stages of his becoming biblical.Having the most animals on set in any film in show business history, ""Animals On Set"" introduces a few of the hundreds of animals that animal trainer Mark Forbes had to coordinate and take care of. While it looks like a lot of fun, most of the animals tend to do their own thing, and you must make absolutely sure that the lions don't mingle with the sheep. The next feature, ""Steve Carell Unscripted"" is essentially little more than a few additional outtakes.Another feature explains how director Tom Shadyac thought it would be hypocritical to make a film about appreciating and preserving the earth while destroying it to film a movie. Trying to film a ""green"" movie, he bought hundreds of bicycles for the cast and crew so they could get around the set without using gas powered vehicles. He also donated all of the set pieces and wood from the ark to charities that build houses for the homeless.The disc also includes a featurette on the visual effects, with Bill George, the visual effects supervisor from the Industrial Light and Magic. With interactive Ark animal games for children (reminiscent of Disney's kid-friendly Platinum releases), Evan Almighty has quite a few special features for a single disc set. But all the featurettes in the world can't save the film from being sadly joke-free, and since the movie didn't have nearly the impact or critical success that the filmmakers had hoped for, (I blame it on the restrictive PG rating) it's unlikely that we'll see a future ""double-dip"" release of the title.- Mike Massie",3,Evan Almighty DVD Review,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,2841,"['DVD', 'Special', 'FeaturesSteve', 'Carell', 'segments', 'special', 'features', 'great', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'involvement', 'had', 'making', 'DVD', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'one', 'lengthier', 'features', 'extended', 'sequences', 'Evan', 'driving', 'H2', 'impress', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'selecting', 'toilet', 'new', 'house', 'extensive', 'daily', 'morning', 'personal', 'ablutions', 'few', 'have', 'moments', 'hilarity', 'were', 'rightfully', 'cut', 'film.Outtakes', 'are', 'always', 'lot', 'fun', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'exceptions', 'Carell', 'comedy', 'loosely', 'outrageous', 'overacting', 'style', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'never', 'more', 'apparent', 'outtakes', 'Almighty', 'Ark-itects', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'in-depth', 'look', 'how', 'enormous', 'ark', 'actually', 'built', 'full-scale', 'film', 'designers', 'wanted', 'be', 'simple', 'retain', 'idea', 'one', 'man', 'sons', 'built', 'entire', 'thing', 'relatively', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'Becoming', 'Noah', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'makeup', 'artist', 'David', 'Anderson', '4-6', 'hour', 'process', 'Carell', 'had', 'go', 'day', 'hit', 'transformations', 'Often', 'starting', '2', 'a.m.', 'finishing', 'shooting', '12', 'hours', 'later', 'Carell', 'had', '19', 'wigs', '17', 'different', 'beards', 'showing', 'various', 'stages', 'becoming', 'biblical.Having', 'most', 'animals', 'set', 'film', 'show', 'business', 'history', 'Animals', 'Set', 'few', 'hundreds', 'animals', 'animal', 'trainer', 'Mark', 'Forbes', 'had', 'coordinate', 'take', 'care', 'lot', 'fun', 'most', 'animals', 'tend', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'must', 'make', 'absolutely', 'sure', 'lions', 'do', ""n't"", 'mingle', 'sheep', 'next', 'feature', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Unscripted', 'essentially', 'little', 'more', 'few', 'additional', 'outtakes.Another', 'feature', 'how', 'director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'hypocritical', 'make', 'film', 'appreciating', 'preserving', 'earth', 'destroying', 'film', 'movie', 'Trying', 'film', 'green', 'movie', 'bought', 'hundreds', 'bicycles', 'cast', 'crew', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'set', 'using', 'gas', 'powered', 'vehicles', 'also', 'donated', 'set', 'pieces', 'wood', 'ark', 'charities', 'build', 'houses', 'homeless.The', 'disc', 'also', 'featurette', 'visual', 'effects', 'Bill', 'George', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervisor', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'interactive', 'Ark', 'animal', 'games', 'children', 'reminiscent', 'Disney', 'kid-friendly', 'Platinum', 'releases', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'quite', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'single', 'disc', 'set', 'featurettes', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'being', 'sadly', 'joke-free', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'impact', 'critical', 'success', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'hoped', 'blame', 'restrictive', 'PG', 'rating', 'unlikely', ""'ll"", 'see', 'future', 'double-dip', 'release', 'title.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

1095703,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B000UNYK4E,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","After the great success that was Bruce Almighty in 2003 it was announced that a script for a second movie had been done and they were negotiating with Jim Carrey to once again play the main character. It was then announced that Carrey wouldn't be part of the sequel and latter that it was still going to be made. I thought,without Carrey they wouldn't do anything good, that they would screw up and that they`re just in for the money. The early negative reviews did little to give any hope for the movie, even the commercial didn't make me want to go see it. But I changed my mind when I finally watched it and gave it a chance. I won`t say its better or even close to be as great as the original was but i still had a great time and liked it. ""Evan Almighty"" is better than most people would think and critics say it is, its funny,charming and the story is clever and entertaining that you can forget its a sequel and enjoy it.In fact, its not much of a sequel really as there are really few things in common with Bruce Almighty. God for one is the same, Morgan Freeman plays him(and does I think maybe a better job than in the first one)and Steve Carrel(who played Evan Baxter Buffalo news anchor and a hilarious part)played in the first movie and wounds up being the main character in this one. Actually what links the two movies together is God mostly but there is also Evan Baxter as he was in the first movie and reprises his role which is now the primary character. Yet this one is very different and is on its own, its not overly hilarious but it does manage to get a laugh from time to time and is dramatic in latter parts of the film(much like Bruce Almighty). All that to prove its not a cheap sequel,its has its own story and all.Evan Baxter was previously a news anchor as seen in Bruce Almighty and has changed career since(probably due to what happened in the first)and is a recently elected congress man, which allows him to move with his family in Virginia. He appears to be a man with many possessions, good status and with his new job everything seems fine.You see he was elected in the ""Change The World"" campaign, God in the vein of the campaign has chosen Evan to create him an ark. Evan sees all kinds of things with 6:14 on it(his alarm clock for instance wakes him at 6:14 each day), and comes to the realization that it is related to Genesis 6:14 from the bible of course which says ""Build me an ark"" and to him it makes no sense,for the moment. Then it picks up from there as God previously sent him wood and Evan wondering from who it came form met God who announced his projects for him.His words were ""You want to change the world, you have the occasion here"" or something like that(anyway you get the picture), build an ark to save animals from the water he is about to unleash on September 22. Evan doesn't take it too seriously and so God gives him the Noah look, with the clothes, hair and beard!That turns out to be a problem,and the animals that are following him are not too helpful either, add to that nobody believes a thing he says(about the date and all). If I would tell you if something does happen,that would pretty much ruin the movie for those who wants to see it. I think I say enough in this paragraph. Of course he passes for the weird guy disguised as Noah and who seems to believe some strange things.Its a movie that fits everyone and that entire families can enjoy and have a good time together. ""Evan Almighty"" is better than what some famous critics and magazine have said about it and is entertaining enough to deserve at least a rental. Its hard to predict you will like it, but its good and it has a good story and is a different kind of movie which you may find great. It is suitable for everyone and it has nothing bad in it,no drugs,alcohol or anything. Its also based on the bible, that might be a plus depending of what you believe or don`t,the entire story is based on what Noah did and God but it does not stick to it t, just the basic story and it evolves further to deliver a good message. That message is ""You can change the world by doing little things"". I would recommend it, especially for a family. I hesitated and could have given it a 3 and a half star, it ranges closely to that but my definitive rating is four stars, a very good comedy for the whole family, 4/5.",4,Fun film for the whole family,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,4339,"['great', 'success', 'was', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', '2003', 'was', 'announced', 'script', 'second', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'were', 'negotiating', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'once', 'again', 'play', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'then', 'announced', 'Carrey', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'part', 'sequel', 'latter', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'thought', 'Carrey', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'good', 'would', 'screw', 'up', 're', 'just', 'money', 'early', 'negative', 'reviews', 'did', 'little', 'give', 'hope', 'movie', 'even', 'commercial', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'changed', 'mind', 'when', 'finally', 'watched', 'gave', 'chance', 'won', 't', 'say', 'better', 'even', 'close', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'original', 'was', 'i', 'still', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'liked', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'better', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'critics', 'say', 'funny', 'charming', 'story', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'can', 'forget', 'sequel', 'enjoy', 'it.In', 'fact', 'not', 'much', 'sequel', 'really', 'are', 'really', 'few', 'things', 'common', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'God', 'one', 'same', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'think', 'maybe', 'better', 'job', 'first', 'one', 'Steve', 'Carrel', 'who', 'played', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'Buffalo', 'news', 'anchor', 'hilarious', 'part', 'played', 'first', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'main', 'character', 'one', 'Actually', 'what', 'two', 'movies', 'together', 'God', 'mostly', 'also', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'now', 'primary', 'character', 'one', 'very', 'different', 'own', 'not', 'overly', 'hilarious', 'manage', 'get', 'laugh', 'time', 'time', 'dramatic', 'latter', 'parts', 'film', 'much', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'prove', 'not', 'cheap', 'sequel', 'own', 'story', 'all.Evan', 'Baxter', 'was', 'previously', 'news', 'anchor', 'seen', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'changed', 'career', 'probably', 'due', 'what', 'happened', 'first', 'recently', 'elected', 'congress', 'man', 'move', 'family', 'Virginia', 'be', 'man', 'many', 'possessions', 'good', 'status', 'new', 'job', 'everything', 'fine.You', 'see', 'was', 'elected', 'Change', 'World', 'campaign', 'God', 'vein', 'campaign', 'chosen', 'Evan', 'create', 'ark', 'Evan', 'kinds', 'things', '6:14', 'alarm', 'clock', 'instance', 'wakes', '6:14', 'day', 'realization', 'related', 'Genesis', '6:14', 'bible', 'course', 'Build', 'ark', 'sense', 'moment', 'Then', 'up', 'there', 'God', 'previously', 'sent', 'wood', 'Evan', 'wondering', 'who', 'came', 'form', 'met', 'God', 'who', 'announced', 'projects', 'him.His', 'words', 'were', 'want', 'change', 'world', 'have', 'occasion', 'here', 'something', 'anyway', 'get', 'picture', 'build', 'ark', 'save', 'animals', 'water', 'unleash', 'September', '22', 'Evan', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'so', 'God', 'Noah', 'look', 'clothes', 'hair', 'beard', 'out', 'be', 'problem', 'animals', 'are', 'following', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'helpful', 'add', 'nobody', 'thing', 'date', 'would', 'tell', 'something', 'happen', 'would', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruin', 'movie', 'who', 'see', 'think', 'say', 'enough', 'paragraph', 'course', 'weird', 'guy', 'disguised', 'Noah', 'who', 'believe', 'strange', 'things.Its', 'movie', 'everyone', 'entire', 'families', 'can', 'enjoy', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'together', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'better', 'what', 'famous', 'critics', 'magazine', 'have', 'said', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'deserve', 'least', 'rental', 'hard', 'predict', 'will', 'like', 'good', 'good', 'story', 'different', 'kind', 'movie', 'may', 'find', 'great', 'suitable', 'everyone', 'nothing', 'bad', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'anything', 'also', 'based', 'bible', 'might', 'be', 'plus', 'depending', 'what', 'believe', 'don', 't', 'entire', 'story', 'based', 'what', 'Noah', 'did', 'God', 'not', 'stick', 't', 'just', 'basic', 'story', 'further', 'deliver', 'good', 'message', 'message', 'can', 'change', 'world', 'doing', 'little', 'things', 'would', 'recommend', 'especially', 'family', 'hesitated', 'could', 'have', 'given', '3', 'half', 'star', 'closely', 'definitive', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'very', 'good', 'comedy', 'whole', 'family', '4/5']",N/A

You see Steve as Evan really struggling as he slowly morphs into a modern day Noah. But once he is reconciled with his family the focus shifts away from him too much. I would have also liked to have seen Morgan Freeman used a bit more.

Same concept, same jokes, same old, right?!  Thankfully, this version went in a bit of a different direction and was all the better for it.The film follows news-caster Evan (from the first film, played by Steve Carell) as he leaves the newsroom behind and branches out into politics.  Of course, just when it seems he has it made, he gets a little visit from God (once again personified brilliantly by Morgan Freeman).  God tells Evan that he must build an Ark (ala Noah), as ""a flood is coming"".  At first, Evan tries desperately to ignore or even outright thwart the ""hand of God"", but quickly learns that such an attitude is impossible.  Thus, the Ark begins to be built and hilarity ensues.Yet, despite the great sight sags and situational humor that Carell (of ""The Office"" fame) nails so perfectly, is this film really a comedy?  I would have to say an emphatic ""no"".  The only actual jokes offered are commentary from Wanda Sykes, and those get old real fast.  Instead, the directors/producers use a combination of those sight gags and crazy situations to fashion a family film with a great message and a compelling storyline.  Basically, while it may not have you laughing out loud, you will find yourself chuckling throughout, then actually caring about what happens to the characters at the end.Going in that more family-oriented direction saved this film from becoming a re-tread of the first effort.  The writers knew that only Carrey could have nailed the physical comedy and ""in-your-face"" jokes of ""Bruce Almighty"", so they toned it down a bit for the much more understated (yet still funny in its own way) Carell.This film is perfectly safe to watch with your children and enjoy with the entire family.
