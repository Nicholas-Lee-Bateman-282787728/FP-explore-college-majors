833819,A374OO1EAUZASC,B0002HS74C,2201,"[4, 9]","I am pretty obsessed with Buffy and Angel, and have been since way back.  However, I missed most of Angel season 4 when it was broadcast in 2002-2003.  I ordered this to help complete my collection of the series, and that's about all it will do.The plot of season 4 had an interesting concept, but upon watching it end-to-end it just wasn't put together well.  I had heard that the writers had to scramble to incorporate Charisma Carpenter's pregnancy into the story, and if that's true, the results were pretty disastrous.  The first 6 episodes are entertaining, mostly stand-alone episodes which devote only a small amount of time to the season-long arc.  The introduction of Gwen Raiden was particularly interesting, since they went to a lot of trouble to tell her backstory...but then they just let her character fizzle, showing her only three times the entire season and then leaving her resolution up in the air.  Gunn & Wesley fought alot over Fred, but Wesley was semi-secretly banging Lilah the whole time (the sex scenes were quite fun, but not all the drama surrounding them.)  The Angelus mini-arc felt really forced and David Boreanaz didn't play the character as well as he did in Buffy season 2.  This year's Angelus just wasn't as psychotic as he once was.  The introduction of Faith for a few episodes was the saving grace for the mid-season (bringing back Faith is always a good thing.)  Another dropped-ball was Connor's attraction to her...it just sort of fizzled.  Allyson Hannigan came over for one ep and played Willow, and only served to showcase just how much the show had veered from its roots.  The whole Jasmine arc felt really drawn-out, like it could have been resolved in 1 or 2 episodes instead of the 4-5 that it took.  I understand the writers were trying to pursue the whole ""fate-versus-free will"" concept by explaining that everything that had happened was set into motion by Jasmine, but it really didn't work out that well.Character development was nearly zero in season 4.  Cordelia wasn't really there (except for the first few eps as a higher being) because her body was comandeered by Jasmine.  Wes, for all his brooding and S&M;, was pretty much the same person at the end of the season as he was when it began.  Fred developed a little into a more complex character, but then always reverted to her mousy braniac ways.  The highlight of the season for Fred was when she reverted to her 17 year old personna and kept asking for weed.  Gunn killed a man for Fred so she broke up with him...WTF?  If one of my lovers killed somebody there'd be NO WAY I'd dump his ass for fear if nothing else.  Besides that, Gunn's only change was a bit more self-confidence.  Lorne was just comic relief.  Connor continued to be annoying, only to get psycho towards the end.  And Angel didn't change hardly at all.The last episode of the season did a lot to redeem it (tied together some of the loose ends.)  It also got rid of psycho Connor (thank the Lord) and wiped the memory of him from their minds.  If that's not a sure-fire sign of a bad season (wiping its memory away from your characters) then I don't know what is.  It set up season 5 pretty well...where the gang takes over Wolfram & Hart and hilarity ensues.  Say what you will about season 5, I thought it tied the whole series together pretty damned well even if there were alot of throw-away episodes.Anyways, I am glad I bought the DVD so that one day soon I'll have a complete collection, but I won't watch it on continuous play like I did with some of the other sets.",3,The low-point of the series,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,3563,"['am', 'pretty', 'obsessed', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'back', 'However', 'missed', 'most', 'Angel', 'season', '4', 'when', 'was', 'broadcast', '2002-2003', 'ordered', 'help', 'complete', 'collection', 'series', 'will', 'do.The', 'plot', 'season', '4', 'had', 'interesting', 'concept', 'watching', 'end-to-end', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'well', 'had', 'heard', 'writers', 'had', 'scramble', 'incorporate', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'pregnancy', 'story', 'true', 'results', 'were', 'pretty', 'disastrous', 'first', '6', 'episodes', 'are', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'devote', 'only', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'season-long', 'arc', 'introduction', 'Gwen', 'Raiden', 'was', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'went', 'lot', 'trouble', 'tell', 'backstory', 'then', 'just', 'let', 'character', 'fizzle', 'showing', 'only', 'three', 'times', 'entire', 'season', 'then', 'leaving', 'resolution', 'up', 'air', 'Gunn', 'Wesley', 'fought', 'alot', 'Fred', 'Wesley', 'was', 'semi-secretly', 'banging', 'Lilah', 'whole', 'time', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'quite', 'fun', 'not', 'drama', 'surrounding', 'Angelus', 'mini-arc', 'felt', 'really', 'forced', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Buffy', 'season', '2', 'year', 'Angelus', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'psychotic', 'once', 'was', 'introduction', 'Faith', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'saving', 'grace', 'mid-season', 'bringing', 'back', 'Faith', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'dropped-ball', 'was', 'Connor', 'attraction', 'just', 'sort', 'fizzled', 'Allyson', 'Hannigan', 'came', 'one', 'ep', 'played', 'Willow', 'only', 'served', 'showcase', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'show', 'had', 'veered', 'roots', 'whole', 'Jasmine', 'arc', 'felt', 'really', 'drawn-out', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', '1', '2', 'episodes', 'instead', '4-5', 'took', 'understand', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'pursue', 'whole', 'fate-versus-free', 'will', 'concept', 'explaining', 'everything', 'had', 'happened', 'was', 'set', 'motion', 'Jasmine', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'well.Character', 'development', 'was', 'nearly', 'zero', 'season', '4', 'Cordelia', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'first', 'few', 'eps', 'higher', 'being', 'body', 'was', 'comandeered', 'Jasmine', 'Wes', 'brooding', 'S', 'M', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'person', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'when', 'began', 'Fred', 'developed', 'little', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'then', 'always', 'reverted', 'mousy', 'braniac', 'ways', 'highlight', 'season', 'Fred', 'was', 'when', 'reverted', '17', 'year', 'old', 'personna', 'kept', 'asking', 'weed', 'Gunn', 'killed', 'man', 'Fred', 'broke', 'up', 'WTF', 'one', 'lovers', 'killed', 'somebody', ""'d"", 'be', 'NO', 'WAY', ""'d"", 'dump', 'ass', 'fear', 'nothing', 'else', 'Gunn', 'only', 'change', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'self-confidence', 'Lorne', 'was', 'just', 'comic', 'relief', 'Connor', 'continued', 'be', 'annoying', 'only', 'get', 'psycho', 'towards', 'end', 'Angel', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'hardly', 'all.The', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'did', 'lot', 'redeem', 'tied', 'together', 'loose', 'ends', 'also', 'got', 'rid', 'psycho', 'Connor', 'thank', 'Lord', 'wiped', 'memory', 'minds', 'not', 'sure-fire', 'sign', 'bad', 'season', 'wiping', 'memory', 'away', 'characters', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'set', 'up', 'season', '5', 'pretty', 'well', 'where', 'gang', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'season', '5', 'thought', 'tied', 'whole', 'series', 'together', 'pretty', 'damned', 'well', 'even', 'were', 'alot', 'throw-away', 'episodes.Anyways', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', 'one', 'day', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'have', 'complete', 'collection', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'continuous', 'play', 'did', 'other', 'sets']",N/A
833820,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0002HS74C,A. Burchfield,"[28, 95]","I think that at the time I read that in order to keep Angel on the air the producers had to trim expenses- it really shows.The season starts with Angel having been on the seafloor trapped in Connor's steel box for months, Cordelia missing- leaving Fred & Gunn to run the detective agency. From there the show is one long mostly depressing list of episodes with almost no daylight in any of them ( that used to be used even with Vampire characters).It looks to me like the writers/producers even thought that the series would end with their appocalyptic storyline brought on by Cordelia's return and subsequent pregnancy (Charisma Carpenter really was pregnant). It gradually developed that the events of the first three years from Cordelia gaining Doyle's powers to Connor's birth from Vampire parents and Cordelia's ascension were all part of a super demon's plan to be born into this world and rule it.I liked the part where ""Skip"", that demon guy who befriended Cordelia during 3rd season, got what he had coming to him. I thought that the subplot of the woman with the electrically charged body served no purpose (she did make Angel's heart beat once and her childhood had most of the few daylight scenes)except for Gunn to cheat on Fred with her. The character had no part in the battle to save LA, wasn't needed at all really.Most of the good in this set comes from the Faith/Willow episodes. Eliza Dushku does a really good job of a redeemed Faith going out to save Angel from his Angelus self over the course of those few episodes. I really liked her spur of the moment prison break with Wes. Alison Hannigan didn't have much of a role that I recall but her Willow portrayal was good as well.",2,Easily the most depressing of the 5 seasons,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,1700,"['think', 'time', 'read', 'order', 'keep', 'Angel', 'air', 'producers', 'had', 'trim', 'expenses-', 'really', 'season', 'starts', 'Angel', 'having', 'been', 'seafloor', 'trapped', 'Connor', 'steel', 'box', 'months', 'Cordelia', 'missing-', 'leaving', 'Fred', 'Gunn', 'run', 'detective', 'agency', 'show', 'one', 'long', 'mostly', 'depressing', 'list', 'episodes', 'almost', 'daylight', 'used', 'be', 'used', 'even', 'Vampire', 'characters', '.It', 'writers/producers', 'even', 'thought', 'series', 'would', 'end', 'appocalyptic', 'storyline', 'brought', 'Cordelia', 'return', 'subsequent', 'pregnancy', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'really', 'was', 'pregnant', 'gradually', 'developed', 'events', 'first', 'three', 'years', 'Cordelia', 'gaining', 'Doyle', 'powers', 'Connor', 'birth', 'Vampire', 'parents', 'Cordelia', 'ascension', 'were', 'part', 'super', 'demon', 'plan', 'be', 'born', 'world', 'rule', 'it.I', 'liked', 'part', 'where', 'Skip', 'demon', 'guy', 'who', 'befriended', 'Cordelia', '3rd', 'season', 'got', 'what', 'had', 'coming', 'thought', 'subplot', 'woman', 'electrically', 'charged', 'body', 'served', 'purpose', 'did', 'make', 'Angel', 'heart', 'beat', 'once', 'childhood', 'had', 'most', 'few', 'daylight', 'scenes', 'Gunn', 'cheat', 'Fred', 'character', 'had', 'part', 'battle', 'save', 'LA', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'really.Most', 'good', 'set', 'Faith/Willow', 'episodes', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'redeemed', 'Faith', 'going', 'save', 'Angel', 'Angelus', 'self', 'course', 'few', 'episodes', 'really', 'liked', 'spur', 'moment', 'prison', 'break', 'Wes', 'Alison', 'Hannigan', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'role', 'recall', 'Willow', 'portrayal', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well']",N/A

833824,A3MA7SDWD1HJE5,B0002HS74C,Amazon Customer,"[4, 13]","I got into Angel as a Buffy fan, I imagine that's true of most people. I watched seasons 1-3 and liked them well enough to buy and start season 4.The problem is, season 4 is terrible. Its all about Connor and Angel, probably the 2 weakest characters and definately the weakest relationship in either series. Darla is gone. Cordelia is gone. Lorne and Gunn play increased rolls, badly. Wesley is alienated from the others, minimizing the strongest character on the show. Every single episode for an entire season is just Angel and Connor fighting, and everyone else being pissed at Wesley. I know that sounds impossible, but its trueThe whole thing, from start to finish, is a disaster. The only reason I finished it, and I mean ONLY, was that my brother made it through and said season 5 was a million times better, which is is. Even with that encouragement it took me several months to make it through this set. By comparison, I finished seasons 1-3 in less than a month, combinedHonestly, unless you're the biggest Angel fan around, there is absolutely no reason to watch season 4 of this show. Its like the worst episode of any other season, stretched out to be a whole season long. If I had not already invested 10 seasons worth of watching, between Buffy and Angel, and if I hadn't foolishly bought Season 4 before I realized how terrible it was, I never would have finished itThis season alone is enough reason to stay away from the entire series. Unlike Buffy, where seasons 2-4 are the best and the first half of 5 is ok, then the 2nd half of 6 and all of 7 are terrible, with Angel, the first season is rocky, 2 and 3 are ok, 4 is beyond bad, and 5 is great. And its just not worth wading through all that to get to the great part at the end. With Buffy you get the good right up front and that's easier to justify, but I would honestly reccomend that no one even bother with the entire series Angel, because season 4 is so incredibly awful.Joss basically admits it himself because season 5 has absolutely no Connor in it, and next to no Lorne in it. Plus they bring Spike and throw out the idea that Angel can't be happy or he turns evil, revamp Fred's character, bring back the best bad guy the show ever had, etcAll the is Joss's way of saying ""yeah, i know it was terrible, please forgive me"" about the previous season. He did the exact same thing in Buffy, trying to bribe you into forgetting about season 6 by completely changing everything in season 7, bringing Giles and Faith back, etc. In both cases it was too little, too lateAnyway, I know this is a little disjointed as reviews go, but the bottom line is that you should avoid this at absolutely all costs. If you just absolutely love Angel, skip this season and go straight to season 5. I promise you it will hardly even matter, there's next to no reference to the events of season 4 during season 5 anyway",1,"This is the worst season of any show I've ever managed to finish, and that's not an exaggeration",1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,2879,"['got', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'imagine', 'true', 'most', 'people', 'watched', 'seasons', '1-3', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'buy', 'start', 'season', '4.The', 'problem', 'season', '4', 'terrible', 'Connor', 'Angel', 'probably', '2', 'weakest', 'characters', 'definately', 'weakest', 'relationship', 'series', 'Darla', 'gone', 'Cordelia', 'gone', 'Lorne', 'Gunn', 'play', 'increased', 'rolls', 'badly', 'Wesley', 'alienated', 'others', 'minimizing', 'strongest', 'character', 'show', 'single', 'episode', 'entire', 'season', 'just', 'Angel', 'Connor', 'fighting', 'everyone', 'else', 'being', 'pissed', 'Wesley', 'know', 'impossible', 'trueThe', 'whole', 'thing', 'start', 'finish', 'disaster', 'only', 'reason', 'finished', 'mean', 'ONLY', 'was', 'brother', 'made', 'said', 'season', '5', 'was', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'Even', 'encouragement', 'took', 'several', 'months', 'make', 'set', 'comparison', 'finished', 'seasons', '1-3', 'less', 'month', 'combinedHonestly', ""'re"", 'biggest', 'Angel', 'fan', 'around', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'watch', 'season', '4', 'show', 'worst', 'episode', 'other', 'season', 'stretched', 'out', 'be', 'whole', 'season', 'long', 'had', 'not', 'already', 'invested', '10', 'seasons', 'watching', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'had', ""n't"", 'foolishly', 'bought', 'Season', '4', 'realized', 'how', 'terrible', 'was', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'finished', 'itThis', 'season', 'alone', 'enough', 'reason', 'stay', 'away', 'entire', 'series', 'Buffy', 'where', 'seasons', '2-4', 'are', 'best', 'first', 'half', '5', 'ok', 'then', '2nd', 'half', '6', '7', 'are', 'terrible', 'Angel', 'first', 'season', 'rocky', '2', '3', 'are', 'ok', '4', 'bad', '5', 'great', 'just', 'not', 'worth', 'wading', 'get', 'great', 'part', 'end', 'Buffy', 'get', 'good', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'easier', 'justify', 'would', 'honestly', 'reccomend', 'one', 'even', 'bother', 'entire', 'series', 'Angel', 'season', '4', 'so', 'incredibly', 'basically', 'season', '5', 'absolutely', 'Connor', 'next', 'Lorne', 'bring', 'Spike', 'throw', 'out', 'idea', 'Angel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'evil', 'revamp', 'Fred', 'character', 'bring', 'back', 'best', 'bad', 'guy', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'Joss', 'way', 'saying', 'yeah', 'i', 'know', 'was', 'terrible', 'please', 'forgive', 'previous', 'season', 'did', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'Buffy', 'trying', 'bribe', 'forgetting', 'season', '6', 'completely', 'changing', 'everything', 'season', '7', 'bringing', 'Giles', 'Faith', 'back', 'etc', 'cases', 'was', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'lateAnyway', 'know', 'little', 'disjointed', 'reviews', 'go', 'bottom', 'line', 'should', 'avoid', 'absolutely', 'costs', 'just', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Angel', 'skip', 'season', 'go', 'straight', 'season', '5', 'promise', 'will', 'hardly', 'even', 'matter', 'next', 'reference', 'events', 'season', '4', 'season', '5', 'anyway']",N/A
833825,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0002HS74C,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[30, 35]","I would like to preface this review by saying that the very first episode of Angel that I ever saw was Release, an episode from the middle of this season.  When I saw it, I recognized that this was definitely an amazing show, for Release is one of my very favorite episodes, however I had almost no idea what was going on.  I only knew four characters; Angel (David Boreanaz), or maybe I should say Angelus, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Densiof), Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpentar), who confused me by being evil, and Faith (Eliza Dushku), who confused me by being good.  Also, I thought that this was the second part of a three part episode arc involving Angelus, Angel's evil alter-ego.  Man, was I wrong.  This season's overall arc rivals the arcs used on shows like 24 and Alias; in order to fully understand and appreciate this season, one has to see every episode as well as most of the episodes from previous seasons.Anyway, the season picks up sort of where we left off last year; Angel is at the bottom of the Pacific, where he was left by his son Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) and vampire hunter Justine Cooper (Laurel Holloman).  Cordelia is on the higher plane of existence, Wes has been exiled from the group and is in an unhealthy relationship with Wolfram and Hart lawyer Lilah Morgan (Stephanie Romanov), Lorne (Andy Hallet) is performing in Vegas, and for the three month interim, Gunn (J. August Richards) and Fred (Amy Acker) have been searching for their two missing friends while trying to run Angel Investigations with Connor.  For the past few months, Wes has been holding Justine hostage and is using her to find Angel.  After Wes rescues Angel, the vamp kicks Connor out of the hotel and begins a search for his lost love Cordelia.  The trio of Angel, Gunn, and Fred also start asking Wes for help more and more often.  Over the summer it seems that the nerdy ex-Watcher has turned into a suave, dark, 007ish vampire hunter.  Then, after a trip to Vegas to clear their heads and help rescue Lorne, the group returns to the Hyperion Hotel to discover Cordelia, who has no memory of her life.  Lorne ""reads"" her and is horrified to see unspeakable evil in her future.  Once she gets her memory back, things begin to go to Hell in L.A.  Plagues of rats and snakes start occurring all over the city, and then an enormous demon made of solid rock emerges from the Earth... in the exact spot where Darla (Julie Benz) staked herself in order to bring Connor into the world.  The Beast (Vladimir Kulich), as the gang calls it, causes the sky to rain fire, the performs a ritual that blocks out the sun.  Things get a lot worse when the Angel Team has Angel's soul extracted in order to get information from the evil Angelus, only to learn that the Beast is taking orders from something worse.  Soon, Angel's soul is stolen and Angelus escapes and runs rampant through L.A.  Finally, we meet the Beastmaster, Jasmine (Gina Torres who has previously worked with Joss Whedon on Firefly), a higher being whose evil master plan is... world peace?This year, the Angel gang faced numerous changes; Wes is now a dark, tortured, fighter, Gunn and Fred's relationship is tested to the limits, Cordy may no longer be who she used to be, Faith is now a force for good, and the L.A. branch of Wolfram and Hart is completely obliterated!  The group also faces two of the most morally ambiguous challenges ever: do human sacrifices and the loss of free will justify world peace, and the other one stems from one of the show's greatest twists to date.As I said earlier, this season is the most arc-heavy of the entire series (although year 3 is pretty intense, and year 5's arc is ingeniously the lack of an arc, but I'll get into that in the Season 5 review), and for the most part, it worked really well.  Things did kind of slow down during a few episodes (in my opinion at least) such as the first Angelus episode and the first couple Jasmine episodes.  However these minor problems can easily be overlooked due to the amazing overall story and the amazing individual episodes.The acting is as good as ever; in fact I think that these actors just keep getting better.  I guess the only exception is Kartheiser.  He is kind of uneven; he will do very well in one episode, and then in the next one, his performance will be a little dry.  Speaking of Connor, while I never truly despised him the way many fans did this season, I will admit that his constant snarl and bad attitude did get a little tiresome.  The regulars weren't the only good performers.  The guest stars were superb in their various roles, from Dushku's Faith to Torres' Jasmine, and from Kulich's Beast to Alyson Hannigan's Willow, who made an appearance in the episode Orpheus.  Speaking of Faith, I still can't believe that she turned down a Faith spin-off show to do Tru Calling.  Okay, I enjoy that show, but I believe that a Faith-based show led by Joss would have been amazing.  Finally, there was Alexa Davalos, who played Gwen Raiden, a theif with an, um, electric personality.  I still can't believe that Davalos didn't get used more.  She definitely would have been a welcome addition to the team for Season 5 (along with James Marsters' Spike of course).  Oh, and speaking of regulars, Andy Hallet finally made the opening credits after 2 and a half seasons as a guest star!  Personally, I think that Hallet has gotten the short end of the stick in a lot of instances, such as being left off the DVD covers, but oh well.One of the best things about this season was that Buffy cross-overs were allowed to happen again, despite the fact that BtVS was on UPN while this was on The WB, and the writers really made the best possible use of them.  We were treated to overlapping stories (Faith and Willow, Angel taking the amulet to Sunnydale) as well as some references (Wesley talking about how the Watcher's Council no longer exists).  I guess that the networks realized that this year was the last season of Buffy, so they let them have a few final crossovers.The special effects and make-up this year probably reached their peak greatness (the show's budget was cut after this year).  The Beast, the demons, and the portals all looked great.This is, in my opinion, the best season so far (my favorite is Season 5, though).  This season had great stories, great character development, and of course, great fights.  The first fight with the Beast, Angel, Gunn, Wes, and Lorne was spectacular.  The duels between Faith, the Beast, and Angelus were not only epic, but they were also kind of funny.  And this season had probably my favorite fight of the series: Angel vs. Angelus!  I wish that it had been longer.  I truly believe that the writers could devote an entire episode to a duel between the two.Pretty much every episode was good this year, so here are the best of the best: Deep Down.  Spin the Bottle (the show's second funniest episode).  Apocolypse, Nowish.  Long Day's Journey.  Awakening.  Calvary.  Salvage.  Release.  Orpheus.  Inside Out.  Sacrifice.  Peace Out.  Home.  Anyway, that's the Season 4 lowdown.  One season to go.

833826,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B0002HS74C,Annie Feng,"[5, 8]","on the past seasons was about Angel's relationship with Buffy, Darla and the gang. But this season is about Angel's relationship with his son, Connor, which is something entirely brand new and more complex than any other seasons. because you just can't turn away from your family, your bloodline. When Angel was manipulated by mainly Sajhan and Holtz, he was forced to lose the one thing he thought was really his own, something he could really have- a family, something real to love. But in the end his son became his enemy. Angel was torn between the love for connor and the thought of what he has done to him. Angel even thought of killing his own son when he looked at Wesley who saved him and saw connor, he said: "" I should've killed you"". In the middle of the two feelings Angel's guilt steps in on both sides. the guilt that he should've protected connor but he couldn't.As for Connor, in season four he is almost a replicate of Angel in season two. he is experience almost the same thing as Angel in season two. But instead of seeking redemption, Connor seeks love. Connor is being manipulated more than Angel because he is young, he does not have Angel's knowledge and understanding of the human world. In fact he had not even lived in the human world when he grew up. So when he comes to the human world, he loses all control even with the power he has. I know alot of people said connor is not a likeable character. But in my opinion, connor is a really sympathetic character, his unsucessfulness of seeking love is what eventually led to his downfall- because Angel is still the main character of the show, it is only right that he is finally able to save his son from the last moment- a brilliantly created story line.as far as connor's character transformation goes, first he is devastated at the death of Holtz, who he believed is the only one who ever loved him- and who makes connor to kill his own father- the one who really loves him. connor avenged Holtz by sinking Angel to the bottom of the ocean, but when Angel comes back he revealed the truth- that Holtz killed himself in order to turn connor against Angel. Connor was once again torn apart by the revelation that he was set up by Holtz, whom he trusted the most. I know a lot of people are disgusted at the connor having sex with cordelia. But that is actually one of the most significant part of the season, because this is similar to the sex between Angel and Darla- the fact that when connor changed to seeking cordelia, a woman's love, they had sex when the world was falling apart. This shows that connor, too, is despairing at the cruelty of the world and uses sex to escape. The relationship between connor and cordelia became more intense when cordelia became evil and connor was further manipulated.This season also revealed the apocalypse, which is the coming of Jasmine. Even though the jasmine sequence wasn't the most well-done, she nevertheless was brilliantly built. The ideal that the apocalypse wasn't all suffering, people being killed, instead it was all devotion and peace brings out a whole different kind and view of the end of the world- that the world was destroyed by simply changing it from what it's suppose to be, by eliminating the cruelty that is suppose to exist in the world. This, I thought was a brilliant idea. Jasmine was also connor's last chance to love, and you can feel his devastation as connor goes into denial even when he knew jasmine was all a lie,thus ""Connor's epiphany"" was unsucessful. even when he saw the truth, but still he won't accept it, he even lets Jasmine control him, taking over him. This leads to his final downfall when Angel saved the world and took away his lie and denial. Connor completely gave up and killed Jasmine. the irony of connor is this: the thing he seeks for is right in front of him- Angel- the one who really loves him, really cares for him and would give up his own life for him. But connor just won't accept or truly believe it (his dad is the cruelest vampire on earth so can you really blame him??). Home is one of the best season finale. it concluded connor's downfall, that when all the love he ever sought for were all lies, he became convinced that Angel's love was also a lie. So it is up to Angel to prove it to him his love lasts by saving him from everything- in exchange for losing him (the one thing Angel thought he could have, his everything) forever. this episode was so heartbreaking and bittersweet that I cried many times from watching it over and over again. It showed how a parent's love is the most everlasting and the things a parent would do for his child.There are flaws in this season: the ascension of Cordelia. Cordelia could not in any way, becomes a higher being. I know the writers are trying to make Cordelia go somewhere with her visions but they are overdoing it because throughout the four season, cordelia never had any huge moral development during her transformation, so suddenly she's a higher being??? I guess even the writers kind of know that they screw up on that and tried to fix it by revealing that the ascension was all "" part of the master's plan"". Which was worse, and the biggest flaw throughout the season. I can believe connor was master's plan ( even though he also serve as the symbol of miracle), but EVERYTHING ELSE also was?? I understand the writers are trying to stress the whole ""what if nothing we do matters?"" thing but the whole point of the past three season was that Angel will stop at nothing to do what needs to be done, even if he can't fight what is to come, he will never be controlled. But now everything he's ever done was all some part of the master's plan??? This almost totally destroyed the show. If some stupid master is up to this, whatever happened to TPTB?? And also there's one thing throughout the whole season I didn't understand, is that the love relationship between Angel and Cordelia. I mean, it's obvious that it would happen because of the opposite attract thing if you know what I mean. but why did Angel think this time Cordelia would be different from Buffy? He would still have the perfect happiness problem so why is he even considering having a relationship with her??? And why is he so incredibly pissed when he saw Connor and Cordelia having sex since it wouldn't make any difference, so why is Angel angry because he felt cheated??? But anyways, great season!!!",5,"darkest, most complex season",1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,6417,"['past', 'seasons', 'was', 'Angel', 'relationship', 'Buffy', 'Darla', 'gang', 'season', 'Angel',

The seasons get a little darker as time goes on, just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer did.Things get harder for Angel Investigations in season 4.  Angel is locked in a box at the bottom of the ocean until Wesley comes to the rescue. Cordelia shows up with no memory after being missing for some time and ends up taking refuge with Connor.  Cordelia ends up pregnant with an entity that has the power to control the world and everyone in it.  Angelus is brought back to get information about the evil that Cordelia will give birth to.  The gang must get Faith out of prison to help them with Angelus until his soul is replaced. Jasmine is born and Angel must go to the farthest depths to find out who she is and how to eliminate her.The season continues to show that good will prevail over evil.

833828,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0002HS74C,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[7, 11]","&quot;Angel&quot; really found itself and it's full brilliant potential with season 3. That was the season that made the show and is still the series' best season. Coming off that, season 4 had a lot to live up to and it pretty much succeeds. With the season premiere, &quot;Deep Down&quot;, we pick up right where we left off. Angel is rescued from the ocean and we find out exactly where Cordelia is. This is far and away the show's best season opener. &quot;Ground State&quot; is entertaining but undistinguishable. The show sets into a mediocre rut with the next three eps, &quot;The House Always Wins&quot;, &quot;Supersymmetry&quot;, and &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot;, which shows Cordelia's return. The show kicks into high gear with the hysterically comical &quot;Spin The Bottle&quot;, which is a fun delight. The real kicker is &quot;Apocalypse Nowish&quot;, which introduces baddie The Beast, who is really creepy and scary. The action and effects in this ep are amazing. Angelus is brought back to the fold in &quot;Soulless&quot;, a fantastic character driven piece directed by Sean Astin. It seems that Angelus is the only one powerful enough to stop the beast. He escapes in &quot;Cavalry&quot;, a brilliant ep, and all you know what breaks loose. Wes helps Faith break out of jail to help them capture Angelus and she appears in 3 episodes, &quot;Salvage&quot;, &quot;Release&quot;, and &quot;Orpheus&quot;, which also features an appearance by Willow(Alyson Hannigan). The main baddie and final story arc appears in the form of a higher being names Jasmine in &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;, a truly terrible episode. Telling who she is and how she came to be would be giving away too much. Wouldn't you like to be surprised?. It isn't saying much when I say that she isn't all she's cracked up to be. This carries out the rest of the season to some degree of success, especially in the last three episodes of the season, &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;Peace Out&quot;, and the season 5 set up, &quot;Home&quot;. Darla even appears in a fantastic scene with Connor in &quot;Inside Out&quot;. There is more here and more to it, but I don't want to spill everything. Season 4 had it's flaws and weak spots, but doesn't every season?. Not every episode or idea gels, but it's still pretty good. The Connor at 16 thing didn't hold as much interest as it did when he was a baby or before he was born. That was strong, compelling stuff, but let's face it, teen Connor was annoying. David Boreanaz continues to evolve and impress with his performance as Angel, and Alexis Denisoff as Wesley, who got the best change of character, is as excellent as ever. Charisma Carpenter felt underused and used in a wrong way. The Jasmine storyline started off weak and uninteresting, but Gina Torres managed to create a full dimensional character and gave a dazzling performance. The storyline got juicer as it went along, so give it time. Amy Acker as Fred continues to shine, and even gets some juicy things in &quot;The Magic Bullett&quot;. The show's use of slow motion action scene a la &quot;The Matrix&quot; is teriffic and brilliantly used.

Incidentally, this season of ANGEL coincided with the final (and extremely weak) season of BUFFY. This show blew the slayer out of the water. Every episode of Angel's 4th season drove the story forward and was filled with suspense and action, as opposed to BUFFY where it seemed like they never left that darned house with all those stupid slayerettes. This season kept me glued to my television as I watched the fallen Wesley continue his torrid affair with Lilah while still pining for Fred. Those of us hoping for an Angel-Cordelia reunion were taken completely off-guard as she returned from a higher plane...to seduce his son! This season also gave us a peek at old favorites...Faith, Darla and Willow. Like I said, this season really has to be seen to be fully appreciated.

I think the fact that Connor was so different then the rest of the cast, and was whiny and never seemed to fit, might give people a reason not to like the guy. Also, the absense of the real Cordelia, instead we get a very smart demon trapped in Cordy's body who geniously plots out everything. I thought Charisma did a good job for being pregnant, and deserves more credit then she got.Deep Down- 5/5 The opening episode of the season, where Angel is at the bottom of the ocean, Cordy is a higher being, Wesley is sleeping with Lilah and an outcast of the group, while Fred and Gunn take care of Connor, who was the one who sent Angel down to the bottom of the ocean. While Wesley overhears Lilah talking, he decides to take Justine out for a boat ride, who he has held in his closet, prisoner. And the boat ride is obviously to save Angel. Meanwhile, Fred and Gunn find out it was Connor who sent Angel away, and after Wes saves Angel, Angel kicks Connor out of his house.Ground State- 4/5 Welcome, electra Gwen. Angel tries to find out where Cordy is.The House Always Wins- 4.5/5 Angel/Fred and Gunn take a trip to Las Vegas to visit Lorne, who is secretly being held by an insane boss who is purposely using Lorne to destroy lives.Slouching Toward Bethlehem- 4/5 Cordy is back, with no memmory of anything. While Angel is just so happy to see her, they have to figure out where she was and how they can get her memmory back.Supersymmetry- 5/5 Fred finds out that one of her professors was the one that sent her to Pylea, now she wants her revenge.Spin the Bottle- 5/5 After a guarenteed promise by Lorne, that they can get Cordy's memmory back, with no side effects, he realizes what an idiot he is when it turns them all back to when they were 16, you know, except Lorne himself. Cordy's the popular you know what, Wes the total prick and dork, Fred the rambling on geek, who smokes weed, Gunn the racist, who's even more commanding and demanding then he is now, and Angel, or Liam, from the 18th century. After the confusion, Cordy gets her memmory back, which unleashes the demon that came within her.Apocalypse, Nowish- 5/5 Angel and his gang come across a demon that is nearly invincible.Habeas Corpses- 4.5/5 After spotting his son with the woman he loves, Angel is ticked. Meanwhile, the so-called demon named the Beast makes Wolfram & Heart a slotter house.Long Days Journey- 5/5 Gwen is back, meanwhile, the Beast is one step closer to blocking out the sun, for eternity. Cordy has a vision of the Beast standing on a field, only she doesn't get it all at once, it ends up revealing the Beast was talking to Angelus. Wes decides it is time to bring him back.Awakening- 5/5 After the demon within Cordy convinces Angel to go with the plan, and turn himself back into Angelus, Angel goes into a dream where the shaman is evil, they kill the Beast, Connor forgives his dad and Angel gets what he wants... Cordelia.Soulless- 5/5 Angelus is back, and he reluctantly reveals his knowledge of the Beast, when the gang decides to re-insoul their leader, they find the soul is missing.Calvalry- 5/5 After Cordy fakes getting a vision, pretending there is a way to re-insoul Angelus, she puts the whammy on Lorne and sets the demon loose. Meanwhile, Angelus hunts Lilah down, after he doubled-back, leaving Connor/Gunn/Wes/Fred in the middle of nowhere, Lilah manages to escape Angelus only to find Cordy, Lilah, ""He's trying to kill us."" Cordy, ""I know."" She stabs Lilah in the neck, ""Why do you think I let him out?""Salvage- 5/5 Wes decides to bring Faith into the game. Only she gets a big beating from the Beast, and Angelus kills the Beast.Release- 5/5 Faith and Wes take on Angelus.Orpheus- 5/5 After Angelus wins the fight, he finds that Faith has used a drug on herself, called Orpheus, putting them both in a coma, while Willow comes to restore Angel's soul, Angelus and Faith relive Angel's good deeds.Players- 4/5 Gwen comes back, setting up Gunn while she looks for LISA, a device that will cure her electric touch. Meanwhile, Angel and the gang find out about Cordy's pregnancy and Angel puts the pieces together.Inside Out- 5/5 After Cordy says a few of the same words the Beast's master did, Angel figures out it was her the whole time.

They are able to get Gunn, Wes and Lorne back on their side, but Connor still is confused by the lies of Jasmine in Cordy's body, and takes her side, leaving Angel and the gang on the run.Sacrifice- 4/5 Angel and the gang remain on the run, while Wes discovers something that could help them. Angel heads off to a different world... Jasmine's.Peace Out- 4.5/5 Angel comes back with a way to cure all peace in the world, and let people have choice, the freedom to which he believes people should have. That's why he fights.

Meanwhile, Lilah shows up at Angel Investigations, only dead.Home- 5/5 Turns out Lilah offers Angel to be head of W&H;, he takes it despite it being everything he is against. He is forced to kill his own son when Connor tries to blow up a bunch of civilians, including Cordelia.Overall, this was a great season. Though seasons 2 & 5 are far better, this season is amazing. Angel is one of the best shows ever created, you shouldn't miss this season.Special Features- 5/5 Include bloopers, a season 4 overview, audio commentary by Alexis Denisof and Andy Hallett and the writers and crew, and other features throughout the season, including the hotel, the Beast and Jasmine, and Wolfram & Heart.Definitely buy this season.",5,Most people,1103587200,"12 21,

In one episode, Angel's group reverted to teen behavior, but I hardly noticed  because the surrounding shows all too often moved from appalling carnage to ""keep your hands off my boyfriend/girlfriend"" bickering and static scenes of sophomoric soul-searching, both of which I'd hope wouldn't afflict adults in these situations, at least adults who had suffered through all that this group had. The three Faith episodes were good, but then, after portentous warnings about the horror to come, we're treated to a failed, and tedious, attempt at a moral quandary with the coming of Jasmine.  I liked Connor's character--as a teen with cause, at least, his immaturity was justified--and Lilah was also a positive.

Angel is one of those rare examples of a success: five seasons of high quality episodes with a world and characters that were able to get out from under the shadow of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and establish their own turf. Gone are the sun-soaked locales of Sunnydale-replaced by the mean streets of Los Angeles.There are six audio commentaries spread out over the six discs in this set. They feature a wide variety of people behind the camera, from writers like David Fury to directors like Terrence O'Hara to cast members like Andy Hallett. For the most part they are all informative and entertaining with the best of the bunch being the one for ""Spin the Bottle"" featuring Joss Whedon and Alexis Denisof. Joss enjoyed doing this episode because it allowed him to feature the bookish, wimpy Wesley from Buffy with the new, tougher version from Angel. Both men joke with each other in an amusing, entertaining way. Fans of Joss' self-deprecating humour will love this track.On the second disc is ""Angel and the Apocalypse,"" a featurette on the ambitious special effects for the episode, ""Apocalypse, Nowish."" In addition to a nice nod to Hitchcock's The Birds (1963) with many birds attacking our heroes, there was also a fantastic rooftop battle that culminated with a strangely beautiful-looking firestorm.The sixth disc contains the bulk of the extra material. ""Prophecies: Season 4 Overview"" features Joss, the writers and the cast giving the lowdown on what this season was all about. It's a decent synopsis of the season.""Unplugged: Season 4 Outtakes"" is an amusing collection of the cast blowing their lines, doing pratfalls and generally goofing around in front of the camera.""Last Looks: Hyperion Hotel"" is a guided tour of Angel's base of operations with all of the important sets shown and there fascinating insight into how the look of the show is created.""Fatal Beauty and the Beast"" is the lowdown on the two major bad guys of the season-The Beast and Jasmine. The two actors who play them are interviewed and they talk about their respective approaches to their characters.Finally, there is ""Malice in Wonderland: Wolfram and Hart,"" a featurette on the evil corporation that has been a thorn in Angel's side from the first season. As someone points out, they are our worst dream: lawyers in league with evil forces, possibly the Devil.This latest season of Angel comes in an attractive box set with superb transfers of all the episodes (letterboxed!) and a nice collection of extras that fans of this excellent show will enjoy.",4,Good DVD set with strong extras.,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,2688,"['Spin-off', 'shows', 'other', 'more', 'successful', 'TV', 'programs', 'almost', 'never', 'succeed', 'Frasier', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'Watching', 'Ellies', 'MASH', 'Angel', 'one', 'rare', 'examples', 'success', 'five', 'seasons', 'high', 'quality', 'episodes', 'world', 'characters', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'out', 'shadow', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'establish', 'own', 'turf', 'Gone', 'are', 'sun-soaked', 'locales', 'Sunnydale-replaced', 'mean', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles.There', 'are', 'six', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'spread', 'out', 'six', 'discs', 'set', 'feature', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'camera', 'writers', 'David', 'Fury', 'directors', 'Terrence', ""O'Hara"", 'cast', 'members', 'Andy', 'Hallett', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'best', 'bunch', 'being', 'one', 'Spin', 'Bottle', 'featuring', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'Joss', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'episode', 'allowed', 'feature', 'bookish', 'wimpy', 'Wesley', 'Buffy', 'new', 'tougher', 'version', 'Angel', 'men', 'joke', 'other', 'amusing', 'entertaining', 'way', 'Fans', 'Joss', 'self-deprecating', 'humour', 'will', 'love', 'second', 'disc', 'Angel', 'Apocalypse', 'featurette', 'ambitious', 'special', 'effects', 'episode', 'Apocalypse', 'Nowish', 'addition', 'nice', 'nod', 'Hitchcock', 'Birds', '1963', 'many', 'birds', 'attacking', 'heroes', 'was', 'also', 'fantastic', 'rooftop', 'battle', 'culminated', 'strangely', 'beautiful-looking', 'firestorm.The', 'sixth', 'disc', 'bulk', 'extra', 'material', 'Prophecies', 'Season', '4', 'Overview', 'Joss', 'writers', 'cast', 'giving', 'lowdown', 'what', 'season', 'was', 'decent', 'synopsis', 'season', 'Unplugged', 'Season', '4', 'Outtakes', 'amusing', 'collection', 'cast', 'blowing', 'lines', 'doing', 'pratfalls', 'generally', 'goofing', 'around', 'front', 'camera', 'Last', 'Hyperion', 'Hotel', 'guided', 'tour', 'Angel', 'base', 'operations', 'important', 'sets', 'shown', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'how', 'look', 'show', 'created', 'Fatal', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'lowdown', 'two', 'major', 'bad', 'guys', 'season-The', 'Beast', 'Jasmine', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'are', 'interviewed', 'talk', 'respective', 'approaches', 'characters.Finally', 'Malice', 'Wonderland', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'featurette', 'evil', 'corporation', 'been', 'thorn', 'Angel', 'side', 'first', 'season', 'someone', 'points', 'out', 'are', 'worst', 'dream', 'lawyers', 'league', 'evil', 'forces', 'possibly', 'Devil.This', 'latest', 'season', 'Angel', 'attractive', 'box', 'set', 'superb', 'transfers', 'episodes', 'letterboxed', 'nice', 'collection', 'extras', 'fans', 'excellent', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

You'll find very few answers to these questions, and worse, very little motive to find them.

Wesley becomes more hard-edged (which I loved, especially the contrasting tenderness he showed toward Lila).  The actress playing Fred's knocked my socks off (figuratively), especially on the stand-alone episode where it is her pitted against Jasmine and her followers.  Darla comes back in a surprising role which was spectacular as usual.  And...My absolute favorite part is the redemption of Cordelia's charcter from something that was impossible (come on!  She can sword-fight now????  Her body is so weak and scrawny it can barely support her bone structure!) into a darker most unexpected character!  She could never go back to how she was before, and I liked how they ended her character...even with her actual redemption in Season 5.I truly enjoyed Jasmine as well.  It was nice to see a nemesis who is a work of contraries.  Sweet and loving.  But with aspirations of ruling the world --- in a good way.

The season was just all downhill from their it was still fun but I just wanted the charecters to shut up(even the ones I liked)What happened to Connor is probably my biggest beef with the entire season I mean I have to hear him whine for all of those episodes and than he gets his memory erased and no problem right.

The first three seasons and season five are all five star affairs.  There is some good action in this season and the ""beast"" is cool and I liked that story line involving him and his ""master's"" plan to blot out the sun.  One of the differences with season four is it is basically one long story told in 22 hour long segments.  I love the actions and the main characters, and even don't mind the long storyline that continues through this season.  My venting season will have lots of SPOILER ALERTs:  That said, having Cordelia turn into a child molesting whore who slept with Conner was disgusting.  What if Gunn or Angel slept with a child?  The others would have flipped out and probably killed them.  A few episodes after this happened, Fred mentions it was a ""little icky.""  Really?  That's all the outrage!  There is a double standard in our society that if an adult female sleeps with a boy, it is not that big of a deal, but the reverse is horrific.  Both scenarios are repugnant, gross and disgusting.  Kicking Cordy (a beloved character) off the show in this fashion (having her be possessed by the evil master) was frustrating to watch.  Other reviewerss have said it, and I agree,  Conner's broodiness comes across as a spoiled brat who drags down the season.  Angel's response to his son and Cordelia sleeping together was awkward and unnatural.

Everything has led up to this and there are plenty of surprises.The descent into evil that requires only the lives of a few to bring paradise on earth was an interesting twist, putting a whole new face on what really happened in the Garden of Eden. The theme is summed up in Angel's declaration that this time they chose to walk out of Eden; they weren't thrown out.Throughout the season, the themes of betrayal and redemption are played over and over, adding a new dimension with each twist. Joss Whedon brings up an old theme by giving evil a beautiful face and a pleasing form while showing the rot underneath to those who are willing to wipe the glamour from their eyes and see what's right in front of them.However, Alexis Denisof (Wesley) emerges as the most complex and most interesting character in the cast. He manages to remain true to his core principles even though he has embraced the darker elements of his nature, finding a balance that is at once poignant and honest despite his outward appearance.As always, ANGEL continues to surprise, delight, and tap into our emotions, leaving us with the sense that all that glitters is not gold and all that fails to glitter isn't dross.",5,Going out with a bang,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,1352,"['seasons', 'ANGEL', 'most', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'evolution', 'central', 'theme', 'show', 'being', 'best', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Everything', 'led', 'up', 'are', 'plenty', 'surprises.The', 'descent', 'evil', 'only', 'lives', 'few', 'bring', 'paradise', 'earth', 'was', 'interesting', 'twist', 'putting', 'whole', 'new', 'face', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'theme', 'summed', 'up', 'Angel', 'declaration', 'time', 'chose', 'walk', 'Eden', 'were', ""n't"", 'thrown', 'out.Throughout', 'season', 'themes', 'betrayal', 'redemption', 'are', 'played', 'adding', 'new', 'dimension', 'twist', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'up', 'old', 'theme', 'giving', 'beautiful', 'face', 'pleasing', 'form', 'showing', 'rot', 'underneath', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'wipe', 'glamour', 'eyes', 'see', 'what', 'right', 'front', 'them.However', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'Wesley', 'most', 'complex', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'cast', 'remain', 'true', 'core', 'principles', 'even', 'embraced', 'darker', 'elements', 'nature', 'finding', 'balance', 'once', 'poignant', 'honest', 'outward', 'appearance.As', 'always', 'ANGEL', 'surprise', 'delight', 'tap', 'emotions', 'leaving', 'sense', 'glitters', 'not', 'gold', 'glitter', ""n't"", 'dross']",N/A

833859,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B0002HS74C,kaduzy,"[6, 9]","The fourth season of Angel had its fair share of difficulties, it's true.  Obviously the writers weren't counting on their lead actress and pivotal season four character to get knocked up, and all things considered, they dealt with it admirably.  The story they came up with still included all of this show's main themes: sacrifice of loved ones, atonement for past sins -- and most of all, the fine, grey line between ""good"" and ""evil"".In Season Four, we see some of the most complete character development of any season of any show.  Just when you thought these people could get no darker, the writers find all new corners of absolute black to take these characters to.  The relationships between each and every character change, become deeper and more convoluted.  And singular among all characters delving into the dark is Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.  Gone forever is the bumbling nincompoop we loved from Buffy, and from the first season of this excellent show.  With each season, Wesley became more and more complex, until he is now the most intriguing character in Buffy-verse.  He has a whole new arsenal of weapons at his fingertips, and a whole new M.O. when it comes to dealing with the forces of darkness.  He is no longer taking any prisoners (save one notable exception), and we are no longer taking him for granted.The first half of season four was absolutely indescribable.  Episode after episode, I watched with my mouth open in complete shock as to how GOOD this really was.  I couldn't believe it.  From Fred's willingness to punish Conner for his wrong-doings, to Gunn willing to commit murder for Fred . . . and let's not even get into the twisted relationship between Wesley and Lilah Morgan.  I thought the show would be too weak-kneed to touch some issues, such as the interracial relationship element.  Boy, was I wrong.  They jumped head-first into that one, not to mention a number of other things I just didn't see coming.  The Beast, for instance.  What a stellar scene that was, when they all tried to fight him at once, and failed miserably.  Gwen Raiden, for instance.  What a phenomenal character, and how sad that she never got a chance to be brought back.So what went wrong?  The moment the big reveal of Cordelia being the bad guy behind the curtain comes along, the show just kind of . . . tapers off.  I was expecting a bang, but all I got was a whimper.  And though it pains me to say this, to admit ANY fault with this amazing show, I have to say that the writing got weaker, for Evil Cordy and for Angelus in particular.  Angelus simply lacked the menace he had in previous incarnations, even on Buffy.  At least on Buffy, they let him kill someone, eventually.  Here, he's all bluster and almost no bite.  And the one person he DOES bite is already dead!  David Boreanaz obviously did the best he could, but the writing simply wasn't there to support his performance.  Angelus, the most evil of all vampires, hanging out in a bar, drinking with random demon nobodies when there are friends of Angel's to torment and kill?  Give me a break.And I don't know whether it was the pregnancy, the writing, or simply the limit of Charisma Carpenter's acting ability (but I'm thinking it's a combination of all three), but ""Evil"" Cordy simply did not work, as a character or as a concept.  It was hard not to laugh watching those scenes of her ""controlling"" Angel in her magically amplified voice, and the entire thing was simply feeble.  Even the final confrontation between Angel and Angelus lacked any discernible tension at all.  It was, in a word, disappointing.When we finally get to Jasmine -- the season's true big bad, neatly wrapped in a writhing-tentacle bow -- there's another word I can use: boring.  I liked the idea of them ending world peace for the right reasons, because that simply added to the grey, to the conflict that lies at this show's core.  But getting there was only half the fun, literally.  Watching everyone moon and mope over Jasmine was dull, watching them run away from someone from whom there is no escape was pointless, and in the end, defeating her was ridiculously easy.  It only took one episode.  You're telling me this whole thing could have ended with one simple punch through the face four episodes ago?  Holy waste of time, Batman.Overall, however, I still have to grant five stars to this season, because in spite of all that went wrong, the stuff that went right was still 100 times more powerful, more gripping, and just all-around BETTER than anything that came before it, in this show or Buffy.  I wish they could have kept that up, but hey . . . stuff happens.  Either way, it doesn't diminish my eager anticipation for the fifth season.

The Picture and Sound quality are so very good that you feel as though you are watching it in a theater. The closed captioning and Audio come in other languages besides English. It's jam packed with all sorts of extra bonus specials. The Brilliant creator, Joss Whedon and other staff members are at their very best, just as they were with their work on Buffy (which is also a must own). I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other four seasons as well. Quite a bit of quality work went into the making of all five seasons. They are a necessary buy for any Angel fan! It's completely impossible to be anything but extremely pleased with this purchase as well as the rest of the series. The writing, acting , directing, etc... are amazing per usual. This is without question once again feature film quality.The fact that all but the first season is filmed in Letter Box gives it that theater feel. In addition, the closed-captioning is less likely to interfere with the picture. David Boreanaz (Angel) and Alexis Denisof (Wes), are brilliant in their performances together as well as with other cast members. I must give extra credit to Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) in her portrayal of evil Cordy. She does an exceptional job in playing the good girl gone bad without giving away this fact to the other characters. She made it look so easy and it must have been a difficult role to play given that she's used to being good Cordy on Angel. Andy Hallet (Lorne) has a brilliant singing voice as well as a talent for comedy. I love the way he's always speaking to Angel in terms of calling him odd nicknames such as crumb cake or cinnamon buns. It's hard to speak to a very masculine man and yet get away with terms that are very effeminate. He pulls it off beautifully. Amy Acker (Fred) combines a plethora of character traits with amazing talent, playing a sweet, innocent, somewhat crazy (in the beginning of her appearance), brilliant and yet very graceful and sexy woman. These are difficult qualities to combine and make it all believable. She's a really gifted actor. Let us not forget Vincent Kartheiser (Connor) as Angel and Darla's (played by the incomparable Julie Benz) son. For a very young actor he has the natural gift and talent of someone that has been in the business for many years. No matter what incarnation he is playing he does it with absolute believability and gives his all. He has a very bright future should he decide to remain in the business. Joss Whedon once again comes through with continuing to make the show interesting, believable even though it's all fantasy. He does this because he makes the people real and the stories real despite that they are all rooted in non-fiction. I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other four seasons as well. Any true Angel fan must complete their set with this one. It's a keeper folks. Purchase this before it gets sold out and you miss your chance to continue your collection. ORDER IMMEDIATELY AND DON'T FORGET TO BUY SEASON FIVE WHILE YOUR AT IT. Season Five adds James Marsters (Spike) to their cast of characters, and per usual he delivers his untouchable portrayal of another vampire with a soul, yet very different from Angel. The only unfortunate loss is Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia), yet she returns for the 100th episode. That in itself is reason enough for buying season five at the same time you buy season four.

833863,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002HS74C,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[28, 37]","Joss Whedon says that ""Angel: Season Four"" was the show's best season, but I have watched it again from start to finish and I cannot buy into the argument. Like many fans of the show the decision for Connor and Cordelia to have another miracle baby was a bit much to swallow. I know that Charisma Carpenter's pregnancy forced the show to revise the major story arc for the season and I cannot stop thinking that is why this season seems just a bit off: my understanding is that Cordelia was supposed to be the Big Bad who them became Jasmine.  However, I think there was another major problem with the fourth season of ""Angel.""  There are still some great episodes and key moments, not to mention a rather shocking final episode that sets up the fifth and final season, so while this is a sub-standard year in the series it is still an above-average television season.The problematic element in Season 4 has to do with the two major crises that threaten not only Angel Investigations, Inc., but Los Angeles and the world beyond.  The first is when the Beast uses the orbs from the bodies of the five totems connected to the Sun God Ra for the ritual to blot out the sun.  The second is when Jasmine arrives and enraptures Angel and everybody else in Los Angeles and is about to go global.  Now, the problem here is underscored by the idea that the sun is blotted out only in Los Angeles (hence it becomes the destination for all those vampires who like the idea of eternal night).  But even at that level, the sun being blotted out at one point and then the entire city of L.A. becoming Jasmine-happy is going to raise some pretty big concerns in Washington, D.C.The idea that there is a seemy underbelly to Los Angeles is easy to accept, even without getting metaphorical, so the adventures of Angel and his merry band in relative obscurity made sense.  That gets lost when the rest of the planet notices (or rather should).  Now, if you are going out with a big bang (e.g., Sunnydale becoming the world's biggest sink hole on the final episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), then this would have a better chance of working.  The same could be said for pushing the envelope on this idea only once, but ""Angel"" goes for it twice.  I know it seems strange to call for such a dimension of ""realism"" on a showing starring a vampire, but the hallmark of Whedon's shows are their relation to the real world even given the strange lead characters.This season is supposed to be about Angel, Cordelia and Connor, and the rather surprising love triangle that is created that ups the ante on the already troubled relationships Angel has with each of them.  But for me the most interesting relationship during Season Four is between Wesley and Lilah, and the way it plays out against the the former Watcher once again becoming part of Angel Investigations.  Wesley is the one who finds Angel in a box at the bottom of the sea and who brings Faith back to take down Angelus.  The transformation of Wesley Wyndam-Pryce from comic relief to the tragic figure who was the last character I wanted to see die at the end of it all, is one of the most impressive in television history, right up there with Lou Grant and Margaret Houlihan.The fact that we lose two major characters by the end of the season was also rather shocking.  Certainly we can understand why Connor gets beaten down by all of the happenings and revelations throughout the season and I appreciated Skip's explanation for Cordelia becoming a higher being because we sort of knew that was just not right from the start.  We also a trip to Las Vegas (""The House Always Wins""), get Fred seek revenge against the person who sent her to Pylea (""Supersymmetry""), most of the cast reverted to teenagers (""Spin the Bottle""), the Beast slaying everybody at Wolfram & Hart (""Habeas Corpses""), bringing back Angelus on purpose (""Awakening"") to play mind games with everyone (""Soulless""), Willow showing up to once again put Angel's soul back (""Orpheus""), and an intriquing offer from Hell (""Home"").In terms of DVD extras it is nice to see that a couple of the cast members, Andy Hallett and Alexis Denisof, join the various writers and directors (usually someone doing both roles) in doing commentaries on a half-dozen episodes.  The other special features are an overview of Season 4, outtakes, a last look at the Hyperion Hotel set, ""Fatal Beauty and the Beast"" (the Season 4 Big Bads), and a look at Wolfram & Hart (""Malice in Wonderland"").I should also mention at the end that I did have a twinge of disappointment with regards to the final scene of Season Four. This was because I was absolutely convinced that when Angel looked through that window he was going to see not only Connor, but Darla as well. I was getting all ready to weep over what would have been a fitting counterpart to the greatest moment on ""Angel,"" which was the stunning scene when Darla gave birth. But that is not quite what we got, which certainly represents Season Four as a whole.",4,"The evil is among them in Season Four of ""Angel""",1095811200,"09 22, 2004",2004,5004,"['Joss', 'Whedon',

Some fans say it's has too many flaws, some fans hate it for ruining Cordelia as a character, some hate it for Connor and his almost incest-like relationship with Cordelia, some fans think the Jasmine storyline was the worst idea ever, most just hate it for all those reasons. But me, I think this by far Angel's best season to date! It was not only darkest year, but it brought the show to new heights with its epic and apocalyptic episodes. It made all the events of the last 2 seasons make sense and almost every episode ended with a shock, twist or cliffhanger. There were impressive big bads like The Beast, amazing returns from Angelus, Faith and even Willow! Here's Season 4:Deep Down-Great episode!! ""With Angel and Cordelia still missing, Gunn and Fred have been looking after Connor unaware of what he did to Angel, while Wesley turns to Justine find Angel."" This was a strong opener with great scenes like Wesley saving Angel and Angel confronting Connor. Cordelia is a higher being.Ground State-Great episode!! ""After Angel visits the Dinza, the goddess of lost, Angel with Fred and Gunn find the Axis of Pythia to find Cordelia just as a thief with electrical powers plans to steal it."" There's a creepy opening teaser in this episode and Gwen herself is a refreshing character who appears 2 more times in this season.The House Always Wins-Great episode!! ""When Angel, Fred and Gunn take a trip to Las Vegas, they find out Lorne is being held against his will when a casino owner has him help him steal the destinies of innocent people."" This episode has stunning cinematography of Las Vegas and hilarious scene with Lorne and Fred.Slouching Toward Bethlehem-Pretty good episode!! ""Cordelia returns to the hotel but has no memory of who she is or anybody else is. Angel and the rest of the gang decide not to tell her the truth of demons while Connor suffers."" While this episode has some dull parts, Wesley and Lilah's relationship makes for some great scenes.Supersymmetry-Pretty good episode!! ""Just as Fred's physics article is published, she finds out that her old professor is responsible for her being trapped in Pylea.""

This was a great finale that opens a lot of possibilities for next season.Season 4 is a harshly underrated season; it's one of the best seasons of the Buffyverse in general with the writers creating ambitious and imaginative storylines, with powerful themes and strong characterizations. The Big Bads were inventive with many well acted returns from recurring characters. This is an amazing set that has the most extras so far with a season overview, specials on Jasmine, the Beast, Wolfram and Hart, and the Hyperion Hotel sets.",5,The Fatal Beauty and the Beast-Angel's

I bought Angel Seasons 4 and 5 from the same seller and once I received them, I re-watched the series from beginning to end. Even though money is tight and it isn't responsible to spend money on DVD's, It was a great deal... $15 dollars for two seasons before tax and shipping. Wow, that is a great deal! I have no regret or buyer's remorse for purchasing these two DVD's. I will definitely watch this series over and over again. However, I was not entirely happy with this product and I am not sure if I will go through this seller again. For purchasing a new DVD, I expected better quality. When I took off the packaging, I noticed the case was broken. When I opened the case, pieces of the case fell out. The side of the case is broken (that middle part when the case is open). I am not sure if that happened during shipping, so I don't hold it against the seller. There was also another problem with the product. Episodes three and four on disc 1 did not work. I tried cleaning the disc, dusting out my DVD player (which all other episodes worked fine, so it was not the player), and nothing helped it. Those episodes happen to be my favorite episodes in that season and I will most likely have to buy another copy of this season. I don't know if these problems are from the seller, shipping, or manufacturing, but regardless of whose fault it is, a poor experience does tend to turn a customer away.

The stories and character interactions were well done. I suppose not everyone will like the Cordelia storyline, especially how she is all but left out of the final episodes...but the show goes on.

833867,AGN8YYJ6BHBEU,B0002HS74C,"Lucifer ""Superman isn't brave he is invulnerable""","[2, 6]",With how things were left at the end of Season 3 all fans had to wonder what was really going on. Angel is at the bottom of the ocean. Wesley is out of the group and with Lilah. Connor is on the loose and possibly capable of killing. Cordy is gone.So how does Season 4 handle this? With the confident swagger of a show sure of itself and the audience. With that much happening most shows would collapse under the weight of it all. They tie up the loose ends nicely and then start to get down to the nitty gritty of the new season.Connor is dealt with and integrated expertly. He is much needed as the voice of dissent and anger at Angel.My favorite arc of season 4 is the Angelus arc that culminated with Orpheus where we get the long awaited Angel vs. Angelus showdown. DB really shows his acting range and makes us all recall his brilliant turn as Angelus in Buffy Season 2. The reappearance of Faith and Willow give the show a much needed injection of Buffyness just to keep the show fresh.The Beast is a great villian and the invasion of W&H; by him is one of the most chilling and yet satisfying slaughters on any show ever. The bad guys killing the bad guys is really a moral dilemma. Can we cheer The Beast feasting on the lawyers? I know I did.My only beef with Season 4 is the Jasmine arc. I thought it was hokey and a little boring. It was however a means to an end and worked well to move the plot along so I don't begrudge it that much. No show is perfect so a flaw here and there must be expected and tolerated.,5,Outstanding stuff.,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,1524,"['how', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'end', 'Season', '3', 'fans', 'had', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'Angel', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'Wesley', 'group', 'Lilah', 'Connor', 'loose', 'possibly', 'capable', 'killing', 'Cordy', 'gone.So', 'how', 'Season', '4', 'handle', 'confident', 'swagger', 'show', 'sure', 'audience', 'much', 'happening', 'most', 'shows', 'would', 'collapse', 'weight', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'nicely', 'then', 'start', 'get', 'down', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'new', 'season.Connor', 'dealt', 'integrated', 'expertly', 'much', 'needed', 'voice', 'dissent', 'anger', 'Angel.My', 'favorite', 'arc', 'season', '4', 'Angelus', 'arc', 'culminated', 'Orpheus', 'where', 'get', 'long', 'awaited', 'Angel', 'vs.', 'Angelus', 'showdown', 'DB', 'really', 'acting', 'range', 'recall', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'Angelus', 'Buffy', 'Season', '2', 'reappearance', 'Faith', 'Willow', 'give', 'show', 'much', 'needed', 'injection', 'Buffyness', 'just', 'keep', 'show', 'fresh.The', 'Beast', 'great', 'villian', 'invasion', 'W', 'H', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'yet', 'satisfying', 'slaughters', 'show', 'ever', 'bad', 'guys', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'really', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'Can', 'cheer', 'Beast', 'feasting', 'lawyers', 'know', 'did.My', 'only', 'beef', 'Season', '4', 'Jasmine', 'arc', 'thought', 'was', 'hokey', 'little', 'boring', 'was', 'however', 'means', 'end', 'worked', 'well', 'move', 'plot', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'much', 'show', 'perfect', 'flaw', 'here', 'there', 'must', 'be', 'expected', 'tolerated']",N/A

833870,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B0002HS74C,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[3, 6]","I must say that I am a huge Angel and Buffy fan, but I found that this season fell way short of my expectations. I thought that there was a fantastic build up this season, but that they pay off was god awful or didn't exist at all.At the beginning of the season we find Gunn and Fred still together and with Conner (lieing to them) trying to find Angel. Angel is rescued by Wesley who is still kinda nutty after his flopped attempt at saving Conner from Angel. Wesley is still involved with the ever enduring Lilah. I must say that she was a fantastic character and it was a shame to see her get what was coming to her towards the end of the season.Cordelia returs from her time as a member of the powers that be with no memory. This was the particular painful part of the season to watch. Cordelia then regains her memory and sleeps with Angel's son Conner.....Can we all say eeeww[...] course things are not always as they seem. If I had known that while watching the season it might not have been so difficult to get through.Eventually Wesley returns to the group and Angel let's everyone know he saw Cordelia sleep with his son. The result of their one night stand is Jasmine. After a entire season of watching Angel and Cordelia flirt, it would end up being another whole season before viewers got any kind of resolution to that story and boy was it a fantastic episode.Ok so where's where the season went wrong....The big bad for the season appeared to be a demon who was industructable. In the end the demon turns out to be nothing like that demon. In fact the  big bad for the season was Jasmine, and she was a horrible big bad.The three things that kept this season from only being a two star season for me were the guest appearences of Faith and Willow, and the return of Angelus. Alyson Hannigan portrayed Willow in the episode entitled, ""Orpheus."" In this episode Willow is well good ol' Willow and adds a much needed layer of comic relief to a show that had gotten WAY too dark. Hannigan is hilarious and it is very funny watching her play opposite real life husband Alexis Denisof (Wesley). Eliza Dushku shines as always as Faith. The last time Faith was in the Buffyverse was a very brief appearence in the first episode of Angel Season 2. Faith is asked by Wesley to help them restore Angel's soul to him. It was very awsome to see how Faith was redeamed and finally became a character we all could love in the end. With the help of Willow the two ladies do just that.Which brings me to Angelus. The only thing more fun for me to watch than Angel is bad Angel. David Boreanaz shines as Angelus and quite frankly just rocks it.

It's not gonna do you any good to rant and rave about your pissy moods. The fans wont listen..This season was a major turn for the cast and crew and the show. We get into the character of Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) a lot more. We see Angel's (David Boreanaz) return from the ocean, Cordelia's (Charisma Carpenter)return from the heavens and Wesley's (Alexis Denisof) return  to the team for the Apocalypse. Fred (Amy Acker) and Gunn (J. August Richards) break up in this season with a little love triangle between those two and Wesley. Faith (Eliza Dushku) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) make guest appearances. Eliza is firehot as Faith, you cant deny that. If I was a biker, i'd like her to ride me. Lorne (Andy Hallett) returns from Las Vegas with the gang. Connor and Cordelia make love during the apocalypse while Angel is watching (whoa is all I gotta say). Wolfram and Hart get the smackdown of their lives from the nasty horny thing called The Beast (Vladimir Kulich). Among the dead lawyers is Gavin Park (Daniel Dae Kim). Angelus returns for 5 episodes and has some fun. Boreanaz knows how to make Angelus be bad and he does it good and its creepy. We get a 5 episode spread of a eclipse. We get a mystical pregnacy right under our noises (which was what Lorne said). Cordelia kills Lilah Morgan (Stephanie Romanov). Cordelia gives birth to a woman names Jasmine(Gina Torres, not the best choice but shes alright) who makes people really happy like their on some hightrip. Connor gets to see his mother Darla (Julie Benz) for the first time. They gang find out Jasmine is from another dimension and she is a maggot faced people eater. Angel gets into a fight with Jasmine but Connor ends up killing her. Lilah returns from hell to give  Angel and the gang a bargain of a life time, Wolfram and Hart, fully rebuilt and brand new, but the only way Angel would do that is if Connor's mind was erased and they put him to another family so he would be at peace and Cordelia is put in a coma. Tune in to next season cuz I think the fifth and final season is the best, no doubts. Vincent Kartheiser and Andy Hallett's names are in the opening credits, though Kartheiser and Charisma Carpenter's names are pulled after the season end. I will enjoy this DVD till I die.

Reading these, I became wary of diving in and watching, not wanting to see one of my favorite shows go downhill.And then I began watching it.  The season opener was brilliant, which re-established Wesley's presence in the group.  Over the course of a few episodes, flashes of Cordy in a higher realm were hilarious as she watched the group work.  You also get to see Fred's darker side as she seeks revenge for Pylea.  The Las Vegas episode is great as well, since Lorne is brought back in the fold.  It's at the end of that episode when Cordy finally comes back, but with a twist: her memory of her past is completely forgotten.  A spell gone bad brings them back, but also unleashes her darker side, a side she never knew she had.  The twists and turns of the season, including the return of Eliza Dushku's Faith and Angelus, are many and keep you on the edge of your seat.While the relationship between Cordy and Connor was implausible and out-of-place, it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  And the character of Connor could have used some tweaking, but it was well-played and worked well when playing off Angel.  The last arc of the season, that of Jasmine, is haunting and still leaves me uneasy.  Overall, it's a wonderful season and is a lot of fun to watch.

833874,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0002HS74C,Mitch Weaver,"[9, 10]","I never managed to watch a single episode of Angel while it was on television. However, I have been watching the show season per season on the DVD sets just as I have done with Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Up until I saw season four of Angel, I would have given the nod to Buffy as being the better of the two shows. However, season four of Angel was incredible and actually made me like the show more than Buffy. The thing that has impressed me the most about Angel, is that the show has gotten better with each passing season. Going into season four, I had no idea how good it would turn out to be, but by the end of the season I was blown away. For some unknown reason, season four is often thought of is one of the weakest, if not the weakest season of the show. Personally, I do not understand why season four has taken so much heat from fans of the show. In my opinion, it is without a doubt the best season that I have seen so far.Season four of Angel drags you in from the very beginning and keeps you there until the end of the season. Just when I thought that this season could not get any better, something else would happen to convince me otherwise. This season had so many great elements to it with Angel and his son Connor both falling for Cordelia, Wesley and Lilah having a relationship, Faith and Angelus coming back, the fight to stop a unstoppable demon known as The ""Beast"" from bringing forth an appocalypse, and much more. A few episodes worth mentioning are ""Appocalypse Nowish"" which is perhaps the best episode of the show I have ever seen, in which The Beast is introduced, ""Spin the Bottle"" in which Lorne attempts to help Cordelia regain her memory with a spell, and everyone ends up taking on their personalities of when they were 17 including Angel, ""Awakening"" which is a superb alternate reality episode, and ""Soulless"" in which Angelus returns.Overall, season four of Angel manages to prove why it is one of the best shows you will ever see. However, the DVD set is not only worth owning because of the episodes themselves. It is packed full of great extras. You get four featurettes which includes an overview of season four, a gag reel filled with outtakes, and more.A solid 5 stars...",5,The best season of the show,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,2217,"['never', 'managed', 'watch', 'single', 'episode', 'Angel', 'was', 'television', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'season', 'season', 'DVD', 'just', 'have', 'done', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'saw', 'season', 'four', 'Angel', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'nod', 'Buffy', 'being', 'better', 'two', 'shows', 'However', 'season', 'four', 'Angel', 'was', 'incredible', 'actually', 'made', 'show', 'more', 'Buffy', 'thing', 'impressed', 'most', 'Angel', 'show', 'gotten', 'better', 'passing', 'season', 'Going', 'season', 'four', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'good', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'unknown', 'reason', 'season', 'four', 'often', 'thought', 'one', 'weakest', 'not', 'weakest', 'season', 'show', 'Personally', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'season', 'four', 'taken', 'so', 'much', 'heat', 'fans', 'show', 'opinion', 'doubt', 'best', 'season', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far.Season', 'four', 'Angel', 'drags', 'very', 'beginning', 'end', 'season', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'season', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'something', 'else', 'would', 'happen', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'season', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'elements', 'Angel', 'son', 'Connor', 'falling', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'Lilah', 'having', 'relationship', 'Faith', 'Angelus', 'coming', 'back', 'fight', 'stop', 'unstoppable', 'demon', 'known', 'Beast', 'bringing', 'forth', 'appocalypse', 'much', 'more', 'few', 'episodes', 'mentioning', 'are', 'Appocalypse', 'Nowish', 'perhaps', 'best', 'episode', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Beast', 'introduced', 'Spin', 'Bottle', 'Lorne', 'help', 'Cordelia', 'regain', 'memory', 'spell', 'everyone', 'up', 'taking', 'personalities', 'when', 'were', '17', 'including', 'Angel', 'Awakening', 'superb', 'alternate', 'reality', 'episode', 'Soulless', 'Angelus', 'returns.Overall', 'season', 'four', 'Angel', 'manages', 'prove', 'why', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'However', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'only', 'worth', 'owning', 'episodes', 'packed', 'full', 'great', 'extras', 'get', 'four', 'featurettes', 'overview', 'season', 'four', 'gag', 'reel', 'filled', 'outtakes', 'more.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",N/A

The ""Ick Factor"" shows up in every character. It gets so intense that it takes away all of the good qualities and turns the season into an uncomfortable experience for the viewer. The ending with Connor is particularly depressing. I realize that only something that intense would make Angel go to Wolfram & Hart, but the question that should be asked is: Why would the show WANT to go there?I know that the actress playing Cordelia got pregnant, but pregnancy doesn't have to be a bad thing - she could have been magically pregnant by Angel himself providing a twin brother for Connor or by something that would have been a ""cure"" for Angel. After Season Three, there were all sorts of wonderful possibilities that could have occurred. Call me old-fashioned, but I would have liked Cordelia to come back for a romantic time with Angel who would have been saved from the sea to become closer to Connor and make him a partner in the world-saving business.Unfortunately, nothing positive was explored and the viewer is left with these wonderful characters in a big, depressing mess of circumstances that were just kind of... well... yucky! I probably would never have tuned in again, except that Spike shows up in the last season.To understand the final season, you have to watch this season.

Literally every single episode ends with a cliffhanger.  Now many people may not care about this because they watch bogus network shows like Alias or whatever, but ending every Angel with a cliffhanger was a very bold and original move.  I say this because while Buffy and Angel have had their fair share of ""to be continued""s for the most part, the seasons of both shows progressed along at a very nice pace with each episode containing its own smaller plot that somehow might relate back to the larger problem at hand.  If it didn't, then no big deal (see Doublemeat Palace) but basically, all the episodes were for the most part a self-contained packaged story.  Allowing Angel Season 4 to flow with cliffhangers from episode to episode not only higtened the suspense of the show, but makes the DVD awesome, because as soon as one suspenseful show ends you can throw in the next one to see how it works out!!Problems with this season stem from the fact that it is basically one continuous story.  With the exception of the Gwen episdoes, there is little else the gang does except try to deal with the Beast and his Master.  I say this is a problem because if you missed an episode you could be really confused plot-wise, but luckily the DVDs allow us to get rid of that problem.  Unfortunately, the DVDs don't get rid of the missuse of Charisma Carpenter during what was unfortunately her last season.  Yes, she was pregnant and yes, it's difficult to be on a TV show when you're body is getting bigger and bigger and you look more and more pregnant, but I feel the writers did a horrible job with Cordelia during the fourth season, especially after how much they made her grow during the show's first 3 seasons.  Other than that, the rest of the cast (including the annoyingly annoying Connor) was excellently written for and acted their roles flawlessly.Team Angel may have been freakin' out over the baby Cordy had with Connor, but you know what would have really freaked 'em out?  The demon-spawn that would have resulted from the worst two characters ever:Connor and Dawn (I hated her addition to Buffy and she almost ruined my favorite show for me.

August Richards) pretty much gets put on the backburner, and Carpenter's departure towards the end of the season hurt the show greatly.  Highlights of this season include the return of Angel's demonic alter ego Angelus (with a guest appearance from Buffy's Alyson Hannigan), as well as rogue slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), and the storyarc involving Cordelia's and Connor's (Vincent Kartheiser) demonic offspring Jasmine (Firefly's Gina Torres) and a brilliant twist on the coming apocalypse.  All in all, Angel season four isn't bad one bit, but it's a step down from the excellent third season, and only paved the way for the sad and final fifth season.",3,"Uneven, but entertaining season",1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,1506,"['season', 'four', 'Angel', 'favorite', 'brooding', 'vampire', 'soul', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'trapped', 'iron', 'box', 'bottom', 'sea', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'ascended', 'awaits', 'orders', 'higher', 'power', 'Amazon', 'review', 'most', 'resolved', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'apocalyptic', 'foreshadowing', 'soon', 'reality', 'gang', 'when', 'horned', 'demon', 'called', 'Beast', 'rains', 'fire', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Cordelia', 'pregnant', 'Carpenter', 'actually', 'was', 'time', 'was', 'integrated', 'story', 'results', 'have', ""n't"", 'guessed', 'are', 'far', 'good', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'season', 'four', 'Angel', 'surprising', 'how', 'uneven', 'show', 'even', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'uneven', 'season', 'five', 'love', 'triangle', 'Wesley', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'Fred', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'Gunn', 'J.', 'August', 'Richards', 'pretty', 'much', 'put', 'backburner', 'Carpenter', 'departure', 'end', 'season', 'hurt', 'show', 'greatly', 'Highlights', 'season', 'include', 'return', 'Angel', 'demonic', 'alter', 'ego', 'Angelus', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Buffy', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'as', 'well', 'rogue', 'slayer', 'Faith', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'storyarc', 'involving', 'Cordelia', 'Connor', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'demonic', 'offspring', 'Jasmine', 'Firefly', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'brilliant', 'twist', 'coming', 'apocalypse', 'Angel', 'season', 'four', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'bit', 'step', 'down', 'excellent', 'third', 'season', 'only', 'paved', 'way', 'sad', 'final', 'fifth', 'season']",N/A
833879,AUF6FDVDLET0W,B0002HS74C,"Nightwing's Fan ""starchild212""","[7, 8]","I'm sure, like many Angel fans, we  missed alot of the runnings of Angel during seasons 4 & 5 becuase  of WB stations not always running the show on it's normal wednesday night time slot, and was shown instead on thurs & fri nights at 10pm and sometimes 11pm..this random airing of this show I feel was a sure reason why the show lost viewers and lent itself to a too soon cancellation after 5 years.For me, watching the S4 box set is like watching a new season...After the first dozen episodes, the station that broadcasts WB shows in my area would randomly show Angel on different nights/times...I either missed the show for not knowing when it was on or forgot to watch or program my vcr to catch it.I'm up to watching disc 5 and must say, this season had ALOT of twists, turns & plots going on.  The best about S4 was that Gunn's character was more developed and was brought more with his relationship with Fred.  What happened to Cordie is still mysterious and find it to be strange...Having Angelus come back to fight the beast added more depth to the show and was interesting how he told alot of truths about his friend's feelings and their stressful relationships while fighting demons and dealing with the gullible and headstrong Connor. Making Wesley a darker, character was great--from being shot, tortured by Faith and having his throat slit--no wonder the guy is so brutal!! His Brains mixed with the Brawn certainly helps out the Angel gang..Bringing back Faith to help fight the beast & assist with Willow and the gang to bring Angel's soul back is the highlight of the season..(If Tru Calling does get cancelled, I sure hope plan B for Eliza Dushku is to work with Joss Weadon to do a FAITH spin-off! and keep the Buffyverse alive on TV).  It's great that most of angel was presented in widescreen--Wish they did the same with buffy...i hate the foldout packaging of these box sets--i'd rather have them in dvd boxes and kepted in a slipcase...the featurettes are good, too..To me, what Buffy & Angel did for TV is like what Star Wars did with movies=it bought us great, entertaining stories of fantasy, stories about fighters for good you don't give up hope, very likable characters, great acting, top notch cinematography and really great use of art with the demons and special effects..It's sad that Buffy & Angel are over...I reall feel they were the last shows to bring us quality television--thank goodness for DVD!!!",5,ANGEL SEASON 4 --THE LOST SEASON,1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,2439,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'Angel', 'fans', 'missed', 'alot', 'runnings', 'Angel', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'becuase', 'WB', 'stations', 'not', 'always', 'running', 'show', 'normal', 'wednesday', 'night', 'time', 'slot', 'was', 'shown', 'instead', 'thurs', 'fri', 'nights', '10pm', 'sometimes', '11pm..this', 'random', 'airing', 'show', 'feel', 'was', 'sure', 'reason', 'why', 'show', 'lost', 'viewers', 'lent', 'too', 'soon', 'cancellation', '5', 'years.For', 'watching', 'S4', 'box', 'set', 'watching', 'new', 'season', 'first', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'station', 'WB', 'shows', 'area', 'would', 'randomly', 'show', 'Angel', 'different', 'nights/times', 'missed', 'show', 'not', 'knowing', 'when', 'was', 'forgot', 'watch', 'program', 'vcr', 'catch', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'up', 'watching', 'disc', '5', 'must', 'say', 'season', 'had', 'ALOT', 'twists', 'plots', 'going', 'best', 'S4', 'was', 'Gunn', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'developed', 'was', 'brought', 'more', 'relationship', 'Fred', 'What', 'happened', 'Cordie', 'still', 'mysterious', 'find', 'be', 'strange', 'Having', 'Angelus', 'come', 'back', 'fight', 'beast', 'added', 'more', 'depth', 'show', 'was', 'interesting', 'how', 'told', 'alot', 'truths', 'friend', 'feelings', 'stressful', 'relationships', 'fighting', 'demons', 'dealing', 'gullible', 'headstrong', 'Connor', 'Making', 'Wesley', 'darker', 'character', 'was', 'great', 'being', 'shot', 'tortured', 'Faith', 'having', 'throat', 'slit', 'wonder', 'guy', 'so', 'brutal', 'Brains', 'mixed', 'Brawn', 'certainly', 'out', 'Angel', 'gang..Bringing', 'back', 'Faith', 'help', 'fight', 'beast', 'assist', 'Willow', 'gang', 'bring', 'Angel', 'soul', 'back', 'highlight', 'season..', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'get', 'cancelled', 'sure', 'hope', 'plan', 'B', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'work', 'Joss', 'Weadon', 'do', 'FAITH', 'spin-off', 'keep', 'Buffyverse', 'alive', 'TV', 'great', 'most', 'angel', 'was', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'Wish', 'did', 'same', 'buffy', 'i', 'hate', 'foldout', 'packaging', 'box', 'sets', 'i', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'dvd', 'boxes', 'kepted', 'slipcase', 'featurettes', 'are', 'good', 'too..To', 'what', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'did', 'TV', 'what', 'Star', 'Wars', 'did', 'movies=it', 'bought', 'great', 'entertaining', 'stories', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'fighters', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'hope', 'very', 'likable', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'cinematography', 'really', 'great', 'use', 'art', 'demons', 'special', 'effects..It', 'sad', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'are', 'reall', 'feel', 'were', 'last', 'shows', 'bring', 'quality', 'television', 'thank', 'goodness', 'DVD']",N/A
833880,A14AD0NQTRVVJC,B0002HS74C,Patrick J. Sullivan,"[8, 12]","This long review contains numerous spoilers.I want to cut the writers of season four some slack because Charisma Carpenter's real-life pregnancy interfered with their original plans for this year. But that is no excuse for some of the half-baked things they came up with instead. Making Angel a grandfather when he didn't even have a kid until a year ago? Having Connor and Cordelia sleep together? So many of the plot developments contradicted what we had been shown regarding these characters before.If you like this season, fine. I won't tell you that your opinion is ""wrong."" Please just don't try to tell any of us detractors that our negative views are ""wrong,"" either. And it isn't that we don't like it because we're too dull to understand it, as a few of the less literate reviews try to claim.Relationships were at the heart of season four: some good, some bad, and some inconsistently drawn ones. Gunn and Fred finally have something in common, having collaborated to ""execute"" her backstabbing former mentor who turns out to have been the one who sent her to Pylia in the first place. But once the couple finally has some common ground, they break up over it. Is it understandable that the killing could cause a separation. Maybe. But those waiting for any more significant ramifications of their vengeance won't find any, either this season or next. Apparently committing a revenge killing together is significant enough to break up over, but not significant enough for anything else (the cops, counseling, etc.)Wesley and Lilah have one of the most entertainingly ""wrong"" relationships in the whole Angel saga. Wesley is with her partially to punish himself, as he still feels guilty over his mistake regarding Connor. He is aware that she is trying to use him and seduce him over to the Wolfram & Hart camp, and he likes to think that he is only using her. He ends up caring for her a lot more than he fully realizes until he is gone. The fact that he thinks it is Angelus who had killed her, after Wesley had been duped by Lilah into taking Connor from Angel, only makes the whole thing more poignant. As for Lilah, she remains more likeable than her former W&H; rival Lindsey or her current rival Gavin Park.The Connor and Cordelia pairing is not ""forbidden romance"" like Buffy + Angel or enemies sleeping together like Wesley + Lilah or a comical mismatch like Cordelia + Xander. It's just plain gross. Even if Cordelia truly doesn't realize how gross it is because she's really just a puppet of the thing that will give birth to itself as Jasmine, and even if Connor doesn't fully realize how gross it is because he doesn't remember how Cordelia used to change his diapers (six months ago!) the audience knows those things too well for our own comfort. And I don't care what Cordelia says about Connor being eighteen; he still looks about eleven and a half. Also, if L.A. really is under siege, Connor and Cordelia's place is out there fighting the Beast, not in bed together. When has anyone on this show ever given up and substituted sex for struggle before?But the real weakness of the season four plot is the Jasmine storyline. Gina Torres was fine as Zoe on Firefly. But the Jasmine character is too placid to seem threatening, however grotesque her true worm-infested appearance is. Incidentally, Connor completely misses the point about Jasmine's true appearance. It's alarming not because she isn't pretty, but because it's proof that she's been lying to everyone.Not that that's the only mistake Connor makes. Most people would be a little chastened to find out how thoroughly they'd been duped by Justine and Holtz. They'd be a little more cautious the next time. They'd be a little inclined to give Angel the benefit of the doubt next time, after having unfairly imprisoned him at the bottom of the ocean before. Not Connor. If there's a wrong conclusion to be leapt to, he's still right there to do the leaping. And of course he reflexively does the opposite of whatever Angel wants him to do, and since Angel is generally correct, Connor's generally wrong. The bottom line of course is that Connor is an irritating child. I wish he had been a vampire and that Spike had been around to hoist him into the sunlight. His going postal at season's end was not at all justifiable, but it pretty much summed up this disastrous character's reign of error.Lorne had become less relevant as season three progressed, and of course by season five he will have nothing to offer. Season four finds him well on the way to irrelevancy. The lounge lizard character never made much sense as a detective agency hanger-on anyway. The gang should either help him rebuild Caritas for a third time, or else kick him loose. He does have one useful vision - but it's promptly stolen from him by Wolfram & Hart. That doesn't give the average viewer much reason to pay attention to the character.Gunn becomes less important after he and Fred break up. The character's fighting skills have little relevance when facing a threat like Jasmine that has to be figured out instead of just staked to death, as Gunn himself realizes. Wesley's books count for far more than Gunn's weapons. Angelus succeeds in rousing his jealousy of Wesley and Fred, and Gunn plays right into the vampire's hands. The more metaphysical the show became, the less importance its enforcer had.Fred, however, started to come into her own in season four. In season three she had first been just a recovering victim, then Gunn's girlfriend. In season four, she's actually useful. This is especially important now, as Wesley is no longer a member of Angel Investigations. Fred is especially important when the Jasmine storyline begins, as she is the only one who can see through Jasmine's disguise. She succeeds in opening Angel's eyes, which is the only thing that eventually saves the day.Wesley had started to become a more complex and interesting character in season three, and in season four he really takes over the show. From the year's very first episode, where his determination to succeed at all costs enables him to rescue Angel (while Fred and Gunn are just spinning their wheels uselessly), it is Wesley who provides the most interesting moments in season four. When a shocked Gunn, confused by the new Wesley, asks what happened to him, Wesley's matter-of-fact response of, ""My throat was cut and all my friends abandoned me,"" provides one of the high points of the season. That pretty much sums up the new Wesley.Not that he's always right by any means, just interesting. He does allow himself to be used by Lilah, though there was never any question about Lilah's loyalty to W&H;'s agenda. Even after his disastrous season three kidnapping of Connor, he's still too prone to insisting upon radical and dangerous possible solutions to problems. Bringing back Angelus to get info on the Beast is a cure that's potentially worse than the disease. Breaking Faith out of prison to help catch Angelus is another example of the same rash thinking - and that one wouldn't even have been necessary if he hadn't brought Angelus back to begin with! But Wes never stops to think how each rash decision forces another one.Looming over all of Angel's series is the threat of the return of Angelus. This threat is finally realized in season four, though Angelus returns in a more controlled fashion than he had on Buffy. He also doesn't stay free for very long, nor do that much damage while he's around. The whole thing was a bit of a wet firecracker. I was also disappointed that even after Wesley and Cordelia warned them not to let anything Angelus said get to them, the vampire still effortlessly pushed all their buttons - including Wesley's. They were bound to be hurt by some of the things Angelus said, but showing him their hurt was just feeding the monster. Next time, try having a little pride.Angel himself is more interesting, and his justifiable distress over every aspect of the Cordelia / Connor debacle makes him more sympathetic than he's been in a long time. Losing your girl is bad, losing your young son is worse, and losing your girl to your young son...Faith's return from prison was probably somewhat premature (the state of California penal system would agree), but that was done as much for her to help with the final apocalypse on Buffy as to aid with Angelus. It was good to see Faith and Wesley reconcile; they had let each other down badly as Slayer and Watcher. Willow makes a needless guest appearance to help re-ensoul Angel. She spends most of her time lusting after Fred instead (wasn't she supposed to be falling for Kennedy at that time?)Julie Benz as Darla makes a guest appearance to try to persuade Connor not to kill an innocent young girl at Cordelia's behest, so that Cordelia can bring her child into the world immediately. Darla is unsuccessful and so Jasmine is born. Of course, nobody ever throws Connor's part in that poor girl's murder in his face. This is one of the show's inconsistencies that really annoys at times. Why should Faith go to prison for something Connor gets away with? Why must Angel atone for Angelus's killings, while Connor, who is not being controlled by a demon, can kill innocents yet be protected by his father and friends?Most of the non-Jasmine and non-Angelus episodes were fairly weak also. I'm never a big fan of amnesia spells (too much like old cartoons), and Buffy had already done this idea better than it was performed on Angel. The character of Gwen with a superhero power of electricity and a superhero costume was introduced, but then never much followed up on. She eventually had a one-stand with Gunn, though it had been Angel whom she had first been interested in. At least the Gwen episodes had a minimum of Connor.The worst aspect of season four was what they did to Cordelia, once the show's best character. They turned her into a mere tool, a puppet of Jasmine's. If they had actually made the character Cordelia evil, I still wouldn't have liked it, but at least viewers could have responded to her as Cordelia. When they tell you that Cordelia's body is doing terrible things, but the real Cordelia is just in limbo somewhere, what is your reaction? Mine was frustration and annoyance.I enjoy parts of season four because of the continuation of the development of the Wesley and Fred characters, and because it's enjoyable to watch the train wreck of Wesley's relationship with Lilah grow. It's always good to see a little of the true Angelus, though as I said he could have been better. A lot of the individual scenes throughout the season are good, it's just the stories as a whole that disappoint.",3,The only really bad season of a good show,1153180800,"07 18,

Each episode had a cliff hanger, I spent many a Wednesday night not falling asleep until 3am because I was so wound up about what they would do next episode.Connor is indeed a very annoying character, but I thought that was okay, every show needs at one character for the audience to hate.  Cordelia sleeping with Connor was on of the grossest moments on TV in recent memory, but I understand the need for it to further the plot.The biggest weakness in the season is the absence of Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) in the last five episodes. A show without it's leading lady is lacking and that is just what Charisma was (as evidenced by her presence on all four DVD covers behind David/Angel, compared to the Buffy DVD covers where the characters change each set). The second biggest weakness is the Jasmine storyline, which starts right as Cordelia goes into a coma. Pay no attetion to the reviews dissing Charisma as the weakness in the acting this season, she can act circles around J August Richards and Amy Acker.  And to anyone who still insists she couldn't deliver as Evil Cordelia, hey you try to give your best performance when you are several months pregnant, until then get off her back.This season is 17 dramatic heart pounding episodes of TV, the last five episodes fall flat.

833887,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0002HS74C,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[4, 6]","Depending on your tastes and preferences, the forth season of ""Angel"" (chronicling the adventures of the vampire-with-a-soul in Los Angeles), is the season where the show finally hit its stride, or began to go belly-up. For the past three seasons the episodes have been rather episodic; as part of a supernatural organization that investigates paranormal phenomena (with vampire-slaying on the side) Angel and his team; ex-cheerleader and present-seer Cordelia Chase, intellectual scholar Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, former street-kid Charles Gunn, karaoke-demon Lorne and physicist Winifred ""Fred"" Burkle, who spent five years trapped in a demon-dimension, have all joined together to form a surrogate family and fight the good fight against the forces of evil.But Season Three introduced several new components into the mix; predominantly that of Conner, Angel's teenage son. Born out of a mysterious union between two vampires (Angel and Darla; a seemingly impossible occurrence) Conner was kidnapped by an old foe of Angel, taken to a demon dimension and returned in what was years for Conner, but mere weeks for Angel and the gang. Disillusioned and bitter towards his father, the season ended with Conner turning on Angel and sinking him to the bottom of the ocean in an iron box. Meanwhile, Cordelia was taken in a quite different direction; after the pain of her physic visions became too great for her to bear and she was made part-demon, she ascended into a higher plane of existence in the season finale. With Angel and Cordelia missing, Lorne off to Las Vegas, and Wesley estranged from the group, Fred and Gunn are left to run the detective agency on their own.With the group split up, the first prerogative of Season Four is to reunite all our main characters. Without giving away too many details, we eventually get our gang together again, with one major problem: Cordelia is returned to them without any memory of her life - and perhaps something else is wrong with her too. In attempting to restore the lost affection and dynamics within his self-created family, Angel embarks on a personal quest to restore his son, his love and his friends to him. This is a little tricky what with the latest apocalypse hitting L.A., complete with fire falling from the sky, an eclipse blotting out the sun, and a giant beast stalking the streets of the city.Season Four boasts a cohesive and intricate storyline, in which practically each episode picks up directly after the one before. Expectations are continuously undercut, there are twists and turns galore, every character gets their dark side tapped into, and we get plenty of treats: the return of Faith (not seen since a brief cameo in season two of ""Angel""), the return of Angelus, the surprising deaths of a few major characters (not that that's technically a *good* thing, but it's always good when a show isn't afraid to use death as a legitimate consequence), a cameo role from Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and some really nifty special effects - although they did go a bit overboard on the slow-motion scenes.Angel's extended family has always been a bit more tempestuous than the Scooby Gang on its sister-show ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". When Buffy fights with her friends, it tends to get resolved by the end of the episode. When Angel's friends fight, it can be several weeks before reconciliation is made, and as such Angel's desperation to keep his loved ones together (and more often than not, failing in this respect) is heart-rending. This season also brings the subject of fate to the forefront, a theme that has run throughout all previous seasons (and even back into the third season of ""Buffy"" - think back to the snowfall in the pivotal-episode ""Amends"" - who do you think was responsible for it now?) This age-old question that hangs over humanity; whether we are subject to fate or in control of our own destinies - is handled with incredible depth. In the black void that is mindless Hollywood movies these days, it's good to know that lowly television shows can tap into the human psyche and condition. Does the loss of free will justify world peace? Are we bound by fate or do we have a choice? Is the saving of many lives worth the sacrifice of one innocent one? Just a few questions that the show raises and deals with in mature and surprising ways.On the other hand, there were several elements of this season that didn't mesh well, much to the distress of the fans. The relationship of Angel and Cordelia has always been the backbone of the show, and their platonic friendship has been a delight to watch develop over the course of three seasons. Unfortunately, making Angel romantically interested in Cordelia opens up a whole new can of worms (the least of which is how Angel planned to pursue any kind of long-term relationship with Cordelia when he is a vampire, and she isn't; not to mention Buffy, his son, his immortality, and the curse on his soul that has dire consequences should he ever experience a moment of true happiness). The fact that the writers ignored every single one of these factors in their treatment of the relationship was frustrating to say the least, resulting in the taking of the strongest platonic male/female friendship on either show (I don't count Willow/Xander/Buffy considering their friendship began as a love triangle) and turning it into a weird and twisted Oedipal mess. Maybe I'm just watching the wrong shows, but I'm constantly annoyed to find a complete lack of straight male/female platonic friendships on television. It is possible to love someone of the opposite sex without falling in love with them - Angel and Cordelia were the perfect example of this till Season Four.Ruining the established friendship between the two of them by forcing them into a romantic relationship one was of several odd choices made in the latter half of the season, along with turning the potentially tragic figure of Conner into a whiny teenager and pulling a three-sixty with Cordelia's character. Apparently actress Charisma Carpenter's unannounced pregnancy threw a spanner in the works for the writers of the show, forcing them to introduce a new antagonist for the Gang to fight whilst rendering Cordelia incapacitated - ultimately resulting in Charisma's exclusion from Season Five.But of course, this is all my opinion. From another point of view, all these elements could be seen as the best parts of the season - that's the tricky thing about writing reviews, they are entirely subjective! And for all its flaws, there were some undeniably fantastic elements: the use of Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, taking the once-comic figure into a new realm of darkness, the epic quality that the show began to take, the character development that Gunn and Fred (finally!) get, and a season finale that foreshadows the possibilities of Season Five with a strange new opportunity for Angel and the gang to take...",3,"""You Have to Believe that there are People Who Love You...""",1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,6910,"['Depending', 'tastes', 'preferences', 'forth', 'season', 'Angel', 'chronicling',

833888,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002HS74C,Robert Moore,"[206, 222]","Warning:  Multiple SpoilersOf the seven seasons of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and the five seasons of ANGEL, the former's seventh season and the latter's fourth season were the most frustrating, and most flawed.  Many things were spectacularly well done, but there were also ill judged story arcs that threatened to undermine all the good things in the season.  It would not be wrong to say that Season Four contained many of the best things ever witnessed in either show, as well as some of the worst things.What went right?  The year started with perhaps the most extraordinary episode in the history of the series, &quot;Deep Down.&quot;  At the end of Season Three, Connor had taken what he imagined to be revenge on Angel for the death of his foster father Holtz by locking Angel in a heavy metal cage, and dropping it into the Pacific Ocean.  The new season begins with a fantasy sequence in which Angel imagines himself to be at a dinner with all his friends, Connor included, only to awaken to realize he was still on the bottom of the ocean.  Luckily, his estranged colleague Wesley has undertaken the search for Angel, and eventually manages to locate where he has been dropped.  Throughout the season we get the same conflicted, tormented, alienated Wesley we saw at the end of Season Four, and his character is far and away one of the finest things of the season.What else went right?  The season was far less episodic than any of the five seasons of the show.  TV execs hate long story arcs, but there is no question that from an aesthetic point of view long arcs make a better show.  There is a sense in which Season Four was one long story.  Additionally, there was a great new and underutilized character in Alexa Davalos's Gwen Raiden, an outstanding bad guy in &quot;the Beast&quot; (impressively played by towering Czech actor Vladimir Kulich), and a fantastic three-episode arc featuring Eliza Dushku as Faith.  The special effects were as good as anything ever seen in television, including some eerie sequences in which it literally rains fire from the sky and the sun is blackened out in L.A.  We also witnessed what may have been the funniest episode in the history of the show (with the possible exception of Season Five's &quot;Smile Time&quot;), the outrageously funny &quot;Spin the Bottle.&quot;  And Angelus returned for a few episodes.  The high points were very high indeed.In the light of all these delights, what was it that made it a flawed season?  First and foremost, an extraordinary error in concocting the character widely known as &quot;Evil Cordy.&quot;  For whatever demented reason, it was decided originally to make Cordelia the &quot;big bad&quot; of Season Four, a plan that had to be scraped when Charisma Carpenter became pregnant in real life.  Since her baby was due at about the time when she would have been required to fight Angel, keeping the original story arc was clearly impossible.  Fans will recall that at the end of Season Three, Cordelia had been made a &quot;higher being.&quot;  In Season Four we would have found that she had been more or less duped, and would be hijacked by evil entities that would return her to do battle with Angel.  Instead, they changed the story by having her have sex with Connor (&quot;yeeecccch&quot;) and becoming pregnant with his child, who turned out to be not a child but a full grown goddess with a penchant for eating people.  For me this very nearly killed all the good things in the season, since I absolutely loved Cordy's transformation from school snob early in BUFFY to heroine who made extraordinary sacrifices in her willingness to fight the good fight.  I thought this a horrible misuse of her character.  A second major problem with Season Four was Connor, a character that was never very well conceived and never well written.  He never really gelled with the rest of the cast, and most of his scenes felt like interruptions in the action.  And on top of all this, he had sex with Cordy (&quot;yeeecccch&quot;).  It was no surprise when he was nudged out of the show at season's end.  The third major flaw in the season was the character of Jasmine (played by the usually marvelous Gina Torres, who I loved in Whedon's Sci-Fi Western that year, FIREFLY).  I and many other ANGEL fans found the episodes featuring Jasmine to be utterly unpleasant.  Everyone becomes a mindless automaton, blindly serving her needs unless accidentally contaminated with her blood, Fred first, and then Angel, and eventually the others.  This was a story line that was developed in the wake of the discovery of Charisma's pregnancy, and it did have the feeling of something that was grafted onto the season, and not an integral part of it.So, of all the years of ANGEL, this is the one with more fantastically great and horribly wretched elements.  Nonetheless, it still was one of the three or four best shows on television this particular season (2002-2003), matched in my opinion by BUFFY (which suffered its own most flawed season), the prematurely cancelled FIREFLY, and the also tragically cancelled FARSCAPE.  Which is to say that warts and all, it remains essential viewing.The Season Four set, which has been previously released in most of the world's regions, contains the largest set of special features yet.",5,Brilliant but flawed - but still essential,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,5308,"['Warning', 'Multiple', 'SpoilersOf', 'seven', 'seasons', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'five', 'seasons',

833889,A29CWGLEAS9AUN,B0002HS74C,"R. Seehausen ""aeroblaster2""","[28, 33]","If there's one thing the fourth season of Angel does, it's wear you out.  It moves from one ""oh my God, what are they going to do?"" to the next, and by the time you reach the halfway mark of the season, you're just begging the writers to let up and give you some respite from the rollercoaster ride of emotion.It's a profoundly disturbing season, and achieves horror in a way that neither Angel or Buffy ever have.  Joss Whedon calls it emotional horror, the horror that comes not from having a scary thing pop around a corner or blood and guts splattered all over the pavement, but rather from characters we know and love having terrible things happen to them and acting in awful ways.This isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It's a draining, exhausting thing, but it's not necessarily bad.What is bad is the disjointed, messy plot of the season.  In a season that has almost no episodes that stand on their own, outside of the plot, it's devastating that the plot is never clear and never makes sense.It's not all the writers' fault.  It was a troublesome season of television for both Buffy and Angel--Joss Whedon was off working on Firefly, and both shows suffered from difficulties regarding their regular actors.  In Angel's case, the primary problem was Charisma Carpenter's (Cordelia) pregnancy.  You get the sense that it forced the writers to make changes in the story on the fly, breaking earlier plotting and destroying an already convoluted and overly complex storyline.The season isn't all lows, don't get me wrong.  It is a thrill ride, jumping from one horrific situation to the next, each further pounding the Fang Gang into the ground.  The Beast remains, in my opinion, one of the most effectively frightening villains in the history of the Buffyverse.  Connor, while easy to loathe, is also fascinating in a sick, voyeuristic sort of way.  Other villains, including (and especially) the return of an old ""friend"", provide even more horror and difficulty, mostly in a very entertaining fashion.And the season starts out at top form.  The resolution to the cliffhanger that ended season three, ""Deep Down"", was nearly perfect, answering most of the immediate questions from last season and leaving more open to explore throughout season 4.  What follows is a short series of excellent stand-alone episodes (including the introduction of the fascinating, X-Men-esque Gwen) before Cordelia's inevitable return and the start of the season's thrill ride of a plot.But the season's conclusion, which spans over four or five episodes, is terrible.  The explanation for the convoluted storyline of the season is insufficient to say the least, and if it doesn't leave you confused, it'll still leave you gaping in disbelief.  Not disbelief at any sort of surprise, but disbelief that the writers would explain things in such an inept and inadequate fashion.But the season doesn't end there.  It runs off into something entirely different in tone and unrelated to the type of emotional horror we've been constantly experiencing, and only loosely tied (by the previously mentioned inadequate explanation) to the previous events of the season.  It's, if anything, even more disturbing, but in a way that will leave you more detached and confused than involved and frightened.And once that ends, a completely unexpected and completely unrelated season finale caps off the season with even more confusion.  It seems to serve only as a jumping point for the fifth season, which it serves as adequately (despite initial disbelief in the plausibility of a certain law firm's motivations).  What it doesn't do is give us anymore satisfaction than the already unsatisfying ending provided in the episode preceding it.It's a shame this season was such a mess.  It showed great promise, and perhaps if the writers had gotten a clear, well-developed plot worked out and stuck with it all the way through, it would have been one of the best and most disturbing seasons of Angel or Buffy.  As it stands, it's only a testament to the disorganized nature of both Buffyverse shows' writing staffs during this tumultuous season of television, a season that produced two of the weakest season plot arcs (this season of Angel and Buffy's corresponding season 7) ever to grace a Joss Whedon show.Is it worth the money?  Yes, because the journey is intense and contains many entertaining and worthwhile developments, and is written well other than the convuluted season's plot.  The cast also gives it their all, with the possible exception of Charisma Carpenter, whose lackluster performance in the second half of the season can be excused by her advanced pregnancy and the ridiculousness of the plotline forced upon her character.All of that said, I hold the opinion that this was the worst season of Angel, never delivering on its promises or matching its suspense and intensity with clarity and logical plotting.  Buffy and Angel fans, buy it and enjoy the intense journey, but be forewarned about the lackluster plot and do not expect a satisfying conclusion.  It will leave you disappointed.",3,An exhausting thrill ride or a muddled mess?,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,5080,"['one', 'thing', 'fourth', 'season', 'Angel', 'out', 'one', 'oh', 'God', 'what',

833891,A3A2SQ9DK6LFEW,B0002HS74C,"Scott ""Degrassi fan""","[7, 10]","I appreciate what Joss Whedon & Co. did with this season. While most trace the events of 'a year in the life of its characters', most of what occurs here is in the span of a few weeks. After Cordelia's ascension and Angel's trip to the bottom of the ocean, nothing really gets back to normal for the gang, even when they both return. Cordelia can't remember who she is or what happened to her, and that includes the romantic feelings Cordy and Angel shared. However, Angel does... Soon enough, the sky begins to rain fire and the impending apocalypse is upon them. Things don't get any better when Cordelia and Connor 'hook up', sending chills down the spines of fans everywhere, and eventually, Cordy rapidly becomes pregnant with Connor's 'child'. What is it about mystical pregnancies in the Buffyverse? When Angel reverts to his former self, Angelus, Faith is called in to help bring him back. It's great to see Faith back in action before heading to Sunnydale with Willow to help Buffy and the Potentials fight The First. The season wraps up with Fred and Gunn's relationship falling apart and Wesley expresses interest in Fred. And of course, Cordelia gives birth, setting off a chain of events that leads to Angel wiping away Connor's memory and everyone's knowledge of him. Meanwhile, Cordy is in a coma. Soooo much happens this season. If one missed an episode it was hard to tell just what was going on.

833892,A30X7VQZILMFZT,B0002HS74C,Sertorius,"[6, 8]","Despite some glaring weaknesses this was a brilliant season of Angel, and I am truly torn between a 4 and 5 star review (4.5 stars, if possible). On the action/adventure/epic front the show has never been better, with an engaging and consistent story arc, punctuated by some of the best fight scenes and special effects ever seen in the Jossverse. The season tracks the course of a powerful entity's attempt to incarnate itself and gain control of the world, through an intricate plan, which entangles Connor, Cordelia, a powerful (and very effective) demon called the Beast, Angel(us) and to a lesser extent the rest of the team.Unfortunately the grinding wheels of the oncoming Apocalypse dwarf the sophisticated human interactions and subtle character development that were always a hallmark of Angel. Connor, who displayed intriguing potential in season 3, becomes a whiny, annoying nuisance. The less said about Cordelia in this season the better, but suffice to say that the character was literally sacrificed to the plot and Charisma Carpenter lacked the acting range to make the transition credible. Gunn, Fred and Lorne all have brief moments in the sun, but ultimately there is very little change for any of them beyond Fred and Gunn's messy breakup and post-homicidal angst. To be fair there was some attempt to triage the Gunn situation towards the end of the season, with an acknowledgement by the writers that he was being treated as the 'muscle' by the rest of the team, but it was no enough to advance the character significantly. Only Wesley, who is even better at dark, brooding heroism than Angel, emerges with some degree of grace (particularly in his scenes with Wolfram & Hart's delicious Lilah), though not to the standard of his amazing work in the previous season. There is little real development on the Angel front in season 4, but for the particular treat of the return of Angel's evil alter ego Angelus, though the character was somewhat blunted by the decision to keep him (somewhat implausibly) from killing any humans. Angelus' best moments are (in a Hannibal Lector turn) when he proceeds to verbally tear team Angel apart; upon his escape he becomes far less intelligent and effective.I know that I must seem overly harsh for a 4 star review so I would like to emphasize that what worked in this season worked very well. On my first viewing on regular television I was bowled over. It was only when I watched the DVD's that I began to discern the flaws that I describe (particularly after previously rewatching Angel Season 3 and Buffy Season 5).

A conveluted plot which is impossiblely difficult to follow or fully understand without a second viewing doesn't help.In Angel/Buffy you know you have run out of plot ideas when you have essentially repeated a plot being Angelus, they ran out of ideas and had to bring back the bad Angel.  Buffy Season 2 we see Angel become Angelus, we see it later in flashbacks and single episodes where either Angel fakes being Angelus or has some temporary affliction, or whatever.  By Season 4 this was tired, and its dragged out this season and its tired, it gets really tired.Conner is one of the worst concieved characters in either series and his place this season is prominent making this season even worse.I would like to mention 2 strong points of this season and it deals with relationships with some of the characters namely Wesley's relationship with Liliah and Angel's relationship with Faith. Faith and Liliah are not main characters in Angel but they offer the most interesting aspects of this season, both are missed in Season 5 (though Season 5 is so good they aren't missed that much).  Whith Wesley and Liliah we see a relationship that shouldn't happen but does, and the two have great chemistry, with Angel and Faith we see two people who have dark sides trying in their own way of saving one another, I only had wished their had been more Faith on Angel as opposed to Buffy Season 7 where she was totally misused and had no hope in saving the awful mess that was Buffy Season 7.",3,Weakness of Season 3 gets worse this season,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,1586,"['think', 'most', 'objective', 'Angel', 'fans', 'would', 'say', 'far', 'weakest', '5', 'seasons', 'Angel', 'A', 'conveluted', 'plot', 'impossiblely', 'difficult', 'follow', 'fully', 'understand', 'second', 'viewing', ""n't"", 'help.In', 'Angel/Buffy', 'know', 'have', 'run', 'plot', 'ideas', 'when', 'have', 'essentially', 'repeated', 'plot', 'being', 'Angelus', 'ran', 'ideas', 'had', 'bring', 'back', 'bad', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'Season', '2', 'see', 'Angel', 'become', 'Angelus', 'see', 'later', 'flashbacks', 'single', 'episodes', 'where', 'Angel', 'fakes', 'being', 'Angelus', 'temporary', 'affliction', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'tired', 'dragged', 'out', 'season', 'tired', 'really', 'one', 'worst', 'concieved', 'characters', 'series', 'place', 'season', 'prominent', 'making', 'season', 'even', 'would', 'like', 'mention', '2', 'strong', 'points', 'season', 'relationships', 'characters', 'namely', 'Wesley', 'relationship', 'Liliah', 'Angel', 'relationship', 'Faith', 'Faith', 'Liliah', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'Angel', 'offer', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'season', 'are', 'missed', 'Season', '5', 'Season', '5', 'so', 'good', 'are', ""n't"", 'missed', 'that', 'much', 'Whith', 'Wesley', 'Liliah', 'see', 'relationship', 'should', ""n't"", 'happen', 'two', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Angel', 'Faith', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'dark', 'sides', 'trying', 'own', 'way', 'saving', 'one', 'only', 'had', 'wished', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'Faith', 'Angel', 'opposed', 'Buffy', 'Season', '7', 'where', 'was', 'totally', 'misused', 'had', 'hope', 'saving', 'awful', 'mess', 'was', 'Buffy', 'Season', '7']",N/A

833895,A2WS9FE0NRXAFB,B0002HS74C,Shi Feng,"[5, 9]","alot of people who give this season low ratings just doesn't seem to understand it, but wholly grades it depends on whether he or she enjoyed the show or not and failed to see the brilliancy and deeper meanings that's revealed in the show.1. Connor's character- I understand why Connor isn't a likeable character. with rest of the gang being cool Connor just doesn't seem to fit it. And it is true that he is very annoying. BUT if you really think about it. Connor's character is absolutely brilliant. because he represented a typical confused teenager. because he is Angel's son, we expected him to be as cool as Angel. but he can never be because he doesn't know as much as Angel. That's one thing I like about the show, that Angel and rest of the gane have reasons to be cool. for example, Angel, his living of 200 years gives him wisdom. wherase Connor did not even live in the world, not to mention 200 years. Connor's relationship with Cordelia is like exactly what a confused, rebellious teenager would do when they feel like they don't have anything- get an obsession and stick to it. Connor's always wanting to kill Angel is another thing- he's ashamed of Angel by his vampiric condition, but because Angel is good, he can't even kill him and be proud, so he kept looking for a reason to kill Angel so to prove that he's right. Connor is actually a really sympathetic character and a very important one because he represented sooo many things.2. the sex between Connor and Cordelia- Again I understand why it is disgusting. but if you really think about it, if Connor is with any other girl he would still have the age problem. so how is Cordeia any different??? because she used to change Connor's diper??? well how is Connor gonna remember that??? And besides, the reason Connor had sex with Cordelia was because the world seems to end. people do crazy things when they are facing death and the end of the world, they would think nothing matters anymore. that's what it was like when Connor had sex with Cordelia, that he thought the world was gonna end so nothing really matters anymore. the sex takes place while the sky was raining fire is just beautiful to me, beautiful in an ironic way that is.3. Jasmine- alot of people say that Jasmine is such a bad villian. but Jasmine isn't a villian at all. She is beyond a villian, she is the apocalypse. What she does cannot be defined in a way of good or evil. According to Jasmine, she was to bring paradise to this world and all the ""evil"" she has done is just things nesssary to her plan, or nessary sacrifice. Angel stoped her only to do what he knows he must, which is to avert the apocalypse.4. someone said about Darla should be part of Connor's new family- but that would be completely empty if that happened. one thing that's really good about this show is that everything has an ending. if Darla was with Connor in his new family, than the whole Darla's death would be meaningless.Anyways, I just want to list the episodes I feel is particular strong: Deep Down, Slouching Toward Bethlehem, Spin the Bottle, Apocalypse Nowish, Habeas Corpses, Awakening, Soulless, Orpheus and Home.overall, season four is depressing, it's true- well it's suppose to be, it's about the apocalypse!!!!

This season has been described by the show's creators as ""a 22-part episode"". There are far fewer stand-alone episodes in this season than ever before. The familiar monster-of-the-week episodes of seasons past are mostly gone. Instead, there is the dense, more structured story arc of the season.The season picks up three months after the events of last season's finale: Cordelia is still on a higher plane of existence, Angel is still at the bottom of the ocean, Wesley is still sleeping with Lilah as she tries to recruit him to Wolfram and Hart, Connor is still seething with vengeance and hatred, and Fred and Gunn are still wondering where everybody went. Wesley is reintroduced into the fold after aiding in Angel's rescue, and the story arc of the season kicks off as Cordelia is finally ""rescued"" from the higher plane...with no memory. Her amnesia is eventually cleared up, but not until after she has slept with Connor. And then, the Beast rises.Clawing his way to the surface of Los Angeles at the very spot where Connor was born, the Beast begins hunting the totems of the Ra-tet, five mystical beings linked to the sun god. He combines their essences to block out the sun, and the only discernible way to fight him is to unleash Angel's monstrous alter ego Angelus, who has a connection to the Beast. However, he escapes, prompting the release of Faith from prison and the mystical services of Willow. Eventually, however, one figures out that the Beast is simply a pawn in a much larger scheme, a scheme being perpetrated from within the Angel Investigations team. This scheme brings forth the season's true villain: Jasmine, a higher power whose goal is an end to war and suffering...at the expense of freedom of choice.This season's story arc truly demonstrates that this is television that makes you think. The villains challenge your conceptions of good and evil, and you look at characters in entirely different ways because of some of the choices they make. Eventually, the season culminates in a choice, a choice that sets the stage for the excellent final season.Angel Season 4 was not pretty. It was difficult to watch and difficult to handle, and was much, much darker than anything the show had ever done before. But it was good. My god, was it good.

833900,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0002HS74C,Tom Benton,"[6, 7]","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN*I watched the fourth season of ANGEL with an open mind.  Many a fan had declared it to be the worst season of the show.  I was prepared for a weak season.  So naturally I was surprised when the season premiere, ""Deep Down"", was fantastic.  I was even more surprised to find that the next few episodes were excellent as well.  Though I'd always enjoyed this show, season four was when I realized just what an outstanding series it was.As Joss Whedon stated in an interview, the theme of this season is trust.  Though there's always immense character development in Whedon's shows, there is more going on with the characters in this season than in any other.  Relationships are built, destroyed, and rebuilt.  The character who is most interesting this season is, in my opinion, Wesley (Alexis Denisof).  Wesley has gone from a clumsy, stuck-up nerd (as he was portrayed on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and in the first season of ANGEL) to a tough, resourceful, clever fighter.  At the very start of this season, Wesley rescues Angel (David Boreanaz) from his tomb at the bottom of the sea.  Angel still can't bring himself to forgive Wesley for handing over Angel's son to Holtz, and neither can anyone else; this leads to Wesley going solo and becoming a sort of outcast from the Angel Investigations gang.  Throughout this season, Wesley deals with Gunn's (J. August Richards) relationship with Fred (Amy Acker), while developing a bizarre relationship of his own with Wolfram & Hart lawyer Lilah (Stephanie Romanov).  Angel tries to bond with his son, Connor (Vincent Kartheiser), while an amnesiac Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) appears.And this is all within the first five episodes.There's more plot twists in this season than in any other.  It's simply astonishing.  BUFFY fans will be intrigued by the occasional connections this season makes to the seventh and final season of BUFFY, which was airing at the same time as this season.  The magnificent season finale, ""Home"", not only connects with the final episode of BUFFY, but sets it up.  (""Home"" is also fan favorite writer/director Tim Minear's final episode on the show.)  As I've mentioned, there's shocking character developments.  There's also a very interesting storyline for this season (or should I say storylines - there's about three).  These include the mysterious return of Cordelia and its affect on Angel and Connor; the apocalyptic pandemonium in Los Angeles, brought about by the sudden appearance of ""The Beast"" (Vladimir Kulich); and the birth of Jasmine (FIREFLY's Gina Torres), a deity who seems too good to be true.However, as many fans have pointed out, this season has its share of flaws.  The storyline had to be quickly altered to fit in with Charisma Carpenter's sudden pregnancy, and it shows.  Mankind's reaction to some of the events depicted toward the end of the season seems very unrealistic.  The character of Connor is poorly written and quickly becomes irritating.  I believe that these flaws, however, are easy to overlook, as there's much more good in this season than bad.  There are a variety of memorable sequences, particularly the closing from the season finale.  The cast is excellent, primarily David Boreanaz in his scenes as Angelus.  The directing is top-notch (Sean Astin - Sam from the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy - directs one of the episodes).  The writing is excellent and original, as is evident in episodes such as Joss Whedon's ""Spin the Bottle"".  Also, there's great music by Rob Kral, which really adds to this season's wonderfully dark, apocalyptic mood.Despite its flaws, ANGEL's fourth season is an excellent one.

833901,AE1OP60IC5O82,B0002HS74C,truster38,"[10, 11]","Season Four of, as Tim Minear puts it, TV's Angel, is an exercise of brilliance as the result of necessity.  Sometime before or during the beginning of Season Four, Charisma Carpenter came to the writers with some news that undoubtedly threw a wrench in their plans for the season: she was pregnant.  After the intense events depicted the season before, what were the writers supposed to do?  This was the season where Angel had to be brought back from his ocean-depth tomb, as well paying off Cordelia's ""ascension"" as a higher being.  The results should be taught to aspiring students in film school as a how to on contigency planning.  Season Four was action-packed.  It was hair raising, suprising, edge-of-your-seat television.  If Season Three was Angel's perfectly structured high point, then Season Four was the go for broke roller coaster ride.  Joss Whedon shows are full of surprises but Season Four takes the metaphorical ""holy crap I can't wait for next week!"" cake.  I know that ""the couple"" (that's all I'm gonna say, I don't want to be a spoiler for potential buyers) turned many stomachs, but the actors who played the roles were just brilliant.  ""She"" showed a darkness that rivaled Alyson Hannigan's Darlene-a-thon in Season Six of Buffy, while ""he"" is often unfairly maligned but is really a great actor, giving us a complex, nuanced performace.  The DVDs themselves are quite good, with a transfer that is lush and full-looking.  And the extras are plentiful, with commentaries by both Alexis Denisof and Andy Hallett (that's more than Buffy's actor commentary count of one,  ironically courtesy of the exited Seth Green).  There are many other commentaries by the staff, including the always entertaining Steven S. DeKnight and Tim Minear (and, obviously, Joss).  There a lot of information to digest this season for newbies, but if you're hungry for truly epic television, it's worth it to do the homework.",5,"Epic, Expansive and Brilliant",1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,1929,"['Season', 'Four', 'Tim', 'Minear', 'TV', 'Angel', 'exercise', 'brilliance', 'result', 'necessity', 'Sometime', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Four', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'came', 'writers', 'news', 'undoubtedly', 'threw', 'wrench', 'plans', 'season', 'was', 'pregnant', 'intense', 'events', 'depicted', 'season', 'what', 'were', 'writers', 'supposed', 'do', 'was', 'season', 'where', 'Angel', 'had', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'ocean-depth', 'tomb', 'as', 'well', 'paying', 'off', 'Cordelia', 'ascension', 'higher', 'being', 'results', 'should', 'be', 'taught', 'aspiring', 'students', 'film', 'school', 'how', 'contigency', 'planning', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'action-packed', 'was', 'hair', 'raising', 'suprising', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'television', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'Angel', 'perfectly', 'structured', 'high', 'point', 'then', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'go', 'broke', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'shows', 'are', 'full', 'surprises', 'Season', 'Four', 'metaphorical', 'holy', 'crap', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'week', 'cake', 'know', 'couple', ""'m"", 'gon', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoiler', 'potential', 'buyers', 'turned', 'many', 'stomachs', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'roles', 'were', 'just', 'brilliant', 'showed', 'darkness', 'rivaled', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Darlene-a-thon', 'Season', 'Six', 'Buffy', 'often', 'unfairly', 'maligned', 'really', 'great', 'actor', 'giving', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'performace', 'DVDs', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'transfer', 'lush', 'full-looking', 'extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'commentaries', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'Andy', 'Hallett', 'more', 'Buffy', 'actor', 'commentary', 'count', 'one', 'ironically', 'courtesy', 'exited', 'Seth', 'Green', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'commentaries', 'staff', 'including', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Steven', 'S.', 'DeKnight', 'Tim', 'Minear', 'obviously', 'Joss', 'lot', 'information', 'digest', 'season', 'newbies', ""'re"", 'hungry', 'truly', 'epic', 'television', 'worth', 'do', 'homework']",N/A
