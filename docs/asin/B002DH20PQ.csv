It contains 94 shows (30 min less commercials).  It is a black and white series, but the picture is crisp and clear.  Occasionally a plot is a bit corny, but not to much so that you don't enjoy watching.  We haven't completed them all yet, but are very pleased with the quality and have enjoyed the ones we have seen.  Remember the times and expect plots, etc, from those years (i.e. Gunsmoke)  and you will not be disappointed.  McQueen had a rough upbringing and was difficult to work with.  However, he was popular with the public and became the highest paid actor of his time (died age 50 of lung cancer).  It was good to see his early work and to see other familiar actors in their youth.",5,Wanted Dead Or Alive - The Complete Seriers,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,814,"['TV', 'show', 'youth', '1958-1961', 'made', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'star', 'bought', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', '94', 'shows', '30', 'min', 'less', 'commercials', 'black', 'white', 'series', 'picture', 'crisp', 'clear', 'Occasionally', 'plot', 'bit', 'corny', 'not', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'have', ""n't"", 'completed', 'yet', 'are', 'very', 'pleased', 'quality', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'Remember', 'times', 'expect', 'plots', 'etc', 'years', 'i.e', 'Gunsmoke', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'McQueen', 'had', 'rough', 'upbringing', 'was', 'difficult', 'work', 'However', 'was', 'popular', 'public', 'became', 'highest', 'paid', 'actor', 'time', 'died', 'age', '50', 'lung', 'cancer', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'early', 'work', 'see', 'other', 'familiar', 'actors', 'youth']",Wanted Dead or Alive - The Complete Series

The only thing is the show itself. Sometimes the show ended before it had a proper ending. The writers should have ended it with a resolution for every episode. Some had proper endings with a proper resolution. Some episodes had a ""I hopeso"" kind of ending. Now there's some of the titles. The writers titled some of the episode wrong. In ""The Littlest Client"" the girl was not Josh's littlest client. Jay North on ""Eight Cent Reward"" was the Littlest. I haven't watched all the episodes yet, but between the two Jay North was the littlest. Then there is the actors. Like ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and The Adventures of Superman"" they use the same actor as different characters. I hate that. My question is weren't there any other actors around back then to play the parts. I can understand ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" there not being enough actors considering it lasted 14 seasons, but with ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" lasting only 94 episodes I can't believe there weren't enough different actors to play the parts.

The obvious hook here is that the lead character is a bounty hunter, an occupation that is always portrayed as &#34;evil&#34; in other series.

It was one of his favorites, and it is one of mine too.  Josh Randall (McQueen) is a bounty hunter with a heart.  He is as fair and just as a judge, yet, can shoot his ""Mare's Leg"" (sawed off Winchester 1892 rifle) as deadly and as fast as anyone.  In each show he goes after a wanted criminal, and each episode is as unique as the one before, no two are the same.  The writers did a wonderfully creative job in crafting scripts that were exciting, dramatic, and realistic.  The episodes are only 26 minutes long each, so it is easy to sit down to watch one or more, and have some fine western style entertainment.  McQueen is excellent in this series, just a terrific actor, and I believe this show launched his career as a movie star.  As a fan of westerns, I find this show just as entertaining as ""Bonanza"", ""The Big Valley"", or ""Gunsmoke"", but with a slightly harder and more exciting edge.  It is also a treat to see the assortment of character actors appear in this show, such as Michael Landon, Jay North (Dennis the Menace), Noah Berry, Lon Chaney Jr., Jim Coburn, Alan Hale (Skipper from Gilligan), De Kelly (Bones from Star Trek), and William Schallert (the father from the Patty Duke Show).The entire series is in this well-made DVD set.  The tape transfer is not perfect, sometimes the sound is a bit uneven, but overall, for a show that aired over 60 years ago, I am impressed with the quality of the picture.

Mill Creek presents all 94 episodes for a more than reasonable price.Each episode is a taut half hour of action and entertainment lead by McQueen's magnetic character. He plays Randell as the quiet hero who chases his prey for the reward, but abides by his morels. It's facinating to watch McQueen act almost constantly, even when he's in the background. He finds the little quirks, reacting to coffee that's a little too hot, or doing a double take that draws you to his character.The transfers are crisp and clean, perhaps a little too clean as it reveals the limited budget of the series. As they used the same interior set for almost every town Randell visits, only changing the signs over the Saloon or Livery Stable. Randell also takes plenty of whacks to the head, so many that you wonder how he can think after a while. Like many movies and tv shows, ""Wanted"" plays around with history as the opening title card for the episode ""Double Fee"" states the year ""1871"" which is consistant with Randell occasional mentions of his service in the Confederate Army, but inconsistant with his 1892 Winchester and using the terms ""Oklahoma"", which didn't become a state until 1907. And the shows themselves vary in writing quality, which is to be expected over a 94 episode run. Yet the short running time also means that many of the episodes start in the middle of the action like ""Desert Seed"".We also see plenty of familiar faces, sometimes more than once each season as they began their acting careers. Warren Oates, James Coburn, Micheal Landon (as a bad guy no less in the first episode ""The Martin Poster"") Mary Tyler Moore, and Lee Van Cleef. Joining them are more established veterans like Kenneth Tobey (""The Thing from Another World""), the great Everett Sloan (""Citizen Kane"") and the not-as-yet Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy, DeForest Kelley.On the downside, the four ""special features"" are nothing of note. ""Reckless: The Women of Wanted"" is pure puffery covering only a few of the many female characters that appeared in the show. ""The Art of the Replica"" & ""Winchester: A Weapon of Legend"" are interesting, but have little to do with the series itself. ""The Mare's Leg"" is the only relavent feature as it deals with Randell's unique weapon. For what's it worth, it's better to build the ""Mare's Leg"" from scratch (that's legal), than to cut down an existing 1892 Winchester (that's illegal).The packaging is rather unique, all the DVDs are contained in individual sleeves and stuffed in the the center of the large, plastic case. This does have the advantage of bringing only one or two DVDs over to your buddies's place to watch.

1263403,AI0PV0FQLGEAY,B002DH20PQ,Natalie Dressed,"[5, 5]","I was just old enough to start noticing boys when Wanted: Dead or Alive began its run, so Steve McQueen caught my eye. His boyish looks, big sky-blue eyes, charming grin and lithe body were striking -- and oh my, that mare's leg rifle! I loved watching him saunter up to the bulletin board every week and rip that wanted poster off, then look at us with steely-eyed intent. Whoa! Sex appeal, presence and star power: Steve had it all even then.I matured enough along with the series to appreciate McQueen's acting style: spare, intense and so cool you could make ice cubes with it. And, he moved beautifully. His graceful athleticism enhanced his believability as an action hero; he rode horses, handled weapons and performed fight scenes with enviable skill. Despite the obvious back-lot sets, you believed he was bounty hunter Josh Randall, plying his notorious trade around the Old West.I hadn't seen Wanted: Dead or Alive since it ended in 1961, so being able to own and watch all 92 episodes now has been a treat. The show is as good and solid as I remembered it; so is McQueen, who launched his amazingly successful film career on its popularity and critical acclaim.Happily, the original negatives were preserved and have been properly handled for this DVD set. The black and white images are uniformly crisp and free of artifacts, and the monaural soundtrack is clean. The extras aren't much, but they do provide background material that should please old fans and enlighten new viewers. Wouldn't you like to know more about the mare's leg?IMO the best part about owning this collection is being able to observe McQueen's metamorphosis from novice performer into solid actor over a three-year period in chronological fashion. You can see him working hard to bring his nascent acting skills up to the bar set by the many great character actors that guest-starred on the show. It's interesting to watch him work with the likes of Noah Beery Jr., Joan Blondell, Lon Chaney Jr., John Dehner, John Carradine, James Coburn, Lee Van Cleef and William Schallert. Obviously, the kid studied up on their skills and scene-stealing bits of business. And it's fun to spot other young up-and-comers like Warren Oates, Cloris Leachman, Michael Landon, Richard Farnsworth and Mary Tyler Moore learning their craft in small roles.It's a shame that McQueen died too soon for us to know how he might have played character parts as he grew old, but the Wanted: Dead or Alive collection lets us see where and how he got his start. It's also a great way to ride again with Josh Randall, hunt down the bad guys and help the good folks get justice.

Color adds depth to each scene as well as the over all reality.Life is not in black and white...and never was.  The life of a cowboy was mostly outdoors, and people appreciated the beauty of scenery, sunsets, etc.The last season episodes leave a bit to be desired in terms of variation of story line.  It becomes the same old plot with nothing new.The first season was clearly the best.  My two favorite episodes were ""Till Death Do Us Part"" though the ending was silly and not believable.  The other episode about Christmas and a little boy wishing for a rifle to help his sheep rancher father was excellent and gave Steve McQueen a real chance to show his many talents.Many female Steve McQueen fans will lament that fact that as each season passed, there were fewer and fewer episodes where Josh Randal interacted with women.
