I'd say, this is a must-watch for all Americans.I'm really looking forward to watching the complete collection.BTW, this is a good price (it's higher on the PBS website)",5,A Must-Watch,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,641,"['have', 'seen', 'part', 'collection', 'first', '1', 'hour', 'FDR', 'life', 'incredibly', 'done', 'engaging', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'rest', 'have', 'also', 'watched', 'first', '2', 'hours', 'Truman', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'informative', 'life', 'family', 'childhood', 'personal', 'things', 'help', 'explain', 'how', 'made', 'decisions', 'where', 'was', 'coming', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'so', 'far', 'history', 'so', 'fascinating', 'so', 'incredibly', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'say', 'must-watch', 'Americans.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'complete', 'collection.BTW', 'good', 'price', 'higher', 'PBS', 'website']",American Experience: The Presidents Collection

Throw your others out (except the ones that have all the Presidents like PBS' wonderful American Presidents in 2000 and the History Channel's new comprehensive one).I still think LBJ is the most entertaining one.  But that owes a lot to the man himself.  So many crazy stories...And yes, I too wonder why Eisenhower wasn not included in this collection.  I already own all these (plus IKE); collecting them the hard way.Like another reviewer pointed out, the 20 Century is represented well, but remember: McKinley ushered in the 20th and thus should be included as well.  And not only are Taft, Coolidge, Hoover, Clinton missing... but don't forget Harding & Ford (although they are quite forgettable).I actually bought ""FRONTLINE: The Clinton Years"" from PBS as a placeholder until they do something better on Bill.",5,End-all Be-all,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,878,"['are', 'best', 'documentaries', 'Presidents', 'period', 'Throw', 'others', 'out', 'ones', 'have', 'Presidents', 'PBS', 'wonderful', 'American', 'Presidents', '2000', 'History', 'Channel', 'new', 'comprehensive', 'one', '.I', 'still', 'think', 'LBJ', 'most', 'entertaining', 'one', 'lot', 'man', 'So', 'many', 'crazy', 'stories', 'yes', 'too', 'wonder', 'why', 'Eisenhower', 'wasn', 'not', 'included', 'collection', 'already', 'own', 'IKE', 'collecting', 'hard', 'way.Like', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', '20', 'Century', 'represented', 'well', 'remember', 'McKinley', 'ushered', '20th', 'thus', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'Taft', 'Coolidge', 'Hoover', 'Clinton', 'missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Harding', 'Ford', 'are', 'quite', 'forgettable', '.I', 'actually', 'bought', 'FRONTLINE', 'Clinton', 'Years', 'PBS', 'placeholder', 'do', 'something', 'better', 'Bill']",American Experience: The Presidents Collection
1163336,A3OIH43KWWBNUP,B0019F02YE,smuthdude,"[39, 39]","Five stars on this series. As a history buff, I've found these are the only documentaries on the presidents that accurately portray both sides of these controversial, complex and powerful leaders.  It's a series of PBS documentaries that began in 1990 with David Grubin's ""LBJ"" and ended this spring (2008) with ""George H.W. Bush"".  Included in the series, but excluded from this set for some reason is the 1993 documentary on Dwight D. Eisenhower: ""IKE"", hosted by David McCollugh.  It was available several years ago in a box set with the other Republican presidents. But it seems to have vanished this time around. An oversight by PBS perhaps? Inability to obtain publication rights from the filmmaker?  Who knows? But its absence leaves a gaping hole in American presidential history that *seems* easily remedied. Fix that, and you've got a near perfect visual lesson on the presidency during the 20th century, sans presidents Taft, Hoover, Coolidge and Clinton.",5,Required viewing for all Americans.
