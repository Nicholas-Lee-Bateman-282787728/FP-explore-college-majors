TBJ is a crime film that never becomes tiresome mostly due to a fantastic emotionally alluring portrayal of a single mom by Joanne Whalley. She's your average girl stuck in a mess with a megalomaniac king pin. Fortunately for the viewer her body is not average, giving her character that added, ""I don't know I'm sexy"" vibe. Armand Assante turns in a great performance as he easily puts out charm and terror with a simple stoic glance. The root of the film which is the two worlds colliding, gets delivered with believability.The real gritty hoots of the film are William Hurt playing a twisted x cop that still has remnants of good in him and the ever delectable Kathleen Quinlan as a quirky sot. I really liked the script. The seedy undercurrent feel that the film has is captured with words that give an inner chuckle and a solid outer grimace. Some courtroom antics are quite stagey but those scenes can be muscled through if you like the genre. TBJ is not a routine crime thriller and throws some very interesting entertainment punches.",4,>Several veiwings good&lt;,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,1136,"['discovered', 'film', 'searching', 'laserdiscs', 'good', 'way', 'find', 'forgotten', 'gems', 'TBJ', 'crime', 'film', 'never', 'tiresome', 'mostly', 'due', 'fantastic', 'emotionally', 'alluring', 'portrayal', 'single', 'mom', 'Joanne', 'Whalley', 'average', 'girl', 'stuck', 'mess', 'megalomaniac', 'king', 'pin', 'Fortunately', 'viewer', 'body', 'not', 'average', 'giving', 'character', 'added', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'sexy', 'vibe', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'great', 'performance', 'easily', 'out', 'charm', 'terror', 'simple', 'stoic', 'glance', 'root', 'film', 'two', 'worlds', 'colliding', 'delivered', 'believability.The', 'real', 'gritty', 'hoots', 'film', 'are', 'William', 'Hurt', 'playing', 'twisted', 'x', 'cop', 'still', 'remnants', 'good', 'ever', 'delectable', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'quirky', 'sot', 'really', 'liked', 'script', 'seedy', 'undercurrent', 'feel', 'film', 'captured', 'words', 'give', 'inner', 'chuckle', 'solid', 'outer', 'grimace', 'courtroom', 'antics', 'are', 'quite', 'stagey', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'muscled', 'like', 'genre', 'TBJ', 'not', 'routine', 'crime', 'thriller', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertainment', 'punches']",N/A

I'm sorry there are less than 10 reviews here by 2009.  I guess most people don't share my high opinion of this film.There isn't as much violence as most modern-day crime movies and that's fine because this story doesn't need it. The profanity is also lower-than-normal. All that's missing is better cinematography.Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Armand Assante, Gabriel Byrne and William Hurt all make this interesting and provide good performances. This is a good ""date movie,"" too.

120599,A1123L7ANYUTG0,0790750643,Hugo 77,"[1, 3]","--And not because of the script or the premise, which are frankly shlock: the mob gets to one key juror by threatening her son, and she manages to convince the rest of the jurors to let the bad ole mob boss walk, against their better judgement. In real life of course, the bad guys would've hedged their bets by threatening the families of most or all of the jurors, but then we wouldn't have our feisty protagonist who has to safeguard her son AND set things straight, and of course, no movie either.Nevertheless, IN SPITE of the ridiculousness of the premise and the somewhat dated dialogue the script inflicts on some of the actors*, Joanne Whalley and William Hurt make this film worth watching. Whalley has to create a woman who initially strikes us as meek and unpreposessing, who somehow finds the resources within to first stir the jury to let the mob boss walk, then protect her son from the gangsters-- a tall order. Whalley does have what it takes to do this, the self-assurance to draw the viewer in, with a quiet and understated performance that makes this transition believable. Likewise, William Hurt is convincing as a weak, flawed man who wants to do right, playing both sides and knowing he'll get burned in the end. Whalley and Hurt are quite a contrast from Armand Assante, so good as a gangster in Q&amp;A, but merely content to chew the scenery in a similar rolehere.*especially Gabriel Byrne and Armand Assante; at least we're spared them referring to Whalley as a dame.",4,Another unjustly neglected picture-,1026000000,"07 7, 2002",2002,1493,"['not', 'script', 'premise', 'are', 'frankly', 'shlock', 'mob', 'one', 'key', 'juror', 'threatening', 'son', 'convince', 'rest', 'jurors', 'let', 'bad', 'ole', 'mob', 'boss', 'walk', 'better', 'judgement', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'bad', 'guys', 'would', ""'ve"", 'hedged', 'bets', 'threatening', 'families', 'most', 'jurors', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'feisty', 'protagonist', 'who', 'safeguard', 'son', 'set', 'things', 'straight', 'course', 'movie', 'either.Nevertheless', 'IN', 'SPITE', 'ridiculousness', 'premise', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'dialogue', 'script', 'actors*', 'Joanne', 'Whalley', 'William', 'Hurt', 'make', 'film', 'watching', 'Whalley', 'create', 'woman', 'who', 'initially', 'meek', 'unpreposessing', 'who', 'somehow', 'resources', 'first', 'stir', 'jury', 'let', 'mob', 'boss', 'walk', 'then', 'protect', 'son', 'gangsters', 'tall', 'order', 'Whalley', 'have', 'what', 'do', 'self-assurance', 'draw', 'viewer', 'quiet', 'understated', 'performance', 'transition', 'believable', 'Likewise', 'William', 'Hurt', 'convincing', 'weak', 'flawed', 'man', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'playing', 'sides', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'get', 'burned', 'end', 'Whalley', 'Hurt', 'are', 'quite', 'contrast', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'so', 'good', 'gangster', 'Q', 'amp', 'A', 'merely', 'content', 'chew', 'scenery', 'similar', 'rolehere', '*especially', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'least', ""'re"", 'spared', 'referring', 'Whalley', 'dame']",N/A

Kathleen Quinlin does a great job playing a part that is very far-afield from most of the parts I have seen her play.  The gorefest in the park is a little unbelievable, but played well.  Stuart Whitman was a sight for sore eyes as the father.  Gabriel Byrne is believable and stellar as the prosecutor, very good, prosecutorial charisma, etc.  I should have seen the movie when it was first released to get the full enjoyment of what were then, very elegant women's costuming.
