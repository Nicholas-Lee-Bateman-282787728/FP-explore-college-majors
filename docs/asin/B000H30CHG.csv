1009164,ATOK2HUHCVNPY,B000H30CHG,410,"[0, 0]","This is a highly personal and opinionated documentary that mostly focuses on art-punk/post-punk bands of the late 70s NYC scene, and some more modern bands influenced by them.  It has some nice ""lost"" live footage of some of the original ""No"" wave bands such as DNA, Teenage Jesus, and the Contortions.  Lydia Lunch is ridiculously smug in her interviews, dissing newer bands as poseurs, dissing L.A. as fashion oriented... Kind of hypocritical when you consider the degree to which she seemed to highlight her sex image moreso than her musicianship.  Really, which you you listen to more these days, Teenage Jesus or the first Gun Club record from fashion conscious LA? The Foetus guy came off somewhat bitter too, preferring to listen to 60s soundtracks over newer music.  Perhaps the film is saying more about getting older as a musician, but could have been a little more subtle in its heavy handed editing.The no wave bands, at their best, sounded dangerous and outre.  As several of the interviewees alluded, it was a vent for anger and emotion moreso than musicality - though there is nothing really that new about that, just their atonal clanging (to some degree). A cynic could say the no wavers were art school poseurs and you could look back to the 60's ESP record catalog for large doses of genuine lunacy.  Lee Ranaldo (of Sonic Youth) and the Gogol Bordello guy had the most illuminating comments and both of those bands can play their instruments, too.  A little more on James Chance and the Contortions, and Mars would have been cool.  More footage from Flux Information Society!Check out the documentary Blank City, too, for a glimpse of the more cinematic goings on the the late 70s.",3,Ok treatment of underdocumented scene,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1701,"['highly', 'personal', 'opinionated', 'documentary', 'mostly', 'art-punk/post-punk', 'bands', 'late', '70s', 'NYC', 'scene', 'more', 'modern', 'bands', 'influenced', 'nice', 'lost', 'live', 'footage', 'original', 'No', 'wave', 'bands', 'such', 'DNA', 'Teenage', 'Jesus', 'Contortions', 'Lydia', 'Lunch', 'ridiculously', 'smug', 'interviews', 'dissing', 'newer', 'bands', 'poseurs', 'dissing', 'L.A.', 'fashion', 'oriented', 'Kind', 'hypocritical', 'when', 'consider', 'degree', 'seemed', 'highlight', 'sex', 'image', 'moreso', 'musicianship', 'Really', 'listen', 'more', 'days', 'Teenage', 'Jesus', 'first', 'Gun', 'Club', 'record', 'fashion', 'conscious', 'LA', 'Foetus', 'guy', 'came', 'off', 'somewhat', 'bitter', 'too', 'preferring', 'listen', '60s', 'soundtracks', 'newer', 'music', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'saying', 'more', 'getting', 'older', 'musician', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'subtle', 'heavy', 'handed', 'editing.The', 'wave', 'best', 'sounded', 'dangerous', 'outre', 'several', 'interviewees', 'alluded', 'was', 'vent', 'anger', 'emotion', 'moreso', 'musicality', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'just', 'atonal', 'clanging', 'degree', 'cynic', 'could', 'say', 'wavers', 'were', 'art', 'school', 'poseurs', 'could', 'look', 'back', '60', 'ESP', 'record', 'catalog', 'large', 'doses', 'genuine', 'lunacy', 'Lee', 'Ranaldo', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'Gogol', 'Bordello', 'guy', 'had', 'most', 'illuminating', 'comments', 'bands', 'can', 'play', 'instruments', 'too', 'little', 'more', 'James', 'Chance', 'Contortions', 'Mars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'More', 'footage', 'Flux', 'Information', 'Society', 'Check', 'documentary', 'Blank', 'City', 'too', 'glimpse', 'more', 'cinematic', 'goings', 'late', '70s']",Kill Your Idols
1009165,A34PAZQ73SL163,B000H30CHG,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[4, 8]","It's hard to know exactly what the angle of the filmmaker exactly was in regards to Kill Your Idols. The theme is blurry in my opinion. What is offered is devoid of narrative and built around interviews with emblematic performers from the (brief) No Wave era. What was immediately satisfying is that I had never heard of No Wave before so I appreciated the education. The phrase itself is a great send up of New Wave and it appears that the artists were very much the antithesis of the lively, polished sounds which were presented to our ears on the radio during that era. The interviewees, Lydia Lunch, Michael Gira, etc. are not very encouraged by what they see today. The describe the contemporary New York sound as being commodified and contrived via the machinations of the studios and rock journalists. With Sonic Youth, Thurston Moore is consulted but the band really seems to have existed on the fringe of this fringe movement. Several current bands are covered and you can see the way in which they are an extension of the No Wave period. As to whether a band like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs fit in, I am not sure, and that's what I meant before when I said that the director's perspective was not easily apparent. The musical talent of the groups is also questionable. Many of the figures admit that their songs seemed to be more statement than an expression of talent. The one thing that's certain is that they are fairly negative about the bands making the scene today. Personally, I disagree with Eno's assessment of the Strokes but I understand the way in which the band was not a result of their having experienced authentic New York culture. Gira's memories of living on the street, picking up just enough work to survive, and turning to music from a sense of having no other choice are undoubtedly circumstances not shared by today's headliners. The age that these artists describe does appear to be long gone, but it did provide a stirring creative impulse that benefited those who followed. Kill Your Idols has merit because it illuminates an era of which many of us know nothing.*Thanks for the correction. I looked over the cast list and don't know why I made the mistake with Eno.",3,Portrait of a Lost Time?,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,2195,"['hard', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'angle', 'filmmaker', 'exactly', 'was', 'regards', 'Kill', 'Your', 'Idols', 'theme', 'blurry', 'opinion', 'What', 'offered', 'devoid', 'narrative', 'built', 'interviews', 'emblematic', 'performers', 'brief', 'Wave', 'era', 'What', 'was', 'immediately', 'satisfying', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'No', 'Wave', 'so', 'appreciated', 'education', 'phrase', 'great', 'send', 'up', 'New', 'Wave', 'artists', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'antithesis', 'lively', 'polished', 'sounds', 'were', 'presented', 'ears', 'radio', 'era', 'interviewees', 'Lydia', 'Lunch', 'Michael', 'Gira', 'etc', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'encouraged', 'what', 'see', 'today', 'describe', 'contemporary', 'New', 'York', 'sound', 'being', 'commodified', 'contrived', 'machinations', 'studios', 'rock', 'journalists', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'Thurston', 'Moore', 'consulted', 'band', 'really', 'have', 'existed', 'fringe', 'fringe', 'movement', 'Several', 'current', 'bands', 'are', 'covered', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'are', 'extension', 'No', 'Wave', 'period', 'band', 'Yeah', 'Yeah', 'Yeahs', 'fit', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'meant', 'when', 'said', 'director', 'perspective', 'was', 'not', 'easily', 'apparent', 'musical', 'talent', 'groups', 'also', 'questionable', 'Many', 'figures', 'admit', 'songs', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'statement', 'expression', 'talent', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'are', 'fairly', 'negative', 'bands', 'making', 'scene', 'today', 'Personally', 'disagree', 'Eno', 'assessment', 'Strokes', 'understand', 'way', 'band', 'was', 'not', 'result', 'having', 'experienced', 'authentic', 'New', 'York', 'culture', 'Gira', 'memories', 'living', 'street', 'picking', 'up', 'just', 'enough', 'work', 'survive', 'turning', 'music', 'sense', 'having', 'other', 'choice', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'circumstances', 'not', 'shared', 'today', 'headliners', 'age', 'artists', 'describe', 'appear', 'be', 'long', 'gone', 'did', 'provide', 'stirring', 'creative', 'impulse', 'benefited', 'who', 'followed', 'Kill', 'Idols', 'merit', 'era', 'many', 'know', 'nothing', '*Thanks', 'correction', 'looked', 'cast', 'list', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'made', 'mistake', 'Eno']",Kill Your Idols
1009166,ANBSW3BALFRR2,B000H30CHG,Chet Fakir,"[0, 1]","Im not sure what the point of this movie is other than to compare the late seventies, early eighties NYC scene with whats happening now or 2002. The older guard essentially accuse the younger of having no originality and to some extent theyre right. But then that isn't necessarily the younger musicians particular trip, so thematically this movie is somewhat weak. The older folks interviewed in what was jokingly called ""No Wave"" such as Glenn Branca, Lydia Lunch or Lee Renaldo were trying to make music that had no references other than to itself. They werent creating another take on the blues in other words and in some cases dispensed with what could be considered rock all together. They were more concerned with making art. By comparison the younger NYC musicians, who don't consider themselves artists, are imitative rather than innovative and are often imitating the older musicians interviewed. Could anyone make the case that the Strokes are in any way original or that A.R.E. Weapons are more than derivative electroclash with attitude? But then again, so what? This movie doesnt work either as history or polemic. No point is made other than the scene has changed for better or worse and if you didnt know who these people were before you would be only a little less clueless at the movies end. What is made clear is that the older ""No Wave"" NYC musicians had different attitudes and indeed very different agendas from the contemporary musicians. So to my mind the comparison between the two camps is without much value.One thing I can say that the older original No Wave musicians are a lot more articulate than the modern musicians. Karen O is truly annoying with all her ""like"", ""you know"" nonsense and she actually is one of the more intelligent folks interviewed. The A.R.E.

1009167,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000H30CHG,Clare Quilty,"[5, 9]","Prior to watching this documentary about the New York art-music scene of the late 70s/early 80s, I didn't know much about the groups and musicians that are featured -- Lydia Lunch, Swans, Suicide, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. Only the more familiar Sonic Youth floats in this churning sea like a comforting lifesaver.Now having seen ""Kill Your Idols,"" I still can't say I know very much about the groups, but I do know their names and got a sample of their sounds.The reason for that is because the film tends to put each band under a microscope, tightly sealed under a slide, and it doesn't really provide enough context about the scene itself.But it almost doesn't matter because ""Kill Your Idols"" gives viewers a pretty good launching point to discover music most people haven't heard before. The segments that spotlight the early individual bands are all engaging in their own ways and although to say, ""I wanted more"" is a complaint, it's also a compliment.Where the movie is less successful, however, is in trying to draw a connection between the previous scene and the current one.The fusion doesn't really work because most of what you have is the older guys saying the new scene sucks/is contrived/doesn't break any new ground (although for the most part they refuse to name names other than the Strokes). The popular refrain of ""music today sucks"" is basically repeated through most of the second half of the film.Meanwhile, the film also presents the younger guys and newer bands who are cast as either carrying or dropping the art-rock torch, and they seem to know what they're talking about, but they don't come off very well -- Karen O. from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs mostly seems smug and disingenuous, and the guys from A.R.E. Weapons dunderheadedly try too hard to be hip; for the most part, only the leader of Gogol Bordello really approaches some good points.Handsomely shot and edited (although the stylish chapter cards last way too long), this is a good place for a newbie like me to start, but additional research will be required.",3,Works better as a launching point than an overview (2.5 stars),1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,2048,"['Prior', 'watching', 'documentary', 'New', 'York', 'art-music', 'scene', 'late', '70s/early', '80s', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'groups', 'musicians', 'are', 'featured', 'Lydia', 'Lunch', 'Swans', 'Suicide', 'Teenage', 'Jesus', 'Jerks', 'Only', 'more', 'familiar', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'floats', 'churning', 'sea', 'comforting', 'lifesaver.Now', 'having', 'seen', 'Kill', 'Your', 'Idols', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'know', 'very', 'much', 'groups', 'do', 'know', 'names', 'got', 'sample', 'sounds.The', 'reason', 'film', 'put', 'band', 'microscope', 'tightly', 'sealed', 'slide', ""n't"", 'really', 'provide', 'enough', 'context', 'scene', 'itself.But', 'almost', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Kill', 'Your', 'Idols', 'viewers', 'pretty', 'good', 'launching', 'point', 'discover', 'music', 'most', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'before', 'segments', 'spotlight', 'early', 'individual', 'bands', 'are', 'engaging', 'own', 'ways', 'say', 'wanted', 'more', 'complaint', 'also', 'compliment.Where', 'movie', 'less', 'successful', 'however', 'trying', 'draw', 'connection', 'previous', 'scene', 'current', 'one.The', 'fusion', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'most', 'what', 'have', 'older', 'guys', 'saying', 'new', 'scene', 'sucks/is', 'contrived/does', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'most', 'part', 'refuse', 'name', 'names', 'other', 'Strokes', 'popular', 'refrain', 'music', 'today', 'sucks', 'basically', 'repeated', 'most', 'second', 'half', 'film.Meanwhile', 'film', 'also', 'younger', 'guys', 'newer', 'bands', 'who', 'are', 'cast', 'carrying', 'dropping', 'art-rock', 'torch', 'seem', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'Karen', 'O.', 'Yeah', 'Yeah', 'Yeahs', 'mostly', 'smug', 'disingenuous', 'guys', 'A.R.E', 'Weapons', 'dunderheadedly', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'hip', 'most', 'part', 'only', 'leader', 'Gogol', 'Bordello', 'really', 'good', 'points.Handsomely', 'shot', 'edited', 'stylish', 'chapter', 'cards', 'last', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'good', 'place', 'newbie', 'start', 'additional', 'research', 'will', 'be', 'required']",Kill Your Idols
