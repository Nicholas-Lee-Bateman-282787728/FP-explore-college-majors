The effects of the severe editing (it originally ran over 9 hours) are noticeable but it remains a powerfully condensed masterpiece. Erich Von  Stroheim put his heart and soul into making this epic based on the novel  'McTeague' and he creates a timeless film that remains powerful and moving.  ZaSu Pitts is devastating as the money grubbing Trina and Gibson Gowland is  unforgettable as the gentle giant McTeague. The story is as old as sand but  it still works, a couple who is slowly consumed by greed and ultimately  makes McTeague a double murderer, killing his only true love and his best  friend.

It should be.Even without the benefit of music this must be one of the most rivetting films I've ever encountered.  It is a fairly literal adaption of ""Mc Teague"" by Frank Norris, a realist author who straddled the last century.  It is brilliantly brought to the screen by Erich von Stroheim, a Hollywood director of considerable merit who fell out of favor with his boss and with the system in general.The film's extreme length made it impossible to screen successfully and the many attempts to pare it down were well-meaning but doomed to failure.  Nevertheless, what remains is still wonderful to look at with some electrifying performances and a deliberate, inevitable pace.  ZaSu Pitts was a remarkable actress who was hampered with a jarring voice when the talkies came around.  Her dramatic ability needs to be experienced to be believed.  Gibson Gowland is also wonderful in his role as Mc Teague.There was a reconstruction of what the film might have aimed at, usingstill photographs for the missing footage that is not very successful in the long run.  The original film, cut up so badly, is still extremely successful.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in film but why it is currently unavailable is a mystery to me.Curtis Stotlar",5,WHY ISN'T THIS MASTERWORK ON DVD?,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,1320,"[""'m"", 'amazed', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'art', ""n't"", 'available', 'DVD', 'should', 'be.Even', 'benefit', 'music', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'rivetting', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'fairly', 'literal', 'adaption', 'Mc', 'Teague', 'Frank', 'Norris', 'realist', 'author', 'who', 'straddled', 'last', 'century', 'brilliantly', 'brought', 'screen', 'Erich', 'von', 'Stroheim', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'considerable', 'merit', 'who', 'fell', 'favor', 'boss', 'system', 'general.The', 'film', 'extreme', 'length', 'made', 'impossible', 'screen', 'successfully', 'many', 'attempts', 'pare', 'down', 'were', 'well-meaning', 'doomed', 'failure', 'Nevertheless', 'what', 'still', 'wonderful', 'look', 'electrifying', 'performances', 'deliberate', 'inevitable', 'pace', 'ZaSu', 'Pitts', 'was', 'remarkable', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'hampered', 'jarring', 'voice', 'when', 'talkies', 'came', 'around', 'dramatic', 'ability', 'needs', 'be', 'experienced', 'be', 'believed', 'Gibson', 'Gowland', 'also', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Mc', 'Teague.There', 'was', 'reconstruction', 'what', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'aimed', 'usingstill', 'photographs', 'missing', 'footage', 'not', 'very', 'successful', 'long', 'run', 'original', 'film', 'cut', 'up', 'so', 'badly', 'still', 'extremely', 'successful', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'film', 'why', 'currently', 'unavailable', 'mystery', 'me.Curtis', 'Stotlar']",N/A
280207,AH3U74GO8PLEE,6301969146,DDay,"[3, 3]","This film is one of the most difficult of the key silent films of the 1920's to locate, and due to the originals excessive length (reported to be 47 reels long more than 7 hours) one that has almost always been seen in abridged form.  Evidently it was only shown in complete form once.  This version is an abridged 120 minute clip which does a fair job at capturing the flavor of the original; although considering that over five hours of the original are missing there are holes in the story.  That said, no matter how good it was reputed to be, I can't possibly imagine sitting through a seven plus hour silent movie.  I suspect the MGM Executives were more than a little justified in cutting something.The Bad: I gave this version 4 stars because it does not contain all of the known footage for this movie.  There is reportedly one version out there which incorporates about four hours of the movie and every known scrap of footage in an attempt to recreate the original.  Also this does not contain any of the original tints; in the age of the computer this isn't as difficult as one might suppose.  The audiences of the 1920's were said to have seen a richly tinted movie.  Since this is often said to be the greatest silent movie ever made, someone should have put in the effort, rather than recycling the same old material.  That the complete version has been long been considered to be lost does not mean that a company producing a ""Collector's Edition"" shouldn't try.The Good.  This movie is just plain hard to find.  When one ignores the fact that this is an abridged copy the story is good, the film is generally clear and sharp, with little or none of the nitrate degradation or burning common in early film stock.  The sound track is appropriate to the film.  Music is the key to any silent film and the score is spot on.  This one is orchestral, I tend to prefer organ scores; however, the tempo of the music follows the action and one is as historically correct as the other.  This Spanish disc is advertised as region 2; however once I got the package I noticed a small square on the back which reads ""zona 0"" or region 0.  This disc is designed to be played anywhere.  Or at least on any machine which accepts the PAL format.  I own a multiregion DVD player, however, odds are if you own a quality DVD Player yours will too.  Check the specifications for your machine.  Playstations and Xboxes won't play PAL, at least mine don't seem to.The movie itself is not recommended for someone just starting to view silent films, it is a good movie but silent dramas haven't aged as well as the comedies.  Spanish subtitles were not a problem, they did not even come up on my machine; all of the intertitles were in English, so there was no language barrier",4,If you are a silent movie collector grab this one,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,2767,"['film', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'key', 'silent', 'films', '1920', 'locate', 'due', 'originals', 'excessive', 'length', 'reported', 'be', '47', 'reels', 'long', 'more', '7', 'hours', 'one', 'almost', 'always', 'been', 'seen', 'abridged', 'form', 'Evidently', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'complete', 'form', 'once', 'version', 'abridged', '120', 'minute', 'clip', 'fair', 'job', 'capturing', 'flavor', 'original', 'considering', 'five', 'hours', 'original', 'are', 'missing', 'are', 'holes', 'story', 'said', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'reputed', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'imagine', 'sitting', 'seven', 'hour', 'silent', 'movie', 'suspect', 'MGM', 'Executives', 'were', 'more', 'little', 'justified', 'cutting', 'something.The', 'Bad', 'gave', 'version', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'contain', 'known', 'footage', 'movie', 'reportedly', 'one', 'version', 'there', 'four', 'hours', 'movie', 'known', 'scrap', 'footage', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'original', 'Also', 'not', 'contain', 'original', 'tints', 'age', 'computer', ""n't"", 'as', 'difficult', 'one', 'might', 'suppose', 'audiences', '1920', 'were', 'said', 'have', 'seen', 'richly', 'tinted', 'movie', 'often', 'said', 'be', 'greatest', 'silent', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'someone', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'effort', 'rather', 'recycling', 'same', 'old', 'material', 'complete', 'version', 'been', 'long', 'been', 'considered', 'be', 'lost', 'not', 'mean', 'company', 'producing', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'should', ""n't"", 'try.The', 'Good', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'hard', 'find', 'When', 'one', 'fact', 'abridged', 'copy', 'story', 'good', 'film', 'generally', 'clear', 'sharp', 'little', 'none', 'nitrate', 'degradation', 'burning', 'common', 'early', 'film', 'stock', 'sound', 'track', 'appropriate', 'film', 'Music', 'key', 'silent', 'film', 'score', 'spot', 'one', 'orchestral', 'tend', 'prefer', 'organ', 'scores', 'however', 'tempo', 'music', 'action', 'one', 'historically', 'correct', 'other', 'Spanish', 'disc', 'advertised', 'region', '2', 'however', 'got', 'package', 'noticed', 'small', 'square', 'back', 'zona', '0', 'region', '0', 'disc', 'designed', 'be', 'played', 'anywhere', 'least', 'machine', 'PAL', 'format', 'own', 'multiregion', 'DVD', 'player', 'however', 'odds', 'are', 'own', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Player', 'yours', 'will', 'too', 'Check', 'specifications', 'machine', 'Playstations', 'Xboxes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'PAL', 'least', 'mine', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'to.The', 'movie', 'not', 'recommended', 'someone', 'just', 'starting', 'view', 'silent', 'films', 'good', 'movie', 'silent', 'dramas', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'as', 'well', 'comedies', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'were', 'not', 'problem', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'up', 'machine', 'intertitles', 'were', 'English', 'so', 'was', 'language', 'barrier']",N/A

Oops.  We didn't want to turn it off, though.This poor movie is in rough shape--probably half of it is fill-ins made up of still shots borrowed from other sections of the movie.  Ultimately, though, the movie still follows just fine.  Once you get into it, you forget that it's silent because your mind starts to fill in the thoughts and emotions of the characters on its own.  The acting style is far more naturalistic than that of many silents, and it ends up being unnervingly believable despite the weird makeup--McTeague appears to have been dusted in flour; hair, eyebrows, and all--and despite having a storyline that is right out of Theodore Dreiser.

280210,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,6301969146,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[13, 15]","Most of the reviews that I have read for the movie ""Greed"" start off with a short history of the movie. For film fans, watching this movie is like watching history. Director Erich von Stroheim directed this movie with a whooping ten hours of a movie. The studio made him cut it, so he cut it to about four hours. It was still too long. Back at the time, movies that ran over one hour were long, so the studio chopped his masterpiece work up to a little over two hours. A little over two hours from what was once ten hours long. The studio wants to recycle the film, so the completed ten hours of material is now considered the ""Holy Grail"" of the cinema. What me and millions of other people would do to see the entire thing. . . The version I saw was a four hour restored version, replacing some of the missing scenes with still photographs. I watched it from 1:45am to 6:00am one night, and what a journey! I was finished wanting more. It was one of the best nights I spent watching a movie. I was totally blown away. It was something different than the silent movies that I saw prior, the old Lon Cheney and Harold Lloyd movies.""Greed"" starts off to the introduction of McTeague. He becomes a dentist in San Francisco, and he wants a golden bird that he sees in a shop window more than anything. When one of his friends, Marcus, comes in with his love interest Trina, who has a chipped tooth, McTeague falls in love, and he must contain himself from doing anything to her while she is in the chair. The two fall in love, and Marcus gives McTeague his blessing. The first hour and a half deals with their relationship, and then their marriage. But, shortly after their marriage, Trina wins the lottery and gets five thousand dollars. Trina buys McTeague that golden bird that he always wanted, but  then she wants to put the money away so that it could collect interest and McTeague can't even access it. As Trina becomes more and more obsessed with money, it becomes more important to her than her marriage. As if that is the worst of McTeague's problems. Marcus becomes greedy, because that would have been his money if he didn't let McTeague have Trina. McTeague becomes part of a large conflict, which leads to the most grim and surprising turn of events that not many could see coming.""Greed"" ends in Death Valley. I won't tell you how the characters get there, but it is on of the most grim, ironic endings ever. It's so sad, how money can do so much to people, and how it could take over their lives. Somebody told me about the golden bird. At the end of the movie, you know that it is going to die, and it is still stuck in it's cage. This person said that the bird did nothing to get into that situation, and it is going to die because of the greed and corruption of other people. I applaud that person for thinking of that, something that I didn't even think about.At the end of this journey, I realized that this is one of the best movies ever. It's the kind of movie that makes me feel bad for the modern day teenagers that wants to see a good movie, and then they watch a horrible thriller like ""The Grudge"" which I already trashed. This is the good stuff. Just because it is a silent movie doesn't mean that it is bad. Open you minds and tastes to the movies that were the foundation of what you watch today. This movie is a masterpiece, and it's characters are so sad to watch, as they change from the first minute to the last second. I felt like Stroheim did when he saw the finished work, and how the movie was destroyed based on what he had. I wanted to see the rest. . . I wanted to see what we were meant to see.

The opening sequence of this four-hour tape version calls the lost scenes of Greed the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of film.  If I may say so, PUHLEEZ!  I would say that the blockbuster Cleopatra or the censored and destroyed The Spirit of 76 (both from 1917) are  much better qualified for such a title.  Come now, I can see wanting to take ten hours to film Gibbon's Rise and Fall, but the story of McTeague is no 1000 year old Roman Empire.  Its not even a Lawrence of Arabia.  Its a silly little novel that perhaps teaches an important moral lesson; not something that requires ten hours of film to achieve; two hours should have been plenty.  That is the reason people go to the movies instead of reading books!Regarding the four-hour version, lost scenes are apparently replaced by stills with more frequent intertitles; it is a good effort to replicate what was lost but quite frankly most of the still-cut scenes seemed quite unremarkable.  And the character of Maria and her creepy &quot;spouse&quot; seemed profoundly racist or anti-Hispanic in demeanor.  For the non-von Stroheimaniacs, I would suggest the two hour version as it feels much less choppy and more entertaining.  I was only able to finish this four-hour tape with substantial aid from my FF button.A final word on von Stroheim, for all his pompous whinging about the &quot;destruction&quot; of his &quot;masterpiece&quot; Greed, he had no problem denigrating himself and his heritage in order to get ahead in life.  While his countrymen were being killed defending their homes from Imperial British and French armies, he was in New York fueling the fire of anti-German hatred amongst Americans with roles on stage, and in films like The Hun Within (1918).

At other times, the darkness of his lust and anger burst from beneath his civilized veneer revealing a very disturbing individual.

One man has genuine affection for the girl while the other man has genuine affection for the lottery money she wins. And in the end instead of the right man walking away into the sunset with the girl all three turn out to lose.McTeague is the labor worker turned dentist. He has a gentle quality about him but his anger is easily provoked; as when a bird is carelessly knocked out of his hand or when his pipe is broken. He meets poor Trina who comes in with an achey tooth. He's immediately smitten with her, and even one point kisses her while she is asleep on his dentist chair. Marcus, Trina's cousin completes the triangle. At first he is Trina's beau, but when McTeague admits his love for Trina Marcus generously steps down. He becomes resentful only after Trina wins her lottery money.Even for a silent movie this film is for the most part fast paced, but whether or not it has the ability to hold up to its original 8 hours is doubtful to me. Although there are some things that are left unanswered (McTeague's maid snooping around is shown but never expanded upon... I would have liked to seen the end result of that) there are some scenes that go on a little too long... the wedding and reception scene, and even the climatic chase in the desert stretched it for me.Even so, the complexities of the characters far outweigh the flaws. McTeague, Trina and Marcus are all fascinating in their own right.Trina starts out as Olive Oyl cringey... a girl more likely to cling to her mother's skirts than share a bed with a brutish man... however by the end her transformation into a thieving, manipulating shrew who's willing to feed her husband rotten meat to save on a few pennies is astounding.With McTeague you get the impression he is a good man at heart... but a carnal streak in him often pops up. For quite a bit of the movie he is actually quite humble and level headed, albeit occasionally seized with sudden madness. Towards the end though he completly loses it, and doesn't come to his senses until it is far too late. Very similiar to the story of Heracles when Hera made him go mad.Marcus, however, is the exact opposite of McTeague. He is a jovial man that is secretly rotten. He is light hearted in the beginning, but soon after Trina wins her money his demeanor does nothing but get worse.I have to admit that although I enjoy silent movies they are not necessarily my favorite genre. After a while I find them tedious, but Greed flowed along (except for the occasional slow parts) and kept me very interested.I'm not sure if I personally consider it a masterpiece, but it doesn't surprise me that others do.",4,Melancholy to the core,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,2711,"['Greed', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'typical', 'love', 'triangle', 'girl', 'two', 'men', 'One', 'man', 'genuine', 'affection', 'girl', 'other', 'man', 'genuine', 'affection', 'lottery', 'money', 'end', 'instead', 'right', 'man', 'walking', 'away', 'sunset', 'girl', 'three', 'turn', 'out', 'lose.McTeague', 'labor', 'worker', 'turned', 'dentist', 'gentle', 'quality', 'anger', 'easily', 'provoked', 'when', 'bird', 'carelessly', 'knocked', 'hand', 'when', 'pipe', 'broken', 'poor', 'Trina', 'who', 'achey', 'tooth', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'asleep', 'dentist', 'chair', 'Marcus', 'Trina', 'cousin', 'triangle', 'first', 'Trina', 'beau', 'when', 'McTeague', 'love', 'Trina', 'Marcus', 'generously', 'down', 'resentful', 'only', 'Trina', 'lottery', 'money.Even', 'silent', 'movie', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'fast', 'paced', 'not', 'ability', 'hold', 'up', 'original', '8', 'hours', 'doubtful', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'McTeague', 'maid', 'snooping', 'around', 'shown', 'never', 'expanded', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seen', 'end', 'result', 'are', 'scenes', 'go', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'wedding', 'reception', 'scene', 'even', 'climatic', 'chase', 'desert', 'stretched', 'me.Even', 'so', 'complexities', 'characters', 'far', 'outweigh', 'flaws', 'McTeague', 'Trina', 'Marcus', 'are', 'fascinating', 'own', 'right.Trina', 'out', 'Olive', 'Oyl', 'cringey', 'girl', 'more', 'likely', 'cling', 'mother', 'skirts', 'share', 'bed', 'brutish', 'man', 'however', 'end', 'transformation', 'thieving', 'manipulating', 'shrew', 'who', 'willing', 'feed', 'husband', 'meat', 'save', 'few', 'pennies', 'astounding.With', 'McTeague', 'get', 'impression', 'good', 'man', 'heart', 'carnal', 'streak', 'often', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'humble', 'level', 'headed', 'occasionally', 'seized', 'sudden', 'madness', 'end', 'completly', ""n't"", 'come', 'senses', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'Very', 'similiar', 'story', 'Heracles', 'when', 'Hera', 'made', 'go', 'mad.Marcus', 'however', 'exact', 'opposite', 'McTeague', 'jovial', 'man', 'secretly', 'rotten', 'light', 'hearted', 'beginning', 'soon', 'Trina', 'money', 'demeanor', 'nothing', 'get', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoy', 'silent', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'favorite', 'genre', 'while', 'find', 'tedious', 'Greed', 'flowed', 'along', 'occasional', 'slow', 'parts', 'kept', 'very', 'interested.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'personally', 'consider', 'masterpiece', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'others', 'do']",N/A
280217,A39AN1E0VZGPB9,6301969146,Polkadotty,"[59, 62]","Erich von Stroheim (the aristocratic 'von' tacked on by Stroheim himself) was a demanding director with a passion for perfection and an unforgiving eye for detail. His scripts typically included precise notes for camera angles and intricate descriptions of even the most minute of actions. Stroheim's persona reflected his attention to appearance and detail. He favored close military haircuts, precise military manners, a stiff Viennese accent, and affected for himself a privileged background. In truth, his father, a Prussian Silesian, was listed on Stroheim's birth certificate as a maker and seller of hats, and his mother, of Czech origin born in Prague, was neither a lady-in-waiting to the Empress nor a baroness as Stroheim preferred to pretend she was.Aristocratic or not, von Stroheim favored BIG pictures and spent BIG producing them. He worked very hard at them too, invariably toiling late into the night to ascertain every of his exactly-plotted details came off perfectly. All told, Stroheim's output numbered just nine films, all but the last silent, and he served as a director for a rather brief span of time ~ between 1919 and 1932 ~ before returning to Europe to resume an acting career (monocle-wearing Nazis and other heavies). Of Stroheim's films, one was never released, two were finished by others, one was stopped during production and released incomplete, two were taken from him during post-production and slaughtered (von Stroheim referred to the released version of GREED as 'the skeleton of my dead child'), two others received rather more minor cuts ordered by the studio, and one was released intact.GREED was von Stroheim's tour-de-force. It's said that he was so enamored of the book McTEAGUE by Frank Norris (of the American naturalist-realist school) he became determined to film every last word of it, including commas and periods. Certainly he went way overboard in budget, shooting forty-seven reels ~ more than 8 hours of viewing time ~ in the making of it. However, the forty-seven reels were never intended to be seen by a paying audience; these were pre-director's cuts.When the shooting was completed in December 1923, Stroheim invited a hand-picked few to a private showing of forty-five reels of his masterpiece ~ a showing that lasted from 10:30 in the morning until 8:00 that night. Stroheim then presented to the Goldwyn Company 42 reels of his work, and was promptly requested to cut it to a more reasonable length, wherein he obliged by further reducing it to 24 reels. Still too long, so with the help of his friend Rex Ingram, Stroheim produced an 18-reel version he planned to release in two parts, 18 reels being the minimum length in which he felt justice for McTEAGUE could be done. The studio, unconvinced, turned the material over to June Mathis, story editor at Goldwyn, who trimmed Stroheim's final cut of 24 reels to 10 reels and gave it the title GREED. In December 1924, following the merger, MGM released the Mathis version. None too pleased, Stroheim argued for months with producer Irving Thalberg and MGM head Louis B. Mayer about the removed footage, raging '[June Mathis] had read neither the book nor my script, yet was ordered to cut it'.In his quest for ultra-realism in GREED, Stroheim bought out entire blocks of property in downslidden neighborhoods, forcing his actors to live on these blocks so that they might gain insight into such a lifestyle. Stroheim insisted on filming a murder scene in GREED at a place where a murder actually occurred (and who watching the scene would know this unless it was pointed out?) The climactic final scenes were shot in Death Valley during the hottest part of the summer of 1923, forcing more than a few crew members into outright mutiny, and almost destroying the equipment in the process (in order to function the cameras had to be wrapped in icewater-soaked cloths). Wildly outrageous stories circulated about von Stroheim, including that he once insisted on waiting for chimney smoke to blow in a certain direction before continuing with a scene (untrue). However, this brand of fanaticism earned him the title 'The Man You Love To Hate'.Despite the massive cuts, GREED remains a HUGE story. Powerful, startlingly honest, brutal, unrelentingly bleak, tragic ~ the characters in this story are rawboned and real. McTeague (Gibson Gowland) is a man ruled by his passions, his wife Trina (Zasu Pitts) is driven frighteningly insane through her obsession with money, McTeague's friend Marcus (Jean Hersholt) is a miserable scheming villain. In the 'reconstructed' version we are introduced to a Mexican housekeeper Maria (Dale Fuller), whose cherished childhood dream ultimately costs her life, and a greedy junk dealer (Cesare Gravina), and a subplot involving a quietly amorous older couple. GREED retains several searing scenes of violence and depravity, and builds to an unforgettable climax.  Several websites are devoted to discussions of the plot and subplots and symbolisms within GREED ~ the pre-cut complete version, the Brownlow version, and the 75th anniversary 'reconstructed' version; a simple search should get you started. It's fascinating information, well worth the effort of anyone interested in the history of this legendary film.From forty-seven reels down to 10 ... and still for sheer size and scope, no silent film rivals GREED.  You might well ask, what happened to all that sliced stock? According to Stroheim, the film was melted down for its silver content. Although ~ and who can fault them? ~ several film enthusiasts and experts still hold out hope for the discovery of yet a few more reels of what remains 'The Holy Grail' of lost film

280220,A37S3ACL57LN62,6301969146,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[9, 29]","Greed is the film adaptation of the book McTeague by Frank Norris. Director Erich von Stroheim originally filmed the entire novel which resulted in a film reels longer than any film ever released to the public. The studio forced cuts to be made and shortened the length to about two hours, which is what has been released here. Although von Stroheim was not happy with the changes, Greed is hailed today as a masterpiece.The two main characters are McTeague, a curly haired man who struggles between good and evil, and Trina, a seemingly ideal woman who succumbs to greed after winning the lottery. McTeague is easy to sympathize with despite his ogreish qualities, especially considering his wife's stingy behavior. Trina seems like the one the audience is meant to like when she shows vulnerability and fear on her wedding night, but it turns out that she is the true aggressor in the relationship. Originally, the two are introduced by mutual friend Marcus who is courting Trina. He agrees to let McTeague have her and regrets his decision immensely when she wins five thousand dollars in a lottery that Marcus discouraged her from participating in. Throughout the film, he believes he is entitled to the money.There are a few effective scenes in the film. The first is during the wedding of Trina and McTeague. The two are standing together as the wedding march melody emerges from the piano. However, just outside, a funeral marches by, bringing with it a doomsday melody. The medley of the two is highly effective as foreshadowing of the future of the couple. The second part of the film that works quite well visually is a series of clips. They each depict artistically the grasp that greed has on the two, first on Trina and later on her husband as well. One sees skeletal hands grasping at coins and later two hands eerily grasping many expensive gold vases. Finally, the couple is shown forcefully in the grasp of a large hand, the hand of greed. The last symbolic piece of Greed serves as the beginning and end of the film. In the opening, McTeague finds a bird and kisses it affectionately. Another man comes along and knocks the bird out of his hand. This simple scene is very powerful; the bird represents McTeague himself. Later, when McTeague marries Trina, he gives her two birds, symbolizing them. When greed takes hold of her, Trina tells her husband to sell them, in a way telling him to sell their own souls for any price. In the end of the film, McTeague sets his birds free, knowing that his soul is doomed in the desert without water.Overall, despite the powerful symbolism, the film is somewhat dull. Perhaps it was better with the lost reels. It is certainly an important film, but it is not outstanding as a means of entertainment.",3,Like a Book You Read in School,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2758,"['Greed', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'McTeague', 'Frank', 'Norris', 'Director', 'Erich', 'von', 'Stroheim', 'originally', 'filmed', 'entire', 'novel', 'resulted', 'film', 'reels', 'longer', 'film', 'ever', 'released', 'public', 'studio', 'forced', 'cuts', 'be', 'made', 'shortened', 'length', 'two', 'hours', 'been', 'released', 'here', 'von', 'Stroheim', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'changes', 'Greed', 'hailed', 'today', 'masterpiece.The', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'McTeague', 'curly', 'haired', 'man', 'who', 'good', 'evil', 'Trina', 'seemingly', 'ideal', 'woman', 'who', 'greed', 'winning', 'lottery', 'McTeague', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'ogreish', 'qualities', 'especially', 'considering', 'wife', 'stingy', 'behavior', 'Trina', 'one', 'audience', 'meant', 'like', 'when', 'vulnerability', 'fear', 'wedding', 'night', 'out', 'true', 'aggressor', 'relationship', 'Originally', 'two', 'are', 'introduced', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Marcus', 'who', 'courting', 'Trina', 'let', 'McTeague', 'have', 'regrets', 'decision', 'immensely', 'when', 'five', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'lottery', 'Marcus', 'discouraged', 'participating', 'film', 'entitled', 'money.There', 'are', 'few', 'effective', 'scenes', 'film', 'first', 'wedding', 'Trina', 'McTeague', 'two', 'are', 'standing', 'together', 'wedding', 'march', 'melody', 'piano', 'However', 'just', 'outside', 'funeral', 'marches', 'bringing', 'doomsday', 'melody', 'medley', 'two', 'highly', 'effective', 'foreshadowing', 'future', 'couple', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'visually', 'series', 'clips', 'depict', 'artistically', 'grasp', 'greed', 'two', 'first', 'Trina', 'later', 'husband', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'skeletal', 'hands', 'grasping', 'coins', 'later', 'two', 'hands', 'eerily', 'grasping', 'many', 'expensive', 'gold', 'vases', 'Finally', 'couple', 'shown', 'forcefully', 'grasp', 'large', 'hand', 'hand', 'greed', 'last', 'symbolic', 'piece', 'Greed', 'serves', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'opening', 'McTeague', 'bird', 'affectionately', 'man', 'along', 'bird', 'hand', 'simple', 'scene', 'very', 'powerful', 'bird', 'McTeague', 'Later', 'when', 'McTeague', 'marries', 'Trina', 'two', 'birds', 'symbolizing', 'When', 'greed', 'hold', 'Trina', 'husband', 'sell', 'way', 'telling', 'sell', 'own', 'souls', 'price', 'end', 'film', 'McTeague', 'birds', 'free', 'knowing', 'soul', 'doomed', 'desert', 'water.Overall', 'powerful', 'symbolism', 'film', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'better', 'lost', 'reels', 'certainly', 'important', 'film', 'not', 'outstanding', 'means', 'entertainment']",N/A

I  highly recommend this film although we couldn't label it as Stroheim's  &quot;baby&quot;. Recently, however, many missing pieces were unearthed,  which allowed for a near-complete reconstruction of the original  recordings. One cable channel (AMC I belief) aired this new &quot;old&quot;  version of &quot;Greed&quot;, restoring not only this classic picture, but  equally, Stroheim's shattered dream of bringing out his own (lengthy)  rendition of Norris's &quot;McTeague&quot; novel.
