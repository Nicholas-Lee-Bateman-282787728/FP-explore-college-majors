I have seen many of his films but did not see this due to being a huge fan of his.  I watched it instead due to the cast.  Two of my very favorites Seth Rogen and Justin Long are in it.  I have gotten to the point that I love anything Seth Rogen does.  This film comes across to me more like an independant film and I loved the characters of Zack and Miri.  Seth Rogen proves to be hilarious, witty and endearing here while Elizabeth Banks gives us a very goofy, lovable Miri.  The film starts off great as we follow these two down on their luck best friends just going through life expecting little.  Till there high school reunion that is.  Here we meet Justin Long who steals the entire film as a gay porn star.  His character puts ideas in Zack's head and when he and Miri find all their utilities being shut off and no money left they decide to guess what - MAKE A PORN!!  The story that ensues is very funny, believable and unique.  All the characters are memorable and the motley crew they put together for the porn bond perfectly and a happy family is formed.  The story may be simple and not very deep but all the characters are spot on and the cast is superb.  Traci Lords adds her always unique touch as do Jason Mewes and Craig Robinson.This movie made me laugh and made me very happy.  That is what a good film does.  I had to buy it and add it to my collection.  The blu ray version has excellent video and superb audio.  This comedy goes to the top of my list.

I'm absolutely at a loss to explain what has happened to that great talent and, more important, the incredible dialogue that made CLERKS and CLERKS II my first two choices for 'must see again' movies.The plot is fairly simple, as are most of the characters: We're broke, the power and water have been shut off in the apartment we'll probably be kicked out of at any time, we have dead-end jobs and no apparent desire to do anything about it all except whine continually. Then Zack comes up with the idea of making a porno movie. Who knew bad porn was all it took to get him actually trying to accomplish something besides being his high schools reunions ""biggest loser""?Oddly enough, Seth Rogan and Elizabeth Banks somehow manage to make us all care about what happens to them, as well as actually like them. In fact, hard as it is to imagine, all the porn cast/crew were likeable and you find yourself wanting them to succeed in this highly dubious venture, even when the obvious ending is apparent.I liked the best friend concept between the man and woman so much I didn't want to see it develope (as we all knew it would) into a different kind of relationship.I'm the Smith fan, not my husband, but he laughed right along with me. You know what you're getting into from the title. There was one scene I truly wished Smith had left out -- there was no redeeming value, no big laugh, nothing except ""Ew, gross!"" -- and all of you who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. It was a jarring reminder of how far he's come from the genius of CLERKS. Maybe it's no longer a matter of creating something original or meaningful, but now we're just paying the bills and going for the cheap laugh.I almost didn't recognize Jason Mewes without the hair and watchcap. I liked him here. He played the role of a prostitute with a kind of innocence that was almost touching. Actually, Jason himself has always struck me as having some kind of undefinable innocence in real life.All in all, I do recommend this film to those of you who are not easily offended. Buy, rent, borrow, whatever. Prepare yourself for the usual Smith repetition of the F word -- honestly, could he carry on a conversation without it? Also for a truly nasty scene that will so distract you from the story line you'll wonder why it's even there. Still, it has a couple of characters you'll fall in love with, a sweet Jason Mewes, and a good, even if it is predictable, ending.",3,"Not bad, but not in the same catagory as CLERKS",1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,2554,"['Kevin', 'Smith', 'managed', 'put', 'three', 'movies', 'top', 'favorites', 'list', 'CLERKS', 'CLERKS', 'II', 'DOGMA', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'loss', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'great', 'talent', 'more', 'important', 'incredible', 'dialogue', 'made', 'CLERKS', 'CLERKS', 'II', 'first', 'two', 'choices', ""'must"", 'see', 'again', 'movies.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'are', 'most', 'characters', ""'re"", 'broke', 'power', 'water', 'have', 'been', 'shut', 'off', 'apartment', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'kicked', 'time', 'have', 'dead-end', 'jobs', 'apparent', 'desire', 'do', 'anything', 'whine', 'continually', 'Then', 'Zack', 'up', 'idea', 'making', 'porno', 'movie', 'Who', 'knew', 'bad', 'porn', 'was', 'took', 'get', 'actually', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'something', 'being', 'high', 'schools', 'reunions', 'biggest', 'loser', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'somehow', 'manage', 'make', 'care', 'what', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'fact', 'hard', 'imagine', 'porn', 'cast/crew', 'were', 'likeable', 'find', 'wanting', 'succeed', 'highly', 'dubious', 'venture', 'even', 'when', 'obvious', 'ending', 'apparent.I', 'liked', 'best', 'friend', 'concept', 'man', 'woman', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'develope', 'knew', 'would', 'different', 'kind', 'relationship.I', ""'m"", 'Smith', 'fan', 'not', 'husband', 'laughed', 'right', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'title', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'truly', 'wished', 'Smith', 'had', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'redeeming', 'value', 'big', 'laugh', 'nothing', 'Ew', 'gross', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'was', 'jarring', 'reminder', 'how', 'far', 'come', 'genius', 'CLERKS', 'Maybe', 'no', 'longer', 'matter', 'creating', 'something', 'original', 'meaningful', 'now', ""'re"", 'just', 'paying', 'bills', 'going', 'cheap', 'laugh.I', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'hair', 'watchcap', 'liked', 'here', 'played', 'role', 'prostitute', 'kind', 'innocence', 'was', 'almost', 'touching', 'Actually', 'Jason', 'always', 'struck', 'having', 'kind', 'undefinable', 'innocence', 'real', 'life.All', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'Buy', 'rent', 'borrow', 'Prepare', 'usual', 'Smith', 'repetition', 'F', 'word', 'honestly', 'could', 'carry', 'conversation', 'Also', 'truly', 'nasty', 'scene', 'will', 'so', 'distract', 'story', 'line', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'even', 'there', 'Still', 'couple', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'sweet', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'good', 'even', 'predictable', 'ending']",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

1214950,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B001LM6VV8,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[7, 19]","The operative question for ""Zack & Miri Make a Porno"" seems to be how many times Kevin Smith can utilize the word ""F*CK"" (and all variations thereof, plus every conceivable term for the male and female sex organs)and still keep his material fresh and funny.  The answer: zero.  The script and dialogue seem like stale leftovers that have been reheated one too many times.The titular Zack and Miri are male/female roommates barely scratching out a living in the Pittsburgh area.  Having known one another since early childhood, the pair have long sublimated any physical or romantic attraction they may have, and are, seemingly, content to be roomies and best friends.  That is, until the runaway expenses of their unpaid utility bills prompt Zack to click on the improbable idea of their producing a porno movie.  Gathering a stereotypical (and largely unappetizing)cast and crew, Zack and Miri realize their porno dream with unconvincing determination, thereby causing a rift in their, heretofore, unbreakable bond.As Zack, Seth Rogen assays, essentially, the same character he did in ""Pineapple Express"", ""Knocked Up"",  and pracically every other thing he's ever appeared in.  At his best, Rogen has a hangdog quality that can be amusing and touching, even, if he's reigned in.  Otherwise, he's the acting equivalent of a bull in a china shop; in ""Zack and Miri"", his antics quickly become tiresome and not remotely amusing.  Elizabeth Banks, on the other hand, plays a gorgeous whack who is cast, not only against type, but against believability, as the hard-livin', hard-lovin' good-time girl, Miri.  I didn't buy that bit for a second, nor did I buy the romantic developments that occur later on in the film.The supporting cast, which includes Smith regular, Jason Mewes, Traci Lords, and Jennifer Schwalbach, do their best but their characters aren't believable or funny, either.Everything about this film, right down to the camera work, is repetitive and ugly.  According to IMDB, Kevin Smith is approaching forty, but ""Zack & Miri"" seems as if it was made by a 14 year old boy.  It certainly seems designed for that particular audience, even though they aren't old enough to see it.  It's a shame that Smith doesn't use his evident skill and intelligence to broaden the scope of his talent, and to mature as a filmmaker.",1,Kevin & Co.

1214952,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001LM6VV8,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","Watching Kevin Smith's ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno,"" one question inevitably popped into my head: How many other people resort to pornography when they're desperate for cash? I'm not being sarcastic. It is a legitimate industry, and if a film is made well, it's sure to rake in some big bucks. And because porn contains so many fringe markets, it really doesn't matter if you're fat or bald or old. I live in Los Angeles, right on the outskirts of the San Fernando Valley, which has been the Mecca for adult entertainment production companies ever since the 1970s; the last I heard, the San Fernando Valley produces about ninety percent of the country's porn, all of which are legally distributed. The interesting thing is that Smith's film takes place in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, not Los Angeles, and his characters don't have a thriving local porn industry to fall back on. They have to create one of their own, and for reasons even I don't understand, I found the idea both fascinating and plausible. Not quite so plausible is the fact that the film is a romantic comedy masquerading as a raunchy parody. By the end, more than a few viewers are likely to spot the formulaic elements.Or maybe they won't. ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is so shamelessly vulgar that most audiences will focus on nothing other than how over the top it is. I don't use the term ""shamelessly vulgar"" lightly, here; there are enough four-letter words in this film make almost anyone blush, and the sexual references are so in-your-face that it's likely to make some people turn away. Truth be told, I'm very surprised it got away with an R rating; fifteen years ago, a rating of NC-17 would have been automatic. But in a strange, unexplainable sort of way, it all comes together. The story might be crude, but at least it's actually bothering to tell a story and it includes oddly endearing characters, none more important than financially struggling roommates Zack Brown (Seth Rogen) and Miri Linky (Elizabeth Banks). They've been best friends ever since the first grade, and after all this time, they've kept the relationship platonic. Unfortunately, they're also sinking in debt, with Zack's job at a coffee shop and Miri's job at the mall doing little to get their bills paid. Both their water and electricity get shut off, which is bad because Monroeville is in the middle of a frigid winter.When Zack and Miri attend their tenth high school reunion, they meet an old schoolmate named Bobby Long (Brandon Routh) and his lover, a gay porn star from Los Angeles named Brandon St. Randy (Justin Long). This gives Zack an idea: He and Miri can earn some money filming their own adult movie, which they later determine will be an erotic parody of ""Star Wars."" After Zack recruits his friend and co-worker, Delaney (Craig Robinson), as the producer, and a former high school friend, Deacon (Jeff Anderson), as the cameraman, they rent a vacant studio and hire a couple of actors to be featured with Zack and Miri. One is Lester (Jason Mewes), whose knack for quick preparedness has nothing to do with punctuality or memorization of lines. The other two, not surprisingly, are played by real life porn stars: one is Bubbles (Traci Lords), so named because of a special soap bubble trick she picked up doing bachelor parties, a trick that does not involve her mouth; the other is Stacey (Katie Morgan), a perky young blonde with a chest that would save her life in a head-on collision. Everyone eventually poses for the camera, wearing costumes and carrying gadgets that would make George Lucas cringe. Would he laugh at the thought of a light saber being used as a sex toy?Things take an unfortunate turn when the studio is demolished. It would seem the man who rented out the space was not being entirely honest. Luckily, a solution exists: They can use Zack's coffee shop as a studio. Thus begins a nights-only movie shoot, one that actually makes cappuccinos seem a lot less appealing.If I use any more puns or double entendres to describe the plot, I think I'm liable to get in serious trouble. Let's just leave it at this: ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is almost encyclopedic with its litany of sexual acts and slang terms for specific body parts. Chances are you'll leave having seen more than you ever wanted to see, or at least more than you wanted to see in an R rated film playing in a commercial movie theater (although I certainly can't speak for everyone). For decency's sake, let's focus on the relationship between the title characters. It was interesting to say the least, not only because they've known each other for so long, but also because they never once thought to act on the feelings that were always buried within. One wonders how such a thing would be possible, especially since they essentially know everything about each other. But then comes the day their scene is scheduled for filming; rather than graphically have sex, they tenderly make love. Will this ruin their friendship, as they always feared it would?This part of the story didn't really do much for me, probably because, with the notable exception of the pornographic backdrop, the same idea exists in numerous other romantic comedies. As far as basic relationship stories are concerned, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" doesn't give us anything new. The way I see it, the over-the-top visual and verbal gags are what actually make this movie, as is the idea that filmmaking doesn't have to be any grander than actors having sex. I'll recommend this movie for sheer audacity; Smith and his cast are all brave people, making a movie about a subject some are still very uncomfortable with.",4,Desperate Times Call for Sexy

Twenty years ago it was something quiet and shameful; relegated to curtained-off areas of your local non-chain video store. Before that, all there was were creepy little theatres showing such epics as ""Behind the Green Door"", and ""Deep Throat"".Now, though, it's so mainstream it seems like anyone can do it, and that's the thrust, as it were, of ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", or, as it says on the box where I bought it, ""Zack and Miri"", cause the retailer is willing to make money off it, but they don't want to risk offending anyone who might see the word ""porno"".And make no mistake; this is a potentially very offensive movie. It's also incredibly hilarious, and one of Kevin Smith's best!The plot centers around Zack and Miri, two people in their late-twenties who are desperate for money. They've lost their power, they've lost their water and they're facing eviction. What ever are they to do?Then they come up with an idea: make a porno. Not just any porno, mind you, but ""Star Whores"", a geekfest porno, featuring all the action geeks think they might like to some day see. Events spiral from there, plans get changed, the movie gets changed, and there's a lot of nudity and gross-out humor.I must say, I laughed my backside off at this film. It's like all the best of a Kevin Smith movie mixed with some of Apatow's better works. It's not perfect, but it's pretty darn hilarious! I never laughed so hard as I did when I saw someone get their cake frosted, as it were. Sure, it was predictable, but still great. Plus, hey, as I said in the title, if you've ever wanted to see Jason Mewes naked, now you can.I'm glad to see that Kevin Smith is branching out beyond the View Askewniverse.

1214954,A10FHA5E7VEDTW,B001LM6VV8,Colin Y.,"[1, 2]","While I typically enjoy Kevin Smith's films, I've always been conscious of the fact that he has fairly mediocre skills as a director, and that writing is really where he excels. In all of his previous films, mediocre, simple direction was all that was necessary, but in Zack and Miri, his lack of talent is a great hindrance, especially in his decisions about use of music. Scenes that could have worked are ruined by distracting music; scenes for which a more talented director would have known well enough to turn the volume knob to the left on the mixing board.I'm starting to get tired of Seth Rogen and his one-note acting range. That style has worked in other films, but in Zack and Miri he comes off as too unemotional and buffoonish, especially in later scenes where Zack is supposed to be angry at Miri and all Rogen does to portray this emotion is raise the volume of his voice. The funniest performance in this movie belongs to Jason Mewes, and he has hardly any screen time. Whenever Zack was on screen I found myself asking, ""What is Lester doing right now."" More scenes with Mewes and less with Rogen might have helped this film.I laughed enough to give the film three stars, but this is definitely Smith's worst.",3,Great concept falls flat,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,1227,"['typically', 'enjoy', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'films', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'conscious', 'fact', 'fairly', 'mediocre', 'skills', 'director', 'writing', 'really', 'where', 'previous', 'films', 'mediocre', 'simple', 'direction', 'was', 'was', 'necessary', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'lack', 'talent', 'great', 'hindrance', 'especially', 'decisions', 'use', 'music', 'Scenes', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'are', 'ruined', 'distracting', 'music', 'scenes', 'more', 'talented', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'well', 'enough', 'turn', 'volume', 'knob', 'left', 'mixing', 'board.I', ""'m"", 'starting', 'get', 'tired', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'one-note', 'acting', 'range', 'style', 'worked', 'other', 'films', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'off', 'too', 'unemotional', 'buffoonish', 'especially', 'later', 'scenes', 'where', 'Zack', 'supposed', 'be', 'angry', 'Miri', 'Rogen', 'portray', 'emotion', 'raise', 'volume', 'voice', 'funniest', 'performance', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'hardly', 'screen', 'time', 'Whenever', 'Zack', 'was', 'screen', 'found', 'asking', 'What', 'Lester', 'doing', 'right', 'now', 'More', 'scenes', 'Mewes', 'less', 'Rogen', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'film.I', 'laughed', 'enough', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'definitely', 'Smith', 'worst']",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

Not only is Kevin Smith telegraphing the entire plot of the movie by slapping you in the face with constant and entirely not believable references to the dire financial problems of the movies two main characters (their constant back and forth about bills, rent, the water getting shut off, etc., all of which seems thrown into the movie without any thought), but the vulgar humor is lacking entirely in the humor or creativity part and just seems like Smith is trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard, or, perhaps more accurately, not trying at all. It's as if just saying ridiculous, dumb, offensive things over and over again is meant to be funny. Like if you threw a bunch of porn phrases and swear words from a group of 14 year old boys into a basket and drew them at random to form sentences. That said, if I was in high school still the blatant vulgarity might have seemed daring or novel, but I am not and so alas I was not impressed. I am a big fan of several members of the cast and of movies that could be lumped into this genre, but I am also a fan of decent dialog, a basic level of believability, and characters that are more then one dimensional and have some redeeming qualities and development. This movie lacked what other movies such as 40 Year Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Superbad, and even Step Brothers were able to achieve.

K,"[1, 1]","ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO**** Out of 5Release Date- October 31st, 2008Running Time- 102-MinutesRating- RWriter/Director- Kevin SmithStarring- Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Craig Robinson, Jason Mewes, Jeff Anderson, Traci Lords, Katie Morgan, Rick Mabe, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Brandon Routh and Justin Long as Brandon St. RandyUpon the release of Zack and Miri Make a Porno the movie was getting a lot of negative feedback due to the title, which led to the TV spots to simply call the movie Zack and Miri; I really don't understand why in America people get so uptight when it comes to sex and nudity. What I find funny is it seems violence is ok, but dare have some nudity or the word porn in the title there's this huge uproar. I personally have no problem with violence and sex and nudity in movies if I were to be offended by one it would be violence. I'm actually kind of surprised Kevin Smith even got this movie made, but originally the movie did get an NC-17 rating, which led to cuts to make it R-rated. While I haven't seen it NC-17, but I don't think the movie suffered at all.Zack and Miri rates as one of my favorite comedies of 2008 and while by no means is this a perfect movie it does provide plenty of laughs and all the craziness we've come to know from a Kevin Smith movie. Zack and Miri isn't his best film, but it is another winner in his career.Kevin Smith made his feature film debut in 1994 with the cult classic Clerks and 14-years later came Zack and Miri and Kevin Smith has managed to stay relevant. In the 14-years between movies a lot has changed in the world and a lot has changed in filmmaking and a lot of filmmakers seem to have trouble from going from one era to another. But yet Kevin Smith is one of those few filmmakers that can change with the times, but yet still stay true to what made his career take off. Personally I wouldn't say Zack and Miri is Smith's best work, but one can make a case for it and that seems to be rare in filmmaking.The screenplay by Kevin Smith was top notch; Smith has a style of writing and yet he doesn't simply write the same movie over and over again. Smith I always felt writes excellent dialogue and always has really great characters. And he's able to keep that going here. The characters are great and some of the most entertaining of his career. Kevin Smith does get a little sappy with the script in the 2nd half, but it still has the Smith style of writing so while sappy it's still really funny.As director Kevin Smith does an excellent job; I think most of us could agree that the power of Smith's films is his writing, but he's also an underrated director. Most people cite his writing, which is understandable, but he is a good director and the pacing of Zack and Miri is excellent and the movie is always funny and entertaining. The 2nd half isn't as good as the first half and like I said it can get a little sappy and a bit predictable, but even with that said Kevin Smith still delivers plenty of laughs and moments that are bound to make the viewer smile.When you really break down Kevin Smith's movies there really is a lot of heart in his movies. Smith movies are known for their cursing and or sexual content, which sadly some people find offensive does anybody remember the backlash on Dogma? But when you really break it down there's a lot of heart and charm to Smith's movies and really is a lot more than some people give him credit for.Who knew back when Freaks and Geeks debuted Seth Rogen would become of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Due to his mainstream popularity and the fact he's appeared in so many movies in a short span the backlash is bound to happen. But that's the way it goes; the bigger an actor or filmmaker or even a film gets it seems suddenly the cool thing to do is hate on it. But Seth Rogen is a very gifted comedic actor and can actually handle the dramatic scenes; as a die hard Freaks and Geeks fan it's great to see most of the actors from the show moving on to bigger things. Elizabeth Banks delivers another solid performance I'm really growing quite fond of her and this was her best role and performance to date.Craig Robinson though steals the show just as he did in Pineapple Express. I just love his line delivery. Robison is an actor I hope to see a lot more of. Jeff Anderson is also really funny he has that sarcastic humor to him and he's always great at it. Jason Mewes is well Jason Mewes and like always he rocked the show. Most porn stars rarely make good actors, but Traci Lords does have some talent when given the right role and here she clearly has the right role. Porn star Katie Morgan is surprisingly decent in her role and actually shows she might be able to handle herself in real movies.Brandon Routh and Justin Long are hysterical in a brief, but very memorable scene and look for horror Icon Tom Savini in a cameo as Jenkins. And speaking of Tom Savini I really hope horror fans notice the homage to Dawn of the Dead.Again Zack and Miri isn't a perfect movie, but it is an excellent and funny movie that comes highly recommended to Kevin Smith fans.The Blu-ray release is excellent the picture quality is amazing; the transfer is one of the best out there and the sound is also solid. The disc is jam packed with extras including some behind the scenes and 94-minutes worth of deleted scenes.",4,Excellent another winner from Kevin Smith,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,5344,"['ZACK',

It just gets numbing and tiresome after awhile.  Yes, there is a theme here in that can you fully divorce feeling from the sexual act if you truly love the one your with.  Noble sentiment but it's undermined by the barrage of crude humor.  Smith should look to his predecessors like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, and the Farrelly brothers to see how to pull this off.  Better yet is taking cues from Jud Apatow who probably could mined this material for all it's worth.  It seems like Smith is trying to push the envelope of what you can get away with in an ""R"" rated movie instead making something profound and lasting.

Obraztsov,"[0, 0]","I meant to see this movie a long time ago because I heard pretty great things about it from friends, who said it wasn't just another dumb raunchy movie.  It's similar in style to a Judd Apatow movie with the raunchiness and everything, which are hit and miss for me (the only one I really liked a lot was Pineapple Express), but it just was never super funny to me.  I don't know - I only got maybe one or two laughs from the whole thing.One thing I REALLY hated about it, and what I hate about a lot of these types of comedies, is that they squished a silly romance story into the movie to try to make it more sweet and down-to-earth with more purpose and depth.  I WANT TO WATCH A RIDICULOUSLY INAPPROPRIATE FUNNY MOVIE - if I wanted to watch a chick flick romance movie, then I'd go watch [insert chick flick movie here].  If it was done really well and fit in the story I would like it, but it never works....it's just not that kind of movie.You probably already know the premise - guy named Zack decides making home porno would be a good idea to make money, and gets his female roommate, Miri (who he's not sleeping with), to come along for the ride.  Then they do some ""casting"" for their porno, and there are a few familiar faces, but the only one that I found to be particularly funny was Lester (Jason Mewes as Jay from Jay and Silent Bob), but he's just a funny guy.  And of course, Seth Rogen is bound to make you laugh once in awhile.A chuckle here and there, and that's it - even from my boyfriend who is obsessed with Apatow flicks.  I was hugely disappointed, especially after the good things I heard about it.  What am I missing here?

I wasn't sure what to think from the title, but this really is an impressive effort from the man who created the View Askewniverse.  It's not as puerile or jouvenile as Mallrats or Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back (two fun movies, but not KS's best work).  It's not as spectacular as Clerks or Chasing Amy (two of my all-time favorite comedies), but it is a respectable aim at doing a flick of the same quality in trying to keep Smith in the line of being a legitimate though filthy writer/director.  The script is pure Kevin, beautifully done, but graphic, dirty, abundantly human.  The acting is wonderful and includes Traci Lords as the aging porn star who joins the movie (hard to picture, huh?)  and she still looks pretty good...almost still hot!  Jason Mewes has a tasty role, although not as his signature character Jay, his character is not such a stretch for him.  But he delivers a great performance.  Kevin does not star in the film, but his fingerprints are all over every aspect of this worthwhile flick. Seth Rogen was surprisingly good as Zack and Elizabeth Banks was delicious and wonderful as Miri.  And Jeff Anderson (Randal from ""Clerks"") does a great job in the role of the camera man who shoots the porn flick.  There is plenty of attention paid to the shooting of the porn flick referred to in the title, plenty of female toplessness (tastefully done, of course, in a porno-shooting kind of way...sort of)  And like all of Kevin Smith's best movies, this flick is overall a love story, although it is by no means a chick flick...even if it was possible for a chick flick to have so much female toplessness in it, this just wouldn't fit the mold.  Trust me!  This film is worth a look!

If you think that raunchy material can be funny _if_appropriately_used_, skip this movie--pointless, banal, boring raunch substitutes for humor.This movie has boring dialogue, no sense of pacing, bad transitions, only the pretense of a story arc and an unsatisfying ending.  The movie showed (the characters) Zack et al knowing that even an amateur porno needs to do better than this.Except for Zack, all the characters were badly underwritten, and this was especially notable for the female roles. Elizabeth Banks role was little more than being luminous.  And how could a movie with two porn stars (Lords and Morgan) not have their characters making or responding to comments about their real-life selves?  For this aspect and many more, I disagree with other reviews labeling this movie as formulaic because it so badly botches the formulas that it dishonors that characterization.For me, the only real entertainment value of this movie was its unintended encouragement to enumerate the ways that scenes could have been done so much better.  This is OK, even fun, a couple of times in a movie, but not for the whole movie.At the very end, there is a modestly amusing segment which is an advertisement for the business ""Zack and Miri make YOUR porno"".

1214971,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B001LM6VV8,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[2, 3]","Zack (Seth Rogan) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are two friends who live together.  Surprisingly, unlike most such arrangements, no ""perks"" are included in the deal.  They both have lousy jobs & they're struggling to get along during the middle of a Pittsburgh winter.  They're also not the most responsible people in the world when it comes to the little $$ that they do have.Finally, after falling WAY behind on their bills, they mutually decide to make a porno movie in hopes of defraying the costs of their debts.  Instead of making your standard home-video porn, they try something much more ambitious & hire some other ""Thespians"" to fill out the cast.  These include characters played by real-life porn stars (such as an aging Tracy Lords).The result equals some funny scenes here & there.  However, it seems to me that this movie had SO much more potential than what the final product materialized as.  My biggest ""beef"" with the film was its fixation on bathroom humor.  Not only am I not ""big"" on bathroom humor, but I think that many times it's thrown into movies because the writers couldn't think up anything that was actually funny.In the case of this film, there's a whole host of material they could have drawn right out of porn  - literally.  There could have been funny  & erotic discussions about what each of the pseudo-pornstars was comfortable with on-set.  And, being that Elizabeth Banks is stunningly beautiful & Seth Rogan is a goon, they could have explored the obvious issue of how Miri was SO out of Zack's league.  (Where are the Ron Jeremy allusions when you need them?  Paging Ron Jeremy - you have a phone call on line #1!)While her talents were wasted in this film (kind of like Rachael McAdams inWedding Crashers - Unrated (Widescreen New Line Platinum Series), Elizabeth Banks was not only by-far the most beautiful woman, but also she was by-far the most talented actor/actress.  She caught my eye in her portrayal of Laura Bush inW. (Widescreen)the other night.  I'd like to see much more of her in the future!For all the guys out there who are wondering whether Elizabeth strips down in the movie or not, the answer is ""no.""  Following the usual formula of films in this genre, just about every other woman in the film takes her top off EXCEPT the one you really want to see get naked.  Given the title of the film, that in-itself is a bit of a downer!The 2nd disc does not contain a whole lot of worthwhile material.  In fact, most of it is downright silly special features.  There are 5 mini dual interviews of Seth Rogan & Elizabeth Banks which are semi-interesting.  About the only thing I learned that was curious was that Ms. Banks enjoys watching porn movies in her personal life - which is cool!  Rogan is very annoying in the interviews & seems to think that everything both he & Banks says is hilarious.Overall, this is a semi-funny movie.  It's worth seeing, but probably not more than once.  Right now, more than anything, I'm hoping that it launches Ms. Banks career into higher realms of cinematic productions!",3,I'd rather see just Miri,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,3060,"['Zack', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Miri', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'are', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'live', 'together', 'Surprisingly', 'most', 'such', 'arrangements', 'perks', 'are', 'included', 'deal', 'have', 'lousy', 'jobs', ""'re"", 'struggling', 'get', 'middle', 'Pittsburgh', 'winter', ""'re"", 'also', 'not', 'most', 'responsible', 'people', 'world', 'when', 'little', 'do', 'have.Finally', 'falling', 'WAY', 'bills', 'mutually', 'decide', 'make', 'porno', 'movie', 'hopes', 'defraying', 'costs', 'debts', 'Instead', 'making', 'standard', 'home-video', 'porn', 'try', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'ambitious', 'hire', 'other', 'Thespians', 'fill', 'out', 'cast', 'include', 'characters', 'played', 'real-life', 'porn', 'stars', 'such', 'aging', 'Tracy', 'Lords', '.The', 'result', 'equals', 'funny', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'However', 'movie', 'had', 'SO', 'much', 'more', 'potential', 'what', 'final', 'product', 'materialized', 'biggest', 'beef', 'film', 'was', 'fixation', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'Not', 'only', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'think', 'many', 'times', 'thrown', 'movies', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'up', 'anything', 'was', 'actually', 'case', 'film', 'whole', 'host', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'drawn', 'right', 'porn', 'literally', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'erotic', 'discussions', 'what', 'pseudo-pornstars', 'was', 'comfortable', 'on-set', 'being', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'goon', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'obvious', 'issue', 'how', 'Miri', 'was', 'SO', 'Zack', 'league', 'Where', 'are', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'allusions', 'when', 'need', 'Paging', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'have', 'phone', 'call', 'line', '1', 'talents', 'were', 'wasted', 'film', 'kind', 'Rachael', 'McAdams', 'inWedding', 'Crashers', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'New', 'Line', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'by-far', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'also', 'was', 'by-far', 'most', 'talented', 'actor/actress', 'caught', 'eye', 'portrayal', 'Laura', 'Bush', 'inW', 'Widescreen', 'other', 'night', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'future', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'wondering', 'Elizabeth', 'down', 'movie', 'not', 'answer', 'Following', 'usual', 'formula', 'films', 'genre', 'just', 'other', 'woman', 'film', 'top', 'off', 'one', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'naked', 'Given', 'title', 'film', 'in-itself', 'bit', 'downer', '2nd', 'disc', 'not', 'contain', 'whole', 'lot', 'worthwhile', 'material', 'fact', 'most', 'downright', 'silly', 'special', 'features', 'are', '5', 'mini', 'dual', 'interviews', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'are', 'semi-interesting', 'only', 'thing', 'learned', 'was', 'curious', 'was', 'Ms.', 'Banks', 'watching', 'porn', 'movies', 'personal', 'life', 'cool', 'Rogan', 'very', 'annoying', 'interviews', 'think', 'everything', 'Banks', 'hilarious.Overall', 'semi-funny', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'probably', 'not', 'more', 'once', 'Right', 'now', 'more', 'anything', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'Ms.', 'Banks', 'career', 'higher', 'realms', 'cinematic', 'productions']",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

I suffered through this with my sides splitting as I rolled on the floor - in spite of my squeamish attitude toward X-rated ideals.Let me explain ... Zach (Seth Rogen) and Miriam (""Miri"", Elizabeth Banks) are essentially a married couple who are not married and not even very attracted to each other. That they know of, anyway. Sharing a crummy apartment and getting utilities shut off, one at a time, they attend a ten-year high school reunion where they meet an old pal.Their strapping old friend, Bobby Long (a charming and hilarious Brandon Routh) introduces them to his boyfriend, gay porno star Brandon St. Randy (Justin Long, my hero!!!) - and no, the irony of those names is not supposed to be subtle.The two, Zach and Miri, decide a pornographic film might just make them some money - that is when they discover they are truly in love. I was surprised, but the razor-sharp wit of the dialogue, the humor that cannot be described here, all of it made me think that porno and life may be something other than what we all assumed. With an essential idea borrowed from THE FULL MONTY and Monty Python-style segues, well ....The appearances by Gerry Bednob, Traci Lords and Jason ""Jay"" Mewes (the ""Jay"" half of ""Jay and Silent Bob"") elevate this film to something more than a cheap ANIMAL HOUSE-level comedy. Written and directed by Kevin Smith (the ""Silent Bob"" half of the old team) and shot on location in Pennsylvania, this has to be seen to be believed - and enjoyed fully.A word of warning: I would NOT allow anyone under 18 to view this very adult comedy. I also promise you no regrets for having enjoyed it as I only recently did.

I was extremely excited when I fond out that this movie was coming out, and even more so when I learned Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson would be in this film. Of course I was right there opening day to see the film and at midnight on the 3rd of Feb I was right there to buy the DVD. Naturally everyone showed up at my house at 1:30 in the AM to watch this wonderful film, this seems to be a regular occurrence any time something comes out that our little group likes, even if he had already seen it. So there we were early in the morning with some of us just off work others having to go to work a little later in the AM, and in went the movie. Naturally we all laughed throughout the night enjoying every minute, and we all even stayed up longer to watch the hours of extra features with people leaving one by one to go to work or something. It was not fun to clean my horribly messed up house the next day when I finally awoke, first a night of UFC on Jan 31 and now Kevin's movie on Feb 3rd, boys will be boys I guess or so my girl tells me.Zach and Miri is all about well Zach and Miri and they are a couple of losers who have done nothing with their lives and have not really found each other even though they live together. They start to realize that they have done nothing when the day arrives to go to their high school reunion, fearing that everyone has done better then them each has to come to realize their flaws. Once they return home in the midst of a conversation all of their power goes off, well that is when the electricity goes out the water goes while Miri is taking a shower before they had went to the reunion. Of course you all know the story from here they come to terms with what they must do, [pause for dramatic effect] make a porno. From this point on a group of wonderful, colorful, and dynamic characters come together to tackle this task.When they decide that a porno is the best way to go they put together a great and hilarious group of people and set out to make a great spoof of a film you may have heard of, star wars. But once they have everything together and are ready to go it all goes up in flames [not so literally] when they return to their warehouse to find it being tore down. Once all hope seems lost and they are all down on their luck brilliance strikes Zach, why not make a porno were he works, at a coffee shop. So off we are on a great hilarious yet kinda sweet journey that is a mix of all of Kevin's previous films, all of them. Along the way these band of misfit outcasts come together to make more then a simple porno movie, they find each other as friends and two in particular find love with one another.Kevin Smith is right on point with this film although you can tell that Seth Rogen being apart of this film has had an influence; the jokes come a little faster as is the dialogue. The film is a mix of Kevin's humor and a Judd Apatow type of humor; it turns out to be a very good mix, great even. Smith turns in one of his best films he has been apart of, his writing is just as sharp and the conversations are on point with every one of his films, and his direction is superb. Producer Scott Mosier is back as well thankfully as he goes with Smith like onion with mustard, or did I mean peanut butter and jelly [yeah that's the one], as is DP David Klein who does a masterful job with shooting this film. These guys have come together to create another View Askew classic, I can not go into enough detail about how funny this movie is. The reunion scene is one of my all time favorites, maybe the best in the movie.All of the performances in this film are great, brilliant even as all bring their a-game. Let's start with the two stars of the movie, Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks. Seth is his usual funny self in this movie delivering line after funny line. The thing about Seth is he really seems like an everyday average guy so that makes him really relatable, he seems like a few of guys I know. Elizabeth Banks is wonderful in this film and looks beautiful as one would expect she really is the one who holds this film together. She is very funny especially during the first half of this movie but during the last half she really ups the ante on the dramatic side of this movie. These two make a wonderful on screen team and are very believable as a couple of losers who need to resort to this type of thing.View Askew regulars Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson are back working with Mr. Smith and are brilliant. The thing about this movie is that these two are not the characters that they usually play, Jay [Mewes] and Randal [Anderson], although Anderson played a different character in ""Now You Know"" which he also wrote and directed. And while technically that film was not a View Askew production Kevin Smith did Executive Produce that film as a presenter. Jason Mewes is outstanding as Lester and is a contender as the MVP of the film as he gives a magnificent performance. His character is extremely funny especially during the sex scenes; Jason does a marvelous job in this film. Jeff Anderson does a great job as well as Deacon, the Director of Photography and he is apart of one the funniest and grossest moments in the film.As far as the rest of the cast Craig Robinson is one of the three that is up for MVP of the film, because his performance is outstanding. Every scene that he is in I laughed none stop, his line delivery in second to none and he deserves credit. Ricky Mabe does a great job as well playing Barry and he is also a magnificent actor, he like Jeff is involved in a crazy scene. The two porn stars that are in this are extremely talented as well, and I actually mean their acting abilities. Traci lords is great as Bubbles and her dry laid back performance is just what the movie needed, she did a great job. Katie Morgan did an outstanding job as Stacey the kinda typical blonde; she is also the most nude in this movie but regardless of that she easily is one of the funniest in the film. I was really surprised by these two because like I said they can actually act. Brandon Routh [of Superman fame] is great in this movie as well but it is his partner Justin Long playing Brandon St. Randy who is the other guy up for MVP of the film, Justin is absolutely hilarious in this film. He even does this thing with his voice that takes the character to a whole other level, I will not ruin for you but he is great. Also Gerry Bednob [coffee shop boss], Tyler Labine [drunken customer], Kenny Hotz [Zach 2], and Tisha Campbell-Martin [Craig's wife in the film] all did great jobs with the little time they were on screen, also Tom Savini makes a guest appearance.Another great thing about this movie is the soundtrack; of course Kevin's movies always have good music. Also the special features as with any View Askew Production are great, on disc one you get all the deleted scenes, in fact the deleted scenes all together equal feature length. Also with disc 2 we get the ""Popcorn Porn"" making of feature which is excellent and is a very detailed look at the film from writing it to making it to the fight with the MPAA, excellent documentary. Also included are all of the ""Money Shots"" webisodes which are another more comedic take on the making of the film, also included are ""Outtakes, ad-libs and bloopers"". Still even better we get the Q&A; session from Comic-Con 2008 from the cast and crew, and part 1 of the Seth vs Justin ad-lib battle feature, part two can only be found on the Blockbuster Video rental [contract exclusive or something from the Weinstein Company].This is really one of the best movies I have seen in a while especially a comedy in particular, really it is that good. The entire cast was brilliant and were a wonderful on screen group; all of them need to keep making movies like this. Kevin Smith, Mosier, and Klein all did magnificent jobs and should always continue to work together. I recommend this movie to everybody who likes watching movies; it really is that good, at least to me. As were I would say this may not be for everybody because it is a very strong R, I think that the heart of this film and the sweetness about it will make up for all that. If you are a fan of any of these people or not you will enjoy this movie.",5,KEVIN SMITH COMES WITH ANOTHER CLASSIC,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,8435,"['ZACH', 'MIRIR', 'MAKE', 'A', 'PORNOI', 'have',

I wouldn't say that this is his best movie, because it's not, but it is still pretty good. The problem with this movie is that it just isn't that funny compared to his others. I am not a fan of Seth, but I'm sure die hard fans of Rogen will enjoy this movie more. The movie definitely lives up to its title since there is a lot of softcore porn in this movie, not saying that this is a bad thing. It would kind of be disappointing to have a title like ""Zack and Miri Make A Porno"" and not see anything. If you have ever wanted to know what Jason Mewes looks like completely nude (which I never wanted to know), this is definitely worth the purchase. It's burned into the brainSounds like I am trashing the movie, but I did actually like it. There are some parts that are hilarious in traditional Kevin Smith fashion, in fact a lot of the movie is, but it just isn't his best work. I always hope that his next film is better than the last, and this isn't. For one thing, the end of the movie is weak. If not for the little extra footage during the end credits, the ending would have completely sucked. It just ends without really tying up the loose ends and leaves questions to be answered. Like I said, you get the idea of what happened afterward during the end credits, so be sure to watch to the end!There were some nice cameos in the film, such as Brandon ""Superman"" Routh! Pretty good movie overall, but like I said, I was hoping for Smith's best.

1214981,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B001LM6VV8,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[0, 0]","Have you ever though making a porno would be easy? Then go see Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make a Porno and learn about film production, romance, and alternatives to Ex-Lax and prune juice.Let me say this: I am not your normal Kevin Smith fanboy. I was there when Clerks was released upon the masses to remind people that fantastic comedy does not need a big budget. I was there when my high school past-time was ridiculed, to the point that I stopped going to the mall unless vitally important, with Mallrats. I kept up my fantastic hopes of bedding a hot lesbian with Chasing Amy. I laughed at my lost Catholicism with Dogma.Then came Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Kevin Smith lost a bit of his luster. It wasn't the worst movie ever, it was just the worst Kevin Smith movie, ever. Then came Jersey Girl, which I still haven't seen yet, and may have been/will be a decent movie, once I get over Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Lastly was Clerks II, which I haven't seen thanks to it being visually polar opposite to the first Clerks(i.e. slickly produced, and in color. Those fascists...)So why, after believing those last two Kevin Smith movies were not even worth my time, would I go see Zack and Miri Make A Porno? Simple: Role Models wasn't out yet. And I'm glad it wasn't, because Zack and Miri made me a Kevin Smith fan again.The plot is pretty simple. Two life-long friends, Zack(played by Seth Rogen) and Miri(played by Elizabeth Banks), come under financial duress to the point of having their water and power shut off, and the possibility of eviction. When the platonic couple go to their ten-year high school reunion, they learn that a) the starting quarterback/homecoming king/genuine stud of their class is now gay, and b) his boyfriend(played by Justin Long) makes some serious cash as an actor in gay porn. This news entices Zack and Miri to produce and star in their own porno, which they name Star Whores. With a rag-tag group made up of strippers, a hockey player, coffee baristas, and Jason Mewes, Zack and Miri try to create their movie, and learn a bit about their feelings for each other.There is a lot working for this movie, enough for me to think I'll go see it again, at least when it comes out on DVD. The comedy of the movie is perfect Kevin Smith dialogue. Sure, it's stuff you probably talk to your friends about but larger, more universal. I think that's why Kevin Smith movies always seem to do well. They connect to their viewers as an equal in actions(for the most part.) You're not just watching someone else's life, you're watching your life if these sort of hilarious occurances happened to you.The movie does have a lot of raunchy humor. Many critics wondered what kind of rabbit Smith pulled out of his ass to just get an ""R"" rating. The soon to be infamous ""Ex-Lax alternative"" scene was the pinnacle of the film's toilet humor, which is a high standard but should be expected from a Kevin Smith movie. What would you expect from the man whose first movie climaxed at a girl having sex with a dead guy in the bathroom?The casting was well done. Craig Robinson(now famous as Darryl from NBC's The Office) does a phenomenal job as a supporting actor to Rogen. His racial-heavy jokes at the beginning truly lighten the mood in a movie that starts up, for lack of a more colorful word, depressing. Unfortunately, I fear for Robinson's sake that he may end up type-casted, as this role seems to be ""Darryl with a bit more cash."" Seth Rogen, as is his trademark, seems to be able to blurt out the most absurd things with perfect comedic timing, as usual. Elizabeth Banks shocked me with how composed she truly can be with so much absurdity surrounding her. I was a bit put off by the two trailers I saw before the movie starring her, as that is a pure sign of over-saturation.So what could possibly be wrong with this movie? Not a whole lot, depending on what type of Kevin Smith movie you normally like. This movie has the facade of a ""dick-and-fart-joke"" movie, but at its core is the heart of a romantic comedy, and it doesn't let you forget it. From the time Zack mentions the idea of making a porno to Miri to the end of the movie, the complications to arise out of these two friends having sex on camera is foreshadowed through-out, and it bugged the hell out of me. It was like reading a book, and knowing what was going to happen by the end, but you still wanted to see the ""how."" My favorite Kevin Smith movie, Chasing Amy, did not use this ruse. This foreshadowing problem was heightened during the couple's actual porn scene, which seemed to have no use except to choke the life out of the hilarity of the situation(which was barely saved by the cameraman's quip.)",4,Zack and Miri Make Box Office Bank,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,4717,"['Have', 'ever', 'making', 'porno', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'Then', 'go', 'see', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Zack',

Kevin Smith's movies are his own and while they certainly are filled with obscenities and vulgarity, they nearly always have a deeper thought process involved as well.  Movie critics usually agree with me on this.  If you can get past all of the swearing, there is something to see in this movie.  Kevin Smith has essentially made an EXTREMELY crude story with about 10 minutes of sweetness at the end.  I have to say that despite seeing it only once, this is one of my favorite of Smith's movies (provided the kids are all in bed).

1214986,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B001LM6VV8,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 2]","Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are in trouble. Living together as platonic friends, the two are months behind in their bills, and they find their electric and water shut off the day before Thanksgiving. After their high school reunion they find themselves contemplating what they're next move is going to be when Zack mentions they should make a porno to advertise to their high school e-mail list. Originally, they get a group of friends, strippers, and others to create a movie, but when the place they were planning to shoot is torn down, they revise they're plan and shoot their movie at Zack's workplace; Bean and Gone. Things become even further complicated when feelings surface between Zack and Miri that they had never voiced before.Before Judd Apatow became the king of dirty but sweet comedies, there was Kevin Smith. Kevin Smith has accomplished what many amateur filmmakers dream of accomplishing. In 1993 he filmed Clerks on a shoestring budget of $27,000 by selling his comic book collection and maxing out several credit cards. The film gained some big name fans, went to Cannes and was subsequently bought by Miramax for distribution. Since then Kevin Smith has directed eight movies (and is currently shooting the movie Cop Out with Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan), assisted in writing several others, produced even more, and has helped launch careers including Jason Lee's acting career and was an integral part of getting Good Will Hunting made. On top of that he has a rabid fanbase and three DVD's in his An Evening With Kevin Smith series, which if you have not seen them I highly suggest you check those out as even the most rabid members of his fan base will tell you they're funnier than his movies. The recent explosion of Seth Rogen's career in the profanely sweet movies of Judd Apatow foreshadowed the eventuality of a pairing between Smith and Rogen, the surprise is that it didn't happen sooner (especially considering that Smith is the reason that Rogen wanted to get into movies). With Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Kevin Smith takes only his second stab at leaving behind the Askewniverse (the name given to the fact that six of his movies are interconnected within the same universe) after Jersey Girl. Does Zack and Miri fare better than Jersey Girl?While I was one of the few who actually enjoyed Jersey Girl, Zack and Miri definitely fares much better. Aided by Smith's return to the Askewniverse in Clerks 2, Smith found what he was missing in Jersey Girl that everyone loved in his previous movies: his unique voice. The dialogue here is sharper and sweeter than anything he's written since Chasing Amy, and even with the material dealing with pornography can still appeal to a broad audience thanks to Smith's writing. Smith is also known as a director lacking in visual style, but with Zack and Miri you can really tell that smith is starting to develop his style, probably thanks in part to his recent work in directing the pilot for Reaper. By drawing on his own personal story to create this movie he creates a movie that is original, familiar, and hilarious.Compared to other Kevin Smith films you'll notice that the acting is much better than his previous movies. This isn't a slight on his previous movies, all of which I loved, but he used a lot of amateur actors and friends to make his previous movies. Now he's got more star power behind his movie. With the appearance of Seth Rogen (Knocked Up, Funny People, 40 Year-Old-Virgin), Elizabeth Banks (W., Role Models, Definitely Maybe), Craig Robinson (The Office, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up), and even Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead, From Dusk Till Dawn, Grindhouse: Planet Terror), Kevin Smith's new film is powered a lot more by big name actors. That doesn't mean that he's forgotten about his friends as his wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, his heterosexual life mate Jason Mewes, and Clerks' Jeff Anderson among others who appear throughout the movie.I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie. I'm a member of that rabid fan base I spoke of before, and I list this as favorite Kevin Smith film (even though I'm sure others in that fan base would call me a heretic for saying so). If you like Kevin Smith films, romantic comedies (but don't mind the dirty side), or Judd Apatow films I highly recommend this film. But, of course, when you have a film with the word Porno in the title you might want to watch who you watch it around. There's full frontal male and female nudity as well as lots of sex, most of it extremely cartoonish, but it's sex none-the-less. And that's not even getting into the language of the film, or the legendary crap shot (trying to keep this family friendly, even if I am talking about a movie about making a porn). This movie won't be for everybody, but for the rest of us, it's absolutely hilarious!5/5",5,Zack and Miri Make A Porno,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,4861,"['Zack', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Miri',

1214987,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001LM6VV8,Jason,"[41, 50]","I won't beat around the bush: ""Zack and Miri"" is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a laugh riot from beginning to end, and even after the credits role (hint hint).There is no disguise or misdirection; it's exactly what is expected. It's foul-mouthed concoction of obscenities, smut, juvenile humor, tons of pop-culture references, and a good deal of smart dialogue. It's parody at the pinnacle of the genre, making fun of the 70's and 80's porn industry, when it was in a developmental and transitional phase before today's high-end adult films - or so I've heard anyway. Make no mistake; however, there is also a very serious approach taken (which gets a bit sappy), and true devotion and respect is paid to not only porn (which is odd), but also the hilariously crass Smith (Apatow-esque) comedy (which is expected).  Smith nails it.There are countless highlights and laughs throughout. The best scenes, however, are those leading up to filming of the cheesy porn. Selecting the name for the movie, coming up with ""Star Whores"" (and hilarious names for the rest of the series), while ripping through raunchy variations of several other movies, almost made me convulse from laughter. Some may have a problem believing Seth Rogen as a porn star, thinking the concept as real as the silicone on a typical adult set, but Ron Jeremy pretty much negates that argument. There is no doubt, however, that Elizabeth Banks could easily be a megastar if she were to turn to the dark side. Their onset chemistry is definitely what makes the movie work.It's definitely not for the easily offended. I'd go so far as to say that it's a fairly smart comedy if one can get around perpetual F-Bombs. It's a witty movie about raunchy intercourse that pushes the socially inhibition and sexually awkward buttons.The way I see it, there are two groups of people who will watch this movie. One group knows what they are getting into; they're going to see a Kevin Smith flick that is sure to be crude and contain poop humor. The other group will be people who will frown at the profanities and cover their eyes at the vulgarity. To the former I say: You'll absolutely bust a gut watching this movie. I know I did. To the latter I say: What the heck were you expecting? Are you really so dumb as to not know what you were about to watch? It's called ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" for goodness sakes! Go watch a nice chick-flick or a documentary instead.In closing, this was the best comedy of 2008, and it's not even close.

1214989,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B001LM6VV8,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[5, 14]","Director Kevin Smith brings to us yet another, endless, boring psuedo-comedy about slackers. Guess who plays the Star Slacker? Uh huh. Seth Rogan. We're supposed to fall in love with this flabby, overweight guy with bad skin and who has a tendency to shout and scream. By putting the F word before every other word is supposd to make his dialogue real,I guess.It wasn't too bad in ""Knocked Up"" because he was charming and lovable in a schlubby way. Yet, he had a tendency even then to scream and shout too much to get his point across. In this dreary, shabby mess, we're supposed to believe that he needs money so bad--but doesn't want to work for it--that he makes a porno movie. The triple-X movie he finally makes is so poorly produced, with everyone mocking your usual porno flick, that it falls totally flat. Especially when he strips and gets his chance to do nasty things in front of the camera.Does the director, cast and writers really believe any retardate would want to see a movie that the characters make that's done so hideously? The whole movie has an unwashed, shabby, grungy air to it--from the sloppy, greasy clothes most of the performers wear to their dull, dreary personalities?

1214996,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001LM6VV8,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Kevin Smith's most recent directorial effort Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a funny, disarmingly charming film starring one of Hollywood's hottest comedians Seth Rogen.The story is simple enough. Zack (Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are two platonic roommates constantly struggling to keep up with their bills. The night of their high school reunion, things go from bad to worse when their water and power get shut off. In a state of dire financial crisis, they desperately look for a way to solve their problems. Their idea? Make a porno! It could take care of all their financial debts, but what will it do to their friendship?As you can imagine, the scenes of them getting together a cast and crew to make their film and the scenes of them actually filming it are hilarious and Smith does not come up short on bringing an array of familiar faces to the film.There's a couple of real life current and former adult film stars in the cast, notably Traci Lords (as Bubbles) and Katie Morgan (as Stacey). Also, Jason Mewes shedding his Jay persona to play clueless aspiring adult film star Lester. Craig Robinson (you'll remember him fromPineapple Express (Two-Disc Unrated Edition + Digital Copy)) as the producer, Delaney. Jeff Anderson (Randall fromClerks (Collector's Series)) rounds out the cast as the cinematographer. All are hilariously funny, as are those who show up in cameo roles, notably Justin Long and Brandon Routh of Superman fame.Kevin Smith fans should not be disappointed as the film establishes itself as a Smith movie immediately; dirty, witty dialogue, memorable characters, etc. While it walks a very fine line with realism (as all Smith films do), it is instantly charming.Those who are easily offended should steer clear from this film (save it some one-star reviews certainly), as there's content here to offend just about anyone.Despite being a dirty, even vulgar movie it also has a sensitivity only Smith could pull off. He does a really good job at manipulating his audience into caring about these characters, but credit must also be given to the cast.Rogen and Banks are perfectly cast as the two roommates who have never done anything remotely sexual with each other. Rogen isn't playing a character far removed from what he's done before, but his shtick works. Banks has a very disarming quality about her and is sort of effortlessly funny.Robinson, as Delaney, is stand-out. He has this deadpan way of saying his lines that only he could pull off. His first scene, where he points out to his boss how racist it is to ask him to work on Black Friday is one of the funniest scenes in the movie.The film's two major flaws are the sensitive aspects and the last 20 minutes or so. I applaud Smith for bringing this sensitivity to the film, but there are times where he really seems to be hammering it home. Finally, the last 20 minutes seemed convoluted to me. Like Smith knew how he wanted Zack and Miri to end up, but just didn't know how to get them there.Besides that, the film has all the ingredients of a satisfactory Kevin Smith film and may even succeed at garnering him some new fans. The film is funny throughout, with moments of total hilarity and this humor doesn't stop until midway through the credits. Not a great film, but a very good comedy.GRADE: B",4,"A Funny, Surprisingly Heartfelt Outing from Kevin Smith",1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,3297,"['Kevin', 'Smith', 'most', 'recent', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'Make', 'Porno', 'funny', 'disarmingly', 'charming', 'film', 'starring', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'hottest', 'comedians', 'Seth', 'Rogen.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'Zack', 'Rogen', 'Miri', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'are', 'two', 'platonic', 'roommates', 'constantly', 'struggling', 'keep', 'up', 'bills', 'night', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'water', 'power', 'get', 'shut', 'off', 'state', 'dire', 'financial', 'crisis', 'desperately', 'look', 'way', 'solve', 'problems', 'idea', 'Make', 'porno', 'could', 'take', 'care', 'financial', 'debts', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'friendship', 'can', 'imagine', 'scenes', 'getting', 'together', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'film', 'scenes', 'actually', 'filming', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Smith', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'bringing', 'array', 'familiar', 'film.There', 'couple', 'real', 'life', 'current', 'former', 'adult', 'film', 'stars', 'cast', 'notably', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'Bubbles', 'Katie', 'Morgan', 'Stacey', 'Also', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'shedding', 'Jay', 'persona', 'play', 'clueless', 'aspiring', 'adult', 'film', 'star', 'Lester', 'Craig', 'Robinson', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'fromPineapple', 'Express', 'Two-Disc', 'Unrated', 'Edition', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'producer', 'Delaney', 'Jeff', 'Anderson', 'Randall', 'fromClerks', 'Collector', 'Series', 'out', 'cast', 'cinematographer', 'are', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'are', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'cameo', 'roles', 'notably', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'fame.Kevin', 'Smith', 'fans', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Smith', 'movie', 'immediately', 'dirty', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'memorable', 'characters', 'etc', 'very', 'fine', 'line', 'realism', 'Smith', 'films', 'do', 'instantly', 'charming.Those', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'film', 'save', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'certainly', 'content', 'here', 'offend', 'just', 'anyone.Despite', 'being', 'dirty', 'even', 'vulgar', 'movie', 'also', 'sensitivity', 'only', 'Smith', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'manipulating', 'audience', 'caring', 'characters', 'credit', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'cast.Rogen', 'Banks', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'two', 'roommates', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'remotely', 'sexual', 'other', 'Rogen', ""n't"", 'playing', 'character', 'far', 'removed', 'what', 'done', 'before', 'shtick', 'works', 'Banks', 'very', 'disarming', 'quality', 'sort', 'effortlessly', 'funny.Robinson', 'Delaney', 'stand-out', 'deadpan', 'way', 'saying', 'lines', 'only', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'boss', 'how', 'racist', 'ask', 'work', 'Black', 'Friday', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie.The', 'film', 'two', 'major', 'flaws', 'are', 'sensitive', 'aspects', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'applaud', 'Smith', 'bringing', 'sensitivity', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'really', 'be', 'hammering', 'home', 'Finally', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'convoluted', 'Smith', 'knew', 'how', 'wanted', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'get', 'there.Besides', 'film', 'ingredients', 'satisfactory', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'film', 'may', 'even', 'succeed', 'garnering', 'new', 'fans', 'film', 'funny', 'moments', 'total', 'hilarity', 'humor', ""n't"", 'stop', 'midway', 'credits', 'Not', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'comedy.GRADE', 'B']",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

In the movie ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" you get to see male nudity and now here, and it is a nice change for us females! The plot was great, and all the actors were great. Amidst all of the sex and laughter, a love story was worked into the plot, which makes the movie phenomenal!

They cannot afford to pay the rent.  Zack comes up with the idea to make a porno to make some money.  Sure, they will have to cross a line in their friendship, but it will help them get back on their feet again.  After all, it is just sex.  They enlist the help of some friends, and set up at the local coffee shop where they work.  Of course, things never go as smoothly as planned.I had somewhat high expectations for ""Zack and Miri"", and was let down.  That it is no where as funny as I had hoped was the biggest problem.  Rogen, who has had a string of successful comedies over the past few years is finally working outside the Judd Apatow group, and he is a bit flat.

1215005,A1FG91CM8221X1,B001LM6VV8,Miles D. Moore,"[0, 0]","Kevin Smith's ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" has been receiving notably worse reviews than equivalent efforts by Judd Apatow & Co., and I don't know why. Smith is a more ragged filmmaker than Apatow, which may make the on-screen raunch and nonstop profanity stand out more for most audiences. (The flick's main grossout scene, about three-quarters of the way through, is indeed the yuckiest in the history of grossout comedies--and also one of the funniest, redefining the concept of ""in your face."") In any case, I found ""Zack and Miri"" every bit as charming as ""Superbad"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and more so than ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" or ""Knocked Up."" Elizabeth Banks and Apatow regular Seth Rogen are thoroughly lovable as the sad-sack platonic roommates who decide to make a porno film to solve their pressing cash flow problems, and the rest of the cast is hilarious--especially Craig Robinson and Jason Mewes, who steal every scene they're in. Normally I'm not a Smith fan--I kind of liked ""Dogma,"" but ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy"" left me cold. ""Zack and Miri,"" however, I found an enjoyably lighthearted romantic comedy.

1215019,A3GAY5VH2LDFWK,B001LM6VV8,"Patrick A. Kellner ""PAK""","[3, 6]","""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", written and directed by Kevin Smith.Zack (Seth Rogan) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are long time friends with no romantic connection although their involvement in one another's life is like that of a couple including their shared residence. Their 10 year high school reunion is rapidly approaching and even though neither has advanced much in life, which is evident in their inability to pay their bills, they still plan to attend each with their own agenda. While getting ready for the reunion the water is turned off because the bill hasn't been paid. Next comes the electricity and if some money doesn't show up soon Zack and Miri could be on the street. Zack has already gotten an advance on his paycheck so with that option off the table there is only one thing they can do to come up with the money, you guessed it, make a porno...I should start off by saying that I am a long time Kevin Smith fan. I own all of his movies including the re-released versions of ""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats (10th Anniversary Extended Edition)"", I own movie posters from most of the movies, some of which I paid to have signed and I even traveled to Philly on my own dime to be an extra in ""Jersey Girl"". Having said that you could probably guess that I have been waiting for Kevin's next release; unfortunately ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" was a swing and a miss.The Good: Some of the typical Smith brand of humor is present and works but not nearly to the level that it normally does. The acting all around was well done and I was especially impressed with Jeff Anderson's performance. He seems to improve a little each time he gets back in front of the camera. The look and sound of the movie were fine and was pleasantly surprised to hear some Primus attached to the soundtrack.The Bad: A lot of the humor felt forced and just didn't work. Granted there were some funny moments but for every 1 of those there were 2 attempts that failed. The dialogue which is usually Kevin's specialty felt off for some reason as well.

1215025,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,B001LM6VV8,rareoopdvds,"[6, 12]","Ok, so the name of the film really tells you what the movie is about. It tells you who is involved, and what they are going to do. The only details not in the title is why they are making one. Maybe it should have been called ""Zach and Miri Make a Porno to Pay Their Rent"".But the title that writer-director Kevin Smith offers is actually an irrelevant story line and is only supportive of what the film is really about. The title is just a means of titilating the audience and get everyone all juiced up to have a mainstream comedy with the word ""porno"" in it. Further, when the MPAA originally ruled an NC-17 rating, Kevin Smith argued that the only reason they were giving that rating was because the word ""porno"" was in the title and that the film really does not focus on the porno itself, but that it shows the making of one, and that the scenes were done tastefully. So, its just a means for Kevin Smith to grandstand that the MPAA are ridiculous and are only reacting to the word porno, etc, blah, blah.In the end, the movie is only partially funny. As I said, the porno part is just an anchor for the audience to see the film. If it was called ""Zach and Miri Bakes a Cake"" or ""Zach and Miri Make a Country Western Musical"" or ""Zach and Miri Make a Steaming Pile of Doodoo"", the story would be the same. Would it be as funny? Possibly. Seth Rogan as Zach, who has had a lifetime crush on his best friend and current roommate works at a coffeeshop. Rogen is funny and whether Kevin Smith or Judd Apatow is writing, Rogen is going to be swearing and making lots of sex jokes. Miri, played by Elizabeth Banks, is helpless in finding the right guy for herself and instead just has lots of sex. Both of the characters come off as a trashy country bumpkins who have no aspiration in life except to pay next months rent.So what is to become of these two once the electricity is turned off? Its evident from the get-go that they want to have sex with each other, as much as they both deny it. Whether they truly like each other or that they are stuck with each other in life are two different stories all together. But now its up to them to put together their brains to come up with a way to pay for the electric bill. They cant pay the electric bill, but can buy off Amazon and have a MacBook. Why not sell the MacBook? Thats got to be at least 1000 bucks! Yeah...I know, sometimes we want to maintain a lifestyle, even at the cost of losing electricity.So the idea of making a porn is hatched and they get all the right people at the right time with enough money to make it happen. Supporting characters are Craig Robinson (from the Office) as Delaney who produces the movie; Jason Mewes (from Previous Kevin Smith films) as Lester who is an actor in the porno; Katie Morgan (a real porn star) as one of the porn actresses Stacey; Traci Lords (former porn star turned legit actress) as Bubbles; and Jeff Anderson (from Clerks 1 & 2) as Deacon, one of the actors in the porno. None of these characters are particularly funny. Nobody seems to have any quirks or even funny dialogue. The situations are not funny either. Traci Lords is wasted and used only for namesake (why bother!). So whats left?The main thrust of the story is Zach and Miri's relationship who treat their feelings for each other like a white elephant. And this is the only story that really matters (or exists). There is really no sub plot, everything else is a convenience for this story to happen. Like I said, it does not matter if they made a porno or not. Its an easy way for them to have sex and find out that they like each other more than they knew beforehand.The movie is not sleazy, even if it does rely on base humor for its comedy, but its missing something that has made other Kevin Smith films both funny and endearing. Chasing Amy and Clerks have a dimension of the characters that can relate to the other, each in their unique way that is not present in Zach and Miri. As a comedy, the idea has so much potential and who better to handle it than the Smith/Apatow/Office group? Unfortunately, this is not the time it does happen.As I said, the full title of Zach and Miri Make a Porno explains the film. When it was released, many news papers would not allow the full title and only published ""Zach and Miri"". When this DVD was released, similarly Wal-Mart and Target did not want the full title on the DVD cover. So yes, there are 2 versions of the title being published. But really, it does not matter if they are making a porno or baking a cake, the outcome will be the same - that its not that funny of a movie.",2,Romantic Porno Comedy,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,4600,"['Ok', 'name', 'film', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'who', 'involved', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'only', 'details', 'not', 'title', 'why', 'are', 'making', 'one', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Zach', 'Miri', 'Make', 'Porno', 'Pay', 'Rent', 'title', 'writer-director', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'offers', 'actually', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'line', 'only', 'supportive', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'title', 'just', 'means', 'titilating', 'audience', 'get', 'everyone', 'juiced', 'up', 'have', 'mainstream', 'comedy', 'word', 'porno', 'Further', 'when', 'MPAA', 'originally', 'ruled', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'argued', 'only', 'reason', 'were', 'giving', 'rating', 'was', 'word', 'porno', 'was', 'title', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'focus', 'porno', 'making', 'one', 'scenes', 'were', 'done', 'tastefully', 'So', 'just', 'means', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'grandstand', 'MPAA', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'only', 'reacting', 'word', 'porno', 'etc', 'blah', 'blah.In', 'end', 'movie', 'only', 'partially', 'funny', 'said', 'porno', 'part', 'just', 'anchor', 'audience', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'called', 'Zach', 'Miri', 'Bakes', 'Cake', 'Zach', 'Miri', 'Make', 'Country', 'Western', 'Musical', 'Zach', 'Miri', 'Make', 'Steaming', 'Pile', 'Doodoo', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'Would', 'be', 'funny', 'Possibly', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Zach', 'who', 'had', 'lifetime', 'crush', 'best', 'friend', 'current', 'roommate', 'works', 'coffeeshop', 'Rogen', 'funny', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'writing', 'Rogen', 'going', 'be', 'swearing', 'making', 'lots', 'sex', 'jokes', 'Miri', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'helpless', 'finding', 'right', 'guy', 'herself', 'instead', 'just', 'lots', 'sex', 'characters', 'come', 'off', 'trashy', 'country', 'bumpkins', 'who', 'have', 'aspiration', 'life', 'pay', 'next', 'months', 'rent.So', 'what', 'become', 'two', 'once', 'electricity', 'turned', 'off', 'evident', 'get-go', 'want', 'have', 'sex', 'other', 'as', 'much', 'deny', 'truly', 'other', 'are', 'stuck', 'other', 'life', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'stories', 'together', 'now', 'up', 'put', 'together', 'brains', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'pay', 'electric', 'bill', 'cant', 'pay', 'electric', 'bill', 'can', 'buy', 'off', 'Amazon', 'have', 'MacBook', 'Why', 'not', 'sell', 'MacBook', 'Thats', 'got', 'be', 'least', '1000', 'bucks', 'Yeah', 'know', 'sometimes', 'want', 'maintain', 'lifestyle', 'even', 'cost', 'losing', 'electricity.So', 'idea', 'making', 'porn', 'hatched', 'get', 'right', 'people', 'right', 'time', 'enough', 'money', 'make', 'happen', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'Office', 'Delaney', 'who', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Previous', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'films', 'Lester', 'who', 'actor', 'porno', 'Katie', 'Morgan', 'real', 'porn', 'star', 'one', 'porn', 'actresses', 'Stacey', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'former', 'porn', 'star', 'turned', 'legit', 'actress', 'Bubbles', 'Jeff', 'Anderson', 'Clerks', '1', '2', 'Deacon', 'one', 'actors', 'porno', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Nobody', 'have', 'quirks', 'even', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'either', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'wasted', 'used', 'only', 'namesake', 'why', 'bother', 'So', 'whats', 'left', 'main', 'thrust', 'story', 'Zach', 'Miri', 'relationship', 'who', 'treat', 'feelings', 'other', 'white', 'elephant', 'only', 'story', 'really', 'matters', 'really', 'sub', 'plot', 'everything', 'else', 'convenience', 'story', 'happen', 'said', 'not', 'matter', 'made', 'porno', 'not', 'easy', 'way', 'have', 'sex', 'find', 'out', 'like', 'other', 'more', 'knew', 'beforehand.The', 'movie', 'not', 'sleazy', 'even', 'rely', 'base', 'humor', 'comedy', 'missing', 'something', 'made', 'other', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'films', 'funny', 'endearing', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Clerks', 'have', 'dimension', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'other', 'unique', 'way', 'not', 'present', 'Zach', 'Miri', 'comedy', 'idea', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'who', 'better', 'handle', 'Smith/Apatow/Office', 'group', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'time', 'happen.As', 'said', 'full', 'title', 'Zach', 'Miri', 'Make', 'Porno', 'film', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'many', 'news', 'papers', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'full', 'title', 'only', 'published', 'Zach', 'Miri', 'When', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'similarly', 'Wal-Mart', 'Target', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'full', 'title', 'DVD', 'cover', 'So', 'yes', 'are', '2', 'versions', 'title', 'being', 'published', 'really', 'not', 'matter', 'are', 'making', 'porno', 'baking', 'cake', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'not', 'funny', 'movie']",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

1215029,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001LM6VV8,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","First there was Kevin Smith, with his patented brand of hugely over-the-top raunch in CLERKS.  As he ""matured,"" he added a level of true feeling behind this work in CHASING AMY.  And then he sort of lost his way with a few pretty awful films.  Meanwhile, Judd Apatow established himself as the King of Sweet Raunch with 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, KNOCKED UP, SUPERBAD, etc.  In these films, the characters spoke about sex with a level of filthy detail never before heard.  They indulged in reckless behavior.  They were the kinds of people films had for decades told us were ""bad.""  Yet we recognized people we knew in them, or even ourselves.  They were also infused with an innocence and an acknowledgement that behind all the strutting bluster, we all just want to be loved.  They acknowledged the weakness in men, and the strength in women who can make these men pull themselves up by their bootstraps and start to take life seriously.  This was the Apatow ""brand.""Now Kevin Smith has come storming back to reclaim his part of that little mountain.  While his ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO doesn't re-establish him as King, it reminds us that Apatow and others owe him a debt...and that he's still capable of out-raunching the raunchiest stuff we've seen.  And, as will be no surprise to anyone who has seen the trailers for the film, he mixes in the ""sweet"" stuff pretty well too.The presence of Apatow disciple Seth Rogan makes the film seem more like an Apatow film than perhaps it really is.  For example, in movies like SUPERBAD, there is actually relatively little sex being had.  Characters talk about it, and they sure would like to be indulging in it...but not much happens.  In ZACK & MIRI, a great deal of sex is had and shown.  It is a far more visually explicit movie than Apatow's (the full frontal male nudity in WALK HARD being a notable exception).  I wouldn't want to compare the level of explicit imagery in the dialogue side by side with a SUPERBAD, but I suspect that ZACK & MIRI is also verbally just a smidge more explicit as well.Zack (Rogan) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have been friends since first grade, and now, on the eve of their 10th High School Reunion, they are roommates sharing  a rundown rental and one very run down car.  They both have dead-end jobs and apparently no ambition.  They also have not paid bills in quite awhile.  While neither seems exactly HAPPY with life, both are content in the little routines they have to get through the day.Miri forces Zack to go with her to the reunion, because she's hoping to shamelessly throw herself at the ""boy"" she crushed on in school (Brandon Routh). Zack, meanwhile, has an interesting conversation with this guys boyfriend (a hilarious Justin Long, as we've never seen him), who apparently is a well-known gay porn actor.  Naturally, Miri is crushed to find this guy she intended to sleep with is gay, but the two are more upset to find their hot water and electricity has been turned off.  But Zack comes up with the ""great"" idea to make a pornographic movie in order to pay their bills.I won't dwell on the specifics anymore, but you can imagine how things might develop.  The two hapless friends have no money and no video camera, so they have to turn to friends to underwrite their crazy venture, and an unlikely troupe of filmmakers develops.  There are obligatory scenes of auditions and the struggle to come up with the right title for the film.  (If this weren't a ""family"" site, I'd share a few...the one involving a twist on LAWRENCE OF ARABIA just about made me spew soda through my nose)It's all quite, quite raunchy.  While not literally as explicit as a real porn film, not all that much is held back.  I can sure see why Smith had to fight to avoid an NC-17 rating.  Under absolutely no circumstances to you want to see this film with your kids...no matter how old your kids are!Will Zack & Miri find out they are right for each other?  Will doing porn ruin their discovery?  The film holds few plot related surprises, frankly.  It is the verbal dazzle that keeps you entertained.And the performances.  Seth Rogan pretty much gives us the same character again...but he does have an ease about his acting that makes him enjoyable.  His characters may be insecure, but Rogan is not.  But it is Elizabeth Banks who surprises the most.  I've seen her in a lot of smaller roles (on ""Scrubs"", for example) and to be honest, she's struck me as vaguely perky but lightweight.  Here, it is frankly a bit startling to see her right in this raunchy mix, her mouth as dirty as anyone else.  Smith has empowered her, that's for sure (don't know if that's a good thing for ""society"" or not).  She also finds some true depths in Miri, particularly as the film winds down, that elevate her performance to a special level.  It's not Oscar winning stuff, exactly, but it will make people sit up and take notice of her.  This, and her praised performance in W., have made it quite a good year for her.The movie is hilarious.  That's what you want to know, isn't it?  My wife and I both laughed uproariously many time.  It will offend you, too.  Smith loses control a few times, with some random scenes that grind the story to a halt.  Most revolved around the character played by Jason Mewes (better known as ""Jay"" in a myrid of Smith's earlier films) a young man who makes it into the film due to some ""special talent.""  He's funny, but his stuff seems out of place...as though Smith stopped his movie to let his old buddy riff on some dirty stuff.  There's also some stuff about a constipated actress that devolves into the nastiest couple of seconds you've ever seen, that even so are unbelievable, unlikely, unfunny AND distract from a key moment for the story.(By the way, I apologize if I've offended anyone with the review...tough to talk much about this film without stretching the boundaries a little.  If you find my review offensive...please skip the film.)Overall, Smith has made a funny and sometimes tender film.  If Judd Apatow had never existed, this film would be groundbreaking.  Now it is a familiar formula, with the raunchy dial turned to 11.  But, if that's something you've enjoyed before, you'll get many big laughs from ZACK  & MIRI!",4,"Funny, dirty, raunchy stuff!!

This movie is made in a way very similar to Apatow's style. Smith is funnier than Apatow but Apatow may be the slightly better story teller; albeit not a very original one. I want to make this 4 stars because funny comedies are hard to come by and this is a funny movie. However the ""artistic sensitivities"" used for this movie destroy it. I expected the language (Smith failed to use his expletives as witty as he has in the past, here they are more casual and typical), I was a little surprised by the soft porn, but it was the graphic nudity that I thought unnecessary (Jason Mewes utilizes a penis pump for his nude scene). Kevin, dont listen to Apatow, this sort of stuff is not shocking anymore nor is it funny, its more annoying (everyone is doing it). I suppose if I were a 12 or 16 year old viewer this sort of thing would be shocking and have some value as word of mouth advertising. Is the gratuitous nudity in this film just a gimmick? Yes, I think so. Ultimately, because I thought much of the dialogue was weak I rate this movie 3 stars. I still recommend it to fans of comedy (even if it is a bit childish, more characteristic of Apatow's influence).MAD PROPS for casting Craig Robinson as ""Delany"", he and Luis Guzman have some of the strongest comedic presences in the movies but yet don't get much work (Ill let you speculate as to why).

1215037,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B001LM6VV8,S. Schell,"[0, 0]","First, a word to those whose sensibilities are easily offended by that most taboo of subjects called sex: don't bother picking up this movie.  The title alone should be enough to indicate that it will offend some people beyond belief or have their cheeks scarlet from its frankness, but just in case you weren't sure how candid it can get, read on.The film begins with a typical winter morning in the house where Miriam ""Miri"" Linky (Banks) and Zack Brown (Rogen) cohabitate in the sleepy town of Monroeville, PA.  Zack and Miri have known each other since grade school and both seem to be stringently seated in the ""friend zone"", neither of them batting an eye at the others sexual escapades.  Behind on their bills, they slowly lose each of their precious utilities (water, electric) and after a visit to their 10-year high school reunion goes curiously awry, they find themselves in a bar contemplating the most racy of personal fundraisers: making a homemade pornographic film.  Determined to get themselves out of their financial hole, they recruit their friend and fellow Bean N' Gone Coffee Shop employee Delaney (Robinson) as a producer on the film and amateur hockey player Deacon (Anderson) as cinematographer and begin their casting call, reeling in some of the kookiest cast members ever seen (Lords, Mewes, Mabe, Morgan).Zack and Miri's risky business venture soon becomes a personal matter once their turn comes to have sex on camera, the romance that involves it catching them both off guard.  Things get complicated rather quickly and though the two of them swore in the beginning that they wouldn't allow sex to change the nature of their friendship, both find themselves at odds with the possibility of the other being physically intimate with another member of the cast.  In denial of their love for one another and jealousies brewing, the project quickly falls apart and the two of them are left to sort out what went wrong between them and whether their relationship can be saved.Very much on par with Smith's 1997 romantic comedy ""Chasing Amy"", the film waxes relationships, homosexuality, physical intimacy and the power of friendship.  Of course, one wonders at how explicit the content might be with the word ""porno"" in the title and it does not disappoint on that front.  Chock-full of explicit sexual content (there is even full-frontal male nudity included), it almost didn't get the R rating it fought for, the MPAA stubbornly stuck on a NC-17 rating even after Smith's first two edits (it earned its ""R"" after an appeal).  Even the film's title proved to be problematic, many cities balking at the words ""make a porno"" appearing on movie posters and images of Rogen and Banks implying they were engaging in oral sex sending people into an uproar (which had Smith changing the ads to stick figures instead of real people).  Smith, no stranger to controversy after the bedlam that resulted from ""Dogma"", completes his raunchfest with superfluous use of the ""F"" word (the tally stands at 229, rivaling that of ""Clerks II"" at 224).Rogen is a cute, lovable slacker as Zack and handles Smith's script with ease, Banks his supreme counterpart - both feed off the other with a continuous comedic harmony, creating some of the best on-screen chemistry ever seen in a romantic comedy (Banks even said of Rogen that he was her ""acting soul mate"").  Craig Robinson is another angry black man with a measured amount of abdication in the vein of Hooper X (Chasing Amy) and works well with Rogen - his verbal stand-offs (in the movie and the extras) with the crotchety Indian owner of Bean N'Gone are boisterously entertaining.  Of course, a film of this nature just wouldn't be complete without a real adult film veteran and Smith recruited the infamous Traci Lords for the part of Bubbles, a role that she performs with conspicuous zeal. Justin Long is a scene-stealer as Brandon, a gay porn star who attends Zack and Miri's high school reunion with a most unexpected companion.  The DVD includes extras that have him and Rogen battling for ""improvisational supremacy"", Long managing to keep a straight face while Rogen loses it time and again, his dorky laugh and sputtering lip tickling the movie's extras in the background as well.  ""Deleted Scenes"" contains a wealth of deleted and extended material, including an ad for a gay porn film that has Long sporting some more of his amusing caricature.Bottom line: ""Zack and Miri Make A Porno"" does just what its controversial epithet denotes but Smith cleverly fools his audience into caring for his characters and sweetens all the lust with a good dose of love. Fans of his films will eat this up for all its kinky glory and those drawn in simply by the subject matter will view it out of a curiosity that can't be fought.  No matter a cheek rouged or a mouth agape from his unabashed sincerity, Smith's voice in the filmmaking community simply cannot be ignored.",5,Down and Drrrty,1242777600,"05 20,

""American Pie"" comes to mind, as does ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin.""  Don't get me wrong.  There's some really funny, creative comedy in those movies, and I about fell off an elliptical once while watching ""Superbad"" because I was laughing so hard.  I just mean that the plots aren't going to rivet you, the dialogue isn't going to be enlightening so much as it is wickedly creative or just plain nasty.  And funny.  ""Zach and Miri Make a Porno"" is exactly that kind of movie.  Its story -- that two sexless roommates decide to make a porn film to help pay the rent -- is utter tripe and so well beyond anything resembling reality, you just have to smile and go with it.  Seth Rogen, who is funnier than he looks, is Zach, and Elizabeth Banks, who is prettier than she is funny, is Miri, and they make perfect sense as sexless roommates, and, hard as it is to believe, as a couple that never realized how much they loved each other.  It's a testament to the charm of a movie that drops the F-bomb at least 200 times and features enough nudity and bodily functions to remind me of college that somehow the romance seems sweet and more important than the rest.  I won't say much more -- ""Zach and Miri Make a Porno"" is about the experience, not the idea, and though Kevin Smith does a Judd Apatow impression, he makes a movie that seems much more put-together than his usual Gen-X sketchiness.  One more word, though, about the romantic angle.  It manages to make you believe the cliches that wrongs in love can be righted, that second and even third chances are possible if people truly love each other, and that two people who should be together actually make it.

1215040,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B001LM6VV8,Steve,"[3, 5]","Amazingly, Zack and Miri is a surprisingly tame and boring movie. The premise is interesting, but the assumptions are completely wrong. Maybe this movie would've worked in a different era, but now, with porn available for free in so many formats, the idea that people can get rich by making really awful porn is ridiculous and out-dated. Even the venue is wrong, since the money to be made by independent amateurs is on the internet and not in video. The story line even underscores that with the granny-panties thread, but Smith fails to see his own mistake. It's wrong to cast this issue aside, since it's the entire premise of the movie: how can people avoid immediate poverty? Make a low-budget porno! Not likely. I just can't imagine that many people would buy their awful skin flick given the unending amount of porn that is available for every possible taste. Sadly, a more realistic business venture is offered in the middle of the credits, but by then, what's the point?Kevin Smith is arguably one of the more over-rated film makers around. He had some decent successes with Mallrats and Chasing Amy and he broke plenty of new ground with his willingness to speak frankly about sex and relationships and honor the slacker in all of us, but he has clearly demonstrated his narrow capabilities since then because everything he has made afterward is largely a re-tread. Seth Rogen is his typical slacker self, Elizabeth Banks turns in the requisite impossible-that-she-would-in-any-universe-fall-for-Seth-Rogen role with about as much believability as one could muster, and the standard Smith vets do their standard Smith character turns. As for the rest, Traci Lords is cheap porn resume filler who can't act to save her life and the only real raunch comes from Jason Mewes and the other porn vet, Katie Morgan. The standard locker-room sex talk and bowel movement lines are beyond boring at this point in the 21st century, and so we are left with a thinly developed romance. That's the problem with the current crop of raunchy romances; the R-rated parts are pass&eacute; and the romance stories are contrived, obvious, lacking in drama, and scarcely plausible. This genre has become such an utter clich&eacute; as to make the very genre they are attempting to replicate (porn) seem unique.The laughs are few, the story is weak, and the acting (save Justin Long) is uninspired.

Having seen reviews we knew to expect it to be funny, but also that it would be crude.  It was that and more.Be aware that like many of Judd Apatow's films Zack and Miri includes 'bonus' full frontal footage (male, full frontal footage that is) to add to the humor and/or shock value.  Expect at least a couple of those type scenes and don't say you weren't forewarned before watching the film.Once past that issue, viewers should also be aware that there's one scene that isn't for those with a weak stomach.  It's quite funny, but also incredibly crude and honestly surprised me that it made it past the MPAA on the way to the R rating that the film carried when it was aired in theatres.  You'll likely find it nearly impossible not to laugh, but it's also going to be something you'll want to turn away from.  Note that I don't want to spoil the film or the scene, but you'll be able to see what's coming and can probably figure out in advance what I'm referring to so you should also be able to be prepared.The film itself is not just funny and crude (and lewd as well), it's also, as promised on the quote from Time magazine critic Richard Corliss on the cover art for the Blu-ray disc ""Sweet, Funny and Sexy.""  While writer/director Kevin Smith was obviously going for cheap humor, he opted to wrap it up nicely in a sweet tale of two down on their luck friends.  Thanks to a very funny supporting cast, everything works pretty well and makes the end result a film that should crack you up.What isn't included on the Blu-ray, unfortunately, is a commentary from the director.  Smith decided not to do a commentary track for the current release of the film.  Whether one will be done in the future likely depends on sales of the film on disc as well as whether or not Smith ever finds time to go back and record it.  Even without a commentary track the film includes a substantial load of special features including a making of featurette, a large number of deleted scenes, outtakes and other fun stuff.The video quality is very good.  Not necessarily what technophiles would label as reference quality, but still very good.  Kevin Smith's films don't necessarily live or die by their cinematography, but it also couldn't be said that he doesn't care about such things either.  Knowing that Smith's films are more about the dialoge and character interactions, you might expect the video to be apparently less important, but that really isn't the case here.Sound quality on the Blu-ray has raised some concerns for some viewers.  I've seen complaints that the audio levels are low requiring some viewers to crank the volume a bit so as not to miss the dialogue.  That's very much a your mileage may vary type thing as the results on different sound setups vary.  Just be aware you may find yourself cranking the volume a bit more for this disc than you might normally do.One final complaint that may come up - depending upon where you buy your copy of this disc you may find that you get different cover art than you see at other outlets.  Some retailers are using different cover art that somewhat censors the packaging.  Something about the use of the P word makes some retailers nervous. :-pKevin Smith fans probably long ago considered this must buy material.  Non-fans may be reading the reviews (like this one) to help make up their mind.  Again, I'd caution that you should know going in that it is crude and lewd, but as long as you aren't easily offended you might find it quite funny.  For me it's definitely worth the purchase.",5,"Very funny, but also crude and not for the easily offended",1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,3614,"['had', 'luxury', 'seeing', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'friend', 'Having', 'seen', 'reviews', 'knew', 'expect', 'be', 'funny', 'also', 'would', 'be', 'crude', 'was', 'more.Be', 'aware', 'many', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'films', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'full', 'frontal', 'footage', 'male', 'full', 'frontal', 'footage', 'add', 'humor', 'and/or', 'shock', 'value', 'Expect', 'least', 'couple', 'type', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'were', ""n't"", 'forewarned', 'watching', 'film.Once', 'issue', 'viewers', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'aware', 'one', 'scene', ""n't"", 'weak', 'stomach', 'quite', 'funny', 'also', 'incredibly', 'crude', 'honestly', 'surprised', 'made', 'MPAA', 'way', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'carried', 'when', 'was', 'aired', 'theatres', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'find', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'not', 'laugh', 'also', 'going', 'be', 'something', ""'ll"", 'want', 'turn', 'away', 'Note', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'film', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'what', 'coming', 'can', 'probably', 'figure', 'out', 'advance', 'what', ""'m"", 'referring', 'so', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'prepared.The', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'funny', 'crude', 'lewd', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'promised', 'quote', 'Time', 'magazine', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Corliss', 'cover', 'art', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'Sweet', 'Funny', 'Sexy', 'writer/director', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'obviously', 'going', 'cheap', 'humor', 'opted', 'wrap', 'up', 'nicely', 'sweet', 'tale', 'two', 'luck', 'friends', 'Thanks', 'very', 'funny', 'supporting', 'cast', 'everything', 'works', 'pretty', 'well', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'should', 'crack', ""n't"", 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'unfortunately', 'commentary', 'director', 'Smith', 'decided', 'not', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'current', 'release', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'future', 'likely', 'sales', 'film', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'Smith', 'ever', 'time', 'go', 'back', 'record', 'Even', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'substantial', 'load', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'making', 'featurette', 'large', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'other', 'fun', 'stuff.The', 'video', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'what', 'technophiles', 'would', 'label', 'reference', 'quality', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'live', 'die', 'cinematography', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', ""n't"", 'care', 'such', 'things', 'Knowing', 'Smith', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'dialoge', 'character', 'interactions', 'might', 'expect', 'video', 'be', 'apparently', 'less', 'important', 'really', ""n't"", 'case', 'here.Sound', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'raised', 'concerns', 'viewers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'complaints', 'audio', 'levels', 'are', 'low', 'requiring', 'viewers', 'crank', 'volume', 'bit', 'so', 'not', 'miss', 'dialogue', 'very', 'much', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'type', 'thing', 'results', 'different', 'sound', 'setups', 'vary', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'may', 'find', 'cranking', 'volume', 'bit', 'more', 'disc', 'might', 'normally', 'do.One', 'final', 'complaint', 'may', 'come', 'up', 'depending', 'where', 'buy', 'copy', 'disc', 'may', 'find', 'get', 'different', 'cover', 'art', 'see', 'other', 'outlets', 'retailers', 'are', 'using', 'different', 'cover', 'art', 'somewhat', 'packaging', 'Something', 'use', 'P', 'word', 'retailers', 'nervous', '-pKevin', 'Smith', 'fans', 'probably', 'long', 'ago', 'considered', 'must', 'buy', 'material', 'Non-fans', 'may', 'be', 'reading', 'reviews', 'one', 'help', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'Again', ""'d"", 'caution', 'should', 'know', 'going', 'crude', 'lewd', 'as', 'long', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'offended', 'might', 'find', 'quite', 'funny', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchase']",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

His direction has been amateurish throughout his entire career.  His writing is getting worse, and it was never that good to start with.  The most interesting thing he's done in recent years is snipe at Bruce Willis for the failure of COP OUT, plus making a fool out of himself at the last Sundance by inviting distribution investors and then yanking his film RED STATE out from under them by ""buying"" it himself...for a dollar.I'm giving ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO an unprecedented two stars because there were actually a couple of shots that almost looked like they were from a professional film.  Most of his films look like bad student films (or, worse, home movies).But the screenplay was wretchedly awful.  It's a cute idea.  And it reaches for sentiment.  But only a completely-incompetent writer would kill it with that terrible third act.  Not the very end, but everything leading to it.  Smith almost succeeds in making the audience care about this band of porn makers.  They even start to do nice things for Zack and Miri, like turning their power back on and paying some bills for them...but then Smith tosses all of them aside for some desperately-lame scenes involving Zack and Miri.  A major character just runs out for Three Months?  And everyone else just about disappears for the rest of the film as well.I can't stand Seth Rogen but I was ready to give this film a chance...but these guys are horrible.  In the extras--and there are nearly enough Deleted Scenes as there are Final Scenes with this thing--one of the deleted scenes is entitled, ""Rogen Brilliance.""  It's basically Rogen ad-libbing lame racist one-liners about an East Indian man.  Was that the brilliance?  I missed it.Everyone else does a good job, especially Elizabeth Banks.  I even enjoyed Jason Mewes.  Real porn stars Traci Lords and Katie Morgan do very well.  But, unfortunately, they're in a film starring Seth Rogen and written/directed by Kevin Smith.(Also in the extras: an interview with Rogen where he says when he hit it big, he wanted to star in a Kevin Smith film.

I enjoyed some of the early parts of the movie where there was some of that uncensored-even-by-your-brain dialogue where people say EXACTLY what they're thinking, there was some pretty funny stuff.As the movie got more into the making of the porno and the ""romantic"" plot between the two leads progressed the movie got more boring, more crass, and less funny.

1215045,A2EUWXC22L66ZN,B001LM6VV8,"T. McLaughlin ""t-mac""","[0, 1]","Zack and Miri is an instant classic, just absolutely hilarious movie with some quality ""nice"" moments.We start out with the funny stuff, seeing Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks bantering back and forth between each other and their friends and the such, and it's all very humorous until we see the problems begin with their apartment. The stuff starts hitting the fan, and these two friends, Rogen and Banks, have to begin to make ends meet in order to keep the place up. Well, Rogen comes up with the brilliant idea to make a porno movie with their buddies and some people they have audition for it. Would most people come up with this idea to make ends meet? Probably not, but for the movie's sake, roll with it and enjoy the ensuing chaos.In order to not give away much of the rest of the movie, I won't say anything further in details, but to highlight the positives of the film: the acting is very well done, even though these are primarily comedy actors, who only need to deliver lines, these ones do it incredibly well. Also, the plot develops well, even if it is a bit unrealistic, it is still effective in that Kevin Smith doesn't just gloss over minor details, he actually thought this out and wanted it to work, and boy, did it ever. Another addition on the acting, Rogen and Banks actually  have some good chemistry in this film, both as friends, and then as lovers. It is surprising, in a comedy, to see legitimate chemistry between the main characters, after all of the American Pie type movies that have come out; this just makes the movie that much more enjoyable. The lines in this movie are hilarious, and in order to see all of them, be sure to watch through the special features, most notably the Fugly Mook deleted scene.Towards the end of the movie, it does get a bit cheesy with heartfelt moments between Zack and Miri, but was still well-done. I would 100% recommend this movie to anyone that follows comedy, slap-stick or otherwise, and also enjoys a feel-good end to stories.Overall, if you enjoy movies like Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, 40-Year Old Virgin, and the such, you will like this movie; however, I think this movie is more well thought out than those, and is just more entertaining (while actually carrying a plot through from start to finish) than any of the above.",5,Great movie - Kevin Smith DOES outdo Apatow,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,2310,"['Zack', 'Miri', 'instant', 'classic', 'just', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'quality', 'nice', 'moments.We', 'start', 'funny', 'stuff', 'seeing', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'bantering', 'back', 'forth', 'other', 'friends', 'such', 'very', 'humorous', 'see', 'problems', 'begin', 'apartment', 'stuff', 'hitting', 'fan', 'two', 'friends', 'Rogen', 'Banks', 'have', 'begin', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'order', 'keep', 'place', 'up', 'Well', 'Rogen', 'up', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'make', 'porno', 'movie', 'buddies', 'people', 'have', 'audition', 'Would', 'most', 'people', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Probably', 'not', 'movie', 'sake', 'roll', 'enjoy', 'ensuing', 'chaos.In', 'order', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'much', 'rest', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'further', 'details', 'highlight', 'positives', 'film', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'are', 'primarily', 'comedy', 'actors', 'who', 'only', 'need', 'deliver', 'lines', 'ones', 'do', 'incredibly', 'well', 'Also', 'plot', 'well', 'even', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'still', 'effective', 'Kevin', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'just', 'gloss', 'over', 'minor', 'details', 'actually', 'thought', 'out', 'wanted', 'work', 'boy', 'did', 'ever', 'addition', 'acting', 'Rogen', 'Banks', 'actually', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'film', 'friends', 'then', 'lovers', 'surprising', 'comedy', 'see', 'legitimate', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'American', 'Pie', 'type', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'just', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'lines', 'movie', 'are', 'hilarious', 'order', 'see', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'most', 'notably', 'Fugly', 'Mook', 'deleted', 'scene.Towards', 'end', 'movie', 'get', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'was', 'still', 'well-done', 'would', '100', '%', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'comedy', 'slap-stick', 'otherwise', 'also', 'feel-good', 'end', 'stories.Overall', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'such', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'however', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'just', 'more', 'entertaining', 'actually', 'carrying', 'plot', 'start', 'finish', 'above']",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with parents, family members, or relatives of any kind, but it is certainly watchable with friends who are familiar with Kevin Smith's movie-making and story-telling style.Viewers who are unfamiliar with Kevin Smith might not appreciate the over-the-top dirty jokes and unflinching awkward situations.",5,Another Great Kevin Smith Movie,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,876,"['movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'film', 'honest', 'sometimes', 'vulgar', 'look', 'interesting', 'friendship', 'LikeClerks', 'Collector', 'Series', 'Mallrats', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'andChasing', 'Amy', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'in-depth', 'look', 'brief', 'moment', 'two', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'interactions', 'social', 'circle.While', 'situation', 'presented', 'movie', 'outlandish', 'far-fetched', 'fun', 'watching', 'attention', 'detail', 'costumes', 'sets', 'superb', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'parents', 'family', 'members', 'relatives', 'kind', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movie-making', 'story-telling', 'style.Viewers', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'might', 'not', 'appreciate', 'over-the-top', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'unflinching', 'awkward', 'situations']",Zack And Miri Make A Porno

The dialogue is adult and somewhat interesting, but not close to Smith's best. The porn is soft core, very scant, and not very sexy. There are some naked breasts, and some brief male nudity. Elizabeth Banks keeps her clothes on. Seth Rogen is his usual funny self. Smith is much more of a verbal director than visual, so other than the brief nudity, there's no reason to watch on Blu-ray. Overall, the movie is quite a disappointment, because it is not as funny, original, or interesting as Smith's other movies, and the ""let's make a porno"" hook is mostly tease, similar to ""The Girl Next Door"".

1215051,AWRGM17GTMND8,B001LM6VV8,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[0, 0]","Not to mention the other components of the cast that perform to the fans full standards.  Zack and Miri is a great new addition to the Smith collection, and the critics writing bad reviews must not expect much range from Kevin Smith.  He can't do Jay and Silent Bob forever!This film is a big step away from the View Askew universe, but like Kevin said himself ""You won't look at this movie and say, Who Made That?!""  The film feels really fresh and new, but it wouldn't have been this way without Seth Rogen.  Rogen was Kevin Smith's secret weapon.  For all I'm concerned the combination of this director and actor can make any crazy or ridiculous film concept amazingly funny. Like I said, it was a match made in heaven, and It mostly stands up on its own two feet because of this combo.I won't give away too much of the plot, but I believe it's pretty self-explanatory.  The concept was foolish, but Smith made me look like a fool.  It worked.  It really worked, and it had more heart than a lot of his movies, strangely enough.  The movie made history for Smith as he worked his fingers to the bone to get this movie accepted as an R rated film.  He did what most directors don't do and he kept his third editing and demanded an appeal.  If you watch this in the special features, I think you gain much respect for his achievment.Now why did I give this 4/5?  Comparing it to the old Kevin Smith films, its not the funniest one made.  I'm a Mallrats fanatic, and maybe thats where I'm biased.  It's a great film but it's not my favorite out of the Smith Flicks.Lastly, I will give you some encouragement to see the film.  Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Jason Mewes, and Justin Long make this film a riot.  Some of the other cast can't quite get to their level, but that's expected.  If wished that Seth Rogen showed up to Moobys in Clerks, then your wish has come true.  It's here in Zack and Miri.
