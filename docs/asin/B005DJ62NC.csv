1455573,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005DJ62NC,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","One obvious thing that makes God Bless Ozzy Osbourne so appealing is that the documentary footage is really clean and well-spoken (well, about as coherent as you could possibly get from Ozzy- expect plenty of swearing and derogatory comments of course).  It focuses on quite a bit of personal stuff that I wasn't familiar with and only briefly mentions some of the more popular situations of Ozzy's prolific career (such as biting the heads off bats and doves, as well as the teenager who committed suicide while listening to Ozzy's music back in the 80's).  It's probably a good thing these stories were only mentioned briefly since we've heard them a thousand times by this point.  Still understandable and very important that these events were brought up however, so I'm glad they included them.While the documentary does a really good job mentioning the Black Sabbath years from 1970-1972 and mentions all the stories on how the band struggled from a rundown Birmingham city in pretty fine detail, for whatever reason it completely skips over the years from 1973-1976 which, thanks to the internet, I now know has several rich stories that could have been shared by the band members had the documentary given them an extra 10 minutes or so to tell them.  By the way, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are pretty vocal in this documentary.  Tony Iommi not so much, though.  I actually never knew Ozzy was such a prankster/comedian during the Black Sabbath years.  I guess it may have been obvious given his stage antics, but apparently he was such a prankster because he was hiding all the real-life struggles he had to deal with at the time, and being funny was his was of coping with life.Ozzy mentions when he received over 200 dollars for Black Sabbath's first album, the first thing he did was buy a pair of shoes.  Goes to show how poor his living conditions were at the time.  I think I underestimated just how poor the members of Black Sabbath were back then.  They basically had to do anything to survive.  This documentary does an amazing job spending over 30 minutes explaining the Black Sabbath years in pretty good detail- they just shouldn't have skipped the '73-'76 years which, for most fans, is considered a quality, experimental period of Black Sabbath's career.However they do make up for it by Never Say Die since that's the key changing point of Ozzy's career, and the documentary mentions in fine detail how Ozzy was spending his days in a hotel room doing drugs and destroying his self-confidence after being fired by Black Sabbath, believing he'd never be able to accomplish anything again.  That is, until Sharon came along.  Looking back I do believe Sharon -despite what people may think of her given some of the decisions she's made *ahem* remixing classic Ozzy albums *ahem*- if not for her, where would Ozzy be today?  He probably wouldn't be here.  Hey, some men really need a woman in order to succeed in life and bring out what they're capable of, and Ozzy is living proof.I feel the documentary should have mentioned more concerning Randy Rhoads and his contributions to the band.  They play a REALLY eerie segment that I've never seen involving Randy receiving a guitar player of the year award with Ozzy and Sharon standing next to him.  You can tell all three of them are really touched that Randy's receiving that award.  Randy mentions, more or less, that he wants to make people proud of his abilities.  Given his untimely death, this is a haunting piece of footage.  Still bugs me a great deal that he died so young, and I'm sure it bugs several other heavy metal fans as well.  Never should have happened.  For some reason the documentary doesn't mention Jake E. Lee's contributions at all, and Zakk Wylde's more substantial long-lasting years are mostly overlooked as well (other than one quick segment).  How can that be?  What a shame.I think the best moment is when Sharon says that since Ozzy lost so much (his father, being removed from Black Sabbath, leaving his previous family, Randy Rhoads) Ozzy seemed to believe that everything he likes and holds close will eventually go away, so he has to live in the moment so to speak, and that may explain why Ozzy's been so outrageous and daring over the years.  All the drinking and drug taking may be a result of everything he's lost over the years.  Excellent part of the documentary.However the final 30 minutes makes this documentary worth buying.  It details what Ozzy's like today and how he's coping with finally being able to quit drugs for good (though I could have sworn I heard a rumor a couple months ago that he has returned to drugs, and even rumors of a divorce with Sharon... not sure if any of this is remotely legitimate though).  It mentions the Osbournes reality show and how it actually caught the family at a very bad time since Ozzy was spending much of his days drunk and falling over/sleeping on the couch, and his son Jack mentions how quite a bit of this footage was too inappropriate and realistic for TV viewing so they couldn't show it.  I like the segment at the end where Ozzy finally has his driver's license at the age of 60 so we see him driving away.  He mentions how it's good to leave home once in a while and get a taste of freedom so he can breathe and relax.  The way I'm going, I might not have my license until 60, lol.  I was actually wondering if, given the fact he's British, he may accidentally drive on the other side of the road.  Hey the thought crossed my mind!Also, AMAZING that Paul McCartney of all people mentions the influence that Black Sabbath had, though I disagree with him.  While Sabbath may have been outrageous and daring when they were a brand new band, he says that nowadays they seem tame in comparison to the type of heavy metal we have now.  However I think Sabbath's music actually stands out and sounds heavier *now* then it did back then, given how different they were compared to other bands at the time.  I understand Paul's logic, however.The documentary also mentions in pretty fine detail Ozzy's children from his first marriage, who I've never seen until now.  They pretty much don't have a lot of time for their father by mentioning that the memories they have is that Ozzy would return home from a Sabbath concert, do outrageous things such a crash cars into things in the middle of the night, and never really show his children the affection they wanted.  He was never really there for them, and Ozzy even mentions that basically he was too strung out on drugs/drinking or tired to give his first family the devotion they wanted.  We also see Ozzy's siblings which I've never seen until now.  They look *nothing* like Ozzy!  No resemblance whatsoever.  I figure at least his brother would resemble him... not at all.  The sisters look even less like Ozzy.  Of course Ozzy's kids with Sharon are shown, even Aimee- the very attractive older daughter that never appeared on the Osbournes reality show.I like when Ozzy returns to the rundown apartment building where he grew up as a child.  Looks like a really tiny crammy flat (apartment) building not at all suitable for several children to be living.  How he was able to grow up there without losing his mind is a mystery (though actually he shares he almost DID lose his mind on several occasions, not even remotely enjoying his factory working days during his teenage years).  I'm also surprised he went to jail for 6 weeks. I didn't know about this.  Oh and what about the current Ozzy watching his stage performances from back in the 80's and sharing he doesn't remember a single thing?  I think he also found his onstage persona too unusual to watch which made him feel uncomfortable, prompting him to jump off the couch and leave the room, haha.  Hey that may have been a rough spot for his career due to all the drugs, drinking and chaos with his wife Sharon, but the music sure was arguably a lot better than anything he's been doing recently.Lots of things I didn't actually know about Ozzy Osbourne makes this documentary pretty awesome.  I like how Sharon mentions several stories of her own, and the haunting story that I do recall watching on another documentary show in the past how Ozzy's drug addiction made him so messed up, he mentioned he was planning on killing Sharon.  Sharon apparently felt it coming since Ozzy wasn't acting like his usual self during this awful low point of his life.  He walks up to Sharon and says something like ""We've come to the conclusion, you have to die"" and Sharon's like ""We???""  The voices in Ozzy's head were part of the ""we"" apparently.  They didn't mention the part where Sharon was struggling to get to the phone in time to call for help, which is what the other documentary mentions.Overall, great well-made documentary.  I have no complaints other than the fact it completely avoids mentioning the '73-'76 years of Black Sabbath.  You'll get to experience lots of Sabbath and solo Ozzy music while Ozzy's sharing his stories as well, which is a huge benefit.  Perhaps the most unusual part is when we see the current Ozzy warming up his voice for a live performance by taking some kind of test to see how well he can hit the high notes while waiting around in his dressing room.  Strange, haha.",5,God's blessing to the man himself,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,9275,"['One', 'obvious', 'thing', 'God', 'Bless', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'appealing', 'documentary', 'footage', 'really',

Meo ""Bargain Hunter""","[0, 0]","This DVD totally sums up Ozzy's hitting bottom and overcoming, all be it with the help of his family especially his most loyal employ, friend and wife, Sharon. I appreciate this DVD above all because it truly gives something of substance back to his fans. Fans will certainly enjoy this in depth look into Ozzy's personal life along with the many photos and concert clips!A remarkable documentary that inspires faith that ""With God All things are Possible"". I've been praying for this man and his family from the days of 'Sabbath' and biting off the heads of small creatures. Though never a fan myself, I was very close to someone who seemed obsessed with Ozzy.Very sad and upsetting, but as Ozzy himself admits, he hardly remembers anything from those days even his performances due to his drug addictions! Surely God's Hand has been over this guy (even from a medical standpoint) as well as over his family and not without reason...as with all of us, God has a special purpose for each life he has created...it's up to us to 'seek and find' that purpose.Though all seems well with the family by the documentary's end, as far as Ozzy and the children being 'clean', I still pray for the day when Ozzy will announce to the public his commitment to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, rather than just referring to his Savior as ""the man upstairs"".I shall also pray for All of us to seek God's Will and obtain the Strength to Live it, for we can only ""Do All things through Christ Whom Strengthens us"".God Bless you and Ozzy!

I don't get how he could even function, let alone create such great music during his years of HEAVY substance abuse. This film discusses that, and much more.Of course, this movie has some really funny stories and jokes - with Ozzy being the madman he is. There are some really cool interviews of people who know Ozzy personally, and have some stuff to share (Tommy Lee in particular!).But this film also contains a real personal look at who Ozzy is. From the film, you can tell that he is very humble, and truly loves his fans and acknowledges that he wouldn't have anything he has now without them.Ozzy's spirituality also shows a bit in the film, which I found fascinating (perhaps where the title came from).All in all, a very entertaining film.

1455583,ASEBTBA4CZ0X6,B005DJ62NC,T.,"[23, 24]","The documentary is worth buying for the low price, although it could have been so much better. At least half of this is stuff you've all heard before a gazillion times. The saving grace for this is the fact that the footage and filming is done very well and gives you new and different glimpses of Ozzy and the quality is excellent as well, which makes alot of the recent/older stuff obsolete. Also included is interviews with Ozzy's 1st marriage children, along with Amiee, the daughter who stayed out of the ""Osbournes"" reality stuff.However, there were some glaring misses as well, such as :1. I wish the Randy Rhoads discussion would have been longer and that there would have been more talk about circumstances surrounding the fateful day in 1982 that he died.2. Not one mention of Jake E. Lee. How can someone that was your lead guitarist right in the heart of your career (1983-1987) be completely ignored. His contributions are noteworthy and they should have been gracious and included what he did for the band, etc, etc.3. Zakk Wylde. Man, the guy's been a part of the band for over 20 years and they barely show him for about one minute and again, no talk of his importance to the band. A huge miss. I understand the movie's about Ozzy, but Zakk's a big part of that band image and wrote a bunch of the music that Ozzy and his family profited big-time from.4. In fact, not much of anything about past band members such as the late Randy Castillo. A discussion about him would have been a great addition to this movie, he was instrumental to Ozzy at the time. And it goes w/out saying, it's a crime to banish Lee Kerslake and the great Bob Daisley from any of this. Differences should have been set aside. And nothing from Tommy Aldridge? Don Airey?5. Not enough discussion of the Ozzfest years and the launching opportunities of up and coming bands. From '97 to 2006, the Ozzfest was a huge part of everything rock. Basically a passing mention on here.To summarize, Ozzy the person is this film, but the band/music, while discussed, is mostly absent. The older ""Don't Blame Me"" and ""Behind the Music"" stories cover that a little better, but are quite dated at this point.Also, i expected much more in ""bonus"" features. Again, very little here.A good effort, but a big miss at the same time.

1455584,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B005DJ62NC,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[2, 2]","I was thrilled that someone from the Ozzy camp, namely Osbourne's own son Jack, was going to make a documentary on the Prince of Darkness. I thought it would be great since Jack is Ozzy's son, he's been there for a part of his life and has seen some things and he has access to any information on Ozzy really. Maybe I set my hopes up a little too much, God Bless Ozzy Osbourne is a entertaining documentary film but I feel they were merely scratching the surface here and in this case more would have been better. Fans can tell right away that this documentary is a few years old already. It shows Ozzy's 60th Birthday party which is three years ago now. The most recent live performances show Ozzy with Zakk Wylde and Wylde appears in the documentary in some spots.In one of the more revealing moments of the documentary, Ozzy's two children with his ex-wife Thelma, Jessica and Louis are interviewed. Jessica almost sounds like she's angry at her dad and doesn't say much positive things, there's a lot of negativity aimed at her dad and from her angle it's quite understandable His son Louis is clear about the fact that Ozzy was never really a dad to him and he also express frustration that his dad can't remember his birthday. Ozzy is asked in what year his daughter was born and he replies ""71, 72 I don't know. I'll find out for you"" and then you can see water in his eyes, even behind those sunglasses. He says he did the best he could with his first two children given the circumstances. I thought the way Sharon analyzed the period of Ozzy's life in which he left his wife Thelma and moved on to Sharon was fairly accurate and set things in perspective. He was fired from Black Sabbath, he already had children and wanted to start a new family with Sharon. Her angle on this and how it affected Ozzy was great. I think maybe the best interview of it all may have been Kelly Osbourne's. She obviously suffered from her dad's crazyness and it had an impact on her. Today she's really happy that her dad has been clean for so long. Jack's interview is similar to his sister and he reveals that when he stopped drugs and alcohol that's when Ozzy decided to stop.Most of the major events in Osbourne's life addressed. His upbringing in Birmingham, his first wife, his kids, Black Sabbath, going solo, the death of Randy Rhoads, strangling Sharon, reality tv dad and so on. The interviews with musicians and other people were passable but Tommy Lee and others don't say a whole lot that fans aren't already aware of. His Black Sabbath bandmates Geezer Butler and Bill Ward were both interviewed and it was nice to see them here. I love the scene where Ozzy's sitting on his couch at home watching his own music videos and he goes ""these are clich&eacute; f***ing 80's videos!"". He soon enough proceeds to leave and he is asked ""Ozzy where are you going?"" to which he replies ""Taking a walk, watching this f****** s***..."". Priceless. Seing Ozzy's preparation for a show was fascinating, I didn't know he did the things he did. I wished he would've talked about Jake E. Lee because he is pretty much never talked about, yet he was a great guitarist and made important contributions to both Bark At The Moon (1983) and The Ultimate Sin (1986).I enjoyed watching God Bless Ozzy Osbourne but here's the problem: it's not long enough to cover everything. I mean this is Ozzy, the Sabbath years alone would take their own documentary and add to that Ozzy years, his personal live, the rumors, the crazyness, the madness of it all... and you'll realize an hour and a half (1h33 minutes to be more precise) is simply too short. Some of the interviews were revealing and interesting, all in all it's a good entertaining hour and a half doc on the legend that is Ozzy but even so you will learn little more than the documentaries on Ozzy that have already been made. For a fan this is something that should be seen, but I was a little disappointed because knowing that they had all the resources to make the ultimate Ozzy documentary it could have been longer and better.3/5.",3,Falls Short of being the ultimate Ozzy documentary,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,4070,"['was', 'thrilled', 'someone', 'Ozzy', 'camp', 'namely', 'Osbourne', 'own', 'son', 'Jack', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'documentary', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Jack', 'Ozzy', 'son', 'been', 'there', 'part', 'life', 'seen', 'things', 'access', 'information', 'Ozzy', 'really', 'Maybe', 'set', 'hopes', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'God', 'Bless', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'film', 'feel', 'were', 'merely', 'scratching', 'surface', 'here', 'case', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Fans', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'away', 'documentary', 'few', 'years', 'old', 'already', 'Ozzy', '60th', 'Birthday', 'party', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'most', 'recent', 'live', 'performances', 'show', 'Ozzy', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'Wylde', 'documentary', 'spots.In', 'one', 'more', 'revealing', 'moments', 'documentary', 'Ozzy', 'two', 'children', 'ex-wife', 'Thelma', 'Jessica', 'Louis', 'are', 'interviewed', 'Jessica', 'almost', 'angry', 'dad', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'positive', 'things', 'lot', 'negativity', 'aimed', 'dad', 'angle', 'quite', 'understandable', 'son', 'Louis', 'clear', 'fact', 'Ozzy', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'dad', 'also', 'express', 'frustration', 'dad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'birthday', 'Ozzy', 'asked', 'what', 'year', 'daughter', 'was', 'born', '71', '72', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'water', 'eyes', 'even', 'sunglasses', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'first', 'two', 'children', 'given', 'circumstances', 'thought', 'way', 'Sharon', 'analyzed', 'period', 'Ozzy', 'life', 'left', 'wife', 'Thelma', 'moved', 'Sharon', 'was', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'set', 'things', 'perspective', 'was', 'fired', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'already', 'had', 'children', 'wanted', 'start', 'new', 'family', 'Sharon', 'angle', 'how', 'affected', 'Ozzy', 'was', 'great', 'think', 'maybe', 'best', 'interview', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Kelly', 'Osbourne', 'obviously', 'suffered', 'dad', 'crazyness', 'had', 'impact', 'Today', 'really', 'happy', 'dad', 'been', 'clean', 'so', 'long', 'Jack', 'interview', 'similar', 'sister', 'when', 'stopped', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'when', 'Ozzy', 'decided', 'stop.Most', 'major', 'events', 'Osbourne', 'life', 'addressed', 'upbringing', 'Birmingham', 'first', 'wife', 'kids', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'going', 'solo', 'death', 'Randy', 'Rhoads', 'strangling', 'Sharon', 'reality', 'tv', 'dad', 'so', 'interviews', 'musicians', 'other', 'people', 'were', 'passable', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'whole', 'lot', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'aware', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Geezer', 'Butler', 'Bill', 'Ward', 'were', 'interviewed', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'here', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'Ozzy', 'sitting', 'couch', 'home', 'watching', 'own', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'f***ing', '80', 'videos', 'soon', 'enough', 'proceeds', 'leave', 'asked', 'Ozzy', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'Taking', 'walk', 'watching', 'f******', 's***', 'Priceless', 'Seing', 'Ozzy', 'preparation', 'show', 'was', 'fascinating', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'things', 'did', 'wished', 'would', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'Jake', 'E.', 'Lee', 'pretty', 'much', 'never', 'talked', 'yet', 'was', 'great', 'guitarist', 'made', 'important', 'contributions', 'Bark', 'Moon', '1983', 'Ultimate', 'Sin', '1986', '.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'God', 'Bless', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'here', 'problem', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'cover', 'everything', 'mean', 'Ozzy', 'Sabbath', 'years', 'alone', 'would', 'take', 'own', 'documentary', 'add', 'Ozzy', 'years', 'personal', 'live', 'rumors', 'crazyness', 'madness', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'hour', 'half', '1h33', 'minutes', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'simply', 'too', 'short', 'interviews', 'were', 'revealing', 'interesting', 'good', 'entertaining', 'hour', 'half', 'doc', 'legend', 'Ozzy', 'even', 'will', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'documentaries', 'Ozzy', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'made', 'fan', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'knowing', 'had', 'resources', 'make', 'ultimate', 'Ozzy', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'better.3/5']",N/A
