I saw the kid for the first time and started reaching for the remote....BOY!  Am I glad I didn't!!!!!Once into the movie by just a few minutes, I was hooked, as were all the folks watching it with me.  There were 4 adult males and wives in our group besides me and my wife.  ALL the us men were trying so hard NOT to sob, wipe tears from our eyes or make fools of ourselves in-front of everyone....You know from the start where this kid comes from but you continue to be amazed on a minute by minute basis.  There is some sort of action happening almost constantly.This is not a detractor, but it draws you into the kid's mission more and more.  The people who produced this flick knew what they were doing!  The kid actor just couldn't hardly do any better and the two main adult guys acting as a doctor and a cop; Schieder and Cain respectively, were perfect.The kid actor just had the authority that was needed for his part.  Well done kid!I wish to add loudly here that this movie is NOT a preachy, soft, pushy, manipulative, gushy, or mabie-pambie type Christian flick!Ok, so some of the actors weren't absolutely pro, but they did just fine and did not detract from the quality.Not to ruin the ending, but something happened near the end that for a very few moments seemed a bit corny....but.. within seconds you realize the action was needed to complete the movie.WOW!!! This was one of the best movies I've seen;  ""Love Dare"" was great, ""Courageous"" was super-duper, ""October Baby"" was greatly super-duper...but this one was right up there!I know I have used too many exclamation points.... but... see this flick for youself.

It's not my normal go-to genre to watch drama as I'm more of an action and adventure with big special effects type of movie watcher. However this one is worthy. When it comes to Christian films there seems to be a big line with some being overly cheesy and some being really quite good. This one was really pretty good in an unbelievable way. What I mean is that here we have Gabriel, as in the angel Gabriel that comes to a town on the edge of failure and hopelessness with a message and a gift from God. It is not something you see every day and this was not a big budget film, but it was well done. The scenes were real and in small town life rather easy to see and imagine, no matter how unbelievable our minds think miracles may be.I knew going in that I would probably be a fan as I have enjoyed many things from Mike Norris over the year, even if they do usually have action, this was more a drama - well definitely a drama. That and being the Superman fan that I am I have always liked Dean Cain and Jonathan Schneider. There were many unknown-to-me names in this film, but overall I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind looking at Echo Light again for more films. All of the previews were enticing as well.
