Yes, it's missing some bits from the play, but that's ok for now. It's still a great improvement over the original classic film release.It is incredible the amount of painstaking research that went into the creation of a musical. Not only is it fun to watch, but the history follows the true story of the struggle for independance closer than any movie I have ever seen! I read someone who whined that it belittles the Declaration of Independance since the only reason it was written was so Jefferson could &quot;have marital relations&quot; with his wife. They weren't watching the same film I was. He didn't want to because he was basiclly a newlywed when he got called to congress and was scheduled to go home to finally have his honeymoon! Adams DID send for Jefferson's wife as thanks to the sacrifice he made because Jefferson knew the importance of what had to be done, and as Adams put it &quot;No one can write better than you, Jefferson&quot;. The arguments on slavery were accurate, if not tamed a bit to avoid criticism for &quot;trying to make a statement&quot; where the truth actually echoed reality.Read the book, see the play, get the soundtrack, love the movie!Will I be happier if they someday release a &quot;complete edition&quot; like the laserdisc years ago?

Gregory ""Andrew Gregory""","[8, 15]","While 1776 was a masterpiece on stage, it was less than a masterpiece on film, thanks to the presidentially mandated cut of a song that criticized political conservatives--not to mention Jack Warner's foolish meddling in order to placate theatre owners who complained that the film's 180-minute running time would cut one show per day.  Consequently, over a half-hour was removed by Mr. Warner, resulting in a good but not outstanding translation of a Broadway masterpiece.A few years ago, a laserdisc release presented the film in its full length at last.  True, the reconstruction included work print segments, complete with scratches and even a brief black-and-white cut, but it was wonderful.  Now Columbia/Sony heralds this &quot;restored&quot; version, which it is, but all the hype carefully suggests a full-length version, which it isn't.This version, at 166 minutes, still misses 14 minutes, including two reprises and some witty and revealing dialogue.  This version even has a different opening title sequence and misses the overture, intermission, and entr'acte.

Featherston,"[22, 23]","Wow!I just finished watching the DVD and all I can say is that if you haven't seen the restored version, you haven't seen the film.I've always loved this musical, but this DVD has three great advantages over the VHS and TV versions we've been watching for the last 30 years.First, it's presented in widescreen, rather than pan and scan -- which is a huge advantage considering the visual composition of the film.Second, the sound on this DVD is remastered Dolby stereo (for some reason Columbia originally released it in mono). You can imagine that it makes a bit of difference to a musical to actually be in stereo.Third-- and most importantly -- it contains approximately 25 minutes of restored footage (seamlessly restored by the original director, by the way). Some of the additions are minor, but I especially like the restoration of Adams' exchange with Abby listing her faults (which adds resonance to the final exchange when Abby responds to John's list of its own faults) and, of course, the restoration of the &quot;Cool Considerate Men&quot; number -- a very important political statement which was removed by Jack Warner for political reasons (another example of why Richard Nixon was such a creep).I enjoyed the commentary by director Peter Hunt and writer Peter Stone, but this would be a knockout even without it. It may not be the greatest music ever written for the American stage, but it's a great bit of historic recreation. While Stone and composer Sherman Edwards twiddle a few historical facts (as a North Carolinian, I've always been dismayed by my state's treatment ... North Carolina was, in fact, the first state to instruct its delegates to support independence and not a toady for South Carolina), they do manage to recreate the drama that even serious historians agree created the &quot;Miracle in Philadelphia.&quot;",5,Magnificent Restoration!,1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,1846,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'restored', 'version', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'musical', 'DVD', 'three', 'great', 'advantages', 'VHS', 'TV', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'last', '30', 'years.First', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'rather', 'pan', 'scan', 'huge', 'advantage', 'considering', 'visual', 'composition', 'film.Second', 'sound', 'DVD', 'remastered', 'Dolby', 'stereo', 'reason', 'Columbia', 'originally', 'released', 'mono', 'can', 'imagine', 'bit', 'difference', 'musical', 'actually', 'be', 'stereo.Third', 'most', 'importantly', 'approximately', '25', 'minutes', 'restored', 'footage', 'seamlessly', 'restored', 'original', 'director', 'way', 'additions', 'are', 'minor', 'especially', 'restoration', 'Adams', 'exchange', 'Abby', 'listing', 'faults', 'resonance', 'final', 'exchange', 'when', 'Abby', 'John', 'list', 'own', 'faults', 'course', 'restoration', 'quot', 'Cool', 'Considerate', 'Men', 'quot', 'number', 'very', 'important', 'political', 'statement', 'was', 'removed', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'political', 'reasons', 'example', 'why', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'was', 'such', 'creep', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'director', 'Peter', 'Hunt', 'writer', 'Peter', 'Stone', 'would', 'be', 'knockout', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'music', 'ever', 'written', 'American', 'stage', 'great', 'bit', 'historic', 'recreation', 'Stone', 'composer', 'Sherman', 'Edwards', 'few', 'historical', 'facts', 'North', 'Carolinian', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'dismayed', 'state', 'treatment', 'North', 'Carolina', 'was', 'fact', 'first', 'state', 'instruct', 'delegates', 'support', 'independence', 'not', 'toady', 'South', 'Carolina', 'do', 'manage', 'recreate', 'drama', 'even', 'serious', 'historians', 'agree', 'created', 'quot', 'Miracle', 'Philadelphia.', 'quot']",N/A

Sadly, it isn't always well advised and even the most intriguing of historical matters can appear lifeless and dull on the big screen.  The idea of doing a musical about the writing of the Declaration of Independence seems off from the very start, but also a tad intriguing.  It was already a successful Broadway musical, so why not?  I do understand that my personal opinion here may not be the most popular, but this review calls for my opinion and so that is what I'm going to give.This film doesn't work.It's almost as easy and that and yet I guess I should elaborate (since a good review should always do that, right Beany?).  My issue with `1776' lays solely in the films collection of redundant sequences.  It basically replays out the same scene over and over.  It splices those scenes with a mixed bag of musical numbers, some fun and whimsy (the song sung when trying to decide who should write the declaration itself is rather fun) and others dreadfully dull and even cringe-worthy (I really wanted Mr. Feeny to stop singing to his wife).  The performances for the most part are all fine, with Howard Da Silva being rather exceptional as Benjamin Franklin.  He just seems to be having WAY TOO MUCH FUN here and I liked that about him.  Still, the pacing was uncomfortable and the first hour itself stays in the same place and made my eyes hurt from staring at an unmoving story for so long.I wanted to be compelled to enjoy this, but I found myself wishing it would exhaust its running length already and just end.

There were 1217 Broadway performances between 3/16/69 and 2/13/72. Twelve opening night cast members reprise their roles in the motion picture as does one replacement actor. (Hey, that makes 13!) The show's pace is understandably slow as this is in large part a story of impasse and the negotiations necessary to resolve it.Before its Radio City Music Hall premiere in 1972, Jack Warner gave Pres. Nixon a private screening of the film. Nixon thought the song ""Cool, Considerate Men"" to be offensive and it was removed at his request. In fact, over a half-hour of cuts were made, bringing running time down to 142 minutes. This DVD edition restores 24 minutes, leaving 1776 about 10 shy of its original three-hour length.As on stage, this version of the Tony-winning musical concerns representatives of thirteen colonies and their struggle to reach consensus on uniting against an oppressive British government and monarch. The biggest obstacle to overcome is that a decision for independence from Britain be unanimous once specific details of a carefully crafted Declaration are parsed, debated and agreed upon or deleted.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(7.2) 1776 (1972) - William Daniels/Howard Da Silva/Ken Howard/Blythe Danner/David Ford/Virginia Vestoff/Ray Middleton",4,"John Adams: ""...one useless man is called a disgrace; ...two are called a law firm, and ...three or more become a Congress!""",1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,1404,"['Peter', 'Stone', 'wrote', 'book', 'musical', 'dramedy', '1776', 'Sherman', 'Edwards', 'provided', 'music', 'were', '1217', 'Broadway', 'performances', '3/16/69', '2/13/72', 'Twelve', 'opening', 'night', 'cast', 'members', 'reprise', 'roles', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'replacement', 'actor', 'Hey', '13', 'show', 'pace', 'understandably', 'slow', 'large', 'part', 'story', 'impasse', 'negotiations', 'necessary', 'resolve', 'it.Before', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'premiere', '1972', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'gave', 'Pres', 'Nixon', 'private', 'screening', 'film', 'Nixon', 'thought', 'song', 'Cool', 'Considerate', 'Men', 'be', 'offensive', 'was', 'removed', 'request', 'fact', 'half-hour', 'cuts', 'were', 'made', 'bringing', 'running', 'time', '142', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'edition', '24', 'minutes', 'leaving', '1776', '10', 'shy', 'original', 'three-hour', 'length.As', 'stage', 'version', 'Tony-winning', 'musical', 'concerns', 'representatives', 'thirteen', 'colonies', 'struggle', 'reach', 'consensus', 'uniting', 'oppressive', 'British', 'government', 'monarch', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'overcome', 'decision', 'independence', 'Britain', 'be', 'unanimous', 'once', 'specific', 'details', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'Declaration', 'are', 'parsed', 'debated', 'agreed', 'deleted.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '7.2', '1776', '1972', 'William', 'Daniels/Howard', 'Da', 'Silva/Ken', 'Howard/Blythe', 'Danner/David', 'Ford/Virginia', 'Vestoff/Ray', 'Middleton']",N/A

How it came about, and the men that were involved.Also there is an excellent commentary featuring Peter Hunt and Peter Stone. Most commentaries are boring and stuffy, but I thoroughly enjoyed this.Not only do you get to learn more information about important figures such as John Adams, Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and etc... You also get an inside scoop about the actors, costume designers, and so forth.You also learn interesting things such as before the movie was realized, John Adams ( William Daniel's) was virtually forgotten. Even with the two new books that were out at the time, it's this movie/musical that really got him the historical background that he so rightly deserves.John Dickinson ( Adam's rival.)

In fact, much of the book is the actors speaking/singing their dialog, making the whole exercise feel more like a grand opera than a musical. I suspect that when this show was transferred from stage to screen, director Peter Hunt and producer Jack L. Warner probably dreaded the box-office returns coming from a modern and cynical audience. Having said that, the film (which I've now seen in the widescreen DVD) is rapturous, extremely witty in dialog, rich in script, costumes, art direction, and especially performances; no words can properly describe William Daniels' stand-out performance as the stubborn, argumentative, passionate, and brilliant John Adams. He is matched by Howard Da Silva's essay of Benjamin 'Franklyyyyyn!!"" and Virginia Vestoff's spoken (and sung) performance of the patient but feisty Abigail Adams. The scenes with the married Adamses are the best in the film, especially lovely because they are all done in correspondence. There is an especially bewitching moment when they are missing each other more than usual (""Yours, Yours, Yours""), and John compares the virtues of 'New England girls' to those of Virginia, and the reference is not lost on his wife. The songs? My goodness! ""Sit Down, John;"" ""The Lees of Virginia;"" ""But Mr. Adams;"" ""He Plays the Violin (a showcase for the effervescent Blythe Danner Paltrow);"" and the powerful Act 2 soliloquy on slavery, ""Molasses To Rum,"" wonderfully sung by John Cullum.

11928,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,0767813871,Classic film buff,"[4, 4]","Along with viewing the Boston Pops fireworks on television, watching this film has become an annual Independence Day tradition in our household.  Basically the plot concerns the Second Continental Congress session in June- July 1776 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the events leading up to composition and signing of the Declaration of Independence.  This is an adaption of a successful Broadway musical that originally opened in 1969, and ran over two years.  Although, it is based largely on fact there is some fictionalization, and some historical inaccuracies, though most of them are minor.  What the musical does accomplish is to pay tribute to an extraordinary group of patriots that literally put their lives on the line for the cause of American independence chief among them John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.  Hopefully too this engrossing yet entertaining movie will pique the interest to it's viewers to delve more deeply into this fascinating, critical period in our history.What was unusual in this transition from stage to screen was that a good portion of the creative team was retained from Broadway, director Peter Hunt, Peter Stone who wrote both the libretto and the screenplay, and choreographer Onna White.  Besides this many members of the original Broadway cast were retained beginning with the leading roles, William Daniels as John Adams, Howard Da Silva as Benjamin Franklin, Ken Howard as Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Vestoff as Abigail Adams, Ron Holgate as Richard Henry Lee, David Ford as John Hancock and William Duell as Andrew McNair.  They all give splendid performances but the standouts are William Daniels and Howard Da Silva. Other memorable performances are given by Donald Madden, John Cullum, Ray Middleton, William Hansen and Ray Poole.  What I particularly liked about Peter Stone's screenplay is that he restored the humanity to these legendary historical figures, so Adams though brilliant is stubborn and self-righteous, Franklin an unapologetic ""dirty old man"" and Jefferson mooning about consumed with lust for his too long unseen lovely young wife.The music and lyrics by Sherman Edwards while not up to the standards of such Broadway giants as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hammerstein and Stephen Sondheim works well and doesn't hamper the flow of the narrative. There are several memorable numbers.  The first early on is ""The Lees of Old Virginia"", a rollicking, robust march that was a Broadway showstopper by Ron Holgate as Richard Henry Lee, whose Tony Award winning rendition is preserved for posterity.  John Adams gets a chance to show his softer, more vulnerable side in the yearning, wistful duet with his wife Abigail in ""Till Then"".  ""He Plays the Violin"" is a charming, double-entendre waltz for Martha Jefferson, enchantingly portrayed by Blythe Danner, Adams and Franklin, where she tells them the secret of Jefferson's romantic appeal.  There is a jaunty little ditty called ""The Egg"" for Adams, Jefferson and Franklin that ends jubilantly as they congratulate themselves on the completion of the Declaration of Independence.Almost all of the above are light, witty and engaging, the last two noteworthy songs are 180-degree spin away.  ""Mama, Look Sharp"" is a haunting dirge like lament by a wet behind the ears soldier in his late teens about his two best friends being killed at the Battles of Lexington and Concord.  When the show opened our country was embroiled in the Vietnam War and it was a pointed commentary on the useless waste of young life in a war.  These many years later, with Iraq and Afghanistan it sadly is just as relevant.The most unsettling number in the show, even before the above, is ""Molasses to Rum.""  This is the delegate from South Carolina, Edward Rutledge stingingly played by John Cullum response to the Northern states when they accuse the Southern states of turning a blind eye to slavery so they can make a profit from their cotton and tobacco plantations.  In the course of the number, Cullum in a bravura performance turns the argument back on the North with their seafaring trade sending the slaves ships to Africa in exchange for other goods, that they are just as guilt stained as the Southern slave owners.  Rutledge with his fiery red hair and white garments fused with his zeal and implacable scorn is half avenging angel and half Lucifer just prior to his fall from grace.  He refuses to let the complacent Northern delegation off the hook; he takes them on an imaginary journey of a New England slave ship to Africa, with the slaves being crammed into the ship's hold, then a slave auction.  There is a nightmarish quality, as Rutledge demonically plunges forward building in intensity and rage, the lighting shifts becoming somber hued in dark shades, then heats to a searing orange glow as he hurls them into hell.  As Rutledge and the dissonant music reach a crescendo, the men can't bear this terrible mirror into their souls any longer and one Northern delegate pleads ""For the love of God Mr. Rutledge please!""  The dreadful spell is broken, but the guilt and shame remains, Rutledge finishes in triumph and exits the Congress followed by the entire Southern delegation.  Powerful and disquieting, it chills and disturbs the viewer as much as the Congress and is not easily dismissed.Abigail Adams once said, ""Remember the Ladies"" in a letter to her husband, and I want to acknowledge the only two ladies in the cast Virginia Vestoff as Abigail Adams and Blythe Danner as Martha Jefferson.  Abigail could be called an early feminist definitely John's partner and equal, and in Ms. Vestoff's bright, spirited portrayal this is well developed, plus she has a lovely singing voice.  Ms. Danner has always been one of my favorite actresses, and in her short screen time she definitely makes a delightful impression.The sets are unqualifiedly marvelous; art director George Jenkins built a full-scale replica of Independence Hall and its surroundings on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia.  When my family was on vacation in Philadelphia several years ago, I was astonished when visiting Independence Hall how true the movie was to the real thing, down to the desks and colors of the walls.This version is the restored director's cut, among other things one whole number ""Cool, Considerate Men"" has been added, and can be considered definitive, as per the director and screenwriter anyway, since I have read there was additional footage on the laserdisc.  The print is sharp, the colors vivid, the sound clear as a bell.  The extras are a very good commentary by both the director and the screenwriter, and also screen tests of some of the actors, plus of course the trailer.As a marriage of history and musical theater ""1776"" works extremely well.  On this journey to American Independence the viewer will laugh at the moments of wit and bawdy humor, and be deeply moved by such scenes as George Washington's final letter that is received just before the Declaration is about to be signed.  And at it's conclusion as each delegate walks up to sign the document accompanied by the toll of the bell, you will feel like cheering these flawed, oh so human, brave band of magnificent men.",5,"""

I purchased a VHS copy in 1990; and was thrilled, as it was exactly as I remembered. When it was released on DVD, I purchased the ""Restored Director's Cut""; and in my opinion, in this case, ""Less Is More"". I was disappointed in the additions; the restored portions did not enhance the quality. I have seen other movies in ""Director's Cut Format"" and normally there is a reason those portions ended up on the cutting room floor. I tried once more to watch it straight through from start to finish; only to get so far before ejecting the disc, and putting it away in a box for the local rummage sale (usually where Blythe Danner cannot remember being introduced to Franklin and Adams). I then ordered another copy on VHS; granted it will not have all the ""Bells and Wistles"", and the quality may not be that of a DVD; but I don't think I'm alone when I say that I watch a film for it's content of course; but also to be transported back to times past when it was watched and thoroughly enjoyed. Much the way each Christmas season we watch the same movies; and listen to the same music year after year, for the joy both bring to our lives.

If you pitched this to a studio exec today --telling him it is a musical based on the Continental Congress' debate over independence in the summer of 1776, that some of the songs are duets in which John Adams in Philadelphia sings, by mental telepathy, with Abigail Adams in Massachussetts, the movie is two hours and 45 minutes long, it isn't for kids since it has alot of adult humor and a fair amount of profanity-- he'd probably have a good laugh and ask you what you really came to pitch.  Of course, it helps to know that this was a successful broadway musical before it was made into a movie, and hollywood was still making musicals in the later 1960s and the very early 1970s.Despite the extreme oddness of this movie, I really enjoyed it.  William Daniels (who is best known as Dustin Hoffman's father in the Graduate and for his role as a physician on the TV series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;) stars as John Adams.  Adams is very outspoken in his effort to get the Continental Congress to declare independence.  His ally in this fight is Benjamin Franklin, played superbly by Howard da Silva.  Later they recruit Thomas Jefferson (played by Ken Howard, most famous for the TV series &quot;White Shadow&quot;) to the cause of independence.  When Jefferson has writer's block while trying to write the declaration, Adams arranges for Martha Jefferson to be brought up from Virginia to inspire him.  After that, Abigail Adams asks John (by mental telepathy, of course) why John didn't bring her down for a visit.Not all of this is historically accurate.  To give an example, the size of the congressional delegations has been cut down for drama's sake; the delegation from Pennsylvania was seven, not three, and John Dickinson was not the only influential voice from Pennsylvania opposed to independence.  But the basic gist of the story is historically accurate.  The part where Thomas McKean rides down to pick up a very ill Ceasar Rodney and bring him back to congress so that the two of them can outvote fellow delegate George Read and carry Delaware for declaring independence, is a true story.  I have to admit that this movie taught me more about the fight for the declaration of independence than I ever knew before.Despite the fact that some of the songs are dated in style and a bit tedious, this was a very entertaining two hours and forty-five minutes.

(At least in the mind of this reviewer.)This charming musical, full of wonderful music, dancing, and humor, tells the story (albeit abbreviated) of the weeks leading up to the writing and ratification of the Declaration of Independance.  The plot is centered around the machinations of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson.The musical does show the conflicts, both in personality and in ideology, between the members of the Continental Congress, and also demonstrates the issues -- and the compromises -- which led to certain decisions and choices.The roles of Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin are superbly cast (and the personality and humor of Franklin is one of the best parts of the story.)Parents should be cautioned, however, as there is some fairly liberal use of mild profanity -- and numerous not-so-subtle sexual innuendos.All in all, though, this musical is a treat.",4,A fascinating musical. . .,1032220800,"09 17, 2002",2002,960,"['.far', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'come', 'out', 'last', '30', 'years', 'least', 'mind', 'reviewer', 'charming', 'musical', 'full', 'wonderful', 'music', 'dancing', 'humor', 'story', 'abbreviated', 'weeks', 'leading', 'up', 'writing', 'ratification', 'Declaration', 'Independance', 'plot', 'centered', 'machinations', 'John', 'Adams', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson.The', 'musical', 'show', 'conflicts', 'personality', 'ideology', 'members', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'also', 'issues', 'compromises', 'led', 'certain', 'decisions', 'choices.The', 'roles', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'Franklin', 'are', 'superbly', 'cast', 'personality', 'humor', 'Franklin', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'story', 'Parents', 'should', 'be', 'cautioned', 'however', 'fairly', 'liberal', 'use', 'mild', 'profanity', 'numerous', 'not-so-subtle', 'sexual', 'innuendos.All', 'though', 'musical', 'treat']",N/A

I don't agree with this, which is of course why I later bought the DVD version. But because &quot;1776&quot; defied convention, both on stage and on film, it can sometimes invite that kind of observation.After &quot;The Lees of Old Virginia,&quot; the film is devoid of music for more than 30 minutes. During that stretch, the film's credentials as a drama step to the fore, presenting, in a fascinating way, the Congressional struggle that threatens to derail the American colonies' efforts to break free of British control. People who don't like musicals, who have gotten hooked on the drama by this point, aren't really prepared when the next song, &quot;But, Mr. Adams,&quot; makes its appearance. And so they groan. But for those who appreciate musicals, &quot;1776's&quot; dual virtues seem just right.On the commentary track for this DVD, director Peter Hunt and screenwriter Peter Stone, who also developed the stage musical, point out that some people wondered if the original play needed music. But as Stone says, &quot;The music lets you know at what kind of level the drama is.&quot; In other words, to the creators, the inherent drama of these events and the colorful nature of the characters demanded that they do more than just speak words -- this was stuff of almost operatic proportions. They had to sing.Because it is a good drama, &quot;1776&quot; gives us three-dimensional characters, and doesn't try to whitewash them. For instance, it doesn't ignore the southern states' refusal to ratify the Declaration of Independence unless an anti-slavery clause was taken out; it even underlines the issue with the magnificent &quot;Molasses to Rum to Slaves,&quot; sung by South Carolina's John Rutledge. The callous attitude of the wealthy, conservative anti-Revolution faction is illustrated with great wit and cleverness in &quot;Cool, Cool, Considerate Men.&quot; The song was cut from the film's original theatrical release on the objections of then-President Richard Nixon, and seeing it here was a revelation for me. It's become one of my favorite moments in the score.The DVD version of &quot;1776&quot; is director Peter Hunt's &quot;restored director's cut.&quot; After the earlier laserdisc version had lifted the film's running time to 176 minutes, including an Overture and an Intermission, Hunt opted to remove those theatrical flourishes, as well as some underscoring that he didn't find appropriate. Having gone straight from a VCR to a DVD player, I missed the laserdisc era, so I wish the Overture and Intermission had been included here. Still, I very much enjoyed this disc.Other favorite songs of mine include &quot;Piddle, Twiddle and Resolve,&quot; &quot;Mama, Look Sharp&quot; (an ideal riposte to the uncaring attitude of &quot;Cool, Cool, Considerate Men&quot;), and &quot;Is Anybody There?&quot;",5,"More than a great drama, more than a great musical",1081382400,"04 8, 2004",2004,3010,"['friend', 'mine', 'whom', 'had', 'lent', 'VHS', 'version', 'quot', '1776', 'quot', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'times', 'got', 'interrupted', 'singing', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'course', 'why', 'later', 'bought', 'DVD', 'version', 'quot', '1776', 'quot', 'defied', 'convention', 'stage', 'film', 'can', 'sometimes', 'invite', 'kind', 'observation.After', 'quot', 'Lees', 'Old', 'Virginia', 'quot', 'film', 'devoid', 'music', 'more', '30', 'minutes', 'stretch', 'film', 'credentials', 'drama', 'step', 'fore', 'presenting', 'fascinating', 'way', 'Congressional', 'struggle', 'derail', 'American', 'colonies', 'efforts', 'break', 'free', 'British', 'control', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'musicals', 'who', 'have', 'gotten', 'hooked', 'drama', 'point', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'prepared', 'when', 'next', 'song', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'quot', 'appearance', 'so', 'groan', 'who', 'appreciate', 'musicals', 'quot', '1776', 'quot', 'dual', 'virtues', 'seem', 'just', 'right.On', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'director', 'Peter', 'Hunt', 'screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Stone', 'who', 'also', 'developed', 'stage', 'musical', 'point', 'out', 'people', 'wondered', 'original', 'play', 'needed', 'music', 'Stone', 'quot', 'music', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'level', 'drama', 'is.', 'quot', 'other', 'words', 'creators', 'inherent', 'drama', 'events', 'colorful', 'nature', 'characters', 'demanded', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'speak', 'words', 'was', 'stuff', 'almost', 'operatic', 'proportions', 'had', 'sing.Because', 'good', 'drama', 'quot', '1776', 'quot', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', ""n't"", 'try', 'whitewash', 'instance', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'southern', 'states', 'refusal', 'ratify', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'anti-slavery', 'clause', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'even', 'issue', 'magnificent', 'quot', 'Molasses', 'Rum', 'Slaves', 'quot', 'sung', 'South', 'Carolina', 'John', 'Rutledge', 'callous', 'attitude', 'wealthy', 'conservative', 'anti-Revolution', 'faction', 'illustrated', 'great', 'wit', 'cleverness', 'quot', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Considerate', 'Men.', 'quot', 'song', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'objections', 'then-President', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'seeing', 'here', 'was', 'revelation', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'score.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'quot', '1776', 'quot', 'director', 'Peter', 'Hunt', 'quot', 'restored', 'director', 'cut.', 'quot', 'earlier', 'laserdisc', 'version', 'had', 'lifted', 'film', 'running', 'time', '176', 'minutes', 'including', 'Overture', 'Intermission', 'Hunt', 'opted', 'remove', 'theatrical', 'flourishes', 'as', 'well', 'underscoring', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'appropriate', 'Having', 'gone', 'straight', 'VCR', 'DVD', 'player', 'missed', 'laserdisc', 'era', 'wish', 'Overture', 'Intermission', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'here', 'Still', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'disc.Other', 'favorite', 'songs', 'mine', 'include', 'quot', 'Piddle', 'Twiddle', 'Resolve', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mama', 'Look', 'Sharp', 'quot', 'ideal', 'riposte', 'uncaring', 'attitude', 'quot', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Considerate', 'Men', 'quot', 'quot', 'Anybody', 'quot']",N/A

But I definitely saw it during a college history course at an age when I could fully appreciate its occassionally bawdy humor.As John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson, William Daniels, Howard Da Silva, and Ken Howard lead a lively cast through a movie with the distinctly sharp look of many early 70s musicals, which all the while shows the very human side of those involved in the struggle for independance from Britain.It begins with Daniels' crude and cantankerous Adams haranguing with other members of the Continental Congress. The distinct personalities of the Founding Fathers are given great emphasis, as are the volatile conflicts that could have prevented the Declaration of Independance from being adopted.Franklin's character as a dignified womanizer is noted, and Jefferson's struggle to write the Declaration and lonliness for his wife leads to one of the brightest and most joyous moments in the production when Philadelphia native Blythe Danner's Martha Jefferson(to whom Heaven would call within six year's time) arrives from Virginia to join her husband, and leads his colleagues, Adams and Franklin in a joyous dance in a garden the next day.Adams' own relationship with his wife, Abigail, one of the great romances in American history, is also explored. The late Virginia Vestoff is a strong and supportive wife as she consoles her spouse from a distance, belting out a tuneful and triumphant melody or two along the way.Ron Holgate's operatic training was well-used in his role as Virginia delegate Richard Henry Lee. Jonathan Moore, who later starred in another 18th Century epic, ""Amadeus"", returns to join the besieged but determined Adams at a low but critical point in the struggle; Howard Cline's New York delegate, Lewis Morris reveals a truth about New York manners that hasn't changed in 200 years.

Some interesting political commentary, if you will, by others who would have remained loyal to King George, but most are portrayed as vigorously engaged in overthrowing colonial rule in favor of independence. Probably the two most interesting portions of the film involve personal relationships. The first is John Adams' loving relationship with his wife (as revealed in the letters they send to each other). And the second is the relationship that grows between Jefferson, Adams and Franklin. There are serious moments, for example the discussion over slavery, and funny moments with Franklin's observations of his colleagues in congress.

In fact, I would say that this is the most worthwhile musical I've ever seen in my life.The film details the trying times of the Continental Congress in the days leading up to July 4, 1776.  The story brought home what the &quot;essence&quot; of those days must have been like.  Should the colonists have an all-out open rebellion against mother England and declare independence?  Or were the idealogical differences between the colonists and the British capable of being satisfied via the diplomatic apparatus of compromise?These were among the most pivotal questions disputed by our founding fathers during those summer days of 1776.  In truth, I never gave this topic much thought before watching this DVD.  It has given me a newfound admiration and appreciation for just how difficult and tumultuous their position was.The casting of the film is nothing less than outstanding.  In particular, William Daniels as John Adams, Howard De Silva as Benjamin Franklin and Ken Howard as Thomas Jefferson all stand out.  As a tall redhead, Howard in particular actually looks like the Virginian.What makes this musical truly remarkable is just how dynamic it is.  Many scenes are utterly hilarious and many of the songs are quite funny.  At the same time, the film is able to transition into rather dark topics without losing its cohesion.  Some of these dark matters include the issue of slavery, the punishment our founding fathers potentially faced for treason, and the horrifying consequences that await a people once the gates of war have been pried open.In my mind, this is a worthwhile film for all Americans to see.  It offers a profound sense of where we came from and the idealogical foundations that this country was built on.

Every American knows that it is the year of our Declaration of Independence, even if one in five Americans doesn't know whom we declared our independence from.In that year, the Continental Congress is a contentious group of gentry, artisans, doctors, lawyers, inventors, farmers, slave owners, and a minister. Representatives struggle with their loyalty to their states, their region, the idea of independency or loyalty to the crown, or if they are supposed to represent the people or represent their conscience in the name of the people they represent.Adapted from the play of the same title, an all-star cast has performed this story on Broadway and in film. William Daniels is the angry lawyer-farmer from Massachusetts, John Adams who is obnoxious and disliked, and seethes for independence with the diplomacy of a bulldozer. Howard DaSilva plays the calming and wise influence of Benjamin Franklin, David Ford as John Hancock, and Ken Howard plays the prolific writer from Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence.The tension builds in the Continental Congress as delegates scheme to get a declaration of independence by unanimous ballot that is reminiscent of the same wheeling and dealing that is characteristic of today's House of Representatives and the Senate of today. Naturally, the scheming also works to kill the unanimous vote, or at least exact their pound of flesh in concessions that foster 400 changes to the declaration before it can be approved. Finally, the vote comes to a head on July 4th with the threat of a no vote from the delegation of my home state, Pennsylvania. But the delegates vote as a majority, and there are three from the commonwealth. We all know what happens.Women do not have major roles in this film, not as much as they had in real life, but we see glimpses of Abigail Adams (Virginia Vestoff) whose counsel was revered by her husband in real life. Thomas Jefferson was unable to write the Declaration without a conjugal visit from his wife played by Blythe Danner.The music pokes fun at the disagreements between representatives, the romance between spouses, and the major role they played in the lives of Adams and Jefferson.1776 takes license in that the Declaration was not signed by all members on July 4th. The last signature came five years after. In David McCullough's book, ""John Adams,"" he stated that July 2nd would be remembered as the date of our Independence.I have seen this film and the play on Broadway in the 90's. Both were stirring. It is entertaining and it is Americana even if you don't know whom we declared our independence from. If you see it, you will know from whom-- I hope.It's more than just a date to remember.Happy Birthday, America!",5,It's More than Just A Date to Remember,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,2750,"['1776', 'American', 'year', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'even', 'one', 'five', 'Americans', ""n't"", 'know', 'whom', 'declared', 'independence', 'from.In', 'year', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'contentious', 'group', 'gentry', 'artisans', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'inventors', 'farmers', 'slave', 'owners', 'minister', 'struggle', 'loyalty', 'states', 'region', 'idea', 'independency', 'loyalty', 'crown', 'are', 'supposed', 'represent', 'people', 'represent', 'conscience', 'name', 'people', 'represent.Adapted', 'play', 'same', 'title', 'all-star', 'cast', 'performed', 'story', 'Broadway', 'film', 'William', 'Daniels', 'angry', 'lawyer-farmer', 'Massachusetts', 'John', 'Adams', 'who', 'obnoxious', 'disliked', 'seethes', 'independence', 'diplomacy', 'bulldozer', 'Howard', 'DaSilva', 'calming', 'wise', 'influence', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'David', 'Ford', 'John', 'Hancock', 'Ken', 'Howard', 'prolific', 'writer', 'Virginia', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'author', 'Declaration', 'Independence.The', 'tension', 'builds', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'delegates', 'scheme', 'get', 'declaration', 'independence', 'unanimous', 'ballot', 'reminiscent', 'same', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'characteristic', 'today', 'House', 'Representatives', 'Senate', 'today', 'Naturally', 'scheming', 'also', 'kill', 'unanimous', 'vote', 'least', 'exact', 'pound', 'flesh', 'concessions', 'foster', '400', 'changes', 'declaration', 'can', 'be', 'approved', 'Finally', 'vote', 'head', 'July', '4th', 'threat', 'vote', 'delegation', 'home', 'state', 'Pennsylvania', 'delegates', 'vote', 'majority', 'are', 'three', 'commonwealth', 'know', 'what', 'happens.Women', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'major', 'roles', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'real', 'life', 'see', 'glimpses', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'Virginia', 'Vestoff', 'counsel', 'was', 'revered', 'husband', 'real', 'life', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'was', 'unable', 'write', 'Declaration', 'conjugal', 'visit', 'wife', 'played', 'Blythe', 'Danner.The', 'music', 'fun', 'disagreements', 'representatives', 'romance', 'spouses', 'major', 'role', 'played', 'lives', 'Adams', 'Jefferson.1776', 'license', 'Declaration', 'was', 'not', 'signed', 'members', 'July', '4th', 'last', 'signature', 'came', 'five', 'years', 'David', 'McCullough', 'book', 'John', 'Adams', 'stated', 'July', '2nd', 'would', 'be', 'remembered', 'date', 'Independence.I', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'play', 'Broadway', '90', 'were', 'stirring', 'entertaining', 'Americana', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'whom', 'declared', 'independence', 'see', 'will', 'know', 'whom', 'hope.It', 'more', 'just', 'date', 'remember.Happy', 'Birthday', 'America']",N/A

The plain fact is the original theatrical version is superior.  (As is usually the case.)Yes, its' nice that some material cut from the theatrical version has been restored, particularly the song ""Cool, Conservative, Men"" (one of my favorites), but the violence done to the rest of the film is too high a price to pay.Let me provide one example.  The film begins with Adams at the top of the Bell Tower.  When he hears the absurdity Congress is debating instead of independence, he rushes down a long winding staircase, before bursting into the room where the other delegates are, and launching into the great opening number ""Piddle, twiddle, and resolve"".  Now, in the theatrical version his journey is accompanied by the opening credits and the Overture, making for a dramatic scene.  But in the Director's Cut there's nothing!

To some, a musical version of the signing of the Declaration of Independence must seem odd and truly out of place, perhaps blasphemous.  True, the music is not by Rodgers and Hammerstein, so there will be nothing from this film to whistle in the shower. But I can imagine this film, to most viewers anyway, ranking up there with &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; as required viewing every 4th of July.I am impressed with how the film (and play) stay close to history, although, for the sake of art, some details are changed.  The characters come alive, away from the dusty history books, and show humor and a great desire to do something wonderful for the world.The commentary is very informative.  How interesting it is to learn that, on President Richard Nixon's suggestion, friend Jack Warner (the film's producer) cut all references in the film showing conservatives standing in the way of independence.  Fortunately, the original, director's cut edition has been restored to DVD, and presents a film more fluid than what was found on the edited, pan-and-scan tape.If you don't care for the music, at least watch this great film to see what our Founding Fathers were up against in &quot;1776&quot;.

The DVD was finally released.If you had the VHS of it, you might consider getting the DVD anyway.  Not because the VHS is going to wear out eventually (even though it will) but because the DVD of 1776 has about 30 minutes more footage than the cassette-- bringing the grand total to just under three hours.But don't let that dissuade you.  Pack a lunch, and have a seat.There is at least one additional song, which I don't care for.  The song (Minuet) doesn't seem to fit in with the overall tone of the film, and it was well disposed of in the regular release.  Fortunately, I don't have to watch it if I don't want to (ain't that Skip button grand?)The rest of the additional footage enhances the rest of the film.  Character development is more robust, certain scenes flow into the subsequent scene more naturally.If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it to you.  If you are a student of history, you might be surprised how accurate some minor details are (A few lines were taken right from John Adams' mouth, as were some of Ben Franklin's)I'm not a big fan of musicals in general.  Usually, I prefer my movies with car chases and explosions.  Even I was won over by this musical, however.  The humor is always witty, and the songs even manage to seem natural (well, more so than other musicals).Now, I won't lie to you and say that Daniels has a beautiful singing voice as John Adams.  He doesn't and it really shows in his duets with Abigail.  His acting more than makes up for it, however, and most of his songs are ""hollering songs"" anyway, so it doesn't matter if he can sing or not.If you think America is a wicked, corrupt and totally evil nation that oppresses everyone and everything (in other words, if you're French), then you would be better off getting Born On The Fourth of July.

11971,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,0767813871,James Morris,"[7, 10]","Not long ago, I reviewed a musical film here, and received a commentary from a fellow reviewer who said they were curious if I'd done a review of another filmed musical, 1776.  At the time I thought, ""Oh that thing"" - I remembered seeing the show, and my reaction to it, but I'd forgotten how much I liked it, why I liked it - and vaguely remembered why I didn't like the film.  I had acquired the ""restored"" DVD some time ago, but didn't get around until now to watching it, or to renewing in my mind what I'd liked about the show some 37 years ago...I first saw 1776 on Broadway in 1971; it was, in fact, the first Broadway show I'd ever seen.  I was 17 at the time, and I now remember that I was blown away by the mix of history, music and patriotic sentiment that I saw on stage.  As many people know, the show surrounds the fight to get the Continental Congress to declare American independence, and how several members of Congress resisted the effort of the ""agitators"" to take up the ""treasonous"" cause of breaking with England.One of the most powerful moments in the show for me (as a young person, tired of the Viet Nam war at the time) was the song, Mama, Look Sharp, in which a messenger from George Washington recounts how a soldier lay dying in the battlefield, while his mother searches for him.  But the anti-war sentiment of that song was not as potent as the message in a song that immediately preceded Mama Look Sharp.That number was called, ""Cool, Cool Considerate Men"".  It was a song in which the ""right wing"" members of Congress boast of their expectancy to prevail in the debate over independence, and defeat the resolution.  Paul Hecht, as John Dickenson, gloats to his fellow conservative Congressmen, ""...don't forget that most men with nothing would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich, rather than face the reality of being poor.  That is why they will follow usTo the rightEver to the rightNever to the leftForever to the right...""When I saw the film version at Radio City Music hall, I was disturbed that the song, ""Cool, Cool Considerate Men"" had been excised from the film.  According to the notes on the DVD, then-President Richard Nixon himself objected to the song, and the producers reluctantly agreed to delete it, rather than incite controversy.  Happily, the restored director's cut includes this important song in its entirety, and alters the focus of the narrative.Now, visiting this film 37 years later, I am struck by the irony and topicality of the song, its meaning and its basis in history.  Of course, Ben Franklin and John Adams did not dance in the halls while the first reading of the Declaration of Independence took place, but the creators of 1776 were very careful to preserve the attitudes, beliefs and advocacies of the main characters presented in the show.  And if the presentations of those attitudes and beliefs are historically accurate (and there is little reason to doubt that they are) the fact seems to be that American Independence came down to a struggle between conservative forces who wanted to preserve the status quo, and progressives who wanted to advance the cause of liberty.  After all, Adams, Jefferson, Hancock and Franklin were all, in their own way, revolutionaries (why do you think it was called the American Revolution?) and their cause was not only unpopular, it was in fact quite radical.It somehow has become fashionable to link the left with a lack of patriotism.  It is therefore with a great deal of pride in my own liberal sentiments that I heartily recommend the restored version of 1776 as a testament to the fact that our founding fathers were very much revolutionaries, and the reality that the very birth of our country was a triumph of progressive values over conservative ones.  The year after the film 1776 was released, I voted for the first time.  I have never missed an election since, and I have never pulled the voting lever for anything but what I consider progressive candidates or issues.  That's the Revolutionary spirit, and I am proud to call myself a ""progressive"", just as John Adams and Benjamin Franklin are portrayed as progressives in 1776.Although some of the musical numbers, romanticism and sentimentality of 1776 are, at times, over the top, the basic message is solid, and definitely worth a look.  And the next time someone tells you that ""liberals"" are unpatriotic, tell them to watch 1776.  They just may get a few surprises.",5,A Salute To Our Radical Forefathers,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,4458,"['Not', 'long', 'ago', 'reviewed', 'musical', 'film', 'here', 'received', 'commentary', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'were', 'curious', ""'d"", 'done', 'review', 'filmed', 'musical', '1776', 'time', 'thought', 'Oh', 'thing', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'show', 'reaction', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'why', 'liked', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'had', 'acquired', 'restored', 'DVD', 'time', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'now', 'watching', 'renewing', 'mind', 'what', ""'d"", 'liked', 'show', '37', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'saw', '1776', 'Broadway', '1971', 'was', 'fact', 'first', 'Broadway', 'show', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', '17', 'time', 'now', 'remember', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'mix', 'history', 'music', 'patriotic', 'sentiment', 'saw', 'stage', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'show', 'fight', 'get', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'declare', 'American', 'independence', 'how', 'several', 'members', 'Congress', 'resisted', 'effort', 'agitators', 'take', 'up', 'treasonous', 'cause', 'breaking', 'England.One', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'show', 'young', 'person', 'tired', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'time', 'was', 'song', 'Mama', 'Look', 'Sharp', 'messenger', 'George', 'Washington', 'how', 'soldier', 'lay', 'dying', 'battlefield', 'mother', 'searches', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'song', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'potent', 'message', 'song', 'immediately', 'preceded', 'Mama', 'Look', 'Sharp.That', 'number', 'was', 'called', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Considerate', 'Men', 'was', 'song', 'right', 'wing', 'members', 'Congress', 'boast', 'expectancy', 'prevail', 'debate', 'independence', 'defeat', 'resolution', 'Paul', 'Hecht', 'John', 'Dickenson', 'fellow', 'conservative', 'Congressmen', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'most', 'men', 'nothing', 'would', 'rather', 'protect', 'possibility', 'becoming', 'rich', 'rather', 'face', 'reality', 'being', 'poor', 'why', 'will', 'follow', 'rightEver', 'rightNever', 'leftForever', 'right', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'version', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'hall', 'was', 'disturbed', 'song', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Considerate', 'Men', 'had', 'been', 'excised', 'film', 'According', 'notes', 'DVD', 'then-President', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'objected', 'song', 'producers', 'reluctantly', 'agreed', 'delete', 'rather', 'incite', 'controversy', 'Happily', 'restored', 'director', 'cut', 'important', 'song', 'entirety', 'focus', 'narrative.Now', 'visiting', 'film', '37', 'years', 'later', 'am', 'struck', 'irony', 'topicality', 'song', 'meaning', 'basis', 'history', 'course', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'John', 'Adams', 'did', 'not', 'dance', 'halls', 'first', 'reading', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'took', 'place', 'creators', '1776', 'were', 'very', 'careful', 'preserve', 'attitudes', 'beliefs', 'advocacies', 'main', 'characters', 'presented', 'show', 'presentations', 'attitudes', 'beliefs', 'are', 'historically', 'accurate', 'little', 'reason', 'doubt', 'are', 'fact', 'be', 'American', 'Independence', 'came', 'down', 'struggle', 'conservative', 'forces', 'who', 'wanted', 'preserve', 'status', 'quo', 'progressives', 'who', 'wanted', 'advance', 'cause', 'liberty', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'Hancock', 'Franklin', 'were', 'own', 'way', 'revolutionaries', 'why', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'called', 'American', 'Revolution', 'cause', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'unpopular', 'was', 'fact', 'quite', 'radical.It', 'somehow', 'become', 'fashionable', 'link', 'left', 'lack', 'patriotism', 'therefore', 'great', 'deal', 'pride', 'own', 'liberal', 'sentiments', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'restored', 'version', '1776', 'testament', 'fact', 'founding', 'fathers', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'revolutionaries', 'reality', 'very', 'birth', 'country', 'was', 'triumph', 'progressive', 'values', 'conservative', 'ones', 'year', 'film', '1776', 'was', 'released', 'voted', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'never', 'missed', 'election', 'have', 'never', 'pulled', 'voting', 'lever', 'anything', 'what', 'consider', 'progressive', 'candidates', 'issues', 'Revolutionary', 'spirit', 'am', 'proud', 'call', 'progressive', 'just', 'John', 'Adams', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'are', 'portrayed', 'progressives', '1776.Although', 'musical', 'numbers', 'romanticism', 'sentimentality', '1776', 'are', 'times', 'top', 'basic', 'message', 'solid', 'definitely', 'look', 'next', 'time', 'someone', 'liberals', 'are', 'unpatriotic', 'tell', 'watch', '1776', 'just', 'may', 'get', 'few', 'surprises']",N/A

11974,A27ZGHVF9IAADV,0767813871,jimac51,"[3, 3]","First,a note about closed captioning-an important feature in this household. The DVD has yellow English subtitles which do not interfere with the widescreen viewing and the CC(which we prefer) on our set converts the words wonderfully. Interesting that a recent showing of this film on Turner Movie Classics still does not have the CC available(they are usually very good about broadcasting CC,while boneheaded AMC could care less)-a main reason why we spent the money for the DVD.Much of both the negative and positive criticisms contain truths. It is a bit stilted. Watching historical figures break into song and dance a la Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly takes some getting used to. Comparing this kind of movie musical to the then-current ""Cabaret"" is a bit unfair. On its own terms and with repeated viewings,this show takes on a life of is own. The idea of keeping many ties to the Broadway version(including director Peter Hunt, choreographer Onna White and Orchestrator Eddie Sauter,ands casting many of the stage actors instead of film stars was probably one reason why the film version sank at the box office but why it glows today. Most of the players here were not overexposed in other projects.  Blythe Danner is probably the closest who became a movie star(filmed here while pregnant and carrying future movie star Gwyneth Paltrow),while Daniels,Cullum and Howard achieved success on TV. Da Silva,out of film work for years during the Hollywood Communist blacklisting,steals many a scene as Franklin. And I bet there are few patriots who aren't moved by Daniel's look into the future, ""Is Anybody There?"",-the sentiments expressed in the song are still true today.A tad too long,yes,but there really isn't anything here that should be left out,especially since Executive Producer Jack Warner tried this and did the wrong thing.People following Daniels career will see lots of inside references to his work in ""1776"" in future TV projects,""St. Elsewhere"" and ""Boy Meets World"",besides other roles Daniels has taken on portraying members of the real Adams family(I wonder if there are any references in ""Knight Rider""?).",5,Better with age,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,2128,"['First', 'note', 'closed', 'captioning-an', 'important', 'feature', 'household', 'DVD', 'yellow', 'English', 'subtitles', 'do', 'not', 'interfere', 'widescreen', 'viewing', 'CC', 'prefer', 'set', 'words', 'wonderfully', 'Interesting', 'recent', 'showing', 'film', 'Turner', 'Movie', 'Classics', 'still', 'not', 'have', 'CC', 'available', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'good', 'broadcasting', 'CC', 'boneheaded', 'AMC', 'could', 'care', 'less', '-a', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'spent', 'money', 'DVD.Much', 'negative', 'positive', 'criticisms', 'contain', 'truths', 'bit', 'stilted', 'Watching', 'historical', 'figures', 'break', 'song', 'dance', 'la', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'getting', 'used', 'Comparing', 'kind', 'movie', 'musical', 'then-current', 'Cabaret', 'bit', 'unfair', 'own', 'terms', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'show', 'life', 'own', 'idea', 'keeping', 'many', 'ties', 'Broadway', 'version', 'including', 'director', 'Peter', 'Hunt', 'choreographer', 'Onna', 'White', 'Orchestrator', 'Eddie', 'Sauter', 'casting', 'many', 'stage', 'actors', 'instead', 'film', 'stars', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'version', 'sank', 'box', 'office', 'why', 'today', 'Most', 'players', 'here', 'were', 'not', 'overexposed', 'other', 'projects', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'probably', 'closest', 'who', 'became', 'movie', 'star', 'filmed', 'here', 'pregnant', 'carrying', 'future', 'movie', 'star', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Daniels', 'Cullum', 'Howard', 'achieved', 'success', 'TV', 'Da', 'Silva', 'film', 'work', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'Communist', 'blacklisting', 'steals', 'many', 'scene', 'Franklin', 'bet', 'are', 'few', 'patriots', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'moved', 'Daniel', 'look', 'future', 'Anybody', '-the', 'sentiments', 'expressed', 'song', 'are', 'still', 'true', 'today.A', 'tad', 'too', 'long', 'yes', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'especially', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'tried', 'did', 'wrong', 'thing.People', 'following', 'Daniels', 'career', 'will', 'see', 'lots', 'inside', 'references', 'work', '1776', 'future', 'TV', 'projects', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'other', 'roles', 'Daniels', 'taken', 'portraying', 'members', 'real', 'Adams', 'family', 'wonder', 'are', 'references', 'Knight', 'Rider']",N/A

11980,A14PWKNFN0K560,0767813871,John D. Bartone,"[6, 10]","1776 has never been one of my favorite musicals.  I missed the original stage production but gave the original cast album a listen or two over the years and never really took to it.  At some point years ago I saw the movie on commercial television and thought it was sturdy, not stellar, entertainment.  But having read the many raves at this site and having read several books on the Founding Fathers in the past eighteen months, I was game for another look.It's better than I remembered.  The strong points here are the book and the acting. It's a surprisingly accurate history lesson.  The debates leading up to the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence are compelling drama.  Yes, there are a couple of liberties taken with the facts, as in Martha Jefferson's visit to Philadelphia (it never happened), but this is a musical, not a documentary, and it should be judged as such.  The liberties taken work well dramatically.  And John Adams' pivotal role in the founding of our nation was first popularized not last year in David McCullough's best-selling biography, but thirty years earlier in, of all things, a Broadway musical.William Daniels is superb as Adams, pulling off the difficult trick of making a dislikable man sympathetic to the audience.  This is at least in part due to the tender relationship between him and his wife, Abigail.  Howard DeSilva perfectly embodies Benjamin Franklin.  And Blythe Danner as Martha Jefferson is radiant as always.The music is serviceable.  It isn't on a par with the great musical scores.  The same could be said for the production as a whole.  This is an old-fashioned musical, not the best or the worst of the genre.  It has been transferred to the screen in a thoroughly professional, entertaining fashion.  It's not ground-breaking cinema, and I don't think it was meant to be.  I'm happy I saw it.  I don't need to see it again.  The bottom line: better than sturdy, still not stellar.One note about the commentary track: the director and writer spend way too much time describing the action.

It opens in Philadelphia to a rousing chorus of ""Sit Down John"".The back story was quite interesting, the process that produced The Declaration of Indpendence, the delegate infighting, nit picking & the historic choice of Adams, Ben Franklin (Howard DaSilva) & Thomas Jefferson (Ken Howard) to serve on the committee to write the document. Adams & Franklin both knew that Adams was so disliked by the other delegates that anything written by him would be immediately ripped to shreds & rejected. So it falls to Jefferson to actually write most of it. But he was homesick for his beloved Virginia & more importantly, his wife, Martha (Blythe Danner). She arrives and  raises his sprits so to speak, & joins Adams & Franklin in an early morning musical romp through the streets of colonial Philadelphia while Jefferson sleeps. Lots of musical highlights such as ""The Lees of Virginia"".  ""Molasses & Rum"" is performed during the debate on the wording of the Declaration. Isn't  the phase, ""All men are created equal,"" rather hypocritical when it does not include African slaves? That & other problems are glossed over for other generations  to deal with.

Adams, with help from Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Richard Henry Lee, performs herculean feats of cajoling, bartering and almost everything else under the sun to get the job done. As the liberty bell tolls, the delegates all sign their names - totally without 20/20 hindsight, keep in mind - knowing that if they're caught by the British they'll be hanged.Female presence is provided by Abigail Adams, whose conversations in letters with her husband here take place in his mind, and Martha Jefferson, who unfortunately seems somewhat generic and added largely to counterbalance the overwhelming male presence in the musical. John Dickinson represents the conscientious dissenters for whom the break with England was a truly agonizing decision, while Edward Rutledge represents the Southern delegates who blocked the slavery issue from reaching the table.Interestingly, the most memorable numbers in the musical might be Rutledge's ""Molasses and Rum"", in which he savagely blasts any notion that the North is guiltless in the slavery issue, and ""Mama Look Sharp"", sung by a nameless young Continental Army messenger whose increasingly disheveled appearance everytime he marches in with a dispatch from Washington is a running joke of sorts - until he starts to talk of his participation in the beginning of the war and is suddenly transformed into his friend dying on Lexington Green.

Bernabo,"[268, 270]","Every 4th of July I watch ""1776,"" the musical that has our Founding Fathers singing and dancing their way to Independency, and every time John and Abagail Adams sing goodbye to each other (""Till Then"" and ""Yours, Yours, Yours""), I get choked up.  William Daniels has his role of a lifetime as John Adams, the obnoxious and disliked Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress who is the most fervent advocate of independence (""Piddle, Twiddle and Resolve"").  Virginia Vestoff plays his wife Abigail, and their exchanges are based on the ""Dearest Friend"" correspondences they wrote to each other during the crucial summer of 1776.  However, the most unforgettable performance in ""1776"" comes from Howard Da Silva as Dr. Benjamin Franklin.  The actor, who played movie villains for years, manages to convey not only Franklin's wit but also his firm belief in the new race of ""Americans.""  Ken Howard plays Thomas Jefferson and joins with Adams and Franklin in the show's two cutest numbers, ""But, Mr. Adams"" and ""The Egg.""  I have never cottoned ""The Lees of Old Virginia,"" the song sung by Richard Henry Lee (Ron Holgate) and where every lyric line ends with ""LY,"" but at the other end of the spectrum is the chilling ""Molasses to Rum to Slaves,"" the song about the Triangle Trade sung by South Carolina's Edward Rutledge (John Cullum).  The ensemble cast brings the Second Continental Congress alive, with Roy Poole as Stephen Hopkins, David Ford as John Hancock and William Hansen as Caesar Rodney standing out.  Most of the cast members were in the Tony Award winning original Broadway cast, although Blythe Danner replaces Betty Buckley as Martha Jefferson (""He Plays the Violin"").Peter Stone's book is remarkably accurate in relating the historical events; the biggest error a historian would point to is that John Dickinson (Donald Madden), did not show up the day of the crucial vote so that Pennsylvania would not kill Independence.  But Broadway and Hollywood must be allowed to make things more dramatic.  What makes ""1776"" so wonderful is how it teaches history while being so entertaining.  The opening of the film, where the tirade by Mr. Adams against the do nothing Continental Congress is interrupted by the collective Founding Fathers jumping up and singing ""Sit Down, John,"" sets the tone and Peter H. Hunt's film delivers throughout.  The show's best moment comes in ""Is Anybody There?"" when John Adams, all alone in the quiet chamber, dreams of the pomp and pageantry of a free America.I also have the laserdisc version, which runs 176 minutes and includes 35 minutes of material originally cut from the film, including the song ""Cool, Considerate Men"" and alternative shots in several sequences.  While the quality of the additional material is in very sad shape, fans of ""1776"" will take what they can get.  Hopefully the complete film can be restored before we get to the DVD version (hint, hint, hint).  Granted, the idea of a musical about the Declaration of Independence seems bizarre; I once blew off a chance to see ""1776"" on stage because I thought the idea was stupid.  But this is a first-rate musical that makes the time and issues come alive, so that even thought we obviously know the outcome, we are enthralled because it looks like Mr. Adams will never get his Declaration adopted.  If you are looking for a film to watch each 4th of July, ""1776"" is the one.",5,The movie to watch every year on the Fourth of July,995587200,"07 20, 2001",2001,3400,"['4th', 'July', 'watch', '1776', 'musical', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'singing', 'dancing', 'way', 'Independency', 'time', 'John', 'Abagail', 'Adams', 'sing', 'goodbye', 'other', 'Till', 'Then', 'Yours', 'Yours', 'Yours', 'get', 'choked', 'up', 'William', 'Daniels', 'role', 'lifetime', 'John', 'Adams', 'obnoxious', 'disliked', 'Massachusetts', 'delegate', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'who', 'most', 'fervent', 'advocate', 'independence', 'Piddle', 'Twiddle', 'Resolve', 'Virginia', 'Vestoff', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'exchanges', 'are', 'based', 'Dearest', 'Friend', 'correspondences', 'wrote', 'other', 'crucial', 'summer', '1776', 'However', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'performance', '1776', 'Howard', 'Da', 'Silva', 'Dr.', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'movie', 'villains', 'years', 'convey', 'not', 'only', 'Franklin', 'wit', 'also', 'firm', 'belief', 'new', 'race', 'Americans', 'Ken', 'Howard', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Adams', 'Franklin', 'show', 'two', 'cutest', 'numbers', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'Egg', 'have', 'never', 'cottoned', 'Lees', 'Old', 'Virginia', 'song', 'sung', 'Richard', 'Henry', 'Lee', 'Ron', 'Holgate', 'where', 'lyric', 'line', 'LY', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'chilling', 'Molasses', 'Rum', 'Slaves', 'song', 'Triangle', 'Trade', 'sung', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Edward', 'Rutledge', 'John', 'Cullum', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Second', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'alive', 'Roy', 'Poole', 'Stephen', 'Hopkins', 'David', 'Ford', 'John', 'Hancock', 'William', 'Hansen', 'Caesar', 'Rodney', 'standing', 'out', 'Most', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'Tony', 'Award', 'winning', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'Martha', 'Jefferson', 'Violin', '.Peter', 'Stone', 'book', 'remarkably', 'accurate', 'relating', 'historical', 'events', 'biggest', 'error', 'historian', 'would', 'point', 'John', 'Dickinson', 'Donald', 'Madden', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'day', 'crucial', 'vote', 'Pennsylvania', 'would', 'not', 'kill', 'Independence', 'Broadway', 'Hollywood', 'must', 'be', 'allowed', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'dramatic', 'What', '1776', 'so', 'wonderful', 'how', 'history', 'being', 'so', 'entertaining', 'opening', 'film', 'where', 'tirade', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'do', 'nothing', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'interrupted', 'collective', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'jumping', 'up', 'singing', 'Sit', 'Down', 'John', 'tone', 'Peter', 'H.', 'Hunt', 'film', 'delivers', 'show', 'best', 'moment', 'Is', 'Anybody', 'when', 'John', 'Adams', 'alone', 'quiet', 'chamber', 'dreams', 'pomp', 'pageantry', 'free', 'America.I', 'also', 'have', 'laserdisc', 'version', '176', 'minutes', '35', 'minutes', 'material', 'originally', 'cut', 'film', 'including', 'song', 'Cool', 'Considerate', 'Men', 'alternative', 'shots', 'several', 'sequences', 'quality', 'additional', 'material', 'very', 'sad', 'shape', 'fans', '1776', 'will', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'Hopefully', 'complete', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'restored', 'get', 'DVD', 'version', 'hint', 'hint', 'hint', 'Granted', 'idea', 'musical', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'bizarre', 'once', 'blew', 'off', 'chance', 'see', '1776', 'stage', 'thought', 'idea', 'was', 'stupid', 'first-rate', 'musical', 'time', 'issues', 'come', 'alive', 'even', 'thought', 'obviously', 'know', 'outcome', 'are', 'enthralled', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'Declaration', 'adopted', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'watch', '4th', 'July', '1776', 'one']",N/A

And I thought, why has it never gotten iconic status, with NYers telling me it's the best musical they've ever seen?  I did see an excellent version later on at a very good theatre, and was stunned at how good it was.  So I bought the movie, and loved it.  Yes, I joined the club, especially being a Revolutionary War history buff.  Ok, some of the history is not so sharp, but it's still fun.  It certainly seems to capture some of the character of Adams and Franklin.I also have a thing about movies being edited.  So often plot is sacrificed for time, leaving the movie disjointed and me thinking, ""But I don't understand this part...""  So when I had a chance to see the unedited version, I was thrilled.  Ha!Guess what?  It was left out for a reason.  A.  The movie is really, really long.  B.  The song is not good and C.  The most damning of all, it takes a historical movie and puts a modern political view in it, mainly that the founding fathers were leftists!  Aha!  Those evil conservatives!  Tories!  All they want is money! Those evil businessmen are all leftists...Wait...Huh?Now some of them were leftist no doubt (Certain views of Thomas Paine come to mind) but people that were fighting for less government control and taxes, and formed a government that was a representative Republic - well, it can be argued they were what today is considered conservative.  So ""To the right, ever to the right, Never to the left, forever to the right, We have gold, a market that will hold, Tradition that is old, a reluctance to be bold..."" being sung by the Tories is where the movie takes a hard lurch for me into modern leftist Hollywood politics.  It certainly tries to put a modern political spin on 1776, and it doesn't belong there.So glad they left it out.  I'm sure some would disagree with me, but I mean, leave the partisan lectures out of this one, especially when they are inaccurate, so I can enjoy the movie.

Where the tape receives a 5 stars from me, the DVD suffers from the POOR JUDGMENT of director Hunt in his ""Director's Cut"" version. Jack Warner, who produced the tape version, definitely had better judgment concerning content and pacing. Changing the movie from 140 minutes to about 165 requires extreme skill and care, which Hunt lacked. I love 150 minutes of the movies, however there are 15 more minutes to watch. The added minutes had been removed by Jack Warner. These deleted scenes would in most all cases have been better seen in the Bonus material section or in a full, second version of the movie. Hunt and the distributors seem to feel that putting ""Director's Cut"" at the top of the DVD box adds justification to purchase the movie. Are director cuts always superior to the original?The controversial ""Cool, Cool Men"" was added and the prominent justification in liner notes states that President Nixon opposed it - a cheap, condescending statement to avoid saying Warner did not believe it fit the movie. I agree with Warner! The song fails on numerous counts. First, it digresses from the movie theme of GAINING INDEPENDENCE. Second, the MINUET sequence BETWEEN MEN who were boldly risking their lives and fortunes by participating in the Continent Congress is plain WRONG. Third, the idea presented in the song that these courageous men were CONSERVATIVE, RICH men - who at the same time they putting forth ideas followed by progressives around the world to aid in democracy's growth and to help end absolute monarchy found in most European countries is ludicrous. Fourth, not all those participating in the song were wealthy. Five, the song ends with a wisecrack from one of their aides, on how they were cheapskates to the lower classes - hey Hunt, check history on their generosity to charities! Finally, the song is a straight political shot.The film also drags with the extended song/conversations between John Adams and his wife, Abigail. In fact, the DVD version could be renamed to ""John Adams"".A big plus added to the DVD is the exchange between Rutledge of South Carolina and John Adams of Massachusetts on the sovereignty of the individual states versus the national government, an advance look at one of the causes of the Civil War.The DVD's sound is wonderful, and its visual appearance is also great! Again, I love 150 minutes of the movie, but there are 15 minutes more to watch.Bottom Line - I will view the DVD with a remote in my hand to bypass the parts that don't work.

Now, just because this movie has songs in it does not mean that it loses its historical quality.  Actually, I found it to be quite the contrary.  Without the songs, I think that the movie would be dull.  One of my favorites was deciding who should be the one to write the Declaration.  We all know that in the end, Thomas Jefferson is the lucky one who gets to write it.  When John and his wife, Abigail (played by Virginia Vestoff) are writing letters back and forth to one another in the form of songs, it is just gorgeous, not only in the way the story of their longingness for one another is, but the sets as well.

Most of the Broadway cast has been retained, particularly William Daniels, Ken Howard and Howard Da Silva, all of whom are brilliant as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin, respectively.  Among the new-to-the-movie performances, Blythe Danner is an absolute delight as Martha Jefferson and John Cullum's rendition of ""Molasses to Rum to Slaves,"" which hammers the hypocrisy of the Northern colonial abolitionists who still profited from the slave trade is staggering.  Truth is, there isn't a bad performance, singing or acting, in this entire film.  The sets of 18th century Philadelphia are wonderfully evocative and the lighting and camera work, particularly some brilliantly s-l-o-o-o-o-w-w-w-w lap dissolves, are terrific.  Probably in any other year, this film would have been well represented at the Oscars (but it came out against ""The Godfather"").  What makes the DVD so special is not just the pristine look of the film, but the restoration of several scenes, long and short, which had never before been seen, including one entire number (""Cool Conservative Men"") which gave Richard Nixon, then president, fits.  Watch it, particularly the choreography, and you'll know why.  Even better is the very incisive and informative commentary track, which actually gives insight into the production.

12017,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,0767813871,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","I'm a 26 year old male, and myself and my 16 year old sister LOVE this film! A few years ago, one fourth of July morning, I caught this film on cinemax. I'd seen bits and pieces of it before, like on the previous, much better version of the Disney Channel, but I had never seen the best scenes, only the ones that, having not seen the rest of the film, appeared a bit weird, and corny, upon channel surfing discovery. When I saw it from the beginning however, it was a whole new experience! It has truly become one of my favorite films of all time! I love musicals, and I love the time period this one is set in, not to mention outstanding performances, great songs, and characters who are at times very comical, and at other times very serious! It's an amazing film!For those of you who haven't seen it, 1776 is a musical that tells the story of the Continental Congress as it decides whether or not to declare a war of Independence on England. Sounds like a dull history book subject? Not at all! These characters are so real and endearing that you can't help but get involved in the emotion and urgency of the debate. This isn't like watching c-span or something, this is a very different kind of Congress than you're familiar with today. These are real, downhome people, upon whose shoulders rest the decision whether or not creating the United States would be worth the risk of treason! Believe it or not, they've managed to turn such a story into a GREAT musical! The songs are quirky, but they grow on you! Kinda like in Popeye! Well, they're better songs than in Popeye, but you know what I mean. And who can hear &quot;Mama, Look Sharp&quot; without breaking into tears?! The movie begins as John Adams, Super Patriot, argues against a congress of nay-sayers, the importance of declaring independence from England. No one will agree, it's just too dangerous. On Adams' side are his friends Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Richard Henry Lee, all of whom are hilarious in their roles. Yes, this is as much a musical comedy as a musical drama. In debating the subject with the less agreeable patriots and loyalists in congress, it is decided a Declaration of Independence must be written, upon the merit of which will be decided the fate of our nation, if it is to be one that is. Much debating takes place over the result of Thomas Jefferson's pen. It gets more intense as you might think, as the South does not want to give up their slaves, and some loyalists simply do not want to get in bad with England! Of course, it's no surprise how in the end we see the members lining up to sign the Declaration, but even knowing that will be the end result, it's amazing to see it come about from a seemingly hopeless beginning! A terrific movie for any real patriot! A must have, and I insist on a DVD, with loads of extras as I don't know much yet about this fine production beyond what I got from the soundtrack insert of the original Broadway version. As an added treat for my generation and those younger ones, you'll find that the main character of John Adams is played by the same actor who plays teacher Mr. Feeny on TV's Boy Meets World! You'll watch Mr. Feeny with an all new respect after seeing this film!!!! All I can say is buy this movie, and if you love musicals and you love America, you won't regret it!",5,I agree!

It made me feel as if I wasn't seeing the entire play, as I had enjoyed the number on stage many times, and I often wondered why it was cut. The number took about four minutes or so; in a movie already over two hours, what's another four minutes. When DVD's became reality, I hoped the picture would be restored to its original version.And it's so nice to get one's wish. Not only is the missing number restored (incidentially, it's one of the livliest in the movie), but the movie as a whole was restored rather than just slapping the video onto DVD. The picture is crisp and the sound excellent, as it must be for a musical. Fans used to the video version should also note that the opening is changed; the titles come first instead of being melded into the scene where Adams is descending the stairway from the attic in Independence Hall to tell Congress just what he thinks in the film's opening number. Frankly I prefer the video's version of this scene, but hey, I'm not complaining.For those of you who haven't yet seen the movie: what are you waiting for? This is the history you wish you had been taught in school instead of the seemingly endless droning on about dates of events. &quot;1776&quot; tells not only how the Declaration of Independence came about, but also why, and exactly how close it came to not being adopted, if not for some last minute old fashioned politicking. Some things change but always remain the same, it seems. For those who think a musical about the adoption of the Declaration of Independence is unseemly, just take a peek. One viewing should assuage your feelings of doubt. The musical numbers are not only lively and well done, but pertinent to the subject and actually catchy.

It brings together the many perspectives of the men who formed the Congress that created the Declaration of Independence.  These were not a group of men with the same idea.  They were men who came to the congress with their own particular ideas and ideals which they wanted to preserve.  Some of the characters, Caesar Rodney and James Wilson are rather inaccurate but they add to the drama of the production.  Edward Rutledge's performance of Molasses to Rum to Slaves is interesting, not to mention just a little chilling and illustrates the many perspectives of the participants at the congress.  Howard de Silva and James Daniels are outstanding as Franklin and John Adams but all the actors by their performances add tremendously to the production.If there is any particulary impressive scene that might strike a note with today, it is Washington's last despatch to The Congress - wherein he asks for the status of a reply to his previous despatches and ends with ""Is anybody there, does anybody care?"" and Thompson, the Secretary of the Congress, feels that Washington is talking to him.

I was 10 when the movie came out, so I could not have put it in words then, but forever after I have been mesmerized by how charged Cullum's performance is. An extra plus is that the widescreen format brings the context back to a lot of the songs as you see the characters interact with each other and framed properly in the shots.People of all ages will enjoy this film because it brings the personalities to life. The dialog includes actual quotes from the real characters, and you get to experience the Founding Fathers as real people, not just pictures in a book.

But when you see the movie, it's a joy, sometimes hilarious, often profound, and educational to boot.  Almost all of it takes place in the continental congress in Philadelphia in the weeks leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the 4th of July 1776.  While the story does take some literary license with historical details, the thrust of it is accurate, in terms of the changing positions of the various colonies and their representatives, the issues affecting them, and so forth.William Daniels (Captain Nice) plays John Adams, who's frustrated in his futile attempts to pursuade congress to declare independency.  Howard Da Silva (Keeper Of The Flame, Fourteen Hours) plays Benjamin Franklin, who suggests Adams let someone outside New England propose independency.  When Richard Henry Lee does so, they almost get their way; but a vote on the question is called before they have time to present their case, so to stall for time they form a committee to write a Declaration Of Independence, and of course the actual writing falls upon Thomas Jefferson (Ken Howard).  All the fine actors of the cast bring these historical figures to life with gusto, making what might otherwise seem a dull history lesson move along with drama, comedy, tension, romance, and song.A further hurdle makes Adams' quest almost impossible when friend John Hancock votes with the opposition to require that the Declaration of Independence must be unanimous to prevent the potential situation of colonies fighting on opposing sides in the war.  Many of the important issues, including slavery, are explored with heated argument, song, or both, as the Declaration is written, debated, revised, and finally . . . after an uphill battle against desperate odds . . . passed.Some of the songs are timeless, and in addition to the dramatic debate, occasional reports of the war are received from General George Washington.  There's quite a lot here to entertain and educate.  Our entire class was taken by a teacher to see 1776, in 6th or 7th grade, some 30 years ago.  It instantly became one of my all-time favorites (though shortly thereafter Star Wars came out).

With the magic of imagination and plenty of melody, movie viewers get to see Thomas Jefferson (Ken Howard), John Adams (William Daniels), and Benjamin Franklin (Howard Da Silva) sing and dance.  The film hearkens back to the rollicking entertainment movie musicals of the 1950s, but this is not a Rodgers and Hammerstein production, but a blend of historical fact and fiction set to choreography and music.Director Peter Hunt brings history alive and shows members of the Continental Congress of 1776 attempting to meet a consensus for independence from British rule.  Indeed, these men were a partisan group from all walks of life, and one can see that in 1776 there had already existed a disturbing divide between North and South amongst the delegates of each respective state, and the issue of slavery; this may be one of the serious aspects of the film as well as the depiction of the writing of the Declaration of Independence.  However, aside from all seriousness, Hunt integrates the humor and the eccentric behavior that was exhibited by each member of the delegation within Independence Hall.  This was displayed in scenes with Adams and Jefferson and Franklin choosing what kind of bird should be used as a symbol of the United States, and their ideas ranged from a turkey to an eagle.  There is also an interesting and somewhat peculiar scene where Franklin is brought into the building where the delegates are gathered, and two men carry him in a carriage as if he was royalty.Overall, 1776 was a delight to see in DVD form.

This film should be a ""must see"" in every school and to every school kid american or not.The music is wonderful, both comic and dead serious.

The costumes, stage settings, props all speak for themselves. If you haven't seen this do yourself a big favor,,,,,buy it.

12044,AO6U3C5QH8CON,0767813871,"Samuel Louis ""raisindot""","[3, 3]","&quot;1776&quot; has always been one of my favorite musicals. It broke no new ground, and had no songs that became &quot;standards&quot; but it made history come alive in a way few movies ever have, and presented the founding fathers not as gods but as all-too-human people plagued with all-too-human frailties but who somehow managed to overcome their regional and philosophical differences and forge a new nation together.The movie version was extremely stagey and not particularly well directed, and its audio quality was atrocious, but it was more than made up by the solid quality of the play and the perfect casting. I simply can't imagine anyone other than William Daniels playing John Adams (indeed, he went on to play Adams' father in PBS's &quot;The Adams Chronicles&quot;) or Howard Da Silva playing Franklin (just listen to the original Broadway recording, which features someone else playing Franklin, to see the difference--in fact, Da Silva did such a good job he went on to play Franklin in a series of &quot;Bicentennial Minutes&quot; in 1976)). Ken Howard, in pre-&quot;White Shadow&quot; days, plays a very staid Tom Jefferson.What always nagged me about the movie version was how how much of the material from the original musical was left out. In addition, the VHS version was plagued with terrible sound, and the most horrible pan and scan I've ever seen in a movie (so bad that you can't tell who is speaking in certain scenes because they're off frame). The DVD finally solves most of the problems, restoring several key scenes. A restored section of debate on the resolution for Independence is welcome, and highlights the the jarring editing in the original release where these scenes were cut. Most importantly, the musical number &quot;Cool, Considerate Men,&quot; which very lucidly explains the philosophy of the anti-independence bloc, is restored (apparently, producer Jack Warner caved in to Richard Nixon's objections to the scene). Even without Nixon's beef, the piece isn't well directed and drags the movie a bit, but within a home viewing context it really is welcome.Most importantly, the movie is restored to wide-screen format, so the pan and scan is gone. This is most important for numbers such as &quot;The Egg&quot; and &quot;Molasses to Rum.&quot; Unfortunately, the transfer to DVD highlights some of the film's flaws. The lighting is terrible in some places. The soundtrack quality remains tinny. Some of the editing is very jarring. But the technical flaws are overcome by the sheer quality of the performances.Your enjoyment of the movie will be based solely on whether you like the play. Pauline Kael hated it; thinking that it burlesqued the founding fathers. I don't agree. Franklin was a hilarious, bawdy man. Adams was a hot-tempered egotist. &quot;1776&quot; portrays them better than any wooden PBS or educational film ever could.",4,Finally--independence from the wretched VHS release!,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,2887,"['quot', '1776', 'quot', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'musicals', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'had', 'songs', 'became', 'quot', 'standards', 'quot', 'made', 'history', 'come', 'alive', 'way', 'few', 'movies', 'ever', 'have', 'presented', 'founding', 'fathers', 'not', 'gods', 'all-too-human', 'people', 'plagued', 'all-too-human', 'frailties', 'who', 'somehow', 'managed', 'overcome', 'regional', 'philosophical', 'differences', 'forge', 'new', 'nation', 'together.The', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'extremely', 'stagey', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'directed', 'audio', 'quality', 'was', 'atrocious', 'was', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'solid', 'quality', 'play', 'perfect', 'casting', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'other', 'William', 'Daniels', 'playing', 'John', 'Adams', 'indeed', 'went', 'play', 'Adams', 'father', 'PBS', 'quot', 'Adams', 'Chronicles', 'quot', 'Howard', 'Da', 'Silva', 'playing', 'Franklin', 'just', 'listen', 'original', 'Broadway', 'recording', 'someone', 'else', 'playing', 'Franklin', 'see', 'difference', 'fact', 'Da', 'Silva', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'went', 'play', 'Franklin', 'series', 'quot', 'Bicentennial', 'Minutes', 'quot', '1976', 'Ken', 'Howard', 'pre-', 'quot', 'White', 'Shadow', 'quot', 'days', 'very', 'staid', 'Tom', 'Jefferson.What', 'always', 'nagged', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'how', 'how', 'much', 'material', 'original', 'musical', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'addition', 'VHS', 'version', 'was', 'plagued', 'terrible', 'sound', 'most', 'horrible', 'pan', 'scan', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'speaking', 'certain', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'frame', 'DVD', 'finally', 'most', 'problems', 'restoring', 'several', 'key', 'scenes', 'restored', 'section', 'debate', 'resolution', 'Independence', 'welcome', 'jarring', 'editing', 'original', 'release', 'where', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'Most', 'importantly', 'musical', 'number', 'quot', 'Cool', 'Considerate', 'Men', 'quot', 'very', 'lucidly', 'philosophy', 'anti-independence', 'bloc', 'restored', 'apparently', 'producer', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'caved', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'objections', 'scene', 'Even', 'Nixon', 'beef', 'piece', ""n't"", 'well', 'directed', 'movie', 'bit', 'home', 'viewing', 'context', 'really', 'welcome.Most', 'importantly', 'movie', 'restored', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'pan', 'scan', 'gone', 'most', 'important', 'numbers', 'such', 'quot', 'Egg', 'quot', 'quot', 'Molasses', 'Rum.', 'quot', 'Unfortunately', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'highlights', 'film', 'flaws', 'lighting', 'terrible', 'places', 'soundtrack', 'quality', 'tinny', 'editing', 'very', 'jarring', 'technical', 'flaws', 'are', 'overcome', 'sheer', 'quality', 'performances.Your', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'based', 'solely', 'play', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'hated', 'thinking', 'burlesqued', 'founding', 'fathers', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Franklin', 'was', 'hilarious', 'bawdy', 'man', 'Adams', 'was', 'hot-tempered', 'egotist', 'quot', '1776', 'quot', 'better', 'wooden', 'PBS', 'educational', 'film', 'ever', 'could']",N/A

This hilarious (in a wonderfully dry and witty way) film details in song the (sort-of) history of the fight for independence through the congress as John Adams (played perfectly by William Daniels) undertakes the seemingly impossible task of securing a unanimous vote for the breaking of the yoke of old England.There are some classic songs to be found in the score, from Adams' outrageous demands for independence and Richard Henry Lee's enthusiastic ""Lees of old Virginia"" to the charming ""He plays the Violin"", the romantic ""Till Then"", and the heart-wrenching ""Mama, Look Sharp"".Why four stars instead of five? Personally I think the score has been sung better, and in a musical singing is all-important. Fortunately, the acting is very good, and nearly makes up for it.My favorite scenes are the ones between the strong but intellectually isolated John Adams and his devoted wife Abigail. As I once asked someone, ""Would you rather have a relationship like John and Abigail Adams had, or ... yeah."" At any rate, the actress who plays Abigail sings better than anyone else in the movie, and really puts her heart and soul into it.The acting is great and the songs occasionally wow, but I think the dialog of this film is the most memorable thing, with Benjamin Franklin and John Adams verbal sparring, Jefferson's attempts to escape from the task of writing the declaration, and Washington's abysmal letters to the congress leaving an impression not soon forgotten. Of course the real meat of the film is the debate in the congress (and the personality of the delegates). The depth of the politics and personal feelings of them all are what pull you into the film (and Adams' personal struggle, of course).

12062,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,0767813871,the masked reviewer,"[185, 189]","In April of 1991, Joseph Caporiccio approached his bosses at Pioneer with the idea of letterboxing this lost classic and giving it a true stereo soundtrack for the first time ever. Only mono tracks believed to exist but approval was soon given based on the continued popularity of the previous laser disc release. Director Peter H. Hunt confirmed that the music was recorded in stereo, but its location was anybody's guess. He also informed Mr. Caporiccio of an entire musical number cut after only two preview screenings in New York and Phoenix.""Cool Considerated Men"" was as powerful and entertaining as any song in the film, a personal favorite of the director. But after a negative reaction from the White House regarding the scene's anti-conservative tone, studio executives agreed to remove eight solid minutes. So great was the pressure that the original negative and all known parts of the scene were destroyed. A search began for any version of the missing footage.Meanwhile, the option of using the soundtrack album as a source of stereo music was rejected because of the heavy reverberation added prior to release. Columbia Records later provided access to the original sixteen-track master tapes of the songs, background music and some of the reprises, but unmixed and unbalanced. Complete sound for ""Cool Men"" was located in this massive collection. The final sound for this laserdisc was essentially reassembled from scratch.The movie premiered in 1972, approximately forty minutes shorter than Mr. Hunt's original cut! Legendary producer Jack L. Warner personally supervised a series of cuts intended to accommodate additional showings on daily schedules, a necessity happily irrelevant to home video. The major theatrical release and all previous video releases ran 141 minutes, down from three hours. ""Cool Men"" was among the last cuts made.Columbia graciously released box after box of priceless film and soundtrack from their storage facility in Kansas. The fact that this footage even exists today is a testament to the studio's respect for filmmaking. Amazingly, even small strips running a fraction of a second were preserved. Mr. Caporiccio, assisted by Michael Matessino, poured over this treasure trove of ""lost"" material. Long hours were spent readying the sound note-by-note to match the new transfer.The magnitude of the possibilities became clear after playing a three-channel orchestral tape of ""Piddle, Twiddle and Resolve."" Mr. Caporiccio picked up William Daniel's voice carrying over to the nearby musicians' microphone, singing lyrics that were not in the movie! Recorded and filmed, these additional shots were prime material for inclusion once again. Now he and Michael Matessino stepped up their efforts. Footage was cleaned by hand, color retimed, individual frames repaired.Finally, color ""Cool Men"" footage began arriving in bits. Miracle: a complete set of the excised scenes had secretly been set aside by the editor on the 1972 trimming project! Painstakingly edited and synchronized to the stereo tracks, it is now presented as the director intended all along. In the end only one scene in the film had to be taken from the black-and -white workprint and a five second transitional scene was never found.The restored film on the laserdisc was presented in the widescreen format and remixed for true stereo sound using the original multi-track units (in some cases as many as twenty-four tracks). It contained a total of 40 minutes of footage not seen since the two premiere screenings in 1972, including reconstructed OVERTURE and INTERMISSION music. Other highlights of the Laser Disc version were the full opening credits, newly incorporated character closeups and additional music for several songs. The running time was once again 180 minutes. The 1992 Pioneer Laser Disc Special Edition of 1776 was one of the most ambitious video restorations ever performed.For the 2002 DVD release, the replaced footage has been repaired, giving the DVD a much cleaner look visually than the laserdisc, but the film has been shortened to 166 minutes. The overture and entr'acte music have been removed entirely and the song ""Piddle, Twiddle, and Resolve"" has inexplicably been shorn back down to its original release length. The delightful reprise of ""The Lees of Old Virginia"" has also been completely removed. One minor plus; a short piece of footage following ""Cool, Conservative Men"" has been found and reinserted.",3,Not the Legendary 180 minute 1992 Laser Disc Restoration...here's the

However not only is the film NOT embarrassing, it is likely the best dramatization of the epochal event I have even seen.Yeah they sing but the songs are really dialogue set to musical so actually all the music does is add heightened emotion and import to what is being said.  An incredibly well done film and one of the best films about the American Revolution ever made. The direction by  Peter Hunt is superb. The photography is lush and gorgeous(compare this film with the dreary JOHN ADAMS). The dialogue is incredibly well informed on its subject. Trust me.

You are presented with a 50-yard-line ticket to the difficult politics surrounding the creation of the Declaration of Independence.  Adams, Franklin, and Jefferson - with help from Washington by letter - cajole and browbeat the other representatives of the 13 colonies into cohesion, using some of the exact words taken from historical writings.  BF - ""We must now hang together or we most assuredly will hang separately.""I signed up for this play (1776), complete with period costumes, in a community theatre some years ago - because they needed voices for the men's chorus - and was given the minor part of George Read, delegate from Delaware.

12067,A3S8316WV5J9XS,0767813871,"Tim Michaels ""Tim""","[2, 2]","I saw this movie more than 25 years ago as part of a junior high history class (and, naturally, had quickly forgotten it), but had the pleasant experience of seeing a touring Broadway version of it last year.  Wow!  What an amazing show it was - I doubt there was anyone in the crowd who was not teary-eyed at the end, during the emotional scene where each state/delegate bravely signs the document, risking his life and property, and forever changes the world in ways he could not even imagine.I quickly went out and bought the CD of the wonderful music, but hesitated to buy the film version as I was hoping it would come out on DVD.  Voila!  Here it is (perhaps thanks to Amazon's great feature of allowing you to ""vote"" for an item's release).  I was first in the Amazon checkout line, and was not at all disappointed.William Daniels is superb as John Adams.  I was used to hearing Brent Spiner (Star Trek's Commander Data!) sing this role from my CD of the revival cast, and to my amazement, he did a fantastic job as well.  But it's hard not to think of the kind, gentle Data when listening to him (at least to Trek fans!), which is kind of distracting.  While Daniels seemed familiar to me somehow (and now I know why - Knight Rider and St. Elsewhere), and while he doesn't seem to physically resemble Adams too well, I thought he was quite believable as Adams, and that Howard DaSilva was even more so as Franklin.As for the DVD, it was nice to see some extras, especially the restored scenes (who cares what Nixon thought!) and the (sometimes lame) commentary.  The widescreen angle, I think, makes all the difference given the historical significance of the room where most of the action takes place - it is nice to see the WHOLE room, especially during the very moving scene when the document is read for the first time.  ""We hold these truths to be self-evident...""My complaints with the DVD are few.  The sound, occasionally, seems to be uneven, and even monaural at times, but this may be a result of the once-deleted scenes that were pieced back in.  I do appreciate the conversion to Dolby 5.1, and the few sound lapses are worth it to get the Dolby audio.Also, the screen tests were mostly of the lesser cast, and not much different from the actual scenes in the movie.  Kinda worthless filler.I was a little disappointed with the emotional impact of the final scene, which I thought was done much better in the Broadway version I saw.  Each signer stood around the desk after signing, in a pose that was plucked right out of John Trumbull's famous painting of the event, at which point a huge, see-through backlit silk backdrop of the Declaration was lowered in front of the frozen-in-place signers, with them visible behind it as the Liberty Bell rang triumphantly.  It sent chills right up my back, and was a sure catalyst for a standing ovation.  While I can appreciate how this was probably hard to recreate on screen, and while it is done to some degree, it just didn't seem as effective to me.Minor complaints aside, this is a fantastic movie.  It gives you an awe-struck appreciation for the incredible events that led to  the founding of this nation, and makes you marvel at the fact that it ever happened at all.  So many things could have - and did - go wrong, from Washington's dismal dispatches about the sorry state of his troops to the entire Southern delegation walking out of Congress over the slave issue.  It makes one line in the Declaration, added afterwards, especially prophetic - ""with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence......""Highly recommended to all.",5,A five-goosebump movie that personifies American pride,1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,3614,"['saw', 'movie', 'more', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'part', 'junior', 'high', 'history', 'class', 'naturally', 'had', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'had', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'seeing', 'touring', 'Broadway', 'version', 'last', 'year', 'Wow', 'What', 'amazing', 'show', 'was', 'doubt', 'was', 'anyone', 'crowd', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'teary-eyed', 'end', 'emotional', 'scene', 'where', 'state/delegate', 'bravely', 'signs', 'document', 'risking', 'life', 'property', 'forever', 'world', 'ways', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'imagine.I', 'quickly', 'went', 'bought', 'CD', 'wonderful', 'music', 'hesitated', 'buy', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'Voila', 'Here', 'perhaps', 'thanks', 'Amazon', 'great', 'feature', 'allowing', 'vote', 'item', 'release', 'was', 'first', 'Amazon', 'checkout', 'line', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.William', 'Daniels', 'superb', 'John', 'Adams', 'was', 'used', 'hearing', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Commander', 'Data', 'sing', 'role', 'CD', 'revival', 'cast', 'amazement', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'hard', 'not', 'think', 'kind', 'gentle', 'Data', 'when', 'listening', 'least', 'Trek', 'fans', 'kind', 'distracting', 'Daniels', 'seemed', 'familiar', 'somehow', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'St', 'Elsewhere', ""n't"", 'seem', 'physically', 'resemble', 'Adams', 'too', 'well', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'believable', 'Adams', 'Howard', 'DaSilva', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Franklin.As', 'DVD', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'extras', 'especially', 'restored', 'scenes', 'who', 'what', 'Nixon', 'thought', 'sometimes', 'lame', 'commentary', 'widescreen', 'angle', 'think', 'difference', 'given', 'historical', 'significance', 'room', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'nice', 'see', 'WHOLE', 'room', 'especially', 'very', 'moving', 'scene', 'when', 'document', 'read', 'first', 'time', 'hold', 'truths', 'be', 'self-evident', 'complaints', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'sound', 'occasionally', 'be', 'uneven', 'even', 'monaural', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'once-deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'pieced', 'back', 'do', 'appreciate', 'conversion', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'few', 'sound', 'lapses', 'are', 'worth', 'get', 'Dolby', 'audio.Also', 'screen', 'tests', 'were', 'mostly', 'lesser', 'cast', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'actual', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Kinda', 'worthless', 'filler.I', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'emotional', 'impact', 'final', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Broadway', 'version', 'saw', 'signer', 'stood', 'desk', 'signing', 'pose', 'was', 'plucked', 'right', 'John', 'Trumbull', 'famous', 'painting', 'event', 'point', 'huge', 'see-through', 'backlit', 'silk', 'backdrop', 'Declaration', 'was', 'lowered', 'front', 'frozen-in-place', 'signers', 'visible', 'behind', 'Liberty', 'Bell', 'triumphantly', 'sent', 'chills', 'right', 'back', 'was', 'sure', 'catalyst', 'standing', 'ovation', 'can', 'appreciate', 'how', 'was', 'probably', 'hard', 'recreate', 'screen', 'done', 'degree', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'effective', 'me.Minor', 'complaints', 'aside', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'awe-struck', 'appreciation', 'incredible', 'events', 'led', 'founding', 'nation', 'marvel', 'fact', 'ever', 'happened', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'did', 'go', 'wrong', 'Washington', 'dismal', 'dispatches', 'sorry', 'state', 'troops', 'entire', 'Southern', 'delegation', 'walking', 'Congress', 'slave', 'issue', 'one', 'line', 'Declaration', 'added', 'afterwards', 'especially', 'prophetic', 'firm', 'reliance', 'protection', 'Divine', 'Providence', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Saturen,"[5, 6]","""1776"" is an old favorite for my husband and his family, and no matter how many times I'm made to watch it (or to listen to my husband re-enact it in its entirety), it never gets tiresome. In masterful musical form, ""1776"" presents the passionate debate, political maneuvering, and personal dramas that culminated in the signing of the Declaration of Independence.The musical score contains a wealth of different facets and emotions. The heartrending ""Mama, Look Sharp""--sung beautifully by a teenage courier (Stephen Nathan)--tells of a young soldier calling out to his mother as he dies on the battlefield at Lexington. John and Abigail Adams correspond with one another in the romantic ""Till Then"" and ""Yours, Yours, Yours,"" which contain many of the real words of their letters. ""Molasses to Rum to Slaves,"" which Edward Rutledge (John Cullum) sings very powerfully, points out that Northern cities like Boston profit from the triangle slave trade, whatever moralizing comes out of them. Many of the songs are lighthearted and will tend to get stuck in your head: ""Sit Down, John,"" ""The Lees of Old Virginia,"" ""The Egg,"" and ""But, Mr. Adams.""Although ""1776"" does take a few liberties with the history for the sake of drama (for example, the Declaration wasn't actually signed on July 4), it is mostly accurate, depicting the interesting dynamics of the time. The movie shows the internal disagreements that plagued the Second Continental Congress, such as the desire of the South to maintain its autonomy from a centralized government and the arguments for and against independence. The Restored Director's Cut includes the song ""Cool, Cool, Considerate Men"" (originally taken out at Nixon's behest), which explains the viewpoint of the ""rational,"" conservative opponents of independence. In contrast, the ""obnoxious and disliked"" Adams (played wonderfully by William Daniels) reminds us that America was born through passionately radical ideas, treasonous behavior, and a will that defied prudence and common sense.Also included are some classic Ben Franklin quotes (""We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately"" and ""Those who would sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither liberty nor safety""), in addition to real dispatches from George Washington (who really needed to work on his skill at boosting morale). I also liked the fact that ""1776"" shows the contributions of women like Abigail Adams, who organized other women to make salt peter for the war effort.This is simply a great musical.

""this is a revolution, dammit, we have to offend SOMEONE"" John Adams and Ben Franklin were fascinating people anyway but here they are seen as real people and not the iconic names I learned as a youth. the songs between John and Abigail Adams are almost directly lifted from their letters. Adams: ""I'll not appear in the history books anyway.  Only you.  Franklin did this, Franklin did that, Franklin did some other damn thing.  Franklin smote the ground and out came George Washington fully grown and on his horse.  Franklin then electrified him with his miraculous lightning rod and the three of them, Franklin, Washington and the horse conducted the entire revolution all by themselves""  Franklin: ""I like it""This movie was based on the 1969 Tony award winning musical (awards included Best musical, Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role, Best Book and Best Director).  The original theatre presentation of the 1972 movie was NOT a success, probably due to some of the cuts that Jack Warner and Richard Nixon  (yes, THAT Richard Nixon) insisted on.  Those have been restored in this DVD.GREAT cast.  William Daniels soon after The Graduate and before st. Elsewhere, Ken Howard before White Shadow and many other jobs, Blythe Danner before Gwyneth, James Noble before he played a governor. MANY familiar faces and Broadway favorites including Ronald Holgate repeating his Tony winning role.I first saw this onstage as a senior in high school and it was THIS play that taught me the names of the original thirteen colonies.

I can see why it was dropped, but it's very nice to have it here on this new extended Directors cut DVD.Altho there are several minor inaccuracies (mostly done to cut things down, Sam Adams was conflated into John Adams, his brother for example) it is still a great way of getting people into the Founding Fathers and early American history.For that, it's great for the younger set, altho it is rated PG (slight use of profanity, some adult double-entendres) .

12078,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,0767813871,Zack Davisson,"[0, 2]","&quot;1776&quot; is a solid, fun musical.  The history lesson contained in its story is worthy, and something all Americans should be familiar with.  The songs are catchy, and the historical personages are brought to life admirably.  While it is no &quot;Les Miserables,&quot; it is always worth catching a professional performance.For me, the film version is a little lacking.  Part of it is casting.  William Daniels (John Adams) does an admirable job of the acting, but his singing and dancing is less than stellar.  Virginia Vestoff is a little too pretty and poised as Abigail Adams.  I like her a little more feisty.  Howard Da Silva does good justice to Dr. Benjamin Franklin.  The rest of the cast is able, but not outstanding.  Part of it is the rather dated style of the film.  The costumes, cinematography and lighting are all unfortunately old fashioned, rather than charmingly so as in the case of &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;However, it is good enough.  The story is strong enough to carry the talent.  I always enjoy it every time I watch it.  I am glad to have this DVD version, as &quot;Cool, Considerate Men&quot; is one of the best songs.
