Then came a long wait for the second season to be available in Norway. I got to the point where I was thinking that I rather just order it from Amazon and pay the extra toll, but then the show popped up in the shelf and it was whit much anticipation I took it home to watch it.I was disappointed. Now do not get me wrong, the show was fine. But it was not nearly as good as the first season. Where I whit season 1 had just watched the episodes in quick succession until done, I now watched one now and then. I can not say what makes the first season better, I just think that the stories was better. This is still an above average DVD box though.What is good whit Medium as opposed to the other psychic girl TV shows out there is that it portrays being psychic allot more realistic. That often one have to interpret visions and dreams one get, it often do not come out done like reading a book.I liked the show well enough that I will get season 3. But it could have been better.

The last story was so good.  The stars all got to play different roles and they did a fantastic job.I have to say though that Patricia Arquette's constant whiney delivery gets old very fast.  Whine, whine, whine, when she could just talk.  It makes her seem weak and out of control when that's not who Allison is at all.  I hope she can find another way of conveying upset.The two older girls are good actors, expecially the oldest one.  She's a real beauty and I'm hoping they won't sexualize her.  She plays a young girl, not Britney Spears.  Let her be a kid, please.  The middle daughter has a strange delivery but it works.  Kind of a deep Shirley Temple, facial expressions and all.  My husband says she looks like Sam Kinneson!  They never brush her hair.  She's good though, our favorite.  The youngest hasn't developed a personality yet.I hope this show goes on and on.

The show is mostly convincing with a stellar performance on the part of Ms. Arquette, and most of the supporting cast is excellent. It is unfortunate that the part of Mr. Dubois (who is supposed to be a rocket scientist) is so unsympathetic, and seems to be a bit slow.  Now I am aware that many gifted mathematicians have a missing element socially, but the real Mr. Dubois in interview, does not seem so. However, in ""Sweet Dreams""episode,(ala ""It's a Wonderful Life""), Joe is what you would hope he would be for the rest of the series, so go figure. The children of the show are a mixed bag, but talented child actors are few and far between.The crimes that are solved are not family friendly, but the show is about half about the family dynamic of their unique situation. Which makes for pretty good drama, my reservations notwithstanding.  One of the recurring bad guys in the show is an evil spirit that is the source for psychosis in mentally ill criminals.

1001504,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B000GBEWSO,Joanna Mechlinski,"[3, 3]","Patricia Arquette stars as Allison Dubois, an otherwise ordinary wife and mother who has the ability to help solve crimes through her dreams. Over a series of nights, Allison sees more and more details about the victims, which she shares with her boss, Phoenix District Attorney Manuel Devalos, and detective Lee Scanlon.On the homefront, Allison is accompanied by her laidback husband Joe, a scientist, and their three daughters, Ariel, Bridgette and Marie. The girls are far apart in age -- Ariel in junior high, Bridgette in elementary, and little Marie just a toddler -- giving room to all sorts of growing-up issues.Season 2 includes some fantastic episodes, such as ""Time Out of Mind,"" where Allison dreams she's a woman who's been placed in a mental institution in the 1950s...only to discover there really was such a woman, who claimed to have been Allison Dubois, living in the future. Additionally, both Ariel and Bridgette experience some psychic abilities of their own.Although there are other shows currently on air with extraordinary heroines, ""Medium"" continues to stand apart. Unlike some of the others, such as ""Ghost Whisperer"" starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, ""Medium"" doesn't try to make its cast look superhuman. Dreams aside, Allison's just a busy woman juggling a career and family, and she actually can be seen picking up dry cleaning or wearing old t-shirts as she hurriedly fixes her girls a late supper.Conversely, ""GW""'s Melinda is perfect -- both in appearance and the way her life always goes her way -- which gets stale to the viewing audience pretty quickly. Who can possibly relate? Melinda's husband Jim has virtually no storylines of his own; his entire purpose appears to be supporting Melinda, listening to her prattle on about the cases she's working on, and maintaining the house for her as though he doesn't have a job himself. ""Medium,"" on the other hand, is too smart to insult its viewers by presenting such an improbable universe.If you haven't ever seen ""Medium,"" I urge you to check it out immediately!

1001508,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000GBEWSO,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 5]","Season 2 of ""Medium"" held up the high standard set in the shorter first season.  Patricia Arquette, Jake Weber, Maria Lark, Sophia Vassilieva do excellent jobs involving us in the fairly commonplace dynamics of the family's home life.  This is the center that grounds the series.  Added to that is the psychic ability of Allison Du Bois to see the dead and see the future.  The crime element as she works with Miguel Sandoval as District Attorney Devalos and David Cubitt as Detective Lee Scanlon make for a riveting series with amazing consistency.  In Season 2, David Cubitt's contributions become more thoroughly impressive as his wit and humor come to the fore.  Jake Weber also displays dry wit and exceptional comic timing.  Maria Lark's delightful mugs continue to charm as the young Bridget.  (I want to see Norah Jones' video of ""Sunrise"" in which Lark appears.)Episodes that I enjoy re-watching repeatedly include ""Lucky In Love"" where Allison's brother Michael falls in love with a ghost.  ""Judge, Jury & Executioner"" is exceptionally well written as Allison tries to help the D.A. figure out how a ghost -- a man whose execution they witnessed -- could have committed a murder AFTER he died!  Purely for its ambitiousness, ""Still Life"" that presents a 3-D format is groundbreaking, unlike anything else attempted on TV.The special features are interesting as we learn much of the backstage dynamics that go into producing the series.  This is currently my favorite TV series.  While I am riveted to Season 3, I am delighted to have Seasons 2 & 1 on DVD!  Bravo![Note: On my Disc 6, ""The Darkness Is Light Enough"" will not play.  Instead it goes into the season closer ""Twice Upon A Time,"" which also plays when I press the button for that selection.

1001511,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000GBEWSO,Michael Butts,"[4, 7]","After establishing itself as a very unique series, MEDIUM moves into its second season with 22 episodes, and the continued strong presence of star Patricia Arquette.  Ironically, one of the show's strong points turned into a weak point this season:  the focus on the family problems seemed to override the central ""crime"" part a little too much this season, with Ariel and Bridgit's ""minor crises"" becoming too much like ""Mother Knows Best"".  They included Ariel's falling for a 21 year old in a convenience store and later a 14 year old rich boy, whose doctor father may be a psychotic killer.  Add hubby Joe's problems at work and with his wife's gift, you got a lot of familial focus.  That's admirable in some ways, but it tended to dilute a lot of the more powerful storylines unfolding.  There were some decent chills and some clever plot twists with lurid defense attorney Connor O'Farrell returning for a few episodes, as despicable as ever, and other guest appearances from stars such as Molly Ringwald, David Carradine and David James Elliott.  Arquette's brother Ryan Hurst returns as a possible bank robber; executive producer Kelsey Grammer has a neat turn as the Angel of Death; and sleazy doctor Mark A. Sheppard returns as the psycho who gets doctors to kill their patients.  One strange episode is included with 3-D glasses, and it's storyline is so convoluted, one misses the point and the 3-D effects are far from innovative, they tend to be distractive.But Arquette, Jake Weber and the girls do come across as a strong family and little Maria Lark is a hoot.
