187800,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,1572526300,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[10, 22]","This movie won the Oscar for best foreign film and I see from other reviews that lots of people really love it. Needless to say, my wife and I thought it was not only boring but very silly.Antonia, the eponymous heroine, is a strong-willed woman who moves back to her village after the Second World War with her daughter and builds a kind of feminist alternative universe. She gathers around herself a coterie of kindred spirits. In this fantasy world, good always conquers evil and love conquers all. A central metaphor is the dinner table set up in the farm courtyard -- although we never see what they're eating. probably cabbage and potatoes -- this isn't an Italian movie.Two women get raped but not to worry -- Antonia sets their worlds to rights.Throughout, we are hectored by a boring voice-over declaiming cliches like, ""Days turned into weeks and weeks into months and months into years. Summer turned to autumn and autumn to winter and winter to spring. the earth continued turning, time did its work etc etc etc.""Antonia's daughter decides she wants a child and find a sperm donor to impregnate her. Nine months later Therese is born and grows up to be a mathematical and musical genius. She in turn gives birth to Sarah giving us four generations of strong and independent women living strong independent lives in their strong independent ways.The makeup artists get to practice their art, turning all the characters into old wrecks. Finally, mercifully, Antonia decides it's time to die -- so she shuts her eyes and dies. End of story.

Quirky films can be quite delightful when done well.  However, in this case, the quirkiness comes at the expense of plot and logic.My sense is that this film's director intended Antonia and her line of female descendants to represent strong, fearless heroines imbued with the fighting feminist spirit.  I get this sense because most of the men in this film are brutes, buffoons or a combination of the two, and the women kick butt, make love to each other and tell all of the men off at regular intervals.This film is insulting to anyone who truly values feminist sensibilities in our movie culture.  As so often happens, the makers of this movie equate ""strong"" with callous and emotionally distant.  It's hard to care about Antonia and her relations because they all come across as either vacuous or heinous.  Antonia's daughter casually chooses a complete stranger to impregnate her because she wants a child but doesn't want to have to deal with the father.  Did she ever think  that maybe the child would want a father.  Is selfishness like this supposed to impress me with its strength of character?The script meanders from one incident to the next, characters you barely learn anything about appear and drop out of the movie listlessly, and the pacing of the whole thing is limpid.  The film is only about 110 minutes long but feels much longer.I'm tired of the trend of thinking that propagates the belief that in order to be considered strong, women must prove that they can live entirely without men.  That's such a juvenile attitude and serves no purpose.  Callousness is callousenss whether displayed by a man or a woman, and there's nothing weak about letting leaving yourself vulnerable to the complex relationships that spring between men and women.  Of all the life lessons Antonia supposedly passes down to her ancestors, this is the one she forgot to include.Grade: D+",2,Exasperating,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,2003,"['Antonia', 'Line', 'one', 'movies', 'love', 'own', 'quirkiness', ""n't"", 'always', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'Quirky', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'delightful', 'when', 'done', 'well', 'However', 'case', 'quirkiness', 'expense', 'plot', 'logic.My', 'sense', 'film', 'director', 'intended', 'Antonia', 'line', 'female', 'descendants', 'represent', 'strong', 'fearless', 'heroines', 'imbued', 'fighting', 'feminist', 'spirit', 'get', 'sense', 'most', 'men', 'film', 'are', 'brutes', 'buffoons', 'combination', 'two', 'women', 'kick', 'butt', 'make', 'love', 'other', 'tell', 'men', 'off', 'regular', 'intervals.This', 'film', 'insulting', 'anyone', 'who', 'truly', 'values', 'feminist', 'sensibilities', 'movie', 'culture', 'so', 'often', 'makers', 'movie', 'equate', 'strong', 'callous', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'hard', 'care', 'Antonia', 'relations', 'come', 'vacuous', 'heinous', 'Antonia', 'daughter', 'casually', 'complete', 'stranger', 'impregnate', 'child', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'deal', 'father', 'Did', 'ever', 'think', 'maybe', 'child', 'would', 'want', 'father', 'selfishness', 'supposed', 'impress', 'strength', 'character', 'script', 'meanders', 'one', 'incident', 'next', 'characters', 'barely', 'learn', 'anything', 'appear', 'movie', 'listlessly', 'pacing', 'whole', 'thing', 'limpid', 'film', 'only', 'about', '110', 'minutes', 'long', 'feels', 'much', 'longer.I', ""'m"", 'tired', 'trend', 'thinking', 'belief', 'order', 'be', 'considered', 'strong', 'women', 'must', 'prove', 'can', 'live', 'entirely', 'men', 'juvenile', 'attitude', 'purpose', 'Callousness', 'callousenss', 'displayed', 'man', 'woman', 'nothing', 'weak', 'letting', 'leaving', 'vulnerable', 'complex', 'relationships', 'spring', 'men', 'women', 'life', 'lessons', 'Antonia', 'supposedly', 'down', 'ancestors', 'one', 'forgot', 'include.Grade', 'D+']",N/A

As the years go by, Antonia gathers together a slowly growing extended family that includes some very colorful characters. There are moments of humor, surrealism, and sweet love ... but also moments of ugliness and sadness. Gay audiences will enjoy the matter-of-fact portrayal of a Lesbian couple, and feminists will enjoy the supreme strength of character of Antonia herself. Social conservatives would be advised to look elsewhere; they simply won't understand.

It is definitely a celebration of life, but this celebration sometimes takes such a contrived form at times that it left me with a feeling of ambivilance.Although the movie covers a family over 4 generations, one is left sometimes with the feeling of being suspended in time.  Other than the characters aging, one is left with no sense of the world around these characters ever changing.  The post-war Europe is no more distinguishable than the Europe 30-40 years later.Also, the celebration of family seems diminished by the fact that the men in the family, or the absence thereof, seems to be of no more consequence to the family than whether or not they can grow a palm tree in the front yard.  The men seemed to be little more than cardboard cutouts at time.  That they might have some input in the rearing of the younger generations seems to be an issue not even to be considered, which struck me as odd.  Apologists for this movie will point out the countless movies where women are either absent totally or are nothing more than props.  That is a fair enough point, in and of itself.  However, are the makers of this movie trying to even the score or make a good movie?Also, the outright selfishness that Antonia (with her decision to die) and her daughter (the decision to get pregnant) display made me wonder just how much of these womens' lives should be celebrated.  If they are that self-absorbed, one wonders what they have really learned from life.I didn't hate this movie, but I felt that it could have been so much better.

187808,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1572526300,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 6]","This is an incredibly seductive movie with a strong sense of the spirit of Demeter and Dionysus throughout.  There's no Hollywood glamour here.  Instead we have an unabashed celebration of life (&quot;This is the only dance we dance&quot;) in which love, community and simple hard work prevail.  The simple are seen as the equal of the gifted, and everybody (except for rapists and hypocrites) are appreciated for their strengths and forgiven their faults.  Intellectualism is seen as quaint and unsocial (as in the person of Crooked Finger) possibly leading to a morbid cynicism.  And brain power (as in the person of the prodigy Therese) is just another talent, like being able to laugh or to bale hay or to have lots of children.This is the Dionysian view of life that doesn't allow for Apollo, and there's a lot to be said for it.  But I couldn't help but reflect that during the time span depicted in this movie--five generations in Holland during the twentieth century--Europe experienced some of the most horrific events known to humankind, two world wars, genocide, concentration camps, poison gas, fire bombings, political repression, and the death of millions of people. But perhaps that is director Marleen Gorris's point, to see life at its most elemental, locally and without the horror of war and the delusions of generals and politicians.What's not to like about that?  Well, not to rain on anyone's love-fest, but we have vigilante justice here and a murder, seemingly justified and certainly agreeable to the audience since the victim was a brutal rapist.  Men are not exactly banished, but they are put in their place, serving or (literally) servicing women.  What is banished is orthodox religiosity in the form of a hypocritical cleric who (with his disciples, we are told) goes to town and becomes a social worker (!).This is also an ode to feminism and a deliberate tear-jerker that manipulates the emotions of the audience.  Yet, somehow Gorris, who also wrote the script, manages not to offend my sensitivities.  I think it is because the movie amounts to a very effective sermon against prejudice of any kind, and because of the gentle humanity of her tale.You'll forgive me, however, if I say that my favorite part was the handstand!

187809,AACEZE2YPTJ5D,1572526300,D. Kanigan,"[0, 0]","The 1995 film won the 1996 Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film.  It is described by its director as a ""feminist fairy tale.""  It is set in a rural farming village in the Netherlands (and filmed in Belgium) and covers a span of 40 years beginning after the end of World War II.  Antonia, 40 years old, is a strong minded, strong willed and a fiercely independent woman.  She returns to the place of her birth, a family farm, when  she is called home by her Mother who is about to die.  Antonia raises her teenage daughter Danielle and works a large farm without a husband.  While Antonia and Danielle find the town to be backward in its traditions and customs, they settle in and make a life for themselves - and they begin to leave their mark (a better one) and shape the town by taking in a retarded girl who is raped - taking in a simpleton who is abused by his family and the town children - and be-friend a farmer who is spouseless trying to raise 6 children.  Then the story moves through 2 later generations with Danielle wanting a child (but not a Father) - the birth and development of Danielle's daughter, Therese who is a math and music prodigy - and onward to the birth or Therese's daughter - a cute a charming red head who watches her great grandma leave the earth.The film touches a number of topics including purpose of life and death (a lot on and too much on Death for my taste), religion, sex, love and marriage.  Most of the men in the story are mere appendages or brutes - and there is little understanding of some who play key roles - like Crooked Finger, a family friend (who explains Plato, Nietzsche and Schopenhauer to the young girls) - we don't know who he is, how he became a close family friend - or why he believes humanity is as dark and hopeless as he does.The cinematography is wonderful in this film with the director capturing the beauty of the Belgium landscapes - sunsets over fields and hills - the simple, comforting farm houses and large families gathering around a large wooden table for meals and celebrations - the basic but functional architecture on the town buildings and homes.And a NY Times reviewer captured the essence of the film - ""Strong Women With a Faith in Destiny...While the film rejects and even mocks ideas of organized religion, it has a solid faith in nature and destiny, as well as in the fundamental goodness of its women. It expresses that faith with serene confidence in the cycles of birth, death and replenishment that play out during the story.""",4,Soothing...,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,2527,"['1995', 'film', 'won', '1996', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'described', 'director', 'feminist', 'fairy', 'tale', 'set', 'rural', 'farming', 'village', 'Netherlands', 'filmed', 'Belgium', 'span', '40', 'years', 'beginning', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Antonia', '40', 'years', 'old', 'strong', 'minded', 'strong', 'willed', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'woman', 'place', 'birth', 'family', 'farm', 'when', 'called', 'home', 'Mother', 'who', 'die', 'Antonia', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Danielle', 'large', 'farm', 'husband', 'Antonia', 'Danielle', 'find', 'town', 'be', 'backward', 'traditions', 'customs', 'settle', 'make', 'life', 'begin', 'leave', 'mark', 'better', 'one', 'shape', 'town', 'taking', 'retarded', 'girl', 'who', 'raped', 'taking', 'simpleton', 'who', 'abused', 'family', 'town', 'children', 'be-friend', 'farmer', 'who', 'spouseless', 'trying', 'raise', '6', 'children', 'Then', 'story', '2', 'later', 'generations', 'Danielle', 'wanting', 'child', 'not', 'Father', 'birth', 'development', 'Danielle', 'daughter', 'Therese', 'who', 'math', 'music', 'prodigy', 'onward', 'birth', 'Therese', 'daughter', 'cute', 'charming', 'red', 'head', 'who', 'great', 'grandma', 'leave', 'earth.The', 'film', 'number', 'topics', 'including', 'purpose', 'life', 'death', 'lot', 'too', 'much', 'Death', 'taste', 'religion', 'sex', 'love', 'marriage', 'Most', 'men', 'story', 'are', 'mere', 'appendages', 'little', 'understanding', 'who', 'play', 'key', 'roles', 'Crooked', 'Finger', 'family', 'friend', 'who', 'Plato', 'Nietzsche', 'Schopenhauer', 'young', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'how', 'became', 'close', 'family', 'friend', 'why', 'humanity', 'dark', 'hopeless', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'film', 'director', 'capturing', 'beauty', 'Belgium', 'sunsets', 'fields', 'hills', 'simple', 'comforting', 'farm', 'houses', 'large', 'families', 'gathering', 'large', 'wooden', 'table', 'meals', 'celebrations', 'basic', 'functional', 'architecture', 'town', 'buildings', 'homes.And', 'NY', 'Times', 'reviewer', 'captured', 'essence', 'film', 'Strong', 'Women', 'Faith', 'Destiny', 'film', 'rejects', 'even', 'mocks', 'ideas', 'organized', 'religion', 'solid', 'faith', 'nature', 'destiny', 'as', 'well', 'fundamental', 'goodness', 'women', 'faith', 'serene', 'confidence', 'cycles', 'birth', 'death', 'replenishment', 'out', 'story']",N/A

I remember thinking as I left, how it was movies like this that made the movies so special. How a story could be so simply,  and beautifully told.There is nothing usual in the world of Antonia.  A  single mother, she leaves the city with her young daughter to return to the  small hamlet that was once her home. It is the time of her mother's death,  and Antonia will take over the operation of the now-decrepit farm. She is  ill equipped to run a farm at face, yet her force of will and purity of  spirit make no task impossible. She is a strong woman, a good woman. She  does what has to be done, and uses or finds the necessary tools amongst the  chaos at hand.I believe the English title Antonia's  Line (rather than  Antonia) refers to the line of people she gathers through her life. This  extended family grows from the most unlikely sources. They feast together  outdoors weekly at one long table, and as the movie progresses, the size of  the table grows and grows to accommodate each and every new member in  Antonia's Line.Antonia is a tale of tales, some mysterious and  wonderful, some very basic and also wonderful. And throughout the line  grows as Antonia's extended family encompasses more and more endearing  souls.I was hardly surprised when Antonia won a well-deserved Oscar for  Best Foreign Film.Every time I see this film I find I do not tire of it,  and every time I see it I come away feeling better.",5,One of the truly special film events.,949622400,"02 4, 2000",2000,1521,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'theatre', 'first', 'run', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'remember', 'thinking', 'left', 'how', 'was', 'movies', 'made', 'movies', 'so', 'special', 'How', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'simply', 'beautifully', 'nothing', 'usual', 'world', 'Antonia', 'A', 'single', 'mother', 'city', 'young', 'daughter', 'return', 'small', 'hamlet', 'was', 'once', 'home', 'time', 'mother', 'death', 'Antonia', 'will', 'take', 'over', 'operation', 'now-decrepit', 'farm', 'ill', 'equipped', 'run', 'farm', 'face', 'yet', 'force', 'will', 'purity', 'spirit', 'make', 'task', 'impossible', 'strong', 'woman', 'good', 'woman', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'necessary', 'tools', 'amongst', 'chaos', 'hand.I', 'believe', 'English', 'title', 'Antonia', 'Line', 'rather', 'Antonia', 'refers', 'line', 'people', 'life', 'extended', 'family', 'grows', 'most', 'unlikely', 'sources', 'feast', 'together', 'outdoors', 'weekly', 'one', 'long', 'table', 'movie', 'size', 'table', 'grows', 'grows', 'accommodate', 'new', 'member', 'Antonia', 'Line.Antonia', 'tale', 'tales', 'mysterious', 'wonderful', 'very', 'basic', 'also', 'wonderful', 'line', 'Antonia', 'extended', 'family', 'more', 'more', 'endearing', 'souls.I', 'was', 'hardly', 'surprised', 'when', 'Antonia', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film.Every', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'find', 'do', 'not', 'tire', 'time', 'see', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'better']",N/A

The women rule here, even to the point of deciding to conceive by barter, by compulsion, and by taking arms against the macho power symbols of rape.

Some of the choices, such as Antonia's daughter Danielle deciding that she wants a child if not a husband, seem unusual at first, but the inherent rightness of that choice asserts itself as the story progresses.

This is just quality film; from beginning to end we are swept into the sometimes grand and sometimes pathetic plights of characters with colorful names like Looney Lips (a mentally handicapped farmhand who is rescued by Antonia from a sociopathic pedophile along with his equally challenged sibling), Crooked Finger (a Schopenhauerian philosopher, bibliophile and absolute recluse who descends further and further into depression), and of course Antonia herself, an independent and free spirited woman who wants to give her daughter, Therese, the chance to experience a life of independent choices without the dictates of men.Apparently the feminist sentiments expressed in the film have caused some male viewers to grow embittered and insecure.  It didn't really bother me that much.  The real world is not like this, and nowhere on earth would you find such a politically correct arrangement.  It is a MOVIE, and a great one at that.And Danielle's granddaughter!  An ingenious metaphysician who talks about the existence or non-existence of God with the ill-fated Crooked Finger at age 5, this actress' performance was phenomenal.  Even when she is in the act of giving birth she has a book in her hands.The important quality this possesses is the complete lack of artificiality.  Life is just how it is, with all the ups and downs, and to these natural beings too much thinking is a negation of life (finally given complete expression by Crooked Finger's suicide).  Not the feminism, but this was the only thing that bothered me about the movie: the anti-intellectualism.  Analysis is poison, apparently.This deserved every award it got.

Is she desperately ill? Not apparently. But she's lived life to the full, and now it's time to exit. She rises to begin her last day like any other, gazes out the window, and her life flashbacks for the audience.Shortly after the end of World War II, single-mother Antonia returns to the small, Dutch village of her birth with her teenage daughter, Danielle (Els Dottermans). They arrive just in time to attend the death of Antonia's own widowed mother. Afterwards, mother and daughter take over the family farm, and begin to assimilate into village life. Generation follows generation. Antonia founds a matriarchy, and heads an extended family of neighbors, who periodically gather around her outdoor table for a home-cooked meal to celebrate existence.ANTONIA'S LINE is an earthy, mostly gentle, and occasionally eccentric salute to life - alternately humorous, sad, happy, tragic, dramatic, and poignant. It wouldn't have worked had the setting been urban. And there's a plethora of interesting characters. The Mad Madonna, a woman who howls at the full moon from her second-floor town apartment, and the man downstairs, a Protestant, who's prevented from declaring his adoration for her because she's a Catholic. Deedee, the mentally challenged and sexually abused daughter of a local family who seeks refuge with Antonia, and Loony Lips, the village idiot that loves her. The nihilist Crooked Finger (Mil Seghers), who never goes outside his dwelling, but is Therese's brilliant philosopher-tutor. Boer Bas (Jan Declair), the lonely widower farmer who craves Antonia's companionship.Viewers born and raised in the U.S. may find the film's eminently practical treatment of sex, sin, crime, punishment, and religion startling. This is, after all, a Dutch production. Antonia barely bats an eye when Danielle tells her that she wants a child, but not the man that goes with it. Off the two go to the Big City to find a suitable stud muffin, who ultimately plants the seed during an afternoon's hotel tryst while an imperturbable Antonia waits outside. Meanwhile, the village knows all, takes care of its own, and keeps to itself.It's Antonia around whom everybody else revolves in this pastoral soap opera. Van Ammelrooy is delightful, and the Make-Up Department does a superb job &quot;aging&quot; Antonia from her 30s to 80s. Dottermans has a slightly off-kilter visage that helps to make her Danielle immensely sympathetic. All performances are flawless.My only objection to the plot was the starting point, which was that Antonia found it appropriate and timely to die for no good reason that was explainable. She was in apparent good health, and anchored the support network on whom so many depended. Her leaving almost seemed selfish. However, that said, it's a good trick if you can manage it.

187822,A7ZZQOOYO5L34,1572526300,Libris Vermis,"[3, 14]","Pretentious faux-intellectual chronic-adolescent writer-director Marleen Gorris attempts to create a filmic Matriarchal who-needs-men? Agrarian Utopia (let's just say MAU from here on), populated mostly by Endearingly Quirky residents, plus some males who are tolerably lovable lugs at best, vicious sister-rapers at worst, and in one special case, Misanthropic Hermetic Scholar-Philosopher Who, Unlike The Great Mass Of Us Benighted Lumpen, Sees The Futility Of It All And Finally (but not nearly soon enough)Opts Out.  The MAU is presided over by All-Wise Earth Matriarch (think I'm over-doing the capital letters?  Just watch the DVD), much given to cliche'd aphorisms, who has returned with her teen-aged daughter to the village of her birth shortly following WWII, there to assume the family farm (parents & other relatives having mysteriously disappeared - especially grandmother!) and create afore-mentioned MAU where all is excruciatingly diverse, tolerant, nurturing, communal, agrarian, and correct.Matriarch also sires line of remarkable female progeny - ""Antonia's Line"":  Daughter, the vision-prone Artist, who decides she wants a child but not a husband, thereby siring granddaughter Theresa, girl genius, and later, Artist (of musical persuasion), who eventually permits moony, adoring childhood (male) friend to seed her (Ms Gorris is coy about their marital status), thereby producing great-granddaughter, enigmatic & stunning copper-headed woman-child, and, undoubtedly, future Artist.  We might suppose that Great-Granddaughter is a Celtic cuckoo in the nest except the girls are all Cuckoos, husbands being sooo last-millenium.  Matriarch also demonstrates her nurturing goodness by sporadically adopting about a half-dozen stray cats of the 2-legged variety, and so as the years fall away like autumn leaves, or some such triteism (there were so many I couldn't keep track), the Peaceable Kingdom grows, which we witness by the artful & original device of the extended-family meal which is always taken outdoors on a sturdy & elegantly weathered table which seems to grow with the commune (and in spite of perpetually gloomy skies, it never seems to rain at mealtime in MAU).As everyone knows, Mother Nature favors virtuous matriarchal non-mechanistic muscle-powered communal agrarianism, and so rewards the MAUists with a life-long ruddy vigor - unlike the rest of us, they seem impervious to the slings & arrows of advancing age (with the exception of one of the males who is killed in a tractor accident, and that was surely intended as an cautionary tale).  Seemingly every third scene had the MAUists engaged in communal fence-raising or dirt-digging (or Matriarch scattering seeds from a large basket resting securely on one of her generous pre-raphaelite hips - a practice sure to provoke guffaws among real farmers).  After the fifth or six such scene I had my own vision - of a bored-to-tears editor sneaking in the Annoying Peasant scene from Monty Python's Holy Grail (`elp! `elp! Oi'm bein' repressed!).Ms Gorris wants us to know she's no blue-sky dreamer; for example, she does not grant her characters immortality, and in fact the film starts at the end with Matriarch having decided that it's time for ""the miracle of death"" and sensibly making arrangements.  But Gorris hasn't much patience for these mundanities and dispenses with most of them in a single short scene (including the afore-mentioned tractor accident).  And so with this circle-of-life bit and yet another voice-over lecture from the adult great-granddaughter (who we don't get to see, alas! - by itself this could have redeemed the preceding ninety-some minutes), the film limps to a close.Analysis is difficult when there is little to analyse, and even that little is as subtle as a battering ram; so let's just look at a few representative samples and the reader can either take my word that they are typical, or, if she has absolutely nothing else to do with ninety minutes, watch the DVD and let us know if I've erred:Endearingly Quirky Characters 1 & 2 - Catholic Mad Madonna who howls at the full moon every 28 days, and her uptight Protestant downstairs (male) neighbor who thumps the ceiling with a broomstick during her lupine episodes, AND they carry this on for forty years, AND  are in love but can't mutually requite because of their differences of faith.  Who'd have thought that the rural Netherlands - in a country where prostitution is legal - still lives by these Medieval mores?  Why didn't Matriarch clasp these unfortunates to the bosom of MAU, where they could have left their hang-ups at the gate?After deciding she wants to be a mother too, Daughter matter-of-factly goes shopping for a stud.  Mais oui.  The scene concludes with a heart-warming bit of post-coital arm-in-arm skipping-through-the-meadow female bonding.  However, Daughter's Magical Realist visions disappear for no reason that I could see after little Grand-daughter's prodigious gifts are revealed.  Maybe Gorris's special effects budget had been depleted.After early on demonstrating that she's a walking calculator/encyclopedia and giving pseudo-math lectures while still a teen, girl-genius grand-daughter opts instead (mais oui!) to be a composer, that is, an Artist.  A few hours' research would be enough to convince most anyone but the Marleen Gorris's of the world that while many mathematicians are musical, there has as yet been only a single math genius who was also a celebrated composer (and alas, he was a male, and also seriously avant-garde - Greece's Yannis Xenakis).  It appears that the genetic codings for musical genius & mathematical genius are mutually exclusive; but then I suppose all things are possible for a female born into a well-managed MAU, including use of your Music School's auditorium for the composing of elevator music and possibly MAU film scores(I & my music school colleagues, both male & female, made do in 4x5 practice rooms and they wouldn't have been even that large if smaller pianos had been available).Grand-daughter is also raped by the previously mentioned sister-raper who absented the village for some 15 years after plucky Daughter un-manned him with a pitch fork (or so we thought, and so it would've been anywhere but in Gorris World).  He returns a uniformed thug, the sly insinuation being that the armed forces welcome such to their ranks.  Grandmother Matriarch (not mother, curiously) takes up a shotgun and forces him out of the village pub and into the square, but then decides that dispensing with the miscreant is beneath her station and instead curses him roundly.  Now there is a fair amount of anthropological literature about how curses in primitive societies depend on the curser making the cursee believe absolutely in the potency of the curse.  If kept in gloatingly thuggish character, sister-raper would not have believed at all; would in fact have been hard pressed not to have laughed in Matriarch's face, shotgun or no.  But this is Gorris World and she can do as she pleases.  At any rate, the dirty work is left to the boys, with SR's brother finishing him off in a rain barrel (but not without Gorris suggesting that brother's motives were less than noble, or even retributive).We mustn't neglect Mr. Crooked Finger.  Unaccountably in a math genius, Granddaughter, who Gorris was at some pains to have as a well-rounded genius and no gear-head idiot-savant, mais oui, early on takes a shine to this most pseudo of all pseudo-intellectuals, the gloomy scholar & philosopher.  But again, why wasn't Mr. Too Good For This World persuaded to join MAU?  Perhaps Gorris felt that a little gratuitous gravitas was needed to balance all the gratuitous quirkiness.Finally, we should consider the place of the Artist in low-energy, low-industrial agrarian economies: There is none, at least not in enlightened non-oppressive cultures where the luxuries of the few can't be gotten on the backs of hordes of impoverished peons, as was the case in the good old days.  Wide-spread Art, especially Art-sans-Religion, is maybe the surest indicator of a wealthy, industrialized, and democratic society.  Low-energy, low-industrial societies simply can't generate enough excess wealth to support unproductive classes.  The Gorris's of the world would do well to read a few actual histories of life in the good old days, such as Fernand Braudel's ""The Structures of Everyday Life""(in the 15th Century).  Among other things, she might discover that farm workers of the day were paid partly in grog, an indispensible anesthetic, so brutal were the working conditions.  The fantasy of a low-energy agrarian economy, be it small-communal or national, which can support non-productive classes is too widely believed to lay exclusively at Ms Gorris's doorstep, but since it undergirds her implicit economic argument I mention it in passing.But perhaps I missed the point.  Maybe Antonia's Line was really a clever experiment is sociology: Load a script with every extant fatuous politically-correct cliche', over-load it in fact; relentlessly hammer the life-affirming agrarianism trope to the point of slapstick; slather on the quirky; give the whole mess a thick coat of Artist-as-cultural-nadir varnish, count the snickers and other reactions, feed it all into a computer and see if any cultural trends emerge.Fail.  Almost nobody snickered.  Critics & audiences actually cheered; it won awards.""Eh?"", says the puzzled sociologist, ""We must be witnessing the death of satire.""",1,Put a minus sign in front of the 1-star,1296691200,"02 3,

Anyway, yes, I think this can be considered more of a woman's picture.  Certainly the strongest characters in it are Antonia and her descendents.Whatever, this is enjoyable.  It is a rather quirky film with lots of odd characters.  And it does switch back and forth between comedy and suddenly serious things like rape, murder, suicide.  But it's done so skillfully, that it sweeps a person along with it.  At least, that's my experience with this film.The plot didn't sound real exciting, about a woman and her grown daughter returning to a Dutch village to take over a farm.

The story revolves around Antonia and her daughter Danielle who migrate to a remote Dutch village after the end of the World War. Their interaction with the village folks, neighbors and the ensuing social bond is the primary premise of the movie.Antonia is a strong, but humble person who is a picture of strength and fortitude. She is the matriarch of the family and her presence inspires strength and comfort in all the people around her. She lived and died gracefully. Interestingly, she chooses her time to die. This is a very thought provoking point: Can we mortal humans ever know the right time to die? Should the selection of the time to die be controlled by us or by nature?Danielle is a free spirited and independent woman who chooses to raise a daughter without a father. This brings forth an interesting point about relationships. Do we need to bond with other people to lead a real meaningful life? Do we need presence of other people in our lives to be complete ourselves?Another interesting character is called ""Crooked Finger"", who is extremely erudite (physics and mathematics) and a philosopher at heart. He is always grappling with conundrums like ""Why are we born?"", ""Why do people choose to live a life of misery instead of opting for death?"" and many others. He eventually puts an end to his own misery by committing suicide.There are numerous other interesting characters in the movie and all of them have their own little interesting stories. The characters seem a little contrived, but fit well into the overall premise of the movie.The movie is well layered with many thought provoking themes and questions.
