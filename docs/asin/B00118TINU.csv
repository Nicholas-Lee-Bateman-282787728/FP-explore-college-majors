1130782,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B00118TINU,Kona,"[12, 12]","Step back to a kindler, gentler time and enjoy three 1950s Liberace shows plus a short tribute to Mardi Gras (complete with spectators in suits and ties, dresses and gloves).  This is early Liberace, dashing in white tie and tails, performing pieces from the classics to ragtime, blues to boogie-woogie.  When he gazed lovingly into the camera, he seemed to be looking at you alone, and his legions of female fans either swooned over him or wanted to adopt him (I was a swooner).His piano playing is flawless and dramatic and he was a very good singer, too.  The mix of boyish enthusiasm and suave charm made him irresistible and as I watched him again, I felt the years melt away and fell under his spell again.  He's just adorable, that's all, and he brought his beautiful music to many who would never be able to attend a concert in person.On one show, he introduces his mother, sister, and sisters-in-law - and even his dog - but it's all done sweetly and respectfully.  This is not the campy Las Vegas clown he became in his later years, but an exceptionally talented and appealing entertainer sharing his love for the piano.  Highly recommended for his fans.",5,"""I'll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing youuuuuuuu.""",1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1164,"['Step', 'back', 'kindler', 'gentler', 'time', 'enjoy', 'three', '1950s', 'Liberace', 'shows', 'short', 'tribute', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'complete', 'spectators', 'suits', 'ties', 'dresses', 'gloves', 'early', 'Liberace', 'dashing', 'white', 'tie', 'tails', 'performing', 'pieces', 'classics', 'ragtime', 'blues', 'boogie-woogie', 'When', 'gazed', 'lovingly', 'camera', 'seemed', 'be', 'looking', 'alone', 'legions', 'female', 'fans', 'swooned', 'wanted', 'adopt', 'was', 'swooner', 'piano', 'playing', 'flawless', 'dramatic', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'singer', 'too', 'mix', 'boyish', 'enthusiasm', 'suave', 'charm', 'made', 'irresistible', 'watched', 'again', 'felt', 'years', 'melt', 'away', 'fell', 'spell', 'again', 'just', 'adorable', 'brought', 'beautiful', 'music', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'attend', 'concert', 'person.On', 'one', 'show', 'mother', 'sister', 'sisters-in-law', 'even', 'dog', 'done', 'sweetly', 'respectfully', 'not', 'campy', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'clown', 'became', 'later', 'years', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'appealing', 'entertainer', 'sharing', 'love', 'piano', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans']",N/A
