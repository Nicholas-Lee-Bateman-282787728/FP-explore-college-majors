The whole &#34;creepy neighbor&#34; thing came on too strong, too quickly. That took mountains of suspense away from the general thematic. At that point, which was far too soon in the movie, all the characters began acting in a way no one would ever act, given the situation.2. Far too many questions and suspended reasoning throughout.3. The director didn't seem to know what to do with the two daughters. Why in the world would one of the daughters choose to be with some strange old guy, killing her father, quite brutally, I might add, in the process? There was no back-story to that. Had she been molested? Had she been mistreated? That was never apparent. In fact, the most I could gather was that the father was a GOOD father, which makes her actions even more puzzling.4. Moreover, why in the world would there be three other girls--all quite beautiful--under the spell of this lunatic old guy? What power did he have over them? Was he drugging them? What were their stories to have such rare and diverse outcomes? It just made absolutely no sense, whatsoever.5. Then we find out--in some kind of supposed twist/shocker--that there are more than three girls. There is a whole harem full of them. Once again, WHY? Why? Why? Why? The answer could have lent a entirely new and exciting layer to the story.6. The actors, outside of David Arquette, who was like a wooden spoon from start to finish, were commendable with the minimally constructed script they were given. It was clear that they were trying to use facial expression and body language to convey some of the elements the script should have channeled.I gave two stars for the acting chops of the two sisters, Morissa and Alana O'Mara.

1553751,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008I34ZDE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 9]","I like David Arquette and he is certainly the best thing about ""The Cottage,"" but that's about the only endorsement that I can give this low-budget chiller. The story at the heart of this film might have been creepy and provocative had it been explored with any sort of depth, but the end result is more cheesy and comical than scary or disturbing. I love that the DVD cover proudly proclaims that ""The Cottage"" is ""based on a harrowing true story"" because the screenplay is about as far from plausible as you can imagine. That still might have been OK if the sordid tale had not taken itself so seriously. With a bit more humor, this might have been redeemed as campy fun. But as is, it's just another ""thriller"" that is completely dependent on every character making the dumbest choices possible at every moment. And with so little thought to writing identifiable protagonists, I didn't much care what evil fate befell this rather lifeless brood.""The Cottage"" starts with a surreal scene of violence that raises one's initial expectations. But after this brief moment of intrigue, the main story initiates and it will be a LONG while before anything exciting happens again. We are introduced to an ordinary family looking to sublet the guest house in their back yard. Kristen Dalton and Victor Brown are the rather bland parents and their two teenage girls are unnecessarily creepy. One is a rebellious troublemaker and one is a shy do-gooder, but neither seem particularly realistic. Enter Arquette as a potential tenant. He is so over-the-top as the perfect candidate, you know he'll only bring doom and destruction. There is little mystery to his evil intentions (but they aren't explicitly stated) and a shocking revelation will surprise you only if you aren't paying attention or have never watched a movie before. Along the way, the family becomes increasingly suspicious of Arquette but never do anything sensible. Some peripheral characters are introduced only to have more potential victims, but they are handled so sloppily as to be laughable.When we finally get to the big finale, at least ""The Cottage"" goes big. It's ridiculous but sometimes amusing. If the rest of the movie had committed to the lunacy of these final scenes, it might have been more entertaining. Not good, necessarily, but more entertaining. Arquette seems to be having a good time, and maybe that's enough. ""The Cottage"" is one of those movies that you find on cable in the middle of the night and end up watching. For free (or as a cheap rental), it might pass the time. But it is not a movie that would stand up to repeated viewings. At only 88 minutes, the first hour is glacially slow. There's some life at the end, however silly and overwrought, but it's a struggle to get there.

After the tenant that Chloe (Dalton) and Michael have set for their cottage falls through romance novelist Robert (Arquette) answers the ad. After meeting him the family thinks they have the perfect person to move in and are excited. But like most things in life some things are too good to be true. This is true in all genres but I think that casting in horror movies has a lot to do with how creeped out you get watching. I have always wanted to write a ""Silence Of The Lambs"" type movie starring Roma Downey (from Touched By An Angel), to me that would be creepy just because of who she is. Most people know David Arquette has a comedic actor in movie like ""Eight Legged Freaks"" and ""See Spot Run"" which is why he comes off so creepy in this. He gives a very laid back performance and the movie has the same vibe as ""Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" or ""Fear"". The movie itself isn't that original and if it weren't for Arquette it would be forgettable, but his performance gives the film the extra dimension it needs to make it genuinely creepy and very watchable. He took the movie from an OK made-for-TV movie to an entertaining movie movie just by who he is. That is hard to do. Overall, an OK movie made much better by the casting of Arquette. I give it a B+.",4,"Has the feel of ""Hand That Rocks The Cradle"". Movie is OK, but worth watching for Arquette, very creepy in this.
