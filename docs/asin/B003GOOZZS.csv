The actors seemed like they were forcing the script, so I am thinking that the script was just badly written.  It did seem that the script was very rushed.  All-in-all, it was pretty badly directed and written with amateur acting at best.",2,Not good...,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,340,"['acting', 'not', 'good', 'not', 'horrible', 'college', 'level', 'movie', 'not', 'professional', 'actors', 'seemed', 'were', 'forcing', 'script', 'am', 'thinking', 'script', 'was', 'just', 'badly', 'written', 'did', 'seem', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'rushed', 'All-in-all', 'was', 'pretty', 'badly', 'directed', 'written', 'amateur', 'acting', 'best']",N/A

1345416,A387BD735MI50R,B003GOOZZS,R. Schultz,"[4, 5]","This movie is not to be confused with the 2007 French-language movie by the same name. The two are not related.This movie looks as if it was made by the struggling cinema industry of some Slavic country several decades ago - perhaps a 1950's Moldavian production. Well, the action is supposed to be taking place in an underground bunker after a future plague has decimated most of the earth's life forms. However, this movie abuses the privilege that such a theme would grant it to look dim and dingy. This movie goes all the way to being nearly unwatchable.What's more, the acting is terrible. Although many of the featured players have turned in notable performances in a variety of TV series and other movies - here they melt right into the indie Moldavia look. Their performances are stilted, stagey, and marked by long, awkward pauses in which they seem to be struggling to remember their next lines.The only reason to check out this DVD is for its bonus commentary. Ray Bradbury briefly participates, since the film is based on his early ""Chrysalis"" short story. His approval of this film does pose a mystery though.  How could he recognize some faults with the generally engrossing movies made of his classic stories ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""The Illustrated Man"" - and yet so thoroughly approve this creaky venture? Well, a clue to his attitude comes in some of the first remarks he makes in the commentary. He acknowledges how the young producers/directors of this film avowed their love for him, and he says ""How can anyone reject someone who says they love you?""Of course, that's been done. But Bradbury is apparently too gallant and heartfelt to go that route. His sane humanism shines through this gloom. He also says that, as far as what emerges from the chrysalis, the big movie houses wanted to turn his material into another ""monster on the loose"" tale. These indie producers he finally granted the rights to were at least steadfast in keeping the plot close to his original, lower-key intentions.In any case, this movie certainly won't in and of itself make you a Bradbury fan. But it's so bad, it might impel you to go to the source to find out why so many earnest attempts have been made to translate his stories to film. I wasn't able to immediately find the ""S is for Space"" collection that includes this first ""Chrysalis"" story. (He also entitled a later story ""Chrysalis,"" but that one had a somewhat different theme.) However, I did go back to his ""October Country"" collection which had been languishing on my shelves for some time. I also got a copy of ""Twice Twenty-Two - The Golden Apples of the Sun."" So some good did come out of getting this movie. It led me back to Bradbury's original genius.Once again, the best advice is to ""read the book.""",2,Dull and Dingy,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,2770,"['movie', 'not', 'be', 'confused', '2007', 'French-language', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'related.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'struggling', 'cinema', 'industry', 'Slavic', 'country', 'several', 'decades', 'perhaps', '1950', 'Moldavian', 'production', 'Well', 'action', 'supposed', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'underground', 'bunker', 'future', 'plague', 'decimated', 'most', 'earth', 'life', 'forms', 'However', 'movie', 'privilege', 'theme', 'would', 'grant', 'look', 'dim', 'dingy', 'movie', 'way', 'being', 'nearly', 'unwatchable.What', 'more', 'acting', 'terrible', 'many', 'featured', 'players', 'have', 'turned', 'notable', 'performances', 'variety', 'TV', 'series', 'other', 'movies', 'here', 'melt', 'right', 'indie', 'Moldavia', 'look', 'performances', 'are', 'stilted', 'stagey', 'marked', 'long', 'awkward', 'pauses', 'seem', 'be', 'struggling', 'remember', 'next', 'lines.The', 'only', 'reason', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'briefly', 'participates', 'film', 'based', 'early', 'Chrysalis', 'short', 'story', 'approval', 'film', 'pose', 'mystery', 'How', 'could', 'recognize', 'faults', 'generally', 'engrossing', 'movies', 'made', 'classic', 'stories', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'Illustrated', 'Man', 'yet', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'approve', 'creaky', 'venture', 'Well', 'clue', 'attitude', 'first', 'remarks', 'commentary', 'how', 'young', 'producers/directors', 'film', 'avowed', 'love', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'reject', 'someone', 'who', 'love', 'course', 'been', 'done', 'Bradbury', 'apparently', 'too', 'gallant', 'heartfelt', 'go', 'route', 'sane', 'humanism', 'gloom', 'also', 'that', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'chrysalis', 'big', 'movie', 'houses', 'wanted', 'turn', 'material', 'monster', 'loose', 'tale', 'indie', 'producers', 'finally', 'granted', 'rights', 'were', 'least', 'steadfast', 'keeping', 'plot', 'close', 'original', 'lower-key', 'intentions.In', 'case', 'movie', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'Bradbury', 'fan', 'so', 'bad', 'might', 'impel', 'go', 'source', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'earnest', 'attempts', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'translate', 'stories', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'immediately', 'find', 'S', 'Space', 'collection', 'first', 'Chrysalis', 'story', 'also', 'entitled', 'later', 'story', 'Chrysalis', 'one', 'had', 'somewhat', 'different', 'theme', 'However', 'did', 'go', 'back', 'October', 'Country', 'collection', 'had', 'been', 'languishing', 'shelves', 'time', 'also', 'got', 'copy', 'Twice', 'Twenty-Two', 'Golden', 'Apples', 'Sun', 'good', 'did', 'come', 'getting', 'movie', 'led', 'back', 'Bradbury', 'original', 'genius.Once', 'again', 'best', 'advice', 'read', 'book']",N/A
