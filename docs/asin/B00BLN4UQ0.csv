That Jack sure was a lucky guy to have her in his corner. &#34;Mick Mick....Speak English!&#34; and &#34;I'm a little black woman in a big silver box&#34; are two of my favorite lines from the movie. Jumpin' Jack Flash has many laughs, fun, and adventures in it. If you're not a fan of Whoopi Goldberg  I think you will be after you see this movie.

1635392,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B00BLN4UQ0,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[5, 5]","This movie as far as I am concerned is a classic and captures Whoopi Goldberg at her comedic best.  Her timing and responses as a bank teller thrown into the spy world of cloak and dagger is both hysterical and makes for a good adventure.  In addition, this film also portrays the first aspects of instant messaging and online communications.  Lastly, if I am not mistaken, I believe this is Penny Marshall's directional debut in motion pictures.  Therefore why only a three star rating?This DVD produced by Anchor Bay is rather disappointing.  There is absolutely nil in the form of special features, no trailer/preview for this feature (any other films), no documentaries and no commentary, which honestly wouldn't bother me if the DVD itself had a menu screen.  When you put the disk in the DVD player a screen pops up and states if subtitles are desired to hit the ""subtitle"" button on your remote control.  When the movie begins it does have a rather clear widescreen presentation, but coming from a company like Anchor Bay this is rather second-rate.I can recall becoming very excited when some of my favorite obscure films would be released by Anchor Bay.  Mainly because Anchor Bay usually pulls out the stops on their DVD releases, extra features, trailers, radio spots, interviews, etc. This 2013 DVD release is abysmal. Nevertheless, I am happy to have this great movie on DVD and will be keeping it in my collection.  However, Anchor Bay really needs be ashamed of themselves about this release.
