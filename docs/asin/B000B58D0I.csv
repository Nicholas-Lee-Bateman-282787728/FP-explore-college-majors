935748,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B000B58D0I,Allen Chapman,"[15, 16]","For me the best part of American Idol is watching the horrible audtions at the start of each season. These poor souls actually believe they have what it takes to make it to the big time. The sad part is they REALLY believe they can make it, sometimes they have family members who encourage them. Some say that these have to be fakes, people can't be this bad. Well they can be, they can't be that good of actors!!This DVD has some of the best worst performances from the first four seasons. You get William Hung, you get that guy singing ""Like A Virgin"", you get my personal favorite, Mary Roach. You've got to credit these people for at least having the guts to get up there and try.Now for the part that's not so great about this set. Many of the songs have been cut, I would guess because they couldn't get the rights to them. By cutting out the songs, you don't really get to see why they are being so harshly judged. So the judges come off as being rude for no real reason.Aside from that, this DVD is great fun. But again how many of us would have the guts to get up there ourselves??",4,THIS is the best of American Idol!!!,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,1090,"['best', 'part', 'American', 'Idol', 'watching', 'horrible', 'audtions', 'start', 'season', 'poor', 'souls', 'actually', 'believe', 'have', 'what', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'sad', 'part', 'REALLY', 'believe', 'can', 'make', 'sometimes', 'have', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'encourage', 'say', 'have', 'be', 'fakes', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'actors', 'DVD', 'best', 'worst', 'performances', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'get', 'William', 'Hung', 'get', 'guy', 'singing', 'Virgin', 'get', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Mary', 'Roach', ""'ve"", 'got', 'credit', 'people', 'least', 'having', 'guts', 'get', 'up', 'there', 'try.Now', 'part', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'set', 'Many', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'would', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'rights', 'cutting', 'out', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'see', 'why', 'are', 'being', 'so', 'harshly', 'judged', 'judges', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'rude', 'real', 'reason.Aside', 'DVD', 'great', 'fun', 'again', 'how', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'guts', 'get', 'up', 'there']",N/A

But we always wait at the beginning of the year to watch the auditions hoping that we would laugh so hard at the singers' performances (Love that William Hung audition). And we did. Just a few months ago, though, Fox was airing an AI program called the ""World's Worst Auditions"", which lasted only an hour. As of today now, I've heard that they are going to release a ""worst of"" DVD that has TWO AND A HALF hours worth of material!

935750,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000B58D0I,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[12, 14]","This is the ""Worst of American Idol"" and they've certainly put it together. If you just can't help looking at those crazy, wacky people who come on to this show (and yes, I can't help), then you'll love this DVD.This DVD has everything you could want as far as that goes. You get the full auditions or arguments of such people as Tamika (It's TA-MEE-KA! TA-*MEE*-KA!) Bush, Adam and Dirk, William Hung and more. Oh yes, there's William Hung. You'll get his entire audition, never shown before as well as full-on performance with accompanying music and girl dancers. You'll also get crazy medlies of Christmas songs, America the Beautiful, fashion faux pas and more.A lot of the content is presented in an approximately hour long highlight reel, with some commentary by Paula Abdul. But the really ""good"" stuff, as described above, is in separate Special Features.The main problem with this DVD is that the ""Worst of American Idol"" seems to be packaged with the worst of DVD problems. There is no scene selection on the highlights reel, so you're stuck trying to find your spot. There are no close-captions or subtitles either. I mean --- I can't say I entirely blame them, a lot of this stuff really is indecipherable, but even trying could have helped. There are some bad audio problems on a couple of the earlier segments also. The worst thing is that every time you pop in the DVD, you have to sit through three copyright / logo displays, followed by an intro that's about a minute long from Paula. I couldn't get this to either skip or fast forward.P.S. --- I don't know why so many people are saying that you just get some padded show or whatever. Yes, there *is* a clips show with this, but there's a whole bunch of special feature segments with unedited and complete auditions and/or arguments.So overall --- I like this DVD, but I really have to mark down because of the described problems, which don't have *anything* to do with the content.",3,More Like 3 1/2  Stars --- Annoying DVD Problems Bog Down Content,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1950,"['Worst', 'American', 'Idol', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'put', 'together', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'looking', 'crazy', 'wacky', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'show', 'yes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'DVD.This', 'DVD', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'as', 'far', 'get', 'full', 'auditions', 'arguments', 'such', 'people', 'Tamika', 'TA-MEE-KA', 'TA-*MEE*-KA', 'Bush', 'Adam', 'Dirk', 'William', 'Hung', 'more', 'Oh', 'yes', 'William', 'Hung', ""'ll"", 'get', 'entire', 'audition', 'never', 'shown', 'as', 'well', 'full-on', 'performance', 'accompanying', 'music', 'girl', 'dancers', ""'ll"", 'also', 'get', 'crazy', 'medlies', 'Christmas', 'songs', 'America', 'Beautiful', 'fashion', 'faux', 'pas', 'more.A', 'lot', 'content', 'presented', 'approximately', 'hour', 'long', 'highlight', 'reel', 'commentary', 'Paula', 'Abdul', 'really', 'good', 'stuff', 'described', 'separate', 'Special', 'Features.The', 'main', 'problem', 'DVD', 'Worst', 'American', 'Idol', 'be', 'packaged', 'worst', 'DVD', 'problems', 'scene', 'selection', 'highlights', 'reel', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'trying', 'find', 'spot', 'are', 'close-captions', 'subtitles', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'entirely', 'blame', 'lot', 'stuff', 'really', 'indecipherable', 'even', 'trying', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'are', 'bad', 'audio', 'problems', 'couple', 'earlier', 'segments', 'also', 'worst', 'thing', 'time', 'pop', 'DVD', 'have', 'sit', 'three', 'copyright', '/', 'logo', 'displays', 'followed', 'intro', 'minute', 'long', 'Paula', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'skip', 'fast', 'forward.P.S', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'just', 'get', 'padded', 'show', 'Yes', 'clips', 'show', 'whole', 'bunch', 'special', 'feature', 'segments', 'unedited', 'complete', 'auditions', 'and/or', 'arguments.So', 'overall', 'like', 'DVD', 'really', 'have', 'mark', 'down', 'described', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '*anything*', 'do', 'content']",N/A
