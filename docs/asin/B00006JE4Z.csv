The acting is great and the casting worked perfectly with the characters.Bobbie (Rachel Ward) is struggling to deal with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer and who finds out that she's the guardian of her orphaned nephew. Bailey (Bernadette Peters) is her partner who does some major maturing as she copes with a new ""son"" and Bobbie's cancer. Jonathan Silverman is fantastic as Bailey's brother. Thomas Sangster is devastating as Alan, Bobbie's nephew.The story is wonderful - neither promoting nor defending sexual preferences. It doesn't need to. When faced with tough situations we are all reduced to the same emotions and that's the focus of the film.",5,Powerful and moving story.,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,767,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'intensity', 'power', 'story', 'acting', 'great', 'casting', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'characters.Bobbie', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'struggling', 'deal', 'recent', 'diagnosis', 'breast', 'cancer', 'who', 'out', 'guardian', 'orphaned', 'nephew', 'Bailey', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'partner', 'who', 'major', 'maturing', 'new', 'son', 'Bobbie', 'cancer', 'Jonathan', 'Silverman', 'fantastic', 'Bailey', 'brother', 'Thomas', 'Sangster', 'devastating', 'Alan', 'Bobbie', 'nephew.The', 'story', 'wonderful', 'promoting', 'defending', 'sexual', 'preferences', ""n't"", 'need', 'When', 'faced', 'tough', 'situations', 'are', 'reduced', 'same', 'emotions', 'focus', 'film']",N/A
