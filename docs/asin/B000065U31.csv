I have rarely seen a movie that can deal with so many issues, including death, from so many ageless perspectives, be so uplifting, healing, and interesting - all at once. The movie never slows up or drags at any point (keeping even action / adventure buffs watching in my household).There are a number of issues dealt with including first impressions, family problems, communications and death - from many angles and they were able to do it in such a way that the interpetation is left open for personal viewpoints, and without leaving open ends dangling or skipping over anything.Plus this is a feel good movie. It's still a drama, but there are many comedic moments, suspense and it ends very satisfyingly. That's not an easy thing to do dealing with the subject matter of death, but it's an important reason why I liked this movie so much and why I will continue to watch it.Where was this movie?

700071,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000065U31,B. E Jackson,"[0, 2]","A Rumor of Angels isn't quite what the reviews will lead you to believe.  It's pretty mediocre, in fact.  It's about a young boy who meets an old British lady that's quite strange at first.I mean, at first she spies on the boy when he breaks into her home, she then sneaks up on the boy slowly but doesn't punish him for his actions, then they work out an agreement to fix up and paint the old womans fence, then while outside, she smacks the boy across the face for disrespecting his stepmother in front of her, and then to REALLY make things totally weird, when the old lady and the boy start painting the fence, the old lady pretends that she's flying like a bird.  Talk about a totally bizarre woman.  All these character changes happen in the beginning of the movie.Later on we discover some pretty sad segments involving a car wreck and a blocked off road.  Easily the most touching moment of the entire film.Alright, I need to say something that's been bugging me for years.There's one segment where the boy is sitting outside on the front porch and asks his father about his dead mother, and the father just gives him bad looks and walks away.  I personally think it's extremely rude when a parent simply walks away from their child without even realizing that it took a LOT of courage for the child to ask such personal questions concerning someone they loved dearly.  I don't understand why a parent would ever just straight up IGNORE them like that.  I mean gee whiz- their own son or daughter is EXACTLY the person to discuss a deceased relative with!  When a parent ignores a personal question from their own child, now the child is probably feeling ashamed for even bringing it up in addition to the sadness of the death he/she is already experiencing.  It's a lose/lose situation.  That's why I hate the way movie writers portray these type of segments.  It's wrong.  A real parent would take a moment to comfort their child.  I'm really tired of the false portrayal.Of course there's also the matter of this particular segment being predictable and cliched because I've seen it in countless other films.  This is another aspect of the movie that fails to leave a lasting impression on me.Overall, a Rumor of Angels is sort of overrated here on amazon.  It's okay but doesn't blow me away.  The storytelling is fairly basic and the old lady's bizarre personality is really the main drawing point here.",3,hmmm...,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,2416,"['Rumor', 'Angels', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'reviews', 'will', 'lead', 'believe', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'fact', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'old', 'British', 'lady', 'quite', 'strange', 'first.I', 'mean', 'first', 'boy', 'when', 'home', 'then', 'up', 'boy', 'slowly', ""n't"", 'punish', 'actions', 'then', 'work', 'out', 'agreement', 'fix', 'up', 'paint', 'old', 'womans', 'fence', 'then', 'outside', 'boy', 'face', 'disrespecting', 'stepmother', 'front', 'then', 'REALLY', 'make', 'things', 'totally', 'weird', 'when', 'old', 'lady', 'boy', 'start', 'painting', 'fence', 'old', 'lady', 'flying', 'bird', 'Talk', 'totally', 'bizarre', 'woman', 'character', 'changes', 'happen', 'beginning', 'movie.Later', 'discover', 'pretty', 'sad', 'segments', 'involving', 'car', 'wreck', 'blocked', 'off', 'road', 'Easily', 'most', 'touching', 'moment', 'entire', 'film.Alright', 'need', 'say', 'something', 'been', 'bugging', 'one', 'segment', 'where', 'boy', 'sitting', 'front', 'porch', 'father', 'dead', 'mother', 'father', 'just', 'bad', 'looks', 'walks', 'away', 'personally', 'think', 'extremely', 'rude', 'when', 'parent', 'simply', 'walks', 'away', 'child', 'even', 'realizing', 'took', 'LOT', 'courage', 'child', 'ask', 'such', 'personal', 'questions', 'concerning', 'someone', 'loved', 'dearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'parent', 'would', 'ever', 'just', 'straight', 'up', 'IGNORE', 'mean', 'gee', 'whiz-', 'own', 'son', 'daughter', 'EXACTLY', 'person', 'discuss', 'deceased', 'relative', 'When', 'parent', 'personal', 'question', 'own', 'child', 'now', 'child', 'probably', 'feeling', 'ashamed', 'even', 'bringing', 'up', 'addition', 'sadness', 'death', 'he/she', 'already', 'experiencing', 'lose/lose', 'situation', 'why', 'hate', 'way', 'movie', 'writers', 'portray', 'type', 'segments', 'wrong', 'real', 'parent', 'would', 'take', 'moment', 'comfort', 'child', ""'m"", 'really', 'tired', 'false', 'portrayal.Of', 'course', 'also', 'matter', 'particular', 'segment', 'being', 'predictable', 'cliched', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'other', 'films', 'aspect', 'movie', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'me.Overall', 'Rumor', 'Angels', 'sort', 'overrated', 'here', 'amazon', 'okay', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'storytelling', 'fairly', 'basic', 'old', 'lady', 'bizarre', 'personality', 'really', 'main', 'drawing', 'point', 'here']",N/A

Here is a story so simple yet so rich that it should be viewed by a much larger audience.  Yes, Vanessa Redgrave fans will of course pick up the DVD on the merits of her enormous gifts as an actress.  Or perhaps word of mouth will spread the news that someone cared enough to make a life-affirming film in the midst of all the action/implosion noisemakers.  Very simply, the film is based on a book 'Messages from a Soldier to his Mother' that opens the window to the concept of what happens to us when we die.  The journal kept by Redgraves' character ( Maddy Bennett, a gnarly old woman who is a loner but sensitively in touch with her take on this world and the one after) is eventually shared with an emotionally devastated boy of 12 to help him accept his mother's accidental death, a death for which he feels responsible.  It all works well as a story without becoming maudlin, due in no small part to director Peter O'Fallon and his sterling cast.  Not only does this damaged child find solace about the question of death, his wonderfully colorful mentor Maddy teaches him about music, about living, about forgiving.  The musical score is beautifully enhancing in the form of Mozart (Symphony No. 39, a two piano sonata, and the exquisite choral Ave Verum Corpus).  The physical settings are magnificent, the camera work, set dressing, editing, and of course the luminous gifts of actor Vanessa Redgrave all make this a film worth seeing and owning.

700078,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000065U31,Reviewer,"[20, 21]","Youth and guilt can be a potent combination, especially in the wake of a tragic accident, when they come together to manifest responsibility where there is none; imagined or real, fault precipitates inordinate guilt that can weigh a person down.  And such a burden is hard for anyone to carry, but can be especially devastating if the individual in question is young and blameless, the very situation examined by director Peter O'Fallen in ""A Rumor of Angels,"" the heartfelt drama of a boy emotionally disabled by the memory of the car wreck that claimed the life of his mother, and who now bears the guilt of survival, amplified by the passing of time and self-incrimination.  It's a bitter pill, better left in the bottle; but without solace, a task easier said than done.For some two years, young James Neubauer (Trevor Morgan) has struggled with the loss of his mother, and a contrary attitude born of self-reproach has created a seemingly unbridgeable chasm between him and his father, Nathan (Roy Liotta), who is often away on business, and the relationship he has with his stepmother, Mary (Catherine McCormack), is tentative at best.  His real problem, though, lies in the fact that he is simply unable to express the feelings of darkness that have since the accident encroached upon his soul.  Of those around him, he seems able to relate only to Nathan's younger brother, his Uncle Charlie (Ron Livingston); it's something, but not nearly enough.His life takes a turn, however, when circumstances bring him into contact with an eccentric old woman, Maddy Bennett (Vanessa Redgrave), who lives alone in an old house by the sea.  Something from her past strikes a chord that produces a bond between them, and Maddy's insights into life and loss soon begin to have an effect on James.  But Maddy has ways and ideas that to some are strange; and conflict arises when Nathan gets wind of the relationship that has formed between his son and Maddy, and when, for better or worse, he determines to see it stopped.As a storyteller, O'Fallen has a nice touch; he wastes no time in getting right to the heart of the drama, moving it all along even as he is setting it up.  It's an effective approach, in that it puts you in the story very quickly and allows for some reflective moments without retarding the pace or development of the characters or the story.  And the way he inserts ""flashes"" of flashbacks to the accident throughout the film gives the viewer some real insight into what's going on in James' head.  It's not a revolutionary technique, by any means, but O'Fallen knows how to use it well, and to great effect.  He provides the action with a sense of real time, which makes the relationship between Maddy and James convincing as it develops, and as this is the pivotal aspect of the film, it makes it credible and believable.  This is a story of two unlikely people finding and making an impact on one another's lives, and O'Fallen does a good job of avoiding the maudlin sentimentality to which such a story could be predisposed.  And he does it by tempering the sentiment with real emotion, rather than resorting to melodrama to sell it, which O'Fallen obviously realized would have been entirely ineffective.  Instead, he takes the high-- albeit harder-- road, and keeps it real, which in turn takes the film to a higher level.  O'Fallen has a discerning eye and the capacity to understand human nature, as well as the ability to translate it convincingly to the screen.Young Trevor Morgan came into this project with an impressive resume that includes such films as ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Patriot,"" ""Jurassic Park 3"" and ""The Glass House,"" and he has obviously prospered artistically from his experience, which he indicates with his work here.  Morgan's portrayal of this conflicted young man is mature, and he resoundingly captures James' attitude and state of mind in terms that are real and convincing.  To make the film work, Morgan has to convey emotions that, due to his particular situation, must transcend the typical complexities of youth; and he succeeds in doing so.  He also develops his character honestly, as evidenced by the manner in which his relationship with Maddy proceeds.  It's a solid performance, with a quality that is natural and altogether affecting.The highlight of the film, however, is the performance turned in by Vanessa Redgrave, as Maddy.  With this portrayal, Redgrave creates a character that is the very affirmation of the joys of life, as her Maddy fervently embraces it in all it's myriad aspects, running the full gamut of emotions as she does so.  This is a role that allows Redgrave to break loose and give herself over totally to the character, and she immerses herself in Maddy, this unique individual to whom reality is but a canvas upon which she may impose her own version of it, while keeping her own counsel and living as she will.  It's a vibrant performance, touching and poignant and alive, and arguably one of her best in a long, long time.  This is work that is truly ""Redgrave,"" which attests to her endless capacity and talent as an actor, including her ability to so profoundly touch her audience.Liotta, McCormack and especially Livingston are effective in their respective roles, as well, offering strong support to Redgrave and Morgan, who are clearly the stars of the show.  In retrospect, though, it's the strength of one performance that adds  to the strength of another, transferring and sharing as it does a collective energy that insures the success of this film.The supporting cast also includes George Coe (Dr. Jenkins) and Michelle Grace (Lillian).  A film that will make you feel, as well as think, ""A Rumor of Angels"" is satisfying entertainment that encourages you to take pause and take stock of the things that are truly important.",5,Insightful Drama from Peter O'Fallen,1026864000,"07 17, 2002",2002,5826,"['Youth', 'guilt', 'can', 'be', 'potent', 'combination', 'especially', 'wake', 'tragic', 'accident', 'when',

700079,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000065U31,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","A Rumor of Angels (Peter O'Fallon, 2000)What a surprising little film this was. I went into it knowing nothing about it other than that it features the winsome Catherine McCormack, with whom I am infatuated beyond all reason, and came out of it realizing I'd been hopelessly maipulated, and didn't care a whit.The story revolves around a widow, Maddy Bennett (Vanessa Redgrave), and a young boy, James Neubauer (The Prizewinner of Defiance, Ohio's Trevor Morgan). James, whose father Nathan (Ray Liotta) is distant, and who hates his stepmother (McCormack), forms an unlikely solidarity with the old woman after he trespasses on her property and gets scared off when she shoots rock salt at him. The two of them form a friendship fueled by James' fascination with Maddy's stories of her son, who died in the Vietnam war, and who Maddy is convinced sent her Morse code signals after his death telling her that he was at peace and looking down on her from Heaven. His parents, of course, are not thrilled.This is not a blockbuster by any standards; it's small, quiet, reflective. As such, it was thoroughly overlooked at the box office, playing on just seven screens and grossing something in the vicinity of thirty-one thousand dollars during its two-week run.

He meets Maddie played by Vanessa Redgrave whom he forms a friendship with. She has had a loss of her own and through their relationship they I think heal each other and form a lasting bond. The other characters in the movie Uncle Charlie, James father, and stepmother Mary are all good supporting characters and really show the communication problems and how the family is struggling. The ending is kind of heartwarming, sad, and at the same time kind of unbelievable. At the end Maddie dies but after she sends a special message to James. I wanted them to go on being friends but I think I can see what kind of message the director was trying to send about love,grief, and death. It is a tearjerker!

Though it`s quite a tear-jerker at times, there is so much beauty in the movie. Shots of the landscape are brilliant and create wonderful moods, the soundtrack is selected beautifully. Of course, the acting of Vanessa Redgrave is wonderful, but in all those previous reviews I can`t find a word about the amazing acting-job Trevor Morgan did here. His roles in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;The glass house&quot; were always too small - here he is the star of this movie. His face displays the feelings, the many different moods this 12 year old boy is going through so perfectly. He simply is amazing!
