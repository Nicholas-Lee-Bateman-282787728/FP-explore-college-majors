1318954,A1MKU8G30ILWB9,B0032LV4KY,homeschoolmom,"[22, 37]","I was disappointed in the movie for 3 very important reasons:1.  Adoption was not shone in a favorable light.  This bothered my 5-year old daughter who is adopted.  She wondered why somebody who can't have children would not want to adopt.  The movie makes you feel like adoption is ""not the same"" as having a biological child.  I have both.  Let me assure everyone that adoption is every bit as special as having a child biologically.  I understand that the male star of this movie does indeed come around to being willing to accept an adopted child, but to a young child such as my own, the quick reference at the end that adoption is okay, did not register with her after the bigger movie scene where adoption is not favorable.2.  The man takes God's name in vain.3.  If you are a strong Christian (not Catholic) this movie is not for you.  It has way too many Catholic beliefs such as the power of saints.  As for me and my house, I want my children to grow up putting their faith in their creator and His son, not someone that others have deemed a saint.  I had to discuss the errors of this movie with my children.  I wish I never would have watched it with them.It has a cute storyline, so if you don't care about adoption, taking God's name in vain, or teaching non-Biblical principles, then you will think this movie is cute.",1,A disappointed Christian,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,1334,"['was', 'disappointed', 'movie', '3', 'very', 'important', 'reasons:1', 'Adoption', 'was', 'not', 'shone', 'favorable', 'light', 'bothered', '5-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'adopted', 'wondered', 'why', 'somebody', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'adopt', 'movie', 'feel', 'adoption', 'not', 'same', 'having', 'biological', 'child', 'have', 'Let', 'assure', 'everyone', 'adoption', 'bit', 'as', 'special', 'having', 'child', 'biologically', 'understand', 'male', 'star', 'movie', 'indeed', 'come', 'being', 'willing', 'accept', 'adopted', 'child', 'young', 'child', 'such', 'own', 'quick', 'reference', 'end', 'adoption', 'okay', 'did', 'not', 'register', 'bigger', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'adoption', 'not', 'favorable.2', 'man', 'God', 'name', 'vain.3', 'are', 'strong', 'Christian', 'not', 'Catholic', 'movie', 'not', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'Catholic', 'beliefs', 'such', 'power', 'saints', 'house', 'want', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'putting', 'faith', 'creator', 'son', 'not', 'someone', 'others', 'have', 'deemed', 'saint', 'had', 'discuss', 'errors', 'movie', 'children', 'wish', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'them.It', 'cute', 'storyline', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'adoption', 'taking', 'God', 'name', 'vain', 'teaching', 'non-Biblical', 'principles', 'then', 'will', 'think', 'movie', 'cute']",Expecting a Miracle

1318960,AOKIJQEO2DDNM,B0032LV4KY,Little ol me,"[1, 2]","Although this movie has a lot of big name actors, and they are normally pretty good in other films/shows, their acting was not up to par in this one. There wasn't a flow to it, they weren't convincingly portraying their charactes and they didn't mesh with each other.  This movie really felt like they were trying too hard to make it a good movie.  The movie was middle of the road in both storyline and acting.  The story went in many directions and often left some things out that might have contributed to the flow of the story.  The plot is pretty easily figured out quite early along in the movie.  The overall theme is taking life slowly and enjoying the moment and what you have.The main couple are having a hard and disappointing time getting pregnant.  They each blame themselves, and sometimes each other, until they are at the breaking point.  They take a vacation during which along the way they break down and never reach their final destination.  However, it is the time they spend in this sleepy little town that brings them closer together in the end.  The title ""Expecting a Miracle"" comes from the yearly celebration of the St. who grants miracles and the little boy who thinks it is his turn to receive that miracle.The movie didnt really impress me.  Cheech was not cast as a funny comedian, but in a more serious role this time. The story took forever to unfold and there were too  many unrealistic and obvious things happening which detracted from the storyline.  The movie dabbles with infertility, pregnancy, getting pregnant, having children, adoption, etc.  There is also discussion of miracles taking place and a child relying on a miracle of his own so that he can walk normal again.As far as having a clean movie to watch without the language and sex, this one will fit the bill.",3,Short of a Miracle,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1808,"['movie', 'lot', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'are', 'normally', 'pretty', 'good', 'other', 'films/shows', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'flow', 'were', ""n't"", 'convincingly', 'portraying', 'charactes', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'other', 'movie', 'really', 'felt', 'were', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'middle', 'road', 'storyline', 'acting', 'story', 'went', 'many', 'directions', 'often', 'left', 'things', 'out', 'might', 'have', 'contributed', 'flow', 'story', 'plot', 'pretty', 'easily', 'figured', 'out', 'quite', 'early', 'along', 'movie', 'overall', 'theme', 'taking', 'life', 'slowly', 'enjoying', 'moment', 'what', 'have.The', 'main', 'couple', 'are', 'having', 'hard', 'disappointing', 'time', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'blame', 'sometimes', 'other', 'are', 'breaking', 'point', 'take', 'vacation', 'way', 'break', 'down', 'never', 'reach', 'final', 'destination', 'However', 'time', 'spend', 'sleepy', 'little', 'town', 'closer', 'together', 'end', 'title', 'Expecting', 'Miracle', 'yearly', 'celebration', 'St.', 'who', 'miracles', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'turn', 'receive', 'miracle.The', 'movie', 'didnt', 'really', 'impress', 'Cheech', 'was', 'not', 'cast', 'funny', 'comedian', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'time', 'story', 'took', 'forever', 'unfold', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'unrealistic', 'obvious', 'things', 'happening', 'detracted', 'storyline', 'movie', 'infertility', 'pregnancy', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'having', 'children', 'adoption', 'etc', 'also', 'discussion', 'miracles', 'taking', 'place', 'child', 'relying', 'miracle', 'own', 'so', 'can', 'walk', 'normal', 'again.As', 'far', 'having', 'clean', 'movie', 'watch', 'language', 'sex', 'one', 'will', 'fit', 'bill']",Expecting a Miracle

Jason Priestley and Teri Polo play a Los Angeles couple in their late 30s whose marriage becomes strained when they are unable to have children. Accepting an offer from his engineering boss to take a week at his time-share in Mexico, they get stranded in the tiny village of Dommatina, where they get involved in a festival honoring the local saint. Cheech Marin plays the Catholic priest who organizes the annual festival.Like most Hallmark TV films, this movie is a feel-good program romanticizing the goodness of people and the intervention of God in their lives, sometimes excessively so. These people don't live in the real world, but in a strange paradise where everyone is kind and generous to fellow human beings, and all the usual cliches are in evidence.
