748647,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00008WJD6,A Customer,"[0, 4]","Summary:Tom Leezak (Ashton Kutcher) is a two-bit Polish traffic reporter working the graveyard shift at a local radio station.  But when he meets and falls in love with Sarah McNerney (Brittany Murphy), whose father is ultra rich, trouble is inevitableThe movie actually begins as Tom and Sarah return from their honeymoon in Europe.  They are literally doing their best to kill each other as they walk through the airport.  In an attempt to adjust back to normal life, Tom finds his way to his microphone at the radio station and, despite the urgings of his show producer, can't help but ponder why his marriage has fallen apart on air.  He then proceeds to recount the entire relationship, from hitting Sarah in the face with a football (how they met), to their disastrous honeymoon (which is the majority of the movie), and finally to his decision to talk things over with his father.As far as the honeymoon goes, it quickly dissolved to near chaotic levels when Tom's unwillingness to embrace all things wealthy and European clashed with Sarah's silver-spoon upbringing. To make matters worse, Sarah's former boyfriend and the man slated by her father to marry her, Peter Prentiss (Christian Kane), shows up and just happens to be staying in their same hotel.  The jealousy and incompatibilities result in a night spent together in jail and the airport scene outlined above.But before the marriage can end, both Tom and Sarah realize (1) why they got married in the first place and (2) that marriages aren't always blissful.  Tom is finally able to convince both Sarah and her family that he really is the perfect person for her.My Comments:I put off seeing this movie for a long time because I don't like either of the principle actors.  Seeing this movie didn't change my opinion of their acting abilities.The story is pretty much a rehash of a classic plot device - rich person meets poor person, they fall in love, then realize that their different backgrounds make things difficult.  The movie is actually a pretty good incarnation of that plot.  The only problem I had with the story is that it is annoyingly out of order as it starts about 2/3 of the way (chronologically) through Tom and Sarah's story; but even so, it isn't hard to figure out what is going on.  Otherwise, the story doesn't have any major jumps in logic.  Everything that happens seems to make sense, belying a well-written script.Where the movie goes wrong is in employing the two actors that it did.  I must admit, Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy really are perfect for each other, but this is only because they can only play one character type - a ditz.  But ditz + ditz doesn't make for characters that can carry a movie.  And this is definitely the case with Just Married.  Yes, there are a few humorous scenes, but invariably they are the result of the situation in which the two characters find themselves and not because Kutcher and Murphy have the comedic talent to pull off a romantic comedy.  I laughed when I saw the car.  The dildo in the socket was funny.  And telling the customs agent that Tom had marijuana stuffed up his bottom was pretty good, but for the most part these are built-in jokes that would have worked if the characters were cartoons or even amoebas (think The Far Side).Though I've probably already said enough about the acting, I have to say just one more thing: Does Brittany Murphy's smile/laugh bother anyone else?  Watch it closely next time you see it and you'll see what I mean.  She never closes her mouth and there is a slight delay before every laugh.  It's almost as if she has to convince herself to do it and she's surprised rather than entertained.  Anyway, I shouldn't mock other people's ticks, but after nearly two hours of this, I was just itching to put my hand under her chin and pry her mouth closed.Overall, this movie actually had potential even though the basic plot idea isn't novel.  The script is heavily laden with easy jokes, but the actors employed for this cake walk amazingly couldn't make it from point A to point B, even with the clear cut directions.  I think this is a movie you could enjoy better by reading the script than by watching the poor portrayal that is the final product.  It may make you laugh, but is it worth putting up with Kutcher and Murphy for the occasional chuckle?  I don't think so.",2,Occasionally funny despite the two main actors,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,4355,"['Summary', 'Tom', 'Leezak', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'two-bit', 'Polish', 'traffic', 'reporter', 'working', 'graveyard', 'shift', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'when', 'love', 'Sarah', 'McNerney', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'father', 'ultra', 'rich', 'trouble', 'inevitableThe', 'movie', 'actually', 'Tom', 'Sarah', 'return', 'honeymoon', 'Europe', 'are', 'literally', 'doing', 'best', 'kill', 'other', 'walk', 'airport', 'attempt', 'adjust', 'back', 'normal', 'life', 'Tom', 'way', 'microphone', 'radio', 'station', 'urgings', 'show', 'producer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ponder', 'why', 'marriage', 'fallen', 'apart', 'air', 'then', 'recount', 'entire', 'relationship', 'hitting', 'Sarah', 'face', 'football', 'how', 'met', 'disastrous', 'honeymoon', 'majority', 'movie', 'finally', 'decision', 'talk', 'things', 'father.As', 'far', 'honeymoon', 'quickly', 'dissolved', 'chaotic', 'levels', 'when', 'Tom', 'unwillingness', 'embrace', 'things', 'wealthy', 'European', 'clashed', 'Sarah', 'silver-spoon', 'upbringing', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Sarah', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'man', 'slated', 'father', 'marry', 'Peter', 'Prentiss', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'up', 'just', 'happens', 'be', 'staying', 'same', 'hotel', 'jealousy', 'incompatibilities', 'result', 'night', 'spent', 'together', 'jail', 'airport', 'scene', 'outlined', 'above.But', 'marriage', 'can', 'end', 'Tom', 'Sarah', 'realize', '1', 'why', 'got', 'married', 'first', 'place', '2', 'marriages', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'blissful', 'Tom', 'finally', 'able', 'convince', 'Sarah', 'family', 'really', 'perfect', 'person', 'her.My', 'Comments', 'put', 'off', 'seeing', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'principle', 'actors', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'opinion', 'acting', 'abilities.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'rehash', 'classic', 'plot', 'device', 'rich', 'person', 'meets', 'poor', 'person', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'realize', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'make', 'things', 'difficult', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'incarnation', 'plot', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'story', 'annoyingly', 'order', '2/3', 'way', 'chronologically', 'Tom', 'Sarah', 'story', 'even', 'so', ""n't"", 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'Otherwise', 'story', ""n't"", 'have', 'major', 'jumps', 'logic', 'Everything', 'make', 'sense', 'belying', 'well-written', 'script.Where', 'movie', 'wrong', 'employing', 'two', 'actors', 'did', 'must', 'admit', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'really', 'are', 'perfect', 'other', 'only', 'can', 'only', 'play', 'one', 'character', 'type', 'ditz', 'ditz', '+', 'ditz', ""n't"", 'make', 'characters', 'can', 'carry', 'movie', 'definitely', 'case', 'Just', 'Married', 'Yes', 'are', 'few', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'invariably', 'are', 'result', 'situation', 'two', 'characters', 'find', 'not', 'Kutcher', 'Murphy', 'have', 'comedic', 'talent', 'pull', 'off', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'laughed', 'when', 'saw', 'car', 'dildo', 'socket', 'was', 'funny', 'telling', 'customs', 'agent', 'Tom', 'had', 'marijuana', 'stuffed', 'up', 'bottom', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'built-in', 'jokes', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'characters', 'were', 'cartoons', 'even', 'amoebas', 'think', 'Far', 'Side', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'already', 'said', 'enough', 'acting', 'have', 'say', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'Does', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'smile/laugh', 'bother', 'anyone', 'else', 'Watch', 'closely', 'next', 'time', 'see', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'never', 'mouth', 'slight', 'delay', 'laugh', 'almost', 'convince', 'do', 'surprised', 'rather', 'entertained', 'Anyway', 'should', ""n't"", 'mock', 'other', 'people', 'ticks', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'just', 'itching', 'put', 'hand', 'chin', 'pry', 'mouth', 'closed.Overall', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'potential', 'even', 'basic', 'plot', 'idea', ""n't"", 'novel', 'script', 'heavily', 'laden', 'easy', 'jokes', 'actors', 'employed', 'cake', 'walk', 'amazingly', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'even', 'clear', 'cut', 'directions', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'enjoy', 'better', 'reading', 'script', 'watching', 'poor', 'portrayal', 'final', 'product', 'may', 'make', 'laugh', 'worth', 'putting', 'up', 'Kutcher', 'Murphy', 'occasional', 'chuckle', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so']",Just Married

They make me want to be in love and marry the person because their love is so contagious. I saw a father-daughter theme, which reminds me of the relationship I have with my dad. I love that she is close to her family, but I don't like a lot of her siblings because they are arrogant and annoying. But I love the conversation she has with her mum about her fiance 'cause it shows that she is in love with him. It also shows that she's close to her mum. Out of her siblings, the only one I like is the one with glasses (he looks like a nerd). One amazing scene to look out for is when they go sight-seeing and lots of birds attack Ashton's character while she is reading. I love the song they play in that scene 'cause it's so beautiful. I love the guy that plays Ashton's character's dad 'cause he reminds me of my dad. He is so wonderful! As I stated in my review for The Best Man about American arrogance, it is also evident in this film (Just Married) when they go to Europe and damage one of the sockets (Ashton's character), not that I'm on the side of the Europeans. It just makes sense to pay for the damages you cause.

748651,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00008WJD6,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","The problem with `Just Married' has nothing to do with charisma or chemistry, which is something that both Brittany Murphy (RIP) and Ashton Kutcher had in spades in this film (and most of their films for that matter).  In fact, it is their chemistry and charisma (which oozes in parts) that keeps the film afloat (mostly).  No, the problem with `Just Married' is that it just doesn't work.  It tries way too hard to be something that it just cannot be; funny.  I hate it when films `push' things to a point of no return, and that is what happens here.  There is no rebounding for the film because it doesn't know when to quit trying.  Instead, the film is just a barrage of gags that don't work and overused clich&eacute;s that have been done better elsewhere.  Thankfully Murphy and Kutcher know how to have some fun with the script and so the save the attention spans of the innocent audience by making the movie partially palatable; but at the end of the day this is all stuff we've seen handled better elsewhere, and the plot ultimately goes in directions that are frustratingly unauthentic and entirely ridiculous.  This is just another one of those forgettable romantic comedies that get churned out with reckless abandon.  It's too bad, because the talent was there (especially in Murphy, who really was worth more than she was ever able to show).",2,Eh...,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1354,"['problem', 'Just', 'Married', 'nothing', 'do', 'charisma', 'chemistry', 'something', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'RIP', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'had', 'spades', 'film', 'most', 'films', 'matter', 'fact', 'chemistry', 'charisma', 'parts', 'film', 'afloat', 'mostly', 'No', 'problem', 'Just', 'Married', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'something', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'funny', 'hate', 'when', 'films', 'push', 'things', 'point', 'return', 'what', 'here', 'rebounding', 'film', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'quit', 'trying', 'Instead', 'film', 'just', 'barrage', 'gags', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'overused', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'elsewhere', 'Thankfully', 'Murphy', 'Kutcher', 'know', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'script', 'so', 'save', 'attention', 'spans', 'innocent', 'audience', 'making', 'movie', 'partially', 'palatable', 'end', 'day', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'handled', 'better', 'elsewhere', 'plot', 'ultimately', 'directions', 'are', 'frustratingly', 'unauthentic', 'entirely', 'ridiculous', 'just', 'one', 'forgettable', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'get', 'churned', 'out', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'too', 'bad', 'talent', 'was', 'there', 'especially', 'Murphy', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'more', 'was', 'ever', 'able', 'show']",Just Married

Vegan,"[2, 5]","Tom & Sarah (Ashton Kutcher & Brittany Murphy) meet, fall in love and get married, all within nine months..against the wishes of Sarah's friends and family.  For their honeymoon, they decide to go to Europe.  Right from the time the board the airplane, they have problems.  While on the plane, they decide to become members of the 'mile high club'.  Nothing goes right and they end up breaking the hostess' nose.  When they arrive at their posh hotel in France, Tom forces a plug for a sex toy into the electrical outlet and destroys the wiring.  This incident gets them kicked out of the hotel where they have to spend the night inside their very compact car.  The real trouble begins when they separate to see different things while in Venice.  Peter Prentice, Sarah's ex, is conveniently staying at the same hotel as the happy couple.  He finds out that they have gone separate ways for a time and pursues her.  Meanwhile, Tom heads to a bar where the Dodgers game is being broadcast and a cute yet ditzy American girl immediately wants to hook up with him. Instead of doing the gentlemanly thing by immediately telling her that he's married, he allows it to fester into a very compromising situation. Tempers flare, conflict ensues and the couple's first premonition is to call it quits.  It's a hilarious, yet romantic comedy that you'll want to watch over and over.",4,"Funny, romantic movie.",1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,1371,"['Tom', 'Sarah', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'get', 'married', 'nine', 'wishes', 'Sarah', 'friends', 'family', 'honeymoon', 'decide', 'go', 'Europe', 'Right', 'time', 'board', 'airplane', 'have', 'problems', 'plane', 'decide', 'become', 'members', ""'mile"", 'high', 'club', 'Nothing', 'right', 'end', 'up', 'breaking', 'hostess', 'nose', 'When', 'arrive', 'posh', 'hotel', 'France', 'Tom', 'plug', 'sex', 'toy', 'electrical', 'outlet', 'wiring', 'incident', 'kicked', 'hotel', 'where', 'have', 'spend', 'night', 'very', 'compact', 'car', 'real', 'trouble', 'begins', 'when', 'separate', 'see', 'different', 'things', 'Venice', 'Peter', 'Prentice', 'Sarah', 'ex', 'conveniently', 'staying', 'same', 'hotel', 'happy', 'couple', 'out', 'have', 'gone', 'separate', 'ways', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'Tom', 'bar', 'where', 'Dodgers', 'game', 'being', 'broadcast', 'cute', 'yet', 'ditzy', 'American', 'girl', 'immediately', 'hook', 'up', 'Instead', 'doing', 'gentlemanly', 'thing', 'immediately', 'telling', 'married', 'fester', 'very', 'compromising', 'situation', 'Tempers', 'flare', 'conflict', 'ensues', 'couple', 'first', 'premonition', 'call', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch']",Just Married
748660,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00008WJD6,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 2]","I wasn't supposed to like this movie. I didn't think that was going to happen. Even though I like both Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy, I figured this would be a horrible film with no redeeming values. All the usual cliches were there. Young stars in a goofy comedy that looked like a hundred other movies you have seen. Imagine my surprise when I actually began to like this movie. It was definitley enjoyable and bearable because of the two stars. Ashton stars as Tom Lezak, a regular schmo who works as a traffic dj on the radio. During a game of football on the beach, he meets pretty Sarah(Murphy). A girl who seems to be pretty cool until he finds out that she is rich and her dad is owner of a couple football teams. They hit it off and soon are together that very night. The two decide to get married and go off to her uppity, uppity parents. None of her family likes Tom. Not surprisingly. Sarah's ex-boyfriend Peter(""Angel""'s Christian Kane)is still around as well. Wouldn't you know it?. The two are hitched and go off on their honeymoon in and around Europe. This is where the true test of their relationship kicks in. Nothing goes right. It is a horrible honeymoon with one bad thing after another. I won't say exactly what happens, so as not to spoil the fun of it. It makes them, and other young couples like them, really start to think about their actions. Did they get married too young?. Too quick?. Do they really know each other well enough to get married?. Who are they?. The whole honeymoon makes the couple face those questions when it seems that they were better off dating and goofing around than being a married couple. Many of the situations you could see coming. I mean, did you really think her slimey, ex-boyfriend was going to stay out of the picture?. No, you didn't. I laughed a few times thru the movie. It was funny in spots. More of the jokes and funny situations that happen are ones that would put a smile on your face more than a hearty laugh. Ashton is great at this type of silly comedy and he has great reactions and mannerism to it. He proves this week after week on ""That 70's Show"". He has some nice comedic chops when he sticks to this kind of material. I have always liked Murphy, but after this movie, I am totally in love with her. I think everyone else will be too. She is as cute as a button and has incredible personality and presence. She is adorable. They really are a cute couple. They are really the sole reason why this movie is watchable. They are both really charming with great personalities. The movie probably would of been a big stinker like one would of thought it would of been in the first place if they had other, less appealing actors in the main roles. This isn't grand filmmaking, and it's not gonna be remembered much, but it's enjoyable in a ridiculous, fun way to kill an hour and a half. David Rasche, who has a cult following on the 80's TV show ""Sledge Hammer"", plays Murphy's dad, and Veronica Cartwright from ""Alien"" and ""The Witches Of Eastwick"" fame, plays her mom. It is obviously a juvenile little film, but it's harmless. We must keep that part of ourselves where we can just sit back and enjoy such silly things. That's much better than just critcizing other people or the bashing of filmmaking and low IQ's for liking a movie like this. That's ridiculous.

Even though I'm not really a film of romance movies, I can usually laugh enough to keep myself from falling asleep.  This movie, however, was exceptionally bad.  It's about a boy (Ashton Kutcher) and a girl (Brittany Murphy), who have an incredibly perfect relationship for nine months...until they get married.  Somehow, on the honeymoon, they manage to screw everything up and completely misunderstand each other, and decide they hate each other long enough for them to come home and learn a valuable lesson so they can live happily ever after.  LAME.Ashton Kutcher, who incidentally looks like he is wearing an incredible amount of makeup throughout the film (which gives him a unique drag-queen look), somehow manages to be almost as annoying as in ""Dude, Where's My Car.""  Brittany Murphy acts like a ten-year old who forgot to take her Ritalin and just drank fifteen cans of Mountain Dew.

748663,A3HR0V43CV3WC1,B00008WJD6,"Blurb ""Joker""","[0, 0]","This film tells the same story we've seen before.  A guy and girl meet randomly fall in love but wait they have to have a conflict and then make up and fall in love again.  Often there is a family memeber who hates the to be son-in-law in these types of movies.  This movie follows nothing different from the previous romantic comedies we've all seen.But basically this movie does follow those forementioned themes.  A guy and a girl fall in love but become unsure about their love as one disaster after another happens and it starts to become Honeymoon Hell as the two never have sex because of all the disasters mainly caused by Ashton.  A former boyfriend keeps getting the in the way of Ashton and Murphy's honeymoon and bad things just keep happening to the goofy character that Ashton plays.  This movie works because we so often see a mismatch in the characters that fall in love.  There is no onscreen chemistry between the two characters and we see it so often and it makes the movie less enjoyable.  However, this movie has two actors that look good together.  A kind hearted Ashton who is a magnet for mischief with a fun and honest character that Britney plays.  A few things make this movie work are:  The good onscreen chemistry the actors create, the funny continuous string of bad luck that keeps happening to the two, Ashtons character so much fits his mischief type character as he often brings on the bad luck like a magnet.  Britney is so honest that she cant seem to tell a lie and it seems to draw more funny events.  Of course the ending is quite normal but the big climax to me was not the fact that Ashton tries to win her back after a horrible honeymoon but the fact that his father tells him to grow up and just because they had a bad honey moon and this isnt high school anymore when you have one fight you simply break up.

Think again. From start to finish Just Married shows the trials and tribulations a young couple face when they fall in love too quickly and become impulsive.The movie starts out after the honeymoon when Kutcher and Murphy are at eachother's throats wanting a divorce. They can't stand to be together, but can they bare to be apart? The movie then begins to unfold when a lonely and miserable Kutcher tells how it all started.At first, you believe the whole movie will be shown through flashbacks and his memories, but that's not the case. Soon he starts at the beginning and that's where we watch these two people fall so madly in love. To say much else would give the movie away. So I'll shut up and just say what I liked about it.From their first kiss to their wedding and even into their honeymoon, Kutcher and Murphy bring realism and charisma to their characters all while exuding a rare chemistry on screen that many romantic comedies lack.The couple have the typical problems: their in-laws fight, they have different ideas about how to spend their free time and jealousy from past lovers ensue.They also have their not so typical problems: getting married and realizing they don't know who the other person is or what they want out of life and eachother.He just wanted a buddy, someone to give his empty life meaning, but he's too clueless and hard headed to fight for love.

748675,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00008WJD6,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[1, 1]","The story of two mismatched individuals meeting each other and, after trials and tribulations, overcoming their initial dislike of the other person only to fall in love is older than both the motion picture and modern literature.With the DVD release of 20th Century Fox's romantic comedy ""Just Married"" however we are treated to a slight twist on the storyline. In this mundane and occasionally hilarious romp our two protagonists fall madly in love and throughout the course of the picture gradually fall out and end up careering through an airport lounge attempting to cause the other as much discomfort as possible.Yes, not since the Griswold's turned the Old World on its head (and knocked over Stonehenge in the process) in ""National Lampoons European Vacation"" has the continent across the pond been so mistreated and abused by vacationing Americans. Current flavors of the month Ashton Kutcher (fresh off the success of ""Dude, Where's My Car"") and Brittany Murphy play two newlyweds that should have had the perfect romantic honeymoon in France and Italy but instead end up at each others throats and endure moremisfortune and mishaps than most couples could expect in a lifetime.The vast majority of the picture is shown in flashback with the opening credits playing against the return of the duo from their European vacation and Kutcher's characters examination of what went wrong.Kutcher plays decidedly blue collar Tom while Murphy tackles the role of the decidedly wealthy Sarah (her father is part owner of the Lakers and Dodgers). After a chance encounter on a beach they fall into a passionate affair and several months later announce their engagement to her suitably shocked (and disapproving parents). Will love conquer all? Well the answer may be obvious but the filmmakers still attempt to inject some doubt with the interruption of a persistent suitor, and the sheer magnitude of the hard luck stacked upon the couple through their first days of wedded ""bliss"".The problem with the narrative however is that it is simply not funny enough. The trailer promised big belly laughs and instead all we are given in subdued chuckles. In fact if you have already seen the trailer the truth is that you have already seen the funniest parts of this movie.PictureThe picture quality of Fox Home Entertainments DVD release is reasonably good with a nice 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer (and a full frame version on the flip-side). Although dark in parts and soft the colors are well defined and appropriate. Although not particularly remarkable the video quality is adequate.AudioAlso somewhat average is the audio on this DVD. Granted a new 5.1 Dolby Digital track by Fox one might expect it to be great (considering the standout work done by the studio on other recent releases) but instead it is simply standard. Still for fans of the soundtrack are treated to a decent surround mix.Special featuresThe most distressing element of the special features is the fact that they are split over both sides of the disc. This results in having to get up and flip over the disc (and endure the copyright warnings) to fully appreciate the entire package being delivered by Fox Home Entertainment. The only feature offered on both sides is an optional audio commentary.Participating in the audio commentary is Director Shawn Levy and stars Kutcher and Murphy. Obvious from this and other supplements the two Hollywood heart throbs fell in love both after the camera lights went out, as well as onscreen. As such most of the contributions provided on the audio commentary are delivered by Levy. For his part Kutcher is slightly dull and Murphy is, well, quiet. On the scale of other discs audio commentaries this one is a bit of a dud and truly only for fans of the stars or the movie (which judging by the statistics should result in their comments being well listened to).In contrast we are provided with a 21-minute Comedy Central Reel Comedy TV special which I am sad to say is a whole lot funnier and more entertaining than the main feature. The special features love struck Kutcher and Murphy along with a host chatting about the movie and answering some nonsensical trivia (parents be warned some of this is adult humor).Next up are four deleted scenes (with optional directors commentary), which add little to the overall picture and hardly worth much of a look.Rounding out the ""Just Married"" features is a very short promotional featurette and the theatrical trailer. Probably of more interest are trailers for two other Fox movie releases ""Le Divorce"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.""OverallIf you are looking for big belly laughs, this movie will not deliver that, but it could prove mildly diverting for a couple of hours. Really a purchase is only recommended for fans of Kutcher and Murphy, for everyone else this looks like a rental.",3,"No big belly laughs, but plenty of snickering",1095724800,"09 21,

Having survived nearly five years of marriage and my honeymoon  my perspective is much different.  I had a great courtship and engagement period and wouldn't have traded it for anything.  Once the I do's were said the whole dynamic between my wife and myself changed.  Despite a honeymoon in Hawaii it was anything but paradise.  Anybody who says you're going to have non-stop lovemaking is watching too many episodes of ""Desperate Housewives"".  When the honeymoon was over the word annulment was at the tip of my tongue.  Happily, though, me and my wife will celebrate our fifth anniversary this Fall and have successfully navigated trickier waters than our honeymoon.  ""Just Married"" mirrors the experiences of newlyweds.  Even if you lived together or spent many waking hours with your intended once wed your eyes open.  Things that were minor annoyances magnify and become major irritants.  Nothing of the nature of what happened to our young lovebirds in the movie happened to me like getting kicked out of a hotel or getting stuck in a large snow bank but you get the point.  Ashton Kutcher, who some dismiss as an affable hunk, and Brittany Murphy have great screen chemistry.  You believe them as a real couple and wish for their success and suffer real heartbreak when their relationship hits a pothole.  Murphy gives the better performance here and Kutcher feeds off it which it makes it all the more tragic her untimely demise.

748678,A103KNDW8GN92L,B00008WJD6,David Hugaert,"[0, 1]","Newlyweds Tom (Ashton Kutcher) and Sarah (Brittany Murphy) were truly made for each other, as they give married life a try in this Shawn Levy directed ""free-for-all"" comedy/romance. If only they could stop fighting long enough to stay married to each other... At the film's intro, the audience is given an insight into our beloved couple's future as a ""joined at the hip"" newly linked partnership. From viewing this particular scenario, it appears Tom's and Brittany's relationship might not contain the makings of a fruitful and satisfying partnership, but, that's not to say these two haven't had their ultimate moments in the sun regarding sheer platonacy - of which are ripe in number. ""Just Married"" contains an important moral within - in that it reminds us that whatever disastrous sitautions that lurk around every corner will eventually occur, and will triumph in certain areas. Those who have ever taken an all-important sojourn (vacation) can relate to the above reminder. As to whether or not this picture works best as either a comedy or a drama, or both, well, as a comedy, the humor is evenly paced for the most part (although dry in certain aspects), without capturing a ""dull as dishwater"" premise. As for the drama quotient, there is plenty to go around, with a lot of hooks to keep even the most skeptical viewer mesmerized. So, that's (sort of) ""Just Married"" in a nutshell. Even though this movie may not make ""Best Picture of the Year"" status in 2003, this is a movie still worthy of your time and money. This is an accurate and insightful guide to married life in certain respects. You'll want to say ""I do"" to even a second viewing (as well as to the [future] video and DVD release).

748679,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00008WJD6,David M. Lovin,"[3, 6]","I don't understand what constitutes a comedy these days.  Here is another ""comedy"" that is unfunny and focuses too much on the same tired jokes, mostly sexually related, without trying to develop any kind of storyline.  The acting is unremarkable, the script is below par, and the direction seems uninspired.  What a winner!Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play newlyweds who at the beginning of the film are returning from what was clearly not a great honeymoon.  They act like kids, running each other into walls and throwing gum into the other's hair.  We flash back to their meeting (Kutcher hitting her in the face with a football) and subsequent romance.  He is a graveyard shift traffic reporter for a radio station, while she has had all the education possible and is an avid art lover.The honeymoon is in Europe.  Right away you should realize what some of the jokes will be.  How about trying to plug something from America into the wall when the outlets won't fit and the power is twice as strong?...Ha Ha.  Then there's the jokes about European hygiene, with huge bugs crawling on our heroes when they are in the next hotel.Driving in Europe?  Then you have to get one of those suitcase sized European cars that can't be a worse shade of yellow.  Oh, and no extra points for guessing that an old flame of Murphy's will show up and try to steal her away.All in all, this movie is bad.

With that said:I found this movie boring and predictable.  Most of the characters in this movie were very cliche.  And it struck me that this movie was trying way too hard to get a laugh.  The situations that were supposed to be funny were a little far fetched.  I mean, I've lived in Europe and have plugged many 110 volt devices into 220 volt sockets and have yet destroyed an entire building's internal electrical wiring (maybe I've just been lucky).I also had a problem watching Ashton Kutcher come close to being an average buy and not the idiot I've seen in ""That 70's Show"" or the ""Dude, Where's My Car"" preview (I haven't seen that movie).  I think I spent half this movie watching him fluctuate from being normal to a complete moron in order to get the story into another bad situations.  I just did not click with this character and I suspect that it is because I'm used to seeing him on TV.I did, however, like the central message of this movie.  That is, once you are married, you are going to have good times and you are going to have bad times.  The good times are easy and the bad times fill in the gaps in between.

When it comes to laughs, this movie definitely delivers.  The dialogue, the action, the situational comedy -- it's all there and it's all funny.  Why then, can't I bring myself to give this movie more than 3 stars?  It's hard to explain but it was the feeling that the movie gives you.  You see, what they don't tell you in the previews is that most of the movie is a flashback.  The movie starts out with Ashton Kutcher's character wallowing in pain and anger over his derailed marriage.  That's kind of a bad vibe for a movie called ""Just Married.""  The majority of the rest of the movie shows how the marriage came to be derailed.  Don't get me wrong, it's funny as I said.  It's just not romantic.  In fact, it's the antithesis of romantic.  As with all romantic comedies, things turn out okay in the end, but it's a long, somewhat painful road getting there.  I guess if you go into this movie with the right expectations (no emotional commitment to the characters, looking to just laugh with not a lot of actual romance), you will really like this movie and probably give it 4-5 stars.  However, if you only saw the previews like I did, you may walk away with a less than ""feel-good"" feeling about the movie.  All in all, again, these were some darn funny antics.

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[1, 2]","Ashton Kutcher (the current young beau of Demi Moore) and Brittany Murphy star in a lightweight romantic comedy which follows the unfortunate love story of two young newlyweds. The basic premise would seem to be that despite being deeply in love, they rush into marriage far too quickly, leading to a stressful and violent honeymoon. Perhaps the intended message is that you should take your time to get to know your partner properly before getting married, although it's a little hard to find any message at all in this over-processed pap.Blue-collar Tom Leezak (Kutcher) meets wealthy Sara McNerney (Murphy) when he hits her in the face with a a pigskin during a beach football game. This inauspicious start soon leads to a whirlwind romance and the two become lovers and then co-habitees. This stage of their relationship is dealt with far too briefly, so the viewer gets little opportunity to witness the depth of their love. The director should have developed the relationship further at this stage, so that the happy, loving relationship could form a contrast to the disastrous start of their married life. Instead, we see them as whiny, spoiled children for most of the film and this does not lend itself to sympathy.Tom and Sara head off to Europe on honeymoon immediately after getting married. The movie then turns into a series of slapstick set-pieces which are churned out with no feeling and very little humour. The situations which lead to the hammy ""jokes"" are so contrived that you feel Hollywood is spoon-feeding you and frankly it is all rather patronising. There is a lot of very physical comedy in the film, and Kutcher and Murphy, to their credit, do carry this aspect quite well.The major sub-plot of the film is the jealousy of Peter Prentiss (Christian Kane), a yuppie who has had his eye on Sara for some time. Following them to Venice, he manages to widen the growing rift between the newlyweds, such that they return to the USA as soon-to-be divorcees. Kane is quite credible as the devious Peter and rises above the rest of the film to deliver a reasonable performance. Kutcher is reasonably charming and tries very hard to be funny but rarely succeeds, whilst Murphy cries and simpers so often than you just want to send her to her room. The real flaw with this movie is not the main actors however, but the main characters. You simply do not know them well enough to care about the survival of their relationship, or to sympathise with their honeymoon catastrophes.",3,A movie that tries too hard to be funny...,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,2495,"['Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'current', 'young', 'beau', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'star', 'lightweight', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'unfortunate', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'newlyweds', 'basic', 'premise', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'being', 'deeply', 'love', 'rush', 'marriage', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'leading', 'stressful', 'violent', 'honeymoon', 'Perhaps', 'intended', 'message', 'should', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'partner', 'properly', 'getting', 'married', 'little', 'hard', 'find', 'message', 'over-processed', 'pap.Blue-collar', 'Tom', 'Leezak', 'Kutcher', 'wealthy', 'Sara', 'McNerney', 'Murphy', 'when', 'face', 'pigskin', 'beach', 'football', 'game', 'inauspicious', 'start', 'soon', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'two', 'become', 'lovers', 'then', 'co-habitees', 'stage', 'relationship', 'dealt', 'far', 'too', 'briefly', 'viewer', 'little', 'opportunity', 'witness', 'depth', 'love', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'developed', 'relationship', 'further', 'stage', 'happy', 'loving', 'relationship', 'could', 'form', 'contrast', 'disastrous', 'start', 'married', 'life', 'Instead', 'see', 'whiny', 'spoiled', 'children', 'most', 'film', 'not', 'lend', 'sympathy.Tom', 'Sara', 'head', 'off', 'Europe', 'honeymoon', 'immediately', 'getting', 'married', 'movie', 'then', 'series', 'slapstick', 'set-pieces', 'are', 'churned', 'out', 'feeling', 'very', 'little', 'humour', 'situations', 'lead', 'hammy', 'jokes', 'are', 'so', 'contrived', 'feel', 'Hollywood', 'spoon-feeding', 'frankly', 'rather', 'patronising', 'lot', 'very', 'physical', 'comedy', 'film', 'Kutcher', 'Murphy', 'credit', 'do', 'carry', 'aspect', 'quite', 'well.The', 'major', 'sub-plot', 'film', 'jealousy', 'Peter', 'Prentiss', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'yuppie', 'who', 'had', 'eye', 'Sara', 'time', 'Following', 'Venice', 'widen', 'growing', 'rift', 'newlyweds', 'such', 'return', 'USA', 'soon-to-be', 'divorcees', 'Kane', 'quite', 'credible', 'devious', 'Peter', 'rises', 'rest', 'film', 'deliver', 'reasonable', 'performance', 'Kutcher', 'reasonably', 'charming', 'tries', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'rarely', 'whilst', 'Murphy', 'cries', 'simpers', 'so', 'often', 'just', 'want', 'send', 'room', 'real', 'flaw', 'movie', 'not', 'main', 'actors', 'however', 'main', 'characters', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'care', 'survival', 'relationship', 'sympathise', 'honeymoon', 'catastrophes']",Just Married

I was intrigued because I did the exact same thing once when I went to Europe, taking out the electricity in my hotel room and incurring the wrath of the hotel staff.

748702,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008WJD6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","If there is any one thing that I am sure about Tom Leezak (Ashton Kutcher) and Sarah McNerney (Brittany Murphy) after watching their disastrous honeymoon in &quot;Just Married,&quot; it would be that their relationship is based on great sex.  I am not sure if they really love each other in a way they will help them become soul mates, but there is no sign of sexual incompatibility with these newlyweds; they have the chemistry, but not the story.  Ironically, their honeymoon seems to get off on the wrong foot because they are too worn out at the end of their wedding day to have sex.  The second wrong foot comes when they try to make up for this in the lavatory on their flight to Europe and Tom gets it caught in the toilet.  Things go from bad to worse, to really worse, to horribly bad, and so on, gathering momentum with each and every stop the couple make in Europe.Let me just point to too things in this 2003 comedy from directory Shawn Levy that shows why it does not work.  In the aforementioned scene when Tom and Sarah are trying to join the Mile High Club, their attempts are funny instead of sexy.  There is fumbling and bumbling, admits lots of laughter, and then the whole thing ends with the Nasty Stewardess (Jill Parker-Jones, and, yes, that is how the character is named in the credits) who has been banging on the door to get them to return to their seats getting her nose broken, a rather mean-spirited payoff to the scene.  Then there is the uncredited Veronica Cartwright as Mrs. McNerney, who has a nickname that she insists Tom use when he becomes engaged to Sarah (I cannot put it here, even though it has five letters and not four).  I waited the entire film for this nickname to have some sort of payoff beyond Tom snickering every time he uses it or hears the name, but nothing was forthcoming from Sam Harper's script, which is pretty much the problem with the rest of the comedy.Cartwright is wasted in this script, as is David Rasche as her husband, but then everybody is pretty much relegated to a supporting role.  It was great to see Christian Kane, who did some wonderful work on the television series &quot;Angel,&quot; as Peter Prentiss, the guy Sarah's family wants her to marry, but he is also wasted in this film.  There is a subplot where Peter refuses to take Sarah's &quot;I do&quot; for an answer and continues to pursue her, but it is pretty lame and just another &quot;by the numbers&quot; element of this film (which includes the happy ending).There is a weak attempt to add some sort of class conflict to the comedy since she is the daughter of a rich family and he works for a radio station.  But it has nothing to do with the story.  Tom might not be stupid, despite some evidence to the contrary, but he has no trouble playing the Ugly American and he cuts a path of disaster through southern Europe.  &quot;Just Married&quot; also tries to impart serious &quot;lessons,&quot; in addition to the fact that you should have sex on your wedding night or horrible things will happen.  The main lesson is that you should confess your sins (e.g., he sort of killed her dog) to your spouse so that you marriage is not build on lies.  Having something to talk about besides sex and not insulting Europeans because they are not Americans would be better lessons, but this film is not interested in aiming anywhere near that high.",3,Cute couple but the comedy does not match their chemistry,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,3377,"['one', 'thing', 'am', 'sure', 'Tom', 'Leezak', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Sarah', 'McNerney', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'watching', 'disastrous', 'honeymoon', 'quot', 'Just', 'Married', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'relationship', 'based', 'great', 'sex', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'love', 'other', 'way', 'will', 'help', 'become', 'soul', 'mates', 'sign', 'sexual', 'incompatibility', 'newlyweds', 'have', 'chemistry', 'not', 'story', 'Ironically', 'honeymoon', 'get', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'are', 'too', 'worn', 'out', 'end', 'wedding', 'day', 'have', 'sex', 'second', 'wrong', 'foot', 'when', 'try', 'make', 'up', 'lavatory', 'flight', 'Europe', 'Tom', 'caught', 'toilet', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'really', 'worse', 'horribly', 'bad', 'so', 'gathering', 'momentum', 'stop', 'couple', 'make', 'Europe.Let', 'just', 'point', 'too', 'things', '2003', 'comedy', 'directory', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'why', 'not', 'work', 'aforementioned', 'scene', 'when', 'Tom', 'Sarah', 'are', 'trying', 'join', 'Mile', 'High', 'Club', 'attempts', 'are', 'funny', 'instead', 'sexy', 'fumbling', 'bumbling', 'lots', 'laughter', 'then', 'whole', 'thing', 'Nasty', 'Stewardess', 'Jill', 'Parker-Jones', 'yes', 'how', 'character', 'named', 'credits', 'who', 'been', 'banging', 'door', 'get', 'return', 'seats', 'getting', 'nose', 'broken', 'rather', 'mean-spirited', 'payoff', 'scene', 'Then', 'uncredited', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'Mrs.', 'McNerney', 'who', 'nickname', 'Tom', 'use', 'when', 'engaged', 'Sarah', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'here', 'even', 'five', 'letters', 'not', 'four', 'waited', 'entire', 'film', 'nickname', 'have', 'sort', 'payoff', 'Tom', 'snickering', 'time', 'name', 'nothing', 'was', 'forthcoming', 'Sam', 'Harper', 'script', 'pretty', 'much', 'problem', 'rest', 'comedy.Cartwright', 'wasted', 'script', 'David', 'Rasche', 'husband', 'then', 'everybody', 'pretty', 'much', 'relegated', 'supporting', 'role', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'who', 'did', 'wonderful', 'work', 'television', 'series', 'quot', 'Angel', 'quot', 'Peter', 'Prentiss', 'guy', 'Sarah', 'family', 'marry', 'also', 'wasted', 'film', 'subplot', 'where', 'Peter', 'take', 'Sarah', 'quot', 'do', 'quot', 'answer', 'pursue', 'pretty', 'lame', 'just', 'quot', 'numbers', 'quot', 'element', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'weak', 'attempt', 'add', 'sort', 'class', 'conflict', 'comedy', 'daughter', 'rich', 'family', 'radio', 'station', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'Tom', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'stupid', 'evidence', 'contrary', 'trouble', 'playing', 'Ugly', 'American', 'path', 'disaster', 'southern', 'Europe', 'quot', 'Just', 'Married', 'quot', 'also', 'impart', 'serious', 'quot', 'lessons', 'quot', 'addition', 'fact', 'should', 'have', 'sex', 'wedding', 'night', 'horrible', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'main', 'lesson', 'should', 'confess', 'sins', 'e.g.', 'sort', 'killed', 'dog', 'spouse', 'marriage', 'not', 'build', 'lies', 'Having', 'something', 'talk', 'besides', 'sex', 'not', 'insulting', 'Europeans', 'are', 'not', 'Americans', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'lessons', 'film', 'not', 'interested', 'aiming', 'anywhere', 'high']",Just Married

748704,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00008WJD6,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[19, 24]","I found this movie to have two distinct halves.  I somehow did not find it funny when Ashton Kutcher pushed Brittany Murphy near the beginning of the film.  Getting liquid all over her front was supposed to be slapstick, but I thought it was cruel and mean, even if they weren't getting along.  Because of this beginning, I found it difficult to get into the movie initially.Our story is an old one.  Poor boy meets rich girl.  The two fall in love.  The families object.  The two persist, and get married, and it turns out badly until the end of the movie; sort of like ""Romeo and Juliet"", only nobody dies, and it's funnier.However, I didn't get my first laugh until about 22 minutes into the movie.  I had to wait until about halfway through the movie before it started to get really funny.  The movie was supposed to be funny before that, but the humor was flat.  For example, Ashton Kutcher is plugging a sex toy into an electrical outlet.  Of course the toy has a plug for 110 volts, and the European hotel they are in has 220 volts, the European standard.  Ashton somehow believes he can get the plug in.  His rather more experienced wife stands by while he jams the plug in and predictably causes all sorts of havoc.Later the couple plows into a snow bank.  Ashton throws a snow ball at a passing car that doesn't stop to help them.  The old lady driving the car backs up and, again predictably, pushes their car over the edge while giving the two of them an obscene gesture (that part wasn't predictable).While I found the first half of the movie predictable and funny only in places, the second half of the film picked up substantially.  I finally identified with the characters, the movie became funny, and I thought the ending was touching.This movie does one thing really well.  Most movies about weddings and honeymoons try to paint a picture of how perfect everything is.  This movie shows a honeymoon disaster.  Further, it shows how two people who truly are in love with each other can find how truly difficult life can be when things go wrong.If you like light romantic comedy, this movie may be for you.  You may find more humor in the first half than I did.  If so, the second half will be an absolute riot.  The ending touched me.

Dillard ""Fulleyes""","[1, 2]","""Just Married"" is a silly, unfunny, and pointless film about two young adults who meet on the beach one day, and about a month or so later, they decide to get married. Sarah(Brittany Murphy) comes from a snobby, rich family. Tom(Ashton Kutcher) comes from a middle-class family. So, of course, Sarah's family doesn't agree with her choice of husband.The film starts with them coming back from their honeymoon. They are both mad at each other, and say that the marriage is off. Then the film goes back and shows their disasterous honeymoon, and then ends with them getting back together. Don't worry, I haven't given away much, because the ending can be concluded from just watching the trailer. In fact, the trailer basically sums up the whole film.The movie is predictable from the beginning. We know from the very first scene exactly how the movie will lay out. They will meet, get married, be initially happy, things will go wrong, they get mad, and then they get back together. What's really so painful about the film though is not that it's predictable. Just about all romantic comedies are. What's so painful are the endless, stupid gags, that I don't think quite honestly I laughed at one time. A romanic comedy can be predictable, you just need to have fun getting to the predictability, and this film has just about none what-so-ever.It's also time for Ashton Kutcher to grow up. He's funny in ""That 70's Show"" and ""Dude Where's My Car"" wasn't as bad as this trainwreck. Kutcher shows signs of being able to do something a little more serious, and should pursue that and see where it leads him. Also, Brittany Murphy should stick to drama as well. She was good in ""Don't Say a Word"" and even better in ""8 Mile"". She doesn't need to be waisting her time on such a poorly written, and cliche filled film such as this.

This time it's Ashton &amp; Brittany - who said they were totally committed and rubbish like that, and he's since swapped her for an older woman. Demi over Brittany - right!This was a good rom-com movie, believe me nothing is as bad as Two Weeks Notice. This is told in flashback (similar sort of style to Down To You), so it starts off technically towards the end of the movie, and works backwards, stopping off to see how Tom (Ashton) is feeling along the way.Blah de blah de blah. It's about this couple who get married - against their parents wishes obviously - and then discover they didn't really know that much about each other on their honeymoon. Which goes from one disaster to another, resulting in them never consummating their marriage. Poor them. What a pity. And did I mention she's got her ex (who she slept with and never told her now hubby) chasing after them, trying to make her see the light, that she desperately needs him, rather than Tom?

The newlyweds young marriage are tried by various factors including (the aforementioned) disapproving family and friends, an old suitor from Sarah's past and not too mention, the Honeymoon from Hell in Europe.THE COOL THINGS:Basically this is just one hilarious movie.  The amount of ""things going from bad too worse,"" while not quite at the level of ""Meet The Parents,"" are just hilariously played out.  Those two just don't have any luck!!!  Seeing the French and Italian countryside was a great bonus as well.  The core moral of the story of ""True Love Conquers All"" shines brilliantly through all the horrible situations Tom and Sarah find themselves in.  The simple plot device of ""jealous suitor"" returns to wreak havoc is very effective and plays itself out nicely through the film.BEST SCENES:1. The French hotel scene with the ""thingy"" and the electrical outlet2. The rundown Italian hotel scene3. The airline scenes4. Tom vs. PeterTHE DVD FEATURES:While a little on the sparse side, the extras on this DVD are still a winner and are guaranteed to make it worth your while, particularly the deleted scenes.  Here are the goodies included on this release:1. Feature length commentary by the Director and Co-stars:  Enlightening as always2. Comedy Central's ""Reel Comedy:  Just Married.""  Brittany and Ashton sit down and go over the movie with the host while playing ""Guess What They Said"" in this 20 minute piece from Comedy Central.  Fun listen!!3. 4 deleted scenes with optional director commentary.  These are actually some of the better deleted scenes I've seen on DVDs, and I've seen a lot of DVDs.4. ""Making of Featurette.""  Actually it's more like a 4 minute promotional spot for the movie.5. Theatrical Trailer plus two other promotional trailers for ""Le Divorce"" and ""LXG.""THE VERDICT:Overall, ""Just Married"" makes another excellent viewing choice.  If you're into romantic comedies you're bound to love this one.  Again, the number of situations Tom and Sarah get into are just hilarious (think ""Meet The Parents"" or another other hilarious comedy, just on a smaller scale) and the ultimate point of the movie ""Love Is All You Really Need"" is just a very true and important thing we all need to remember.  The DVD extras, while a little sparse, help make this DVD a fine choice for your viewing (or purchasing) pleasure.FINAL GRADES:The Movie:  4 starsThe Extras:  3.5 starsFinal:  3.75 stars",4,Can True Love Conquer the Honeymoon from Hell?,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,2717,"['pretty', 'hilarious', 'premise', 'Just', 'Married', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'should', 'make', 'great', 'viewing', 'fodder', 'night', 'couch', 'loved', 'one.THE', 'STORY', 'disapproval', 'family', 'friends', 'Sarah', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Tom', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'wed', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'newlyweds', 'young', 'marriage', 'are', 'tried', 'various', 'factors', 'including', 'aforementioned', 'disapproving', 'family', 'friends', 'old', 'suitor', 'Sarah', 'past', 'not', 'too', 'mention', 'Honeymoon', 'Hell', 'Europe.THE', 'COOL', 'THINGS', 'Basically', 'just', 'one', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'amount', 'things', 'going', 'bad', 'too', 'worse', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'are', 'just', 'hilariously', 'played', 'out', 'two', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'luck', 'Seeing', 'French', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'was', 'great', 'bonus', 'as', 'well', 'core', 'moral', 'story', 'True', 'Love', 'Conquers', 'All', 'shines', 'brilliantly', 'horrible', 'situations', 'Tom', 'Sarah', 'find', 'simple', 'plot', 'device', 'jealous', 'suitor', 'returns', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'very', 'effective', 'out', 'nicely', 'film.BEST', 'SCENES:1', 'French', 'hotel', 'scene', 'thingy', 'electrical', 'outlet2', 'rundown', 'Italian', 'hotel', 'scene3', 'airline', 'scenes4', 'Tom', 'PeterTHE', 'DVD', 'FEATURES', 'little', 'sparse', 'side', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'still', 'winner', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'particularly', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Here', 'are', 'goodies', 'included', 'release:1', 'Feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Co-stars', 'Enlightening', 'always2', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Reel', 'Comedy', 'Just', 'Married', 'Brittany', 'Ashton', 'sit', 'down', 'go', 'movie', 'host', 'playing', 'Guess', 'What', 'Said', '20', 'minute', 'piece', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Fun', 'listen', '3', '4', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary', 'are', 'actually', 'better', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'DVDs.4', 'Making', 'Featurette', 'more', '4', 'minute', 'promotional', 'spot', 'movie.5', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'two', 'other', 'promotional', 'trailers', 'Le', 'Divorce', 'LXG', 'VERDICT', 'Overall', 'Just', 'Married', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'choice', ""'re"", 'romantic', 'comedies', ""'re"", 'bound', 'love', 'one', 'Again', 'number', 'situations', 'Tom', 'Sarah', 'get', 'are', 'just', 'hilarious', 'think', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'other', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'just', 'smaller', 'scale', 'ultimate', 'point', 'movie', 'Love', 'All', 'Really', 'Need', 'just', 'very', 'true', 'important', 'thing', 'need', 'remember', 'DVD', 'extras', 'little', 'sparse', 'help', 'make', 'DVD', 'fine', 'choice', 'viewing', 'purchasing', 'pleasure.FINAL', 'GRADES', 'Movie', '4', 'starsThe', 'Extras', '3.5', 'starsFinal', '3.75', 'stars']",Just Married

Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[0, 0]","The fresh faces are in abundance with Asthon Kuthcer and Brittany Murphy front lining this light comedic affair, however the movie seems to try to draw most of it's laughs from an overabundance of pratfall and stooge-like physical comedy.  Though it works in places, too much of a good thing can be too much of a good thing.  Most of the sight gags seems to involve noses and faces and blows to the noses and faces.  You see it the first time as Murphy gets pegged by a Kutcher-launched football on the beach, you chuckle.  You see it the 10th time and you groan...there the blow to the nose gag again...let me set my stopwatch...in 5 minutes we can expect the next one.  It gets predictable.With that said, ""Just Married,"" can be enjoyed as a light rental.  It has great scenery of Europe and the two young actors can be pretty enjoyable at times feeding off each other's manic energy.  In the running commentary featured as an extra on the DVD, we hear Kutcher call up John Kusack and Cameron Crowe's movie, ""Say Anything,"" as inspiration.  And that's where the merit of this comedy can be weighed.  Next to, ""Say Anything,"" ""Just Married,"" is a flat honeymoon.  It just won't stand out years from now as a movie to be remembered.Director, Shawn Levy's instincts pays off letting his actors ad lib scenes with some of the movies most enjoyable moments coming with the zany interplay between Kutcher and Murphy.  Though I'm not sure this would be one to buy, unless your a big fan of light comedies, I'd say it would be a good rent if you didn't have anything else in mind to watch.How does it end...""I'll never tell..""",3,"Dude, how does it end...I'll Never Tell...",1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,1620,"['fresh', 'are', 'abundance', 'Asthon', 'Kuthcer', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'front', 'lining', 'light', 'comedic', 'affair', 'however', 'movie', 'try', 'draw', 'most', 'overabundance', 'pratfall', 'stooge-like', 'physical', 'comedy', 'places', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'Most', 'sight', 'gags', 'involve', 'noses', 'noses', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'Murphy', 'pegged', 'Kutcher-launched', 'football', 'beach', 'chuckle', 'see', '10th', 'time', 'groan', 'blow', 'nose', 'gag', 'again', 'let', 'set', 'stopwatch', '5', 'minutes', 'can', 'expect', 'next', 'one', 'said', 'Just', 'Married', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'light', 'rental', 'great', 'scenery', 'Europe', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'times', 'feeding', 'off', 'other', 'manic', 'energy', 'running', 'commentary', 'featured', 'extra', 'DVD', 'hear', 'Kutcher', 'call', 'up', 'John', 'Kusack', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'movie', 'Say', 'Anything', 'inspiration', 'where', 'merit', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'weighed', 'Next', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Just', 'Married', 'flat', 'honeymoon', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'years', 'now', 'movie', 'be', 'remembered.Director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'instincts', 'letting', 'actors', 'ad', 'lib', 'scenes', 'movies', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'coming', 'zany', 'interplay', 'Kutcher', 'Murphy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'buy', 'big', 'fan', 'light', 'comedies', ""'d"", 'say', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'rent', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'else', 'mind', 'watch.How', 'end', ""'ll"", 'never', 'tell..']",Just Married

And I usually hate romantic comedies, very few actually entertain me.The storyline is no rocket science. Sara, daughter of a wealthy family meets Tom, a radio DJ and they hit it off. They soon get married, although it is furiously objected by Sara's posh family. The movie follows the couple's honeymoon trip, where things get really crazy and they encounter all sorts of weird scenarios, which eventually causes them to drift apart and it's not long before they wonder if marriage was too soon for them. What happens? Everyone would probably know, but that's not the point. The point is the movie gives us a really funny, enjoyable ride to that predictable conclusion.A big part of why the movie worked for me are definitely Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy. C'mon, you have to admit, they make a really cute and wacky couple. Ashton is his usual immatured self, making even the most serious situations into a big joke. Brittany Murphy is at one of her cutest here, she has a really nice smile/giggle, and delivers what is required from her character perfectly.

Kutcher and Murphy are Tom and Sara, the mismatched couple that loves itself to pieces in this story which strains for laughs. After a whirlwind romance, Sara introduces Tom to her tony Beverly Hills family. They marry and the rest (much like their marriage) is quickly history. Things go bad from the wedding night (bloody noses, no sex) and only get worse. After Tom nearly burns down the French Chalet that Sara booked them into (after a fatal misunderstanding involving voltage differences in Europe and an electric sex-toy), and compounds problems by taking them to the worst hotel in Venice (cockroaches, dust and no sex), our heroes quickly realize that they are on the Honeymoon-from-hell. At first they gamely make a go of it, not realizing that they're only saving their tension for the perfect moment.""Just Married"" was a simple idea for a flick. People have been laughing at marriage for years. Maybe that's why the jokes seem forced - the sex-toy fiasco painfully illustrates how far the script will go to get a laugh, and we get that one early on. Every joke is actually half of a joke about Sara and Tom can't have sex, climaxing (really, no pun intended - I mean it!) when Sara tricks custom's inspectors into giving her hated hubby a full-rectal exam (cut to the scene of Tom walking bow-legged onto the plane; obviously he's the victim, but in the perverse logic of this unsexual non-comedy, you've got to wonder whether Tom is actually the victor - he at least got some.) The script can't get past a monumental plot gap: Tom and Sara really don't have anything in common - you'd think they'd have learnt and gotten past their foibles while they dated, but the story skips past much of that. Tom's the hero, but he's an idiot - the script makes him out as the ugly American, an utterly dated cliche (he's surprised that nobody in Europe watches American baseball; he's the kind of idiot who uses ""American"" instead of ""English"" when referring to language - as in ""Why isn't there a sign in American warning against using US voltage sex-toys in France?""  The laughs are far and few in between - the best ones involve cars (both the ridiculous sub-compact they rent in France, and the Dodge Barracuda (at least I think it's a `Cuda) that Tom drives - a monster which was probably meant to remind us about ""That 70's show"" but which looks like a prop from the ""Phantasm"" movies.

748730,A17TZ4F2521YBZ,B00008WJD6,"Ryan U ""Discerning Consumer""","[0, 0]","Now if I were being true to the rating system this movie may only be worthy of 3 stars but rather than rating it based solely upon its cinematic achievements I opted instead to rate it based upon its entertainment value.  The plot in it of itself isn't entirely original, though it does have some contemporary adaptations for a perpetually pleasing storyline.  It goes something like this.  Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy and girl move in together.  Love brews, passions rise, and after 9 months or so of cohabitation, in a particularly awkward fashion, boy proposes to girl.  Girl, who's since become totally smitten with boy, accepts and embarks on a wedding planning frenzy despite the nay-says of her rather well-to-do family.  Their marital bliss is short lived and the reality of married life sets in on the honeymoon which is laden with one disaster after another.  The couple copes well to begin, but the chronic, nagging strain of stress tests the strength of their nuptial commitment.  After a fire, car wreck, suspicions of infidelity, abbreviated jail sentence, and impromptu cavity search the not-so-happily-ever-after newlyweds agree, not so subtly, to part ways.  Boy realizes the error of his ways and succumbs to the overwhelming desire and emotion inside him and delivers heartfelt monologue to recapture the heart of his love.  I'll admit, at times the story required a vacation from your disbelief and a romantically open mind, but of the movies in the redefined romantic comedy genre this one speaks well to a young audience and can be appreciated for its bits of novelty.  Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy both cast themselves well in the love/hate relationship in which their characters find themselves.  They radiate with onscreen chemistry, no doubt a result of their abbreviated, but seemingly intense off screen romance.  Their relationship and connection are strong and believable which is essential if any romantic comedy has a prayer of being worth its weight in film.  The on location scenes and cinematography were above par as well, while the score did resonate of a little too much mainstream, it did fit the movie well and provided a compliment, not a contrast.

748742,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008WJD6,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","&quot;Just Married&quot; is not as bad as critics may say.  Wide-eyed Brittany Murphy is surpisingly lovely (after her turns in &quot;8 Mile&quot; and &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;), and puppy-eyed Ashton Kutcher is also handsome and likable.  It's just too ordinary, and too predictable, that's all.Sarah, young girl from rich family, and Tom, not-so-rich traffic radio announcer fall in love with each other, and they go to Europe on honeymoon.  Wrong choice, it turns out, for everything there seems to interrupt the good time tey try to spend, and even Sarah's old boyfriedn shows up, possibly to break the relations between the newlyweds.The film's opening airport scene shows how their honeymoon ended; that's uncomfortable, because we know what is going to happen (temporarily or not).  And what happens is not particularly interesting.  In France, you meet a snobbish French hotel manager; in Italy (and postcard Italy) Tom wants to see baseball on TV while Sarah wants him to go to museum.  In Switzerland their car gets stuck among the snow, and so on.The two leads are always likable, but they also look like puppets manipulated by the script, which needs desperately something to amuse the audiences.  You can see the director pulling strings behind them when you see the couple ruin the hotel room (and its electricity system too) for no other reason than having a bit of fun, but we know that no one would act like that.  Or see how Tom gets invloved in troubles (or another girl played by Valeria) in Venice in a purely slapstick manner.  Remember you are in love with cute Brittany Murphy, and you would never act like that, which might invite some misunderstanding on the side of your lovely wife Brittany.&quot;Just Married&quot; shows that the leading stars can do romantic comedy pretty well, and for the fans of Brittany Murphy it will be a good occasion to remember that she was once in another delightful comedy &quot;Clueless.&quot;  But the film's ruthlessly eager attitude to be funny is nothing that makes us laugh, lacking natural charma and more articulate characters,",3,Just OK Romantic Comedy,1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,2097,"['quot', 'Just', 'Married', 'quot', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'may', 'say', 'Wide-eyed', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'surpisingly', 'lovely', 'turns', 'quot', '8', 'Mile', 'quot', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'quot', 'puppy-eyed', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'also', 'handsome', 'likable', 'just', 'too', 'ordinary', 'too', 'predictable', 'all.Sarah', 'young', 'girl', 'rich', 'family', 'Tom', 'not-so-rich', 'traffic', 'radio', 'announcer', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'go', 'Europe', 'honeymoon', 'Wrong', 'choice', 'out', 'everything', 'there', 'interrupt', 'good', 'time', 'tey', 'try', 'spend', 'even', 'Sarah', 'old', 'boyfriedn', 'up', 'possibly', 'break', 'relations', 'newlyweds.The', 'film', 'opening', 'airport', 'scene', 'how', 'honeymoon', 'ended', 'uncomfortable', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'temporarily', 'not', 'what', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'France', 'meet', 'snobbish', 'French', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Italy', 'postcard', 'Italy', 'Tom', 'see', 'baseball', 'TV', 'Sarah', 'go', 'museum', 'Switzerland', 'car', 'stuck', 'snow', 'so', 'on.The', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'always', 'likable', 'also', 'look', 'puppets', 'manipulated', 'script', 'desperately', 'something', 'amuse', 'audiences', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'pulling', 'strings', 'when', 'see', 'couple', 'hotel', 'room', 'electricity', 'system', 'too', 'other', 'reason', 'having', 'bit', 'fun', 'know', 'one', 'would', 'act', 'see', 'how', 'Tom', 'invloved', 'troubles', 'girl', 'played', 'Valeria', 'Venice', 'purely', 'slapstick', 'manner', 'Remember', 'are', 'love', 'cute', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'would', 'never', 'act', 'might', 'invite', 'misunderstanding', 'side', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Brittany.', 'quot', 'Just', 'Married', 'quot', 'leading', 'stars', 'can', 'do', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'well', 'fans', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'occasion', 'remember', 'was', 'once', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Clueless.', 'quot', 'film', 'ruthlessly', 'eager', 'attitude', 'be', 'funny', 'nothing', 'lacking', 'natural', 'charma', 'more', 'articulate', 'characters']",Just Married

Marshall,"[0, 0]","Finally a romantic comedy that is really both, funny and touching.Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher form an excellent comedy team in this movie, they feed off of each other perfectly and offer great moments of sarcastic fun. Murphy is a rich young woman who prefers to fall in love for love's sake rather than for a financial portfolio. Her parents, played by Veronica Cartwright and David Rasche, are hilarious as the controlling rich folks. Kutcher is the beach dude with little besides charm in his portfolio. Needless to say the two opposites fall in love, marry and begin a honeymoon in Europe. This is where the film becomes a real comedy, watching Kutcher bumbling around Europe with absolutely no class while Murphy tries to smooth all of his behavior over. It begins with the smallest rental car ever and ends with a whole mess of confusion in Italy. Believe me if you have ever been to Europe you can completely relate to the bumbling Americans!This film is really well done, visually beautiful, highly comedic and even touching between the moments of laughter. Murphy and Kutcher are perfectly cast and work together really well. And we must not forget the little bulldog that spends a few scenes hamming it up!

Unfortunately for them, Sarah's parents send Sarah's ex-boyfriend Peter (Christian Kane) to break up the happy marriage.The European honeymoon is entertaining.  They happy couple spend a night in snow  drift, and another night blowing electrical circuits in a castle (5 star hotel) and being ejected.  Desperate to find lodging they spend a  night in a cockroach infested Venice pension and a night fighting in a classy Venice hotel.  As a final treat they spend a night in jail.This movie has lots of slapstick comedy, but social lessons as well.  Tom demonstrates why a man needs to avoid getting his ego in the way of his actions when he blows  hotel circuits, insults a hotel manager and gets kicked out of a five star resort  Sarah demonstrates why some secrets must be told and others withheld and why guilt gets in the way of starting a marriage. Both learn that love can conquer a lot of trouble if you allow  the love to work.Just Married is a comedy worth viewing.  It is an above average film that can tickle your funny bone.
