939866,A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E,B000BBOUUE,"Archie Mercer ""Archie""","[0, 0]","One night, rather bored and lazy, I happened across the film and decided to watch it. Later in the week, I watched it again. It wasn't because the movie was great (believe me, it wasn't), not because the acting was inspired (average at best, insipid at times), and certainly not because Anne Hathaway decided to appear topless (whopee-big-deal, another young actress willing to show her lack of common sense). No, I just couldn't figure out what I was missing that made some people rave about this movie. Guess what, I still don't get it. A previous reviewer said it was a ""well-meaning movie."" I guess that's true but unfortunately, it failed it whatever it was trying to mean.The plot is curiously the opposite of Hathaway's movieThe Princess Diaries (Special Edition). Here we see a rich & spoiled girl with disinterested parents trying to submerge herself into the Latino gang experience. I guess that must have been the attraction for Hathaway, making a film as far away as her squeaky-clean image as possible. Nothing wrong with that but she might have picked a movie that wouldn't have to have used her toplessness as their main marketing point. In other words, pick a movie that would be worth it.Not that it didn't have its moments. One of the most interesting characters was the teen (sorry, can't remember his name) who was making a film about all the happenings with the ""cool crowd"". Some of his insights on the character of each person were actually quite good. His comment to Hathaway's character about being one of the loneliest people he knows really brought forth the whole point of the movie. But it was just too little, too late.Overall, I would say pass on this movie. The plot is anemic, the acting not much better than a high school play, and all the stereotypes it plays off of just makes it all seem too contrived.

939868,A2F8ZRSX7MDOCT,B000BBOUUE,"Brandon Wiggins ""Glass Onion Child""","[153, 166]","Obviously the main draw of this DVD is the fact that Anne Hathaway appears 'nude'. However, if your expecting all out full-frontal nudity and borderline porno scenes with Hathaway---think again. Several scenes (most notably the one with Hathaway and Philips in the bedroom) had oh so much potential, but in the end there are simply a few scenes of Hathaway topless. (a lot more of Philips)Now, on to the movie...This is an interesting topic to make a film about...wiggers AKA white kids with too much time and money. Ironically the term is mostly used by white people to label other white people. Anyways, THIS particular film did not achieve anything spectacular. The story begins with 2 'crews' arguing with each other and introduces us to the PTC (Hathaway's crew). The story itself is not very interesting (white kids go to the hood and get involved with a gang), but, surprisingly, the film is entertaining to watch.The character's themselves (in the beginning) were a little to close to 'Malibu's Most Wanted' to fully embrace this movie as a drama and care about them. Also, as the story progresses, not enough effort is put into learning about or developing the characters. (More details about Hathaway's character in the beginning would have been great)This is unfortunate becuase later in the film, it would have been helpful to care a little more about these people. The characters really only start to become more than two dimensional in the last 25 minutes or so. Anne Hathaway and Bijou Philips were good on screen together and had the most authentic feeling relationship in the entire movie.Overall, this film definitely had potential to be a good film and could have been done wonders with a few more plot intricacies and more character development.

939871,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000BBOUUE,Chris Kennison,"[5, 9]","Inevitably, the real story of the movie HAVOC is the dramatic turn for Anne Hathaway from Disney poster child to sexually agressive gangsta chick. Many have criticized the poor girl for this dramatic turn... but you know what... there are a lot of things that seperate the successful from the forgotten in Hollywood... but ONE MAJOR THING IS GUTS! With Havoc, Anne proves that she is overflowing with it.Many other women have taken this turn in the past, and probably have had to listen to the same criticizisms... just to list a couple... Jane Seymour and more importantly, another former Disney childstar named JODIE FOSTER... who has done alright for herself too, by making BOLD and GUTSY decisions herself.In Havoc, she is a completely different person and she really gets to act out and flesh out a character with bite, vive and sexual curiosity that made get her in deeper than she really is ready for.I give this movie 4 stars, because to me, this movie is more about Anne Hathaway taking an aggressive step with her career than the movie itself. Her first big step landed her in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN... the most critically acclaimed film of the year. SEE YOU AT THE OSCARS ANNE.Okay, the movie...  The movie is okay, but not much more than that. It's basically about a couple of bored upperclass white sociallites who are unable to resist the bad boys. Their sexual curiosity seems to pull them towards a very dangerous drug dealing and murdering latino gang. How far will they go to satisfy their curiosity?The performances are good, but there was one very very very important thing that ruined the movie for me. And 'no' it isn't because of the scene with Anne Hathaway. But, the gang leader, Hector (Played well by Freddy Rodriquez), is too soft.From what I understand, this movie is not so far fetched. These things are actually happening in L.A. Yet, it's the Latino gangs who are KIDNAPPING white women and abusing them against their wills. Yet, in Havoc, the white women COME TO THEM and I felt like the way his character fleshed out was unrealistic and took away from the point of the movie.In my opinion, the movie had a great premise, but didn't deliver where it should have, and I don't fault the actors, I fault the direction. Tension could have been fleshed out more. The fear and the danger of gang life could have been fleshed out more. Because of these things, the movie is only a 2 star movie.On the other hand, Anne Hathaway proved that she can become a completely different character and proved that she's gonna be an actor that's gonna be around for time to come. Not to mention, increased her drool factor. That's why I give the movie as a whole 4 stars.",4,Hathaway goes Gangsta,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2681,"['Inevitably', 'real', 'story', 'movie', 'HAVOC', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Disney', 'poster', 'child', 'sexually', 'agressive', 'gangsta', 'chick', 'Many', 'have', 'criticized', 'poor', 'girl', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'seperate', 'successful', 'forgotten', 'Hollywood', 'ONE', 'MAJOR', 'THING', 'IS', 'GUTS', 'Havoc', 'Anne', 'overflowing', 'it.Many', 'other', 'women', 'have', 'taken', 'turn', 'past', 'probably', 'have', 'had', 'listen', 'same', 'criticizisms', 'just', 'list', 'couple', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'more', 'importantly', 'former', 'Disney', 'childstar', 'named', 'JODIE', 'FOSTER', 'who', 'done', 'alright', 'too', 'making', 'BOLD', 'GUTSY', 'decisions', 'herself.In', 'Havoc', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'really', 'act', 'out', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'bite', 'vive', 'sexual', 'curiosity', 'made', 'get', 'deeper', 'really', 'ready', 'for.I', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'movie', 'more', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'taking', 'aggressive', 'step', 'career', 'movie', 'first', 'big', 'step', 'landed', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'year', 'SEE', 'AT', 'OSCARS', 'ANNE.Okay', 'movie', 'movie', 'okay', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'basically', 'couple', 'bored', 'upperclass', 'white', 'sociallites', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'resist', 'bad', 'boys', 'sexual', 'curiosity', 'pull', 'towards', 'very', 'dangerous', 'drug', 'dealing', 'murdering', 'latino', 'gang', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'satisfy', 'curiosity', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'important', 'thing', 'ruined', 'movie', ""n't"", 'scene', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'gang', 'leader', 'Hector', 'Played', 'well', 'Freddy', 'Rodriquez', 'too', 'soft.From', 'what', 'understand', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'fetched', 'things', 'are', 'actually', 'happening', 'L.A', 'Latino', 'gangs', 'who', 'are', 'KIDNAPPING', 'white', 'women', 'abusing', 'wills', 'Havoc', 'white', 'women', 'COME', 'TO', 'THEM', 'felt', 'way', 'character', 'fleshed', 'out', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'took', 'away', 'point', 'movie.In', 'opinion', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'premise', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actors', 'fault', 'direction', 'Tension', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'fear', 'danger', 'gang', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'things', 'movie', 'only', '2', 'star', 'movie.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'proved', 'can', 'become', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'proved', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'actor', 'gon', 'be', 'time', 'come', 'Not', 'mention', 'increased', 'drool', 'factor', 'why', 'give', 'movie', 'whole', '4', 'stars']",Havoc

939873,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000BBOUUE,"Cloud ""...""","[7, 8]","Many films try to get inside the teenage mind. What makes kids have sex with guys they just met an hour earlier at a party? Or for them to try out drugs and drink till they pass out? Quite frankly I don't want to know. I never was interested in that kind of lifestyle but many are. Havoc tries to get into that mind, in particular the odd subculture of the wigga, meaning rich white kids trying to be gangster and street. The premise is intriguing but ugh it goes nowhere.Allison(a regrettably miscast Anne Hathaway) is one of those rich white girls who leads a boring life. Since nothing exciting happens she joins an odd subculture called wiggers, where they try to be like a gang, even with their own name. On a ride to get weed with her friend Emily(Bijou Phillips, who oddly seems comfortable in these roles) and boyfriend, things go awry when the boyfriend accuses the dealer Hector(an unrecognizable Freddy Rodriguez from Six Feet Under). Oddly Allison develops a fascination with it.This grows even more when she keeps following him around and doing what I call the accidental stalker.(""oh what are you doing here?"") comes to mind, since you knew they were there. Anyways Allison and her friend want in only they go through a ritual involving sex and numbers on a dice. Things don't go as planned and they all get a reality check.Of course one of the big draws of the film isn't the message of the film, but rather star Anne Hathaway disrobes. 3 times actually. She's a bit miscast since after going from Princess Diaries to this it's too much of a change. Other actresses do sort of serious work gradually and then do a 180 role and we accept it since it's not a change. Here it's like Disney......to being naked and giving oral sex in the back of a car. The other actors do their part well but there's not really any standouts, except maybe Freddy Rodriguez. Of course my highlight is Shiri Appleby. Just her face is enough to keep me entertained. Lamentably she doesn't have a whole lot of screen time.The one issue that I have is the ending. It's so truncated, sudden and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness. There's not a real closure for any of the characters and their fates are never dealt with. This might tie into the feeling of their fates aren't determined just like life but this is either lazy filmmaking or wannabe artsiness.I can understand the idea behind the film which is teenagers tend to go towards something that is not always the best idea so the message gets across, just not the film itself.",3,"The premise hits home, everything else doesn't",1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,2527,"['Many', 'films', 'try', 'get', 'teenage', 'mind', 'What', 'kids', 'have', 'sex', 'guys', 'just', 'met', 'hour', 'earlier', 'party', 'try', 'out', 'drugs', 'drink', 'till', 'pass', 'out', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'never', 'was', 'interested', 'kind', 'lifestyle', 'many', 'are', 'Havoc', 'get', 'mind', 'particular', 'odd', 'subculture', 'wigga', 'meaning', 'rich', 'white', 'kids', 'trying', 'be', 'gangster', 'street', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'nowhere.Allison', 'regrettably', 'miscast', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'one', 'rich', 'white', 'girls', 'who', 'boring', 'life', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'odd', 'subculture', 'called', 'wiggers', 'where', 'try', 'be', 'gang', 'even', 'own', 'name', 'ride', 'get', 'weed', 'friend', 'Emily', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'who', 'oddly', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'boyfriend', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'dealer', 'Hector', 'unrecognizable', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Oddly', 'Allison', 'fascination', 'it.This', 'grows', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'following', 'around', 'doing', 'what', 'call', 'accidental', 'stalker', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'here', 'mind', 'knew', 'were', 'there', 'Anyways', 'Allison', 'friend', 'want', 'only', 'go', 'ritual', 'involving', 'sex', 'numbers', 'dice', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'get', 'reality', 'check.Of', 'course', 'one', 'big', 'draws', 'film', ""n't"", 'message', 'film', 'rather', 'star', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', '3', 'times', 'actually', 'bit', 'miscast', 'going', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'too', 'much', 'change', 'Other', 'actresses', 'do', 'sort', 'serious', 'work', 'gradually', 'then', 'do', '180', 'role', 'accept', 'not', 'change', 'Here', 'Disney', 'being', 'naked', 'giving', 'oral', 'sex', 'back', 'car', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'part', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'standouts', 'maybe', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'course', 'highlight', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'Just', 'face', 'enough', 'keep', 'entertained', 'Lamentably', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'screen', 'time.The', 'one', 'issue', 'have', 'ending', 'so', 'truncated', 'sudden', 'feeling', 'emptiness', 'not', 'real', 'closure', 'characters', 'fates', 'are', 'never', 'dealt', 'might', 'tie', 'feeling', 'fates', 'are', ""n't"", 'determined', 'just', 'like', 'life', 'lazy', 'filmmaking', 'wannabe', 'artsiness.I', 'can', 'understand', 'idea', 'film', 'teenagers', 'tend', 'go', 'towards', 'something', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'idea', 'so', 'message', 'just', 'not', 'film']",Havoc

939875,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000BBOUUE,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[7, 8]","Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips play two friends who are rich, spoiled brats who are bored with having virtually everything.  Their sheltered upbringing leaves them thirsting for some sort of excitement.  This, in-turn, leads the young ladies down a dark road of drugs & violence.  Early on in the story they hang out with a white gang full of people who act like they're black gangstas.  From there, our mis-guided friends believe they're moving up the food chain by hanging out with a Mexican gang in a sordid part of L.A. where even the L.A.P.D. is reluctant to go.This movie seems to me to be an overt attempt by Hathaway to shed herThe Princess Diaries (Full Screen Edition)persona.  If her objective was to keep from being type-cast in the future as only capable of happy-go-lucky roles, then she succeeded!  She is perfect for the present role precisely BECAUSE she doesn't look like a young woman who would be prone to hang out w/gangs;  she would seem far too demure and innocent for that sort of thing.Even though the movie is unrated, I still was not expecting Anne to shed her clothes.  I will concede that I nearly fell off my couch when she first took her shirt off!  Anne has the capacity to be the Denise Richards of her generation, and quite possibly become a far more accomplished actress than Richards.  In time, she may even approach the calibre of our girl Jennifer Connelly!The story itself is a dark one.  The characters of Anne & Bijou must learn a basic lesson of growing up the hard way:  when you play with fire long enough, eventually you are going to get burned.  It's all fun & games, after all, until a psychopathic drug dealer is pointing a gun @ your head.  Along the same path, the movie has a serious erotic element to it that quickly takes a left-turn and becomes disturbing.  I'm guessing that's what usually happens when you combine gangs with sex.

Go rolling to East L.A. in a convertible Mercedes or SUV?  Can you say car-jack victim?  I can...without any bias whatsoever.2. The initiation scene is somewhat realistic.  It has been said that in order for girls to join certain male dominated groups (gangs, etc.), that they must submit themselves to the 'group.'  That has been documented in the press...any teenage girls out there?  Well, beware!!3. As a person who has been to Palisades High School in West Los Angeles (yes, folks, Pacific Palisades High School is real, just minutes from the beach!).  You do indeed see kids immersed in the hip-hop culture.  The difference?  Some of these kids' families are very well-off.  That part of the movie comes through very well.  Families with the kind of money depicted in the film are usually quite busy making money, and not home for their kids...well, you know the rest.4. Finally, the scene where the Palisades boys go to look for the gang-bangers that ravaged their friend was just unrealistic.  These guys would have been seen a mile-off and would have been dealt with accordingly.

In what was a stupid move by either Hathaway or her agent, she decided to make a ""dark"" film and to do nudity. Disney never forgets, Anne.This movie was laughable at best. The acting was pure trash. It was a bit racist painting the picture of the latin community being full of drug dealers and would-be rapists.Even Hathaway trying to emulate a ""bad girl"" image was terrible: Her talking ""street"" and using drugs was ridiculous and forced.Her street slang reminded me of the ridiculous moment Christina Aguilera was trying to sound hip and street at one time. The movie isn't even all that ""dark"". There were moments that the movie could've taken a dark turn, but it would suddenly lose momentum. Since when does a friend committing suicide become a comedy element out of nowhere in such a ""serious"" film?Hathaway might be in luck that this horrible film went straight-to-video rather than being released in theaters, somewhat salvaging her career.

The spirit of La Bamba permeates this film insofar as we are supposed to understand how Anne Hathaway genuinely ""shares a moment"" for her Ritchie Valens.  I have no idea what the characters' names are in this movie but everyone is familiar.  Laura San Giacomo is in it, Reese from Terminator is in it, boy from Third Rock From the Sun and busty loosey goosey teen is played again by no longer a teen Bijou Phillips. I thank them all for doing this public service announcement about treating thug life as a consumer product.I feel so sorry for that young looking Hispanic actor who had to play the Ritchie Valens part in this movie complete with the big man walk.  I think he even did that cigarette drag and unplug that shows you are tough.  If the characters had been permitted to have a real romance, we would have been favored with close ups of tears standing in his eyes and the line in his cheek from biting down on his back teeth during moments of romantic misunderstanding.  This movie also has the 40-something year old actor who played the surviving marine in Clear and Present Danger.  Unfortunately, Esai Morales is too busy doing phone card commercials on Spanish television to participate in this amazing film.Obviously, the Socs from Pacific Palisades can't take on Sabor Latino so I think a sequel/crossover is called for where the Socs bring in the Southies from Good Will Hunting.p.s. Anne Hathaway raps or sings some gangsta moll song early in the movie.  She does a lot of acting with her eyes in this movie resembling a pretty fit Liza Minnelli and is the main reason that this movie is not terrible.  It's not too heavy or embarassing or violent to be ""important"" and therefore unwatchable.  This movie is a needed postscript to Clueless and 90210 because it is effective in a way that typical rich kids are decadent and too fast for their own good movies such as Cruel Intentions can't get past nubile prettiness, expensive clothes and real estate for the audience to understand that their situation is terrible and wrong.",3,"ooh, la, la, la bamba meets the 21 Jump Street episode wherein Johnny Depp in hair net and khakis says ""Orale!"" constantly",1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,2240,"['Ritchie', 'Valens', 'wrong', 'side', 'CHICANO', 'side', 'LA', 'pretty', 'privileged', 'white', 'chick', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'song', 'how', 'precious', 'Lady', 'White', 'spirit', 'La', 'Bamba', 'film', 'insofar', 'are', 'supposed', 'understand', 'how', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'genuinely', 'shares', 'moment', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'characters', 'names', 'are', 'movie', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giacomo', 'Reese', 'Terminator', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'busty', 'loosey', 'goosey', 'teen', 'played', 'again', 'no', 'longer', 'teen', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'thank', 'doing', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'treating', 'thug', 'life', 'consumer', 'product.I', 'feel', 'so', 'sorry', 'young', 'looking', 'Hispanic', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'play', 'Ritchie', 'Valens', 'part', 'movie', 'complete', 'big', 'man', 'walk', 'think', 'even', 'did', 'cigarette', 'drag', 'unplug', 'are', 'tough', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'permitted', 'have', 'real', 'romance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'favored', 'close', 'ups', 'tears', 'standing', 'eyes', 'line', 'cheek', 'biting', 'down', 'back', 'teeth', 'moments', 'romantic', 'misunderstanding', 'movie', 'also', '40-something', 'year', 'old', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'surviving', 'marine', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Unfortunately', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'too', 'busy', 'doing', 'phone', 'card', 'commercials', 'Spanish', 'television', 'participate', 'amazing', 'film.Obviously', 'Socs', 'Pacific', 'Palisades', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'Sabor', 'Latino', 'think', 'sequel/crossover', 'called', 'where', 'Socs', 'bring', 'Southies', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting.p.s', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'sings', 'gangsta', 'moll', 'song', 'early', 'movie', 'lot', 'acting', 'eyes', 'movie', 'resembling', 'pretty', 'fit', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'not', 'terrible', 'not', 'too', 'heavy', 'embarassing', 'violent', 'be', 'important', 'therefore', 'unwatchable', 'movie', 'needed', 'postscript', 'Clueless', '90210', 'effective', 'way', 'typical', 'rich', 'kids', 'are', 'decadent', 'too', 'fast', 'own', 'good', 'movies', 'such', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'nubile', 'prettiness', 'expensive', 'clothes', 'real', 'estate', 'audience', 'understand', 'situation', 'terrible', 'wrong']",Havoc

In all honesty, this film should only have two stars, but for me it is a guilty pleasure.Daredevil & Kangeroo Jack are my two favorites.Havoc enters onto this list because its a film whose style changes with every scene. It's the first non-documentary film from Barbara Kopple and you can tell she's itching to document and not force life to do her bidding. And this ""hands off"" directing leads to things like Anne Hathaway's ""one take only"" acting.The way that the white kids are portrayed is comical and I believe intentionally so. I know I laughed at them in high school. They look and sound rediculous. Especially Anne Hathaway's ""come hither"" dance in the first party scene where she ""drops the n-bomb."" She's completely incapable of delivering those lines realistically. The party scenes throughout the film run parellels that are intriguing characterwise. Anne Hathaway drops her act and behaves like herself around Hector, while Bijou keeps it up and gets reprimanded.Joseph Gordon-Levitt once again shows his chops as an acting wonderchild with a fantastically comical performance. He is definately going to be a person to watch in the next ten years.The film is about facades and stereotypes and how people wear the masks created by others in order to feel true and real. Anne Hathaway's tri-romance between Mike Vogel, Bijou Philips and Freddy Rodriguez each satisfy and aspect of self that she is in crisis over. But none of them are fulfilling because of the walls that are set by those around them. I think it's one of the few films I've ever seen where a main character is forced to juggle three people at once.The scene where Anne confronts Mike the night after they go downtown was well done and pretty honest. Then the ""girls night"" immediately following is hysterically true as well.The documentary that Matt O'Leary's character is filming is a nice device and leads to some of the most important scenes in the film. He is the only character that is real and does not ""play the game."" But this may be an endorsement by Kopple that filmmakers are the only truthful people on the planet. My favorite scene is the one between Anne Hathaway and Matt O'Leary where he confronts her and starts to ask her questions she is to afraid to answer, she jumps from one facade to the next and attempts to ""seduce him"" but he wants her not the fake her and denies her ""advances."" It should be the crux of the film, but it falls flat because as an actress Anne Hathaway is incapable of playing all of those people.But! Its intentions are noble and the parents are brilliant. It's just to bad that they didn't tone it down and play it a lot straighter. It might have been a great film. They were just to busy marketing it to teenagers and not trying (ironically enough) to make it more cinema-veritae.

939887,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BBOUUE,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","If there is some justice to misjudging investments in movies, then the fact that this film went directly to DVD despite the presence of a crew that includes some impressive names is notable.  Writer Stephen Gaghan  ('Traffic', 'Rules of Engagement', 'Syriana', etc) has composed a contrived script about rich, bored, Hip Hop imitating, unmotivated teenagers trying to spice up their insignificant lives by treading into the East LA 'danger zone', an experience from which they learn nothing about cross cultural ethnic groups and just return to Pacific Palisades whining about 'damaged goods'.  It is an insulting story, one that stereotypes Hispanics as drug-peddling, raping thugs in a totally black and white manner, not taking into consideration the viewpoint of a cultural group's positive attributes and philosophies.No longer a viable gimmick, the film begins with the tired clich&eacute; of a kid making a documentary about his friends, asking what they like and don't like, their goals, their outlooks. The fact that none of the interviewees has a clue about life, preferring to follow the current Hip Hop language (very poorly written) and focusing on sex, drugs, and escapes from their wealthy environments. Among these are three girls, the main character being Allison (Anne Hathaway, miscast in every way), who follow their superficial boyfriends on a joyride for drugs into East LA. There they meet Hector (Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez, trying his best to create a character without the benefit of a decent script) who sells them drugs and whom Allison eyes. Allison is so shallow she doesn't have a clue about her motivations, just wanting something 'dangerous' to happen. She coaxes her equally clueless girlfriends into going into East LA to seduce Hector and ends up in a ridiculous barter for joining Hector's gang (no mention is made at all about the Chicanas who would never allow these three geeks to enter their territory unchallenged). The results of a barter results in an experience with which the girls cannot cope so they run back to the protection of the dysfunctional parents they loathe to cover the mess of their caper. Attempts to resolve this dumb story fail pathetically.With so many fine Indie films that go begging for attention, it is a shame money is wasted on this sort of meaningless mess of a film. The 'unrated' designation is probably meant for the occasional nudity and gratuitous sex and language, but here 'Unrated' might just mean that the film is so without merit that it is non-classifiable. Avoid this one and don't think that a fine writer such as Gaghan guarantees a successful story.

Her boyfriend and her think their big shots and do drugs and whatever.Then her boyfriend gets cheated by a Mexican drug dealer, the dealer, pulls out a gun and her boyfriend pees his pants!!!!Yes that's really edgy film-making..not!!! Again if you read this review and disagree then you're just ignoring the truth but I digress.(Spoilers don't read unless you want to know what will happen)Anyhow Hathaway's character is more of a rich slut than a troubled teen, she seems to get joy out of manipulating people along with her other fluzy friends.She's infatuated with the Mexican drug dealer, I guess becomes she digs his male machismo, and stuff and wants to get into his gang as does her white friend Emily.They get in sort of, but when it comes down to the ""initiation"" which entails banging the dude's friend, Allison backs out but her friend stays showing her exhibition desires. Anyhow she ridiculous cries rape later when in fact she had sex with one of the gang members.Allison at one point gets busted with the gang members but is bailed by her yuppie like parents who think the strictest punishment is to ""ground her"" (yeah that'll work for spoiled brat, how about taking away her cash and money).Allison finds out about Emily's ""rape"" but she betrays her friends and says it wasn't rape.Later near the last ten minutes her cowardly boyfriend gets his friends together and gets some firearms all the way videotaping the process (yes this guy has lettuce for brains) and planning revenge on the Mexican dealer from before and you can pretty much guess where it's headed after this.This movie as you can see if you have read by this point, is predictable, boring, and not at all ""edgy"" or ""intense"", I've seen so many of these wannabee gang movies, I could make my own and call myself a director.However, let's get a few positive in here. The acting for the most part (without the cussing) is pretty good, and Hathaway does take the role seriously which I imagine was a test given the laughable material she had to work and playing the brat, her ""friends"" in this movie were OK but none of them will win Oscars for their work here.The storyline is repetitive and it just seemed to drag on and on except when it got to the obvious gratuitous sex and violence. Overall though still it's a disappointment, I can't believe Roeper recommended it as it's not that good. The characters are not really unlikable nor sympathetic.But if you're a Hathaway fan, I'am sure you'll love it.

The funniest thing about Havoc is that it was made by Barbara Kopple who is well known for making quality documentaries, yet it feels so resoundingly and thoroughly fake throughout (and of course Stephen Gaghan is sort of the current reigning writing champion of real yet simultaneously somehow very fake, which I say as someone who quite liked Syriana).One really terrible decision (and I don't know whether to blame this on Gaghan or the original story) was to have a student making a movie about his fellow students in the movie. The idea was presumably supposed to be that it would allow for things/facts/themes to be said by the actors straight to the ""documentary"" camera that would have been difficult to establish quickly through dialogue but the result is a disaster where none of the people addressing the ""documentary"" seem to be coming from reality or talking like actual human beings.  The only payoff for this decision is a great scene where Hathaway torments the young male filmmaker by flaunting her sexuality in front of him but on the whole, it was not a good decision to use this device.As someone has already commented, the teens behaving badly scenes here are like slickly hollywoodized renditions of moments from Larry Clark's indie Kids (and note that Bijou Phillips also already appeared behaving badly in Clark's other kids behaving badly movie Bully); but then perhaps that's just a difference between New York and La La Land and perhaps this movie is a lot more real about L.A. than I know as an east coaster. The key to really enjoying Havoc is not to take it all that seriously and then you can have a very good time with it; try to think of it as an kind of overheated teen delinquency 50s-style melodrama. Hathaway is very pretty and tries hard with this movie; I admire her for taking the part and for gracing us with glimpses of her bared lovely skin. And some individual scenes are in fact pretty compelling or touching on their own, just in a rather exaggerated aftershool-special melodramatic way.

Allison's group is called PTC, and they get into a fight with another crew at the beginning of the film, and Allison is right in the middle, punching and kicking.After disposing of the rival crew, Allison's crew decides to try to buy some cocaine.  It is here that they run into Hector (Freddy Rodriguez) and his crew.  Toby buys the drugs from Hector, but Toby accuses him of gyping them.  A confrontation occurs between Hector and Toby, and Allison steps in at the last minute to save Toby from being shot.  Afterward, Toby retreats into himself, but Allison becomes intrigued with Hector and the entire gang culture.Allison and the girls decide to go to a party hosted by Hector, and they are soon drinking and fooling around with Hector and his friends.  Later on, Allison and Emily decide they want to join Hector's crew.  Hector tells them that they must roll dice, and the number that comes up is the number of crew members they must sleep with.  Allison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three.  Allison chooses Hector, and Emily chooses another member of the crew.  They go into a hotel room and begin making out.  After a few minutes, Allison breaks it off with Hector, but Emily keeps going.  Unfortunately for Emily, things get a little rough, and Allison comes in and saves her.Emily claims she was raped and decides to press charges against Hector and the others.  Arrests are made and Hector is taken into custody.  The other members of Hector's crew decide to go after Allison and Emily.

In many initial reviews, this movie was derided as being a joke. It was either hearing about the various nude scenes of Anne Hathaway or a bunch of white kids trying to act black, and doing it poorly.I said that that ""Fake"" was the first thing that came to mind, because we are immediately presented with this group of rich white kids acting like they are black. However, it is being mistaken by some reviewers that these actors are doing a bad job. What we are really seeing is truly how superficial that these kids are. They are fake, in every sense of the word, and that is the whole point of the movie. Don't try and act like something you aren't because there are consequences.I say this is a social commentary, not perfectly executed, but still fairly well done nonetheless. It does truly present many aspects of youth behavior nowadays that most people don't really look at. We are given a true side to high school, where there are fake people everywhere, underage and illegal activity is happening, and its all going on without parents there to see. This movie takes the comedy out of the teenage life that has been prevalent in movies over the past 8 years or so such as ""American Pie"" and other similar styled teen comedies and turns it to a sort of opposite view.Now I am not by any means saying that this movie is a guiding light which everyone should see. In fact, I don't know if this movie is for everyone, because of the issues it presents. Most parents, such as myself,  would undoubtedly have problems coming to terms that the behavior seen in this movie happens. Now it doesn't happen everywhere, or in every school, but I'm pretty sure that you know what I mean.This film is backed up by pretty well performed acting done by the majority of its cast. Anne Hathaway, who many doubted had the range to tackle such a role, seemed very natural in the part. I don't mean that negatively, and I actually give her credit for really becoming the character. The rest of the cast does a good job, but it is her performance that truly helps you understand most of the underlying message of the movie.I know that some won't view it the way I seen it, but to each is own.  I do hope that people see this movie and don't criticize it solely on what they think is bad acting. It has a much deeper theme than that, and I think that the more viewers understand that, the more people will realize the decency of the film.",3,"I tell ya, curiosity will sometimes get you into trouble.",1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,2532,"['watching', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'Wow', 'kids', 'sure', 'are', 'fake', 'many', 'initial', 'reviews', 'movie', 'was', 'derided', 'being', 'joke', 'was', 'either', 'hearing', 'various', 'nude', 'scenes', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'bunch', 'white', 'kids', 'trying', 'act', 'black', 'doing', 'poorly.I', 'said', 'Fake', 'was', 'first', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'are', 'immediately', 'presented', 'group', 'rich', 'white', 'kids', 'acting', 'are', 'black', 'However', 'being', 'mistaken', 'reviewers', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'bad', 'job', 'What', 'are', 'really', 'seeing', 'truly', 'how', 'superficial', 'kids', 'are', 'are', 'fake', 'sense', 'word', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'act', 'something', 'are', ""n't"", 'are', 'consequences.I', 'say', 'social', 'commentary', 'not', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'still', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'nonetheless', 'truly', 'present', 'many', 'aspects', 'youth', 'behavior', 'nowadays', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'are', 'given', 'true', 'side', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'are', 'fake', 'people', 'everywhere', 'underage', 'illegal', 'activity', 'happening', 'going', 'parents', 'there', 'see', 'movie', 'comedy', 'teenage', 'life', 'been', 'prevalent', 'movies', 'past', '8', 'years', 'so', 'such', 'American', 'Pie', 'other', 'similar', 'styled', 'teen', 'comedies', 'sort', 'opposite', 'view.Now', 'am', 'not', 'means', 'saying', 'movie', 'guiding', 'light', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'everyone', 'issues', 'Most', 'parents', 'such', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'have', 'problems', 'coming', 'terms', 'behavior', 'seen', 'movie', 'Now', ""n't"", 'happen', 'everywhere', 'school', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'mean.This', 'film', 'backed', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'performed', 'acting', 'done', 'majority', 'cast', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'many', 'doubted', 'had', 'range', 'tackle', 'role', 'seemed', 'very', 'natural', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'negatively', 'actually', 'give', 'credit', 'really', 'becoming', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'performance', 'truly', 'understand', 'most', 'underlying', 'message', 'movie.I', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'view', 'way', 'seen', 'own', 'do', 'hope', 'people', 'see', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'criticize', 'solely', 'what', 'think', 'bad', 'acting', 'much', 'deeper', 'theme', 'think', 'more', 'viewers', 'understand', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'realize', 'decency', 'film']",Havoc

I'll tell you what it's got to offer without spoiling it for you, but you should know better than to watch this.  I knew better from the first twenty minutes, but I watched the rest anyway.  Maybe that's why I felt the need to write this.  Hoping that writing this review will be cathartic.So what does Havoc have to offer?  There's a down side to spoil everything resembling a good point.Anne Hathaway is easy on the eyes.  However, you'll have to look past the silly actions taken by her character - the motivations of these are never reasonably explored.  Are privileged teens from affluent families really this irrational out of boredom?  Steven Soderburg did more to show a realistic portrait of this kind of downward spiral with Erika Christensen's character in Traffic.  So don't look to Havoc for realistic characters.The Beverly Hills guys are funny with their gangsta act, but their predictability gets tiresome.  They're all pretty much the same character (ie a stereotype of the white teenager trying to act gangsta).  The movie Whiteboyz covers this territory more ably.Moral panic inspiring scenes where teens engage in risky behavior are peppered throughout the movie.  They just aren't very well done.  These scenes seem to be played more for titillation than for realism or drama.  Gross.  These looked like pastiches of scenes from Larry Clark's 1995 movie Kids.  However, Havoc fails to project the same sickening nihilism that is found in Clark's movie.  And here is the ultimate problem with Havoc.  Like a B horror movie, it's not real enough to be scary.  What's the point then?The characters aren't interesting or realistically written.  The situations are flimsy contrivances.  Nothing surprising actually happens.  You'll have to watch Havoc yourself to make the call, though.

Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the ""PLC"" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the ""gangsta"" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive ""Rocca"" wear and and ""FUBU"" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the ""PLC"" without flinching.  Secondly, had four ""innocent"" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the ""PLC"" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, ""Havoc"" is a dud.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[2, 3]","As an effort to shake off her goody-goody image, Anne Hathaway starred in this so-so drama about a group of priveleged white teenagers who get in over their heads after getting mixed up with a gang from the other side of town.  The teenagers have their own gang, if you can call it that, called the PLC, which is basically an excuse for them to get dressed up in Ecko and Enyce, listen to hip hop music, and talk like they're from the ghetto.  Hathaway's character Alison says it best with the statement, ""We're just teenagers and we're bored.""  The gang they get involved with, 16th Street, isn't bored and it's not a game to them; it's a way of life.  It's easy to see why they don't take Alison and her friends seriously.As mentioned before Anne Hathaway gets naked. Woohoo! But so does Bijou Phillips.  The true hidden gem of this film is the spectacularly bad acting of Phillips as Hathaway's best friend. I mean, this is the same girl who has starred in such splendid films as Bully and Tart. Quite frankly, everything Bijou Phillips is in turns to garbage, and I love her for it.As an effort to shed her good girl image, Hathaway struck gold with this movie. But the cost was to have her name attached to vapid, self-indulgent tripe that rivals Crash in its efforts to convince you that the world is just black and white, racist and nonracist, rich and poor.

939905,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B000BBOUUE,LadyLestat,"[4, 8]","First of all, I love Anne Hathaway, and it was very refreshing to see her in another role besides another Walt Disney movie. However, What the hell was she thinking? She needs to go find her agent and fire him immediately because movies like this can be career suicide. On a positive note, I must say it does in fact prove not only does Anne have the acting chops, but she isn't a one dimensional actress. I really don't wanna see her waste her talent by getting sucked into the one genre gene pool, and never being able to breakaway from it. However, this movie was intentionally a mockery of the Hip-Hop culture. Now, this is only my opinion, but being raised in the Hip-Hop community, I thought it was not only insulting, but ridiculous watching a whole bunch of bored, rich, surburban, pathetic, wanna-be black/white kids walking, talking and acting black. Frankly, I thought it was making fun of the whole culture in general. Don't get me wrong, I have a sense of humor, but what started off as funny ended up being a bit stereotypical. Come on, Bijou Philips had the most predictable role of all. First of all, let me just say that contrary to a lot of other reviews, she's not raped by the 2 Latin guys. Correction, she got a train run on her by the 2 Latin guys. There's a big difference between the 2 sexual acts. They didn't hold her down and force her to do it. Frankly, she got caught up in a freaky threesome where she invited both men to sleep with her, and right in the middle of the action she decides that she's had a brain fart, or a momentary lapse in judgement, snaps out of it, and all of a sudden doesn't wanna do it anymore. Then, she starts screaming and crying bloody murder like she's just been taken advantage of....PUHLEEZE! I didn't feel sorry for her one bit. Anybody who saw that scene as more than that should rewind the tape, or start the scene over on the DVD. Come on, let's assume we're all grown here, so there's no need to play games we all know what time it is. My bad, even if you aren't grown, let's just assume we all have common sense for a second. If you invite another man into your bed while you're already having sex with one, you better be sure about what comes next. I mean was anybody really surprised when she accused the Latin guys of rape when she asked for it...I think not. I saw that scenario coming a mile away. On top of that, these kids are so bored that they travel from the suburbs to the slums of East L.A were there are nothing but Hispanics, drugs and gang wars. Then, they become mesmerized by this lifestyle like it's actually a good thing when they are way in over their heads. Anyway, they go down there showing and proving they are ready and willing to do anything to fit in. I'm sorry, but I saw the stereotypes that were running rapid in this movie. I am not a race card throwing person, but I just have to explain the movie for what it was, or at least how I saw it. Maybe, I did miss the point of the film, but this is just my opinion. Really, we've seen this a thousand times. Come on, rich white kids, with too much money and time on their hands, no parental guidance, looking for action, getting tangled up with wrong crowds or minorities, getting into more trouble than they can handle, a white girl accuses somebody of rape (usually a black man) in this case, a Hispanic man, and as a result of the lie people have to die. I've seen (and heard) this story too many times to impressed. I'm sorry, but none of these nationalites were displayed in a positive light. To me, that's not entertainment.

939906,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BBOUUE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[95, 104]","When I saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" I thought that was the film in which Anne Hathaway made it clear she was not going to be doing any more princess movies for Disney by dong a nude scene.  But then I discovered that after making her second princess movie and then doing vocal work for ""Hoodwinked,"" Hathaway made ""Havoc"" and went from PG to R without a transitional PG-13 movie (okay, unrated in terms of the DVD, but R in the theater).  I heard that Mandy Moore was originally cast as the lead for this film and I have to wonder if she bailed given what the role required or if they changed the script to give it this ""harder"" edge that it has now.  Putting in deleted scenes to justify labeling it as unrated might increase the word of mouth about the film, but it did not improve it in any way that will impress anybody with a more than prurient interest in the festivities.Hathaway plays Allison Lang, a bored high school student who lives in an affluent part of Los Angeles.  Along with her boy friend, Toby (Mike Vogel), best friend, Emily (Bijou Phillips), and everybody else in her group, Allison talks and dresses like bone fida members of the gangster culture from the music they listen to.  They strike us as being pretty sad and pathetic, a judgment that is amply underscored when Toby tries to score some crack cocaine in East L.A. and is brought all the way down to the ground by Hector (Freddie Rodriguez, who does a much better job of getting beyond his role on ""Six Feet Under"" to impress viewers).  If not for Allison's intervention Toby and everybody else in their car might have ended up dead.  After this encounter Toby retreats into bravado, while Allison, having seen the real thing, responds to the danger.  She drags Em along for the fun, and keeps pushing things with Hector and his gang until they come to a head.The story here can be traced back to a spec script called ""Powers That Be"" that Jessica Kaplan sold in 1995 when she was still a teenager.  Kaplan, who based the screenplay on her experiences in high school were her white friends were caught up in imitating gangster culture, died in the crash of a small plane in Los Angeles in 2003 (the film is dedicated to her).  Stephen Gaghan revised the story and finished the screenplay, so he ends up being responsible for what we have seen.  The idea of telling a story about these characters is certainly worth pursuing.  I can remember chaperoning a prom and watching a bunch of white girls standing together on the dance floor singing along to rap songs and thinking that it would be hard for them to be removed much farther from the culture they were imitating.The flaw with ""Havoc"" is rather interesting.  It constructs a situation so that when Allison and Em agree to be initiated into Hector's gang that you know this is going to get bad.  What follows makes it clear things are going to go so far beyond bad that you have to face down an impulse to stop the movie before you get to the really bad part.  But then ""Havoc"" backs off and after an initial sense of relief you realize this is a movie that was made with the safety on, which puts us in the ""no guts, no glory"" territory.  Ironically, what derails the movie is a scene that shows the best part of what is going on is the relationship between Allison and Em, even though it does not always seem like this is a good thing.  Ultimately the only sympathetic character is Eric (Matt O'Leary), whose omnipresent camcorder distances him from the rest of the group, but who is able to make a pointed remark that surprisingly hits home for Allison.Those who check out this film because of Hathaway's nude scenes will find something similar in the scene where she is being filmed by Eric where things get rather interesting and then the off switch is hit.  Basically, that is what this movie does.  It plays a game of chicken with cold harsh reality and then it yanks the wheel hard and quick so it can paste together a ""happy"" ending before the credits role.  I can appreciate Hathaway's reasons for taking this job, but her character of Allison ends up proves to be guilty of slumming, and not even first-rate slumming at that.  That makes the nudity and profanity somewhat gratuitous, all things considered.",3,"Allison might talk the talk, but she and her friends can't walk the walk",1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,4248,"['When', 'saw', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'thought', 'was', 'film', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'doing', 'more', 'princess', 'movies', 'Disney', 'dong', 'nude', 'scene', 'then', 'discovered', 'making', 'second', 'princess', 'movie', 'then', 'doing', 'vocal', 'work', 'Hoodwinked', 'Hathaway', 'made', 'Havoc', 'went', 'PG', 'R', 'transitional', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'okay', 'unrated', 'terms', 'DVD', 'R', 'theater', 'heard', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'was', 'originally', 'cast', 'lead', 'film', 'have', 'wonder', 'bailed', 'given', 'what', 'role', 'required', 'changed', 'script', 'give', 'harder', 'edge', 'now', 'Putting', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'justify', 'labeling', 'unrated', 'might', 'increase', 'word', 'mouth', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'improve', 'way', 'will', 'impress', 'anybody', 'more', 'prurient', 'interest', 'festivities.Hathaway', 'Allison', 'Lang', 'bored', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'affluent', 'part', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'boy', 'friend', 'Toby', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'best', 'friend', 'Emily', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'everybody', 'else', 'group', 'Allison', 'talks', 'dresses', 'bone', 'fida', 'members', 'gangster', 'culture', 'music', 'listen', 'strike', 'being', 'pretty', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'judgment', 'amply', 'underscored', 'when', 'Toby', 'score', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'East', 'L.A.', 'brought', 'way', 'ground', 'Hector', 'Freddie', 'Rodriguez', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'getting', 'role', 'Six', 'Feet', 'impress', 'viewers', 'not', 'Allison', 'intervention', 'Toby', 'everybody', 'else', 'car', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'dead', 'encounter', 'Toby', 'bravado', 'Allison', 'having', 'seen', 'real', 'thing', 'danger', 'Em', 'fun', 'pushing', 'things', 'Hector', 'gang', 'come', 'head.The', 'story', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'spec', 'script', 'called', 'Powers', 'Be', 'Jessica', 'Kaplan', 'sold', '1995', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'teenager', 'Kaplan', 'who', 'based', 'screenplay', 'experiences', 'high', 'school', 'were', 'white', 'friends', 'were', 'caught', 'up', 'imitating', 'gangster', 'culture', 'died', 'crash', 'small', 'plane', 'Los', 'Angeles', '2003', 'film', 'dedicated', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'revised', 'story', 'finished', 'screenplay', 'up', 'being', 'responsible', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'idea', 'telling', 'story', 'characters', 'certainly', 'worth', 'pursuing', 'can', 'remember', 'chaperoning', 'prom', 'watching', 'bunch', 'white', 'girls', 'standing', 'together', 'dance', 'floor', 'singing', 'along', 'rap', 'songs', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'be', 'removed', 'much', 'farther', 'culture', 'were', 'imitating.The', 'flaw', 'Havoc', 'rather', 'interesting', 'situation', 'so', 'when', 'Allison', 'Em', 'agree', 'be', 'initiated', 'Hector', 'gang', 'know', 'going', 'get', 'bad', 'What', 'clear', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'bad', 'have', 'face', 'down', 'impulse', 'stop', 'movie', 'get', 'really', 'bad', 'part', 'then', 'Havoc', 'initial', 'sense', 'relief', 'realize', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'safety', 'guts', 'glory', 'territory', 'Ironically', 'what', 'movie', 'scene', 'best', 'part', 'what', 'going', 'relationship', 'Allison', 'Em', 'even', 'not', 'always', 'seem', 'good', 'thing', 'Ultimately', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Eric', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'omnipresent', 'camcorder', 'distances', 'rest', 'group', 'who', 'able', 'make', 'pointed', 'remark', 'surprisingly', 'home', 'Allison.Those', 'who', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'Hathaway', 'nude', 'scenes', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'similar', 'scene', 'where', 'being', 'filmed', 'Eric', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'rather', 'interesting', 'then', 'off', 'switch', 'hit', 'Basically', 'what', 'movie', 'game', 'chicken', 'cold', 'harsh', 'reality', 'then', 'wheel', 'hard', 'quick', 'can', 'paste', 'together', 'happy', 'ending', 'credits', 'role', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Hathaway', 'reasons', 'taking', 'job', 'character', 'Allison', 'up', 'proves', 'be', 'guilty', 'slumming', 'not', 'even', 'first-rate', 'slumming', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'somewhat', 'gratuitous', 'things', 'considered']",Havoc

In the beginning it gives an almost comedic look at a bunch of rich white kids trying to be Gangsta and prove how tough they are. It is set as a documentary that one of the nerdy kids from the high school is making about the group. Reality hits them in the face when they encounter real gang members in East LA.While much is made about the fact that Anne Hathaway was topless often in this movie, I think what you can take away from this is that she did have acting talent. No the movie itself is not great, but she transitioned from the fake gangsta, to the normal teenage girl who was much smarter than she let on, to being dangerously drawn to a world she really knew nothing about. And you could buy those transitions and believe that she could be all of those things. There were certainly some cliches in the film, and there is nothing in it that has not been done before, but I do think it worked for what it was.While her performance stood out, I think the other one was actually by the kid who was making the documentary. I think he was a little too mature for a high school kid, but he did play the detached observer well.

This unrated version adds 8 minutes to the original 85, but we can only guess what's been added.  My guess is that we get to see more naughty parts.  Anne Hathaway leaves her princess image behind as a spoiled rich girl from Pacific Palisades, California who becomes easily bored fellating her boyfriend (Mike Vogel) and seeks out a wilder scene in east L. A.With Toby (Vogel), her best friend Emily (Bijou Phillips) and her wacked out boyfriend Sam (Joseph Gorden-Levitt) they decide to go downtown to score some pot.  While cruising the neighborhood they come across some Latino gang-bangers headed by Hector (Freddy Rodriguez).  Toby, in his white-boy version of Lil' Wayne, decides to confront Hector because he thought his score was a bit light.  That doesn't go well for Toby and his tough guy cred is threatened.Allison (Hathaway) saves her boyfriend's ass by begging Hector not to shoot him.  At the same time she's exhilarating by the experience and perhaps by Hector.  She returns to the scene a couple more times with just her girlfriends.  The final time it is just her and Emily.  They crash the crew's crib which is in a seedy motel and after a little booze and reefer insist on joining Hector's gang.  The price of admission is having sex with as many of the gang as the roll of a die determines.  Allison rolls an ace and goes for Hector.  Emily rolls a three, but decides she can handle it.  She can't.Allison manages to leave with Emily but days later Emily decides to file rape charges.  This doesn't sit well with Allison.  Essentially they got what they asked for.  The film flits back and forth between the streets of east L. A. and the upper crust life of the white teens.  The distinctions are sharp but perhaps not as much as it could have been.  The Latinos have families, children and tradition and in daytime scenes seem perfectly happy.  Allison's family includes a mother just out of rehab and a workaholic father who is never home.The heart of the story itself is hard to buy, and maybe it happens.  But I don't know many people who would cruise east L. A. at night flaunting their classic Chevy convertible sporting their bejeweled whiteness.  I mean really.  That being said, Hathaway and Phillips are pretty damn good in their roles and give the audience an early look at their ta-tas.  The film doesn't have a tidy ending which may upset some.

I also didn't appreciate the ending very much because it makes it seem like the movie was completely pointless.

Freddy Rodriguez (Six Feet Under, Harsh Times) is here as their leader (along with Raymond Cruz, once again cast to type), to whom there is an immediate attraction with Hathaway, but as things develop and turn foul, everyone gets a real lesson in the ""thug life"".  From the minute it starts, Havoc is ripe for the kind of social satire that could be derived from the suburban white kid gangsta wannabe world, but Oscar winners Stephen Gaghan and Barbara Kopple try to make it into a morality tale, and it doesn't work.

I see it as a tragic romance about a couple drawn to each other because of the novelty value they see in each other's socio-economic class, and ultimately pulled apart because of their refusal to see their own class as a novelty. Allison wanted to hang out with Hector but still be treated as an adorable princess. Hector wanted to hang out with Allison but still be treated as an intimidating gangsta. They both compromised a bit, but Hector was already losing respect from his peers for letting her hang out in his neighborhood, and eventually she forced his hand by not taking his gang seriously in front of his peers, and he did what he had to to maintain their respect, treated her the way his culture says he's supposed to treat women.There was a little bit of empty space in this movie, and extra details that served to detract as often as add, but the juxtaposition and interaction between Allison and Hector shows there's a lot more to them than the gangsta and the poser that most viewers seem to want to reduce them to. I saw both of them as defined by their desire to be more than their culture would allow.The idea that this movie was trying to document gangsta culture or faux-gangsta culture as though it's a new idea never occured to me because it's so obviously not and nothing in the film hinted at ambitions in that direction.

This begs the question: if gangsta wannabes are deeply annoying in real life, why would anyone want to watch an hour-and-a-half movie about them?

Levitt, at least, seems to be having some fun with his character, while all the other white males come off as Eminem wannabes, the Hispanics in the movie are all walking stereotypes, and the women are there to provide supporting material-- even though two of them (Hathaway and Bijou Phillips) are in the lead roles.I'm not sure why I haven't learned yet; I haven't liked a Stephen Gaghan screenplay since Rules of Engagement seven years ago. Maybe this will finally be enough to convince me he's the screenwriting equivalent of post-1990 Joel Schumacher. *",2,"Lacks... almost everything, really.",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1410,"['Havoc', 'Barbara', 'Kopple', '2005', 'Havoc', 'oddly', 'unenviable', 'position', 'being', 'character-driven', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'survive', 'plot', 'end', 'result', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'sometimes', 'intriguing', 'not', 'enough', 'battle', 'boredom', 'rest', 'movie', 'running', 'time.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'character-driven', 'movie', 'what', 'bunch', 'gangsta', 'wannabes', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'real', 'East', 'LA', 'drug', 'dealer', 'question', 'gangsta', 'wannabes', 'are', 'deeply', 'annoying', 'real', 'life', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'watch', 'hour-and-a-half', 'movie', 'Even', 'prodigious', 'acting', 'talent', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'toplessness', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'perhaps', 'only', 'two', 'interesting', 'things', 'movie', 'get', 'nearly', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'Levitt', 'least', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'character', 'other', 'white', 'males', 'come', 'off', 'Eminem', 'wannabes', 'Hispanics', 'movie', 'are', 'walking', 'stereotypes', 'women', 'are', 'there', 'provide', 'supporting', 'material', 'even', 'two', 'Hathaway', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'are', 'lead', 'roles.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'learned', 'yet', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'screenplay', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'Maybe', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'enough', 'convince', 'screenwriting', 'equivalent', 'post-1990', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', '*']",Havoc

She is a disaffected teen looking for something that will make her believe in life. Her parents fight with one another, which has caused her to distrust relationships of any sort. She has sex with fellow teen Toby, though she refuses to label him ""boyfriend."" She thinks she might be in love with her best friend, Emily (Bijou Phillips), though she has yet to determine what love is. The crowd with which she hangs out doesn't help either; they are ""wiggers:"" white teens who want to live the lives of the gangsta rap they so idolize. While this identity confusion is annoying, it does provide the impetus for taking the group to East L.A., where they seek drugs and gang membership. If this sounds ludicrous, that is because it is. Whether or not it is common for wealthy, very attractive girls to head to the other side of the tracks and engage in sex with drug dealers in order to become gang members is unknown to me because I belong to neither group. However implausible it sounds, it does make for an unusual and fairly interesting film. There are some decent moments in this film and tension certainly builds, though a few things kept it from being good. The bored white teens from Pacific Palisades are supposedly from wealthy families, but there isn't much shown to suggest that. Perhaps the film's budget was very limited because the ending is also truncated to a point of being ambiguous. What are the fates of Toby and Emily? Nonetheless, Anne Hathaway does a very good job in her role as Allison and she proves with this role that she is capable of carrying a movie.

939933,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000BBOUUE,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 2]","I just watched this movie last night and I cannot recall the last time my mouth was gaped for such a long period of time.  My jaw being ajar wasn't due to the fact that I was so taken by the story.  I was in disarray due to how unintentionally hilarious the film was. I will say that the soundtrack is good for the film.  In addition, the score was done by the amazing Cliff Martinez.I will keep plot description to a minimum; Anne Hathaway plays Allison a spoiled, stuck up, privileged and ""wannabe thug"".  She runs the streets with all her poser white ""gangsta- thug friends"".  All of her friends and her (sort of) boyfriend are as cheesy and fake as she is.  The interesting and funny part is that Allison (Anne Hathaway) and her friends are high school students that are anything but thugs.  They are living in posh homes, driving very expensive cars and wearing top designer clothing, they definitely are not ""roughing it"".A scene early on in the film pretty much sets the ground work for the rest of the motion picture.  There is a character; I don't even know what his name was, who is making this documentary of Allison's life.  Why he is making it is never truly revealed, interest in culture or film making and/or he is just smitten with Allison, a loose end that is never addressed.  Digressing, he is shooting footage of Allison at a party, who is dancing with her (sort of) boyfriend and she says (the quote I used as the title of this review) that she and all of her posse are bored...out of their minds.  This boredom really leads this group of adolescents astray.  From the bad parts of downtown Los Angeles, to running with real gang members, fights, the police, drug/alcohol use, grapples with parents and not being able to identify with oneself.It sounds like the framework for a gripping and candid look of a particular demographic in southern California, well yes and no.  I will give praise to some of the story and even the acting.  I give Hathaway credit for choosing a role, at that moment in her career, was totally different from anything else she had done.  Hathaway had a potty mouth, had an edge, went topless a couple of times and even did a scene where her character masturbated.  Nevertheless, I still felt dubious and indifferent about her character.  Perhaps that was the point, but it is difficult for me to care about a movie when I have no investment in any characters, especially the (supposed) protagonist.I use to work with teenage boys and girls in a substance abuse/mental health program and some of the behavior in this film was dead on with the population I was working with.  In contrast, some of the performances were so bad that I thought I was watching a satire.  I just kept waiting for Leslie Nelson to walk on for a cameo. I also was very surprise that Allison hadn't met more problems given her behavior, especially involving Freddy Rodriguez's character.At the end of the day I found this film to be rather pointless, with unlikeable characters and too many loose ends.  I realize the film was trying to mimic life, but in this exercise ""try"" is a four letter word.  The film also serves as a wonderful PSA of ""how to not raise your children"" (Michael Biehn plays Allison's father). If you want to laugh at an unintentional comedy, this might be your movie. I don't totally view Anne Hathaway as one trick pony any more, despite the fact that her performance wasn't amazing and watching her speak in ""gangsta tongue"" was a bit hysterical.  For those people out there who are just itching to see Hathaway topless, well she has three scenes in this movie, knock yourself out.

939936,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BBOUUE,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","Brief summery of ""Havoc"" would be like this. Two bored, rich, white teenagers Alliaon and Emily get attracted to the Latino gangsters in East LA. You don't have to think hard to figure out the results of their behaviors, and actually ""Havoc"" has little to say about anything after all. Familiar plot devices such as their rebellious high school boyfriends and a timid, quiet kid making a documentary film do not help, nor the clich&eacute;d images of the teenagers and their parents living in suburbia. Despite the good acting of Freddy Rodriguez as Hector, to whom our heroine is romantically attracted, the Latino characters are little better than stereotypes.In fact the film could have been a great social commentary or a riveting drama with better characters (and the screenplay is written by Stephen Gaghan, ""Syriana""). It is extremely difficult to show a couple of spoiled, affluent teenagers without making us feel ""So why should we care?"" and ""Havoc"" seems to need someone who can fix this problem. It may not be your cup of tea, but ""Thirteen"" did a better job with equally annoying, but more round characters.What makes ""Havoc"" special is the presence of young stars including Anne Hathaway, Bijou Phillips, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Freddy Rodriguez. It is true that Anne Hathaway disrobes herself, but those """"topless"" scenes are nothing pornographic; however, it is also true that the film could be without them from the beginning.
