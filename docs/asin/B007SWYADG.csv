It was a bit distracting but after actually doing it, you don't notice. I really like it. I do Phyisque 57 and Booty Barre as my main barre workouts and this is a nice addition. Highly recommend. Time flew by doing these. They really work you and tone you.

1537549,A31V9NOMBWPFWS,B007SWYADG,Imara219,"[27, 29]","After spending time doing Turbo Fire and Brazil Butt Lift, I wanted a workout that would be tough but still lower body based. After popping in Original Butt dvd I was so excited. Time actually flew by, the movements were intense without having to do big movements. I was sweating because you can feel the muscle being fatigued. I tried to do perfect form and so I was slightly slower than the instructors but I preferred that to moving too quickly. It was a great burn and fun. Perfect addition to my BBL and TF workouts. I can't want to do a hybrid for the other systems and it made me a fan of ballet barre workouts.Update: Yesterday I did the Cardio Butt School dvd. It was intense but fun and moves flowed nicely from one routine to the other. The triceps section killed my arms but I could feel the burn in my thighs and butt. My muscles were definitely tighter. Today I did the Original Butt School. I felt that the pace was slightly slower (55mins instead of the 40mins from Butt School). The intensity seemed kicked up a notch as the increments and movements increased. My legs were shaking during several points in the dvd and it was difficult remembering to lift, hold, move an inch, pull in, etc. Those small details made the workout harder. All in all I fell in love with Butt School, I fell in like Original Butt, and my next update will be Hardcore.11/12/12 Update: I did all three workouts consistently for a month and my waist decreased by 2'inches within a week of rotating the works. I focused heavily on the Hard Core and Original Butt for a solid week and half and then integrated the Cardio Butt steadily. My thighs slimmed down considerably, I dropped 5lbs, my body looked leaner and I could feel my abs tighten into stronger muscles. My arms were even more toned than they were from Turbo Fire. I took a break but I'm using this series again because it did the impossible. I lost weight, toned up, and became lean. My body looked like a dream and my hubby couldn't stop looking.6/18/13 Update: Each time I do this series I end up with awesome results. I just finished my 2nd rotation. I have now added Element: Ballet Conditioning and Ellen Bowers Ballet Beautiful series. A year ago, I alternated the Pop Physique workouts every other day, for example, Orig Butt was Monday and Wednesday, Hard Core was Tuesday and Thursday and Pop Cardio was Friday and Saturday. I did this schedule for two weeks and then moved to doing the full workouts twice/three times a week.After a long hiatus and some weight gain, this past April I decided to get back into the rotation and I had a different schedule with different results. I lost 8 lbs, and two inches in my thighs and booty. Week one I alternated the DVDs and paired the DVDs with different Yoga workouts. Week 2 I alternated the DVDs with Ballet toning and conditioning. Week 3 I alternated the DVDs adding cardio. Week 4 combo of toning and cardio. The results, I'm curvy woman with a compact frame and my thighs are more muscular.",5,Wonderful,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,3003,"['spending', 'time', 'doing', 'Turbo', 'Fire', 'Brazil', 'Butt', 'Lift', 'wanted', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'still', 'lower', 'body', 'based', 'popping', 'Original', 'Butt', 'dvd', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'Time', 'actually', 'flew', 'movements', 'were', 'intense', 'having', 'do', 'big', 'movements', 'was', 'sweating', 'can', 'feel', 'muscle', 'being', 'fatigued', 'tried', 'do', 'perfect', 'form', 'so', 'was', 'slightly', 'slower', 'instructors', 'preferred', 'moving', 'too', 'quickly', 'was', 'great', 'burn', 'fun', 'Perfect', 'addition', 'BBL', 'TF', 'workouts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'hybrid', 'other', 'systems', 'made', 'fan', 'ballet', 'barre', 'workouts.Update', 'Yesterday', 'did', 'Cardio', 'Butt', 'School', 'dvd', 'was', 'intense', 'fun', 'moves', 'flowed', 'nicely', 'one', 'routine', 'other', 'triceps', 'section', 'killed', 'arms', 'could', 'feel', 'burn', 'thighs', 'butt', 'muscles', 'were', 'definitely', 'tighter', 'Today', 'did', 'Original', 'Butt', 'School', 'felt', 'pace', 'was', 'slightly', 'slower', '55mins', 'instead', '40mins', 'Butt', 'School', 'intensity', 'seemed', 'kicked', 'up', 'notch', 'increments', 'movements', 'increased', 'legs', 'were', 'shaking', 'several', 'points', 'dvd', 'was', 'difficult', 'remembering', 'lift', 'hold', 'move', 'inch', 'pull', 'etc', 'small', 'details', 'made', 'workout', 'harder', 'fell', 'love', 'Butt', 'School', 'fell', 'Original', 'Butt', 'next', 'update', 'will', 'be', 'Hardcore.11/12/12', 'Update', 'did', 'three', 'workouts', 'consistently', 'month', 'waist', 'decreased', ""2'inches"", 'week', 'rotating', 'works', 'focused', 'heavily', 'Hard', 'Core', 'Original', 'Butt', 'solid', 'week', 'half', 'then', 'integrated', 'Cardio', 'Butt', 'steadily', 'thighs', 'slimmed', 'down', 'considerably', 'dropped', '5lbs', 'body', 'looked', 'leaner', 'could', 'feel', 'abs', 'tighten', 'stronger', 'muscles', 'arms', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'toned', 'were', 'Turbo', 'Fire', 'took', 'break', ""'m"", 'using', 'series', 'again', 'did', 'impossible', 'lost', 'weight', 'toned', 'up', 'became', 'lean', 'body', 'looked', 'dream', 'hubby', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'looking.6/18/13', 'Update', 'time', 'do', 'series', 'end', 'up', 'awesome', 'results', 'just', 'finished', '2nd', 'rotation', 'have', 'now', 'added', 'Element', 'Ballet', 'Conditioning', 'Ellen', 'Bowers', 'Ballet', 'Beautiful', 'series', 'year', 'ago', 'alternated', 'Pop', 'Physique', 'workouts', 'other', 'day', 'example', 'Orig', 'Butt', 'was', 'Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Hard', 'Core', 'was', 'Tuesday', 'Thursday', 'Pop', 'Cardio', 'was', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'did', 'schedule', 'two', 'weeks', 'then', 'moved', 'doing', 'full', 'workouts', 'twice/three', 'times', 'week.After', 'long', 'hiatus', 'weight', 'gain', 'past', 'April', 'decided', 'get', 'back', 'rotation', 'had', 'different', 'schedule', 'different', 'results', 'lost', '8', 'lbs', 'two', 'inches', 'thighs', 'booty', 'one', 'alternated', 'DVDs', 'paired', 'DVDs', 'different', 'Yoga', 'workouts', '2', 'alternated', 'DVDs', 'Ballet', 'toning', 'conditioning', 'Week', '3', 'alternated', 'DVDs', 'adding', 'cardio', 'Week', '4', 'combo', 'toning', 'cardio', 'results', ""'m"", 'curvy', 'woman', 'compact', 'frame', 'thighs', 'are', 'more', 'muscular']",N/A
1537550,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B007SWYADG,Leanne,"[44, 46]","I just recently heard about these DVDs on the Video Fitness forum, where folks were saying that these were a lot of fun.  Since I've been looking to change up my workouts a bit, I thought I'd order these, and so far I like them!The first one I used was Original Butt, and it was a lot harder than I thought it would be.  Many of the moves remind me of the Physique 57 workouts, where you do the move with a small range of motion (one inch in either direction).  Even though the title is Original Butt, you'll work your whole body with this one. My legs and arms were shaking throughout the workout.  I know I didn't come close to burning the 500 calories that the DVD cover claims you will, but I got a nice toning workout from it.  The instructor's form pointers were useful, and she seems to know exactly when and where you might be about to give up on an exercise.  The outfits that the three women are wearing are a bit too much like lingerie, but I was prepared for this and it wasn't that distracting.  The music was low-key but good.  I started getting a little bored towards the end of the leg segment, but then the instructor moved on to abs/core.My barre/ballet DVD collection consists of both Physique 57 series, Xtend Barre Lean and Chiseled, Rockin Models, the Booty Barre workouts, all of the Squeeze workouts, some Core Fusion DVDs, the original Callanetics, and the Ballet Body workouts. The Pop workouts remind me most of the P57 series in that both use similar exercises and a small range of motion.  These Pop workouts add some nice variety to my DVD collection; while some of the exercises are ones I've seen in other DVDs, there are enough unique moves in this Pop set to make me glad that I purchased it. I would say Original Butt and Cardio Butt School are at the intermediate level, and Hardcore is advanced.I will update my review as I do (not just preview) the other two DVDs in this series. So far, these seem like a fun, contemporary take on barre workouts.UPDATE ON 5/24/12: I just got done doing Cardio Butt School for the first time, and loved this one!  It's a shorter workout (about 40 minutes) and it's taught by the two main instructors, who switch off teaching half-way through.  The time flew by with this one, and, even though it's shorter, I felt like my entire body was worked.  Next up: trying Hardcore!UPDATE ON 5/27/12:  I just got done doing Hardcore, and it's definitely the hardest of the three, but it's also a lot of fun!  The seat dancing section at the end just about slayed me, and I noticed at one point during the pretzel combo that the instructor was shaking so hard that I thought she was going to give out.  The music in this one is really good, and it keeps you going through all the tough sets.  The outfits in this one are also probably the slinkiest.Overall, I really like these workouts, and am going to use them in a rotation for a few weeks.  The music is fun, and there is good energy in all three of them!UPDATE ON 5/30/12:  For the last ten days, I've been alternating these Pop Physique workouts with Sylwia Weisenbeg'sSylwia Wiesenberg's Tonique Premier DVDandTonique 2 Fitness Workout - Sylwia Wiesenberg DVDworkouts, and my legs have really started to slim down.  It's a pretty intense combo, but if you're looking to slim down your legs and rear end (which are my trouble spots), then I'd give it a shot.  I think I'll only be able to keep this up for a few weeks since my legs have been feeling really heavy, but, in the meantime, I'm gaining nice definition and toning up.",4,Fun barre workouts,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,3545,"['just', 'recently', 'heard', 'DVDs', 'Video', 'Fitness', 'forum', 'where', 'folks', 'were', 'saying', 'were', 'lot', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'change', 'up', 'workouts', 'bit', 'thought', ""'d"", 'order', 'so', 'far', 'like', 'first', 'one', 'used', 'was', 'Original', 'Butt', 'was', 'lot', 'harder', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Many', 'moves', 'remind', 'Physique', '57', 'workouts', 'where', 'do', 'move', 'small', 'range', 'motion', 'one', 'inch', 'direction', 'Even', 'title', 'Original', 'Butt', ""'ll"", 'work', 'whole', 'body', 'one', 'legs', 'arms', 'were', 'shaking', 'workout', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'burning', '500', 'calories', 'DVD', 'cover', 'claims', 'will', 'got', 'nice', 'toning', 'workout', 'instructor', 'form', 'pointers', 'were', 'useful', 'know', 'exactly', 'when', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'give', 'up', 'exercise', 'outfits', 'three', 'women', 'are', 'wearing', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'lingerie', 'was', 'prepared', 'was', ""n't"", 'distracting', 'music', 'was', 'low-key', 'good', 'started', 'getting', 'little', 'bored', 'end', 'leg', 'segment', 'then', 'instructor', 'moved', 'abs/core.My', 'barre/ballet', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Physique', '57', 'series', 'Xtend', 'Barre', 'Lean', 'Chiseled', 'Rockin', 'Models', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'workouts', 'Squeeze', 'workouts', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'DVDs', 'original', 'Callanetics', 'Ballet', 'Body', 'Pop', 'remind', 'most', 'P57', 'series', 'use', 'similar', 'exercises', 'small', 'range', 'motion', 'Pop', 'workouts', 'add', 'nice', 'variety', 'DVD', 'collection', 'exercises', 'are', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'DVDs', 'are', 'enough', 'unique', 'moves', 'Pop', 'set', 'make', 'glad', 'purchased', 'would', 'say', 'Original', 'Butt', 'Cardio', 'Butt', 'School', 'are', 'intermediate', 'level', 'Hardcore', 'advanced.I', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'preview', 'other', 'two', 'DVDs', 'series', 'So', 'far', 'seem', 'fun', 'contemporary', 'take', 'barre', 'workouts.UPDATE', 'ON', '5/24/12', 'just', 'got', 'done', 'doing', 'Cardio', 'Butt', 'School', 'first', 'time', 'loved', 'one', 'shorter', 'workout', '40', 'minutes', 'taught', 'two', 'main', 'instructors', 'who', 'switch', 'off', 'teaching', 'half-way', 'time', 'flew', 'one', 'even', 'shorter', 'felt', 'entire', 'body', 'was', 'worked', 'Next', 'trying', 'Hardcore', 'UPDATE', 'ON', '5/27/12', 'just', 'got', 'done', 'doing', 'Hardcore', 'definitely', 'hardest', 'three', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'seat', 'dancing', 'section', 'end', 'just', 'slayed', 'noticed', 'one', 'point', 'pretzel', 'combo', 'instructor', 'was', 'shaking', 'so', 'hard', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'out', 'music', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'going', 'tough', 'sets', 'outfits', 'one', 'are', 'also', 'probably', 'slinkiest.Overall', 'really', 'workouts', 'am', 'going', 'use', 'rotation', 'few', 'weeks', 'music', 'fun', 'good', 'energy', 'three', 'UPDATE', 'ON', '5/30/12', 'last', 'ten', 'days', ""'ve"", 'been', 'alternating', 'Pop', 'Physique', 'Sylwia', ""Weisenbeg'sSylwia"", 'Wiesenberg', 'Tonique', 'Premier', 'DVDandTonique', '2', 'Fitness', 'Workout', 'Sylwia', 'Wiesenberg', 'DVDworkouts', 'legs', 'have', 'really', 'started', 'slim', 'down', 'pretty', 'intense', 'combo', ""'re"", 'looking', 'slim', 'down', 'legs', 'rear', 'end', 'are', 'trouble', 'spots', 'then', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'think', ""'ll"", 'only', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'few', 'weeks', 'legs', 'have', 'been', 'feeling', 'really', 'heavy', 'meantime', ""'m"", 'gaining', 'nice', 'definition', 'toning', 'up']",N/A

The Pop Physique ladies have a lot of unique movements that I haven't seen in my other barre workouts and I love their fun, upbeat vibe.  The set is also a great value for the money.  Sometimes you get what you pay for, but for this set, I felt I got more than I paid for.  The Pop Physique set comes with a nice variety of times for days when you have a lot of time to work out and for days when you have less.  Hardcore is 65-minutes long, Original Butt is 55-minutes long and Perfect Butt is 39 minutes in length.  I was pleasantly surprised that even the shorter workout left me feeling very worked which isn't always the case with shorter barre workouts.I do have to agree with other reviewers about their outfits.  I'm guessing that the Pop Physique ladies were going for a young, hip audience when they picked what to wear, but I thought their exercise wear was some of the tackiest and vulgar I have ever seen in any workout DVD and I am not ultra-conservative about these matters.  Regarding production, the studio is also very bland.  However, why it knocked a star off of my review, I wouldn't let these two issues deter you from getting this excellent barre set.
