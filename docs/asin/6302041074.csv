I thought we'd get a kick out of it.  Now that it is a classic, I spent more on the movie than I would have liked for a used ViHS.  We have yet to watch it together but I did a private screening for myself and it was as I remembered it.  Now I have one of those 80's movies in my collection.  I would like to see it out in dvd format",3,would like to see it on dvd,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,443,"['purchased', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'now', 'grown', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'kick', 'Now', 'classic', 'spent', 'more', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'used', 'ViHS', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'together', 'did', 'private', 'screening', 'was', 'remembered', 'Now', 'have', 'one', '80', 'movies', 'collection', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'out', 'dvd', 'format']",N/A

If a bit choppy at times (which I'll blame on editing) I thought Rob was gorgeous and Jennifer beautiful,  sensible and in love.
