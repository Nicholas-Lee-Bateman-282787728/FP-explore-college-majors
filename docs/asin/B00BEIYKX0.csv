There was something amiss about a man his age (He is a year younger than I am)..that is, mid-70's, playing the father of a ten year old.  Maybe as the grandfather.  His direction is keen but his movies are always better with out him in them.  Although he is often good in other movies where he is not miscast.Also if...things had moved at a somewhat faster pace..and more suspenseful.  We were in the dark as to why he was after Mimi (Julie Christie) after all of those years but only got vague glimpses of the why's and when we found out the why somehow there was only a mild surprise and disappointment. The ending failed to surprise although Christie was very convincing as she expressed what she would not do and then, of course, ended up doing it.  hmmmmmI lived through the Viet Nam war and the protesting that went on. I was an adult then and a history teacher.  And, having said that, I do believe that it is a story well worth telling and should never remain limited to an objective historical only viewpoint.  Many people were very opposed to our involvement in Viet Nam because of the many lives lost and some of them got militantly violent about it.  In retrospect something gets lost in the telling, the mood which prevailed is missed.  And Redford did just that--missed it.  But, hey, laurels for trying!It did not bring it all back.  It just misfired the meaning.  Okay to watch some afternoon when you want to see how Nick Nolte, Julie Christie, and Robert Redford are looking these days.  Richard Jenkins was just right, btw, and worth a rental just to watch his short part in it.  Again, he shines up against much more famous names which he also did with Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love.Was it contemporary?

She was a Weatherman - a member of the radical domestic terrorist group The Weather Underground Organization (WUO).  Between 1969 and 1981, the WUO carried out violent acts against the U.S. government in protest of the Vietnam War and in support of the Black Power movement by bombing public buildings and robbing banks and a National Guard Armory.  Among other illegal acts, Katherine Power was involved in the robbery of a bank in Brighton, Massachusetts in which a police officer was killed. She was the driver of one of the two get-away cars.  Power's surrender became the basis of many books; one of them was Neil Gordon's book by the same name on which the film was based.**Spoiler Alert** - The following review may contain spoilers.The film is about the consequence of radicalism on the participants and the people they love.  All the characters in the film are fictitious.  It is the story of a former Weatherman Nick Sloan (Robert Redford) who had assumed a new identity as Jim Grant and been working as an attorney in Albany.  He was recently widowed when his young wife was killed in a car accident, leaving him a single father of a 12-year-old daughter Isabel (Jackie Evancho).  The arrest of another former Weatherman Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) piqued the interest of a young reporter Ben Shepard (Shia Saide LaBeouf) who is determined to make a name for himself.  Through much digging, he discovers the true identity of Jim Grant.  Jim Grant goes on the run, leaving his daughter in the care of his brother. It turns out the Jim Grant was not present in the bank robbery in which a police officer was killed.  To clear his name, he must convince his former lover Mimi Lurie (Julie Christie) to surrender herself and tell the truth.  Jim and Mimi had a daughter whom they had to give up for adoption when they went into hiding.  Now Jim is determined not to allow the same fate to befall his young daughter Isabel.**End of possible spoilers**The film is a thinking man's political thriller. It is subdued but well paced and the story compelling.  It makes the viewers to ponder upon the cost of idealism and the consequence and futility of terrorism.  All the actors and actresses in the film are superb.  Robert Redford and Julie Christie look great at their age.  Newcomer Jackie Evancho did a fine job as Jim Grant's young daughter Isabel.

Redford did not need to be on the run from the FBI to try and clear his name. the main action should have been between him and Julie Christie, his SDS lover who could clear him.although it is technically possible for redford's character to have a twelve year old daughter, it really doesn't ever mesh well with this scenario. his wife, conveniently dead, would have had to have been decades younger than he which rather clashes with his SDS image. also, although these characters would also be in their sixties, Redford is well past his sixties and arguably too old for this role. and he really needs to have grey hair, not bottle blonde, at this stage of his career, especially if playing a seriously minded SDS underground character. plus how did he become a lawyer?  i had to be fingerprinted and put in the national database back in the early seventies when i became a lawyer.  how did he ever get past this?this could have been a very thoughtful, dramatic film, almost like a play, between Redford and Christie, but it is this jumble instead.  too bad.  it could have been extraordinary.although Shia laboufe plays a reporter here, hot on Redford's past, I felt that he, along wiith the FBI, took away from the story between these two rather than adding to it.",3,could have been extraordinary  tale of sixties radicals present day,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1967,"['have', 'read', 'seen', 'story', 'nothing', 'fresh', 'new', 'here', 'try', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'RUNNING', 'ON', 'EMPTY', 'late', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'flawless', 'story', 'radicals', 'lives', 'post', 'sixties.this', 'film', 'also', 'sixties', 'radicals', 'SDs', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'underground', 'decades', 'coming', 'surface', 'Robert', 'redford', 'case', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'guilty', 'death', 'accused', 'meanwhile', 'most', 'woefully', 'inept', 'rendition', 'FBI', 'ever', 'put', 'screen', 'tries', 'track', 'down', 'FBI', 'agent', 'charge', 'virtual', 'caricature', 'inept', 'bureaucrat', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'losing', 'whole', 'part', 'story', 'Redford', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'run', 'FBI', 'try', 'clear', 'name', 'main', 'action', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'SDS', 'lover', 'who', 'could', 'clear', 'technically', 'possible', 'redford', 'character', 'have', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'really', ""n't"", 'ever', 'mesh', 'well', 'scenario', 'wife', 'conveniently', 'dead', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'decades', 'younger', 'rather', 'SDS', 'image', 'also', 'characters', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'sixties', 'Redford', 'well', 'sixties', 'arguably', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'really', 'have', 'grey', 'hair', 'not', 'bottle', 'blonde', 'stage', 'career', 'especially', 'playing', 'seriously', 'minded', 'SDS', 'underground', 'character', 'how', 'did', 'become', 'lawyer', 'i', 'had', 'be', 'fingerprinted', 'put', 'national', 'database', 'back', 'early', 'seventies', 'when', 'i', 'became', 'lawyer', 'how', 'did', 'ever', 'get', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'dramatic', 'film', 'almost', 'play', 'Redford', 'Christie', 'jumble', 'instead', 'too', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'extraordinary.although', 'Shia', 'laboufe', 'reporter', 'here', 'hot', 'Redford', 'past', 'felt', 'FBI', 'took', 'away', 'story', 'two', 'rather', 'adding']",The Company You Keep

A slew of A-list actors or previously A-list actors like Robert Redford, Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon, Nick Nolte, Chris Cooper, Terence Howard, Stanley Tucci, Anna Kendrick and Sam Elliott flocked to this film for some reason, but what that was is the biggest mystery of the film.The pacing is droll and slow. That is hands down the biggest problem of the film. I won't even go into the suspension of belief ages of some of the actors. Forty-five minutes into the film and I could care less about any of the over-acting and over-dramatizations. A scene in a truck between Nick Nolte and Redford was reminiscent of a scene from ""JFK"" as the character begins to remember and tell what they know about the past and it just felt trumped up and overdone. They wanted you to listen and observe with awe, but it just didn't work.That scene is a fair assessment of the entire film. As much as they want you to care, it is just plain hard to.

While the movie kept a steady and interesting pace- the ending was a bit lackluster.  Yet, I wasn't sure what a fitting ending would actually be, so I can't complain too much about how it closes.Based on a real radical peace movement organization in the past, an org that wanted Vietnam over and soldiers brought home, somewhere along the way the group started to realize that their passive protests were not quite enough.This frustrated them more and obviously angered certain members of the group into actions they normally would not do.At least this is how some members of the groups felt, and  it seems the protests gradually got more aggressive until one day, an innocent person is killed in a bank robbery.The movie analyzes  both the cause and the people involved, with Robert Redford's character the focal point of the movie as it explores these issues.A key point to the movie is that things are not what they appear to be, and also, people learn that time has a way of changing perception and beliefs about their prior and present behavior.Shia Lebouf is a young, tenacious, investigative reporter who wants to grab a good story and make a name for himself.And not just something for his small time newspaper, but something that will let him make his  mark in the world of journalism in general.He thinks if he can learn more about this group from 30 years ago and where the former members are, what they are doing, how they are linked- etc, and create a block buster story- even an expose', he will be giving his career in journalism, a major boost from a lame local newspaper to something bigger and  better- whatever that might be.When Susan Sarandon's character- the woman from 30 years ago who is guilty of being involved in shooting an innocent bystander in a bank, finally decides it is time to turn herself in, the FBI grabs her before she can do so of her own volition.Shia Lebouf is intrigued by the story of THE WEATHERMEN, as the group was called, and by Sarandon's character.She allows him to interview her if he promises to simply report the truth. Or at least the truth as she saw it back then.This seems to cause further  intrigue  for Lebouf after interviewing her at the police station.He now sees her as a far more complex character than just some hippie from the past who went out of control and did something unspeakable and indefensible.He seeks out on a journey of putting the puzzles together of  several people, who were once the same age he was , fighting for what they believed in  decades ago, until something went terribly wrong.As he goes about doing this, he sets a chain of events in motion that ends up getting many of the former group under the spotlight of the FBI.He also  ends up potentially putting innocent people into jeopardy in his zeal to cover this juicy, history making  story.As the movie moves on, Lebouf's character must weigh the consequences of a hot story hitting the press with his name on it- versus the collateral damage to those who had nothing to do with the org or that fateful day so long ago.The movie is based on a novel but the org did actually exist and I intend to learn more about them and what became of them.Most people agree today what a terrible waste of lives the Vietnam war caused and how fruitless the entire conflict was.Some people in the past tried earnestly to be a voice for the American people against the war and  use that voice to bring American troops home.But they were drowned out and the movie shows old video flashbacks of how protesters against the war were treated.  The American govt and military had no hesitation in doing whatever it could to squelch movements like THE WEATHERMEN.  The police/ MP brutality shown in flashbacks makes you realize how so many of these protests were well intentioned but never stood a chance.When you see how martial law was used against such people,and you hear references as well to the KENT STATE incident, one can understand how certain members of this group might have went over the edge and crossed a very serious line in their effort to try and put an end to the atrocities they were so very aware of happening to Vietnam's people and our own soldiers.They wanted their voices to be heard louder. Unfortunately, some poor choice of methods were employed. They crossed the line from being outrageous and not hurting people to having a person murdered.That fine line, is one that was crossed- but the  movie leaves you guessing who crossed that line along with Susan Sarandon's character.Susan is not a fall guy- she is guilty.  She does not deny that.But there is another accomplice in this bank robbery scenario and apparently there is a fall guy as well.The question the movie pursues right up to the very end is: who else was culpable in that bank robbery incident and who might not be involved at all?",4,Not all is as it seems & you can't outrun the past,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,4935,"['was', 'interesting', 'movie',

1629271,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00BEIYKX0,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","In a sense ""The Company You Keep"" is a testament to Robert Redford's skill as a director.  I can't think of too many films that would get your attention as this one does despite the missteps and stretches of logic on display.  For starters the film is apparently set thirty years after the campus uprisings of the late Sixties and early Seventies.  By that account the setting of the film would be around the beginning of the new Millennium yet references are made to Facebook which wasn't created until much later in the decade.  We also have to accept Senior Citizens like Robert Redford, Julie Christie, and Nick Nolte as Fiftysomethings.  At least they didn't make Chris Cooper Redford's older brother.  It's interesting that journalist Ben Shepard(Shia LaBoeuf) is a complete parasitic weasel so distasteful even his own editor dislikes him.  In the Seventies Redford made films like ""All the President's Men"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" that elevated to sainthood the print media.  For a film that concerns itself with the former Students for Democratic Action and the Weather Underground I came away with very little insight into these organizations and what made their members tick with the possible exception of one scene with Susan Sarandon who plays a repenting fugitive.  The depiction of the leader of the former militants, Nick Sloan (Redford) doesn't help matters.  Whether it's in the way the character is written or the way Redford portrays him Sloan remains an enigma.  The end of the film which should provide answers only adds new questions.  Despite these criticisms ""The Company You Keep"" is an eminently watchable film that moves at a nice clip with some good performances.  The manhunt for Sloan is exciting and tense.

1629275,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00BEIYKX0,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","{3.5 stars}First off, THE COMPANY YOU KEEP is by no means a ""thriller."" There is nothing in the way of fast action, not a shred of violence, no harrowing chase scenes, etc. The pacing throughout is slow yet steady. The first three-quarters of the film are simultaneously engaging and ho-hum. I kept hoping that it would somehow pay off, and it does. The subtle threads come together, and there are some true surprises. By ""true surprises,"" I do not mean anything earth-shattering, just, well, truly surprising. THE COMPANY YOU KEEP quietly touches on a lot of themes, but in the end it's more about the camaraderie (as well as suspicion) that endures between old friends/conspirators than it is about what's happening with all of them in the here and now.Redford gives a nice performance as Jim Grant/Nick Sloan, but Shia LaBeouf steals the show as idiosyncratic reporter Ben Shepard. Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon, Brendan Gleeson,and most of the rest of the cast under-act; still, the under-acting is oddly effective and in keeping with the other minimalistic elements of this film.Several plotholes and too-easies that will hopefully not be too ruinous if you are willing and able to suspend disbelief. THE COMPANY YOU KEEP might also have been enhanced by more in the way of flashback(s) to the big event back in the '70s that brought about everything that's happening in the present.THE COMPANY YOU KEEP may leave you wondering who the real criminals, both within the film and elsewhere, are.

1629277,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B00BEIYKX0,Dr. James Gardner,"[7, 17]","""The Company You Keep"" is a 2012 thriller about 60s revolutionaries who surface in the present day. It is Robert Redford's 9th outing as a director, and his 4th as actor-director (""Ordinary People"", ""Horse Whisperer"", ""Lions for Lambs""). Redford plays a former radical who assumed a new identity following a bank robbery in which a guard was killed. 30 years later his identity is exposed by an ambitious reporter (Shia LaBeouf), so he puts his daughter (singer Jackie Evancho) with his brother (Chris Cooper), and searches for the one woman who can prove his innocence (Julie Christie), contacting his old associates (Nick Nolte, Richard Jenkins) along the way. All the time he is pursued not only by the reporter but also by the FBI (Terrence Howard, Anna Kendrick).There are few surprises in a plot that works itself out in a predictable manner, and one which offers no real drama. And the twin pursuits (by the reporter and by the FBI) don't generate much tension. Though the acting is very good throughout, the director's approach is more clinical and thus few of the characters elicit much emotion, either on screen or in the audience.BTW - Kudos to AGT runner-up Jackie Evancho who does a fine job in her first film. Susan Sarandon is absolutely marvelous and is in the film far too briefly. Robert Redford's best acting is done while running. His good looks once commanded the screen and compensated for a lack of acting skills, but at 76 he needs to put more effort into the acting. IMO his last decent acting job was in ""Spy Game"" (2001).The elephant in the room, of course, is the fact that there is already someone who can prove that Redford is innocent (Susan Sarandon), but this glaring fact is never addressed by anyone.The elephant's twin brother is the constant reference to the Vietnam War being ""30 years ago"". By my math, it's more than 40 years ago. Also, according to Wikipedia, there were never any fatalities associated with the Weatherman bombings and bank robberies. There was a 1981 incident in which former Weathermen joined in a brinks car robbery and two policemen and a security guard were killed.People who went through the 60s will have some identification with the storyline, but to younger people, it will appear a little absurd. And Redford, at the age of 77 looks a little silly as the ""father"" of 12 year old Jackie Evancho.Bottom line - a tremendous waste of talent.",2,"""We all died then.

1629279,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00BEIYKX0,Ed Uyeshima,"[21, 27]","As much as I respect Robert Redford as an actor, director and founder of the Sundance Institute, I just find him too hard to swallow as the father of an 11-year-old girl, especially the one played so precociously here by singing prodigy Jackie Evancho. This is one of several perceptible discrepancies that kept me from becoming fully engrossed in this fitfully suspenseful 2013 political thriller. At 76, he still looks great for his age and has a long legacy of starring in similarly themed movies likeAll The President's MenandThree Days of the Condor, but our suspension of belief is put to the test when we are expected to believe that his character, a small-town lawyer named Jim Grant, turns out to be Nick Sloan, a former 1970's radical who would have been a fearless political agitator in his forties. While I believe it's never too late for anyone to start their lives over, there is an air of vanity in Redford's self-selection since he is also the director. Fortunately in that role, he shows his unerring professionalism and keeps the pacing tight despite the convolutions brought on by Lem Dobbs' screenplay.The story begins when a middle-aged woman is suddenly arrested at a suburban gas station. Her real identity is Sharon Solarz, a former anti-Vietnam War radical who has been hiding in Canada under an alias for all these years. She makes one of her allowable calls to Grant, who becomes a person of interest for an intrepid newspaper reporter looking for his big break. Grant knows it's a matter of time before the FBI starts looking for him and goes on the lam, leaving his confused young daughter with his long-estranged brother. As Sloan, he is accused of participating with Solarz in a bank robbery that left a security guard dead. His former paramour Mimi Lurie is the only one who can prove his innocence, but she's in hiding as well and far less repentant about her radical activities. What follows is a series of encounters a bedraggled Sloan has with several former Weather Underground comrades. Each of them greets Sloan with different degrees of emotion depending on how they have carried on with their lives in the interim.At the same time, Redford and Dobbs want to make a point of showing how history appears to be repeating itself with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and pointing to the role of current tabloid-style journalism in fanning the embers in an irresponsible way. The movie ends up simplifying its points by turning the story into a morality play where key characters have to decide when to take a stand and when to concede if there is something even bigger to consider than political convictions. Beyond Redford's craggy presence, there is a starry mix of old and new faces that make the cross-generational casting appear even more pronounced.

1629282,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYKX0,FNDNreview,"[3, 5]","For the better part of 50 years, Robert Redford has had a hand in the overall direction of Hollywood.  Speaking of direction, Redford is not only one of the most well-known and respected actors in the business, he's also spent half of his career producing and directing.  He's an absolute master of his craft, starring in some of the best Hollywood dramas to date, including All the President's Men, The Natural, and Out of Africa.  However, even though Redford has long been an established, respected actor, he has earned the majority of his critical acclaimed through directing.  Previously, he has been nominated for several prestigious directing awards for his work on such films as Quiz Show, A River Runs Through It, and The Horse Whisperer - while taking home an Academy Award for Best Director for Ordinary People.  Redford is once again behind the camera, as well as in front of the camera in the new thriller, The Company You Keep.Directed by Robert Redford, The Company You Keep also stars Redford as Jim Grant, a wanted fugitive and former member of a left wing radical group that robbed a Michigan bank and killed a security guard in 1980.  More than 30 years later, Grant lives in the state of New York working as a low profile lawyer and is raising his young daughter - until one of his radical associates, Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) is arrested.  After an abundance of digging and asking questions in regards to the Michigan robbery, a news reporter, Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf), uncovers Grant's true identity and forces him to flee New York.  With Grant on the run and Shepard in search of a story, both men are on a quest for information - all of which involves past secrets and the still ""at large"" members of the Michigan bank robbery.  Terrence Howard, Julie Christie, Nick Nolte, and Anna Kendrick also star in supporting roles.Initially, it's a bit difficult to figure out where the film's plot is taking you.  Is this going to turn into another rendition of The Fugitive?  Well, yes and no.  The Fugitive actually treats ""the fugitive"" like a fugitive (with constant pursuit), while The Company You Keep shows a dimwitted FBI that can't manage to catch up to a 75 year old man on the run (literally).  At one point, Redford is on the run through a forest, with a bunch of FBI agents in hot pursuit - but Redford apparently still gets around pretty well for an old guy.  Still, this particular scene is a bit humorous at first, but eventually reality sinks in and Redford's character realizes that it's unlikely he'll be able to avoid those youthful FBI legs for a sustainable amount of time.  In any event, The Fugitive at least provided a few ""edge of your seat"" action sequences, but sadly, The Company You Keep completely devoid of any of the pulse-pounding interactions.Normally, one would presume that Robert Redford would be the standout in a film that he stars in and directs.  Surprisingly, it's Shia LaBeouf that takes the ""standout"" title in this particular film.  Not only does LaBeouf's performance outshine Redford's in this film, but he also outshines nearly all of his previous roles.  Typically, LaBeouf plays the role of a character that is best described as sniveling or flat out annoying, so you can imagine the surprise of seeing him play a serious character, tackling a serious subject matter.  Not only does he play a serious character, but there's very little to not enjoy about his character - for once, someone that instantly exudes a tremendous amount of confidence and recognizes his strengths.  For once, LaBeouf stars in a film where he isn't overshadowed by Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), Michael Douglas (Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps), or a bunch of transforming vehicles (Transformers).Overall, The Company You Keep is a bit more thrilling than originally anticipated.  While the film is increasingly interesting (occasionally confusing) for the first half of the film, it quickly takes a turn downhill into an easily predicable film.  However, Robert Redford and Shia LaBeouf are delightfully entertaining and easily carry this film from beginning to end, while still allowing for the ensemble supporting cast to appear for a few moments here and there.Overall Film Grade:  C-FNDNreview.comFNDNreview.com",3,"LaBeouf, Redford delightful in 'The Company You Keep'",1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,4305,"['better', 'part', '50', 'years', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'had', 'hand', 'overall', 'direction', 'Hollywood', 'Speaking', 'direction', 'Redford', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'most', 'well-known', 'respected', 'actors', 'business', 'also', 'spent', 'half', 'career', 'producing', 'directing', 'absolute', 'master', 'craft', 'starring', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'dramas', 'date', 'including', 'President', 'Men', 'Natural', 'Out', 'Africa', 'However', 'even', 'Redford', 'long', 'been', 'established', 'respected', 'actor', 'earned', 'majority', 'critical', 'acclaimed', 'directing', 'Previously', 'been', 'nominated', 'several', 'prestigious', 'directing', 'awards', 'work', 'such', 'films', 'Quiz', 'Show', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'taking', 'home', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Director', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Redford', 'once', 'again', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'front', 'camera', 'new', 'thriller', 'Company', 'Keep.Directed', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Company', 'Keep', 'also', 'Redford', 'Jim', 'Grant', 'wanted', 'fugitive', 'former', 'member', 'left', 'wing', 'radical', 'group', 'robbed', 'Michigan', 'bank', 'killed', 'security', 'guard', '1980', 'More', '30', 'years', 'later', 'Grant', 'state', 'New', 'York', 'working', 'low', 'profile', 'lawyer', 'raising', 'young', 'daughter', 'one', 'radical', 'associates', 'Sharon', 'Solarz', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'arrested', 'abundance', 'digging', 'asking', 'questions', 'regards', 'Michigan', 'robbery', 'news', 'reporter', 'Ben', 'Shepard', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Grant', 'true', 'identity', 'forces', 'flee', 'New', 'York', 'Grant', 'run', 'Shepard', 'search', 'story', 'men', 'are', 'quest', 'information', 'past', 'secrets', 'still', 'large', 'members', 'Michigan', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.Initially', 'bit', 'difficult', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'film', 'plot', 'taking', 'going', 'turn', 'rendition', 'Fugitive', 'Well', 'yes', 'Fugitive', 'actually', 'fugitive', 'fugitive', 'constant', 'pursuit', 'Company', 'Keep', 'dimwitted', 'FBI', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manage', 'catch', 'up', '75', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'run', 'literally', 'one', 'point', 'Redford', 'run', 'forest', 'bunch', 'FBI', 'agents', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Redford', 'apparently', 'still', 'around', 'pretty', 'well', 'old', 'guy', 'Still', 'particular', 'scene', 'bit', 'humorous', 'first', 'eventually', 'reality', 'sinks', 'Redford', 'character', 'unlikely', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'avoid', 'youthful', 'FBI', 'legs', 'sustainable', 'amount', 'time', 'event', 'Fugitive', 'least', 'provided', 'few', 'edge', 'seat', 'action', 'sequences', 'sadly', 'Company', 'Keep', 'completely', 'devoid', 'pulse-pounding', 'interactions.Normally', 'one', 'would', 'presume', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'would', 'be', 'standout', 'film', 'directs', 'Surprisingly', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'standout', 'title', 'particular', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'LaBeouf', 'performance', 'outshine', 'Redford', 'film', 'also', 'nearly', 'previous', 'roles', 'Typically', 'LaBeouf', 'role', 'character', 'best', 'described', 'sniveling', 'flat', 'annoying', 'can', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'seeing', 'play', 'serious', 'character', 'tackling', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'Not', 'only', 'play', 'serious', 'character', 'very', 'little', 'not', 'enjoy', 'character', 'once', 'someone', 'instantly', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'confidence', 'recognizes', 'strengths', 'once', 'LaBeouf', 'film', 'where', ""n't"", 'overshadowed', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'bunch', 'transforming', 'vehicles', 'Transformers', '.Overall', 'Company', 'Keep', 'bit', 'more', 'thrilling', 'originally', 'anticipated', 'film', 'increasingly', 'interesting', 'occasionally', 'confusing', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'quickly', 'turn', 'downhill', 'easily', 'predicable', 'film', 'However', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'are', 'delightfully', 'entertaining', 'easily', 'carry', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'still', 'allowing', 'ensemble', 'supporting', 'cast', 'appear', 'few', 'moments', 'here', 'there.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'C-FNDNreview.comFNDNreview.com']",The Company You Keep

Having been on something of a Redford-rampage lately i'd venture to say that it is a nice continuation on themes that have appeared previously in his career as well.The basic plotline, fugitive, question of guilt, the chase, the potentiality of loss, the detective, the old network. All aspects that work nicely together and is done in a respectful manner. Old secrets come to light at an amicable pace, and the movie manages to make at least certain reveals not completely obvious.The inevitability of Redfords character's redemption makes the movie lack a little nerve though.

1629287,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BEIYKX0,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","THE COMPANY YOU KEEP began as a novel by Neil Gordon, was transformed into a screenplay by Lem Dobbs, and produced, directed and stars Robert Redford. The highly respected Redford is likely the reason that so many luminaries aligned with this project: the cast includes four actors (Robert Redford, Susan Sarandon, Chris Cooper and Julie Christie) who have won Academy Awards and five others (Anna Kendrick, Richard Jenkins, Nick Nolte, Terrence Howard and Stanley Tucci) who have been nominated for Academy Awards, and the number of important actors doesn't stop there. The film is about a time in history (the1960s when many of us were either reluctantly in Vietnam or in the streets in the US protesting that very wrong war) that makes it very easy to want to empathize with the story, but despite some very fine moments and some excellent isolated scenes, the film is shaky and predictable and gets caught up in its own sense of righteousness. And that is unfortunate.According to the officially release synopsis, `Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandan) is nervous. She is driving along a lonely road, lost in thought. As she goes over a hill, her car drifts a little too close to the center-divide and she almost crushed by a truck going in the opposite direction. Rattled further, she pulls into a gas station. She looks like any another woman until cars come screeching in all around her, FBI agents begin waving their badges and a shotgun is pointed at her head. Jim Grant (Robert Redford)  has made a good life for himself as a small town lawyer in Albany New York. He has managed to juggle his job and raise his 11-year-old daughter Isabel (Jacqueline Evancho) after the death of his wife a few years ago. His world is turned upside down after he's approached by his old friend Billy (Stephen Root) while dropping his daughter off at school. Billy fills Jim in on Sharon's arrest that took place not far from them. Billy asks if Jim will help her in any way, but Jim wants no part of it. We learn that Sharon was a former member of a radical group called the Weather Underground. The group robbed a bank way back in the late 70s and the security guard, an off duty policeman, was shot and killed in the process. Sharon has been charged with murder. Jim is suddenly under suspicion of somehow being involved. During the ensuing investigation, evidence is unearthed and connections are being made, namely by young and clever Albany Times reporter Ben Schulberg (Shia LaBeouf). Ben uses his local and FBI contacts and slowly begins to think that Jim was involved in the robbery and murder. But past appearances can be deceiving and as he tries to get to the bottom of it all, Jim leads Ben and the FBI on a cross-country manhunt, while trying to find the third remaining member-at-large, Mimi Lurie (Julie Christie), so that he might convince her to come forward and prove his innocence and save his daughter.' To connect more dots would be a disservice to the viewer.In small but strong rolls are such fine actors as Chris Cooper, Terrence Howard, Stanley Tucci, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Elliott, Anna Kendrick, Richard Jenkins, Brit Marling, and Nick Nolte.

1629294,A1KHWLUBS5IK4Q,B00BEIYKX0,janebbooks,"[16, 21]","THE COMPANY YOU KEEP is a 2012 political thriller film adaptation of the 2003 novel by Neil Gordon that was released in theaters in April 2013. Gordon's book, as is this movie, is set against a backdrop of the rise and fall of the Weather Underground, the radical antiwar group of the Vietnam era.  The book is a sweeping American saga about sacrifice, the ecstatic righteousness of youth, and the tension between political ideals and family loyalties.Robert Redford is the star, the director, and the co-producer of COMPANY. He portrays a former Weatherman named Nick Sloan. The main action takes place in the late 1990s...some 25 years after a bank robbery and killing of a guard. Sloan's group had been on the run but are now comfortably ensconced in mainstream American life.  Sloan has become a civil rights attorney named Jim Grant and is a widower living in Albany, New York with his young daughter (Jackie Evancho).At the beginning of the movie, Jim Grant is having a bad day. His client, a successful organic veggie grower, is concerned about explaining the organic marijuana growing under the veggies to the FBI...and has a friend (Susan Sarandon) who has surrendered to the FBI to face murder charges for participating in a bank robbery in which a guard was killed. A local investigative reporter named Ben Shepherd (Shia LeBeouf) has just interviewed him and asks some very personal questions...but mainly why he isn't representing the friend of his marijuana-growing client. Shepherd is about to break the biggest story of his young career.Roger Ebert, in his review of COMPANY published one week after his death, calls the cast of the movie ""almost too perfect.""  Ebert is talking about the good-looking and still vibrant movie stars that play the aged Weathermen:  Redford, Susan Sarandon, Julie Christie, Nick Nolte and Richard Jenkins...all in their sixties and seventies.  Ebert gives the film 2.5 stars out of 3...almost a ""thumbs up"" for he admires the talents of Robert Redford although probably not the character he plays in COMPANY.Stephen Holden in his NYT review has a different slant on the film.  He slams Ben Shepherd, the Albany newspaper reporter who outs Grant. Holden says Shepherd ""far from being a dedicated seeker of truth and justice, is a smug, arrogant manipulator who exploits his connection with Diana (the underused Anna Kendrick), a college hookup who now works for the F.B.I., to gain privileged information."" Holden further expounds: COMPANY is ""not kind to the ailing newspaper business. If Ben is meant to represent a quintessential bright young journalist, Mr. LaBeouf makes him an obnoxious, unscrupulous troublemaker out for personal glory.""  I rather liked the young relentess reporter...who reminded me of real-life Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post.For a few days after I saw the movie, I wondered why Redford make this film?  It couldn't be a diatribe on domestic terrorism: the Oklahoma bombing (1995) had not been resolved and Boston (2013) was way in the future at the time of this tale.  Maybe a treatise in how to be on the run to avoid capture for many years: there was a bit of FBI-bashing in the film.  Or perhaps to get a new wardrobe of tailored blue denim button-down shirts and tight jeans. For a septuagenarian...Redford does look good in his clothes.  And wait until you see Julie Christie...still beautiful at age 71.",3,Aged Weathermen on the run in late 20th century America,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,3389,"['COMPANY', 'YOU', 'KEEP', '2012', 'political', 'thriller', 'film', 'adaptation', '2003', 'novel', 'Neil', 'Gordon', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'April', '2013', 'Gordon', 'book', 'movie', 'set', 'backdrop', 'rise', 'fall', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'radical', 'antiwar', 'group', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'book', 'sweeping', 'American', 'saga', 'sacrifice', 'ecstatic', 'righteousness', 'youth', 'tension', 'political', 'ideals', 'family', 'loyalties.Robert', 'Redford', 'star', 'director', 'co-producer', 'COMPANY', 'former', 'Weatherman', 'named', 'Nick', 'Sloan', 'main', 'action', 'place', 'late', '1990s', '25', 'years', 'bank', 'robbery', 'killing', 'guard', 'Sloan', 'group', 'had', 'been', 'run', 'are', 'now', 'comfortably', 'ensconced', 'mainstream', 'American', 'life', 'Sloan', 'become', 'civil', 'rights', 'attorney', 'named', 'Jim', 'Grant', 'widower', 'living', 'Albany', 'New', 'York', 'young', 'daughter', 'Jackie', 'Evancho', '.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Grant', 'having', 'bad', 'day', 'client', 'successful', 'organic', 'veggie', 'grower', 'concerned', 'explaining', 'organic', 'marijuana', 'growing', 'veggies', 'FBI', 'friend', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'surrendered', 'FBI', 'face', 'murder', 'charges', 'participating', 'bank', 'robbery', 'guard', 'was', 'killed', 'local', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'named', 'Ben', 'Shepherd', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'just', 'interviewed', 'very', 'personal', 'questions', 'mainly', 'why', ""n't"", 'representing', 'friend', 'marijuana-growing', 'client', 'Shepherd', 'break', 'biggest', 'story', 'young', 'career.Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'COMPANY', 'published', 'one', 'week', 'death', 'cast', 'movie', 'almost', 'too', 'perfect', 'Ebert', 'talking', 'good-looking', 'still', 'vibrant', 'movie', 'stars', 'play', 'aged', 'Weathermen', 'Redford', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'Ebert', 'film', '2.5', 'stars', '3', 'almost', 'thumbs', 'up', 'talents', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'probably', 'not', 'character', 'COMPANY.Stephen', 'Holden', 'NYT', 'review', 'different', 'slant', 'film', 'Ben', 'Shepherd', 'Albany', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'Grant', 'Holden', 'Shepherd', 'far', 'being', 'dedicated', 'seeker', 'truth', 'justice', 'smug', 'arrogant', 'manipulator', 'who', 'connection', 'Diana', 'underused', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'college', 'hookup', 'who', 'now', 'F.B.I.', 'gain', 'privileged', 'information', 'Holden', 'further', 'expounds', 'COMPANY', 'not', 'kind', 'ailing', 'newspaper', 'business', 'Ben', 'meant', 'represent', 'quintessential', 'bright', 'young', 'journalist', 'Mr.', 'LaBeouf', 'obnoxious', 'unscrupulous', 'troublemaker', 'personal', 'glory', 'rather', 'liked', 'young', 'relentess', 'reporter', 'who', 'reminded', 'real-life', 'Carl', 'Bernstein', 'Washington', 'Post.For', 'few', 'days', 'saw', 'movie', 'wondered', 'why', 'Redford', 'make', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'diatribe', 'domestic', 'terrorism', 'Oklahoma', 'bombing', '1995', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'resolved', 'Boston', '2013', 'was', 'way', 'future', 'time', 'tale', 'Maybe', 'treatise', 'how', 'be', 'run', 'avoid', 'capture', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'bit', 'FBI-bashing', 'film', 'perhaps', 'get', 'new', 'wardrobe', 'tailored', 'blue', 'denim', 'button-down', 'shirts', 'tight', 'jeans', 'septuagenarian', 'Redford', 'look', 'good', 'clothes', 'wait', 'see', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'still', 'beautiful', 'age', '71']",The Company You Keep

1629306,A3ED8SZQT1ZF82,B00BEIYKX0,Kait,"[0, 1]","I had to give it 5 Stars because it is a well done film. And Shia Labeouf is really very good as the hungry-for-success reporter at a local paper who wants to get to the New York Times as soon as possible. The way he goes after the story about Redford's character is really quite thrilling. It makes the movie. It's worth seeing just to see him.But the story starts to fall apart when the radical Weathermen start talking. Susan Sarandon, who makes 60 look good, goes on about genocide while at the same time her character is guilty of murder.Same thing with Julie Christie who makes 70 look bad. She's actually a bit frail and decrepit and not convincing at all. Her scene with Redford towards the end is loaded with not believeable dialogue. She still believes she can make a difference, she says. But her whole life after murdering the security guard has been devoted to selling drugs. So not sure what difference she was making there.None of the characters have accomplished anything. Unlike the security guard they've murdered, they've gone on to live quiet, nice upper-middle class lives, raising their children in the safe confines of American suburbs.The best line in the film is delivered by an FBI agent played by Anna Kendrick when she tells Shia Labeouf ""Terrorists justify terrorism"" And that's exactly what Sarandon's and Christie's characters do in their rambling speeches about genocide and war crimes. Redford's character is innocent of killing the security guard at the bank and he sees things from the guard's family's viewpoint--a husband and father was murdered.Every Baby Boomer knows that groups like the Weathermen were populated with sociopaths, and that the real reason for the student protests were the draft, not the war. President Nixon, unlike President Johnson, knew it, too. Which is why Nixon got rid of it.

1629319,A3UVGHUDOY77YR,B00BEIYKX0,MissPammy,"[0, 0]","This is one of the few movies I've seen in recent years that was really worth watching.  It's suspenseful, compelling, and the acting is excellent.  Robert Redford directed this, and he did a superb job of maintaining the tension in the film and revealing insights about the characters as the film progressed.  His portrayal is convincing, and he achieves it without special effects and the other over-the-top devices most films use today.  This made it more human and more believable.  Shia LaBeouf's performance was nuanced.  Although his character is an aggressive reporter, hungry for a big story, LaBeouf does not play him like a caricature.  The reporter is relentless, but he also cares about how his story will affect the people involved, and after a certain point he pursues it as much to help clear the innocent one as to get a headline.  LaBeouf has a talent for portraying confidence but also sensitivity and reflection, and his scenes are expertly crafted to help the viewer follow the progressive realization as his character figures out what really happened 30 years earlier.  The performances by the other well-known actors and actresses--Julie Christie, Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, and more--create a sense of community, of a lasting brotherhood among the former activists that runs deeper than their activist ideals and becomes a commitment to one another that survives the years.  There is much to enjoy in this film.  Each of the actors has a ""moment"" in the film, a part of the film that allows him or her to take center stage and become the focus of the movie, and so there is a feeling by the end that you have known each of them and learned something secret about them.  I liked this about it, and it made the characters more engaging and the story more meaningful.

1629320,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYKX0,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","Robert Redford directs himself and an all-star cast of aging superstars in addition to some up-and-comers in this run and hide thriller.  Redford plays Jim Grant, an attorney in Albany, New York.  Thirty years earlier he was a member of the Weather Underground Movement, a real organization bent on terrorism to protest the Vietnam War and harsh government tactics on more peaceful protests.  In this fictional story, he was allegedly involved in a Michigan bank robbery where a security officer was killed.  He, along with 3 others have been on the lam since.The first to get caught is Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) even though she was about to surrender.  Why?  Can't give that away.  Grant aka Nick Sloan, realizes that it's just a matter of time so he hands off his 11 year old daughter (mom died in a car wreck) to his brother (Chris Cooper) in NYC and heads for the scene of the crime (Michigan).  Grant's eventual discovery came from a hungry local newspaper reporter, Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf) who suspects there is more to the story.  He can't figure out why the daughter was left behind.Along the way Grant runs into former ""soldiers"" in the movement played by Nick Nolte, Richard Jenkins (11 years younger than Redford, but OK), Stephen Root & Sam Elliott.  They are just there for a brief walk-on and to direct Grant to the person he really wants to see, Mimi (Julie Christie), one of the kingpins in the old organization and one time lover.  Eventually they reunite in Ann Arbor (Mimi's hometown) where Grant tries to get her to come clean.  I found this gambit a bit of a stretch, but it has a necessary purpose for an obvious plot twist.Brendan Gleeson plays the police detective who handled the bank robbery and Brit Marling plays his law student daughter.  She's along for the ride and as an age appropriate counter to Ben's investigative reporter.  Stanley Tucci is Ben's editor, Terrence Howard is the hard assed FBI task leader and Anna Kendrick is an FBI agent who is a bit loose with confidential info, just because she and Ben had a fling in college.The film has some interesting twists and turns and Ben eventually unravels the truth.  There are some problems however.  Some are just logistical silliness in terms of travel and transportation.  The movie is about 20 minutes too long, mostly due to Redford's insistence of scenes of him and Christie jogging through the woods.  Yeah, we get it, you guys are in great shape for your age.  The film is a nice puzzle and it's nice to see the old pros still at work.The 35mm film transfers well to Blu ray with its 1080p resolution 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It retains a hint of grain which certainly enhances the film feel as well as all of the good aspects of digital.  Skin tones (and a lot of wrinkles) are well detailed and color perfect.  There are no discernible issues that I can see.  The movie is dialog focused but does use the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track often enough to be helpful.  Helicopters flying around, sirens blaring get the attention of the surround speakers.  English SDH subtitles are included.

1629326,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BEIYKX0,Paul Allaer,"[5, 7]","""The Company You Keep"" (2013 release; 125 min.) is a political thriller directed by and starring Robert Redford. As the movie opens, we watch old TV footage from the 1970s when the Weather Underground, a radical anti-Vietnam War movement, terrorized the US with a number of bomb attacks and killings. (Please note that while the movie is a work of fiction, the Weather Underground in fact did exist.) Next we see Sharon Solarz (played by Susan Sarandon), a former Weather Underground member, getting arrested 30 years after a bank heist in Michigan horribly gone wrong, causing the death of a bank teller. It was thought there were two further WU members involved in that heist. We then meet Jim Grant (played by Robert Redford), who in reality is Nick Sloan, another former WU member who took on a new life as an attorney in Albany and has a 12 year old daughter. While all this is happening, we also meet Ben Shepard (played by Shia LaBeouf), a newspaper of the Albany Sun-Times reporter who sees an opportunity to score some major scoops and hence advance his career. To tell you much more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is an enjoyable cat-and-mouse political thriller, in which Redford, directing himself, tries to stay ahead of both the FBI and the newspaper reporter. I wouldn't call it an action thriller, as this is more of a talk movie than an action movie, and that's fine with me. Second, while watching LaBeouf in the newspaper offices trying to piece the puzzle together, I couldn't help but think back of those same newspaper scenes in ""All the President's Men"" with Redford and Dustin Hoffman. Of course, I'm not calling ""The Company You Keep"" the classic that was ""All the President's Men"". Third, I was astonished to see so much acting talent gathered in a single movie. Just to name a few I haven't mentioned yet: Julie Christie follows her outstanding role in ""Away From Her"" of a few years ago with another great performance. Even in some of the smaller roles, there are several standouts. Check out Anna Kendrick as an FBI agent (less than 10 min. of screen time, but she lights up the screen when she's on), and also Brit Marling as the daughter of the former police investigator (maybe 15 min. of screen time), following up on her noteworthy roles last year in ""Sound of My Voice"" and ""Arbitrage"". Both of these ladies are rapidly climbing the ranks of actresses. And last but not least there is 12 yr. old singing phenom Jackie Evancho, here playing the role of Redford's young daughter. She acts with such maturity that completely belies her age (and her young appearance), so much so that it's a little weird, to be honest. And I still haven't even mentioned Nick Nolte, Sam Elliot, Chris Cooper, and on and on.This movie made quite a splash when it premiered at the Venice Film Festival last Fall, and rightfully so. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati this weekend was reasonably well attended, somewhat to my surprise in fact. All that aside, ""The Company You Keep"" is a well paced thriller, even if there are some clear flaws/gaps in the plot. But the acting performances are what makes this movie worth seeking out, whether in the theatre or on DVD.",4,Cat-and-mouse political thriller with an all-star cast,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,3330,"['Company', 'Keep', '2013', 'release', '125', 'min', 'political', 'thriller', 'directed', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'movie', 'watch', 'old', 'TV', 'footage', '1970s', 'when', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'radical', 'anti-Vietnam', 'War', 'movement', 'terrorized', 'US', 'number', 'bomb', 'attacks', 'killings', 'Please', 'note', 'movie', 'work', 'fiction', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'fact', 'did', 'exist', 'see', 'Sharon', 'Solarz', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'former', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'member', 'getting', 'arrested', '30', 'years', 'bank', 'heist', 'Michigan', 'horribly', 'gone', 'wrong', 'causing', 'death', 'bank', 'teller', 'was', 'thought', 'there', 'were', 'two', 'further', 'WU', 'members', 'involved', 'heist', 'then', 'meet', 'Jim', 'Grant', 'played', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'reality', 'Nick', 'Sloan', 'former', 'WU', 'member', 'who', 'took', 'new', 'life', 'attorney', 'Albany', '12', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'happening', 'also', 'meet', 'Ben', 'Shepard', 'played', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'newspaper', 'Albany', 'Sun-Times', 'reporter', 'who', 'opportunity', 'score', 'major', 'scoops', 'hence', 'advance', 'career', 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'plot-heavy', 'movie', 'would', 'surely', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'enjoyable', 'cat-and-mouse', 'political', 'thriller', 'Redford', 'directing', 'stay', 'ahead', 'FBI', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'action', 'thriller', 'more', 'talk', 'movie', 'action', 'movie', 'fine', 'Second', 'watching', 'LaBeouf', 'newspaper', 'offices', 'trying', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'together', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'back', 'same', 'newspaper', 'scenes', 'President', 'Men', 'Redford', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'calling', 'Company', 'Keep', 'classic', 'was', 'President', 'Men', 'Third', 'was', 'astonished', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'acting', 'talent', 'gathered', 'single', 'movie', 'Just', 'name', 'few', 'have', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'yet', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'outstanding', 'role', 'Away', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'great', 'performance', 'Even', 'smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'several', 'standouts', 'Check', 'out', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'FBI', 'agent', 'less', '10', 'min', 'screen', 'time', 'screen', 'when', 'also', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'daughter', 'former', 'police', 'investigator', 'maybe', '15', 'min', 'screen', 'time', 'following', 'up', 'noteworthy', 'roles', 'last', 'year', 'Sound', 'My', 'Voice', 'Arbitrage', 'ladies', 'are', 'rapidly', 'climbing', 'ranks', 'actresses', 'last', 'not', 'least', '12', 'yr.', 'old', 'singing', 'phenom', 'Jackie', 'Evancho', 'here', 'playing', 'role', 'Redford', 'young', 'daughter', 'such', 'maturity', 'completely', 'age', 'young', 'appearance', 'so', 'much', 'little', 'weird', 'be', 'honest', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'on.This', 'movie', 'made', 'quite', 'splash', 'when', 'premiered', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'last', 'Fall', 'rightfully', 'so', 'screening', 'saw', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'weekend', 'was', 'reasonably', 'well', 'attended', 'somewhat', 'surprise', 'fact', 'aside', 'Company', 'Keep', 'well', 'paced', 'thriller', 'even', 'are', 'clear', 'flaws/gaps', 'plot', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'what', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'theatre', 'DVD']",The Company You Keep

1629340,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00BEIYKX0,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 3]","The Company You Keep, (2012).  In this star-laden political thriller, Robert Redford, (The Natural,The Great Gatsby (1974), directed and stars as Jim Grant, an Albany, New York-based public interest lawyer and single father.  Grant suddenly finds that he has to disappear after Ben Shepard, (Shia La Beof,Transformers: Dark Of The Moon), ambitious young reporter for the local ""Albany Sun-Times,"" identifies him as a long-sought U.S. terrorist. ""Grant"" - really Nick Sloan -- is apparently a member of the late 1960's-`70s group, the Weather Underground; he apparently took part in a 1970 bank robbery during which the bank's security officer was killed.  Grant/Sloan hits the road, with the journalist in hot pursuit; as Grant/Sloan looks up his old contacts, played by a slew of senior citizen stars, his guilt begins to appear less certain to the young man.The mystery/suspense picture was written by Lem Dobbs, based on a novel by Neil Gordon.  In it, Susan Sarandon,(The Client),  plays Sharon Solarz, long-time housewife, another former member of the Weather Underground implicated in the bank robbery, whose decision to surrender herself starts the ball rolling.  Julie Christie, (Doctor Zhivago),  plays Mimi Lurie, Grant/Sloan's once, and possibly again, love.  Nick Nolte, (The Good Thief), plays Donal Fitzgerald; Chris Cooper, (Breach), Daniel Sloan, Nick's brother.  Terrence Howard,(Hustle & Flow), is FBI Agent Cornelius; Stanley Tucci, Ray Fuller; Richard Jenkins, Jed Lewis.  Brendan Gleeson,(In Bruges), is police chief Henry Osborne, who investigated the bank robbery; Sam Elliott, Mac McLeod; Stephen Root, Billy Cusimano.  Anna Kendrick is the journalist's friend, young FBI agent Diana; Brit Marling, Rebecca Osborne; Jackie Evancho, Isabel Grant, Grant/Sloan's 11 year old daughter.The film, like many of those directed by Redford, is slow-moving and kind of clunky.  More bothersome to me is the fact that the film's numbers don't add up.  I am old enough to remember the events upon which the underlying novel is based, when several members of the Weather Underground surrendered themselves:  in the 1980s.  When people say that Grant/Sloan, or Solarz have lived in hiding for 30 years, well, 1970 and 30 is 2000, not 2012.  Despite Director Redford's efforts to show us Actor Redford running in a limber fashion, Redford is clearly at least in his 70s.  And very few men in their 70s, with the possible exception of Cary Grant, have ever had 11 year old daughters.  For that matter, very few men in their 70s have ever had daughters in their visibly mid-twenties, as is Grant/Sloan's daughter with Lurie.  And we are told that this daughter, who looks mid-twenties and is going back to higher education, was born in 1970 or thereabouts.  Folks, she would now be in her mid-forties, probably a bit long in the tooth to be returning to higher education.  Most interestingly, an early, brief scene in the movie hints that at one time, Redford and Co. were going to place the film more accurately in time.  On her way to surrender, Solarz drives into New York State, and stops to gas up.  She stops at an ""Esso"" station, where she is arrested.  ""Esso"" changed its name to ""Exxon"" in 1973.  I doubt you could find an Esso station anywhere in the United States or Canada today.Of course, if the movie were set in its accurate time frame, today's Redford could not star.
