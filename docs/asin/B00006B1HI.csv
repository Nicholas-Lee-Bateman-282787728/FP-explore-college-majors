What I got was an excellent documentary which started out mildly enough with two French film makers following the training of a probationary firefighter in New York City.  Unfortunately for them, it looked as if they were going to make a rather run-of-the-mill, uneventful documentary.  It apparently had been a slow summer for the FDNY.  Then came the morning of September 11, 2001 and a routine call to check out a gas leak on a city street.  What followed is the most important film of that day ever.  There are no talking-head news reporters.  There are no politicians making speeches.  What we see are the firefighters in the lobby of the World Trade Center, having no idea what is really happening above them.  From their position inside the building they couldn't see what we were seeing outside.  They were kept guessing.  But they could see enough to know that people were jumping out of the building.  Although they had to wonder what could be so bad above that jumping from those upper stories was preferable to waiting for whatever happened, these firefighters also knew that it was their job to go up and meet headon with whatever those who jumped were fleeing.  This documentary shows a side of September 11 that we were not allowed to see in the media.  Everyone should see this at least once.",5,No sugar coating here,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,1377,"['watched', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'film', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'started', 'out', 'mildly', 'enough', 'two', 'French', 'film', 'makers', 'following', 'training', 'probationary', 'firefighter', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Unfortunately', 'looked', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'rather', 'run-of-the-mill', 'uneventful', 'documentary', 'apparently', 'had', 'been', 'slow', 'summer', 'FDNY', 'Then', 'came', 'morning', 'September', '11', '2001', 'routine', 'call', 'check', 'out', 'gas', 'leak', 'city', 'street', 'What', 'followed', 'most', 'important', 'film', 'day', 'ever', 'are', 'talking-head', 'news', 'reporters', 'are', 'politicians', 'making', 'speeches', 'What', 'see', 'are', 'firefighters', 'lobby', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'having', 'idea', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'position', 'building', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'were', 'seeing', 'outside', 'were', 'kept', 'guessing', 'could', 'see', 'enough', 'know', 'people', 'were', 'jumping', 'building', 'had', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'jumping', 'upper', 'stories', 'was', 'preferable', 'waiting', 'happened', 'firefighters', 'also', 'knew', 'was', 'job', 'go', 'up', 'meet', 'headon', 'who', 'jumped', 'were', 'fleeing', 'documentary', 'side', 'September', '11', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'see', 'media', 'Everyone', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once']",N/A
710726,A3UVZ1POCQVLXH,B00006B1HI,Bonnie J. Lemenager,"[1, 1]","Like many Americans, I watched this emotionally-charged documentary for the first time on 03/11/02, six months after what has come to be called the worst day in American history. I was overcome with emotion to both see and hear all of the events that unfolded on that awful day. The film is raw, gritty and filled with emotion; the extras contain more interviews held with the men of the firehouse whose intelligence, wit and humanity come shining through when they speak of what they heard, felt and saw. Tony, John, Dennis, Tommy, Steve and all of the other guys come across as the genuine article, and I was drawn in by their plain speaking and dedication to their job - their calling. It is a testament to all of the survivors and the victims of this tragedy that these men are allowed to speak, showing every emotion that must have gone through each of them on that day. Never preachy or self-aggrandizing, I really felt I got to know these men as the honorable people they were then and are today. One of the things that still strikes me when I watch this video is how both brothers, Jules and Gideon Naudet, never once try to make the unfolding story about themselves; rather, Jules makes the wonderful decision to not film the people on fire from the jet fuel in the lobby of the first Tower upon their arrival, nor does Gideon flinch from documenting what is going on around him with his own commentary - he lets the visuals speak for themselves. This is an important film and one that should be viewed every September 11th as a memorial to those that died, and as a testimony to those who lived to see such times.Robert DeNiro hosts the documentary, and what he says at both the beginning and at the end is moving, sparce and does not detract from the narrative. The ending credits will tear your heart out anew as Irish Tenor Ronan Tynan sings ""Danny Boy"" as pictures of the 343 fallen fire fighters are shown onscreen.

As an inadvertent work of history, it is many things--first and foremost a tribute to those firemen who without a second thought plunged upward into the staircases of the Towers. Think about it: 60 pounds of gear, about 70 stories to walk up, requiring about a minute per level to traverse when weighed down. Somehow they kept going, helping those poor victims back down to safety...The first part documentary focuses on the probationary period of a young fireman named Tony. The filmmakers Jules and Gedeon Daudet were ""chosen"" in some serendipitous way to cover this young man's rite of passage--and through his story, tell us the story of that horrific day through the firemen's eyes. The choosing couldn't have been better.When the towers were struck, Tony was ordered to stay behind at the station, in case further attacks happen. Gedeon was separated from his brother, who was with the firemen when the first plane struck. He trains his camera on the young man in the deserted firehouse. As Tony's watching the television, we see his anxiety and desire to act and help in some way. Eventually he disappears with a retired company chief who's come in to help. Late in the afternoon, everyone is accounted for but Tony. Then he just shows up. It's amazing: this fire company, of all those who converged on the scene, didn't suffer a single casualty.Jules Daudet kept his cameras running in the lobby as the first tower fell. As you are shown, those rescue personnel in that lobby escaped death literally by seconds as a hurricane of debris blew the lobby windows out. Jules succeeds with the others to regroup outside in the shadow of tower one. When it implodes and the debris comes crashing through the street in a tidal wave of concrete dust and papers, there's a chilling moment when silence falls, and a stray piece of paper from the tower bearing numbers becomes stuck to his lens...This is a moving & great documentary.",5,Heroes All,1046995200,"03 7, 2003",2003,2011,"['other', 'documentary', 'terrible', 'event', 'could', 'ever', 'come', 'close', 'one', 'inadvertent', 'work', 'history', 'many', 'things', 'first', 'foremost', 'tribute', 'firemen', 'who', 'second', 'thought', 'plunged', 'upward', 'staircases', 'Towers', 'Think', '60', 'pounds', 'gear', 'about', '70', 'stories', 'walk', 'up', 'requiring', 'minute', 'level', 'traverse', 'when', 'weighed', 'down', 'Somehow', 'kept', 'going', 'helping', 'poor', 'victims', 'back', 'down', 'safety', 'first', 'part', 'documentary', 'probationary', 'period', 'young', 'fireman', 'named', 'Tony', 'filmmakers', 'Jules', 'Gedeon', 'Daudet', 'were', 'chosen', 'serendipitous', 'way', 'cover', 'young', 'man', 'rite', 'passage', 'story', 'tell', 'story', 'horrific', 'day', 'firemen', 'eyes', 'choosing', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'towers', 'were', 'struck', 'Tony', 'was', 'ordered', 'stay', 'behind', 'station', 'case', 'further', 'attacks', 'happen', 'Gedeon', 'was', 'separated', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'firemen', 'when', 'first', 'plane', 'struck', 'camera', 'young', 'man', 'deserted', 'firehouse', 'Tony', 'watching', 'television', 'see', 'anxiety', 'desire', 'act', 'help', 'way', 'Eventually', 'retired', 'company', 'chief', 'who', 'come', 'help', 'Late', 'afternoon', 'everyone', 'accounted', 'Tony', 'Then', 'just', 'up', 'amazing', 'fire', 'company', 'who', 'converged', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'single', 'casualty.Jules', 'Daudet', 'kept', 'cameras', 'running', 'lobby', 'first', 'tower', 'fell', 'are', 'shown', 'rescue', 'personnel', 'lobby', 'escaped', 'death', 'literally', 'seconds', 'hurricane', 'debris', 'blew', 'lobby', 'out', 'Jules', 'others', 'regroup', 'outside', 'shadow', 'tower', 'one', 'When', 'debris', 'crashing', 'street', 'tidal', 'wave', 'concrete', 'dust', 'papers', 'chilling', 'moment', 'when', 'silence', 'stray', 'piece', 'paper', 'tower', 'bearing', 'numbers', 'stuck', 'lens', 'moving', 'great', 'documentary']",N/A

Meo ""Bargain Hunter""","[1, 6]","OK...it's been 9 years since the tragic events of 9-11 and it still seems like yesterday as I'm sure it does for most, especially those whom lost their loved-ones.I've watched this DVD each year since 2002 as well as shared with others. All agree, it is the ONLY documentary that really portrays the impact of what the rescuers, victims and bystanders experienced during the attack as well as the interviews included on the DVD.HOWEVER,I purposely have read a number of the many reviews, not all yet, just to see if anyone else found it strange that these two French brothers just 'accidentally' happened to pick a Firehouse in such close proximity to the towers for their documentary? From my first viewing, I felt an nagging suspicion (and thankfully, I normally do not have a suspicious nature)that the June commencement of their documenting this particular Firehouse may have not been coinci/accidental.It was around that time that 'terror threats' concerning a NYC attack were buzzing around CIA/FBI unbeknownst to the public.My sad and suspicious thoughts during the viewing with regard to that particular Firehouse as stated above along with a few others that I've adopted during subsequent viewings are as follows:How is it that at the exact moment of the plane crashing into the Tower 1, the group just happens to be filming the checking of gas emissions outdoors from which they have a clear view of the towers?How is it that these guys whom were only filming the adventures of a rookie fireman had so much accessible battery power for their video equipment/lights especially if they were just doing day-by-day events?How is it that it just panned out that one brother was filming the inside events while the other stayed behind and therefore able to capture the outside events?I'm sure the brothers had no idea of the havoc (towers collapsing) that would result, however, either this was planned or just Divine Intervention to get to us the MOST accurate account of America's Saddest Day.I'm still keeping faith for the latter due to the fact that miraculously not one of the firemen were killed from that Firehouse and that the brothers survived to show it to the world.Either way, WE WILL NEVER FORGET and WE BETTER NEVER STOP PRAYING for our Nation and for our World.May God have Mercy on us.PEACE.CMD RN",5,"A Horrifying up-close and personal glimpse of 9-11, HOWEVER...",1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,2318,"['OK', 'been', '9', 'years', 'tragic', 'events', '9-11', 'still', 'like', 'yesterday', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'especially', 'whom', 'lost', 'loved-ones.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'DVD', 'year', '2002', 'as', 'well', 'shared', 'others', 'agree', 'ONLY', 'documentary', 'really', 'impact', 'what', 'rescuers', 'victims', 'bystanders', 'experienced', 'attack', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'included', 'DVD.HOWEVER', 'purposely', 'have', 'read', 'number', 'many', 'reviews', 'not', 'yet', 'just', 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'found', 'two', 'French', 'brothers', 'just', ""'accidentally"", 'happened', 'pick', 'Firehouse', 'such', 'close', 'proximity', 'towers', 'documentary', 'first', 'viewing', 'felt', 'nagging', 'suspicion', 'thankfully', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'suspicious', 'nature', 'June', 'commencement', 'documenting', 'particular', 'Firehouse', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'coinci/accidental.It', 'was', 'time', 'threats', 'concerning', 'NYC', 'attack', 'were', 'buzzing', 'around', 'CIA/FBI', 'unbeknownst', 'public.My', 'sad', 'suspicious', 'thoughts', 'viewing', 'regard', 'particular', 'Firehouse', 'stated', 'along', 'few', 'others', ""'ve"", 'adopted', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'are', 'How', 'exact', 'moment', 'plane', 'crashing', 'Tower', '1', 'group', 'just', 'be', 'filming', 'checking', 'gas', 'emissions', 'outdoors', 'have', 'clear', 'view', 'towers', 'How', 'guys', 'whom', 'were', 'only', 'filming', 'adventures', 'rookie', 'fireman', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'accessible', 'battery', 'power', 'video', 'equipment/lights', 'especially', 'were', 'just', 'doing', 'day-by-day', 'events', 'How', 'just', 'panned', 'out', 'one', 'brother', 'was', 'filming', 'inside', 'events', 'other', 'stayed', 'therefore', 'able', 'capture', 'outside', 'events', ""'m"", 'sure', 'brothers', 'had', 'idea', 'havoc', 'towers', 'collapsing', 'would', 'result', 'however', 'either', 'was', 'planned', 'just', 'Divine', 'Intervention', 'get', 'MOST', 'accurate', 'account', 'America', 'Saddest', 'Day.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'keeping', 'faith', 'latter', 'due', 'fact', 'miraculously', 'not', 'one', 'firemen', 'were', 'killed', 'Firehouse', 'brothers', 'survived', 'show', 'world.Either', 'way', 'WE', 'WILL', 'NEVER', 'FORGET', 'WE', 'BETTER', 'NEVER', 'STOP', 'PRAYING', 'Nation', 'World.May', 'God', 'have', 'Mercy', 'us.PEACE.CMD', 'RN']",N/A

I had images of the carnage and horror that was 9/11 being shoved in my face..and not wanting to experience this nightmare through the misfortune of others, I refrained from seeing it. I also found a documentary on these events to be distasteful and rather exploitive. When a co-worker gushed the following day about the film, I barely paid attention. I didn't want to hear it.Cut to one year later..the anniversary of this horrible day. I knew the film would be rebroadcast and didn't plan on seeing it..but I didn't move fast enough off my couch to turn the channel or hit the remote..and that is what snagged me. I sat there and watch this film from beginning to end, never taking my eyes off it. After it was over, I cursed myself for not having watched it back in March; and more still for not having the foresight to tape it. Once I heard it was released on video, I vowed to get a copy of it.Why? Simply because it documents one of the most horrific events in history and does so in an extremely respectful and no-nonsense way. We don't need to see the blood and gore that we already know was a result of these terrorist attacks; we have the common sense to know that witnessing *live* the collapse of the Trade Centers will result in nothing less then maimed and battered bodies. We also don't need to see people falling to their deaths. We have the audio to prove it. :( This part of the film is one of the most unnerving things to ""witness"". I will never forget it.One of the things I liked best about this film is that it does not seek to exploit the tragedy that is 9/11. It was made for the sole purpose of documenting a probie firefighters' first few months on the job. That one of their runs happened to be the World Trade Center attack is eerily ironic..and who's to say that had this attrocity never occured that the filmakers would not have released this film on tv or video, *anyway*? That it happened to capture such a tragic event in history is a ""blessing"" in disguise because they caught scenes that were captured nowhere else of an event that will go down in history. It also added drama to an otherwise non-eventful film..hence, the irony.. But more importantly, it showed the *humane* side of two filmakers, who could have taken it upon themselves to exploit a very painful and tragic situation, and *didn't*. This is the thing that stands out the most for me and why, above all other films out there about this tragedy, I want *this* one. This film is about *hereos*..and the making of heroes..and an extraordinary day in the life of heroes..as much as it is about the World Trade Center attacks. It is respectful..it is honest..it is real..and it doesn't pretend to be anything but a film about the making of a firefighter..who just happened to come face to face with the horror that is 9/11..and it is also about two French filmaking brothers whose only goal was to set out to capture a fireman in the making..and wound up capturing history, instead.",5,The most important and respectful account of 9/11...,1031961600,"09 14, 2002",2002,3054,"['When', 'documentary', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'March', 'refused', 'watch', 'had', 'images', 'carnage', 'horror', 'was', '9/11', 'being', 'shoved', 'face..and', 'not', 'wanting', 'experience', 'nightmare', 'misfortune', 'others', 'refrained', 'seeing', 'also', 'found', 'documentary', 'events', 'be', 'distasteful', 'rather', 'exploitive', 'When', 'co-worker', 'gushed', 'following', 'day', 'film', 'barely', 'paid', 'attention', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'it.Cut', 'one', 'year', 'later..the', 'anniversary', 'horrible', 'day', 'knew', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'rebroadcast', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'seeing', 'it..but', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'fast', 'enough', 'couch', 'turn', 'channel', 'hit', 'remote..and', 'what', 'snagged', 'sat', 'watch', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'never', 'taking', 'eyes', 'was', 'cursed', 'not', 'having', 'watched', 'back', 'March', 'more', 'still', 'not', 'having', 'foresight', 'tape', 'Once', 'heard', 'was', 'released', 'video', 'vowed', 'get', 'copy', 'it.Why', 'Simply', 'documents', 'one', 'most', 'horrific', 'events', 'history', 'so', 'extremely', 'respectful', 'no-nonsense', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'blood', 'gore', 'already', 'know', 'was', 'result', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'have', 'common', 'sense', 'know', 'witnessing', 'collapse', 'Trade', 'Centers', 'will', 'result', 'nothing', 'then', 'maimed', 'battered', 'bodies', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'people', 'falling', 'deaths', 'have', 'audio', 'prove', 'part', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'unnerving', 'things', 'witness', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'it.One', 'things', 'liked', 'best', 'film', 'not', 'seek', 'exploit', 'tragedy', '9/11', 'was', 'made', 'sole', 'purpose', 'documenting', 'probie', 'firefighters', 'first', 'few', 'months', 'job', 'one', 'runs', 'happened', 'be', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'attack', 'eerily', 'ironic..and', 'who', 'say', 'had', 'attrocity', 'never', 'occured', 'filmakers', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'released', 'film', 'tv', 'video', '*anyway*', 'happened', 'capture', 'tragic', 'event', 'history', 'blessing', 'disguise', 'caught', 'scenes', 'were', 'captured', 'nowhere', 'else', 'event', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'also', 'added', 'drama', 'otherwise', 'non-eventful', 'film..hence', 'irony..', 'more', 'importantly', 'showed', '*humane*', 'side', 'two', 'filmakers', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'exploit', 'very', 'painful', 'tragic', 'situation', ""*didn't*"", 'thing', 'out', 'most', 'why', 'other', 'films', 'there', 'tragedy', 'want', '*this*', 'one', 'film', 'making', 'heroes..and', 'extraordinary', 'day', 'life', 'heroes..as', 'much', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'respectful..it', 'honest..it', 'real..and', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'film', 'making', 'firefighter..who', 'just', 'happened', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'horror', '9/11..and', 'also', 'about', 'two', 'French', 'filmaking', 'brothers', 'only', 'goal', 'was', 'set', 'out', 'capture', 'fireman', 'making..and', 'wound', 'up', 'capturing', 'history', 'instead']",N/A

I rented the film as soon as it became available, and reviewed it. I could feel the raw disbelief of that sunny morning in September.I appreciate the Naudet brothers' accomplishment; they both document but don't succumb to the temptation to show everything they encountered. Upon entering the lobby of Tower One, screams of a burn victim are heard, but the camera is panned down at the floor to maintain a respectful 'distance'- for lack of a better word. This seemed to me most appropriate, and I like their sensitivity dealing with awful events.One aspect unedited is the sound, a terrible intermittent thumping in the background: the sound of the jumpers.In the midst of filming, the brothers were separated for over 4 hours, during which the towers fell. The film continues, but an awful tension builds as the viewer waits to find out if both the brothers have survived (one brother was briefly inside a tower before it collapsed)One also gets a glimse of the rapid response of the firefighters and Mayor Guliani's administration. His presence at Ground Zero to assist and support the many helpers present was awesome. I recall thinking what a great president he would make (no disrespect meant to President Bush)I recommend this film to anyone who wants a sense of what it felt to be near Ground Zero that day.",5,Unforgettable,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,1425,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'March', '2002', 'CBS', 'mentioned', 'elsewhere', 'eyewitness', 'coverage', 'tragedy', 'rented', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'became', 'available', 'reviewed', 'could', 'feel', 'raw', 'disbelief', 'sunny', 'morning', 'September.I', 'appreciate', 'Naudet', 'brothers', 'accomplishment', 'document', 'do', ""n't"", 'succumb', 'temptation', 'show', 'everything', 'encountered', 'entering', 'lobby', 'Tower', 'One', 'screams', 'burn', 'victim', 'are', 'heard', 'camera', 'panned', 'down', 'floor', 'maintain', 'respectful', ""'distance'-"", 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'seemed', 'most', 'appropriate', 'like', 'sensitivity', 'dealing', 'awful', 'events.One', 'aspect', 'unedited', 'sound', 'terrible', 'intermittent', 'thumping', 'background', 'sound', 'jumpers.In', 'midst', 'filming', 'brothers', 'were', 'separated', '4', 'hours', 'towers', 'fell', 'film', 'awful', 'tension', 'builds', 'viewer', 'find', 'out', 'brothers', 'have', 'survived', 'one', 'brother', 'was', 'briefly', 'tower', 'collapsed', 'One', 'also', 'glimse', 'rapid', 'response', 'firefighters', 'Mayor', 'Guliani', 'administration', 'presence', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'assist', 'support', 'many', 'helpers', 'present', 'was', 'awesome', 'recall', 'thinking', 'what', 'great', 'president', 'would', 'make', 'disrespect', 'meant', 'President', 'Bush', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'sense', 'what', 'felt', 'be', 'near', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'day']",N/A

710739,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,B00006B1HI,Dave Beards,"[1, 1]","Living in Australia, it was quite hard to really appreciate the horror that New Yorkers faced on the morning of 9/11/01. I, like everyone else, saw the most horridly graphic images on TV, and was deeply moved and disturbed to not only see such barbaric death, but to also realise that if such a disgusting act could be commited on US soil, then it could happen anywhere. Though New york is thousands of miles from Australia- how could I really appreciate the impact on their lives?Then I came across this DVD. I was in two minds about buying it - did I really want to see those graphic images again? Once it had arrived, it was a few weeks before I actually watched it. But I'm glad I did....I don't think I have seen such a well crafted documentary. Initially concieved as a documentary on a rookie firefighter, the crew were filming near the WTC when the first plane hit. This, of course, changed the course the documentary. But this isn't a documentary on what happened at the WTC on 9/11, but rather it is a look through the eyes of the firefighters who were responding to a situation that no one could have predicted to turn out as it did. What is so compelling about this documentary though is you are actually there with the firefighters - in the lobby of the first tower to be hit, you are there when they collapse - you get to see the danger they faced, and their sensitive professionalism. This is by no means a piece of sensational trash - there are no carbon copy 'reporters' with lucid tones designed to stir the emotion and thereby increase their ratings. But rather you have the story told by firefighters, and the camera lense which went side by side with the firefighters...Is it sad?? Yes. Do you want to relive the horror of that day? Perhaps not. But one thing this DVD will show you is that when faced with adversity, the human spirit can be an amazing thing.Firefighters (and others such as police, rescue workers, paramedics etc) are the real heros of this world. They are the ones who make a REAL difference in our lives.",5,A sensationalist piece of trash???

710740,A1FL9JCI32TC0Y,B00006B1HI,"D. Colley ""daz78""","[16, 16]","Never before have I watched a documentary and journeyed through a whole range of human emotions - shock, disbelief, sadness, horror, terror, anger, and respect (towards ALL the brave firemen and emergency services who put their lives before everything else on that fateful day). I cannot guarantee that this is the best documentary of the events of that day, as I have yet to see any others. However, if it is not, then I would be very surprised.9/11 is, in a way, the Zapruder film of the 21st century. Like the Zapruder film the video camera captures an event in history that is unbelievable as well as shocking. I am sure that Jules Naudet's video clip of the first plane hitting Trade Tower 1 will be dissected and analyzed even more than Zapruder's film.I am sure that any material relating to that horrific day on September 11th will provoke all kinds of emotions to all kinds of people. However, Jules and Gedeon Naudet's documentary is a sincere and tragic testimony to the people who perished whilst simply going about their normal ordinary lives.Starting out as simply a `boy to man' documentary following `probie' Tony Benatanos, the documentary is remarkable in that sense alone. We see the life of a blue collar young man who wants to be a fireman not for money or prestige, but to be simply a hero and to save lives. At the beginning though, he has to do mundane tasks whilst his rights of passage, his `first fire', remains elusive.As this DVD has a lot of insightful reviews already, there is no point going into the events that lead up to the first attack, as they have been explained better by others. However, I will try and explain why this DVD is a soul searching journey of hope and bravery in the wake of so much horror.For a film that shows 3000 people perishing, there is little graphic footage. The `whacking' sound of people hitting the floor below the towers is enough, and to show physical evidence of this serves little purpose as one can imagine the terror and the destructive energy that these poor people suffer. Jules, who is, ironically, the brother who hardly does the filming, sees two burning people in the lobby of the first tower but doesn't have the desire to film them. In this, I think that the two French filmmakers remain with integrity as well as courage.The footage inside the lobby is really tense with the sound of crashing outside and the thought of climbing 80 floors of stairs. We know, post-9/11, the fate of the building, yet we watch with strained hearts as the firemen remain in the lobby of a building we know will be raised to the ground within a matter of minutes.The scene that fills the viewer with hope is the one when the already exhausted firemen of Ladder 1 are called back out to search for victims in gruelling 24 hour shifts. They have to sign a list first and they do not hesitate even though the dangers are not yet over.This DVD is for all kinds of viewers, whether they be experts on what happened, or just simply somebody who wishes to relive the day that reshaped history. I think that even if the relatives could brave themselves to find out exactly what happened that day, then they could watch this and feel no malice, or cheap exploitation of the tragedy.This is by far, the best documentary I have ever watched. It was on British television on the anniversary of the attacks and stupidly, I missed it. Having bought it, I value every penny spent on it.",5,Lest We Forget...,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,3431,"['Never', 'before', 'have', 'watched', 'documentary', 'journeyed', 'whole', 'range', 'human', 'emotions', 'shock', 'disbelief', 'sadness', 'horror', 'terror', 'anger', 'respect', 'brave', 'firemen', 'emergency', 'services', 'who', 'put', 'lives', 'everything', 'else', 'fateful', 'day', 'can', 'not', 'guarantee', 'best', 'documentary', 'events', 'day', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'others', 'However', 'not', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'surprised.9/11', 'way', 'Zapruder', 'film', '21st', 'century', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'video', 'camera', 'event', 'history', 'unbelievable', 'as', 'well', 'shocking', 'am', 'sure', 'Jules', 'Naudet', 'video', 'clip', 'first', 'plane', 'hitting', 'Trade', 'Tower', '1', 'will', 'be', 'dissected', 'analyzed', 'even', 'more', 'Zapruder', 'film.I', 'am', 'sure', 'material', 'relating', 'horrific', 'day', 'September', '11th', 'will', 'provoke', 'kinds', 'emotions', 'kinds', 'people', 'However', 'Jules', 'Gedeon', 'Naudet', 'documentary', 'sincere', 'tragic', 'testimony', 'people', 'who', 'perished', 'whilst', 'simply', 'going', 'normal', 'ordinary', 'lives.Starting', 'out', 'simply', 'boy', 'man', 'documentary', 'following', 'probie', 'Tony', 'Benatanos', 'documentary', 'remarkable', 'sense', 'alone', 'see', 'life', 'blue', 'collar', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'fireman', 'not', 'money', 'prestige', 'be', 'simply', 'hero', 'save', 'lives', 'beginning', 'do', 'mundane', 'tasks', 'whilst', 'rights', 'passage', 'first', 'fire', 'elusive.As', 'DVD', 'lot', 'insightful', 'reviews', 'already', 'point', 'going', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'first', 'attack', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'better', 'others', 'However', 'will', 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'DVD', 'soul', 'searching', 'journey', 'hope', 'bravery', 'wake', 'so', 'much', 'horror.For', 'film', '3000', 'people', 'perishing', 'little', 'graphic', 'footage', 'whacking', 'sound', 'people', 'hitting', 'floor', 'towers', 'enough', 'show', 'physical', 'evidence', 'little', 'purpose', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'terror', 'destructive', 'energy', 'poor', 'people', 'suffer', 'Jules', 'who', 'ironically', 'brother', 'who', 'hardly', 'filming', 'two', 'burning', 'people', 'lobby', 'first', 'tower', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'film', 'think', 'two', 'French', 'filmmakers', 'remain', 'integrity', 'as', 'well', 'courage.The', 'footage', 'lobby', 'really', 'tense', 'sound', 'crashing', 'outside', 'thought', 'climbing', '80', 'floors', 'stairs', 'know', 'post-9/11', 'fate', 'building', 'watch', 'strained', 'hearts', 'firemen', 'remain', 'lobby', 'building', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'raised', 'ground', 'matter', 'minutes.The', 'scene', 'viewer', 'hope', 'one', 'when', 'already', 'exhausted', 'firemen', 'Ladder', '1', 'are', 'called', 'back', 'search', 'victims', 'gruelling', '24', 'hour', 'shifts', 'have', 'sign', 'list', 'first', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'even', 'dangers', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'over.This', 'DVD', 'kinds', 'viewers', 'be', 'experts', 'happened', 'just', 'simply', 'somebody', 'who', 'relive', 'day', 'reshaped', 'history', 'think', 'even', 'relatives', 'could', 'brave', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'day', 'then', 'could', 'watch', 'feel', 'malice', 'cheap', 'exploitation', 'tragedy.This', 'far', 'best', 'documentary', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'was', 'British', 'television', 'anniversary', 'attacks', 'stupidly', 'missed', 'Having', 'bought', 'value', 'penny', 'spent']",N/A
710741,A3LA8WLE0RQ4MB,B00006B1HI,"D. Movahedpour ""doeadear""","[298, 303]","This film is the &quot;accidental documentary&quot; made by French brothers and film makers, Gedeon and Jules Naudet. The brothers were making a film about a young fire fighter during his 9-month probationary period. With the help of their friend, firefighter James Hanlon, there were given nearly unlimited access to all the goings-on at the firehouse, Engine 7, Ladder 1, on Duane Street in Lower Manhattan, less than ten blocks from the World Trade Center. Little did the brothers know that they would be the witness to history, just three months after they began their project.Gedeon is the older brother, and the avid film maker. But, by the time of 9/11, an additional camera had been purchased for Jules for &quot;camera practice.&quot; Jules is with the Battalion Chief, Joseph Pfeifer, and 13 other fire fighters from the house, filming as they investigate an odor of gas at 8:46 am on Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001. They are standing in the path of the plane as it flies over and hits Tower 1, and Jules is filming the entire time. His is the only footage of the attack on Tower 1. The reaction of the firefighters is immediate, as they take off for the Trade Center, a place they previously would visit up to five times a day on a shift. They know the Trade Center perhaps better than any other firehouse in Manhattan. But, nothing has prepared them for this.What transpires is the only known footage of the struggle of the firefighters inside Tower 1 as they try to figure out what to do in the chaos and confusion. They had seen it all, they thought, but this was something they hadn't prepared for. The film is very sensitively edited, so you don't see the blood or the gore or the bodies, you only hear about them. The focus in this film is on the brotherhood of the firemen, what was going on in the towers while the rest of the world looked on, helplessly. How men who make less money than half of the City are the ones who rush into the burning buildings, and who do not hesitate to lay down their lives while saving others. It is the tale of a true brotherhood, of men who are doing jobs handed down to them from generations before. It is more than a story of 9/11, it is the story of the world of New York fire fighters.Before 9/11 happens, we see the inside of the firehouse, how the young &quot;Probie&quot;, Tony Benatanos, is brought into the fold, how the firemen interact and eat together and needle each other. The French brothers did not set out to make a documentary on 9/11, certainly, but fate dealt a hand. This is the most extensive, mind-boggling film, and the DVD contains extended interviews with the firemen, who have seen so much, but still seem to be in shock about what they saw that day.James Hanlon narrates this film beautifully, and the brothers are interviewed describing that terrible day.

They inadvertantly filmed the most brazen attack on the United States by a foreign entity, ever.  The images are stunning.  The sounds even more so.  Who can forget that day.  I know exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard about the attacks.  I'll bet you do, too.I was watching CBS while the events were unfolding.  It was well presented until Dan Rather replaced the morning anchor.  He pissed me off with his ""unconfirmed"" reports of everything that happened that day.  Seeing it from the Naudet's perspective was refreshing and all-too-real.I must make just one objection; not of the documentary, but to some of the reviewers on this site.  It seems that some people in America 'can't stomach' the reality of death.  That they need documentaries to be sterile and without gore.  9/11 does an admirable job of just that.  It is devoid of gore or bloodshed.  However, a documentary is supposed to be entirely factual, recording pleasant and unpleasant events.  Some Americans want all their news and info to be sanitized before they digest it.  It is self-delusion.  I didn't wan't to see anyone die on this day, but it happened.  Sometimes, it is exactly this kind of exposure that people need to wake them up to the reality of terrorism and war.  I mention war because the war in Iraq is largely sanitized and censored by the government and corporate media.The French-native Naudet's were lauded for their incredible filming that day.  Lately, however, anyone and anything French has been banished as cowardly and unpatriotic (remember the ridiculous ""Freedom Fries"" at the cafeteria in Congress?)  I can only imagine how confused some of these part-time patriots are about Frenchmen filming such an American story.  Shame on them.  They hate on a whim.  They follow like sheep.

It's literally a video account, second-by-second, of the events in New York from the street level, and even inside the one of the towers as the morning unfolded.When I first saw this DVD for sale a year ago, I thought to myself ""great, ANOTHER September 11th dvd"" and put it down thinking it was just another compilation of archival news footage mixed with interviews of people that were there.  This past Monday (the 5th anniversary) I watched a national tv news channel's streaming video footage on their site in real time of September 11th, 2001.  I noticed the lack of footage of the first plane hitting.  Then I remembered that footage didn't show up until later, and how it was shot by some french documentarians by accident.  Anyway, I looked into it and found this DVD, again.Watching this DVD is probably the most accurate way to get a sense of what happened there in New York, and effective way to conjure all of our memories of watching at home.  This is exactly what it was like.  There is no truer representation.  You're sitting there watching this, and you're getting into the feel of the documentary and the firefighters and the rookie, and all that.....then ""I heard a plane and it was weird because you don't normally hear planes on Manhattan.  So we all looked up and...""Thats when it all comes back.  You go back.  But now you're seeing everything, everything, from the street.  From the fire engine.  From the WTC lobby.  From inside the rubble.  From under the dust.  And your heart goes right back to where it was on that day, in the exact same state of confusion and overwhelming emotions of all kinds.It's all shown here exactly how we each lived it, where ever we were, but through the life of the firehouse that day. First-hand.  Life as usual, mundane, monotonous, trivial.  And then we were thrown into this insane situation, and struggling each second to figure out what the **** was going on and what we should do.  By the way, there is a bit of ""foul"" language heard in the film.....because people just watched a plane fly into a building!  If you're offended by four-letter words, then you probably shouldn't watch this film since it shows many much, much more offensive things....such as hi-jacked planes flying into the World Trade Center.  (Something is seriously wrong with you if you can watch this in it's entirity and somehow still be more worked up over a firefighter saying the F word, than of the attacks and losses themselves)This IS reality.

NaudetFrench filmmakers Jules and Gedeon Naudet set out to make a documentary about a rookie firefighter in New York City, and wound up capturing on film an unrivaled insider's account of the horrific events of 9/11 and the fire company that was among the first on the scene at the World Trade Center.  Every aspect of the storytelling is superb:  excellent narration, heartfelt interviews with the firefighters and some incredible camera shots, including the only image of the jet plane crashing into Tower No. 1 of the World Trade Center.There is a lot of emotion packed into this documentary, and it is impossible not to be touched in some way by the story.  What struck me was the camaraderie and sense of purpose among the men of the firehouse (Engine 7, Ladder, 1, Battalion 1) and the resolve of those approaching Ground Zero to help save as many victims as possible, even though they knew almost nothing about the circumstances of what was happening on 9/11.  The participation by the Naudet brothers added an interesting angle to the story, as they became part of the company (""yesterday you had one brother; today you have fifty"").The version that CBS aired on March 10, 2002, with Robert De Niro as host, was slightly shorter than this DVD version, which has a run time of 129 minutes (no De Niro) plus 53 minutes of testimony (""interviews"") from the firefighters seen in the documentary.  In describing how they felt when the first call went out and when the Tower No. 2 fell, the guys reveal much about the interaction between emotion and purpose while responding to a catastrophic turn of events, and about the conflict felt when those who are the best trained in the world at saving lives are ordered to evacuate a scene.The imagery and personalities in the documentary will last forever . . . so we won't forget.",5,A documentary like no other,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,1908,"['single', 'cell', 'body', 'telling', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'here', 'G.', 'NaudetFrench', 'filmmakers', 'Jules', 'Gedeon', 'Naudet', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'documentary', 'rookie', 'firefighter', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'wound', 'up', 'capturing', 'film', 'unrivaled', 'insider', 'account', 'horrific', 'events', '9/11', 'fire', 'company', 'was', 'first', 'scene', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Every', 'aspect', 'storytelling', 'superb', 'excellent', 'narration', 'heartfelt', 'interviews', 'firefighters', 'incredible', 'camera', 'shots', 'including', 'only', 'image', 'jet', 'plane', 'crashing', 'Tower', 'No', '1', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center.There', 'lot', 'emotion', 'packed', 'documentary', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'touched', 'way', 'story', 'What', 'struck', 'was', 'camaraderie', 'sense', 'purpose', 'men', 'firehouse', 'Engine', '7', 'Ladder', '1', 'Battalion', '1', 'resolve', 'approaching', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'help', 'save', 'many', 'victims', 'possible', 'even', 'knew', 'almost', 'nothing', 'circumstances', 'what', 'was', 'happening', '9/11', 'participation', 'Naudet', 'brothers', 'added', 'interesting', 'angle', 'story', 'became', 'part', 'company', 'yesterday', 'had', 'one', 'brother', 'today', 'have', 'fifty', '.The', 'version', 'CBS', 'aired', 'March', '10', '2002', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'host', 'was', 'slightly', 'shorter', 'DVD', 'version', 'run', 'time', '129', 'minutes', 'De', 'Niro', '53', 'minutes', 'testimony', 'interviews', 'firefighters', 'seen', 'documentary', 'describing', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'first', 'call', 'went', 'out', 'when', 'Tower', 'No', '2', 'fell', 'guys', 'reveal', 'much', 'interaction', 'emotion', 'purpose', 'responding', 'catastrophic', 'turn', 'events', 'conflict', 'felt', 'when', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'trained', 'world', 'saving', 'lives', 'are', 'ordered', 'evacuate', 'scene.The', 'imagery', 'personalities', 'documentary', 'will', 'last', 'forever', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget']",N/A

There are other moments in the film which point to an inside job also:The impact itself has been analyzed for the ""flash"" in videos like ""In Plane Site.""  (Honestly, with all the undeniable controlled demolition evidence, the pod-flash is a non-issue.) What also grabbed my attention were two following anomalies:  on the very top floor there appears to be detonation-like dust coming from the windows, separate from the dark color which characterizes the smoke from the impact fireball.  Secondly, a few seconds after the plane impact, there is a separate explosion which is clearly heard all these many blocks away.In the lobby of the north tower, there is clearly high-explosive blast damage.  The horrific moment Jules describes but does not film of a woman on fire in the lobby doorway has been explained as a fireball raging down the elevator shaft.  However, the building was hermetically sealed, meaning airtight.  It is more likely that some type of ground level blast caused this human casualty.  Next, I don't doubt Jules about some of those loud bangs being people hitting the ground, but I think that at least a couple of them were explosions based on my own listening and viewing the footage.  One particular incident really sounds like a blast more than a thud, and a number of firefighters simultaneously stop what they are doing and turn toward the direction of the blast, as if to suggest they were reacting to a bomb.Finally, certain members of the 9/11 truth movement have mentioned that ""The Wrong Tower Fell First,"" namely, the tower second to be hit was first to collapse.  Jules Naudet and the firefighters are in the lobby of the North Tower when the other tower collapses, which is arguably the most hair-raising part of the film.  Indeed, if the correct tower had fallen first, this documentary would not exist.  This surprise is echoed right there on the day, by another firehouse conversation not as often quoted.  In this conversation, they mentioned that ""Tower Two collapsed while we were still in Tower One.""  ""Tower Two collapsed first??!!""  ""I can't figure this out...""The reviewer who said this would be the Zapruder film of the 21st century couldn't have been more dead-on-target.

Little did they know, the time that this documentary was taking place, they were about to witness the most tragic day in American history: Septemper 11th, 2001. It's absolutely amazing. It's just so heartpounding and sickening that alot of people couldn't handle. We are exposed to horrific imagery, sound (The several loud, crash-like thumps of falling bodies scared the crap outta me), and real emotions. This is no Hollywood film with treachly tearjerking moments, this is REAL. I felt like bawling during the scenes with several firefighters exchanging hugs. It makes you cry with extreme sadness over such a tragedy, the heroism and anger over such a cowardly act that the highjackers have done.It's something to have in your DVD library and I totally recommend it.

The sounds of the first tower collapsing or bodies hitting the ground become forgettable, even without (thankfully) the accompanying images.  Ultimately, the shots when the camera shows nothing because of the enveloping cloud of dust and debris become as memorable as the repeated images of the towers collapsing.  Equally memorable are the shots of the firefighters in the lobby of the WTC, the windows all blown out by the initial impact, waiting for instructions to head up the stairs 80 stories to the fire, knowing that it takes a firefighter in full gear one minute to climb one flight of stairs.&quot;9-11&quot; also reminds us, least we had forgotten, that even on a day like that truth is stranger than fiction.  The story that is told here would be totally dismissed by Hollywood and it is hard to believe the ending of this documentary even though the evidence of what really happened to this company of NYC Firefighters is right there on camera.  The only reason we can see this story is because there was someone there to film it, otherwise we never would have believed it for a single moment.

Originally a documentary on a rookie New York City firefighter, two French brothers, G&eacute;d&eacute;on and Jules Naudet, spent several weeks with a local firehouse in lower Manhattan, filming a documentary of what it was like to become of New York's bravest. Little did they know that they were about to film not only one of the most evil acts of terrorism and cowardice the world has ever seen, but they captured the spirits, the strength, and the passion that united the world together as Americans for the first time.The Naudet brothers, who captured the moments of impact for both American Airlines flight #11 (a flight that was mentioned before in the film ""Two Guys and a Girl"" as a flight that brought the two female characters into the lives of a cowardly, cheating liar, hence bad news) and United Airlines flight 175 crashed into both towers of the World Trade Center. They also captured the final moments of many great heroes who lost their lives that day, not only firefighter such as the beloved Fire Department, Mychal Judge, but also the moments of desperation that led many to leap to their deaths rather than perish in a building bound to collapse (the sounds of bodies thumping in the background is extremely disturbing). The Naudet brothers deserved the utmost respect for their dedication and strength in capturing an important chapter of the history of this new century and millennium. While many might say that the French are anti-American, the Naudet brothers stood proud and tall, and supported their American brothers in their day of need.Originally airing on CBS, ""9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition"" is an important title not only to have in your library, but it should be viewed to remember those we lost on that tragic day and most importantly, the spirit of the free, democracy, non-fanatical world that united together to pray for a better future for our children. Moving, touching, nostalgic are the words I can think of when I saw this film. As a former employee who worked at the World Trade Center (65th floor of Tower 1) this tragedy hit me even more so because I was on my way to the towers later that morning.The end of innocence might have occurred that morning, however this film is just like the flag at Ft.

Rognlien,"[18, 18]","I've always been a visual person.. in school, at work, I always have to see things in order to make sense of them.9/11 was no different.  I, like most people around the world, was glued to the TV for days after 9/11, watching stories of survivors and of those lost, piecing together what had happened in an attempt to fully understand what happened.Unlike most media coverage of 9/11, this DVD focuses on one of the many families in NYC - that of a firehouse 7 blocks from what was once the WTC.  The brothers who made this had been invited in pre-9/11 to make a documentary of the 'coming-of-age' of a junior firefighter who joins the department as a &quot;proby&quot; .. but as with everything else in the world on 9/11, took a completely different form after the first plane hit Tower 1 of the WTC.It is heartbreaking, inspiring, horrifying and even uplifting all at the same time.  The company documented was indeed rare - all of its fighters lived to tell their stories (often as voice-overs for amazing footage taken from inside Tower 1 as everything was going on) and through the sights and sounds captured, 9/11 makes a bit more sense.The word &quot;hero&quot; has been thrown around a lot in the last year, describing everyone from firefighters to postal workers and volunteers.  But to see these guys go into the buildings and selflessy go about doing their work is the most inspiring thing I've seen since 9/11.  While it's sometimes hard to watch, it puts the horrible events in NYC on that day into perspective, and makes you realize that if people who barely escaped with their lives - in spite of losing so many others - can go on, so can the rest of us.",5,Simply Unbelievable,1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,1669,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'visual', 'person..', 'school', 'work', 'always', 'have', 'see', 'things', 'order', 'make', 'sense', 'them.9/11', 'was', 'different', 'most', 'people', 'world', 'was', 'glued', 'TV', 'days', '9/11', 'watching', 'stories', 'survivors', 'lost', 'piecing', 'together', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'attempt', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'most', 'media', 'coverage', '9/11', 'DVD', 'one', 'many', 'families', 'NYC', 'firehouse', '7', 'blocks', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'WTC', 'brothers', 'who', 'made', 'had', 'been', 'invited', 'pre-9/11', 'make', 'documentary', ""'coming-of-age"", ""'"", 'junior', 'firefighter', 'who', 'department', 'quot', 'quot', 'everything', 'else', 'world', '9/11', 'took', 'completely', 'different', 'form', 'first', 'plane', 'hit', 'Tower', '1', 'WTC.It', 'heartbreaking', 'inspiring', 'horrifying', 'even', 'uplifting', 'same', 'time', 'company', 'documented', 'was', 'indeed', 'rare', 'fighters', 'lived', 'tell', 'stories', 'often', 'voice-overs', 'amazing', 'footage', 'taken', 'inside', 'Tower', '1', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'sights', 'sounds', 'captured', '9/11', 'bit', 'more', 'sense.The', 'word', 'quot', 'hero', 'quot', 'been', 'thrown', 'lot', 'last', 'year', 'describing', 'everyone', 'firefighters', 'postal', 'workers', 'volunteers', 'see', 'guys', 'go', 'buildings', 'selflessy', 'go', 'doing', 'work', 'most', 'inspiring', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', '9/11', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'watch', 'horrible', 'events', 'NYC', 'day', 'perspective', 'realize', 'people', 'who', 'barely', 'escaped', 'lives', 'spite', 'losing', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'can', 'go', 'so', 'can', 'rest']",N/A

It is an amazing look back every time you watch it.  This DVD includes the expandend version of the film, 129 minutes.  It includes a whole hour never seen on CBS.  9/11 begins with following a New York firefighter thorough his nine month probitionary period.  Jules and Gedeon Naudet are the filmakers.  The original plan was to make a documentary on a firefighter, instead of 9/11.  Of 99 &quot;probies,&quot; the choose Tony Benatadoes.  When arriving at his firehouse, engine 7, ladder 1 downtown, he barely fought any fires.They follow him all the way the original plan to 9/10/01.  The next day, the firefighters are called out.  Jules takes his camera for camera practice. The firefighters went to the odor of gas in the street a few minutes away from the WTC.  At 8:46 A.M, a plane engine was heard.  Jules tilts his camera up just in time to film the only existing footage of the plane hitting tower 1.  They got in the car and rode down to the WTC.  Jules asks Batallion Chief Joseph Pfiefer if he could come into the lobby.  He let him.  You see the inside of the lobby after the plane hit.  All the windows were blown out.  The elevators were blocked out, so they had to climb 80 stories to get to the fire.Then, a second plane hit.  This time, it was tower 2.  Chunks of the plane engine landed blocks away.  Gedeon was at the firehouse with Tony.  He wondered where his brother was.  Soon, in the lobby of twoer 1, the second tower fell.  They were in the lobby and ran.  They had to get out.  When they got out, they plotted their next move.  But next, the first tower fell.  They saw it collapse, and ran.Soon Gedeon realizes, where's my brother?  They get back to the firehouse, and he asks if anybody has seen Jules?  He showed up behind him. Gedeon was happy.  But then they realized, Where is Tony?  Tony went with the retired chief and returned safely.  The next day, they had to go back to dig for surviviors. Barely any were found.  At the end of the program, there is a tribute to all of the firefighters that lost their lives on September 11.  That ends the show.Also on this disk, there are interviews.  These 16 minute interviews explore more in depth of what happens.  That ends this filmaker's commerative edition.  I rate this show five stars.  This is the best 9/11 documentary I have seen.

Sure enough, one of his first real duties occurred on September 11, 2001.  The opening shots of the plane hitting The World Trade Center was ingraned into everyone.  There is no editing, every word is captured and every reaction.  Naudet and a fire chief head to the Towers in the middle of that attack.  Hauntingly there are images of the Department Chiefs who died- Ray Downey, Bill Feehan, and others who died inside the Towers getting thousands out.  The inspiring is the fact that no one in THIS FIRE COMPANY DIED, but they were all hurt and scarred by this tragedy.  The film is an honest account of what that day was like for the New York Fire Department, and was a lense view that caught the front line emergency responders, and throngs of New Yorkers fleeing the death, destruction, and collapse of the Towers.

710775,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00006B1HI,Patrick L. Randall,"[170, 175]","Words still fail to properly express the absolute horror endured by all who experienced 9/11, either firsthand or over the television.  This documentary of that awful day, filmed by French filmmakers Gedeon and Jules Naudet, provides a medium where viewers can relive, but yet, come to terms, with the horrors of that day.  Given the enormous wealth of footage taken that day, it was only a matter of time before that material was put together into some kind of video record.  When word came down that, in early March, documentary footage shot by the Naudet brothers would be broadcast without interruption on CBS, I felt both apprehension and anticipation.  I was in anticipation because I needed to see it in order to come to terms in my own mind with the events that happened.  I was concerned about the prospect of this documentary because there were chances that it could be superficial and/or exploitive, which would have been a tremendous shame.  Much to my relief, the Naudets' ""9/11"" special was nothing like that.  It presents both a factual and honorable record of that day.The circumstances by which the Naudet brothers ended up filming on the front line of the worst U.S. disaster since Pearl Harbor were quite interesting.  The filmmakers, who got the only video footage from inside the WTC after the attack, were initially in New York to film a documentary about the journey of a fireman from young academy recruit to tested veteran.  Interviews with the recruits of the FDNY academy lead the Naudets to select Tony Benetatos as the subject of their film.  He seemed to embody the idealism and determination that were crucial to a member of the FDNY.  With the assistance of firefighting friend, James Hanlon, the Naudets were able to follow Benetatos as he was assigned to Hanlon's firehouse, Engine 7, Ladder 1.  Throughout the summer, they tracked him as he was getting educated in the ways of being a fireman.  Right up until the evening of September 10th, the documentary footage was of a jovial, albeit uneventful, nature.  That would all change the next morning.  As Gedeon Naudet was the more accomplished camera man, Jules would frequently go out with the firemen on any call in order to perfect his camera technique.  This morning, Jules went out early with Battalion Chief, Joseph Pfeifer, and several others to investigate a gas leak 10 blocks south of the WTC.  What happened next was caught on film and among the most chilling images anyone has every seen.  Something seemed to roar overhead and everyone looked up to see commercial airliner flying dangerously low.  A few seconds later, every one's gaze (as well as the camera's) was trained on the North Tower of the WTC, and all watched in horror as plane slammed into its upper floors.  This IS the only known footage of the first plane hitting.  Instantly, Pfeifer and the rest of the firemen call in disaster and proceed directly to the site, with Jules tagging along with the permission of Chief Pfeifer.  Everyone knows the sequence of events that happened next, with second plane crashing and both towers coming down.  However, it is because of Jules Naudet's camera work that people have an archival record of the firefighters coming to terms with gravity of the events that have occurred and the grim determination with which they were dedicated the resolving it.There are criticisms and protests about this documentary having been released, but it must be understood that almost any footage of that day would be subject to controversy.  Too many people were affected by it and the wounds and emotions are still very raw.  The Naudets deserve much credit for how they handled the filming and the editing of this footage into the ""9/11"" documentary.  There were many chances to be exploitive and show far too much graphic footage of that attack.  Yet, the Naudets avoided doing so on each and every occasion.  Upon entering the North Tower, screams were heard to Jules right.  There were several people on fire, having been engulfed by the jet fuel that shot down the elevator shaft.  This footage was not edited out of the documentary because it was never filmed in the first place as Jules thought it would have been disrespectful to do so.  The sounds of the rest of that morning told the tale of the horrors that were not necessary capture on video.  Jules kept focused on the actions of the firefighters working feverishly to control the situation and begin rescuing people.  The loud, almost bomb-like crashes, happened with terrifying regularity and signaled another person who had chosen to die by their own hand and jump rather than let the fire get them.  Each time, the firefighters looked up and cringed, because they knew what it meant.  At no time, though were images of the people falling or the aftermath on the ground filmed.  Of course, there was no getting around the horror of the next image:  the firefighters frantically scrambling out of the lobby as the South Tower fell and made everything black as night.  The abject terror of that scene can scarcely be described.  In the aftermath of both towers collapsing, the documentary focused primarily on the rescue efforts and concerns about the safety of fellow firefighters.Thanks to the Naudet brothers, we now have a very accurate and respectful documentary of 9/11's 'day of infamy'.  Having a piece of history like this to view will allow people to never completely forget that day, while also allowing them to come to terms with it.",5,Faithful and respectful record of that horrible

As far as this video record goes, leave it to a couple of relatively obscure French brothers to produce quite possibly the most important American film made in our lifetime.  I saw other reviewers bitching about who made money off it, or how not enough carnage was shown.  But the true triumph of this extraordinary and moving documentary is that, in the years to come, people around the world will realize beyond doubt that the true heroes of this day were not a bunch of self-riteous fanatics sacrificing their lives to destroy thousands of others and humiliate a nation, but a handful of firefighters (among other crusaders) who sought to rescue whoever they could and preserve that nation's dignity.Like many others have stated, watching this DVD brought me back to that day, made me remember everything I did and felt that whole terrible week, just one year ago.  If you weren't in NYC dealing with it, the concensus seemed to be, this could happen anywhere.  As one fireman puts it in the video: ""I never realized how EVIL evil could be.""  As we know, in the minds of the losers who plotted this attack, something like that would be considered a triumph.  They knew what they were doing.  The firefighters portrayed here, on the other hand, had not so much a notion of what was going on as they were the only chance what few survivors of that ordeal had.Needless to say, the filmmakers themselves had less of an idea of what they were in for when they began their project in June of 2001, which is what pushes this story beyond just a ""what happened that day"" depiction.  It starts as an almost mundane (yet involving in its own way) chronicle of an idealistic NYFD ""probie"" anxious to move beyond polishing handrails and take on his first fire.  ""Be careful what you wish for,"" advises one chief.  In another memorable, chillingly foreshadowing moment, our rookie is reminded to keep his head together by any means - as the WTC looms dead center in the background.There are many powerful and almost surreal images that will stick with the viewer in this vision of a world turned inside out one ""normal morning"" in September (a chunk of plane engine that lands next to a ""Don't Litter"" sign, the crashing of falling bodies, the more ear-shattering sound of the South Tower falling followed by pitch black chaos, the surviving firemen returning to Ladder 1 hugging, vomiting, weeping), and I can't imagine anyone viewing it without feeling involved, plunged into the middle of it all.

And the person being filmed is Tony Benetatos. This is not a movie with actors playing people (even in real life), but these are real fire fighters. The brothers started filming in either June or July, and even though most of the summer was very slow of the brothers, Tony Benetatos and the rest of the fire fighters. Until September 11, when the brothers was filming the fire fighters that was on duty on September 11, working on a gas leak (near the World Trade Center), when a plane was heard roaring in the air, and the brothers got thier camreas really fast to view the plane crashing into the north tower. And starting filming the fire fighters in and around the World Trade Center. And after a while the south tower was hit, and about a hour after getting hit and on fire, the south tower fell to the ground, and about 30 minutes later the north tower (still on fire) fell to the ground. But it is also amazing that the brothers surived the whole thing and been able to finish the movie. Plus this a rare movie with no actors playing the people of 911 or anything else. Plus it is hard to beieve that the World Trade Center was ugly during the daytime and beautiful at nighttime. And you don't aways have to wait to catch this on tv, or wait until 9/11 each year to watch this (if you have bought this on video or dvd). Watching this, I am glad that I was not  in New York and by the World Trade Center on the morning of 9-11-01 or even when (both towers fell). Also good, is that it didn't talk  until 60 years to have a documety on the World Trade Center to come out.

Containing theonly footage of the first plane striking Tower 1 and then again theonly footage in the lobby of same as the Ladder company strive mightilyto fight the disaster and save lives. Interesting in that the filmmakerhad enough decency not to show people burning to death as he enteredthe lobby but turned the camera away or that, in spite of the noises ofbodies crashing to the ground just outside, he did not run out to get acloseup. And then Tower 2 collapses just outside. And then Tower 1collapses after the fireman have retreated up West Side Drive. Thefirehouse--which miraculously suffered no casualties---spends days atthe disaster site looking in vain for survivors but find instead onlypieces of varying size. And then it is weeks later and they have to tryand get on with their lives. Tony is no longer a probationary firemanand thinks about joining the military to kill the Muslim Barbariansbut, as of the making of the film , has elected to remain a fireman.The funerals---or rather the memorial services--- go on.And the United States is at war.Harrowing and depressing with amazing footage that is notusually seen, this is 9/11 told from the inside looking out as opposedfrom the newsrooms looking in.
