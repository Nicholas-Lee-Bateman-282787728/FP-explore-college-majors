Sure, they can throw in messages or make statements (for example, M*A*S*H), but the main point of a comedy is...comedy!  Humor!  But most of the time while watching ""The Office"", I'm not laughing: I'm thinking ""That's horrible"".Let me explain: the majority of this show consists of office manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell) saying and doing insensitive things to his office workers, followed by the workers' miserable reactions.  Is that supposed to be funny?  Example: Scott plans a company basketball game, and one of the older female co-workers offers to be a cheerleader.  Scott says something along the lines of ""That would be disgusting!"", then the camera pans over to show the woman looking hurt.The show does have some moments from time to time, but they don't involve the Michael Scott character, and in fact, I probably would like the show more if he weren't on it, because the other characters DO have some real humor to them.  It's a shame, because Steve Carell is funnier in other things (like ""Anchorman"", and, from what I've heard, ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin""), but his character kills this show for me.

The American copy makes no such assumption and that basic difference is key to the difference between original and imitation.  If you like quick humor and understated interplay then the BBC original is for you.  If, on the other hand, you grew up on American TV humor then the American version of The Office is reasonably amusing though, in the end, nothing more than yet another in a long line of programs that begin moderately well yet eventually conform to stereotype.Whereas the British version is excruciatingly realistic in its portrayal of banality, in the American version we can almost hear the ""ba-boom"" at the end of every carefully delivered gag.  There's even a predictable office romance story line that is played out without any leavening of irony.  If the BBC original is akin to a pungent authentic regional dish - perhaps black pudding with mushy peas - then the US version is hamburger.

173827,ABSX5TGEGRH76,1417070471,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[3, 3]","The Office almost didn't succeed.  It wasn't because it wasn't funny (it is), wasn't well-acted (it is), or due to poor reviews (critics loved it); people were too afraid that it would pale in comparison to the British series of the same name upon which this show is based.  Also, it is a very different style of comedy, which is a huge turn-off to people who are comfortable with the numerous (read: cookie cutter) sitcoms that flood the airwaves each year (Arrested Development fans know what I'm talking about).  Anyway, with only a 6 episode first season, things looked pretty grim.  Fortunately, the show was able to stay on the air long enough to win over a respectable fanbase, and now it looks like it will be here for a while.  But about that first season...The Office is an extremely innovated show; it is shot as a documentary, and the writers really outdid themselves to keep that whole motif going.  Characters recognize the existence of the camera, gesture to it, try to hide from it during embarassing moments, and there are ""confessional"" scenes where the characters speak to the camera one-on-one.  While we don't know why someone wanted to make a documentary about the inner workings of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, we're sure glad they did.Heading this branch of the Dunder Mifflin paper re-supplying company is Regional Manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell).  Michael is completely clueless in nearly every way possible.  He doesn't understand when he is being racist/sexist/homophobic, he can't seem to grasp that he isn't as hilarious as he thinks he is, and even though he feels his people skills are tremendous, he is a very lonely man.  Other series regulars include Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), a salesman who doesn't care that his career is going nowhere, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), a power-hungry sicophant who has even worse social skills than Michael, Ryan Howard (B.J. Novak), a temp who has recently started at the office, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), the bored and soft-spoken receptionist.  Jim has a secret crush on Pam, who is marrying a guy who works in the DM warehouse, though they have been engaged for 3 years, and there is still no set date for the wedding.  One of the main reasons Jim is still at Dunder Mifflin is to be near Pam.  Jim and Pam are good friends and partners-in-crime in a sense, as they constantly pull pranks on Dwight, who is as gullible as he is vindictive.  Dwight is a by-the-book salesman who does everything Michael tells him to do in hopes that he will one day assume power.  Michael doesn't really like Dwight, but he exploits Dwight's lust for power in order to use him for things that he himself would prefer not to do.  In addition to the characters credited in the opening credits, there is a large cast of secondary characters, many of whom are played by the show's writing staff.  Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), and Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) are the firm's accountants.  Other workers include Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), Meredith (Kate Flannery), Stanely Hudson (Leslie David Baker) Phyllis (Phyllis Smith), Toby (Paul Lieberstein), and Creed Bratton (playing a parody of himself).  Each character has their own unique and bizarre personality, adn they each contribute something to the show.A lot of the humor on the show is derived from the uncomfortable situations caused by Michael's ineptitude and awkwardness.  In addition to the hilariously terrible things that Michael says and does, the characters' reactions are priceless.  For example, in the episode ""Diversity Day"", Michael makes all of the workers address each other using racial stereotypes, and the way everyone complies is great.  Pam tends to get embarassed, Kevin comes up with random comments (""Maybe some spaghetti!""), and Jim often smirks at the camera.While I don't feel that The Office was the best comedy on television (Arrested Development, I miss you so much!  And Scrubs, so unerappreciated), but it is very close.  It is a show that must be seen to be believed.  Steve Carell is priceless as always, and the rest of the cast is great as well.

173830,AG0TA24LI0XV7,1417070471,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[1, 1]","I should say that I have not yet seen the British version on which this was based. I'd heard good things about this series with Steve Carell, so I rented it recently and enjoyed it. It's funny that there have probably been a bunch of sitcoms in the past with an office setting, but few really take off and succeed like this.I love the documentary aspect of the show, making the viewer feel like a fly on the wall from time to time. The characters are amusing if slightly cliche. The boss Michael is basically every obnoxious idiot you've met who is a complete social cripple and a dunderhead who keeps digging his own grave whenever he opens his mouth to speak before thinking. He is rude, stupid, and offensive, but he thinks he is witty, funny, and cool... and that people like him. Totally deluded. Carell is terrific in this role. Half the time he seems to be improvising. He makes you loathe Michael and yet almost feel pity for him. It must be a fun part to play, like a pompous villain who constantly blunders.My other favorite character, Dwight Shrute, reminds me of a mix between Daffy Duck and a school safety monitor... and a Trekkie. Dwight skulks, sneaks, and schemes. He is another clueless character. He thrives on any shred of power he can get, and does the most absurd things (even attempting to forbid the women from using their bathroom when it's discovered that someone wrote an insult about the boss on the wall).The series succeeds in several aspects (writing, acting, direction) even though the setting is claustrophobic and bleak... like many people's workplaces.I like sitcoms like this, without the studio laughter thundering behind it (that's part of the appeal of Arrested Development, Malcolm in the Middle, and The Simpsons).If I found one major flaw in ""The Office"", it was instantly recognizing the ""Will they or won't they"" potential romance between Pam and Jim. Hasn't that been done about two hundred times on a sitcom before? Yes, I guess I'm being picky. But a little of that goes a very long way: 'Poor Jim... he's so in love.' Hopefully they will get those two together rapidly or dissolve the attraction somehow. I prefer the dynamic between the boss and the staff.So, if you're undecided about this series, give it a try. It's fun. Every office should be this hilarious.",4,"Sometimes Deadpan, Often Scathingly Funny",1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,2311,"['should', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'British', 'version', 'was', 'based', ""'d"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'series', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'rented', 'recently', 'enjoyed', 'funny', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'bunch', 'sitcoms', 'past', 'office', 'setting', 'few', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'succeed', 'this.I', 'love', 'documentary', 'aspect', 'show', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'fly', 'wall', 'time', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'amusing', 'slightly', 'cliche', 'boss', 'Michael', 'basically', 'obnoxious', 'idiot', ""'ve"", 'met', 'who', 'complete', 'social', 'cripple', 'dunderhead', 'who', 'digging', 'own', 'grave', 'whenever', 'mouth', 'speak', 'thinking', 'rude', 'stupid', 'offensive', 'witty', 'funny', 'cool', 'people', 'Totally', 'deluded', 'Carell', 'terrific', 'role', 'time', 'be', 'improvising', 'loathe', 'Michael', 'yet', 'almost', 'feel', 'pity', 'must', 'be', 'fun', 'part', 'play', 'pompous', 'villain', 'who', 'constantly', 'other', 'favorite', 'character', 'Dwight', 'Shrute', 'mix', 'Daffy', 'Duck', 'school', 'safety', 'monitor', 'Trekkie', 'Dwight', 'skulks', 'sneaks', 'schemes', 'clueless', 'character', 'shred', 'power', 'can', 'get', 'most', 'absurd', 'things', 'even', 'attempting', 'forbid', 'women', 'using', 'bathroom', 'when', 'discovered', 'someone', 'wrote', 'insult', 'boss', 'wall', '.The', 'series', 'several', 'aspects', 'writing', 'acting', 'direction', 'even', 'setting', 'claustrophobic', 'bleak', 'many', 'people', 'workplaces.I', 'sitcoms', 'studio', 'laughter', 'thundering', 'part', 'appeal', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'Simpsons', '.If', 'found', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'Office', 'was', 'instantly', 'recognizing', 'Will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'potential', 'romance', 'Pam', 'Jim', 'Has', ""n't"", 'that', 'been', 'done', 'two', 'hundred', 'times', 'sitcom', 'Yes', 'guess', ""'m"", 'being', 'picky', 'little', 'very', 'long', 'way', ""'Poor"", 'Jim', 'so', 'love', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'get', 'two', 'together', 'rapidly', 'dissolve', 'attraction', 'somehow', 'prefer', 'dynamic', 'boss', 'staff.So', ""'re"", 'undecided', 'series', 'give', 'try', 'fun', 'Every', 'office', 'should', 'be', 'hilarious']",N/A

So, if you've become a fan of the show during the second or third season, you need to buy this DVD so you can see where it all began.The first season was only six episodes.  I guess NBC wasn't sure the show would succeed, being a remake of an extremely popular British show.  And at first the show wasn't successful.  Very few saw it and it seems like the only people that checked it out were fans of the British version and they didn't like it.  But slowly the show built momentum and now it is where it is today.The DVD contains deleted scenes and commentary (for four episodes I think).  There aren't many features but this is still a great buy.The pilot is almost a scene for scene remake of the British pilot I guess.

173835,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,1417070471,Bookphile,"[5, 5]","Any denizen of any corporate office in America will relate to the many funny and wince inducing moments in this series.  It does a masterful job of creating a generic version of pretty much any typical corporate office, large or small.  After spending many years in such an atmosphere, I often felt like someone must have been trailing me around at work and making note of the many absurd and scary moments of my typical office day.The character that really steals the series is Michael.  Though he's broadly drawn and says and does things that one would think would lead to an immediate firing, he is certainly representative of the bane of every corporate employees' existence: the clueless and oftentimes callous boss.  Steve Carrell is masterful in this role and does a great job of portraying a man who is so out of touch with how his employees think and feel about him that it's painful to watch at times.  Sadly, it seems that many a corporate boss is every bit as out of touch as Michael and that's what really makes the character speak to me.The romantic tension between Pam and Jim is also very enjoyable and also emblematic of your typical office atmosphere.  What corporate employee hasn't watched and gossiped about the romantic goings on of his or her coworkers?  The two have a very believable chemistry and the subtle little dances they do around one another seem very sincere.  Their dialog is very natural and funny, though it doesn't always produce positive results.The timeliness of this series is really remarkable.  I was especially struck by the recurring theme of downsizing rumors, particularly because I'm working for a corporation that will be doing a good deal of downsizing in the near future.  I could really relate with the Dunder Mifflin employees as they asked Michael to tell them whether or not they were going to be out of a job while he did his best to evade the question.  I thought it was the perfect characterization of the corporation versus the employee.  The bottom line is that the business is there to make money and that this often renders the employee dispensible.  These people have lives and families to support but they're not given a straight answer because the corporation is more interested in seeing who can impress them the most.  They are treated as little more than trained dogs.I also could very much relate to the episode in which the new health care plan selection takes place.  What company doesn't trumpet its benefits, even when they are as abysmal as the plans that Dwight wants to choose.  And what corporation hasn't tried to worm its way around confidentiality rules?  I vividly remember the day a former boss of mine tried to wiggle some confidential information out of me regarding which medications I'd been prescribed for a chronic condition from which I suffer.This is really a well done series and the six episodes on this disk only left me longing for more.

There's Jim, the funny, charming salesman who delights in moving Dwight's desk into the men's room or freezing his stapler in jello and his flirtations with Pam the receptionist who assists Jim in accelerating Dwight's paranoia by convincing him everyone in the office is forming alliances to get someone else fired.This is an excellent show.

A lot of people prefer the original and many cringed when this version was announced but me, as usual completely unbeknownest and missing the buzz, never watched either. But I have the lucky position of walking into this fresh and as it stands, I end up watching one of the more funnier shows on TV.Shot documentary-style, the show centers on the office workers of Dunder-Mifflin, a company that sells paper. The boss is Michael Scott, a well-meaning but seriously off man who wholeheartedly believes a terrible joke will get a huge laugh. His assistant is Dwight Shrute, a deadpan nerd who is just unaware of, practically everything and nothing at the same time almost. But the main fixtures tend to be Jim the salesman and Pam the receptionist.One of the most successful parts about this show is that each character adds something to the whole rather than just 2 to 3 great parts and everybody else is just kind of meh. Even characters who don't get a lot of leg room such as deadpan creepiness Kevin or the relatable real-world persona of Oscar. While this isn't a knock to the actor, but I rarely will laugh at Dwight since sometimes it's not really hilarious what he's saying but just at how gullible he is. And I wasn't a big fan of the character Kelly, the fast-talking girl who blabs on and on. While the actor nails that type of character, it's still an annoying persona to have.But arguably everyone's favorite aspect of the show is the should-be relationship between Jim and Pam. One thing that always bugged me in TV romances was it's almost like you have 2 attractive leads and that should be reason enough to get them together. But these 2 get along so well and know how to entertain the other that you wonder why they didn't hook up earlier (her fiance is Roy, an office worker in shipping who can say, with absolute serious ""toss the ball my way or you're sleeping in the car"" when she's the starter of a basketball game). In many ways they remind me of Mulder and Scully of the X-Files who originally started out as partners/friends who would do anything for the other and became lovers later.While it's got some flaws (it feels too short), it's still a case of a comedy show that doesn't need over-the-top comedic situations to get a laugh.",5,An incredibly funny sitcom,1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,2393,"['way', ""'m"", 'coming', 'American', 'version', 'Office', 'best', 'way', 'having', 'not', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'British', 'version', 'lot', 'people', 'prefer', 'original', 'many', 'cringed', 'when', 'version', 'was', 'announced', 'usual', 'completely', 'unbeknownest', 'missing', 'buzz', 'never', 'watched', 'either', 'have', 'lucky', 'position', 'walking', 'fresh', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'one', 'more', 'funnier', 'shows', 'TV.Shot', 'documentary-style', 'show', 'centers', 'office', 'workers', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'company', 'paper', 'boss', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'well-meaning', 'seriously', 'man', 'who', 'wholeheartedly', 'terrible', 'joke', 'will', 'get', 'huge', 'laugh', 'assistant', 'Dwight', 'Shrute', 'deadpan', 'nerd', 'who', 'just', 'unaware', 'practically', 'everything', 'nothing', 'same', 'time', 'almost', 'main', 'fixtures', 'tend', 'be', 'Jim', 'salesman', 'Pam', 'receptionist.One', 'most', 'successful', 'parts', 'show', 'character', 'something', 'whole', 'rather', 'just', '2', '3', 'great', 'parts', 'everybody', 'else', 'just', 'kind', 'meh', 'Even', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'leg', 'room', 'such', 'deadpan', 'creepiness', 'Kevin', 'relatable', 'real-world', 'persona', 'Oscar', ""n't"", 'knock', 'actor', 'rarely', 'will', 'laugh', 'Dwight', 'not', 'really', 'hilarious', 'what', 'saying', 'just', 'how', 'gullible', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'character', 'Kelly', 'fast-talking', 'girl', 'who', 'blabs', 'actor', 'type', 'character', 'still', 'annoying', 'persona', 'have.But', 'arguably', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'show', 'should-be', 'relationship', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'One', 'thing', 'always', 'bugged', 'TV', 'romances', 'was', 'almost', 'have', '2', 'attractive', 'leads', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'get', 'together', '2', 'get', 'so', 'well', 'know', 'how', 'entertain', 'other', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'hook', 'up', 'earlier', 'fiance', 'Roy', 'office', 'worker', 'shipping', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'absolute', 'serious', 'ball', 'way', ""'re"", 'sleeping', 'car', 'when', 'starter', 'basketball', 'game', 'many', 'ways', 'remind', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'X-Files', 'who', 'originally', 'started', 'out', 'partners/friends', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'became', 'lovers', 'got', 'flaws', 'too', 'short', 'still', 'case', 'comedy', 'show', ""n't"", 'need', 'over-the-top', 'comedic', 'situations', 'get', 'laugh']",N/A

Roseanne's take on Absolutely Fabulous never saw the light of day, John Larroquette's version of Fawlty Towers was dreadful and the more recent attempt to remake Coupling was an embarrassment. So, the U.S. makeover of the brilliant and hugely popular Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Britcom, The Office was met with a certain amount of jaded cynicism (and in some cases, outright hostility). There was no way that they would be able to capture the original show's blend of uncomfortable humour and spot-on observations of human behaviour in a soul-deadening 9-to-5 office environment.There was a glimmer of hope in that Gervais and Merchant had given the show their seal of approval and, more importantly, that Gervais' inept office manager's U.S. counterpart would be played by none other than Steve Carell, a memorable regular on The Daily Show and a scene-stealer in Bruce Almighty and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.Let's face it, if anyone has a chance of replicating the clueless insensitivity of David Brent it's Carell and he does a pretty good job of filling Gervais' shoes. Carell just has a naturally funny presence that makes what he does and say very entertaining. He isn't afraid to look stupid or in an unflattering light. He is fearless and willing to play his role to the hilt as evident in the ""Diversity Day"" episode when Michael recites a memorable Chris Rock routine to hilarious effect.The rest of the cast does a fine job with their respective roles but anyone who has seen the original would agree that none of them compare to their U.K. counterparts. However, as the season progresses, they seem to be breaking away from their archetypes and developing their own unique traits. It should be interesting to see what directions they take in the next season.There are deleted scenes for all six episodes that give some of the peripheral characters more screen time.There is an audio commentary for the ""Pilot"" episode by cast members Steve Carell, John Krasinski, Rainn Wilson and B.J. Novak. They all talk about how nervous they were going into this production, especially having to do a script reading in front of Gervais and Merchant.Also included is an additional commentary for the same episode, this time with Krasinski, Wilson, Novak, actress Jenna Fischer and executive producers Greg Daniels and Ken Kwapis. Fischer talks about how she was cast and the process. She was told to dress conservative and bore the casting director.There is an audio commentary for the ""Diversity Day"" episode with Carell, Krasinski, Wilson, Novak and Daniels.

173845,A2QWXHB5IU8LCU,1417070471,David W. George,"[7, 7]","The problem with ""The Office: Season One"" is not with the show itself. Steve Carell, who broke through big-time in 2005 with not only this series but his feature film ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", leads a fine ensemble cast in this documentary style comedy about the daily business practices of a Pennsylvania-based paper company. It's a witty, frequently funny, and sometimes painfully honest look at the way a boss treats his employees. No, the problem once again lies with the DVD's distributor, Universal. This is a brand new show, yet the episodes on the DVD seem to have a murky, bland appearance, unlike the episodes which are seen weekly on NBC. I complained about this problem with the ""Miami Vice: Season One"" DVD, but at least you can justify that somewhat because the episodes were from twenty years ago. Universal, what are you DOING? Please take the time and effort to put out a better DVD set. Of the extras available, there are a generous amount of deleted scenes from each of Season One's six episodes, but no bloopers, which is a disappointment.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Remaking movies is bad enough, but remaking TV shows is even worse -- when that happens, there's ninety-nine atrocious shows for one good one.But ""The Office"" is that one in a hundred that's good. Scratch that -- it's that one in a million that is AS GOOD as the Ricky Gervais series it sprang from, while still having its own unique flavour. ""The Office -  Season One"" brings us the too-short-yet sweet first season of this show, full of outrageous corporate disasters filmed in a mockumentary style. It's absolutely sidesplitting.The action takes place at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin (a paper corporation), presided over by Michael Scott (Steve Carell), a wannabe comic who claims to be a pal to all the people under him, despite driving them all up the wall. There's also the ""fascist nerd"" Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), bored everyman Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), and the beautiful secretary Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), whom Jim hopelessly longs for.Michael is ordered to do some downsizing, which he spends the whole season trying to avoid. In the meantime, Jim and Pam spend a great deal of time mocking the rigid Dwight, even starting an ""alliance"" with him, Survivor-style. And the Scranton employees are faced with a disastrous basketball game, Michael's version of a diversity seminar, a sexy purse salesgirl, and (most horribly) a Dwight-planned health care package. He is the lion. Run!Don't expect a typical sitcom in ""The Office."" No laughtracks. No punch lines. No gag humor... well, okay there's some. And few episodes have a clear-cut ending. Instead, we have the format seen in ""This is Spinal Tap"" and the Christopher Guest mockumentaries -- hidden cameras watching the madness. And what those cameras see is enough to make the world's cubicle-dwellers cry, because it's all so familiar... yet so twisted.The first season (which is rather short at only six episodes) is also heavily flavoured with the British series' humour, right down to the stapler-in-Jell-O joke. But most of the humor belongs to this show alone -- loads of pranks from Jim and Pam (""That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion""), horrendously awkward problems (Michael tries to be ""funny"" at an aging employee's birthday party) and intertwined storylines about office romance and conflict.But the best part is the dialogue -- deadpan, unspeakably funny dialogue, on any topic (""How do you know that they're fake?"" ""Leprosy? Flesh-eating bacteria? Hot dog fingers? Government created killer nano robot infection?"").Steve Carell has some big shoes to fill, but his earnestly manic, unconsciously offensive Michael Scott makes a brilliant boss that you would sell a kidney to avoid working under. Wilson is equally brilliant as the totally bizarre dork Dwight (""Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will""), while Krasinski and Fischer are quite likable as the mischievous everyman and his soul-mate (who is unhappily engaged to another man).More subtle and yet goofier than just about any other American sitcom, ""The Office"" translates British humour into a great post-mockumentary comedy. Funny, witty, and horrifyingly true to life, the first season is a short, sweet experience.",5,It was nice to meet some of you,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,3202,"['Remaking', 'movies', 'bad', 'enough', 'remaking', 'TV', 'shows', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'ninety-nine', 'atrocious', 'shows', 'one', 'good', 'one.But', 'Office', 'one', 'hundred', 'good', 'Scratch', 'one', 'million', 'AS', 'GOOD', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'series', 'still', 'having', 'own', 'unique', 'flavour', 'Office', 'Season', 'One', 'too-short-yet', 'sweet', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'full', 'outrageous', 'corporate', 'disasters', 'filmed', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'absolutely', 'sidesplitting.The', 'action', 'place', 'Scranton', 'branch', 'Dunder', 'Mifflin', 'paper', 'corporation', 'presided', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'wannabe', 'comic', 'who', 'be', 'pal', 'people', 'driving', 'up', 'wall', 'also', 'fascist', 'nerd', 'Dwight', 'Schrute', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'bored', 'everyman', 'Jim', 'Halpert', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'beautiful', 'secretary', 'Pam', 'Beesly', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'whom', 'Jim', 'hopelessly', 'for.Michael', 'ordered', 'do', 'downsizing', 'whole', 'season', 'trying', 'avoid', 'meantime', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'mocking', 'rigid', 'Dwight', 'even', 'starting', 'alliance', 'Survivor-style', 'Scranton', 'employees', 'are', 'faced', 'disastrous', 'basketball', 'game', 'Michael', 'version', 'diversity', 'seminar', 'sexy', 'purse', 'salesgirl', 'most', 'horribly', 'Dwight-planned', 'health', 'care', 'package', 'lion', 'Run', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'Office', 'laughtracks', 'punch', 'lines', 'gag', 'humor', 'well', 'few', 'episodes', 'have', 'clear-cut', 'ending', 'Instead', 'have', 'format', 'seen', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'watching', 'madness', 'what', 'cameras', 'see', 'enough', 'make', 'world', 'cubicle-dwellers', 'cry', 'so', 'familiar', 'yet', 'twisted.The', 'first', 'season', 'rather', 'short', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'also', 'heavily', 'flavoured', 'British', 'series', 'humour', 'right', 'down', 'stapler-in-Jell-O', 'joke', 'most', 'humor', 'show', 'alone', 'loads', 'pranks', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'spontaneous', 'dental', 'hydroplosion', 'horrendously', 'awkward', 'problems', 'Michael', 'be', 'funny', 'aging', 'employee', 'birthday', 'party', 'intertwined', 'storylines', 'office', 'romance', 'conflict.But', 'best', 'part', 'dialogue', 'deadpan', 'unspeakably', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'topic', 'How', 'do', 'know', ""'re"", 'fake', 'Leprosy', 'Flesh-eating', 'bacteria', 'Hot', 'dog', 'fingers', 'Government', 'created', 'killer', 'nano', 'robot', 'infection', '.Steve', 'Carell', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'earnestly', 'manic', 'unconsciously', 'offensive', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'brilliant', 'boss', 'would', 'sell', 'kidney', 'avoid', 'working', 'Wilson', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'totally', 'bizarre', 'dork', 'Dwight', 'concentration', 'can', 'raise', 'lower', 'cholesterol', 'will', 'Krasinski', 'Fischer', 'are', 'quite', 'likable', 'mischievous', 'everyman', 'soul-mate', 'who', 'unhappily', 'engaged', 'man', '.More', 'subtle', 'yet', 'goofier', 'just', 'other', 'American', 'sitcom', 'Office', 'British', 'humour', 'great', 'post-mockumentary', 'comedy', 'Funny', 'witty', 'horrifyingly', 'true', 'life', 'first', 'season', 'short', 'sweet', 'experience']",N/A

The pilot does have its moments however, and sets up the show perfectly.  Steve Carell is maybe  a bit too over the top as Michael in this first episode, but even he manages to tone it down a bit after a few episodes.  Part of my enjoyment of these episodes stems from knowing who the characters are now, so I no longer see Jenna Fischer or John Krasinksi as pale imitations of Lucy Davis and Martin Freeman.  It's also fun to see how each secondary character was introduced.  Angela wasn't much different, but Kelly in her first appearance in ""Diversity Day"" hasn't become the office ditz she becomes.There are some good deleted scenes here, which is nice as this was only a six episode season and could very well have been a bare bones release.

Honestly, it isn't a matter of being ""as good as.""  The characters are slightly, yet significantly different.  Yes, they are each desperately needy and self-centered.  Gervais brings to his character more manipulation and an uncurrent of unpleasantness which almost makes the viewer squirm.  Carell's character is sweeter, less sleazy while still being completely inappropriate.  Each is a dimwit, yet Gervais brings an occasional flavor of intelligentsia to his character with references to culture and literature that totally escape Carell's character.  Each character is excellently represented by the actor, share similarities yet are not intended to be clones.  This, by the way, is true of the other characters as well, yet less blatantly depicted.Just FYI so you may judge if my opinion is worth squat to you...I hate most TV.

Despite Carrell's talents, the remake falls flat and is not very funny. The pacing is uneven and the show often appears boring and trite, with Carrell's character lacking the likeability and wit of the original. When compared to the BBC version, and comparisions are inevitable, I feel disappointed and a little angry. Carrell was brilliant creating his own characters on The Daily Show, Anchorman and Virgin, but his performance fails to generate the excitement and originality of Ricky Gervais' character. Gervais put so much of himself into the show that he made it his own and any performer, no matter how talented, can not match that originality. Carrell's original work is brilliant and he's got to be kicking himself for next taking on the remake of another classic role as Maxwell Smart when he'll face even more unflattering comparisons.

I've tuned in to a couple but they were either too silly and unrealistic or just the same ol' thing you can find elsewhere.Also, it is rare to find a comedy (or even a show for that matter) that my wife and I both actually enjoy.  Again, this hasn't happened since Friends and Seinfield left us.However, this show caught our attention the first time we watched it.  We laughed at this show not only because of the humor but because it reminded us so much (too much?) of our daily experiences at our own offices and past experiences.  After all, haven't we all had to work for a Michael Scott or had a Dwight Schrute as a co-worker?  Haven't we all been forced to attend mindless and misguided meetings?Not only was the show funny, but the characters are fantastic!!  They are fantastic because every single character reminds us of somebody.  My wife and I will often say, ""Oh, such-a-such a person is just like [blank].""  Oh, it's great!!!  Now, I've gone on to watch seasons two and three so these six episodes are nothing more than an introduction to the characters.  In the seasons to come we come to understand them and even come to love them in their own way (yes, even Michael, Dwight, and Angela).  Season one was little more than an introduction to these characters.The most colorful is Michael Scott, played by Steve Carell.  I don't know if he was a house-hold name before this show but this show seems to have vaulted him into the public eye as he has done Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty, and some other movies coming up (like Dan in Real Life and Get Smart).  Michael Scott is an interesting person.  He is a terrible boss under the delusion that he is the world's greatest boss.  Nothing shows this better than the cup on his desk that says, ""World's Best Boss.""  Not only does he show you this boss but that he points out that he bought the cup himself.The other fun character is Dwight Schrute, masterfully played by Rainn Wilson (who has also gone on to do a few movies).  Dwight is the coworker that nobody wants to work with.  He is stubborn, obnoxious, and just plain weird.  He doesn't hide the fact that he loves his job but hates everybody there.  The classic line from him is, ""Downsizing?  Oh, I'm all for downsizing.  In fact, I brought it up in my interview when I was hired.""There is a bit of a love triangle formed as well.  It doesn't take long to realize that the lovable Jim Halpert (John Krasinksi) has a crush on just-as-lovable Pam (Jenna Fischer) who obviously would be the world's most perfect couple except for one thing... Pam is engaged to Roy (David Denman).  But some hints are dropped by Pam that things may not be the best between Pam and Roy because they've been engaged for six years.Jim is also a fantastic character.  He is the office practical joker who takes most of his antics on Dwight.  Some of the best moments are not only Jim's jokes but Dwight's reactions to them.Those are probably the four most important characters but all of them are great.  You have self-righteous Angela, Ryan the temp, perverted Kevin, office-slut and alcoholic Meredith, talkative and cheerleader Kelly, stickler for the rules Toby, and matronly Phyllis.  Just looking over those descriptions, can't you relate each character to somebody you know?This is a show I hope stays on for a long time.  It is so much fun to watch over and over again.

173870,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,1417070471,James Hiller,"[16, 17]","Ricky Gervais' ""The Office"" is one of my favorite television series. Nothing beats the deadpan British humor offered in the original series; extremely funny and brilliant writing. When NBC picked up the show, I grimaced, thinking back to horrible mistakes such as Coupling. But, thanks to a quick DVD release, Entertainment Weekly's glowing review, and Steve Carrell's hilarious turn in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", I gave it a shot, and found myself laughing hysterically.Steve Carell plays Michael Scott, boss extrodinaire of ""The Office"". He is clueless, brainless, sexist, homophobic, racist, all under a disguise of political correctedness that has gone astray. He prides himself the office comedian, but fails to understand that his role as boss should supercede this role; therein lies the genus of the comedy. Carell does an admirable job in the Gervais role, and probably is the only actor that would be daring enough to step in those big shoes, and clomp around the office in them just as funnily. He doesn't attempt to impersonate Gervais, but makes Scott his own.The other office mates, from Jenna Fischer's charming Pam, the office secretary, to Rainn Wilson's role as Dwight Shrute (a name that deserves to be said aloud), all turn in great performances to accompany Carrell. The interaction between Shrute and office stud Jim (played by John Krasinski) is a gold mine of comedy, the two actors play off each other brilliant, and unlike the precessor, Shrute is occasionally allowed to win, even though he's the office buffoon.This comedy is quite, yet rich. If you've ever had a boss in your career that is clueless, and you wonder how on earth that person ever got to where they were (who hasn't?), you can relate to the hijinx and comedy of NBC's ""The Office"".

We meet his employees -- overeager salesman Dwight (Rainn Wilson), whose main missions in life includes kissing up to Michael; and his deskmate Jim (John Krasinski), who does his best to get by with a minimal amount of effort while on the job. There's also Toby, the quiet, long-suffering HR rep; prim and proper Angela; patient Oscar; long-term temp Ryan; the often childlike Kevin; Meredith, who's a little open about her fondness for men and booze; Creed, whose past as a musician with the Grass Roots (the actor's real backstory) is a tad questionable; talkative Kelly; and Pam (Jenna Fischer), the quiet, artistic receptionist who often holds the entire office together.Particular hilarious Season 1 episodes include ""Diversity Day,"" where Michael decides to hold his own workshop for the staff and - naturally - ends up unwittingly insulting just about everyone; and ""Health Care,"" where the staff are asked - supposedly to ""justify"" their need for health care coverage - to list their medical needs. Led by Jim and Pam, everyone decides to make up ridiculous fictitious ailments instead.While this season is really too short to do much except establish the general premise and provide viewers with basic introductions to some of the main characters (many of the others, such as Oscar and Kelly, don't really factor in until Season 2), this box set is still worth the money.

The basic idea is that it's a ""documentary"" focusing on the Scranton office of Dunder-Mifflin Inc., a paper company.  It revolves around the manager, Michael Scott (played by Steve Carell), and his ignorant insensitivities.There are so many different ways this show is funny.  Actually, I don't find Steve Carell as the funniest part of this show.  The supporting cast is excellent and some of the funniest moments come from the receptionist Pam and salesman Jim conspiring against the absolutely hysterical Dwight Schrute.The first season provides a good solid base for the second season by introducing the characters and providing its own funny moments.Also the cast members uncredited in the opening do a great job.  They may be relegated to work as extras w/ few lines, but their responses to Michael's lame jokes and misguided efforts cracked me up just as much as any of the main cast did.  The humor tends to lean a little to the dry side sometimes, but if you can appreciate Arrested Development then The Office shouldn't be too difficult at all.The show isn't only about the comedy of the characters.  It also adds depth by showing some of the nuances of Jim and Pam's relationship.  And a deeper sense of what Michael's all about (which become more fleshed out in season 2).My only possible qualm with the first season would be that it tends to rely heavily on racist humor (and stereotypes) and might offend some, but if you don't take yourself too seriously it can still be genuinely funny due to the clever use of certain situations.

And I'm happy to say that the American version of the show is indeed a lot of fun.  The new show smartly carries over the big selling points of the British original, namely the clueless boss, the ridiculous office situations, and those long pregnant pauses and awkward silences when a character can't believe what another character (usually the boss) has just said or done.  But, also smartly, the writers and actors are also permitted to tweak and adapt the original British characters so that the new characters aren't just carbon copies of the original ones, only without British accents.  So, for example, Steve Carell is still a clueless boss, but a different kind of clueless boss than Ricky Gervais' David Brent character.  Carell, like the other new actors here, get to play to their individual strengths to create new, interesting, fun characters.This first season set is a painless, inexpensive way to see if this new version of ""The Office"" is for you.  You get a small handful of episodes (the first season was a short one) for a dirt-cheap price.  Be warned, though... you'll likely want to quickly pick up the second season-- the first full-length season-- shortly thereafter, and that costs a little more.Oh yeah... in this first-season set, don't judge everything by the pilot episode.  The pilot is perfectly watchable and has a few chuckles, but things don't really pick up until the second episode.  So do yourself a favor and watch the first two episodes during your first sitting.  That'll put you exactly where you need to be to savor the rest of the quick, fun ride that is season one of ""The Office"".",4,"Fun stuff, and not by any means a lazy knock-off of the original series",1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,1743,"['really', 'really', 'liked', 'British', 'version', 'Office', 'was', 'open', 'enjoying', 'American', 'take', 'concept', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'American', 'version', 'show', 'indeed', 'lot', 'fun', 'new', 'show', 'smartly', 'big', 'selling', 'points', 'British', 'original', 'namely', 'clueless', 'boss', 'ridiculous', 'office', 'situations', 'long', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'awkward', 'silences', 'when', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'character', 'usually', 'boss', 'just', 'said', 'done', 'also', 'smartly', 'writers', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'permitted', 'tweak', 'adapt', 'original', 'British', 'characters', 'so', 'new', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'carbon', 'copies', 'original', 'ones', 'only', 'British', 'accents', 'So', 'example', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'still', 'clueless', 'boss', 'different', 'kind', 'clueless', 'boss', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'David', 'Brent', 'character', 'Carell', 'other', 'new', 'actors', 'here', 'get', 'play', 'individual', 'strengths', 'create', 'new', 'interesting', 'fun', 'characters.This', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'painless', 'inexpensive', 'way', 'see', 'new', 'version', 'Office', 'get', 'small', 'handful', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'short', 'one', 'dirt-cheap', 'price', 'Be', 'warned', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'want', 'quickly', 'pick', 'up', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'full-length', 'season', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'little', 'more.Oh', 'yeah', 'first-season', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'everything', 'pilot', 'episode', 'pilot', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'few', 'chuckles', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'second', 'episode', 'So', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'first', 'sitting', ""'ll"", 'put', 'exactly', 'where', 'need', 'be', 'savor', 'rest', 'quick', 'fun', 'ride', 'season', 'one', 'Office']",N/A

When NBC started promoting an American version of The Office, I cringed.  It seemed flat and unfunny, and I initially refused to watch. I caught a few minutes one week, and I've been hooked since.  It is, surpisingly, quite good.  I didn't want to like the show, but found myself drawn in, much in the same way that I was with the original.Steve Carell is funny, although he does pale in comparison to Ricky Gervais.  He seems like he is trying a little too hard to play the character, and it takes him a few episodes before he seems comfortable in the role.  John Krasinski is not Martin Freeman either, but his ""Jim"" character is quite charming in his own way.  I was a little surprised at his casting at first because I thought he was too much of a ""Ken doll"" to play the Tim/Jim role, but after a few episodes, he grew on me.One of the best things about The Office is that it is a comedy that is actually funny (there are very few on American television, so it's a most welcome addition).  The writing is sharp, witty, and well done.  It does not condescend to it's audience by blasting it with an annoying laugh track.Although it is difficult not to compare the two shows to each other, if you watch NBC's The Office and judge it on it's own merits, the show is entertaining and worth watching.  I'm glad I gave the show another chance.  It isn't necessary to choose between the BBC and American versions of the show.

The wry sense of humor and the intelligent wit has always held far greater appeal to me than the cheap/obvious laughs that many American sitcoms tend to go for.  Sadly, many copies (or attempted copies) of British comedies have been overadapted for the American audience (Coupling is a perfect example) and the result is a weak translation that loses all or most of what made the series so funny/original in the UK.Fortunately, this version of the original UK show is absolutely hilarious, perhaps because the producers are tied closely and stay faithful to the original version.  There was no dumbing down of the comedy - the irony, the facial expressions, the unbelievable audacity of the characters - for the sake of easier/louder laughs.  The fact that there is no studio audience here makes it even funnier - the viewers are left to laugh on their own, without canned tracks or cues from a studio audience.While there are certainly things that would cause you to think ""There's no way a manager would say/do/get away with anywhere near that bad of behavior"" I can say that in 6+ years in leadership development that I've seen all this and more.. and we all know that one person who just has absolutely no clue how little others think of him/her.This is truly brilliant comedy, but subtle and atypical when compared to other sitcoms on TV (with the exception of Seinfeld reruns and Scrubs).

It is a verbatim copy of the English version; however, after a shaky second episode, it takes off in its own direction and begins shaping the characters differently to what we saw from the UK.Standing out as particularly good in this show is Rainn Wilson, who plays Dwight Schrute - the equivalent of 'Gareth' from the original. In many ways this character is much more entertaining than the ""weasel-faced"" Gareth, and he comes up with some hilarious lines. One notable line is where he is describing his attraction to a woman by listing her positive features. Among them he lists ""large breasts... the Schrutes are very thirsty babies.""Steve Carell plays a much more obnoxious and intentionally cruel character than Ricky Gervais's David Brent. His 'Michael Scott' is more clued in than Brent and seems to actually get work done. You also get the feeling he sometimes intentionally hurts people, whereas Brent always carried himself with a childish innocence and ambivalence to all around him. So on that score, Carell's performance distinguishes itself from that of Gervais. In terms of entertainment, he's not quite as funny or effective as David Brent, but all the same Michael Scott is a funny creation, if not more offensive than Brent in terms of sheer obnoxiousness.The last four episodes (3-6) are worth the purchase of this DVD, especially episode 5, which is about a basketball game between the office staff and the warehouse staff.

Working in a pretty playful place I had even heard some of the lines shouted out in glee sometimes (""That's what she said!"").  Eventually I caught some re-runs on tv and couldn't stop laughing.  Intrigued, I went out and got the first season.For those who aren't familiar with the show it is made in the style of a documentary with a camera following around people in the office to see what they do all day.  The characters acknowledge that the camera is there most times, but usually get on with their day of selling paper for Dunder-Mifflin and playing pranks on each other.  Michael Scott, the boss, is a odd guy with an even odder sense of humor whose quirks and jokes are usually offensive but in which he doesn't mean to be.  The other characters come in to the job and do the day to day work but they often spend a good portion of their day on gossip and personal pursuits.CHARACTERS:Steve Carell-Michael ScottRainn Wilson-Dwight SchruteJohn Krasinski-Jim HalpertJenna Fischer-Pam HalpertB.J. Novak-Ryan HowardLeslie David Baker-Stanley HudsonBrian Baumgartner-Kevin MaloneKate Flannery- Meredith PalmerAngela Kinsey-Angela MartinOscar Nunez-Oscar MartinezPhyllis Smith-Phyllis Lapin-VanceMindy Kaling-Kelly KapoorPaul Lieberstein-Toby FlendersonCreed Bratton-Creed BrattonCraig Robinson-Darryl PhilbinMelora Hardin-Jan LevensonThere are other characters, but these are the main ones.There are actually only 6 episodes in this season (which really surprised me but then again I didn't read the box).The Pilot episode is an introduction of sorts.  We see some of what will become our favorite characters and learn a little bit about them through their reaction to the rumour of downsizing.Diversity Day is just how it sounds.  After a skit that Michael performed and offended everyone, a diversity speaker is brought in to talk to everyone.  Jim is easily distracted from the task at hand though by the potential for a big sale.Health Care is about when Michael needs to choose a new plan for the office.  He instead puts Dwight in charge of it and panic ensues when Dwight slashes everything.The Alliance:  In this episode Dwight tries to form a partnership with Jim in order to ""save"" themselves from downsizing.  Jim of course thinks its a great way to joke with Dwight and plays some wonderful pranks.In Basketball, Michael decides to have the office team compete against the warehouse workers in an impromptu game.  Some people take a little more serious than others though and the game becomes more than just fun.The last episode, Hot Girl, has a good portion of the male office workers trying to impress a purse saleslady who Michael has let use the conference room.  They of course make good fools of themselves and provide a lot of comedy.The whole series is funny, but this one actually took some getting used to for me.  There were a couple moments that I had to suspend reality because I couldn't figure out how Michael wasn't fired and why he was so mean to Pam.  Its a lot different to me in the later seasons and it seems that they toned it down a bit later on, or at the very least, changed the humor a bit.  And the humor could potentially offend people.  Although its good nature, it does explore humor about race, sex, etc. and if you dislike this type of humor, this is not the show for you.All the characters are well played and its nice to see that most of them are still there in the later seasons along with a few new faces.  I really like Dwight despite his weirdness and the interaction between him and Jim is hilarious and one of my favorite parts of the show.  Pam is also a nice character although sometimes I feel like smacking her for staying with her boyfriend throughout the episodes, but I'm sure we're supposed to feel that way.While I would have liked to see more episodes this is a pretty good collection showcasing the start of this popular series.  Although it was hard to get used to the outrageous humor and I didn't enjoy it quite as much as some of the later seasons, it is still a very good comedy show.Review by M.

It would break my heart to have to admit that I paid good money for this mindless dribble. This is supposed to be a comedy.  A comedy is supposed to contain some degree of humor. Unfortunately, stupidity is a poor fall back for genuine humor and this program is full of stupidity. There is no ""flow"" to the dialogue.  There are so many pauses in the conversations, it seems like the script writers are actually on the side lines, trying to think of something for the actors to say. I have worked in many office situations.  I have been at the bottom of the food chain and I have been at the top.  I can assure you that, yes, there are some humorous incidents which occur in offices, but I have never seen an office where there is gut busting, side splitting humor 24/7.I guess the writers and producers tried to make this just such an office and in doing so they failed.I note that other reviews (even some of the good ones) make note of the poor impression the ""pilot"" leaves. I like to be entertained (especially if I am going to pay for it)and I note that others have said that the program became ""better"" as it went on.  One person commented that out of a whole season, they found one episode which they really liked.  But I guess, I will never find out if it would be the same for me. Even if the pilot episode left me with the impression that there was the potential for the show to improve, I may have considered purchasing another couple of episodes to see what direction the show took.

Sounds pretty stupid, right?  Then you get my meaning.  The Office is hilarious.  Does Steve Carell overdo it or go over the top at times, absolutely...but I think that's part of who his character is.Anyway, I'd never seen this show until today.  Before that, I'd totally written the show off because I assumed that Steve Carell would be rehashing his 40 Year Old Virgin routine (I know, I know...it's sounds lame, but a lot of stars do it, so I thought he'd do the same thing).  Let me tell those out there that were in the same boat as me, it's so not true.  I happened to be at my parents house and saw a copy of season one sitting in my sister's bedroom.  I was curious, I popped it into my DVD player and, well, I've been laughing ever since.  As a matter of fact, I'm laughing as I type this.Those that think the show is centered around Carell are totally wrong.  Some of the funniest aspects of the show revolve around other people.  Whether it's the ongoing office war between Jim (John Krasinski) and Dwight(Rainn Wilson), Jim's attempts to win over the engaged Pam (Jenna Fischer) despite constantly being shot down, the temp (B.J. Novak) getting...well...the temp treatment, or Michael's (Carell) abuse of power and his oblivious/insensitive behavior toward his underlings, it's all sure to have your sides splitting when you see it for the first time.

The boss of the series, Michael Scott (Steve Carrel) is not someone you want to hang out with- he thinks he's funny and ""all that"" when really he is annoying, and often insulting . But he tries too hard and it usually ends up with comical consequences. Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is the ""Assistant to the Regional Manager"", he's basically a nerd and thinks of himself as Michael's right-hand man and 2nd-in-command of the place. But he ends up as the [...] of the jokes and is the subject of much teasing from Jim and Pam (John Krasinski, Jenna Fisher). They work in the office as well, and are good friends but Jim has deeper feelings for Pam even though she is engaged to Roy, a jerk who works in the warehouse. Ryan (B.J. Novak) is the new temp who works in the building, and he is a quiet, soft-spoken guy but Michael tends to showoff to him more then anyone else, much to his displeasure.The cameras are actually supposed to be there, filming all that goes on, most often characters will glance at the camera and there are ""confessions"" where they talk to the camera in a private room, discussing thing that are going on. The supporting characters add to the comedy, especially Kevin, who is my favorite. No laugh track, no background music, it's realistic. This is the only show currently on that makes me laugh out loud everytime.The commentaries are very interesting, you learn so many little secrets.

I had heard all of the hype but never had really watched more than a passing episode. So I started watching it with some regularity earlier in the year, basically watching the second half of season 3. I admit that I did start getting into the show, not really finding it that hilarious but more so just becoming engaged with the characters. A few weeks ago I finally got the DVDs of the UK version to see what that was all about. I must say after watching the entire 2 seasons of the UK along with the specials that kind of wrap it up, wow. The US version really pales in comparison. If you have seen the UK version and you see the pilot of the US version it really is lame. The pilot is basically an amalgamation of scenes of the UK version. Some of it is almost verbatim. I agree with one of the people here that said the US version does better when it starts getting it's own voice. The David Brent character is a much more complex character that you invest so much more interest in than the Michael Scott character. If this was a stand alone show and not an adaptation of another show I would say it's a well done show (and it is). It's just after you see the British version and go back to the US version it just really pales. I guess you have to erase that from memory but it is difficult. The UK version also comes across as so much more ""real"". The US version doesn't really have so much of a documentary feel (a lot of shows now are filmed the same way with shaky handheld camera work) and you get more a feeling you are watching actors interacting and not real people like you do in the UK version.

173922,A16QODENBJVUI1,1417070471,Robert Moore,"[322, 384]","Like most other fans of the great BBC series THE OFFICE, I was absolutely horrified when they announced that they were doing an American version of the show.  Ricky Gervais's show was so perfect, so unique that it didn't seem possible for it to be successfully translated into an American context.  Also, the show was unimaginable without Ricky Gervais, who was both the creator and lead performer of the original.  And to be honest, when the American show straightforwardly imitates the original, especially in the first episode, it compares rather badly.  The jokes were tailored perfectly to Gervais and his cohorts, and they just didn't translate all that well to the new set of actors.  However, once you get past the first episode, and the American crew produces original material, it actually becomes a very, very funny show.  In fact, if you have seen the BBC version, I would recommend just skipping the first episode of the American version and going on from there.  My other complaint with the imitation is that they straightforwardly stole the British theme song, though they did pep it up a lot.If you haven't seen the American version but have seen the BBC original, the first question is almost certainly going to be:  how can they possibly do the show without Ricky Gervais in the lead?  Does Steve Carell manage to make us forget Ricky?  Well, not quite.  There is absolutely no question that Ricky Gervais's David Brent is better than Steve Carell's Michael Scott.  It isn't just that Gervais has a degree of ease with the role that Carell barely lacks:  David Brent is a more complex character.  While it is certainly true that Brent was a complete ass, he was also a lovable ass; we cared about him, and despite all of his blithe self-ignorance he is someone for whom we are on some level rooting.  But Michael Scott, while incredibly funny, is essentially a lost cause.  He is too complete an idiot to have any hope of redemption, and he is also fairly unlikable.  Irredeemably unlikable.  We laugh at Michael Scott, but we laugh with David Brent.  That is the bad news.  The good news is that while Carell's character is not as likable as Gervais's, he is possibly about 90% as funny, which means that the American show is quite unexpectedly a very funny show.Once the show gets into original material, it is actually quite good.  The second episode deals with diversity training (i.e., racial sensitivity training), with Michael Scott attempting to take over the training by injecting such stupid sensitivity questions as, ""Name another race to which you are attracted to sexually.""  The irony is that the only reason the training was instituted because of racially charged jokes Michael had told, but he remains blissfully ignorant of the fact that he was the one being targeted.  Another great episode is the one where Michael and the white-collar workers play the warehouse workers in a game of basketball.  Michael ignores the overweight white guy (who later turns out to be a dead shot) and the Hispanic guy (who is also a dead shot) in favor of the office African-American, who turns out to be a simply horrendous player.I have to add that those who are giving this one star are clearly fans of the original who have never bothered to watch the American version.

I'm glad I did...the second episode showed more promise, and by the 6th episode, everyone was hitting full stride. Along the way, there were several moments that were faithfully reminiscent of the uncomfortable (but hilarious) vibe of the UK version. Steve Carell's character might not be David Brent, but that's a good thing...it'd be pointless trying to do a carbon-copy of the immortal Brent, so it's refreshing that Carell puts his own stamp on the lead character (the obnoxious Michael Scott).In addition to the first six episodes, there's nearly an hour's worth of deleted scenes, mostly on par with the material that made the final cut.

A lot of the time, though, these people miss the point: if it were exactly like the Brit show, this ""Office"" would be worthy of such derision.However, there's enough to like about ""The Office"" to build up a small but devoted fan base (much like the critical darling ""Arrested Development"" on Fox). For one thing, Steve Carell might not be Ricky Gervais, but he shouldn't have to be: Michael Scott is the perfect ""boss who doesn't get it"", a corporate boob who is despised on both sides of the power structure (those below him and above him in stature). The supporting cast makes the show, however: the Jim and Pam romantic angle is the heart of the show, while Dwight's paranoia gets the better of him on almost every episode. Ryan the intern is more of a background character than his prominent place in the credits may suggest, but B.J. Novak happens to be a writer on the show. I guess he could write himself into it as much (or as little) as he desires.If it were just that, the show might fail. But the whole atmosphere of workplace mundane nature is pitch perfect. The documentary feel (a condition that is both acknowledged and unknown at times) gets you on the floor with Dunder-Mifflin as Michael and his cohorts awkwardly make their way through the day. Jim lusts after Pam, but does little in the way of getting her away from Roy. Dwight tries to assert an authority he doesn't have. The various characters in the office have their own personalities, which come out to great comedic effect over the course of the season.All in all, ""The Office"" Version USA is more than okay.

When they make a sequel to a great movie, invariably it pales in comparison and is a second rate work (there are a few exceptions).  With TV the reverse is often true.  In the first season or two of most TV shows you can see the writers and producers feeling out the characters and seeing what works and what doesn't.  This is especially true here in the first season of the office.  While the episodes Health Care and the Alliance are great, the other episodes fall flat as we are left wondering what to make of the consistently clueless Michael Scott, the tireless sycophant Dwight K Schrute, the relentlessly aloof Jim Halpert and the rest of the staff.You do not need to see this season to enjoy the others, but it does lay a nice groundwork for the coming episodes.

He's that good. Michael, the character he plays is the boss of a paper supply company where a tv crew has been taping. You can tell immediately his employees pretty much can't stand him. He is an arrogant, sexist, awful excuse for a boss- but he think's the complete opposite. He tells the cameras that he thinks everyone there loves and admires and respects him. It's too damn funny cause you really believe he believes it.Again, it all comes down to the flawless acting. And not just him, but everyone in the office is very natural at what they do-if they didn't it wouldn't be believable. It's very seamless and a joy to watch everything go down. You almost DON'T want to keep watching because it seems to pathetic and sad to watch a character like Michael do the things he does. But it is very addictive.It's a comedy unlike any other. Those other shows rely on stupid gags and dumb jokes that are not even remotely funny. The Office relies purely on acting ability and flawless execution.

173947,AP3B615GM191G,1417070471,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","For the past few years, I considered the TV series ""Family Guy"" to be the funniest show on the tube for its ability to poke fun at anything and everything.  Yet, more than likely due to the rather sick mind of creator Seth McFarlane, that show tends to beat you over the head (sometimes again and again and again) with its jokes in rather crude fashion.  It can be hilarious, don't get me wrong, but a show like that can only stay fresh for so long without having to up the ""shock ante"" with every episode.Just recently, though, I discovered ""The Office"" while utilizing a free trial of Netflix and was blown away by the subtleness of the humor that abounds in each and every episode.  I had watched bits and pieces of certain episodes in the past, but beginning to watch them in broadcast order really helped me put the pieces together and enjoy every second of each 20-minute episode.Basically, the show is set at the Dunder-Mifflin paper company in Scranton, PA, where a very diverse group of office workers work the 9-5 cubicle life under the ""direction"" of Michael Scott (played by Steve Carell).  It's very much like a toned-down, more realistically-funny version of the feature film ""Office Space"".  But here's the catch: Michael is, by and large, a complete idiot, and thus the office functions accordingly.In this first season (only six episodes long, likely due to its ""trial run"" status in the U.S. to see if it could duplicate the success of its United Kingdom namesake show), all the building blocks of the show are put in place in terms of character development, relationships, and humor.  Really, there are three reasons why the show (right from this very first season) resonated so much with American audiences:First, is the notion that all the characters are so relatable to potential real-life situations.  Everyone can relate to the idiot boss (Michael), the office suck-up (Dwight), the ""normal"" or ""cool"" ones (Jim and Pam), the pervert (Kevin) and the tightly-wound frosty woman (Angela), to name just a few.  While those characters are of course amped up a bit from what a real office feels like, there still exists that sense that you yourself could just as easily be in the same situation they are.Another reason this show is so successful is the focus on the characters of Jim and Pam.  Both are acted extraordinarily by John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer and are truly the heart and soul of the show.  Audiences can easily relate to the romantic tension and silly pranks between the two because of what could be called a ""normalcy complex"": they are the two most normal, fun characters on the show, and thus the audience roots for them due to the fact that they represent what we want to be at work.  Your heart will break as they both struggle to figure out a relationship that seems destined to be, but at the same time you will also laugh along with them as they pull their silly pranks on various office personnel.Finally, though, what truly sets this show apart from any other comedy series I have previously seen is the fact that storylines are progressed from episode to episode.  Unlike some half-hour comedies (like Family Guy) where, by and large, the slate is pretty much wiped clean after every episode, ""The Office"" instead builds on certain plot and character threads to create continuity.  Thus, the characters actually grow and learn on screen in front of you, so to speak, and don't just stagnate repeating the same old jokes or gags.Thus, I would pretty much recommend this show to anybody who has ever held a job (not too limiting, huh?!), as you will be able to instantly relate to the kind of antics that transpire.",5,Subtle Humor At Its Finest,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,3661,"['past', 'few', 'years', 'considered', 'TV', 'series', 'Family', 'Guy', 'be', 'funniest', 'show', 'tube', 'ability', 'poke', 'fun', 'anything', 'everything', 'more', 'likely', 'due', 'rather', 'sick', 'mind', 'creator', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'show', 'beat', 'head', 'sometimes', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'jokes', 'rather', 'crude', 'fashion', 'can', 'be', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'show', 'can', 'only', 'stay', 'fresh', 'so', 'long', 'having', 'up', 'shock', 'ante', 'episode.Just', 'recently', 'discovered', 'Office', 'utilizing', 'free', 'trial', 'Netflix', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'subtleness', 'humor', 'episode', 'had', 'watched', 'bits', 'pieces', 'certain', 'episodes', 'past', 'beginning', 'watch', 'broadcast', 'order', 'really', 'helped', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'enjoy', 'second', '20-minute', 'episode.Basically', 'show', 'set', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'paper', 'company', 'Scranton', 'PA', 'where', 'very', 'diverse', 'group', 'office', 'workers', 'work', '9-5', 'cubicle', 'life', 'direction', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'very', 'much', 'toned-down', 'more', 'realistically-funny', 'version', 'feature', 'film', 'Office', 'Space', 'here', 'catch', 'Michael', 'large', 'complete', 'idiot', 'thus', 'office', 'functions', 'accordingly.In', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'long', 'likely', 'due', 'trial', 'run', 'status', 'U.S.', 'see', 'could', 'duplicate', 'success', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'namesake', 'show', 'building', 'blocks', 'show', 'are', 'put', 'place', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'relationships', 'humor', 'Really', 'are', 'three', 'reasons', 'why', 'show', 'right', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'resonated', 'so', 'much', 'American', 'audiences', 'First', 'notion', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'relatable', 'potential', 'real-life', 'situations', 'Everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'idiot', 'boss', 'Michael', 'office', 'suck-up', 'Dwight', 'normal', 'cool', 'ones', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'pervert', 'Kevin', 'tightly-wound', 'frosty', 'woman', 'Angela', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'course', 'amped', 'up', 'bit', 'what', 'real', 'office', 'feels', 'still', 'sense', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'same', 'situation', 'are.Another', 'reason', 'show', 'so', 'successful', 'focus', 'characters', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'are', 'acted', 'extraordinarily', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'are', 'truly', 'heart', 'soul', 'show', 'Audiences', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', 'romantic', 'tension', 'silly', 'pranks', 'two', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'normalcy', 'complex', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'normal', 'fun', 'characters', 'show', 'thus', 'audience', 'roots', 'due', 'fact', 'represent', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'work', 'heart', 'will', 'break', 'struggle', 'figure', 'out', 'relationship', 'destined', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'also', 'laugh', 'along', 'pull', 'silly', 'pranks', 'various', 'office', 'personnel.Finally', 'though', 'what', 'truly', 'show', 'apart', 'other', 'comedy', 'series', 'have', 'previously', 'seen', 'fact', 'storylines', 'are', 'progressed', 'episode', 'episode', 'half-hour', 'comedies', 'Family', 'Guy', 'where', 'large', 'slate', 'pretty', 'much', 'wiped', 'clean', 'episode', 'Office', 'instead', 'certain', 'plot', 'character', 'threads', 'create', 'continuity', 'Thus', 'characters', 'actually', 'grow', 'learn', 'screen', 'front', 'so', 'speak', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'stagnate', 'repeating', 'same', 'old', 'jokes', 'gags.Thus', 'would', 'pretty', 'much', 'recommend', 'show', 'anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'held', 'job', 'not', 'too', 'limiting', 'huh', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'instantly', 'relate', 'kind', 'antics', 'transpire']",N/A
