A sweet story with lots of potential.  The editor and director did a pretty poor job of keeping the movie consistent.  Much talk is given about how isolated the cabin is in the movie then in one scene the front door is left open and in front of the place is a paved street with traffic.  Again, so isolated and three hoodlums end up there on a regular basis for lunch and scripture study.  Those inconsistencies could have easily been caught.  The speaking in the movies is often slightly halting, not natural flow of speaking.  Still Adam and Anthony are cute guys and the movie is fun watching their budding relationship despite the eventual tragedies.  Overall, the low end of a mediocre movie.  Would I have bought the movie knowing it's quality?  Probably not, however, I have  the movie and the dvd will stay part of my collection.",2,sweet movie,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,944,"['Not', 'typical', 'Ariztical', 'production', 'Most', 'have', 'are', 'either', 'good', 'terrible', 'one', 'middle', 'sweet', 'story', 'lots', 'potential', 'editor', 'director', 'did', 'pretty', 'poor', 'job', 'keeping', 'movie', 'consistent', 'Much', 'talk', 'given', 'how', 'isolated', 'cabin', 'movie', 'then', 'one', 'scene', 'front', 'door', 'left', 'open', 'front', 'place', 'paved', 'street', 'traffic', 'Again', 'so', 'isolated', 'three', 'hoodlums', 'end', 'up', 'there', 'regular', 'basis', 'lunch', 'scripture', 'study', 'inconsistencies', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'caught', 'speaking', 'movies', 'often', 'slightly', 'halting', 'not', 'natural', 'flow', 'speaking', 'Still', 'Adam', 'Anthony', 'are', 'cute', 'guys', 'movie', 'fun', 'watching', 'budding', 'relationship', 'eventual', 'tragedies', 'Overall', 'low', 'end', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'Would', 'have', 'bought', 'movie', 'knowing', 'quality', 'Probably', 'not', 'however', 'have', 'movie', 'dvd', 'will', 'stay', 'part', 'collection']",The House of Adam

1213629,A2FWL77XA94PK7,B001L67A1E,MovieBuffDan,"[3, 3]","Despite the negative reviews here, there are many elements that work well in this film. The storyline is fairly engaging, though not always believable. The soundtrack is versatile and appealing. The way that the opening credits were presented quickly pulled me in to watch, something that many film-makers on low budget films seem to neglect. Plus, there's some beautiful cinematography, the sets look really nice and the cast are all visually appealing. However, as (visually)appealing as the cast may be, most of them simply could not act. The actor who played Adam was probably the most believable character. For the most part though, I felt like I was watching actors in a high school play. Perhaps the worst actors were the married couple that (unfortunately) occupied about the last one-third of the film. For me, that's when the film really fell apart. Not only did the storyline veer off into left field, but the acting quality really plummeted, once the script relied on their acting ability to keep the story moving along. To complicate matters, the male lead playing the detective was not a strong actor either and he was prominently featured in that last segment as well. It simply didn't work. That's a shame, because this movie had some interesting elements to it, but it was simply doomed by the casting choices that were made. Score: 2.5 stars",3,Many elements work well in the House of Adam.,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,1359,"['negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'many', 'elements', 'work', 'well', 'film', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'not', 'always', 'believable', 'soundtrack', 'versatile', 'appealing', 'way', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'presented', 'quickly', 'pulled', 'watch', 'something', 'many', 'film-makers', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'seem', 'neglect', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'look', 'really', 'nice', 'cast', 'are', 'visually', 'appealing', 'However', 'visually', 'appealing', 'cast', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Adam', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'believable', 'character', 'most', 'part', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'actors', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'Perhaps', 'worst', 'actors', 'were', 'married', 'couple', 'unfortunately', 'occupied', 'last', 'one-third', 'film', 'when', 'film', 'really', 'fell', 'apart', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'storyline', 'veer', 'left', 'field', 'acting', 'quality', 'really', 'plummeted', 'once', 'script', 'relied', 'acting', 'ability', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'along', 'complicate', 'matters', 'male', 'lead', 'playing', 'detective', 'was', 'not', 'strong', 'actor', 'was', 'prominently', 'featured', 'last', 'segment', 'as', 'well', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'shame', 'movie', 'had', 'interesting', 'elements', 'was', 'simply', 'doomed', 'casting', 'choices', 'were', 'made', 'Score', '2.5', 'stars']",The House of Adam
