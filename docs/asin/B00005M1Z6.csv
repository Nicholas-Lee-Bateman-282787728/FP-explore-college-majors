I didn't really have high expectations for the series.After watching this, I completely fell in love with the series. It's a cute, fun magical girl series with some romance!If you like Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura, I highly recommend getting this, it's one of my faves!",5,All I can say is &quot;wow&quot;!!!,1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,351,"['picked', 'volumes', '1', '2', 'up', 'whim', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'birthday', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'series.After', 'watching', 'completely', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'cute', 'fun', 'magical', 'girl', 'series', 'romance', 'like', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'one', 'faves']",Saint Tail - Thief of Hearts VHS
664796,A1VZA7V8HJ2SZ6,B00005M1Z6,"Gwenn Cosmis ""cardcaptor moon""","[0, 0]","As with the other two series that I also collect{SM and CCS}I wanted to buy the manga first. I didn't think this series would be that good, so I was a little hesitant. But as soon as I finished reading it, I wanted to get more. And I got all seven comics. But when I got the first anime video, big change.For starters, there were more episodes in the comic than there were in the anime{only this movie}. And the episodes were totally switched around{ex: In the manga, Ruby doesn't come until comic 3, but in the anime, she comes in the last episode of this movie}. And there are also objects that aren't in the manga, but are in the anime, like St. Tail's brooch. However{this is the reason I'm giving this review four stars instead of five}, this movie is shorter than the others, and definately not as good, because it doesn't have the japanese language on it like the others{the theme song is in japanese with english subtitles, there's subtitles throughout the movie, but not the whole movie, and the ending theme is also in japanese with no english subtitles}, which I think would make the movie a million times better. After all{in my opinion}, the ending theme and beginning theme have just a bunch of pictures in it. But in japanese, I think it really means something.I recommend this to people who are fans of Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura",4,"This show introduced me to alot, but...",1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,1352,"['other', 'two', 'series', 'also', 'collect', 'SM', 'CCS', 'wanted', 'buy', 'manga', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'little', 'hesitant', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'reading', 'wanted', 'get', 'more', 'got', 'seven', 'comics', 'when', 'got', 'first', 'anime', 'video', 'big', 'change.For', 'starters', 'were', 'more', 'episodes', 'comic', 'were', 'anime', 'only', 'movie', 'episodes', 'were', 'totally', 'switched', 'ex', 'manga', 'Ruby', ""n't"", 'come', 'comic', '3', 'anime', 'last', 'episode', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'objects', 'are', ""n't"", 'manga', 'are', 'anime', 'St.', 'Tail', 'brooch', 'However', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'review', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'movie', 'shorter', 'others', 'definately', 'not', 'good', ""n't"", 'have', 'japanese', 'language', 'others', 'theme', 'song', 'japanese', 'english', 'subtitles', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'not', 'whole', 'movie', 'ending', 'theme', 'also', 'japanese', 'english', 'subtitles', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'opinion', 'ending', 'theme', 'beginning', 'theme', 'have', 'just', 'bunch', 'pictures', 'japanese', 'think', 'really', 'something.I', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura']",Saint Tail - Thief of Hearts VHS

664798,A3H9QIZJ3KL5S3,B00005M1Z6,"J. Reel ""rabbitnthemoon""","[2, 2]","Just recently I bought this at a store and it came with the first issue of the manga for free. So I'm thinking why not? Give it a chance.  So I read the Manga then I watched the first disk, and this is what I think.  I didn't think it was fantastic, but I did like it.  To me it seemed like a series that would grow over time and I think I'm right.  The anime was pretty accurate, at least to the english version of manga, and it made me want to get the second issue on both versions.  But if you want to know what I think of the second version your going to have to read that review, but anyway if you like shows like sailor moon and cardcaptor, I would have to say it's similar in it's own way.  It is pretty original, but I have to say some of the plot lines are pretty cheesy.  So I'm pretty sure your wondering what I did like about this series, well Duh!!! The Love story, to tell you the truth that's why I'm hooked.  It's so cute, but the thing is Meime who is also Saint Tail can't tell Asuka Jr. that she's in love with him because he doesn't know that she is Saint Tail, which if you ask me I think he's in love with Saint Tail without knowing that she's his fellow classmate at school during the day. I'm sure you can imagine being around the guy you love and he doesn't even know who you really are.  But if you are somewhat interested in watching this I would say go for, mostly just for the chase Asuka Jr puts on for Saint Tail, It makes me wish I was chased after like she is!!!!! A must have if you like cute simple anime!!!",4,This could turn into a beautiful beggining,1005609600,"11 13, 2001",2001,1542,"['Just', 'recently', 'bought', 'store', 'came', 'first', 'issue', 'manga', 'free', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'why', 'not', 'Give', 'chance', 'read', 'Manga', 'then', 'watched', 'first', 'disk', 'what', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'fantastic', 'did', 'seemed', 'series', 'would', 'grow', 'time', 'think', ""'m"", 'right', 'anime', 'was', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'least', 'english', 'version', 'manga', 'made', 'want', 'get', 'second', 'issue', 'versions', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'second', 'version', 'going', 'have', 'read', 'review', 'anyway', 'like', 'shows', 'sailor', 'moon', 'cardcaptor', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'similar', 'own', 'way', 'pretty', 'original', 'have', 'say', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'pretty', 'cheesy', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'wondering', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'series', 'well', 'Duh', 'Love', 'story', 'tell', 'truth', 'why', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'so', 'cute', 'thing', 'Meime', 'who', 'also', 'Saint', 'Tail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Asuka', 'Jr.', 'love', ""n't"", 'know', 'Saint', 'Tail', 'ask', 'think', 'love', 'Saint', 'Tail', 'knowing', 'fellow', 'classmate', 'school', 'day', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'imagine', 'being', 'guy', 'love', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'are', 'somewhat', 'interested', 'watching', 'would', 'say', 'go', 'mostly', 'just', 'chase', 'Asuka', 'Jr', 'Saint', 'Tail', 'wish', 'was', 'chased', 'must', 'have', 'like', 'cute', 'simple', 'anime']",Saint Tail - Thief of Hearts VHS
