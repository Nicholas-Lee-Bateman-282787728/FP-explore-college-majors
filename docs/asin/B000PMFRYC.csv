1072301,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B000PMFRYC,Darren,"[1, 1]","[This review is for those who have already seen the movie, so proceed with caution]This movie was a big deal when I was in 9th grade.  One of the goals for 14-year-old boys in 1983 was to sneak into the theater to see &#34;Class&#34;, because it was about a 40-ish woman who has an affair with a high school kid, and it was the rare R-rated teen movie.It's also a true Brat-Pack movie before that phrase entered the lexicon after 85's &#34;Breakfast Club&#34;.  While Rob Lowe had already done some film work, &#34;Class&#34; introduced us to Andrew McCarthy, Alan Ruck, Virginia Madsen, and John Cusack.  Cusack's first words on film: &#34;Great, douchebag!&#34; directed at McCarthy, who almost creamed him with a trunk that slipped down the dorm stairs.  As for Madsen, she won't discuss this movie even today, claiming that &#34;those guys were a-holes&#34;.  Very interesting.  I wonder if Lowe in one of his several autobiographies discusses what happened on the set of &#34;Class&#34;.  I rather doubt it.  The fact that Madsen endures having to expose a breast on film is probably a clue.Luckily, the movie is more than its real-life backstory.  It is, in fact, quite well done from start to finish, and I remain mystified by the continuing dismissal of it even from critics today.  McCarthy was never much of an actor, but his inexperience doesn't harm him here.  Lowe is the clear star of the picture.  We're willing to like him even as he's playing a horrible prank on new-kid McCarthy; his laughter seems so good-natured that we don't hate him, and in any case the character's decency comes through pretty quickly when he thinks McCarthy is seriously wounded by the prank.  Their friendship is genuine in the way of opposites attracting: one boy is serious-minded, poor, wanting to be rich; the other is a wealthy party-animal who only gets serious when there's no other alternative.  They're useful to each other.  It's convincing.  And it had better be, because the Devastating Reveal at the end of the second act would not work if we didn't believe in their friendship.  This movie is often compared to &#34;The Graduate&#34;, but I get a totally different vibe from this, and, let's be honest, Dustin Hoffman is far more knowing in that movie than McCarthy is here.  McCarthy's also younger: he's a high school kid trying to come of age, but in the meantime utterly out of his depth.  Hoffman was a COLLEGE graduate, and wasn't it just a bit creepy when, after enjoying the mother, he actively pursues the daughter?  Different characters, different movies, and in any case, &#34;The Graduate&#34; didn't copyright the notion of older-woman / younger-man romance.Indeed, the creepy one here is Jacqueline Bisset as Lowe's mother, primeval milf, bored trophy-wife of gazillionaire Cliff Robertson who hates government regulations.  While one may forgive the boredom of living with such a man, it's somewhat harder to forgive pestering the teenager after she discovers that he is in fact a teenager.  She's a monster who is finally clever enough to check herself into a psych ward, which is certainly a breezier alternative to McCarthy (or Lowe) pressing charges of statutory rape.  But, as the wise and easy-going Lowe says upon hearing the news from his father, &#34;Let's face it, we're a bleeped-up family&#34;.  As are we all.5 out of 5 -- nothing wrong with this classic, except maybe for Elmer Bernstein's outdated score.",5,Coming of age,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,3441,"['[', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'proceed', 'caution', ']', 'movie', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'when', 'was', '9th', 'grade', 'One', 'goals', '14-year-old', 'boys', '1983', 'was', 'sneak', 'theater', 'see', '34', 'Class', '34', 'was', '40-ish', 'woman', 'who', 'affair', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'was', 'rare', 'R-rated', 'teen', 'movie.It', 'also', 'true', 'Brat-Pack', 'movie', 'phrase', 'entered', 'lexicon', '85', '34', 'Breakfast', 'Club', '34', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'had', 'already', 'done', 'film', 'work', '34', 'Class', '34', 'introduced', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'Alan', 'Ruck', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Cusack', 'first', 'words', 'film', '34', 'Great', 'douchebag', '34', 'directed', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'almost', 'creamed', 'trunk', 'slipped', 'dorm', 'stairs', 'Madsen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'movie', 'even', 'today', 'claiming', '34', 'guys', 'were', 'a-holes', '34', 'Very', 'interesting', 'wonder', 'Lowe', 'one', 'several', 'autobiographies', 'what', 'happened', 'set', '34', 'Class', '34', 'rather', 'doubt', 'fact', 'Madsen', 'having', 'expose', 'breast', 'film', 'probably', 'clue.Luckily', 'movie', 'more', 'real-life', 'backstory', 'fact', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'start', 'finish', 'remain', 'mystified', 'continuing', 'dismissal', 'even', 'critics', 'today', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'never', 'much', 'actor', 'inexperience', ""n't"", 'harm', 'here', 'Lowe', 'clear', 'star', 'picture', ""'re"", 'willing', 'even', 'playing', 'horrible', 'prank', 'new-kid', 'McCarthy', 'laughter', 'so', 'good-natured', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'case', 'character', 'decency', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'when', 'McCarthy', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'prank', 'friendship', 'genuine', 'way', 'opposites', 'attracting', 'one', 'boy', 'serious-minded', 'poor', 'wanting', 'be', 'rich', 'other', 'wealthy', 'party-animal', 'who', 'only', 'serious', 'when', 'other', 'alternative', ""'re"", 'useful', 'other', 'convincing', 'had', 'better', 'be', 'Devastating', 'Reveal', 'end', 'second', 'act', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'friendship', 'movie', 'often', 'compared', '34', 'Graduate', '34', 'get', 'totally', 'different', 'vibe', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'far', 'more', 'knowing', 'movie', 'McCarthy', 'here', 'McCarthy', 'also', 'younger', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'trying', 'come', 'age', 'meantime', 'utterly', 'depth', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'COLLEGE', 'graduate', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'bit', 'creepy', 'when', 'enjoying', 'mother', 'actively', 'daughter', 'Different', 'characters', 'different', 'movies', 'case', '34', 'Graduate', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'copyright', 'notion', 'older-woman', '/', 'younger-man', 'romance.Indeed', 'creepy', 'one', 'here', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'Lowe', 'mother', 'primeval', 'milf', 'bored', 'trophy-wife', 'gazillionaire', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'who', 'government', 'regulations', 'one', 'may', 'forgive', 'boredom', 'living', 'man', 'somewhat', 'harder', 'forgive', 'pestering', 'teenager', 'fact', 'teenager', 'monster', 'who', 'finally', 'clever', 'enough', 'check', 'psych', 'ward', 'certainly', 'breezier', 'alternative', 'McCarthy', 'Lowe', 'pressing', 'charges', 'statutory', 'rape', 'wise', 'easy-going', 'Lowe', 'hearing', 'news', 'father', '34', 'Let', 'face', ""'re"", 'bleeped-up', 'family', '34', 'are', 'all.5', '5', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'classic', 'maybe', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'outdated', 'score']",N/A
