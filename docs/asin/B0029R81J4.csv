1257123,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0029R81J4,Enjolras,"[16, 21]","I got this because I loved the BBC seriesWalking with Dinosaurs. However,National Geographic: Sea Monsters - A Prehistoric Adventure (In 3-D) [Blu-ray] isn't quite as good as that series. Rather, it features clips of paleontologists digging for fossils, with scenes of the CG sea monsters interspliced. As such, it isn't as entertaining or exciting as the BBC series, which shows just the dinosaurs. If you want a great series on prehistoric sea monsters, check out BBC'sChased By Dinosaurs, which in addition to dinosaurs has a mini-series featuring sea monsters that is much longer thanNational Geographic: Sea Monsters - A Prehistoric Adventure (In 3-D) [Blu-ray]. In the series, Nigel Marvin chases, and in turn is chased by, sea monsters from a variety of different time periods. It's both more entertaining and educational.",2,Not as good as the BBC series,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,829,"['got', 'loved', 'BBC', 'seriesWalking', 'Dinosaurs', 'However', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Sea', 'Monsters', 'Prehistoric', 'Adventure', '3-D', 'Blu-ray', ']', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'Rather', 'clips', 'paleontologists', 'digging', 'fossils', 'scenes', 'CG', 'sea', 'monsters', 'interspliced', 'such', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'BBC', 'series', 'just', 'dinosaurs', 'want', 'great', 'series', 'prehistoric', 'sea', 'monsters', 'check', 'out', ""BBC'sChased"", 'Dinosaurs', 'addition', 'dinosaurs', 'mini-series', 'featuring', 'sea', 'monsters', 'much', 'longer', 'thanNational', 'Geographic', 'Sea', 'Monsters', 'Prehistoric', 'Adventure', '3-D', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'series', 'Nigel', 'Marvin', 'chases', 'turn', 'chased', 'sea', 'monsters', 'variety', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'more', 'entertaining', 'educational']",N/A

First, the glasses had the red and blue reversed, making them unusable, but when viewing this mess, with glasses I had, there was no part of the experience that came even close to being 3-D. Unless I got a very bad copy, this was as dull in content as I would ever wish to experience, so the only thing that could possibly have saved it would have been spectacular 3-D.National Geographic has really gone way down if they consider this entertainment, and as far as the other reviewers go...well!

I originally got this for the family (with no 3D TV) but watched it first (in a nice dark room) to see what it was like.  WOW!  First the story was excellent.  The graphics were great and some of the 3D on this was better than what I've bought on 3D TV movies (Jurassic Park comes to mind - for one).  Seriously, I was really impressed. I showed several of my friends and then bought a copy for me and my father.  Yes, I thought it was that good and I'm proud to give National Geographic 5 full stars. In my humble opinion this was an excellent movie and everyone I've showed it to has thought so as well. Great 3D no special equipment required.",5,One of my favorites!
