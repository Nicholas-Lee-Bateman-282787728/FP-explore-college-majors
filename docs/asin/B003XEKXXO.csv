They love watching it over and over so I definitely recommend buying it from Amazon along with the other Kai-Lan dvds.,5,awesome,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,142,"['Great', 'dvd', 'kids', 'love', 'watching', 'so', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'other', 'Kai-Lan', 'dvds']",Ni Hao Kai-Lan: Princess Kai-Lan
1370489,A3SYY8KVBFI2C8,B003XEKXXO,kdl,"[0, 0]","I had not seen this show before buying this dvd other than a promo in a Yo Gabba Gabba dvd so I was expecting something girly. I bought it thinking probably my son won't like this but it was at a great price so I figured I could pass on to my niece. Put it one one day when he was a little cranky and he instantly was liking this show. I also enjoyed watching it. Cute characters (my favorite is Ho Ho even thought he is a bit whiny about things being different and he doesn't want to try anything new and he is a bit dramatic about the moon being hid by the clouds at the festival) and good example for your kids to learn to get along with others, try new things, and to handle disappointment in a positive way. I am going to see about buying some more Ni Hao Kai-Lan dvds. You don't learn a ton of chinese but its fun to say the words and it is a good way to get kids interested in learning more. Best snacks to eat while watching this: Banana Crackers, Lychee fruit, and Steamed Dumplings! Hope this review is helpful to somebody.",5,Cute!,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,1033,"['had', 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'buying', 'dvd', 'other', 'promo', 'Yo', 'Gabba', 'Gabba', 'so', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'girly', 'bought', 'thinking', 'probably', 'son', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'great', 'price', 'so', 'figured', 'could', 'pass', 'niece', 'Put', 'one', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'cranky', 'instantly', 'was', 'liking', 'show', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Cute', 'characters', 'favorite', 'Ho', 'Ho', 'even', 'thought', 'bit', 'whiny', 'things', 'being', 'different', ""n't"", 'want', 'try', 'anything', 'new', 'bit', 'dramatic', 'moon', 'being', 'hid', 'clouds', 'festival', 'good', 'example', 'kids', 'learn', 'get', 'others', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'handle', 'disappointment', 'positive', 'way', 'am', 'going', 'see', 'buying', 'more', 'Ni', 'Hao', 'Kai-Lan', 'dvds', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'ton', 'chinese', 'fun', 'say', 'words', 'good', 'way', 'get', 'kids', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'Best', 'snacks', 'eat', 'watching', 'Banana', 'Crackers', 'Lychee', 'fruit', 'Steamed', 'Dumplings', 'Hope', 'review', 'helpful', 'somebody']",Ni Hao Kai-Lan: Princess Kai-Lan
1370490,A1SMU2LDMEIBWJ,B003XEKXXO,P. Toche,"[1, 3]","This is a cute cartoon and my son loves it. The cartoon is helping him improve his English.yes, English.There is only very little Chinese, probably no more than what we all already know, e.g. ""Nee How"".While there is a little bit about the Chinese wall and the monkey King (keyword here is ""about""), the dialogs are in English, the songs are in English, and the little there is about Chinese culture is a very American vision (""this is such a great wall!"") and the drawings are basically Japanese.I am VERY disappointed because I was under the impression that it was a cartoon to teach kids about China and the Chinese language. I may have been wrong about my expectations, but I expect other parents here are also looking for a DVD for their child to learn some Chinese. There is only one audiotrack, not even a Chinese language version!There doesn't seem to be any Chinese Hanzi characters either.Besides that, I also think it's lame, but then I'm 40 so perhaps too old to appreciate it.My son is currently learning Chinese thanks to a Mickey Mouse DVD with dual track English-Mandarin.
