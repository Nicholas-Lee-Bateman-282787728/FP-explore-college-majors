870185,AHKP7P4T2QDU5,B0006J280U,Aubrey Ward III,"[14, 16]","The movie itself is enjoyable. A great story about a family where one daughter dreams of being married to her true love while the other daughter is just grateful if she gets married at all. So, different suitors come and a couple actually stick around by the movie's end. The fun part of the movie is seeing who will end up with who. The plot takes a really bold turn when daddy dies and an unexpected party ends up with the will, and the house! The songs are also well done. The song used during the filming of a movie (towards the end) is a really nice and catchy tune. The romantic daydream scenes were also done very well.But one star was lopped off because of those horrible subtitles. Misspelled words, incomplete sentences, and even the songs were poorly translated. And keep that pause button handy because when the subs do show up they are wicked fast. However, I was still able to follow the story along. The bad subs don't totally ruin the experience but it does create a minor inconvenience. Hopefully, someone will remaster this little gem and redo those translations. Otherwise, this is more substantial proof that India knows how to make great cinema.",4,"Good movie, bad subtitles",1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,1166,"['movie', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'story', 'family', 'where', 'one', 'daughter', 'dreams', 'being', 'married', 'true', 'love', 'other', 'daughter', 'just', 'grateful', 'married', 'So', 'different', 'suitors', 'come', 'couple', 'actually', 'stick', 'around', 'movie', 'end', 'fun', 'part', 'movie', 'seeing', 'who', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'who', 'plot', 'really', 'bold', 'turn', 'when', 'daddy', 'dies', 'unexpected', 'party', 'up', 'will', 'house', 'songs', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'song', 'used', 'filming', 'movie', 'end', 'really', 'nice', 'catchy', 'tune', 'romantic', 'daydream', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'done', 'very', 'well.But', 'one', 'star', 'was', 'lopped', 'off', 'horrible', 'subtitles', 'Misspelled', 'words', 'incomplete', 'sentences', 'even', 'songs', 'were', 'poorly', 'translated', 'keep', 'pause', 'button', 'handy', 'when', 'subs', 'do', 'show', 'up', 'are', 'wicked', 'fast', 'However', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'follow', 'story', 'along', 'bad', 'subs', 'do', ""n't"", 'totally', 'ruin', 'experience', 'create', 'minor', 'inconvenience', 'Hopefully', 'someone', 'will', 'remaster', 'little', 'gem', 'redo', 'translations', 'Otherwise', 'more', 'substantial', 'proof', 'India', 'how', 'make', 'great', 'cinema']",I Have Found It
870186,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0006J280U,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[162, 163]","This Tamil-language ""Kollywood"" film provided an interesting contrast to the Bollywood films I have recently seen.  There are differences between the two Indian cinema styles, although both present their stories in similar ways.  Not only the language, but the gestures and facial expressions differ between this Tamil film and its Hindi cinematic cousins.  Kandukondain Kandukondain (I Have Found It) didn't seem as flashy or energetic, and the music and dancing also seem to reflect a more subdued different style.  As I was watching the film, I thought to myself that this was a four-star film, but once it ended and I began reflecting upon what I had just seen, I realized that I was more impressed than I thought.  Inspired by Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, I Have Found It does deliver great drama and romance, wonderfully rich characters, and - of course - great entertainment of both mind and soul.This is basically the story of two sisters - one serious and pragmatic, the other wide-eyed and idealistic.  Products of a good family, they enjoy an easy lifestyle, but all of that is put in jeopardy by the death of the girls' grandfather.  Forced to leave their own home, they move to Madras and struggle to get by on almost nothing.  The older daughter, Sowmya (Tabu), has trouble finding work because she is overqualified, and she is also burdened with the social stigma of being jinxed after the death of her fianc&eacute; and a string of reluctant suitors.  She meets a young filmmaker in the most embarrassing of circumstances, but their possible marriage has to be delayed until such time as he makes his first film - and time and distance pose new problems that have Sowmya coming to believe that she truly is cursed in love.  Meenakshi (Rai) is a hopeless romantic who fully expects the man born for her to ride in on a white horse and sweep her off her feet.  She thinks she has found him in a flashy, brash stockbroker who can quote Bharathi, but he is besieged by severe financial problems and basically leaves her hanging for months on end.  This is all rather disheartening to Major Bala, a family friend, who has fallen in love with her.  Bala isn't a natural match for Meena; he's older, he lost a leg in the Sri Lankan campaign, and he has a tendency to turn all conversations to guns and fighting.  No matter what his head tells him, though, he can't change his heart.The film runs about two and a half hours, which is almost short for Indian cinema, but it tells a beautiful, multi-layered story full of great drama.  You don't witness the kind of passionate romance that Hindi films tend to portray, but there's a realism to this story that makes it special.  Mahmooty is wonderful as Bala, a bitter man who really turns his life around because of Meena.  Tabu's emotional performance as the unlucky Sowmya who almost gives up on love in the interest of practicality is also marvelous.  Aishwarya Rai is, of course, absolutely wonderful as Meena, although I must admit I wasn't completely enamored with her character early on.  Sowyma and Neena represent sense and sensibility in their individual characters, but it is a combination of both characteristics that will finally lead them to the romance each one dreams of.The film's music, composed by the brilliant A.R. Rahman, is excellent, although I much prefer the music of your typical Bollywood film.  This music is just slightly different from what I'm used to - less energetic and heart-pounding.  The music, like the film itself, just seems less energetic than what would find in a Bollywood offering.  This isn't a bad thing, it's just different.  As for the subtitles, I had no problem with them whatsoever.  If there was any lag in my Kino DVD of this film, I surely didn't detect it.  The bottom line is this: Kandukondain Kandukondain is a feast for the senses and an impassioned human drama.  You just can't find storytelling like this in the canned movies coming out of Hollywood.",5,A beautiful film well worth discovering,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,3977,"['Tamil-language', 'Kollywood', 'film', 'provided', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'have', 'recently', 'seen', 'are', 'differences', 'two', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'styles', 'present', 'stories', 'similar', 'ways', 'Not', 'only', 'language', 'gestures', 'facial', 'expressions', 'differ', 'Tamil', 'film', 'Hindi', 'cinematic', 'cousins', 'Kandukondain', 'Kandukondain', 'Have', 'Found', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'flashy', 'energetic', 'music', 'dancing', 'also', 'seem', 'reflect', 'more', 'subdued', 'different', 'style', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'thought', 'myself', 'was', 'four-star', 'film', 'ended', 'began', 'reflecting', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'realized', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'thought', 'Inspired', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Have', 'Found', 'deliver', 'great', 'drama', 'romance', 'wonderfully', 'rich', 'characters', 'course', 'great', 'entertainment', 'mind', 'soul.This', 'basically', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'one', 'serious', 'pragmatic', 'other', 'wide-eyed', 'idealistic', 'Products', 'good', 'family', 'enjoy', 'easy', 'lifestyle', 'put', 'jeopardy', 'death', 'girls', 'grandfather', 'Forced', 'leave', 'own', 'home', 'move', 'Madras', 'struggle', 'get', 'almost', 'nothing', 'older', 'daughter', 'Sowmya', 'Tabu', 'trouble', 'finding', 'work', 'overqualified', 'also', 'burdened', 'social', 'stigma', 'being', 'jinxed', 'death', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'string', 'reluctant', 'suitors', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'circumstances', 'possible', 'marriage', 'be', 'delayed', 'such', 'time', 'first', 'film', 'time', 'distance', 'pose', 'new', 'problems', 'have', 'Sowmya', 'coming', 'believe', 'truly', 'cursed', 'love', 'Meenakshi', 'Rai', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'who', 'fully', 'man', 'born', 'ride', 'white', 'horse', 'sweep', 'feet', 'found', 'flashy', 'brash', 'stockbroker', 'who', 'can', 'quote', 'Bharathi', 'besieged', 'severe', 'financial', 'problems', 'basically', 'hanging', 'months', 'end', 'rather', 'disheartening', 'Major', 'Bala', 'family', 'friend', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'Bala', ""n't"", 'natural', 'match', 'Meena', 'older', 'lost', 'leg', 'Sri', 'Lankan', 'campaign', 'tendency', 'turn', 'conversations', 'guns', 'fighting', 'matter', 'what', 'head', 'though', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'heart.The', 'film', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'almost', 'short', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'beautiful', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'full', 'great', 'drama', 'do', ""n't"", 'witness', 'kind', 'passionate', 'romance', 'Hindi', 'films', 'tend', 'portray', 'realism', 'story', 'special', 'Mahmooty', 'wonderful', 'Bala', 'bitter', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'life', 'Meena', 'Tabu', 'emotional', 'performance', 'unlucky', 'Sowmya', 'who', 'almost', 'up', 'love', 'interest', 'practicality', 'also', 'marvelous', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'course', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Meena', 'must', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'enamored', 'character', 'early', 'Sowyma', 'Neena', 'represent', 'sense', 'sensibility', 'individual', 'characters', 'combination', 'characteristics', 'will', 'finally', 'lead', 'romance', 'one', 'of.The', 'film', 'music', 'composed', 'brilliant', 'A.R', 'Rahman', 'excellent', 'much', 'prefer', 'music', 'typical', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'music', 'just', 'slightly', 'different', 'what', ""'m"", 'used', 'less', 'energetic', 'heart-pounding', 'music', 'film', 'just', 'less', 'energetic', 'what', 'would', 'find', 'Bollywood', 'offering', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'different', 'subtitles', 'had', 'problem', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'lag', 'Kino', 'DVD', 'film', 'surely', 'did', ""n't"", 'detect', 'bottom', 'line', 'Kandukondain', 'Kandukondain', 'feast', 'senses', 'impassioned', 'human', 'drama', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'storytelling', 'canned', 'movies', 'coming', 'Hollywood']",I Have Found It
870187,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B0006J280U,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[17, 20]","This is a great Kollywood film that can definitely be enjoyed by fans of the genre, or those who have never seen this type of film before.  For those of you unfamiliar with the Kollywood films of India, they combine action, romance, drama, comedy and musical numbers (some that appear to be straight out of an Indian music video) into one complex piece. They also differ from Bollywood films, because they are filmed in the Southern region of India, and, like this one, are presented in the Tamil language. In the case of I HAVE FOUND IT, the storyline is taken directly from Jane Austen's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  The tale of three daughters (two of them, grown), their widowed mother, and the men who court the young women has been updated from 19th century England, to modern-day India.I HAVE FOUND IT is intelligently written (and very well translated), the photography is rich, beautiful and really makes you feel a part of the story.  It pulls you in with lovely colors, intriguing camera angles and makes poetry of the beautiful faces and forms of the lead actresses, Aishraya Rai (Meenakshi), the ""sensibility"" sister, and Tabu (""Sowmya""), the ""sense"" sister.  All the actors dance and act beautifully (and also lip synch very convincingly to the songs--another hallmark of Bollywood).  This film is refreshingly well thought out, compelling and warm.I am hoping that more people come to appreciate Indian film, through watching movies like this.  Of course, the Bollywood productions are not the only great thing about Indian cinema (we can't forget about the late, great Satyajit Ray and the contemporary filmmaker Mira Nair, whose productions didn't need flashy costuming or crowdpleasing moves to appeal to our hearts and minds).

870190,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0006J280U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[12, 13]","Having been semi-introduced to Bollywood thru Bride and Prejudice and thus to Aishwarya Rai, I was eager to see another Indian film done ala Jane Austen. I'm pleased and somewhat relieved to say that Kandukondain Kandukondain (I Have Found It), based on Austen's Sense & Sensibility, comes up a definite winner.  This is another superb film effort teeming with bright colors, lavish costumes, bright sets, eye-popping song & dance routines, well-cast actors and a classic storyline.I Have Found It is the tale of two sisters and their travails, romantically, financially, socially. Tabu plays Sowmya, the pragmatic, somewhat withdrawn sister, who feels she is bad luck when it comes to love; Aishwarya Rai is Meenakshi, the romantic sister, brimming with life, not afraid to dream and then pursue that dream; Ajith portrays Manohar, a would be director who spurns his father's offer to work for his business and vows to marry the emotionally fragile Sowmya as soon as he directs his first film; Mammootty's character is Bala, a bitter one-legged, ex-soldier drunkard who nevertheless is steadfast in his unrequited love for the unattainable Meena and seemingly is always there when Meena needs him most; Abbas plays Srikanth, a rich businessman who recites poetry and becomes the center of Meena's world, much to Bala's quiet despair. Anyone who has read Sense & Sensibility should be able to recognize the characters and somewhat follow along with the story's unfolding.There is a certain sense of realism here, mostly brought about by the acting of Mammooty, which nevertheless doesn't take away from the romantic feel of the movie; I Have Found It doesn't have the overblown, all-encompassing love affair of a movie like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam or Taal, for example (although Meena's romance with Srikanth is giddy enough).  Bala (played to world-weary perfection by Mammootty) seems to be old enough to be Meena's father and is not at all your typical Romeo, in the looks or amorous behavior department, yet it's pretty obvious he is the one viewers will be rooting for. I found Sowmya and Manohar's relationship interesting enough but to be honest, I couldn't wait for the movie to refocus on Meena, Srikanth and Bala, which, to me, was the more intriguing storyline (maybe my bias for Aish sneaking thru).There are great songs here but I have 3 favorites. ""Yenna Solla Pogirai?"" (What Will Your Answer Be?) features Manohar (Ajith), with pretty cool dance steps, wooing Sowmya; ""Kanjun Meinakalei"" (Song to the Mynah Bird) is the first song in the movie and it pretty much sums up Aish's optimistic, the world-is-my-oyster sensibilities; but the best one is ""Kannamoochi Yennada"" (Hide and Seek), which shows off Aishwarya Rai dancing at her most ravishing (in fact, ""Kannamoochi Yennada"" might be my favorite Aish music number of all time); the exquisite choreagraphy in this showstopper, the way Aish moves and expresses herself...geez, you literally cannot take your eyes away from her.I Have Found It is two and a half hours long, quite short by Bollywood standards. But it is a few hours that will pass by very enjoyably; and when the movie is over, you will sigh, romantic viewer that you are, and ruefully shrug away the spell that was cast over you and then resignedly go back to reality, but hopefully taking with you the knowledge that there are movies out there infinitely better than the Son of the Mask.",5,JANE AUSTEN IN INDIA,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,3421,"['Having', 'been', 'semi-introduced', 'Bollywood', 'thru', 'Bride', 'Prejudice', 'thus', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'Indian', 'film', 'done', 'ala', 'Jane', 'Austen', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'somewhat', 'relieved', 'say', 'Kandukondain', 'Kandukondain', 'Have', 'Found', 'based', 'Austen', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'up', 'definite', 'winner', 'superb', 'film', 'effort', 'teeming', 'bright', 'colors', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'bright', 'sets', 'eye-popping', 'song', 'dance', 'routines', 'well-cast', 'actors', 'classic', 'storyline.I', 'Have', 'Found', 'tale', 'two', 'sisters', 'travails', 'romantically', 'financially', 'socially', 'Tabu', 'Sowmya', 'pragmatic', 'somewhat', 'withdrawn', 'sister', 'who', 'bad', 'luck', 'when', 'love', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'Meenakshi', 'romantic', 'sister', 'brimming', 'life', 'not', 'afraid', 'dream', 'then', 'pursue', 'dream', 'Ajith', 'Manohar', 'would', 'be', 'director', 'who', 'father', 'offer', 'work', 'business', 'vows', 'marry', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'Sowmya', 'as', 'soon', 'first', 'film', 'Mammootty', 'character', 'Bala', 'bitter', 'one-legged', 'ex-soldier', 'drunkard', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'steadfast', 'unrequited', 'love', 'unattainable', 'Meena', 'seemingly', 'always', 'when', 'Meena', 'most', 'Abbas', 'Srikanth', 'rich', 'businessman', 'who', 'poetry', 'center', 'Meena', 'world', 'much', 'Bala', 'quiet', 'despair', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'follow', 'along', 'story', 'unfolding.There', 'certain', 'sense', 'realism', 'here', 'mostly', 'brought', 'about', 'acting', 'Mammooty', 'nevertheless', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'romantic', 'feel', 'movie', 'Have', 'Found', ""n't"", 'have', 'overblown', 'all-encompassing', 'love', 'affair', 'movie', 'Hum', 'Dil', 'De', 'Chuke', 'Sanam', 'Taal', 'example', 'Meena', 'romance', 'Srikanth', 'giddy', 'enough', 'Bala', 'played', 'world-weary', 'perfection', 'Mammootty', 'be', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'Meena', 'father', 'not', 'typical', 'Romeo', 'looks', 'amorous', 'behavior', 'department', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'one', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'rooting', 'found', 'Sowmya', 'Manohar', 'relationship', 'interesting', 'enough', 'be', 'honest', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'refocus', 'Meena', 'Srikanth', 'Bala', 'was', 'more', 'intriguing', 'storyline', 'maybe', 'bias', 'Aish', 'sneaking', 'thru', 'are', 'great', 'songs', 'here', 'have', '3', 'favorites', 'Yenna', 'Solla', 'Pogirai', 'What', 'Will', 'Answer', 'Be', 'Manohar', 'Ajith', 'pretty', 'cool', 'dance', 'steps', 'wooing', 'Sowmya', 'Kanjun', 'Meinakalei', 'Song', 'Mynah', 'Bird', 'first', 'song', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'Aish', 'optimistic', 'world-is-my-oyster', 'sensibilities', 'best', 'one', 'Kannamoochi', 'Yennada', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'dancing', 'most', 'ravishing', 'fact', 'Kannamoochi', 'Yennada', 'might', 'be', 'favorite', 'Aish', 'music', 'number', 'time', 'exquisite', 'choreagraphy', 'showstopper', 'way', 'Aish', 'moves', 'geez', 'literally', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'away', 'her.I', 'Have', 'Found', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'quite', 'short', 'Bollywood', 'standards', 'few', 'hours', 'will', 'pass', 'very', 'enjoyably', 'when', 'movie', 'over', 'will', 'sigh', 'romantic', 'viewer', 'are', 'ruefully', 'shrug', 'away', 'spell', 'was', 'cast', 'then', 'resignedly', 'go', 'back', 'reality', 'hopefully', 'taking', 'knowledge', 'are', 'movies', 'there', 'infinitely', 'better', 'Son', 'Mask']",I Have Found It

Then came Bride and Prejudice because I am a Jane Austen fan, which then made me want to see I Have Found It (Sense and Sensibility).  And boy did it find me.  At first I found it hard to keep up with the speed of the subtitles but once I got used to it I fell head over heels for this film.

870194,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B0006J280U,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[0, 0]","As most people buying this know this is an adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Sense & Sensibility'. It is a Tamal production from South India's 'Kollywood' industry. It is often described as Bollywood and in fact it is similar in its song and dance style, but 'Bollywood' is a blend of Bombay (now Mumbai) and Hollywood. I wont relate the story as Austen's is well known and it part of the fun spotting the parallels.I have owned this for a while but kept shifting it down the stack as it looked a bit more traditional and subdued and I prefer more staginess, modernity and power often. However, although it started looking more traditional, it became more and more modern and accessible and you stood very similar to current Bollywoods of the time.The music is by international award winning A.R. Rahman and raises it to higher standards too. What really stood out for me was the cinematography as it is beautifully framed. Some of the dance numbers are beautiful, sometimes fairly energetic and at other times unusual.The way they have taken the essence of the Austen story into a modern context of film-making, arranged marriages and a soldier dealing with feeling forgotten by those that sent him to war (where he came back partly disabled).Tabu and Aishwarya are very good as usual. Mammootty as the older caring male was also good though I didn't really believe the developing love Ash's character had for him. Ajith as the filmmaker was also very good but for us Abbas (as a corporate high-flying romantic interest who sells out for money instead of fulfilling his promise to marry) wasn't that charismatic and ended up being the weak point. Perhaps he doesn't cross cultures as well.If you love your Bollywoods try this Tamal one - though give it a little time to settle in as the pace and feel is just a little different to begin with.It rates well above average generally elsewhere on the Net.",4,Beautiful cinematography and more enjoyable than I expected,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,1897,"['most', 'people', 'buying', 'know', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', ""'Sense"", 'Sensibility', 'Tamal', 'production', 'South', 'India', ""'Kollywood"", 'industry', 'often', 'described', 'Bollywood', 'fact', 'similar', 'song', 'dance', 'style', ""'Bollywood"", 'blend', 'Bombay', 'now', 'Mumbai', 'Hollywood', 'wont', 'relate', 'story', 'Austen', 'well', 'known', 'part', 'fun', 'spotting', 'parallels.I', 'have', 'owned', 'while', 'kept', 'shifting', 'down', 'stack', 'looked', 'bit', 'more', 'traditional', 'subdued', 'prefer', 'more', 'staginess', 'modernity', 'power', 'often', 'However', 'started', 'looking', 'more', 'traditional', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'modern', 'accessible', 'stood', 'very', 'similar', 'current', 'Bollywoods', 'time.The', 'music', 'international', 'award', 'winning', 'A.R', 'Rahman', 'higher', 'standards', 'too', 'What', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'cinematography', 'beautifully', 'framed', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'beautiful', 'sometimes', 'fairly', 'energetic', 'other', 'times', 'unusual.The', 'way', 'have', 'taken', 'essence', 'Austen', 'story', 'modern', 'context', 'film-making', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'soldier', 'dealing', 'feeling', 'forgotten', 'sent', 'war', 'where', 'came', 'back', 'partly', 'disabled', '.Tabu', 'Aishwarya', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'usual', 'Mammootty', 'older', 'caring', 'male', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'developing', 'love', 'Ash', 'character', 'had', 'Ajith', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Abbas', 'corporate', 'high-flying', 'romantic', 'interest', 'who', 'out', 'money', 'instead', 'fulfilling', 'promise', 'marry', 'was', ""n't"", 'charismatic', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'weak', 'point', 'Perhaps', ""n't"", 'cross', 'cultures', 'well.If', 'love', 'Bollywoods', 'try', 'Tamal', 'one', 'give', 'little', 'time', 'settle', 'pace', 'feel', 'just', 'little', 'different', 'begin', 'with.It', 'rates', 'well', 'average', 'generally', 'elsewhere', 'Net']",I Have Found It
870195,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B0006J280U,Mir,"[8, 10]","I rented this film a couple months ago through Netflix. The horrible lack of coordination between subtitles and the spoken voices was jarring. It actually RUINED what was a very nice flick. Imagine that you're reading subtitles that have a lag of 90 seconds or more, so that you're reading dialogue with the wrong person, or maybe the wrong SCENE. Very headache-inducing.Now, I don't know if this is a new edition, with better subtitles. I hope so, because this film deserves quality translation. The story--based on Sense and Sensibility, my favorite English language film, directed by Ang Lee--follows the romantic and financial difficulties of two sisters. I agree with the previous reviewer that the actor who plays the older suitor of the lovely Aish does a great job. I rooted so much for him (the Indian version of Col. Brandon). I wanted more of the film to focus on him and Aish. Ah, well.I enjoy Bollywood cinema. Like any nation's film industry, not everything is great, and a lot is just plain bad to mediocre. (If you don't believe me, rent a compilation of Bollywood music numbers from assorted films--you can rent these from Netflix if you dare not buy them from amazon without test driving-- and see how many of them really reek in terms of choreography, costumes and performance).This one is among the better Bollywood offerings I've seen. If you wish to compare my taste, I also loved (and excuse any misspellings as I try to recall foreign words) TAAL, VEER ZAARA, LAGAAN, HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM, and to a lesser extent MOHABBATEIN and DEVDAS (visually stunning film, musically enjoyable, with a maginificently ""watchable"" Aishwarya and a terrific Madhuri Dixit, a great number featuring both beautiful women,  but the weak spot was Shahrukh, who was just not very good in this. I hated his creepy character and the seriously annoying overacting. Shahrukh has screen presence, and he's featured much better in DEVDAS, while still prone to a lot of weepy overacting, but in that context, much more heroic. He's also quite likable in MOHABBATEIN.)If they fixed the subtitle problems on this DVD, then I recommend this wholeheartedly.Mir",4,"Touching film, and I hope this one's subtitles are synched",1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2153,"['rented', 'film', 'couple', 'months', 'Netflix', 'horrible', 'lack', 'coordination', 'subtitles', 'spoken', 'voices', 'was', 'jarring', 'actually', 'RUINED', 'what', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'flick', 'Imagine', ""'re"", 'reading', 'subtitles', 'have', 'lag', '90', 'seconds', 'more', ""'re"", 'reading', 'dialogue', 'wrong', 'person', 'maybe', 'wrong', 'SCENE', 'Very', 'headache-inducing.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'new', 'edition', 'better', 'subtitles', 'hope', 'so', 'film', 'quality', 'translation', 'story', 'based', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'favorite', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'directed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'romantic', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'two', 'sisters', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'actor', 'who', 'older', 'suitor', 'lovely', 'Aish', 'great', 'job', 'rooted', 'so', 'much', 'Indian', 'version', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'wanted', 'more', 'film', 'focus', 'Aish', 'Ah', 'well.I', 'enjoy', 'Bollywood', 'cinema', 'nation', 'film', 'industry', 'not', 'everything', 'great', 'lot', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'mediocre', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'rent', 'compilation', 'Bollywood', 'music', 'numbers', 'assorted', 'films', 'can', 'rent', 'Netflix', 'dare', 'not', 'buy', 'amazon', 'test', 'driving', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'really', 'reek', 'terms', 'choreography', 'costumes', 'performance', '.This', 'one', 'better', 'Bollywood', 'offerings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'wish', 'compare', 'taste', 'also', 'loved', 'excuse', 'misspellings', 'try', 'recall', 'foreign', 'words', 'TAAL', 'VEER', 'ZAARA', 'LAGAAN', 'HUM', 'DIL', 'DE', 'CHUKE', 'SANAM', 'lesser', 'extent', 'MOHABBATEIN', 'DEVDAS', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'musically', 'enjoyable', 'maginificently', 'watchable', 'Aishwarya', 'terrific', 'Madhuri', 'Dixit', 'great', 'number', 'featuring', 'beautiful', 'women', 'weak', 'spot', 'was', 'Shahrukh', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'hated', 'creepy', 'character', 'seriously', 'annoying', 'overacting', 'Shahrukh', 'screen', 'presence', 'featured', 'much', 'better', 'DEVDAS', 'still', 'lot', 'weepy', 'overacting', 'context', 'much', 'more', 'heroic', 'also', 'quite', 'likable', 'MOHABBATEIN', 'fixed', 'subtitle', 'problems', 'DVD', 'then', 'recommend', 'wholeheartedly.Mir']",I Have Found It
