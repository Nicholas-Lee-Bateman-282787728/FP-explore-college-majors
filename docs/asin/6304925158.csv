I love the sweet and tender interactions he has with his grandparents, and his innocence and loyalty to his family. This really provides a fair picture into what inter-race relations were probably like in this part of Tennessee during this time period. The only thing I really didn't like is how the movie seems to glorify and even encourage alcohol boot-legging. This is a great movie otherwise that is sympathetic to Native situations and inter-race relations in the U.S. during this time.",3,Sweet story,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,627,"['sweet', 'story', 'coming', 'age', 'little', 'boy', 'few', 'months', 'grandparents', 'mother', 'love', 'sweet', 'tender', 'interactions', 'grandparents', 'innocence', 'loyalty', 'family', 'really', 'fair', 'picture', 'what', 'inter-race', 'relations', 'were', 'probably', 'part', 'Tennessee', 'time', 'period', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'movie', 'glorify', 'even', 'encourage', 'alcohol', 'boot-legging', 'great', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'sympathetic', 'Native', 'situations', 'inter-race', 'relations', 'U.S.', 'time']",The Education of Little Tree VHS

DiLiddo Jr. ""Big_Man_Big_Heart_Fine...","[1, 1]","""You just gotta learn as you go [along]"" says Grandpa to Little Tree after the little Indian boy makes a mistake of buying a diseased calf with his hard earned 50 cents.  Grandpa doesn't chastise the boy, he just loves him.  The movie made me miss my grandparents but more importantly, the spirituality of ""The WAY"" and ""The understanding""  (death and movement to the afterlife) really powerfully portrays Indian spirituality.  I loved that.  Its quite a contrast to the old style Indian movies where they were portrayed as savages (up until ""Dances with Wolves""). Praying to the Dog Star and having your prayer answered may seem over the top to some, but, this small boy, abused in solitary confinement by ""Christians"",is a poignant commentary on the hypocrisy of crimes made in the name of Jesus Christ.After Little Tree is ripped off by paying a Christian Man his only money for a calf with a diseased liver, Little Tree's lesson learned: ""I'll never trade again with a man who calls hisself a Christian"".  The ""education"" of Little Tree is not all book learning, although there is some of that.  He picks up cussing from his Grandpa but is chided gently and lovingly against the habit.  Have you ever been to the mountains in Tennessee???  You can still get moonshine in the Appalachian hollers there and in North Carolina too.  Soooo, I don't view the moonshine segment of the movie that detrimentally, even for children, because its fairly historically accurate.  Children could even enjoy the scene of Little Tree escaping from the ""revenuers"" (government agents) with his dog, Blue.Bigotry is also reflected in a little blond white girl who befriends Little Tree.  They see each other periodically and like children of that age, cement their friendship by trading/exchanging little items they treasure.  The scene of Little Tree seeing his friend for the last time before being shipped off and gifting her with a pair of moccasins made from the hide of his dead calf, is a powerful scene -  A good teaching moment for children who may be watching this movie with their parents.

439865,A6IKQOVUT6AI4,6304925158,Bonita L. Davis,"[7, 7]","Nineteen hundred and thirty-five was a pivotal year for the eight year old  boy called Little Tree. It was the time when his mountain grandfather and  Cherokee grandmother came to retrieve him from a relative determined to  break his spirit. These two remarkable people take their grandson into the  mountains where his real education begins. Reminising about that time, the  adult Little Tree's voice shares with us his story, his heritage and his  determination to be the person that he is regardless of the hardships which  come.Listen to his story as we're taken into the Smokey Mountains  of Tennesee where some Cherokees were fortunate to hide after being on the  Trail of Tears. Hear Willow John's tale of his people that he passes down  to Little Tree. In sharing the Cherokee story, Willow John insures that his  people will never die. For their story lives in their young people who will  carry it to their children.The scenery of the Smoky mountains is  fantastic. You get to know the mountain people during the depression. See  grandfather make the best corn whisky in the area as he tries to hide from  the revenuers. Feel the compassion that a young boy has for a little girl  only to have the prejudice of her father stand in their way.Learn  the painful lesson of Native American children torn from their families,  sent to a boarding school, stripped of their names and language and forced  to suffer indignities which no child should suffer. Those sordid parts of  American history makes you want to cry in sadness and anger. Little Tree is  able to endure even at his young age due to those life's experiences and  lessons taught to him from his grandparents. These lessons are not found in  a book but are read from the heart.This is an excellent movie that  deals with identity, loss of innocence, prejudice, poverty and bureaucratic  insensitivity. Through it all a young boy's spirit stays vibrant as ever.  Sentimentality won't be found here. Love, dignity and pride are what  endures.

Grandpa is played to perfection. Grandma feels a bit too young, she must be played by a younger actress dressed and made up to look older. Willow John is simply fantastic.Great cast, lovely setting, heart warming message, calm slow deliberate editing, and decent production - what is not to like about this film. The one tiny chink in the armour is that the story has been told a few times. And there's a sense that we should be in awe about nature and the education. It's a tiny nit to pick, in an otherwise really good movie.The story is pretty simple. It will make you cry. The director has managed to make the viewer care that much about his characters. But you will also feel wonderful at the very end. And maybe, you'll look up at the Dog Star and think of people that have passed away or that you are separated from.Yes, I cried about 5 times. Would I watch this movie again, yes. My family disappered after the first half hour, but they were in the mood for some silly comedy. A beautiful small film.The film is PG, I think the MPAA warning at the beginning said - old fashioned discipline. The boy is 11 in the film. Everything that happens is appropriate for anyone that age to see. There is a moment where a father takes his belt to his daughter. And there's a bit of strong language here and there. But it's a grandpa teaching his grandson the ways of the world.

To my surprise, this DVD was totally absorbing: the beauty of the countryside and the even-handed portrayal of story and characters.I actually liked the way the child got  involved in the moonshining action, showing  how it's hard to define activities as ""good"" or ""bad."" Many citizens believe the moonshine laws did more harm than good, like the war on drugs today.I also liked the way the movie gave us an ending that was satisfying but not sugary. Bad things happen. The child was learning to differentiate between nature's cruelty and invented human cruelty.And I don't think the whites were stereotyped as bad. The grandfather and his fellow moonshiners were a great bunch. The church scene was a little extreme but offered some much-needed comic relief.Why four stars and not five? After watching the video, I learned the author's story, and I felt a little cheated.

439869,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6304925158,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE EDUCATION OF LITTLE TREE (Writ. for screen/Dir. Richard Friedenberg, 1997, Canadian release, U.S. premiere screening January, 1998, 112 minutes) ~Based on the novel, this movie actually fails utterly in its promise and title. Little Tree (Joseph Ashton) learns next to nothing except, from his grandpa (James Cromwell) how to prepare moonshine, hide from ""revenuers"", and most importantly he first hears about how his people (Cherokee) wound up in the Smokey Mountains in Tennessee, where this takes place.The latter is explained to him by a Cherokee wise man, Willow James (Graham Greene who is a Canadian Oneida). Tantoo Cardinal (born Rose Marie Cardinal, a/k/a Tantoo Martin, who is a Canadian ""M&eacute;tis"" Manitoba Cree) brings a powerful performance to this film as Little Tree's grandma.(I must make a sidebar for those interested in the subject: as to Canadian actress Tantoo Cardinal, a beloved Native fixture in film, she identifies as a ""m&eacute;tis,"" the French equivalent of the Spanish term ""mestizo"" ... indicating a 'half-and-half' individual. In the case of the Canadian m&eacute;tis, it indicates a person whose heritages are of Algonquian or Cree and Celtic or French. Usually just the term ""m&eacute;tis"" is used. So, for this accurate record, I will say Cardinal is properly called M&eacute;tis-Cree and French.)This, then, is the story of the departure of Little Tree's parents which leaves him in the custody of his grandparents. While his grandmother is not even mentioned by others in the film, his half-Scots, half-Indian grandfather is held in some contempt for being ""a white 'mountain' Indian"". Since his grandfather has accepted Cherokee ways, it is accurate to say Little Tree is now in the care of good Cherokee parents. They even go to church--if just for show. They even have Willow James attending with them.So now we know that this film utterly disappoints in its promise, let's look at what it tells us: we learn very little about the famous Cherokee ""Trail of Tears"" (I learned one thing: I had no idea the ""tears"" were those of the whites who witnessed the march). This piece of dialogue is one of Graham Greene's finest screen moments in one of his best performances--you can't miss it, and you must not miss it.We learn Little Tree is already very wise and ready to learn what it is to be Cherokee. Since the film hints at the Cherokee's belief in reincarnation (I'm no expert on the subject, I just said the film suggests this) it is obvious Little Tree is some sort of very special incarnation. The remainder of the film is relatively blah, and I mean BLAH. The short time Little Tree is forced into one of those horrendous ""Indian schools"" is quite sanitized--and lasts only a short period before his grandpa springs him from the school.So I learned about how certain Indian tribes did in fact end up forced into some sort of shared community among whites--like in the Smokies. I learned about the Trail of Tears in a special way (they did not abandon their dead, they carried them all the way, for example). I learned a bit about the life up in the mountainous backwoods, a special interest of mine. Also, I learned how the Canadians can really louse up a film if you let them.This was a film I had wanted to see for decades. I got the chance to watch snippets of it about 9 years ago--I just watched the whole thing last night and was shocked it was on a cable movie channel at all. But I got to see it, finally. As accurately as I can tell, I was about 60% gladdened and 40% disappointed, but those percentages could change as I think on this film, and as I watch it once or twice more.I can never resist Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal or James Cromwell.This is well worth watching, warts-and-all. (Did I mention all the careless anachronisms in this?) It is almost completely a good family film (there is an unfortunate but hilarious instance of pretty severe swearing, but that was atoned for when Grandma had to yank off her skirts to catch a quail, which was a kind of dramedy you rarely see done so well).",4,... and the education of the viewer too!,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,4064,"['EDUCATION', 'OF', 'LITTLE', 'TREE', 'Writ', 'screen/Dir', 'Richard', 'Friedenberg', '1997', 'Canadian', 'release', 'U.S.', 'premiere', 'screening', 'January', '1998', '112', 'minutes', '~Based', 'novel', 'movie', 'actually', 'utterly', 'promise', 'title', 'Little', 'Tree', 'Joseph', 'Ashton', 'next', 'nothing', 'grandpa', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'how', 'prepare', 'moonshine', 'hide', 'revenuers', 'most', 'importantly', 'first', 'how', 'people', 'Cherokee', 'wound', 'up', 'Smokey', 'Mountains', 'Tennessee', 'where', 'place.The', 'latter', 'explained', 'Cherokee', 'wise', 'man', 'Willow', 'James', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'who', 'Canadian', 'Oneida', 'Tantoo', 'Cardinal', 'born', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'Cardinal', 'a/k/a', 'Tantoo', 'Martin', 'who', 'Canadian', 'M', 'eacute', 'tis', 'Manitoba', 'Cree', 'powerful', 'performance', 'film', 'Little', 'Tree', 'grandma', 'must', 'make', 'sidebar', 'interested', 'subject', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'Tantoo', 'Cardinal', 'beloved', 'Native', 'fixture', 'film', 'm', 'eacute', 'tis', 'French', 'equivalent', 'Spanish', 'term', 'mestizo', 'indicating', ""'half-and-half"", 'individual', 'case', 'Canadian', 'm', 'eacute', 'tis', 'person', 'heritages', 'are', 'Algonquian', 'Cree', 'Celtic', 'French', 'Usually', 'just', 'term', 'm', 'eacute', 'tis', 'used', 'So', 'accurate', 'record', 'will', 'say', 'Cardinal', 'properly', 'called', 'M', 'eacute', 'tis-Cree', 'French', 'then', 'story', 'departure', 'Little', 'Tree', 'parents', 'custody', 'grandparents', 'grandmother', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'others', 'film', 'half-Scots', 'half-Indian', 'grandfather', 'held', 'contempt', 'being', 'white', ""'mountain"", 'Indian', 'grandfather', 'accepted', 'Cherokee', 'ways', 'accurate', 'say', 'Little', 'Tree', 'now', 'care', 'good', 'Cherokee', 'parents', 'even', 'go', 'church', 'just', 'show', 'even', 'have', 'Willow', 'James', 'attending', 'them.So', 'now', 'know', 'film', 'utterly', 'disappoints', 'promise', 'let', 'look', 'what', 'learn', 'very', 'little', 'famous', 'Cherokee', 'Trail', 'Tears', 'learned', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'idea', 'tears', 'were', 'whites', 'who', 'witnessed', 'march', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'one', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'finest', 'screen', 'moments', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'must', 'not', 'miss', 'it.We', 'learn', 'Little', 'Tree', 'already', 'very', 'wise', 'ready', 'learn', 'what', 'be', 'Cherokee', 'film', 'hints', 'Cherokee', 'belief', 'reincarnation', ""'m"", 'expert', 'subject', 'just', 'said', 'film', 'obvious', 'Little', 'Tree', 'sort', 'very', 'special', 'incarnation', 'remainder', 'film', 'relatively', 'blah', 'mean', 'BLAH', 'short', 'time', 'Little', 'Tree', 'forced', 'one', 'horrendous', 'Indian', 'schools', 'quite', 'sanitized', 'only', 'short', 'period', 'grandpa', 'springs', 'school.So', 'learned', 'how', 'certain', 'Indian', 'tribes', 'did', 'fact', 'end', 'up', 'forced', 'sort', 'shared', 'community', 'whites', 'Smokies', 'learned', 'Trail', 'Tears', 'special', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'abandon', 'dead', 'carried', 'way', 'example', 'learned', 'bit', 'life', 'up', 'mountainous', 'backwoods', 'special', 'interest', 'mine', 'Also', 'learned', 'how', 'Canadians', 'can', 'really', 'louse', 'up', 'film', 'let', 'them.This', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'wanted', 'see', 'decades', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'snippets', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'shocked', 'was', 'cable', 'movie', 'channel', 'got', 'see', 'finally', 'As', 'accurately', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'about', '60', '%', 'gladdened', '40', '%', 'disappointed', 'percentages', 'could', 'change', 'think', 'film', 'watch', 'once', 'twice', 'more.I', 'can', 'never', 'resist', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Tantoo', 'Cardinal', 'James', 'Cromwell.This', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'warts-and-all', 'Did', 'mention', 'careless', 'anachronisms', 'almost', 'completely', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'hilarious', 'instance', 'pretty', 'severe', 'swearing', 'was', 'atoned', 'when', 'Grandma', 'had', 'yank', 'off', 'skirts', 'catch', 'quail', 'was', 'kind', 'dramedy', 'rarely', 'see', 'done', 'so', 'well']",The Education of Little Tree VHS
439870,A28UYQIEYS5N0F,6304925158,"Greenknight01 ""Greenknight01@hotmail.com""","[1, 1]","This is a wonderful heartwarming film. It is written by a man who was George Wallace's speech writer named Asa Carter, aka Forrest Carter. Mr. Carter was in the KKK and participated in attacks on Black American People. Dispite this it tells a great story of people forgotten in time. It celebrates the Cherokee plight and remnant of their ways. It is in this ironic fact that he chose to persecute the Black Americans around him well writing this uplifting story of the American Indians and poor whites. I love this story for I have roots in N.C.and S.C. and can identify with the people within. (Such independent but poor and proud people be they black, red or white are now vilified and dehumanized. The Mainsteam Media are partners in Fabian Socialist-Communitarian drive to reshape our country and distroy the instutions of the republic. Such people refuse to be dependent on the dole and thus must be marginalized...) The story also celebrates the reality of life.

The setting was effective and the theme appropriate.A little boy who is part Cherokee is taken away by his full-blood grandmother and his white, but Cherokee-by-choice, grandfather. They love him with all their hearts and they teach him who he is and where he comes from. He finds love and security and happiness. They are poor, and Little Tree encounters some prejudice, but he also learns quickly that this prejudice has nothing to do with how we are inside. He learns compassion. He learns about death.Then the authorities get in the way and carry Little Tree off to ""Indian School."" There he is institutionalized, his head is shaved and he is ""disinfected."" He is also stripped of his Indian identity, but among the other Indian kids in the school he quickly finds it again. He is vigorously punished for telling the truth about nature in class.Then magic happens. The deus ex machina enters the movie and he is swept back into his Indian life in the hills with his loving grandparents. A better ending would have been that he overcomes the horrors of life in ""Indian School"" and grows up to be a strong man because of the awesome values his grandparents taught him, but that ending wasn't used.This is a great movie for kids who'd like to know about this subject more.

439880,A2C1GJPAMJAA1N,6304925158,"Nico1908 ""NTF""","[1, 6]","I'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography. Otherwise, it teems mostly with clich&eacute;s and stereotypes: mountain folks are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious and/or ragged racist kind, or wise white Indians. Indians are deeply spiritual, almost magical people who move silently, disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read minds over large distances. And so on and so forth.Throughout the movie I kept wondering what the point of the film was (other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains, log cabins, woods, an assortment of animals, free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church).The plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth. This was neither a story about growing up during the depression era, nor about life in the Apalachians; neither about about being an orphan, nor about a struggle for identity; neither about friendship (of course Little Tree's little girlfriend had to be blond and barefoot and have an abusive father), nor about relationships. It tried to be all of those things and more, and that made it superficial and unsatisfactory.Although the movie was supposed to be about Little Tree's education, we learn almost nothing about this education. He was given a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; tried his hand at chopping wood (at which he failed) and whiskey running (literally); learned how to read (and maybe to write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary (bound in aardvark skin, I suppose) - and that was it. Of course he didn't learn anything during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic.However, grandma, grandpa, and Graham Greene's character made sure that Little Tree turned into a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - after, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""riding with the Navajos"" and ""getting caught up in a couple of wars"" - was to ""catch up"" with grandma and grandpa and Graham Greene's character in heaven (instead of, say, dating girls, getting married, having children or other such nonsense).Last but not least, I must say that I found grandpa's trade offensive. Why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still?

I winced when Graham Greene first came on screen dressed like what Hollywood thinks an Indian should look like, he being quiet and so attuned to the ""spirits"" he could barely speak. I hated that the director chose to ""tell"" of the Trails of Tears instead of ""showing"" it to us via flashbacks. In fact I zoned out during this 5 minute disseration and never heard the end.Little Tree is 8 years old in this story, talks with the wisdom of a 50 year old. Yuk! I HATE that! He speaks in phrases that belong in a Hallmark sympathy card.James Cromwell did less than phone in his performance with acting so bad I was squirming.

We just needed some good ol' banjo music, but we got the fiddle player instead.The director whose name I have thankfully forgotten shamelessly stole cinematic scenes from Legends of the Fall, The Yearling (the death of grandpa vs Penny Baxter's ill with snakebite bedscene, both identically composed and lit) and probably A River Runs Through It. I don't know if this director's still making movies, but we can only pray he isn't. Truthfully I don't believe this story would have translated well to the screen, some just can't make the leap, but in the hands of Robert Redford, who is a true cinematic artist, I think he could have truly improved upon the book as he did with the exquisite Horse Whisperer.The scene when Grandpa comes to save Little Tree at the school and stabs the knife into the ground by the gate is so heavy handed I laughed.
