994389,A178KV00J5LEKS,B000FS2VUY,"Blindguy07 ""Bob""","[5, 11]","So looks like the guys at Funi are going to release 14 episodes from season four in a two dvd special edition.  Looks like we get the following, and if you don't believe me, go to the Tmnt website for hard evidence.  Here's what to expect acording to the press release from Funi.Episodes include Still Nobody, The ancient One, Cyon of the Shredder, Prodigal Son, Outbreak, Trouble with Augie, Tale of Master Yoshi, Return of Savanti parts 1 and 2, Adventures in Turtle-sitting, Good Geens parts 1 and 2, and as for that 14th episode, could be Ninja Tribunal or Insane in the Membrane.  Maybe they'll go ahead with Insane, and just include the Tribunal episode in its own 14 episode release, if this one sells good, that is.  I don't see why they couldn't up the ep content to 15 and just go ahead and give us both.  But check the tmnt website for that press release if you're interested.  And looks like the price is pretty low too.  An excelent buy.  But your guess on that 14th ep is as good as mine, folks.  Maybe as the sept 12 release date draws nearer, someone can confirm the last episode we're getting.  Oh and I forgot Samurai Tourists.Maybe they'll go ahead and give us Insane in the Membrane because it fits better in the story arc from season four.  And hopefully, we'll get Ninja Tribunal plus the 13 episodes that complete that arc at a later date.  Maybe by Christmas?  I hope so, anyway.And do I really need to give a plot synopsis of the latter part of season four?  Well, I think I will anyway.  But if you're lookin for spoilers, you won't find them here.Leonardo is still filled with anger due to his defeat at the hands of Shredder and Karai last season.  And after a few adventures in which he nearly loses control, Splinter sends him to Japan to find himself with the help of Yoshi's old master, the ancient one.  But while Leo is gone, a new Shredder suddenly attacks the turtles, and Leo must return home and do battle with this new foe.  Well, maybe not a new foe, but a foe with an attitude ajustment though.Also in this portion of the season, slime from agent Bishop's alien creations which has seaped down into the sewers(see Aliens among us from Vol. 3.7: Hun on the Run) has mutated several animals near the turtles' home.  Its up to them to end this outbreak, but one of them is infected by one of the creatures, causing him to experience a second mutation into a mindless beast.  Now the turtles must make a deal with the devil, so to speak, in order to have their brother restored.  Agent Bishop SAYS he has a cure.  But in order for Bishop to administer it, our heros must steal a valuable object for him.  They must invade the stronghold of the new Shredder and steal the Heart of Tengu, but there are darker forces at work here.  Even Bishop doesn't comprehend the evil that will soon be unleashed upon the world.So save up your cash and get ready for this interesting dvd release in September!",5,"Finally, a 14 episode set from Funimation!",1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,2931,"['So', 'guys', 'Funi', 'are', 'going', 'release', '14', 'episodes', 'season', 'four', 'two', 'dvd', 'special', 'edition', 'get', 'following', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'go', 'Tmnt', 'website', 'hard', 'evidence', 'Here', 'what', 'expect', 'acording', 'press', 'release', 'Funi.Episodes', 'include', 'Still', 'Nobody', 'ancient', 'One', 'Cyon', 'Shredder', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'Outbreak', 'Trouble', 'Augie', 'Tale', 'Master', 'Yoshi', 'Return', 'Savanti', 'parts', '1', '2', 'Adventures', 'Turtle-sitting', 'Good', 'Geens', 'parts', '1', '2', '14th', 'episode', 'could', 'be', 'Ninja', 'Tribunal', 'Insane', 'Membrane', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'go', 'ahead', 'Insane', 'just', 'include', 'Tribunal', 'episode', 'own', '14', 'episode', 'release', 'one', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'up', 'ep', 'content', '15', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'give', 'check', 'tmnt', 'website', 'press', 'release', ""'re"", 'interested', 'price', 'pretty', 'low', 'too', 'excelent', 'buy', 'guess', '14th', 'ep', 'as', 'good', 'mine', 'folks', 'Maybe', 'sept', '12', 'release', 'date', 'draws', 'nearer', 'someone', 'can', 'confirm', 'last', 'episode', ""'re"", 'getting', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'Samurai', 'Tourists.Maybe', ""'ll"", 'go', 'ahead', 'give', 'Insane', 'Membrane', 'better', 'story', 'arc', 'season', 'four', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Ninja', 'Tribunal', '13', 'episodes', 'complete', 'arc', 'later', 'date', 'Maybe', 'Christmas', 'hope', 'so', 'anyway.And', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'give', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'latter', 'part', 'season', 'four', 'Well', 'think', 'will', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'lookin', 'spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'still', 'filled', 'anger', 'due', 'defeat', 'hands', 'Shredder', 'Karai', 'last', 'season', 'few', 'adventures', 'nearly', 'control', 'Splinter', 'Japan', 'find', 'help', 'Yoshi', 'old', 'master', 'ancient', 'one', 'Leo', 'gone', 'new', 'Shredder', 'suddenly', 'turtles', 'Leo', 'must', 'return', 'home', 'do', 'battle', 'new', 'foe', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'new', 'foe', 'foe', 'attitude', 'ajustment', 'though.Also', 'portion', 'season', 'slime', 'agent', 'Bishop', 'alien', 'creations', 'seaped', 'down', 'sewers', 'see', 'Aliens', 'Vol', '3.7', 'Hun', 'Run', 'mutated', 'several', 'animals', 'turtles', 'home', 'end', 'outbreak', 'one', 'infected', 'one', 'creatures', 'causing', 'experience', 'second', 'mutation', 'mindless', 'beast', 'Now', 'turtles', 'must', 'make', 'deal', 'devil', 'so', 'speak', 'order', 'have', 'brother', 'restored', 'Agent', 'Bishop', 'SAYS', 'cure', 'order', 'Bishop', 'administer', 'heros', 'must', 'steal', 'valuable', 'object', 'must', 'invade', 'stronghold', 'new', 'Shredder', 'steal', 'Heart', 'Tengu', 'are', 'darker', 'forces', 'work', 'here', 'Even', 'Bishop', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'evil', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'unleashed', 'world.So', 'save', 'up', 'cash', 'get', 'ready', 'interesting', 'dvd', 'release', 'September']",N/A

I also like the fact they are bringing back the old 'original series' available to own on DVD. I had trouble finding some of the other seasons, but I was able to purchase this one. The episodes are very good quality and it was nice to be able to watch the old show again after all these years and relive it. Yet I was kind of disappointed in how the DVD set was. It was basically a box with a unique box, and the DVD was a cover and then 5 DVD's inside. There was no list of Episodes, no special features, really nothing but the episodes.

994399,AT1GMH2UHYROT,B000FS2VUY,Lee DeWald,"[42, 45]","On September 8, 1990, the show began its first run on CBS.  This was the fourth season of the wildly popular ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" animated cartoon.  The first three seasons had been (and continued to be) shown in syndication on the USA network, and also (for a short while, anyway) on the FOX network.  When the cartoon began airing on CBS, it aired two episodes back-to-back, with ""Turtle Tips"" in between, animated shorts advising viewers young and old on environmental issues, such as not running too much water or wasting too much electricity.Season Four of the series took the show to new heights, as new characters were introduced, familiar characters were given increased depth, and our Heroes in a Halfshell continued to sky-rocket in popularity.  From 1989-1992, the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" was one of the hottest cartoons on the planet, airing on Saturday mornings after a full hour of ""Garfield and Friends,"" another terrific cartoon based on the comics of Jim Davis.For me personally, Seasons Three and Four of this wonderful cartoon are my favorite.  For them to finally -- FINALLY! -- be released on DVD has been a long time coming.  And I could not be more thrilled that Season Four in its entirety is going to be released in one fell swoop, instead of being churned out disk by disk every spring and fall.  Any seasons released after this, in my opinion, will just be icing on the cake.  All I've wanted since the invention of DVD was to have Seasons Three and Four make it to this format, and it FINALLY HAPPENED!I don't know if the ""Turtle Tips"" will ever see the light of day as far as bonus features go.  There were only about ten of them, if I remember correctly, and they just kept getting recycled through all the seasons that aired on CBS.I know a lot of people like the darker, grittier versions of the Turtles, but I much prefer the goofier, kid-friendly versions that this cartoon consists of.  Season Four, especially, really emphasizes this fact, as some of the funniest episodes in the series are included.  All of the principle characters have their moments to shine comedically, but Shredder and Krang, in particular, have some really funny moments all throughout this season, something that was sorely lacking when the show changed tone dramatically in its waning years.March 13, 2007, cannot get here fast enough.  I can't wait to see all my old friends again: Donatello, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Raphael, and Splinter.  I'm even anxious to see Shredder bicker with his live-in wife, alien warlord Krang, and his two bumbling mutants, Bebop and Rocksteady.",5,Season Four of TMNT on DVD,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,2607,"['September', '8', '1990', 'show', 'began', 'first', 'run', 'CBS', 'was', 'fourth', 'season', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'had', 'been', 'continued', 'be', 'shown', 'syndication', 'USA', 'network', 'also', 'short', 'while', 'anyway', 'FOX', 'network', 'When', 'cartoon', 'began', 'airing', 'CBS', 'aired', 'two', 'episodes', 'back-to-back', 'Turtle', 'Tips', 'animated', 'shorts', 'advising', 'viewers', 'young', 'old', 'environmental', 'issues', 'such', 'not', 'running', 'too', 'much', 'water', 'wasting', 'too', 'much', 'Four', 'series', 'took', 'show', 'new', 'heights', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'familiar', 'characters', 'were', 'given', 'increased', 'depth', 'Heroes', 'Halfshell', 'continued', 'sky-rocket', 'popularity', '1989-1992', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'was', 'one', 'hottest', 'cartoons', 'planet', 'airing', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'full', 'hour', 'Garfield', 'Friends', 'terrific', 'cartoon', 'based', 'comics', 'Jim', 'Davis.For', 'personally', 'Seasons', 'Three', 'Four', 'wonderful', 'cartoon', 'are', 'favorite', 'finally', 'FINALLY', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'thrilled', 'Season', 'Four', 'entirety', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'instead', 'being', 'churned', 'out', 'disk', 'disk', 'spring', 'fall', 'Any', 'seasons', 'released', 'opinion', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'icing', 'cake', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'invention', 'DVD', 'was', 'have', 'Seasons', 'Three', 'Four', 'make', 'format', 'FINALLY', 'HAPPENED', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Turtle', 'Tips', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'as', 'far', 'bonus', 'features', 'go', 'were', 'only', 'about', 'ten', 'remember', 'correctly', 'just', 'kept', 'getting', 'recycled', 'seasons', 'aired', 'CBS.I', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'darker', 'grittier', 'versions', 'Turtles', 'much', 'prefer', 'goofier', 'kid-friendly', 'versions', 'cartoon', 'Season', 'Four', 'especially', 'really', 'fact', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'included', 'principle', 'characters', 'have', 'moments', 'shine', 'comedically', 'Shredder', 'Krang', 'particular', 'have', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'season', 'something', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'when', 'show', 'changed', 'tone', 'dramatically', 'waning', 'years.March', '13', '2007', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'here', 'fast', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'old', 'friends', 'again', 'Donatello', 'Leonardo', 'Michaelangelo', 'Raphael', 'Splinter', ""'m"", 'even', 'anxious', 'see', 'Shredder', 'bicker', 'live-in', 'wife', 'alien', 'warlord', 'Krang', 'two', 'bumbling', 'mutants', 'Bebop', 'Rocksteady']",N/A

While this is the first season I'm confused is that if the European Vacation episodes were amongst this season why are they not included in this season set of the show?  This season set contains 40 episodes of the original series, which is by far more than what they were able to do with just the volume sets that they were doing prior to this release of the show.  Only if they would've took the time to re-release the first three seasons in sets instead of leaving them in volumes like they are.  With this season set they were able to get a couple bonus stuff into the set unlike what they were able to do with trying to do those one disc sets.  Also a couple episodes missing from this set that makes this set a little hard to get while at the same time get it for the episodes.  Overall with this being a better release than what was given before, I give this set 3.5 star out of 5.",3,Finally a boxset of the original TMNT show,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,991,"['Finally', 'original', 'series', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'season', 'set', 'so', 'much', 'deserved', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'confused', 'European', 'Vacation', 'episodes', 'were', 'amongst', 'season', 'why', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'season', 'set', 'show', 'season', 'set', '40', 'episodes', 'original', 'series', 'far', 'more', 'what', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'just', 'volume', 'were', 'doing', 'prior', 'release', 'show', 'Only', 'would', ""'ve"", 'took', 'time', 're-release', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'sets', 'instead', 'leaving', 'volumes', 'are', 'season', 'set', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'couple', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'set', 'what', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'trying', 'do', 'one', 'disc', 'sets', 'Also', 'couple', 'missing', 'set', 'set', 'little', 'hard', 'get', 'same', 'time', 'get', 'episodes', 'Overall', 'being', 'better', 'release', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'give', 'set', '3.5', 'star', '5']",N/A
994404,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000FS2VUY,Simon,"[25, 27]","Though billed as a ""season 4"" set, these 2-discs only contain 14 of the 26 episodes produced for season 4. If you check various dvd listings, you'll realize that these are the 14 episodes that have not been included on dvd. If you want the other episodes of season 4, you'll have to get the single discs. Sneaky, huh?Whatever. There are lots of great things about this set. First of all it's FOURTEEN episodes for the same price you've been paying for all the other discs. So it's more than double the ""Hun on the Run"" disc, and 4x some of the early releases. Maybe 4Kids is being generous...or maybe it's just burning off the ""old"" episodes as the series makes the leap to the Fast Forward revamp. Your call.Second, these are the better episodes from season 4. The first half of the season was kinda hit-and-miss, but the latter half picked things up with a new intro sequence, Karai becoming the new Shredder, a mutant outbreak caused by Bishop, and Don's mutation. Nobody, Usagi Yojimbo, and Gen guest star, the Uncle Augie mystery is solved, and Savanti Romero returns for revenge. There's also a heartbreaking tale from Master Yoshi's early years.Third, we get the banned episode ""Insane in the Membrane."" This one explains what happened to Baxter Stockman, as well as the introduction of the new Battle Shell seen in the intro. It's a little stronger medicine than the usual fare perhaps, but nothing worth being banned for. Again, your call.The only thing missing is the season finale ""Ninja Tribunal,"" which has probably been saved for the direct-to-video Ninja Tribunal storyline coming in 2007. Regardless, this is a must-buy for Turtles fans. A great value, and great entertainment.",5,Ninja Turtles blowout,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,1693,"['Though', 'billed', 'season', '4', 'set', '2-discs', 'only', 'contain', '14', '26', 'episodes', 'produced', 'season', '4', 'check', 'various', 'dvd', 'listings', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'are', '14', 'episodes', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'included', 'dvd', 'want', 'other', 'episodes', 'season', '4', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'single', 'discs', 'Sneaky', 'huh', 'are', 'lots', 'great', 'things', 'set', 'First', 'FOURTEEN', 'episodes', 'same', 'price', ""'ve"", 'been', 'paying', 'other', 'discs', 'more', 'double', 'Hun', 'Run', 'disc', '4x', 'early', 'releases', 'Maybe', '4Kids', 'being', 'generous', 'maybe', 'just', 'burning', 'off', 'old', 'series', 'leap', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'revamp', 'call.Second', 'are', 'better', 'episodes', 'season', '4', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'was', 'kinda', 'hit-and-miss', 'latter', 'half', 'picked', 'things', 'up', 'new', 'intro', 'sequence', 'Karai', 'becoming', 'new', 'Shredder', 'mutant', 'outbreak', 'caused', 'Bishop', 'Don', 'mutation', 'Nobody', 'Usagi', 'Yojimbo', 'Gen', 'guest', 'star', 'Uncle', 'Augie', 'mystery', 'solved', 'Savanti', 'Romero', 'returns', 'revenge', 'also', 'heartbreaking', 'tale', 'Master', 'Yoshi', 'early', 'years.Third', 'get', 'banned', 'episode', 'Insane', 'Membrane', 'one', 'happened', 'Baxter', 'Stockman', 'as', 'well', 'introduction', 'new', 'Battle', 'Shell', 'seen', 'intro', 'little', 'stronger', 'medicine', 'usual', 'fare', 'perhaps', 'nothing', 'worth', 'being', 'banned', 'Again', 'call.The', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'season', 'finale', 'Ninja', 'Tribunal', 'probably', 'been', 'saved', 'direct-to-video', 'Ninja', 'Tribunal', 'storyline', 'coming', '2007', 'Regardless', 'must-buy', 'Turtles', 'fans', 'great', 'value', 'great', 'entertainment']",N/A
