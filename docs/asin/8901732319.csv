I thought Sherry Miller, whom I had never heard of, and Howie Mandell, whom I have watched on The X Factor but didn't realize he was an actor, turned in the best performance. The story overlapped with Revelation, film two in this four part saga, which I watched earlier today, so it is very fresh in my mind. This one just didn't give me the same feeling. There were a few unexplainable through logic things that occur, but with God we can attribute those to His providence. Just like He took care of the Hebrews in battles with superior opponents, He will have a part in protecting at least some of His people during the tribulation. The 666 image on the hand was a bit behind the times. I've always suspected that the reference to this number involved bar codes consisting of 6-6-6 digits. That mark would enable people to be identified - even at a distance if that mark involves a radio frequency chip. The technology is available - and events seem to be lining up that would support a mandated insertion of these chips. This movie may be revealing the future. Let him who has ears to hear, hear.

489297,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,8901732319,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","Andre van Heerden directed and Paul Lalonde wrote TRIBULATION (2000), not one of the dumbest of Christian-video politprop...but certainly one of the harder to follow ones.A cop, Det. Tom Canboro, finds himself arguing theology with his nuclear family including his brother Calvin (Joseph Ziegler), fellow agnostic, sister Eileen (an amazing appearance by Margot Kidder), religious nut, fellow agnostic wife Suzie (Sherrie Miller, he doesn't fight with her), and one inexplicable idiot named Jason Quincy (Howie Mandel, not so annoying here).Well, I must explain the biblical Book of Revelation as well as the work of St. Paul so you can follow. See, the ""Rapture"" is the sucking-up of all good Christians by Jesus. This is an event that takes place in the sky, so it is NOT the Second Coming. Just the First Disappearing. Got that?After this occurs, the Holy Spirit itself will allegedly abandon us, leaving the time of the Tribulation (hence title)--when the antichrist will come and rule for seven years. (Here the creep is played courtesy of the ever operatic Nick Mancuso.) During the Tribulation, people will just have to find Jesus for themselves, with no grace from heaven. It is only at the end of the Tribulation that Jesus will return for the second time and settle down on earth, finally. You follow?Good, I just gave you the first 25 years of my life's worth of learning up there. Read it again and get it straight! (Now you all know why I am no longer a Christian.)This film is very clever in that it does not hit so hard or so offensively with the propaganda--not like the laughable and revolting LEFT BEHIND series. Busey is actually funny and convincing as the left-behind cop who finds faith in Jesus.Appearances by two of my favorite televangelists, the married couple Drs. Jack and Rexella Van Impe, on a then-recent tv broadcast, is skillfully done. After all good Christians are taken up, you see, a band of resistance-against-the-antichrist fighters are broadcasting episodes of the popular tv show ""Jack Van Impe"". I was delighted to see the appearance, and I wonder how deeply involved Dr. Van Impe was with this picture. The antichrist is a more solid figure, though Mancuso is never subtle or skilled, and he convinced me that something a bit like this could really happen.Here he controls the world by granting people Jedi-like powers through false, evil technology. Of course, the antichrist is possessed by Lucifer and thus wields Lucifer's power. Though that last theological point is debated, Mancuso is certainly as diabolical as he can manage. He even lets out a creepy laugh, BWAAAA-HA-HA-HA-HA ad infinitum (that is until he stops laughing).All in all it is a rather clever film, but do NOT expect to learn any actual theology here. There are warring Christian views in the world today (Millennialists, Tribulationists, Dispensationalists) and this film includes a bit of each hash. There is no clear answer as to what is occurring, and aside from a snippy little correction at the beginning of the film, absolutely no instruction.Even the semi-schizophrenic Howie Mandel escapes the antichrist's hypnotic powers somehow, and is redeemed. (I think he's redeemed...we're never shown that part.) So you have to learn on your own that the people who find themselves in TRIBULATION are without the Holy Spirit to guide them, and if they want saving at the last minute, they will have to convert (and some will have to die). Busey does one hell of a conversion scene.Anyway, all I can add is stay the hell away from this thing if you are not religious or not remotely Christian. Unlike so many Christian things, this isn't offensive, as I said, and you may like it.However, you may not like it or what it preaches.",3,"Having reviewed so many Exorcist films, well, it's only fair...",1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,3744,"['Andre', 'van', 'Heerden', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Lalonde', 'wrote', 'TRIBULATION', '2000', 'not', 'one', 'dumbest', 'Christian-video', 'politprop', 'certainly', 'one', 'harder', 'follow', 'ones.A', 'cop', 'Det', 'Tom', 'Canboro', 'arguing', 'theology', 'nuclear', 'family', 'including', 'brother', 'Calvin', 'Joseph', 'Ziegler', 'fellow', 'agnostic', 'sister', 'Eileen', 'amazing', 'appearance', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'religious', 'nut', 'fellow', 'agnostic', 'wife', 'Suzie', 'Sherrie', 'Miller', ""n't"", 'fight', 'one', 'inexplicable', 'idiot', 'named', 'Jason', 'Quincy', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'not', 'so', 'annoying', 'here', '.Well', 'must', 'explain', 'biblical', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'St.', 'Paul', 'can', 'follow', 'See', 'Rapture', 'sucking-up', 'good', 'Christians', 'Jesus', 'event', 'place', 'sky', 'NOT', 'Second', 'Coming', 'Just', 'First', 'Disappearing', 'Got', 'occurs', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'will', 'allegedly', 'abandon', 'leaving', 'time', 'Tribulation', 'hence', 'title', 'when', 'antichrist', 'will', 'come', 'rule', 'seven', 'years', 'Here', 'creep', 'played', 'courtesy', 'ever', 'operatic', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'Tribulation', 'people', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'find', 'Jesus', 'grace', 'heaven', 'only', 'end', 'Tribulation', 'Jesus', 'will', 'return', 'second', 'time', 'settle', 'down', 'earth', 'finally', 'follow', 'Good', 'just', 'gave', 'first', '25', 'years', 'life', 'worth', 'learning', 'up', 'there', 'Read', 'again', 'get', 'straight', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'Christian', 'film', 'very', 'clever', 'not', 'hit', 'so', 'hard', 'so', 'offensively', 'propaganda', 'not', 'laughable', 'revolting', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'series', 'Busey', 'actually', 'funny', 'convincing', 'left-behind', 'cop', 'who', 'faith', 'Jesus.Appearances', 'two', 'favorite', 'televangelists', 'married', 'couple', 'Drs', 'Jack', 'Rexella', 'Van', 'Impe', 'then-recent', 'tv', 'broadcast', 'skillfully', 'done', 'good', 'Christians', 'are', 'taken', 'up', 'see', 'band', 'resistance-against-the-antichrist', 'fighters', 'are', 'broadcasting', 'episodes', 'popular', 'tv', 'show', 'Jack', 'Van', 'Impe', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'appearance', 'wonder', 'how', 'deeply', 'involved', 'Dr.', 'Van', 'Impe', 'was', 'picture', 'antichrist', 'more', 'solid', 'figure', 'Mancuso', 'never', 'subtle', 'skilled', 'convinced', 'something', 'bit', 'could', 'really', 'happen.Here', 'world', 'granting', 'people', 'Jedi-like', 'powers', 'false', 'evil', 'technology', 'course', 'antichrist', 'possessed', 'Lucifer', 'thus', 'wields', 'Lucifer', 'power', 'last', 'theological', 'point', 'debated', 'Mancuso', 'certainly', 'as', 'diabolical', 'can', 'manage', 'even', 'out', 'creepy', 'laugh', 'BWAAAA-HA-HA-HA-HA', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'laughing', '.All', 'rather', 'clever', 'film', 'do', 'NOT', 'expect', 'learn', 'actual', 'theology', 'here', 'are', 'warring', 'Christian', 'views', 'world', 'today', 'Millennialists', 'Tribulationists', 'Dispensationalists', 'film', 'bit', 'hash', 'clear', 'answer', 'what', 'occurring', 'aside', 'snippy', 'little', 'correction', 'beginning', 'film', 'absolutely', 'instruction.Even', 'semi-schizophrenic', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'antichrist', 'hypnotic', 'powers', 'somehow', 'redeemed', 'think', 'redeemed', ""'re"", 'never', 'shown', 'part', 'have', 'learn', 'own', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'TRIBULATION', 'are', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'guide', 'want', 'saving', 'last', 'minute', 'will', 'have', 'convert', 'will', 'have', 'die', 'Busey', 'one', 'hell', 'conversion', 'scene.Anyway', 'can', 'add', 'hell', 'away', 'thing', 'are', 'not', 'religious', 'not', 'remotely', 'Christian', 'so', 'many', 'Christian', 'things', ""n't"", 'offensive', 'said', 'may', 'like', 'it.However', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'what']",Tribulation VHS
489298,A97Q71MM5N4NW,8901732319,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[12, 17]","I was extremely unsure of seeing the new end times thriller critics raved about called Tribulation. Other than Gary Busey, who I knew as Buddy Holly in his younger years, I knew none of the other cast except for Leigh Lewis who I had seen in the previous two films in the Apocalypse series, both very good.After seeing Tribulation, I immediately went out and bought the DVD along with the next movie in line, Judgment, which I will also be writing a review for. Tribulation is one of the greatest end times movies there is, as it provides in whatever state you are, in whatever position you're in, you can be taken in the Rapture, or be left behind. It's your choice which.Top policeman Tom Canboro (Gary Busey) is on a seemingly normal night drive, when his car suddenly and mysteriously malfunctions sending him careening into oncoming traffic, plowing right into a big rig, sending poor Tom into temporary oblivian. After waking up 1 1/2 years later to find himself a different looking man, he realizes he's not the only one to undergo a strange change.The world that he once knew is flipped upside down. Everyone seems to be supporting a new world leader named Franco Macalousso, and his strange looking new mark which is just a plain 666. As strange as this may seem, people that had once existed before Tom had his accident are nowhere in town, and the people that are still left don't remember anything that these people ever existed. Even his own brother who took the mark doesn't remember anything about their sister Eileen (Margot Kidder) who was a Christian. Guess Tom will just have to trust in someone else than his own family.You won't understand a thing about a lot of the characters in this film until you see the other two Apocalypse, and Revelation. It's all worth it though. They give you some great insight to the Tribulation, and also provide some good entertainment.

His search for answers about what has happened to the world parallels his search for spiritual answers.In the previous films of this series, the characters tried to understand the Rapture through theories of rationalism and alien intervention.

489305,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,8901732319,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[7, 12]","After a horrible first film ""Apocalypse"", a slightly better (yet still below average) second film ""Apocalypse 2: Revelation"", mostly Christian moviegoers (I should say movie renters, since none of these movies made it to theaters) were treated to yet another below average sequel in the 'Apocalypse' franchise.  Before I get into the story elements for this film, ""Apocalypse 3: Tribulation"", let me say to those who may be wondering why I continued with this series even though I hated it.  The reason is because I worked at a Christian retail store that stocked these films and they wanted people to watch them, and hopefully recommend them (though after viewing the movies there was no way I was recommending anyone to watch them).""Apocalypse 3: Tribulation"" takes place at the same exact period of time as the previous installments.  First there is the rapture, after that those who were non-believers are left behind to either choose to follow God or the Antichrist.  Those who choose wisely, and follow God, are summarily punished and executed by the forces of the Antichrist in his quest for total world domination.Why did the Lalonde brothers, who own Cloud Ten Pictures, choose to release yet another movie in this franchise and still have it go no further than the previous installments is beyond me.  I will give the writers some credit this time around, for one thing they have improved the quality of writing and they chose to have the main character (Gary Busey) awaken from a coma to discover the world had changed.  The most interesting thing about this addition to the story is that the control of the Antichrist is shown to a much stronger degree, by having the main character's brother (Howie Mandel) not even remember their own sister (Margot Kidder), who was a Christian and raptured away to be with God.  Even with this improvement the story still felt old and stale, mostly because the first two films dealt with the same topic, a way to improve this franchise beyond hiring better talent (which Cloud Ten has achieved here), is to actually further the storyline beyond the same period of time during the tribulation as the previous installments.  Some advancement would actually make this series a little more interesting, still not watchable by any means, but at least it wouldn't be the same old thing.For those that actually liked this movie, and this franchise in general, you probably all disagree with me and think that I could not have possibly been watching the same movie as you.  Well, go ahead and think those foolish thoughts, because this franchise is a stinker, and anyone who has any taste in movies knows it.  As a Christian, I find this franchise to be stupidly written, directed, and produced, and an insult to the seriousness of the source material (Book of Revelation from the Bible).If you did like this series or are at least remotely interested in further adventures from the end of days, then you're in luck as Cloud Ten Pictures actually made a fourth film called ""Apocalypse 4: Judgment"".""Apocalypse 3: Tribulation"" is rated PG-13 for violence.",2,Why Does This Abominable Series Continue?,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,3094,"['horrible', 'first', 'film', 'Apocalypse', 'slightly', 'better', 'yet', 'still', 'average', 'second', 'film', '2', 'Revelation', 'mostly', 'Christian', 'moviegoers', 'should', 'say', 'movie', 'renters', 'none', 'movies', 'made', 'theaters', 'were', 'treated', 'yet', 'below', 'average', 'sequel', ""'Apocalypse"", 'franchise', 'get', 'story', 'elements', 'film', '3', 'Tribulation', 'let', 'say', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'continued', 'series', 'even', 'hated', 'reason', 'worked', 'Christian', 'retail', 'store', 'stocked', 'films', 'wanted', 'people', 'watch', 'hopefully', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'movies', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'recommending', 'anyone', 'watch', 'Apocalypse', '3', 'Tribulation', 'place', 'same', 'exact', 'period', 'time', 'previous', 'installments', 'First', 'rapture', 'who', 'were', 'non-believers', 'are', 'left', 'choose', 'follow', 'God', 'Antichrist', 'who', 'choose', 'wisely', 'follow', 'God', 'are', 'summarily', 'punished', 'executed', 'forces', 'Antichrist', 'quest', 'total', 'world', 'domination.Why', 'did', 'Lalonde', 'brothers', 'who', 'own', 'Cloud', 'Ten', 'Pictures', 'choose', 'release', 'yet', 'movie', 'franchise', 'still', 'have', 'go', 'further', 'previous', 'installments', 'will', 'give', 'writers', 'credit', 'time', 'around', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'improved', 'quality', 'writing', 'chose', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'awaken', 'coma', 'discover', 'world', 'had', 'changed', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'addition', 'story', 'control', 'Antichrist', 'shown', 'much', 'stronger', 'degree', 'having', 'main', 'character', 'brother', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'not', 'even', 'remember', 'own', 'sister', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'who', 'was', 'Christian', 'raptured', 'away', 'be', 'God', 'Even', 'improvement', 'story', 'still', 'felt', 'old', 'stale', 'mostly', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'dealt', 'same', 'topic', 'way', 'improve', 'franchise', 'hiring', 'better', 'talent', 'Cloud', 'Ten', 'achieved', 'here', 'actually', 'further', 'storyline', 'same', 'period', 'time', 'tribulation', 'previous', 'installments', 'advancement', 'would', 'actually', 'make', 'series', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'still', 'not', 'watchable', 'means', 'least', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'old', 'thing.For', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'franchise', 'general', 'probably', 'disagree', 'think', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'Well', 'go', 'ahead', 'think', 'foolish', 'thoughts', 'franchise', 'stinker', 'anyone', 'who', 'taste', 'movies', 'Christian', 'find', 'franchise', 'be', 'stupidly', 'written', 'directed', 'produced', 'insult', 'seriousness', 'source', 'material', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'Bible', '.If', 'did', 'like', 'series', 'are', 'least', 'remotely', 'interested', 'further', 'adventures', 'end', 'days', 'then', ""'re"", 'luck', 'Cloud', 'Ten', 'Pictures', 'actually', 'made', 'fourth', 'film', 'called', 'Apocalypse', '4', 'Judgment', 'Apocalypse', '3', 'Tribulation', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence']",Tribulation VHS

While reading Good Omens may be more up my alley, there's something altogether intriguing about Apocalypse art written by people that take it all very seriously.And usually I'm vastly disappointed. I really despised the Left Behind series for example. Dull, pedantic, preachy junk.Now this movie is interesting because it has the &quot;where are they now&quot; file on Gary Busey, Margot Kidder, Howie Mandel and Nick Mancuso (who I'm sure is famous for SOMETHING). It begans with Howie Mandel going nuts in a pre-apocalyptic world. As Gary Busey (the cop) tries to have him committed, Margot Kidder playing the Christian sister preaches a lot.It's a little unfair to say it but Margot Kidder does seem just a little more nutty that Mandel. She has this earnest desperation which fits the character but it's just a little TOO earnet.ANyhow Gary Busey ends up in a car wreck, goes into a coma and when he's come out the Rapture has happened. It's a lot of chases until he gets to his wife whose broadcasting the words of Jack Van Impe and Ken Hagge (sic?) who just happened to bankroll this thing. One interesting bit is that everyone puts on helmets and the anti-Christ tempts them. If they say yes, they get 666 carved into their hands (by the way -- just a theory but the 'mark' on the hand and forehead is probably early Christian anti-semitism as that is where you place Tefillan according to halacha -- but that's just a theory) and if they say no, they die.Nick Mancuso does a fairly workable Hannibal Lector impression, and Howie Mandel is a welcome addition to the movie. There's a scene where a guard threatens everyone with death and Mandel runs away, which is nice to see. Too often people in these movie are bland talking heads for the writers. An interesting scene is the confronatation between the British &quot;Jesus is lord&quot; girl and Satan. He pretty much says that he wants company in the Lake of FIre, which was reminding me of Dr. Faustus, but I'm weird that way.

In a genre that is part science fiction, the means is possible.

I don't know where to start, in describing this film's lameness. I kept hoping for some unintentional laughs, but they were only to be found in the occasional action scene in which Gary Busey had to move his enormous gut from one side of the set to the other. Howie Mandel manages to remember all his lines and avoid touching any of the other characters, so his germ-phobia was probably not too much of a factor, but he has little or no screen presence in his role. Margot Kidder manages to say all her lines without her dentures falling out, but the lines she is given to say are pretty stale. Nick Mancuso is a standout here, simply because he looks cool and has a strong screen presence, but it is not enough to save the movie. One gets the feeling that the Biblical message (or rather Bible-believer agenda) came first, and the screenplay was cobbled together to try to convey it. This is always a recipe for a ponderous film experience, unless the film is The Ten Commandments, or the story of Jesus' life or something directly from the Bible. Oh, and by the way, this movie was funded by fundies.. televangelists in fact. So even if you are not the type who would give donations directly to some shady TV preacher, by buying this DVD, you are putting some of the money into their pockets. So since the movie is dull and amateurishly put together, just skip it altogether.",1,"Sony panders to fundie crowd, releases ponderous schlock",1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,1514,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Sony', 'would', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'dreck', 'Yes', 'watched', 'entire', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'start', 'describing', 'film', 'lameness', 'kept', 'hoping', 'unintentional', 'laughs', 'were', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'occasional', 'action', 'scene', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'had', 'move', 'enormous', 'gut', 'one', 'side', 'set', 'other', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'remember', 'lines', 'avoid', 'touching', 'other', 'characters', 'germ-phobia', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'factor', 'little', 'screen', 'presence', 'role', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'say', 'lines', 'dentures', 'falling', 'out', 'lines', 'given', 'say', 'are', 'pretty', 'stale', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'standout', 'here', 'simply', 'cool', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'One', 'feeling', 'Biblical', 'message', 'rather', 'Bible-believer', 'agenda', 'came', 'first', 'screenplay', 'was', 'cobbled', 'together', 'try', 'convey', 'always', 'recipe', 'ponderous', 'film', 'experience', 'film', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'story', 'Jesus', 'life', 'something', 'directly', 'Bible', 'Oh', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'funded', 'fundies..', 'televangelists', 'fact', 'So', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'type', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'donations', 'directly', 'shady', 'TV', 'preacher', 'buying', 'DVD', 'are', 'putting', 'money', 'pockets', 'So', 'movie', 'dull', 'amateurishly', 'put', 'together', 'just', 'skip', 'altogether']",Tribulation VHS

I think Margot Kidder is quite a trooper; she's been thru a lot since her Superman the Movie days, and every bit of it shows on her face.  I really think she's a good person, and I would like to meet her someday if I ever get the opportunity.(yea, right, like that'll happen!)  The one thing that cracks me up about this flick, tho, is even after waking up after at least a year long coma, Gary's character has got very long shaggy hair, and matching beard, but he didn't lose one ounce of that excessive belly fat!
