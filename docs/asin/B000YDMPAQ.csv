As the trip reveals serial lovers in her past, his resentment grows, especially as he takes her scenes with others out of context.  Not entirely different than 'Conversations with Other Women' with two different points of view (although not presented with a split screen), this film reminded me of a substandard 'Annie Hall'.

1118815,A2QGLDKKNDLDJ,B000YDMPAQ,Amy Steele,"[2, 4]","2 Days in Paris is a refreshing, layered, truthful depiction of relationships. The film makes shrewd observations on how a relationship influences the human heart, soul and mind. The coupling without losing the individual. Sometimes you get blinded, often you are insecure and eventually, you might get it right. This chatty, extremely funny and insightful romantic comedy finds talented actress Julie Delpy directing her own script. She co-stars with ex-boyfriend Adam Goldberg, her own parents and even her cat makes a cameo appearance.This sharp film reveals the minutiae and varied aspects of a relationship. Marion [Delpy] is a 35-year-old French woman who lives in New York. She's a photographer and has been with her serious, brooding, introspective boyfriend, Jack [Goldberg], an interior designer, for two years. After a trip to Venice, the couple stops in Paris to see her parents. During those 48-hours, Marion runs into several ex-boyfriends, throwing him into an insecure spiral and he starts to question her commitment. It's a turning point for them as the relationship will either wither or bloom in the City of Love.Delpy attacks Parisian stereotypes in a way only someone French can really do. She shows the real, gritty parts of Paris; the political undertones, the racism, the immigrants and the less-romantic side-- the dark underbelly.  2 Days in Paris simultaneously evokes Delpy's love of the city and her distain for its politics and hypocrisy.2 Days in Paris is thoughtful, genuine and amusing in its reflections on love and self-identity for a career-oriented woman in her 30s. She's independent, has had many loves and relationships in her past. In this refreshing film, the focus is a career-oriented woman who does not want children, has slept with more than a dozen men and is neither regretful nor apologetic and loves her cat and boyfriend equally.",5,Fresh and honest take on relationships for 30-somethimngs,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,1880,"['2', 'Days', 'Paris', 'refreshing', 'layered', 'truthful', 'depiction', 'relationships', 'film', 'shrewd', 'observations', 'how', 'relationship', 'human', 'heart', 'soul', 'mind', 'coupling', 'losing', 'individual', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'blinded', 'often', 'are', 'insecure', 'eventually', 'might', 'get', 'right', 'chatty', 'extremely', 'funny', 'insightful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'finds', 'talented', 'actress', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'directing', 'own', 'script', 'co-stars', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'own', 'parents', 'even', 'cat', 'cameo', 'appearance.This', 'sharp', 'film', 'reveals', 'minutiae', 'varied', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'Marion', '[', 'Delpy', ']', '35-year-old', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'photographer', 'been', 'serious', 'brooding', 'introspective', 'boyfriend', 'Jack', '[', 'Goldberg', ']', 'interior', 'designer', 'two', 'years', 'trip', 'Venice', 'couple', 'Paris', 'see', 'parents', '48-hours', 'Marion', 'several', 'ex-boyfriends', 'throwing', 'insecure', 'spiral', 'question', 'commitment', 'turning', 'point', 'relationship', 'will', 'either', 'wither', 'bloom', 'City', 'Love.Delpy', 'attacks', 'Parisian', 'stereotypes', 'way', 'only', 'someone', 'French', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'real', 'gritty', 'parts', 'Paris', 'political', 'undertones', 'racism', 'immigrants', 'less-romantic', 'side', 'dark', 'underbelly', '2', 'Days', 'Paris', 'simultaneously', 'Delpy', 'love', 'city', 'distain', 'politics', 'hypocrisy.2', 'Days', 'Paris', 'thoughtful', 'genuine', 'amusing', 'reflections', 'love', 'self-identity', 'career-oriented', 'woman', '30s', 'independent', 'had', 'many', 'loves', 'relationships', 'past', 'refreshing', 'film', 'focus', 'career-oriented', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'children', 'slept', 'more', 'dozen', 'men', 'regretful', 'apologetic', 'cat', 'boyfriend', 'equally']",Two Days in Paris

So, like inBefore Sunset(which she co-wrote), Ms. Delpy has taken things into her own hands here by writing, directing, editing and composing this film.  Impressive!  For good measure, she did the majority of the casting as well, corralling her parents (who are actors) and Adam Goldberg into the production.Like 'Before Sunset,' the film is a torrent of words.  It looks improvised, but it's not.  For example, as Delpy points out in the 'Making Of' featurette, the dinner scene where Goldberg meets Delpy's parents in a cross-cultural gaffe-fest was, in fact, highly scripted.The head-scratcher is why these two characters (Delpy's and Goldberg's) are a couple.  As the film goes on, Goldberg's character goes from quirky to annoying to downright unlikeable.  I know she's playing a role, but as a Julie Delpy fan I found myself wanting to urge her that she deserved better.That criticism aside, there are some very well-observed, flat-out funny passages in the film.",3,"Julie Delpy as star, writer, director, composer, editor...and she does casting to boot",1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,1158,"[""'ve"", 'opined', 'past', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'been', 'underutilized', 'Hollywood', 'Paris', 'feeling', 'being', 'deemed', 'too', 'American', 'French', 'tastes', 'too', 'French', 'American', 'tastes', 'So', 'inBefore', 'Sunset', 'co-wrote', 'Ms.', 'Delpy', 'taken', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'here', 'writing', 'directing', 'editing', 'composing', 'film', 'Impressive', 'good', 'measure', 'did', 'majority', 'casting', 'as', 'well', 'corralling', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'actors', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'production.Like', 'Sunset', 'film', 'torrent', 'words', 'improvised', 'not', 'example', 'Delpy', 'out', ""'Making"", 'featurette', 'dinner', 'scene', 'where', 'Goldberg', 'Delpy', 'parents', 'cross-cultural', 'gaffe-fest', 'was', 'fact', 'highly', 'scripted.The', 'head-scratcher', 'why', 'two', 'characters', 'Delpy', 'Goldberg', 'are', 'couple', 'film', 'Goldberg', 'character', 'quirky', 'annoying', 'downright', 'unlikeable', 'know', 'playing', 'role', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'fan', 'found', 'wanting', 'urge', 'deserved', 'better.That', 'criticism', 'aside', 'are', 'very', 'well-observed', 'flat-out', 'funny', 'passages', 'film']",Two Days in Paris

There is a very odd running gag between the girl and her parents who have enjoyed looking at and sharing naked pictures of the American boyfriend. He is very prudish about this and any number of other expressions of French sexual permissiveness,and, although his prudery seems a little old-fashioned, it does make for some laughs. It is after all a comedy and not meant as a social critique.  The French parents are a scream. The weirdo, animal rights terrorist who sets of a bomb in a McDonald's is very strange, but the set-up works and gets a laugh.

Nonetheless Julie Delpy's film does have its incidental pleasures, notably two winning central performances from Delpy herself as Marion and Adam Goldberg (as Jack).  Although different as chalk from cheese, they nonetheless try to sustain their love-affair in the face of almost insuperable obstacles - Marion's overbearing, non-English-speaking parents, a bohemian ex-boyfriend of Marion (Daniel Bruhl), plus a host of other impediments - imagined or otherwise - that befall Jack's stay in Paris.  The film takes some predictable potshots at Americans abroad; their monolingualism, their expectations that everyone should think like them, irrespective of cultural differences; and their obsession with private as opposed to public issues.  On the other hand the French are not immune from criticism either; Lukas (Bruhl) is portrayed as a libertine paying scant regard for such things as reliability or privacy.

1118825,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000YDMPAQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 13]","Julie Delpy has a most acerbically idiosyncratic ear for dialogue, and she seems to have this facility in both English and French. The disarming actress actually co-wrote the perceptive script to Richard Linklater'sBefore Sunset(2005), the reflective nine-years later sequel toBefore Sunrise, with Linklater and co-star Ethan Hawke. This time, she takes charge of the script and direction, as well as the leading role of a French photographer named Marion, who stops at her part-time flat in Paris with her angst-driven American boyfriend Jack. On their way back to New York from a disastrous trip to Venice, the fractious couple stops over to visit her eccentric parents, but it turns into a more revelatory trip about her past than either is prepared to face.While the similarities to the Linklater films are self-evident, the 2007 film reminds me most of Woody Allen's epochalAnnie Hallbut obviously over a much more concentrated period and with a far more bracing tone. The ramshackle, seemingly unstructured scenes pick up a detail of life that for better and worse, one rarely gets to see on screen. Taken as a series of off-kilter episodes, the movie is entertaining, especially a rabbit dinner scene that firmly establishes Jack as the family outsider. Viewed as a whole, however, it falls short in making a more resonant observation about the characters other than their mounting incompatibility. Part of the reason is that we can already tell from the first scene when the couple is waiting for a taxicab that they thrive on conflict, so what tethers them has a degree of questionability from the outset.Another reason is a discernible imbalance between the leads. With the Linklater films as her obvious training ground, Delpy brings such an intelligent spark to Marion that every moment feels spontaneous. Her assured and particularly Gallic sense of self grounds the film when it threatens to get overwhelmed by its eccentricities. Casting the often nerve-grating Adam Goldberg as Jack is a bold move for Delpy and not an altogether successful one. With his intense stare and constantly put-upon manner, the actor comes across as more irritating than clever even though Delpy generously gives him the lion's share of the laughs. It is she who makes them believable as a couple. What he does do well is portray his faltering confidence and increasing paranoia in primal strokes.Over those two defining days, Jack meets Marion's artsy, offbeat friends, three of whom are ex-lovers, and the unwanted attention of a number of other men. The funniest, most unexpected scene is in the Metro when they try avoiding a death-stare stranger who has no hesitation circling them like a buzzard.

1118828,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000YDMPAQ,Galina,"[2, 7]","2 days in Paris (2007) was produced/written/directed/edited/scored/starred by Julie Delpi who also recruited her real parents to play the parents of Marion, her alter ago.Julie Delpy who was absolutely charming as Celene, the heroine of two Richard Linklater's movies (Before the Sunrise and Before Sunset), tried to make the similar film or rather follow-up about the couple that have been together for few years, experience some problem in their relationship, and try to work them out. Judging by the fact that Delpy has thrown so much of herself in all aspects of creating the film, she deserves my deepest respect. The problem is, as much as her movie walks the same territory as Before the Sunrise and Before Sunset (it takes place in Paris as the title suggests), it is not as good as they were. The chemistry between two main characters, the French Marion (Delpy) and New Yorker, Jack (Adam Goldberg) is completely non-existent, the plot is very thin but it is not even the biggest problem. The film has no subtlety, elegance, wit, or charm, and if it does, they are very well hidden. Yes, few times Woody Allen's name came to my mind because Adam Goldberg seemed doing homage to Woody Allen's character, neurotic, unsecured, and whining - and not particularly good one. He was mean, often without the reason. The scene in the beginning of the movie when Jack gives the group of the Americans tourists the apparently wrong directions to Louver just because he is sure that they are conservative Bush supporters does not make him a white knight, and it is just not funny. I also did not find charming Marion sending to her family via e-mail the picture of naked Jack with the colorful balloons. I have nothing against pictures a la nude, and from what I was able to notice, Jack had nothing to be ashamed of but how about privacy and trust in the relationship? Whatever happens between two people in their intimacy should stay between them because it belongs to them only. How about simply asking a boyfriend if he would not mind his funny picture be sent to his girlfriend's family? Does sensitive, intelligent, feisty Marion ever think of it? I was so much in love and could not get enough of one afternoon in Paris few years back with Celene and Jesse. 77 minutes long Before Sunrise was so clever, so romantic, and so moving that it made me want to see another movie with French girl and her American love, to find out what could've happened to them. Well, little did I know that it would be ""2 Days in Paris"". It is sad for me to admit, but Delpy's follow up to two of the most romantic modern screen observations of the relationships was a disappointment. I should mention that Delpy's movie has some positive sides to it. I liked how she showed HER Paris, very real, tough, and not sentimental. I liked for the most parts her parents Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet in their roles. There is one scene that I enjoyed and every time I think of it, it makes me smile. On their way to visit Jim Morrison's grave at Per Lashes, Marion asks Jake, Why do you want to see Jim Morrison's grave? You don't even like The Doors. And he answers, ""It is a famous grave...I am a huge fan of Val Kilmer"". Sadly, all the bright points were not enough to save the movie - I never thought that two days in one of my favorite places in the world may be so unbearably long and disappointing.",2,Not the best time in Paris,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,3381,"['2', 'days', 'Paris', '2007', 'was', 'produced/written/directed/edited/scored/starred', 'Julie', 'Delpi', 'who', 'also', 'recruited', 'real', 'parents', 'play', 'parents', 'Marion', 'alter', 'ago.Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'was', 'absolutely', 'charming', 'Celene', 'heroine', 'two', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'movies', 'Sunrise', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'tried', 'make', 'similar', 'film', 'rather', 'follow-up', 'couple', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'few', 'years', 'experience', 'problem', 'relationship', 'try', 'work', 'out', 'Judging', 'fact', 'Delpy', 'thrown', 'so', 'much', 'aspects', 'creating', 'film', 'deepest', 'respect', 'problem', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'same', 'territory', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset', 'place', 'Paris', 'title', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'were', 'chemistry', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'French', 'Marion', 'Delpy', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Jack', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'completely', 'non-existent', 'plot', 'very', 'thin', 'not', 'even', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'subtlety', 'elegance', 'wit', 'charm', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'hidden', 'Yes', 'few', 'times', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'name', 'came', 'mind', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'seemed', 'doing', 'homage', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'neurotic', 'unsecured', 'whining', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'one', 'was', 'mean', 'often', 'reason', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'when', 'Jack', 'group', 'Americans', 'apparently', 'wrong', 'directions', 'Louver', 'just', 'sure', 'are', 'conservative', 'Bush', 'supporters', 'not', 'make', 'white', 'knight', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'charming', 'Marion', 'sending', 'family', 'e-mail', 'picture', 'naked', 'Jack', 'colorful', 'balloons', 'have', 'nothing', 'la', 'nude', 'what', 'was', 'able', 'notice', 'Jack', 'had', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'how', 'privacy', 'trust', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'intimacy', 'should', 'stay', 'only', 'How', 'about', 'simply', 'asking', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'funny', 'picture', 'be', 'sent', 'girlfriend', 'family', 'Does', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'feisty', 'Marion', 'ever', 'think', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'one', 'afternoon', 'Paris', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Celene', 'Jesse', '77', 'minutes', 'long', 'Sunrise', 'was', 'so', 'clever', 'so', 'romantic', 'so', 'moving', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'French', 'girl', 'American', 'love', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'happened', 'Well', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'would', 'be', '2', 'Days', 'Paris', 'sad', 'admit', 'Delpy', 'follow', 'up', 'two', 'most', 'romantic', 'modern', 'screen', 'observations', 'relationships', 'was', 'disappointment', 'should', 'mention', 'Delpy', 'movie', 'positive', 'sides', 'liked', 'how', 'showed', 'HER', 'Paris', 'very', 'real', 'tough', 'not', 'sentimental', 'liked', 'most', 'parts', 'parents', 'Albert', 'Delpy', 'Marie', 'Pillet', 'roles', 'one', 'scene', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'think', 'smile', 'way', 'visit', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'grave', 'Per', 'Lashes', 'Marion', 'Jake', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'grave', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'Doors', 'famous', 'grave', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Sadly', 'bright', 'points', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'never', 'thought', 'two', 'days', 'one', 'favorite', 'places', 'world', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'unbearably', 'long', 'disappointing']",Two Days in Paris

Fans of the angelic Ms. Delpy, or of Paris, will have to check this out, naturellement, but it is best to keep your expectations rather low.  Delpy demonstrates a sure hand with framing shots, and really, it's not possible to make Paris look unappealing, but Delpy and Adam Goldberg as the respective halves of an estranged couple sure give it the old college try, with more or less constant bickering marring the pretty views.  Enroute home to New York after a disasterous trip to Venice, Marion (Delpy) and her crabby, misthanthropic boyfriend (Goldberg) stop off for a weekend in Paris to visit her parents.  These two have been together for two years, which is long enough for once charming and endearing clashes in personal style to become grating and hateful, and that is the point at which these two have arrived.  Within the familiar environment of her childhood home, Marion is transformed in the eyes of her culture-shocked beau into something of a potty-mouthed slut with an indiscriminate and prolific past; he is not sure how to cope with this unflattering metamorphosis or the revelation that Marion has seemingly slept with half the men in Paris prior to moving in with him.  There are some nuggets of comedy gold here that Adam Goldberg might have been able to mine were he more like Bill Murray and less like himself, which is to say, dour and hairy.  As much as the audience wants to sympathize with his linguistic and romantic plight, Goldberg makes his character deeply unappealing, and we think yeah, it might be better if he were out of the picture altogether.

Indeed, both directors are truly apt comparisons with her cinematic debut as  a film director, since she possesses both an uncannily good ear for superb dialogue and utmost confidence in directing. While I recognize a superficial similarity to Allen's ""Annie Hall"" with this film, another, maybe more, apt comparison is with ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", with more emphasis on slapstick, screwball comedy from Delpy. Indeed, in a little more than an hour and a half, Delpy offers a hilarious romp through Paris as seen through the eyes of Marion, an American-based French photographer (Delpy), who introduces her Jewish-American boyfriend (Adam Goldberg) to her idiosyncratic, bohemian parents (brilliantly portrayed by Delpy's real-life parents: Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet).This film succeeds as a series of nonstop screwball episodes, in which Marion and her boyfriend meet up with several former lovers and other male companions who still remain interested in her. The film's highlight is the zany rabbit dinner in which her father grills her boyfriend about French culture and literature; that scene alone is well worth the price of admission of the film itself. In the short span of two days and one night, the young lovers make some unexpected discoveries about themselves, which promises for both a most uncertain future.

Delpy explores the nature of connection tethered to the inexorable fact the we know all too well: that ""love"" and commitment involves daily negotiation, adaptation and acceptance of teh partner for who they are. A relationship where personal quirks and idiosyncrasies are not only indulged but in some weird way celebrated. Where one never knows when or why the break-up occurs, sometimes hanging in on the precipice of chance.In other words, Delpy's Paris, and her French and Americans are real people and the story is a story about reality, even though, paradoxically, the film itself is made to poke fun at cliches. I laughed most the time, and at other times I was sad.

1118841,A13FBTZ8SO8T3D,B000YDMPAQ,o dubhthaigh,"[6, 12]","Maybe it was intentionally played out as such, but this film left me disappointed and bored. Not the least of the reasons for the ennui is that Delpy already made this film, much more effectively, with Ethan Hawke under Richard Linklater's direction. Supposedly this film, as with Sunset, is somewhat based on her romance with the male protagonist. Maybe it helps the drama to know that Hawke left Uma Thurman for Delpy and that the pivotal rant on the riverboat rang with an authenticity that one can not make up. Maybe this boyfriend, Greenberg, is as neurotica and hypochnodriac as he is played. The result is that Sunset is emtionally engaging while 2 Days seems like it's never going to end.Both Delpy and Greenberg essay stereotypes. He is the shlub hybrid of Woody Allen crossed with Jerry Seinfeld, without any of the redeeming characteristics of either. He's not that funny, and all I could feel after every moment of him on film was oy. If this is based on real life, whatever did Delpy see in this guy? Delpy for her part goes from the fast talking, liberated lover who still carried a torch lit by a sense of guilt and revenge in Sunset to just a fast talking and shallow promiscuous bonbon in 2 Days, a French blonde pretending to be Woody Allen. Not my cup of doppio I am afraid. Both characters are relentlessly grating. Nails down a chalk board the entire time they are on film. The scene of her getting him to put on a condom is possibly the least funny sexual comedy ever recorded. He gives up. I did too, and the film had hardly gone 30 minutes. It got worse as it went on.And while the city of Paris was a notable supporting player in the Sunset film, the city this time looks like if it could get out of this movie it would. More's the pity this wasn't filmed someplace more grim, as there's nothing to laugh at here.Delpy wears glasses and has an ugly astigmatism and is somewhat autistic according to the storyline. None of that means much or explains much, but there you have it. Supposedly she took up photography and then Greenberg usurped that role on whatever trip this is supposed to be. Perhaps that is a political statement on US/Franco relations. Perhaps I'm hoping she might actually have been reaching to say something. In any case, it is a far cry from the story that unfolds in Sunset as two lovers reunite at first just to find out what happened to each other and then come through the anger and recrimination of missed opportunities and settled decisions that have imprisoned each while the other always hoped for another chance. This is just two self-absorbed, mean spirited whiners, ugly american nails ugly french tart. I am reminded of the Eric Idle bit in the tourist sketch about the guy who whines and whines in a stream of consciousness about Whatley's red ale and they don't make the scones like they do in Dorset and.....Hopefully Delpy is capable of better. Maybe give up on the old boyfriend routine. She isn't Joni Mitchell in film, so leave the forlorn romances to someone else. That or just do such films with Hawke. There was a real chemistry present that is conspicuous by its absence here. The only saving graces of this film are her parents, who are deliciously off the rive gauche throughout the movie, and the actress who plays her sister. Mom's a little nuts, and Dad has obviously OD'd on Cialis. The sister is as much of a hoot as Christopher Walkin was as Diane Keaton's brother in Annie Hall.

1118848,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000YDMPAQ,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 2]","For anyone who has ever experienced cross cultural (cross Atlantic) love affair, this movie is the bull's eye in describing obstacles in the relationship of two people who come from two very different countries and backgrounds.  I personally wanted to see a film that was Julie Delpy's own little personal project since she has already shown her incredible talent as an actress and now is ready to reveal herself to the world as a writer, director and musician.  She is obviously multi talented and smart and she is still beautiful even without any makeup on her face during certain shots in this movie.  The relationship is between two neurotic people: French woman (Delpy), a photographer, and an American man (Goldberg) an interior designer.  Their professions have a hint of artistic tendencies without any pretensions.  Both are in their mid-thirties and well aware that by now each had their own share of heartache and disappointments from past relationships.  Can these two lovers from two different backgrounds, one too repressed and another unable to control her impulses capable to salvage their relationship and build from there?  This is really what the film is all about.  This is not about pure love, first love, biggest love or the last love - it is about two middle aged, somewhat damaged people trying to be adults, rationalize each other's shortcomings and still be acceptable and forgiving of them.  It is about making compromises rather than facing loneliness and superficial idea that things could be better with someone else.  Film has many funny moments that anyone can relate to: racist cab drivers; overzealous mother who likes to do the laundry and have it neatly folded in the lover's bedroom; free spirited father who just has to get his way with the people parking their car(s) in the way of pedestrians walkway; sexual repression vs. free spirit ready to contain itself to a committed relationship.

Anyone who has gone on vacation with a lover they ""kind of know"" has had that feeling of how a relationship will either be strengthened or torn apart in a different situation when the only binding force is the person you are with.Every cliche in the relationship-falling-apart drama is here -- the eccentric parents; the annoying sister; the obligatory argument on the banks of the Seine; the handsome and mysterious friends.Delby wrote, stars in, and directed this film. The Last of that list is the reason this film doesn't work. It is poorly directed, the camera angles weird, and for a film set in her hometown of Paris, you see almost none of it -- what is the purpose of staging an elaborate fight on the banks of the Seine when you throw it into such low depth of field that everything except your face is out of focus -- it might as well be a fight on the shore of the Detroit River.The finest scene in the film -- a conversation in a taxi with the driver in which her venom and drivel (and flirting) remain untranslated to her non-French speaking boyfriend Adam, is stunning. It's a shame the entire movie couldn't maintain this level of observation.Delpy and Goldberg are real-life ex-lovers, so their scenes together seem comfortable and relaxed, for the most part. Julie does a fine job in her acting scenes, and my respect for her work continues to increase with each film, maybe one day she will win me over. Adam Goldberg here gets the showier work, and he does an excellent job with it. Someone write this man a movie role, please!This is advertised as a comedy. IT IS NOT. It is a bitter, sometimes unpleasant, and occasionally amusing look at a relationships last days.The final scene is as cliche as the rest of the film -- flashback dancing in a cafe to rap music. ARGH.Recommended, but you won't want to see it more than once, so I'm not sure this is a film you will want in your permanent DVD  collection, unless you have a specialized collection.",3,Over-rated and Under-directed,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,2311,"['have', 'preface', 'saying', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'fan', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'rate', 'high', 'actor-index', 'being', 'multiple-time', 'year', 'visitor', 'Paris', 'movie', 'immediately', 'drew', 'attention.There', 'nothing', 'much', 'interest', 'film', 'other', 'watching', 'couple', 'fall', 'apart', 'course', 'several', 'days', 'Anyone', 'who', 'gone', 'vacation', 'lover', 'kind', 'know', 'had', 'feeling', 'how', 'relationship', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'strengthened', 'torn', 'apart', 'different', 'situation', 'when', 'only', 'binding', 'force', 'person', 'are', 'with.Every', 'cliche', 'relationship-falling-apart', 'drama', 'here', 'eccentric', 'parents', 'annoying', 'sister', 'obligatory', 'argument', 'banks', 'Seine', 'handsome', 'mysterious', 'friends.Delby', 'wrote', 'stars', 'directed', 'film', 'Last', 'list', 'reason', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'poorly', 'directed', 'camera', 'weird', 'film', 'set', 'hometown', 'Paris', 'see', 'almost', 'none', 'what', 'purpose', 'staging', 'elaborate', 'fight', 'banks', 'Seine', 'when', 'throw', 'such', 'low', 'depth', 'field', 'everything', 'face', 'focus', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'fight', 'shore', 'Detroit', 'River.The', 'finest', 'scene', 'film', 'conversation', 'taxi', 'driver', 'venom', 'drivel', 'flirting', 'remain', 'untranslated', 'non-French', 'speaking', 'boyfriend', 'Adam', 'stunning', 'shame', 'entire', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'level', 'observation.Delpy', 'Goldberg', 'are', 'real-life', 'ex-lovers', 'scenes', 'together', 'seem', 'comfortable', 'relaxed', 'most', 'part', 'Julie', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'scenes', 'respect', 'work', 'increase', 'film', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'win', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'here', 'showier', 'work', 'excellent', 'job', 'Someone', 'write', 'man', 'movie', 'role', 'please', 'advertised', 'comedy', 'IT', 'NOT', 'bitter', 'sometimes', 'unpleasant', 'occasionally', 'amusing', 'look', 'relationships', 'last', 'days.The', 'final', 'scene', 'as', 'cliche', 'rest', 'film', 'flashback', 'dancing', 'cafe', 'rap', 'music', 'ARGH.Recommended', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'more', 'once', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'permanent', 'DVD', 'collection', 'have', 'specialized', 'collection']",Two Days in Paris

It's a little bit funny, not the least bit frothy, and not really romantic.I did not realize until the credits rolled just how much of a Julie Delpy movie this is.  She wrote the script, starred, produced, wrote some of the music.  Her real life family played her family in the movie.This often reminded me of a Woody Allen flick, specifically Annie Hall.  However, this is a much edgier movie.  Jack and Marion are both too caught up in their own issues to connect effectively with each other.  It's not really a love story.  Ultimately the focus becomes the clash of two cultures.  Marion is a Paris girl.  Jack is an American with a Jewish name who is not a practicing Jew and is often mistaken for an Arab or a terrorist.  They are on Marion's turf.  Jack usually flounders, and she doesn't do much to help him out.Marion's voice-over narration is the strongest part of the movie for me.  She shows insight and self-awareness that is usually lacking in her scenes with Jack (in fact toward the end of the movie I am almost ready to side with Jack that she has serious anger management issues and is in dire need of professional help.)  I felt like the viewer is meant to pick a side, Jack's or Marion's.  But that would require a level of involvement that I just didn't feel.I also thought the soundtrack was appealing.I know that Julie Delpy has made other movies with the same basic premise.  I understand there is at least one more to come, Two Days in New York.  Actually it will be interesting to see Marion in America.  I may eventually check out Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, but I am certainly not ready to admit this is Julie Delpy's world and we're all just living in it.",3,Quirky with a capital Q,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1797,"['OK', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'research', 'ordering', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'frothy', 'funny', 'romantic', 'little', 'bit', 'funny', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'frothy', 'not', 'really', 'romantic.I', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'credits', 'rolled', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'movie', 'wrote', 'script', 'starred', 'produced', 'wrote', 'music', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'played', 'family', 'movie.This', 'often', 'reminded', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'flick', 'specifically', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'However', 'much', 'edgier', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Marion', 'are', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'issues', 'connect', 'effectively', 'other', 'not', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'Ultimately', 'focus', 'clash', 'two', 'cultures', 'Marion', 'Paris', 'girl', 'Jack', 'American', 'Jewish', 'name', 'who', 'not', 'practicing', 'Jew', 'often', 'mistaken', 'Arab', 'terrorist', 'are', 'Marion', 'turf', 'Jack', 'usually', 'flounders', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'help', 'out.Marion', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'strongest', 'part', 'movie', 'insight', 'self-awareness', 'usually', 'lacking', 'scenes', 'Jack', 'fact', 'end', 'movie', 'am', 'almost', 'ready', 'side', 'Jack', 'serious', 'anger', 'management', 'issues', 'dire', 'need', 'professional', 'help', 'felt', 'viewer', 'meant', 'pick', 'side', 'Jack', 'Marion', 'would', 'require', 'level', 'involvement', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel.I', 'also', 'thought', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'appealing.I', 'know', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'made', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'basic', 'premise', 'understand', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'come', 'Two', 'Days', 'New', 'York', 'Actually', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'Marion', 'America', 'may', 'eventually', 'check', 'out', 'Sunrise', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'ready', 'admit', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'world', ""'re"", 'just', 'living']",Two Days in Paris

The story is simple-Delpy keeps running into ex-lovers and Goldberg imagines that his girlfriend is a slut and comes to the conclusion that he ""doesn't know her at all"".As serious as this plot sounds, I was laughing for most of this film. There is enough humor in this script to keep the film light. Many of the funny scenes arise out of cultural differences refreshingly void of the typical French vs. American cliches. Much of the humor is ""French""-like the scene at the dinner table when the family yells at each other one minute and then starts laughing a few minutes later. Americans would describe this as ""bi-polar drama"", but the French view this sort of passion and recovery as normal. There are also subtle cultural references like the ""385 Bitches"" and Delpy's sexual attempts to be on top-a French man would be able to explain to you that French women are known for their independence. Unlike other reviewers here, I found Delpy and Goldberg a charming couple and enjoyed watching their antics. I never wondered why this couple was together-it seems like couples are usually fighting when travelling through Europe together. It was interesting to see what comes out of the arguments I've always heard on the streets! Many of the minor characters in this film are extremely charming-especially Delpy's parents.
