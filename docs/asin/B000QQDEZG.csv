1076466,A73C1BKSAZPA,B000QQDEZG,Adam Richter,"[15, 15]","They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a shame that they don't. If someone decided to ""re-imagine"" ISIS today, it'd most likely be a dark, dreary, serialized mess (two words: BIONIC WOMAN), chock full of  violence and lame attempts at being hip or ironic. Sure, ISIS had special ""effects"" that Ed Wood would've laughed at, and the show required not just a suspension, but an outright EXPULSION, of disbelief (for example, Isis's dimwitted male teacher pal could never figure out her obvious true identity, yet at one point we're supposed to believe that in his spare time he just so happens to be working for a secret government project in which he's invented a weather-controlling machine!) But this show was charming in its innocence, and star Joanna Cameron was very easy on the eyes. And it always had a positive message and a happy ending.The extras are a mixed bag. The inclusions of an ISIS cartoon and production stills are to be applauded, but commentary from the show's producers is a waste of time (they don't remember a lot of specifics about the show, and their self-congratulatory remarks about creating a show that respected women are dealt a blow when they state that their main goal in selecting an actress to play the part of Isis was to find someone with ""great legs."") My advice: skip the commentary and interviews involving the producers, but check out everything else.The audio-visual quality of the episodes themselves isn't as sharp as that in the ""Wonder Woman"" DVD's, to make the closest comparison that comes to mind as far as genre and era of production. However, it's hardly unwatchable, and as others have mentioned, it's all brightly lit (mainly because the series was shot pretty much entirely in daylight to keep expenses as low as possible.)So watch the adventures of ISIS and her friends and I'm sure you'll agree, they just don't make 'em like this anymore.

1076467,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B000QQDEZG,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[21, 24]","THE SECRETS OF ISIS dvd set is a show that only people who grew up in the United States (and Canada, I'm told)during the 70s can appreciate. It's part of the historical phenomenon that has become known as ""Saturday Morning"" tv, which was a programming block on all three major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) with shows aimed specifically at children. The block began around 7AM till about 12PM (if memory serves me) and always on Saturday mornings. No matter what walk of life a person has come from, if you ask anyone of a certain age that grew up in the U.S., they will remember Saturday mornings as waking up early (without being asked), sitting in a bean-bag chair, eating cereal and glued to the the tv set.I only mention this because those who are not familiar with these Saturday morning shows might be disappointed with this dvd set. First off, as one reviewer has stated, the picture quality isn't as good as one would hope. Even though the shows have been digitally remastered, they seem to be a little washed out in color. The picture itself is sharp, but has a fuzzy quality that either has to do with the lighting or the deterioration of the original prints. Either way the shows look dated.The second thing that might bother some viewers is the special effects. This was before the digital age and many of the special fx shots are painfully obvious. Most consist of superimposing Joanna Cameron as ""Isis"" against a filmed backdrop of aerial shots for flying scenes, I think they call this a process shot, and of running film backwards or pausing it. Anyway, it makes shows like ""Wonder Woman"" seem light years ahead in the special effects department.And I'm not knocking it! I know THE SECRETS OF ISIS was done in 1975 and the budget was very SMALL so they did the best they could. And again, this was aimed at kids but I thought you'd want to know. Also, if you were expecting lots of action scenes between Isis and the bad guys you'll probably be let down. There were more fight scenes in the second season of ""Dynasty"" then there are in ""...ISIS."" Most action shots consist of Isis flying, landing, saying an incantation and making things all right...don't expect the heroine to be running around and jumping and throwing grown men around like rag dolls i.e. ""Wonder Woman"" or ""The Bionic Woman."" Perhaps this was due in part because THE SECRETS OF ISIS was the first live action female super hero to have her own show (Batgirl was part of BATMAN) and they didn't know how far to push the envelope.Anyway, the dvd set contains 22 episodes with a couple of appearances by Captain Marvel (SHAZAM) and each show presents a moral or cautionary tale i.e. don't hitchhike, don't cheat, respect yourself etc., that teaches kids (without them knowing) about values, and does so without being too scary or preachy. Another thing that was a big plus is the use of a multi-racial cast. Even though they were minorities, the supporting characters like ""Cindy Lee"" and ""Rennie Carol"" come off as just other Americans and not stereo types. Didn't realize it then, but I see it now.Also included is bonus features like interviews with producers Lou Scheimer and Richard M. Rosenbloom, and co-stars Brian Cutler (Rick Mason), Joanna Pang Atkins (Cindy Lee), Ronalda Douglas Lomabardo (Rennie Carol), as well as writers of the show and the assistant director Henry J. Lange Jr. Joanna Cameron is not included in the interviews.One thing that I didn't like about the interviews, and I saw this same thing on another Filmation dvd set of ""The Archies,"" was that the interview is shown picture-in-picture. The interview is in a small box that's placed over scenes from the show. It's not too big a deal but annoying. And on the ISIS dvd, you have to play the interviews one at a time.Also in the special features is an animated episode of ""The Plant Soldiers"" from the show The Freedom Force, starring Isis. A small tri-fold pamphlet is included in the dvd set with a brief synopsis of the show, episode titles (including air and shoot dates, description, trivia), and info on the special features.All in all this set should satisfy any ISIS/SATURDAY MORNING fan. But again, if you're not familiar with the show, rent it first. And if you do remember the show but can't remember any specifics about it, as long as you can live with the stuff I mentioned above you'll enjoy THE SECRETS OF ISIS dvd set.",4,Great Saturday Morning Nostalgia!,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,4392,"['SECRETS', 'OF', 'ISIS', 'dvd', 'set', 'show', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'United', 'States', 'Canada', ""'m"", 'told', '70s', 'can', 'appreciate', 'part', 'historical', 'phenomenon', 'become', 'known', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'tv', 'was', 'programming', 'block', 'three', 'major', 'networks', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'NBC', 'shows', 'aimed', 'specifically', 'children', 'block', 'began', '7AM', 'till', '12PM', 'memory', 'serves', 'always', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'matter', 'what', 'walk', 'life', 'person', 'come', 'ask', 'anyone', 'certain', 'age', 'grew', 'up', 'U.S.', 'will', 'remember', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'waking', 'up', 'early', 'being', 'asked', 'sitting', 'bean-bag', 'chair', 'eating', 'cereal', 'glued', 'tv', 'set.I', 'only', 'mention', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'shows', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'dvd', 'set', 'First', 'off', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'Even', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'seem', 'be', 'little', 'washed', 'out', 'color', 'picture', 'sharp', 'fuzzy', 'quality', 'do', 'lighting', 'deterioration', 'original', 'prints', 'way', 'shows', 'look', 'dated.The', 'second', 'thing', 'might', 'bother', 'viewers', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'digital', 'age', 'many', 'special', 'fx', 'shots', 'are', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Most', 'consist', 'superimposing', 'Joanna', 'Cameron', 'Isis', 'filmed', 'backdrop', 'aerial', 'shots', 'flying', 'scenes', 'think', 'call', 'process', 'shot', 'running', 'film', 'backwards', 'pausing', 'Anyway', 'shows', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'seem', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'special', 'effects', 'department.And', ""'m"", 'not', 'knocking', 'know', 'SECRETS', 'OF', 'ISIS', 'was', 'done', '1975', 'budget', 'was', 'very', 'SMALL', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'again', 'was', 'aimed', 'kids', 'thought', ""'d"", 'want', 'know', 'Also', 'were', 'expecting', 'lots', 'action', 'scenes', 'Isis', 'bad', 'guys', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'were', 'more', 'fight', 'scenes', 'second', 'season', 'Dynasty', 'then', 'are', 'ISIS', 'Most', 'action', 'shots', 'consist', 'Isis', 'flying', 'landing', 'saying', 'incantation', 'making', 'things', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'heroine', 'be', 'running', 'around', 'jumping', 'throwing', 'grown', 'men', 'rag', 'dolls', 'i.e', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'part', 'THE', 'SECRETS', 'OF', 'ISIS', 'was', 'first', 'live', 'action', 'female', 'super', 'hero', 'have', 'own', 'show', 'Batgirl', 'was', 'part', 'BATMAN', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'far', 'push', 'envelope.Anyway', 'dvd', 'set', '22', 'episodes', 'couple', 'appearances', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'SHAZAM', 'show', 'moral', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'i.e', 'do', ""n't"", 'hitchhike', 'do', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'respect', 'etc.', 'teaches', 'kids', 'knowing', 'values', 'so', 'being', 'too', 'scary', 'preachy', 'thing', 'was', 'big', 'plus', 'use', 'multi-racial', 'cast', 'Even', 'were', 'minorities', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Cindy', 'Lee', 'Rennie', 'Carol', 'come', 'off', 'just', 'other', 'Americans', 'not', 'stereo', 'types', 'Did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'then', 'see', 'now.Also', 'included', 'bonus', 'features', 'interviews', 'producers', 'Lou', 'Scheimer', 'Richard', 'M.', 'Rosenbloom', 'co-stars', 'Brian', 'Cutler', 'Rick', 'Mason', 'Joanna', 'Pang', 'Atkins', 'Cindy', 'Lee', 'Ronalda', 'Douglas', 'Lomabardo', 'Rennie', 'Carol', 'as', 'well', 'writers', 'show', 'assistant', 'director', 'Henry', 'J.', 'Lange', 'Jr.', 'Joanna', 'Cameron', 'not', 'included', 'interviews.One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'interviews', 'saw', 'same', 'thing', 'Filmation', 'dvd', 'set', 'Archies', 'was', 'interview', 'shown', 'picture-in-picture', 'interview', 'small', 'box', 'placed', 'scenes', 'show', 'not', 'too', 'big', 'deal', 'annoying', 'ISIS', 'dvd', 'have', 'play', 'interviews', 'one', 'time.Also', 'special', 'features', 'animated', 'episode', 'Plant', 'Soldiers', 'show', 'Freedom', 'Force', 'starring', 'Isis', 'small', 'tri-fold', 'pamphlet', 'included', 'dvd', 'set', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'show', 'episode', 'titles', 'including', 'air', 'shoot', 'dates', 'description', 'trivia', 'info', 'special', 'features.All', 'set', 'should', 'satisfy', 'ISIS/SATURDAY', 'MORNING', 'fan', 'again', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'show', 'rent', 'first', 'do', 'remember', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'specifics', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'live', 'stuff', 'mentioned', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'THE', 'SECRETS', 'OF', 'ISIS', 'dvd', 'set']",The Secrets of Isis - The Complete Series

Such was the case when hottie JoAnna Cameron donned her ancient Egyptian amulet and chanted toward the sky ""Oh zephyr winds which blow high, lift me now so I can fly,"" and I was awakened to such childhood wonders!  Isis was a generational inspiration in the pantheon of heroic 70's television babes that included Linda Carter's Wonder Woman, Lindsay Wagner as the Bionic Woman, Charlie's Angels and Erin Gray's Wilma from Buck Rogers.As science teacher Andrea Thomas, she had found the ancient amulet of Hatshepsut during an archeological dig which endowed upon her the powers of the ancient Egyptian goddess with the gifts of flight, speed, strength and telekinesis which were summoned when she intoned the sacred chants and using her powers selflessly to help those in need.  Her secret identity was concealed even from her closest friends Rick Mason, Renee Carol and Cindy Lee, but known only to her faithful feathered companion, a black crow named Tut.The Secrets of Isis began as part of the Shazam!/Isis hour on CBS in 1975 consisting of 15 episodes and spun-off into her own series the following year but lasted only 7 episodes.  Isis would also crossover and appear in 3 episodes of Shazam! and later she appeared in animation form as a character of the Freedom Force on Tarzan and the Super 7.Season 11.

Too bad the people who own these series always wait so long to release them. They are just lucky they have die hard fans that loved some of these shows or they'd make zilch on them now. They would sit on some studio shelf rotting away until their destroyed.What I always loved about ISIS is it's sense of wholesomeness and its ongoing sense of adventure. ISIS was a hero to look up to, and better portrayed it than any of todays so-called ""hero's"" She was not violent and didn't carry a machine gun. She did not use foul language. No wonder it's not on tv anymore! The point is, today we have do not have positive heroes to look up to. Todays kids are introduced to mostly violent programming and inappropriate content. The Simpsons are a good example of that. I do not find the show funny or good for kids.  I grew up with ISIS, SHAZAM, WONDER WOMAN, THE BIONIC WOMAN, THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN. When my generation were kids we all wanted to be one of these heroes. We had a reason to stay home on a Friday and Saturday night with our families and watch these shows together. We still talk about and cherish those times now. I'm at the age of 41 now and they have just finally released the first 2 seasons of the Bionic Woman on region 2 dvd and the Six Million Dollar Man, and 2 years ago Wonder Woman series. I own all of what is available of these shows and I have the kids I work with view them now and then. Some kids love them, and others are not even slightly interested in them. The ones that don't like them think they don't have enough action. What they really want is all that phony computer generated and overly fast paced junk that looks much more fake than when they actually used to do it the hard way and have actual stunts.Oh well, I could go on and on, but the important thing about ISIS and SHAZAM is that these shows were kid friendly, had morals to be learned, and showed young people to they could be real hero's too. I saw the comments about her being a sexual device, but that was never part of the shows intention. JoAnna Cameron was lovely and in my opinion had the look of innocence and purity much like Lynda Carter always has, but the show was not about sex for me. Funny though, JoAnna was one of the prettiest women I have ever seen and when she was ISIS, ""WOW!""

1076481,A291Q46ZTQD2HK,B000QQDEZG,K. T. Ong,"[0, 1]","I remember watching 'Isis' on TV long ago with my niece. Both of us loved her and the series. A superheroine/goddess who bends the laws of Nature to her will by verbalising rhyming couplets is simply 'cool'. :) It's a joy in this respect to see her in action again after all these years, and relive all the fond memories. The picture quality of the DVDs is reasonably good on the whole. My only complaints concern the concept and storyline.First, Isis is the ONLY being from Egyptian mythology ever to appear in the entire series. I can't understand why. To me this amounts to a total failure to exploit the core concept of the series, which could be where its greatest potential lies. Imagine if other members of the Egyptian pantheon or other elements of ancient Egypt were to appear at times, some to help and others to cause trouble. Maybe Andrea's friend Mason could assume the role of Osiris in one episode? Maybe a mummy in a museum could be awakened by the power of Andrea's amulet in another? If you're not gonna have such things, then what significance is there in having a superheroine based on Egyptian myth? She might just as well be based on Celtic myth, or advanced alien technology, or whatever.I also can't understand why Capt Marvel is put into a couple of the episodes. How does he fit in? There's no account of his origins and how he met and teamed up with Isis. He's just placed liberally into the series, that's it.The action also feels inconsistent at times. In one episode, Isis had to jump into the sea and swim to a drowning boy and his dog to save them. Why? Couldn't she just call on the winds to lift them out of the water? If there's any special reason, the series didn't say what it is.Finally, why is there no interview with Joanna Cameron herself?But I guess I might be nitpicking. It's still an enjoyable series on the whole. Always love the little moral lessons offered in Filmation productions. :)",4,I like Isis but...,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,1933,"['remember', 'watching', ""'Isis"", 'TV', 'long', 'ago', 'niece', 'loved', 'series', 'A', 'superheroine/goddess', 'who', 'laws', 'Nature', 'will', 'verbalising', 'rhyming', 'couplets', 'simply', ""'cool"", 'joy', 'respect', 'see', 'action', 'again', 'years', 'relive', 'fond', 'memories', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'reasonably', 'good', 'whole', 'only', 'complaints', 'concern', 'concept', 'storyline.First', 'Isis', 'ONLY', 'being', 'Egyptian', 'mythology', 'ever', 'appear', 'entire', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'total', 'failure', 'exploit', 'core', 'concept', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'where', 'greatest', 'potential', 'lies', 'Imagine', 'other', 'members', 'Egyptian', 'pantheon', 'other', 'elements', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'were', 'appear', 'times', 'help', 'others', 'cause', 'trouble', 'Maybe', 'Andrea', 'friend', 'Mason', 'could', 'assume', 'role', 'Osiris', 'one', 'episode', 'Maybe', 'mummy', 'museum', 'could', 'be', 'awakened', 'power', 'Andrea', 'amulet', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'have', 'such', 'things', 'then', 'what', 'significance', 'there', 'having', 'superheroine', 'based', 'Egyptian', 'myth', 'might', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'based', 'Celtic', 'myth', 'advanced', 'alien', 'technology', 'whatever.I', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Capt', 'Marvel', 'put', 'couple', 'episodes', 'How', 'fit', 'account', 'origins', 'how', 'met', 'teamed', 'up', 'Isis', 'just', 'placed', 'liberally', 'series', 'it.The', 'action', 'also', 'inconsistent', 'times', 'one', 'episode', 'Isis', 'had', 'jump', 'sea', 'swim', 'drowning', 'boy', 'dog', 'save', 'Why', 'Could', ""n't"", 'just', 'call', 'winds', 'lift', 'water', 'special', 'reason', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'is.Finally', 'why', 'there', 'interview', 'Joanna', 'Cameron', 'guess', 'might', 'be', 'nitpicking', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'whole', 'love', 'little', 'moral', 'lessons', 'offered', 'Filmation', 'productions']",The Secrets of Isis - The Complete Series

But when I say fond memories I mean that I remember seeing and enjoying it but my actual recollection of the individual episodes is almost zero save for the fact that Isis had a secret identity and could fly and control the weather.Watching the episodes have transported me back to the age of saturday morning cartoons and live action series likeArk II: The Complete Series,Jason of Star Command - The Complete Seriesand of course the Shazam-Isis hour.The episodes ara fantastic, but only if you lived through the era of saturday morning cartoons, otherwise they will seem hopelessly corny. Isis is played with serene dignity by the beautiful Joanna Cameron who has the power of flight and many others like stopping time and telekenisis. Despite having the powers of a goddess, Isis dedicates herself to helping kids in trouble or who have gone astray. The lovely Joanna Pang as Cindy Lee (first season) and Rick Mason round out the cast nicely as friends of Andrea Thomas (Isis' alter ego).Some have complained about the image quality but I saw it just fine, with the exception of some of Isis' flying scenes which do seem a bit blurry, but hey, the show is 30 years old!The extras are very good, comprised mostly of interviews, however the recollection by the producers regarding anecdotes about the series was hazy at best. The best one was the interview with Joanna Pang (Cindy Lee) who spoke fondly of her time on the show. A glaring omission is commentary by Isis herself - Joanna Cameron! She was either unable or unwilling to participate but that doesn't substract from the DVD set as a whole.

I received my set last week and was initially impressed.  Excellent packaging, extras and special features made it seem like this set of DVDs was what I've been looking forward to for so many years.  Then I played one of the DVDs....to say the picture quality is poor is being nice.  I thought it was just the first episode, but I checked through all the others....same problem and same washed-out looking print.  Honestly, these episodes look like an old 38mm film that has been setting out in the sun for 20 years.  Audio reproduction is a little better than the video, but not by much.  The overall quality, despite the dvd box claiming the episodes have been ""digitally remastered"", is akin to that of a 4th generation bootleg you'd buy off of some auction site.  This has really and truly depressed me.  To be fair, I do have to hand it to Entertainment Rights and the other parties involved regarding their efforts in finally bringing this (formerly) great series to DVD.  However, I find it hard to believe that these are the best prints available of this series.  I saw several clips from ""Isis"" on the VH1 show ""I Love The 70's"" and they looked much better than what is present on these discs.

The set includes some really great photos on the disc covers and a booklet with a little about each episode. The commentary is informative and the interviews with all the other casts members and behind the scenes people are wonderful and detailed. There's even a bonus cartoon featuring Isis and a collection of pictures of Isis toys and memorabilia. I wish every DVD set were as well put together as this set is.I watched Isis as a kid. I had some of the comic books based on the show, too. I loved her. I wasn't interested in boy superheros. I wanted girl superheros, and at the time, the only other 3 I knew of (being only 8) was Wonder Woman, Batgirl and Supergirl. Wonder Woman was not a show on TV yet, nor was Supergirl and Batgirl was only seen here and there on Batman reruns. Isis was the first live action girl superhero to have her own show. However, it wasn't because she was first and only, but because she really is cool, that I loved her and still do. The power to command earth and sky pretty much covers it. Isis can fly like Supergirl and is strong like Wonder Woman, but unlike them, she can command air, time, water and land. She controls physics. That kind of makes her about as powerful as you can be, really.Sure the picture is a little washed and looks dated. That's part of the charm, especially for those of us who watched it on TV first. But for me, I watched it on an old black and white TV, so this was a real treat to see it in color. Also, the lessons taught on the show still stand up today. We've come a long way on some issues, but there's still plenty of bigotry around and other lessons about ""being good"" or ""being responsible"" are as meaningful today as ever, maybe more so.

(This scene being repeated in millions of homes on Saturday morning) JoAnna Cameron - at first - turned down the offer of playing Isis, however, I could not imagine anyone else but her being this character. Yes, there is a camp quality to the series several decades on but Ms. Cameron delivers her lines with a regal quality (She also has a beautiful dulcet speaking voice) There was something for everyone here in this series. If you are a male of a certain age - as I am - she was probably your first crush. For girls, she probably represented a female role model to look up to. And yes, I am sure some fathers were tuning in as well (I will admit she does have superb legs) For an introspective small town girl from Colorado to inspire such devotion from her fans is saying something. JoAnna Cameron was probably deserving of much better roles and there was probably some typecasting as a result of taking a role like this but without any disrespect to the other cast members, she really was this show. Her wholesome sex appeal and ""girl next door"" quality brought this very low budget affair to a higher level.

1076509,ALE1R0K4KYPG9,B000QQDEZG,William B. Bangs,"[3, 3]","DISCLAIMER: This review does not apply to the extras, which I intend to view shortly after writing this.Oh, Mighty Isis, you're pretty cool if I do say so myself.  Along with Wonder Woman, The Bionic Woman and any number of their spiritual sisters since, Isis was a different type of crimebuster, a kinder, gentler one who, though nice to all, could still get the job done as well as any man.  A staple of the transition between strictly Saturday morning and the regular programming which resumed after noon, Isis (along with her much dorkier male counterpart, Shazam, a.k.a. ""Captain Marvel"") was fun to watch, though not quite as memorable or substantive as the others.  Like bionic Jaime Sommers, her alter ego was a teacher, and like Wonder Woman, she relied on magic and traced her roots back to an ancient goddess.  But UNLIKE these others, Isis only had HALF the hour to herself, less when the occasional crossover episode saw her asking Shazam for help (something else which would become a fixture on The Bionic Woman a year later, and would work MUCH better there).The writing was a mixed bag, and a small but significant turn for the worse accompanied Isis' short-lived run independent of her predecessor.  Since Joanna Cameron didn't participate in the interviews, it's almost too bad you can't just get the first two discs.  To enjoy this show, you'll also have to be willing to accept the magic source of Isis' powers, a definite drawback of this show as compared to the much better Bionic Woman.  After all, Isis descends literally from on high most times, and simply tells the elements what to do -- not much of a challenge except for thinking up appropriate rhyming couplets.  Still, this allows her to capture everyone without hurting a soul.And in the end, it really doesn't matter, at least for the golden run of the series, to be found on the first two discs.  Standout episodes?  ""Fool's Dare"", where she is truly tender in her capture the bad guys, with a net and old tires, respectively, and the one later on, which is set in a ghost town, where she temporarily loses her power-bestowing amulet, and has to have her students help out.  Worth a miss?  ""Lucky,"" about the death of a pet -- too raw and real -- and ""The Hitchhikers"" on the last disc, for its cavalier treatment of a serious subject even as the rest of these final episodes were getting too serious, and alter ego Andrea Thomas was beginning to talk -- and sound -- like the smart alec Dianna Prince of Wonder Woman's second season.  As for the final two-parter, let's just say that the only REAL weather control device on TV of that era premiered four days later on rival network ABC as a FAR better THREE part combo Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman story.  Please do NOT watch these back to back; stick with the first two thirds of Isis' run, minus ""Lucky"".  It's well worth it, and ultimately deserves to be rated on ITS OWN MERITS, not compared to its betters unless you're REALLY into female superheroes, in which case you'll probably feel as I do.So, Oh mighty Isis, perk me up from feeling low, entertain me all night with your cool TV show!!!",4,Yet another sweet seventies superheroine,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,3139,"['DISCLAIMER', 'review', 'not', 'apply', 'extras', 'intend', 'view', 'shortly', 'writing', 'this.Oh', 'Mighty', 'Isis', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'cool', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'number', 'spiritual', 'sisters', 'Isis', 'was', 'different', 'type', 'crimebuster', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'one', 'who', 'nice', 'could', 'still', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'staple', 'transition', 'strictly', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'regular', 'programming', 'resumed', 'noon', 'Isis', 'much', 'dorkier', 'male', 'counterpart', 'Shazam', 'a.k.a', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'not', 'quite', 'memorable', 'substantive', 'others', 'bionic', 'Jaime', 'Sommers', 'alter', 'ego', 'was', 'teacher', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'relied', 'magic', 'traced', 'roots', 'back', 'ancient', 'goddess', 'UNLIKE', 'others', 'Isis', 'only', 'had', 'HALF', 'hour', 'herself', 'less', 'when', 'occasional', 'crossover', 'episode', 'saw', 'asking', 'Shazam', 'help', 'something', 'else', 'would', 'become', 'fixture', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'year', 'later', 'would', 'work', 'MUCH', 'better', '.The', 'writing', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'small', 'significant', 'turn', 'worse', 'accompanied', 'Isis', 'short-lived', 'run', 'independent', 'predecessor', 'Joanna', 'Cameron', 'did', ""n't"", 'participate', 'interviews', 'almost', 'too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'enjoy', 'show', ""'ll"", 'also', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'accept', 'magic', 'source', 'Isis', 'powers', 'definite', 'drawback', 'show', 'compared', 'much', 'better', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'Isis', 'literally', 'high', 'most', 'times', 'simply', 'elements', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'much', 'challenge', 'thinking', 'up', 'appropriate', 'rhyming', 'couplets', 'Still', 'capture', 'everyone', 'hurting', 'soul.And', 'end', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'least', 'golden', 'run', 'series', 'be', 'found', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'Standout', 'Fool', 'Dare', 'where', 'truly', 'tender', 'capture', 'bad', 'guys', 'net', 'old', 'tires', 'respectively', 'one', 'later', 'set', 'ghost', 'town', 'where', 'temporarily', 'power-bestowing', 'amulet', 'have', 'students', 'help', 'out', 'miss', 'Lucky', 'death', 'pet', 'too', 'raw', 'real', 'Hitchhikers', 'last', 'disc', 'cavalier', 'treatment', 'serious', 'subject', 'even', 'rest', 'final', 'episodes', 'were', 'getting', 'too', 'serious', 'alter', 'ego', 'Andrea', 'Thomas', 'was', 'beginning', 'talk', 'sound', 'smart', 'alec', 'Dianna', 'Prince', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'second', 'season', 'final', 'two-parter', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'only', 'REAL', 'weather', 'control', 'device', 'TV', 'era', 'premiered', 'four', 'days', 'later', 'rival', 'network', 'ABC', 'FAR', 'better', 'THREE', 'part', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man/Bionic', 'Woman', 'story', 'Please', 'do', 'NOT', 'watch', 'back', 'back', 'stick', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'Isis', 'run', 'Lucky', 'well', 'worth', 'ultimately', 'be', 'rated', 'ITS', 'OWN', 'MERITS', 'not', 'compared', 'betters', ""'re"", 'REALLY', 'female', 'superheroes', 'case', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', 'do.So', 'Oh', 'mighty', 'Isis', 'perk', 'feeling', 'low', 'entertain', 'night', 'cool', 'TV', 'show']",The Secrets of Isis - The Complete Series

I looked her up on imdb and discovered that the woman, JoAnna Cameron, played the titular heroine in the 70s Saturday morning series ""The Secrets of Isis.""This explains my interest in picking up this ""Isis"" dvd set, as I only vaguely recall the show as a kid; so there's very little nostalgic factor with me.The set features all 22 episodes on two dvds and a handful of extras, including a 2-hour piece involving interviews with producers and stars, etc.The show beat out the similar primetime series ""Wonder Woman,"" debuting Sept. 9, 1975. ""Wonder Woman"" didn't appear until sometime in 1976.""The Secrets of Isis"" was a low-budget Saturday morning series and obviously geared toward kids. Each episode has a moral; the cast is upbeat, likable and multi-cultural; the vibe is simple and wholesome; and the F/X are cheap. Each segment only runs 20 minutes (not including credits) and the last two episodes feature Captain Marvel of ""Shazam!"" All that said, the show possesses a certain charm. One can't help but respect that JoAnna Cameron took the role seriously.In the interview section the producers admit that they chose JoAnna to play Isis because she had ""great legs."" And so she does. In fact, it's the first thing I noticed about her when I saw that episode of ""Columbo."" JoAnna is fairly short and kind of thin, but curvy at the same time. In any case, her legs are truly exquisite. Her face and presence also exude great intelligence and poise. A very uniquely beautiful woman, to say the least. Lynda Carter of ""Wonder Woman,"" by contrast, was tall and ultra-voluptuous (I personally get sick at the sight of nigh-anorexic women). Another great 70s beauty was Erin Gray of ""Buck Rogers.""BOTTOME LINE: Despite its numerous shortcomings noted above, ""The Secrets of Isis"" is worth picking up for those nostalgic of the show or those fascinated by JoAnna Cameron's great beauty, intelligence and poise; or both.
