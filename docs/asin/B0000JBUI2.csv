There are only two characters in the movie so I was surprised at how it kept my attention. At times it seems a little slow because you see the same location over and over again.Tara Reid and Kip Pardue star in this suspenseful film about newlyweds on their honeymoon in a deserted cabin on an island surrounded by water.Tara's character, Julianne can't swim and she is more of n upperclass girl that her husband Kip's character, Mitch.They start out a very lovable couple but things turn ugly when Mitch turns completely jealous and starts acting all crazy.He won't let her leave the island-EVER! Well I've said enough~ The film is worth watching. It is actually very interesting and I do not think it got the right amount of publicity it could have gotten.The DVD extras are okay but could have been a little better.

782063,A26HD3S38PLD5A,B0000JBUI2,"BO BO BOB ""WESLEY""","[0, 0]","Kip Pardue(Mitch), one of those young up-and -coming actors , who may never co-star with Denzel Washington or Julia Roberts, but has all of the ability too. He is as versitale as Jack and commands the screen like Meryl, but may forever reside in the deminsion of B-movies. From a gay, sympathetic man dying of aids, looking for his place  in the world in Loggerheads to a psycho in Devil's Pond, out to shut out the rest of the world from he and his obsession with his new bride, by imprisoning his unsusspecting new wife on and island, he shows a range of skills that not every actor posseses. Tara Reid(Juliane) has improved immensely from the only other film I have seen her in. She shows a range of emotion , with such believability. The fewer the people in  a film, the more the responsibility is to deliver a believable performance. Add to that the ingrediants of one of those few transfroming from ""dream mate"" to psycho in an hour and thirty minutes and the other person(people) has to play off of that and you have one heck of a challenge.  This bar is so much more harder to reach when you only have two peope throughout the entire movie and those two people are isolated for 99% of the movie on an island and/or in the wilderness. The only success from the movie can only come from the answer to one question? Were they beleiveable?  As for this move, the answer is an unequivicable YES. It never  hurts to have a well written script.I stayed glued throughout. Would recommend to anyone. This is not jus one of the best B-rated movies. Clearly , it should be among and above many in the A-class movies. I am looking for to more from both actors. I also happen to be an enormous fan of the ""Isolated in the Wilderness, Struggling to Survive, While a Maniac is on the Loose"" genre.

She does a complete turn in this film which has a dark edge to it, and it is quite believable. The photography is amazing as it adds to the chilling atmosphere.

I didn't need the cover to tell me that this guy wasn't going to let her off the island, it was a given. Some people seemed to believe that there should have been more of a supernatural element happening in the movie, but in this case i was actually pleased that it wasn't present here. This movie is expertly executed for character full effect, and the entire film except the opening is a character play of these two newlyweds and how the wife is going to find a way to get away from her maniacal new groom. There isn't excessive gore or moments of fake suspense or some ridiculous force at work here, its just the human drama of a woman against her new hubby. Sometimes we need a good drama like this that takes us away from all the fakery and roots us to our seat by way of excellent human acting and all that comes with it. I applaud the director and writers of this little gem that delivers a near perfect hour and a half of pure humanity in its best form for her bravery and cunning, and his detestable overbearing and sick behavior.

The story is not original and - most of all - is not gripping and tense.A young middle class woman (Tara Reid) married with a young and handsome guy (Pardue) just to find out in a few days that her husband is a psycho and a really violent one. He imprisioned her in a kind of island in the center of a lake and there start her nightmare and her fight to break free.In fact, that's all the story here. And a story without any background to give any motive at all to the sick personality of the husband. The characters seem to be launched in an absurd situation just to play during ninety minutes a ludicrous and lame game of cat and mouse. Because of that, in a few minutes the viewer became tired with the movie and loses all the interest with the destiny of poor and beautiful Julianne, played by Tara Reid.I think that a good suspense movie needs more than violence, screams and a psycho characther with a mad look on his face to be a really good movie.

Then while on their geteway trip to romance, he decides its time to live like Amish people by learning to live a life like Mary in 'Little House on the Prairie' because according to him, true love cannot be obtain living a pampered princess life style in modern civilization. According to Mr. Adams here, true love is to be his obedient while he does the manly things like hunting for food in the great outdoors then coming home where his wife should be ready and willing for passionate love. She doesn't like this crap from the very start so you probably know whats going to happen next.

When they arrive at their secluded honeymoon getaway, she shouts she is free from the bonds of her mother's world, the society she claims to want freedom from.  Mitch decides to give her that freedom to the extreme.  He imprisons her on this little island in the middle of nowhere and refuses to let her leave.  He will go to any lengths to keep her there, so she can give him children and live in a hunky dory kind of world.  I Don't think that's what sweet Julianne has in mind.DEVIL'S POND is a contrived piece of fluff, but due to the capable performances of Kip Pardue and Tara Reid, the film manages to involve us and cheer Julianne on in her freedom attempts.  Why she married this clod in the first place remains a mystery, but dramatic license justifies the implausibility that some kind of signs weren't evident during their courtship.

It should have been called &quot;Devil's Lake.&quot;Devil's Pond stars Tara Reid as Julianna and Kip Pardue as Mitch. They portray newlyweds who spend their honeymoon in a small cabin on a small island located in the middle of a lake. Very romantic!For the first few days everything is serene. However, tension builds as Julianna, wanting to get in touch with her mother, grows despondent as she discovers that her cell phone is useless in this remote setting. Also adding to her discomfort is the fact that she cannot swim and has a fear of the water. Mitch is unsympathetic to her dilemma and his impatience with her begins to build. The situation deteriorates until things become violent. Mitch hold Julianna captive and she attempts to escape and is forced to confront her phobias in the process.The logic surrounding Mitch's mentality is confusing. One minute he is the dream husband and the next he turns into a maniac with no prior clues to his instability.Let's examine the first half of this movie carefully and, for the moment, remove his irrational violence. Much of Mitch's frustration with Julianna stems from the fact that she constantly wants to call her mother. I have to admit, I cannot help but to sympathize with Mitch. They are married, she of legal age and out of high school. What does she need to call her mother for? It was a foregone conclusion that they were going to spend their honeymoon alone together away from everything. They were only going to be gone for two weeks. Can't Julianna cut the cord long enough to allow Mitch two uninterrupted weeks to enjoy his beautiful new bride before they have to go back to civilization?Then comes a revelation. As Julianna becomes wary of Mitch, she discovers that he had been a secret admirer of hers from afar before they met. She finds scraps of paper that contained pencil drawings she made before their first encounter at a bus stop (She's an artist.)Apparently, Mitch picked them up and kept them after she had discarded them. She also learns that their &quot;chance&quot; encounter was in fact orchestrated by Mitch so that he could meet and date the girl of his dreams. All of this unnerves her. My question is: Why? Many guys usually try tactics like these to meet women and break the ice. She calls him a stalker but Mitch did not exhibit any behavior usually associated with stalking. This might include obscene phone calls, unwanted and suggestive letters, etc. By all accounts, they met, he courted and wooed her, displaying qualities she found appealing. They fell in love and got married. Their courtship was typical and by the numbers. Where's the creepiness?Of course his behavior takes an inexplicable and sudden turn and she doesn't see it coming. If someone is as loose cannon as he is supposed to be, she most certainly would have seen traces of it by this time.Then there is the subplot concerning the death of Mitch's  father. How on Earth did he kill his father, bury him out there and not raise any suspicion? This little plot device was thrown in to validate Julianna's fears but it was given no thought at all.The most ludicrious part of the movie was the ending. After she wins the conflict, she chains him up (leaving the shotgun within his reach by the way), and, with no prior swimming lessons at all, SWIMS ACROSS THE LAKE ON HER OWN!!! Mind you, the lake is very deep, much too deep to wade across. Then when she reaches the other side, MITCH SHOOTS HIMSELF!!! The End.One star for Tara Reid's looks and acting which wasn't bad.
