1085185,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B000S6LP5K,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[2, 2]","Season two (2) of ""Waking the Dead"" finds the splendid ""cold case"" unit splendidly solving some horrendous cases that have remained unsolved for a long time and in some instances have ""tie-ins"" with crimes that are occurring in the ""now"".  I found Season Two (2) to be even better than Season One (1).Season two (2) stories are so well written and acted by all.  The direction is superb.  The actors that comprise the cold case unit are so very good; they seem to have really ""settled into"" the roles that they are playing.  What I love so much about this show is that each character is very sure of his/her own expertise. Therefore, there are some battles between all with Trevor Eve as the Unit's leader, DCI Boyd having to solve these ""battles"" in a sometimes gruff manner.  Eve is so very good in this show.  I also really adore actress Sue Johnston as the psychologist--she kind of keeps DCI Boyd (Trevor Eve) ""grounded"" in  sometimes an amusing way.If you want to experience a really good mystery/detective show that I feel is created for adults or people with mature minds, buy Season two (2) of ""Waking the Dead"".

No build-up of anger, just explosions.  The acting seemed brittle.  But then the actors calmed down in subsequent shows and had some chemistry.In this season, they are fabulous.  They have settled into their roles and relationships and work as a team.  The writing seems better, too.  They actually are witty and seem more believable.  The plots were always good and each one different. The plots are fast-paced - it never gets dull.  It's a combination of footwork, interviewing and forensics.  They don't seem to follow a formula.  This is a very engaging series, with attractive scenery with some good shots of London.If you like British police procedurals, this is an excellent example of one.
