811843,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0001NBNFW,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[96, 107]","Voyager's second season combined everything we like about Star Trek and took it to new heights. This season is, in my mind, the show's best; it is certainly the last one where the writers had any kind of focus as to what was going to happen on the show. One great episode after another is what this season delivered, along with a deeper sense of the crew of this little ship, not to mention fantastic science-fiction. What more could a fan ask for?This season pulls off all of the exposition that the truncated first season did not. We only gleaned general facts about the crew from the first year, but everyone had an episode to shine here. My favorite episode here is ""Projections."" I'm a sucker for those ""what-is-real?"" storylines. It is a solid episode, with the Doctor being more than just smug and surly (although I love it, it can only go so far). Robert Picardo plays disturbed and confused, and Reg Barclay makes a guest appearance. Next is ""Non Sequitur,"" a high-concept episode in which we see an alternate reality where Harry is an engineer on Earth and Tom is a billiards-shooting loser. Like the season that it is a part of, it is a great synthesis of sci-fi storytelling and character exposition. I also loved ""Meld,"" a great Tuvok episode that guest-starred Brad Dourif as a psychopathic killer that Tuvok is obsessed with understanding. The episode examined the enigma of sociopathic killings and it did it in a very effective way. Dourif is one of the highest-caliber guest actors ever to appear on any Trek show, and he is able to be so completely menacing and convincingly psychotic, yet at the same time calm and rational, his performance is reminiscent or Anthony Hopkins' turn as Hannibal Lecter. He is completely mesmerizing. ""The Thaw"" metaphorically looked at how people allow fear to control their lives, with a surreal, Kafka-esque perspective that made it distinctive. ""Resistance"" added more dimension to Janeway by showing how far she was willing to go to save her crew, plus a genuinely potent emotional payoff at the end. The Kazon remain a persistent enemy, leading to the best Star Trek cliffhanger ever (Basics, Part I) that makes things really look hopeless for the crew. There was also a visit from Q in ""Death Wish"" to round out the season.In addition, there was lots of science fiction here, rather than the sprawling space opera the show would turn into later. Now, don't get me wrong, I love space opera, but not of the sprawling variety. The sci-fi episodes included ""Twisted,"" with Voyager being reconfigured by an unknown force, ""Prototype,"" a look at cyber ethics, ""Threshold,"" which had Tom breaking a seemingly impossible barrier, with disastrous results. ""Tuvix"" is one of the most powerful episodes of the season, and although the setup sounds cheesy, even ridiculous, it is a fine morality play of the highest order. Basically, Neelix and Tuvok get infused due to a transporter accident, giving birth to a new, fully realized and sentient creature. The bulk of the episode's portent has to do with Janeway's decision:  can she deny this new entity existence, effectively kill it, just to save her crewmen, and if not, will she be killing them? I hope it is obvious that this would bring up all sorts of moral questions that the episode sets out to answer. Although the ending is obvious, it actually makes the whole episode more agonizing. In the end, though, what impressed me the most was that there wasn't an ending where everyone was happy, or where they were even sure that they had done the right thing. This was (unfortunately) a rarity in TNG and TOS, where a Deus ex machina would often present itself at the last second, leaving the captain not to have to make a difficult and costly choice. It was here that I began to think that Voyager might become an equal to Deep Space Nine:  it had here the maturity to allow its characters to have to make the hard choices, no tricks, no Q to rescue the planet from disaster, no Ensign Wesley to save the ship, no pressing the old reset button and turning back the clock, no easy way out. And for the time being, it did.",5,Stellar Season of Television,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,4123,"['Voyager', 'second', 'season', 'combined', 'everything', 'like', 'Star', 'Trek', 'took', 'new', 'heights', 'season', 'mind', 'show', 'best', 'certainly', 'last', 'one', 'where', 'writers', 'had', 'kind', 'focus', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'show', 'One', 'great', 'episode', 'what', 'season', 'delivered', 'deeper', 'sense', 'crew', 'little', 'ship', 'not', 'mention', 'fantastic', 'science-fiction', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'fan', 'ask', 'season', 'exposition', 'truncated', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'only', 'gleaned', 'general', 'facts', 'crew', 'first', 'year', 'everyone', 'had', 'episode', 'shine', 'here', 'My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'here', 'Projections', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'what-is-real', 'storylines', 'solid', 'episode', 'Doctor', 'being', 'more', 'just', 'smug', 'surly', 'love', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'disturbed', 'confused', 'Reg', 'Barclay', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Next', 'Non', 'Sequitur', 'high-concept', 'episode', 'see', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'Harry', 'engineer', 'Earth', 'Tom', 'billiards-shooting', 'loser', 'season', 'part', 'great', 'synthesis', 'sci-fi', 'storytelling', 'character', 'exposition', 'also', 'loved', 'Meld', 'great', 'Tuvok', 'episode', 'guest-starred', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'Tuvok', 'obsessed', 'understanding', 'episode', 'examined', 'enigma', 'sociopathic', 'killings', 'did', 'very', 'effective', 'way', 'Dourif', 'one', 'highest-caliber', 'guest', 'actors', 'ever', 'appear', 'Trek', 'show', 'able', 'be', 'so', 'completely', 'menacing', 'convincingly', 'psychotic', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'calm', 'rational', 'performance', 'reminiscent', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'turn', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'completely', 'mesmerizing', 'Thaw', 'metaphorically', 'looked', 'how', 'people', 'allow', 'fear', 'control', 'lives', 'surreal', 'Kafka-esque', 'perspective', 'made', 'distinctive', 'Resistance', 'added', 'more', 'dimension', 'Janeway', 'showing', 'how', 'far', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'save', 'crew', 'genuinely', 'potent', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'end', 'Kazon', 'remain', 'persistent', 'enemy', 'leading', 'best', 'Star', 'Trek', 'cliffhanger', 'ever', 'Basics', 'Part', 'things', 'really', 'look', 'hopeless', 'crew', 'was', 'also', 'visit', 'Q', 'Death', 'Wish', 'round', 'out', 'season.In', 'addition', 'was', 'lots', 'science', 'fiction', 'here', 'rather', 'sprawling', 'space', 'show', 'would', 'turn', 'later', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'space', 'opera', 'not', 'sprawling', 'variety', 'sci-fi', 'episodes', 'included', 'Twisted', 'Voyager', 'being', 'reconfigured', 'unknown', 'force', 'Prototype', 'look', 'cyber', 'ethics', 'Threshold', 'had', 'Tom', 'breaking', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'barrier', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Tuvix', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'episodes', 'season', 'setup', 'cheesy', 'even', 'ridiculous', 'fine', 'morality', 'play', 'highest', 'order', 'Basically', 'Neelix', 'Tuvok', 'get', 'infused', 'due', 'transporter', 'accident', 'giving', 'birth', 'new', 'fully', 'realized', 'sentient', 'creature', 'bulk', 'episode', 'portent', 'do', 'Janeway', 'decision', 'can', 'deny', 'new', 'entity', 'existence', 'effectively', 'kill', 'just', 'save', 'crewmen', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'killing', 'hope', 'obvious', 'would', 'bring', 'up', 'sorts', 'moral', 'questions', 'episode', 'out', 'answer', 'ending', 'obvious', 'actually', 'whole', 'episode', 'more', 'agonizing', 'end', 'though', 'what', 'impressed', 'most', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'ending', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'happy', 'where', 'were', 'even', 'sure', 'had', 'done', 'right', 'thing', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'rarity', 'TNG', 'TOS', 'where', 'Deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'would', 'often', 'present', 'last', 'second', 'leaving', 'captain', 'not', 'have', 'make', 'difficult', 'costly', 'choice', 'was', 'here', 'began', 'think', 'Voyager', 'might', 'become', 'equal', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'had', 'here', 'maturity', 'allow', 'characters', 'have', 'make', 'hard', 'choices', 'tricks', 'Q', 'rescue', 'planet', 'disaster', 'Ensign', 'Wesley', 'save', 'ship', 'pressing', 'old', 'reset', 'button', 'turning', 'back', 'clock', 'easy', 'way', 'time', 'being', 'did']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Second Season

811847,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B0001NBNFW,Alice L. Moore,"[1, 1]","This is the 2nd season of Star Trek Voyager.  This is a season like the first of uneven quality.What I liked:  There were interesting episodes those being ""Lifesigns""(a doctor's prescribed treatment vs. a patients wishes), ""The Thaw""(the Cirque du Soleil episode with a fine performance by Michael McKean), ""Investigations""(finding sedition within the Voyager crew).  The series was not much for developing story arcs.  The writers didn't pretend to do so. There were interesting species such as the Vidians.  They were not a ""disposable hostile"" type of people.  They had a devastating disease but ahd a monstrous way to deal with it.  They only had a few stories in this season.What I didn't like:  The episodes ""37s""(The crew has an opportunity to settle on an earth like planet).  There was the lack of character development as well.  The bad guys of the series, the Kazon, are little more than dime store Klingons with none of the redeeming qualities of the latter.  Seska, the crewmember who leaves Voyager, is shown as a traitor.  Why?  Season 2 doesn't cover this; a thumbnail recap would have helped.  That she's a Cardassian spy?  Not enough.  It would have been far more interesting to have her as a Sharon the Cylon type/someone who comes back as a crewmember but is never completely trusted.Many fault the Star Trek franchise for being too idealistic and not ""dark and edgy""(those ""dark and edgy"" series IMHO will probably be doomed to be dated as Lava Lamps, Disco, and Leg warmers).  This is not a problem for this reviewer.  However, a little more character development would help.

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[1, 1]","Star Trek was entering it's 30'th anniversary when Star Trek Voyager began it's sophmore season so there was a great deal of hoopla surrounding this season. In terms of the show the feeling was different.Unlike in the first season where the crew of Voyager were dealing with all their new challanges,this season found them truly facing the unknown from another ""cartaker"" trying to manipulate Kes in ""Cold Fire"" to Janeway meeting up with her hero Amelia Earheart in 'The 37's'. This also marks the first appearance of Q in this series,on this occasion moderating a fellow Q's wish to commit suicide in the excellent and topical 'Death Wish'. The doctor also found love and Chakotay discovered an ancient riddle of his people in 'Tattoo';many of the episodes in this season had a slightly surreal and mystical bent as everything of familiarity to the Voyager crew started to be questioned. Even in 'Alliances"" Janeway cites the Delta Quadrant as a region of space without many rules.This season also works out some kinks in the shows construction;the Kazon were a rather uninteresting and poorly written adversary and came off as little more then a poor man's Klingon. So a series of story arcs come into play during this season in which they made their exit;a trader on the Voyager crew betrays unformation to the equally tretchurous Seska until being foiled by Neelix. Then Seska lies to Chakotay about having his baby (it's actually the Kazon Cullah's) and,in the cliffhanger the Kazon story is concluded after a failed attempt by Seska to commandere the ship. Over time this is probably the Voyager season I've seen the most because of all the type surrounding the anniversary year,also because I think many Star Trek fans were looking for any signs of sophmore slump. Well there really wasn't;just some weaker moments where the kinks of the series were being ironed out.

811855,A1D9V11QUHXENQ,B0001NBNFW,"Big Al ""Alan Rivire""","[0, 1]","*Spoiler Alert* This review contains spoilers.This episode is probably one of the worst in the Voyager series.  The story is pretty dumb; it goes like this: Tom Paris breaks the warp 10 barrier in a ""transwrap"" flight onboard a Delta Flyer christened Cochrane.  As a result, he is slowly reverting to the reptilian form of his human ancestors.  He kidnaps Captain Janeway, and makes a second transwarp flight with her.  They wind up in a tropical swarm as reptiles with three reptilian offspring.  The Voyager crew restores Paris and Janeway to human form with an anti-proton treatment.  I thought the Voyager series writers could do better than that.  However, one thing is noteworthy in this episode; it is the way warp speed is re-defined.  Throughout the Original series and the Next Generation series, warp speed was defined asVelocity = Warp Factor raised to the 3rd power X The Speed of Light.Therefore, warp 1 is 1 X 1 X 1 = the speed of light, warp 2 is 2 X 2 X 2 = 8 times the speed of light and so on.  There was no limit on the value of the warp factor.  In fact, in the last episode of the Next Gen series All Good Things, Admiral William Riker flew the future Enterprise at warp 13.

There was just something about her performance in this episode that annoyed me to tears. I think it's cause most of the time she is doing ""The Rock"" eyebrow stare as a substitute for acting. And you see a lot of that here because almost everyone else is absent (no B'Elanna, Chakotay, Kes, Paris, etc)But my personal nit-picking aside it's still enjoyable and I recommend watching it.

811858,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B0001NBNFW,Brandon J. Smith,"[1, 1]","It's fitting that this season has an episode in which Voyager is duplicated, as this season demonstrated, perhaps better than any other, just how good or bad the show could be from episode to episode, especially in the early years.Limiting my comments to just a few representative episodes: Voyager Season 2 has the much-maligned ""Threshold"" and the awful ""The Thaw."" These are truly Voyager at its worst: bad ideas, poorly executed. ""Threshold"" could have been good, as it begins with an interesting premise, but the show degenerates into sheer stupidity. Along with it, ""The Thaw"" starts lamely and stays that way throughout. These two are best put aside and forgotten.On the other hand, the season closes with a very strong set of episodes. ""Tuvix"" explores an interesting idea and, though it could have been improved in some ways, nevertheless builds to a kind of morally ambiguous conclusion that is rarely seen in this series. Like the doctor, I don't agree with Captain Janeway's final decision, but I very much enjoyed watching her deal with it. If only these emotions had carried through to future episodes, there could have been some interesting ramifications.""Resolutions"" is an interesting exploration of Janeway and Chakotay's relationship, and asks the question of whether desperately trying to return home has been the right choice for them and the Voyager crew. Again in this episode, the conclusion is bittersweet, and I think the show is all the better for it.And the season finale, ""Basics, Part I,"" has a great conflict and genuine tension. The return of a nasty villain and the Voyager crew in a real predicament with a cliffhanger ending is the perfect formula to close out the season.When Voyager first aired, I was frustrated by its weaknesses more than I am now. To my pleasant surprise, I think Voyager has aged rather well. Though the season begins somewhat weakly, and the ""Threshold"" and ""The Thaw"" episodes are terrible, there's much to enjoy. There are better seasons than this, but it's certainly worthwhile viewing, and I'm sure the finale will have you rushing to start on season 3.",4,"Uneven Season, But Much to Enjoy",1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2116,"['fitting', 'season', 'episode', 'Voyager', 'duplicated', 'season', 'demonstrated', 'perhaps', 'better', 'other', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'bad', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'episode', 'episode', 'especially', 'early', 'years.Limiting', 'comments', 'just', 'few', 'representative', 'episodes', 'Voyager', 'Season', '2', 'much-maligned', 'Threshold', 'awful', 'Thaw', 'are', 'truly', 'Voyager', 'worst', 'bad', 'ideas', 'poorly', 'executed', 'Threshold', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'interesting', 'premise', 'show', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'Thaw', 'lamely', 'stays', 'way', 'two', 'are', 'best', 'put', 'aside', 'forgotten.On', 'other', 'hand', 'season', 'very', 'strong', 'set', 'episodes', 'Tuvix', 'interesting', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'ways', 'nevertheless', 'kind', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'conclusion', 'rarely', 'seen', 'series', 'doctor', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'final', 'decision', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'deal', 'only', 'emotions', 'had', 'carried', 'future', 'episodes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'ramifications', 'Resolutions', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'Janeway', 'Chakotay', 'relationship', 'question', 'desperately', 'trying', 'return', 'home', 'been', 'right', 'choice', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'Again', 'episode', 'conclusion', 'bittersweet', 'think', 'show', 'better', 'it.And', 'season', 'finale', 'Basics', 'Part', 'great', 'conflict', 'genuine', 'tension', 'return', 'nasty', 'villain', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'real', 'predicament', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'perfect', 'formula', 'close', 'out', 'season.When', 'Voyager', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'frustrated', 'weaknesses', 'more', 'am', 'now', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'think', 'Voyager', 'aged', 'rather', 'well', 'season', 'somewhat', 'weakly', 'Threshold', 'Thaw', 'episodes', 'are', 'terrible', 'much', 'enjoy', 'are', 'better', 'seasons', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'finale', 'will', 'have', 'rushing', 'start', 'season', '3']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Second Season

Season 2 does not have this problem. From start to finish, it was a season that left me wanting to watch just one more episode before going to bed and then rewatching them. Every main character is given a chance to shine from Tuvok going berserk in Meld to Torres dealing with a delusional mega-bomb to Chakotay dealing with Seska and the Kazon (with a great return of Aron &quot;Nog&quot; Eisenberg as a young Kazon ready to earn his name by attempting to kill Chakotay in Initiations) in a couple of episodes. I also enjoyed the multi-episode plot arc with Paris becoming more and more of a jerk that meshes with the rogue Starfleeter who was busy betraying his comrades to the Kazon and the pregnant crewmember and her improbable baby. There were plenty of my favorite type of episodes, the &quot;what is real/what is actually going on here&quot; concept. Watching the Doctor announce, to the Viidean he was hot for, in the middle of surgery--like he was asking her to pass the scalpel--that he was attracted to her made me cringe with delight and it made me glad that this series continued the fish out of water/emotionally clueless character that each series has employed (Spock, Data, Odo, and the EMH Doctor). Finally, the season finale, Basics Part 1 was a romping kick in the stomach that has me desperately awaiting for the release of season 3 so I can see how the crew regains their lost ship from, as my friend calls them, the garbage head Kazons.

811860,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,B0001NBNFW,Brian A. Wolters,"[1, 1]","I want to say that as a Star Trek fan, I wasn't totally thrilled with Voyager when it originally aired. I found it lacking in comparison to the excellent Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5 which I was watching at the same time. But now re-watching the series on DVD, I have come to really enjoy the adventures of the Voyager crew. The second season of Voyager moved us a little closer to the alpha quadrant and at the same time, expanded the story of the crew working together to find their way home.Season 2 was a lot stronger than I remembered. After a slow and uneven start to the reason, the season really picked up with the episode RESISTANCE. This was a simple but effective and touching episode about oppression and the lengths the crew would go to get what they need to survive. Joel Grey was outstanding. MELD was a very interesting look into the mind of a killer that only Star Trek could pull off. DEATH WISH introduced Q to the series and had a very interesting argument presented. THE THAW was a very interesting take on making fear personified and it was capped off by an amazing ending. And TUVIX was another good argument, this time the right to life and put Janeway in a very tough position.With the excellent episodes, I have to point out that there were many weak moments in the season. The whole Kazon/Jonas thing was very weak and it felt forced. It did not flow well as arcing stories did on DS9 or B5. I was kind of glad when the Jonas thread was over. THRESHOLD is usually on the top of the list of worst episodes and sadly, it came from this season. I didn't find it as bad as I remembered but it isn't very re-watchable. RESOLUTIONS was an excellent episode but it lost a huge opportunity in exploring a possible relationship between Janeway and Chakotay. They give it all but 5 minutes of screen time and more time should have been devoted to it. This episode screamed to be a 2 parter. As mentioned, the early 1/3 of the season was kind of weak and featured the worst of the season. Oh, and the amount of shuttle accidents are laughable. Finally, the whole spit crew story was pretty much a non-factor this season and pretty much totally dropped in seasons to come.This season could have been great but instead came across as uneven and eventually strong. Better seasons of Voyager were ahead but Season 2 had many standouts and I can highly recommend this season.",3,Good Season That Could Have Been Awesome,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,2387,"['want', 'say', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'thrilled', 'Voyager', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'found', 'lacking', 'comparison', 'excellent', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'watching', 'same', 'time', 'now', 're-watching', 'series', 'DVD', 'have', 'come', 'really', 'enjoy', 'adventures', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'second', 'season', 'Voyager', 'moved', 'little', 'closer', 'alpha', 'quadrant', 'same', 'time', 'expanded', 'story', 'crew', 'working', 'together', 'find', 'way', 'home.Season', '2', 'was', 'lot', 'stronger', 'remembered', 'slow', 'uneven', 'start', 'reason', 'season', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'episode', 'RESISTANCE', 'was', 'simple', 'effective', 'touching', 'episode', 'oppression', 'lengths', 'crew', 'would', 'go', 'get', 'what', 'need', 'survive', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'was', 'outstanding', 'MELD', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'mind', 'killer', 'only', 'Star', 'Trek', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'introduced', 'Q', 'series', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'argument', 'presented', 'THAW', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'take', 'making', 'fear', 'personified', 'was', 'capped', 'off', 'amazing', 'ending', 'TUVIX', 'was', 'good', 'argument', 'time', 'right', 'life', 'put', 'Janeway', 'very', 'tough', 'position.With', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'were', 'many', 'weak', 'moments', 'season', 'whole', 'Kazon/Jonas', 'thing', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'felt', 'forced', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'well', 'arcing', 'stories', 'did', 'DS9', 'B5', 'was', 'kind', 'glad', 'when', 'Jonas', 'thread', 'was', 'over', 'THRESHOLD', 'usually', 'top', 'list', 'worst', 'episodes', 'sadly', 'came', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'as', 'bad', 'remembered', ""n't"", 'very', 're-watchable', 'RESOLUTIONS', 'was', 'excellent', 'episode', 'lost', 'huge', 'opportunity', 'exploring', 'possible', 'relationship', 'Janeway', 'Chakotay', 'give', '5', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'more', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'episode', 'screamed', 'be', '2', 'parter', 'mentioned', 'early', '1/3', 'season', 'was', 'kind', 'weak', 'featured', 'worst', 'season', 'Oh', 'amount', 'shuttle', 'accidents', 'are', 'laughable', 'Finally', 'whole', 'spit', 'crew', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-factor', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'totally', 'dropped', 'seasons', 'come.This', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'instead', 'came', 'uneven', 'eventually', 'strong', 'Better', 'seasons', 'Voyager', 'were', 'ahead', 'Season', '2', 'had', 'many', 'standouts', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'season']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Second Season

Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The 37's"" in which the Voyager discovers a 1936 Ford truck floating through random space. The vehicle soon leads them to the discovery of several cryogenic chambers that contain humans abducted by aliens during the 1930s, among them - Amelia Earhart and her navigator... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Tatoo"" in which Commander Chakotay attempts to establish contact with the beings his ancestors named the ""Sky Spirits"" after discovering a religious symbol from his home planet, and ""Deathwish"" in which Q seeks asylum aboard the Voyager while threatening suicide...Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek: Voyager (Season 2)

811869,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B0001NBNFW,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[9, 15]","The second season continued Rick Berman's stiff attempt to make the show different, except most stories were unmemorable and many fought each other for, what writer David McIntee called, ""maximum dullness"". Once upon a time, Brannon Braga was a talented writer, penning many of the best TNG stories. But now, as the show began year two, he was a shadow of what he once was; more YES man than a writer. The Braga penned Non Sequitur had no real drama, because you knew Harry was going to get back to Voyager and Cold Fire, a belated sequel to the series opener, was filled with many bland ideas and stretched the mind to wonder what Braga was actually trying to say. Then there was Threshold (Robert Duncan McNeill's favorite episode, apparently), which was perhaps the worst episode ever produced in the Trek canon. It was a high concept story that once again showed Trek putting the cart before the horse; hitching their ideas on the thinnest of threads.One actress I like from the show, was Roxann Dawson, who could take a nothing script and turn it into something special, such as with Prototype. While the script added nothing to the arc and turned out rather silly, her performance made you want to watch the show, even though it could risk death from boredom. There were some highlights of season two, including Meld, which had the always-reliable bad guy character actor Brad Dourif delivering a truly subtle and creepy performance. And only a guest star turn by Joel Grey in Resistance saved that episode. And while not original in any stretch of the word, with uninteresting bad guys and a story that has no real motivation, Grey does salvage the hour.There was, also, the marvelous return of Q. If you look beyond the obvious ratings stunt the show was, Death Wish was well acted and the script actually works (and mostly because Brannon Braga did not write it). And while the Vidiians make another appearance, the second season is dominated by the Kazon and Tom, Tuvok and Janeway's plan to root out a spy (another one!) on Voyager. Once again, I must mention how silly the Kazons really are and how the only high point was actor Anthony de Longis performance. He brought a menace to the role of Culluh, but sadly he was hobbled with Seska, a shrew if there was one. Thaw was just plain creepy, but in the good sense. Some have said that this show was a real throw back to TOS, at least in the set design. I say that this is what made the show work. It was by means no budget breaker, but its surreal setting and Michael McKean's queer performance really makes the show. As a person who thinks clowns are scary to begin with, I found the idea of people dying by being scared to death really frightening. So, the rest of season two rambled on, but the show still had not found its space legs and concluded with a cliffhanger that was not as good as it should have been.Basics began to resolve the Kazon issue, but beyond Dourif's return as Suder, the show lacked any sense of threat and it was fairly obvious the crew was going to lose. And stranding the crew on the planet Hannon 4 was out of character for the Kazon, also. However, maybe Seska did have a moral streak running through her. Personally, Culluh should've killed them. While Rick Berman went on to say that to ""keep any kind of substantial conflict going between the Maquis and the Starfleet characters on the show was going to be too disruptive to the Star Trek family we were trying to cement on this ship, lost out there in the Delta Quadrant. We have, from time to time, revisited the whole Maquis question, but I don't think it was a mistake to have minimized the 'warring parties aboard the same ship' concept, so to speak. And it certainly was in keeping with Gene Roddenberry's feeling of trying to minimize conflicts between regular characters."" However, this view was not corroborated by co-creator Michael Piller, who said on the official Star Trek site, ""The one thing that I look back on and think would have made the series more interesting would have been to keep more conflict going between the Maquis and the Starfleet characters, at least during the first season or two. I think there was an opportunity missed early on to slowly create a group of characters that had to grow to know and trust one another. Because of those concerns, we essentially solved the conflicts and they were a pretty bonded crew probably from episode three or four on.""",3,The Temporal Reset Button Show,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,4437,"['second', 'season', 'continued', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'stiff', 'attempt', 'make', 'show', 'different', 'most', 'stories', 'were', 'unmemorable', 'many', 'fought', 'other', 'what', 'writer', 'David', 'McIntee', 'called', 'maximum', 'dullness', 'Once', 'time', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'was', 'talented', 'writer', 'penning', 'many', 'best', 'TNG', 'stories', 'now', 'show', 'began', 'year', 'two', 'was', 'shadow', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'more', 'YES', 'man', 'writer', 'Braga', 'penned', 'Non', 'Sequitur', 'had', 'real', 'drama', 'knew', 'Harry', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'back', 'Voyager', 'Cold', 'Fire', 'belated', 'sequel', 'series', 'opener', 'was', 'filled', 'many', 'bland', 'ideas', 'stretched', 'mind', 'wonder', 'what', 'Braga', 'was', 'actually', 'trying', 'say', 'Then', 'was', 'Threshold', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', 'favorite', 'episode', 'apparently', 'was', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'episode', 'ever', 'produced', 'Trek', 'canon', 'was', 'high', 'concept', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'showed', 'Trek', 'putting', 'cart', 'horse', 'hitching', 'ideas', 'thinnest', 'threads.One', 'actress', 'like', 'show', 'was', 'Roxann', 'Dawson', 'who', 'could', 'take', 'nothing', 'script', 'turn', 'something', 'special', 'such', 'Prototype', 'script', 'added', 'nothing', 'arc', 'turned', 'out', 'rather', 'silly', 'performance', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'even', 'could', 'risk', 'death', 'boredom', 'were', 'highlights', 'season', 'two', 'including', 'Meld', 'had', 'always-reliable', 'bad', 'guy', 'character', 'actor', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'delivering', 'truly', 'subtle', 'creepy', 'performance', 'only', 'guest', 'star', 'turn', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Resistance', 'saved', 'episode', 'not', 'original', 'stretch', 'word', 'uninteresting', 'bad', 'guys', 'story', 'real', 'motivation', 'Grey', 'salvage', 'hour.There', 'was', 'also', 'marvelous', 'return', 'Q', 'look', 'obvious', 'ratings', 'stunt', 'show', 'was', 'Death', 'Wish', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'script', 'actually', 'mostly', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'Vidiians', 'make', 'appearance', 'second', 'season', 'dominated', 'Kazon', 'Tom', 'Tuvok', 'Janeway', 'plan', 'root', 'out', 'spy', 'one', 'Voyager', 'Once', 'again', 'must', 'mention', 'how', 'silly', 'Kazons', 'really', 'are', 'how', 'only', 'high', 'point', 'was', 'actor', 'Anthony', 'de', 'Longis', 'performance', 'brought', 'menace', 'role', 'Culluh', 'sadly', 'was', 'hobbled', 'Seska', 'shrew', 'was', 'one', 'Thaw', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'creepy', 'good', 'sense', 'have', 'said', 'show', 'was', 'real', 'throw', 'back', 'TOS', 'least', 'set', 'design', 'say', 'made', 'show', 'work', 'was', 'budget', 'breaker', 'surreal', 'setting', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'queer', 'performance', 'really', 'show', 'person', 'who', 'clowns', 'are', 'scary', 'begin', 'found', 'idea', 'people', 'dying', 'being', 'scared', 'death', 'really', 'frightening', 'So', 'rest', 'season', 'two', 'rambled', 'show', 'still', 'had', 'not', 'found', 'space', 'legs', 'concluded', 'cliffhanger', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'been.Basics', 'began', 'resolve', 'Kazon', 'issue', 'Dourif', 'return', 'Suder', 'show', 'lacked', 'sense', 'threat', 'was', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'crew', 'was', 'going', 'lose', 'stranding', 'crew', 'planet', 'Hannon', '4', 'was', 'character', 'Kazon', 'also', 'However', 'maybe', 'Seska', 'did', 'have', 'moral', 'streak', 'running', 'Personally', 'Culluh', 'should', ""'ve"", 'killed', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'went', 'say', 'keep', 'kind', 'substantial', 'conflict', 'going', 'Maquis', 'Starfleet', 'characters', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'too', 'disruptive', 'Star', 'Trek', 'family', 'were', 'trying', 'cement', 'ship', 'lost', 'out', 'there', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'have', 'time', 'time', 'revisited', 'whole', 'Maquis', 'question', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'have', 'minimized', ""'warring"", 'parties', 'same', 'ship', 'concept', 'so', 'speak', 'certainly', 'was', 'keeping', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'feeling', 'trying', 'minimize', 'conflicts', 'regular', 'characters', 'However', 'view', 'was', 'not', 'corroborated', 'co-creator', 'Michael', 'Piller', 'who', 'said', 'official', 'Star', 'Trek', 'site', 'one', 'thing', 'look', 'back', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'series', 'more', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'keep', 'more', 'conflict', 'going', 'Maquis', 'Starfleet', 'characters', 'least', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'think', 'was', 'opportunity', 'missed', 'early', 'slowly', 'create', 'group', 'characters', 'had', 'grow', 'know', 'trust', 'one', 'concerns', 'essentially', 'solved', 'conflicts', 'were', 'pretty', 'bonded', 'crew', 'probably', 'episode', 'three', 'four']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Second Season

However, Voyager just never rose beyond a mediocrity. The whole premise was that the ship was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from home, but we never actually see any implications of this. There is almost no tension amongst the crew, no divisions, no infighting. Starfleet discipline is maintained even when it doesn't make sense. Very few families or deep relationships forming, something absolutely impossible in such close quarters. The show could have gone off in an interesting direction, but instead became a more action-oriented Next Generation.Given that the producers decided to take the show in an episodic rather than serial format, the show needed something other than the plotline to make it interesting. However, the crew is for the most part an utterly boring bunch. Katherine Janeway is fine as the ship's captain, emanating a motherly concern for the crew, but can't hold a candle to Captains Picard or Sisko. The holographic doctor is ironically the most interesting and entertaining character. He provides much-needed humor. However, the rest of the crew shows little to no character development. They're usually relegated to restating the obvious.Voyager was partly a victim of more cynical viewer attitudes in the late 1990s and the rise of reality TV. However, Voyager also failed on its own grounds. Coming after TNG and DS9, Voyager needed to more than just another Star Trek.

811881,A1J1E869YP9DO6,B0001NBNFW,"Geoffrey Fritts ""Banjo Man""","[5, 6]","The second season of Star Trek Voyager exhibits the best and worst of what Star Trek can be.  Some of the best episodes of any Star Trek series ever are part of the second season.  These include episodes like ""Meld"", ""Death Wish"", and ""Lifesigns"".  However, the worst episode ever produced on Star Trek Voyager, ""Threshold"", is part of the second season.The season can really be divided into two halves.  The first half of the season is extremely weak with only a few brite spots.  ""The 37's"" is a fun beginning to the season where we meet Amelia Earheart and ""Projections"" introduces Lt. Barclay to Voyager.  These are really the two redeeming moments of the first half of the season.  The season then digresses to the Doctor massaging Kes' feet so she can conceive a child.  The episode ""Twisted"" shows our valiant crew giving up and everything still working out.  The weakest point, however, is when Paris and Janeway are flopping around in the muck with their alien offspring.  A lot of this is laughable.The season, however, more than redeems itself in the second half where it produces one masterpiece after the next.  ""Meld"" is the best Tuvok episode ever, dealing with the mind of a Ensign Sudor, who has murdered a fellow crewman.  ""Death Wish"" is quite possbily the best Q episode in any series.  ""Death Wish"" deals with immortality, assisted suicide, cruel and unusual incarceration, the meaning of existence, and we finally get to visit the Q Continuum.  ""Lifesigns"" is probably the best Doctor episode ever and that is saying a lot.  ""Lifesigns"" deals with a hologram falling in love and the meaning of true love.  It also explores the issues surrounding an individual living with the consequences of the Vidian Phage virus day in and day out.  ""The Thaw"" is awesome!  It is unbelievable how an emotion, fear, could be brought to life in a constructed reality with such vivid power.  ""Tuvix"" once again deals with powerful issues, such as the right to exist.  Is it right to destroy one sentient being to create another?  What if that being was created by accident and you are destroying that being to restore two others?  That is the premise for ""Tuvix"".  B'Lanna has some great moments when she confronts the consequences of her past in ""Dreadnaught"".  She struggles with the fact that she may be responsible for the destruction of an innocent civilization.  In ""Prototype"" B'Lanna experiences the joy of basicly giving birth to a lifeform, a prototype unit.  Finally, the season ends with a great cliffhangar, ""Basics"".  In ""Basics"" the Kazon, Seska, and Chakotay's baby storylines all come to a head and in the process the Voyager crew is marooned on a volcanic planet with no technology.  WOW!Buy this set!  Don't get discouraged by the season's slow start.

But this episode fulfills, as no other episode has, the optimistic vision of future evolution.  Tom Paris and Captain Janeway are mutated into the far future descendants of humanity into large mudpuppies, living what appears to be a serene life in warm swamp water and breeding happily in tropical jungle.  I can think of no better existence.  We once were very similar to the creatures portrayed in this episode, and I have always looked back on that existence with a mixture of envy and evolutionary regret.  We are now bipedal apes with swollen brains, filled with emotional and rational conflict.  The projection of our evolution into these creatures is one of the boldest adventures Star Trek has ever offered.  The optimism of such a future state of our species is compelling science fiction.  Usually, sci-fi, and especially Star Trek, suggests that we will evolve into beings of pure energy and consciousness after some intermediate version that incorporates technology into our biological being.  Instead, ""Threshold"" offers an alternative, more naturalistic, vision of returning to something much like what we once were hundreds of millions of years ago.  I find this alternative vision of our future evolution refreshing and optimistic in the extreme.  I would much rather be a mudpuppy than a manifestation of pure energy consciousness.

Ensign Samantha Wildman will give birth to a baby girl who will be named Naomi Wildman. The infant is a mixed species: Human/Ktarian. This will cause her to grow and mature rapidly, more so than an all human child. Throughout the series Naomi Wildman will have visible roles and I will add that she is a sweetheart.The season will end with a cliffhanger. On the final episode of Season Two Voyager will be taken over by the Kazon. The crew will be forced off Voyager and left stranded on a planet. Voyager flies off and the crew encounters humanoid lifeforms. At this point it is not known if they are friendly or hostile. The episode ends with the words ""to be continued"". The second part will be seen on Season Three.It would take me a while to watch all the discs. There were no problems with the discs.

An of course, ALL THE MOVIES that I have bought in Blu Ray.Actually, the complete seasons are very expensive in Blu Ray.  So I have to see the series in low resolution in Instant Video.  It doesn't make me very happy but anyway, someday I will have the entire collections of series in Full HD or maybe better in 4K on line.  It is funny how I used to record the TV chapters in VHS, very ugly image, the the DVD arrived and the image came better and now I can't see DVD.  Ugly in my opinion.  But, I really don't know if 4K will have 4 times resolution.  I know that FULL HD is really a big step toward the perfection of the imagen, but 4K, I have to investigate more deeply about this matter.  The thing is that I have bought VHS, DVD, BLU RAY.  Then 4K is emerging.  The same movies again and again.  But, I am a fan of star trek, so I will continue making rich the studios.SEVEN OF NINE, ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS EVER (MY HUMBLE OPINION)From the 4 season and beyond, they introduce in the chapter SCORPION, one the best chapters I have ever seen: Seven of Nine (full Borg designation: Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01) was a Human female who was a former Borg drone. She was born Annika Hansen on stardate 25479 (2350), the daughter of eccentric exobiologists Magnus and Erin Hansen. She was assimilated by the Borg in 2356 at age six, along with her parents, but was liberated by the crew of the USS Voyager in 2374. She joined the crew and returned to the Alpha Quadrant with the starship in 2378.After being cast, actress Jeri Ryan acknowledged she had hardly even seen Star Trek, and had no idea what the Borg were. To prepare her, the producers gave her a copy of Star Trek: First Contact and the Star Trek Encyclopedia.[1]In an interview with Michael Logan, Ryan told TV Guide that the high, stiff collar had pressed against her carotid artery and caused her to pass out, so the lower neckline was a necessity.[10] She said in a 2012 interview that the suit by costume designer Robert Blackman was a &#34;feat of engineering&#34;, but required a 20-minute production shutdown if she needed to use the toilet, as she needed that time plus assistance to get into and out of it.[11]&#34;RESISTANCE IS FUTILE&#34;The Borg are a collection of species that have been turned into cybernetic organisms functioning as drones of the Collective, or the hive.The Borg manifest as cybernetically enhanced humanoid drones of multiple species, organized as an interconnected collective, the decisions of which are made by a hive mind, linked by subspace radio. The Borg inhabit a vast region of space in the Delta Quadrant of the galaxy, possessing thousands of vessels. They operate toward the fulfilment of one purpose: to &#34;add the biological and technological distinctiveness of other species to [their] own... [in pursuit of] perfection&#34;. The concept of perfection is the unifying idea at the core of the Borg. The pursuit of an unemotional, mechanical perfection is the Borg's only motivation. This is achieved through forced assimilation, a process which takes individuals and technology, enhancing and controlling them.Individual Borg rarely speak. Instead they send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that &#34;resistance is futile&#34;, generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be assimilated and its &#34;biological and technological distinctiveness&#34; will be added to their own.",5,"SEVEN OF NINE, ***THE BEST***",1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,3590,"['am', 'super', 'fan', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Original', 'Series', 'love', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Original', 'Series', 'New', 'Generation', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Voyager', 'course', 'THE', 'MOVIES', 'have', 'bought', 'Blu', 'Ray.Actually', 'complete', 'seasons', 'are', 'very', 'expensive', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'So', 'have', 'see', 'series', 'low', 'resolution', 'Instant', 'Video', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'happy', 'anyway', 'someday', 'will', 'have', 'entire', 'collections', 'series', 'Full', 'HD', 'maybe', 'better', '4K', 'line', 'funny', 'how', 'used', 'record', 'TV', 'chapters', 'VHS', 'very', 'ugly', 'image', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'image', 'came', 'better', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'DVD', 'Ugly', 'opinion', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '4K', 'will', 'have', '4', 'times', 'resolution', 'know', 'FULL', 'HD', 'really', 'big', 'step', 'perfection', 'imagen', '4K', 'have', 'investigate', 'more', 'deeply', 'matter', 'thing', 'have', 'bought', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'Then', '4K', 'emerging', 'same', 'movies', 'again', 'again', 'am', 'fan', 'star', 'trek', 'will', 'continue', 'making', 'rich', 'studios.SEVEN', 'OF', 'NINE', 'ONE', 'THE', 'BEST', 'CHARACTERS', 'EVER', 'MY', 'HUMBLE', 'OPINION', '4', 'season', 'introduce', 'chapter', 'SCORPION', 'one', 'best', 'chapters', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'full', 'Borg', 'designation', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'Tertiary', 'Adjunct', 'Unimatrix', '01', 'was', 'Human', 'female', 'who', 'was', 'former', 'Borg', 'drone', 'was', 'born', 'Annika', 'Hansen', 'stardate', '25479', '2350', 'daughter', 'eccentric', 'exobiologists', 'Magnus', 'Erin', 'Hansen', 'was', 'assimilated', 'Borg', '2356', 'age', 'six', 'parents', 'was', 'liberated', 'crew', 'USS', 'Voyager', '2374', 'joined', 'crew', 'returned', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'starship', '2378.After', 'being', 'cast', 'actress', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'acknowledged', 'had', 'hardly', 'even', 'seen', 'Star', 'Trek', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'Borg', 'were', 'prepare', 'producers', 'gave', 'copy', 'Star', 'Trek', 'First', 'Contact', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Encyclopedia', '1', ']', 'interview', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'Ryan', 'told', 'TV', 'Guide', 'high', 'stiff', 'collar', 'had', 'pressed', 'carotid', 'artery', 'caused', 'pass', 'out', 'lower', 'neckline', 'was', 'necessity', '10', ']', 'said', '2012', 'interview', 'suit', 'costume', 'designer', 'Robert', 'Blackman', 'was', '34', 'feat', 'engineering', '34', 'required', '20-minute', 'production', 'shutdown', 'needed', 'use', 'toilet', 'needed', 'time', 'assistance', 'get', '[', '11', ']', '34', 'RESISTANCE', 'IS', 'FUTILE', '34', 'Borg', 'are', 'collection', 'species', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'cybernetic', 'organisms', 'functioning', 'drones', 'Collective', 'hive.The', 'Borg', 'manifest', 'cybernetically', 'enhanced', 'humanoid', 'drones', 'multiple', 'species', 'organized', 'interconnected', 'collective', 'decisions', 'are', 'made', 'hive', 'mind', 'linked', 'subspace', 'radio', 'Borg', 'inhabit', 'vast', 'region', 'space', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'galaxy', 'possessing', 'thousands', 'vessels', 'operate', 'fulfilment', 'one', 'purpose', '34', 'add', 'biological', 'technological', 'distinctiveness', 'other', 'species', '[', ']', 'own', '[', 'pursuit', ']', 'perfection', '34', 'concept', 'perfection', 'unifying', 'idea', 'core', 'Borg', 'pursuit', 'unemotional', 'mechanical', 'perfection', 'Borg', 'only', 'motivation', 'achieved', 'forced', 'assimilation', 'process', 'individuals', 'technology', 'enhancing', 'controlling', 'them.Individual', 'Borg', 'rarely', 'speak', 'Instead', 'send', 'collective', 'audio', 'message', 'targets', 'stating', '34', 'resistance', 'futile', '34', 'generally', 'followed', 'declaration', 'target', 'question', 'will', 'be', 'assimilated', '34', 'biological', 'technological', 'distinctiveness', '34', 'will', 'be', 'added', 'own']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Second Season

But Season 2 went so far in the wrong direction it had to be based on some feedback from someone or a change of command somewhere.In the first season, it was obvious that the writers were trying to lay the foundation for future stories.  The Seska storyline is explored further in Season 2 which is a good thing, but then they have episodes that do more harm than good.  ""Initiations"" and ""Tattoo"" are designed to give Chakotay some character development (which was needed), but only end up boring the watcher, especially ""Tattoo"" which has no business in Star Trek canon.  ""Threshold"" has the right idea but then goes the wrong direction, not just with The Doctor being able to reverse evolution itself but also creating a history-making event that is then forgotten by all.""Dreadnought"" is an episode that shouldn't even be possible, given the reason Voyager was even in the Delta Quadrant.  ""False Profits"" feels like a bone to people who yearned for familiar species.There are some good episodes in Season 2.  Beyond the Seska storyline episodes, ""Meld"" is one of the more interesting stories that has two parts.  First, Tuvok finds a murderer that has no logical motive, which conflicts with his Vulcan sensibilities.  This sets up ""Basics"", the two-part episode that resulted in the loss of the ship, and managed to create more character development for the murderer than had ever been seen previously.  The story blurred the black-white nature of the Prime Directive by showing that even the worst person has value under the right circumstances.  But if nothing else, ""Meld"" shows just how good an actor Tim Russ really is (I would love to see him, Avery Brooks and Tony Todd in something together), and ""Basics"" shows how polarizing Brad Dourif is in such a role as Lon Suder.Season 2's problem was that it had too many diamonds in the rough.  There were a lot of filler and boring episodes in the season which made it extremely difficult to pick out the important ones.

811913,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0001NBNFW,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[16, 22]","Less than one year following the concluding season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the ""Star Trek"" universe originally created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled ""Voyager"" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May, 2001. Because ""Voyager"" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season. The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.Unlike the previous three ""Star Trek"" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy. Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth. Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.The primary cast members of the second season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Delta Quadrant native (Ocampan) Kes (Jennifer Lien), Lt. Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr.  Tuvok (Tim Russ) and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang).  Voyager's primary enemy in the second season is still the Delta Quadrant native species known as the Kazon.  With less sophisticated technology than the Federation, several of the Kazon desperately want to capture Voyager to use against their own warring people.  Seska (Martha Hackett), who left Voyager to join the Kazon during the first season, convinces a Voyager Maqui crewmember, Michael Jonas (Raphael Sbarge), to spy for the Kazon. Jonas' spying, the Kazon's desperation for technology and Seska's obsession for revenge culminate in the second season's cliffhanger final episode (a two-part episode that carries over into the third season).Through the second season, the holographic doctor's personality continues to develop as he works with Kes, the crew encounters the phage-infected Vidians again, Neelix's duties expand beyond cooking and B'Elanna continues her inner human-Klingon battle.  There are also several guest appearances from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" characters, including Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schultz) in episode ""Projections"", as well as William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Q (John de Lancie) in episode ""Death Wish"", which is one of the season's best episodes.  The best second-season episodes, in order of airdate, include ""Non Sequitur"", ""Tattoo"", ""Resistance"", ""Dreadnought"", ""Death Wish"", ""Lifesigns"", ""Deadlock"", ""The Thaw"" and ""Tuvix"".  The season's least memorable episodes include ""Cold Fire"" and ""Investigations"".Overall, I rate the second season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars. Sadly, the continued participation of the Kazon started to get old, as was the appearance of Voyager's second traitor (Raphael Sbarge's character of Jonas); but several of the second season's episodes clearly demonstrated that the show could have some very good creative writing.",4,"Still Isolated in the Delta Quadrant, Voyager Fights On",1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,4063,"['Less', 'one', 'year', 'following', 'concluding', 'season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', '1994', 'executive', 'producer/writer', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'Michael', 'Piller', 'Jeri', 'Taylor', 'created', 'fourth', 'television', 'series', 'based', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'originally', 'created', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', '1921-1991', '1960', 'fourth', 'television', 'series', 'entitled', 'Voyager', 'name', 'Federation', 'Planets', 'starship', 'used', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'January', '1995', 'ran', 'seven', 'seasons', 'concluded', 'May', '2001', 'Voyager', 'aired', 'initially', 'month', 'January', 'instead', 'traditional', 'September', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'first', 'season', 'succeeding', 'six', 'other', 'seasons', 'had', '26', 'episodes', 'grand', 'total', '172', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series.Unlike', 'previous', 'three', 'Star', 'Trek', 'television', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'took', 'place', 'bounds', 'Federation', 'Planets', 'nearby', 'sovereign', 'areas', 'space', 'such', 'Klingon', 'Empire', 'Romulan', 'Empire', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'starship', 'Voyager', 'hurled', 'tens', 'thousands', 'light-years', 'home', 'previously', 'unknown', 'unexplored', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'located', 'far', 'side', 'Milky', 'Way', 'Galaxy', 'Even', 'traveling', 'warp', '8', 'fastest', 'safe', 'speed', 'typical', 'starship', 'can', 'travel', 'would', 'take', 'Voyager', 'several', 'decades', 'return', 'Earth', 'Hence', 'series', 'survival', 'Voyager', 'Starfleet', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'isolated', 'unable', 'even', 'maintain', 'normal', 'communications', 'Earth', 'as', 'well', 'crew', 'ultimate', 'desire', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'faster', 'ship', 'capable', 'doing', 'Also', 'way', 'Voyager', 'few', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'natives.The', 'primary', 'cast', 'members', 'second', 'season', 'Voyager', 'include', 'Captain', 'Catherine', 'Janeway', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Commander', 'Chakotay', 'Robert', 'Beltran', 'half-Klingon', 'Lt.', ""B'Elanna"", 'Torres', 'Roxann', 'Dawson', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'native', 'Ocampan', 'Kes', 'Jennifer', 'Lien', 'Lt.', 'Thomas', 'Eugene', 'Paris', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'native', 'Talaxian', 'Neelix', 'Ethan', 'Phillips', 'holographic', 'Emergency', 'Medical', 'Holographic', 'Program', 'a.k.a.', 'Doctor', 'played', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Vulcan', 'Lt.', 'Cmdr', 'Tuvok', 'Tim', 'Russ', 'Ensign', 'Harry', 'Kim', 'Garrett', 'Wang', 'Voyager', 'primary', 'enemy', 'second', 'season', 'still', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'native', 'species', 'known', 'Kazon', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'technology', 'Federation', 'several', 'Kazon', 'desperately', 'want', 'capture', 'Voyager', 'use', 'own', 'warring', 'people', 'Seska', 'Martha', 'Hackett', 'who', 'left', 'Voyager', 'join', 'Kazon', 'first', 'season', 'Voyager', 'Maqui', 'crewmember', 'Michael', 'Jonas', 'Raphael', 'Sbarge', 'spy', 'Kazon', 'Jonas', 'spying', 'Kazon', 'desperation', 'technology', 'Seska', 'obsession', 'revenge', 'culminate', 'second', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'final', 'episode', 'two-part', 'episode', 'third', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'holographic', 'doctor', 'personality', 'develop', 'Kes', 'crew', 'phage-infected', 'Vidians', 'again', 'Neelix', 'duties', 'expand', 'cooking', ""B'Elanna"", 'inner', 'human-Klingon', 'battle', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'characters', 'including', 'Reginald', 'Barclay', 'Dwight', 'Schultz', 'episode', 'Projections', 'as', 'well', 'William', 'Riker', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'Q', 'John', 'de', 'Lancie', 'episode', 'Death', 'Wish', 'one', 'season', 'best', 'episodes', 'best', 'second-season', 'episodes', 'order', 'airdate', 'include', 'Non', 'Sequitur', 'Tattoo', 'Resistance', 'Dreadnought', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Lifesigns', 'Deadlock', 'Thaw', 'Tuvix', 'season', 'least', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'include', 'Cold', 'Fire', 'Investigations', '.Overall', 'rate', 'second', 'season', 'Voyager', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Sadly', 'continued', 'participation', 'Kazon', 'started', 'get', 'old', 'was', 'appearance', 'Voyager', 'second', 'traitor', 'Raphael', 'Sbarge', 'character', 'Jonas', 'several', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'creative', 'writing']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Second Season
811914,A3ARKIF3FNB5HV,B0001NBNFW,Michael D. Goolsby,"[5, 6]","What I used to find typical of every Star Trek Series since TNG was that the first two seasons seem to be very klunky and disjointed.  It isn't until the third season that everything seems to come together:  the writing, the plot lines, the acting even gets better as the actors get more familiar and more comfortable with their roles.Star Trek-Voyager in this regard has quite a few memorable moments that need to be highlighted here.  It was pretty much the ugly stepchild of DS9, which at this time had far better resources devoted to it than Voyager did.However, those few memorable moments really stuck out whereas in DS9, it was focused on the central plot of the Emissary and his relation to Bajor and the growing threat of the Dominion looming over the Alpha Quadrant.  Voyager's memorable 2nd season episodes include some of my favorite episodes of all time:  ""Death Wish"".  This is the story of an exiled Q Continuum member who wants to die and was banished for wanting that.  Voyager encounters this being and then encounters the other that we are more familiar with and they take Janeway on a tour through the Continuum, which seems to resemble everything and yet nothing at the same time.  No other series ever went to great lengths to explain or depict the Continuum the way Voyager did.  We would revisit this again in the Third season as it is depicted as a US Civil War Battle.""The Thaw"" is also another episode of note.  Voyager answers a distress call from a planet that suffered an environmental catastrophe and the survivors went underground and slept through this in suspended animation, only to be held hostage by their manifestation and personification of their fears, which was brilliantly played by Michael McKean, of ""Laverne & Shirley"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" fame.  His depiction of fear personified was so over the top that you focus on him and on what he is going to do next rather than on Janeway and her crew, who are desparately running out of time.""Tuvix"" is another episode that stands out when two characters who barely got along with each other as it was get merged together with a plant through a transporter accident and become a fourth entity that wants to fight for its existence at the expense of the other three.  This issue puts the crew and Janeway into an ethical dilemma:  do we accept this new entity or do we get Tuvok and Neelix back.The ongoing plot lines with the Kazon, the Treib and the Vidiians also show up here.  But these seem to sputter out and exhaust themselves by the end of the second season, when we find Janeway and her crew in a worse situation than being stuck out in the Delta Quadrant--that's when they are thrown off their own ship, left with only the clothes on their backs and stranded on a planet.I watched this series from beginning to end and saw it improve with age.  Like TNG before it, the second season episodes depict a show finding itself and by the end of it, we find the show always going back to its main premise, an Alpha Quadrant ship stranded in some far-flung corner of the galaxy with its crew sometimes fighting each other and the many enemies they made while trying to get home.",4,Voyager From A Guy Who Saw It As It Was Actually Happening,1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,3172,"['What', 'used', 'find', 'typical', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Series', 'TNG', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'klunky', 'disjointed', ""n't"", 'third', 'season', 'everything', 'come', 'together', 'writing', 'plot', 'lines', 'acting', 'even', 'better', 'actors', 'get', 'more', 'familiar', 'more', 'comfortable', 'roles.Star', 'Trek-Voyager', 'regard', 'quite', 'few', 'memorable', 'moments', 'need', 'be', 'highlighted', 'here', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'ugly', 'stepchild', 'DS9', 'time', 'had', 'far', 'better', 'resources', 'devoted', 'Voyager', 'did.However', 'few', 'memorable', 'moments', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'whereas', 'DS9', 'was', 'focused', 'central', 'plot', 'Emissary', 'relation', 'Bajor', 'growing', 'threat', 'Dominion', 'looming', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'Voyager', 'memorable', '2nd', 'season', 'episodes', 'include', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'time', 'Death', 'Wish', 'story', 'exiled', 'Q', 'Continuum', 'member', 'who', 'die', 'was', 'banished', 'wanting', 'Voyager', 'being', 'then', 'other', 'are', 'more', 'familiar', 'take', 'Janeway', 'tour', 'Continuum', 'resemble', 'everything', 'yet', 'nothing', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'series', 'ever', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'explain', 'depict', 'Continuum', 'way', 'Voyager', 'did', 'would', 'revisit', 'again', 'Third', 'season', 'depicted', 'US', 'Civil', 'War', 'Battle', 'Thaw', 'also', 'episode', 'note', 'Voyager', 'distress', 'call', 'planet', 'suffered', 'environmental', 'catastrophe', 'survivors', 'went', 'underground', 'slept', 'suspended', 'animation', 'only', 'be', 'held', 'hostage', 'manifestation', 'personification', 'fears', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'fame', 'depiction', 'fear', 'personified', 'was', 'so', 'top', 'focus', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'rather', 'Janeway', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'desparately', 'running', 'time', 'Tuvix', 'episode', 'out', 'when', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'barely', 'got', 'along', 'other', 'was', 'get', 'merged', 'together', 'plant', 'transporter', 'accident', 'become', 'fourth', 'entity', 'fight', 'existence', 'expense', 'other', 'three', 'issue', 'crew', 'Janeway', 'ethical', 'dilemma', 'do', 'accept', 'new', 'entity', 'do', 'get', 'Tuvok', 'Neelix', 'back.The', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'lines', 'Kazon', 'Treib', 'Vidiians', 'also', 'show', 'up', 'here', 'seem', 'sputter', 'out', 'exhaust', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'find', 'Janeway', 'crew', 'worse', 'situation', 'being', 'stuck', 'out', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'when', 'are', 'thrown', 'off', 'own', 'ship', 'left', 'only', 'clothes', 'backs', 'stranded', 'planet.I', 'watched', 'series', 'beginning', 'end', 'saw', 'improve', 'age', 'TNG', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'depict', 'show', 'finding', 'end', 'find', 'show', 'always', 'going', 'back', 'main', 'premise', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'ship', 'stranded', 'far-flung', 'corner', 'galaxy', 'crew', 'sometimes', 'fighting', 'other', 'many', 'enemies', 'made', 'trying', 'get', 'home']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Second Season

811926,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001NBNFW,Robert Moore,"[0, 3]","STAR TREK: VOYAGER was a show that from the beginning was marked by substantial potential, almost none of it that was fulfilled.  From the outset it had two major things going for it, several interesting characters and a great premise.  But it failed to develop to any great extent any of the characters and neglected the narrative format demanded by the premise.To see what I mean by the failure to develop characters, contrast VOYAGER with a show it overlapped for several years, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  In a way this is unfair since BUFFY was one of a handful of television series that completely changed the rules of how TV was done.  BUFFY altered the way characters were handled on a TV show, but VOYAGER had its format established well before the debut of BUFFY.  Still, retroactively the one show makes watching the earlier one more difficult to watch because of how it expanded what a television series was allowed to do with character.  Here is an experiment:  take any character on BUFFY and see where they started out on the series and where they ended up.  One is immediately struck by the enormous journey each undertook.  Willow, Anya, Spike, Cordy, Buffy herself all go through so many changes and crises that by the end of the series they are completely different people.  Now, contrast this with VOYAGER.  Just about every character on the show is very close to the same character at the end of the series as at the beginning.  There might be some alterations in romantic attachments and there might be some added depth, but all the characters pretty much remain the same throughout.  This is even true of characters you would have expected to have nothing except potential to grow, like the Doctor and later Seven of Nine.I've argued a lot with myself about precisely why VOYAGER -- and indeed, most of the STAR TREK series -- are so timid with regard to character development.  I have no completely satisfying answer.  Certainly I think the show's writers were determined to focus more on story than character, with the latter ancillary to whatever tale is being told.  The trend in TV since the mid-nineties has been to character over story (Damon Lindelhof of LOST has explicitly stated that while they want to have a good story, they have taken BUFFY as their template as the way to develop narrative by primarily focusing on character).  On VOYAGER, though lots of things happen to the characters, nothing much in fact ever happens to the characters.The second great failure on the show was the overall failure to focus on an overarching narrative.  The premise of the show would seem to demand this, but instead the show persistently -- especially in Season Two -- stresses episodic storytelling at the expense of serial elements.  Again, this is partly the fault of timing.  TV historians usually cite TWIN PEAKS as the first show with a long overarching narrative, followed somewhat more successfully by THE X-FILES, before BUFFY perfected the format.  (The usual way of telling the story is this:  TWIN PEAKS introduced the idea of a long narrative, but proceeded to collapse under its own storytelling.  THE X-FILES told a long and often compelling story in its alien colonization story, but failed to integrate this sufficiently with character development and failed to make the narrative terribly consistent over the years [e.g., all the different explanations about what happened to Mulder's sister and the evolving explanation as to who Mulder's father was].  BUFFY managed both to tell compelling season-long stories while engaging in breathtaking character development.)The episodic nature of the show wouldn't have been so bad if the writing hadn't so often failed.  There are many episodes in Season Two that are torturous to watch.  A prime example is ""Non Sequitur,"" in which Harry Kim wakes up in San Francisco in what he gradually realizes is an alternative reality.  The plot is so hackneyed and tedious to watch that visiting the dentist office would be preferable.  Unfortunately there are many such episodes.Adding to the problems are some of the ongoing elements that do make their way onto the show.  I'm not a fan of aliens on SF shows (the only SF series that I can truly say that I love that had aliens was FARSCAPE -- on all others aliens were at best an irritant), but STAR TREK has a genius for bad aliens.  The Kazon were a constant presence on the show in the first half of its run (though they thankfully disappeared after Voyager made its way past Borg space).  Their main characteristics were their extreme militarism combined with plaster-of-paris hair.  The most I can say for them is that they weren't as awful as the Ferengi.Still, amidst all this were some good elements.  I find a couple of the characters irritating -- Jennifer Lien is lovely to look at (except for those horrid ears), but she was just way too timid and mild-mannered for my taste, while Neelix has to join any short list of the most irritating characters in the history of TV -- but most of the main characters I really liked.  I felt that way, way too little was done in the first few seasons with B'Elanna Torres.  The idea of a half human and half Klingon individual had wonderful possibilities, but for some reason the show at most merely gestures at them.  Roxann Dawson was really good in the role, but as mentioned above, the show remained primarily a series that focused on plot rather than character.  Too bad.  I also enjoyed Tim Russ as Tuvok.  Although I hate aliens, I must confess to enjoying Vulcans.  Though many criticized Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, I loved her and though she gave the show some backbone through her presence.  I always though that Harry Kim was the show's weakest link, but I absolutely loved the Doctor.  One of the things that cyborgs, robots, and other kinds of artificial people do is make us ask questions about what it means to be human.  No character I know of in the history of TV does this quite to the extent that Voyager's Emergency Holographic Doctor does.  Even so, I felt that the show didn't do as much with the kinds of questions his presence raise as it could have.In short, VOYAGER is a show that persistently was less than the sum of its parts.  Mainly this is because the show's producers and writers failed to provide a compelling overarching framework and narrative to develop characters.  But at least it got some things right.",3,A second season marked by lots of unfulfilled potential,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,6419,"['STAR', 'TREK', 'VOYAGER', 'was', 'show', 'beginning', 'was',

The back will also list the episodes. Make sure you contact the seller and get a detailed description of the disc and packaging before ordering. The set that I received from speedkingbooks for season 3 came in a shiny cardboard box that when opened you slip off another plain brown cardboard cover to find the discs in the center of the cardboard holder in a flimsy binder type slip cover. Also the discs do not have the episodes in the center of the disc and episodes are not listed on the back cover.  The seller offerd me a refund but still insists that in is not bogus and at this point from his email it reads like taking down my 1 star rating is a pre-condition for said refund .I have not gotten a response back to that question but that is how it read to me.
