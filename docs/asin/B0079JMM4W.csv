This film will connect with so many people on many different levels.  It is a great movie from the standpoint of romantic comedy or independent or drama or comedy:  It fits all of those genres and more.  Excellent writing and the characters are spot-on and you will find yourself reminiscing about your own relationships not only with your partner, but also with your family members.  The music is absolutely amazing, especially the music by Bootstraps (Fortyfive) and all I can say is this is a movie that I bought to keep forever because it is that wonderful.  Watch it and you will see that it will change your heart forever.  Congratulations to you, Sam Jaeger, for outstanding writing, directing, and acting and to Amber Jaeger for your sensitive and intuitive acting. To both of you, I will be looking forward to your next work. To anyone considering film work as an art, this movie will inspire you.

Why is this one so good?The plot is not particularly original, and the scenes are not incredibly original, creative or surprising. There are some holes in the plot--but they can be ignored well enough. However, the acting is fantastic and the characters are appealing--both the lead actors have great comedic timing. The little surprises in plot and dialogue are cute and funny. The characters are realistic and you like them both equally. The filming, editing, and music are done very well.We found ourselves chuckling out loud quite a bit during the movie, and when it ended, it left us feeling good and happy.

So, do not turn it off or you'll deprive yourselves of seeing each layer, more emotionally raw than the last one, peeled away.  And you'll realize that no one, on the surface, is really what they seem.  However, you'll feel satisfied by the end of it, because you'll know that each character will heal.

Another road trip, I thought, with two characters with warring personalities  who will encounter troubles and eventually fall in love.  A tried and true formula.But somehow I stuck with it, probably because the actors were very good.  I really liked the angry young woman and then the shluppy cab driver warmed up to me.  There were some good stops along the way.  The guy's family in Boulder was perfect. I loved his uptight dad and his mom who kept saying ""How Fun!""  Then, the girl's sweet eccentric mom in Las Vegas....a heartwarmer.  The scene at the memorial service was a little maudlin for me and the only scene that didn't ring true. The end was trite, too, but somehow, by that time I had forgiven them all.After I saw the film I learned that the lead actor, Sam Jaeger,also wrote and directed the film and his leading woman is his real-life wife, Amber.

1528571,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B0079JMM4W,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","Sam Jaeger writes, directs and stars in this romantic, and believable situation comedy, which is neither overblown nor timid while starring his own wife in the opposite lead role.  Scenery mixes with a definite palpable chemistry as these two take to the road for a trip that does not start with the happiest of farewells.Thom (Sam Jaeger) is struggling to pay his rent, falling behind so he has to make money quickly.  He decides to drive a cab while living in New York City although without proper licensing to drive it and carrying many of his possessions in his back seat.  Not having any other choice, he picks up a hopeful but desperate fare in Claire.Claire (Amber Jaeger), who is a high-power businesswoman, catches her husband at their home in an obviously questionable situation with another woman, who compliments her on the 'color of her bedroom' before leaving their home.  Within the same time frame, she receives a call to let her know that her father has had a heart attack and is hospitalized; just at about the same time it all hits the fan with her marriage.  This causes her to run out into the street and randomly grab a cab that just so happens to be Thom.  In a ""Shut up and just drive"" situation, it is go, and Go Now!  The eventual destination is Encinitas, CA, but as far as Claire is concerned, anywhere would be better than where she is at the moment.This is an easier, sometimes sarcastic, mix of a story, being more subtle than in your face as it gains momentum.  The action is slower paced and the humor comes at you at the same speed, though there are some definite laughs catching one right out loud.  The couple goes from one mishap to another in some gorgeous and well shown scenery (Jesse Feldman), from the Big City, to Middle America, and onward.  This is all scored with some original and snappy music by 'Bootstraps' all coming together very well for an enjoyable movie that I would absolutely watch again.",5,"""Did You Ever Notice How Really Lonely Men Have Large DVD Collections?"" - Claire",1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1946,"['Sam', 'Jaeger', 'directs', 'stars', 'romantic', 'believable', 'situation', 'comedy', 'overblown', 'timid', 'starring', 'own', 'wife', 'opposite', 'lead', 'role', 'Scenery', 'mixes', 'definite', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'two', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'not', 'start', 'happiest', 'farewells.Thom', 'Sam', 'Jaeger', 'struggling', 'pay', 'rent', 'falling', 'make', 'money', 'quickly', 'drive', 'cab', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'proper', 'licensing', 'drive', 'carrying', 'many', 'possessions', 'back', 'seat', 'Not', 'having', 'other', 'choice', 'up', 'hopeful', 'desperate', 'fare', 'Claire.Claire', 'Amber', 'Jaeger', 'who', 'high-power', 'businesswoman', 'husband', 'home', 'obviously', 'questionable', 'situation', 'woman', 'who', ""'color"", 'bedroom', 'leaving', 'home', 'same', 'time', 'frame', 'call', 'let', 'know', 'father', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'hospitalized', 'just', 'same', 'time', 'fan', 'marriage', 'run', 'out', 'street', 'randomly', 'grab', 'cab', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'Thom', 'Shut', 'up', 'just', 'drive', 'situation', 'go', 'Go', 'Now', 'eventual', 'destination', 'Encinitas', 'CA', 'as', 'far', 'Claire', 'concerned', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'where', 'moment.This', 'easier', 'sometimes', 'sarcastic', 'mix', 'story', 'being', 'more', 'subtle', 'face', 'gains', 'momentum', 'action', 'slower', 'paced', 'humor', 'same', 'speed', 'are', 'definite', 'laughs', 'catching', 'one', 'right', 'loud', 'couple', 'one', 'mishap', 'gorgeous', 'well', 'shown', 'scenery', 'Jesse', 'Feldman', 'Big', 'City', 'Middle', 'America', 'onward', 'scored', 'original', 'snappy', 'music', ""'Bootstraps"", 'coming', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'would', 'absolutely', 'watch', 'again']",Take Me Home

I watched the preview for this one and really thought it would be a little boring. This was anything but boring. This movie takes two proved formulas and puts them together. A romantic comedy mixed with a road movie. The acting was OK and the budget for this was not the best but it was a great movie that is better then a lot of the high budget movies. This movie is pretty predictable but sometimes it works and this is an example of that.
