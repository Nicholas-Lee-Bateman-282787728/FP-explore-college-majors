After their deaths, however, Sydnee finds out some disturbing news:  hubby had an affair with her best friend (Rosalind Chao), and lo and behold, he was a smuggler, extortionist, and quite a few other things she never dreamed about.  Thomas Gibson (Greg and Dharma) sleepwalks through his role; James Wilder plays the handsome detective who falls in love with Sydnee; and Leland Orser plays the asthma-plagued FBI agent with his own agenda.It isn't a bad movie, but it's slow pacing and excess padding keep it from being truly memorable.",3,AVERAGE TV MOVIE COMES TO DVD,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,933,"['TO', 'LOVE', 'HONOR', 'AND', 'DECEIVE', 'one', 'somber', 'serious-themed', 'tv', 'movies', 'late', '90s', 'offers', 'competent', 'performances', 'wasted', 'connect', 'dot', 'script', 'once', 'again', 'underhandedness', 'dear', 'friends', 'FBI.Vanessa', 'Marcil', 'good', 'performance', 'Sydnee', 'devoted', 'mother', 'world', 'shattered', 'when', 'husband', 'young', 'son', 'are', 'killed', 'boating', 'accident', 'deaths', 'however', 'Sydnee', 'out', 'disturbing', 'news', 'hubby', 'had', 'affair', 'best', 'friend', 'Rosalind', 'Chao', 'lo', 'behold', 'was', 'smuggler', 'extortionist', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'never', 'dreamed', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'Greg', 'Dharma', 'role', 'James', 'Wilder', 'handsome', 'detective', 'who', 'love', 'Sydnee', 'Leland', 'Orser', 'asthma-plagued', 'FBI', 'agent', 'own', 'agenda.It', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'slow', 'pacing', 'excess', 'padding', 'keep', 'being', 'truly', 'memorable']",To Love Honor and Deceive

Sydney is a former film editor who now is married with a six year old son, Adam, living in a beautiful huge house and doing whatever she wants to do. However, she has nightmares that she cannot find her son. It's her gut telling her something. She wants to invite her husband's parents to Adam's birthday party, but her husband puts the kibosh on that - at least he's tells her not to.The next thing she knows he's taking her son out in a boat on a stormy day (or says he's going to anyway). The Coast Guard searches for them but finds nothing. Sydney holds a memorial service, then finds out that her ever present best friend had an affair with her husband.Sydney is told there are discrepancies with her husband's accounting and there is no money. She continues to live in the huge house and drive her Volvo, so she is not affected by this news.  She slowly figures out that her husband is a con man and liar (she looks for his parents without success) and believes that he has run off with her son. Why? A psychopath would not take the kid unless it would do him some good, instead of weigh him down. So this premise is faulty.Detective Sanders (James Wilder) tries to help her when her house is broken into but instead of being much of a help, he becomes infatuated with her and seems to lose his reasoning abilities. The FBI character, Special Agent Lassiter, is totally goofy and weird. Do they expect us to believe that the FBI would actually hire such a person? Are they that hard up? Of course he has to have asthma and use his inhaler whenever he gets nervous, which is a lot.Sydney does all the investigating herself. She is strong and sure and never really upset about not having her son or knowing if he's really alive or his whereabouts. She goes out and has a good time with Det. Sanders. I will say Vanessa Marcil is beautiful, has beautiful hair, and whoever picked her outfits did a good job as they look timeless and not trendy for the 90's.Nicholas Bennett (William Moses) is the ""bad"" guy; very slick, smooth and brags on his sociopathy. Moses appears to have come straight from the School of Soap Opera Acting. I could picture him better on ""Days of Our Lives.""The end is kind of silly and certainly not what I would have done as I would have been gone, not waiting around for anyone....but Sydney does have a snappy comeback line in there that made me laugh.",3,I don't know what I expect,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,2407,"['guess', 'better', 'Sydney', 'former', 'film', 'editor', 'who', 'now', 'married', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Adam', 'living', 'beautiful', 'huge', 'house', 'doing', 'do', 'However', 'nightmares', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'son', 'gut', 'telling', 'something', 'invite', 'husband', 'parents', 'Adam', 'birthday', 'party', 'husband', 'kibosh', 'least', 'tells', 'not', 'to.The', 'next', 'thing', 'taking', 'son', 'out', 'boat', 'stormy', 'day', 'going', 'anyway', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'searches', 'nothing', 'Sydney', 'memorial', 'service', 'then', 'out', 'ever', 'present', 'best', 'friend', 'had', 'affair', 'husband.Sydney', 'told', 'are', 'discrepancies', 'husband', 'accounting', 'money', 'live', 'huge', 'house', 'drive', 'Volvo', 'not', 'affected', 'news', 'slowly', 'out', 'husband', 'con', 'man', 'liar', 'parents', 'success', 'run', 'off', 'son', 'Why', 'psychopath', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'kid', 'would', 'do', 'good', 'instead', 'weigh', 'down', 'So', 'premise', 'faulty.Detective', 'Sanders', 'James', 'Wilder', 'help', 'when', 'house', 'broken', 'instead', 'being', 'much', 'help', 'infatuated', 'lose', 'reasoning', 'abilities', 'FBI', 'character', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Lassiter', 'totally', 'goofy', 'weird', 'Do', 'expect', 'believe', 'FBI', 'would', 'actually', 'hire', 'such', 'person', 'Are', 'hard', 'up', 'course', 'have', 'asthma', 'use', 'inhaler', 'whenever', 'nervous', 'lot.Sydney', 'investigating', 'herself', 'strong', 'sure', 'never', 'really', 'upset', 'not', 'having', 'son', 'knowing', 'really', 'alive', 'whereabouts', 'out', 'good', 'time', 'Det', 'Sanders', 'will', 'say', 'Vanessa', 'Marcil', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'hair', 'whoever', 'picked', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'look', 'timeless', 'not', 'trendy', ""90's.Nicholas"", 'Bennett', 'William', 'Moses', 'bad', 'guy', 'very', 'slick', 'smooth', 'brags', 'sociopathy', 'Moses', 'have', 'come', 'straight', 'School', 'Soap', 'Opera', 'Acting', 'could', 'picture', 'better', 'Days', 'Lives', 'end', 'kind', 'silly', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'gone', 'not', 'waiting', 'anyone', '.but', 'Sydney', 'have', 'snappy', 'comeback', 'line', 'made', 'laugh']",To Love Honor and Deceive
