378746,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6303521231,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[66, 71]","In 1930 General Douglas MacArthur was appointed chief of staff of the U.S. Army and attempted to modernize the Army.  In June 1932 he used not only tanks and troops of cavalry with drawn sabers, but also infantry with fixed bayonets to attack the Bonus Army in Washington, D.C., claiming the outrageous idea of American troops attacking former members of the Army who had served in the First World War was justified because the nation was on the verge of a communist revolution.While that infamous moment in American military history is the prologue for ""In Pursuit of Honor,"" Dennis Lynton Clark's script tells what happened in 1935 when MacArthur changed the cavalry from men on horseback to men in tanks and ordered the destruction of hundreds of horses.  The decision does not sit well with old Sergeant John Libbey (Don Johnson) and his other NCO's, but it is young Lt. Marshall Buxton (Craig Sheffer) who decides after watching the infantry gun down a hundred horses that they are not going to let the same thing be done to any more of the creatures.  For these men it is a question of honor and they think when their service is no longer required horses should be treated the same way as former soldiers.  Of course, the film's prologue amply proves that MacArthur (James Sikking) is willing to gun down old soldiers along with old horses.Libbey is certainly an old soldier at home in the saddle and Buxton is young, a West Point graduate, but they have in common a tendency to be insubordinate when it comes to matters of honor.  Libbey refused to ride down the women and children of the Bonus Army just because ordered to do so by Colonel John Hardesty (Bob Gunton), who is the officer MacArthur sends west to do the changeover.  Buxton knows nothing about Hardesty's past, but he knows that what the Army is doing to this horses is wrong and in a split-second he makes a decision to save the rest of the horses.Since the army base on the American-Mexican border is south of them, the soldiers take the horses north and Hardesty sets off in pursuit with his mechanized force.  Unfortunately director Ken Olin made ""In Pursuit of Honor"" for television, which means the budget for depicting an epic chase between horses and machines was never there.  There is an entire dimension to this story with regards to the disadvantages of trying to find roads to travel on in the U.S. in 1935 in pursuit of a bunch of horses.The best parts of this television movie are out in the middle of no where with the five soldiers and their hundreds of horses.  Johnson's performance is the cornerstone of the film, caught up in the attempt to save the horses without really pausing to consider the implications of what it means for any of them.  However, the whole ideal of the big confrontation that is building throughout the film ends up becoming something of an anticlimax by the time it is finally played out, although why is not exactly clear.  While the horses are heading north we have a subplot involving Colonel Owen Stuart (Rod Steiger), the retired former leader of the cavalry, who goes to the nation's capital to try and convince MacArthur of the mistake he is making, and his daughter, Jessica (Gabrielle Anwar), a young reporter.The suggestion is that something bigger than the military is going to save the day, but that does not really prove to be the case.  If anything, the lesson of this 1995 movie is that the honor of the U.S. Army is where it has always been, in the hearts of its non-commissioned officers.  The officers can give all the commands they want, but the sense of what is right and wrong in the military comes in the looks of not only Sgt. Libbey's companions, Sgt. Thomas Mulcahey (John Dennis Johnston), Sgt. James Shattuck (Robert Coleby), and Sgt. Sean Quinlain (Neil Melville), put a pair of non-coms who are involved in the pursuit, Sgt. Ernest Gruber (Peter Curtin) and Sgt. Nathaniel Rutherford (Brian McDermott).In 1935 President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent MacArthur to organize the defense of the Philippines, a fact that is not related at the end of ""In Pursuit of Honor.""  Actually, there is not any sort of scroll of information at the end to let us know what happened to the participants in this true story.  But the idea that FDR would boot MacArthur to the other side of the globe for thinking shooting several hundred horses is a good idea is certainly a decision you would want to applaud (although Herbert Hoover having done it three years earlier would be even better).",4,There is a proper way to retire horses in the U.S. calvary,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,4516,"['1930', 'General', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'appointed', 'chief', 'staff', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'attempted', 'modernize', 'Army', 'June', '1932', 'used', 'not', 'only', 'tanks', 'troops', 'cavalry', 'drawn', 'sabers', 'also', 'infantry', 'fixed', 'bayonets', 'attack', 'Bonus', 'Army', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'claiming', 'outrageous', 'idea', 'American', 'troops', 'attacking', 'former', 'members', 'Army', 'who', 'had', 'served', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'justified', 'nation', 'was', 'verge', 'communist', 'revolution.While', 'infamous', 'moment', 'American', 'military', 'history', 'prologue', 'Pursuit', 'Honor', 'Dennis', 'Lynton', 'Clark', 'script', 'what', 'happened', '1935', 'when', 'MacArthur', 'changed', 'cavalry', 'men', 'horseback', 'men', 'tanks', 'ordered', 'destruction', 'hundreds', 'horses', 'decision', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'old', 'Sergeant', 'John', 'Libbey', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'other', 'NCO', 'young', 'Lt.', 'Marshall', 'Buxton', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'who', 'watching', 'infantry', 'gun', 'down', 'hundred', 'horses', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'let', 'same', 'thing', 'be', 'done', 'more', 'creatures', 'men', 'question', 'honor', 'think', 'when', 'service', 'longer', 'required', 'horses', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'same', 'way', 'former', 'soldiers', 'course', 'film', 'prologue', 'amply', 'MacArthur', 'James', 'Sikking', 'willing', 'gun', 'down', 'old', 'soldiers', 'old', 'horses.Libbey', 'certainly', 'old', 'soldier', 'home', 'saddle', 'Buxton', 'young', 'West', 'Point', 'graduate', 'have', 'common', 'tendency', 'be', 'insubordinate', 'when', 'matters', 'honor', 'Libbey', 'refused', 'ride', 'down', 'women', 'children', 'Bonus', 'Army', 'just', 'because', 'ordered', 'do', 'so', 'Colonel', 'John', 'Hardesty', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'who', 'officer', 'MacArthur', 'west', 'do', 'changeover', 'Buxton', 'nothing', 'Hardesty', 'past', 'what', 'Army', 'doing', 'horses', 'wrong', 'split-second', 'decision', 'save', 'rest', 'horses.Since', 'army', 'base', 'American-Mexican', 'border', 'south', 'soldiers', 'take', 'horses', 'north', 'Hardesty', 'sets', 'off', 'pursuit', 'mechanized', 'force', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Ken', 'Olin', 'made', 'Pursuit', 'Honor', 'television', 'budget', 'depicting', 'epic', 'chase', 'horses', 'machines', 'was', 'never', 'there', 'entire', 'dimension', 'story', 'regards', 'disadvantages', 'trying', 'find', 'roads', 'travel', 'U.S.', '1935', 'pursuit', 'bunch', 'horses.The', 'best', 'parts', 'television', 'movie', 'are', 'middle', 'where', 'five', 'soldiers', 'hundreds', 'horses', 'Johnson', 'performance', 'cornerstone', 'film', 'caught', 'up', 'attempt', 'save', 'horses', 'really', 'pausing', 'consider', 'implications', 'what', 'However', 'whole', 'ideal', 'big', 'confrontation', 'building', 'film', 'up', 'becoming', 'something', 'anticlimax', 'time', 'finally', 'played', 'out', 'why', 'not', 'exactly', 'clear', 'horses', 'are', 'heading', 'have', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Colonel', 'Owen', 'Stuart', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'retired', 'former', 'leader', 'cavalry', 'who', 'nation', 'capital', 'try', 'convince', 'MacArthur', 'mistake', 'making', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'young', 'reporter.The', 'suggestion', 'something', 'bigger', 'military', 'going', 'save', 'day', 'not', 'really', 'prove', 'be', 'case', 'anything', 'lesson', '1995', 'movie', 'honor', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'where', 'always', 'been', 'hearts', 'non-commissioned', 'officers', 'officers', 'can', 'give', 'commands', 'want', 'sense', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'military', 'looks', 'not', 'only', 'Sgt', 'Libbey', 'companions', 'Sgt', 'Thomas', 'Mulcahey', 'John', 'Dennis', 'Johnston', 'Sgt', 'James', 'Shattuck', 'Robert', 'Coleby', 'Sgt', 'Sean', 'Quinlain', 'Neil', 'Melville', 'put', 'pair', 'non-coms', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'pursuit', 'Sgt', 'Ernest', 'Gruber', 'Peter', 'Curtin', 'Sgt', 'Nathaniel', 'Rutherford', 'Brian', 'McDermott', '.In', '1935', 'President', 'Franklin', 'D.', 'Roosevelt', 'sent', 'MacArthur', 'organize', 'defense', 'Philippines', 'fact', 'not', 'related', 'end', 'Pursuit', 'Honor', 'Actually', 'not', 'sort', 'scroll', 'information', 'end', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'participants', 'true', 'story', 'idea', 'FDR', 'would', 'boot', 'MacArthur', 'other', 'side', 'globe', 'thinking', 'shooting', 'several', 'hundred', 'horses', 'good', 'idea', 'certainly', 'decision', 'would', 'want', 'applaud', 'Herbert', 'Hoover', 'having', 'done', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better']",In Pursuit of Honor VHS

378749,A36JRTSX97XUMY,6303521231,"Louis J. Barbier ""The Cocoli Kid""","[0, 1]","I found the movie very interesting! It was a great depiction of a time in United States history and the US Army after WWI. It clearly shows how men will stick together through thick and thin. If you love horses this is a great story. You can hear the leather creaking; the sound of thundering hoofs; and feel the blazing hot sun of the Southwest of these United States. In addition one could see how mounted troops could fall in love with their horses and consider them as an extension of themselves. It also showed how some leaders could not understand how a soldier could love and take care of his horse above his own life. It also showed how some leaders although recently retired would fight for the right of horses to retire with dignity. The bottom line is that some things you can't put a dollar value on for they mean more to a soldier then all the tea in China. Honor is something one cannot give away or sell cheaply or if you do, you are no longer a man. Honor cannot be sold because you have to earn it and once you have you have to preserve it for all generations that follow. So, the movie In Pursuit of Honor is just that!

As part of the process, the Cavalry is changing form, and the order goes out to herd hundreds of horses to Mexico to be slaughtered.A young, idealistic officer (Craig Sheffer) and a grizzled veteran sergeant with a conscience, decide this is inhumane and against their principles and duty, given the Cavalry's sworn duty to protect his horse.  With a handful of men at their side, they take the horses on the run.  This leads to a chase across America as the army track them with orders to do whatever is necessary to bring them back.

For example, I can't imagine the Army unloading a ton of ordinance (which, at that time, was much more expensive than it is today) in order to stop a herd of aging horses cross over into Canada, let alone  a mechanized infantry unit pursing the same herd over half a continent.  Those elements of the film basically make no sense.However, the depiction of the War Bonus Protesters in Washington, although a small part of the film, is something that was real.  That the Army still used mounted soldiers a that time was real.  That the Armed Forces were unprepaired to do battle with the axis powers was real.  That the Army was in transition to a more modern force under Roosevelt (who knew that the country would be at war within the decade) was real.I suppose that if someone wanted to get really technical, certain aspects of the film aren't 100% accurate, like maybe the exact unit designation of the squadron wasn't right, but so what?

After the first 100 are machined gunned, five soldiersrevolt and attempt to save the rest eventually making an over 2,000mile run, while under close pursuit, for the Canadian border.Though initially appearing to be a smear on MacArthur(for hiscrime of Anti-Communism and preventing the Reds from overrunning SouthKorean in the Korean War) and the military in general(for makingliberals feel insecure about their manhood), cooler, more fair andbalanced heads--probably during production--must have prevailed forabout half way through, the film pulls back from where it appeared tobe heading and opts instead to present both sides of the issue andportrays MacArthur and the Army being forced by external circumstancesto take this hard path. Sikking, in particular, is very effective asMacArthur and Gunton--at first apparently a martinet ala Henry Fonda inFORT APACHE--is revealed to be a man who is not enjoying at all havingto carry out his orders but understands that orders must be obeyed orthe Army will cease to be a cohesive fighting force.On the other side, as the soldiers trying to save the horses,Sheffer, Steiger and especially Johnson are basically playing the typesof horse soldiers one saw in old John Ford films(Sheffer would be JohnAgar and Johnson would be Victor McLaughlin) and all are highlyeffective and ingratiating in their parts--the types of heroic rolemodel characters that Hollywood is rarely able to present any more.Only Anwar as a military hating female reporter--and in a thanklesssmarmy role---cannot quite rise above what she has been handed.The direction--especially the glorious photography--script,period feel and score are all first rate. Based on a true story, thefilm is one of the best historical films of that decade and is a finefilm in its own right. With little alteration, the film could have beenmade in 1934 during the Golden Age. It is that good. THIS is whatresults when artists put their politics and bigotries in a drawersomewhere and put their art--and history---first.And as an added bonus, the first ten minutes are in black and white.Enlighting, ennobling and entertaining.
