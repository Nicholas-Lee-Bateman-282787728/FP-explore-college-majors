1289305,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,B002U0KHNS,Andrew Furst,"[10, 15]","The original, 1960's series ""The Prisoner"" (with Patrick McGoohan), was, is, and always will be a MASTERPIECE.  And I recommend that everyone see THAT series, not this one.  This incredibly lame ""reimagining"" has virtually nothing in common with the original, and on top of that it's just tedious, pointless, and boring.The original (17 episode) series was entertaining, visually impressive, and fast paced; featured very clever dialog, great/memorable music, a keen sense of humor, and contained numerous IMPORTANT political warnings against big-government totalitarianism.  Warning people to be skeptical of friendly-faced, all-controlling, supposedly ""democratic"" governance.  The political message of the original was strongly and proudly libertarian, and should be required viewing for all who live in ""free"" countries (and if possible should also be seen by those living in unfree countries!).  But Hollywood liberals hate libertarianism, so they stripped that element entirely out of their new version.  Leaving - essentially nothing.If you know the flavor of the original series, you might suspect that THIS ""prisoner"" was made solely to keep people from seeing, appreciating, and learning from the original series.  That is, the liberal Hollywood ""warders"" who run our governments now, made this garbage in order to ruin the original, for fear that those who saw the original would seek their own freedom.  Shame on those who had any part in bringing this version to the screen.  Skip this, get the original series, be entertained by it, understand and spread its message of freedom!",1,NOT The REAL Prisoner!

I liked it, sure, but I never joined a fan club or tried to figure out the meaning of the bicycle.  I'll even allow that the final episode made no sense to me.I guess you could say this new version is a remake in the sense that if something is good enough to do over, the second time will probably be inferior.  The original was challenging, thought provoking and frequently quite funny.  This new show is about a guy who is being held against his will and wants to leave.  If there is any more to it than that, I missed it.  Its also quite slow.I think the magic number here is ""2"".  The best episodes of the original had the creator of the show matching wits with another actor of equal heft.  Having these two locked in battle was enough.  In this new production Ian McKellen has no real opponent.  Not really.  He's a joy to watch but for the rest its amateur night.If nothing else, I hope this puts to rest the idea that plugging in a fine English actor (Alec Guiness, Patrick Stewart, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins, etc, etc, etc) into a comic book turns it into something grand and complex.

True, it's a very different take on the concept of the original, but it reworks the core concepts of 'man, freedom, fielty and responsibility in an authoritarian society' (as well as the iconography) that were at the heart of the original quite brilliantly.That said, it is slow-burning, elliptical and occasionally downright nebulous - until, that is, you reach a denouement which quite brilliantly pulls everything together and provides you with a clear explanation of everything that has gone before which makes perfect sense within the context of...well, you'll just have to watch it to see...Jim Caviezel's ""Number Six"" is a very different character to the one who appeared in the original series, but when you look back on the piece in the context of the final episode, you will realise why he has to be far more vulnerable, confused and fragile than McGoohan's existential superhero; likewise Sir Ian McKellen quite brilliantly inverts everything that we expect from ""Number Two"" (and, truth be told, it is probably ""Two"" rather than ""Six"" who is the real focus of this retelling).Make no mistake about it, this is very subtle, thought-provoking stuff.  Possibly too subtle and too thought-provoking for the majority of today's television audiences, who, in a turn of events which would make the architects of ""The Village"" proud, have been duped into believing that awful, badly written, self-consciously cryptic nonsense like ""Lost"" and ""Heroes"" (or gratuitous pap like ""True Blood"") constitute intelligent, adult television.Hats off to writer Bill Gallagher and the team behind this reimagining of one of my favourite concepts - they've really taken it, run with it and created an intelligent, provocative and ultimately brilliant six hours of adult television.In its own way, it is every bit as good as the original.I can't wait to watch it all again knowing what I know now.",5,"The Village Has Changed, But The Genius Remains...",1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,2194,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'prepared', 'hate', 'remake', 'due', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'negative', 'advance', 'received', 'love', 'original', 'series', 'McGoohan', 'incarnation', 'still', 'possibly', 'favourite', 'TV', 'series', 'all-time', 'have', 'admit', 'reimagining', 'concept', 'brilliant', 'True', 'very', 'different', 'take', 'concept', 'original', 'core', 'concepts', ""'man"", 'freedom', 'fielty', 'responsibility', 'authoritarian', 'society', 'as', 'well', 'iconography', 'were', 'heart', 'original', 'quite', 'brilliantly.That', 'said', 'slow-burning', 'elliptical', 'occasionally', 'downright', 'nebulous', 'reach', 'denouement', 'quite', 'brilliantly', 'everything', 'together', 'clear', 'explanation', 'everything', 'gone', 'perfect', 'sense', 'context', 'well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Number', 'Six', 'very', 'different', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'appeared', 'original', 'series', 'when', 'look', 'back', 'piece', 'context', 'final', 'episode', 'will', 'realise', 'why', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'confused', 'fragile', 'McGoohan', 'existential', 'superhero', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'quite', 'brilliantly', 'everything', 'expect', 'Number', 'Two', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'probably', 'Two', 'rather', 'Six', 'who', 'real', 'focus', 'retelling', '.Make', 'mistake', 'very', 'subtle', 'thought-provoking', 'stuff', 'Possibly', 'too', 'subtle', 'too', 'thought-provoking', 'majority', 'today', 'television', 'audiences', 'who', 'turn', 'events', 'would', 'make', 'architects', 'Village', 'proud', 'have', 'been', 'duped', 'believing', 'awful', 'badly', 'written', 'self-consciously', 'cryptic', 'nonsense', 'Lost', 'Heroes', 'gratuitous', 'pap', 'True', 'Blood', 'constitute', 'intelligent', 'adult', 'television.Hats', 'writer', 'Bill', 'Gallagher', 'team', 'reimagining', 'one', 'favourite', 'concepts', ""'ve"", 'really', 'taken', 'created', 'intelligent', 'provocative', 'ultimately', 'brilliant', 'six', 'hours', 'adult', 'television.In', 'own', 'way', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'original.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'again', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'now']",The Prisoner

That being said, the main problem with this remake is that it fails completely to capture the compelling aspects of the original, (if it's even trying), which for me were the unbending defiance of No. 6, even when caught in a web of conspiracy masked by sometimes comically proper role-playing, and the brilliant flow of sarcastic repartee', which is mostly missing here. Jim Caviezel, while a fine actor, lacks both the nervous energy and acerbic wit that made McGoohan so interesting in the part, where McGoohan's No. 6 was wary and unpredictable, Caviezel just looks confused. Ian McKellan, while also a fine actor, lacks the boisterous, almost good-natured bully-boy quality that made the No. 2 characters in the original series such great villains, not to mention the army of henchmen and array of high tech devices they had at their beck and call. The constant battle of wills between No. 6 and the current No. 2 was an important aspect of the original series. The thing I found most jarring was the complete implausibility of the setting, where mesmerized characters live in a dreamland with no apparent knowledge or wonder of why they are the only town in the world (in the middle of a desert, no less), whereas in the original series everyone was very aware of where and who they were, and kept up a painful (at times) pretense of normality, wearing the picturesque costumes, taking part in the Village rituals, and trying hard, (in that uniquely British way), not to be the square peg in the round hole. I'm not sure exactly what the producers of this series where even aiming for, but the slow pacing, dreamy quality, and ambiguous story don't really make it all that interesting, in my opinion. I can imagine that the producers felt, given the prevalence of modern technologies, (which were in their infancy at the time of the original series), and the lack of a ""cold war"" environment, that creating an escape-proof, high-tech prison for intelligence operatives and other people who ""know too much"", and trying to recreate the original Village would not resonate with a contemporary audience, but if that's the case, I thing they miscalculated the whole project. Perhaps they simply lacked the budget. The themes of the original series resonate very strongly today, and a straightforward remake would have worked much better. If you've been waiting for decades for a remake or at least a good homage to McGoohan's unique original, this may disappoint.

I tried to escape the notion that one of my favorite TV creations could not be effectively remolded in an intriguing way. I tried to escape the concept that Patrick McGoohan and Portmeirion were The Village, love it or leave it. With every episode I watched in this 6-installment series, I was merely shackled and led back to the idea that it was done better 45 years ago.At first it looked OK. I was thrown into the deserts of Namibia, for no apparent reason. I happened upon a village of quaint pink A-frame dwellings, all derived from the same cookie cutter. And then there was the taxi cab, bright red Renault Dauphine driven by Lennie James (one of my favorite actors after catching the cancelled-too-soon 'Jericho' on American TV). Then there was the dapper Number Two, played by Ian McKellan, who filled the role with a commanding presence and dignity.I kept watching and waiting. I waited for Jim Cavielzel's Number Six to show me something - anything - excitement, anger, a sense of being indignant. Casting Caviezel in this role was a major misfire. Aside from bringing a bland indifference to his role, he lacks that background McGoohan had when launching The Prisoner. Over time, after watching his 'Danger Man' series, I joined the camp that viewed The Prisoner's resignation as McGoohan's departure from his John Drake role. Do we really care what Jim Caviezel left behind? A whole boatload of alternative actors could have brought more to the role (my favorite alternative is Lost's Terry O'Quinn. Heck, even Matt Damon would have been better - Jason Bourne fell into a river, and ended up in the desert).And so it went, for five more episodes. I tried to accept the idea that a sparring match between a single Number Two and Number Six could be played out in interesting fashion. Then it dawned on me that the original 1968 roster of Number Twos were effective because of the ominous presence of an unseen Number One. As things crawled along, it was revealed that there really was a Number One (although not so called), right there in Namibia. We had an answer. But was Number Two ever threatened out of his aristocratic desert existence? And why was Number One creating such a bland colorless experience for us? (I don't want to spoil it with further explanation)To be fair, the original series' 17 episodes varied in quality. McGoohan was on record as saying that seven episodes were 'about right' to get the series' premise across. The other ten (a few of them very good), were added to fill out the network's concept of a season. Here in 2008, they begin with a very economical six episodes, yet fail to make much memorable impact.The DVD set and presentation were attractive. The third disk - extras all - was fairly entertaining. Picture quality throughout is first class. As it is, I am going to order the Blue Ray treatment of the original series, because next time I watch The Prisoner, I know it's the real Number One.",2,"I Was Not a Number, I Was a Bored Man",1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,2977,"['tried', 'escape', 'really', 'did', 'tried', 'escape', 'notion', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'creations', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'effectively', 'remolded', 'intriguing', 'way', 'tried', 'escape', 'concept', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'Portmeirion', 'were', 'Village', 'love', 'leave', 'episode', 'watched', '6-installment', 'series', 'was', 'merely', 'shackled', 'led', 'back', 'idea', 'was', 'done', 'better', '45', 'years', 'ago.At', 'first', 'looked', 'OK', 'was', 'thrown', 'deserts', 'Namibia', 'apparent', 'reason', 'happened', 'village', 'quaint', 'pink', 'A-frame', 'dwellings', 'derived', 'same', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'then', 'was', 'taxi', 'cab', 'bright', 'red', 'Renault', 'Dauphine', 'driven', 'Lennie', 'James', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'catching', 'cancelled-too-soon', ""'Jericho"", 'American', 'TV', 'Then', 'was', 'dapper', 'Number', 'Two', 'played', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'who', 'filled', 'role', 'commanding', 'presence', 'dignity.I', 'kept', 'watching', 'waiting', 'waited', 'Jim', 'Cavielzel', 'Number', 'Six', 'show', 'something', 'anything', 'excitement', 'anger', 'sense', 'being', 'indignant', 'Casting', 'Caviezel', 'role', 'was', 'major', 'misfire', 'Aside', 'bringing', 'bland', 'indifference', 'role', 'background', 'McGoohan', 'had', 'when', 'launching', 'Prisoner', 'time', 'watching', ""'Danger"", 'Man', 'series', 'joined', 'camp', 'viewed', 'Prisoner', 'resignation', 'McGoohan', 'departure', 'John', 'Drake', 'role', 'Do', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'left', 'behind', 'whole', 'boatload', 'alternative', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'more', 'role', 'favorite', 'alternative', 'Lost', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Heck', 'even', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'fell', 'river', 'ended', 'up', 'desert', 'went', 'five', 'more', 'episodes', 'tried', 'accept', 'idea', 'sparring', 'match', 'single', 'Number', 'Two', 'Number', 'Six', 'could', 'be', 'played', 'out', 'interesting', 'fashion', 'Then', 'dawned', 'original', '1968', 'roster', 'Number', 'Twos', 'were', 'effective', 'ominous', 'presence', 'unseen', 'Number', 'One', 'things', 'crawled', 'along', 'was', 'revealed', 'really', 'was', 'Number', 'One', 'not', 'so', 'called', 'right', 'there', 'Namibia', 'had', 'answer', 'was', 'Number', 'Two', 'ever', 'threatened', 'aristocratic', 'desert', 'existence', 'why', 'was', 'Number', 'One', 'creating', 'such', 'bland', 'colorless', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'further', 'explanation', 'be', 'fair', 'original', 'series', '17', 'episodes', 'varied', 'quality', 'McGoohan', 'was', 'record', 'saying', 'seven', 'episodes', 'were', ""'about"", 'right', 'get', 'series', 'premise', 'other', 'ten', 'few', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'added', 'fill', 'out', 'network', 'concept', 'season', 'Here', '2008', 'begin', 'very', 'economical', 'six', 'episodes', 'yet', 'fail', 'make', 'much', 'memorable', 'impact.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'presentation', 'were', 'attractive', 'third', 'disk', 'was', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'Picture', 'quality', 'first', 'class', 'am', 'going', 'order', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'treatment', 'original', 'series', 'next', 'time', 'watch', 'Prisoner', 'know', 'real', 'Number', 'One']",The Prisoner

It would seem the viewers are divided on this new reworking of the show, and I was skeptical.I've seen the first 4 episodes of the new mini-series and I am enjoying it thoroughly.  It's not a twee, or funny as the original, and maybe lacks that humorous edge that I think only the dear departed PM could pull off, but it does follow and expand upon the original premise of the show.Yes, there are some changes, particularly location, and I think it was brave of the makers not to go down the route of filming in (or on a set of) Portmeirion.  I think it paid off, although the new Village is more of a Town if you ask me...a little too large perhaps.I certainly am keen to see the remaining episodes and likely will buy this DVD on its release to find out the conclusion of the series.You do have to go into this with an open mind, even if you have been a fan of the original - accept it as it's own piece of work rather than a comparative.  I very much liken it to comparing the BBC Life on Mars with the US remake.  Both were strong in their own right, and although the US version didn't fare well (and had an awful conclusion), it had captivating stories and good acting.

After the first couple of episodes when each new episode routinely put me to sleep, I was prepared to forgive it because the acting was in most cases so good and I just knew that there was going to be a big pay-off for my Job-like patience.  I was going to say that there was no payoff, but that's not entirely true.  There was the kick to the groin at the end and the realization that one has just wasted precious time.  The only good thing I can say about this ""Prisoner"" reboot is that it really does an excellent job of making me appreciate the singular genius of the original.  I think part of the success of the current series, ""Lost,"" is owed to the original ""Prisoner,"" which also dealt in flashbacks and surreal elements.  This reboot performs industrial canibalism, grinding up the elements of ""Lost"" that were nourished by the original ""Prisoner"" to consume and turn into manure.  Really, I can't say enough bad about this series...and I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't have hopes for it.  Despite all of the negative reviews, I just had to find out for myself.  Please don't make my mistake.  This is just a stinking awful mess that wastes everyone's time and makes even good things seem bad through the context.

Having a bunch of monitors with outdated grainy images and a few pieces of unshielded fiber optic line was the extent of big brother science. Oh, I forgot the large weather balloon is still there.

1289326,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B002U0KHNS,John Morgan,"[9, 15]","The new ""Prisoner"" isn't as bad as some are saying, but it's also not very good. I do love the original but I also came to the new version with an open mind. Any fan of the original series who's being honest, including McGoohan himself, will admit that only about half of the episodes were truly great - the others range from mediocre to excruciatingly bad, and even the great ones have some low points. But still, when it was good it was outstanding, and that's why you kept watching. It's obvious to me now that without McGoohan's driving presence, both in the leading role and as a creative force, the idea of ""The Prisoner"" isn't necessarily so compelling. Sure, all of the basic elements are still there in the new version, but I think this remake owes a lot more to ""Lost"" than it does to its source material. I found most of it boring, a constant series of more ""mysteries"" to be solved which, even when they are revealed, aren't interesting. And while James Caviezel is clearly a good actor, his Number Six, while cast in the role of a lone rebel, is not especially heroic or even sympathetic. McGoohan's Six was unquestionably a hero - so forceful and determined that even when he sometimes lost a particular battle, you knew that he would never give up in his war against the Village. Caviezel's Six is a typical hero for today's TV - so full of self-doubt that you get the impression that he could crack at any moment. He's also not very likable and about as fleshed-out as a cardboard cutout. We knew just as little about McGoohan's Six's background, but McGoohan's performance was so distinctive that the viewer could feel he could relate to Six just after the first episode. And the Village, in the original, was downright eerie, with an atmosphere straight out of Kafka. The Village in the new version just seems banal. I always thought that one of the most disturbing facets of the original was the fact that everyone in the Village could remember their previous life, but was forced to act out a charade of enjoying their vapid lives. In the new Village, since most people have no recollection of their earlier life, they just seem like the kind of people you might see at the mall. Even McKellen's Number Two, who seems more concerned with his son and drugging his wife than in ruling the Village, lacks any real sense of menace. The various Twos in the original were scary precisely because they were so inhuman - in this version, one gets the impression that running the Village is just a hobby he pursues in his spare time away from his family.

His struggle was that he didn't know who was trying to get the answers: his own government or the other side.

1289329,AAW58LG72PG7I,B002U0KHNS,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[4, 6]","The PRISONER tv series of 1969 and the PRISONER remake of 2010 both detail the struggles of a man unwilling to submit to the indignities of a denial of his worth and substance of a free man. However, where Patrick McGoohan as the enigmatic Number Six enthralled the audience from the first day of his incarceration in the mysterious Village, Jim Caviezel merely postpones a sense of world weariness that never seems to reach fruition--not even in the series' closing episode where things are unveiled as muddled as they were in the first.  The remake faces the same issues that arise when any much beloved series is redone with a new cast, plot, and themes.  Who will, for example, recall Tim Daly as THE FUGITIVE's Dr. Richard Kimble when David Janssen set the standard for the Man on the Run? And here, one need not seek to enshrine Caviezel as the newest avatar as the Befuddled Man merely because the script says so.  At the very least, a remake has the same obligation to entertain as does any novel effort.  The remake of THE PRISONER fails to do so on so many levels that it is difficult to point out just how and where it went off course.  Let me start with the befuddling interweaving of the too frequent use of dream, flashback, and base reality. A character may appear hale and hearty in one sequence, die in the next, and reappear without explanation in yet the next.  If life is a dream, then at least we ought to know where dreams end and reality begins.Beginning with the initial episode, we learn of the basic plot--sort of.  A man is wandering in the desert and winds up in the Village, a place full of those who have no memory of a prior existence.  Now this premise has promise but only if the show manages to convince the viewer that the experiences of Number Six are cumulative and that what we learn in one episode impacts on the next. Sadly, there is no carryover from episode to episode. Each one is a self-contained exercise in too much cerebral activity and too little physical reality.  The director tantalizes us with a hint that there is in the Village an underground set of rebels called Dreamers who seek to fight the establishment in a way that brings to mind the Brotherhood from Orwell's 1984. These Dreamers find in their collective dreams hints of a prior existence, but nowhere does the Village leader Number Two (Ian McKellan) suggest that these dreams hold the key as to why they are there and what they must do to get out.  In the original, Patrick McGoohan knew very well why he was there.  He refused to tell his spy bosses the reason for his resignation, and if he desired to be free, then all he had to do was tell his reason.  But Cavaziel's Number Six has no idea why he is a prisoner, and unfortunately he never does and neither do we.  Cavaziel fumbles from one scene to the next, dropping in and out of reality and flashback.  It falls to McKellan to provide the show's dramatic gravitas, and he tries mightily, but he emerges as little more than a slightly interesting ringmaster of histrionics.  The show starts somewhere but goes nowhere, and that right there is its primary fault.",2,Disappointing,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,3133,"['PRISONER', 'tv', 'series', '1969', 'PRISONER', 'remake', '2010', 'detail', 'struggles', 'man', 'unwilling', 'submit', 'indignities', 'denial', 'worth', 'substance', 'free', 'man', 'However', 'where', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'enigmatic', 'Number', 'Six', 'enthralled', 'audience', 'first', 'day', 'incarceration', 'mysterious', 'Village', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'merely', 'sense', 'world', 'weariness', 'never', 'reach', 'fruition', 'not', 'even', 'series', 'closing', 'episode', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'unveiled', 'as', 'muddled', 'were', 'first', 'remake', 'same', 'issues', 'arise', 'when', 'much', 'beloved', 'series', 'redone', 'new', 'cast', 'plot', 'themes', 'Who', 'will', 'example', 'recall', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'THE', 'FUGITIVE', 'Dr.', 'Richard', 'Kimble', 'when', 'David', 'Janssen', 'set', 'standard', 'Man', 'Run', 'here', 'one', 'need', 'not', 'seek', 'enshrine', 'Caviezel', 'newest', 'avatar', 'Befuddled', 'Man', 'merely', 'script', 'so', 'very', 'least', 'remake', 'same', 'obligation', 'entertain', 'novel', 'effort', 'remake', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'do', 'so', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'difficult', 'point', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'where', 'went', 'off', 'course', 'Let', 'start', 'befuddling', 'interweaving', 'too', 'frequent', 'use', 'dream', 'flashback', 'base', 'reality', 'character', 'may', 'appear', 'hale', 'hearty', 'one', 'sequence', 'die', 'next', 'reappear', 'explanation', 'yet', 'next', 'life', 'dream', 'then', 'least', 'ought', 'know', 'where', 'dreams', 'end', 'reality', 'begins.Beginning', 'initial', 'episode', 'learn', 'basic', 'plot', 'sort', 'man', 'wandering', 'desert', 'up', 'Village', 'place', 'full', 'who', 'have', 'memory', 'prior', 'existence', 'Now', 'premise', 'promise', 'only', 'show', 'convince', 'viewer', 'experiences', 'Number', 'Six', 'are', 'cumulative', 'what', 'learn', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'Sadly', 'carryover', 'episode', 'episode', 'one', 'self-contained', 'exercise', 'too', 'much', 'cerebral', 'activity', 'too', 'little', 'physical', 'reality', 'director', 'hint', 'Village', 'underground', 'set', 'rebels', 'called', 'Dreamers', 'who', 'seek', 'fight', 'establishment', 'way', 'mind', 'Brotherhood', 'Orwell', '1984', 'Dreamers', 'find', 'collective', 'dreams', 'hints', 'prior', 'existence', 'nowhere', 'Village', 'leader', 'Number', 'Two', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'suggest', 'dreams', 'hold', 'key', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'get', 'out', 'original', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'knew', 'very', 'well', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'refused', 'tell', 'spy', 'reason', 'resignation', 'desired', 'be', 'free', 'then', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'tell', 'reason', 'Cavaziel', 'Number', 'Six', 'idea', 'why', 'prisoner', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'neither', 'do', 'Cavaziel', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'dropping', 'reality', 'flashback', 'McKellan', 'provide', 'show', 'dramatic', 'gravitas', 'mightily', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'ringmaster', 'histrionics', 'show', 'somewhere', 'nowhere', 'right', 'primary', 'fault']",The Prisoner
1289330,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B002U0KHNS,Matthew Kresal,"[6, 9]","A man resigns from a mysterious agency. Soon, he finds himself in a place known only as ""the Village"" where nobody has a name but is a number where he's re-dubbed Six by its leader a man known only as Two. Resisting Two's attempts to break his mind with his insistence ""I am not a number, I am a free man,"" Six begins trying to escape while trying to piece together what and where the Village really is. That, in short, is the premise of the six episode miniseries re-imaging of the classic 1967 Patrick McGoohan TV series The Prisoner. The Prisoner is an intriguing psychological thriller with sci-fi overtones.The miniseries is anchored by a fine cast. Jim Caviezal plays Six, a man lost in a strange world and always on his guard against everyone and everything around him, who is a radically different character from the McGoohan version. His foe is Sir Ian McKellen as Two, the Big Brother like leader who seems benevolent yet is in fact a manipulative and cunning man who brings to mind memories of Leo Mckern in the original series. The villagers include Two's son 11-12 (Jamie Campbell Bower), the beautiful but mysterious doctor 313 (Ruth Wilson) and 4-15 (Hayley Atwell) who has some connection to Six's old life. Together they bring to life the assorted characters who occupy the Village.By definition, this is a re-imaging of the original series. The biggest change being the focus is on the mind games between Six and Two, making this more of a psychological thriller then the original perhaps was. These include introducing the concept of the Village being the only thing in existence which does stretch creditability quite a bit. More successful are mind games such as in Harmony when Six is told he has brother for example. More successful perhaps is the setting for these mind games is an intriguing new version of the Village set in the middle of the desert. Like in the original, it is here that the sci-fi overtones to come in. With them the series explores issues such as electronic surveillance, mind control and the ability of an individual to resist conforming with society allowing for some intriguing social commentary along the way. Also intriguing is the clever playing with flashbacks to Six's previous life which are not be what they seem. Having said all that, things can be a bit too surreal and downright confusing at times so if you don't have a open mind and don't pick up clues as the miniseries goes on, things can (and will) be baffling. Overall, the re-imaging works splendidly.There's homages to the original series as well. These include such things as the old man's costume at the beginning of episode one (the role was originally meant as a cameo for the late Patrick McGoohan) and the return of the mysterious balloon like guard Rover. Perhaps the biggest homage lie in the various episode titles which are all derived from original series including Arrival and Checkmate to name just two. This helps to remind the audience that, though this is at times a radical re-imagining of the series, the past hasn't been completely forgotten about.By blending fine acting, mind games, an intriguing setting, homages to the original series, and clever playing with story-lines and ideas this version of The Prisoner becomes, while not a classic, an intriguing psychological thriller with sci-fi overtones. Are you interested? Then prepare to take a classic TV series in an intriguing new direction.

In some respects, McGoohan's series, as good as it is, now seems a little dated, almost but not quite, a parody of itself,like watching AUSTIN POWERS. And McGoohan, by his own admission,never had a clear vision of an ending. Instead, he just made the last episode and left town with a lot of unanswered questions. This version, however, is much more thought out. But, you have to give it some thought, which is the idea. If you watch this and get bored, then go back to McGoohan's fine series with it's psychedelic aspect and relive your youth during the turbulent 60's. That's fine. But if you want to see those very same aspects depicted in today's much more dangerous world, then this is for you. But watch it to understand it, not to compare it.

The original is a classic and I can watch it anytime.  This is a different take on the premise, and unlike the original, this one had and end in site from the beginning.No one really understands exactly what the meaning is behind the original series ending.  Patrick McGoohan wasn't talking, and even if he did know, he took that secret to the grave with him.So, here we have a completely different location, yet it still feels like the location in a way from the original.  You're trapped, yet it's like a perfect place; why would you want to leave?The same issues of personal freedom are addressed here, but also with an eye to personal privacy in our own world.  The implications from this ending still leaves me thinking and I am happy to watch this over and over, just like the old one.  I do regret that this has not been released on Blu-Ray in the U.S. yet.Jim Caviezal doesn't have the acting chops this role requires.  This is one point for sure that is difficult not to make a comparison with McGoohan's performance as Mcgoohan had an imense acting range that few can touch, but at least get somebody not so stiff all the time.  I don't know how he does it, but Caviezel comes off as cardboard and sanctimopnious at the same time, but never engaging.  McKellen is as good a Number Two as any from the original.  Hayley Atwell is perfectly suited to her role.I visited Portmerion recently, solely because of my fascination with the original series.  An employee there explained to me that it wouldn't have been possible for them to film there now for the remake as they are always booked with guests.  Now I want to visit Swakupmund in Africa; it just looks so cool.It's true that many were dissapointed with this remake, but people's expectations are not always based on reality.  I say, watch it again with an open mind.  Get over your dissapointment that  it didn't meet your expectations and try to see it for what it really is.  Try to see it as if the original never existed; go into to it without any expectations, good or bad.  When something becomes old it becomes sacred in many people's minds and hearts.  You know what?

1289344,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B002U0KHNS,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[6, 9]","A man wakes up in the desert - he has no idea how he got there.  He finds another man at the brink of death.  Despite that and the wide open spaces, we soon get the idea that the dying man is the one closer to escape.Making his way to a burgeoning village in the desert, the man finds himself in an apparently unreal society.  It looks normal enough except that the inhabitants know of no existence outside their village, or any existence in which they possess names instead of being possessed by identities as numbers.Be seeing you...number sixIt's hard to give an effective critique of this remake without running into the question of whether the reviewer is motivated by his fan-love of the original or whether the new issue is failing on its own.There's no question that this 2009 version goes its own direction.  The cold-war paranoia and 60's trippiness of the original is replaced with a gritty, 21st century head-job.  Time and space seem to bend in the story - we have frequent segues to 6's life in Manhattan shortly after he resigns from some...shadowy organization.  But are these really flashbacks, or are we seeing an existence or delusion, or are we seeing 6 float between two existences in series?WHAT WENT WRONG?I have no doubt that the new ""The Prisoner"" could have succeeded going in a different direction, and could have easily failed by following its iconic model too closely.  It's academic as to whether the show should have been more or less faithful than it was, because the series fails for an entirely different reason: by the first half of the first episode, you realize that you have no idea what's going on, and there are no signs that that's going to change.Basically, the script goes to great lengths in making you doubt what your own eyes see - but since you're a viewer, seeing is all you can do.  The story so effectively convinces the viewer to disassociate its story from reality that the scenes don't even connect with each other - for its incoherence, this could have been a Cremaster movie.  Instead of a compelling story built around a determined character working against a vague but clearly menacing enemy, we have Jim Caviezel and Ian McKellan basically drifting in each other's dreams.  Where is this story going?  Is the story even moving at all?  It takes little time before the story falls into a horrible trap and makes the viewer feel as if he too has become a prisoner - of this series.I am in complete agreement with the idea that drama doesn't have to be breezy or crystal clear - but there is a point when a story becomes so enigmatic that there's no point in even trying to decipher its mysteries.  ""The Prisoner"" remake seems to have run well past that line, embracing enigma for its own sake.I will say that the actors are totally blameless - especially the leads who inject some great vigor in their roles.  McKellen chews up the boundless scenery.  Unfortunately, the actors can do no more than emulating the illusion of their village - where everybody simply accepts their reality, and there is very little sense of menace that a hidden element must work mercilessly against those who won't conform.BY HOOK OR BY CROOK, We must confirm the following: No featurettes or extras were viewed in preparation for this review (and if there were, the memory was probably extracted from our heads).  Also, while we at ""Rottenberg's rotten book review"" had a lot of fun with ""The Prisoner"" - that was in our college days, so we can't be considered hardcore fans.",2,Incomprehensible and as boring as hell,1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,3512,"['man', 'up', 'desert', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'man', 'brink', 'death', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'soon', 'get', 'idea', 'dying', 'man', 'one', 'closer', 'escape.Making', 'way', 'burgeoning', 'village', 'desert', 'man', 'apparently', 'unreal', 'society', 'normal', 'enough', 'inhabitants', 'know', 'existence', 'village', 'existence', 'possess', 'names', 'instead', 'being', 'possessed', 'identities', 'numbers.Be', 'seeing', 'number', 'sixIt', 'hard', 'give', 'effective', 'critique', 'remake', 'running', 'question', 'reviewer', 'motivated', 'fan-love', 'original', 'new', 'issue', 'failing', 'question', '2009', 'version', 'own', 'direction', 'cold-war', 'paranoia', '60', 'trippiness', 'original', 'replaced', 'gritty', '21st', 'century', 'head-job', 'Time', 'space', 'seem', 'bend', 'story', 'have', 'frequent', 'segues', '6', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'shortly', 'shadowy', 'organization', 'are', 'really', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'seeing', 'existence', 'delusion', 'are', 'seeing', '6', 'float', 'two', 'existences', 'series', 'WHAT', 'WENT', 'WRONG', 'have', 'doubt', 'new', 'Prisoner', 'could', 'have', 'succeeded', 'going', 'different', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'failed', 'following', 'iconic', 'model', 'too', 'closely', 'academic', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'faithful', 'was', 'series', 'entirely', 'different', 'reason', 'first', 'half', 'first', 'episode', 'realize', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'are', 'signs', 'going', 'change.Basically', 'script', 'great', 'lengths', 'making', 'doubt', 'what', 'own', 'eyes', 'see', ""'re"", 'viewer', 'seeing', 'can', 'do', 'story', 'so', 'effectively', 'viewer', 'disassociate', 'story', 'reality', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'connect', 'other', 'incoherence', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Cremaster', 'movie', 'Instead', 'compelling', 'story', 'built', 'determined', 'character', 'working', 'vague', 'clearly', 'menacing', 'enemy', 'have', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'basically', 'drifting', 'other', 'dreams', 'Where', 'story', 'going', 'story', 'even', 'moving', 'little', 'time', 'story', 'horrible', 'trap', 'viewer', 'feel', 'too', 'become', 'prisoner', 'series.I', 'am', 'complete', 'agreement', 'idea', 'drama', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'breezy', 'crystal', 'clear', 'point', 'when', 'story', 'so', 'enigmatic', 'point', 'even', 'trying', 'decipher', 'mysteries', 'Prisoner', 'remake', 'have', 'run', 'well', 'line', 'embracing', 'enigma', 'own', 'sake.I', 'will', 'say', 'actors', 'are', 'totally', 'blameless', 'especially', 'leads', 'who', 'inject', 'great', 'vigor', 'roles', 'McKellen', 'up', 'boundless', 'scenery', 'Unfortunately', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'emulating', 'illusion', 'village', 'where', 'everybody', 'simply', 'reality', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'menace', 'hidden', 'element', 'must', 'work', 'mercilessly', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'conform.BY', 'HOOK', 'OR', 'BY', 'CROOK', 'must', 'confirm', 'following', 'featurettes', 'extras', 'were', 'viewed', 'preparation', 'review', 'were', 'memory', 'was', 'probably', 'extracted', 'heads', 'Also', 'Rottenberg', 'rotten', 'book', 'review', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'Prisoner', 'was', 'college', 'days', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'hardcore', 'fans']",The Prisoner

A faithful remake of the original show.If you are looking for the adventures of Number Six as presented by Patrick McGoohan with a new cast, you will absolutely be disappointed by this series, as it does not do that or try to do it.If you are expecting a sequel to the original series, again, you will be disappointed.  It is very clear that this show and the original show share essentially no continuity.That said, this is an extremely intelligently written television show with many themes that are highly relevant to the modern, digital world.  I can't fully explain the plot without spoiling significant parts of the plot, but suffice it to say that this is a TV show with a lot to say, with very interesting characters, and with a very entertaining plot.Yes, nobody could ever be the original #6.  McGoohan's dogged, clever, steely-eyed defiance cannot be matched by any modern actor, however this show does not ask its lead to try.  The much more human character played by James Caviziel is very interesting in his own right, as is Sir Ian's fascinating #2.You can have your love for the original series and still enjoy this as its own, and very clever and intersting thing.People angrily punching out ""one star"" reviews really need to think this over.  Are you seriously giving an interesting, intelligent mini-series one star just because it wasn't a good remake or didn't measure up possibly the greatest TV show of all time?In a world in which Jersey Shore and The Real Housewives of Insane Screaming Rich Person County exist this is not a one star show.  Let go of your preconceptions and your nerd cred at having seen and understood the original and look at this for what it is: a smart, tightly written, well acted sci-fi mini series staring some very major acting talents and beautifully shot to boot.",4,Set your expectations aside and enjoy the ride,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,1906,"['Here', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'not:1', 'continuation', 'original', 'story.2', 'faithful', 'remake', 'original', 'show.If', 'are', 'looking', 'adventures', 'Number', 'Six', 'presented', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'new', 'cast', 'will', 'absolutely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'series', 'not', 'do', 'try', 'do', 'it.If', 'are', 'expecting', 'sequel', 'original', 'series', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'very', 'clear', 'show', 'original', 'show', 'share', 'essentially', 'continuity.That', 'said', 'extremely', 'intelligently', 'written', 'television', 'show', 'many', 'themes', 'are', 'highly', 'relevant', 'modern', 'digital', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fully', 'explain', 'plot', 'spoiling', 'significant', 'parts', 'plot', 'say', 'TV', 'show', 'lot', 'say', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters', 'very', 'entertaining', 'plot.Yes', 'nobody', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'original', '6', 'McGoohan', 'dogged', 'clever', 'steely-eyed', 'defiance', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'matched', 'modern', 'actor', 'however', 'show', 'not', 'ask', 'lead', 'try', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'character', 'played', 'James', 'Caviziel', 'very', 'interesting', 'own', 'right', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'fascinating', '2.You', 'can', 'have', 'love', 'original', 'series', 'still', 'enjoy', 'own', 'very', 'clever', 'intersting', 'thing.People', 'angrily', 'punching', 'out', 'one', 'star', 'reviews', 'really', 'need', 'think', 'over', 'Are', 'seriously', 'giving', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'mini-series', 'one', 'star', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'remake', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'TV', 'show', 'time', 'world', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'Real', 'Housewives', 'Insane', 'Screaming', 'Rich', 'Person', 'County', 'exist', 'not', 'one', 'star', 'show', 'Let', 'go', 'preconceptions', 'nerd', 'cred', 'having', 'seen', 'understood', 'original', 'look', 'what', 'smart', 'tightly', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'sci-fi', 'mini', 'series', 'staring', 'very', 'major', 'acting', 'talents', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'boot']",The Prisoner
1289347,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B002U0KHNS,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 4]","As of yet, I have never seen an episode of the original THE PRISONER.  I know the show has a massive and very loyal cult following. Lines from the show have become part of the popular jargon: ""I am not a number. I am a free man."", ""Be seeing you."", and, ""Everybody votes for a dictator.""  References to the show can be found all through popular culture. It's a very influential piece of television.  Therefore, even though I've never seen the original, I was excited when I heard that AMC had made a new THE PRISONER.Seen in six episodes, 2009's THE PRISONER miniseries revolves around the protagonist, #6 (Jim Caviezel) , a man with selected amnesia who awakes and finds himself in the middle of a desert in a world that he knows isn't real, and #2 (Ian McKellen), the leader and virtual dictator of the Village that #6 finds that he is now a part. In the Village, no one has a name, just a number, but everyone seems happy and content.  However, much of that happiness is an illusion and #6 searches to find out what's really going on in the Village and why residents often hide their true feelings from each other.  Through a series of flashbacks and the opening sequence, we learn that #6 used to work for a major international corporation and resigned (or at least thinks he did).  Apparently, his superiors didn't like that.  While #6 searches to uncover the truth and remember his real life, he is met at every turn by #2 who is bent on keeping #6's resistance in line and breaking his spirit.  #6 wants out, but as #2 tells him, there is no out, only in.From what I've gathered, and particularly after listening to the audio commentaries and featurettes on the DVDs, THE PRISONER isn't so much a remake of the original British series, but more of a re-imagining.  There are references to the original, some characters have kept their numbers and names, and some scenes are shot almost in a sequence by sequence recreation but there is a lot that has been changed.  The 2009 THE PRISONER isn't so much about a former secret agent being held in an actual physical prison against his will as it is about a former corporate executive tired with the rat race trying to escape the mental imprisonment he feels.Jim Caviezel does a decent job as #6, but it is Ian McKellen as #2 who really shines in this miniseries.  Even though #6 is supposed to be the hero, the audience is left feeling as bemuddled about his character and personality as #6 seems to feel.  You want to like the guy and root for him, but he seems so unsure of himself that you are just as unsure in rooting for him.  McKellen as #2, on the other hand, is definitely the villain and he's such a strong villain that you actually find yourself rooting for him.  #2 is the penultimate politician and though you know his motives are anything but pure, he's such a strong character that you are just drawn to him.  #6 has a love interest in THE PRISONER in #313, portrayed by Ruth Wilson.  Wilson does a good job at balancing the war of wits between #6 and #2 and keeping #6 grounded in something other than his own insecurity.I really enjoyed the first few episodes of THE PRISONER. However, by the fourth episode I started to figure out what was happening and I began to feel ambiguous by the whole concept.  By the time I finished the last episode, ""Checkmate"", I was disappointed.  I give credit to the producers for actually wrapping up the series and not leaving it opened.  However, the ending is unsatisfying.  The conclusion of the series goes against everything that is right, just, and noble in the world.  I realize that the original show ended even more unsatisfying than this one, but that's why fans have been clamoring for more THE PRISONER for years.  Not only that, but there are several events that happen that don't make much sense within the confines of the universe that THE PRISONER establishes.THE PRISONER isn't a bad miniseries.  It starts off strong, but then weakens up.  It's a complete story that's not left open-ended. The acting is strong and some of the scenery and sets are impressive.  There are a lot of references and illusions to the original series, but probably just enough to frustrate most THE PRISONER fans instead of engaging them.  It's worth watching, but don't be upset if when the final credits roll you are left disappointed. Be seeing you.The DVD has an audio commentary with the mini-series' creators on the episodes ""Arrival"" and ""Checkmate"".  There's a separate disc of just special features that includes two making-of featurettes, THE PRISONER Comic-Con Panel, and an interview with Sir Ian McKellen.",3,"Entertaining, Yet Disappointing",1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,4619,"['yet', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'original', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'know', 'show', 'massive', 'very', 'loyal', 'cult', 'following', 'Lines', 'show', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'popular', 'jargon', 'am', 'not', 'number', 'am', 'free', 'man', 'Be', 'seeing', 'Everybody', 'dictator', 'References', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'popular', 'culture', 'very', 'influential', 'piece', 'television', 'Therefore', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'AMC', 'had', 'made', 'new', 'THE', 'PRISONER.Seen', 'six', 'episodes', '2009', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'protagonist', '6', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'man', 'selected', 'amnesia', 'who', 'middle', 'desert', 'world', ""n't"", 'real', '2', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'leader', 'virtual', 'dictator', 'Village', '6', 'finds', 'now', 'part', 'Village', 'one', 'name', 'just', 'number', 'everyone', 'happy', 'content', 'However', 'much', 'happiness', 'illusion', '6', 'searches', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Village', 'why', 'residents', 'often', 'hide', 'true', 'feelings', 'other', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'opening', 'sequence', 'learn', '6', 'used', 'work', 'major', 'international', 'corporation', 'resigned', 'least', 'thinks', 'did', 'Apparently', 'superiors', 'did', ""n't"", '6', 'searches', 'uncover', 'truth', 'remember', 'real', 'life', 'met', 'turn', '2', 'who', 'bent', 'keeping', '6', 'resistance', 'line', 'breaking', 'spirit', '6', 'out', 'as', '2', 'tells', 'out', 'only', 'what', ""'ve"", 'gathered', 'particularly', 'listening', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'featurettes', 'DVDs', 'THE', 'PRISONER', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'remake', 'original', 'British', 'series', 'more', 're-imagining', 'are', 'references', 'original', 'characters', 'have', 'kept', 'numbers', 'names', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'almost', 'sequence', 'sequence', 'recreation', 'lot', 'been', 'changed', '2009', 'THE', 'PRISONER', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'former', 'secret', 'agent', 'being', 'held', 'actual', 'physical', 'prison', 'will', 'former', 'corporate', 'executive', 'tired', 'rat', 'race', 'trying', 'escape', 'mental', 'imprisonment', 'Caviezel', 'decent', 'job', '6', 'Ian', 'McKellen', '2', 'who', 'really', 'miniseries', 'Even', '6', 'supposed', 'be', 'hero', 'audience', 'left', 'feeling', 'bemuddled', 'character', 'personality', 'as', '6', 'feel', 'want', 'like', 'guy', 'root', 'so', 'unsure', 'are', 'just', 'unsure', 'rooting', 'McKellen', '2', 'other', 'hand', 'definitely', 'villain', 'such', 'strong', 'villain', 'actually', 'find', 'rooting', '2', 'penultimate', 'politician', 'know', 'motives', 'are', 'anything', 'pure', 'such', 'strong', 'character', 'are', 'just', 'drawn', '6', 'love', 'interest', 'THE', 'PRISONER', '313', 'portrayed', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'Wilson', 'good', 'job', 'balancing', 'war', 'wits', '6', '2', 'keeping', '6', 'grounded', 'something', 'other', 'own', 'insecurity.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'However', 'fourth', 'episode', 'started', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'began', 'feel', 'ambiguous', 'whole', 'concept', 'time', 'finished', 'last', 'episode', 'Checkmate', 'was', 'disappointed', 'give', 'credit', 'producers', 'actually', 'wrapping', 'up', 'series', 'not', 'leaving', 'opened', 'However', 'ending', 'unsatisfying', 'conclusion', 'series', 'everything', 'right', 'just', 'noble', 'world', 'realize', 'original', 'show', 'ended', 'even', 'more', 'unsatisfying', 'one', 'why', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'clamoring', 'more', 'PRISONER', 'years', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'several', 'events', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'confines', 'universe', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'establishes.THE', 'PRISONER', ""n't"", 'bad', 'miniseries', 'strong', 'then', 'up', 'complete', 'story', 'not', 'left', 'open-ended', 'acting', 'strong', 'scenery', 'sets', 'are', 'impressive', 'are', 'lot', 'references', 'illusions', 'original', 'series', 'probably', 'just', 'enough', 'frustrate', 'most', 'PRISONER', 'fans', 'instead', 'engaging', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'upset', 'when', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'are', 'left', 'disappointed', 'Be', 'seeing', 'you.The', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'mini-series', 'creators', 'episodes', 'Arrival', 'Checkmate', 'separate', 'disc', 'just', 'special', 'features', 'two', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'PRISONER', 'Comic-Con', 'Panel', 'interview', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen']",The Prisoner
