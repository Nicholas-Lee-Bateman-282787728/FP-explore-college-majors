1274971,AX43OQTW20XUT,B002KLA9FS,Crosby03,"[4, 5]","I have a lot of workout DVDs, and bought this one because Valerie has inspired me. However, I am not a fan of this product. The DVD is two workouts, one 20-minute beginner and one 30-minute bikini workout. First of all, I do not like the trainer in this video. He is not very relatable and just seems a bit odd to me. Second, this video is mostly lower body work - I would say well over half is lunges and squats. Lastly, while I love Valerie and find her completely relatable and sweet, the cueing is not great. She and the trainer go different directions and aren't completely on the same page.

Their ""slow"" moves are different than my ""slow"" moves, but otherwise it's really good.However, as much as I like Valarie Bertinelli, she does way too much ""cutsie"" chatter during the workout.  It wasn't too bad the first few times I exercised but now I dread hearing her constant comments.
