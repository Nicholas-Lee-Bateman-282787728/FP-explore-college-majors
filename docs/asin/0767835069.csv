I won't go into all that much detail about the movie save to say that it hit the spot for me. I cared for the characters and I felt for their terrible situations. Susan Lowenstein (Played By The Great Barbra Streisand) saves Tom Wingo and by the end of the movie the two are able to return to their troubled, yet bearable lives.While the book no doubt is fuller and even better, I feel the movie more than held its own (Granted, I Have Yet To Read The Book). I loved the supporting characters like George Carlin and Gould, the real-life son of Barbara Streisand. Streisand was incredible! She showed that she can indeed direct a top tier movie with a top tier cast. I only wish that they had made a cinematic sequal (Like They Did For Godfather & Jurassic Park) because I wanted to know what happens to the characters 10 & 20 years later.

20529,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767835069,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 5]","I can't help but wonder how good this film may have been had it had another director, maybe one more attentive to the nature of the story.  Instead, actress/singer/director Barbara Streisand helms this picture, and she does a lot more damage than good.  Instead of creating a film that is rooted in raw emotion and heartbreaking tragedy she turns this film into a longwinded soap opera with over-the-top acting and `romance novel' style dialog.  In fact, the last quarter of the film is so ridiculous that I seriously wanted to vomit amidst all the saccharine facileness.The film tells the story of Tom Wingo, a southern `good ol' boy' who is troubled by a dark family secret, a secret that has pushed his sister to attempt suicide.  While she lies in a hospital room, Tom ventures to New York and meets his sister's psychiatrist Susan.  Tom is apposed to his sister seeing a shrink, but the more he sees Susan the more he begins to open up, about his life, his wife, his mother and eventually uncovering the family secret that has haunted him for so many years.The idea behind the film is a good one in my opinion (I have not read the book, although I don't hear good things about it so I don't think I will) but the handling of the material really sidelines the film in my opinion.  Instead of taking a raw and emotional approach to the film, the soap operaish delivery makes light of the tragedy surrounding the film and ultimately turns the serious subject of abuse, suicide and murder into a joke.  All of this weighty material is more or less just a backdrop for Tom and Susan to fall in love and in the end the film makes their relationship the weightiest subject; expecting the audience to swell up with tears at the prospect of them having to leave one another as apposed to the audience being emotionally responsive to the turmoil boiling within Tom's past.The acting doesn't really help the matter.I am not a fan of Nick Nolte.  I never have been and never will be.  He has really only delivered a few (countable on one hand) good performances, and this is not one of them.  His over-the-top delivery of Tom's emotions is comical to say the least.  He has one good scene, when he finally breaks down and exposes his past.  It's the only scene where his emotions seem real, and it's the only respectable `scene' in the film (which ends up getting ruined by the overly sentimental `cry in my bosom' closing).  Streisand is better than Nolte, but too clich&eacute;d.  The only good acting comes from the supporting cast, notably Blythe Danner (who is sorely underused) and Kate Nelligan (who received an Oscar nomination for her performance).  They are not enough to save the film, but they at least prove to add some interest to their scenes.In the end I can honestly say that `The Prince of Tides' is a missed opportunity, which I think is what makes the sting of the films failure hurt all the more.  It could have been so deep and haunting but instead comes off vapid and hollow.",2,"It's all about presentation, and this film is presented in the worst possible way...",1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,2991,"['ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'had', 'director', 'maybe', 'one', 'more', 'attentive', 'nature', 'story', 'Instead', 'actress/singer/director', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'picture', 'lot', 'more', 'damage', 'good', 'Instead', 'creating', 'film', 'rooted', 'raw', 'emotion', 'heartbreaking', 'tragedy', 'film', 'longwinded', 'soap', 'opera', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'romance', 'novel', 'style', 'dialog', 'fact', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'seriously', 'wanted', 'vomit', 'saccharine', 'facileness.The', 'film', 'story', 'Tom', 'Wingo', 'southern', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'who', 'troubled', 'dark', 'family', 'secret', 'secret', 'pushed', 'sister', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'hospital', 'room', 'Tom', 'ventures', 'New', 'York', 'sister', 'psychiatrist', 'Susan', 'Tom', 'apposed', 'sister', 'seeing', 'shrink', 'more', 'more', 'open', 'up', 'life', 'wife', 'mother', 'eventually', 'uncovering', 'family', 'secret', 'haunted', 'so', 'many', 'years.The', 'idea', 'film', 'good', 'one', 'opinion', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'good', 'things', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'handling', 'material', 'really', 'film', 'opinion', 'Instead', 'taking', 'raw', 'emotional', 'approach', 'film', 'soap', 'operaish', 'delivery', 'light', 'tragedy', 'surrounding', 'film', 'ultimately', 'serious', 'subject', 'abuse', 'suicide', 'murder', 'joke', 'weighty', 'material', 'more', 'less', 'just', 'backdrop', 'Tom', 'Susan', 'fall', 'love', 'end', 'film', 'relationship', 'weightiest', 'subject', 'expecting', 'audience', 'swell', 'up', 'tears', 'prospect', 'having', 'leave', 'one', 'apposed', 'audience', 'being', 'emotionally', 'responsive', 'turmoil', 'boiling', 'Tom', 'past.The', 'acting', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'matter.I', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'really', 'only', 'delivered', 'few', 'countable', 'one', 'hand', 'good', 'performances', 'not', 'one', 'over-the-top', 'delivery', 'Tom', 'emotions', 'comical', 'say', 'least', 'one', 'good', 'scene', 'when', 'finally', 'down', 'past', 'only', 'scene', 'where', 'emotions', 'seem', 'real', 'only', 'respectable', 'scene', 'film', 'up', 'getting', 'ruined', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'cry', 'bosom', 'closing', 'Streisand', 'better', 'Nolte', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.', 'only', 'good', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'notably', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'who', 'sorely', 'underused', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'who', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'least', 'prove', 'add', 'interest', 'scenes.In', 'end', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'think', 'what', 'sting', 'films', 'failure', 'hurt', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'deep', 'haunting', 'instead', 'vapid', 'hollow']",The Prince of Tides VHS

20531,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0767835069,Anthony Hinde,"[8, 10]","Up until this film I did not have a very positive view of Barbara Streisand's acting ability.  Despite my tendency to hold on to my opinions past their time, I have changed my mind in a dramatic way. This film  undeniably proves that Streisand is a very talented actress. Nolte on the  other hand has always had great potential, even if it hasn't been realized  in every film he appeared in. No need to worry, in &quot;The Prince of  Tides&quot; he is tremendous.This wonderful drama contains  elements of horror and suspense but its strength comes from the romance  that blossoms between the psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein, (Streisand), and  the failing football coach, Tom Wingo, (Nolte).  These two have a chemistry  which draws them together against their will and sucks the audience along  for the ride. Additional complexity, derived from the fact that they are  both married, also enriches the experience.Because the story is  ostensibly about the struggles Tom goes through as a result of his Sister's  latest suicide attempt, the film often travels back in time. Lowenstein  needs Tom to fill in the blanks about his sister's life so that she can be  better treated. Unfortunately Tom is almost as reluctant to recall his  childhood events as his comatose sister.  This is not at all surprising  when we eventually discover all the details.We slowly learn,  along with Lowenstein, about a severe and traumatic family history. Three  children, of whom Tom is one, are spiritually imprisoned by an abusive  father and a manipulative, ambitious mother. Their only comfort is in each  other, which is expressed perfectly whenever their parents fight, by their  escape underwater where they hold hands in a ring of love. In the present  though, even this bond has been sundered. Tom's older brother is now dead  and his sister has lived away from him in New York for many years.There are many sub-plots running through the story. Tom's inability  to deal with his wife, Susan's problems with her son Bernard and her famous  violinist husband, Tom and his Sister's repressed memories and his mother's  attempts to keep it all hidden. Overall it is undeniably a rich and  compelling film. It serves as an example of how good drama can be.",5,There's some things you never get over.,958003200,"05 11, 2000",2000,2239,"['Up', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'very', 'positive', 'view', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'acting', 'ability', 'tendency', 'hold', 'opinions', 'time', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'dramatic', 'way', 'film', 'undeniably', 'Streisand', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'Nolte', 'other', 'hand', 'always', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'even', ""n't"", 'been', 'realized', 'film', 'appeared', 'need', 'worry', 'quot', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'quot', 'tremendous.This', 'wonderful', 'drama', 'elements', 'horror', 'suspense', 'strength', 'romance', 'psychiatrist', 'Susan', 'Lowenstein', 'Streisand', 'failing', 'football', 'coach', 'Tom', 'Wingo', 'Nolte', 'two', 'have', 'chemistry', 'together', 'will', 'sucks', 'audience', 'ride', 'Additional', 'complexity', 'derived', 'fact', 'are', 'married', 'also', 'experience.Because', 'story', 'ostensibly', 'struggles', 'Tom', 'result', 'Sister', 'latest', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'film', 'often', 'back', 'time', 'Lowenstein', 'Tom', 'fill', 'blanks', 'sister', 'life', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'treated', 'Unfortunately', 'Tom', 'almost', 'reluctant', 'recall', 'childhood', 'events', 'comatose', 'sister', 'not', 'surprising', 'when', 'eventually', 'discover', 'details.We', 'slowly', 'learn', 'Lowenstein', 'severe', 'traumatic', 'family', 'history', 'Three', 'children', 'whom', 'Tom', 'one', 'are', 'spiritually', 'imprisoned', 'abusive', 'father', 'manipulative', 'ambitious', 'mother', 'only', 'comfort', 'other', 'expressed', 'perfectly', 'whenever', 'parents', 'fight', 'escape', 'underwater', 'where', 'hold', 'hands', 'ring', 'love', 'present', 'even', 'bond', 'been', 'sundered', 'Tom', 'older', 'brother', 'now', 'dead', 'sister', 'lived', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'many', 'are', 'many', 'sub-plots', 'running', 'story', 'Tom', 'inability', 'deal', 'wife', 'Susan', 'problems', 'son', 'Bernard', 'famous', 'violinist', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Sister', 'repressed', 'memories', 'mother', 'attempts', 'keep', 'hidden', 'Overall', 'undeniably', 'rich', 'compelling', 'film', 'example', 'how', 'good', 'drama', 'can', 'be']",The Prince of Tides VHS
20532,A2EL3990HXOMZB,0767835069,Antonio Robert,"[13, 14]","Actually, the sentence in the title is not mine; the author of the book Pat Conroy was so grateful for the film that he gave the director such a name...Conroy must have realised limitations of a film in comparison with the book. &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; book is rather thick and to make a two-hour movie out of it is difficult. The film &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; was also criticised of being too thin in comparison with the book -- and, in fact, the author John Irving himself wrote the script.Romantic side is highlighted over a complex, dark family story, with Streisand enjoying the starring female role to the full. She does so alongside the great performance by Nick Nolte, who plays Tom Wingo, a teacher from American South hiding much of his painful past until he gets familiar with New York psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein (Streisand).The film love story between Wingo and Lowenstein is one of the most memorable of the past decades, yet the picture also encompasses deep social undertones -- suicide, hypocrisy, lack of family understanding. There is a couple of memorable scenes; the most special one comes when Wingo finally lets the demons of the past out -- this is acting at its best on both Nolte's and Streisand's part. Although some other films also attempted something similar (e.g. &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, with Matt Damon and Robin Williams), it never was so powerful as here. The ending is bittersweet, not typically romantic but ultimately inevitable and logical for the story.Beautiful cinematography and great musical score to a large extent made this film to achieve five stars in my book.

20534,ARA48345JZPZR,0767835069,Archmaker,"[2, 8]","I loved Pat Conroy's book, The Prince of Tides.  I looked forward to the film version.  Nick Nolte was an inspired choice to play Tom Wingo.  I have no qualms with the rest of the cast.  I, too, wish that more of the story (of Luke especially) could have been told.  But, I have no major problem with the screenplay and the direction served the script fine.My problem is that Streisand as producer and director should have read the damn book a little closer when it came to the character of Lowenstein, the psychiatrist.  She was described as upper-class, slim &amp; dark,  cultured, refined &amp; immaculate.  Now, Barbra may be interesting &amp; intelligent....but classy and refined she ain't.  Not with footlong violet fingernails that would rival the Dragonlady's.  Maybe if I hadn't read the book, it would have worked...but I doubt it.Casting in a movie is half the battle.  And that her ego allowed her to cast herself in this role says more about Barbra's delusions than it does her talent.  She told the story well, but the great love and understanding between Wingo and Lowenstein just wasn't believable for me between Nolte and Streisand.Too bad, because she handled the rest of the movie pretty well.  I only wrote this because Barbra did a lot of bitching at the time that she was overlooked at Oscar time for Best Director.  I truly feel that had she cast that role to someone else and JUST directed, she would have made the list.

Her films (when she has a starring role and holds all of the cards) are long, drawn-out pieces that have the tendency to mystify an audience.  ""Prince"" is no exception.So many unnecessary scenes flog us, beat us up, wear us down.  But it's Barbra.  There is NO connection between her and Nick Nolte, his last good role beofre the DUI and the mug shot heard 'round the world.  He's good enough, but my god I want to slap him in the face for going through all of this soap opera turmoil regarding his twin sister and toying with the idea of leaving his wife and children....for Barbra.She screams, she jolts around, she sighs, she moves.  She's supposed to be beautiful, and while she is no classic beauty (was Norma Shearer?) she at least has the decency to photograph and light herself well.  Sometimes too well.The casting of George Carlin as the gay neighbor is way off base.  First, he isn't gay (in his personal life) and second, he is over-the-top gay and not so very funny for having been encouraged to act that way.  I'm surprised that Sreisand, ever the perfectionist, would have allowed this.It's a long film, like all Streisand STREISAND films.  She's the star, we bought the ticket, and we'd better sit down, shut up, watch it, and to hell with the popcorn.

The cynical, distant Nick Nolte goes to NYC after his twin sister (played by Melinda Dillon) there tries to commit suicide. He begins seeing her psychiatrist (Barbra Streisand) and through flashbacks we learn about the demons of his family's past - all of which he's learned to suppress his whole life. Conveniently Nolte's wife (Blythe Danner) takes up with another man while Nolte is falling in love with Streisand; at the end he returns to his wife though he still loves Streisand. Nolte is excellent in his role, and as is often the case when he's on screen, his persona dominates every scene he's in; Streisand is fairly bland in comparison. The movie begins to show its weaknesses after Nolte and Streisand fall in love: where the movie should be exploring their love and ""obligations"" in a hard, meaningful way, it only goes soft and paisley romantic. Why Nolte goes back to his wife, why she even wants him back, is hardly touched on; instead we get the throwaway lines, ""You love her more,"" says Streisand; ""No,"" replies Nolte, ""just longer.""

I remember finding it a fascinating film at the time which even prompted me to read the book and discover the writing quality of Conroy.  Unlike most such situations when I am disappointed by movie adaptations of great books, I found both genres to have their own beauty.  This past weekend I was loaned a copy of Prince of Tides and I spent a leisurely 2 hours enjoying this masterpiece for a second time.  Flashbacks are beautifully interspersed with real time discoveries.  Characters to love, hate, envy, pity and laugh with abound.  What impresses me most about this film is the impeccable way you find yourself switching from the lifestyle of the coastal south to the frenzy of New York City.  All cinematic elements combine to take you back and forth in time and location as the characters experience their pasts and make new memories for the future.  Nolte was brilliant.  Streisand was lovely as an actress and obviously gifted as director.  Blythe Danner was touching and talented as always, and the passage of time reveals the beauty both inner and outer she has bestowed on her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow.  Buy this film and plan an evening of enjoyment whether you are male or female, young or old.  The passage of time has done nothing to dim the quality of this film.

Why Barbra Streisand was snubbed for a Best Director nomination is a mystery, but she was nominated for a Golden Globe and by the Directors Guild of America.  Nolte also won the Golden Globe for his exemplary performance.Nick Nolte is in top form as coach Nick Wingo, a man in trouble with the present and tormented by his past.  His talent lights up the screen.  The acting doesn't skip a beat as the other characters in the movie come to light: Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Kate Nelligan, Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, George Carlin, Jason Gould and Brad Sullivan are all at the top of their game.Streisand's character, Dr Susan Lowenstein, helps Coach Wingo discover himself by forcing him to face his past.  Along the path, Wingo also opens Lowenstein eyes to aid her in viewing her own personal demons.  And, of course, love ensues.  The relationships are intricate and story is dynamic.Streisand also worked long and hard to bring some of the world's best musicians together to record the original soundtrack and her efforts paid off immensely.  The music is nothing less than brilliant from beginning to end.Bottom line: if you're looking for an uparalleled drama with a great cast, unequaled storyline and superb direction, you don't have to search beyond ""The Prince of Tides"".",5,"""The Prince of Tides"" is the King of Dramas",1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,1538,"['1992', 'awards', 'speak', 'excellence', 'work', 'art', '7', 'Oscar', 'Nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Best', 'Original', 'Score', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'Why', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Best', 'Director', 'nomination', 'mystery', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Directors', 'Guild', 'America', 'Nolte', 'also', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'exemplary', 'performance.Nick', 'Nolte', 'top', 'form', 'coach', 'Nick', 'Wingo', 'man', 'trouble', 'present', 'tormented', 'past', 'talent', 'up', 'screen', 'acting', ""n't"", 'skip', 'beat', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'come', 'light', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'Jeroen', 'Krabb', 'eacute', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Jason', 'Gould', 'Brad', 'Sullivan', 'are', 'top', 'game.Streisand', 'character', 'Dr', 'Susan', 'Lowenstein', 'Coach', 'Wingo', 'discover', 'forcing', 'face', 'past', 'path', 'Wingo', 'also', 'Lowenstein', 'eyes', 'aid', 'viewing', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'course', 'love', 'ensues', 'relationships', 'are', 'intricate', 'story', 'dynamic.Streisand', 'also', 'worked', 'long', 'hard', 'bring', 'world', 'best', 'musicians', 'together', 'record', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'efforts', 'paid', 'off', 'immensely', 'music', 'nothing', 'less', 'brilliant', 'beginning', 'end.Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'looking', 'uparalleled', 'drama', 'great', 'cast', 'unequaled', 'storyline', 'superb', 'direction', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'search', 'Prince', 'Tides']",The Prince of Tides VHS

Abilene,"[46, 48]","Streisand's semi-controversial adaptation of THE PRINCE OF TIDES may not have completely satisfied fans of the book, however, the general public fell instantly under the film's hypnotic spell - and turned it into a surprise box office smash! The decision to keep the film's focus in the present rather than the past results in the elimination of most of the novel's lengthy backstory. However, the well-condensed script (written by Conroy himself and Becky Johnson) manages to seamlessly fill in the missing information, and allows all central characters to reach a level of character development that is unusually high for a mainstream Hollywood film. As the film progresses, these characters seem especially real, and they are embodied by an absolutely flawless cast.As anyone who has read the book can attest, the characters of Tom and Lila Wingo would seem to be extremely challenging (if not almost unplayable) roles, both of which are brimming with contradictions and hidden emotions. However, Nick Nolte and Kate Neligan find the perfect balance in their portrayals, which earned them both well-dissevered Oscar nominations. Blythe Danner, Jason Gould, and Melinda Dillion all also turn in memorable performances, even though Dillion's Savannah (a lead character in the novel) has precious little screentime due to the film's structure. Barbra also gives an affecting portrayal, however, the director's chair is where she really shines this time. With it's moving storyline, compelling characters, and breathtakingly beautiful cinematography, THE PRINCE OF TIDES is film that will continue enchant audiences for years to come.About the DVD: The picture quality and sound are excellent, although it's disappointing that the many extras (which included a featurette, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and Streisand's full-length commentary track) that were included on Criterion's special edition laserdisc release are not found on this DVD. The film's original trailer and teaser are included, but I hope that all of the extras from the laserdisc will someday make their way to DVD.",5,You did mama,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,2082,"['Streisand', 'semi-controversial', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'PRINCE', 'OF', 'TIDES', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'fans', 'book', 'however', 'general', 'public', 'fell', 'instantly', 'film', 'hypnotic', 'spell', 'turned', 'surprise', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'decision', 'keep', 'film', 'focus', 'present', 'rather', 'past', 'results', 'elimination', 'most', 'novel', 'lengthy', 'backstory', 'However', 'well-condensed', 'script', 'written', 'Conroy', 'Becky', 'Johnson', 'seamlessly', 'fill', 'missing', 'information', 'central', 'characters', 'reach', 'level', 'character', 'development', 'unusually', 'high', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'film', 'characters', 'seem', 'especially', 'real', 'are', 'embodied', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'cast.As', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'attest', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Lila', 'Wingo', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'extremely', 'challenging', 'not', 'almost', 'unplayable', 'roles', 'are', 'brimming', 'contradictions', 'hidden', 'emotions', 'However', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Kate', 'Neligan', 'find', 'perfect', 'balance', 'portrayals', 'earned', 'well-dissevered', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Jason', 'Gould', 'Melinda', 'Dillion', 'also', 'turn', 'memorable', 'performances', 'even', 'Dillion', 'Savannah', 'lead', 'character', 'novel', 'precious', 'little', 'screentime', 'due', 'film', 'structure', 'Barbra', 'also', 'affecting', 'portrayal', 'however', 'director', 'chair', 'where', 'really', 'shines', 'time', 'moving', 'storyline', 'compelling', 'characters', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'PRINCE', 'OF', 'TIDES', 'film', 'will', 'continue', 'enchant', 'audiences', 'years', 'come.About', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'disappointing', 'many', 'extras', 'included', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'Streisand', 'full-length', 'commentary', 'track', 'were', 'included', 'Criterion', 'special', 'edition', 'laserdisc', 'release', 'are', 'not', 'found', 'DVD', 'film', 'original', 'trailer', 'teaser', 'are', 'included', 'hope', 'extras', 'laserdisc', 'will', 'someday', 'make', 'way', 'DVD']",The Prince of Tides VHS

20552,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0767835069,D. Litton,"[14, 17]","The events of &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; play out in such a fashion that one tends to forget how soapy and melodramatic they really are. What begins as one man's emotional awakening to the events of his past in an attempt to help his sibling generates into a run-of-the-mill romance easily found in the pages of any Harlequin novel. And yet, through acting zeal and its abidance by the rules of tearjerkers, this film actually pays off in a weird sort of way.At the center of the story is Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte), a middle-aged Southern football coach with a wife and three children. The film's calendar art opening sequence serves to show his childhood in an appealing light, yet his adult life is anything but enjoyable. His wife is estranged from him, put off by his humorous approach to serious situations and by his unwillingness to discuss the pitfalls of their marriage. When his mother, whom he clearly despises, informs him that his sister Savannah has attempted suicide again, he heads off to New York City, where he will meet with her psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand), to help her unlock the pain in Savannah's subconscious.The story's change in setting and story is the decision point for audiences, who can either accept the drama and enjoy it, or groan at the segue from the suicide angle to a romance storyline. Once in New York, Tom begins revealing events from his childhood to Lowenstein, who listens with a caring ear, perhaps more caring than the ethics of her career would allow. As their relationship begins to deepen, Tom reveals more to her, including a carefully guarded secret known only by his two siblings and mother, as well as his feelings for her.A heads up of what to watch for in this movie: its well-structured plot, which, despite its melodramatic subject matter, weaves a fine web of love, hate, revelation, and the courage to overcome hardships. The romance that eventually takes flight between Tom and Lowenstein is run-of-the-mill, from their shared family discord to their realization that it cannot last forever. Even still, these aspects are given some vitality: Tom agrees to help her son become a football player, and later antagonizes her haughty celebrity husband at a dinner party in one of the film's most memorable scenes. The bittersweet ending has been done countless times before, but it's helped by the fact that we have come to like the characters and can appreciate, if not comprehend, their situation.Even more interesting is the way in which Tom slowly begins to break down. As his resolve begins to fade, he breaks into new emotional ground, letting go of the hardships he has been holding inside all of his life. His family life is revealed in gritty detail, all of which provides reason for the attitudes he holds to presently. And when it comes time for him to break down and face his torments, we believe in his emotion because of his experiences. This is the kind of character we can come to care about deeply, through his many realizations and reawakenings.Kudos to the cast, which is stellar all around. Nolte shines as Tom, giving a powerful performance full of convincing emotion and forceful dialogue. Streisand's role as Lowenstein is good enough, better than most give her credit for; she gets the job done in front of and behind the camera with serviceable results. Add to this a supporting cast that includes Blythe Danner as Tom's wife, Kate Nelligan as his mother, and Streisand's own son, Jason Gould, as her character's son, and you have a truly becoming cast that adds zest and freshness to the script.Some may not think that this is enough for &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; to work, but in a way, it is. With a story that jumps from place to place, much like that of a soap opera, the cast is able to chew on the material with terrific gusto, making the changes of pace, setting and story easier to stomach. It's not a completely original piece, yet there is an appeal in its cliched romance, and a strong depth of feeling behind its characterization and human story.

20555,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0767835069,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 7]","In only her second directorial effort (after ""Yentl""), Barbra Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis.  She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well.The 1991 movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. Granted, she does make herself rather beatific even in her high skirts and flimsy blouses, but such expectations come with Streisand as she basically plays Tom's savior. At the same time, it is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay. Melinda Dillon has little to do as Savannah except look traumatized, which she does well. And in a not too subtle display of nepotism, Streisand's son, Jason Gould, sullenly plays the doctor's son, a musician-in-training who is coached on the finer points of football by Tom.The movie is not without flaws. First, there is a critical scene where Tom confesses to Lowenstein (as Tom calls her) what exactly happened in his childhood that none of the Wingos have been willing or able to share with anyone else.  Because of Streisand's effective juxtaposition of the long-ago violent crime with the present-day therapy session and Nolte's superb work, this is an especially powerful sequence. It feels climactic in nature given the depth of the catharsis we have been presented at that point, but the problem is that it comes about 45 minutes before the end of the movie. It is around this point that the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein following a tense, pretentious dinner party with Jeroen Krabbe holding court as her psychologically abusive husband, a world renowned violinist out to humiliate Tom. Consequently, we are given a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Luckily the film recovers toward the end before any serious damage is done. Special mention should be made of the beautiful cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt, who perfectly captures the burnished aura of the lowlands of South Carolina, and the symphonic, often swooning score by James Newton-Howard. It's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together.",4,Queen of Tides Masterfully Guides a Man's Catharsis,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,4171,"['only', 'second', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Yentl', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'be', 'masterful', 'storyteller', 'almost', 'exaggerated', 'romantic', 'sensibility', 'unfettered', 'preoccupation', 'psychoanalysis', 'obviously', 'found', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Pat', 'Conroy', 'epic', 'novel', 'Tom', 'Wingo', 'Southerner', 'failing', 'marriage', 'career', 'reflect', 'deep', 'suppression', 'abusive', 'childhood', 'memories', 'are', 'triggered', 'twin', 'sister', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'story', 'around', 'man', 'personal', 'crisis', 'versus', 'woman', 'may', 'strike', 'odd', 'given', 'Streisand', 'particularly', 'female', 'perspective', 'actually', 'Tom', 'complex', 'personal', 'journey', 'resonate', 'greater', 'sensitivity', 'result', 'fact', 'emotionalism', 'Streisand', 'musical', 'performances', 'very', 'much', 'evidence', 'here', 'lush', 'almost', 'Baroque', 'style', 'contours', 'soap', 'very', 'well.The', '1991', 'movie', 'helped', 'immeasurably', 'galvanizing', 'performance', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'who', 'layers', 'pride', 'regret', 'anger', 'sadness', 'humiliation', 'character', 'storyline', 'unbridled', 'passion', 'actor', 'sinking', 'teeth', 'juicy', 'part', 'only', 'female', 'director', 'could', 'define', 'fact', 'Streisand', 'back', 'play', 'subordinate', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Lowenstein', 'pricey', 'New', 'York', 'psychiatrist', 'treating', 'Tom', 'sister', 'Savannah', 'Granted', 'make', 'rather', 'beatific', 'even', 'high', 'skirts', 'flimsy', 'blouses', 'such', 'expectations', 'come', 'Streisand', 'basically', 'Tom', 'savior', 'same', 'time', 'probably', 'most', 'subtle', 'work', 'onscreen', 'even', 'touches', 'excess', 'often', 'detract', 'performances', 'also', 'out', 'plum', 'parts', 'wonderful', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'who', 'age', 'convincingly', 'Tom', 'upwardly', 'mother', 'dark', 'secret', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'dependably', 'effective', 'Tom', 'conflicted', 'wife', 'especially', 'excel', 'revelatory', 'conversations', 'Tom', 'dialogue', 'insightful', 'delving', 'too', 'much', 'psychobabble', 'Credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Conroy', 'Betsy', 'Johnston', 'who', 'wrote', 'superb', 'screenplay', 'Melinda', 'Dillon', 'little', 'do', 'Savannah', 'look', 'traumatized', 'well', 'not', 'too', 'subtle', 'display', 'nepotism', 'Streisand', 'son', 'Jason', 'Gould', 'sullenly', 'doctor', 'son', 'musician-in-training', 'who', 'coached', 'finer', 'points', 'football', 'Tom.The', 'movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'First', 'critical', 'scene', 'where', 'Tom', 'Lowenstein', 'Tom', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'childhood', 'none', 'Wingos', 'have', 'been', 'willing', 'able', 'share', 'anyone', 'else', 'Streisand', 'effective', 'juxtaposition', 'long-ago', 'violent', 'crime', 'present-day', 'therapy', 'session', 'Nolte', 'superb', 'work', 'especially', 'powerful', 'sequence', 'climactic', 'nature', 'given', 'depth', 'catharsis', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'point', 'problem', '45', 'minutes', 'end', 'movie', 'point', 'story', 'shifts', 'inevitable', 'affair', 'Tom', 'Lowenstein', 'following', 'tense', 'pretentious', 'dinner', 'party', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'holding', 'court', 'psychologically', 'abusive', 'husband', 'world', 'renowned', 'violinist', 'humiliate', 'Tom', 'Consequently', 'are', 'given', 'flagrant', 'detour', 'Lowenstein', 'own', 'catharsis', 'up', 'valid', 'questions', 'character', 'professionalism', 'even', 'having', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'patient', 'part', 'story', 'Streisand', 'most', 'self-indulgent', 'director', 'actor', 'follow', 'two', 'smitten', 'people', 'gauzy', 'romantic', 'walks', 'sweaty', 'lovemaking', 'candlelight', 'Luckily', 'film', 'recovers', 'end', 'serious', 'damage', 'done', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Stephen', 'Goldblatt', 'who', 'perfectly', 'burnished', 'aura', 'lowlands', 'South', 'Carolina', 'symphonic', 'often', 'swooning', 'score', 'James', 'Newton-Howard', 'impressive', 'accomplishment', 'translate', 'Conroy', 'lengthy', 'often', 'florid', 'narrative', 'cohesive', 'movie', 'major', 'themes', 'source', 'material', 'Streisand', 'done', 'splendid', 'job', 'pulling', 'together']",The Prince of Tides VHS

With so many predicable twists in its Freudian laden tropes, little is left to the aware viewer's imagination.Nolte is a Southern divorcee and gentleman to be, running away from a cramped married life made even more miserable by a hidden family past involving a rape and murder, and a sister who mentally did not manage to survive it all. Streisand, using all of her Jewish New York savvy, business charm and a tool kit full of Freudian 101 psychoanalytic techniques, plus a predictable bad marriage, manages to both seduce and cure her handsome troubled Southern client. And in the process he is able to help his sister return her life to a semblance of sanity and normalcy.Although the acting is much better than the script, which is thin, with a plot packed full of painfully predictable mini-Freudian psychodramas, it is nevertheless and interesting movie.

Yet, while the book was a spellbinding page-turner, I found myself squirming through much of the film, especially once Barbra Streisand's nails began taking on a life of their own.  The character she portrays is quite secondary in the book, yet here is a central focus, as could be expected.  That said, Nick Nolte is fantastic in a role that earned an Oscar Nomination, and the supporting cast is uniformly fine throughout.  Also, as a director, Striesand does capture some moments of pure blissful perfection that made this an Oscar worthy best film nominee in 1991.  But, there are crucial elements of prose missing from the plot, and I found myself confused by unncessary devices like therapy sessions that showcase la Streisand in place of the story that needed to be told.  Martin SCorcese would have OWNED this film had he directed it.  Streisand, on the other hand, manages to inspire and cajole, but ultimately falls flat when trying to make sense of the characters.  To be sure, she is one of the few Legends when it comes to filmmaking and acting, but &quot;The Price Of Tides&quot; pales by comparison to other noteworthy efforts like &quot;Yentl.&quot;  See it for Nolte, and then take the book to bed for an incomparable read!",3,"Some Terrific Moments from Nolte, but Babs Bombs",1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,1329,"['may', 'be', 'bit', 'cynical', 'film', 'version', 'book', 'so', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'book', 'was', 'spellbinding', 'page-turner', 'found', 'squirming', 'much', 'film', 'especially', 'once', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'nails', 'began', 'taking', 'life', 'own', 'character', 'quite', 'secondary', 'book', 'yet', 'here', 'central', 'focus', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'said', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'fantastic', 'role', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'supporting', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'fine', 'Also', 'director', 'Striesand', 'capture', 'moments', 'pure', 'blissful', 'perfection', 'made', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'best', 'film', 'nominee', '1991', 'are', 'crucial', 'elements', 'prose', 'missing', 'plot', 'found', 'confused', 'unncessary', 'devices', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'showcase', 'la', 'Streisand', 'place', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'told', 'Martin', 'SCorcese', 'would', 'have', 'OWNED', 'film', 'had', 'directed', 'Streisand', 'other', 'hand', 'inspire', 'cajole', 'ultimately', 'flat', 'when', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'characters', 'be', 'sure', 'one', 'few', 'Legends', 'when', 'filmmaking', 'acting', 'quot', 'Price', 'Tides', 'quot', 'pales', 'comparison', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'efforts', 'quot', 'Yentl.', 'quot', 'See', 'Nolte', 'then', 'take', 'book', 'bed', 'incomparable', 'read']",The Prince of Tides VHS

Pat Conroy, the books author is a genius in his telling of the southern tale of Tom Wingo, and his New York City romance  with psychiatrist Susan Lowenstien.  Nick Nolte is by far, the best actor  to come out of Hollywood in decades.  This man could have played Rhett  Butler.  Maybe it's because of my love for my native South Carolina, and  the romance I see in New York City, that attracts me to this movie, which I  have watched close to a dozen times.Barbra Striesand is excellant as  Susan Lowenstien, and her son (by Elliot Gould), who plays Bernard does a  great job as well.I enjoy just about every aspect of this film, the  intro, the flashbacks, the south in the summer, all of it!  Though the  South Carolina scenes were filmed in the coastal town of Beaufort,  according to Conroy's book Tom &amp; Sally actually reside on Sullivan's  Island, just outside of Charleston.  This area is the most gracious and  beautiful on the planet.  Maybe it's because I come from South Carolina.Favorite Scene:  The Shrimp Boat shown after Tom and his children go  shrimping with Tom's father, Henry.Note:  The movie could sure have  bettered itself by cutting down on the overuse of language, in my opinion.GOD BLESS !Kris Butts",5,Greatest Movie Of All Time,950313600,"02 12, 2000",2000,1325,"['one', 'word', '..superb', 'doubt', 'greatest', 'motion', 'picture', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Pat', 'Conroy', 'books', 'author', 'genius', 'telling', 'southern', 'tale', 'Tom', 'Wingo', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'romance', 'psychiatrist', 'Susan', 'Lowenstien', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'far', 'best', 'actor', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'decades', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'Maybe', 'love', 'native', 'South', 'Carolina', 'romance', 'see', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'close', 'dozen', 'times.Barbra', 'Striesand', 'excellant', 'Susan', 'Lowenstien', 'son', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'who', 'Bernard', 'great', 'job', 'well.I', 'enjoy', 'just', 'aspect', 'film', 'intro', 'flashbacks', 'south', 'summer', 'South', 'Carolina', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'coastal', 'town', 'Beaufort', 'according', 'Conroy', 'book', 'Tom', 'amp', 'Sally', 'actually', 'reside', 'Sullivan', 'Island', 'just', 'Charleston', 'area', 'most', 'gracious', 'beautiful', 'planet', 'come', 'South', 'Carolina.Favorite', 'Scene', 'Shrimp', 'Boat', 'shown', 'Tom', 'children', 'go', 'shrimping', 'Tom', 'father', 'Henry.Note', 'movie', 'could', 'sure', 'have', 'bettered', 'cutting', 'down', 'overuse', 'language', 'opinion.GOD', 'BLESS', 'Kris', 'Butts']",The Prince of Tides VHS

I now realize that every negative review I read has one or both of the following in common: The reviewer hates Barbra Streisand, or the reviewer thinks that, if the movie doesn't follow the book exactly, the movie is bad. Occasionally, someone will mention something else, such as a dislike of Nick Nolte or of George Carlin, but most of the negative reviews are based in those first two biases.Fortunately, I admire Ms. Streisand, and I understand that a movie must, by its very nature, differ from the book it is based on. In some cases (High Fidelity, for example--wonderful movie, terrible book), the movie is better.In this case, the author of The Prince of Tides co-wrote the script, so he had every opportunity to make sure that the story he was telling was true to his book, even if it wasn't a blow-by-blow exact replica.I am so glad I saw this movie. I feel as though my life is enriched because of it. From the opening moments, I knew I was in very capable hands. The acting, directing, photography, dialog--everything in this movie is among the best there is. There is not one false step in this movie.A lot is said in finely nuanced facial expressions and through body language--the kind of acting that is a notch above ordinary fare. Some of the topics dealt with are quite intense, and yet somehow Barbra Streisand as a director manages to handle them deftly, neither overdramatizing them nor underplaying their significance.

This is a love story with plenty of treakle but more than an ounce of vinegar as Tom and Lowenstein hit things off, become lovers, but ultimately part company forever to resolve their differences with their respective spouses.Columbia Tristar has given us a truly awful looking print of this film.  Colors are muddy and undistinguished.  Everything takes on an orange characteristic that is unbecoming to the story.  Night scenes suffer from low contrast levels.  Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement are all present throughout the print.  Fine grain elements and regular wear and tear have not been cleaned up for this presentation either.  Flesh tones are inaccurately rendered, either too orange or too pink.  There's a considerable loss of fine detail throughout, presumably because of noise reduction equipment used in mastering the print.  The soundtrack is dated, strident, unnatural sounding and very tinny.  It's 2.0 but almost sounding mono in spots while presenting the music at very boisterous listening levels that intrude on an otherwise very subdued audio presentation.  No extras - big surprise.  Columbia's penny pinching started with this release.  You can see where it's lead to by examining my reviews of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; or &quot;Talk of the Town&quot;.

This film is in my opinion the best film of Streisand's for any man to watch. It has managed to discuss something that most men have a hard time discussing; Their emotions!!I played this for my father, who is forty-six, and it is his favorite film. Anyone who is beyond sterotypes and can respect the story, and the man's situation, and not afraid of a little love and emotion, should love this film.This is Nick Nolte's best film, and he has not done anything after this that even comes close.

20586,A2HRVVDJMY5M4Z,0767835069,R. Graff,"[2, 2]","Barbra Streisand's second film as a director is also her most successful, most well-liked, and by far her most oscar-nominated.  It isn't hard to see why, as the film tackles the near-universal topic of dysfunctional family life, and how it ends up effecting other families as time goes on.At the same time, this film has many controversies and flaws to it.  Many fans of the novel condemn Streisand for totally changing the story around, and attempting to make the movie more about her character, Susan, when originally her role was not quite as central.  It is also (agreeably) criticized for implying that revealing a secret repressed with just magically make everything better.As far as flaws go, most of them come in the form of bad casting and unrealistic performances.  The biggest miscast was Barbra's son, Jason Gould, as her son, wannabe football player Bernard.  He comes across far too dorky and does not have the proper body to be completely believable as a football player.  The other major problem is Barbra Streisand's performance as a psychiatrist.  It has to be said that the way she acts is extremely unprofessional behavior for a psychiatrist.  Real psychiatrists don't get confrontational, talk to their patients like they are stupid, yell at their patients, and certainly do not become friends with/date their patients.  But you could argue that that is just something you need to suspend disbelief on.Those flaws mentioned and ranted about, there are plenty of strong aspects to the movie.  For one, the photography is just stunning, with some stunning scenery, sunsets, and even Barbra Streisand herself, looking very lovely, and difficult to take your eyes off of.  Another strong point, perhaps what saves this production, are the fantastic performances.  Nick Nolte, Kate Nelligan, and Blythe Danner especially give truly raw performances as complex, emotional, and not always likeable people.  But nobody, not even Streisand and her son, gives a terrible performance.  Finally, the storyline is very involving and heartbreaking, and even the romance between Nolte and Streisand, while a little more prevalent than it should be, is very touching.Though nominated for many Academy Awards, it isn't hard to see why it won zero.  When watched today, it has the feeling of a Lifetime tv-movie, and I'm sure the Academy felt that what could have been a raw, educational look at psychiatry and coming to terms with your past was made into not much more than a soap opera.  But still, this is a very engrossing film that, love it or hate it, will stick with you.

20587,A1O0YOPMJ4QP8U,0767835069,R. Hamilton,"[2, 2]","I remember seeing this movie on the big screen shortly after its Christmas 1991 release and being instantly captivated by every scene.  The Prince of Tides was so well done that it held my full attention throughout all 2+ hours.  As a viewer I experienced a vast array of emotions such as compassion, inspiration, sadness, shock, and wonder.I liked everything about this movie.  First and foremost, the acting was superb.  Nick Nolte deservedly won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama.  (He should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor as well IMO.)  Nolte's portrayal of the very complex yet down-to-earth and likeable Tom Wingo was nothing short of magnificent.  Don't be surprised if you shed a tear or two after the last flashback scene, when Tom's defenses finally crumble as he lets himself experience the childhood pain he had kept locked up for so long.  Barbra Streisand also delivered a wonderful performance as devoted psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lowenstein.  Strong and self-assured, she has no problem standing up for herself when confronted by Tom's tantrums; sad and vulnerable, she allows the layers of her own insecurities to peel away as she falls in love with him.Other noteworthy performances include those of Kate Nelligan, Blythe Danner and George Carlin.  Oscar-nominated Kate Nelligan brilliantly portrays Lila Wingo Newbury, the high-strung and status-hungry mother of Nolte's character.  Nelligan is stunning as a young mother in the flashback scenes and looks convincingly older in the present setting (kudos, makeup and wardrobe crew).  Blythe Danner was perfect as Tom's frustrated wife Sallie, a character deserving of compassion in her own right.  Comedian George Carlin plays Eddie, the gay and caring neighbor of Tom's suicidal twin sister Savannah.  Carlin is commended for conveying his character's sexuality with a bit more subtlety than flamboyance and for playing his dramatic scenes as wonderfully as his comedic ones.In addition to the superb performances, The Prince of Tides contains one of the most memorable scores in a motion picture.  James Newton Howard's background music in a number of scenes creates just the right touch.  Its careful, creative blend of instrumentals enhances the film's various moods - awe, heartache, romance, etc.  (I highly recommend purchasing the soundtrack, which also features Ms. Streisand's heartwarming single ""Places that Belong to You,"" not included in the movie itself.)  The cinematography in this film is simply incredible.  Wondrous scenery of lakes, rivers and marshes, as well as sunrises and sunsets, will take your breath away.  Indeed, producer/director Barbra Streisand is to be praised for all the work she did behind the camera as well as in front of it.It is a pity that this DVD contains no documentaries surrounding this Oscar-nominated movie, but the movie itself more than makes up for the absence.  The Prince of Tides is a pure joy to watch, an emotional experience like no other.  For viewers who were raised in a dysfunctional family, the film is particularly meaningful:  it will inspire you to let go of past hurt, learn from it, grow stronger, and set yourself free to love yourself and live a happier life.",5,One of the greatest dramatic films ever,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,3235,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'shortly', 'Christmas', '1991', 'release', 'being', 'instantly', 'captivated', 'scene', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'held', 'full', 'attention', '2+', 'hours', 'viewer', 'experienced', 'vast', 'array', 'emotions', 'such', 'compassion', 'inspiration', 'sadness', 'shock', 'wonder.I', 'liked', 'everything', 'movie', 'First', 'foremost', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Drama', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'well', 'IMO', 'Nolte', 'portrayal', 'very', 'complex', 'yet', 'down-to-earth', 'likeable', 'Tom', 'Wingo', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'magnificent', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'shed', 'tear', 'two', 'last', 'flashback', 'scene', 'when', 'Tom', 'defenses', 'finally', 'crumble', 'experience', 'childhood', 'pain', 'had', 'kept', 'locked', 'up', 'so', 'long', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'also', 'delivered', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'devoted', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Lowenstein', 'Strong', 'self-assured', 'problem', 'standing', 'up', 'herself', 'when', 'confronted', 'Tom', 'tantrums', 'sad', 'vulnerable', 'layers', 'own', 'insecurities', 'peel', 'away', 'love', 'him.Other', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'include', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'brilliantly', 'Lila', 'Wingo', 'Newbury', 'high-strung', 'status-hungry', 'mother', 'Nolte', 'character', 'Nelligan', 'stunning', 'young', 'mother', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'convincingly', 'older', 'present', 'setting', 'kudos', 'makeup', 'wardrobe', 'crew', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'was', 'perfect', 'Tom', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'Sallie', 'character', 'deserving', 'compassion', 'own', 'right', 'Comedian', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Eddie', 'gay', 'caring', 'neighbor', 'Tom', 'suicidal', 'twin', 'sister', 'Savannah', 'Carlin', 'commended', 'conveying', 'character', 'sexuality', 'bit', 'more', 'subtlety', 'flamboyance', 'playing', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'as', 'wonderfully', 'comedic', 'ones.In', 'addition', 'superb', 'performances', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'scores', 'motion', 'picture', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'background', 'music', 'number', 'scenes', 'creates', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'careful', 'creative', 'blend', 'instrumentals', 'film', 'various', 'moods', 'awe', 'heartache', 'romance', 'etc', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'Ms.', 'Streisand', 'heartwarming', 'single', 'Places', 'Belong', 'not', 'included', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'film', 'simply', 'incredible', 'Wondrous', 'scenery', 'lakes', 'rivers', 'marshes', 'as', 'well', 'sunrises', 'sunsets', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'Indeed', 'producer/director', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'be', 'praised', 'work', 'did', 'behind', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'front', 'it.It', 'pity', 'DVD', 'documentaries', 'surrounding', 'Oscar-nominated', 'movie', 'movie', 'more', 'up', 'absence', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch', 'emotional', 'experience', 'other', 'viewers', 'who', 'were', 'raised', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'film', 'particularly', 'meaningful', 'will', 'inspire', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'hurt', 'learn', 'grow', 'stronger', 'set', 'free', 'love', 'live', 'happier', 'life']",The Prince of Tides VHS

20595,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,0767835069,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","""The Prince of Tides"" was based on the Pat Conroy novel of the same name from 1986. Directed superbly by Barbra Streisand, the film aslo stars Barbra as a psychiatrist who helps a man come to terms with his tormented past. It is through Susan, the Streisand character, that Tom (played by Nick Nolte) faces his abusive childhood from both his mother and father. He also comes face to face with a secret that has been haunting him his whole life. The movie explores the emotional issues we all face with in life when we don't put our past behind us and when those problems are not dealt with in a professional setting. ""The Prince of Tides"" is one of the best films I have ever witnessed. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, ""The Prince of Tides"" lost in every category in 1991 as that was the year ""The Silence of The Lambs"" swept the Oscars. Barbra was also ignored by the Academy for Best Director, an omission I have never forgiven the Oscars for. How could a film win seven Oscar nods and overlook its director? Nevertheless, ""The Prince of Tides"" is a superb film you will enjoy over and over.
