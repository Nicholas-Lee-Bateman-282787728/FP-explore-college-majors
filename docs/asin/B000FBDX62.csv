I feel that no good comes from caracter assanation by people who were not present and get all their information second hand.The second movie was a real winner.  While it lacked realism in many places it was clean, interesting, well acted, and the actors fit their parts very well.  Its a shame to pair it up with the first mvie.",5,"Two thumbs down, two thumbs up.",1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,360,"['first', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'feel', 'good', 'caracter', 'assanation', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'present', 'get', 'information', 'hand.The', 'second', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'winner', 'lacked', 'realism', 'many', 'places', 'was', 'clean', 'interesting', 'well', 'acted', 'actors', 'fit', 'parts', 'very', 'well', 'shame', 'pair', 'up', 'first', 'mvie']",Doc & Stagecoach
