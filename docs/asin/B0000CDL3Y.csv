It's not a comedy, it's not a WWII drama, it's an off-beat quirky study of human nature that doesn't have a standard Hollywood central theme, character arcs, or overcoming-adversity motif.  It's a silly sort of film, but contains lots of small moments that are poignant, interesting, and definitely Euro-centric.If you enjoy movies ""just because"" but you can manage to live without standard Hollywood cliches, then this is a diverting couple of hours.",4,Not a great movie but enjoyable and more than it seems at first,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,557,"['difficult', 'imagine', 'how', 'earth', 'anyone', 'raised', 'money', 'get', 'movie', 'made', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'comedy', 'not', 'WWII', 'drama', 'off-beat', 'quirky', 'study', 'human', 'nature', ""n't"", 'have', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'central', 'theme', 'character', 'arcs', 'overcoming-adversity', 'motif', 'silly', 'sort', 'film', 'lots', 'small', 'moments', 'are', 'poignant', 'interesting', 'definitely', 'Euro-centric.If', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'just', 'can', 'manage', 'live', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'then', 'diverting', 'couple', 'hours']",All The Queen's Men

I'm sure some people will watch the film just to see Matt LeBlanc in drag.  Hey, it is what it is!If you go into this movie seeking precise historical accuracy you will be dissapointed.  It is a cute World War II story, and shows how people relate under dire circumstances, particularly in the scene where they flee for the bomb shelters.

775519,A16F2K8VG7GDS9,B0000CDL3Y,"Daniel Friedman ""dfja17""","[20, 21]","All The Queen's Men isn't a bad movie but it isn't a very good one either.  It's kind of like an extended sitcom that picks up nicely at the end and in so doing redeems itself a little bit. It's a fairly simple story about a team of spies who go undercover as women in Nazi Germany to steal a codebreaking device.  Obviously most of the humor comes from the cross-dressing concept but it actually does provide somewhat of a clever action plot once the plan gets under way.Eddie Izzard is great as always in a role that seems to be tailor-made for him.  Matt LeBlanc is funny but it's hard to believe that anyone would ever be convinced that he's a woman.  And not for nothing, but how can this man be a spy inside Germany when he doesn't speak German?What's frustrating and ultimately detracting from the film is that there are numerous opportunities for sub-plots and themes that would add enormously to the story but they are not used to full advantage, except for the one involving Izzard's character's German male lover.  There are some isolated moments of cleverness involving the mission, typical of what you would see in a well-crafted action film.There are a handful of laugh-out-loud moments but don't set your expectations too high.",3,Umm...okay,1085616000,"05 27, 2004",2004,1242,"['Queen', 'Men', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'one', 'either', 'kind', 'extended', 'sitcom', 'up', 'nicely', 'end', 'so', 'doing', 'redeems', 'little', 'bit', 'fairly', 'simple', 'story', 'team', 'spies', 'who', 'go', 'undercover', 'as', 'women', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'steal', 'codebreaking', 'device', 'Obviously', 'most', 'humor', 'cross-dressing', 'concept', 'actually', 'provide', 'somewhat', 'clever', 'action', 'plot', 'plan', 'way.Eddie', 'Izzard', 'great', 'always', 'role', 'be', 'tailor-made', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'funny', 'hard', 'believe', 'anyone', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'convinced', 'woman', 'not', 'nothing', 'how', 'can', 'man', 'be', 'spy', 'inside', 'Germany', 'when', ""n't"", 'speak', 'German', 'What', 'frustrating', 'ultimately', 'detracting', 'film', 'are', 'numerous', 'opportunities', 'sub-plots', 'themes', 'would', 'add', 'enormously', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'full', 'advantage', 'one', 'involving', 'Izzard', 'character', 'German', 'male', 'lover', 'are', 'isolated', 'moments', 'cleverness', 'involving', 'mission', 'typical', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'well-crafted', 'action', 'are', 'handful', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high']",All The Queen's Men

With excellent direction from Stefan Ruzowitzky and a strong ensemble of actors this film about the Brits sending a team of men to capture the Enigma machine from a Nazi factory that only employs women in Berlin (hence the need to be in drag) succeeds with grace and warmth and tenderness -  and humor.  Eddie Izzard is hilarious as a cross-dressing entertainer who is assigned the duty of transforming a team of macho guys into credible women (which he succeeds in doing!).  The team is ably led by Matt LeBlanc and includes David Birkin and James Cosmo, each with their own personal stories that make the story more believable.  Their 'contact' is the German spy Nicolette Krebitz and with her help and a lot of surprises the mission is 'accomplished'.  Yes, this is a comedy with many good belly laughs, but it also is a tender rendering of how men and women (and children) relate under the stresses of war.  The cinematography is first class without blowing the story out of real proportion.

Bailey ""doula gal""","[0, 0]","In this World War II comedy, several British men led by Matt LeBlanc's character, O'Rourke, go behind German lines to steal an Enigma machine. Because the factories in Germany are being worked solely by women, they must all go in drag. Eddie Izzard's character, Tony Parker, is a dream. If you enjoy Eddie Izzard's comedy, you will enjoy this sweet, unpretentious movie.Matt LeBlanc gets the straight-man role, literally. He has to shepherd this unlikely group consisting of an unsuccessful spy (LeBlanc), a pencil-pushing temporary major (James Cosmo), Izzard's primadona drag queen and a code-breaking genius (David Birkin) into Germany to pass as women factory workers. You might remember David Birkin from Star Trek: The Next Generation. He played Picard as an adolescent in the episode ""Rascals"".For me, the fun comes from remembering Eddie Izzard's description from his stand-up routines, of how if only we would use them, men in drag could throw off the enemy's concentration when parachuting down to war. Izzard describes it, and then he gets to do it! Big fun! I imagine that Izzard enjoyed making this movie. He gets to sing, wear fun costumes and speak in several languages, including German.

775527,A1MZNOE1OABAQK,B0000CDL3Y,thecableguy,"[1, 2]","I'd finished watching ""Flags of our Fathers,"" which was a good film, but ultimately depressing, like spending two hours on grandpa's lap listening to blood-and-guts war stories.  After that, I needed a funny film about war to balance me out, something like ""The Americanization of Emily"" or at least a collection of ""Hogan's Heroes"" episodes.  The video store didn't have either of those, but they did have ""All the Queen's Men.""  Matt LeBlanc was kind of funny on ""Friends"" I thought, maybe LeBlanc is funny in a dress.There should be a rule for actors: DON'T sign up to do a movie in drag if you don't want people to laugh at you for wearing a dress.  Throughout the feature, LeBlanc looks as if he's going to punch out anyone who doubts his masculinity.  Maybe LeBlanc wasn't fully informed the kind of movie he was signing up for.  Or maybe the filmmakers changed their mind on the film's tone halfway through production.  Whatever the problem is, no one here looks like they're having any fun, which is a shame because most other elements of the production -- cinematography, set design, special effects, etc -- are top quality.There are sophomoric, so-bad-they're-good cross-dressing comedies like ""Sorority Boys"" and ""Just One of the Guys,"" there are classics like ""Some Like it Hot"" and ""Tootsie,"" and on the more serious end of the spectrum you have films like ""Yentl"" and ""Boys Don't Cry.""
