Although some of this movie is obviously special effects, it does give a good idea of the power of a large avalanche.  The main reason to watch this movie, especially for children or teens who ski, is not to frighten them, but to give them time to think of what they could or should do if they find themselves in an avalanche.  The is also about a seventeen year old girl who is trapped with her stepmother in the rubble.  Because it is a TV movie, some of the plot line are a bit trite, but the movie does keep your interest, and there is no bad language at all.",3,What if it happened to you - would you know how to react?,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,771,"['When', 'lived', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'one', 'mile', 'Continental', 'Divide', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'far', 'drive', 'see', 'huge', 'cuts', 'trees', 'mountains', 'where', 'avalanche', 'had', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'mountains', 'movie', 'obviously', 'special', 'effects', 'give', 'good', 'idea', 'power', 'large', 'avalanche', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'especially', 'children', 'teens', 'who', 'ski', 'not', 'frighten', 'give', 'time', 'think', 'what', 'could', 'should', 'do', 'find', 'avalanche', 'also', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'trapped', 'stepmother', 'rubble', 'TV', 'movie', 'plot', 'line', 'are', 'bit', 'trite', 'movie', 'keep', 'interest', 'bad', 'language']",Trapped: Buried Alive
