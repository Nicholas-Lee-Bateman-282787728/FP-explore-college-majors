Their lives are unraveling, and only they can make the choice as to what to do next and if it is the best thing to do.I thought the first two stories were extremely depressing.  I honestly didn't know the tone to the entire movie. I tend to not want to know a lot about a movie I am going to watch because what would be the point to watching them?  It's like looking into someone else's life watching these stories.My thoughts are this -- Kyra Sedwick's &quot;Delia&quot; is a blue jean wearing chick who has a past of being promiscuous and a present she wants to escape.Parker Posey is &quot;Greta&quot;, the woman bent on success and high on infidelity.  Some of her thoughts were laugh out loud funny.Fairuza Balk is &quot;Paula&quot;, young, pregnant, and freaked out by an accident that she sees happen to a man she has just met.  She runs away and picks up a young mysterious hitchhiker  This is the best story because it ends on an unbeat note.The writing was good, and I liked the style of filmmaking Rebecca Miller has incorporated with her stories.It still left me with a bitter taste.

As an abused woman who finally had enough abuse, she decides to leave and take the lessons she learned in dealing with her abusive life to move forward, and she is excellent as much as she is convincing.Parker Posey plays an editor who is given a plum opportunity, which in the end will alienate her from her husband and most of the middle-class trappings she has come to detest in her own life (she has chosen this path in life it seems to combat her feelings against her family).

""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","I don't know why there are so many attempts at this sort of films: individual episodes that approach and overlap the same concept. Perhaps it is because it is easier to craft episodes with power rather than worry about an arc of 90 minutes or more.But we do have them and some work amazingly well. This movie is the story of three woman, told in separate segments. Each of the characters has to some extent engaged in self-delusion as to who they really are as persons and each one finds herself in the midst of a major life crisis. As each character deals with their situation, they begin to find out who they really are as persons and to find a possible path to self liberation, happiness and fulfillment in their lives. Delia (Kyra Sedgwick) is an abused wife and mother, who finds personal liberation by finding the courage to finally leave her abusive husband, and then finds her personal dignity and power by rediscovering her sexuality. Greta (Parker Posey), is a wife and daughter, who has long suffered, first by being caught in the middle in a struggle between her powerful, ambitious father and her weaker, more fragile mother for her love and affection, then later in an act of rebellion against her father, ends up in a loving but passionless marriage in which she has suppressed all her own personal ambitions. An opportunity for success rekindles in her all her own passions and ambition, as she struggles to finally break free from the influence of her parents, to come to terms with her husband and marriage and to be who she really is as a person. Paula (Fairuza Balk) is a young woman, who finds herself pregnant and who after a terrible accident, in a state of shock starts out on a journey to try and escape and make sense of what is happening to her. An encounter with an abused runaway helps her refocus on her own plight and discover her own ability to care about others besides her self.All the acting in the film is excellent, but Parker Posey as Greta really stands out. This is the first film that makes use of Parker's ability as an actress to convey emotion and internal conflict, without dialog, simply by the expression on her beautiful face, and it is absolutely stunning to watch. She turns Greta, who could have been very unsympathetic, into a character that one can care about. This is very intelligent and very complex film. One that makes the viewer think deeply. There are no tight, neatly wrapped up endings in this movie, you have no way of knowing if the characters have made the right choices in their lives. This makes it tough for audiences and critics to embrace this movie, but if you do look deeply at it, and think about it, you will come to appreciate and love it.",4,I've found me another wonderful segmented film.,1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,2714,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'attempts', 'sort', 'films', 'individual', 'episodes', 'approach', 'overlap', 'same', 'concept', 'Perhaps', 'easier', 'craft', 'episodes', 'power', 'rather', 'worry', 'arc', '90', 'minutes', 'more.But', 'do', 'have', 'work', 'amazingly', 'well', 'movie', 'story', 'three', 'woman', 'told', 'separate', 'segments', 'characters', 'extent', 'engaged', 'self-delusion', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'persons', 'one', 'midst', 'major', 'life', 'crisis', 'character', 'deals', 'situation', 'begin', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'persons', 'find', 'possible', 'path', 'self', 'liberation', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'lives', 'Delia', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'abused', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'personal', 'liberation', 'finding', 'courage', 'finally', 'leave', 'abusive', 'husband', 'then', 'personal', 'dignity', 'power', 'rediscovering', 'sexuality', 'Greta', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'wife', 'daughter', 'who', 'long', 'suffered', 'first', 'being', 'caught', 'middle', 'struggle', 'powerful', 'ambitious', 'father', 'weaker', 'more', 'fragile', 'mother', 'love', 'affection', 'then', 'later', 'act', 'rebellion', 'father', 'up', 'loving', 'passionless', 'marriage', 'suppressed', 'own', 'personal', 'ambitions', 'opportunity', 'success', 'rekindles', 'own', 'passions', 'ambition', 'finally', 'break', 'free', 'influence', 'parents', 'come', 'terms', 'husband', 'marriage', 'be', 'who', 'really', 'person', 'Paula', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'pregnant', 'who', 'terrible', 'accident', 'state', 'shock', 'out', 'journey', 'try', 'escape', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'happening', 'encounter', 'abused', 'runaway', 'refocus', 'own', 'plight', 'discover', 'own', 'ability', 'care', 'others', 'self.All', 'acting', 'film', 'excellent', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Greta', 'really', 'out', 'first', 'film', 'use', 'Parker', 'ability', 'actress', 'convey', 'emotion', 'internal', 'conflict', 'dialog', 'simply', 'expression', 'beautiful', 'face', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'watch', 'Greta', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'one', 'can', 'care', 'about', 'very', 'intelligent', 'very', 'complex', 'film', 'One', 'viewer', 'think', 'deeply', 'are', 'tight', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'endings', 'movie', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'characters', 'have', 'made', 'right', 'choices', 'lives', 'tough', 'audiences', 'critics', 'embrace', 'movie', 'do', 'look', 'deeply', 'think', 'will', 'come', 'appreciate', 'love']",N/A

But when you start getting into Posey's and Balk's acting style, you really get into the film and start rooting for these characters, whatever their goals may be.  The digital film medium enhances this film a lot, with wonderful close-ups and POV shots.  I barely even noticed the movement of the hand-held camera, which is the mark of true precision.

Greta (Parker Posey) is mourning the death of her mother as she has settled down due to her parents divorce that is the origin for her hate for infidelity.

The question is whether she can take steps to remove the ties that hold her down.  Paula (Fairuza Balk) has recently witnessed a traumatic death and found out that she is pregnant with a child.  Confused, she begins to drive home to see her mother as she is desperate for some guidance or a sign.  On the way she sees a hitch hiker, a teenager, that she interprets as a sign so she picks him up.  The three women are reaching their life decisions at different velocities in their lives.

735610,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00008972Q,Lleu Christopher,"[4, 5]","Personal Velocity, written and directed by Rebecca Miller (and based on her book) tells three stories of women at crossroads in their lives. A film that is divided into separate stories must overcome certain challenges. Short stories, if they are good, can still leave the reader a little unsatisfied.  This may be even more true of short films, as even a two hour movie tends to have less depth than a book. It is also common for stories to be of unequal quality.  Personal Velocity, however, succeeds in creating three engaging half hours with some powerful performances. I found all three equally entertaining. The first character we meet is Delia (Kyra Sedgwick), a woman fleeing from an abusive husband with her three young children. While this is a familiar, movie-of-the-week situation, Sedgwick is completely believable as the hurt, angry and uncertain Delia as she attempts to make a new start. Parker Posey, a distinguished veteran of many independent films is the star of the second tale. She is Greta, an editor who unexpectedly finds success working with a famous novelist (who makes a pass at her). Greta is married to a man who is nice, intelligent but lacking in ambition and she finds herself wondering if he will fit in with her new future. There is a great contrast between the first two episodes. The first is set in the rural working class of upstate New York, the second among Manhattan's literary chic. The third tale changes pace once again. Paula (Fairuza Balk) is a woman who has just been traumatized by a tragic accident. Driving aimlessly, she picks up a young hitchhiker who turns out to be another victim of a violent event. Paula drives with the boy to her mother's house, which does not turn out to be much of a refuge.

Each portrait is beautifully portrayed, each woman struggling with her own story, ghosts and baggage, fears and hopes, searching for a sense of her own power, all the while looking for something better... What will it take to seize the moment fearlessly?Delia's story was heartbreaking: her roots, her history.  Gripping fear keeps her from utilizing those chances to be vulnerable (since vulnerability has failed her in the past),to break free and to choose those people who can truly help her. She chooses, instead, her old survival tools--a tough exterior, self-sufficiency, and sexual power--which, in the end, is what she knows best.Watching Greta was disconcerting...I am still not sure if she is a woman moving towards her own truth (ambition and power) or away from it (family and the beautiful husband). Still, attempting to figure her out, and coming up with a different answer each time, reminds me to be non-judgmental and allow everyone his or her own path.Paula comes full circle: a runaway once herself, befriended and ""adopted"" by the gentle Haitian, she has one foot out the door when she learns she is pregnant. A near death experience and she bolts, she picks up a boy, also running and covered with visible cuts and bruises that mirror her own inner ones. She responds with such tenderness and vulnerability and  forgives the boy for stealing her car...she has been transformed somehow by the experience, enough to feel the stirrings of life within her and taste joy.  Which home will she choose?Life is filled with opportunities to do things differently.  My life has shown me that rigid formulas don't work in the long run.

And Sedgwick as Delia, usually one to elicit sympathy, comes off as a pathetic slattern, undeserving of anything much more than pity. Balk as Paula rounds out this ungodly trio as a young woman bent on destruction who mostly succeeds.I know that all of this is meant to be ""real"" and serve as a comment on Contemporary Woman but give me a break. We've all got it bad at some point in our lives but we also have it good a lot of the times.

It is admirable that the movie doesn't give the answers, just gives the human beings.  Of the three I found the last story -- Paula and the hitchhiker, to be the most moving, and redeeming.  The connection between Paula and the wounded character played by Lou Taylor Pucci is palable and heartbreaking -- conveyed by their eyes.  It is about feeling for another person -- and in the feeling Paula expresses (now emerging from her state of shock) she identifies with the hurt she sees in the boy.  She sees how vulnerable he is -- notices he is just like a little boy, just a baby -- and had been hurt, tortured really -- then she wants to take him home and protect him.  The boy can't trust that, however.

735615,A12FLZREV32JOP,B00008972Q,Noelle Eiram,"[3, 4]","'Personal Velocity: Three Portraits' is a touching and beautiful film that manages to remain unsentimental. The three heroines are complex and believable, as are all characters in the film, though most others are given only a surface glance. The acting is so well done, though, that even minor characters almost betray their backrounds with no words.Kyra Sedgwick plays Delia, a hard woman with a beautiful rear and a realistic attitude. Delia's story is a strong opening tale. Each story gives a brief boigraphy of its protagonist, and Delia's backstory is lightheartedly told. However, her past, and certainly her present, are heavy, and viewers see that her independence as a girl saves her in her adulthood. Sedgwick is viscerally real.Parker Posey is Greta. Greta's episode works well as a middle installment. It is not as dramatic as Delia's, but it is, in some ways, more depressing. Greta is a cookbook editor whose main antagonist is herself. She is intelligent, financially comfortable, and ambitious. Greta realizes that the lattermost quality, along with her tendency to stray from her devout spouse, must be met and dealt with. Posey is an understated and sympathetic Greta.The final episode features Fairuza Balk as a young, troubled woman with a compassionate heart. This is in some ways the strongest story, but I think that it is simply a solid conclusion. Paula (Balk) finds herself wandering in her car after witnessing a devastating car accident, the only aspect that connects the three portraits. Paula's story is at the same time the most grim and the most upbeat. She ends up being the kindest of the three characters, perhaps only because of her experiences.Families are prominently featured in this movie. As stated above, every part is well acted, from Delia's high school friend to the detached hitchhiker that Paula picks up. An artistic device used beginning in the opening shots involves freezing the frame like a snapshot. In this film, it is affective, and is not a gimmick.The three portraits are subtly connected, and there is no blatant summation. I found many of the choices made, including using a male voiced narration instead of a female voice-over, interesting and appropriate.

735617,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00008972Q,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[2, 3]","As so many films are told from the perspective of a male protagonist, it's refreshing to see a movie in which men are the secondary characters and we get to watch a woman deal with an ongoing conflict that is the narrative focus from beginning to end. ""Personal Velocity"" is actually three short films, but the effect is the same. Each of the central characters faces a complication that overturns her world and requires her to find a new way of living her life. Each of them is strong, comes across as three-dimensional, and makes us care what happens to them. Interestingly, male characters play a role in their transformation, but in ways that make these women even more self-reliant and resolved.The opening story is a neatly crafted account of a working class woman who regains her independence after marriage to an abusive husband (the flashes of his violence are shocking and brutal). But it's not enough that she takes her children and escapes. She must regain her emotional independence as well, and she finds herself in a situation where she must free herself again; this time from the leeringly casual abuse of a younger man who enjoys taunting her with invitations to sex. When she is done with him, you see her finally achieve the personal power (velocity) she once had as a younger woman.The stories of the other two women are likewise well crafted, each taking a journey that has parallels with the first but explores different narrative terrain. One is a more comic tale of a young educated woman who through luck and circumstance becomes a ""late bloomer"" and suddenly outgrows her cute, devoted husband (a fact checker for the New Yorker), as well as a jerky, condescending former classmate and an overbearingly successful father. (It's his observation that she's achieved her own ""personal velocity,"" and coming from the mouth of an unsympathetic character, the title of the film takes on a certain irony.)The last story is (according to the director in her commentary) a quickly assembled piece that uses conventions of the road movie to tell the story of a young woman who ventures into what may become a romantic interlude with a young man who is suddenly killed by a passing car. The abrupt shift of the story sends her reeling, and she becomes involved with another male companion, a troubled and physically abused boy she picks up on the road. By the end of the story, her car stolen, she is able to find the direction she wants to take, and she sets off afoot, having discovered a self confidence that until now has eluded her.The three sections of the film are clearly dramatized short stories, an effect that is reinforced by a narrator's voice-overs. There are mixed opinions about the use of this device in film, but it works here as a distancing technique that reinforces these as stories and not just visual slices of life. In the middle story especially, but in all of them, it intensifies the ironies of what we're seeing. The news reports of the pedestrian fatality in the early stories ironically weave them together with the final story, in which that fatality occurs. We're reminded that, for all the differences among them, these characters inhabit the same universe, though they are strangers to each other.The digital filming and brisk editing give an edginess to the visuals. And the performances are fine. The commentaries on the DVD add a level of appreciation, as they often do for indie films made under severe constraints but with utter dedication. I recommend this film to anyone interested in movies about women's lives.

I don't expect to ""like"" every character in a film - GOODFELLAS, CLOCKWORK ORANGE, HUD, THE WILD BUNCH, USUAL SUSPECTS all feature characters that are VERY BAD PEOPLE but they're excellent movies - I at least have to find characters ""interesting,"" to ""care"" about 'em a bit for one reason 'r' another.  The central character in each story herein is pretty much a self-absorbed or foolish person ""stuck"" in a situation primarily of her own making, w/ the exception of Ms. Balk's.  Kyra S's character is nasty to people that try to help her and her possibly statutory sex act with a dopey teenage boy is supposed to be seen as EMPOWERING?!?  Balk's character's car gets STOLEN by a kid she's trying to help (yeah, REALLY smart, her leaving the keys in the car w/ someone she barely knows!) and instead of feeling (naturally) upset/angry/nonplussed (as most people would), just THEN she has an ""epiphany"" about her unborn child?!?

The camera shots (digital filming) are so close on the actors you feel somewhat suffocated and want to tell the cameraman &quot;move back a little&quot;. This sort of filming takes time getting used to and until the end of the movie you feel you are inside the flesh and sweat of these people. The movie does no effort to give you good shots of its actors. You see the three heroines in very &quot;ugly&quot; moments with their make up running, etc. You are on top of them and in a way this &quot;harsh&quot; filming adds to your intimacy with the characters and the total immersing in the stories.This is the story of three women, each one in a turning point in her life. I guess what the movie tries to show is this moment of revelation and understanding, where all pieces fall down in place. In fact, it sometimes reminded me of Raymond Carver harsh stories who deal with such brief moments in time. Here the story leads us to this personal discovery, after which nothing will be the same.The first story is the story of Delia, a woman who used to have a personal feeling of that was when she was young, but this feeling was severely shattered through the years. Now, through a hard process of independence she gains this power again. Delia needs to remember she used to have strength. This is not the strength and power of love. Sadly, love weakened Delia. But now, in this stage of her life she needs her own power in order to survive. Since the movie &quot;Phenomena&quot; I have a soft spot in my heart for Kyra Sedgwick who was able to move me once again.The second story is about Greta, a young ambitious editor. Greta has undergone a period where she rejected her father following his treatment of her mother. She used to be just like him when she was young but his actions caused her a sort of &quot;numbness period&quot; where she convinced herself that she could settle for a simple life with her loving, yet non ambitious husband. However, Greta' s true nature (&quot;unfaithful&quot; nature) comes out. She understands she is just like her father, full of ambitions and needs. This revelation causes her a lot of grief.The last story is about Paula who shifts roles during the movie. From being a runaway girl, who could not handle a terrible accident she was part of, she turns on all her mother emotions and is now willing to take the responsibilities in her life.The movie is absorbing and endearing. All characters are beautifully played and give you many hours of reflection and thoughts.",5,Endearing,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,2555,"['When', 'movie', 'feel', 'little', 'dizzy', 'camera', 'shots', 'digital', 'filming', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'actors', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'suffocated', 'want', 'tell', 'cameraman', 'quot', 'move', 'back', 'little', 'quot', 'sort', 'filming', 'time', 'getting', 'used', 'end', 'movie', 'feel', 'are', 'flesh', 'sweat', 'people', 'movie', 'effort', 'give', 'good', 'shots', 'actors', 'see', 'three', 'heroines', 'very', 'quot', 'ugly', 'quot', 'moments', 'make', 'up', 'running', 'etc', 'are', 'top', 'way', 'quot', 'quot', 'filming', 'intimacy', 'characters', 'total', 'immersing', 'stories.This', 'story', 'three', 'women', 'one', 'turning', 'point', 'life', 'guess', 'what', 'movie', 'show', 'moment', 'revelation', 'understanding', 'where', 'pieces', 'fall', 'down', 'place', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'reminded', 'Raymond', 'Carver', 'harsh', 'stories', 'who', 'deal', 'such', 'brief', 'moments', 'time', 'Here', 'story', 'personal', 'discovery', 'nothing', 'will', 'be', 'same.The', 'first', 'story', 'story', 'Delia', 'woman', 'who', 'used', 'have', 'personal', 'feeling', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'feeling', 'was', 'severely', 'shattered', 'years', 'Now', 'hard', 'process', 'independence', 'gains', 'power', 'again', 'Delia', 'remember', 'used', 'have', 'strength', 'not', 'strength', 'power', 'love', 'Sadly', 'love', 'weakened', 'Delia', 'now', 'stage', 'life', 'own', 'power', 'order', 'survive', 'movie', 'quot', 'Phenomena', 'quot', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'move', 'once', 'again.The', 'second', 'story', 'Greta', 'young', 'ambitious', 'editor', 'Greta', 'undergone', 'period', 'where', 'rejected', 'father', 'following', 'treatment', 'mother', 'used', 'be', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'actions', 'caused', 'sort', 'quot', 'period', 'quot', 'where', 'convinced', 'could', 'settle', 'simple', 'life', 'loving', 'yet', 'non', 'ambitious', 'husband', 'However', 'Greta', 's', 'true', 'nature', 'quot', 'unfaithful', 'quot', 'nature', 'out', 'just', 'father', 'full', 'ambitions', 'needs', 'revelation', 'lot', 'grief.The', 'last', 'story', 'Paula', 'who', 'shifts', 'roles', 'movie', 'being', 'runaway', 'girl', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'terrible', 'accident', 'was', 'part', 'mother', 'emotions', 'now', 'willing', 'take', 'responsibilities', 'life.The', 'movie', 'absorbing', 'endearing', 'characters', 'are', 'beautifully', 'played', 'give', 'many', 'hours', 'reflection', 'thoughts']",N/A
