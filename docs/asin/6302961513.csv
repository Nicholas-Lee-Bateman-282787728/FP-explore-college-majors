347386,A3TA10P5W5YOQ0,6302961513,David B. Jones,"[33, 35]","Hey, movie viewers!  If you liked the great 1983 movie, A Christmas Story, which was narrated by, and based on a novel by Jean Shepherd, you'll really like this hilarious 1988 comedy!It's about a teen named Ralph Parker and his family who live in Indiana in the late 40's or early 50's, who go on a vacation every year to a lake in Michigan, and stay at a resort by the lake called Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss, which consists of 6 log cabins.  Unfortunately, the family dog, Fuzzhead, has disappeared, and the mother refuses to leave until Fuzzhead is found.  After a long 2 weeks, they finally find her, so now it's Vacation Time!  They travel by car to Michigan with lots of laughs along the way!  Like I mentioned earlier, this movie is narrated by Jean Shepherd, who does the voice for Old Ralph, and makes a brief appearance as Mr. Scott, Ralph's boss.  This movie is very similar to Christmas Story, even the characters names are the same!  The only real difference is that this takes place in the summer!  This movie was a TV movie, made for The Disney Channel.  Filmed in the DFW area of Texas, and released in August 1988, this movie is GREAT for all ages.  So if you liked A Christmas Story, get this movie!  Im tellin' ya, it's KOOL!!",5,Ollie Hopnoodle: A Christmas Story in the Summer!,1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,1250,"['Hey', 'movie', 'viewers', 'liked', 'great', '1983', 'movie', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'was', 'narrated', 'based', 'novel', 'Jean', 'Shepherd', ""'ll"", 'really', 'like', 'hilarious', '1988', 'comedy', 'teen', 'named', 'Ralph', 'Parker', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'Indiana', 'late', '40', 'early', '50', 'who', 'go', 'vacation', 'year', 'lake', 'Michigan', 'stay', 'resort', 'lake', 'called', 'Ollie', 'Hopnoodle', 'Haven', 'Bliss', '6', 'log', 'cabins', 'Unfortunately', 'family', 'dog', 'Fuzzhead', 'disappeared', 'mother', 'leave', 'Fuzzhead', 'found', 'long', '2', 'weeks', 'finally', 'find', 'so', 'now', 'Vacation', 'Time', 'travel', 'car', 'Michigan', 'lots', 'laughs', 'way', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'movie', 'narrated', 'Jean', 'Shepherd', 'who', 'voice', 'Old', 'Ralph', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'Ralph', 'boss', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'even', 'characters', 'names', 'are', 'same', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'place', 'summer', 'movie', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', 'made', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Filmed', 'DFW', 'area', 'Texas', 'released', 'August', '1988', 'movie', 'GREAT', 'ages', 'So', 'liked', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'get', 'movie', 'Im', 'tellin', 'ya', 'KOOL']",N/A

It is by far the best of Jean Shephard's ""Ralph"" stories.  While the first part runs a bit long, once they start the trip, everything comes together to bring back ""fond"" memories of bygone family trips of our own.",5,Love This Movie!!,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,305,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'movie', 'saw', 'Disney', 'channel', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'young', 'far', 'best', 'Jean', 'Shephard', 'Ralph', 'stories', 'first', 'part', 'bit', 'long', 'once', 'start', 'trip', 'everything', 'together', 'bring', 'back', 'fond', 'memories', 'bygone', 'family', 'trips', 'own']",N/A
347390,AFD63W178JYOT,6302961513,Tim Van Boening,"[2, 2]","I saw this when it aired on The Disney Channel a couple times back in 1991.  I thought it was just as funny as A Christmas Story.  Since it was released onto VHS by Disney back in 1993, I'm certain that if there was a very big demand, which there might be, I think if Disney did release this onto DVD, it would be bought by the ones who remembered it and loved it.  And would purchase it for the newer generation of families.One funny part I remember were when the Parker family had a picnic and Randy wanted a PB&J; sandwich and didn't like the sandwich his mom gave him to eat and threw it into the air and landed in the middle of the road, and a car ran over it.  Another funny part I remember was when a bee got into their car they all ran far away from their car right after parking the car.  Other the that I think this was a good family comedy.In conclusion, as much as I did like ""Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss"" for what it was, I think that this movie, which is also written by Jean Shepherd, who wrote the book ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash"" which was what A Christmas Story was based off of, should have it's spot on DVD along with many other movies (sometimes rare or obscured) owned by any movie studio that have yet to wait for their DVD releases.",5,Continuation of the Parker Family from A Christmas Story,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,1272,"['saw', 'when', 'aired', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'couple', 'times', 'back', '1991', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', 'Disney', 'back', '1993', ""'m"", 'certain', 'was', 'very', 'big', 'demand', 'might', 'be', 'think', 'Disney', 'did', 'release', 'onto', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'bought', 'ones', 'who', 'remembered', 'loved', 'would', 'purchase', 'newer', 'generation', 'families.One', 'funny', 'part', 'remember', 'were', 'when', 'Parker', 'family', 'had', 'picnic', 'Randy', 'wanted', 'PB', 'J', 'sandwich', 'did', ""n't"", 'sandwich', 'mom', 'gave', 'eat', 'threw', 'air', 'landed', 'middle', 'road', 'car', 'ran', 'funny', 'part', 'remember', 'was', 'when', 'bee', 'got', 'car', 'ran', 'far', 'away', 'car', 'right', 'parking', 'car', 'Other', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'family', 'comedy.In', 'conclusion', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Ollie', 'Hopnoodle', 'Haven', 'Bliss', 'what', 'was', 'think', 'movie', 'also', 'written', 'Jean', 'Shepherd', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'God', 'Trust', 'All', 'Others', 'Pay', 'Cash', 'was', 'what', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'was', 'based', 'should', 'have', 'spot', 'DVD', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'rare', 'obscured', 'owned', 'movie', 'studio', 'have', 'yet', 'wait', 'DVD', 'releases']",N/A
