It is wartime and he is a shell-shocked soldier on furlough while she is on holiday furlough from prison where she has been serving a sentence for accidental manslaughter.  Neither is confident enough to share their own story, but they are attracted to each other and begin a whirlwind romance filled with love, laughter, and the normalcy they are both desperate to regain.All good things must come to an end, and their furloughs are no exception.  Will they be able to reveal their deepest secrets?  Can true love find a way to work through the hurt and sadness?  Can each accept the other's past and uncertain future?This is an extraordinary movie and a wonderful love story filled with wholesome family life, compassionate characters, and a most realistic look at the battle fatigue experienced by soldiers.  The stellar cast includes a teenage Shirley Temple and Spring Byington in her pre-December Bride days.

838604,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B0002KPHXI,Bobby Underwood,"[158, 161]","Like the scent of perfume a girl from our youth wore, so this film is etched in the hearts of all who have seen it, only to be recalled with fondness when something small, like that special feminine fragrance, touches our senses and brings back memories. Until now, this is all we had. Fortunately, and at last, we can visit this wonderful film with Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton anytime we want, as after decades of waiting, it is now available to us.Based on a radio play by Charles Martin, this sweet and sentimental story very much has that involving feel many of the classy productions brought to the airwaves by Lux Radio Theatre had. It benefits greatly from the direction of William Dieterle, who allows the simple story to unfold in a natural way, with a minimalist approach. Both Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton underplay their roles, giving a premise which might have been a bit saccharine in other hands,  a very real and moving feel.One of the great songs made popular during WWII is used to good effect, as it sets the mood for a film about love during wartime. Both Mary (Ginger) and Zachery (Cotton) are shell-shocked as this film opens; he literally so, from war wounds and the psycological aftereffects, and she from a tragedy which left her in prison. He is on a furlough from the hospital to help regain his confidence and aid his recovery, and she is given a short leave back home during the holidays for good behavior, after which both must return.They meet on the train and when Mary gets off in Pine Hill, Zachery, who really has no place else to go, makes up a story so he can get off there and see her again. She can tell he is slightly lost in the real world, and so is she. It is obvious how much has changed since her time in prison when she tries to purchase a chocolate almond bar and gum in the train station. But it is wartime and she can not explain to the clerk where she has been, nor can she tell Zachery, who must believe in her and have hope so he can recover fully.As Mary adjusts to the outside and she begins to care for Zachery, she tries not to dream, as she knows dreams are impossible in her position. Spring Byington, Tom Tully, and a teenage Shirley Temple are all very good as Mary's only remaining family. Barbara (Temple) is a typical young girl with growing pains. Her reservations about Mary slowly fall away as they become closer, crushed completely when the reason for Mary's incarceration is brought out into the open.The feelings  of Mary and Zach grow as they do small town things through the Christmas season, and by the New Year's dance at the Y.M.C.A. they are in love. But a shadow is cast on their momentary happiness as little reminders of their past begin to creep in. For Zach it is a flashback, and for Mary it is a corsiage, a reminder of a time when she was twenty and lonely, and tragedy followed. She wants to tell Zach but can't, as he is scared and needs belief so he can get well.This film will certainly touch your heart in a very special way as the parting of these two lost souls who have found each other quickly approaches and we long for their happiness. You must see this film to discover their fate. It is something you will always remember. First time viewers of this film need patience. It does not grab you like most films, but rather begins as a simple caress, which grows into a full embrace by the film's conclusion. If you are sentimental or romantic in the least, you must own this wonderful film.",5,"""Where Have You Been?""",1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,3489,"['scent', 'perfume', 'girl', 'youth', 'wore', 'film', 'etched', 'hearts', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'only', 'be', 'recalled', 'fondness', 'when', 'something', 'small', 'special', 'feminine', 'fragrance', 'senses', 'back', 'memories', 'now', 'had', 'Fortunately', 'last', 'can', 'visit', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'want', 'decades', 'waiting', 'now', 'available', 'us.Based', 'radio', 'play', 'Charles', 'Martin', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'involving', 'feel', 'many', 'classy', 'productions', 'brought', 'airwaves', 'Lux', 'Radio', 'Theatre', 'had', 'benefits', 'greatly', 'direction', 'William', 'Dieterle', 'who', 'simple', 'story', 'unfold', 'natural', 'way', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'underplay', 'roles', 'giving', 'premise', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'saccharine', 'other', 'hands', 'very', 'real', 'moving', 'feel.One', 'great', 'songs', 'made', 'popular', 'WWII', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'mood', 'film', 'love', 'wartime', 'Mary', 'Ginger', 'Zachery', 'Cotton', 'are', 'shell-shocked', 'film', 'literally', 'so', 'war', 'wounds', 'psycological', 'aftereffects', 'tragedy', 'left', 'prison', 'furlough', 'hospital', 'help', 'regain', 'confidence', 'aid', 'recovery', 'given', 'short', 'leave', 'back', 'home', 'holidays', 'good', 'behavior', 'must', 'return.They', 'meet', 'train', 'when', 'Mary', 'off', 'Pine', 'Hill', 'Zachery', 'who', 'really', 'place', 'else', 'go', 'up', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'see', 'again', 'can', 'tell', 'slightly', 'lost', 'real', 'world', 'so', 'obvious', 'how', 'much', 'changed', 'time', 'prison', 'when', 'purchase', 'chocolate', 'almond', 'bar', 'gum', 'train', 'station', 'wartime', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'clerk', 'where', 'been', 'can', 'tell', 'Zachery', 'who', 'must', 'believe', 'have', 'hope', 'can', 'recover', 'fully.As', 'Mary', 'adjusts', 'outside', 'care', 'Zachery', 'not', 'dream', 'dreams', 'are', 'impossible', 'position', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'Tom', 'Tully', 'teenage', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Mary', 'only', 'remaining', 'family', 'Barbara', 'Temple', 'typical', 'young', 'girl', 'growing', 'pains', 'reservations', 'Mary', 'slowly', 'fall', 'away', 'become', 'closer', 'crushed', 'completely', 'when', 'reason', 'Mary', 'incarceration', 'brought', 'out', 'open.The', 'feelings', 'Mary', 'Zach', 'grow', 'do', 'small', 'town', 'things', 'Christmas', 'season', 'New', 'Year', 'dance', 'Y.M.C.A', 'are', 'love', 'shadow', 'cast', 'momentary', 'happiness', 'little', 'reminders', 'past', 'begin', 'creep', 'Zach', 'flashback', 'Mary', 'corsiage', 'reminder', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'twenty', 'lonely', 'tragedy', 'followed', 'tell', 'Zach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'scared', 'needs', 'belief', 'can', 'get', 'well.This', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'touch', 'heart', 'very', 'special', 'way', 'parting', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'quickly', 'approaches', 'long', 'happiness', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'discover', 'fate', 'something', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'First', 'time', 'viewers', 'film', 'need', 'patience', 'not', 'grab', 'most', 'films', 'rather', 'simple', 'caress', 'full', 'embrace', 'film', 'conclusion', 'are', 'sentimental', 'romantic', 'least', 'must', 'own', 'wonderful', 'film']",I'll Be Seeing You

838606,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0002KPHXI,calvinnme,"[1, 1]","I'll Be Seeing You captures the loneliness of two people who - besides their own serious problems - just don't fit into the bustling wartime image we often see of America in film during that time.The opening scene is in a busy train station. We quickly focus in on two travelers. She (Ginger Rogers as Mary Marshall) is uncomfortable when she tries first to buy a stick of gum and then a chocolate bar and is rebuffed by the sales clerk as though she had been asking to buy gold bullion at a five and dime. He (Joseph Cotten as Zachary Morgan) is uncomfortable because he wants to buy reading material and all that is available is full of news about the war and images that you can tell make him squeamish.Zach is suffering from what would be called PTSD today due to battle fatigue, and he's ashamed of that fact, afraid of winding up like the shell-shocked WWI soldier he knew as a boy.Mary is a convict out on Christmas furlough, although what she is serving time for will probably be a shock to modern sensibilities - I know it was for me. She is also ashamed - understandably perhaps for being a convict, not so understandably for what she did to become one. I'll let you watch the movie and see what I'm talking about here.Against this backdrop of people who feel badly for the positions they are in due to social mores of the 1940's - soldiers are always brave and good girls never get themselves into the position Mary got herself into, these two lonely people find each other and connect. At first Zach lies to Mary about his situation, but then tells her the truth. Mary chooses to keep the truth from Zach, partly because she loves him and doesn't want to lose him, but mainly because her company is making him well - he says her self-confidence is giving him confidence - and she doesn't want to set back his recovery.Mary is staying with her aunt, uncle, and cousin during the holidays, and this warm family setting has both of them healing just a bit. Shirley Temple plays the cousin that is too young to know why Mary is in prison or wear lipstick according to her parents, but is apparently old enough to go out unchaperoned with a Lieutenant on leave who is probably five years older than she! Spring Byington plays the aunt who is supportive overall but still drops phrases from time to time that leave you wondering about the overall wisdom of her advise. For example, she keeps telling Mary to settle for second best and pretend it's first best - that's what she did!. Rather wacky advice by today's standards, but maybe mainstream feelings for people who married during the roaring twenties, and then raised a family during the depression and world war.I highly recommend this sentimental favorite of mine. I'm rather surprised it hasn't become more of a Christmas standard, because even though in many ways it is a unique snapshot in time, the story of two lonely people finding each other in a world that would probably judge them severely if they were open about their problems is universal.",4,A senitmental favorite of mine,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,3015,"[""'ll"", 'Be', 'Seeing', 'captures', 'loneliness', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'own', 'serious', 'problems', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bustling', 'wartime', 'image', 'often', 'see', 'America', 'film', 'time.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'busy', 'train', 'station', 'quickly', 'focus', 'two', 'travelers', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Mary', 'Marshall', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'first', 'buy', 'stick', 'gum', 'then', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'rebuffed', 'sales', 'clerk', 'had', 'been', 'asking', 'buy', 'gold', 'bullion', 'five', 'dime', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Zachary', 'Morgan', 'uncomfortable', 'buy', 'reading', 'material', 'available', 'full', 'news', 'war', 'images', 'can', 'tell', 'make', 'squeamish.Zach', 'suffering', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'PTSD', 'today', 'due', 'battle', 'fatigue', 'ashamed', 'fact', 'afraid', 'winding', 'up', 'shell-shocked', 'WWI', 'soldier', 'knew', 'boy.Mary', 'convict', 'out', 'Christmas', 'furlough', 'what', 'serving', 'time', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'shock', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'know', 'was', 'also', 'ashamed', 'understandably', 'perhaps', 'being', 'convict', 'not', 'so', 'understandably', 'what', 'did', 'become', 'one', ""'ll"", 'let', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'here.Against', 'backdrop', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'badly', 'positions', 'are', 'due', 'social', 'mores', '1940', 'soldiers', 'are', 'always', 'brave', 'good', 'girls', 'never', 'get', 'position', 'Mary', 'got', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'find', 'other', 'connect', 'first', 'Zach', 'Mary', 'situation', 'then', 'truth', 'Mary', 'chooses', 'keep', 'truth', 'Zach', 'partly', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', 'mainly', 'company', 'making', 'well', 'self-confidence', 'giving', 'confidence', ""n't"", 'want', 'set', 'back', 'recovery.Mary', 'staying', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'cousin', 'holidays', 'warm', 'family', 'setting', 'healing', 'just', 'bit', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'cousin', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'why', 'Mary', 'prison', 'wear', 'lipstick', 'according', 'parents', 'apparently', 'old', 'enough', 'go', 'out', 'unchaperoned', 'Lieutenant', 'leave', 'who', 'probably', 'five', 'years', 'older', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'aunt', 'who', 'supportive', 'overall', 'still', 'phrases', 'time', 'time', 'leave', 'wondering', 'overall', 'wisdom', 'advise', 'example', 'telling', 'Mary', 'settle', 'second', 'best', 'pretend', 'first', 'best', 'what', 'did', 'wacky', 'advice', 'today', 'standards', 'maybe', 'mainstream', 'feelings', 'people', 'who', 'married', 'roaring', 'twenties', 'then', 'raised', 'family', 'depression', 'world', 'war.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'sentimental', 'favorite', 'mine', ""'m"", 'rather', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'become', 'more', 'Christmas', 'standard', 'even', 'many', 'ways', 'unique', 'snapshot', 'time', 'story', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'finding', 'other', 'world', 'would', 'probably', 'judge', 'severely', 'were', 'open', 'problems', 'universal']",I'll Be Seeing You

Cotton is a ""shell-shocked"" (PTSD) soldier, on leave from the war, back home where civilians blandly cheer him as a hero, and where little kids playing with pop-guns give him the shakes. Rogers has her own tragedy to contend with: she's been given a holiday furlough from the state prison where she's serving a term for manslaughter (the telling of that tale is a masterpiece of melodramatic scriptwriting bravura!)What's most intriguing about this film is that it was made during the war, and not after -- several postwar films dealt with social issues such as the shortages in housing and jobs, the psychological problems of returning vets, etc.  But seeing these kind of issues in a film made during the war, at a time when patriotic propaganda was the norm, is actually a bit unnerving. Combined with the over-the-top romantic plot, it's a bit like seeing a collaboration between Preston Sturges and Douglas Sirk... Great stuff!

(NIAGARAis perhaps his most dramatic andTHE THIRD MANhis most famous.) Zachary Morgan (Cotten) is a socially inert, shell-shocked, purple hearted, sergeant wondering what to do during an 8-day furlough from an army psychiatric hospital. On a train to Pinehill, he meets Mary Marshall (Ginger Rogers), lonely, downhearted manslaughter convict on a Christmas furlough from prison. Despite awkward moments initiated by flashbacks, their attraction grows. Zach openly confides secrets to Mary, though she feels reciprocation will bring condemnation. As Zach builds the courage to propose marriage, Mary recoils. Her teenage cousin Barbara Marshall (Shirley Temple) innocently reveals Mary's circumstances to Zach. He then must decide how to cope with the revelation.I'LL BE SEEING YOU is definitely not a Rogers musical comedy nor is it a typical Cotten noir. Action is isolated to a dog encounter during an evening stroll. The only dancing by Rogers and Temple is the waltz at a New Year's celebration. Expect singing? There's a family Christmas carol around the dinner table. The dialogue isn't particularly clever but genuine. I'LL BE SEEING YOU is a rather tame linear drama inspiring hope while delivering a message about acceptance, honesty, and chastity that may well appeal to romantic audiences or those scarred by war or other personal adversities. Image quality is very good. With an all-star cast, mediocre plot and no DVD extras, I rate the movie 3.5 stars (rounded to 4).Movie quote: ""You have to get used to accepting what you think is second best, and then you find out it's first best after all.""",4,Tame romance,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,1683,"['As', 'good', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'truly', 'animated', 'role', 'NIAGARAis', 'perhaps', 'most', 'dramatic', 'andTHE', 'THIRD', 'MANhis', 'most', 'famous', 'Zachary', 'Morgan', 'Cotten', 'socially', 'inert', 'shell-shocked', 'purple', 'hearted', 'sergeant', 'wondering', 'what', 'do', '8-day', 'furlough', 'army', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'train', 'Pinehill', 'Mary', 'Marshall', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'lonely', 'downhearted', 'manslaughter', 'convict', 'Christmas', 'furlough', 'prison', 'awkward', 'moments', 'initiated', 'flashbacks', 'attraction', 'grows', 'Zach', 'openly', 'secrets', 'Mary', 'reciprocation', 'will', 'bring', 'condemnation', 'Zach', 'courage', 'propose', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'teenage', 'cousin', 'Barbara', 'Marshall', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'innocently', 'Mary', 'circumstances', 'Zach', 'then', 'must', 'decide', 'how', 'cope', 'revelation.I', 'BE', 'SEEING', 'YOU', 'definitely', 'not', 'Rogers', 'musical', 'comedy', 'typical', 'Cotten', 'noir', 'Action', 'isolated', 'dog', 'encounter', 'evening', 'stroll', 'only', 'dancing', 'Rogers', 'Temple', 'waltz', 'New', 'Year', 'celebration', 'Expect', 'singing', 'family', 'Christmas', 'carol', 'dinner', 'table', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'clever', 'genuine', ""'LL"", 'BE', 'SEEING', 'YOU', 'rather', 'tame', 'linear', 'drama', 'inspiring', 'hope', 'delivering', 'message', 'acceptance', 'honesty', 'chastity', 'may', 'well', 'appeal', 'romantic', 'audiences', 'scarred', 'war', 'other', 'personal', 'adversities', 'Image', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'all-star', 'cast', 'mediocre', 'plot', 'DVD', 'extras', 'rate', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'rounded', '4', '.Movie', 'quote', 'have', 'get', 'used', 'accepting', 'what', 'think', 'second', 'best', 'then', 'find', 'first', 'best']",I'll Be Seeing You

838616,A1FNW6H983I87V,B0002KPHXI,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[5, 5]","STORY - A soldier and a young, attractive woman in a hurry to catch the train 'home' for the Christmas holidays, both stop at the newspaper stand simultaneously. The soldier (Cotten) is obviously nervous and distracted and the woman (Rogers) is confused why gum is not available. They end up sitting across from one another on the train. The conversation is awkward but the soldier decides quickly to create a story about going to the same destination in the hopes of seeing her again. As the story develops we learn the secrets each is carrying and the obvious risk there is in sharing that secret with someone they might care about. They each must deal with their secrets apart, also, as they wrestle the demons from the past. The story of the soldier could easily apply to any one of our troops today coming home from Iraq or Afghanistan. This is a well done story and performance by everyone involved. Shirley Temple is a little over the top as Roger's niece but turns in a solid performance as well. While not as well known as THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, it is a worthwhile addition to your Christmas collection. Enjoy the Christmas season and remember those you meet may be dealing with unseen demons in their lives.

838617,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0002KPHXI,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","I'll Be Seeing You grabbed my attention from the beginning until the very end of the film! The actors all give outstanding, convincing performances; the sets are very detailed and reflect so much forethought; the plot moves along at just the right pace; the use of lighting helps to make the scenes just right and the choreography and the cinematography both shine, too! Ginger Rogers certainly proved that she could act in a serious role that didn't require much dancing and Joseph Cotton was just right for the part. In addition, Shirley Temple plays somewhat against type by being not always the good little girl she was known to be by movie going audiences--and Shirley succeeds very well here! Kudos also goes to director William Dieterle (and George Cukor) for also making this an exceptionally fine motion picture. Indeed, everything is so well done that when others say that they don't make movies like this anymore I definitely agree with them--this is a memorable film that couldn't have been done any better. True, some people will say this story is corny but it tugged at my heartstrings and I loved it.At the start, we meet two rather lonely souls in a train station at Christmastime during World War Two--one is Mary Marshall (Ginger Rogers) who is on a brief leave from prison for good behavior and the other is Zachary Morgan (Joseph Cotton) who is also briefly away from a hospital that treats ""neuro-psychiatric"" soldiers suffering from ""shell shock"" but we call it post-traumatic stress disorder today. Mary takes the train that stops at Pinehill and by chance Zachary sits opposite her on the same train, too--and Zachary takes such a liking to Mary that he decides to make up a lie about visiting a sister in Pinehill so he can get off there with Mary and hopefully see her again.And while the two certainly do see each other again--not long after at that--there are a few other people who figure into the picture. Mary is staying with her sweet Aunt, Mrs. Marshall (Spring Byington) and her Uncle, Mr. Marshall (Tom Tully). Mary also shares a room with the too young to understand even though she thinks she's all grown up at seventeen cousin, Barbara (Shirley Temple) who has separate soap dishes, towels and even parts of the clothing closet for Mary as if Mary had some sort of communicable disease.Zachary and Mary become fond of each other rather quickly and their blossoming romance is very sweet to watch. Zachary is also welcomed into the Marshall home as they are told that that his ""sister"" had to go away leaving him alone for the holiday. While Zachary eventually tells Mary his secret about his post-traumatic stress disorder and hopes Mary will still want him as a romantic interest, Mary is far more reluctant to reveal her secret to Zachary--she has served only three years of her six year prison sentence and she is greatly ashamed of her plight even though as we learn Mary was truly a victim of a man trying to violate her and she had absolutely no intentions of doing him any real harm--he fell out of a fourteenth floor window when she pushed him off her during a violent struggle. Mary also fears that if Zachary knew her ""secret"" it could give him a psychological setback. (True, Zachary and Mary might not have been quite so secretive about their problems in today's society with out different values and general outlooks on life but that's another story.)There's much more to the plot than just this--no plot spoilers here--watch and find out! Watch closely and you'll see John Derek as Lieutenant Bruce and Chill Wills plays Swanson.I'll Be Seeing You is an incredibly special motion picture.

838619,A3ET9OE3TQ9OEJ,B0002KPHXI,Nix Pix,"[17, 19]","&quot;I'll Be Seeing You&quot; is a bittersweet melodrama about a female convict, Mary Marshall (Ginger Rogers) who is released from the state penitentiary on a Christmas leave. Boarding a westbound train, Mary meets Zachary Morgan (Joseph Cotten) an army sergeant who has just been released from a mental hospital. The two develop an affinity for one another on their journey, so much so that, after learning he'll be spending Christmas alone, Mary invites Zach to her place for dinner. The unlikely romance that blossoms between these two is both tragic and poignant. Mary keeps her incarceration a secret and Zach does his best to conceal the fact that he is a man with more than his share of psychological problems. Ultimately the story dissolves into the sort of treacle one might expect from war time schlock and nonsense, but it's central performances are so solid and poignant that one easily overlooks the implausibility of it all and has a tear jerking, heart-rending good cry and smile through it all.MGM's DVD is impressive. The B&amp;W picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Some minor edge enhancement crops up and there is more than a hint of pixelization in infrequent spots but overall the picture will surely not disappoint.

838623,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B0002KPHXI,Simon Davis,"[43, 45]","""I'll Be Seeing You"", is a wonderful companion piece to that other moving wartime story produced by David O. Selznick in 1944, ""Since You Went Away"", and it provided Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton with one of their best vehicles during the mid 1940's. Dismissed nowadays as a sugar coated romance that piles on the sentiment I dont see that as a failing at all and instead it provides a touching human story about two injured individuals finding love at an unexpected time in their lives when things are not going well. Selznick of course will be forever remembered and revered for producing grandiose stories such as ""Gone With The Wind"", however his abilities with smaller scale human dramas about seemingly ordinary people in ordinary situations have I feel never been given enough recognition. ""I'll Be Seeing You"", which was based on Charles Martin's radio play ""Double Furlough"", truly proves my point that his way of approaching smaller scale story telling was just as memorable. Here Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton play two very average and identifiable people, one a victim of the world war currently engulfing the world, and the second an unfortunate victim of one action that had serious consequences, situations any individual could find themselves in. What a joy it was to discover that this beautiful little film has finally been made available via DVD after being so hard to track down for so long.Set during World War Two ""I'll Be Seeing You"", has Ginger Rogers as Mary Marshall a lonely woman who is half way through a prison sentence for a charge of accidental manslaughter who because of her good behaviour is given an eight day leave pass over the Christmas period. Travelling to visit her relations on the train she meets Zachary Morgan (Joseph Cotton), and the two strike up a friendship. Zachary has only recently been released from the hospitial as he has been suffering from shell shock and war injuries and the plan is to see if he can speed his recovery by getting out into the world. He implusively follows Mary to her stop and pretends that he is visiting his sister in the same town of Pine Hill. Mary arranges for Zachary to visit her at the home of her aunt and uncle (Tom Tully and Spring Byington), and the pair spend much time together and very quickly fall in love. Romance develops for the two as they spend Christmas Day together and then both attend the YMCA dance on New Years Eve. Both however have the dilemma of having to tell the other of their problems and with Mary having to report back to prison at the end of the holidays time begins to run out. One their last day in Pine Hill Mary's younger cousin Barbara (Shirley Temple), unintentionally discloses to Zachary about Mary's real situation and in his initial shock and anger  he tries to get away from Mary as quickly as possible. He boards the train without really saying goodbye to her and Mary faces the lonely prospect of life back in prison with no one waiting for her. Bidding her family a sad goodbye Mary prepares to continue with her sentence but just as she arrives at the prison gates fate takes a pleasant turn for her for once when  she is greeted by a remorseful Zachary who reaffirms his deep love for her. Zachary states firmly that he truly loves her and that whatever it takes they will be together and that he will wait until she is released from prison so that they can be married.A touching love story set at Christmas is of course a natural for romantic movie lovers however this effort is much more than just that. Fine story telling combines here with well thought out performances by the cast to create a story that leaves you with something to think about in regard to our needs as individuals. Ginger Rogers especially as the woman out on Christmas leave from prison proves once and for all what a fine dramatic actress she truly was among all her other screen talents. She also has a believable and at times quite poignant screen chemistry with Joseph Cotton as the mentally scarred Sargeant just out of hospital that makes us care about these two essentially lonely and hurt individuals. Long wanting to be recognised for more than just being Fred Astaire's dance partner, here Rogers proves that with a well thought out and modulated performance that shows beautifully all her characters insecurities and fears when she finds herself falling in love with Cotton's character. Joseph Cotton, a Selznick contractee delivers another interesting performance here and makes his Zachary Morgan a very human individual fighting a terrible affliction and then having to learn to deal with his unexpected love for Mary. Supporting performances are first rate all around. A teenage Shirley Temple fresh from her triumph in Selznick's classic ""Since You Went Away"", delivers another fine performance here full of teenage spunk and vivacity and I always think it a tragedy that her later teenage roles for the most part never matched the quality of her work in productions like 'Since You Went Away"", and ""I'll Be Seeing You"". Spring Byington who had  already worked with Ginger Rogers in the delightful comedy romance ""Lucky Partners"", in 1940 again combines well with her here as her Aunt and despite the two having very different acting styles and screen personas they have a wonderfully relaxed rapport on screen together. ""I'll Be Seeing You"", had the usual meticulous attention to detail recreating in the studio exactly what was still happening in the world at that time (1944-45). Like in all war times there is always humour in among the sorrow and this production provides just that, for example in the dress shop scene,and at the YMCA New Years Eve Ball, and these are randomly situated between the more serious goings on throughout the film's running time. Of course the drama here is what makes ""I'll Be Seeing You"", such a standout and is vividly represented in scenes such as Mary's terrible recollection to Barbara of the incident that put her in jail, through to Zachary's ongoing efforts to curb his mental sufferings resulting from his active duties. Director William Dieterle keeps the pace of the story moving and we see a growing inner confidence developing in both Mary and Zachary that sees them overcome their fears and lack of trust in others to follow their hearts in their feelings for each other.Tender romances about ordinary people who are not perfect are seldom seen nowadays but the strength of ""I'll Be Seeing You"", rests in its ability to make two such ordinary people infinitely interesting and people who we care about. I've always enjoyed the great talents of both Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton and the two make most believable lovers here. The charming Christmas setting taking place during the dark war years is guarenteed to tug at the heart strings of any romantic movie lover and it never fails to move me with its simple message of love and respect for others no matter what their affliction or failings are. Take a romantic journey back soon to a simple war time Hollywood love story to see how effectively it could be portrayed on screen in Selznick Productions, ""I'll Be Seeing You"" .",5,Ginger Rogers

838624,A1MNRH0ESVNIM8,B0002KPHXI,"Steven L. Katz ""H.S Katz""","[63, 71]","at first i didn't know what to expect from this movie, seeing as it deals with the later part of ginger's peak career, (mid-late forties) I needn't have worried however, for Ginger and Mr. Joseph Cotten give truly wonderful performances. These were two of the best actors of their day, and it shows in their suble, yet powerful performnaces. They have a very intense chemistry together, and it's a shame they didn't work together again. They were friends off camera though, as Ginger was really friends with everyone in Hollywood back then. The color and sound qulaity here are terrific with good solid blacks, and crisp greys and whites. A teenage Shirley Temple appears as Ginger's cousin, and it's fun to see the two musical queens of the thirties together. Now all we need is some music! Although she appears sans her sprightly curls, Temple gives a spirited and realistic performance that really shows off her acting ability. Two scenes that really impressed me, the first, after saing goodnight to Ginger on New Years, he goes back to his room, where he has another phsychological attack. It's incredibly done, and really attention grabbing. When he looks up at the lightbulb, and hallucinates that it's a bomb falling, it's reaaly quite frightening. The other scene that I though was particarly well done was the very last scene. As ginger wals back to prison, Joseph is waiting for her in the shadow. In one swift motion, she spies him, drops her bag and runs into his arms. Other actresses may have looked, put down the bag, and then ran to him, but not Ginger, in one action, she can accomplish so much. The ending lines are dramatic, but not treachly, or overly so as the other reviewer may have suggested. Ginger says one of the things that she rarely says, ""I love you [so much]"" in the past, she has said, ""I'm in love with you/him"" etc... but never really a direct statement. He then explains that he'll be there for her and that he'll marry her when she gets out. It's bittersweet to be sure, but Optmism never alluded these two. This movie is a perfect example of how the movie's used to be, and probably never will be again. Not to mentio, all the talent that we used to get from the movies has disappeared, so see this nostalgic flick, and see the movies, Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten in their Golden age.",5,very nice picture,1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,2327,"['first', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'seeing', 'later', 'part', 'ginger', 'peak', 'career', 'mid-late', 'forties', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'however', 'Ginger', 'Mr.', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'give', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'were', 'two', 'best', 'actors', 'day', 'suble', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performnaces', 'have', 'very', 'intense', 'chemistry', 'together', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'together', 'again', 'were', 'friends', 'off', 'camera', 'though', 'Ginger', 'was', 'really', 'friends', 'everyone', 'Hollywood', 'back', 'then', 'color', 'sound', 'qulaity', 'here', 'are', 'terrific', 'good', 'solid', 'blacks', 'crisp', 'greys', 'whites', 'teenage', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Ginger', 'cousin', 'fun', 'see', 'two', 'musical', 'queens', 'thirties', 'together', 'Now', 'need', 'music', 'sprightly', 'curls', 'Temple', 'spirited', 'realistic', 'performance', 'really', 'acting', 'ability', 'Two', 'scenes', 'really', 'impressed', 'first', 'saing', 'goodnight', 'Ginger', 'New', 'Years', 'back', 'room', 'where', 'phsychological', 'attack', 'incredibly', 'done', 'really', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'When', 'up', 'lightbulb', 'bomb', 'falling', 'reaaly', 'quite', 'frightening', 'other', 'scene', 'though', 'was', 'particarly', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'ginger', 'wals', 'back', 'prison', 'Joseph', 'waiting', 'shadow', 'one', 'swift', 'motion', 'bag', 'arms', 'Other', 'actresses', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'put', 'down', 'bag', 'then', 'ran', 'not', 'Ginger', 'one', 'action', 'can', 'accomplish', 'so', 'much', 'ending', 'lines', 'are', 'dramatic', 'not', 'treachly', 'overly', 'so', 'other', 'reviewer', 'may', 'have', 'suggested', 'Ginger', 'one', 'things', 'rarely', 'love', '[', 'so', 'much', ']', 'past', 'said', ""'m"", 'love', 'you/him', 'etc', 'never', 'really', 'direct', 'statement', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', ""'ll"", 'marry', 'when', 'out', 'bittersweet', 'be', 'sure', 'Optmism', 'never', 'alluded', 'two', 'movie', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'movie', 'used', 'be', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'again', 'Not', 'mentio', 'talent', 'used', 'get', 'movies', 'disappeared', 'so', 'see', 'nostalgic', 'flick', 'see', 'movies', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Golden', 'age']",I'll Be Seeing You
