978582,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000ETR9VU,Alistair McHarg,"[52, 53]","Human Trafficking is a bold and ambitious project; Lifetime is to be congratulated for exposing a part of society most people would prefer to ignore, and doing so in a mature, serious fashion.  Originally designed as a mini-series, it is presented here in its entirety, with convenient breaks.  This is helpful, at three hours it may be too much for the average viewer to assimilate all at once.  Even the jaded appetite will find Human Trafficking upsetting.One must wonder about those who claim ignorance of sexual slavery as it is practiced around the world.  This appalling behavior is more than merely time-honored; it is codified and woven into the fabric of society itself.  What is surprising, and what Human Trafficking gets right, is that sexual slavery is alive, well, and lucrative.  Like drugs and weapons, a filthy business like this can only exist where there is powerful market demand, and that demand is chillingly close to home.Human Trafficking benefits from good directing, (Christian Duguay), and some splendid performances.  Leading the way is the lovable Scot from The Full Monty, (Robert Carlyle), who plays the Eastern block criminal mastermind behind the sophisticated sexual gulag.  His accent is impeccable, and his character well realized.  Sergei Karpovich is no Cold War ham-fisted brute.  He is smart, computer-savvy, and thoroughly ruthless.  (Like so many inner-city drug dealers, under different circumstances he probably would have been a captain of legitimate industry.)After Carlyle, the showcase performance here belongs to Isabella Blais, (Helena), one of the women whose decent into sexual slavery is tracked.  Helena is certainly not stupid, but she is vulnerable, and we watch in horror as one bad decision lures her into an unimaginable nightmare.  We also see some of the ingenious techniques used to ensure cooperation.  This is where Human Trafficking really shines.  It's never sensational, licentious, or titillating.  On the contrary, it exposes the complete banality of evil, the disturbing ordinariness of it in flat details that do not manipulate emotions.There are two problems with Human Trafficking.  At times it gets preachy, explaining the story rather than telling it.  (With subject matter this explosive, that is completely unnecessary.)  The other is the casting of Mira Sorvino.  Sorvino is a fine actress, (her performance here is fine), but she is simply too pretty and adorable for the part.  One scene attempts to show why she would take on the hideous assignment of catching these vermin, but it's not enough.  Making her character female was an interesting decision, but to work, it should have been someone with more edge and less curve.  Donald Sutherland, as her boss, excels.We imagine our society to be advanced, sophisticated, refined.  Thanks to the folks at Lifetime for shedding some light on the difficult truth.",4,Stops At A Red Light,1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,2891,"['Human', 'Trafficking', 'bold', 'ambitious', 'project', 'Lifetime', 'be', 'congratulated', 'exposing', 'part', 'society', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'prefer', 'ignore', 'doing', 'so', 'mature', 'serious', 'fashion', 'Originally', 'designed', 'mini-series', 'presented', 'here', 'entirety', 'convenient', 'breaks', 'helpful', 'three', 'hours', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'average', 'viewer', 'assimilate', 'once', 'Even', 'jaded', 'appetite', 'will', 'find', 'Human', 'Trafficking', 'upsetting.One', 'must', 'wonder', 'who', 'claim', 'ignorance', 'sexual', 'slavery', 'practiced', 'world', 'appalling', 'behavior', 'more', 'merely', 'time-honored', 'codified', 'woven', 'fabric', 'society', 'What', 'surprising', 'what', 'Human', 'Trafficking', 'right', 'sexual', 'slavery', 'alive', 'well', 'lucrative', 'drugs', 'weapons', 'filthy', 'business', 'can', 'only', 'exist', 'where', 'powerful', 'market', 'demand', 'demand', 'chillingly', 'close', 'home.Human', 'Trafficking', 'benefits', 'good', 'directing', 'Christian', 'Duguay', 'splendid', 'performances', 'Leading', 'way', 'lovable', 'Scot', 'Full', 'Monty', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'who', 'Eastern', 'block', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'sophisticated', 'sexual', 'gulag', 'accent', 'impeccable', 'character', 'well', 'realized', 'Sergei', 'Karpovich', 'Cold', 'War', 'ham-fisted', 'brute', 'smart', 'computer-savvy', 'thoroughly', 'ruthless', 'so', 'many', 'inner-city', 'drug', 'dealers', 'different', 'circumstances', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'captain', 'legitimate', 'industry', 'Carlyle', 'showcase', 'performance', 'here', 'Isabella', 'Blais', 'Helena', 'one', 'women', 'decent', 'sexual', 'slavery', 'tracked', 'Helena', 'certainly', 'not', 'stupid', 'vulnerable', 'watch', 'horror', 'one', 'bad', 'decision', 'unimaginable', 'nightmare', 'also', 'see', 'ingenious', 'techniques', 'used', 'ensure', 'cooperation', 'where', 'Human', 'Trafficking', 'really', 'never', 'sensational', 'licentious', 'titillating', 'contrary', 'complete', 'banality', 'evil', 'disturbing', 'ordinariness', 'flat', 'details', 'do', 'not', 'manipulate', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'Human', 'Trafficking', 'times', 'preachy', 'explaining', 'story', 'rather', 'telling', 'subject', 'matter', 'explosive', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'other', 'casting', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Sorvino', 'fine', 'actress', 'performance', 'here', 'fine', 'simply', 'too', 'pretty', 'adorable', 'part', 'One', 'scene', 'attempts', 'show', 'why', 'would', 'take', 'hideous', 'assignment', 'catching', 'vermin', 'not', 'enough', 'Making', 'character', 'female', 'was', 'interesting', 'decision', 'work', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'more', 'edge', 'less', 'curve', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'boss', 'excels.We', 'imagine', 'society', 'be', 'advanced', 'sophisticated', 'refined', 'Thanks', 'folks', 'Lifetime', 'shedding', 'light', 'difficult', 'truth']",N/A

Other movies exposing this are, Trade of Innocents (also Mira Sorvino), The Whistleblower (Rachel Weisz), and Trade (Kevin Kline).  The only way to change something is to expose it.  I thought the movie was 'descent', not overtly sexual and very minimal in nudity, but tried to be truthful to get across the reality of this brutality.  I KNOW these movies 'can't even cover more of the darkest of crimes being committed -- this really is evil.Too me, many people are stuck in complacency, especially, in America, ""It isn't happening to me so things must be just fine"".  People who I know consider themselves to be caring, but won't look at anything 'negative'? What?  Human Trafficking is happening in America (epidemically) under our noses.  Where is our empathy, caring, concern for each other and more importantly our children - This is what makes us ""Human"". Look around, have you lost, have we lost our 'humanity'?  It seems like we are losing ground, because the debauchery is gaining fast.America is the one country still, who can help and make changes, but truth in media is suppressed and propagandized.  Whistleblowers are now jailed, killed, and persecuted for doing the 'right' thing.The truth is still out there.We have to be able to face the truth that torture, rape, and murder are an epidemic everywhere and our own 'government' is part of it. The statistics for the abduction and selling of women and children is 2.5 million a year.  Our own soldiers are forced to take part in this brutality.  An Iraqi veteran Daniel Somers just committed suicide, leaving a gut and heart wrenching note on what he was forced to do to civilians: families, women and children.  He said, if he could go on in a 'normal life he would be a 'sociopath'.  Twenty two (22) soldiers commit suicide every day, many most likely who can't get over what what they did.  My point here, is much of this is all wrapped up together in government/corporate 'criminal organizations'.We say we want a better world for ourselves and our children, this will not happen if we are not willing to 'SEE' the horrors that are being wreaked on masses of the poor and the weak by the (criminals within) the very powers pretending to care.  There is a hell being raised on earth...human trafficking: labor and sex slavery is increasing in all countries, human organ trafficking, drug trafficking, and manufactured economic destruction are all being carried out by criminal elements in the highest of world organizations. (The Whistleblower)I, hate and am very disturbed by these movies for the right reasons, they are horrific, but again, I am so appreciative to those exposing what must be brought into the light.  Don't let these victims be forgotten like they didn't matter - they mattered just like our families and children matter.The criminals are truly 'parading' naked in the streets.

Director's fault, that one.)Yes, something should be done about the problem of human trafficking, and I hope governments of all nations have had their eyes opened up a bit, but the way things are presented here literally make you cringe.Flick is abundant with cliches and implausabilities. Good stories are character-driver, as opposed to plot-driven.So much here is idiotic and lacks credibility. Sorvino's background is absolutely sloppy  writing (not to mention lazy) and not needed. Her bickering with her (husband? boyfriend? Not sure) was not only ridiculous, but annoying as hell.Here she is this U.S. government-trained I.C.E agent, right?--but the (primary) reason she is able to relate to one of the  females (who had been abducted in the Check  Republic and smuggled into  the U.S. and forced into prostitution) is because she, herself, had been molested by her (FAVORITE) uncle years before at age 12.Come on. (I say by merely Sorvino's agent being a decent human being,  with a need to do the right thing, would have taken care of that, without the writers resorting to this contrived background tale that stuck out as such like a sore thumb.)Not only that, she ALSO happens to be Russian as well (by birth), who was raised in the U.S. (therefore giving her EVEN MORE CREDIBILITY with all these females who had been abducted in various countries overseas).Also, later on in the film, she passes herself off as a Russian mail-order bride wannabe. Wait a minute. Are you kidding me? ARE YOU SERIOUS? (she does this to go undercover.)REALLY? Don't you realize you're insulting the viewer?HOW MUCH RESEARCH DID THESE WRITERS ACTUALLY DO--IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.SPOILER AHEAD:At some point in the film, one of the victims, having been freed and given protective custody, is being shown her hotel room where she will be staying for a certain duration. While her ""protector"" Agent Sorvino is  chatting on her cell phone, the said female (in protective custody) steps out on the balcony to take in the view below.Guess what happens next? Said ""PROTECTED"" female is chilled by a sniper --- to Agent Sorvino's horror and dismay.Sure. You call this writing? Tell me another fairytale. Better yet, learn your movie cliches (so that you might avoid them when you write your next HBO special, folks.)This is what I mean by hack writing. And there are so many other situations that reek of cliche and/or WAY TOO FAR-FETCHED  and/or SEEN IT BEFORE WAY TOO MANY TIMES in other weak flicks.I'll end this rant by saying this is not the definitive take on the topic.

978607,A387BD735MI50R,B000ETR9VU,R. Schultz,"[9, 10]","First, be forewarned. There are several movies/documentaries out there with similar titles. This film does NOT deal with the subject of Mexican citizens being smuggled into the U.S. This ""Human Trafficking"" is an extremely graphic, brutal picture of girls being trapped into prostitution.I realized a sex slave trade existed, but before seeing this movie, I had no idea the practice was currently so widespread and organized. The phrase ""the slave trade"" always had a vaguely Victorian, almost comic ring to me. I knew the slave trader mainly as a bogeyman that 19th-century parents scared their daughters with, keeping them from venturing out too far or too freely into the world on their own. But I didn't know it was something that so many modern parents literally might need to guard their children against. According to this film's concluding screen facts and figures, the practice is extensive, and growing - thanks in part to hook-ups facilitated by the computer.This film shows how young women are recruited. One thinks she has qualified for a modeling job in an exotic location. One thinks she is being courted by the man of her dreams - and flies to meet him for a vacation in another country. As soon as these deluded young women arrive at their destinations - the bars on their lives clang shut. It is difficult for most of them to survive the horrors they face.Robert Carlyle is chilling here in his role as the head of a multi-national slave trafficking operation. He is a brutal juggernaut of all business-only business - in distinct contrast with the affably entrepreneurial character he played in ""The Full Monty.""Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland are less well cast as the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents on the trail of traffickers. There is something off about the dynamic between these two. It's the clich&eacute; of the female agency rookie who has to prove herself to her crusty unit boss. We've seen it a thousand times in everything from ""Silence of the Lambs"" down to current CSI episodes. But, there's something a little unnerving about this particular teaming. Unintentionally, I'm sure, there is even a disconcerting shadow of the slave trade dynamic being reenacted between these two. Sorvino is the much younger woman, being handled, managed, overseen, by the much older man. Southerland sits back in cold appraisal of her until the end, when he throws her a crumb of approval - which she might pathetically be led to interpret as affection?Also, the blondness that Sorvino has affected in recent pictures is so at odds with her natural brunette beauty - that she in her own way appears to be tricked out for sale. We see strands of her Paris Hilton hairdo straggling out of her ICE cap as she pursues the bad guys. In order to keep this film from slipping dangerously close to being an exploitation of its sensationalism subject matter, it might have been better to cast a professional-looking woman working with her ICE colleagues as a true equal. After the horrors of Carlyle's sex trade, viewers need a place of relief and refuge - a place where we feel the values of proper human relations are being upheld.

But the revelation is Robert Carlyle, the Scottish star of The Full Monty and Trainspotting, who here is transformed into a ruthless criminal mastermind behind his own trafficking network. Even his Eastern European accent is spot-on and blood-chilling.The supporting cast of women and girls is strong, and in some cases, truly heartbreaking.

I swear, this film hit me so hard that at times I felt as if I would vomit. It is that heartbreaking, that deep. All of the stories are incredibly sad, but for me none more so than the poor little children sold into the sex trade (one shockingly by her own father) who were eleven and younger in the Phillipines. Oh my God, the tears poured from my eyes to watch those little babies being brutalized by those pigs and it literally hurts to watch it knowing that right now it's happening to many real children in the world. Any pig who can hurt anyone but especially a child deserves to go to hell before even Hitler and Stalin. This film will kill something inside of you, but you must watch it because IT'S REAL! This honestly (and probably in much worse ways) is going on right now in the world. I watched it with my kids who are preteen age so they know that evil does exist in the world and why they will not be walking to the bus stop alone. Honestly, after watching this you might not let your child out of your sight until he is 30. Others have complained about the lead actors; I found Donald Sutherland (much like my favourite Sutherland, Kiefer) to be dead-on and performed with the perfect intensity. Mira, whom I quite like, was pretty good except for the uncle rape backline. I thought (like many of the other reviewers) that it was a bit overkill, but this film doesn't belong to the stars, it belongs to those who played victims (especially the poor little children who I hope received theraphy after filming such a traumatic story) and the traffickers. They played the ultimate soulless, evil freaks and I hope that they received major props for bringing this important topic to life.

Here it specifically deals with the trafficking of young women from the Eastern bloc, former communist nations and also the sexual slavery of children in the Philippines. The series is well-done, the plot is compelling as we are inexorably drawn into the depraved world of the traffickers, a world driven by consumer demand for raw & young human flesh, and also the plight of the innocent women and children who are enslaved against their will, and broken down both mentally and physically. It is a very relevant show for such atrocities continue to rise unabated in today's world, and it is hoped that the series would not only shed light on the thriving human trafficking industry but also educate and mobilise people to action. The acting was top-notch, expecially by the actresses who portrayed the victims, and also Donald Sutherland as head of ICE. Mira Sorvino was okay in the role of the female undercover agent, but not thoroughly convincing.
