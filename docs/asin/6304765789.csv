435006,A3GM4AA744X74H,6304765789,777,"[9, 23]","Bad, bad movie. I give it an extra star for some wonderful stylistic touches by Fincher (the old home movie with the piano music in the beginning is absolutely wonderful), but the further into the movie you get,  the worse it is. What begins as a stylish and interesting film degenerates  into a lackluster adventure/mystery, with the entrance of Debra Unger's  character marking a turn for the worse. The dialogue suddenly becomes  trite, and the actions of the characters no longer seem believable, even in  the suspended context of the film's own reality. The stylistic moments  begin to seem out of place. And THEN, in the last half-hour ... lord ...  rarely have I seen such incompetant film-making. There are a lot of  &quot;surprising revelations,&quot; but most of them are not so much  surprising as they are forced-feeling, over-the-top, and just generally not  very clever. And the ending is absolutely God Awful. Unquestionably the  dumbest &quot;climax&quot; to a film I have ever seen. Aside from the fact  that you could poke about 2 billion holes in it, it's just aesthetically  stupid and dramatically unbelievable.

Is the message open and overt?  Or is themessage hidden and covert?And since so many films have messages and agendasand NEVER proclaim that fact but set about to influenceattitudes and values, anyway...it's rather refreshing,if not startling, to see a film which tells you upfront that it is &quot;up to something&quot; but then leaves itto you to figure out what it is up to.&quot;It is frustrating to me if you don't payattention.&quot;The lighting, clarity of imagery, and wholeatmosphere of this film are rich in color andsharpness...and tone.  The lighting and cameraangles...and quality of the image in many scenesare pure Kubrick...the outer hall in the buildingwhere CRS is located is &quot;2001&quot; style...but the barin Nicholas' club is right out of &quot;The Shining.&quot;The use of sound is significant and interlockingwith the visual imagery.  When Nicholas sets outhis birthday &quot;supper&quot; from the oven where Ilsahas left it...a sandwich, some fries, a chocolatecupcake with one small candle on it [how sad...how alone he is...]and he puts the wine glassdown on the tray...the sound reminded me ofthe clinking of the glass by Dave Bowman in the&quot;hotel room&quot; at the end of &quot;2001&quot; just before hedies...and is reborn...as the Star Child.&quot;What does it profit a man if he gain the wholeworld -- and yet loses his soul?&quot;&quot;Truly, truly, I say to you...unless one isborn again...&quot;  Does Nicholas die symbolicallyin this film?  Is he not even put in a casket?Is he reborn?  Is he transformed?  Is he dead tothe old self...the old life...that was him?  Doesit have the power to reclaim him with its illusionsand lures?&quot;No one has expressed an opinion about how it willaffect the pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton.&quot;&quot;What does that matter to a bloated fat-catmillionaire like you?&quot;And what is the t.v. commentator [Daniel Schorr]talking about...he is talking about the economy...and how some companies don't want to give healthinsurance to their employees...and how 59% of thepeople believe that they will lose their jobsin the next 5 to 7 years.  And what do we read inour nightly newspapers...or hear on t.v. ...ifit is not mostly economic news and how the marketis doing...and only a brief passing note thatsome company may have projected that it will notmeet its earnings during the next quarter soit is going to lay off 5,000 people worldwideto cut costs.  But do we hear anything of those5,000 people and what their fate is after theylose their jobs...what devastation or disruptionit is to their lives?  Or do we just getinterview after interview with CEO's andmoney managers trying to tell everyone how tobe successful and get rich?Part of the illusion of this film is if you getcaught up (particularly in the first viewing) intrying to make sense of the game...and trying tofigure out who is doing these things...and howthey are capable of pulling it all off so&quot;perfectly&quot; (as one reviewer commented) -- onlyGod could know if Nicholas would step the rightway or not...or jump the right distance or not.Perhaps the answer is that the game is notbeing administered by any human agents...butrather is an allegory for life itself...noone has life, in all of its aspects, undercontrol either...we might like to think thatwe do, like Nicholas...and some of the reviewerswho react so strongly and negatively to the filmhere.  Does the film disturb their own illusionsthat they have life under control...and that lifecould not be a threat to them either?  We haveprogrammed illusions of safety and &quot;meaning&quot; and&quot;purpose&quot; for life...most of them very worldlyand secular...but what happens when life startsgoing out of control?  When Nicholas returns tohis house and finds it vandalized...and that loudmusic of Jefferson Airplane singing about Alice[in Wonderland] ...or perhaps we should think ofthe &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;...what if that harmlesschildren's story full of violence and monstersand a supposed Wizard who &quot;has everything undercontrol&quot; is also a hidden allegory...what if theWizard is supposed to be a hidden stand-in forGod...and what if there is no real Wizard behindthe curtain?The problem comes here, of course, in that themessengers (the writers, directors, and producersof this film) suffer the taint of the message...for they are part of the system too.  They aremaking money, too.  Do they salve their consciencesby believing that they are doing a &quot;good work&quot; forthe salvation of their fellow man?And what of the ending of this film?  DoesNicholas survive?  Is the ending also a deceptionand an illusion?...what if Nicholas actually diesin the fall...and the rest is an &quot;after life&quot; ...or &quot;in flight&quot; fantasy...perhaps like &quot;Vertigo&quot;...did the detective really survive the fall fromthe building at the start of that film...or iseverything after that a &quot;death dream?&quot;  What ifthe transition between life...and death...isa transition to a different plane of existencewith no knowledge that one has actually died...but one is simply moving into another illusionof reality to replace the one that one has justleft?

It is all about HIS journey that will teach him many things about life itself. He went from being in control of everything  finances, safety, commodity, friendships, trust) from being a millionaire to being a no body, to be humbled , to feel hunger, to feel insecurity, to feel despair, to feel fear, to feel poor.

He , in actuality was 53 when he made this movie as he was born Michael Kirk Douglas on September 25th, 1944. Most movies are made a year before their theatrical release. So , let's say he was 52 to be fair. A 4 long years cry from 48 years old. I guess he could play the role of a 48 year old at 52 or 53 I guess. But , play a role closer to your age , which I guess whoever is reading this might think Michael is closer to that age & a majority , if not everyone will think that age is nothing , but a number. Those who think that must be really geriatrically old to say & think that. Great movie though , but why not have the movie set on Michael's character turning 52 or 53.

He is a marvelous storyteller and he understands how to mesh style with substance in remarkable ways.Sadly, `The Game' is easily his weakest effort.Really, `The Game' fails in areas outside of the direction, which is very well orchestrated despite the film's many limitations.  The tension is amicable and reminds me a lower end De Palma film actually; a little copy-cattish and not at all original but effective for the most part.  Michael Douglas is always adept to playing a self-absorbed business man, and he nails that side of character with ease, but he also grapples with the growing panic and eventual paranoia of his character very well.  I'll admit, I was impressed, especially since I consider Douglas an actor of minimal range.  The rest of the cast is slightly laughable.  James Rebhorn is awful here and Sean Penn, while utilizing his youthful charisma, is a tad overdone in some scenes (his paranoid breakdown lacks real conviction) and Deborah Kara Unger is about as convincing as a two-by-four.I'll say that the film's biggest asset is easily the production designers who really worked great angles at making this an entrenched thriller.  Those sets are outstanding.But really, the film's ultimate downfall is the ridiculous screenplay.  The film is just a preposterous mess, and while suspension of disbelief is best used in film's like this, the pure ridiculous of the plot itself it just irritating.  I thought that the initial concept seemed intriguing (the whole `hand someone a profound life experience in the form of a game they don't understand but have to play out') but the way in which the script fleshes itself is so full of plot holes and lapses in possibility that it is a complete mess.Skip this; it's dumb.",2,This game makes no sense...,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,1878,"['will', 'get', 'out', 'open', 'consider', 'David', 'Fincher', 'one', 'freshest', 'more', 'mature', 'voices', 'generation', 'film', 'directors', 'marvelous', 'storyteller', 'how', 'mesh', 'style', 'substance', 'remarkable', 'ways.Sadly', 'Game', 'easily', 'weakest', 'effort.Really', 'Game', 'fails', 'areas', 'direction', 'very', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'film', 'many', 'limitations', 'tension', 'amicable', 'lower', 'end', 'De', 'Palma', 'film', 'actually', 'little', 'copy-cattish', 'not', 'original', 'effective', 'most', 'part', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'always', 'adept', 'playing', 'self-absorbed', 'business', 'man', 'side', 'character', 'ease', 'also', 'growing', 'panic', 'eventual', 'paranoia', 'character', 'very', 'well', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'impressed', 'especially', 'consider', 'Douglas', 'actor', 'minimal', 'range', 'rest', 'cast', 'slightly', 'laughable', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'awful', 'here', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'utilizing', 'youthful', 'charisma', 'tad', 'overdone', 'scenes', 'paranoid', 'breakdown', 'lacks', 'real', 'conviction', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'as', 'convincing', 'two-by-four.I', ""'ll"", 'say', 'film', 'biggest', 'asset', 'easily', 'production', 'designers', 'who', 'really', 'worked', 'great', 'angles', 'making', 'entrenched', 'thriller', 'sets', 'are', 'outstanding.But', 'really', 'film', 'ultimate', 'downfall', 'ridiculous', 'screenplay', 'film', 'just', 'preposterous', 'mess', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'best', 'used', 'film', 'pure', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'just', 'irritating', 'thought', 'initial', 'concept', 'seemed', 'intriguing', 'whole', 'hand', 'someone', 'profound', 'life', 'experience', 'form', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'have', 'play', 'out', 'way', 'script', 'so', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'lapses', 'possibility', 'complete', 'mess.Skip', 'dumb']",N/A

Nicholas Van Orton (Douglas) seems to have everything together.  Everything, that is, except for a healthy social life.  Nicholas treats everyone very coldly and even his own family members aren't spared his wrath.  His brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), decides that he has found the perfect birthday gift for his uptight sibling.  He signs him up for a &quot;game&quot; run by Consumer Recreation Services.Of course, this is no ordinary game.  It is a game that takes place in real life.  There is no stated beginning or end to this game.  There are no apparent rules.  Since this is a thriller it would be best not to go into any plot twists.  However...this is one hell of a ride.  Deborah Kara Unger is fantastic as a waitress who gets caught up in the events.  I had never heard of her before this film and was extremely impressed with her performance in a complex role.There are a couple of things which help to make a really good thriller.  One is that you are truly surprised.  So many films in this genre have been made that it is hard to be surprised anymore.  &quot;The Game&quot; brings a freshness that I hadn't seen in quite a while.  You will be both entertained and kept guessing as to what could possibly happen next.  The sign of a GREAT thriller is one that you actually want to watch again even though you know the plot twists.  &quot;The Game&quot; falls into that limited category.

With an intensity which few films can rival, The Game quickly moves from one surprising scene to the next, always catching its audience off guard and creating a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat atmosphere. If you haven't seen The Game, you have no idea what you've been missing...Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an extremely wealthy San Francisco banker, living in an opulent estate just outside of the city. But Nicholas is not a happy man. He generally spends his time alone, the exception being when he spends time with his clients brokering lucrative business deals. Nicholas even spends his birthday alone, and on his forty-eighth birthday, Nicholas is forced to reflect on the fact that his father committed suicide at the same age.But this year, Nicholas's birthday takes an unexpected twist when his estranged younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn) arrives unannounced at the Van Orton estate. A former drug addict involved in all sorts of nefarious schemes in the past, Nicholas remains skeptical of the true reasons for his brother's return. However, Conrad soon manages to convince Nicholas that his only reason for returning is to give his lonely, boring brother a birthday present he'll never forget. What exactly is the gift?It's a very expensive entertainment package provided by a firm called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Curious as to what sort of entertainment they provide, Nicholas visits CRS where he undergoes a series of mental, physical, and psychological tests to make sure he can handle what they offer. In return, CRS agrees to customize the adventure of a lifetime for Nicholas - as they do for famous and wealthy executives all over the globe...But when strange things start to take place and those are followed by seemingly horrendous events, Nicholas must make use of his intellect and his instincts in order to survive. Afraid the events are part of a misguiding sense of humor on the part of the employees at CRS, Nicholas arrives at their office building prepared to cancel the entertainment package. But to his dismay, the office space is vacant and the landlord has never heard of CRS. Even worse, Nicholas finds out that every financial account he owns has been wiped clean and that a criminal organization has been pulling similar heists on wealthy industrialists all over the world. Uncertain of his future, Nicholas sets out to get to the bottom of the truth, and in doing so, he finds out the truth about himself...Far from a blockbuster commercial success when it was first released in 1997, The Game is an unknown entity among most casual movie watchers. As such, those who stumble upon The Game will be duly impressed with the quality of this cinematic gem. Featuring two show-stopping performances by Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, The Game is an instant fan favorite among those who've seen it.

Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","When watching &quot;The Game&quot; for the first time, one will be pleasantly surprised by the film's continuous twist and turns literally leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat. It's almost impossible to predict the outcome of this mystery/thriller, all the more so because of director David Fincher's penchant for draping his film with ominous shadows and uncomfortable flashbacks dealing with alienation and suicide. &quot;The Game&quot; does not feel like the kind of film headed anywhere near a comfortable resolution. And if one recalls Fincher's previous effort, the dark and thoroughly depressing &quot;Seven,&quot; you know he is a director uninhibited when it comes to detailing the demons which haunt his psyche.In &quot;The Game,&quot; rarely has the San Francisco locale seemed so dark and dreary. The rain-soaked streets, abandoned skyscrapers and lonely mansions are displayed in an almost gothic fashion, reminding one of the lonely fog-shrouded sets of early Hammer horror films. Drop into this desolate atmosphere the alienated and secluded protagonist played by Michael Douglas, and viewers find themselves in a most uncomfortable motion picture. The tension rarely lets up, as Sean Penn, who plays Douglas' kid brother, appears on the scene to offer a birthday present to his brother -- a game that will have a profound affect on his life.Douglas, out of boredom more than anything else, eventually visits the company which will offer &quot;The Game.&quot; He soon discovers that the private and lonely existence he has forged has been violated with eerie mannequin clowns appearing in his driveway and television sets talking to him rather than reporting the stocks. Soon, nothing is what it seems, not even his relationship with his brother, and Douglas finds himself hunted by mysterious men and answering phone calls that play back conversations he's had previously.Throw into this tumultuous mix a wise-cracking waitress (played with silky ease by Deborah Unger) who becomes Douglas' ally, and the viewer is in for a halloween-like rollercoaster ride complete with runaway taxi cabs, blazing machine guns and chases through lonely alley ways. All of this frantic activity eventually leads to the top of a downtown office building, where Douglas is confronted with a desperate choice -- either accept &quot;The Game&quot; as just that, or realize his life is truly in danger, protecting himself at all costs. His decision may not surprise the viewer, but the resolution absolutely will.I'm not sure why I enjoy &quot;The Game&quot; so much, having seen it multiple times. Douglas' performance is fine, if not a bit derivative of his past work. Penn seems to enjoy himself in what is essentially a thankless cameo role. Unger, who steals many of her scenes, is appealing though nothing to write home about.Perhaps what sets &quot;The Game&quot; apart is its atmosphere, undoubtedly fueled by Fincher. This is a director's film if ever there was one, complete with frantic pace, symbolic flashbacks, strategic camera angles and already-mentioned dark vision. While the over-the-top intensity of Fincher's better known efforts &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;The Fight Club&quot; is definitely in full bloom here, he does hold back just enough of those mischievous demons to make &quot;The Game&quot; his most mature and accessible effort. And thus, it is one of the finest works to date by one of the most interesting directors working today.",4,A Thought-Provoking Thriller,999388800,"09 2, 2001",2001,3466,"['When', 'watching', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'continuous', 'twist', 'literally', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'edge', 'seat', 'almost', 'impossible', 'predict', 'outcome', 'mystery/thriller', 'more', 'so', 'director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'penchant', 'draping', 'film', 'ominous', 'shadows', 'uncomfortable', 'flashbacks', 'dealing', 'alienation', 'suicide', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'not', 'feel', 'kind', 'film', 'headed', 'anywhere', 'comfortable', 'resolution', 'one', 'Fincher', 'previous', 'effort', 'dark', 'thoroughly', 'depressing', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'know', 'director', 'uninhibited', 'when', 'detailing', 'demons', 'haunt', 'psyche.In', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'rarely', 'San', 'Francisco', 'locale', 'seemed', 'so', 'dark', 'dreary', 'rain-soaked', 'streets', 'abandoned', 'skyscrapers', 'lonely', 'mansions', 'are', 'displayed', 'almost', 'gothic', 'fashion', 'reminding', 'one', 'lonely', 'fog-shrouded', 'sets', 'early', 'Hammer', 'horror', 'films', 'Drop', 'desolate', 'alienated', 'secluded', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'viewers', 'find', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'motion', 'picture', 'tension', 'rarely', 'up', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'Douglas', 'kid', 'brother', 'scene', 'offer', 'birthday', 'present', 'brother', 'game', 'will', 'have', 'profound', 'affect', 'life.Douglas', 'boredom', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'eventually', 'company', 'will', 'offer', 'quot', 'Game.', 'quot', 'soon', 'private', 'lonely', 'existence', 'forged', 'been', 'violated', 'eerie', 'mannequin', 'clowns', 'appearing', 'driveway', 'television', 'sets', 'talking', 'rather', 'reporting', 'stocks', 'Soon', 'nothing', 'what', 'not', 'even', 'relationship', 'brother', 'Douglas', 'hunted', 'mysterious', 'men', 'answering', 'phone', 'calls', 'play', 'back', 'conversations', 'had', 'previously.Throw', 'tumultuous', 'mix', 'wise-cracking', 'waitress', 'played', 'silky', 'ease', 'Deborah', 'Unger', 'who', 'Douglas', 'ally', 'viewer', 'halloween-like', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'complete', 'runaway', 'taxi', 'cabs', 'blazing', 'machine', 'guns', 'chases', 'lonely', 'alley', 'ways', 'frantic', 'activity', 'eventually', 'top', 'downtown', 'office', 'building', 'where', 'Douglas', 'confronted', 'desperate', 'choice', 'accept', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'just', 'realize', 'life', 'truly', 'danger', 'protecting', 'costs', 'decision', 'may', 'not', 'surprise', 'viewer', 'resolution', 'absolutely', 'will.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'so', 'much', 'having', 'seen', 'multiple', 'times', 'Douglas', 'performance', 'fine', 'not', 'bit', 'derivative', 'past', 'work', 'Penn', 'enjoy', 'what', 'essentially', 'thankless', 'cameo', 'role', 'Unger', 'who', 'steals', 'many', 'scenes', 'appealing', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'about.Perhaps', 'what', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'atmosphere', 'undoubtedly', 'fueled', 'Fincher', 'director', 'film', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'complete', 'frantic', 'pace', 'symbolic', 'flashbacks', 'strategic', 'camera', 'angles', 'already-mentioned', 'dark', 'vision', 'over-the-top', 'intensity', 'Fincher', 'better', 'known', 'efforts', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'definitely', 'full', 'bloom', 'here', 'hold', 'back', 'just', 'enough', 'mischievous', 'demons', 'make', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'most', 'mature', 'accessible', 'effort', 'thus', 'one', 'finest', 'works', 'date', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'directors', 'working', 'today']",N/A

Hanson,"[1, 1]","No, this isn't an autobiography on WWE star Triple H.This is ""The Game"" starring Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, an investment banker who apparently has forgotten, or never learned, how to be a kind human being. Mr. Van Orton is short, rude, and a pompous ass to every person he seems to come in contact with. His wealth and power have gone to his head in a big way.Then as a birthday gift, Nicholas' brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) gives him a present: a gift certificate to a company known as ""CRS"". Nicholas has no clue what he is in store for. When he eventually goes to CRS to fill out the forms and take the tests needed to get started, he is informed by cel phone during an important meeting that he has been rejected. But this is just a ruse, as from this point on, he is thrown into ""The Game"".Having to experience humility for probably the first time in his life, Nicholas finds himself in one catastrophe after another, and finds himself completely and totally out of his element as the events unfold in wicked fashion. In the end, he gets exactly what he deserves.I think we've all run into the Nicholas Van Ortons in the world at some point or another, and there's something satisfying about watching someone who believes to be above everybody and everything get knocked down to Earth.

THE GAME (thriller, 1997) On the day of his birthday millionaire businessman Nicholas (Michael Douglas) is visited by his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) with a gift. The gift involves Nicholas signing up for a  mysterious company which offers a `game', which in turn offers the  participants a series of surprises that ""provides whatever is lacking"" in  their lives. Though a rather pessimistic and somber individual Nicholas  accepts in the hopes of escaping the memory of a solitary childhood and  witnessing his father's suicide. When the surprises the `game' issues  become seriously deadly Nicholas wants out. But this particular game offers  no escape.Critique: Nerve-wracking, high wire act of a movie directed  with guile precision by David Fincher (`Seven', `Alien 3'). So far all of  David Fincher's films have been good which is rare for someone who has been  dubbed as a purely commercial director. The sort of tagline that is a  deathnail for anyone seeking true legitimacy in Hollywood. Michael Douglas  is good in the role of another heartless tycoon type character in the mold  of Gordon Gekko from `Wall Street'. Douglas gives the character just a  slight insidious turn and taking him into Twilight Zone territory. It's  also good seeing Sean Penn in a first rate mainstream movie for a change.  Film is made in such a way that every detail has to be dissected in order  to make a logical progression of events. Which otherwise would seem chaotic  and purely coincidental. Towards the climax it all makes perfect sense and  provides a most welcome escape ending. When the credits roll and you know  it is truly over it is strangely satisfying and disappointing.QUOTES:  Conrad: ""What do you get for the man who has everything?""",3,CULT MOVIES 57,923616000,"04 9, 1999",1999,1745,"['57', 'GAME', 'thriller', '1997', 'day', 'birthday', 'millionaire', 'businessman', 'Nicholas', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'visited', 'brother', 'Conrad', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'gift', 'gift', 'Nicholas', 'signing', 'up', 'mysterious', 'company', 'game', 'turn', 'participants', 'series', 'surprises', 'lacking', 'lives', 'rather', 'pessimistic', 'somber', 'individual', 'Nicholas', 'accepts', 'hopes', 'escaping', 'memory', 'solitary', 'childhood', 'witnessing', 'father', 'suicide', 'When', 'surprises', 'game', 'issues', 'become', 'seriously', 'deadly', 'Nicholas', 'out', 'particular', 'game', 'escape.Critique', 'Nerve-wracking', 'high', 'wire', 'act', 'movie', 'directed', 'guile', 'precision', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Seven', 'Alien', '3', 'So', 'far', 'David', 'Fincher', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'rare', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'dubbed', 'purely', 'commercial', 'director', 'sort', 'tagline', 'deathnail', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'true', 'legitimacy', 'Hollywood', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'good', 'role', 'heartless', 'tycoon', 'type', 'character', 'mold', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Douglas', 'character', 'just', 'slight', 'insidious', 'turn', 'taking', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'territory', 'also', 'good', 'seeing', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'first', 'rate', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'change', 'Film', 'made', 'such', 'way', 'detail', 'be', 'dissected', 'order', 'make', 'logical', 'progression', 'events', 'Which', 'otherwise', 'would', 'seem', 'chaotic', 'purely', 'coincidental', 'climax', 'perfect', 'sense', 'most', 'welcome', 'escape', 'ending', 'When', 'credits', 'roll', 'know', 'truly', 'strangely', 'satisfying', 'disappointing.QUOTES', 'Conrad', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'man', 'who', 'everything']",N/A
435046,A2QXCZK7CVLW0A,6304765789,C R Heath,"[9, 9]","I saw this movie when it first came out.  Upon first viewing, I enjoyed it for several qualities.  Director David Fincher provides a really creepy, eerie atmosphere to the story.  The cinematography has a dark, eerie look (as in Seven).  The music (such as the tinkering piano) has a way of creeping up on you.  Michael Douglas is terrific, as usual.  Towards the 2nd half however, I started to lose interest.  I found the story was just cranking on and on with no point.  By the end, I was dissappointed with the payoff.  I felt it didn't have to go on so long to explain it's point.  I guess this is the reason it didn't perform so well at the box office. The 2nd time I watched this was a different story.  Knowing in advance about the ending, I could pay more attention to the meaning of all of the scenes (I don't want to give too much away).  The early flashbacks are there to tell you what kind of unhappy, selfish, lonely person Douglas is like.  As the movie progresses, you begin to see him changing as he is going through the game.  This is the whole point of the story, not what is really going on.  By the time the payoff has come around, you are touched with what has occured.  The viewer is not really supposed to be surprised at the end, but emotionally moved. What I really would like to see someday is a DVD with Fincher's director's commentary.  This is such a complex movie where each scene needs to be explained.  I hope David Fincher does that someday (like the new Seven DVD). One minor note:  For those of you complaining about how far fetched the movie is, this movie is supposed to be unreal.  I could not believe one minute of it, but Fincher makes it clear he doesn't want you to believe in it.  The Game is part mystery, part fantasy (as in the Twilight Zone).",4,Has to be seen twice to appreciate it,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,1789,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'viewing', 'enjoyed', 'several', 'qualities', 'Director', 'David', 'Fincher', 'really', 'creepy', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'cinematography', 'dark', 'eerie', 'look', 'Seven', 'music', 'such', 'tinkering', 'piano', 'way', 'creeping', 'up', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'terrific', 'usual', '2nd', 'half', 'however', 'started', 'lose', 'interest', 'found', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'cranking', 'point', 'end', 'was', 'dissappointed', 'payoff', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'so', 'long', 'explain', 'point', 'guess', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'perform', 'so', 'well', 'box', 'office', '2nd', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'different', 'story', 'Knowing', 'advance', 'ending', 'could', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'meaning', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'early', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'there', 'tell', 'kind', 'unhappy', 'selfish', 'lonely', 'person', 'Douglas', 'like', 'movie', 'begin', 'see', 'changing', 'going', 'game', 'whole', 'point', 'story', 'not', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'time', 'payoff', 'come', 'are', 'touched', 'what', 'occured', 'viewer', 'not', 'really', 'supposed', 'be', 'surprised', 'end', 'emotionally', 'moved', 'What', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'someday', 'DVD', 'Fincher', 'director', 'commentary', 'such', 'complex', 'movie', 'where', 'scene', 'be', 'explained', 'hope', 'David', 'Fincher', 'someday', 'new', 'Seven', 'DVD', 'One', 'minor', 'note', 'complaining', 'how', 'far', 'fetched', 'movie', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'unreal', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'one', 'minute', 'Fincher', 'clear', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'Game', 'part', 'mystery', 'part', 'fantasy', 'Twilight', 'Zone']",N/A

435048,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,6304765789,C. Sawin,"[3, 4]","David Fincher has always had a loyal fan base. His films have been winning people over for twenty years with films like ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en"" developing a cult-like following. Criterion Collection's release of ""The Game"" feels like some lucky schmuck discovered diamonds in an abandoned coal mine. Now remastered with loads of special features, ""The Game"" continues Fincher's near flawless streak of impeccable filmmaking.Films that are capable of making you think and turning your brain inside out are personal favorites; ""Inception,"" ""Oldboy,"" ""The Machinist,"" and ""Fight Club"" are spectacular examples. ""The Game"" can be categorized right along with the best of them. Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a successful investment banker complete with Swiss bank accounts, fancy cars, and a huge house; Nicholas has it all. But he was noticeably unhappy and the death of his father from when he was a boy still haunts him.On his 48th birthday, his ex-wife Elizabeth (Anna Katarina) along with all of his co-workers and his maid Ilsa (Carroll Baker) wish him a happy birthday but Nicholas views it as just another day. That is until his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) introduces him to CRS - Consumer Recreational Services. Shrouded in secrecy, Nicholas has no idea what to expect. Little does he realize that his life is about to be on the line along with his fortune.The choreography in this psychological thriller is brilliant. It helps establish the rich atmosphere of the film whether it's the fluorescent hum of office building lighting, the slow rotating shots as Nicholas eats his birthday dinner in his home, or the incredible break-in sequence filled with graffiti that's infused by black lighting. Just like all of Fincher's work, it pulls you in so easily. The story is constantly engaging. It's nearly impossible to predict how far this game is going to go and at what lengths Nicholas will go to discover the truth.The performances are fantastically solid. Michael Douglas does an excellent job of portraying a man who once had everything and basically has nothing by the end of the film. While Sean Penn has a small amount of screen time, his performance is different every time he shows up; calm and collected, frantic and borderline insane, and eventually the understanding brother. It's also worth paying particular attention to Deborah Kara Unger because it's so difficult to determine just whose side the Christine character is on.Well-written, expertly paced, and undeniably riveting, ""The Game"" is perhaps most impressive in the way it strips down the Nicholas Van Orton character. The whole process is very layered and each layer breaks down Nicholas even more than the last. Never seeing the film beforehand certainly helped, but Criterion Collection's release of ""The Game"" is definitely a must own.The Criterion Collection director-approved special edition Blu-ray includes a new, restored digital transfer, supervised by director of photography Harris Savides with original theatrical 5.1 surround soundtrack and presented in DTS-HD Master Audio, Alternate 5.1 surround mix optimized for home theater viewing, supervised by sound designer Ren Klyce and presented in DTS-HD Master Audio, Audio Commentary by director David Fincher, actor Michael Douglas,

His character in The Game is strikingly similar to Gordon Gecco, except the dissimilarity of the Game's Orton is that instead of truly enjoying the merits of massive money monkey malarchy, he seems only interested in attaining more of it at the cost of no personal life whatsoever.Douglas is again, his usual thriller great self. We see him at the true zenith of perfection in his attempts to discover the secrets of the corporation that set forth this intriguing but upsetting game which seems to be much more than the simplicity originally implied.Oh sure, we expect something special in his brother's gift, but we certainly dont expect to be so far on the edge of our seat that we are getting cramps in our butts just trying to stay there.What I truly loved about this movie is my own lack of ability to come to a true answer as to what was really going on. So often, it is within my and other's nature to try and be smart and figure out the intended ending, only to be found right and then slightly disappointed that the writer and director didn't go past our expectations. Not so with The Game. Game takes you so deep into this man's downward spiral while ""playing"" this deceptive game, figuring out it's true intent becomes second nature. By the end, your nerves are so shatterred from the journey, you feel like you've been right there with Van Orton experiencing every nuance of the events in reality yourself.

I guessed until the last scene and was engrossed and excited for the whole thing.I had this film on DVD for a while. It was the United States release which had no features whatsoever, it wasn't even formatted for widescreen TVs (the anamorphic image was shrunk down to fit inside a 4:3 ratio).

Meanwhile, each new film would come out on a DVD that was not only packed with special features, but had amazing packaging too. I love the care and treatment Fincher's films get from beginning to being in the hands of a consumer. (The only exception being Se7en which took a while to come out in a special 2-disc edition, having me wait even after Fight Club was released).But even then... The Game DVD remained for me a not only boring but frustrating DVD experience without any features, with a boring, ugly case. Finally, Criterion came through and released a spectacular DVD.Commentary, 1-hour making of video comprised of several locations, each with optional commentary, storyboard to film comparison, teaser trailer and trailer with optional commentary, a booklet and a fantastic design for the case artwork. My ONLY issue with the casing is that the two DVDs sit atop one another. If you want to watch Disc 2, you have to take out Disc 1 to do so. Kind of a bummer having to remove both discs, especially for me who likes to keep a DVD in it's case as much as possible if I'm not watching it to avoid any scratches.Still though, so glad to have this DVD, even if Criterion decided to have a 50% off sale after I ordered it (boo!) But I'd pay almost any price for it. Because I love Fincher. I love The Game and I love the care Criterion put into their releases.",5,5 Stars for both film and Criterion DVD Edition,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,2108,"['Reviewing', 'Criterion', 'version', 'film', 'David', 'Fincher', 'favorite', 'director', 'Aside', 'first', 'two', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'order', 'release', 'film', 'strengthen', 'admiration', 'work', 'Game', 'would', 'have', 'been', '2nd', '3rd', 'film', 'saw', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'guessed', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'engrossed', 'excited', 'whole', 'thing.I', 'had', 'film', 'DVD', 'while', 'was', 'United', 'States', 'release', 'had', 'features', 'whatsoever', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'formatted', 'widescreen', 'TVs', 'anamorphic', 'image', 'was', 'shrunk', 'down', 'fit', '4:3', 'ratio', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'laserdisc', 'player', 'Criterion', 'laserdisc', 'did', 'have', 'all-region', 'player', 'get', 'DVD', 'least', 'had', 'commentary', 'Meanwhile', 'new', 'film', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'packed', 'special', 'features', 'had', 'amazing', 'packaging', 'too', 'love', 'care', 'treatment', 'Fincher', 'films', 'get', 'beginning', 'being', 'hands', 'consumer', 'only', 'exception', 'being', 'Se7en', 'took', 'while', 'come', 'out', 'special', '2-disc', 'edition', 'having', 'wait', 'even', 'Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'released', '.But', 'even', 'then', 'Game', 'DVD', 'remained', 'not', 'only', 'boring', 'frustrating', 'DVD', 'experience', 'features', 'boring', 'ugly', 'case', 'Finally', 'Criterion', 'came', 'released', 'spectacular', 'DVD.Commentary', '1-hour', 'making', 'video', 'comprised', 'several', 'locations', 'optional', 'commentary', 'storyboard', 'film', 'comparison', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'optional', 'commentary', 'booklet', 'fantastic', 'design', 'case', 'artwork', 'ONLY', 'issue', 'casing', 'two', 'DVDs', 'sit', 'atop', 'one', 'want', 'watch', 'Disc', '2', 'have', 'take', 'out', 'Disc', '1', 'do', 'so', 'Kind', 'bummer', 'having', 'remove', 'discs', 'especially', 'who', 'keep', 'DVD', 'case', 'as', 'much', 'possible', ""'m"", 'not', 'watching', 'avoid', 'scratches.Still', 'so', 'glad', 'have', 'DVD', 'even', 'Criterion', 'decided', 'have', '50', '%', 'sale', 'ordered', 'boo', ""'d"", 'pay', 'almost', 'price', 'love', 'Fincher', 'love', 'Game', 'love', 'care', 'Criterion', 'put', 'releases']",N/A

Douglas of course seems to enjoy playing a seemingly unlikeable character in both films but in ""The Game"" he finds himself in a web of contradictions.

Except for power and money, Van Orton has little else: no wife, no children and no life outside of the banking business. For his 48th birthday, Van Orton's brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) buys him a ticket to ""The Game."" The game is a fictional attempt to destroy Van Orton's secure life of power and affluence. The adventure begins with Van Orton the multi-millionaire, and ends with Van Orton the pauper. ""The Game"" forces Van Orton to doubt and confuse fact with fiction, the real from the unreal. The viewer also faces the same dilemma constantly guessing whether he's watching a game or a real scenario.""The Game"" reminds me of John Fowles' novel ""The Magus,"" except that the movie lacks magic and mysticism. The object of ""The Game"" (like ""The Magus"") is to force the involuntary pawn (Van Orton) to experience a catharsis; that is, to change from a callous and uncaring individual, to one of humane endeavors and compassion. The movie is partially successful. Van Orton is certainly ""changed"" by the game, but I doubt that he gives his millions to charity, and lives a life pursuing causes more noble than the buck.""The Game"" is filled with adventure, drama, intrigue and ""sitting on the edge of the seat"" scenes, but it's hardly plausible.

It's a mile-a-minute barrel ride over the edge of a waterfall, with the audience left in the dark right alongside the protagonist. Young director David Fincher plays up the suspense gorgeously, but isn't quite able to compensate for a few inherent flaws with the premise. First and foremost is Douglas's leading part, a thoroughly unlikeable one-percenter who's such a Scrooge it's impossible to grow too invested in his fate. In a way it's cathartic to see him tormented by such a brutal series of twists and turns, especially in the afterglow of the Wall Street bailout, but the film goes out of its way to paint him as a sort of tragic hero. The plot's reckless yanks on the steering wheel, too, aren't all they're cracked up to be. Those constant swerves provide a great series of unpredictable thrills, but ultimately ring hollow when our suspension of disbelief is nudged too far beyond the coincidental.

435068,A1C3HJ00AVPQ87,6304765789,E. Nickel,"[0, 0]","It's hard to review David Fincher's psychological thriller The Game without running the risk of giving away the twists and turns in this tense thriller. Let's backtrack a moment and consider Fincher's previous film, the harrowing Se7en. Though he had directed Alien 3 in 1992, 1995's Se7en upped the ante in the dread department. Though a great film in its own right, Se7en was, in a certain sense, a working out of ideas that came to fruition in The Game. And though Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman acquitted themselves very well in Se7en, Michael Douglas delivers a tour de force performance in The Game. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine anyone else soaking that character with as much self-loathing, guilt, arrogance and hostility. Douglas had already demonstrated his acting chops with Wall Street and Falling Down, so it's no great surprise that he was able to stand his ground against Fincher's twisting and shocking plot turns. And this plot sneaks up on you, subtle in the beginning then delivering massive blows to your emotions and sense of equilibrium. It's a testament to Douglas and Sean Penn's acting chops that they make this wild ride not only seem plausible but suffocatingly real. The first time I watched the film I remember grabbing my chair, all white knuckles at more than one point, gripped by Douglas' hallucinogenic ride. When a friend asked me what other films I'd seen that reminded me of this I couldn't honestly say. This was simply a brilliant one-off by Fincher and Douglas and a film that surprisingly, given that it relies on plot twists the viewer can't see coming, reveals subtle pleasures in repeat viewings.",5,One of a Kind Thriller,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1644,"['hard', 'review', 'David', 'Fincher', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Game', 'running', 'risk', 'giving', 'away', 'twists', 'tense', 'thriller', 'Let', 'backtrack', 'moment', 'consider', 'Fincher', 'previous', 'film', 'harrowing', 'Se7en', 'had', 'directed', 'Alien', '3', '1992', '1995', 'Se7en', 'upped', 'ante', 'dread', 'department', 'great', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'Se7en', 'was', 'certain', 'sense', 'working', 'ideas', 'came', 'fruition', 'Game', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'acquitted', 'very', 'well', 'Se7en', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Game', 'retrospect', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'soaking', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'self-loathing', 'guilt', 'arrogance', 'hostility', 'Douglas', 'had', 'already', 'demonstrated', 'acting', 'chops', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Falling', 'Down', 'great', 'surprise', 'was', 'able', 'stand', 'ground', 'Fincher', 'twisting', 'shocking', 'plot', 'turns', 'plot', 'up', 'subtle', 'beginning', 'then', 'delivering', 'massive', 'blows', 'emotions', 'sense', 'equilibrium', 'testament', 'Douglas', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'acting', 'chops', 'make', 'wild', 'ride', 'not', 'only', 'seem', 'plausible', 'suffocatingly', 'real', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'remember', 'grabbing', 'chair', 'white', 'knuckles', 'more', 'one', 'point', 'gripped', 'Douglas', 'hallucinogenic', 'ride', 'When', 'friend', 'asked', 'what', 'other', 'films', ""'d"", 'seen', 'reminded', 'could', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'one-off', 'Fincher', 'Douglas', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'given', 'plot', 'twists', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'reveals', 'subtle', 'pleasures', 'repeat', 'viewings']",N/A

The movie is about a frustrated banker that is remembering his father's suicide because it's going to be his 48th birthday and on his father 48th birthday, he had committed suicide. But when his younger brother gives him a very mysterious gift to play ""the game"", everything goes awry. The game has no rules and he doesn't know who he can trust. That's all I'll say so that I don't give away any spoilers. The movie develops perfectly and the acting is great by Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. The movie also develops thanks to many creepy elements. The flashback of the father's suicide is well made and everything in this movie clicks right.

It's well acted, and it will keep you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what the ending will be. The main character may even resemble someone you know. Nicholas (played by Michael Douglas) is sort of a boring but rich, middle-aged man who feels himself to be superior to his wild and less stable brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn). As a birthday gift, Conrad gets Nicholas a chance to play ""The Game"", in hopes that it will change Nicholas's life for the better.Throughout the film, you are taken on a suspenseful and rather violent adventure. When you reach the end, however, you find out the twist, and it is rather disappointing considering all the blood, sweat, and tears Nicholas had to go through to play the ""game"". I understand that Conrad was hoping the ""game"" would enrich his brother, but he could have done that without threatening the safety of his life. Sure, this is just a movie, so it's okay that the ending is unrealistic given everything that happened, but the movie still takes itself seriously in communicating that sometimes people need thrills to positively change their life. But frankly, I don't see how that would work if the thrills end your life rather than change it.

I watched it a couple of years back when I still did not an HDMI hookup and I used the three-wire, component-video alternative. My set (a Samsung) easily expanded the non-anamorphic image to fill out my 56-inch screen, and so THAT time it was a pleasure to watch, in spite of the loss of resolution with that kind of low-tech letterboxing.However, I recently watched it again (or, rather, tried to watch it), this time with a full HDMI connection from my player. Guess what? My Samsung TV actually LOSES some of its image-expansion and shaping abilities with the HDMI feed, and so the best I could do with the movie was watch it with the 4:3 setting, which delivered a reduced-size wide-screen image in the middle of the TV screen.What this movie needs (and perhaps later versions have it) is a true anamorphic squeeze, so that not only do we get more resolution with the image ""un-squeezed,"" but also so that my Samsung TV's more high-tech image expansion feature with the HDMI hookup will work properly.The version I have is too retro-tech, in spite of the THX certification, to operate to best effect with an HDMI link - at least with my set.

435104,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,6304765789,Keith Mirenberg,"[4, 5]","THE GAME is another wonderful Michael Douglas film and I rate it at 5 stars. This film will really be appreciated by fans that enjoy dissecting a complex plot. The story, although hard to swallow and farfetched, was exceptionally engaging and kept my interest from start to finish. I thought on my first viewing that this film would have a sequel, but was proven wrong by events.THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COULD RUIN ENJOYMENT OF THE PLOT:Nicholas Van Orton played by Michael Douglas is a wealthy banker, but a loner who even spends his birthday away from people. In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide and on the verge of classic mid-life crisis) his distant brother gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving in to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird things start to happen to him. Prior to admitting him to participate he is required to take a series of mental and physical tests which were apparently run to determine his strengths, weaknesses, and perhaps map out some sort of efficient ""game plan"" tailored just for him. One statement I remember CRS telling him is that if you don't go to THE GAME, it will come to you.He receives a phone call telling him that he failed the tests and is rejected by the organization. He forgets about CRS, but then overhears several people talking about ""the game"" and what life-changing opportunities it provides. He notices several such ""loud"" conversations in public, and goes to the trouble of introducing himself and speaking with a couple of apparently new members of his private club. All they will tell him is they wish they were just starting ""the game"" and one man quotes the bible saying ""where I was once blind I now can see"". Once he is certain he has actually been admitted to THE GAME, he tries to return to the offices of CRS where he received his tests, only to find that no signs of their facilities remain and for all effects, this organization never even ""existed"".This initially ""mild"" form of harassment (i.e., being misinformed of his membership status, having drinks spilled on him in restaurants, strange people banging into him, folks behaving very strangely in rest rooms and other public places, empty toilets overflowing, his attach&eacute; case jamming at important business meetings, the pen CRS told him to keep leaking on his shirt, individuals collapsing in the street at his feet, etc.), gradually transitions to increasingly overt and often potentially life-threatening experiences which slowly work on his mental condition. All the more strange is the fact that he is provided the means of barely escaping his next experience by receiving an item or remembering a fact he learned during a prior event.  Some examples of these increasingly life threatening events include: his estate being broken into and ransacked, being stranded in a darkened elevator, his cab driver driving his CRS taxi into the river almost drowning him, large crowds of people disappearing in a coordinated way from public places, being drugged, attacked by hooded gun men emerging from a large van marked Cable Repair Services, abducted and ultimately waking up in a crypt and stranded without cash, credit cards or passport in Mexico).The mental harassment is designed at first to merely embarrass or make uncomfortable, mildly inconvenience, then to be serious and painful, and after enough repetition and conditioning for him to associate these strange events, to effectively torture and eventually drive insane. Since almost every detail is staged redundantly there are no correct decisions left for him to make, and no avoiding the sequence of painful situations. He is ultimately like a caged animal walking wall to wall in a classic avoidance-avoidance conflict leading to insanity.  The issue of the cost-effectiveness of this game plan is something the film never addresses, but we are too engrossed to think about this during the movie.One thing is certain, these people do not want to publicly kill him or leave any permanent record of injury due to anything other than a random event. The purpose of THE GAME seems not to be simple murder, but to professionally destroy, discredit and cause a very gradual physical and mental breakdown which will result in his being either jailed because of acting out displaced aggressions, hospitalized or institutionalized where he can ""die"" or be subjected to something while well out of public scrutiny.In his former professional life he could certainly have made enemies, and what better means could they use to destroy him with impunity? While his financial and mental conditions still enable him to investigate CRS, he believes he acquires ""evidence"" that one of the office workers at CRS was a hired professional actor, more likely to have been provided by Actors Equity than some private detective or intelligence agency (CIA?). As the story unfolds this evidence was probably ""fed"" to him as part of the plot which is just full of strange twists and complications, all leading him no place.His entire personality changes as he undergoes transformation from a strong business-world predator to the cowering subject of physical and mental harassment. It is sad but interesting to watch his gradual disintegration as forces outside of his control consume him. The ending was a bit strange and is the reason I thought there would be a sequel.IF THE ABOVE MATERIAL CAN RUIN THE ENDING THE FOLLOWING IS WORSE:The film can only be said to have a rediculous ending when Van Orton confronts his brother who he now believes is in on the game plan on the roof of the CRS building.  At the end of the story after Van Orton believes he has shot his brother he actually jumps off the roof of the high rise CRS building intent on suicide because of his grief.  He is surprised to learn after smashing through the break away glass of a fake skylight, that he safely lands on a huge airbag carefully placed to break his tremendous fall.  He then sees his resurrected brother and all the other people dressed up in black tie to celebrate his birthday.  It was, after all, just a ""harmless"" gag.At the end of the story there are no hard feelings and all gracious smiles as he is presented with the check for the elaborate hoaxes that CRS has staged for his ""entertainment"". Even though he has probably aged over 30 years as a result of continuous mental trauma in just a number of days, he goes from table to table thanking the guests for making it a very special party. He even asks out the very beautiful and treacherous lady who slipped him a mickey during the ordeal. Well, the film was too entertaining for that very weak and silly ending to ruin it, but it did erode what I thought was (up until then) a very well done and thought out thriller.",5,"THE GAME-This

Looking back, though, I now know that this beginning helps us to more fully understand how boring and awful Nicholas' life is, and further provides an excellent contrast with what happens later in the movie.Nicholas is in a very upscale restaurant when a waitress (Deborah Unger as Christine) spills wine on his shirt.  Christine is fired by the restaurant manager and leaves, very upset.  Before you can say white rabbit, a waiter rushes by Nicholas' table and drops off a note that tells Nicholas' to follow the girl.  Prepare for the roller coaster ride.Within moments Nicholas finds himself involved with an apparently dying man, then just as quickly he finds he is being chased by the police, and police dogs, and things just get worse and worse.  The list of things to which Nicholas is subjected is too long and would leave you with no surprises.Nicholas tries to figure out how to make all the action and events to which he is being subjected stop.  Nicholas can't handle the loss of control.  Further, the chaos of his experiences seems to follow no pattern or order.  Eventually Nicholas gets back to where he thinks it all began for a showdown with the characters that he has discovered are actors.  The ending had me stunned and amazed.  You'll have to watch for yourself.There are several lapses in credibility, but unless you are an obsessive control freak (sort of like Nicholas Van Orton, for instance) you'll likely consider the lapses minor.  This movie ultimately is an intelligent thriller that relies on action only when necessary to heighten Nicholas' fears and to pull him deeper into what begins to seem like a deeply nefarious conspiracy.  After watching, this movie became one of my favorites, and I've now seen it several times.The most difficult part of this movie is the relatively slow first part.  However, have patience; what you learn in the first part helps you to understand Nicholas and to be drawn more fully into his situation.  Sympathy with Nicholas and his situation is highly desirable to fully appreciate the end of the movie.  I was sympathetic, and enjoyed this movie.  5 stars for an intelligent thriller that relies on intelligent plot versus guns, fast cars and special effects.",5,Intelligent Thriller,1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,2768,"['What', 'when', 'are', 'powerful', 'multi-millionaire', 'have', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'might', 'think', 'situation', 'highly', 'desirable', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'very', 'boring', 'fact', 'might', 'say', 'Nicholas', 'miserable', 'However', 'Nicholas', 'brother', 'Conrad', 'Van', 'Orton', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'bought', 'Nicholas', 'gift', '48th', 'birthday', 'invitation', 'play', 'Game', '.From', 'point', 'forward', 'movie', 'what', 'forever', 'was', 'beginning', 'regret', 'watching', 'movie', 'Looking', 'back', 'now', 'know', 'beginning', 'more', 'fully', 'understand', 'how', 'boring', 'awful', 'Nicholas', 'life', 'further', 'excellent', 'contrast', 'what', 'later', 'movie.Nicholas', 'very', 'upscale', 'restaurant', 'when', 'waitress', 'Deborah', 'Unger', 'Christine', 'wine', 'shirt', 'Christine', 'fired', 'restaurant', 'manager', 'leaves', 'very', 'upset', 'can', 'say', 'white', 'rabbit', 'waiter', 'rushes', 'Nicholas', 'table', 'off', 'note', 'Nicholas', 'follow', 'girl', 'Prepare', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride.Within', 'moments', 'Nicholas', 'involved', 'apparently', 'dying', 'man', 'then', 'just', 'quickly', 'being', 'chased', 'police', 'police', 'dogs', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'worse', 'worse', 'list', 'things', 'Nicholas', 'subjected', 'too', 'long', 'would', 'leave', 'surprises.Nicholas', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'action', 'events', 'being', 'subjected', 'stop', 'Nicholas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'loss', 'control', 'Further', 'chaos', 'experiences', 'follow', 'pattern', 'order', 'Eventually', 'Nicholas', 'back', 'where', 'began', 'showdown', 'characters', 'discovered', 'are', 'actors', 'ending', 'had', 'stunned', 'amazed', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'yourself.There', 'are', 'several', 'lapses', 'credibility', 'are', 'obsessive', 'control', 'freak', 'sort', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'instance', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'consider', 'lapses', 'minor', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'action', 'only', 'when', 'necessary', 'heighten', 'Nicholas', 'fears', 'pull', 'deeper', 'what', 'seem', 'deeply', 'nefarious', 'conspiracy', 'watching', 'movie', 'became', 'one', 'favorites', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'several', 'most', 'difficult', 'part', 'movie', 'relatively', 'slow', 'first', 'part', 'However', 'have', 'patience', 'what', 'learn', 'first', 'part', 'understand', 'Nicholas', 'be', 'drawn', 'more', 'fully', 'situation', 'Sympathy', 'Nicholas', 'situation', 'highly', 'desirable', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'enjoyed', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'intelligent', 'plot', 'versus', 'guns', 'fast', 'cars', 'special', 'effects']",N/A

Divorced and living alone in his magnificent San Francisco mansion, Nicolas is enduring yet another birthday (his 48th, the same age his father was when he committed suicide) when he receives an unexpected visit from his younger brother, Conrad (a gleefully-going-for-broke Sean Penn), the black sheep of the family with a history of drug use. Conrad looks good, though, and he comes bearing an unusual birthday gift: a game.What follows is a chaotic, uncertain series of events that could be anything: social terrorism, a massive con, financial sabotage, or the world's most elaborate mind game. Run by a company called Consumer Recreation Services (or CRS), the game ends up infecting every aspect of Nicolas's life, from chance encounters with homeless men to the guy who reads the evening news. Nicolas's mind and life fray ever further as he struggles to figure out just what is going on. He is given an 800 number at the start of the game and told, ""Do not call asking for the object of the game. Figuring that out is the object of the game.""Others have argued about plotholes in the script -- the game is unbelievably complex in both its planning and execution, and it relies on events adhering to a finely-tuned sense of timing and place -- but these concerns are dealt with deftly by the dialogue if you're paying attention. Ultimately, the point of the film -- what it takes to re-engage with life (let's just say it costs someone an exorbitant amount of money and someone else an exorbitant amount of pain) -- is so beautifully managed by Fincher's meticulous directing that whatever questions you might have about the reality of it all take a backseat to the intricate and masterful psychology of the whole thing. Maybe the point is that -- like the Bible says -- it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter heaven, even if heaven is just another word for whatever joy there is to find in life, be it family, friends, or love.Enjoy the ride, then watch it and enjoy it again. Each viewing, for me, reveals even more attention to detail and continues to be -- as it was when I first saw it -- a rewarding experience. Even still, as one character says, ""I wish I could go back and do it again for the first time."" I can't do that with this film, but the message of the movie is that even when life feels like it has been lived to the end, maybe -- no matter how outrageous the cost -- there is a way to go back and start it over again.Film Buff Factoid: Pay close attention to the end of the film for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo by Spike Jonze.",5,The Very Definition of a Psychological Thriller,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2838,"['Michael', 'Douglas', 'one', 'best', 'jobs', 'career', 'playing', 'wealthy-but-jaded', 'investment', 'banker', 'Nicolas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'man', 'who', 'secretary', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'society', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pleasure', 'avoiding', 'Divorced', 'living', 'alone', 'magnificent', 'San', 'Francisco', 'mansion', 'Nicolas', 'enduring', 'yet', 'birthday', '48th', 'same', 'age', 'father', 'was', 'when', 'committed', 'suicide', 'when', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'younger', 'brother', 'Conrad', 'gleefully-going-for-broke', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'history', 'drug', 'use', 'Conrad', 'good', 'bearing', 'unusual', 'birthday', 'gift', 'game.What', 'chaotic', 'uncertain', 'series', 'events', 'could', 'be', 'anything', 'social', 'terrorism', 'massive', 'con', 'financial', 'sabotage', 'world', 'most', 'elaborate', 'mind', 'game', 'Run', 'company', 'called', 'Consumer', 'Recreation', 'Services', 'CRS', 'game', 'up', 'infecting', 'aspect', 'Nicolas', 'life', 'chance', 'encounters', 'homeless', 'men', 'guy', 'who', 'evening', 'news', 'Nicolas', 'mind', 'life', 'fray', 'ever', 'further', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'given', '800', 'number', 'start', 'game', 'told', 'Do', 'not', 'call', 'asking', 'object', 'game', 'Figuring', 'out', 'object', 'game', 'Others', 'have', 'argued', 'plotholes', 'script', 'game', 'unbelievably', 'complex', 'planning', 'execution', 'events', 'adhering', 'finely-tuned', 'sense', 'timing', 'place', 'concerns', 'are', 'dealt', 'deftly', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'paying', 'attention', 'Ultimately', 'point', 'film', 'what', 're-engage', 'life', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'someone', 'exorbitant', 'amount', 'money', 'someone', 'else', 'exorbitant', 'amount', 'pain', 'so', 'beautifully', 'managed', 'Fincher', 'meticulous', 'directing', 'questions', 'might', 'have', 'reality', 'take', 'backseat', 'intricate', 'masterful', 'psychology', 'whole', 'thing', 'Maybe', 'point', 'Bible', 'easier', 'camel', 'enter', 'eye', 'needle', 'rich', 'man', 'enter', 'heaven', 'even', 'heaven', 'just', 'word', 'joy', 'find', 'life', 'be', 'family', 'friends', 'love.Enjoy', 'ride', 'then', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'again', 'viewing', 'reveals', 'even', 'more', 'attention', 'detail', 'be', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'Even', 'still', 'one', 'character', 'wish', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'do', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'message', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'life', 'feels', 'been', 'lived', 'end', 'maybe', 'matter', 'how', 'outrageous', 'cost', 'way', 'go', 'back', 'start', 'over', 'again.Film', 'Buff', 'Factoid', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'end', 'film', ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"", 'cameo', 'Spike', 'Jonze']",N/A

Nicholas is cold; lonely; bearing a lot of anguish over the suicide of his father, the seeming failure of his brother (Sean Penn in a rather small role, almost overacting, but tolerable).  What in this movie is real and what is a game?  The use of news commentator Daniel Schorr to set the rules for Douglas is very good, and unique.  Deborah Kara Unger fills the role of Christine nicely, although sometimes she seems in a vague fog.  Peter Donat as Douglas' lawyer is sturdy; James Rebhorn as the smarmy employee of CRS is also good.The movie rests on Douglas' shoulders and thought it may be a combination of his other roles, he still does a commendable job in carrying the movie.  It is bizarre, nightmarish, ominous and a director's triumph.

435127,APN6DO7VHDLTN,6304765789,Missing Person,"[1, 1]","Directed by David Fincher, 1997's ""The Game"" is a very cleverly constructed and engaging thriller, although the implausibility of the whole 'game' leaves one with such a ""give me a break"" taste in their mouth that it simply can't be hailed as a masterpiece.Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an incredibly wealthy investment banker who seems to be incredibly miserable, partly because of the daily grind of his work, and also because he's divorced and basically lives alone. His brother Conrad (Sean Penn) is seemingly aware of this, and in attempt to 'spice things up' for Nick, tells him about a suspicious company he should call named CRS, i.e. Consumer Recreation Services. Conrad tells his brother he's called them before and that they gave him a life changing experience in his own right. Nick ultimately gives in to temptation, not really knowing what he's getting into, and before he knows it, the 'game' begins.On the positive side, the mostly dark cinematography of the movie is extremely fitting and effective, and with the construction of the script being as engagingly clever as it is, we don't get the first real inkling as to just how impossibly far-fetched it all is until about  of the way into this 2+ hour film. And the movie's 'big climax' IS suspenseful and surprising, albeit ultimately outrageous, and the final scene amusingly provides one last macabre twist.The film is also a tour-de-force for Michael Douglas, who appears in every single scene.  It really is intriguing to watch a painstakingly maintained control freak have the proverbial rugs pulled out from under him at every turn, and Douglas is perfect for the role--intense, yet natural, and capturing the various emotions of his character masterfully.  Deborah Kara Unger's performance is also memorable--Douglas and she have an excellent on-screen chemistry.  Sean Penn, on the other hand, strikes me as being considerably miscast, but he doesn't have that much screen time anyway.In the end, this is a better-than-average thriller. It's highly entertaining despite its extreme implausibility and the rather underwhelming & laughable ending.",4,"an intriguing film, and definitely a nail-biter despite the implausibility",1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2132,"['Directed', 'David', 'Fincher', '1997', 'Game', 'very', 'cleverly', 'constructed', 'engaging', 'thriller', 'implausibility', 'whole', ""'game"", 'one', 'give', 'break', 'taste', 'mouth', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'hailed', 'masterpiece.Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'incredibly', 'wealthy', 'investment', 'banker', 'who', 'be', 'incredibly', 'miserable', 'partly', 'daily', 'grind', 'work', 'also', 'divorced', 'basically', 'alone', 'brother', 'Conrad', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'seemingly', 'aware', 'attempt', ""'spice"", 'things', 'up', 'Nick', 'suspicious', 'company', 'should', 'call', 'named', 'CRS', 'i.e', 'Consumer', 'Recreation', 'Services', 'Conrad', 'brother', 'called', 'gave', 'life', 'changing', 'experience', 'own', 'right', 'Nick', 'ultimately', 'temptation', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'getting', ""'game"", 'positive', 'side', 'mostly', 'dark', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'extremely', 'fitting', 'effective', 'construction', 'script', 'being', 'engagingly', 'clever', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'real', 'inkling', 'just', 'how', 'impossibly', 'far-fetched', 'way', '2+', 'hour', 'film', 'movie', ""'big"", 'climax', 'IS', 'suspenseful', 'surprising', 'ultimately', 'outrageous', 'final', 'scene', 'amusingly', 'one', 'last', 'macabre', 'twist.The', 'film', 'also', 'tour-de-force', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'who', 'single', 'scene', 'really', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'painstakingly', 'maintained', 'control', 'freak', 'have', 'proverbial', 'rugs', 'pulled', 'out', 'turn', 'Douglas', 'perfect', 'role', 'intense', 'yet', 'natural', 'capturing', 'various', 'emotions', 'character', 'masterfully', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'performance', 'also', 'memorable', 'Douglas', 'have', 'excellent', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'other', 'hand', 'strikes', 'being', 'considerably', 'miscast', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'end', 'better-than-average', 'thriller', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'extreme', 'implausibility', 'rather', 'underwhelming', 'laughable', 'ending']",N/A

Unfortunately, he is also extremely lonely, because he has no one to share it with. Nicholas is turning 48, and his strange and eccentric brother Conrad ( Sean Penn)wants to give Nicholas the perfect gift for his birthday. Conrad gives him an invitation to a company called Consumer Recreation Services, that specializes in creating games that are designed specifically for the participant. Unable to resist, Nicholas decides to go through with it. However, soon after Nicholas signs up, very strange and horrible things start to happen to him, which leads Nicholas to believe that the game he is involved in, will have him playing for his life.&quot;The Game&quot; is without a doubt one of the most thrilling and suspenseful films I have ever seen. I was literally drawn into the film from beginning to end. Nothing is what it seems in this film. The end is perhaps the film's best feature because it is completely unpredictable. There are so many twists and turns, that the movie may appear confusing at times. But if you are willing to give the concentration and patience that is needed, watching The Game can be a very rewarding experience. Michael Douglas is an amazing actor, and it shows in this film. You legitimately come to feel for his character, because of how well he portrays the character breaking down. Watching Michael Douglas's character lose control of his life is frightening and somewhat amusing as well. Sean Penn, Deborah Unger, and the rest of the cast all do a great job as well.Overall, &quot;The Game&quot; is probably one of the best psychological thrillers ever made. The film is unpredictable and suspenseful from beginning to end, and the performances given from Michael Douglas and company could not have been better. My only advice with this film is that you be willing to pay attention and concentrate on what is going on.

So I was one of the few that actually caught it in the theatre and actually loved it.  (One of the few films that lives up to a great trailer).So for the HD version.  I have to agree with most of the BAD HD reviews.  This is a total ""embarrassment"" on the part of Universal for releasing such an obviously, un-remastered version of it in HD.  You actually can tell there is a slight difference on a 56"" HD screen but for smaller TV's, I can imagine there is almost no gain at all in quality over the standard dvd (which was an earlier generation transfer to begin with).  This is such a shame because this film along with a lot of Fincher's other ""dark"" (actual film quality vs. content) films deserve better treatment.  Do not waste your money thinking it will look better because it's on HD-DVD.  We'll have to wait for it to get remastered which does not look good at this point.  I doubt Universal will follow Sony's suit in remastering, like the fifth element after bad bluray reviews.  Universal chose HD-DVD because it's cheaper to produce so they probably won't listen to consumer's reviews on horrible transfers.

The film is a mash-up between Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" and Philip K. Dick's ""Total Recall.""

He's very wealthy, probably in the top 1/2%, let alone 1%.He's also very lonely and seemingly unhappy.  As a surprise, his gadfly, devil-may-care younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) shows up and gives him a gift certificate for his 48th birthday.  It requires Nicholas  to show up for a series of interviews which allows a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) to design a ""game"" for him.  You know, it's for the man who has everything.When Nick gets a phone call advising him CRS won't be able to work with him, he thinks nothing of it.  What he doesn't know is that the game has just begun.  Like Douglas Quaid in ""Total Recall,"" Nick isn't quite sure what is going on.  He is put in physical, financial and mental danger.  The film is beautifully shot and has surprise after surprise.  Eventually Nick and the rest of us catch on.But what is real and what is part of the game, is sometimes hard to discern.  The story tends to jump-the-shark in the final act which left me shaking my head.

This great thriller is one of the better films by David Fincher (SEVEN wins the best) and Criterion has treated us to the best this dark movie has ever looked!

The first being the awesome Laserdisc from Criterion and the last on a horrible looking HD-DVD. I am glad I took the risk and upgraded to the Criterion blu ray. This is one fabulous looking visual feast. The detail in the dark picture is unbelievable. Have always been unable to see what is going on. Not anymore. I don't know how Criterion did it, but you can see in the darkness without the blacks looking gray. And they tweaked the color where the Polygram DVD looked golden colored. Just make sure you watch this in a dimly lit room because most of this movie is dark. It is presented in its original 2.35 Super 35 widescreen format. With two soundtracks in DTS-HD. The ""newest"" being an alternate 5.1 optimized for home theater. Looks like most of the special features are carried over from Criterion's Laserdisc (like the commentary), except for this fantastic looking transfer and this wonderful newer soundtrack.

What he is lacking is the access to the sacred and to his true Self. CRS is there to help, courtesy of his brother Conrad (Penn). But Van Orton will have to get rid of all that he previously stood for and accept to lose himself in the unknown. While some viewers have objected to the film's outrageous events and progression, this is precisely what draws me to it: its willingness to dispense with 'believable' developments makes Van Orton's quest all the more powerful. The movie could have been subtitled 'The initiation of a millionaire', because Van Orton undergoes numerous archetypal trials: he is stuck in a car underwater (in the belly of the monster); he is buried alive; his descensus ad infernos is such that he (literally) has to make a death-defying jump in a garbage dump; he has to find his way through mazes and use secret keys; most scenes take place in darkness.

Although the story is well crafted with plenty of mystery, this is the sort of film you can only see once because the mystery is completely resolved in the end and leaves no surprises.Michael Douglas is a wealthy executive whose life is plagued by the vivid memories of his father's suicide.  The tragedy has left him a control freak whose relations with his family and friends are strained at best.  His brother (Sean Penn) invites him to play an undefined game offered by Consumer Recreation Services, a service firm. Michael Douglas' character soon finds himself entangled in a bizzare criminal scheme that he cannot fathom.  How will he get out of this nightmare?Again, this is a great suspense-thriller to watch only once.

The setup of the movie is superb as we're given vague clues about what The Game actually entails and if it will even play a role in the main character's life.

The ""game"" is organized by a company called ""Consumer Recreation Services"", who make your life more ""FUN"".This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. The reason is that the things which happen to Van Orton (the banker played by Michael Douglas) have happened to me as well - in some way or another. Perhaps they have happened to you too. For example, you visit some company, and at your next visit - the company is gone. Or sometimes, you may experience that someone is draining your bank account without your knowledge. Or, a waitress splashes food and drinks on your suit.I definitely recommend this movie, because it is captivating to watch. For example, the house in which the banker Van Orton lives, is large and luxurious. It is nice to imagine yourself in the interior of this house. The ""waitress"" than ruins the banker's suit is very beautiful. I would say that Michael Douglas definitely has a taste for luxirious living and beautiful women - this shows in most of his movies.

Nichola's estranged ne'er-do-well brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) presents a birthday gift to 48-year-old Nicholas -- a paid membership to The Game.The Game is a chaotic intervention -- Murphy's Law applied proactively.  Suddenly Nicholas' controlling lifestyle is flooded with annoyances and emergencies including embarrassing restaurant accidents, police encounters, questionable meetings in hotel rooms, armed mercenaries and a taxi ride off a pier into San Francisco Bay.  Friends and associates become suspect as The Game drives Nicholas towards financial and personal ruin.Michael Douglas portrays powerful men well and his performance is excellent.  And &quot;The Game&quot; portrays chaotic ruination effectively.  But the 1997 plot of &quot;The Game&quot; is not original.  Dan Ackroyd's film &quot;Trading Places&quot; included a comedic rendition of The Game.  And the television series &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; starring Peter Graves, Martin Land au and Greg Morris had a similar theme -- use chaos to weaken and destroy targeted individuals.  IMO the similarity between &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; suggests an interesting speculation: 'How did the Mission Impossible team stay sharp between Government missions?'",4,We Provide Whatever's Lacking ...,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,1410,"['quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'stars', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'wealthy', 'San', 'Francisco', 'investment', 'banker', 'staidly', 'running', 'financial', 'empire', 'Nichola', 'estranged', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'brother', 'Conrad', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'birthday', 'gift', '48-year-old', 'Nicholas', 'paid', 'membership', 'Game.The', 'Game', 'chaotic', 'intervention', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'applied', 'proactively', 'Suddenly', 'Nicholas', 'controlling', 'lifestyle', 'flooded', 'annoyances', 'emergencies', 'including', 'embarrassing', 'restaurant', 'accidents', 'police', 'encounters', 'questionable', 'meetings', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'armed', 'mercenaries', 'taxi', 'ride', 'pier', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'Friends', 'become', 'suspect', 'Game', 'Nicholas', 'towards', 'financial', 'personal', 'ruin.Michael', 'Douglas', 'powerful', 'men', 'well', 'performance', 'excellent', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'chaotic', 'ruination', 'effectively', '1997', 'plot', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'not', 'original', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'film', 'quot', 'Trading', 'Places', 'quot', 'included', 'comedic', 'rendition', 'Game', 'television', 'series', 'quot', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'quot', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Martin', 'Land', 'au', 'Greg', 'Morris', 'had', 'similar', 'theme', 'use', 'chaos', 'weaken', 'destroy', 'targeted', 'individuals', 'IMO', 'similarity', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'quot', 'interesting', 'speculation', 'did', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'team', 'stay', 'sharp', 'Government', 'missions']",N/A

Both films tell the tale of wealthy but bored men who feel dead inside, they don't feel like they belong or have any connection with anyone. Both men decide that they need a life changing experience to shake them out of their apathy and get them to start living again. In the case of the Game that lost man is Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) a multimillionaire who oversees a publishing company. On his forty eight birthday he gets a mysterious gift from his younger and irresponsible brother Conrad (Sean Penn). The gift is actually a gift card to a shadowy company called CRS and Nicholas has his reservations. He happens upon their headquarters by chance and is subjected to a barrage of mental and physical tests before he is even accepted. One of my favorite character actors James Rebhorn plays the man behind CRS Dr. Feingold. All Feingold will tell an inquisitive Nicholas is "" Admit to yourself that it sounds interesting. We provide what is lacking in your life."" Soon Nicholas's game begins and he finds his life in danger almost immediately. This film which could also be a sort of precursor to the Saw films as well has no graphic violence the torture is all psychological. Nicholas is haunted by the memory of his father who killed himself on Nicholas's birthday over thirty years ago and the fact that he was Nicholas's age when he did it weighs heavy on his mind. He wonders how much of his father is in him. Conrad who has battled drug addiction will only tell Nicholas that he too has played the Game and that he has never felt better. "" They make your life fun again."" is what he tells his younger brother. Nicholas does get some help in the form of Kathleen (Deborah Kara Unger) a waitress he meets along the way and who may know more about the Game than she lets on to Nicholas. The film has a fantastic ominous mood enhanced by the cinematography of Harris Savides and especially a jangling piano score from Howard Shore. To reveal too much of what happens to Nicholas during his Game would take away from several scenes that play like a nightmare. I loved the acting and the feel of the film but had a problem with the ending. I didn't find it completely believable and a little too convenient. Still the film is very good and Douglas in the lead does an amazing job as he slowly begins to unravel. His whole world is turned upside down in the course of this film and his realization at the ending while not entirely believable is still well acted throughout.

And now I'm even more depressed about the last five minutes of Fight Club, because to a one, all of Fincher's other films are purely fantastic from beginning to end.The Game follows Nicholas van Orton (Michael Douglas) through the eight days following his forty-eighth birthday. Van Orton's father committed suicide on his forty-eighth birthday, so Nicholas' deadbeat brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), decides to get him a really bang-up birthday present: a game from a shadowy company that's tailored to each player. All well and good, but after a day or so, Nicholas is starting to wonder whether it's a game at all, and exactly how far these people will go to protect their identities and create the fantasy world into which they're pushing Nicholas.Fincher's trademarks are all here&#8212;darkness, claustrophobia, quick camera cuts, little tricks that heighten the suspense for the viewer and allow him to identify a little better with the character the movie is following. It's wonderful stuff, aside from one little nagging out-of-character piece (Michael Douglas' character really is a complete jerk, and one wonders why he'd have ever agreed to get involved with The Game in the first place), but by the end of the film, that particular question is lost in the dust that the rest of the movie manages to kick up. It's not on the same reality-jarring level as Se7en was; more along the lines of Fincher's earlier contribution to the Alien series: a whole lot of fun, a great way to kill two and a half hours, and a movie that kind of manages to leave you feeling both good and slightly nauseated at the end.

435161,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,6304765789,Robert J. Schneider,"[4, 5]","Less than a full year before A PERFECT MURDER (1998) was released, Michael Douglas starred in THE GAME (1997), which is not simply a Michael Douglas movie, it's a David Fincher film-and you know what that means!  From a screenplay by John D. Brancato &amp; Michael Ferris, THE GAME is classic Fincher: dark, mysterious and with a constant sense of brooding danger in which lets you know that somehow, somewhere, something is not quite kosher.In THE GAME, Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton; a man of great wealth and power and totally devoid of any human compassion (as evidenced by the cold and callous way in which he fires a longtime employee).  If this sounds like Gordon Gekko to you, it's because Michael Douglas, at this stage in his career, plays cold callousness like no one else.  Call it typecasting; I call it brilliant acting ability and being smart enough to stick with what works.  However, Gordon Gekko in the legendary Oliver Stone-directed WALL STREET (1987) didn't have a younger brother; Nicholas Van Orton does.  On Nick's 48th birthday (the same age at which his father died, hint hint), his black-sheep-of-the-family brother Conrad, as brilliantly played by Sean Penn, visits him in his sprawling, cherry-wood office and hands his older sibling his birthday present: a business card with the name Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) on it.  &quot;What is this,&quot; Nicholas cynically asks.  The sly answer given by Penn is one of my favorite lines in the film, and one that tells us that his elder bro's life will never be the same, once he begins to play THE GAME.Along the way, Nicholas Van Orton encounters CRS and its primary spokesman (or so he thinks) Jim Feingold (played with disarming confidence by character actor James Rebhorn), a mouthy cocktail waitress (Deborah Kara Unger) who seems to hold the secret to THE GAME, and a spooky-looking full-size inanimate clown who appears to watch everything he does.  Also along the way are near-brushes with death that culminate with Conrad Van Orton's tearful admission that he &quot;didn't know what the $#@! he had gotten them into&quot; when he had signed his brother up for THE GAME. But that's still just the beginning...Everyone is superbly cast in this film, including BABY DOLL (1956) herself, Carroll Baker, and the always-watchable Armin Mueller-Stahl.  But the real star here is David Fincher; he is so adept at guiding us down a labyrinthic path of which only he knows the end, that all we can do is hang on and enjoy the rollercoaster ride on which he breathlessly takes us.  He primarily relies on small, subtle signs of foreboding to generate suspense, as opposed to full-blown violence and gore.  Although this is one of those films that relies on first-time viewers' lack of knowledge of what to expect, and thusly loses something on repeated viewings, it is still a very good film to re-visit on occasion, if only to experience Fincher's unique style (this film and A PERFECT MURDER are miles apart in this respect, believe me), Douglas and Penn's acting and the production values, which are first-rate.See and experience THE GAME for yourself.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",4,Gordon Gekko gets his comeuppance--big time!!!,1067299200,"10 28, 2003",2003,3152,"['Less', 'full', 'year', 'A', 'PERFECT', 'MURDER', '1998', 'was', 'released', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'starred', 'THE', 'GAME', '1997', 'not', 'simply', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'movie', 'David', 'Fincher', 'film-and', 'know', 'what', 'screenplay', 'John', 'D.', 'Brancato', 'amp', 'Michael', 'Ferris', 'THE', 'GAME', 'classic', 'Fincher', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'constant', 'sense', 'brooding', 'danger', 'know', 'somehow', 'somewhere', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'kosher.In', 'THE', 'GAME', 'Douglas', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'man', 'great', 'wealth', 'power', 'totally', 'devoid', 'human', 'compassion', 'evidenced', 'cold', 'callous', 'way', 'longtime', 'employee', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'stage', 'career', 'cold', 'callousness', 'one', 'else', 'Call', 'typecasting', 'call', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'ability', 'being', 'smart', 'enough', 'stick', 'what', 'However', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'legendary', 'Oliver', 'Stone-directed', 'WALL', 'STREET', '1987', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'younger', 'brother', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'Nick', '48th', 'birthday', 'same', 'age', 'father', 'died', 'hint', 'hint', 'black-sheep-of-the-family', 'brother', 'Conrad', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'sprawling', 'cherry-wood', 'office', 'older', 'sibling', 'birthday', 'present', 'business', 'card', 'name', 'Consumer', 'Recreation', 'Services', 'CRS', 'quot', 'What', 'quot', 'Nicholas', 'cynically', 'sly', 'given', 'Penn', 'one', 'favorite', 'lines', 'film', 'one', 'elder', 'bro', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'once', 'play', 'THE', 'GAME.Along', 'way', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'CRS', 'primary', 'spokesman', 'so', 'Jim', 'Feingold', 'played', 'disarming', 'confidence', 'character', 'actor', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'mouthy', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'who', 'hold', 'secret', 'GAME', 'spooky-looking', 'full-size', 'inanimate', 'clown', 'who', 'watch', 'everything', 'Also', 'way', 'are', 'near-brushes', 'death', 'culminate', 'Conrad', 'Van', 'Orton', 'tearful', 'admission', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', '@', 'had', 'gotten', 'quot', 'when', 'had', 'signed', 'brother', 'up', 'THE', 'GAME', 'still', 'just', 'beginning', 'Everyone', 'superbly', 'cast', 'film', 'including', 'BABY', 'DOLL', '1956', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'always-watchable', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'David', 'Fincher', 'so', 'adept', 'guiding', 'down', 'labyrinthic', 'path', 'only', 'end', 'can', 'do', 'hang', 'enjoy', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'breathlessly', 'primarily', 'small', 'subtle', 'signs', 'foreboding', 'generate', 'suspense', 'opposed', 'full-blown', 'violence', 'gore', 'one', 'films', 'first-time', 'viewers', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'what', 'expect', 'thusly', 'something', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 're-visit', 'occasion', 'only', 'experience', 'Fincher', 'unique', 'style', 'film', 'A', 'PERFECT', 'MURDER', 'are', 'miles', 'apart', 'respect', 'believe', 'Douglas', 'Penn', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first-rate.See', 'experience', 'THE', 'GAME', 'yourself.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

On the other hand, 'Game' is well acted and scripted and held my attention from the beginning to the end.  The Michael Douglas character--a highly successful and [to me] rather unlikeable millionaire --volunteers to play a real-life 'game' the rules and nature of which he doesn't understand.  He is told by his brother and others that 'The Game' and its results, will really jazz up his constrained life.  The implication, of course, is that his life will be 'improved.''The Game' involves multiple harrowing adventures bound to increase the paranoia titer in any normal human being.  Implicit in the film, is that the Douglas-character's survival is always under close control of the Gramers.  I don't see it that way.  There are multiple incidents in which Douglas' behavior--and survival--is largely controlled by chance rather than the gamers.  Add them up and Douglas should die or be physically destroyed not once, but multiple times.In a sense, however, this is fairly typical of Action-Adventure films.  The final unlikelihood is that Douglas' life will be 'improved' by a succession of horrific events that could easily unmask a hidden psychosis, bare minimum.  It is definitely difficult to understand how such events could improve anyone's life.More realistically, Douglas is obliged to pay real dollars for 'fun' that would necessarily have cost millions.

His troubled brother Conrad (Sean Penn) offers him as birthday present, a chance to play the `Game' on offer from an outfit calling itself `Consumer Recreation Services'. Intrigued but so far not very impressed, Van Orton visits the CRS offices and is subjected to several hours of psychometric testing. Then odd stuff starts to happen. A toy clown turns up in front of his house with a key in its mouth. A newsreader on TV breaks off reading the news and engages him in conversation. A man collapes in the street and when Van Orton helps he is taken along in the ambulance to..., well, somewhere quite frightening that is certainly not a hospital.This is the movie David Fincher made in between `Seven' and `Fight Club'. Like `Fight Club' it's a very interesting movie that fails to live up to the promise suggested by `Seven'. In fact it is like `Fight Club' in other ways too. Like `Fight Club' it starts out well, with a really interesting first half. Here we are set up with a delightfully intriguing mystery: here is Van Orton caught up in this utterly baffling nightmare; what on earth is going on? Are these guys out to destroy him? If so why? And why go about it in such a perversely elaborate way? And if not, what on earth are they doing? But, exactly as with `Fight Club' a really satisfying first half is followed by a really silly second half. The movie just tries to be too clever, and slowly starts to disappear up its own backside. Then, having got us all excited with a lovely intriguing mystery, it cops out with the most feeble and unconvincing of denouements.

435176,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,6304765789,Steffan Piper,"[1, 1]","Now apply heat to the canvas ...Some of the best storytelling, historically, starts off with a quick preface of sorts that gives some foreshadow or insight into something that's going to unfold in front of you in a very insidious way. Most of the time, the majority of observers and readers never see any of it coming. And that's always the point of it, too.In the case of `The Game', I think it's safe to say now that no one saw any of it coming and there was nothing predictable about what David Fincher was trying to pull off. Those that say something to the contrary are probably lying to save face. Those folks might also tell you that they saw Bruce Willis being dead in `The Six Sense', too. Don't get mad if I spoiled it for you with either film, it's been over a decade for both - you should've seen it.So what kind of a mind would even think to envision something as dark as CRS and all that follows? Fincher pulls out all the stops and beats the viewer with a stick from the first moment to the very end.  And to his credit and not detriment, either.  Fascination with the Godon Gecko archetype is about as timely now as any other time in history. I can see this film making a comeback of sorts either on cable or as a touchstone, with perhaps even a follow-up production to come.The question is: ""What binds us together?"" -- Money? Reputation? Class division? Gold-plated lifestyle? Family? Love? Death? Apathy? It's a very simple question that leads us down a dark road to a very complicated answer with Sean Penn screaming at us in frustration. It's almost like a dream, or a nightmare depending on how you see the world. The idea of tinkering with a person's framework of mortality and whittling away at it slowly is enough to send the most hardened minds into a state of panic. Dead parents, suicide, invasion of privacy, paranoia, blackmail, embezzlement and so on. Watching the master of controlled emotions have his most epiphanic meltdown may be one of the great silver screen performances of all time, just because the emotions are so well documented. Peel away everything, at your expense, and let's see what's left is really the knock-out blow.Every time I watch this film with someone, I always catch folks wiping their eyes because of the ending. This kind of emotional response is normal with this film and be prepared for several of them throughout. Critics often say the ending is cheap and creates problems with the storyline, but they're just upset at being forced into an emotional state.The film opened during dark days and was derailed during its scheduled release because of the death of Princess Diana. Anyone with a subscription to the Los Angeles Times archives can go back and read the articles that covered the demise of the film, which was well-documented.The film slipped through the theatres almost unnoticed and then vanished. The buzz was minimal but it did leave a lasting impression. I would bet more folks saw it on cable than anywhere else. People then talked about the idea of the film as something very novel and very original. IMDb message boards are full of requests from viewers to list other films that are like it. The lists are short. But several people through the millennia since have noted that John Fowles book `The Magus' is the unofficial originator. Having read the book, I don't believe it is, but there are similarities for sure and it's a very worthy and forgotten read to say the least.Masterpiece of film? Yeah. Overlooked? Yeah.

Conrad is the wayward brother of control-freak Nicholas (Michael Douglas), a wealthy and aloof San Francisco investment banker whose 48th birthday is coming up.Conrad finally decides on a unique birthday present: a gift certificate to ""Consumer Recreation Services"" (or ""CRS"").  The service provided by CRS is a game.A friend of Nicks who has already ""played"" the game gives him a hint of what it's about by quoting a passage from the Bible:""Whereas once I was blind, now I can see.""Once Nick officially signs up for the game a series of bad and bizarre things begin happening to him, things beyond his control and things designed to make him lose his high status.There is actually a double climatic ending that, in my case, I found emotionally satisfying.Michael Douglas does a good job of portraying the aloof investment banker whose life has suddenly spun out of control.  Sean Penn who only appears in a few scenes makes the best of his limited screen time.The background music enhanced each scene.  This movie was also well photographed.There are two major problems I found with this movie:First, it is far-fetched.  This is supposed to be a game where everything is controlled.  However, some of the things that happen to Nick are totally uncontrollable.Second, the movie is much to long.  Because of its long length, it became tedious for me to watch.

His roguish kid brother Conrad (Sean Penn) promises a fabulous 48th birthday present which might just bust him out: an invitation to play a mysterious game offered by Consumer Recreation Services, a company dedicated to entertaining the top end of town. Nicholas's life promptly disintegrates. Is it all part of the elaborate game, or has he become embroiled in something far more sinister?  ""The Game"" not only plays with contemporary paranoia about upper-class, white-collar vulnerability to scams - it also neatly subverts audience expectations. By putting us in precisely the same position as Nicholas, the film doesn't let us solve the mystery before he does. Though Act 2 of the screenplay wanders, it's easily the best work yet from John Brancato and Michael Ferris (the team who also penned the hideous ""The Net""), and David Fincher elevates it enormously with his slick shooting style and trademark noirish unease.  Douglas is great as the tormented conservative, harried into reclaiming his life, and Penn does wonders with his small but crucial role.

435182,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,6304765789,Strawgold,"[0, 0]","Here is my take on an older movie that already has over 200 reviews - I have seen it twice because it is worthy of that acknowledgment:Nicholas Van Orton lives a cold, sterile life, haunted by the suicide of his father which has indelibly marked him as a child who witnessed it - he can't get it out of his mind.His birthday is coming up, another one of them he doesn't see any use for.  Everyone wishes him well, from a distance, because that is what is required of anyone who knows him.  His estranged little brother, Conrad, the exact opposite of himself in personality, but who also had personal issues he had to deal with, calls him, posing as an old friend, Seymore Butts - because he obviously thinks that's the only way the invitation will be accepted since his social standing has suffered in comparison with his successful, distant older brother - requesting his presence at dinner.  This does draw a sort of smile from the cast iron face of Nicholas, and he sets it up through his secretary.  A painful dinner conversation ensues, and the roguish little brother presents Nicholas with a gift - a gift certificate to play a reality game, although nothing is known or revealed about it.  He thinks it's a bunch of hooey, but it's paid for, so he decides what the heck.Things happen rapidly from there on and it is best to not reveal the plot, mainly because it's impossible.  But there is a message if one wants to look for it through the fray.My Summary:  It was an action flick with an embedded message:  Life is what you make it and you need to live it while it is in front of you rather than using crutches or casting blame for things you cannot control.  That may be easier said than done but the concept is a truth.  You don't need drugs, alcohol or psychiatrists because real life is a trip of it's own if you have the nerve to go for it - no excuses, and the devil take the hindmost.  But you DO need to live it and enjoy it;  you DO need love and your own people around you or the whole thing is for nothing.

""How could they do that?"" or ""How could they know Nicholas would do that?"" are fair questions, although not essential and not helpful. I don't know if the director is trying to claim our lives, even for a sophisticated person such as Nicholas, are so predictable.

435189,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,6304765789,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[1, 2]","Director:  David FincherCast:  Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn, Peter Donat, Carroll Baker, Anna Katarina, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Charles Martinet.Running Time:  128 minutesRated R for language, and for some violence and sexuality.Michael Douglas is on reliably good form as Nicholas Van Orton, a millionaire investment banker who lives in stately, joyless, isolated splendour in the mansion he inherited from his millionaire father. His father, Nicholas Van Orton Sr., died at 48 by hurling himself off the mansion's roof. Now having reached 48 himself, Nick, the man who has everything, is given an intriguing birthday gift by his rebellious younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn, sadly under-utilized here): an invitation to participate in a 'game' staged by the mysterious Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Their games involve the individual participant in a seemingly real-life scenario which blurs the edges between fact and fantasy, and which is deliberately tailored to suit each participant's personality. Reluctantly Nick signs up, as much out of boredom as anything else. It seems that for CRS, Nick's highly charged but emotionally austere and control-freakish personality calls for a high octane adventure in which he risks losing all control of events, and will thus be forced to depend on others for his physical, if not his psychological, salvation. And so the game begins.  Nick soon comes to doubt that he is playing any kind of game. Has he instead become the latest victim of a monumentally sophisticated scam? Or is it all a bad dream? Throughout this is all very gripping, and being a David Fincher (""Seven"") film it has a dark atmospheric gloss which keeps you unpleasantly hooked; however, as the plot unfolds like a Chinese puzzle, the film gradually reveals itself to be pure surface. Despite Douglas essaying yet another hard-nosed anti-heroic establishment outsider with characteristic intensity, there is only an intermittent sense that Nick is in psychological rather than physical danger, even though this, underlined by the constant home-movie flashbacks to Van Orton Senior's demise, seems to be what's actually at stake. The lack of psychological menace in the film hinges on the fact that no other character in the film is properly developed, so no one really seems to carry any real threat. Perhaps the real threat to Nick is within himself, his own demons, which somehow the game is intended to help him exorcize. But it's questionable that this is what we actually see portrayed.The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since ""Wall Street"". Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitress (or is she a waitress?), while Sean Penn is quite good at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy little brother. The script has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight ""black comedy"" feel. As usual in a Fincher film, the cinematography is dark and forebodding and creates a noir atmosphere of sorts. Howard Shore's music is excellent: Instead of attacking us with bombastic chords, a sound as simple as a piano tinkling is used to make our hearts race. The plotting is ingenious and one plot twist after another is instigated until the film creates a spider-web of fear and paranoia that has us mind-boggled. The films themes of redemption and paranoia are followed through right to the end in an ending that some think is supremely contrived.  Despite its pretentious packaging, the constant hints that we are watching a dark psychological thriller, a morality tale, 'The Game' turns out to be merely a well-executed action adventure that plays on the audience's paranoid fantasies, and it is to this end that Nicholas Van Orton seems ultimately to have been created by the film-makers.",3,The Game  (1997),1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,3790,"['Director', 'David', 'FincherCast', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'Peter', 'Donat', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Anna', 'Katarina', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'Charles', 'Martinet.Running', 'Time', '128', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'language', 'violence', 'sexuality.Michael', 'Douglas', 'reliably', 'good', 'form', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'millionaire', 'investment', 'banker', 'who', 'stately', 'joyless', 'isolated', 'splendour', 'mansion', 'inherited', 'millionaire', 'father', 'father', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'Sr.', 'died', '48', 'hurling', 'mansion', 'roof', 'Now', 'having', 'reached', '48', 'Nick', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'given', 'intriguing', 'birthday', 'gift', 'rebellious', 'younger', 'brother', 'Conrad', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'sadly', 'under-utilized', 'here', 'invitation', 'participate', ""'game"", 'staged', 'mysterious', 'Consumer', 'Recreation', 'Services', 'CRS', 'games', 'involve', 'individual', 'participant', 'seemingly', 'real-life', 'scenario', 'edges', 'fact', 'fantasy', 'deliberately', 'tailored', 'suit', 'participant', 'personality', 'Reluctantly', 'Nick', 'signs', 'up', 'much', 'boredom', 'anything', 'else', 'CRS', 'Nick', 'highly', 'charged', 'emotionally', 'austere', 'control-freakish', 'personality', 'high', 'octane', 'adventure', 'losing', 'control', 'events', 'will', 'thus', 'be', 'forced', 'depend', 'others', 'physical', 'not', 'psychological', 'salvation', 'so', 'game', 'Nick', 'soon', 'doubt', 'playing', 'kind', 'game', 'instead', 'become', 'latest', 'victim', 'monumentally', 'sophisticated', 'scam', 'bad', 'dream', 'very', 'gripping', 'being', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Seven', 'film', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'gloss', 'unpleasantly', 'hooked', 'however', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'Chinese', 'puzzle', 'film', 'gradually', 'be', 'pure', 'surface', 'Douglas', 'essaying', 'yet', 'hard-nosed', 'anti-heroic', 'establishment', 'outsider', 'characteristic', 'intensity', 'only', 'intermittent', 'sense', 'Nick', 'psychological', 'rather', 'physical', 'danger', 'even', 'underlined', 'constant', 'home-movie', 'flashbacks', 'Van', 'Orton', 'Senior', 'demise', 'be', 'what', 'actually', 'stake', 'lack', 'psychological', 'menace', 'film', 'hinges', 'fact', 'other', 'character', 'film', 'properly', 'developed', 'one', 'really', 'carry', 'real', 'threat', 'Perhaps', 'real', 'threat', 'Nick', 'own', 'demons', 'somehow', 'game', 'intended', 'help', 'exorcize', 'questionable', 'what', 'actually', 'see', 'portrayed.The', 'film', 'boistered', 'superb', 'performances', 'including', 'Douglas', 'best', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'Christine', 'waitress', 'waitress', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'quite', 'good', 'playing', 'somewhat', 'spoiled', 'mouthy', 'little', 'brother', 'script', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'film', 'slight', 'black', 'comedy', 'feel', 'usual', 'Fincher', 'film', 'cinematography', 'dark', 'forebodding', 'noir', 'atmosphere', 'sorts', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'music', 'excellent', 'Instead', 'attacking', 'bombastic', 'chords', 'sound', 'as', 'simple', 'piano', 'tinkling', 'used', 'make', 'hearts', 'race', 'plotting', 'ingenious', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'instigated', 'film', 'spider-web', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'mind-boggled', 'films', 'themes', 'redemption', 'paranoia', 'are', 'followed', 'right', 'end', 'ending', 'think', 'supremely', 'contrived', 'pretentious', 'packaging', 'constant', 'hints', 'are', 'watching', 'dark', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'morality', 'tale', 'Game', 'out', 'be', 'merely', 'well-executed', 'action', 'adventure', 'audience', 'paranoid', 'fantasies', 'end', 'Nicholas', 'Van', 'Orton', 'ultimately', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'film-makers']",N/A

I took in this movie with a pair of studio headphones with some good enhancements and didn't miss a single line just in case people wondered if ""I actually watched the movie"".  Yes, it all worked out in the end, but to be honest, I probably would not have taken the conclusion as well if this experience happened to me personally.  I would have been filled with wrath that someone would manipulate my emotions like that by making me believe I killed someone close to me regardless of their intentions.  I definitely would not be partying until I could recover my sanity.  That is really the only thing about this movie is how quickly Nick regains his composure after the conclusion.  It just didn't seem realistic.  I think a tad more drama between him and his bro via a shouting match a la ""How could you do this to me?"" with everyone looking on in awe should have ensued and maybe tearful verbal explanation bringing up issues from the past that may have affected their present before the big hug would have made it seem a bit more real to me.

435195,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6304765789,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","Please note: This review is for the Criterion Blu-ray of ""The Game"" and, if you are reading it under another listing, it's because Amazon has combined reviews.David Fincher's ""The Game"" takes us and the main character the cold, aloof and wealthy Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) on a Hitchcockian thrill ride. Van Orten finds his structured, well manicured life suddenly very messy and unpredictable after he is given an unusual gift by his brother Conrad (Sean Penn)for his birthday. Conrad hands him a card with a phone number that, when Van Orten calls it, pulls him into a live action game where his life is threatened and his whole life is turned upside down, inside out.That isn't to say that ""The Game"" is perfect. Watching the film for the first time, you'll get caught up in trying to put together the puzzle. Is Van Orten's life in danger? Are those around him to be trusted? On later viewings, you'll discover that there are flaws in the plot but you can at least enjoy the ride. (especially if you can suspend your disbelief)The Criterion edition of this well regarded thriller boasts a beautifully rendered transfer. Personally supervised by director of photography Harris Sevides and approved by director Fincher. Detail is remarkably sharp throughout and there's no noticeable visual imperfections.The audio presentation is quite good with two tracks--the former a Theatrical DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and a Near Field DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. The latter is carried over from the original laserdisc that Criterion did back in the day which was designed with a home theater sound system in mind.As with all Criterion editions we get some terrific special features many of them are carried over from the original laserdisc that was released over fifteen years ago. The commentary track features the director Fincher, star Michael Douglas, writers John Brancato  (recorded together)and Michael Ferris, DP Savides, production designer Jeffrey Beecroft and visual effects supervisor Kevin Haug.Fincher's alternate ending is also presented (and is in its complete, raw form--including the slate at the beginning of the take).We also get four sequences that compare storyboards to the finished film presented split screen. These four sequences are also presented again (without the split screen comparison) with optional commentary with behind-the-scenes footage. The uncut psychological visual ""test"" that Van Orten is given is presented in full (it is, however, presented without a commentary or any soundtrack for that matter).Finally the last extras include the teaser trailer, and full trailer are presented with an optional commentary track.  As with all Criterion titles we get a booklet with an essay. I found the booklet to be less extensive than many other titles and the insights fall into two categories--quite good and quite a stretch categories.My only complaint about this set is that we don't anything new in the way of special features. It would be nice to have a discussion with those who made the film looking at it again 16 years after the original release of the film.""The Game"" receives a top notch high definition transfer as well as including the special features from the original laserdisc release.",5,"""Think of it (the game) as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you"".

This one falls nicely into that categorization.For a basic plot summary, ""The Game"" sees workaholic businessman Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) given a gift certificate to the mysterious ""CRS"" company by brother Conrad (Sean Penn).  When Nicholas decides to give CRS a try, he is thrust into a far-reaching ""game"", of sorts, that touches every aspect of his life.When this movie starts out, it looks like just any other Michael Douglas movie (where he plays the jerk boss).  It is a bit slow to get off the ground and will have you wondering which direction the whole experience is taking.  About 45 minutes in, though, the film kicks into high gear and only keeps accelerating until the end.This is the type of movie that will have you thinking about its possibilities the whole way through.  Just when you think you have it figured it, it throws you another twist again...and again...and again.  By the very end, you'll even stop guessing and just resign yourself to the fact that Fincher is going to blow you away no matter what!  I hate to call this a ""twist ending"" film, but it shares many of those same characteristics.Overall, ""The Game"" impressed me with its ability to effectively create high drama, character development, and a sense of mystery throughout.
