The criminals go to prison, along with Pryor, and they swear that he'll be a dead man when he's there in prison.  So he does the only thing he can do to prevent himself from going to prison, at this point:  pretend that he's crazy.He is admitted to a psycho ward at a hospital, and is just about to be released to go to prison, failing in convincing them that's he's crazy.  But problems occur in the ward, and the lead administrator at the hospital is held hostage.  And Pryor can't escape the hospital due to horrible flooding, brought on by a storm, so he has to stay there.  And wouldn't you know it, he has to pretend that he's a doctor now.This movie has it's funny moments, I tell ya.  But some serious ones too, concerning the bad conditions at the hospital.",5,"Richard Pryor, man",1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,889,"['Pryor', 'excellent', 'classic', ""80's.Richard"", 'plays', 'guy', 'who', 'pawn', 'setting', 'up', 'criminal', 'New', 'York', 'criminals', 'go', 'prison', 'Pryor', 'swear', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dead', 'man', 'when', 'there', 'prison', 'So', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'prevent', 'going', 'prison', 'point', 'pretend', 'crazy.He', 'admitted', 'psycho', 'ward', 'hospital', 'just', 'be', 'released', 'go', 'prison', 'failing', 'convincing', 'crazy', 'problems', 'occur', 'ward', 'lead', 'administrator', 'hospital', 'held', 'hostage', 'Pryor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'hospital', 'due', 'horrible', 'flooding', 'brought', 'storm', 'stay', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'pretend', 'doctor', 'now.This', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'tell', 'ya', 'serious', 'ones', 'too', 'concerning', 'bad', 'conditions', 'hospital']",Critical Condition
