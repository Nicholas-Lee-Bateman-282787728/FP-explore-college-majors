1696532,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00JCCHMU8,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","I&#8217;ve been waiting for James McAvoy to make good on his promising start since 2006, but sadly I have yet to see him get the accolades and projects worthy of his talent.  The thing is, I don&#8217;t think many people really know who he is.  Despite having been in that Narnia series and despite having headlined some popular films (like X-Men), the majority of the world is unfamiliar with his name.  This is sad, because McAvoy displayed such thick character development in &#8216;The Last King of Scotland&#8217;, and while Whitaker had the flashiest character, it was McAvoy who deserved the accolades that Whitaker received.&#8216;Filth&#8217; is not going to change McAvoy&#8217;s popularity, mostly because half of the known world will not see it, but it is further proof of the fact that McAvoy deserves a better career.Why is someone like Ryan Reynolds a household name but James McAvoy is known as &#8220;that guy who plays Charles Xavier&#8221;?James McAvoy is indeed on FIRE as Bruce Robertson, the coke snorting, philandering, prank calling, devious cop hoping for a promotion we all know he doesn&#8217;t deserve.  He&#8217;ll do anything to get it though, even if it means destroying the reputations of his fellow colleagues.  Whether he&#8217;s challenging his so-called friends to a measuring contest, blackmailing minors into giving him favors or prank calling a friend&#8217;s wife, Bruce is also self-purposing and always self-damaging.  The thing is, there is a darker backstory that is causing all this outlandish behavior, and soon Bruce is going to crack under the pressure.The main issues with &#8216;Filth&#8217; lie in the film&#8217;s construction.  It is just tonally off.  The film is in one part a black comedy and in the other a dire drama, and the two ends don&#8217;t meet comfortably.  Irvine Welsh is not an easy writer.  His style is one that is exploitive and harsh and yet carries a humor that is needed to cut all the tension.  Danny Boyle knew how to blend those worlds harmoniously, giving us a pretty stellar film in &#8216;Trainspotting&#8217;, back in 1996.  Sadly, &#8216;Filth&#8217; doesn&#8217;t balance those two ends fluidly.  Instead, it tries to give us two separate films.  The first half is rather brilliant.  The dark comedy angle serves a strong purpose and gives McAvoy and the rest of the cast something to sink their teeth into.  The second half (or final act, more specifically) delves so far away from the comedy and into a more severe tone that it feels off and takes us out of the film.  It almost feels too serious, to the point where it becomes unintentionally funny, which isn&#8217;t what you want from a film like this.That being said, McAvoy is brilliant and it is a shame that this won&#8217;t garner him any awards traction at the end of the year.  The film is simply too small and too harsh for anyone to single it out.  The rest of the cast, especially Jamie Bell, is also up to the task and handles the material well, but this is the McAvoy show from start to finish.",4,"Sad, sad little man&#8230;",1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,3045,"['8217', 'been', 'waiting', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'make', 'good', 'promising', 'start', '2006', 'sadly', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'get', 'accolades', 'projects', 'worthy', 'talent', 'thing', 'don', '8217', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'really', 'know', 'who', 'having', 'been', 'Narnia', 'series', 'having', 'headlined', 'popular', 'films', 'X-Men', 'majority', 'world', 'unfamiliar', 'name', 'sad', 'McAvoy', 'displayed', 'such', 'thick', 'character', 'development', '8216', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', '8217', 'Whitaker', 'had', 'flashiest', 'character', 'was', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'Whitaker', '8216', 'Filth', '8217', 'not', 'going', 'change', 'McAvoy', '8217', 's', 'popularity', 'mostly', 'half', 'known', 'world', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'further', 'proof', 'fact', 'McAvoy', 'better', 'career.Why', 'someone', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'household', 'name', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'known', '8220', 'guy', 'who', 'Charles', 'Xavier', '8221', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'indeed', 'FIRE', 'Bruce', 'Robertson', 'coke', 'snorting', 'philandering', 'prank', 'calling', 'devious', 'cop', 'hoping', 'promotion', 'know', '8217', 'deserve', '8217', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'even', 'destroying', 'reputations', 'fellow', 'colleagues', '8217', 'challenging', 'so-called', 'friends', 'measuring', 'contest', 'blackmailing', 'minors', 'giving', 'favors', 'prank', 'calling', 'friend', '8217', 's', 'wife', 'Bruce', 'also', 'self-purposing', 'always', 'self-damaging', 'thing', 'darker', 'backstory', 'causing', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'soon', 'Bruce', 'going', 'crack', 'pressure.The', 'main', 'issues', '8216', 'Filth', '8217', 'lie', 'film', '8217', 's', 'construction', 'just', 'tonally', 'off', 'film', 'one', 'part', 'black', 'comedy', 'other', 'dire', 'drama', 'two', 'ends', 'don', '8217', 'meet', 'comfortably', 'Irvine', 'Welsh', 'not', 'easy', 'writer', 'style', 'one', 'exploitive', 'harsh', 'yet', 'humor', 'needed', 'cut', 'tension', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'knew', 'how', 'blend', 'worlds', 'harmoniously', 'giving', 'pretty', 'stellar', 'film', '8216', 'Trainspotting', '8217', 'back', '1996', 'Sadly', '8216', 'Filth', '8217', '8217', 't', 'balance', 'two', 'ends', 'fluidly', 'Instead', 'give', 'two', 'separate', 'films', 'first', 'half', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'dark', 'comedy', 'angle', 'strong', 'purpose', 'McAvoy', 'rest', 'cast', 'something', 'sink', 'teeth', 'second', 'half', 'final', 'act', 'more', 'specifically', 'delves', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'comedy', 'more', 'severe', 'tone', 'film', 'almost', 'too', 'serious', 'point', 'where', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'what', 'want', 'film', 'this.That', 'being', 'said', 'McAvoy', 'brilliant', 'shame', 'won', '8217', 'garner', 'awards', 'traction', 'end', 'year', 'film', 'simply', 'too', 'small', 'too', 'harsh', 'anyone', 'single', 'out', 'rest', 'cast', 'especially', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'also', 'up', 'task', 'material', 'well', 'McAvoy', 'show', 'start', 'finish']","Filth (2013) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

1696536,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00JCCHMU8,D. Holmes,"[6, 7]","In Edinburgh, Bruce Robertson is deceitful, drug-abusing, profane, sadistic, sexist, losing his mind, and an ambitious detective sergeant maneuvering for a promotion within his department.  Irvine Welsh's blistering novel Filth does not lend itself to adaptation.  Rather than focus on procedure and structure, the novelist's central interest is submerging his readership in the toxic mind of the protagonist, an amoral man in crisis.  He achieves this a number of ways, including the postmodern use of the figure of the tapeworm; a manifestation of Bruce Robertson's mental illness, it devours pages and becomes more self-aware, more philosophical, as it grows.  In a glorious twist, however, this film, masterful and psychedelic as it is, proves the novel definitely could be filmed.  It draws a significant amount of its power from an astonishing lead performance by James McAvoy.  He has given sensitive and strong performances for years, shining in such films as The Last King of Scotland, Atonement, The Last Station, and Trance.  He reaches another level here, though.  It is a bold and ferocious acting feat, at once live-wire charismatic and vastly grotesque, elevating self-destruction to an art form while slyly glancing at the audience through the camera.  As the film is told in the first person, with reality clarifying and distorting as it does for the unstable Bruce, the actor is relied upon to maintain a high level of energy and find a through-line of authentic, soulful pain amidst the colorful chaos.  His achievement is matched by ace editing, photography, and production design.  Similar to, for example, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, this is the rare serious film which invites (or even demands) aural and visual excess, and the parade of comic and/or suspenseful set pieces is nothing short of exhilarating, building to a wallop of a conclusion which slightly deviates from and, with respect to the inimitable Welsh, improves upon the novel's.",5,"A depraved, fiery, hilarious McAvoy leads this stylish masterpiece",1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,1970,"['Edinburgh', 'Bruce', 'Robertson', 'deceitful', 'drug-abusing', 'profane', 'sadistic', 'sexist', 'losing', 'mind', 'ambitious', 'detective', 'sergeant', 'maneuvering', 'promotion', 'department', 'Irvine', 'Welsh', 'blistering', 'novel', 'Filth', 'not', 'lend', 'adaptation', 'Rather', 'focus', 'procedure', 'structure', 'novelist', 'central', 'interest', 'submerging', 'readership', 'toxic', 'mind', 'protagonist', 'amoral', 'man', 'crisis', 'number', 'ways', 'including', 'postmodern', 'use', 'figure', 'tapeworm', 'manifestation', 'Bruce', 'Robertson', 'mental', 'illness', 'pages', 'more', 'self-aware', 'more', 'philosophical', 'glorious', 'twist', 'however', 'film', 'masterful', 'psychedelic', 'novel', 'definitely', 'could', 'be', 'filmed', 'significant', 'amount', 'power', 'astonishing', 'lead', 'performance', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'given', 'sensitive', 'strong', 'performances', 'years', 'shining', 'such', 'films', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'Atonement', 'Last', 'Station', 'Trance', 'level', 'here', 'though', 'bold', 'ferocious', 'acting', 'feat', 'once', 'live-wire', 'charismatic', 'vastly', 'grotesque', 'elevating', 'self-destruction', 'art', 'form', 'slyly', 'glancing', 'audience', 'camera', 'film', 'told', 'first', 'person', 'reality', 'clarifying', 'distorting', 'unstable', 'Bruce', 'actor', 'relied', 'maintain', 'high', 'level', 'energy', 'find', 'through-line', 'authentic', 'soulful', 'pain', 'colorful', 'chaos', 'achievement', 'matched', 'ace', 'editing', 'photography', 'production', 'design', 'Similar', 'example', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'rare', 'serious', 'film', 'even', 'demands', 'aural', 'visual', 'excess', 'parade', 'comic', 'and/or', 'suspenseful', 'set', 'pieces', 'nothing', 'short', 'exhilarating', 'building', 'wallop', 'conclusion', 'slightly', 'respect', 'inimitable', 'Welsh', 'novel']","Filth (2013) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

1696539,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00JCCHMU8,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","There are several reasons for considering watching this film about a possible hero's descent into madness and despair - a book and screenplay by Irving Welsh (`Trainspotting'), and Jon S. Baird who seems to be rising as a writing an directing and producing talent to watch, and the brilliant actor James McAvoy who continues to impress with a wide range of roles. What doesn't work so well is the 97 minutes of unmitigated coarse material and activity and the ruthlessness of the abuse of the individual that is performed by a primarily Scottish cast with brogues so thick that without subtitles about 90% of the film is inaccessible (not that that is a bad thing in the end...)The promo for the film describes the `story' best: `Scheming Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy), a bigoted and corrupt policeman, is in line for a promotion and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Enlisted to solve a brutal murder and threatened by the aspirations of his colleagues, including Ray Lennox (Jamie Bell), Drummond (Imogen Poots), Bladesey (Eddie Marsan), Inglis (Emun Elliott) etc, Bruce sets about ensuring their ruin, right under the nose of unwitting Chief Inspector Toal (John Sessions). As he turns his colleagues against one another by stealing their wives (Shirley Henderson unrecognizable gussied up in wigs, Kate Dickie, Joanne Froggart) and exposing their secrets, Bruce starts to lose himself in a web of deceit that he can no longer control. His past is slowly catching up with him, and a missing wife Carole (Shauna Macdonald), a crippling drug habit and suspicious colleagues start to take their toll on his sanity. The question is: can he keep his grip on reality long enough to disentangle himself from the filth?Despite a brilliant acting turn from James McAvoy, a film that celebrates murder, phone sex, police corruption, casual frequent fellatio, crude (when understood) language, etc will have a very limited and likely not a long lasting appeal.

1696545,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00JCCHMU8,Robert Hayes,"[1, 1]","Despite some inconsistent tone, FILTH is a darkly comic film about a despicable cop's descent into madness. The story follows Bruce Robertson, a Scottish cop who is up for a promotion, and in charge of a murder investigation. However, those two details are merely springboards for what the movie is really about, that is, his impossibly filthy lifestyle and how he pushes himself to his breaking point. As played by James McAvoy, he is largely unsympathetic although he does have a twisted sense of humor. Other than possibly feeling sorry for him (which is a stretch), the only thing audiences will have to connect with is the promise of being reunited with family, which is what he hopes to achieve with the promotion. However, in the end, even that proves illusory. There is a seriously dark undercurrent to this whole movie, but there is a lot of dark humor to soften what otherwise would be an oppressively dark portrait of a man on the edge. Even still, these are the kind of movies that I love. It's not perfect, due to some jarring attempts at sentimentality, but this is largely a bravura effort with an incredible performance by James McAvoy, and based on a book by the author of TRAINSPOTTING (which tackles similar thematic material).

This is due in large part to what is perhaps the finest performance of James Macavoy's career. &#34;Filth&#34; isn't perfect but it's not awful by any means.,3,Far from perfect but it has it's merits,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,611,"['34', 'Filth', '34', 'messy', 'little', 'movie', 'problem', 'Irvine', 'Welsh', 'adaptation', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'compared', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'brilliant', 'seminal', 'masterpiece', '34', 'Trainspotting.', '34', '34', 'Filth', '34', 'not', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'edge', 'debauchery', '34', 'Trainspotting', '34', 'had', 'point', '34', 'Filth', '34', 'just', 'kind', 'well', 'gross', 'being', 'said', 'were', 'moments', 'truly', 'saw', 'great', 'movie', 'shining', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'what', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'performance', 'James', 'Macavoy', 'career', '34', 'Filth', '34', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'not', 'awful', 'means']","Filth (2013) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

Here too he's provided with the opportunity to take his role to places that will make you truly uncomfortable. This character is garbage, a human stain, manipulating and hurting everyone. He is close to no one and seems to be happy with that for the first half of the movie. But you begin to really see him unravel, though I will say definitely not in an easily predicted way (ala 'Crying Game' - in a way).
