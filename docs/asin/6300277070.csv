240770,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,6300277070,DarthJustice,"[1, 1]","Ernest Goes To Camp was the first movie to star the well-known Jim Varney character, Ernest P. Worrell though not the first movie Ernest appeared in.Being released in 1987, the movie follows Ernest who is working at a summer camp. Wanting to be a counselor, Ernest is currently a janitor who none of the other counselors believe in or have much confidence in being a counselor. We soon find that a group of juvenile delinquents are sent to the camp who ultimately indirectly injure their own counselor. Short-handed, the head counselor has no option but to give Ernest a chance.Meanwhile, there's a corporation who discovers that the land the camp is on houses very valuable gems. Wanting the land and the gems, the CEO sets out to get the land in whatever way, honest or otherwise (primarily otherwise). Standing in his way is the land's owner, one aging Native American and grandfather of the camp's nurse, Nurse St. Cloud. All the while Ernest struggles to win over the affections of ""his"" kids and prove himself worthy, even after a dire mistake Ernest makes that causes great disappointment among many of the characters.For an Ernest movie, truthfully you can't expect a whole lot. That's not saying it's a bad movie or anything, but just a fact. It's a straight-forward comedy with some touching moments and a running gag or two.Jim Varney, as always, does great as his loveable buffoon of a character. The kids aren't half bad, at that.Ernest Goes To Camp is definitely one of the better Ernest movies. Ranking them, I'd say this would definitely go above Scared Stupid (I say that as someone who considered SS his favorite Ernest movie growing up) and the installments that followed.If you're looking for a comedy that doesn't involve tons of adult humor, this might be a good option. Especially for any Ernest fans who have not seen this (though I can't imagine there are any that fit that last part).",4,"Hey Vern, It's A Camp Review",1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,1910,"['Ernest', 'Goes', 'Camp', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'star', 'well-known', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'character', 'Ernest', 'P.', 'Worrell', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'Ernest', 'appeared', 'in.Being', 'released', '1987', 'movie', 'Ernest', 'who', 'working', 'summer', 'camp', 'Wanting', 'be', 'counselor', 'Ernest', 'currently', 'janitor', 'who', 'none', 'other', 'counselors', 'believe', 'have', 'much', 'confidence', 'being', 'counselor', 'soon', 'find', 'group', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'are', 'sent', 'camp', 'who', 'ultimately', 'indirectly', 'injure', 'own', 'counselor', 'Short-handed', 'head', 'counselor', 'option', 'give', 'Ernest', 'chance.Meanwhile', 'corporation', 'who', 'land', 'camp', 'houses', 'very', 'valuable', 'gems', 'Wanting', 'land', 'gems', 'CEO', 'out', 'get', 'land', 'way', 'honest', 'otherwise', 'primarily', 'otherwise', 'Standing', 'way', 'land', 'owner', 'one', 'aging', 'Native', 'American', 'grandfather', 'camp', 'nurse', 'Nurse', 'St', 'Cloud', 'while', 'Ernest', 'win', 'affections', 'kids', 'prove', 'worthy', 'even', 'dire', 'mistake', 'Ernest', 'great', 'disappointment', 'many', 'characters.For', 'Ernest', 'movie', 'truthfully', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'movie', 'anything', 'just', 'fact', 'straight-forward', 'comedy', 'touching', 'moments', 'running', 'gag', 'two.Jim', 'Varney', 'always', 'great', 'loveable', 'buffoon', 'character', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'that.Ernest', 'Goes', 'Camp', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'Ernest', 'movies', 'Ranking', ""'d"", 'say', 'would', 'definitely', 'go', 'Scared', 'Stupid', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'considered', 'SS', 'favorite', 'Ernest', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'installments', 'followed.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'involve', 'tons', 'adult', 'humor', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'option', 'Especially', 'Ernest', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'are', 'fit', 'last', 'part']",N/A

Ernest Scared Stupid, Ernest Goes to Jail, Ernest Rides Again, and Ernest Saves Christmas are a few that I consider guilty pleasures as of now. Ernest Goes to Camp, on the other hand, isn't really much of a pleasure. I know that this is the first ever Ernest film that was released, but I don't find it as fun as the other Ernest films. Plus, I could care less about the kids in this film: most of them have no character, and their 80's clothing is really uncomfortable to watch. The Native American characters are typical environmentalists (a stereotype), but at least they are very positive characters. The villains are cardboard cutouts. And, of course, the battle near the end is completely ridiculous. Come on, how can a few dozen adults be easily attacked by a group of kids? Still, Ernest Goes to Camp isn't that bad of a movie. Ernest is typically hilarious, and his goofy sidekicks are likable (even if they are a bit annoying at times).

However, considering his sad, early death a couple of years ago, you'd think there would be a few extras on these screwball camp classics. Interviews, outtakes, something. But at least we get to bring Ernest home, the guy with the small brains, big heart, and the most flexible face you've ever seen.This is the first of the Ernest flicks, and considered by most to be his best. Ernest is a maintenance man at a boy's summer camp who gets stuck with a group of juvenile delinquents no one else wants to work with. His innocence, acceptence, and naivete are exactly what the boys need and slowly, he works change in their hearts. Of course, they take great advantage of his dim wits in the beginning with hilarious results. In spite of their joking, Ernest cares for the boys and tries his hardest to be the best camp counselor he can be.The movie is full of as much camp humor as one can muster - the food jokes probably being the most extreme - and hilarious. We even get to hear Ernest sing. The tone changes midway as the camp is introduced to a crisis. A mining corporation longs to buy the camp for its rich resources and takes advantage of Ernest's low wattage brain power to get it's way. A battle of great proportions ensues, complete with indian war paint, disgusting camp food, and my personal favorite, paratrooper turtles. The paratrooper turtles instantly landed this camp movie in the category of campy classics. And believe it or not, in the middle of all this screwy humor, there are some truly touching moments and some great moral lessons.The movie is true family fare, free of language, sexual innuendo, or other things that find their way into family films these days. It is a great way to initiate summer and to reminisce about the glory days of summer camp. The biggest difference between this and other Ernest films is the lack of characters played by Varney. He is Ernest almost the entire film - and if my memory serves me correctly, Vern may not even be present. But the movie is Ernest all the way and Jim Varney fans will not be dissappointed.

In fact, I appreciate Varney's brand of humor now more than ever. While most kids' shows today are aimed at playing down to a child's intelligence, making them feel as if they're on the bottom rung of things, the 'Ernest' movies never did that. Ernest never lectured a child, he never made them feel inferior. He made them feel like their opinions were just as important as his. He treated them as equals and children really gravitate toward that. I know I did.'Ernest Goes to Camp' is just one of my favorites that I can't get enough of. Ernest is Kamp Kikakee's 'fix it' guy but dreams of becoming a Camp Councelor, but no one will give him a chance. That is until a group of Juvenile delinquents are selected to join Kamp Kikakee for the summer. Automatically, almost every counselor, especially Councelor Stennis, thinks the worst of them and treats them as such. You treat a kid like a misfit, they'll act like one. You treat a kid like they're worth something, they'll truly shine. Case in point, Stennis gets pushed into the water by the boys after he throws Moose into the lake, knowing he can't swim. No one wants to help the boys so they decide to 'dump' them onto Ernest by giving in to his wish of becoming a counselor. And that's only because they don't want to 'fool' with the boys themselves. At first, all of Ernest's attempts to get the boys interested in camping activities are met with practical jokes, stunts and a mockery of Ernest. But, being Ernest, he refuses to give up on the boys. Eventually, his perseverance pays off and the boys start believing in themselves and their abilities to do something positive with their lives.Sherman Krader of 'Krader Mining Company' wants the land(in the worst way) that Kamp Kikakee sits on to mine a fictitious mineral known as Petrocite and his greed makes him a very dishonest and hostile man. He eventually cons Ernest into talking the Chief into signing over the land, telling Ernest that it's a petition instead of a lease. Ernest and Nurse St. Cloud are the only ones that are able to communicate with the chief. After figuring out that he got taken, Ernest tries to fix it by confronting the foreman in charge of the activities of the mining company. It turns out that the foreman is a mammoth of a guy. Ernest still faces him in a fight even though he knows he won't win but feels he has to stand up for the camp and the boys. After getting beat up, all the boys, but Moose, turn on him once more. Ernest feels terrible and thinks he let down the entire camp. This is the part where Ernest sings 'Gee, I'm Glad It's Rainin''. This song is quintessential Ernest and could've been his theme song in every movie. ""What they wanted was a hero. All I needed was a friend"". He sings it so heartbreakingly beautiful and the pain is evident in his blue eyes. After Nurse St. Cloud scolds the boys, telling them how Ernest was the only one to stand by them, they band together and convince Ernest to help them stop Krader Mining Company. Together, with the uplifting song, 'Brave Hearts', they construct contraptions and a catapult loaded down with bombs, fire arrows and 'turtle paratroopers', they blow up the equipment that Krader Mining Company had on the premises. Ernest finally gets his chance to knock out the foreman when his dozer gets hit with the cart loaded with flammable material. Krader is fed up with being stopped, so taking his rifle, he intends to shoot Ernest. Going back to the opening of the movie, Nurse St. Cloud's narrates the story of the stone, blade and arrow. No matter how good Krader's aim is, he always misses Ernest. Finally, Krader points the rifle point blank in Ernest's face, but Ernest plugs up the rifle, saying, ""Paper, rock, scissors"", his version of the stone, blade and arrow. Krader knows he lost and makes a run for it. Krader's attorney admits that the chief was conned into signing the lease. The campers get Kamp Kikakee back and Ernest is now a year round counselor. The ending credits are great, with the song 'Brave Hearts' by Gary Chapman playing in its entirety. The words are wonderful and play into the theme of the entire movie. I recommend this movie highly if you're looking for good, honest, clean fun with a great moral message.

Morales,"[0, 7]","Ernest Goes to Camp is basically the story of the cult favorite Ernest getting stuck with a bunch of juveniles as a camp counselor when at the same time the camp is being threatened by a Mining Company looking to destroy it to search for valuable land minerals.Basically it's the same ol' underdog-hated-and-loser-at-everything-but-becomes-our-hero-let's save-the-camp! movie we've all seen ten bazillion times.Ernest's jokes are so few and far between in this film and so pathetically weak when they DO happen that the filmmakers had to go as far as using the 2 dumb and cooky camp cooks to try and fill in comedic relief because their star has been given such an absymal script. If this film was PRIMARILY about those cooks (who get like only THREE scenes) this probably would've been at least a 3 or 4 star movie.The film tries very hard to be serious, trying to make us see the ""softer"" and ""more human"" side of Ernest but just ends up making a 90 minute movie into what feels like a three-hour drag fest. Give me COMEDY from Ernest! NOT drama!What makes Ernest funny as all his fans know is that he is NOT supposed to be made out to be an insecure and sensitive underdog-everyman. He's gentle but insane, and his usual over-the-top stupidity is simply never used in this film. Add this to the constant slap-stick humor that's ridiculously outdated, a horrendously emotionless soundtrack, movie cliches so tired and weak only a 2 year old would find them intriguing, and juvenile special effects and you've got probably one of the worst comedies ever created. There is nothing worse than a bad comedy. Watching a comedy with Ernest and not laughing is like watching an Arny or Van Damme movie without a single explosion, fist fight or gun shot.Everyone giving this film 4 and 5 star reviews probably remember seeing this from when they were just kids. I'd ask all these people to watch it again now that they're mature movie goers and see if you still feel the same way.

He's either hilarious or excruciatingly dumb.  I identify myself as an Ernest fan, and I will admit that that has a ton to do with growing up as a child in the 80s.  He was a product of his time, aimed toward a certain audience and I was of that time and audience.  I find the man hilarious.  Ernest Goes to Camp isn't my favorite Ernest movie, but it is easily one of the better in his never-ending catalog.  The crown, for me, goes to Ernest Saves Christmas, but as with many, my movie introduction to the man came when he went to camp and made the staggering leap from inept handyman to inept, but caring, camp counselor.  Of course, I'd known Ernest for a while because of the prevalent commercials on tv at the time, but his brand of wacky and physical humor always did it for me.  I firmly understand that this humor isn't for everybody, but I enjoyed it.  I found Jim Varney to be, despite the quality of the movies he was in, a very gifted creator of characters.  The movies really took off when he was able to riff on different personalities, but unfortunately, he didn't do too much of that in his debut film.  Instead, he inhabits his character with the very quality of the name he'd given him and injected him with a massive amount of heart.  He may bumble around like a fool, but like the wayward kids he was put in charge of, he wins you over with his unending optimism and good nature.  It's refreshing to find a good, clean movie that you aren't afraid to show your kids that puts forth a nice message amongst all the silly goings on.  Best of all, you will learn what to never, ever do if you run across a mess of badgers.The movie on blu-ray, unfortunately, isn't much to write home about.  The video quality is probably better than the dvd version, but I don't know that it's enough or the type of movie that mandates an upgrade to the superior format.  The special features are lacking, but it is a good price.  If you don't already own the regular dvd version and are a fan of the man in the hat and denim vest, it's a good, cheap pick up.  If you however already own the dvd, an upgrade probably isn't very necessary unless you're just a completist.  And if you are, as I said, it's not like the movie costs an arm and a leg.I enjoy this movie, even as an adult.  The humor probably doesn't work on me as well now as it did back in the mid 80s when I was 6 or 7, but I get a kick out of watching the man do his thing.  If anything, re-watching the movie reminds me that I miss Jim Varney and I wish he was still around entertaining the kids and the kid in us with his wacky characters.",4,"Ernest on Blu-Ray, Knowhutimean?",1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,2692,"['Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'outset', 'either', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'hilarious', 'excruciatingly', 'dumb', 'identify', 'Ernest', 'fan', 'will', 'admit', 'ton', 'do', 'growing', 'up', 'child', '80s', 'was', 'product', 'time', 'aimed', 'certain', 'audience', 'was', 'time', 'audience', 'find', 'man', 'hilarious', 'Ernest', 'Camp', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'Ernest', 'movie', 'easily', 'one', 'better', 'never-ending', 'catalog', 'crown', 'Ernest', 'Saves', 'Christmas', 'many', 'movie', 'introduction', 'man', 'came', 'when', 'went', 'camp', 'made', 'staggering', 'leap', 'inept', 'handyman', 'inept', 'caring', 'camp', 'counselor', 'course', ""'d"", 'known', 'Ernest', 'while', 'prevalent', 'commercials', 'tv', 'time', 'brand', 'wacky', 'physical', 'humor', 'always', 'did', 'firmly', 'understand', 'humor', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'enjoyed', 'found', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'be', 'quality', 'movies', 'was', 'very', 'gifted', 'creator', 'characters', 'movies', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'when', 'was', 'able', 'riff', 'different', 'personalities', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'much', 'debut', 'film', 'Instead', 'character', 'very', 'quality', 'name', ""'d"", 'given', 'injected', 'massive', 'amount', 'heart', 'may', 'bumble', 'around', 'fool', 'wayward', 'kids', 'was', 'put', 'charge', 'unending', 'optimism', 'good', 'nature', 'refreshing', 'find', 'good', 'clean', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'kids', 'forth', 'nice', 'message', 'silly', 'goings', 'Best', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'never', 'ever', 'do', 'run', 'mess', 'badgers.The', 'movie', 'blu-ray', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'much', 'write', 'home', 'video', 'quality', 'probably', 'better', 'dvd', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'type', 'movie', 'upgrade', 'superior', 'format', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'lacking', 'good', 'price', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'regular', 'dvd', 'version', 'are', 'fan', 'man', 'hat', 'denim', 'vest', 'good', 'cheap', 'pick', 'up', 'however', 'already', 'own', 'dvd', 'upgrade', 'probably', ""n't"", 'very', 'necessary', ""'re"", 'just', 'completist', 'are', 'said', 'not', 'movie', 'arm', 'leg.I', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'even', 'adult', 'humor', 'probably', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'now', 'did', 'back', 'mid', '80s', 'when', 'was', '6', '7', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'man', 'do', 'thing', 'anything', 're-watching', 'movie', 'miss', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'wish', 'was', 'still', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'kid', 'wacky', 'characters']",N/A

The movie was made when Varney had a Saturday morning television show and was still making those popular television commercials on a regular basis. The film precedes other ventures in Varney's career, such as his voice work in the TOY STORY films. Next to ERNEST SAVES CHRISTMAS, ERNEST GOES TO CAMP is the best of all the Ernest movies that were made.Unlike the other Varney films, Varney sticks to playing Ernest. Ernest works at a summer camp for boys as a maintenance man. He longs to be a camp counselor, but the director feels he isn't qualified. However, when the camp participates in a ""Second Chance"" program for delinquint boys and no one else seems to be able to handle them, Ernest is given the job of being their counselor. At first the gang finds him annoying and a push-over, but over time they come to respect him and realize all he has done for them.  The climax of the movie erupts when a nearby mining company threatens to takeover the camp after duping the Native American chief who owned the land.  Ernest won't stand by and see the camp destroyed and with the help from his boys they take on the mining company.The movie is full of dumb humor that kids are sure to enjoy. I remember laughing hysterically when I originally saw this film in the theatre. My tastes have changed since then, but after watching the movie again on DVD, I still enjoyed it for what it was: a big, dumb movie with an awful lot of heart. The movie is a great family movie because it contains no foul language or sexual innduendo and very little violence. It's also a joy to watch because it illustrates the comic genius of Jim Varney back in his prime. Plus, it has the only film I know of that includes turtle paratroopers.
