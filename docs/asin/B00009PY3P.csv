Years later, I found her again in this film, I, MADMAN. She is again fantastic, as once again her character's coy, gentle nature shines through the dark horror around her. Ms. Wright plays Virginia, a woman obsessed w/ a gruesome novel about a murderous maniac who will stop at nothing, including brutal homicide and self-mutilation, to prove his ""love"" for the woman of his desire. Virginia is drawn into not only the story, but the life of it's author, Malcolm Band as well. She soon discovers that the book has somehow come into reality, and people she knows begin dying in awful ways! I, MADMAN is a solid creeper, with some humorous touches throughout. I expected the killer to be a sort of Freddy Krueger clone / parody, rather than the truly malevolent force he turned out to be. Cook is wonderful in this tortured, demented role. Yep, I, MADMAN is a perfect little spooker. Jenny Wright should have been the queen of her generation's horror movies, instead of disappearing like Candace Hilligoss!

756323,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,B00009PY3P,Bruce Rux,"[5, 5]","I can't believe this gem of a thriller isn't better known.Reclusive secondhand bookstore shopper Jenny Wright finds an obscure paperback original horror thriller, and loves it so much she hunts down the unknown author's only other title, ""I, Madman.""  Its story is about a psychotic surgeon scorned by the object of his affections, who, in order to please her with the perfect visage, novocains himself, cuts off his own face, and murders other people to steal their features and sew them onto himself.  But no sooner does Wright begin reading the story, than a bizarre, masked stalker begins following her around, enacting the story in real-life, killing her friends to steal their features and get closer to her.  The author of ""I, Madman,"" it seems, wasn't writing a thriller  -  he wrote his autobiography.This one's a beautifully produced low-budget winner, benefiting from solid performances, a good script, gripping suspense and just the right amount of graphic gore.  It even has a nice opening and closing surreal special effects sequence, used probably to help diminish the intensity of the film so viewers will be reminded that it's just a story, after all, and not have as many nightmares after watching as they might otherwise.Definitely not for the faint of heart or squeamish of stomach, but lovers of thrillers and horror flicks will be more than satisfied.",4,Faceless Fear,1019606400,"04 24, 2002",2002,1373,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'gem', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'better', 'known.Reclusive', 'secondhand', 'bookstore', 'shopper', 'Jenny', 'Wright', 'obscure', 'paperback', 'original', 'horror', 'thriller', 'so', 'much', 'unknown', 'author', 'only', 'other', 'title', 'Madman', 'story', 'psychotic', 'surgeon', 'scorned', 'object', 'affections', 'who', 'order', 'please', 'perfect', 'visage', 'own', 'face', 'murders', 'other', 'people', 'steal', 'features', 'sew', 'sooner', 'Wright', 'begin', 'reading', 'story', 'bizarre', 'masked', 'stalker', 'following', 'enacting', 'story', 'real-life', 'killing', 'friends', 'steal', 'features', 'get', 'closer', 'author', 'Madman', 'was', ""n't"", 'writing', 'thriller', 'wrote', 'autobiography.This', 'one', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'low-budget', 'winner', 'benefiting', 'solid', 'performances', 'good', 'script', 'gripping', 'suspense', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'graphic', 'gore', 'even', 'nice', 'opening', 'closing', 'surreal', 'special', 'effects', 'sequence', 'used', 'probably', 'help', 'diminish', 'intensity', 'film', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'reminded', 'just', 'story', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'nightmares', 'watching', 'might', 'otherwise.Definitely', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'squeamish', 'stomach', 'lovers', 'thrillers', 'horror', 'flicks', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'satisfied']","I, Madman"

756325,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B00009PY3P,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","Virginia is thrust into a world of murder and mayhem where the lines of fantasy and reality begin to blur as she gets deeper and deeper into a chilling new novel: I, Madman. What she doesn't realize is that the further she reads, the closer she comes to bringing the nefarious Dr. Alan Kessler to life! Tibor Tak&aacute;cs tells this thrilling tale of mystery and suspense with a sharp wit and a classy sense of style. Tak&aacute;cs dresses the film in the same lavish colors and stylized characters that you would find in your average pulp fiction magazine from the 40's and 50's, but mixes in the dark, suffocating mood of a Film Noir. The subtle shift in surroundings as Virginia slips in and out of her own fantasy world are gradual enough that we, the viewers, have trouble deciphering fact from fiction. Jenny Wright is given many opportunities to shine as she drifts between a number of different personalities that occur throughout the novel. Visual effects designer Randall William Cook also takes a playful stab at acting as our eccentric villain, whose undying love for sweet Virginia drives him to slice off his mangled facial features and replace them with those of his victims.

756326,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00009PY3P,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[9, 9]","Growing up in the 70's and 80's I was constantly bombarded with television commercials that proclaimed `Reading is Fundamental', or RIF, for short...I suppose it was a concerted effort by some group of well meaning individuals to get us cartoon addicted youngins away from the magic box and into the library...but what they failed to mention is that, besides being fundamental, reading can also have serious detrimental effects to your health, possibly resulting in a slight case of death.  Don't believe me?  Then I would recommend watching I, Madman aka Hardcover (1989) for conclusive proof...you may be shocked at what you learn...directed by Tibor Tak&aacute;cs (The Gate), the film stars Jenny Wright (The Wild Life, Near Dark), Clayton Rohner (Just One of the Guys, April Fool's Day), and Randall William Cook, who worked on all three of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films (not in the capacity of an actor, but as effects artist).  Also appearing is Stephanie Hodge, whose face I recognized but couldn't place until I looked up her credits and learned she's not only a comedian, but also appeared on the Fox television show ""Unhappily Ever After"", along with the amply bosomed Nikki Cox, who does not appear in this film.Wright plays Virginia, a literate, attractive woman and aspiring actress who makes ends meet by working in a used bookstore, and has an affinity for seedy pulp fiction novels from the 50's, particularly ones penned by an author named Malcolm Brand.  The trouble begins as Virginia notices that the horrific events in the novel start to translate into real life, as fiction becomes fact, and she's somehow centered in the middle of it...soon she starts seeing the villain from the story, a skulking, darkly garbed killer (Cook) who wears a mask over the lower part of his face (looking much like The Shadow), is a whiz with the straight edge razor, and seems to have the ability to appear from nowhere.  The police are baffled by a recent spate of strange and unexplained murders, but Virginia notices the similarities between the events in the book and those in real life, and believes she can predict the killer's next move.  She offers this information to her boyfriend Richard (Rohner), who's a police detective, but Richard and his colleagues are a little skeptical (okay, a lot skeptical) and think her like a Snickers bar, you know, a bit nutty.  As the police investigation eventually goes nowhere, they become more inclined to listen to Virginia, but it may be already too late, as the killer's motives and intentions are revealed, along with a few interesting facts about the now deceased author Malcolm Brand.At a time when slasher films were run of the mill, I, Madman presented a clever and interesting story tinged with a bit of the gothic, but I think it ended up getting lost in the shuffle as the genre grew stale, as studios had bled it to the point of anemia (the lame trailer didn't help any).  The movie has the slight feel of a Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street) film (the mixing of realities), but director Tak&aacute;cs avoids Craven's style as a blueprint.  He knows how to set up a scene and creates a level of tension and suspense that kept me drawn into the story throughout.  I really liked how he handles the violence in the film, as it wasn't shown very often, but you always knew what was occurring.  There is a good deal of violence in the film, but it is rarely shown on screen.  An example of this is when Virginia is watching from her apartment window the killer stalking a victim in a building across the way.  The killer draws the shades, but the silhouettes of him and his victim are clear, as is the subsequent actions, and the audience is left to fill in the rest in their imagination.  There's another scene where a woman is getting attacked in her bathroom, and while we know what is going on, the violence is obscured as the scene is shot from behind the killer, but it's clear what's happening due to the killer's almost exaggerated movements.  I really liked the use of color and atmospheric elements throughout the film, as they helped create a feel, a mood that other films in the genre lacked, or tried to develop but failed miserably.  Also, his transitioning between time periods (the main character would often imagine herself as part of the stories she read) was flawless.  I thought the actors all did very well, most all playing their roles within character, never really hamming it up or going overboard.  The makeup on the killer (done by the person who played the role) was exceptional and quite gruesome, giving the character a realistic quality.  Were the flaws in the film?  There may have been, but I really didn't notice...I feel if the effort is there, and there's enough solid material and decent performances, I find myself willing to overlook certain superficial elements that may work against the movie.  I suppose if I were to pick on something it might be the stop motion work.  Most parts looked good, but there were one or two moments where it didn't feel entirely lifelike (given the probable limited budget of the film, picking on this would be an easy target).  Tak&aacute;cs usage of stop motion in his previous film, The Gate (1987), looked much the same as here, but since I liked that story as much as I did this one, it was easy to dismiss any perceived faults.My only disappointment of this film was in its' lackluster DVD release.  Presented is only the fullscreen format.  Why MGM couldn't have dug up the original wide screen format and included it also is beyond me.  The picture quality is decent, and the vibrant colors come through most of the time.  The only extra is the lame theatrical trailer.Cookieman108",4,"""I'll have your heart one way or another!""",1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,5733,"['Growing', 'up', '70', '80', 'was', 'constantly',

756331,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00009PY3P,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[13, 15]","I, MADMAN is, at best, a guilty pleasure ... with forced camp-ridden dialogue in a forced camp-ridden situation (a stunningly beautiful bookworm shucking her life away at some used book stores stumbles across an author who penned only two 'non-fiction' horror stories magically brings the demented author to life in a very Freddy Krueger-esque fashion) ... and you can't but help enjoy this harmless horror flick despite your best intentions.Yes, others have made mention of this, but the lead actress (Jenny Wright) is an absolute stunner to look at.  Sadly, the film is a bit dated with the wardrobe and hair choices, but, one she slimmed down to the bra and panties it's a very easy gaffe to dismiss. (snicker)The plot is relatively predictable (the script squeezes out a few surprises), and the premise isn't entirely original ... but the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" twist works very well in the limitations of the acting and effects.What's the real travesty is the fact that I, MADMAN -- if it enjoyed a theatrical release -- is only offered up in standard television ratio.  Some of the scenes might've played better given the 'look' of widescreen (especially some of the more suspenseful moments where our lead actress finds herself in the role of a lead actress -- a novel within a novel).

It had been some time since I'd seen it so I figured to give it another shot and see if the years had been at all kind to it. Well....yes and no.Others have recounted the story so I won't bother, but this is a rather cool and quirky tale. That it has the ""lurid, pulp"" sensibility and the retro 40s, 50s look in some scenes is a plus. And there are some cool touches throughout, like when the one victim gets scalped and the next shot shows a wig store in the background.

Whereas movies like ""Fright Night"" and ""The Lost Boys"" are entertaining, ""I, Madman"" leaves a lot to be desired. Basically, ""I, Madman"" is about a girl named Virginia, played by Jenny Wright who is a librarian and an avid reader. She decides to read some books by an author named Malcolm Brand. When she starts to read the book, ""I, Madman"", people start dying in similar ways as they do in the book. Could it be that we have a copycat killer? Or, do we have something even stranger and much sillier?To be quite frank about this movie, I did not like it. I can see where a particular audience would find this to be entertaining, but I just thought it was completely silly. There is virtually no way to take this movie seriously, and I certainly do not think it was intended as such. In the capacity of a comedy, I guess this movie would be okay if that is what you're looking for, but where is the horror?The acting is okay. Jenny Wright does a good job in her role, and that guy from ""Just One of the Guys"" did okay as well. However, the main problem with ""I, Madman"" is that it lacks the proper atmosphere and just does not have the requisite feel (for lack of a better word) to be an effective horror movie. I was hoping that this movie was going to be a horror movie, and this is the main reason I was disappointed in it. Yes, the movie does contain some violence, but the movie is styled in such a way that the viewer has to take this movie as tongue in cheek humor mostly.Even if not a true horror movie in the pure sense of the term, ""I, Madman"" simply is not a very good movie in my opinion. The story is uncompelling and absurd, the movie is barely able to keep one's interest as a mystery and/or thriller, and it is not quite a comedy, although it is tongue in cheek at times as I have suggested. It is not a horror movie for reasons I have already stated although it could be argued to be a light horror movie I suppose. Regardless of what it is, I was pretty much bored to death with the storyline of this movie. Indeed, the script could have been a lot better, and so could the execution as a whole. Finally, I thought the ending of the movie was absolutely ridiculous. Tastes obviously vary when it comes to a movie like this, but ""I, Madman"" simply did not appeal to me whatsoever.I would not recommend ""I, Madman"" to any serious horror movie fan or anyone else for that matter.

No, but who really cares?  Not I!  For me this movie is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food.

756335,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00009PY3P,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","This is interesting film that's been tip-off to me. I thought Canadian genre director Tibor Takacs, (more well-known for The Gate ), done a great job with this film. I, MADMAN is a loving salute to the days when movie monsters had hearts. For those who don't know this film is about a second-hand bookstore clerk Virginia Clayton becomes absorbed in the book `I, Madman' by Malcolm Brand. In the book the deranged, deformed Dr Kessler is obsessed with beautiful actress Anna Templar and kills victims, sewing part of each victim's face onto his own. But as Virginia continues to read, someone starts to emulate the killings in the book, targeting the people around her.Takacs includes some wonderfully grisly scenes in which he injects himself with Novocain and slices off his own facial features with a scalpel to send as love gifts to the heroine and then cuts up the people in her life and reattaches their facial parts to himself. There is a tragic Phantom of the Opera -like to the villain's love, although this doesn't perhaps get as much airing as it should. One would have preferred if Kessler were allowed to speak - what expression such a character would have.The atmosphere of this film is very good like others has mention here and the moody moments was inviting. The most intriguing aspect of the film is its double-structure, flipping between the plot of the book and the reading heroine's life with both heroines being played by the same actress. It is filled with all manner of fascinating small details - the way a rose knocked over in the book is mirrored in the real world; how when a tea kettle is placed on in the book one starts whistling in the real world even though we never saw Jenny Wright put one on when she entered the apartment. And although Kessler is given a nominally rational explanation, by the end of the story we are never entirely certain whether it was Brand or Kessler that has been pursuing the heroine - certainly the explanation that would rely on it being Brand offers no explanation of how the abovementioned incidents of meta-fictional synchronicity occurred.Less effective is Takacs's cast. Jenny Wright is obviously a sweet heart but seems distant and not really emotionally involved at times. Clayton Rohner lacks any conviction at all, looking hardly old enough to be out of college let alone a seasoned detective. The climax of the film is let down by Randall Cook's unconvincing stop motion animation. Takacs shoots in Canada - like many other Canadians he attempts to give the impression the film is American-made and in one wonderful false move we have a downtown bus that is just labeled `Los Angeles'.

Virginia not only sees the mad Malcolm Brand/Dr.Kessler (who supposedly died) but finds that he's committing mutilation murders around her as in the book. Of course no one believes her. The film has the old fashioned feel and look of a 50's pulp horror novel as well as neat fantasy sequences from the book with Wright as Anna, the book's heroine, being terrorized by Kessler. The murders are gruesome and lurid but not overly explicit. There's also a monster from the book (a creation of Kessler's) that appears in an early fantasy sequence and in the great climax. Randall William Cook (who also did the special effects) is wonderful as the enigmatic, black clad and facially disfigured Brand/Kessler. Wright is good as Virginia, Clayton Rohner is Virginia's detective boyfriend and comedian Stephanie Hodge is Virginia's laconic co-worker Mona.

756339,AN8M401S8Y6DA,B00009PY3P,Mike Liddell,"[1, 1]","I, Madman has great mood and atmosphere and is an all around fun horror film.  With 24 out of 26 reviews at this time being 5 or 4 stars, 12 each, I don't feel this is underrated as far as who views it, those who see it like it or love it.  However I don't think enough people, including myself (until recently) saw this film, this is definitely a hidden gem.  I highly recommend this film to horror fans looking a good fun time.So, back to the film and the great mood and atmosphere.  Virginia a bookstore clerk who is reading a horror book in her cozy homey apartment on her couch with a blanket while it thunders and rains outside, what a great set up, we as viewers are getting that warm cozy feeling ourselves.  She gets nervous but soon her police officer boyfriend comes over and turns on the lights and all is good again.  This gave me the feeling of when your a kid and you rent some horror films for a sleepover with friends maybe you exchange some stories about oh did you hear about this house or what happened to this kid, or perhaps your watching a double feature on cable when all of a sudden your mom comes in and starts vacuuming, essentially vacuuming the ghosts and it gives you a break from that rush you are getting.Virginia is not a teeny bopper she's an independent woman with as I said a nice warm apartment.  Her job at a bookstore is one of those antique mom and pop stores that would be rare to get a job at, not some Barnes and Noble where you work with 50 other people and nobody has a personality.  Virginia would have fit right in with the girls from Sex and the City.  She has one co worker in this Bookstore who works a lot and seems to really like her job as well, she's a funny and good person as are most of the people in this film, filled with positive vibes.  At this antique bookstore with great character her friend/co-worker even takes in a stray cat to add to the warmth of the shop.I refer to The Neverending Story as the kid is in the attic of his school while a storm is going on and reading a book by candlelight wrapped up in a blanket the story starts becoming real, as does this story.  Did I say real?So, like Virginia we get all ready to be cuddled up and scared, as she reads her horror book and we watch our horror film.  Sometimes a fun campy horror film gives you a warm feeling, it is just a film and you are nice and safe in your house, can give you a feeling of security with some excitement.  For Virginia her fun doesn't last long, and oh, what is that thing in the attic of the bookstore, the big box with holes in it for something or someone to breathe?I would have given I, Madman 5 stars but the ending gets a bit ridiculous, but that's fine this is a fun movie from start to finish with great atmosphere and mood with likable good characters who we root for.  A great 80s slasher horror movie.  So if your gonna have a little horror film marathon with some friends or a significant other get a blanket, dim the lights, wait for a thunder storm , pop some popcorn, and make I, Madman the first one you watch to set the mood right for some good fun scares.",4,"4.5 Stars.

One can tell that this movie was a labor of love, if not from the actors themselves, then from those behind the scenes. Jenny Wright is hit or miss in her scenes, as is Clayton Rohner. Not that this really detracts from the movie, they both do an adequate job. The real star of this show is the &quot;Madman&quot; himself, Randall William Cook. Cook, (Dr. Kessler/Malcomb Brand?) steals every scene he is in. There has not been, in my opinion, a villian of his caliber since Dr. Hannibal Lector. Now, about the DVD itself. There are no extras other than one movie trailer, which bills the movie as &quot;Hardcover,&quot; and subtitles in French, English, and Spanish. If you want to watch an innovative movie that is rich on suspense, with a good portion of horror, buy this movie. You will not be disappointed.
