I happened across this movie by chance earlier tonight, and something made me stop and watch it. There were a couple of times when I turned away, but I found myself turning back to it, and actually starting to care about what happened. I even found myself smiling at the end, which was unexpected! For a stupid, run-of-the-mill modern comedy, this was pretty good. It's not ever going to be on my list of favorites, but I would not be adverse to watching it again. Good for those times when I don't really want to think too hard about what I am watching, but I still want to feel good at the end of it.",4,Much better than I thought it would be.,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,690,"['Normally', 'hate', 'types', 'comedies', 'finding', 'be', 'too', 'stupid', 'sit', 'happened', 'movie', 'chance', 'earlier', 'tonight', 'something', 'made', 'stop', 'watch', 'were', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'turned', 'away', 'found', 'turning', 'back', 'actually', 'starting', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'found', 'smiling', 'end', 'was', 'unexpected', 'stupid', 'run-of-the-mill', 'modern', 'comedy', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'list', 'favorites', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'adverse', 'watching', 'again', 'Good', 'times', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'what', 'am', 'watching', 'still', 'want', 'feel', 'good', 'end']",The Brothers Solomon

1114195,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000XJ5TOA,Christopher Culver,"[0, 4]","In THE BROTHERS SOLOMON, John (Will Forte) and Dean (Will Arnett) are two siblings brought up isolated in the Arctic by their widower father (Lee Majors). Returning to civilization as adults, they are baffled by the dating scene. Hilarity is meant to ensue when their father lapses into a coma and they decide to fulfill his dream of a grandchild before it is too late. Unfortunately, THE BROTHERS SOLOMON is one of the most notable bombs of the last few years, and you're unlikely to find it a worthwhile experience.The camaradery between the two brothers is similar to DUMB AND DUMBER, but laughs are even fewer. The maturity level here is so low--among the sparse gags is a lot of bathroom humour--that one might believe this film intended for a less than adult audience, but any plot where artificial insemination has a key doesn't seem likely to target a young demographic. I got this movie because I enjoyed Will Arnett's work on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT and in an infamous Human Giant sketch where he plays a hyperbolic pervert ultimately killed by a sex machine. His acting here is similar to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, and may not be all that great, but he's so much better than Will Forte, one of the most unversatile and unlikeable comedians ever cast on Saturday Night Live.Just as the first film adaption of the Fantastic Four, the low-budget production of 1994, was made only to keep a hold on the rights and was never intended to be seen, I really wonder if THE BROTHERS SOLOMON was produced to give some secret boost to the parties involved even if it were a box office flop.",1,Bad in a way that makes you suspect an ulterior motive,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,1582,"['THE', 'BROTHERS', 'SOLOMON', 'John', 'Will', 'Forte', 'Dean', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'are', 'two', 'siblings', 'brought', 'up', 'isolated', 'Arctic', 'widower', 'father', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Returning', 'civilization', 'adults', 'are', 'baffled', 'dating', 'scene', 'Hilarity', 'meant', 'ensue', 'when', 'father', 'coma', 'decide', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'grandchild', 'too', 'late', 'Unfortunately', 'THE', 'BROTHERS', 'SOLOMON', 'one', 'most', 'notable', 'bombs', 'last', 'few', 'years', ""'re"", 'unlikely', 'find', 'worthwhile', 'experience.The', 'camaradery', 'two', 'brothers', 'similar', 'DUMB', 'AND', 'DUMBER', 'laughs', 'are', 'even', 'fewer', 'maturity', 'level', 'here', 'so', 'low', 'sparse', 'gags', 'lot', 'bathroom', 'humour', 'one', 'might', 'believe', 'film', 'intended', 'less', 'adult', 'audience', 'plot', 'where', 'artificial', 'insemination', 'key', ""n't"", 'seem', 'likely', 'target', 'young', 'demographic', 'got', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'work', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'infamous', 'Human', 'Giant', 'sketch', 'where', 'hyperbolic', 'pervert', 'ultimately', 'killed', 'sex', 'machine', 'acting', 'here', 'similar', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Will', 'Forte', 'one', 'most', 'unversatile', 'unlikeable', 'comedians', 'ever', 'cast', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live.Just', 'first', 'film', 'adaption', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'low-budget', 'production', '1994', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'keep', 'hold', 'rights', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'really', 'wonder', 'BROTHERS', 'SOLOMON', 'was', 'produced', 'give', 'secret', 'boost', 'parties', 'involved', 'even', 'were', 'box', 'office', 'flop']",The Brothers Solomon

1114204,A3IC02PU1BELQ1,B000XJ5TOA,Matthew Pearson,"[0, 0]","The comparisons to Dumb and Dumber just don't make sense-- I suppose, though, anyone who uses D&Der; as a benchmark for a funny movie is likely to have different tastes than I, so maybe that is one reason that I don't see this film as existing in the same sphere as the other. This isn't a movie about people who are flat-out dumb-- they are ""home school Ph.D.s,"" which is a great joke in itself, but their teacher, their father, is presented as a competent, brilliant, and highly productive man. In the first few minutes of the movie they receive a call from a research facility in Antarctica asking for a report on the analysis of some ice core samples, and in a brief montage we see them generate the report quickly and efficiently. So these aren't your run-of-the-mill dumb guys like Dumb and Dumber.They have extreme *social* retardation so the sort of humor that we see isn't as broad as, say, people being froze together by urine. I'm not saying that this is high-brow stuff but this isn't the movie to turn to if you want to see people being generally stupid, injuring themselves humorously, etc. They know how to problem solve as seen by their 'baby proofing' of their apartment and the diaper training sequence and several others. Even the thing with plane works, it's just wildly impractical. So they aren't stupid per se, they are actually intelligent and creative but have no cognitive apparatus to evaluate the practicality of their ideas and, we can assume, because of their isolated upbringing, have very poorly developed social cognition. They don't exactly fit a comedic archetype so maybe it's unappealing that way and comes off as a failed Dumb and Dumber rehash, but their idiocy is far more complex :)Anyway, I really did enjoy the heck out of this movie and have watched it several times and seems far *less* cheap than Dumb and Dumber because of the complexity involved in making people dumb in this way.Also, the music is outstanding.

1114213,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000XJ5TOA,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[5, 7]","The unequivocal epitome of absurdity, The Brothers Solomon is equal parts stunning hilarity and eyebrow-raising ridiculousness. With a mind-bogglingly offbeat sense of ""Dumb and Dumber"" humor, this film introduces such sustained socially-inept insanity by its unpredictably bizarre lead characters that it is constantly difficult to predict where it's all going. Despite the berserk brothers' insensibilities, this madcap farce manages to be entertaining and different from the recent slew of R-rated comedies.When their father lapses into a coma and Dean (Will Forte) and John (Will Arnett) Solomon learn that his only regret was not seeing a grandchild, the two brothers determine to acquire one no matter what the cost. After the romantically (and socially) inept twosome fail at wooing a mate to bear their child, they turn to other means of conception...Initially The Brothers Solomon appears to be an even wackier and more ludicrous version of ""Dumb and Dumber"", with a goofy duo of misfits who lack all cognitive thought processes. Early on, the film even steals a joke from the Farrelly Brothers' comedy, which is a huge mistake considering how widely recognized Harry and Lloyd's dialogue has become. But after the initial letdown, The Brother Solomon redeems itself with a nonstop barrage of hilariously awkward slapstick and unpredictable kookiness.Like Steve and Doug Butabi from ""A Night at the Roxbury"", the Solomons never let their spirits down, as if they're completely oblivious to their unwieldy social shortcomings. Their chipper attitude remains constant, even when they disagree, and it casts a bizarre sense of satisfaction straight through to the moronic conclusion. To say that the events in the film are even remotely believable or sensible would be a gross exaggeration, yet one has to appreciate the inane degree of preposterousness the film achieves with its extremely over-the-top comedy.From picking out a pornographic magazine at a sperm bank (they struggle over a copy of Indigenous Weekly), to a candlelit hallway dinner, to ""kickass"" parenting training involving hiding and mistreating baby dolls, to stalking children at a playground, the absurd gimmicks and slapstick the brothers employ is surprisingly entertaining. The entire film tests the limits to which imbecilic comedy can be pushed, and once that line is crossed, they continue forward into unknown territories of illogicality. Puppetry-based sex training and friendship-simulation aside, The Brothers Solomon is utterly pointless and largely trivial, and yet somehow the all new lows of intelligence make for an unusually high amount of laughs.Reaching unforeseen heights in creative absurdity and comedic eccentricity, The Brothers Solomon appears uninhibited by stereotypical comedy output. The humor on display is a seldom seen blend of disturbing mockery and playful stupidity that is ultimately hit or miss. But when it succeeds, it does so with masterful relish creating simultaneous shock and laugh-out-loud silliness. Airplane banners, pedophilia, and infant abuse never looked so funny.- The Massie Twins",3,The Brothers Solomon Movie Review,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,3109,"['unequivocal', 'epitome', 'absurdity', 'Brothers', 'Solomon', 'equal', 'parts', 'stunning', 'hilarity', 'eyebrow-raising', 'ridiculousness', 'mind-bogglingly', 'offbeat', 'sense', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'humor', 'film', 'introduces', 'such', 'sustained', 'socially-inept', 'insanity', 'unpredictably', 'bizarre', 'lead', 'characters', 'constantly', 'difficult', 'predict', 'where', 'going', 'berserk', 'brothers', 'insensibilities', 'madcap', 'farce', 'be', 'entertaining', 'different', 'recent', 'slew', 'R-rated', 'comedies.When', 'father', 'coma', 'Dean', 'Will', 'Forte', 'John', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Solomon', 'learn', 'only', 'regret', 'was', 'not', 'seeing', 'grandchild', 'two', 'brothers', 'determine', 'acquire', 'one', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'romantically', 'socially', 'inept', 'twosome', 'fail', 'wooing', 'mate', 'bear', 'child', 'turn', 'other', 'means', 'conception', 'Initially', 'Brothers', 'Solomon', 'be', 'even', 'wackier', 'more', 'ludicrous', 'version', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'goofy', 'duo', 'misfits', 'who', 'lack', 'cognitive', 'thought', 'processes', 'Early', 'film', 'even', 'joke', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'comedy', 'huge', 'mistake', 'considering', 'how', 'widely', 'recognized', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', 'dialogue', 'become', 'initial', 'letdown', 'Brother', 'Solomon', 'nonstop', 'barrage', 'hilariously', 'awkward', 'slapstick', 'unpredictable', 'kookiness.Like', 'Steve', 'Doug', 'Butabi', 'A', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'Solomons', 'never', 'let', 'spirits', 'down', ""'re"", 'completely', 'oblivious', 'unwieldy', 'social', 'shortcomings', 'chipper', 'attitude', 'constant', 'even', 'when', 'disagree', 'bizarre', 'sense', 'satisfaction', 'straight', 'moronic', 'conclusion', 'say', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'sensible', 'would', 'be', 'gross', 'exaggeration', 'yet', 'one', 'appreciate', 'inane', 'degree', 'preposterousness', 'film', 'extremely', 'over-the-top', 'comedy.From', 'picking', 'out', 'pornographic', 'magazine', 'sperm', 'bank', 'struggle', 'copy', 'Indigenous', 'Weekly', 'candlelit', 'hallway', 'dinner', 'kickass', 'parenting', 'training', 'involving', 'hiding', 'mistreating', 'baby', 'dolls', 'stalking', 'children', 'playground', 'absurd', 'gimmicks', 'slapstick', 'brothers', 'employ', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'entire', 'film', 'limits', 'imbecilic', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'pushed', 'once', 'line', 'crossed', 'continue', 'forward', 'unknown', 'territories', 'illogicality', 'Puppetry-based', 'sex', 'training', 'friendship-simulation', 'aside', 'Brothers', 'Solomon', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'largely', 'trivial', 'yet', 'somehow', 'new', 'lows', 'intelligence', 'make', 'unusually', 'high', 'amount', 'laughs.Reaching', 'unforeseen', 'heights', 'creative', 'absurdity', 'comedic', 'eccentricity', 'Brothers', 'Solomon', 'uninhibited', 'stereotypical', 'comedy', 'output', 'humor', 'display', 'seldom', 'seen', 'blend', 'disturbing', 'mockery', 'playful', 'stupidity', 'ultimately', 'hit', 'miss', 'when', 'so', 'masterful', 'relish', 'creating', 'simultaneous', 'shock', 'laugh-out-loud', 'silliness', 'Airplane', 'banners', 'pedophilia', 'infant', 'abuse', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'funny.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",The Brothers Solomon
