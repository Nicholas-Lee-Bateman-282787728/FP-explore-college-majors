He was an artistic storyteller; a talent revered and required. Through MYTHOS I Campbell begins to weave all religions/philosophies together in order to provide the viewer not with instruction, but with doorways to discover their own spiritualism. As Mark Twain consistently directed; everyone should develop his or her own religion. Through MYTHOS I & II the viewer is walked through many philosophies, their development and how to develop one's own.Thought stimuli are vital to human spiritual development and Mr. Campbell provided the tour through space and time. Not once does he impose his informative lectures, but instead opens the flower of possibilities one petal at a time. For me it was Campbell's books that spontaneously combusted my spiritual catharsis. In conjunction with a plethora of writers and artists I methodically developed through fiction not ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces"" but The HEROINE with multiple countenances through my 4 novels guaranteed to charge a new and improved attitude:Hear the Calliope: A sentimental journey on the Earth RideLegacy: Let the games begin (Volume 2)Reason Void of Reason: Spirituality Honeymoon Style (Volume 3)BREATHE: Noumenon (Volume 4)",5,Metaphysics,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,1270,"['secret', 'impact', 'Joesph', 'Campbell', 'work', 'had', 'listeners', 'was', 'artistic', 'storyteller', 'talent', 'revered', 'required', 'MYTHOS', 'Campbell', 'weave', 'religions/philosophies', 'together', 'order', 'provide', 'viewer', 'not', 'instruction', 'doorways', 'discover', 'own', 'spiritualism', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'consistently', 'directed', 'everyone', 'should', 'develop', 'own', 'religion', 'MYTHOS', 'II', 'viewer', 'walked', 'many', 'philosophies', 'development', 'how', 'develop', 'one', 'own.Thought', 'stimuli', 'are', 'vital', 'human', 'spiritual', 'development', 'Mr.', 'Campbell', 'provided', 'tour', 'space', 'time', 'Not', 'once', 'impose', 'informative', 'lectures', 'instead', 'flower', 'possibilities', 'one', 'petal', 'time', 'was', 'Campbell', 'books', 'spontaneously', 'combusted', 'spiritual', 'catharsis', 'conjunction', 'plethora', 'writers', 'artists', 'methodically', 'developed', 'fiction', 'not', 'Hero', 'Thousand', 'Faces', 'HEROINE', 'multiple', 'countenances', '4', 'novels', 'guaranteed', 'charge', 'new', 'improved', 'attitude', 'Hear', 'Calliope', 'sentimental', 'journey', 'Earth', 'RideLegacy', 'Let', 'games', 'begin', 'Volume', '2', 'Reason', 'Void', 'Reason', 'Spirituality', 'Honeymoon', 'Style', 'Volume', '3', 'BREATHE', 'Noumenon', 'Volume', '4']","Joseph Campbell - Mythos, Vol. 1: The Shaping of Our Mythic Tradition"

Campbell explains the similarities between all world religions skillfully and shows the underlying themes that connect us all. In the face of this our petty world squabbles seem infantile. This should be taught in every school, but until that day comes I will simply teach it here in my home. I am sure we will be all the better for for it. This is, for now, secret knowledge. Hopefully as time goes on more and more people will stumble upon it and his ideas will become familiar to more of us. His other books, DVDs, and audio CDs are all worth looking into or buying. Many of his ideas stem from concepts Jung theorized. Campbell takes much of it further and is easier to read. Jung often goes off the deep end and loses his way. Campbell is wholly consistent and weaves an intricate web of understanding for anyone who cares to grow. His works, besides bringing greater understanding to us about the world we live in and the conscious world we inhabit, can also be used to further help inspire and lead with mythological writing. I myself love to write fiction and have found his works invaluable beyond anything else. George Lucas used his book ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces"" to help him write Star Wars. It is no secret why the films resonate so well all around the world as a result. The underlying themes can be unlocked through reading Campbell's works.",5,Great,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,1458,"['anyone', 'who', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'must', 'have', 'addition', 'collection', 'Campbell', 'similarities', 'world', 'religions', 'skillfully', 'underlying', 'themes', 'connect', 'face', 'petty', 'world', 'seem', 'infantile', 'should', 'be', 'taught', 'school', 'day', 'will', 'simply', 'teach', 'here', 'home', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'now', 'secret', 'knowledge', 'Hopefully', 'time', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'stumble', 'ideas', 'will', 'become', 'familiar', 'more', 'other', 'books', 'DVDs', 'audio', 'CDs', 'are', 'worth', 'looking', 'buying', 'Many', 'ideas', 'stem', 'concepts', 'Jung', 'theorized', 'Campbell', 'much', 'further', 'easier', 'read', 'Jung', 'often', 'deep', 'end', 'way', 'Campbell', 'wholly', 'consistent', 'intricate', 'web', 'understanding', 'anyone', 'who', 'grow', 'works', 'bringing', 'greater', 'understanding', 'world', 'live', 'conscious', 'world', 'inhabit', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'used', 'further', 'help', 'inspire', 'lead', 'mythological', 'writing', 'love', 'write', 'fiction', 'have', 'found', 'works', 'invaluable', 'anything', 'else', 'George', 'Lucas', 'used', 'book', 'Hero', 'Thousand', 'Faces', 'help', 'write', 'Star', 'Wars', 'secret', 'why', 'films', 'resonate', 'so', 'well', 'world', 'result', 'underlying', 'themes', 'can', 'be', 'unlocked', 'reading', 'Campbell', 'works']","Joseph Campbell - Mythos, Vol. 1: The Shaping of Our Mythic Tradition"
1072928,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000PUB2AC,Enjolras,"[5, 5]","The Mythos series is one of the better Joseph Campbell DVDs I've watched. It's simply him presenting a lecture, but that's as it should be. And what a great lecturer he is. He manages to engage you as a viewer even though you're not in the room with him. He exudes a passion and joy for his subject. Campbell also presents his material in a methodical order, going from Western to Eastern traditions. This allows him to present his work - including controversial views - as he sees fit, not as some interviewer asks him.This series is ""hosted"" by Susan Sarandon, and while her comments aren't particularly informative or useful they're few and far between. 90-95% of each episode is Joseph Campbell with no other voices. I suspect Sarandon was thrown in because some marketing exec thought it would appeal to ""dumb Americans.""",5,Joseph Campbell unfiltered,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,826,"['Mythos', 'series', 'one', 'better', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'simply', 'presenting', 'lecture', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'great', 'lecturer', 'engage', 'viewer', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'room', 'passion', 'joy', 'subject', 'Campbell', 'also', 'material', 'methodical', 'order', 'going', 'Western', 'Eastern', 'traditions', 'present', 'work', 'including', 'controversial', 'views', 'fit', 'not', 'interviewer', 'him.This', 'series', 'hosted', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'comments', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'informative', 'useful', ""'re"", 'few', 'far', '90-95', '%', 'episode', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'other', 'voices', 'suspect', 'Sarandon', 'was', 'thrown', 'marketing', 'exec', 'thought', 'would', 'appeal', 'dumb', 'Americans']","Joseph Campbell - Mythos, Vol. 1: The Shaping of Our Mythic Tradition"

I am very pleased to have these  excellent reproductions of Mr Campbell's lectures. Thank you to the Foundation and all who put these discs together.The only flaw, as I see it, is the use of Susan Sarando as narrator. Two items stick out in my mind: she should learn how to pronounce ""Jung."" And she should refer to Mr Campbell as such not as ""Joe or Campbell.""This woman spoils the theme of the seminars because she apparently knows very little about Mythology. In addition, she apparently thinks that she is on the same level as Mr. Campbell.Why is she sitting curled up on a chair? Doesn't she know how to sit in a chair?Susan Sarando is the reason I rated these wonderful seminars as four.Thank you Amazon for carrying Joseph Campbell's material. I had all of his books, but they were destroyed in the September, 2011 flood in New York.
