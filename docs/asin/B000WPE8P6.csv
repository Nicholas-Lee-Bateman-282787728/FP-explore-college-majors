(joke) I look forward to more of his works in the future-- he doesn't need to go on the road any more, he merits a late night talk show after Conan O'Brian because that's when the winos wake up after falling asleep in front of their TV sets. (unjoke) He's worth listening to again and again.  I loved his (three words/phrases linked together for the punchline) the most in his monologue (What's the word to describe that punchline concept?).",5,Exceptional Talent...,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,572,"['Hilarious', 'envelope', 'pushing', 'reading', 'audience', 'impeccable', 'material', 'as', 'edgy', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'comedy', 'bits', 'joke', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'works', 'future', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'road', 'more', 'late', 'night', 'talk', 'show', 'Conan', ""O'Brian"", 'when', 'winos', 'wake', 'up', 'falling', 'asleep', 'front', 'TV', 'sets', 'unjoke', 'worth', 'listening', 'again', 'again', 'loved', 'three', 'words/phrases', 'linked', 'together', 'punchline', 'most', 'monologue', 'What', 'word', 'describe', 'punchline', 'concept']",Dave Attell: Captain Miserable

I've been a fan of Dave's since his Insomniac show and his first stand-up on Comedy Central. This is adult humor and some may be put off by Dave's brand of humor......I think he's hilarious! Grab some beer and some friends and get ready to laugh your A$$ off! The DVD looks and sounds great and it has some very funny, but short extra material. I would have loved to have the Comedy Central stand-up on here as a bonus, but two different companies so, I guess not.",5,GREAT SET FROM THIS HILARIOUS COMEDIAN!,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,540,"['Dave', 'Attell', 'one', 'best', 'comedians', 'around', 'set', 'very', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Dave', 'Insomniac', 'show', 'first', 'stand-up', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'adult', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'Dave', 'brand', 'humor', 'think', 'hilarious', 'Grab', 'beer', 'friends', 'get', 'ready', 'laugh', 'A', 'DVD', 'great', 'very', 'funny', 'short', 'extra', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'stand-up', 'here', 'bonus', 'two', 'different', 'companies', 'so', 'guess', 'not']",Dave Attell: Captain Miserable

He's a master technician of stand-up comedy and this is a must buy for any Dave Attell fan.After seeing his half-hour special on Comedy Central, I was hooked. However, there weren't many live performances caught on tape. The performances that were available were so censored and rushed a lot of the jokes lost their impact.Then came his CD release, ""Skanks for the Memories..."" which is probably the best Dave Attell set, period.He also has a DVD available on his website called ""Hey, You're Mouth's Not Pregnant!"" which is a live club performance in the South. It's a good club performance with mostly new material and some cool DVD extras. The production is obviously self-produced, but it's still a solid and funny set.I've seen Dave three times in the past two years. This latest release, ""Captain Miserable,"" is comprised of about 85% new material. It's just amazing to watch this man work. He bounces from topic to topic; from drugs to anal sex to pedophilia. The jokes are constructed so perfectly and his delivery is unequalled.There's a reason why other stand-up comics will end their sets early just to catch Dave do a midnight set at Caroline's. In short, he's the comedian's comedian. He was born to do stand-up comedy and this special really highlights exactly how honed his craft has become.",5,Master Comedian at Work,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1387,"[""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tell', 'how', 'funny', 'master', 'technician', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'must', 'buy', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'fan.After', 'seeing', 'half-hour', 'special', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'was', 'hooked', 'However', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'live', 'performances', 'caught', 'tape', 'performances', 'were', 'available', 'were', 'so', 'censored', 'rushed', 'lot', 'jokes', 'lost', 'impact.Then', 'came', 'CD', 'release', 'Skanks', 'Memories', 'probably', 'best', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'set', 'period.He', 'also', 'DVD', 'available', 'website', 'called', 'Hey', ""'re"", 'Mouth', 'Not', 'Pregnant', 'live', 'club', 'performance', 'South', 'good', 'club', 'performance', 'mostly', 'new', 'material', 'cool', 'DVD', 'extras', 'production', 'obviously', 'self-produced', 'still', 'solid', 'funny', 'set.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dave', 'three', 'times', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'latest', 'release', 'Captain', 'Miserable', 'comprised', 'about', '85', '%', 'new', 'material', 'just', 'amazing', 'watch', 'man', 'work', 'topic', 'topic', 'drugs', 'anal', 'sex', 'pedophilia', 'jokes', 'are', 'constructed', 'so', 'perfectly', 'delivery', 'reason', 'why', 'other', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'will', 'end', 'sets', 'early', 'just', 'catch', 'Dave', 'do', 'midnight', 'set', 'Caroline', 'short', 'comedian', 'comedian', 'was', 'born', 'do', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'special', 'really', 'highlights', 'exactly', 'how', 'honed', 'craft', 'become']",Dave Attell: Captain Miserable
