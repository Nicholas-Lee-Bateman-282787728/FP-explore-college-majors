Ritter was the heart and backbone of this show and without him - this sitcom was never the same. Ritter is only in the first 3 episodes and it is sad to go back and watch, he was such a dynamic force. James Garner and David Spade were brought in to revamp the show, I like Garner - but dislike Spade (he's just not funny!).

But the cast pulled together a decent season, and while I agree with the studio that it wasn't worth carrying farther than this, this season paid fitting tribute to John Ritter after his passing.  They didn't try to sneak in a replacement, rather acknowledged that he died, and showed a family dealing with the loss of their father figure intensely in the first part of the season, and intermittently throughout.

Ritter had completed filming the first three season 2 episodes of ABC's 8SR. He was working on the fourth episode when he suddenly collapsed on the set(suffering a massive heart attack) and was taken to Providence Medical Center,where he was born,across the street from the Burbank,CA studio. The 54-year-old television legend,remembered for his starring roles on ABC's THREE'S COMPANY and CBS's HEARTS AFIRE,died in the evening of 9/11/03,the very same day his and wife,fellow actress Amy Yasbeck's daughter Stella turned 5. Ritter was about a week shy of his 55th birthday and the couple's 4th wedding anniversary. In fact,Ritter was a day shy of Yasbeck's 41st birthday. Anyway,the newly widowed Cate Hennessy(MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN veteran Katey Sagal) rules the household and solely supports her and sportswriter Paul's(Ritter) three teenage children Bridget(Kaley Cuoco),Kerry""Care Bear""(Amy Davidson) and Rory(Martin Spanjers). It was written that Paul had dropped dead of a heart attack while shopping at a supermarket. He was supposed to come back in time that morning to drive the kids to school.

All the actors meshed perfectly.  Stories were funny, often touching.  Writing was great.  All the cast did a great job playing off of each other.  You could see a real bond and it came through in the show.The passing of John Ritter was a great loss to show business overall, but was a death blow to the series.  I thought they did a fantastic job with the episodes dealing with his passing, was both funny and heartbreaking at the same time.  A very fitting tribute.  And the DVD is worth it just for the beginning of the season that had the episodes with John and the episodes that dealt with his death.  But unfortunately they weren't able to recover well.James Garner was a good addition, did a enjoyable job of the father/grandfather trying to help bring a male presence to the family, but the addition of David Spade for me was the death knell.  I've never been impressed with his ""acting"" and it was not at all good here.  They spent too much time focusing on him, and the series suffered terribly for that.

I am not saying season two is god-awful, I think it's on par with season one.The characters have started to develop more, Bridget is more of a character than a stereotype, Kerry goes from a bitchy sarcastic redhead to a more nicer person, Rory goes from a tattling pain in the butt to an oddball child. Cate herself goes from the stereotypical working mother, to a mother who actually has time for her kids. James Garner is hilarious as Cate's father Jim Egan, a Korean war veteran who can be just like Paul (Ritter). Jim often butt heads with C.J. (played hilariously by David Spade) who is a wise-ass and a man child. Among this season you will see Jim often trying to swing at C.J. with his cane.

Rest in peace to a wonderful man, but his performances will live on forever.The first season of ""8 Simple Rules"" makes it a fantastic family show, and with the second, I thought ABC would drop it because of John's death.Much to my surprise, they incorporated John's death INTO the show, rather than just ending it.  Whether they thought the show could go on, or felt it was time for a sitcom/drama to present death in a real light, I don't know.  Except they did, kept a straight face, and re-tooled the show, and the excellence remains...After a period of mourning, for which those episodes do not have a laugh track, they continued and brought in veteran actor James Garner, who proved to be an instant hit with the audience.  His presence adds a new chemistry, which clearly works.Then they added David Space, a move that surprised me, who turns out a BRILLIANT performance to a cast that already had genuine chemistry -- a show that lost John, but rebounded with James and David.  It was thought out well and it showed.  Plus, the show being a 'family' show presented a topic that does happen in real life.  Big kudos.This show is well-written and well-acted.  By all.  There is substance, depth, and wit that transcends what could have been sloppily-written, cornball comedy.  It's that wit that also helps to elevate what is already a great series.My favorite episode from this season is a tie, between ""Get Real"" (David Spade's introduction where he's set up as being an irresponsible oaf), and ""Consequences"" (the very special drug use episode).  As with the season in general, those two episodes are very sharply written but stand out because they transcend ""typical"" sitcom moments.  No easy task.Highly recommended to all, it's a shame ABC canceled this show after its third year (by placing it before a REALLY bad show on Friday nights), but that's another story...",5,A rarity; a show loses its lead male figure by death but adapts and incorporates it.,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,1949,"['John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'one', 'heck', 'actor', 'death', 'was', 'too', 'premature', 'Rest', 'peace', 'wonderful', 'man', 'performances', 'will', 'live', 'forever.The', 'first', 'season', '8', 'Simple', 'Rules', 'fantastic', 'family', 'show', 'second', 'thought', 'ABC', 'would', 'drop', 'John', 'death.Much', 'surprise', 'incorporated', 'John', 'death', 'INTO', 'show', 'rather', 'just', 'ending', 'thought', 'show', 'could', 'go', 'felt', 'was', 'time', 'sitcom/drama', 'present', 'death', 'real', 'light', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'kept', 'straight', 'face', 're-tooled', 'show', 'excellence', 'period', 'mourning', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'laugh', 'track', 'continued', 'brought', 'veteran', 'actor', 'James', 'Garner', 'who', 'proved', 'be', 'instant', 'hit', 'audience', 'presence', 'new', 'chemistry', 'clearly', 'works.Then', 'added', 'David', 'Space', 'move', 'surprised', 'who', 'out', 'BRILLIANT', 'performance', 'cast', 'already', 'had', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'show', 'lost', 'John', 'rebounded', 'James', 'David', 'was', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'showed', 'show', 'being', ""'family"", 'show', 'presented', 'topic', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'kudos.This', 'show', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'substance', 'depth', 'wit', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sloppily-written', 'cornball', 'comedy', 'wit', 'also', 'elevate', 'what', 'already', 'great', 'series.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'tie', 'Get', 'Real', 'David', 'Spade', 'introduction', 'where', 'set', 'up', 'being', 'irresponsible', 'oaf', 'Consequences', 'very', 'special', 'drug', 'use', 'episode', 'season', 'general', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'sharply', 'written', 'stand', 'out', 'transcend', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'moments', 'easy', 'task.Highly', 'recommended', 'shame', 'ABC', 'canceled', 'show', 'third', 'year', 'placing', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'show', 'Friday', 'nights', 'story']",8 Simple Rules: Season 2
