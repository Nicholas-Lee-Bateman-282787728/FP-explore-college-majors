683635,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00005U8F4,,"[4, 4]","Yes the Americans were late for both World wars but they didn't half make an impact. Some have said that this is one of the few American films about WW 1 and I feel this type of film really ought to be encouraged. In actual fact the Americans have been making excellent WW1 films since Hollywood began including 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (3 versions), 'Sergeant York' the awful 'Fly Boys (that's the one with the lion and is like a dumbed up 'Pearl Harbor)and many more. The difference is this is new and is firmly set in the retelling of the horrors of war. And the Americans fired more shells on their first day in action than during the entire Civil War, so their commitment should never be underestimated.The plot is one which happened many times in the 'Great War' and that is a battalion goes forward believing it is supported on both flanks, alas they are not and due to a breakdown in communication they stay put and decide to battle it out despite facing a hopeless situation. It is based on actual events and it is lovely to see carrier pigeons being shown in action as they were vital, the French almost exclusively relied upon them at one point.The acting is all excellent and the plot unfolds in real time in that there are no flash backs which are often used to build empathy with the characters and the audience (i.e. they are not just soldiers but husbands, sons etc. That could lead to the charge of non character development, but the film does not suffer from this as the humanity is clear from the start. At 92 minutes long it flew by and for followers of war films and more explicitly WW 1 this is highly recommended and almost as good as the excellent 'Beneath Hill 60'Beneath Hill 60 [DVD] [2010] in terms of accuracy and compelling story line.",4,Review from across 'The Pond',1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,1773,"['Yes', 'Americans', 'were', 'late', 'World', 'wars', 'did', ""n't"", 'half', 'make', 'impact', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'few', 'American', 'films', 'WW', '1', 'feel', 'type', 'film', 'really', 'ought', 'be', 'encouraged', 'actual', 'fact', 'Americans', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'excellent', 'WW1', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'began', 'including', ""'All"", 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', '3', 'versions', ""'Sergeant"", 'York', 'awful', 'Boys', 'one', 'lion', 'dumbed', 'up', ""'Pearl"", 'Harbor', 'many', 'more', 'difference', 'new', 'firmly', 'set', 'retelling', 'horrors', 'war', 'Americans', 'fired', 'more', 'shells', 'first', 'day', 'action', 'entire', 'Civil', 'War', 'commitment', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'underestimated.The', 'plot', 'one', 'happened', 'many', 'times', ""'Great"", 'War', 'battalion', 'forward', 'believing', 'supported', 'flanks', 'are', 'not', 'due', 'breakdown', 'communication', 'stay', 'put', 'decide', 'battle', 'facing', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'lovely', 'see', 'carrier', 'pigeons', 'being', 'shown', 'action', 'were', 'vital', 'French', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'relied', 'one', 'point.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'real', 'time', 'are', 'flash', 'backs', 'are', 'often', 'used', 'build', 'empathy', 'characters', 'audience', 'i.e', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'soldiers', 'husbands', 'sons', 'etc', 'could', 'lead', 'charge', 'non', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'not', 'suffer', 'humanity', 'clear', 'start', '92', 'minutes', 'long', 'flew', 'followers', 'war', 'films', 'more', 'explicitly', 'WW', '1', 'highly', 'recommended', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'excellent', 'Hill', ""60'Beneath"", 'Hill', '60', '[', 'DVD', ']', '[', '2010', ']', 'terms', 'accuracy', 'compelling', 'story', 'line']",The Lost Battalion

The scene going across No Man's Land is a definite highlight as is a defense against German flamethrower assault. Rick Schroder as Whittlesey does a fine job invoking the conflict in his character whether the stand is worth it. Overall, a great depiction of American valor.One of the great quotes from the movie is by Major Whittlesey (played by Schroder) and sums up the American fighting man for all wars: ""You'll never know what they've been through, or what they can and can't do.

(And I knew instantly that this remake would be better than the 1919 version as it had sound, and not just someone at the piano).Major John Whittlesey played by Ricky Schroder commands a battalion of the 77th Division from New York. The division commander gives him an operation's order to attack through the Meuse Argonne Forest against the Germans. Whittlesey sets the theme by protesting the order as his unit is undersupplied in every conceivable way. He wants assurances that Americans and French will protect his flanks.  He agrees to the order but tells the general that he doubts if he will ever see his battalion again. The general mumbles to an aide after the major's departure that he will see what this New York lawyer is made of. The insinuation is transparent.The film wanted to stress the ethnicity of the players and the origin of a division.  They created foils in the characters of Lieutenant Leak (Jay Rodan), a Texan who couldn't pronounce their names, and an ""apple-knocker"" Pvt. Yoder (Rhys Miles Thomas) from Montana assigned to the regiment. You get to know the ethnicity of the characters as soon as you hear the poor Texan begin a roll call of the Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish and Chinese names. I began to find this part of the film overdirected or overdone like an explosive that fails to go off--a dud. The high point or low point of this, depending upon your point of view, is the smiling, captured Lt. Leak telling a German intelligent officer in a smiling southern drawl, ""What you got are a bunch of [ethnic slang] ... gangsters from New York City, and they'll never surrender--never."" The acting compensates for a script of modern slang such as ""fuggetaboutit,"" and ""knock yourself out,"" and a bunch of smiling, clean white teeth that looked like an Ipana commercial. Ricky Schroder, who was about thirty-one when this was filmed, still looks fifteen and slightly younger than Audie Murphy, in spite of (probably) an exhausted make-up department that racked up overtime trying to make him look older.The battle scenes are one of this film's highlights with the hand-held cameras being used right in front of the actors. It looks realistic without being gory. The sound effects are good with the exception of artillery fire that can never be faithfully replicated, but the pilot who starts his engine from the cockpit is inaccurate. No one turned the prop for him as was required with the technology of the day. The Germans were also described as Krauts, a term that didn't gain currency until WW II. Heinies and Huns were more common epithets for the enemy.What also came through in this movie was a certain chivalry that existed during this war. The American surrounded by German bayonets was captured rather than killed. The Germans treated their prisoners with every courtesy as Germans of two regimes later would rarely do.In real life, the Americans went into the attack on October 2, 1918 with approximately 465 men and were reinforced by a lost ""K"" Company that brought the number to 550. All were low on food, water, and ammunition. After constant sniper, machine gun, and mortar fire, infantry attacks and inaccurate American artillery that fell on them, the New Yorkers held their ground and defied the two options the Germans offered them--surrender or die. They were relieved after five days with only 194 men alive and unhurt. They did not surrender. The war to end all wars ended five weeks later.So, if you ever find yourself surrounded by the walls of your home with inclement weather beyond them, and war genre is your schtick (sorry), this is a drama that is well worth digging in to watch. The players are colorful and there are sporadic bursts of good script when it isn't ""cliched."" It was written by James Carabaltsos and over-directed by Russell Mulcahy.It will still be one of my favorite war movies.P. S. I recommend putting the name of Major Whittlesey in your search bar to find out more about his post war life and tragic end. He and Captains McMurtry and Holderman received the nation's highest award, the Medal of Honor for valor. Pvt. Krotoshinsky, Polish-Jewish immigrant, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.",4,"Pack Up Your DVD in Your Ol' Kit Bag and See, See, See",1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,4579,"['How', 'nice', 'find', 'surrounded', 'good', 'story', 'military', 'history', 'week', 'when', 'rain', 'never', 'seemed', 'end', 'colleague', 'provided', 'DVD', 'sat', 'down', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'forgotten', 'war', 'Great', 'War', 'entitled', 'Lost', 'Battalion', 'add', 'spirit', 'time', 'frame', 'scratchy', 'sounding', 'song', 'era', 'credits', 'start', 'film', 'knew', 'instantly', 'remake', 'would', 'be', 'better', '1919', 'version', 'had', 'sound', 'not', 'just', 'someone', 'piano', 'John', 'Whittlesey', 'played', 'Ricky', 'Schroder', 'battalion', '77th', 'Division', 'New', 'York', 'division', 'commander', 'operation', 'order', 'attack', 'Meuse', 'Argonne', 'Forest', 'Germans', 'Whittlesey', 'theme', 'protesting', 'order', 'unit', 'undersupplied', 'conceivable', 'way', 'assurances', 'Americans', 'French', 'will', 'protect', 'flanks', 'order', 'general', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'battalion', 'again', 'general', 'mumbles', 'aide', 'major', 'departure', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'New', 'York', 'lawyer', 'made', 'insinuation', 'transparent.The', 'film', 'wanted', 'stress', 'ethnicity', 'players', 'origin', 'division', 'created', 'foils', 'characters', 'Lieutenant', 'Leak', 'Jay', 'Rodan', 'Texan', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'pronounce', 'names', 'apple-knocker', 'Pvt', 'Yoder', 'Rhys', 'Miles', 'Thomas', 'Montana', 'assigned', 'regiment', 'get', 'know', 'ethnicity', 'characters', 'as', 'soon', 'hear', 'poor', 'Texan', 'begin', 'roll', 'call', 'Irish', 'Italian', 'Jewish', 'Polish', 'Chinese', 'names', 'began', 'find', 'part', 'film', 'overdirected', 'overdone', 'explosive', 'go', 'off', 'dud', 'high', 'point', 'low', 'point', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'smiling', 'captured', 'Lt', 'Leak', 'telling', 'German', 'intelligent', 'officer', 'smiling', 'southern', 'drawl', 'What', 'got', 'are', 'bunch', '[', 'ethnic', 'slang', ']', 'gangsters', 'New', 'York', 'City', ""'ll"", 'never', 'surrender', 'never', 'acting', 'script', 'modern', 'slang', 'such', 'fuggetaboutit', 'knock', 'out', 'bunch', 'smiling', 'clean', 'white', 'teeth', 'looked', 'Ipana', 'commercial', 'Ricky', 'Schroder', 'who', 'was', 'thirty-one', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'still', 'fifteen', 'slightly', 'younger', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'spite', 'probably', 'exhausted', 'make-up', 'department', 'racked', 'up', 'overtime', 'trying', 'make', 'look', 'older.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'one', 'film', 'highlights', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'being', 'used', 'right', 'front', 'actors', 'realistic', 'being', 'gory', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'exception', 'artillery', 'fire', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'faithfully', 'replicated', 'pilot', 'who', 'engine', 'cockpit', 'inaccurate', 'one', 'turned', 'prop', 'was', 'required', 'technology', 'day', 'Germans', 'were', 'also', 'described', 'Krauts', 'term', 'did', ""n't"", 'gain', 'currency', 'WW', 'II', 'Heinies', 'Huns', 'were', 'more', 'common', 'epithets', 'enemy.What', 'also', 'came', 'movie', 'was', 'certain', 'chivalry', 'existed', 'war', 'American', 'surrounded', 'German', 'bayonets', 'was', 'captured', 'rather', 'killed', 'Germans', 'treated', 'prisoners', 'courtesy', 'Germans', 'two', 'regimes', 'later', 'would', 'rarely', 'do.In', 'real', 'life', 'Americans', 'went', 'attack', 'October', '2', '1918', 'approximately', '465', 'men', 'were', 'reinforced', 'lost', 'K', 'Company', 'brought', 'number', '550', 'were', 'low', 'food', 'water', 'ammunition', 'constant', 'sniper', 'machine', 'gun', 'mortar', 'fire', 'infantry', 'attacks', 'inaccurate', 'American', 'artillery', 'fell', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'held', 'ground', 'defied', 'two', 'options', 'Germans', 'offered', 'surrender', 'die', 'were', 'relieved', 'five', 'days', 'only', '194', 'men', 'alive', 'unhurt', 'did', 'not', 'surrender', 'war', 'end', 'wars', 'ended', 'five', 'weeks', 'later.So', 'ever', 'find', 'surrounded', 'walls', 'home', 'inclement', 'weather', 'war', 'genre', 'schtick', 'sorry', 'drama', 'well', 'worth', 'digging', 'watch', 'players', 'are', 'colorful', 'are', 'sporadic', 'bursts', 'good', 'script', 'when', ""n't"", 'cliched', 'was', 'written', 'James', 'Carabaltsos', 'over-directed', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy.It', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'war', 'movies.P', 'S.', 'recommend', 'putting', 'name', 'Major', 'Whittlesey', 'search', 'bar', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'post', 'war', 'life', 'tragic', 'end', 'Captains', 'McMurtry', 'Holderman', 'received', 'nation', 'highest', 'award', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'valor', 'Pvt', 'Krotoshinsky', 'Polish-Jewish', 'immigrant', 'was', 'awarded', 'Distinguished', 'Service', 'Cross']",The Lost Battalion

683669,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005U8F4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","&quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; is the true story of the 77th &quot;Liberty&quot; Division from New York during World War I.  On October 2nd, 1918, five weeks before the end of the war, they advanced into the heavily wooded terrain of the Argonne Forest in France.  Although their advanced was supposed to be supported by French and other American troops, the 77th was the only Allied unit to achieve its objective.  As a result, the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot; was surrounded by the German army and constantly attacked for six days.  However, the group failed to surrender, despite being low on ammunition, food, and other supplies.  Before the battle the 77th had around 600 men, but only 200 would walk out from the Argonne Forest.There was a silent movie made about &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; in 1919, in which director Burton L. King used the soldiers themselves to film the story, which was more of a documentary re-enactment than a theatrical film.  It was not until 2001 that such a film telling the story of the 77th was finally produced.  Rick Schroder plays Maj. Charles White Whittlesey, the battalion commander and a New York City lawyer who thinks his group's assignment is a suicide mission.  Of course his concerns are dismissed, because if there is one iconic image of World War I infantry it is that of climbing out of trenches to be mowed down by enemy machine guns (e.g., &quot;Gallipoli&quot;).  Whittlesey's battalion is ordered to advance into the Argonne, and to take and hold their position at all cost.  With their lines of communication cut except for a handful of carrier pigeons and a few desperate efforts by American airplanes to locate and contact the surrounded unit, the men of the 77th do not really understand how desperate their plight is or that their efforts would be the key to breaking the German lines and leading to Armistice Day.The unit is made up of mostly young men from New York City, who look at their fellow soldiers who hail from places like Montana as if they were from another planet.  There is an element in the story of how combat forges a melting plot here, and there is a telling scene where one soldier explains that while he came from Poland he is now an American because he took the test and nobody gets to say that he is not.  It is left to Lt. Leak (Jay Rodan) to explain to a German intelligence officer: &quot;What you're up against Major, is a bunch of Mick, Pollack, Dago, and Jew boy gangsters from New York City. They'll never surrender. Never.&quot;  The German generals are used to the methodical approach of the French army and do not know what to make of the rash Americans, whose actions are deemed unpredictable if not evidence of outright madness.  These are officers and troops who complain about going on the mission in the first place, but who rise up in righteous indignation and anger when the Germans show up with flamethrowers.For once the use of hand-held cameras works to the advantage of the story when the technique is used to film the attacks across No Man's Land and in the Argonne Forest (although as a general rule the use of the technique combined with constant cutting from shot to shot in action movies is quickly driving me to distraction).  One of the strengths of the production is that most of the faces of the actors are unfamiliar (Phil McKee from &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; might is the obvious exception to prove the rule), so you have no problem thinking of them as the actual soldiers they are portraying.  The biggest weakness of the film is that the foreshadowing with regards to Whittlesey is a big heavy handed, as is the growing respect the Germans have for the American detachment they cannot obliterate.  The script overplays both of those understandably necessary elements.The DVD also includes a History Channel documentary on &quot;Dear Home: Letters from World War I,&quot; which combined archival film footage from the period and actual letters written by the Doughboys and nurses who fought in the war.  This is a nice complimentary piece to the movie, especially given how little most Americans know about what actually happened in the War to End All Wars.  If most Americans can name &quot;Sgt. York&quot; as a WWI movie they have seen that might be par, especially given how many other movies about the period are from the German perspective (e.g., &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front,&quot; &quot;The Blue Max&quot;).  The obvious reference point for most Americans will the story of the besieged 101st Airborne as Bastonge during World War II's Battle of the Bulge.  There are so few films about World War I that it is not surprising that when we actually have one like &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; they tend to stand out.That is also why so many fault the limited information provided at the end of this film telling us what happened to Whittlesey and some of the other key members of the 77th.  You do not have to do much research on this true story to learn that Whittlesey committed suicide a few years later, which lends a definite pathos to Schroeder's performance and his character's anguish over the idea of &quot;acceptable losses&quot; Gen. Robert Alexander (Michael Brandon) keeps harping.  But you can see how &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; combines the heroism associated with American soldiers in World War II movies with the lack of faith in American commanders that is a key theme in movies about the Vietnam War.  A nice documentary exploring the history of the 77th and how this helped end the war would have been a helpful addition, certainly much more than the biography and filmography of Rick Schroeder.",4,The almost forgotten story of the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot; of WWI,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,5653,"['quot', 'Lost', 'Battalion', 'quot', 'true', 'story', '77th', 'quot', 'Liberty',

683672,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B00005U8F4,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[149, 155]","In late 1918 WW1 was about to come to an end. The US, now fully involved in the war, participated in an offensive alongside the french in the Argonne forest. In typical first world war fashion, the modest gains of the offensive were ultimately lost as the allied forces simply withdrew back to their trenches. One battalion, however, comprised mostly of New Yorkers of the US 77th division, did not withdraw. Instead they advanced, held, and fought to the bitter end. This is the story of the lost battalion; the 308th.AE really got this one right. Wonderfully scripted and with lots of attention to historical detail and accuracy, this film really comes off as more than just an AE original, but something worthy of a trip to the theater had it been there. The movie opens with new recruits coming in before the offensive. The fresh troops are indoctrinated quickly into the frightening world of trench warfare. Rick Shroder does an amazing Job as the Major in command of the 308th. Having been a lawyer back in NYC, he has no real taste for battle, and struggles with his supperiors over the danger posed to his men by the over-ambitious objectives given to them.Once they are in the Argonne forest, and fail to retreat like thier comrads, they become unknowingly surrounded by the Germans. The commanders, amazed that the 308th is sitting right smack in the German center, decides to lie and tell them that the french are still on thier flank, and to hold at all costs. Thus begins a desperate fight for survival, as ammunition and food runs out, and as wave after wave of german counter attacks are repelled.As the bodies pile up we are given glimpses into the personalities of these brave men. Being mostly NYers, the troops are diverse--with the interaction of Italian, Jewish, polish, and other Americans creating an interesting dynamic that makes for both comedy and food for thought. The movie shows how an interesting transference occurs as the code of the streets, or neighborhood pride, than many NYC kids grow up with, lends itself heroically to the battlefield--not allowing for honor in surrender. The presence of a southerner thrown into the battalion adds a really interesting dynamic between the characters. I enjoy viewing the story as much as a commentary on national and cultural identity as a war movie.The acting throughout the movie is quite good, and special effects are gritty and realistic for a TV movie, without surrendering to the temptation to embellish. Lots of nice touches are added into this movie to make it a pleasure to watch and a tribute to the courage of the men, without glorifying the war itself or giving into the seductions of nationalism, although there's a distinct Americanism and bias pervading the film, to be sure.The Germans, for example, are unable to understand why this battalion has not withdrawn or surrendered as any normal unit in WW1 would do. At this point, the southerner of the battalion (who's been captured by the Germans) warns them that they are ""up against a bunch of New York City Gangsters"", who will never surrender. Finally, even a fearsome special unit of German storm troopers are repelled, and only a handful of the 308th are left when allied forces finally link up with them once more. The loss of the Argonne, puts the German line off balance, and contributes to the further advances that end the war. That an eventual German defeat may well have been inevitable at this point is neither mentioned nor is it really relevant; the main point being the war ended sooner due to this turn of events that it may have otherwise.I enjoyed this movie quite a bit as it shows both the futility of the war, and delves into the character of those fighting it. AE has managed to make a decent war film that is worthy of a place alongside many of the Hollywood classics of the genre.",5,Excellent!,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,3846,"['late', '1918', 'WW1', 'was', 'come', 'end', 'US', 'now', 'fully', 'involved', 'war', 'participated', 'offensive', 'alongside', 'french', 'Argonne', 'forest', 'typical', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'fashion', 'modest', 'gains', 'offensive', 'were', 'ultimately', 'lost', 'allied', 'forces', 'simply', 'withdrew', 'back', 'trenches', 'One', 'battalion', 'however', 'comprised', 'mostly', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'US', '77th', 'division', 'did', 'not', 'withdraw', 'Instead', 'advanced', 'held', 'fought', 'bitter', 'end', 'story', 'lost', 'battalion', '308th.AE', 'really', 'got', 'one', 'right', 'Wonderfully', 'scripted', 'lots', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'accuracy', 'film', 'really', 'off', 'more', 'just', 'AE', 'original', 'something', 'worthy', 'trip', 'theater', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'movie', 'new', 'recruits', 'coming', 'offensive', 'fresh', 'troops', 'are', 'indoctrinated', 'quickly', 'frightening', 'world', 'trench', 'warfare', 'Rick', 'Shroder', 'amazing', 'Job', 'Major', 'command', '308th', 'Having', 'been', 'lawyer', 'back', 'NYC', 'real', 'taste', 'battle', 'supperiors', 'danger', 'posed', 'men', 'over-ambitious', 'objectives', 'given', 'them.Once', 'are', 'Argonne', 'forest', 'fail', 'retreat', 'thier', 'comrads', 'become', 'unknowingly', 'surrounded', 'Germans', 'commanders', 'amazed', '308th', 'sitting', 'right', 'smack', 'German', 'center', 'lie', 'tell', 'french', 'are', 'still', 'thier', 'flank', 'hold', 'costs', 'Thus', 'desperate', 'fight', 'survival', 'ammunition', 'food', 'runs', 'out', 'wave', 'wave', 'german', 'counter', 'attacks', 'are', 'bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'are', 'given', 'glimpses', 'personalities', 'brave', 'men', 'Being', 'mostly', 'NYers', 'troops', 'are', 'diverse', 'interaction', 'Italian', 'Jewish', 'polish', 'other', 'Americans', 'creating', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'comedy', 'food', 'thought', 'movie', 'how', 'interesting', 'transference', 'code', 'streets', 'neighborhood', 'pride', 'many', 'NYC', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'heroically', 'battlefield', 'not', 'allowing', 'honor', 'surrender', 'presence', 'southerner', 'thrown', 'battalion', 'really', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'viewing', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'commentary', 'national', 'cultural', 'identity', 'war', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'TV', 'movie', 'surrendering', 'temptation', 'embellish', 'Lots', 'nice', 'touches', 'are', 'added', 'movie', 'make', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'tribute', 'courage', 'men', 'glorifying', 'war', 'giving', 'seductions', 'nationalism', 'distinct', 'Americanism', 'bias', 'pervading', 'film', 'be', 'sure.The', 'Germans', 'example', 'are', 'unable', 'understand', 'why', 'battalion', 'not', 'withdrawn', 'surrendered', 'normal', 'unit', 'WW1', 'would', 'do', 'point', 'southerner', 'battalion', 'who', 'been', 'captured', 'Germans', 'are', 'up', 'bunch', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Gangsters', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'surrender', 'Finally', 'even', 'fearsome', 'special', 'unit', 'German', 'storm', 'troopers', 'are', 'repelled', 'only', 'handful', '308th', 'are', 'left', 'when', 'allied', 'forces', 'finally', 'link', 'up', 'once', 'more', 'loss', 'Argonne', 'German', 'line', 'balance', 'further', 'advances', 'end', 'war', 'eventual', 'German', 'defeat', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'inevitable', 'point', 'mentioned', 'really', 'relevant', 'main', 'point', 'being', 'war', 'ended', 'sooner', 'due', 'turn', 'events', 'may', 'have', 'otherwise.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'futility', 'war', 'character', 'fighting', 'AE', 'managed', 'make', 'decent', 'war', 'film', 'worthy', 'place', 'alongside', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'classics', 'genre']",The Lost Battalion

683679,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B00005U8F4,Octavius,"[5, 5]","Russel Mulcahy's 2001 film based on the true story involving Major Whittlesey's brave defense of a key position in the middle of German lines in 1918.  An excellent film that is quite graphic for a TV film and very accurate.Although less people (especially civilians) were killed in WWI than WWII, it was more brutal and devastating on the battlefield than WWII for several reasons.  Unlike the mobile mechanized tactics of WWII, the Western Front was a static arrangement of complex trenches and bunkers covering over 500 miles between the English Channel and Switzerland.  Both strategic and tactical maneuvers were limited to full frontal infantry assaults against a heavily entrenched enemy creating nothing more than meat grinders for the attacking soldiers.  By the war's end, about 75% of the male population ages 17-35 in Germany and France was either dead or permanently disabled by the war. Of those who were injured, many were amputees, horribly maimed/disfigured, or suffering permanent pulmonary/neurological damage from exposure to gas. The suicide rate amongst veterans was also high after the war.  Gas was used freely by both sides and modern medicine was relatively a new discipline: the understanding of shock, trauma, and infections was limited; there was no penecilin, no blood transfusions, and no plasma.  Infections were treated mainly with alcohol and ether.The story, as the main reviewer says, is quite simple.  Whittier's batallion is ordered to take a hill in the middle of the German line and hold it until his flanks can catch up to him; he is ordered to stand until further orders and not retreat.  Unfortunately for Whittier's batallion, his flanks never caught up to him and they find themselves completely surrounded and low on provisions.  Whittier, very much in the style of Chamberlain at Gettysburgh remains defiant and is able to repel several German assaults over several days.  Despite losing over half his regiment, Whittier survived and later received the Congressional Medal of Honor along with a few of his men for his outstanding bravery.This is a great film and one of the few war films to cover WWI.

This movie is gritty, realistic, and relentless in its depiction of battle.  I was particularly impressed by the realism of the artillery barrages.  People don't just fall over during shelling; bodies are torn to bits.  None of the violence was gratuitous, but sugarcoating war does nobody any good.

But don't let that discourage you from checking it out.  Yes it really should have been filmed in Panavision, but its really good enough to overlook that.OK enough of that, The Lost Battalion is a movie about an American Battalion led by the ol' Silverspoons kid actor Ricky Schroeder.  Yeah OK, he's over 30 now, but you know, its funny to see a successful kid actor these days that hasn't gone off the deep end.In the Lost Battalion Ricky is ordered to take his Battalion of troops, mostly made up of new recruits from New York City and one Texan Lt., through the German lines to take and hold a Mill out in the middle if the Argonne Forest.  The Battalion made it all the way to the Mill due to American ""stubborness"", as described by the German commander, (""They didn't withdraw when they were supposed to"").  The thing is that he was supposed to be flanked by supporting British and French forces as well.  However those attacking forces were forced to hold at their trenches.  Thus this left Shroeder's Battalion out there all alone behind enemy lines.However, this breakthrough created a major thorn in the side of the German forces.  In the meantime the German forces had surrounded Shroeder's Battalion and continued to assault them.  It had driven the German commanders absolutely beserk as they could not beleive the stubborn defense put up by a Battalion that was low on food, ammo and other supplies that it actually helped bring about the end of the War.There are several intense fighting scenes where men are showing their greatest under the worst circumstances.  Think ""Hamburger Hill"" in a WWI theme.  You have a mis-directed artillery barrage, ala the helicopter friendly fire episode in Hamburger Hill.  A flamethrower assualt in the end that winds up disasterous for the Germans.  And several other ""over-the-top"" kind of WWI engagements.  Except all of this is out in the middle of some woods.  This movie also shows off how carrier pigeons were used to transfer messages from the frontlines back to HQ when out of range from telegraph wire.  Too bad they didn't have Nokia phones back then, eh?  (""Can you hear me now?"")But anyway, this movie is watchable again and again.

683687,A1RKCRFPW9LDNS,B00005U8F4,Robert H. Stoner,"[2, 3]","World War I is largely forgotten today, but for absolute carnage in a localized place -- the trenches of the Western Front -- no one has seen the like before or since.  Never have so many lives, so much blood, so much treasure been expended to achieve nothing.  For nearly four years the static lines of combatants moved only yards and those yards were purchased with buckets of blood.This is a very good movie and is not your typical big budget Hollywood epic.  It is a historic documentary-drama made for television's A&E; Network.  It was shot on a very tight budget at the actual location.  Rick Schroder as MAJ Charles Whittlesey, gives one of his finest performances as the battalion commander of the 308th Battalion, 77th Division AEF. The supporting characters of CAPT Holderman [played by Adam James] and CAPT McMurty [played by Phil McKee] are an asset to the film. These three were among the seven men actually awarded the Medal of Honor in this single battle.I was vey impressed by the attenion to small details in this movie.  Unfortunately, the producers were able to locate a full-size replica of the D.H.-4 two-seat observation aircraft of the type flown by the 50th Aero Squadron, AEF.  D.H.-4's from the 50th both located and dropped supplies to the trapped battalion.  Two members of the squadron, Lt. Harold E. Goettler and observer Lt. Erwin R. Bleckley, made the first drop and were shotdown and killed on the second.  Both men received posthumous Medals of Honor.  The aircraft in the film is a 7/8 scale replica of an S.E.-5A fighter and is totally wrong both in size and type.Whether the character of General Alexander, 77th Division commander, is accurate or not is open to question.  As depicted, he certainly does reflect all the bad charracteristics of many World War I commanders; arrogant, disdainful of subbordinates, and detached from the suffering of the combat soldiers.  When the survivors of the battalion finally are rescued, his appearance at the site of the battle seems contrived -- I do not know if this incident is historically accurate.  That he would have actual empathy for his troops seems completely out of character.  That such a haughty individual would be capable of such kindness and consideration is a reach (for me).One of the trivia items concerns the rifles of the Americans.  Contrary to most Hollywood epics, including Gary Cooper's ""Sergeant York"" (1941), the great majority of American troops carried not the M1903 Springfield rifle, but the M1917 ""Enfield"" rifle.  The M1917 was a modified British Pattern 1914 originally designed by Enfield in England. This Mauser-pattern .303 caliber rifle was being produced for the British by American manufacturers Winchester and Remington.  When war clouds were gathering and most thought it a matter of time the United States would be drawn-in, Americans realized that M1903 production at both Springfield Armory (Nassachusetts) and Rock Island Arsenal (Illinois) was totally inadequate to arm what became the American Expeditionary Force (AEF).  Therefore, the Army asked the American commercial producers whether the Pattern 1914 rifle could be redesigned to the American .30-06 Springfield cartridge.  It turned out both Remington and Winchester were thinking along the same lines and the modified rifle was standardized as the Model 1917.  Over 2.5 million M1917 rifles were manufactured by Remington Arms, Eddystone Arsenal (a Remington affiliate), and Winchester Repeating Arms.  In contrast, combined production at both Springfield Armory and Rock Island Arsenal only produced 1.5 million M1903 rifles.  The rifles carried in the movie are, correctly, the Model 1917.Another blooper -- in a scene, a soldier is shown watching for the Germans and is armed with a British No. 4 Mk I rifle that was not in use until World War II.  Someone in the prop department messed-up.  The prop department did get things right showing the American troops armed with both the Colt M1911 .45 pistol and M1917 .45 revolver.  The use of the M1914 Hotchkiss and M1917 Browning machine guns is correct for the period.  The M1915 French Chauchat automatic rifle shown with Private Krotoshinsky is an outstanding piece of accuracy.  Unfortunately for American troops fighting real Germans, the French Chauchat was the WORST machine gun ever forced on the combat infantry soldier by any government.  The gun was so poorly manufactured that it refused to work most of the time.  Unfortunately, the Americans took the horrible French design and made it worse -- we coverted some of these junk machine guns to use the American .30-06 Springfield round that was more powerful than the 8mm French cartridge.  The result was the marginal M1915 in 8mm French was unacceptable and unworkable as the M1918 in U.S. caliber .30.These are minor points and do not detract from the overall quality of this movie.  I give this a 5 star rating.",5,An American View of the War on the Western Front,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,4913,"['World', 'War', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'today', 'absolute', 'carnage',

Based on a true story, this film is one of the most inspiring war films I have ever seen.Major Charles White Whittlesey (played wonderfully by Rick Schroder), was a pacifist who felt obligated to serve his country. Magor Whittlesey led the only unit that made it's objective on October 2, 1918, and that is why they were trapped.  After the battle, Major Whittlesey was awarded the Medal of Honor.  The citation reads as follows: &quot;Although cut off for 5 days from the remainder of his division, Maj. Whittlesey maintained his position, which he had reached under orders received for an advance, and held his command, consisting originally of 46 officers and men of the 308th Infantry and of Company K of the 307th Infantry, together in the face of superior numbers of the enemy during the 5 days. Maj. Whittlesey and his command were thus cut off, and no rations or other supplies reached him, in spite of determined efforts which were made by his division. On the 4th day Maj.

Thompson,"[5, 5]","After watching The Lost Battalion for the third time on the History Channel today, on the 4th of july, I just discovered that this incredible made-for-TV film is available on DVD.  I ordered it and it will take its place on my shelf next to Band of Brothers.This is hands down the best WW1 film ever made.  It has none of the Hollywood triteness or silly conventions that pollute virtually all other Hollywood war movies.  There are very few symphony orchestras on battlefields and there are none in this one.  On real battlefields men rarely scream when they are hit.  They just blow apart, drop, or keep going when they are hit, although they may cry with pain afterward.  Battle orders are not given with some histeric little actor's scream.  They are issued coolly and matter-of-factly, just as they are in real battle.  This film depicts the violence of war as it really is.The action is depicted on the slopes of the Argonne Forest in October.  There are no trenches and very little rain, as winter is just setting in.  The previous reviewers have described well the plot and political implications of the film, so there's not much left to say.I would, however call attention to the few reviewers who have given this film low marks.  One can quickly see that they were rating the idiocy of war, the stupidity of some Headquarters commanders, or some other aspect of war, not the quality of the film.  They are making political statements by rating the film low.  Take that into consideration.  I can think of no faults in this film.  It is perfectly written, perfectly cast, perfectly acted, perfectly filmed, and perfectly edited.  It is a spellbinder from start to finish, and it is true.It is also interesting to note that Major Whittlesey, the actual commanding Officer of the unit depicted, committed suicide three years after the events depicted.  He was obsessed with brooding over the decisions he made that resulted in 300 of the 500 of his men getting killed because he tenatiously followed orders to hold his position.  Three Congressional Medals of Honor were awarded as a result of the action depicted.",5,"THE BEST TWO WAR FILMS EVER MADE,...PERIOD!!",1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,2121,"['watching', 'Lost', 'Battalion', 'third', 'time', 'History', 'Channel', 'today', '4th', 'july', 'just', 'discovered', 'incredible', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'available', 'DVD', 'ordered', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'shelf', 'Band', 'Brothers.This', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'WW1', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'none', 'Hollywood', 'triteness', 'silly', 'conventions', 'pollute', 'virtually', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'war', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'symphony', 'orchestras', 'battlefields', 'are', 'none', 'one', 'real', 'battlefields', 'men', 'rarely', 'scream', 'when', 'are', 'hit', 'just', 'blow', 'apart', 'drop', 'keep', 'going', 'when', 'are', 'hit', 'may', 'cry', 'pain', 'afterward', 'Battle', 'orders', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'histeric', 'little', 'actor', 'scream', 'are', 'issued', 'coolly', 'matter-of-factly', 'just', 'are', 'real', 'battle', 'film', 'violence', 'war', 'really', 'is.The', 'action', 'depicted', 'slopes', 'Argonne', 'Forest', 'October', 'are', 'trenches', 'very', 'little', 'rain', 'winter', 'just', 'setting', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'well', 'plot', 'political', 'implications', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'left', 'say.I', 'would', 'however', 'call', 'attention', 'few', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'low', 'marks', 'One', 'can', 'quickly', 'see', 'were', 'rating', 'idiocy', 'war', 'stupidity', 'Headquarters', 'commanders', 'other', 'aspect', 'war', 'not', 'quality', 'film', 'are', 'making', 'political', 'statements', 'rating', 'film', 'low', 'Take', 'consideration', 'can', 'think', 'faults', 'film', 'perfectly', 'written', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'perfectly', 'filmed', 'perfectly', 'edited', 'spellbinder', 'start', 'finish', 'true.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'note', 'Major', 'Whittlesey', 'actual', 'commanding', 'Officer', 'unit', 'depicted', 'committed', 'suicide', 'three', 'years', 'events', 'depicted', 'was', 'obsessed', 'brooding', 'decisions', 'made', 'resulted', '300', '500', 'men', 'getting', 'killed', 'tenatiously', 'followed', 'orders', 'hold', 'position', 'Three', 'Congressional', 'Medals', 'Honor', 'were', 'awarded', 'result', 'action', 'depicted']",The Lost Battalion

Russell Mulcahy's THE LOST BATTALION is a 2001 A&E; production that tells the based-on-fact story of an American battalion - about 600 men - that became `lost' during an offensive operation in the Meuse-Argonne sector of France in 1918.Rick Schroder plays Maj. Charles Whittlesey, a New York lawyer before the war broke out.  Soft spoken and hidden behind a pair of wire framed glasses Schroder nails the part, conveying the character's strength with whispered stubbornness. By the end of the film, when one of the characters tell the Major his men would follow him anywhere (okay, there's a clich&eacute; or two in this one), we believe him.  With its jittery camera amidst the men and relative absence of establishing shots LOST BATTALION is emotionally gripping, if at times a tad confusing and dizzying.  In any event, the movie successfully renders the muck and grim of trench warfare, and delivers an exciting and grisly view of a war cursed with primitive communications yet possessed of highly developed means of mass slaughter.The dvd also contains a 45-minute History Channel special, `Dear Home: Letters from WWI.'  Employing archive footage, period photographs, voice actors and a great number of letters to and from the soldiers it's a nice, sometimes touching, introduction to US involvement in WWI.

There is not a lot of character development and the story line sticks pretty much to the task at hand. This was much like Blackhawk Down where you are only given enough information to get you into the battle.As far as those critics who blast this movie as hype or over the top American propaganda, think of this. In the actual battle, 5 Medals of Honor were earned. The movie only mentions 3 of them and they were the ground commanders. Two were also awarded posthumously to a pilot and his observer who helped to find the lost battalion in the thick forest. The pilot was shown briefly in the movie but is not later mentioned as a MOH winner. Name another battle where only 700 men fought for 5 days and earned 5 Medals of Honor.

With the fake promise of reinforcements on either side of them, they plunge headfirst deeper into the woods, where they battle to survive in desperate, and brutal battles with the germans.Rick Schroder gives an almost masterpeice of a performance as Major Charles Whittlesey, a man who is a lawyer from New York, who leads his ""city boys"" without food, water, or ammunition. He tries to tell his commanders that he needs reinforcements for his men, but recieves none. Nevertheless he refuses to surrender to the German troops and continues to keep his men linked together.The movie is a great action film, yet it is also a moving film as less than 500 men try to survive an almost impossible task in front of them.The german troops serve as men who want to win, no matter what, they are determined to destroy this small thorn in their side as quickly as possible.The americans are trying to stay alive, using every small trick in the book to try and last another day. Everytime another battle has ended Whittlesey collects the dog tags and binds them together to make one huge pile of tags at the very end of the movie.Warning: This movie contains some graphic violence that isnt for everyone. Nothing as bad as Braveheart, or Passion of the Christ, but there are some scenes that would make people shudder. Like when they get bombed by thier own artillery, one of the worst things that could happen, and when several german attacks leave almost no one alive.But anyways, the rest of the characters are great too, several of the ""city boys"" tend to stick together at the beginning of the movie, but near the end they turn to the boys who grew up around trees in order to live another day. Several of Whittlesey's officers are great too, they provide strong supporting characters.This is a great movie, and the surprising thing is it is a tv movie!

Misled by his commanding general's insistence that the Americans and French troops are still supporting his flank, a young Jewish lawyer out of New York, and now a Major in the U.S. Army, stubbornly tells his men not to give ground and must hold at all costs against the German infantry that launch desperate assaults against his line of men that continue to fight without food, water, or much medical aid. His battalion is made up of veteran officers and Polish, Jews, and Italians out of New York that amaze the Germans with their continuous resistance. Sadly, barely 175 men remain of his battalion when they are finally relieved, and the Major hears his general after his arrival as he inquires, ""Where's the rest of your battalion?"" while looking around at the stunned, dirty, and battered survivors in the shrunken perimeter.We must not forget these men for what they had accomplished barely a hundred years ago, even after the recent passing of the last WWI doughboy. And let's not forget that after the Major and two of his captains won the Medal of Honor, the Major went on to being promoted to lieutenant-colonel, but soon became broke and depressed after the war ended. Unable to deal with the horrors that nearly destroyed his men in his memories, he committed suicide by jumping overboard off a ship in 1921, but the fates of what happened to his survivors have been forgotten.

As in many other accounts of war, both in actual events as well as in fiction, bonds are formed between men whose lives so clearly depend on one another.The battle scenes were certainly exciting.  Most of the fighting seemed plausible.  I would have liked, however, to have heard a little discussion between the Major and his men on how to neutralize the Storm Troops armed with flamethrowers.  Would somebody actually try to tackle and knife a German with flamethrower instead of shooting him--or were they really so low on ammunition at that point?As for the scenes in which the high-ranking German officers back at headquarters professed such a high degree of admiration for these Americans--they seemed too unlikely to take seriously.",4,Compelling account of soldierly comraderie and the fog of battle,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,916,"['dramatization', 'American', 'battalion', 'German', 'lines', 'World', 'War', 'presents', 'grueling', 'account', 'soldiers', 'who', 'have', 'fight', 'lives', 'many', 'other', 'accounts', 'war', 'actual', 'events', 'as', 'well', 'fiction', 'bonds', 'are', 'formed', 'men', 'lives', 'so', 'clearly', 'depend', 'one', 'another.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'certainly', 'exciting', 'Most', 'fighting', 'seemed', 'plausible', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'however', 'have', 'heard', 'little', 'discussion', 'Major', 'men', 'how', 'neutralize', 'Storm', 'Troops', 'armed', 'flamethrowers', 'Would', 'somebody', 'actually', 'try', 'tackle', 'knife', 'German', 'flamethrower', 'instead', 'shooting', 'were', 'really', 'so', 'low', 'ammunition', 'point', 'scenes', 'high-ranking', 'German', 'officers', 'back', 'headquarters', 'professed', 'high', 'degree', 'admiration', 'Americans', 'seemed', 'too', 'unlikely', 'take', 'seriously']",The Lost Battalion

Rick Schroder and the cast do an excellent job in demonstrating the hardships, horror, and cost of what the actual soldiers endured during their ordeal in the Argonne Woods. While a few may criticize its overall production value, I personally found it to be convincing enough.
