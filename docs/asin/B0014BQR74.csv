This documentary has profound depth-  on the surface the film appears to be about cooking but the koan of the film is without a definite answer. One can find oneself exploring awareness, stillness, meditation, ritual and even cooking. Roshi Ed Brown encourages us to explore food as a metaphor.

In Japan's Soto Zen tradition, cooking is more than just feeding the monks.  It's about close attention to detail.  It's about respect for the produce of the Earth.  In the process, its as much about preparing yourself as it is a meal.13th century Japanese Zen masterDogenelevated the position of cook within his monasteries to near the importance of the abbot.  He saw in the handling and preparation of food a means for cooks to practice mindfulness, and through careful attention to detail maintain the health and morale of the monastic community.  He wrote a treatise on the subject,Instructions to the Tenzo, that is still studied in Soto Zen monasteries.  In fact you'll see in the film some of the cooks at Tassajara studying this very text.These days Edward Espe Brown leads cooking, health and meditation seminars in the US and Europe, at which much of the footage for this film was shot.  Director Dorrie doesn't shy from showing us more than the wise, Zen-master side of her subject, including segments in which Brown loses his temper with his students, as well as with a plastic wrapper and a bottler stopper.  As he remarks to a class at the beginning of the film, he may have been practicing Zen for 40 years, but he's still a human being subject to nervousness and anxiety at the beginning of each new retreat.  He notes as well that he still makes mistakes, that mistakes are part of the process of cooking, as they are with life.  Perfection, he adds, is to be found in the effort.While not a kinesthetic subject, Dorrie does a good job of keeping the viewer's attention by mixing up shots and breaking the film up into thematic units.  Except for a small diversion on the homeless and a woman who survives by living off supermarket discards, Dorrie remains tightly focused.  The understated jazz soundtrack is perfect accompaniment to themes of spontaneity and authenticity.You won't come away from this film with a handful of new recipes, but you might have a new respect for cooking and the practice of mindfulness.#",5,Getting it right:  perfection in intention,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,2607,"['delightful', 'insightful', 'film', 'German', 'director', 'Doris', 'Dorrie', 'Enlightenment', 'Guaranteed', 'tradition', 'great', 'Buddhist', 'teachings', 'marvel', 'life', 'always', 'been', 'right', 'nose', 'right', 'fingertips', 'right', 'waiting', 'really', 'see', 'really', 'feel', 'really', 'smell', 'taste', 'it.Ostensibly', 'profile', 'American', 'Soto', 'Zen', 'priestEdward', 'Espe', 'Brown', '30', 'years', 'head', 'cook', 'California', 'Tassajara', 'Zen', 'Center', 'film', 'end', 'more', 'how', 'relate', 'food', 'ultimately', 'how', 'relate', 'life', 'Japan', 'Soto', 'Zen', 'tradition', 'cooking', 'more', 'just', 'feeding', 'monks', 'close', 'attention', 'detail', 'respect', 'produce', 'Earth', 'process', 'much', 'preparing', 'meal.13th', 'century', 'Japanese', 'Zen', 'masterDogenelevated', 'position', 'cook', 'monasteries', 'importance', 'abbot', 'saw', 'handling', 'preparation', 'food', 'means', 'cooks', 'practice', 'mindfulness', 'careful', 'attention', 'detail', 'maintain', 'health', 'morale', 'monastic', 'community', 'wrote', 'treatise', 'subject', 'Instructions', 'Tenzo', 'still', 'studied', 'Soto', 'Zen', 'monasteries', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'see', 'film', 'cooks', 'Tassajara', 'studying', 'very', 'text.These', 'days', 'Edward', 'Espe', 'Brown', 'cooking', 'health', 'meditation', 'seminars', 'US', 'Europe', 'much', 'footage', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Director', 'Dorrie', ""n't"", 'shy', 'showing', 'more', 'wise', 'Zen-master', 'side', 'subject', 'including', 'segments', 'Brown', 'temper', 'students', 'as', 'well', 'plastic', 'wrapper', 'bottler', 'stopper', 'remarks', 'class', 'beginning', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'Zen', '40', 'years', 'still', 'human', 'being', 'subject', 'nervousness', 'anxiety', 'beginning', 'new', 'retreat', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'mistakes', 'mistakes', 'are', 'part', 'process', 'cooking', 'are', 'life', 'Perfection', 'be', 'found', 'effort.While', 'not', 'kinesthetic', 'subject', 'Dorrie', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'attention', 'mixing', 'up', 'shots', 'breaking', 'film', 'up', 'thematic', 'units', 'small', 'diversion', 'homeless', 'woman', 'who', 'living', 'off', 'supermarket', 'discards', 'Dorrie', 'tightly', 'focused', 'understated', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'themes', 'spontaneity', 'authenticity.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'film', 'handful', 'new', 'recipes', 'might', 'have', 'new', 'respect', 'cooking', 'practice', 'mindfulness.']",How To Cook Your Life

Actually it never shows how to prepare a single dish from the begining to the end, but how to work with our own minds.Zen teachings and commentaries are given by Edward Espe Brown (the priest), but also we have archival footage of the teachings of the Zen Master Suzuki,and also the interviews with the members of the Buddhist community.Zen is a practice of mindfulness, and of course, there is a lot of it in this movie. But also are other aspects which are so very Zen: honesty, humor, poetry, humanity, compassion toward humans and animals, and the attitude toward the problems in our lives. Brown is a priest and a teacher, but he is has not a stature of a Zen master, yet anyone can see how much it can be learned from a practitioner who spend fourty years practicing Zen. And for those of you who like Dalai Lama and his sense of humor,there is also something charming about the brand of humor represented by Brown, and his master teacher, Suzuki.Cooking was very important practice in Zen monasteries, but also any work done, and this movies shows how much meaning any work can have. Any work which serves the others can be elevated to a meaningful activity, and yes, be holly to some extend, if done with the right spirit.And I just want to add a comment fro those who are not familiar with Mahayana Buddhism (to which Zen belongs). You can see Brown talking about old water kettles, and there is a lot of down to Earth poetry in it.But he also sheds a tear, so, why is he so emotional, someone may ask. As a long time practitioner, Ed Brown must have to take Boddhistava vows, which means such a practitioner has the attitude the others first. The vows are that the practitioner will by his/her own will be reincarnated again and again in order to help others, postponing his/her own ultimate state of Nirvana.This is very courageous and compassionate decision, based on deep love to others.And of course, the meaning of service to others is very much extended, and felt very deeply.So, it is not a self pity, but an overwhelming emotion which came upon him.We could have a priviledge to witness this moment.I recommend this movie not only to Zen practitioners, or people wanting to have more insight about combining cooking and spirituality, but also anyone who is interested in comparative religion, or spiritual traditions of the  world.",5,Zen of Cooking and Cooking with Zen,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,2453,"['movie', 'featuring', 'Zen', 'priest', 'who', 'also', 'master', 'cook', 'not', 'how', 'cook', 'dish', 'type', 'movie', 'Actually', 'never', 'how', 'prepare', 'single', 'dish', 'begining', 'end', 'how', 'work', 'own', 'minds.Zen', 'teachings', 'commentaries', 'are', 'given', 'Edward', 'Espe', 'Brown', 'priest', 'also', 'have', 'archival', 'footage', 'teachings', 'Zen', 'Master', 'Suzuki', 'also', 'interviews', 'members', 'Buddhist', 'community.Zen', 'practice', 'mindfulness', 'course', 'lot', 'movie', 'also', 'are', 'other', 'aspects', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'Zen', 'honesty', 'humor', 'poetry', 'humanity', 'compassion', 'humans', 'animals', 'attitude', 'problems', 'lives', 'Brown', 'priest', 'teacher', 'not', 'stature', 'Zen', 'master', 'yet', 'anyone', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'practitioner', 'who', 'spend', 'fourty', 'years', 'practicing', 'Zen', 'who', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'sense', 'humor', 'also', 'something', 'charming', 'brand', 'humor', 'represented', 'Brown', 'master', 'teacher', 'Suzuki.Cooking', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'practice', 'Zen', 'monasteries', 'also', 'work', 'done', 'movies', 'how', 'much', 'meaning', 'work', 'can', 'have', 'Any', 'work', 'others', 'can', 'be', 'elevated', 'meaningful', 'activity', 'yes', 'be', 'holly', 'extend', 'done', 'right', 'spirit.And', 'just', 'want', 'add', 'comment', 'fro', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Mahayana', 'Buddhism', 'Zen', 'belongs', 'can', 'see', 'Brown', 'talking', 'old', 'water', 'kettles', 'lot', 'down', 'Earth', 'poetry', 'it.But', 'also', 'tear', 'so', 'why', 'so', 'emotional', 'someone', 'may', 'ask', 'long', 'time', 'practitioner', 'Ed', 'Brown', 'must', 'have', 'take', 'Boddhistava', 'vows', 'practitioner', 'attitude', 'others', 'first', 'vows', 'are', 'practitioner', 'will', 'own', 'will', 'be', 'reincarnated', 'again', 'again', 'order', 'help', 'others', 'postponing', 'own', 'ultimate', 'state', 'Nirvana.This', 'very', 'courageous', 'compassionate', 'decision', 'based', 'deep', 'love', 'others.And', 'course', 'meaning', 'service', 'others', 'very', 'much', 'extended', 'felt', 'very', 'deeply.So', 'not', 'self', 'pity', 'overwhelming', 'emotion', 'came', 'him.We', 'could', 'have', 'priviledge', 'witness', 'moment.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'Zen', 'practitioners', 'people', 'wanting', 'have', 'more', 'insight', 'combining', 'cooking', 'spirituality', 'also', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'comparative', 'religion', 'spiritual', 'traditions', 'world']",How To Cook Your Life

Once again, I was instead handed evidence that there is, in fact, no such thing as a decent cooking documentary. While this isn't as outright awful as I Like Killing Flies, it's definitely a case of ""religion screws up something that might have otherwise been interesting"". Which is actually worse in some ways.How to Cook Your Life is a glimpse into the world of Edward Espe Brown, author of The Tassajara Bread Book and The Tassajara Recipe Book. I've had both on my list of stuff to read for years, so when I saw a documentary of the author pop up, it immediately went onto the list. I got round to watching it last night, and of the documentary's ninety-four minutes, roughly six were devoted to cooking. Dorrie (Ich und Er) is far more interested in exploring Brown's religious, political, and social values, none of which have a bloody thing to do with cooking, and none of which are in any way interesting. There are a few digressions into the religious/social/political beliefs of close friends and attendees of Brown's cooking classes which are marginally more interesting. But not much.What saves this from the same zero-star fate to which I Like Killing Flies was destined is that Brown himself seems like an affable sort. He means well, at least, even if (assuming Dorrie's account is in any way accurate) he seems singularly ineffective at getting anything across about the actual art of cooking, heading often into digressions about religion/politics/etc. etc. ad nauseam.

1145932,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0014BQR74,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 8]","**1/2Famed cookbook author Edward Espe Brown takes the old adage ""You are what you eat"" to a whole new level.  For this master chef/Zen priest believes you must actually become ""one"" with your food (and, as it turns out, with your utensils as well) if you are to ever attain true wholeness of body and spirit in this life.  Brown has been conducting courses on how to combine the art of meditation with the art of cooking for decades now, and the documentary ""How to Cook Your Life"" by German filmmaker Doris Dorrie (who went on to make the superb Zen-flavored drama ""Cherry Blossoms"" a year later) enrolls us in one of those courses - though we don`t get any actual credit for the class and, what's worse, we don`t get to sample any of the food.Food for Brown has become a way of life - a spiritual and religious experience, as it were, a means of nurturing the soul as well as the body, of becoming one with nature.  And the more organic and less processed that food is the better.Brown spends much of the time in the course dispensing words of wisdom on how to live life in greater harmony with the world around us, with food and cooking as the primary means of achieving that goal (let it be noted that the seminar takes place in a beautiful bucolic center in rural California).  And if the philosophizing gets to be a bit too much for you after awhile - as it did for me - and Brown seems more like a self-aggrandizing drama queen than an enlightened master at times (the crying over a teapot - and not even a broken one at that - is a bit much), you can at least savor all the tasty morsels that have been lovingly arrayed for our delectation.Though, come to think of it, with his endless chatter and ceaseless pontificating, Brown puts us in mind of yet another popular expression:  ""How about a little less gab and a little more grub?""",2,A little less gab and a little more grub,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,1843,"['**1/2Famed', 'cookbook', 'author', 'Edward', 'Espe', 'Brown', 'old', 'adage', 'are', 'what', 'eat', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'master', 'chef/Zen', 'priest', 'must', 'actually', 'become', 'one', 'food', 'out', 'utensils', 'well', 'are', 'ever', 'attain', 'true', 'wholeness', 'body', 'spirit', 'life', 'Brown', 'been', 'conducting', 'courses', 'how', 'combine', 'art', 'meditation', 'art', 'cooking', 'decades', 'now', 'documentary', 'How', 'Cook', 'Life', 'German', 'filmmaker', 'Doris', 'Dorrie', 'who', 'went', 'make', 'superb', 'Zen-flavored', 'drama', 'Cherry', 'Blossoms', 'year', 'later', 'one', 'courses', 'don', 't', 'get', 'actual', 'credit', 'class', 'what', 'worse', 'don', 't', 'get', 'sample', 'food.Food', 'Brown', 'become', 'way', 'life', 'spiritual', 'religious', 'experience', 'were', 'means', 'nurturing', 'soul', 'as', 'well', 'body', 'becoming', 'one', 'nature', 'more', 'organic', 'less', 'processed', 'food', 'better.Brown', 'spends', 'much', 'time', 'course', 'dispensing', 'words', 'wisdom', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'greater', 'harmony', 'world', 'food', 'cooking', 'primary', 'means', 'achieving', 'goal', 'let', 'be', 'noted', 'seminar', 'place', 'beautiful', 'bucolic', 'center', 'rural', 'California', 'philosophizing', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'awhile', 'did', 'Brown', 'more', 'self-aggrandizing', 'drama', 'queen', 'enlightened', 'master', 'times', 'crying', 'teapot', 'not', 'even', 'broken', 'one', 'bit', 'much', 'can', 'least', 'savor', 'tasty', 'morsels', 'have', 'been', 'lovingly', 'arrayed', 'delectation.Though', 'come', 'think', 'endless', 'chatter', 'ceaseless', 'pontificating', 'Brown', 'mind', 'yet', 'popular', 'expression', 'How', 'little', 'less', 'gab', 'little', 'more', 'grub']",How To Cook Your Life
