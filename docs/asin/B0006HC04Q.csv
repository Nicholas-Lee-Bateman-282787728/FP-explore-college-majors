868242,ABARNA66MT43U,B0006HC04Q,Bonemonkey,"[0, 0]","Killer Flood must have looked quite promising on paper. The storyline is nice & neat and (best of all) only requires a cast of five people, plus a handful of extras to run up & down the street from time to time. Sadly the end result is a bit of a disaster. Not quite the worst film I've ever seen (see &#34;EarthStorm&#34;) but definitely right up there. The time they spent trying to build up tension was fairly pointless as all it leads up to is a woman hiding in a skip with a dog (the dog was by far the best actor in the whole film). The flood water moves at various speeds depending on whether the cast are running away or driving at 70mph - it will always be just meters behind them. Lots of the film centers around the supposedly impossible task of evacuating the town, which turned out to be quite easy in the end - ten people had to walk up a hill, then cheer as they look down on their submerged homes. Most of the budget went on a certain flood effect. Basically how it works is someone tips over a bucket of water and films it, then they slow down the footage and super-impose it on some footage of the town (not quite &#34;The Day After Tomorrow&#34;). There are a couple of un-intentional funny moments and plenty of disasters in the acting department. All in all Killer Flood is harmless fun, but as far as water-based disaster movies go this may well be the worst one.

One might be impelled to ask whether the effects or the talent had the lowest budget, but given that the film is pretty good.The movie IS satisfying. It procedes from beginning to end with a rather classic inevitability. Unlike so many films in its genre, the heroes do NOT forsake their responsible positions of authority in order to perform personal quests (for examples of this, see ""The Big One,"" ""Aftershock,"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow""--in all of these, the leading characters stop their formal functions midway in order to rescue family members).One might question the actions of some characters (hide in a dumpster when about to be engulfed by a kazillion tons of water?), but there is a continuity of tragic inevitability throughout the proceedings. Also, the ""good guys"" are pretty likable. That certainly helps in the enjoyment of the movie.For folks ""into"" disaster films, will say this is a must-see.",3,Pretty good disaster flick; better than many...,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,1041,"['very', 'far', 'worst', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'coherent', 'plot', 'nasty', 'villain', 'flawed', 'heroes', 'One', 'might', 'be', 'impelled', 'ask', 'effects', 'talent', 'had', 'lowest', 'budget', 'given', 'film', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'movie', 'IS', 'satisfying', 'beginning', 'end', 'rather', 'classic', 'inevitability', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'genre', 'heroes', 'do', 'NOT', 'forsake', 'responsible', 'positions', 'authority', 'order', 'perform', 'personal', 'quests', 'examples', 'see', 'Big', 'One', 'Aftershock', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'leading', 'characters', 'stop', 'formal', 'functions', 'midway', 'order', 'rescue', 'family', 'members', '.One', 'might', 'question', 'actions', 'characters', 'hide', 'dumpster', 'when', 'be', 'engulfed', 'kazillion', 'tons', 'water', 'continuity', 'tragic', 'inevitability', 'proceedings', 'Also', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'pretty', 'likable', 'certainly', 'enjoyment', 'movie.For', 'disaster', 'films', 'will', 'say', 'must-see']",N/A
868244,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B0006HC04Q,Julian Kennedy,"[0, 0]","Killer Flood: The Day the Dam Broke: 1 out of 10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even by the low standards of disaster movies, excuse me for a moment allow me to correct myself, even by the low standards of made for TV disaster movies this is truly awful. Where do I begin?The dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but I somewhat doubt it. Most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity, have... oh I don't know, a power plant nearby, maybe some sluice gates for water to run through, heck even a high tension electrical wire or two. This Dam would embarress a Lego knockoff toy company.This disaster prone dam is also somewhat understaffed. Two, count them, two employees staff the entire dam. And the employees are apparently imported from a clich&eacute;d ridden World War Two film, as they heroically and rather needlessly have long eulogized death scenes complete with photos of grandchildren floating by. Heck one of them manages to get shot by the dam itself in a way that defies description.The special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photo's of the town in a method that makes a sixties Godzilla film look like the Matrix. A three-year-old drawing with a blue crayon on the film stock would have yielded better results. Since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film?Needless to say the script and acting follow the special effects lead. This is no diamond in the rough. This is the rough. So is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is awful enough to generate some laughs and the film itself has that earnest incompetence that makes a good cult classic, but bad disaster films need to age like a fine wine. (Avalanche, The Swarm, An Inconvenient Truth )It is also doubtful that Michelle Green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever will ever match the great Henry Fonda being pelted by raisins that are supposed to be killer bees.

The plot stayed on course from beginning to end in that the dam is about to burst and a good guy is trying to warn and save the town, and a bad guy is being greedy for himself and not caring what happens to the people in his home town. I thought the acting was done well by all. I was not disappointed. I am pleased to see David Powell (Joe) is the hero. I am most pleased that in this movie the hero isn't portrayed as a egomaniac that no one listens too (like in many of these type of disaster movies), but instead is treated as an intelligent person.
