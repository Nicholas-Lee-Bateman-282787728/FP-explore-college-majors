In the film, various legal experts weigh in and their incredulity that this happened is more shocking than the event itself.I know Patricia Douglas wanted her story told, but I came away thinking it was a disservice to her to make this tragic event and what little happened afterward into a full length movie, since there just isn't that much to say.

1232684,A19552QR80XTOX,B001R23G7E,Jungle Red,"[3, 4]","I watched Girl 27 on the recommendation of someone who posted about it in a forum I frequent. I love old Hollywood and I love a good scandal so I watched this on Netflix straight away. I liked it so much that I bought it. First, this isn't a glamorous old Hollywood story by a long shot. Like a lot of people, I had no idea who Patricia Douglas was. She was never a star - just a young girl living in LA who appeared as a dancing extra in a film or two. Unless you were alive and living in Los Angeles in 1937, you likely wouldn't know her either.At 17, Douglas was hired by MGM under the guise of appearing in a film. Douglas and a slew of other young girls were actually hired as ""entertainment"" for a group of salesmen MGM trucked out to the Hal Roach ranch for a sales convention. As you'll learn from the documentary, ""sales convention"" is a euphemism for free-for-all drunken orgy. Douglas was raped at the sales convention by a Chicago salesman, David Ross. She was found by a parking attendant, examined by an inept doctor and pressed charges against Ross. The media had a field day with the story, but only at the expense of Patricia. MGM made the whole matter go away by throwing money at everyone involved (including Douglas' own mother) and Ross was never brought up on any charges. He slunk back to Chicago to live the rest of his life. Douglas didn't get a dime from MGM and basically faded away.Author David Stenn, the director of this documentary, stumbled upon this story when he was researching his biography about Jean Harlow. Harlow died around the time this story was making headlines which is how he became familiar with it. He eventually found Douglas and set about telling her story. Understandably, she wasn't eager to rehash the past but I think part of her wanted to talk to someone about it.I found the documentary to be well made. Even if you're not familiar with old Hollywood or the studio system, this gives you enough background information to bring you up to speed. The facts of the case are also laid out very well. Unless you're incredibly optimistic or live with blinders on, it's easy to see that MGM took great pains to bury this story. Stenn did a great job of finding nearly everyone involved in the story. Some of the participants have since died (like Ross who died of rectal cancer in 1961) but some of the participants' families were interviewed and acknowledged the pay offs. In one instance, the daughters of the parking attendant who found Patricia after she was raped were interviewed. They admitted their father changed his testimony in exchange for a ""job for life"" from MGM. It's easy to be outraged at an action like that but I can't imagine the man had too many choices. Would his account have changed things? As the documentary shows, MGM ran Los Angeles at the time so it's difficult to say. Another story that is similar to Douglas' is also briefly looked at. Eloise Spann, who was a singer and appeared in a few films, was also allegedly raped by a man who worked at MGM. Spann died some time ago, but Stenn found her son who tells her story. While Spann's story is strikingly similar to Patricia's, her fate was a bit darker to say the very least.What I also enjoyed about the documentary were the interviews. Stenn didn't just interview the subject, he also interviewed people who were working in Hollywood during that era to establish what it was like for young women who were trying to break into show business. Actress Diana Serra Cary (who was a huge star in the silent era as Baby Peggy) recalled her time at MGM as a young woman. Sexual harassment was pretty much the order of the day back then. If you wanted a job or didn't want to be completely ostracized, you didn't complain about being groped. Stenn also looks at the hypocrisy of Hollywood. Someone like Douglas, who was not protected by a studio, was publicly derided for being a tramp for getting herself raped. Stars who found themselves in similar sticky situations were protected. This isn't earth shattering news, but it is still interesting to learn just how far people will go to keep up appearances for the sake of fame, money and phony morality.While the Hollywood aspect of this film was interesting, the real life facts behind Douglas are also compelling. Her rape and the ensuing public spectacle did change her life. Douglas married three times but didn't find happiness (two of her husbands were bigamists). In between her marriages, she continued to live with her mother with whom she already had a difficult relationship. This wasn't helped by the fact that Mom sold her daughter out when MGM offered her some cash to make the rape case go away. Douglas' rocky relationship with her own daughter is also examined. I've read a few reviews where people are appalled by her daughter's behavior. I don't know if I'd agree considering their relationship. I found her complaints about paying $25 for a box to hold her mother's cremains a bit petty but as someone who has a difficult (ie non-existent) relationship with a parent, I might very well feel the same.Also included on the DVD is commentary by the director/writer, David Stenn, and a short film called ""Hollywood Extra Girl"", released in 1935. I have yet to listen to the commentary for the reasons listed below. I have watched the short many times because it is thoroughly entertaining. ""Hollywood Extra Girl"" is one of those shorts studios made to promote, well, nothing. They're mostly propaganda-ish now and border on absurd. This particular short follows an ""extra girl"" named Suzanne Emery who is appearing in The Crusades (as an extra girl, natch) directed by Cecil B. DeMille. Come to think of it, I think this short was made just to showcase DeMille acting like a tyrant, er, genius, while giving unconvincing fatherly advice to a young hopeful. By the way, the ""star"" of this short went on to do nothing. She appeared in The Crusades as an unbilled extra, did this short and then dropped off the face of the Earth. I guess DeMille was right when he said the odds of her making it were slim to none.As well made as I found this documentary, there was one point that could have been changed. David Stenn is a pretty good author and filmmaker, but he interjects himself into the documentary a wee bit too much. I don't know if we had to see his thoughts about everything all the time. Yeah, it's awesome that his editor (who was Jackie O by the way...in case you missed that. You might miss that) ordered him to do this story because no one else could, but I think most of us are aware that the person who makes a documentary is typically interested in the subject. It was touching that he did establish a relationship with Patricia because she was obviously in need of some friends, but his presence was overwhelming at times and unneeded for the most part. I wouldn't say he exploited Douglas, but it seems like he was going above and beyond to showcase that he cared for her. It was distracting the first few times I watched it but I have since tuned his parts out. For me, it was a minor point and not enough to overshadow the overall story and research that went into this.There are obviously folks out there who find this kind of story ""boring"" because sex crimes, injustice and cover-ups have been around since the dawn of time and one more story about it won't solve anything. I don't subscribe to that line of thinking and frankly don't understand it, but I get that this story isn't for everyone. If you're one of those people, skip it. If you'd rather see old Hollywood as a perfect, glamorous place where bad things didn't happen, again, skip it. This documentary won't totally ruin your view on that lovely era, but it will darken it a bit. If you're interested in that era in general or in the legal system and how very corrupt it can be, this documentary may be for you.",5,Sad But Compelling,1356739200,"12 29,

What? You never heard of Patricia Douglas or the case? Neither have most folks. But when journalist David Stenn was researching his bio of Jean Harlow the case popped up. He dug further and reported his findings in a long article in Vanity Fair magazine in 2003. Then he went further and edited his interview footage - of the reclusive Douglas, who he found still living at age 85, and legal experts - with some feature film clips into this compelling 80-minute film.There was a whole file on the case in the USC Film Archives that hadn't been touched since the 1930s and provided lots of info for Stenn.  The filmmaker narrates the film - and even interviews himself! - in a pleasant voice but the voice you won't forget is that of Douglas. It's gruff and worn and angry. After 65 years, she is seeing her story come to light. Sure, the studio (MGM) is now a different corporate entity, having been swallowed up by Ted Turner, but there probably is still a ""casting couch"" out there.The impeccably researched and creatively edited film is a must for anyone interested in the Hollywood films of the 1930s or 40s. The bonus features include the 10-minute Paramount short ""Hollywood Extra Girl"", which is - sadly - cropped too close so that the top and bottom of picture are cut off as well as a Director's Commentary by Stenn. The commentary really adds to the understanding of the case and Stenn's voice is engaging, making it almost essential to listen to.I dove into this DVD with no prior knowledge of it's subject, except for the blurb on the DVD case.

Patricia Douglas was a dancer at MGM in the 30's. She was raped at a party for MGM salesmen. When Patricia tried to fight what had happened to her the press and MGM just went after her. MGM bought off her lawyer, the DA, her mother, and the main eyewitness. Definitley the seedy underside of Hollywood. This is also the story of the hard work and dedication of David Stenn who uncovered Patricia's story while researching for his book about Jean Harlow. Stenn finds Patricia 85 years old, living in Vegas and basically a recluse, depressed, and bitter. He wins her trust and she tells her story to him. The clips of the MGM dancers and of films at that time show how women basically had no rights and men could do whatever they wanted. It was interesting hearing from Patricia's daughter and seeing how that one event impacted her whole family through the generations and emotionally isolated her from her family. It was so sad to watch how this ruined Patricia's life and impacted her marriages, family, and how she lived her life. But at the same time so amazing in the courage it took to tell her story 65 years later and back then to try to get justice for herself. She is unforgettable. It was very poignant when David Stenn talked about how when he first met Patricia he gave her a hug and at first she didn't hug back but then she opened up to him and through Stenn Patricia got to experience that love and trust from another person before she died. The most gripping parts of the documentary are hearing Patricia's voice and seeing her on camera talking about her experiences. That is the best part and what makes this so engrossing and unforgettable.",4,"Girl 27, an unforgettable documentary",1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,1752,"['watched', 'Girl', '27', 'Netflix', 'yesterday', 'still', 'hear', 'Patricia', 'Douglas', 'voice', 'mind', 'Patricia', 'Douglas', 'was', 'dancer', 'MGM', '30', 'was', 'raped', 'party', 'MGM', 'salesmen', 'When', 'Patricia', 'tried', 'fight', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'press', 'MGM', 'just', 'went', 'MGM', 'bought', 'off', 'lawyer', 'DA', 'mother', 'main', 'eyewitness', 'Definitley', 'seedy', 'underside', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'story', 'hard', 'work', 'dedication', 'David', 'Stenn', 'who', 'uncovered', 'Patricia', 'story', 'researching', 'book', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'Stenn', 'Patricia', '85', 'years', 'old', 'living', 'Vegas', 'basically', 'recluse', 'depressed', 'bitter', 'trust', 'story', 'clips', 'MGM', 'dancers', 'films', 'time', 'show', 'how', 'women', 'basically', 'had', 'rights', 'men', 'could', 'do', 'wanted', 'was', 'interesting', 'hearing', 'Patricia', 'daughter', 'seeing', 'how', 'one', 'event', 'impacted', 'whole', 'family', 'generations', 'emotionally', 'isolated', 'family', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'watch', 'how', 'ruined', 'Patricia', 'life', 'impacted', 'marriages', 'family', 'how', 'lived', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'amazing', 'courage', 'took', 'tell', 'story', '65', 'years', 'later', 'back', 'then', 'try', 'get', 'justice', 'herself', 'unforgettable', 'was', 'very', 'poignant', 'when', 'David', 'Stenn', 'talked', 'how', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'Patricia', 'gave', 'hug', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'hug', 'back', 'then', 'opened', 'up', 'Stenn', 'Patricia', 'got', 'experience', 'love', 'trust', 'person', 'died', 'most', 'gripping', 'parts', 'documentary', 'are', 'hearing', 'Patricia', 'voice', 'seeing', 'camera', 'talking', 'experiences', 'best', 'part', 'what', 'so', 'engrossing', 'unforgettable']",Girl 27

The extent of effort in Hollywood, beginning with MGM Studios, to create this cover-up is... unfortunately, sadly, not surprising. Our world has changed little, and rape today is hushed up as much as it was in 1937 (note the stories of women raped in the military, or the numbers of women being raped at the very moment of this writing - 200,000 reported cases in just the past 8 months in the Congo), if not indeed become a sport, a form of entertainment, an industry. It is alarming to see how the desensitization process was begun already in 1937, from common themes in Betty Boop cartoons, the scantily clad female constantly being chased by lecherous men who carry her away screaming to do... what? Or movies such as ""The Quiet Man,"" starring American legend John Wayne, with a scene in which he pulls the female lead (with whom he is supposedly in love!) by her hair, screaming and struggling across a field. Entertainment? It is not. Not when in such manner Hollywood has played a great part in making violence against women ever more acceptable.Patricia Douglas was an underage dancer, a girl with stars in her eyes, innocent in body and mind, with no understanding of the way the minds of some men work. Attending a Hollywood party where her boss promised her ""a good time,"" she was held down, scotch forced down her throat until she vomited, then violently raped and beaten. The rapist, Ross, was never prosecuted. Anyone who tried to bring the case to court was mysteriously hushed up... or given a glam job in MGM to keep silent. Douglas was systematically smeared in the media, made into a ""tart,"" a woman who ""brought it on herself."" Her life and reputation were destroyed.Sixty-five years later, author-screenwriter David Stenn unearths this little known story and pursues it. To his shock, he finds Pat Douglas, now an elderly woman, still alive. It is painful to see, how all these many years later, this woman's life is still daily affected by what happened to her as a young girl. She is a recluse who, in her own words, has been frigid all her life. She has never loved anyone, she says, because she will never be able to trust any man. She fought against the wish to commit suicide. She pushed away anyone who ever tried to get close to her. She has not even been able to have close friendships. She has never danced again. She sits alone in her house, a broken woman, and only with Stenn's unrelenting and respectful persistence, does she finally agree to speak to him and tell her story. She does so in prolonged bits and pieces, often simply stopping to say, ""I can't talk about this. I can't.""Patricia Douglas's rapist by now is dead. Justice will never be done. But this DVD now exists, the story is public for anyone who cares to hear it. One woman has spoken up, even if it took 65 years and a ruined life to do it. Truth, she says, even if it takes this many years, will always come out. All lies, she says, eventually surface. This kind of violence devastates completely; one man's momentary violence can ruin another life forever. Is Hollywood listening? Is the world ready to see women as human beings? Flip through the movies on your cable tonight before you answer that...Soon after telling her story, Patricia Douglas died in 2003.",5,An Absence of Progress,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,3348,"['so', 'many', 'had', 'knowledge', 'story', 'heard', 'Patricia', 'Douglas', 'extent', 'effort', 'Hollywood', 'beginning', 'MGM', 'Studios', 'create', 'cover-up', 'unfortunately', 'sadly', 'not', 'surprising', 'world', 'changed', 'little', 'rape', 'today', 'hushed', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'was', '1937', 'note', 'stories', 'women', 'raped', 'military', 'numbers', 'women', 'being', 'raped', 'very', 'moment', 'writing', '200,000', 'reported', 'cases', 'just', 'past', '8', 'months', 'Congo', 'not', 'indeed', 'become', 'sport', 'form', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'alarming', 'see', 'how', 'desensitization', 'process', 'was', 'begun', 'already', '1937', 'common', 'themes', 'Betty', 'Boop', 'cartoons', 'scantily', 'clad', 'female', 'constantly', 'being', 'chased', 'lecherous', 'men', 'who', 'carry', 'away', 'screaming', 'do', 'what', 'movies', 'such', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'starring', 'American', 'legend', 'John', 'Wayne', 'scene', 'female', 'lead', 'whom', 'supposedly', 'love', 'hair', 'screaming', 'struggling', 'field', 'Entertainment', 'not', 'Not', 'when', 'such', 'manner', 'Hollywood', 'played', 'great', 'part', 'making', 'violence', 'women', 'ever', 'more', 'acceptable.Patricia', 'Douglas', 'was', 'underage', 'dancer', 'girl', 'stars', 'eyes', 'innocent', 'body', 'mind', 'understanding', 'way', 'minds', 'men', 'work', 'Attending', 'Hollywood', 'party', 'where', 'boss', 'promised', 'good', 'time', 'was', 'held', 'down', 'scotch', 'forced', 'throat', 'vomited', 'then', 'violently', 'raped', 'beaten', 'rapist', 'Ross', 'was', 'never', 'prosecuted', 'Anyone', 'who', 'tried', 'bring', 'case', 'court', 'was', 'mysteriously', 'hushed', 'up', 'given', 'glam', 'job', 'MGM', 'keep', 'silent', 'Douglas', 'was', 'systematically', 'smeared', 'media', 'made', 'tart', 'woman', 'who', 'brought', 'life', 'reputation', 'were', 'destroyed.Sixty-five', 'years', 'later', 'author-screenwriter', 'David', 'Stenn', 'little', 'known', 'story', 'shock', 'Pat', 'Douglas', 'now', 'elderly', 'woman', 'still', 'alive', 'painful', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'woman', 'life', 'still', 'daily', 'affected', 'what', 'happened', 'young', 'girl', 'recluse', 'who', 'own', 'words', 'been', 'frigid', 'life', 'never', 'loved', 'anyone', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'trust', 'man', 'fought', 'wish', 'commit', 'suicide', 'pushed', 'away', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'tried', 'get', 'close', 'not', 'even', 'been', 'able', 'have', 'close', 'friendships', 'never', 'danced', 'again', 'alone', 'house', 'broken', 'woman', 'only', 'Stenn', 'unrelenting', 'respectful', 'persistence', 'finally', 'agree', 'speak', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'prolonged', 'bits', 'pieces', 'often', 'simply', 'stopping', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Patricia', 'Douglas', 'rapist', 'now', 'dead', 'Justice', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'DVD', 'now', 'story', 'public', 'anyone', 'who', 'hear', 'One', 'woman', 'spoken', 'up', 'even', 'took', '65', 'years', 'ruined', 'life', 'do', 'Truth', 'even', 'many', 'years', 'will', 'always', 'come', 'out', 'lies', 'eventually', 'surface', 'kind', 'violence', 'devastates', 'completely', 'one', 'man', 'momentary', 'violence', 'can', 'ruin', 'life', 'forever', 'Hollywood', 'listening', 'world', 'ready', 'see', 'women', 'human', 'beings', 'Flip', 'movies', 'cable', 'tonight', 'answer', 'Soon', 'telling', 'story', 'Patricia', 'Douglas', 'died', '2003']",Girl 27
