Even though this video isn't in chronological order, it does however capture MJ. It starts off in the 70's when Mj was a presenter on the A.M.A awards. This includes him presenting with Donny Osmand and other fellow artist. Mj also gets the help of his little sister Janet when presenting a couple of awards. Chris tucker giving Mj the aritst of the century award-real cute.MJ honoring Barry Gordy. Then it goes into the 80's of MJ solo career and winning awards. LIke favorite soul single form ""don't stop till you get enough"" and of couse soul album ""off the wall"" you see rare clips of Mj and Diana Ross competing for favorite album, as well as winning soul male artist. Great clips. And of course the album of the history, Mj winning all those awards for thriller, it is so nice to have the entire of him speaking. Eddy Murphy presenting MJ with the pioneer award and another-it is so cute to watch this clip, this is when Eddie talks about MJ ""BAd"" album accomplishments. It goes into Mj winning ""remember the time"" song and he has an injured ankle, and Eddie giving him a bad time about it..And of course MJ winning favorite pop/rock album-Dangerous, then it goes into the 2002 world art awards, oh and my favorite Mj winning the video of the year ""scream"" and he has the cute hair style, and Janet comes up to the podium and does most of the talking-Excellent, But when he receives the award from Morgan Freeman-I got teary eyed b/c MJ was so humbled by this mans presents and honored it was just touching. And we can't forget MJ presenting James Brown with the life time achievment award and how his speach made you cry..There is so much more awards given to Mj for his humantarian work, Millium achievement award, and when he is presenting award at the NAACP and he talks from his heart about the ordeal he was going through - Very touchingThere is a clip about him talking about his ""heal the world"" foundation in its entirety-excellent, yet cute he talks about the importance of balancing a family and career, then he goes into trying to get a date in..There is an after party show inwhich Mj goes into great detail of his goals,accomplishments, and how he truly appreciated the fans support during trying times..It last for a good half in hour, he also explains a bit more on Tommy Mottala. When Mj received his legend award in Japan he got teary eyed and it was humbling to see.There is also Mj at James Brown funeral giving a brief speech, short and to the point..But it ends with his final curtain call ""This is it"" you can't help but cry, knowing this man had left one heck of a legacy, and what a profound career. I love my dvd, it has been remastered although their are a couple of clips that are okay, the majority of it is great quality. Who ever put this together realized shotty work don't sell. I am glad I purchased it, I can go back in time and see mj as his finest, giving and receiving awards, listening to his voice, seeing that beautiful smile that lights up the room. Knowing he loved from the depth of his soul..I promise you won't be disappointed it is one for your collection. Thanks Mj for the memories, may we make you proud..",5,""" Remember the time""",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,3347,"['three', 'hour', 'dvd', 'worth', 'watching', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'more', 'admiration', 'king', 'pop', 'awards', 'had', 'missed', 'years', 'mj', 'now', 'finger', 'tips', 'Even', 'video', ""n't"", 'chronological', 'order', 'however', 'capture', 'MJ', '70', 'when', 'Mj', 'was', 'presenter', 'A.M.A', 'awards', 'presenting', 'Donny', 'Osmand', 'other', 'fellow', 'artist', 'Mj', 'also', 'help', 'little', 'sister', 'Janet', 'when', 'presenting', 'couple', 'awards', 'Chris', 'tucker', 'giving', 'Mj', 'aritst', 'century', 'award-real', 'cute.MJ', 'honoring', 'Barry', 'Gordy', 'Then', '80', 'MJ', 'solo', 'career', 'winning', 'awards', 'LIke', 'favorite', 'soul', 'single', 'form', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'till', 'get', 'enough', 'couse', 'soul', 'wall', 'see', 'rare', 'clips', 'Mj', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'competing', 'favorite', 'album', 'as', 'well', 'winning', 'soul', 'male', 'artist', 'Great', 'clips', 'course', 'album', 'history', 'Mj', 'winning', 'awards', 'thriller', 'so', 'nice', 'have', 'entire', 'speaking', 'Eddy', 'Murphy', 'presenting', 'MJ', 'pioneer', 'award', 'another-it', 'so', 'cute', 'watch', 'clip', 'when', 'Eddie', 'talks', 'MJ', 'BAd', 'album', 'accomplishments', 'Mj', 'winning', 'remember', 'time', 'song', 'injured', 'ankle', 'Eddie', 'giving', 'bad', 'time', 'it..And', 'course', 'MJ', 'winning', 'favorite', 'pop/rock', 'album-Dangerous', 'then', '2002', 'world', 'art', 'awards', 'oh', 'favorite', 'Mj', 'winning', 'video', 'year', 'scream', 'cute', 'hair', 'style', 'Janet', 'up', 'podium', 'most', 'talking-Excellent', 'when', 'award', 'Morgan', 'Freeman-I', 'got', 'teary', 'eyed', 'b/c', 'MJ', 'was', 'so', 'humbled', 'mans', 'presents', 'honored', 'was', 'just', 'touching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'MJ', 'presenting', 'James', 'Brown', 'life', 'time', 'achievment', 'award', 'how', 'speach', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'awards', 'given', 'Mj', 'humantarian', 'work', 'Millium', 'achievement', 'award', 'when', 'presenting', 'award', 'NAACP', 'heart', 'ordeal', 'was', 'going', 'Very', 'clip', 'talking', 'heal', 'world', 'foundation', 'entirety-excellent', 'yet', 'cute', 'importance', 'balancing', 'family', 'career', 'then', 'trying', 'get', 'date', 'in..There', 'party', 'show', 'inwhich', 'Mj', 'great', 'detail', 'goals', 'accomplishments', 'how', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'fans', 'support', 'trying', 'times..It', 'last', 'good', 'half', 'hour', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'Tommy', 'Mottala', 'When', 'Mj', 'received', 'legend', 'award', 'Japan', 'got', 'teary', 'eyed', 'was', 'humbling', 'see.There', 'also', 'Mj', 'James', 'Brown', 'funeral', 'giving', 'brief', 'speech', 'short', 'point..But', 'final', 'curtain', 'call', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cry', 'knowing', 'man', 'had', 'left', 'one', 'heck', 'legacy', 'what', 'profound', 'career', 'love', 'dvd', 'been', 'remastered', 'are', 'couple', 'clips', 'are', 'okay', 'majority', 'great', 'quality', 'Who', 'ever', 'put', 'together', 'realized', 'shotty', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'mj', 'finest', 'giving', 'receiving', 'awards', 'listening', 'voice', 'seeing', 'beautiful', 'smile', 'up', 'room', 'Knowing', 'loved', 'depth', 'soul..I', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'one', 'collection', 'Thanks', 'Mj', 'memories', 'may', 'make', 'proud..']",Michael Jackson - The Awards Collection
