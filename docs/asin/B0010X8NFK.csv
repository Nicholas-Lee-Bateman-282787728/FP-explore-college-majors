1127567,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0010X8NFK,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 1]","A spoof movie, another product of current stupefying lampoons for a sub-genre heading into the wrong direction.  A spoof is usually defined as a composition that imitates or misrepresents somebody's style, usually in a humorous way.  Therefore, if such composition has no humor to deliver, then the very point of the movie has been self-defeated.  The problem: slapstick.  It seems as though whenever a parody is made, somebody has to get hit by something.  Hear are the highlights of ""The Comebacks"": a football player getting ran over by a bus, and then gets crippled by a cashew, a mentally-challenged inspiration trips from his shopping cart and dry-humps the teacher (isn't ""Radio"" a parody in itself?), a 90-year-old Balboa-ish character got punched and turned into dust, and the running gag of people getting pummeled by opposing football players even when they're not on the field; heck, the movie even went to absurd extremes like in the ""Dodgeball"" parody when the coach shoots a nerd in the chest with a handgun...yet the nerd survives.Can I get a parody that's actually clever and witty without someone getting hurt?  Fair enough, the movie did tried some verbal pizazz, though they're either people jokingly explaining the premise of the movie it's parodying (""Invincible"") or make easy ironic suggestions, such as the coach telling his team to fail at academics.  Sometimes, the movie just got silly, like a gymnast who balanced a board with her tongue or a rival football player showing his My Little Pony locker.  The jokes are recycled (oh, like the ""Lucas"" parody hasn't been done before), and what's worse, some of them are throw-aways.  Many of its parodies (like the mentioned ""Rocky Balboa"" parody) exist for for a few seconds and have no impact, cohesion, or comprehension to the plot, like a post-cancellation episode of ""Family Guy"" and just as humorless.But thankfully ""The Comebacks"" is JUST about physical comedy, it didn't try to cringe me with toilet-related business.  As far as spoofs go, this movie does followed closely to the genre it's making fun of...unlike films by a certain directing duo.  Outside that one bizarre scene where the cast is singing and goofing around to a Journey song (at least it's not a ""Sopranos"" reference), there's no jokes about a popular heiress or an unrelated movie, just jokes revolving around sports films.  It does have one clever parody, and it's a Friday Night Lights spoof ; the humor itself isn't good, but the scene was shot in documentary style like that movie, which I thought was a nice touch.  I admit to giggling a few scenes like the ""Die Sad"" speech regarding a terminally-ill kid's wish, and Carl Weathers is a living saving grace; out of all the deliberate stereotypes and dumb characters, he's the only character I actually underestimated.  See, in the plot, he helped his best friend Fields (David Koechner) coach a usual brand of unusual football players, even though Fields is the most incompetent coach in football history; once the movie explained about Weathers's goal, it actually makes sense.Here's what I don't understand: how is it that great parodies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" do so well using the same comedy elements that didn't work for this film? Is it because of the times, or maybe because they had old people in it? Or maybe these movies simply follow one parody and go nuts with it?  The latter is probably the right call, since this movie tries to machine-gun many parodies, and ended up missing almost every one.",2,Below Average Punt,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,3526,"['spoof', 'movie', 'product', 'current', 'stupefying', 'lampoons', 'sub-genre', 'heading', 'wrong', 'direction', 'spoof', 'usually', 'defined', 'composition', 'somebody', 'style', 'usually', 'humorous', 'way', 'Therefore', 'such', 'composition', 'humor', 'deliver', 'then', 'very', 'point', 'movie', 'been', 'self-defeated', 'problem', 'slapstick', 'whenever', 'parody', 'made', 'somebody', 'get', 'hit', 'something', 'are', 'highlights', 'Comebacks', 'football', 'player', 'getting', 'ran', 'over', 'bus', 'then', 'crippled', 'cashew', 'mentally-challenged', 'inspiration', 'trips', 'shopping', 'cart', 'dry-humps', 'teacher', ""n't"", 'Radio', 'parody', '90-year-old', 'Balboa-ish', 'character', 'got', 'punched', 'turned', 'dust', 'running', 'gag', 'people', 'getting', 'pummeled', 'opposing', 'football', 'players', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'field', 'heck', 'movie', 'even', 'went', 'absurd', 'extremes', 'Dodgeball', 'parody', 'when', 'coach', 'shoots', 'nerd', 'chest', 'handgun', 'yet', 'nerd', 'survives.Can', 'get', 'parody', 'actually', 'clever', 'witty', 'someone', 'getting', 'hurt', 'Fair', 'enough', 'movie', 'did', 'tried', 'verbal', 'pizazz', ""'re"", 'people', 'jokingly', 'explaining', 'premise', 'movie', 'parodying', 'Invincible', 'make', 'easy', 'ironic', 'suggestions', 'such', 'coach', 'telling', 'team', 'fail', 'academics', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'just', 'got', 'silly', 'gymnast', 'who', 'balanced', 'board', 'tongue', 'rival', 'football', 'player', 'showing', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'locker', 'jokes', 'are', 'recycled', 'oh', 'Lucas', 'parody', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'what', 'worse', 'are', 'throw-aways', 'Many', 'parodies', 'mentioned', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'parody', 'exist', 'few', 'seconds', 'have', 'impact', 'cohesion', 'comprehension', 'plot', 'post-cancellation', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', 'just', 'humorless.But', 'thankfully', 'Comebacks', 'JUST', 'about', 'physical', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'cringe', 'toilet-related', 'business', 'As', 'far', 'spoofs', 'go', 'movie', 'followed', 'closely', 'genre', 'making', 'fun', 'films', 'certain', 'directing', 'duo', 'one', 'bizarre', 'scene', 'where', 'cast', 'singing', 'goofing', 'around', 'Journey', 'song', 'least', 'not', 'Sopranos', 'reference', 'jokes', 'popular', 'heiress', 'unrelated', 'movie', 'just', 'jokes', 'revolving', 'sports', 'films', 'have', 'one', 'clever', 'parody', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'spoof', 'humor', ""n't"", 'good', 'scene', 'was', 'shot', 'documentary', 'style', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'admit', 'giggling', 'few', 'scenes', 'Die', 'Sad', 'speech', 'regarding', 'terminally-ill', 'kid', 'wish', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'living', 'saving', 'grace', 'deliberate', 'stereotypes', 'dumb', 'characters', 'only', 'character', 'actually', 'underestimated', 'See', 'plot', 'helped', 'best', 'friend', 'Fields', 'David', 'Koechner', 'coach', 'usual', 'brand', 'unusual', 'football', 'players', 'even', 'Fields', 'most', 'incompetent', 'coach', 'football', 'history', 'once', 'movie', 'explained', 'Weathers', 'goal', 'actually', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'great', 'parodies', 'Airplane', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'using', 'same', 'comedy', 'elements', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'times', 'maybe', 'had', 'old', 'people', 'maybe', 'movies', 'simply', 'follow', 'one', 'parody', 'go', 'nuts', 'latter', 'probably', 'right', 'call', 'movie', 'machine-gun', 'many', 'parodies', 'ended', 'up', 'missing', 'almost', 'one']",The Comebacks

Included with the clich&eacute;s is an great cast and an awesome number of cameos from Stacy Keibler, Will Arnett, Dax Shepard, and Bradley Cooper.  As absurd as this sounds, The Combacks is perfect for not just sports and dumb comedy fans, but all movie-goers.

1127577,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0010X8NFK,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","Spoofs of films have been around for some time. They began to make headway with the genre takes on films by Mel Brooks. Then in 1980 it all changed when the film AIRPLANE hit the screens. After that send ups of specific films and the like became a staple out of Hollywood. It seems now that the trend, though not dead, is suffering its last gasps.THE COMBACKS is a spoof of the sports films seen in the last decade or so. Coach Limbeau Fields (David Koechner) is the losingest coach of all time no matter what the sport. When an old friend lets him know about a college football team in need of a new coach, he decides to give it one last try.Of course the team is a bunch of malcontents and hopeless ball handlers, with one gifted player who tragedy is certain to strike. Every movie from RADIO to FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS to REMEMBER THE TITANS finds a home in this flick, but not a very funny one. The jokes are lame at best and vulgar at worst. It seems that when a joke can't be found in a parody these days the answer is to resort to the rudest thing possible.By the films end we discover that the coach's friend (played by Carl Weathers) wasn't a friend at all but using the coach to lead a possible contender against his team down the wrong path. A rallying cry from the team and the coach leads this motley crew to the finals. But will the win? Who cares!For me a comedy is a film that makes me laugh out loud more than once. I found one thing that made me do so during the 107 minutes that this film ran and that was a pretty weak laugh at that. Koechner can be hilarious and has the potential to do great comedy, but not if he continues to settle for films like this. For a better example of a good job he's done, watch RUN RONNIE RUN.The previews for this movie made me want to see it. But, as is often the case these days, the previews showed the best parts. And they were shown often enough that once I got to see the movie they were no longer funny.If you're looking for a good movie to rent this week pass this one by. Look for something else new on the shelf. Or better yet, look for either AIRPLANE or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.

Sure, it could have been funnier, but compared to some of the recent crap coming out in these parody, slapstick comedies, it's better then those.",3,A parody about Football and sports movies.,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,982,"['always', 'good', 'spoof/parody', 'movie', 'tho', 'one', 'not', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Monty', 'Python', ""Zucker's/Abraham"", 'Wayan', 'brothers', 'movie', 'compared', 'crappy', 'parody', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'lately', 'Epic', 'Movie', 'one', 'refreshing', 'see', 'someone', 'else', 'take', 'puck', 'parody', 'type', 'movie.Unlike', 'Epic', 'Movie', 'actually', 'got', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'one.This', 'one', 'fun', 'Gridiron', 'Gang', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'errr', 'other', 'football', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'sports', 'few', 'guest', 'appearances', 'athletes', 'such', 'Dennis', 'Rodman', 'guy', 'NIKE', '10', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'Australian', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'NHL', 'Also', 'Mad', 'TV', 'Frank', 'Caliendo', 'doing', 'commentator', 'impressions', 'such', 'John', 'Madden', 'end', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'taking', 'bit', 'too', 'seriously', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'thing', 'Sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'compared', 'recent', 'crap', 'coming', 'out', 'parody', 'slapstick', 'comedies', 'better', 'then']",The Comebacks

They do have a few jokes here and there that are really funny, but you have to stomach 5 or 6 horribly bad jokes in-between decent jokes.  And I don't mean &#34;bad&#34; in terms of inappropriate or offensive (since I don't offend easily), I mean &#34;bad&#34; in terms of likely being the product of someone with no actual sense of humor struggling to write jokes.  It's not even &#34;so bad it's good,&#34; but just pathetic and unwatchable.

The first time I watched this, it cracked me up and I had a great time and loved the movie. Second time, I thought it sucked big time.Only difference was, the first time I watched it, I was loopy on fever medication.So my advice is, watch this when you're loopy on meds and this movie might appear a lot funnier than it really is.
