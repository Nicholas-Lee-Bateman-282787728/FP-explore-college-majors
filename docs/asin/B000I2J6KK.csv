1018538,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,B000I2J6KK,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[2, 2]","What strikes a Western viewer in watching this well-made, well-paced film of the terrorists in Hamburg who plotted the 9/11 Twin Towers attacks:  they're all men.When you consider the Communist movements, the German terrorists of the Red Factor, both men and women conspired together, for their own ideological dreams of transforming society away from capitalism by killing industrial leaders.The Red takeover of Russia and then the Soviet Republics were predominantly male,but not all.The Chinese Revolution incorporated a lot of Chinese women, some of whom were the worst in enforcing rules as the Red Guards of the 1960's.But in this particularly ideology, that the ""West"" must admit to their humiliating Islam for centuries and be punished, one sees that in fact it is a strong sense of male-bonding that is involved.  ""Islam"" includes women, but they're very peripheral in this film even when one terrorist is married and visits his own mother back home in Lebanon.I enjoyed seeing how these born-again fundamentalists Arabic males, priviledged and wealthy enough to go to Germany in the 1990's to study, see evil and corruption all around them, rather than glorying in the beauty and advanced living standards of the highly developed German towns and universities.  If in fact it is the wealth and advanced educational, transport, health and city planning standards that these Arabs feel inferior to, it is ironic that they should so despise it at such a young age.  Why not be curious, explore and enjoy it?  Bring back new ideas and technologies to their own downtrodden peoples and nations?Out of fear of change, perhaps out of fear of women and their own sexual impulses, these desperate fellows decide, step by step, that the destruction of the USA and its sidekick Israel is the main goal... not to emulate, but to bring down, what they envy.We see the newly arrived Zaid, 21, handsome and fresh-faced off a plane from Lebanon, Islamic by tradition, secual in reality, Catholic in his education, arriving in Greifswald, Germany to live in a student dorm and learn German.  They must do their own chores, learn to cook and so on, which from their economic level is a come-down.  Zaid adjusts, enjoys all kinds of pleasures around him, and finds a girlfriend from Turkey quickly, a dental student.  Soon they're living together, as young folks in GErmany usually do.Why the focus on this fellow of all the 29 terrorists that were involved, is clear:  he has family, love, a great future, an uncle in Greifswald to keep an eye on him, money and security, plus his whole life ahead of him.  Why would he turn to such hate and anger?  We see in the film how he is selected at a lunchtable, with the talk quickly turning to Islam, then an invitation to an Islamic study session.He follows up, enjoys the male companionship and Arabic friendliness and language, perhaps out of homesickness or awkwardness in German society.  He learns from them to reject ""the West"" and the culture he's come to learn from.To my mind, his conversion is not completely convincing, and one sees from his facial blankness that he is not 100% enthusiastic, yet he's on a slippery slope, as those who attended Communist meetings often found themselves in the 1920's and 1930's.I encourage others to see this British/Canadian/German production to judge for themselves about the characters and their motivations in turning so angrily against all that they yearned for in their own countries.  Was it all sour grapes?On a personal note, I lived in Germany myself in the early 1980's but did not have the money to be a student, so I simply learned German on my own by talking to people.  I met poor Turks who did the same on park benches with elderly Germans, who greatly appreciated that they had moved to a better country and could learn so much.  They were homesick, naturally, but they loved their opening horizons, and so did I.Perhaps the biggest handicapp these ""boys"" had: they were already the priviledged in their home countries and were resentful of not just the West's wealthy, but the equality of women which had come with it.  The lack of male bonding in German society (from which they were excluded anyway, say, a round of beer drinking) made them lonely and unhappy until they found each other.  One emotion led to the next.Too simplified?  Maybe not.",4,A male-only we-have-been-wronged but-we're-right gang,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,4347,"['What', 'Western', 'viewer', 'watching', 'well-made', 'well-paced', 'film', 'terrorists', 'Hamburg', 'who', 'plotted', '9/11', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'attacks', ""'re"", 'men.When', 'consider', 'Communist', 'movements', 'German', 'terrorists', 'Red', 'Factor', 'men', 'women', 'conspired', 'together', 'own', 'ideological', 'dreams', 'transforming', 'society', 'away', 'capitalism', 'killing', 'industrial', 'leaders.The', 'Red', 'takeover', 'Russia', 'then', 'Soviet', 'Republics', 'were', 'predominantly', 'male', 'not', 'all.The', 'Chinese', 'Revolution', 'incorporated', 'lot', 'Chinese', 'women', 'whom', 'were', 'worst', 'enforcing', 'rules', 'Red', 'Guards', ""1960's.But"", 'particularly', 'ideology', 'West', 'must', 'admit', 'humiliating', 'Islam', 'centuries', 'be', 'punished', 'one', 'fact', 'strong', 'sense', 'male-bonding', 'involved', 'Islam', 'women', ""'re"", 'very', 'peripheral', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'terrorist', 'married', 'own', 'mother', 'back', 'home', 'Lebanon.I', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'how', 'born-again', 'fundamentalists', 'Arabic', 'males', 'priviledged', 'wealthy', 'enough', 'go', 'Germany', '1990', 'study', 'see', 'evil', 'corruption', 'rather', 'glorying', 'beauty', 'advanced', 'living', 'standards', 'highly', 'developed', 'German', 'towns', 'universities', 'fact', 'wealth', 'advanced', 'educational', 'transport', 'health', 'city', 'planning', 'standards', 'Arabs', 'feel', 'inferior', 'ironic', 'should', 'so', 'despise', 'young', 'age', 'Why', 'not', 'be', 'curious', 'explore', 'enjoy', 'Bring', 'back', 'new', 'ideas', 'technologies', 'own', 'downtrodden', 'peoples', 'nations', 'fear', 'change', 'perhaps', 'fear', 'women', 'own', 'sexual', 'impulses', 'desperate', 'fellows', 'decide', 'step', 'step', 'destruction', 'USA', 'sidekick', 'Israel', 'main', 'goal', 'not', 'emulate', 'bring', 'down', 'what', 'envy.We', 'see', 'newly', 'arrived', 'Zaid', '21', 'handsome', 'fresh-faced', 'off', 'plane', 'Lebanon', 'Islamic', 'tradition', 'secual', 'reality', 'Catholic', 'education', 'arriving', 'Greifswald', 'Germany', 'live', 'student', 'dorm', 'learn', 'German', 'must', 'do', 'own', 'chores', 'learn', 'cook', 'so', 'economic', 'level', 'come-down', 'Zaid', 'kinds', 'pleasures', 'girlfriend', 'Turkey', 'quickly', 'dental', 'student', 'Soon', ""'re"", 'living', 'together', 'young', 'folks', 'GErmany', 'usually', 'focus', 'fellow', '29', 'terrorists', 'were', 'involved', 'clear', 'family', 'love', 'great', 'future', 'uncle', 'Greifswald', 'keep', 'eye', 'money', 'security', 'whole', 'life', 'ahead', 'Why', 'would', 'turn', 'such', 'hate', 'anger', 'see', 'film', 'how', 'selected', 'lunchtable', 'talk', 'quickly', 'turning', 'Islam', 'then', 'invitation', 'Islamic', 'study', 'session.He', 'up', 'male', 'companionship', 'Arabic', 'friendliness', 'language', 'perhaps', 'homesickness', 'awkwardness', 'German', 'society', 'reject', 'West', 'culture', 'come', 'learn', 'from.To', 'mind', 'conversion', 'not', 'completely', 'convincing', 'one', 'sees', 'facial', 'blankness', 'not', '100', '%', 'enthusiastic', 'yet', 'slippery', 'slope', 'who', 'attended', 'Communist', 'meetings', 'often', 'found', '1920', ""1930's.I"", 'encourage', 'others', 'see', 'British/Canadian/German', 'production', 'judge', 'characters', 'motivations', 'turning', 'so', 'angrily', 'yearned', 'own', 'countries', 'Was', 'sour', 'grapes', 'personal', 'note', 'lived', 'Germany', 'early', '1980', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'money', 'be', 'student', 'simply', 'learned', 'German', 'own', 'talking', 'people', 'met', 'poor', 'Turks', 'who', 'did', 'same', 'park', 'benches', 'elderly', 'Germans', 'who', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'had', 'moved', 'better', 'country', 'could', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'were', 'homesick', 'naturally', 'loved', 'opening', 'horizons', 'so', 'did', 'I.Perhaps', 'biggest', 'handicapp', 'boys', 'had', 'were', 'already', 'priviledged', 'home', 'countries', 'were', 'resentful', 'not', 'just', 'West', 'wealthy', 'equality', 'women', 'had', 'come', 'lack', 'male', 'bonding', 'German', 'society', 'were', 'excluded', 'anyway', 'say', 'round', 'beer', 'drinking', 'made', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'found', 'other', 'One', 'emotion', 'led', 'next.Too', 'simplified', 'Maybe', 'not']",THE HAMBURG CELL

The film is simple, yet extremely compelling. The acting is superb, and the characters are portrayed not as frothing at the mouth lunatics, but as the rather ordinary-albeit demented-young men that they were. The film succeeds in showing how one can go from a shy, secular, college student, to an angry, brainwashed, religious zealot. From the several books that I have read on the subject, the film seems to be very accurate. Conspiracy theories notwithstanding, this is the true story of the 9/11 hijackers and how they came to be the most infamous men of our generation.

1018540,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000I2J6KK,The Mysterious Traveler,"[1, 3]","THE HAMBURG CELL(2004) Directed by Antonia Bird.Starring Alexander Siddig as Sheikh Khaled Mohammed.A sort of side B to PATH TO 9/11 as this Canadian film followsMohammed Atta, Ziad Jarrah and the rest of the Muslim Barbarians asthey recruit, get recruited, become good Muslims(aka plot to murderinfidels and Jews) and prepare for the September 11, 2001 attacks onthe United States while operating out of Hamburg, Germany and is, as ageneral rule, quite good.The production crew hired the actors based on their race ratherthan their talent(they state as much in the extras) so the performancesare not as good as they could be but since the hijackers were inhumanmonsters, the undevelped nature of the performances has an unintendedeffect of showing just how beyond the pale these creatures were. Thefilm makes the laughable assertions that Bill Clinton's fault was thathe was too aggressive fighting Al Qaeda in the 90s and if he had justignored them, they would have gone away and that George Bush was/is toopassive--utter nonsense of course but presumably it is there to toassure good reviews and to prevent the film being censored/suppressedas PATH TO 9/11 has been by the Left.The film also makes the mistake dramatically of fast forwarding to show the destruction the terroristswill wreck as they are boarding the planes. This is unneccesary and thefilm should have just stayed with the screen going white as iteventually does. The viewer does not need to see what will happen. Alsothe film soils itself somewhat by showing the Twin Towers and thecrater in Pennsylvania but NOT the Pentagon--which is ratherdistasteful. Again better not to have shown anything at all.Anyway all of the above are minor points and quibles on what ison the whole a solid film that not only covers the events leading up to9/11 from the enemies' side but also gives that rare tight focusexamination on Muslim barbarism, the mind set, the hatred, theindoctrination, the idealogy and the love of death that, as of thiswriting, Hollywood in all of its liberal/ America hating/Bush loathingfrenzy has not yet managed to touch upon even once.Well worth the viewer's time. An important film. A goodhistorical docudrama of the type that should be made more often.
