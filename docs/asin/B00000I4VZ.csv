She is unaware that something very strange has been happening since her last visit. Something is lurking about, and it's NOT friendly! Amy notices odd things, but really starts to worry when her cat gets eaten! A scientist happens along, and Amy reluctantly joins forces w/ him to deal w/ the creature. It appears that a mutant lizard is on the loose. The thing bites Amy's finger and escapes. After killing it, the scientist examines it, and discovers that the little beastie has sharp fangs w/ a venomous bite. The pair wind up stranded after getting the car stuck, and hike to the closest neighbor's cabin for help. Oh no! The neighbor's been stripped to the bone by a gaggle of mutants! Luckily, he left the gas stove on full blast, so Amy takes out her trusty matches annnd... KA-BOOOM! Back at her own cabin, Amy and Marshal (the science guy) find out that the monster was pregnant! Now, the offspring are somewhere in the cabin! Luckily, Amy has a rifle, and she's a crack shot! POP! POP! POP! (it's a small caliber rifle) POP! What the...? This generation of mutants has adapted! They are now impervious to bullets, and they shoot venom like super-soakers! Amy and Marshal are going to have to do some adapting of their own if they want to survive the night. These things evolve fast, becoming more invulnerable after each attack. ABERRATION is a silly / cheeezy monster movie w/ some interesting monsters. It also has a nice, gruesome plot twist near the end.

502116,AUDIJM3VUULS7,B00000I4VZ,Charles Tatum,"[6, 10]","Pamela Gidley is Amy, who arrives at an isolated cabin in the woods. She is packing a whole lot of cash, and a whole lot of cute. The cabin has not been used in years, and we find out she used to go there as a child. She cleans the place up and she and her trusty cat make themselves at home. She frequents the general store of nice Mrs. Miller (Helen Moulder), and she meets Marshall (Simon Bossell), a field researcher.Marshall is investigating why all the wildlife in the area is disappearing. He is collecting bags of what can only be described as goop, and begins suspecting a new species of animal is eating everything in the woods. This corresponds with Amy's discovery of goop in her cabin, which she blames on mice. As Amy gets some heavy duty rat spray, her car conveniently breaks down, and she heads back to the cabin with Marshall. A convenient blizzard blows upon the film. The screenplay and acting blows so far, so why not a blizzard? Our ""heroes"" discover weird neighbor Peterson being eaten alive in his own cabin, and blow the cabin up. This starts one very long set piece as the couple finds time to bicker cute in between killing the awful lizard puppets.And then there's Yuri. Yuri (Valery Nikolaev) is Amy's former boyfriend who arrives demanding his money. They fleeced a few people in Chicago, and Amy split with the dough. Yuri brings a four wheel drive, a couple of guns, and an attitude. Perfect monster lizard bait. He is dispatched. The couple then blow up the cabin.Amy and Marshall, still bickering, flee in the four wheel drive which breaks down in a field because of the lizards. So they blow it up. They flee to Mrs. Miller's store, taking a lizard with them, and blow it up. The viewer pours lighter fluid on his television during the end credits, and blows it up.Although set in the United States, this was shot in New Zealand, and it shows. Amy and Marshall are the most unpleasant couple I have ever had the disservice to cheer for. Director Tim Boxell spent all of his money on the gore effects, so for every disgusting bloody lizard stomping, there is a horrible puppet lizard effect.Dumb ideas are introduced, then dropped. Amy loads a super soaker with poison, then it is never used. Where did it come from? Why is the gas still turned on to a cabin that has sat vacant for over a decade? Why does Mrs. Miller keep referring to living in a small town, when she and Peterson seem to be the only occupants and her store the only building? Where did the dang lizards come from in the first place? Much is made of the lizards able to spray poison from their mouths, yet this only happens twice! For ninety three minutes, this is one long dull boring film.""Aberration"" has gained a weird cult status, according to some other reviews I have read on other sites. Do not believe them, this is an awful awful film. I do not recommend it.This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, profanity, and brief female nudity.",1,Tim Boxell's Aberration,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2988,"['Pamela', 'Gidley', 'Amy', 'who', 'isolated', 'cabin', 'woods', 'packing', 'whole', 'lot', 'cash', 'whole', 'lot', 'cute', 'cabin', 'not', 'been', 'used', 'years', 'find', 'out', 'used', 'go', 'there', 'child', 'place', 'up', 'trusty', 'cat', 'make', 'home', 'general', 'store', 'nice', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'Helen', 'Moulder', 'Marshall', 'Simon', 'Bossell', 'field', 'researcher.Marshall', 'investigating', 'why', 'wildlife', 'area', 'disappearing', 'collecting', 'bags', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'goop', 'suspecting', 'new', 'species', 'animal', 'eating', 'everything', 'woods', 'Amy', 'discovery', 'goop', 'cabin', 'mice', 'Amy', 'heavy', 'duty', 'rat', 'spray', 'car', 'conveniently', 'down', 'back', 'cabin', 'Marshall', 'convenient', 'blizzard', 'film', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'blows', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'blizzard', 'heroes', 'discover', 'weird', 'neighbor', 'Peterson', 'being', 'eaten', 'alive', 'own', 'cabin', 'blow', 'cabin', 'up', 'one', 'very', 'long', 'set', 'piece', 'couple', 'time', 'bicker', 'cute', 'killing', 'awful', 'lizard', 'puppets.And', 'then', 'Yuri', 'Yuri', 'Valery', 'Nikolaev', 'Amy', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'demanding', 'money', 'fleeced', 'few', 'people', 'Chicago', 'Amy', 'split', 'dough', 'Yuri', 'four', 'wheel', 'drive', 'couple', 'guns', 'attitude', 'Perfect', 'monster', 'lizard', 'bait', 'dispatched', 'couple', 'then', 'blow', 'up', 'cabin.Amy', 'Marshall', 'still', 'bickering', 'flee', 'four', 'wheel', 'drive', 'down', 'field', 'lizards', 'blow', 'up', 'flee', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'store', 'taking', 'lizard', 'blow', 'up', 'viewer', 'lighter', 'fluid', 'television', 'end', 'credits', 'up.Although', 'set', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'shot', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Amy', 'Marshall', 'are', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'couple', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'disservice', 'cheer', 'Director', 'Tim', 'Boxell', 'spent', 'money', 'gore', 'effects', 'so', 'disgusting', 'bloody', 'lizard', 'stomping', 'horrible', 'puppet', 'lizard', 'effect.Dumb', 'ideas', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'dropped', 'Amy', 'super', 'soaker', 'poison', 'then', 'never', 'used', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'Why', 'gas', 'still', 'turned', 'cabin', 'sat', 'vacant', 'decade', 'Why', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'keep', 'referring', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'when', 'Peterson', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'occupants', 'store', 'only', 'building', 'Where', 'did', 'dang', 'lizards', 'come', 'first', 'place', 'Much', 'made', 'lizards', 'able', 'spray', 'poison', 'mouths', 'yet', 'only', 'twice', 'ninety', 'three', 'minutes', 'one', 'long', 'dull', 'boring', 'film', 'Aberration', 'gained', 'weird', 'cult', 'status', 'according', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'sites', 'Do', 'not', 'believe', 'awful', 'awful', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'it.This', 'rated', 'R', 'strong', 'physical', 'violence', 'strong', 'gun', 'violence', 'strong', 'gore', 'profanity', 'brief', 'female', 'nudity']",Aberration VHS

502120,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B00000I4VZ,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","Years ago a young Sid had caught the end of Aberration, not knowing the title or really much about the movie at that time. We were surprised to blindly stumble across it the other evening and had to go for it all these years later. From what we remember it seemed really cool....however we couldn't have been more wrong. This movie couldn't have moved at a slower pace. It was almost like watching Santa go out for a pass while nobody is guarding him, and no matter how hard he runs it looks like it's in slow motion as the ball flies 35 yards over his head.Aberration starts with some broad whose hiding out in a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. She just stole a bunch of scratch from the Russian mob and now is trying to keep things on the down low. While at the cabin all her food starts getting mangled up by some type of creature, which turn out to be some ravenous killer lizards. She enlists the help of some back woods loser who thought this film was his big break. He was like ""oh yeah I gotta have that, I ain't leaving the beach til I see him."" Really, we're going with Dice references right now? Anyway these two ball bags start a war against these plastic lizards with very little success. The bad part was the first hour was all dialogue boring everyone to tears. By time the lizards start tearing it up you're barely conscious to enjoy it.Really Aberration was a big let down considering what we thought it would be. Anytime you're main start is a bunch of plastic lizards purchased at Toys R Us, how do you not deliver a 5 star event. The things were seriously plastic lizards! All they did was move their mouths and get dragged around by a string to simulate movement. That in itself was the only reason for the 2 stars. We saw more action in the Ramada room that Saturday night when Santa yelled ""call the front desk, there's a snake in the room!"" after mistaking his specs for the reptile. Even the knock off M&M;'s and red hots that were spilled all over the floor were more entertaining then this mess. All we could say at the end was ""enjoying the show bi**hes?""",2,The plastic lizards were by far the best actors here,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,2092,"['Years', 'ago', 'young', 'Sid', 'had', 'caught', 'end', 'Aberration', 'not', 'knowing', 'title', 'really', 'much', 'movie', 'time', 'were', 'surprised', 'blindly', 'stumble', 'other', 'evening', 'had', 'go', 'years', 'later', 'what', 'remember', 'seemed', 'really', 'cool', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'moved', 'slower', 'pace', 'was', 'almost', 'watching', 'Santa', 'go', 'out', 'pass', 'nobody', 'guarding', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'slow', 'motion', 'ball', '35', 'yards', 'head.Aberration', 'broad', 'hiding', 'out', 'remote', 'cabin', 'middle', 'woods', 'just', 'stole', 'bunch', 'scratch', 'Russian', 'mob', 'now', 'trying', 'keep', 'things', 'down', 'low', 'cabin', 'food', 'getting', 'mangled', 'up', 'type', 'creature', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'ravenous', 'killer', 'lizards', 'help', 'back', 'woods', 'loser', 'who', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'break', 'was', 'oh', 'yeah', 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'ai', ""n't"", 'leaving', 'beach', 'til', 'see', 'Really', ""'re"", 'going', 'Dice', 'references', 'right', 'now', 'Anyway', 'two', 'ball', 'bags', 'start', 'war', 'plastic', 'lizards', 'very', 'little', 'success', 'bad', 'part', 'was', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'dialogue', 'boring', 'everyone', 'tears', 'time', 'lizards', 'start', 'tearing', ""'re"", 'barely', 'conscious', 'enjoy', 'it.Really', 'Aberration', 'was', 'big', 'let', 'down', 'considering', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Anytime', ""'re"", 'main', 'start', 'bunch', 'plastic', 'lizards', 'purchased', 'Toys', 'R', 'Us', 'how', 'do', 'not', 'deliver', '5', 'star', 'event', 'things', 'were', 'seriously', 'plastic', 'lizards', 'did', 'was', 'move', 'mouths', 'get', 'dragged', 'around', 'string', 'simulate', 'movement', 'was', 'only', 'reason', '2', 'stars', 'saw', 'more', 'action', 'Ramada', 'room', 'Saturday', 'night', 'when', 'Santa', 'yelled', 'call', 'front', 'desk', 'snake', 'room', 'mistaking', 'specs', 'reptile', 'Even', 'knock', 'M', 'M', 'red', 'hots', 'were', 'spilled', 'floor', 'were', 'more', 'entertaining', 'then', 'mess', 'could', 'say', 'end', 'was', 'enjoying', 'show']",Aberration VHS
