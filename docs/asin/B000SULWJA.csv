This is only a bundle of the show's three season DVD sets. As it is you will pay about forty dollars more for these three seasons in a bundle than you would if you just bought the three seasons separately.I hate to compare this show to Buffy, but it does merit comparisons in several ways - the snappy dialogue, a teenage girl as resourceful heroine, an overall season-long story arc, plus each individual episode has a mystery to be solved that is pretty much stand-alone. The final comparison is that Veronica Mars, like Buffy, seemed to lose something once Veronica went to college. Buffy had three great seasons before this happened, Veronica Mars only two. Since Veronica Mars didn't have the sizeable ardent core fan base and surrounding mythology that Buffy had when it went through its troubled college transitional season, and ratings were quite bad during its third season, the show was cancelled. However, if you liked the first two seasons of Veronica Mars you should enjoy the third, and it is worth owning.

1087847,A3L577V8TY26GN,B000SULWJA,D. Jester,"[1, 1]","I thought the first two seasons of this were excellent, the 3rd season a bit of a let down. Veronica Mars is sort of a latter day Nancy Drew, and she often has personal involvement in her cases. There are ongoing multiple plots which make this good for repeated viewing as well. Often witty and cleverly written, many remarks will probably be lost on some of the younger viewers, who I am sure make up much of the target audience, as most of the primary players are high school students. Kristen Bell is nothing less than fabulous in her lead role, and Enrico Colantano, who plays her father, Keith Mars, does an outstanding job, also. If I have any criticism of this at all, it would be that a clue or the needed help to find a clue is sometimes a bit too convenient. That is to say, now and then Veronica seems to luck into something, or just happens to be in the right place at the right time. Probably nothing other detective shows are not guilty of, though. I suspect that this show was slated for cancellation about 1/2 way through the 3rd season, as that was when it really lost steam. In fact, the 3rd season was so weak compared to the first two, that if I were buying these again, I would seriously consider only buying the first two seasons, especially if that was a cheaper option.",5,5 Stars mainly for the first 2 seasons,1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,1293,"['thought', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'excellent', '3rd', 'season', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'sort', 'latter', 'day', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'often', 'personal', 'involvement', 'cases', 'are', 'ongoing', 'multiple', 'plots', 'make', 'good', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'as', 'well', 'Often', 'witty', 'cleverly', 'written', 'many', 'remarks', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'lost', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'am', 'sure', 'make', 'up', 'much', 'target', 'audience', 'most', 'primary', 'players', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'nothing', 'less', 'fabulous', 'lead', 'role', 'Enrico', 'Colantano', 'who', 'father', 'Keith', 'Mars', 'outstanding', 'job', 'also', 'have', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'clue', 'needed', 'help', 'find', 'clue', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'too', 'convenient', 'say', 'now', 'then', 'Veronica', 'luck', 'something', 'just', 'happens', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'Probably', 'nothing', 'other', 'detective', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'guilty', 'suspect', 'show', 'was', 'slated', 'cancellation', '1/2', 'way', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'when', 'really', 'lost', 'steam', 'fact', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'weak', 'compared', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'buying', 'again', 'would', 'seriously', 'consider', 'only', 'buying', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'especially', 'was', 'cheaper', 'option']","Veronica Mars: The Complete Series, Seasons 1-3"

1087850,A2ICXHRW6YS0UE,B000SULWJA,John M Williams,"[0, 0]",After reviewing &#34;Veronica Mars&#34; the movie I decided to &#34;add my two cents worth&#34; to the series. This is a cult like series with the people who have followed it.The nitwits at the network first debuted it against Fox's series &#34;House&#34; then for the second season they powers the be decided to match it up with &#34;Lost&#34; (the most over rated series). A brief showing on CBS did not pull off the needed bump. Veronica Mars is the perfect example of &#34;girl power&#34;. From being &#34;Miss Popular&#34; to becoming an social outcast when she support her father who stepped on the wrong toes in investigating the murder of her best friend. You have a mature women who decided &#34;To heck what others think&#34; and showed the same loyalty to her friends. My favorite over all episode (there were no bad ones) was Season 2's &#34;One Angry Veronica&#34; when she was on a jury who's case was a &#34;Slam dunk&#34;. After picking holes in the prosecution case she infuriated the person who suggested she be the foreman and the of course the wrong doers were brought to justice pending their appeal.

1087853,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B000SULWJA,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[37, 38]","For my three-hundredth review, I am pleased to give ""Veronica Mars"" five glowing stars.  I will try my best to keep this review short, because I tend to gush when I talk about this show at length; so keeping things simple seems to be the best way to go about this.THE PLOT: Veronica Mars is an intelligent young girl (Junior in High School when the series beings, Freshman in college when it ends) with a Private Detective father, a bad reputation, and a whole mess of ambition.  She often takes on her own PI duties, sometimes looking into small things like petty theft for classmates, but she also gets serious when a bigger case hits close to home.  The majority of VM episodes are standalone, but both of the first two seasons also form bigger stories, in that you can watch an episode by itself, but watching a whole season forms a bigger, coherent story line.  The third season, instead, is divided into three sections, the first two being shorter mystery arcs, and the final five episodes being completely standalone.  The plotting of ""Veronica Mars,"" especially in the first two seasons, is ideal for television because the story is kept fresh with each episode offering side mysteries, but the pay-off of the ""big mystery"" at the end of a season is heart attack inducingly climatic.THE WRITING: Here is where I start gushing.  The writing simply couldn't be better.  Much like Joss Whedon ofBuffyfame, the writers of this show--headed by creator Rob Thomas--find a perfect balance between drama and comedy, driving it all forward by snappy dialogue and some of the best characters you'll see on television.  Also, the consistency of this show's writing is literally unrivaled.  Even the most quality of television shows (such asAngel,Six Feet Under,Firefly,Wonderfalls, and the aforementioned Buffy) tend to have weaker and stronger episodes, but ""Veronica Mars"" goes on for stretches of virtually flawless episode after flawless episode.  The weakest writing you'll find is in late Season Three, when the network demanded that each episode be self-contained, but it's also astonishing to see how the writers worked with these restrictions and still made television better than 99.9 etcetera percent of stuff out there.THE CAST: Kristen Bell stars as Veronica, and it's pretty much pointless to talk about how great she is, because then I KNOW I'll start with the gushing... but I'll say this:  Her performances are laced with subtext and deep understanding of the character, and her chemistry with her nearly equally brilliant cast mates is a physical force.  She can make you split your sides laughing one moment and cry the next.  The rest of the cast--particularly Jason Dohring, Enrico Colantoni, and Ryan Hansen--are all phenomenal at playing their characters.EVERYTHING ELSE: The special effects in this show are actually rather good.  There are many dream/flashback sequences, and the lighting and coloring of those scenes highly contribute to the mood of the show.  The extras are great (there are a few in the first two seasons and an entire disc for the third).Critics (everyone from Joss Whedon, to Kevin Smith, to Stephen King, to pretty much anyone with taste) love it, fans still mourn its wrongful cancellation, and I can pretty much guarantee that you will fall in love with this show.  It's one of the best I've seen, if not the best.  That's it.10/10 Classic.",5,Can't Help But Love It,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,3387,"['three-hundredth', 'review', 'am', 'pleased', 'give', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'five', 'glowing', 'stars', 'will', 'try', 'best', 'keep', 'review', 'short', 'tend', 'gush', 'when', 'talk', 'show', 'length', 'so', 'keeping', 'things', 'simple', 'be', 'best', 'way', 'go', 'this.THE', 'PLOT', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'intelligent', 'young', 'girl', 'Junior', 'High', 'School', 'when', 'series', 'beings', 'Freshman', 'college', 'when', 'Private', 'Detective', 'father', 'bad', 'reputation', 'whole', 'mess', 'ambition', 'often', 'own', 'PI', 'duties', 'sometimes', 'looking', 'small', 'things', 'petty', 'theft', 'classmates', 'also', 'serious', 'when', 'bigger', 'case', 'close', 'home', 'majority', 'VM', 'episodes', 'are', 'standalone', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'also', 'form', 'bigger', 'stories', 'can', 'watch', 'episode', 'watching', 'whole', 'season', 'forms', 'bigger', 'coherent', 'story', 'line', 'third', 'season', 'instead', 'divided', 'three', 'sections', 'first', 'two', 'being', 'shorter', 'mystery', 'arcs', 'final', 'five', 'episodes', 'being', 'completely', 'standalone', 'plotting', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'especially', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'ideal', 'television', 'story', 'kept', 'fresh', 'episode', 'offering', 'side', 'mysteries', 'pay-off', 'big', 'mystery', 'end', 'season', 'heart', 'attack', 'inducingly', 'climatic.THE', 'WRITING', 'Here', 'where', 'start', 'gushing', 'writing', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'Much', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'ofBuffyfame', 'writers', 'show', 'headed', 'creator', 'Rob', 'Thomas', 'find', 'perfect', 'balance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'driving', 'forward', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'best', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'see', 'television', 'Also', 'consistency', 'show', 'writing', 'literally', 'unrivaled', 'Even', 'most', 'quality', 'television', 'shows', 'such', 'asAngel', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Firefly', 'Wonderfalls', 'aforementioned', 'Buffy', 'tend', 'have', 'weaker', 'stronger', 'episodes', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'stretches', 'virtually', 'flawless', 'episode', 'flawless', 'episode', 'weakest', 'writing', ""'ll"", 'find', 'late', 'Season', 'Three', 'when', 'network', 'demanded', 'episode', 'be', 'self-contained', 'also', 'astonishing', 'see', 'how', 'writers', 'worked', 'restrictions', 'still', 'made', 'television', 'better', '99.9', 'etcetera', 'percent', 'stuff', 'there.THE', 'CAST', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Veronica', 'pretty', 'much', 'pointless', 'talk', 'how', 'great', 'then', 'KNOW', ""'ll"", 'start', 'gushing', ""'ll"", 'say', 'performances', 'are', 'laced', 'subtext', 'deep', 'understanding', 'character', 'chemistry', 'nearly', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'mates', 'physical', 'force', 'can', 'make', 'split', 'sides', 'laughing', 'one', 'moment', 'cry', 'next', 'rest', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'Enrico', 'Colantoni', 'Ryan', 'Hansen', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'playing', 'characters.EVERYTHING', 'ELSE', 'special', 'effects', 'show', 'are', 'actually', 'rather', 'good', 'are', 'many', 'dream/flashback', 'sequences', 'lighting', 'coloring', 'scenes', 'highly', 'contribute', 'mood', 'show', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'entire', 'disc', 'third', '.Critics', 'everyone', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Stephen', 'King', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', 'taste', 'love', 'fans', 'still', 'mourn', 'wrongful', 'cancellation', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'show', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'best', 'it.10/10', 'Classic']","Veronica Mars: The Complete Series, Seasons 1-3"
