They deal with public domain material and some other TV shows, movies, etc. They exist as a *budget* company. They bring things to DVD that the studios may never release from their own label. They keep the price way down because they do not remaster, have the DVDs in the regular type of holding format.If you got this set pristine, not in paper sleeves, subtitles, etc - you would be paying the regular price for ""all 101 episodes from all five seasons"". The regular studios can have 1 season for $29-$59 dollars.Please take note of the price vs. the studio releases from the show's makers, etc. The price is excellent, and I have waited so long for this series, I am glad *someone* has released it. Mill Creek seems to be more into getting more non-public domain stuff on DVD & I thank them for it.You're getting this at full Amazon price of a mere $39.78 (Full retail is still *much* lower than a regular producer-studio release would be for 101 episodes over *5* seasons).We could have waited for the studio that produced PB to release it - but they never did.Please keep track of which company releases the TV series, movie, etc.Please - buy and enjoy.If it wasn't for Mill Creek, the *ONLY* option you would have *is* BOOTLEG.Mill Creek is definitely better than bootleg.Buy it.Enjoy it.Be thankful it is out at all from a commercial company.PS- I use CAPS for emphasis only, never for e-shouting.",5,"Finally, Someone Has Released Pacific Blue!

Loved every chase and stunts sequences in this series! And its finally out on DVD.. Its been a long time coming!!! Even better is that its selling at such an affordable price for all five seasons of this show. At such an affordable price, don't expect fancy packaging for the DVDs. Its a simple packaging with a thick DVD hard box. Inside, there are 19 discs in total, each disc is kept in a paper disc sleeve. Picture quality is ok for the price, not digitally remastered or anything, but its standard DVD definition and definitely viewable. Sound is just as good.The first 3 seasons of the show was great. New cast members were added in season 4 when Rick Rossovich and Marco Ferraez left after season 3. Unfortunately, the show went downhill from season 4 onwards when the writers/producers went for a different style of writing and look for the show. It ended after 101 episodes in season 5. But it was a good 5 year run of Pacific Blue, and not many expected the show to even last 5 years. I'm glad it did and its really great to have all the seasons finally out on DVD.The only downside I found from this set is that it doesn't include any subtitles. Other than that, I'd still give it 5 stars for the fact that this show is finally out on DVD! Highly recommended!

1505107,A1SAEOF9I44U6Y,B005X7HA8K,Patrickj Fennell,"[1, 3]","The first three seasons was cutting edge, good storylines, (not great), great stunts and of course great looking stars for both male and female viewers. There was something about seeing crimes solved by cops in spandex.Two of the original stars left the show, and three new cast members were added. It was a great show to watch for different reasons, like watching movies on Mystery Theater 3000 and for teh same reasons. Pacific Blue all of a sudden became F-Troup on bikes. The first episode of season 4 had the rookies go undercover at a college and one of the new cops, Jeff Stearns, did drugs and the blonde Shanna Moakly is constantly trying to pick-up the Lt. played by Jim Davidson while Darlene Vogel stews, meanwhile Paula Tricky has a thing for Mario Lopez after getting pregnant after a one-night stand and Amy Hunter has a sorrid past.The three new additions are terrible cops, Davidson screws up constantly by allowing the nitwits to try to solve crimes and go undercover and there is always a sopa opera feel to the two final seasons although all of the stars are hardly worth cheering for. The writers must have done acid before writing the scripts, becuae there are so many plot holes and even with civil service protection for police officers everyone of them would and should have been fired. Santa Monica was never safe with these spandex clad crime fighters around.It is one misadventure after another and great for pure laughs and seeing sexy women in spandex and revealing outfits, and for the girls the men may not be classic actors, but nice eye candy reading scripts. There was a good reason this show was never nominated for an Emmy, but surely if Mystery Theater 3000 ever does spoofs on tv shows this one is right there with My Mother The Car.",3,A tale of two Pacific Blues,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,1772,"['first', 'three', 'seasons', 'was', 'cutting', 'edge', 'good', 'storylines', 'not', 'great', 'great', 'stunts', 'course', 'great', 'looking', 'stars', 'male', 'female', 'viewers', 'was', 'something', 'seeing', 'crimes', 'solved', 'cops', 'spandex.Two', 'original', 'stars', 'left', 'show', 'three', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'added', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'watch', 'different', 'reasons', 'watching', 'movies', 'Mystery', 'Theater', '3000', 'teh', 'same', 'reasons', 'Pacific', 'Blue', 'sudden', 'became', 'F-Troup', 'bikes', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '4', 'had', 'rookies', 'go', 'undercover', 'college', 'one', 'new', 'cops', 'Jeff', 'Stearns', 'did', 'drugs', 'blonde', 'Shanna', 'Moakly', 'constantly', 'trying', 'pick-up', 'Lt.', 'played', 'Jim', 'Davidson', 'Darlene', 'Vogel', 'stews', 'meanwhile', 'Paula', 'Tricky', 'thing', 'Mario', 'Lopez', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Amy', 'Hunter', 'sorrid', 'past.The', 'three', 'new', 'additions', 'are', 'terrible', 'cops', 'Davidson', 'up', 'constantly', 'allowing', 'nitwits', 'try', 'solve', 'crimes', 'go', 'undercover', 'always', 'sopa', 'opera', 'feel', 'two', 'final', 'seasons', 'stars', 'are', 'hardly', 'worth', 'cheering', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'acid', 'writing', 'scripts', 'becuae', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'even', 'civil', 'service', 'protection', 'police', 'officers', 'everyone', 'would', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fired', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'was', 'never', 'safe', 'spandex', 'clad', 'crime', 'fighters', 'around.It', 'one', 'misadventure', 'great', 'pure', 'laughs', 'seeing', 'sexy', 'women', 'spandex', 'revealing', 'outfits', 'girls', 'men', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'classic', 'actors', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'reading', 'scripts', 'was', 'good', 'reason', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'surely', 'Mystery', 'Theater', '3000', 'ever', 'spoofs', 'tv', 'shows', 'one', 'right', 'there', 'My', 'Mother', 'Car']",Pacific Blue-Complete Series
