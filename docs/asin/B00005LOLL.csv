The Perfect Nanny is one of my favorite movies featuring Nelson, and is well worth a watch.  The acting is good and overall, it's a good story, although somewhat violent.The plot thickens when Nelson's unfaithful, controlling husband tries to ""re-enter"" her life, causing her to go somewhat ""amok,"" and eventually she murders him to get the man of ""her dreams,"" a doctor whom she housekeeps for and doubles as nanny for his two children.If you like Nelson, and a plot that is interesting, The Perfect Nanny is for you.",5,The Perfect Nanny,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,582,"['LOVE', 'Tracey', 'Nelson', 'not', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'name', 'Perfect', 'Nanny', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'featuring', 'Nelson', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'acting', 'good', 'overall', 'good', 'story', 'somewhat', 'violent.The', 'plot', 'thickens', 'when', 'Nelson', 'unfaithful', 'controlling', 'husband', 'tries', 're-enter', 'life', 'causing', 'go', 'somewhat', 'amok', 'eventually', 'get', 'man', 'dreams', 'doctor', 'whom', 'doubles', 'nanny', 'two', 'children.If', 'Nelson', 'plot', 'interesting', 'Perfect', 'Nanny']",The Perfect Nanny

The dvd plays like a bootleg video it has little to no volume, I had to increase the volume of my television to 100 which is the maximum volume level.

I am an avid shopper of dvd's from Amazon.com, I am just very upset over the poor quality of this purchase.
