The eps ""English Countryside"" and ""Ireland Coast"" are like magical fairy tales.  I've seen probably every ep of Passport to Europe, and these British eps (along w/ Austria and Switzerland) are my favorites.  Samantha as always is a charming host.  Her sense of humor is great and these eps are particularly fun because there is no language barrier between her and the locals.  Every interaction will make you smile and most will make you laugh.  These episodes are whimsical, witty, wonderful...if you are armchair traveling, this is the trip you want to take.",5,Everything you dream about,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,658,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'England', 'Ireland', 'show', 'made', 'trip', 'priority', 'list', 'eps', 'English', 'Countryside', 'Ireland', 'Coast', 'are', 'magical', 'fairy', 'tales', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'probably', 'ep', 'Passport', 'Europe', 'British', 'eps', 'w/', 'Austria', 'Switzerland', 'are', 'favorites', 'Samantha', 'always', 'charming', 'host', 'sense', 'humor', 'great', 'eps', 'are', 'particularly', 'fun', 'language', 'barrier', 'locals', 'interaction', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'most', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'episodes', 'are', 'whimsical', 'witty', 'wonderful', 'are', 'armchair', 'traveling', 'trip', 'want', 'take']","Passport to Europe: England, Ireland and Scotland"

However, if you're on a budget and are looking for tips on thrifty travel- you might want to look to Rick Steves (his dvd series; or his yearly ""Europe Through The Back Door"" book series).  Samantha definitely indulges in the finer aspects of travel (specifically when it comes to what hotels she stays in).  Despite that, I find her travel series unique and informative.Now, the reason for my 4 star rating: I've watched this, and the France/Italy DVD with my hearing impaired  grandmother.  Sadly, there was NO closed caption, or even subtitles for her to read!  I'm pretty certain that the episodes that air on the Travel Channel are CC; and subtitles are pretty standard on all DVD's.

1069703,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B000PC6YSU,Colleen M. Schneider,"[1, 1]","This dvd really fit the bill for me in helping me plan what I may want to see/do in the UK.  Although London itself is huge you cannot really delve into everything that is out there and do it all justice, this gives you a small slice of classic London, some of the big tourist sites, the English Countryside, Edinburgh and Ireland.  The only area I had already visited was Ireland and I think it did a nice job in giving you a small slice of what the countryside looks like, though it is in no way a comprehensive dvd of all areas.The narrator/traveller, Samantha Brown is charming.  She asks questions you might ask yourself and has a self-deprecating sense of humor and a willingness to try it all.  You can tell she enjoys travel and has a real sense of humor about it.  She often gives her own personal opinion, as when she visits Piccadilly Circus and claims it really is too chaotic and crazy for her, but that is her own opinion.  I like the fact she seems very honest and genuine and it makes watching her adventures that much more fun.The dvd is beautifully photographed and it felt like a pre-vacation just seeing the sites that I hope to someday see in person.Overall, a great dvd to give you a small sampling of what the UK offers and a wide range of sites and activities.

1069709,A3MBC0WNEAP7AS,B000PC6YSU,Leonard,"[1, 1]","This review only pertains to the two London episodes. Those episodes were not as bad as her Paris episodes (which were an epic fail). However, I felt that she only covered a small portion of London. It's impossible to see all of London in a week, but she could've done a better job.She starts her tour of London in Trafalgar Square. Samantha then headed to the iconic Changing of the Guards ceremony. Many seasoned travelers think this is touristy, but if you've never been to London before, you want to see this. Samantha gave good advice on vantage points for the ceremony. Samantha also said that there were more royal guards at St. James Palace, which was useful advice. However, Samantha talked too much during the ceremony (her lame attempts at humor are an annoying distraction throughout the DVD).Samantha took a London black cab. The cab was spacious and ornate. The cabbie was a friendly and informative man. He told her about a good fish and chips place. The fish and chips that Samantha bought looked delicious. Samantha ate it in the cab, which I felt was tacky.Samantha stopped by the House of Parliament and explained that Big Ben is name of the bell within the tower, not the entire structure. She also stopped by Westminster Abbey, which is a beautiful Gothic church.No Samantha Brown visit to a foreign city is complete without her getting wasted. She visited a pub. I learned that unlike in America, Londoners are allowed to drink alcohol on the street.In the other London episode, she visited the Burlington Arcade, which is a glass enclosed shopping center. Next, she visited Harrods. It is the most impressive store I've ever seen. It looks more like a museum than a store. It puts Macy's Herald Square to shame. After her visit to Harrods, she walked along the River Thames and passed by the Tower Bridge. Samantha explained the difference between the Tower Bridge and the London Bridge (the London Bridge is NOT the big, medieval-looking bridge. That's the Tower Bridge).Samantha rode the London Underground. It is a complex system, but the staff were friendly and helpful. The carriages (trains) were small, but nice. Later, Samantha rode the London Eye. The views are impeccable.At Leicester (lester) Square, Samantha purchased theatre tickets from TKTS. She said that purchasing from TKTS saves people 50% off the cost of tickets at the theatre box office.Samantha passed by Piccadilly Circus. Like Times Square, it is a major hub with large neon billboards. Samantha didn't like the area. She felt she would be mugged. I found that hard to believe since it is a densely populated downtown area.Samantha stopped by the Madame Tussauds wax museum. It was not my cup of tea. I would've preferred she visit the British Museum or Science Museum. After a visit to the Notting Hill Portobello Road street market and an Indian restaurant, she concluded her trip at the Tate Modern museum.This DVD showed many popular attractions in London. Nevertheless, much of London was missing. In a 45 minute episode, you can only show so much of London. I wish she spent less time giving commentary about each hotel she stays at and more time actually exploring the city. Still, this DVD is worth purchasing. If you want a more comprehensive DVD about London, purchase Globe Trekker's Ultimate London.",3,Fun but incomplete tour of London,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,3310,"['review', 'only', 'two', 'London', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Paris', 'episodes', 'were', 'epic', 'fail', 'However', 'felt', 'only', 'covered', 'small', 'portion', 'London', 'impossible', 'see', 'London', 'week', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'job.She', 'tour', 'London', 'Trafalgar', 'Square', 'Samantha', 'then', 'headed', 'iconic', 'Changing', 'Guards', 'ceremony', 'Many', 'seasoned', 'travelers', 'think', 'touristy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'London', 'before', 'want', 'see', 'Samantha', 'gave', 'good', 'advice', 'vantage', 'points', 'ceremony', 'Samantha', 'also', 'said', 'were', 'more', 'royal', 'guards', 'St.', 'James', 'Palace', 'was', 'useful', 'advice', 'However', 'Samantha', 'talked', 'too', 'much', 'ceremony', 'lame', 'attempts', 'humor', 'are', 'annoying', 'distraction', 'DVD', '.Samantha', 'took', 'London', 'black', 'cab', 'cab', 'was', 'spacious', 'ornate', 'cabbie', 'was', 'friendly', 'informative', 'man', 'told', 'good', 'fish', 'chips', 'place', 'fish', 'chips', 'Samantha', 'bought', 'looked', 'delicious', 'Samantha', 'ate', 'cab', 'felt', 'was', 'tacky.Samantha', 'stopped', 'House', 'Parliament', 'explained', 'Big', 'Ben', 'name', 'bell', 'tower', 'not', 'entire', 'structure', 'also', 'stopped', 'Westminster', 'Abbey', 'beautiful', 'Gothic', 'church.No', 'Samantha', 'Brown', 'visit', 'foreign', 'city', 'complete', 'getting', 'wasted', 'visited', 'pub', 'learned', 'America', 'Londoners', 'are', 'allowed', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'street.In', 'other', 'London', 'episode', 'visited', 'Burlington', 'Arcade', 'glass', 'enclosed', 'shopping', 'center', 'Next', 'visited', 'Harrods', 'most', 'impressive', 'store', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'more', 'museum', 'store', 'Macy', 'Herald', 'Square', 'shame', 'visit', 'Harrods', 'walked', 'River', 'Thames', 'passed', 'Tower', 'Bridge', 'Samantha', 'explained', 'difference', 'Tower', 'Bridge', 'London', 'Bridge', 'London', 'Bridge', 'NOT', 'big', 'medieval-looking', 'bridge', 'Tower', 'Bridge', '.Samantha', 'rode', 'London', 'Underground', 'complex', 'system', 'staff', 'were', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'carriages', 'trains', 'were', 'small', 'nice', 'Later', 'Samantha', 'rode', 'London', 'Eye', 'views', 'are', 'impeccable.At', 'Leicester', 'lester', 'Square', 'Samantha', 'purchased', 'theatre', 'tickets', 'TKTS', 'said', 'purchasing', 'TKTS', 'people', '50', '%', 'cost', 'tickets', 'theatre', 'box', 'office.Samantha', 'passed', 'Piccadilly', 'Circus', 'Times', 'Square', 'major', 'hub', 'large', 'neon', 'billboards', 'Samantha', 'did', ""n't"", 'area', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'mugged', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'densely', 'populated', 'downtown', 'area.Samantha', 'stopped', 'Madame', 'Tussauds', 'wax', 'museum', 'was', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'visit', 'British', 'Museum', 'Science', 'Museum', 'visit', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Portobello', 'Road', 'street', 'market', 'Indian', 'restaurant', 'concluded', 'trip', 'Tate', 'Modern', 'museum.This', 'DVD', 'showed', 'many', 'popular', 'attractions', 'London', 'Nevertheless', 'much', 'London', 'was', 'missing', '45', 'minute', 'episode', 'can', 'only', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'London', 'wish', 'spent', 'less', 'time', 'giving', 'commentary', 'hotel', 'more', 'time', 'actually', 'exploring', 'city', 'Still', 'DVD', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'want', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'DVD', 'London', 'purchase', 'Globe', 'Trekker', 'Ultimate', 'London']","Passport to Europe: England, Ireland and Scotland"
