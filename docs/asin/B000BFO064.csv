The film debuted at Sundance to a standing ovation. Jenny's husband (whom she recently seperated from) John Asher directed the film. Jenny stars in the film as a beautiful photographer named Rebecca who comes home to find her male model boyfriend boinking another girl. Rebecca melts down and can't understand why one crazy thing after another happens to her. She cries, her mascara runs. Her ex trashes her prized possession and a bald guy barfs on her. There is a lot of gross stuff in the movie but it's funny and endearing. It reminds me of a late 80's early 90's kind of film like ""Naked Gun"" or something. Her friends are kind of misfits too. Carmen Electra stars as a stereotyped ghetto girl named Michelle. The ghetto around the way girl thing was very over the top. It's a different role for Carmen. Rebecca's other friend in the film is a ditsy actress named Carrie. Rebecca attempts to gain revenge or on ex or at least make him a little jealous.

He seems unphased by the whole incident and proceeds to destroy all of her photographic equipment and kick her out of their house. Completely abandoned, she turns to her friends - Michelle, Carrie and John - for help and stays with them while trying to recover from her break-up.The film was written by McCarthy and has some very funny moments, while some of the jokes are hit and miss. There are also some genuinely uncomfortable moments - the escapade in the supermarket being one of them - but the film has such a good heart that its really hard to not like it. Especially given that McCarthy loves to make a fool out of herself, as do the rest of the cast.Overall, the film has endured some harsh criticism given that its actually not that bad and is worth a watch, especially if you like Jenny McCarthy and Carmen Electra, who makes an amusing appearance as Rebecca's friend who thinks she's black.",3,Underrated and amusing,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1277,"['Dirty', 'Love', 'not', 'being', 'funniest', 'comedy', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'had', 'moments', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'very', 'talented', 'comedienne', 'who', 'more', 'credit', 'usually', 'awarded.McCarthy', 'stars', 'Rebecca', 'young', 'photographer', 'who', 'great', 'life', 'supermodel', 'boyfriend', 'cheating', 'woman', 'unphased', 'whole', 'incident', 'proceeds', 'destroy', 'photographic', 'equipment', 'kick', 'house', 'Completely', 'abandoned', 'friends', 'Michelle', 'Carrie', 'John', 'help', 'stays', 'trying', 'recover', 'break-up.The', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'McCarthy', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'jokes', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'are', 'also', 'genuinely', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'escapade', 'supermarket', 'being', 'one', 'film', 'good', 'heart', 'really', 'hard', 'not', 'Especially', 'given', 'McCarthy', 'make', 'fool', 'herself', 'do', 'rest', 'cast.Overall', 'film', 'endured', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'given', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'worth', 'watch', 'especially', 'like', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'who', 'amusing', 'appearance', 'Rebecca', 'friend', 'who', 'black']",N/A

This woman is drop-dead sexy, funny, laid-back, down-to-earth, very talented, and she does not take a whole lot serious, did I mention sexy as hell? I think I did, Anyway, with all that going for her, I was really looking forward to this. So, ya, it sucked, what a let-down. Save for a few comedic moments, it's rather boring and alot of the jokes are just in poor taste and generally not very funny.Jenny over-acts big time, I'm thinking she ad-libbed alot of her lines, but since her future x-hubby directed this, he pretty much let her do whatever the hell she wanted to, and that's not a good thing. She hams it up so bad it's almost like you can hear her saying, ""everyone look at me, I'm a superstar, it's all about me""When she tones it down she actually delivers a couple of very funny lines, but unfortunately they are far and few between.Carmen Electra co-stars, and she had alot of the same things going for her that Jenny does, just not quite as hot. But she is just wrong in this movie, she tries to be all ""sister"" and we never get a reason why, she's white, the Sum 41 lead singer even tells her this when he is trying to pick her up in a bar. So, again, like Jenny, Carmen over-acts big time.I mentioned earlier that some of the jokes were in poor taste,and I'll give you an example. Jenny is on her period, and while shopping, she starts to bleed all over the place, of course both bathrooms are occupied so she is running all over the store, leaking everywhere. So, the manager is over-heard on the  intercom asking someone for cleanup everytime Jenny has an accident. Really not funny, in fact, it's rather gross. In another scene, Jenny goes to some guys apartment after the date and he puts a fish up his ass asking her to please touch his bass, again, big miss-fire.I did laugh a few times, mostly during Kam Heskin's scenes, she plays Jenny's ditsy best friend along with Carmen. She is very charming and very cute and hopefully we will get to see more of her in the future. John Asher directs, and I guess right after this he and Jenny filed for divorce, I'm thinking she watched this and couldn't take it. But, to be fair, John shoudn't get all the ""credit"" for this, Jenny McCarthy wrote and produced and also helped with the screenplay.Also, to lure us in, this movie gets the ""unrated"" tag, which is a total joke. I admit, one of the reasons I watched this was hoping for some Jenny and Carmen nudity (sorry, but what do ya expect?) But all we get is a shot of Jenny's breasts covered in puke, sorry, but that's not what I was hoping for. It could have easily been an ""R"" 'cuz all we get is alot of crude, very crude toilet humor and alot of bad language.

941689,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BFO064,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","""Dirty Love"" is one of those movies where you laugh at things are embarrassed that you have done so. For me it came in a scene where Rebecca Parker (Jenny McCarthy) is being hit on by a guy at a store.  When his girl friend shows up, he says she was hitting on him, at which point Jenny slaps him, and more slapping ensues.  This might be the first time I have laughed this much at face slapping since I was a kid and watched the Three Stooges, but I did laugh.  However, for the most part I was rather stunned by what passed for humor in this film, specifically with regards to touching the bass and the cleanup in aisle three (On the one hand I want to be circumspect, so as not to spoil the experience of watching this movie, but on the other hand I might be so cryptic that your curiosity is aroused and you check this movie out and then regret doing so, which pretty much means I am sunk either way.  Oh, well).Jenny McCarthy wrote the script for this 2005 comedy and it was directed by her husband John Mallory Asher.  The couple have a child together and although they have filed for a divorce, she has written another movie ""Rollin,"" that he is supposed to direct, next year.  The interesting thing is not so much that they would want to continue to work together after getting divorced, but that they would want to make another film about ""Dirty Love.""  The fact McCarthy wrote the script is interesting because that means she is making herself do all of the things she does in this movie, even if it makes more sense if her husband was putting her through all of this.I guess the idea is to prove that McCarthy has a good sense of humor, which is supposed to mean that she can laugh at herself.  Well, certainly she is willing to laugh at herself, but what her choices of topics for comedy do not really suggest she has a good sense of humor, in the sense that she knows what is really funny.  The plot of the movie is a standard romance.  Rebecca comes home and finds her boyfriend having sex with another woman.  Rebecca is down in the dumps over being dumped, and her attempts to meet another guy are seriously doomed.  Meanwhile, her friend John (Eddie Kaye Thomas), who has loved Rebecca from the moment he saw here, is trying to get up enough courage to make his affection known.  However, his initial overture is too subtle for Rebecca to understand.  Still, we know how this one is going to go.Rebecca has a pair of friends, Michelle (Carmen Electra) and Carrie (Kam Heskin), who pretty much prove their our not friends when Rebecca is in desperate need.  In the grand scheme of things this was the part that actually ended up offending me the most, and not what happens in the supermarket afterwards.  In the end, I round up on ""Dirty Love"" because it did provoke laughter, even if inappropriate and because I think McCarthy is more talented than Pamela Anderson and Anna Nicole Smith put together.  It is just that his film makes you think she gets that honor by default, which is not a good thing.",3,Jenny McCarthy laughs at herself and wants you to join in (at your own risk),1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,3018,"['Dirty', 'Love', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'laugh', 'things', 'are', 'embarrassed', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'came', 'scene', 'where', 'Rebecca', 'Parker', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'being', 'hit', 'guy', 'store', 'When', 'girl', 'friend', 'up', 'was', 'hitting', 'point', 'Jenny', 'more', 'slapping', 'ensues', 'might', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'laughed', 'much', 'face', 'slapping', 'was', 'kid', 'watched', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'did', 'laugh', 'However', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'rather', 'stunned', 'what', 'passed', 'humor', 'film', 'specifically', 'regards', 'touching', 'bass', 'cleanup', 'aisle', 'three', 'one', 'hand', 'want', 'be', 'circumspect', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'might', 'be', 'so', 'cryptic', 'curiosity', 'aroused', 'check', 'movie', 'then', 'regret', 'doing', 'so', 'pretty', 'much', 'am', 'sunk', 'way', 'Oh', 'well', '.Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'wrote', 'script', '2005', 'comedy', 'was', 'directed', 'husband', 'John', 'Mallory', 'Asher', 'couple', 'have', 'child', 'together', 'have', 'filed', 'divorce', 'written', 'movie', 'Rollin', 'supposed', 'direct', 'next', 'year', 'interesting', 'thing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'want', 'continue', 'work', 'together', 'getting', 'divorced', 'would', 'want', 'make', 'film', 'Dirty', 'Love', 'fact', 'McCarthy', 'wrote', 'script', 'interesting', 'making', 'do', 'things', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'sense', 'husband', 'was', 'putting', 'this.I', 'guess', 'idea', 'prove', 'McCarthy', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'supposed', 'mean', 'can', 'laugh', 'Well', 'certainly', 'willing', 'laugh', 'what', 'choices', 'topics', 'comedy', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'suggest', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'sense', 'what', 'really', 'funny', 'plot', 'movie', 'standard', 'romance', 'Rebecca', 'home', 'boyfriend', 'having', 'sex', 'woman', 'Rebecca', 'down', 'dumps', 'being', 'dumped', 'attempts', 'meet', 'guy', 'are', 'seriously', 'doomed', 'Meanwhile', 'friend', 'John', 'Eddie', 'Kaye', 'Thomas', 'who', 'loved', 'Rebecca', 'moment', 'saw', 'here', 'trying', 'get', 'up', 'enough', 'courage', 'make', 'affection', 'known', 'However', 'initial', 'overture', 'too', 'subtle', 'Rebecca', 'understand', 'Still', 'know', 'how', 'one', 'going', 'go.Rebecca', 'pair', 'friends', 'Michelle', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'Carrie', 'Kam', 'Heskin', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'prove', 'not', 'when', 'Rebecca', 'desperate', 'need', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'was', 'part', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'offending', 'most', 'not', 'what', 'supermarket', 'afterwards', 'end', 'round', 'up', 'Dirty', 'Love', 'did', 'provoke', 'laughter', 'even', 'inappropriate', 'think', 'McCarthy', 'more', 'talented', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Smith', 'put', 'together', 'just', 'film', 'think', 'honor', 'default', 'not', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

I really never liked her untill I saw BASEketball, and she proved she could be entertaining. Then along with her small silly role with Pamale Lee in Scary Movie 3, I was at a cross road decision wether or not to grab this movie to see how she does as the main role of the film.The film doesnt have a strong plot, She plays a women living in Hollyweed who dates a male super model untill she walks in on him screwing someone else. She cries up and down the street and fumbles into a fortune teller who tells her that her true love is a white poney or something.She then spends the rest of the movie tryin gto make her ex jelous and fumbling it up while her best friend is trying to tell her he's in love with her. The end is predictable, the plot isnt strong, and it's not something i'd want to go out and buy top keep.But it did have some funny scenes. There is a scene I thought couldve been better, but i got a laugh out of it when Jenny is running around a supermarket bleeding from her monthly curse, and around every corner is someone she knows and it's just not her day when she keeps hearing the announcments over the PA for a clean up in in the isles. And the sanitary napkin jokes go on through the next few scenes. You may need a morbid sense of humour to laugh at it tho, I see some peoples reviews didnt find it funny at all, well, you lot can just go back to thinking Napoleon Dynamite was actualy funny.It also has Carmen Elektra playing a white women acting like a black women. Why, I dont know, she kinda did an OK job of it, and showed she has some capability of charactor acting, but it became annoying by the end of the film.Also stars that guy from American Pie, he did what he could with his role but I didnt think it was anything special.This movie id say is a possible rental if you have a morbid sense of humour, if youre not into sick jokes, farts and vomit then pass it by.

I like Jenny McCarthy, but something about the movie seemed like it might be trying too hard.  And as it turns out, that's exactly why I'm not recommending this movie.McCarthy stars as Rebecca, a woman who was recently cheated on by her supermodel boyfriend.  She proceeds to have a very public but not very funny nervous breakdown.  She enlists the aid of some friends, headed up by Carmen Electra in a borderline offensive role, and Eddie Kaye Thomas of American Pie fame, who is very good in spite of his surroundings.

After watching this I would have thought jenny mccarthy could never show her face in public again, but good for her no one saw it. I can't recall a worse movie since the gingerdead man, and that was pretty bad. I wondered if gigli was worse but good for me I never saw it. What's crazy is I actually expected more out of this. I don't know, I expected maybe to laugh once? Or even turned on. It's just not funny. On any levels. And it's not sexy. It's actually fairly tame. One scene of nudity? Serious? There's some pretty gross out scenes too. Like in the supermarket buying tampax, that was really bad taste. I guess I thought it would be dirtier as far as sex and nudity and that would have saved the movie. But it didn't. Nothing could save this movie. It was just flat out bad.Now when she wrote this, who in their right mind reviewed the script and thought, we HAVE A WINNER HERE! That they actually took the time for production and costs and film this. They must have been out of their mind. It's like a 14 year old wrote it. Terrible acting. The directing. WTF? Where are you filming? And carmen electra deserves some of the biggest criticism. I was looking forward to seeing her. When I looked on the back of the DVD and saw her dressed wannabe gangsta I thought maybe that was a joke scene, I didn't think that would be her whole charecter.
