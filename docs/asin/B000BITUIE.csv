942761,A3FRM1AQBM6QDS,B000BITUIE,D. Kelly,"[6, 6]","""New York: The Center of the World"" is probably one of the finest documentaries about the construction of the twin towers of the World Trade Center. In the three hour documentary, Ric Burns successfully told the tale of New York's two mightiest landmarks through interviews with journalists, architectural critics, politicians, construction engineers, and Port Authority officials.  This film surpasses the History Channel's ""World Trade Center--The Rise And Fall Of An American Icon""  What I did however find discouraging in this fine film was the very negative ""Never To Be Seen Again"" attitude about the twin towers from some of the interviewees regarding the rebuilding of the complex.  Many worldwide including myself have felt that the towers should be rebuilt and the only one in that film who has reflected that sentiment was Phillip Petit who walked the high wire between the towers in 1974.",5,Outstanding Historical Documentary,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,900,"['New', 'York', 'Center', 'World', 'probably', 'one', 'finest', 'documentaries', 'construction', 'twin', 'towers', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'three', 'hour', 'documentary', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'successfully', 'told', 'tale', 'New', 'York', 'two', 'mightiest', 'landmarks', 'interviews', 'journalists', 'architectural', 'critics', 'politicians', 'construction', 'engineers', 'Port', 'Authority', 'officials', 'film', 'History', 'Channel', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'American', 'Icon', 'What', 'did', 'however', 'find', 'discouraging', 'fine', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'negative', 'Never', 'Be', 'Seen', 'Again', 'attitude', 'twin', 'towers', 'interviewees', 'regarding', 'rebuilding', 'complex', 'Many', 'including', 'have', 'felt', 'towers', 'should', 'be', 'rebuilt', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'who', 'reflected', 'sentiment', 'was', 'Phillip', 'Petit', 'who', 'walked', 'high', 'wire', 'towers', '1974']",American Experience: New York: The Center of the World

This dvd delves further into the conception and construction than any other.  Lots and lots of interviews with many important figures, and tons of archival footage and photographs.  This documentary goes much deeper into the politics of it all than many other documentarys on this subject.  What it does not do, however, is go into the engineering of this building, which lead to the reasons for the collapse. (There are other dvds which go into great detail on this subject.)

No sugar coating over the greed, corruption and difficulties that were involved with this project. Some who did not know may find it interesting that when they were first opened they had a great deal of difficulty filling these monstrous towers. The interior design on some of the floors actually wasted space. I remember when the towers were built and going to eat in the restaurant and seeing the circle of shops surrounding the eating area. They were ugly then and were never pretty to look at. This is a real picture of what came to symbolize more than the destruction of real estate property. Families will never be the same since that shameful morning almost ten years ago.
