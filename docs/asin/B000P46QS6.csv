1068420,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000P46QS6,Christopher Culver,"[0, 2]","AMAZING GRACE: JEFF BUCKLEY is a documentary by Nyla Bialek Adams and Laurie Trombley on the 1990s cult musician who released one album, the superb GRACE, toured it around the world, and then tragically drowned while recording a follow-up. Promo DVDs of AMAZING GRACE have long been auctioned off or passed around fans, but as I write this Columbia Records is set to release the documentary in June 2009 as part of theGrace Around the World. Some of the footage of Jeff is taken from Sony's sepia-hued electronic press kit (available on theGRACE Legacy Edition) or theLive in ChicagoDVD. But most it is is never-before-seen footage of Jeff, from early video of him outside Sin-e to Australian radio interviews late in his career. All four of the musicians who collaborated with Jeff Buckley on GRACE are interviewed, as are friends, his mother Mary Guibert, critics, DJ's, record industry moguls, and musicians influenced by him.This is fairly entertaining viewing for fans. However, the biggest weakness of this documentary is that it is an authorized biography insistent on total adulation. Among their comments on Jeff's struggles with his second album, no one raises the very real possibility that he had hit a creative dead end and was destined to be a one-hit wonder. Jeff's life was haunted by the figure of his absent father Tim Buckley, but Tim Buckley and whatever inspiration he might have had on Jeff get nary a mention here. A documentary produced by the BBC a few years prior gave a much more balanced picture of Buckley's life, as have some of the print biographies.",3,"Entertaining, but suffers from the lack of any critical angle",1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,1581,"['AMAZING', 'GRACE', 'JEFF', 'BUCKLEY', 'documentary', 'Nyla', 'Bialek', 'Adams', 'Laurie', 'Trombley', '1990s', 'cult', 'musician', 'who', 'released', 'one', 'album', 'superb', 'GRACE', 'toured', 'world', 'then', 'tragically', 'drowned', 'recording', 'follow-up', 'Promo', 'DVDs', 'AMAZING', 'GRACE', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'auctioned', 'off', 'passed', 'fans', 'write', 'Columbia', 'Records', 'set', 'release', 'documentary', 'June', '2009', 'part', 'theGrace', 'World', 'footage', 'Jeff', 'taken', 'Sony', 'sepia-hued', 'electronic', 'press', 'kit', 'available', 'theGRACE', 'Legacy', 'Edition', 'theLive', 'ChicagoDVD', 'most', 'never-before-seen', 'footage', 'Jeff', 'early', 'video', 'outside', 'Sin-e', 'Australian', 'radio', 'interviews', 'late', 'career', 'four', 'musicians', 'who', 'collaborated', 'Jeff', 'Buckley', 'GRACE', 'are', 'interviewed', 'are', 'friends', 'mother', 'Mary', 'Guibert', 'critics', 'DJ', 'record', 'industry', 'moguls', 'musicians', 'influenced', 'him.This', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'viewing', 'fans', 'However', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'documentary', 'authorized', 'biography', 'insistent', 'total', 'adulation', 'comments', 'Jeff', 'struggles', 'second', 'album', 'one', 'very', 'real', 'possibility', 'had', 'hit', 'creative', 'dead', 'end', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'Jeff', 'life', 'was', 'haunted', 'figure', 'absent', 'father', 'Tim', 'Buckley', 'Tim', 'Buckley', 'inspiration', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'Jeff', 'get', 'nary', 'mention', 'here', 'documentary', 'produced', 'BBC', 'few', 'years', 'prior', 'gave', 'much', 'more', 'balanced', 'picture', 'Buckley', 'life', 'have', 'print', 'biographies']",Amazing Grace: Jeff Buckley
