394647,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6303995306,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[2, 2]","I had heard about Bread & Chocolate for some years and was not even a glimmer in my mother's eye when it was originally released. It takes an honest, humorous and poignant look at the experience of Italian immigrants in Switzerland who came seeking work even in the face of discrimination and hardship. The main character (Nino Manfredi) is a waiter-in-training at a high class restaurant vying for the coveted job of waiter with his Turkish rival. Both Turks and Italians are horribly discriminated against in Switzerland. He must keep a stiff upper lip while he is missing his wife and children. Nino encounters Elena (Anna Karina), his beautiful and reclusive Greek neighbor with secrets of her own. He also must take life as it comes to him when he takes on work with an Italian compatriot he encounters at the restaurant and comes to find all is not what it seems about this man, even in the face of tremendous affluence and potential opportunity for Nino.The acting is superb, the comedy is fast and furious and the music is beautiful. In some ways, much of the state of Europe has remained the same even in the face of the European Euro. Discrimination and extremes in wealth and poverty are alive and well. This film beautifully examines these themes and more. I won't lie. It was not an easy film to watch. In some ways, it is gut wrenching. It seems the more the lead character tries to fit in and stay in Switzerland, in spite of nearly being deported a few times, the less he is able to assimilate in the culture he attempts to adopt. Intriguing look at the effect of immigration in the face of identity and human behavior.",5,A beautiful and heartbreaking film...,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,1635,"['had', 'heard', 'Bread', 'Chocolate', 'years', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'glimmer', 'mother', 'eye', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'honest', 'humorous', 'poignant', 'look', 'experience', 'Italian', 'immigrants', 'Switzerland', 'who', 'came', 'seeking', 'work', 'even', 'face', 'discrimination', 'hardship', 'main', 'character', 'Nino', 'Manfredi', 'waiter-in-training', 'high', 'class', 'restaurant', 'vying', 'coveted', 'job', 'waiter', 'Turkish', 'rival', 'Turks', 'Italians', 'are', 'horribly', 'discriminated', 'Switzerland', 'must', 'keep', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'missing', 'wife', 'children', 'Nino', 'encounters', 'Elena', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'beautiful', 'reclusive', 'Greek', 'neighbor', 'secrets', 'own', 'also', 'must', 'take', 'life', 'when', 'work', 'Italian', 'compatriot', 'restaurant', 'find', 'not', 'what', 'man', 'even', 'face', 'tremendous', 'affluence', 'potential', 'opportunity', 'Nino.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'comedy', 'fast', 'furious', 'music', 'beautiful', 'ways', 'much', 'state', 'Europe', 'remained', 'same', 'even', 'face', 'European', 'Euro', 'Discrimination', 'extremes', 'wealth', 'poverty', 'are', 'alive', 'well', 'film', 'beautifully', 'themes', 'more', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'ways', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'more', 'lead', 'character', 'tries', 'fit', 'stay', 'Switzerland', 'spite', 'nearly', 'being', 'deported', 'few', 'times', 'less', 'able', 'assimilate', 'culture', 'adopt', 'Intriguing', 'look', 'effect', 'immigration', 'face', 'identity', 'human', 'behavior']",Bread and Chocolate VHS

I have not seen this movie for more than 25 years but that scene stuck with me too. The concept of alien workers forced to leave their homeland to earn a living wage is unfortunately very much a reality today. It is my hope that  watching this movie would help soften the hearts of people who are worried that good jobs are being lost to foreign workers.,5,comedy with a heart,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,482,"['great', 'little', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'chicken', 'coup', 'scene', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'more', '25', 'years', 'scene', 'stuck', 'too', 'concept', 'alien', 'workers', 'forced', 'leave', 'homeland', 'earn', 'living', 'wage', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'much', 'reality', 'today', 'hope', 'watching', 'movie', 'would', 'help', 'soften', 'hearts', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'worried', 'good', 'jobs', 'are', 'being', 'lost', 'foreign', 'workers']",Bread and Chocolate VHS

Today, most of Europe is populated by immigrant workers from all parts of the continent and Africa.  And there is still the same kind of pecking order (those of you who've seen the film forgive that pun!): The Swiss look down on Italians, North Italians look down on Southern Italians, they in turn look down on Turks etc. The film bravely laughs at all our cultural flaws and salutes them.And Nino Manfredi... what a gem!  Part Charlie Chaplin and part Marcello Mastroianni, he's a wonderful blend of pathos and sweetness with just the right drop of vulgarity.BUT...!  Be forewarned, the DVD is the worst I've ever seen!  The print they transferred is FULL of scratches, pops, and splices that chop off whole sentences.  The light scenes are often washed out and the dark scenes are far too dark.  And there are a number of occasions where the subtitles were lost in the white background.  I can't imagine that they couldn't find a decent print of this film anywhere.
