625311,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B00005JN0T,Adam B. Krenn,"[1, 2]","I'm not a Will Smith fan (unless your talking about DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince) and I really wanted to hate this movie.  This stems from the fact that Mr. Smith is not an actor as he is a personality and (for the most part) most people could not name any character he has played. It's just Will Smith in a movie about such and such.  With that said, back to my point, I was ready to hate this movie.  I was surprised to find that Alex Proyas directed this (as well as the superb Dark City) and the story (while not any kind of ground breaking Sci-Fi) was strongly rooted in the Sci-Fi and Mystery genres.  It unfolded well and was interesting, heck, even Will was good as Detective Spooner (Yes he gets props for actually acting, even if it was still just a sombre paranoid version of himself).  Ok, it had it's holes, but not too many.  Oddly enough it was the ""stylized"" action sequences that failed the story to me and they just seemed to be out of place in this straight forward Sci-Fi piece.  Also the Mystery side of it never really panned out.  The movie does have it's charm, though and if this is any indication of the status of the blockbuster movies coming out of Hollywood right now, then at least that's a good thing.  Again, not great and not nearly as ""smart"" as it wants to be but far better than the usual Hollywood faire.",3,Sometimes things are surprising!,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,1347,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Will', 'Smith', 'fan', 'talking', 'DJ', 'Jazzy', 'Jeff', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'really', 'wanted', 'hate', 'movie', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'not', 'actor', 'personality', 'most', 'part', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'name', 'character', 'played', 'just', 'Will', 'Smith', 'movie', 'such', 'such', 'said', 'back', 'point', 'was', 'ready', 'hate', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'directed', 'as', 'well', 'superb', 'Dark', 'City', 'story', 'not', 'kind', 'ground', 'breaking', 'Sci-Fi', 'was', 'strongly', 'rooted', 'Sci-Fi', 'Mystery', 'genres', 'unfolded', 'well', 'was', 'interesting', 'heck', 'even', 'Will', 'was', 'good', 'Detective', 'Spooner', 'Yes', 'props', 'actually', 'acting', 'even', 'was', 'still', 'just', 'sombre', 'paranoid', 'version', 'Ok', 'had', 'holes', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'Oddly', 'was', 'stylized', 'action', 'sequences', 'failed', 'story', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'place', 'straight', 'forward', 'Sci-Fi', 'piece', 'Also', 'Mystery', 'side', 'never', 'really', 'panned', 'out', 'movie', 'have', 'charm', 'though', 'indication', 'status', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'right', 'now', 'then', 'least', 'good', 'thing', 'Again', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'nearly', 'smart', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'faire']","I, Robot"
625312,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JN0T,A. Estes,"[2, 2]","Will Smith is easily the most charismatic man in Hollywood today. Everyone loves him. If we were going to have one celebrity run for President, he would be the best choice. I mean, Will Smith is the guy. He has shined through in so many big-budget block-busters in the past, it almost seems like he can make anything work. It's just too bad that up until now, he has been trapped in sequel Hell (""Bad Movie Boys 2"" and ""Men In Bad Movies 2"" are ones that come to mind). ""I, Robot,"" however, is a nice return to fresh form for Smith. It embraces all of the cliches that we've seen in other sci-fi/action movies, but makes it all seem so new and exciting. Smith plays Detective Spooner, caught in the year 2035 where robots and humans live in perfect harmony. The robots serve as servants to the human beings. Seemingly loyal, no one can find a kink in these magnificent machines -- which by the way, are gloriously designed, nice to see something besides ""Terminator"" clones -- except for, of course, you guessed it, Spooner. He is overly paranoid of these robots, and when the inventor of them is splattered all over the lobby of USR (if you can't guess what it stands for, stop reading) headquarters, Spooner instantly suspects a shady, ""unique"" robot by the name of Sonny of committing murder. The catch here is that according to the three robot laws, a robot basically cannot harm a human being. And thus, the set-up. The movie moves at a breakneck speed and it's really tough to tell what's coming up next. The action scenes are stunning, as the pace never really lets up. This is one of the few movies in it's genre that keeps the audience guessing. Will Smith is great in his role, and definitely pulls out all the stops with the character. It's nice to see him in such a well-made movie again. Reminds me of the glory days of the first ""Men In Black"" and ""Independence Day,"" movies that defined popcorn entertainment. Again, a lot of the movie has been done to death in other films, but this does well enough with the material that all is forgiven. The only real flaw I can find is that some key plot-points are difficult to catch, and unless you're watching it at home, where you can rewind, you're likely to get left in the dust. But overall, it's a great movie, with a timeless theme that I think everyone watching can appreciate. It's not the biggest brain-teaser or the most original movie, but it definitely satisfies anyone hungry for some good solid entertainment.",4,"A Good, Old Fashioned Popcorn Flick",1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,2479,"['Will', 'Smith', 'easily', 'most', 'charismatic', 'man', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Everyone', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'one', 'celebrity', 'run', 'President', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'choice', 'mean', 'Will', 'Smith', 'guy', 'shined', 'so', 'many', 'big-budget', 'block-busters', 'past', 'almost', 'can', 'make', 'anything', 'work', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'now', 'been', 'trapped', 'sequel', 'Hell', 'Bad', 'Movie', 'Boys', '2', 'Men', 'Bad', 'Movies', '2', 'are', 'ones', 'come', 'mind', 'Robot', 'however', 'nice', 'return', 'fresh', 'form', 'Smith', 'cliches', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'sci-fi/action', 'movies', 'seem', 'so', 'new', 'exciting', 'Smith', 'Detective', 'Spooner', 'caught', 'year', '2035', 'where', 'robots', 'humans', 'live', 'perfect', 'harmony', 'robots', 'serve', 'servants', 'human', 'beings', 'Seemingly', 'loyal', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'kink', 'magnificent', 'machines', 'way', 'are', 'gloriously', 'designed', 'nice', 'see', 'something', 'Terminator', 'clones', 'course', 'guessed', 'Spooner', 'overly', 'paranoid', 'robots', 'when', 'inventor', 'splattered', 'lobby', 'USR', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guess', 'what', 'stop', 'reading', 'headquarters', 'Spooner', 'instantly', 'shady', 'unique', 'robot', 'name', 'Sonny', 'committing', 'murder', 'catch', 'here', 'according', 'three', 'robot', 'laws', 'robot', 'basically', 'can', 'not', 'harm', 'human', 'being', 'thus', 'set-up', 'movie', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'really', 'tough', 'tell', 'what', 'coming', 'up', 'next', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'stunning', 'pace', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'genre', 'audience', 'guessing', 'Will', 'Smith', 'great', 'role', 'definitely', 'out', 'stops', 'character', 'nice', 'see', 'well-made', 'movie', 'again', 'glory', 'days', 'first', 'Men', 'Black', 'Independence', 'Day', 'movies', 'defined', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'Again', 'lot', 'movie', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'other', 'films', 'well', 'enough', 'material', 'forgiven', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'can', 'find', 'key', 'plot-points', 'are', 'difficult', 'catch', ""'re"", 'watching', 'home', 'where', 'can', 'rewind', ""'re"", 'likely', 'get', 'left', 'dust', 'overall', 'great', 'movie', 'timeless', 'theme', 'think', 'everyone', 'watching', 'can', 'appreciate', 'not', 'biggest', 'brain-teaser', 'most', 'original', 'movie', 'definitely', 'anyone', 'hungry', 'good', 'solid', 'entertainment']","I, Robot"
625313,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JN0T,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 6]","This was an impressive film.  Not from the standpoint that it was a great story or with great actors, it was the quickness of the plot that impressed me.  I don't normally say this, but the fact that I. Robot moved exactly to the points that needed to be moved without any misleading, poor back story, or cheesy Will Smith moments impressed me.  Director Alex Proyas knew exactly how to manage the excessively huge budget and make sure that we, the audience, were getting the biggest bang for our buck.  Yes, there were downfalls to this film, but somehow I could overlook them.  I will be the first to admit that this was not my favorite type of film.  The huge CGI scenes, the grossly overpaid actors, and the disrespect to one of Asimov's infamous books by the same title will really churn your stomach (as it did mine), but unlike the rest of these types of film, I, Robot did something different.  It kept the eye candy going throughout the film and really never let your eyes rest.  This very imaginative world, almost a fantasy world, had something to keep your eyes busy the entire time, and I loved it.  Whether it would be Will Smith's semi-plastic looking Audi, or the Sony created ""Sonny"" robots infiltrating the city, your eyes will definitely walk away from this film with bulging bellies and a desire for more.Outside of the visually pleasing aspect of this film, you really don't have much to enjoy.  Will Smith's performance is mediocre at best.  He tries to do his best throughout the film, but after his introductory shower scene that was completely unnecessary it is only continually going downhill.  He tries to play the bad boy style that he patented in such film like Bad Boys to this project, what ultimately fails is his ability to handle the discrimination towards the robots.  I never really felt as if he actually disliked them, no matter what the sub-story claimed it just never felt real.  I think what ignited this feeling was Chi McBride's role.  Don't get me wrong, he is a decent actor, but he was trying to bring his role from Boston Public to this part.  He was trying too hard to be the hard-nosed Lieutenant that constantly fought with Spooner, but instead it just came across as Chi being Chi.  There wasn't anything exciting about him in the least bit.  Looking deeper into all the characters, this is what I felt was a major flaw with this film.  The actors really gave nothing spectacular to their roles.  They were minimally developed and several of them seemed like Swiss cheese.  It felt like wasted talent in this film.  Proyas knows better.  He knows how to get great performances from his people; I don't know what pulled him from his norm in this project.  Cromwell, Greenwood, and even Bridget Moynahan were just hitting that average line.  This was yet another glowing example of what happens when money is spent on CGI instead of highly trained actors.So, it looks like we have a superbly visual film coupled with horrible, below the line acting.  What did you expect?  This was your average action film with superior CGI.  I mentioned before on how the visual work is what really kept my eyes glued to the screen, but there was one other element that just rattled my mind.  In an attempt not to give the ending away, I will say this much.  It is not happy.  I do not think that upon viewing the ending of this film you have this sense of joy and comfort knowing that everything is going to be hunky-dory.  It is as if you are viewing the beginning chapter to a much bigger story, and that was interesting to me.  Proyas is notoriously known for his subtle dark endings that keep you on the brink of wonder (see Dark City), and I, Robot was no exception.  It was a brief moment of excitement to see this ending, after a brutal battle sequence where your mind could literally fall asleep because you already know the results, you have this mind-bending ending that really creeped me out.  Perhaps I read the ending wrong, but I wasn't at ease when the credits rolled.  I snickered because I thought of what could be coming, but definitely not a jump-up-and-down with glee sort of moment.  It was strange, but beautifully Proyas.Overall, this was a decent film.  I think I would reference this film similar to the way that I felt about the actors, it was just barely hitting the average line.  This was better than I expected (which isn't saying much since I was expecting it to be a dud) with really amazing visuals, but you cannot stand on those alone.  For this film to really have succeeded, you would have needed to counter balance the CGI with a better story (more details about the laws and more development with Cromwell's character) and much better acting.  I see why the producers went with Smith because he is bankable, but he just didn't bring the human element to the table like it was needed.  I couldn't see his hatred enough to really bring about his emotional change.  I needed more, but found less.  Decent, but nothing that will touch my DVD player again.Grade: *** out of *****",3,It's a human thing; you wouldn't understand.,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,5047,"['was', 'impressive', 'film', 'Not',

Alan Tudyk's portrayal as Sonny, the robot with its own personality that can choose not to obey the three laws was really good. He really is the soul of the film.I admire the fact that director Alex Proyas tried to blend a good science fiction story with a popcorn movie mentality, although it falls well short of being a classic because of that. Even the special effects, the fights, and the bots were all good. This is one of Smith's better movies (up there with Independence Day).

625315,A2ELP13J2HSGJQ,B00005JN0T,AJ Denny,"[3, 3]","Australia director Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow) has with his film ""I, Robot"" combined a large enough budget with a desire to tell a good story, to make an intelligent Hollywood blockbuster. Large sections of it are a CGI-driven theme ride of special effects, but unlike other big budget films like ""van Helsing"" or ""Bad Boys II"", they don't overwhelm the story, which binds them together. They complement each other.This story is set in 2035 Chicago. It is a familiar backdrop, because the production and design of the film acknowledges the future will also have a history. Except that although some of the stylish grey computers may look like Note Books or even iPod's, but are instead robots which will do everything from walking your dog, to chasing after you if you leave home without your asthma medicine.Detective Dale Spooner (Will Smith) is a man damaged in ways which aren't at first apparent to us. Returning to duty after injury, he now harbours a paranoid mistrust of robots only drawn out as the film progresses. In this Smith gets to show us he can act as well as make us laugh. This mistrust is the reason given by the holographic suicide note of robot designer Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) calls him to the crime.Alone in his laboratory before his death except for his robots, it doesn't take Spooner long to discover the hiding NS-5 robot Sonny (a CGI-generated character voiced by Alan Tudyk) who he is certain killed Lanning. Not believed by anyone, especially robot psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan brilliantly portraying a person relearning her emotions on the run) so begins a murder investigation that leads to the brink of robo-revolution.Somehow in an action thriller, Proyas has managed to retain the spirit and themes of the 1950 Isaac Asimov book on which the film is based. Asimov wasn't really interested in the mechanics of robots (he was a chemistry graduate), but instead their effect on us, as they became part of society. Sonny is the first robot able to think for itself.

625317,A3TLY1A7NGVCQM,B00005JN0T,"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP""","[4, 5]","Rip roaring fun and an interesting premise.Will Smith plays LA detective Del Spooner in 2035 faced with a what appears to be at first a suicide at USR - the main robotics manufacturer on the eve of the introduction of a new revolutionary robot model the NS-5. During the investigation Smith starts to believe the a robot, one of the new ones murdered the dead scientist and mad eit only appear to be a suicide.  Spooner has ""issues"" with robots in general, and wants to charge the robot with murder.I'll leave the rest of the plot for those of you who have not seen the movie yet, but I have to say that this film doesn't let up for a minute. Will Smith solidifies his bone-fides as a credible action star (and has been obviously spending a lot of time in the gym lately) and really makes the movie.Smith was an excellent casting choice as was Bruce Greenwood - always one of my favorite bad-guys when he does bad guys, few do it better. I won't elaborate for this movie whether or not he was bad guy - they'll be no spoilers in this review.I really liked the way they gave the robot intelligence and emotions. I haven't watched the bonus tracks yet to see exactly how it was done but they somehow merged the CGI with the acting of Alan Tudyk ( Firefly ) for great blend of HAL seriousnes and Mr Data's (STNG) quest to understand himself. (for ther record  I am not a STNG fan, but I recognize that it was good in certain areas, nonsense in others. Mr Data was one of the better points of the series)I wish there had been more of this exploration of philosphy. For example my favorite lines from the filme were during a conversation between Spooner and Sonny:Spooner: You are a clever imitation of life... Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and turn it into a masterpiece?Sonny: Can you?This line summed up the conflict between Spooners idea of what a robot should be ( a toaster , It's just lights and clockwork."") against his inner conflicts and prejudices. How do you charge a microwave oven with murder?Direction was tight and focused on the story and the characters. I was pleased to see Bridget Moynahan although the part underutilized her talents. Special effects were as expected, and I guess that says a lot about the state of visual effects today. They were as real as real gets and I guess thats we expect these days. Imagine though this movie being shown even 10 years ago, but say in 1975. What would the movie-goer think? I submit that the movie goer would believe that we will have intelligent robots acting in movies in 2004.I loved the cars too. Audi did an excellent job of conceptualizing cars 30 years from now. Not that I expect they will actually look like that in 2035 but I believe they could look like that - which is what a movie requires.Overall I highly recommend this movie. It's science fiction no denyng that, but what real sci-fi should be. Thoughtful, believable stories about characters you can care about set in a futuristic backdrop with amazing gadgets yet still playing mainly on the human element - even the robot's human element.These are the sci-fi concepts invented by Jules Verne and perfected by geniuses like Isaac Asimov and A.C. Clarke. I am sure Asimov would have been proud at what they did with his concept and story. I've been reading Asimov for 40 years and felt right at home with this story. Too bad he is not alove to enjoy this wonderful variation of his original story.This is a not miss.

The closing credits say it was ""suggested by"" Asimov's story. But those of us who remember the story will remember that it was a short story, one of several in a book by the same name, but not anything long enough to be a feature-length movie out of it. Still, the necessary elements are there, and what's been made of them would make old Isaac proud.Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago cop of the not-too-distant future, when robots are becoming very common in society, and everyone knows the three laws of robotics:1. A robot cannot harm a human, or through inaction allow a human to come to harm.2. A robot must obey the orders of a human unless they conflict with Rule One.3. A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with Rule One or Two.Asimov has promulgated these three laws for long enough that most science fiction fans are familiar with them. We are also familiar with stories written about attempts to circumvent this hard-wired programming. So when a famous robotic designer is found fallen out of his office window onto the marble atrium below, everyone assumes it was suicide, because no one was in the office with him at the time. But Spooner is suspicious of robots (we find out why eventually), and figures the scientist was murdered, possibly by a robot. Sure enough, an apparently out of control robot is discovered in his office, and Spooner figures it for the killer. But of course everyone, including Dr. Susan Calvin, robot psychologist, tells him that's just not possible.Now, this really is a mystery, and the clues lead everywhere and nowhere, so I don't want to ruin it for you. Let's just say that almost no one in this film is what they seem to be at first, except perhaps Spooner's granny. And don't be too sure about her, either.It's a real hardware movie, with lots of fast action and things going smash, which should satisfy the younger crowd. But it's also a make-you-think sort of plot at several levels, and that's the kind I especially enjoy. Not to mention seeing Smith bare-chested.

If you are someone who loves action films you will NOT be disappointed with I, Robot.  Will Smith as the main character is pretty good in the action man ""save the world"" type roles, and fortunately he continues to impress me here.Some very good special effects further convince me that this is truly a wonderful film.  Wonderful to look at *and* provides a solid storyline.  Just the thought of robots taking over the world only for one robot to be a ""bad bot"" is a great set-up for an interesting story, and it works.You don't have to worry about having to put up with any kind of robotic talk or whatever, because the story makes sense.  The robots in the film  try to act and talk human-like, which  makes it easier for us, the viewers, to understand what's going on.The storyline mainly focuses on the humans interacting with each other and trying to figure out where the bad robots are located instead of, what I initially feared, a really weird and hard-to-follow sci-fi story that only makes sense to a select few viewers.  That's NOT the case.  ANYONE can get into I, Robot.  Even if you have ZERO interest in robots, you will understand what's happening and won't ever feel confused.  When the humans interact with the robots, it will all make sense.In other words, the storyline in this film is laid out easily and understandably for all the people who normally don't have much interest in robots.

625347,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JN0T,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 2]","There are several very good reviews already written on this movie, `I, Robot', most of which accurately point out the fact that, as the movie admits itself in the credits, is only loosely based on the collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov. I'm prompted to write a review of the DVD, because while all these reviews talk about the movie, none of them talk about the DVD.The most important thing about this package is that while it does not include a lot of special features a la `Matrix' and `Lord of the Rings' blockbusters, it does include my favorite feature, which is an alternate soundtrack containing commentary by the writer and the director. This single feature automatically doubles the value of the package as it gives an excellent reason to watch the movie a second time. I really prefer the alternate soundtrack approach to the captions commonly done with older movies, as there is typically much more information given and you can get much more from the intonation of the speakers than you can from the sterile text.That said, I believe the commentary soundtrack on this DVD is not as good as some of the best I have heard. My favorite is those by Kevin Smith, who has been known to supply two different commentary tracks and almost always has a symposium of three or four voices joining his own. A fairer comparison may be to the commentary track on Quentin Tarantino's special edition of `Pulp Fiction'. As both Smith and Tarantino are well known for including obscure `quotes' and references in their flicks, their commentary tracks are especially useful in revealing all the connections.As this movie is loosely based on a justly famous collection of short stories and liberally quotes from other Sci Fi classics such as `2001' and the 1930's Czech play `Rossum's Universal Robots (R.U.R)', this commentary track should be a goldmine, but it is not. While the speakers mention or allude to these references, they give very few concrete connections. I'm convinced that the actor who did the voice of `Sonny', the primary robot character took his queue from the voice of HAL in `2001', but the commentators give me no satisfaction. As the play R.U.R. is a much bigger source for the plot, I was a bit disappointed that this connection was not explored more fully.As there is a direct connection between Will Smith and Kevin Smith, as Will Smith had a cameo in Kevin's last movie, `Jersey Girl', I must point out that both Kevin Smith and the principles of `I, Robot' both have immense respect for Will Smith's talent as a professional movie actor in both courtesy to others and in his artistic contribution to the script and the quality of his improvisations on screen.On the other hand, I found the Susan Calvin character (played by Bridget Monaghan) to be almost entirely uninteresting. She would have been much stronger if she had been played as originally written by Asimov or closer to the Sean Young character in `Blade Runner', the movie I sense the authors were trying their darndest to match. They didn't even come close, primarily, I suspect due less to Will Smith's weakness than to the failure to match Ridley Scott's powerful world based on the great inventions of the original material's writer, Philip K. Dick. `I, Robot' had no hope of matching `Blade Runner', as the latter was much less an action / FX opus than a classic Sci Fi `what if' premise grafted seamless to a film noir atmosphere and imaginative Pacific Rim fusion Los Angles. The driving force of `Blade Runner' is the fact that the androids are designed to die after four years. Asimov's great invention of the three laws of robotics are useful as wallpaper, but do not, ultimately explain the action in the film. They are a red herring used by characters to doubt what is really going on. Oddly, while I found the acting behind the primary robot, `Sonny' to be very good, the writing for this character was very inconsistent. And, inconsistency is highly implausible in a computer-based life form. I was expecting something much closer to the character R. Daneel Olivaw from Asimov's two early robot detective novels, `The Naked Sun' and `The Caves of Steel', where the phobias of the principle human are much more consistent with the world posited by Asimov for the stories.This is certainly a worthwhile Sci Fi movie, although not in the class of `Blade Runner', `Minority Report', or even that great old classic `Forbidden Planet'.

625349,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B00005JN0T,Bob L,"[1, 1]","I've never read the Asimov novel but I have been a big fan of the Outer Limits' episode and before that, the Creepy magazine rendition(I'm dating myself). The question isn't which of these three versions is truer to the original novel. The question is what do these versions have to offer in the way of enlightenment and personal involvement. The Creepy version and the Outer Limits' episode are excellent.Upon seeing the trailers for I, Robot during its theatrical release I was worried that it had been turned into another mindless Hollywood action timewaster. My fears kept me from seeing it at the theater. Now, having seen it on DVD, I wish I had seen it at the theater. I don't know how good was the box-office but their advertising scared me out of the price of a ticket and if I had paid that price I, and this is a rarity nowadays, would have not felt cheated.I enjoy Will Smith but it seems he is continuingly playing the same character i.e. Wild,Wild West-Bad Boys-Men in Black etc... Because of this and the trailers I had very low expectations for I, Robot and happily found I was mistaken(about the movie, not  Smith). Will was fine but also Will was Will and didn't raise the level of his character to the level of the story.The story is a mixture of 2001:A Space Oddessey, A.I, Tron, The Fifth Element, Colossus:the Forbin Project and yes, Who Killed Roger Rabbit. For the most part the story plays out like cop drama or murder mystery much in the way did Minority Report or Alex Proyas' previous effort, Dark City. It's SciFi elements were not its strong suit. Its best feature is the way the story unfolds and its ability to keep you involved in the intrigue. As in the Outer Limits and Creepy, the movie gets you to feel for Sonny and that's essential to the success of the story.

625357,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JN0T,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[4, 5]","Set in 2035 in the city of Chicago, this futuristic movie stars Will Smith as a policeman/private detective who is assigned the task of figuring out who murdered a man at the local robotic factory. Robots are the central characters in this film, and they are shown walking among the people, helping with tasks, and working to fight crime.Will Smith's character John Spooner doesn't trust these robots at all and he is suspicious that one of them is responsible for killing the man at the factory. He sets out to prove his point, with gun in hand, attempting to first intimidate the robots into confessing the truth and then firing away when he is convinced he has figured out which hunk of metal is responsible for this crime.This movie might seem a little far- fetched, but the central message is something to ponder. With technology advancing further and further every day, there could come a time when artificial intelligence is capable of having a mind of its own, so to speak. It could reach a point where these robots start to act in ways they are not programmed to act. And if this happens, it is difficult to say what problems will occur next. Besides committing murder, these independent beings could wreck havoc on the nation and the world.The best part of this movie is the special effects. The director does a very good job making these metallic figures walk, talk, and act like people. Even though you know you are watching a robot on the screen, it seems very real. You feel like an actual person with its own, thinking, rational mind is behind that metal mask.Some humor is tossed in from time to time to keep this movie from getting too serious, but this science- fiction drama deals with a serious issue that is worth thinking about. I don't know if the year 2035 will bring with it the types of advances portrayed in this movie. But the fact is that artificial intelligence could very well become a problem if advancements go too far. And this movie effectively shows what could happen if this prediction comes to pass.",3,Could a Robot Commit a Serious Crime?,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,2037,"['Set', '2035', 'city', 'Chicago', 'futuristic', 'movie', 'stars', 'Will', 'Smith', 'policeman/private', 'detective', 'who', 'assigned', 'task', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'murdered', 'man', 'local', 'robotic', 'factory', 'Robots', 'are', 'central', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'shown', 'walking', 'people', 'helping', 'tasks', 'working', 'fight', 'crime.Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'John', 'Spooner', ""n't"", 'trust', 'robots', 'suspicious', 'one', 'responsible', 'killing', 'man', 'factory', 'out', 'prove', 'point', 'gun', 'hand', 'attempting', 'first', 'intimidate', 'robots', 'confessing', 'truth', 'then', 'firing', 'away', 'when', 'convinced', 'figured', 'out', 'hunk', 'metal', 'responsible', 'crime.This', 'movie', 'might', 'seem', 'little', 'far-', 'fetched', 'central', 'message', 'something', 'ponder', 'technology', 'advancing', 'further', 'further', 'day', 'could', 'come', 'time', 'when', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'capable', 'having', 'mind', 'own', 'so', 'speak', 'could', 'reach', 'point', 'where', 'robots', 'start', 'act', 'ways', 'are', 'not', 'programmed', 'act', 'difficult', 'say', 'what', 'problems', 'will', 'occur', 'next', 'committing', 'murder', 'independent', 'beings', 'could', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'nation', 'world.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'director', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'metallic', 'figures', 'walk', 'talk', 'act', 'people', 'Even', 'know', 'are', 'watching', 'robot', 'screen', 'very', 'real', 'feel', 'actual', 'person', 'own', 'thinking', 'rational', 'mind', 'metal', 'mask.Some', 'humor', 'tossed', 'time', 'time', 'keep', 'movie', 'getting', 'too', 'serious', 'science-', 'fiction', 'drama', 'deals', 'serious', 'issue', 'worth', 'thinking', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'year', '2035', 'will', 'bring', 'types', 'advances', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'fact', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'become', 'problem', 'advancements', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'movie', 'effectively', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'prediction', 'pass']","I, Robot"

625359,A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B00005JN0T,Caraculiambro,"[6, 8]","First of all, if you're an Asimov fan, you're probably aware that the script of ""I, Robot"" is only tangentially based on Asimov's robot novels and stories.  The screenwriters, though, make no attempt to disguise that, claiming the script was ""Suggested by Isaac Asimov.""  If you are not an Asimov fan, I should warn you that, for example, his ""starter"" robot book, ""The Caves of Steel,"" is so totally different from this movie, it's like they're not even from the same universe.My work schedule is such that I can only see movies during the summer, but each summer I see dozens and dozens.  Last summer, for example, I saw practically everything playing at the theaters within the space of a few days.  ""I, Robot"" was the film I liked the most.  I vowed I would get the DVD as soon as it became available.What I liked most about this movie was the script.  It was by turns funny, suspenseful, thought-provoking, etc.  In fact, it's a really good script to study if you're into writing your own:  it can boast textbook models of how a writer should handle reversals, foreshadowing, payoff, character arc, etc.  And the conclusion and the prelude both made sense, total sense!  In short, not a line out of place.Other things that could sink the movie are held in check: Will Smith, while perhaps not the ideal candidate for the job, delivers a believable and versatile performance.The special effects shots help the movie along, rather than drag it in their wake.  What noticeable shots there are really do more to creep you out than overawe you (e.g., the horde of evil robots scaling the USR building).I was very surprised to read many reviews of this movie (after I saw it), which panned it.  It is very difficult for me to see how somebody could see this as a stinker, and I'm the kind of guy who usually only likes about 1 out of every 20 movies I see.Naturally, there's zero depth to the film, of course; as long as you know this beforehand, you'll be unlikely to regret investing a couple of hours in this movie.",5,great entertainment,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,2017,"['First', 'all', ""'re"", 'Asimov', 'fan', ""'re"", 'probably', 'aware', 'script', 'Robot', 'only', 'tangentially', 'based', 'Asimov', 'robot', 'novels', 'stories', 'screenwriters', 'make', 'attempt', 'disguise', 'claiming', 'script', 'was', 'Suggested', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'are', 'not', 'Asimov', 'fan', 'should', 'warn', 'example', 'starter', 'robot', 'book', 'Caves', 'Steel', 'so', 'totally', 'different', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'same', 'universe.My', 'work', 'schedule', 'such', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'movies', 'summer', 'summer', 'see', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'Last', 'summer', 'example', 'saw', 'practically', 'everything', 'playing', 'theaters', 'space', 'few', 'days', 'Robot', 'was', 'film', 'liked', 'most', 'vowed', 'would', 'get', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'became', 'available.What', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'script', 'was', 'turns', 'funny', 'suspenseful', 'thought-provoking', 'etc', 'fact', 'really', 'good', 'script', 'study', ""'re"", 'writing', 'own', 'can', 'boast', 'textbook', 'models', 'how', 'writer', 'should', 'handle', 'reversals', 'foreshadowing', 'payoff', 'character', 'arc', 'etc', 'conclusion', 'prelude', 'made', 'sense', 'total', 'sense', 'short', 'not', 'line', 'place.Other', 'things', 'could', 'sink', 'movie', 'are', 'held', 'check', 'Will', 'Smith', 'perhaps', 'not', 'ideal', 'candidate', 'job', 'believable', 'versatile', 'performance.The', 'special', 'effects', 'shots', 'help', 'movie', 'rather', 'drag', 'wake', 'What', 'noticeable', 'shots', 'are', 'really', 'do', 'more', 'creep', 'out', 'overawe', 'e.g.', 'horde', 'evil', 'robots', 'scaling', 'USR', 'building', '.I', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'movie', 'saw', 'panned', 'very', 'difficult', 'see', 'how', 'somebody', 'could', 'see', 'stinker', ""'m"", 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'usually', 'only', '1', '20', 'movies', 'see.Naturally', 'zero', 'depth', 'film', 'course', 'as', 'long', 'know', 'beforehand', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unlikely', 'regret', 'investing', 'couple', 'hours', 'movie']","I, Robot"

The movie begin by telling us the three laws that all robots must obey. I. Robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. II. Robot must obey orders given by a human being except where such orders conflict with the 1st law. III. A robot must protect its own existence as long as it does not conflict with the 1st and 2nd law. The setting is in Chicago in the year 2035 where robots are doing many jobs that us humans do today such as being garbage men, cooking, and helping old folks around the area. The creation of robots has the whole town delighted expect for one cop. His name is detective Spooner (Will Smith). Spooner doesn't trust any robots as he believes that they are the exact oppostie of what they are supposed to be. His believes become more evident as Dr. Lanning fell about 4 or 5 stories to his death who happens to be the one in charge of the making of the robots. Everyone preceives Mr. Lannings death as a suicide but Spooner begs to differ. He feels that the robots are responsible for his death. His believes pinpoint him to a robot called Sonny who is unlike the other robots. He can write, think, have emotions and even have dreams. Spooner feels that Sonny is the man responsible for Mr. Lannings death but noone wants to believe him especially since robots are machinery designed to protect humans. Eventually Dr. Susan Calvin (Lanning's assistant) begins to see a different side of Sonny she is not using to seeing and is finally convinced that the robots may not be what she perceived them to be. Detective Spooner's beliefs start to come to life when one robot tried to destroy Mr. Lannings house when he was in there trying to dig up clues and when he was driving and ran into a truck full of robots popping out and attacking him. Of course, Spooner has no evidence of what the robots did and begins to go into an outrage that leads him to being suspended from the police force. However, Spooner refuses to give up. He continues to confront Sonny to find out what's going on. Sonny reveals that he was part of Dr. Lanning's special creation and was not obligated to follow the three laws. Lanning made him to fulfill a purpose by what that purpose was, Sonny didn't really know. We discover many other interesting clues. The main reason why Sponner dislikes robots was because he had a an auto accident that caused a big truck to knock him and another car with a 12 year old girl off the bridge and into a river. A robot came and saved him because he had a greater chance of living although he begged the robot to save the girl instead.  We discover that the  mastermind in causing the robots to act the way that they are is not a person or a robot but Vicki (the computer system) that was supposed to program the robots to follow these laws but instead doesn't obey Dr. Lanning and now we have an army full of robots wrecking havoc all over the city. Now Sonny, Spooner, and Calvin must protect the city, destroy the robots, and destroy the Vicki. In the end, we discover that Dr. Lanning did instruct Sonny to kill him and use him to help Detective Spooner to destroy Vicki and her evil intentions. Sonny go out and lives the human life but it looks like he will be leading it in a positive manner. This movie may not be as fun to watch as the Matrix, Men In Black, or the Fifth Element, but the idea behind a robot murdering a human portrays in interesting story. I loved the parts where Spooner told one of the doctors that he was allergic to b.s. and the lead detective said he will miss the good ol' days when people killed people.

LeBlanc ""I love music!""","[11, 17]","I've loved I, Robot since it's release; and am thrilled that they put the money & effort into converting it into 3D. _ The ""3D Conversion"" process has gotten 1000% better since it's inception; and now, it's rivaling ""Real 3D"" (shot in 3D) films... In fact, it's gotten so good, that if I didn't know better, I'd swear they shot this film in 3D to begin with... it's that good! __ I have a 2012 Panasonic VT50 (65"" - nearly $4,000), so if you get a ""cheap-o"" 3D-TV, your experience may not be as good as it could be; but I didn't notice a single mistake/problem w/ the conversion; and believe me, I was looking for them.-- In fact, most people confuse most 3D-Converted Film problems (ghosting, etc.) with it being a problem with the 3D-TV itself -- when in fact, it was a Conversion mistake/problem, in identifying field-depth and so on, during the conversion process.ANYWAY... The first one I saw that rivaled 'Real 3D' and had no errors at all, was Titanic (also a 20th Century Fox release)... So in addition to the conversion technology being vastly improved, this also means that they (Fox) are at least taking the effort (and money) to see that it's done correctly and error-free... even if it means it's a lengthier & more expensive process.My single complaint about this release, is the ""Bonus Feature"" dismissal.  The original Blu-Ray release was loaded with (good) bonus features; and while I've come to expect most 3-D Discs having none at all (something Sony has no trouble with, by the way)... I expected it to come with either a separate Blu-Ray disc (normally, identical to the initial release), or at least have the 'best of the best' features included on the DVD. __ Well, there is no separate Blu-Ray disc included, despite it being billed as ""Blu-Ray 3D / Blu-Ray / DVD Combo""... and so, I'm forced to keep my original blu-ray disc & swap it out with the DVD disc included in this ""combo"", so I can keep the awesome bonus features (3 Commentaries, Several CG & Behind the Scenes things, and more)... So, instead of selling my extra (Original) Blu-Ray, I now have only the extra DVD to sell (which is another thing... who on Earth, needs, or wants a DVD of this, if they're buying a Blu-Ray 3D version!??)At any rate - Very impressed with the 3D Conversion...

625378,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JN0T,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","I, Robot in many ways is one of those kind of films that you're putting on going ""oh man, wonder how much this is going to suck"". Then again, you're dealing with Alex Proyas, director of such cult hits as the Crow and Dark City so even if it was bad, you'd at least now you were bound to watch something visually striking and at least cool. While it does have some trouble spots, I, Robot manages to at least be fun and engaging and worth an investment.It's the future and robotic technology has become increasingly sophisticated. A new model is being released but cop Del Spooner is absolutely convinced that robots will one day turn on us which is ridiculous to everyone since robots obey 3 laws: they can't hurt or allow a human to be harmed, to obey orders unless it conflicts with rule 1 and a robot protects itself if it doesn't conflict with rules 1 and 2. After the main developer of the robots dies under a suspected suicide, Spooner thinks otherwise and with the help of a gorgeous scientist, he tries to figure out what's going on with the robots.After the gothic-flavored the Crow and the film noir look of Dark City, director Proyas now goes for the sleek futuristic style and it works quite well. While it does seem like a nerd thinking up futuristic stuff instead of going for realism, like Spielberg's extensive research in a possible future for Minority Report, it does have a great look and certain technologies look great such as the cars. The effects are pretty stellar, in particular the robots where dozens and in one shots what looks like near a thousand or so appear on screen. The one problem is that there's a couple action scenes that were obviously added so it wouldn't just be this thinking sci-fi movie. Granted the scenes are great, including an attack on a car in motion and a demolition happening while one's inside the house are great but they also feel added to appease the blockbuster going crowd.I think Will Smith is one of those kind of actors where Will just can't help being Will. Not going after his acting, far from it (in fact, there's some great scenes he has here) but you can't get past moments that make you think of the wisecracking Fresh Prince. Underutilized James Cromwell is always excellent and while not really given much range, Bridget Moynahan is just so cuuute. The real star personally is actually just a voice but Alan Tudyk(Wash from Firefly/Serenity) supplies the voice of Sunny, a robot who's been given an actual personality and he pulls it off admirably. The only thing is certain characters just seem kind of useless. Shia LeBeouf's role for example just seems kind of pointless since it just doesn't go anywhere, same with Spooner's grandmother role.Is it Proyas's best? No, for me that's the Crow and this is actually the only film that I probably wouldn't get despite done by an emerging talent. It's not a terrible movie by any means but after downsizing movies I've owned over the years, I can look at this one and go ""yeah I enjoyed it but I doubt I'd watch it again"".",4,Better than the average sci-fi movie,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,3040,"['Robot', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'kind', 'films', ""'re"", 'putting', 'going', 'oh', 'man', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'going', 'suck', 'Then', 'again', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'director', 'such', 'cult', 'hits', 'Crow', 'Dark', 'City', 'so', 'even', 'was', 'bad', ""'d"", 'least', 'now', 'were', 'bound', 'watch', 'something', 'visually', 'striking', 'least', 'cool', 'have', 'trouble', 'spots', 'Robot', 'least', 'be', 'fun', 'engaging', 'worth', 'investment.It', 'future', 'robotic', 'technology', 'become', 'increasingly', 'sophisticated', 'new', 'model', 'being', 'released', 'cop', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'absolutely', 'convinced', 'robots', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'turn', 'ridiculous', 'everyone', 'robots', 'obey', '3', 'laws', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'allow', 'human', 'be', 'harmed', 'obey', 'orders', 'rule', '1', 'robot', ""n't"", 'conflict', 'rules', '1', '2', 'main', 'developer', 'robots', 'suspected', 'suicide', 'Spooner', 'otherwise', 'help', 'gorgeous', 'scientist', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'robots.After', 'gothic-flavored', 'Crow', 'film', 'noir', 'look', 'Dark', 'City', 'director', 'Proyas', 'now', 'sleek', 'futuristic', 'style', 'quite', 'well', 'seem', 'nerd', 'thinking', 'up', 'futuristic', 'stuff', 'instead', 'going', 'realism', 'Spielberg', 'extensive', 'research', 'possible', 'future', 'Minority', 'Report', 'have', 'great', 'look', 'certain', 'technologies', 'look', 'great', 'such', 'cars', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'stellar', 'particular', 'robots', 'where', 'dozens', 'one', 'shots', 'what', 'thousand', 'so', 'appear', 'screen', 'one', 'problem', 'couple', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'obviously', 'added', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'thinking', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'Granted', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'including', 'attack', 'car', 'motion', 'demolition', 'happening', 'one', 'house', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'feel', 'added', 'appease', 'blockbuster', 'going', 'crowd.I', 'think', 'Will', 'Smith', 'one', 'kind', 'actors', 'where', 'Will', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'Will', 'Not', 'going', 'acting', 'far', 'fact', 'great', 'scenes', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'moments', 'make', 'think', 'wisecracking', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Underutilized', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'always', 'excellent', 'not', 'really', 'given', 'much', 'range', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'just', 'so', 'cuuute', 'real', 'star', 'personally', 'actually', 'just', 'voice', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Wash', 'Firefly/Serenity', 'voice', 'Sunny', 'robot', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'actual', 'personality', 'off', 'admirably', 'only', 'thing', 'certain', 'characters', 'just', 'seem', 'kind', 'useless', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'role', 'example', 'just', 'kind', 'pointless', 'just', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'same', 'Spooner', 'grandmother', 'role.Is', 'Proyas', 'best', 'No', 'Crow', 'actually', 'only', 'film', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'done', 'emerging', 'talent', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'means', 'downsizing', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'years', 'can', 'look', 'one', 'go', 'yeah', 'enjoyed', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again']","I, Robot"
625379,A23CELC1PWB219,B00005JN0T,Continuity Fan XT-Alpha,"[1, 1]","I, Robot is a sci-fi action movie that's supposedly loosely based on the short stories of Isaac Asimov. I wouldn't know how loosely since I've never read any of them but I didn't see anything wrong with the movie itself. It revolves heavily around Asimov's concept of the Three Laws of Robotics having unexpected consequences but also has plenty of action scenes of Will Smith fighting swarms of hostile robots so I'd think it's a good compromise between the stories of two generations ago and the needs of modern cinema.It's the year 2035 and the city of Chicago is crawling with humanoid robots that do everything for everyone and are perfect at everything they do. I wonder how the American economy can still work. The robots are not sentient like in most other movies but are simply intelligent machines bound by programming to ensure that they are perfectly obedient and can never hurt people.Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, the only person in the world who hates robots. He's investigating the death of Dr. Lanning, the ""father of robotics"". It seems to be a suicide but Spooner suspects a killer robot. Everybody thinks he's crazy but you can hardly blame him when robots seem to be malfunctioning all around him in spectacular and violent ways. Will Smith brings his own unique style of humor to the role but he does play it more seriously than most of his other movies. Bridget Moynahan plays Dr. Susan Calvin, a very serious psychologist who is annoyed by Spooner's irrational hatred towards robots. Surprise, surprise, there's also the stereotypical robot who can think for itself and even has emotions to complete the character trinity and give the audience someone to sympathise with.I really liked the design of the NS-5 robots in this movie. Instead of being tin-men like C-3PO or androids like Data, they are something in between. Their slender bodies and translucent skin is very original and contrasts with their amazing strength and fighting skill.

After that, I pretty much put out of my mind a production with a sense of faithfulness to the source material, and consigned myself that the movie would be more akin to the common Hollywood practice of optioning a classic literary work and `jazzing' it up to make it more palatable for the masses, using what the screenwriters saw fit, discarding much of what they thought wouldn't work, and making up the rest to fill in the gaps (I'll admit I was partially right, and partially wrong).  Directed by Alex Proyas (The Crow), this 2004 film stars, as I've already mentioned, Will `gettin jiggy wit it' Smith (Independence Day, Enemy of the State, Ali).  Also appearing is the very hot Bridget Moynahan (Coyote Ugly, Serendipity), Bruce Greenwood (Thirteen Days, The Core), Chi McBride (Gone in 60 Seconds), and James Cromwell (Space Cowboys), who, incidentally, is the tallest actor (6 foot 7 inches) to be nominated for an Oscar (for that talking pig movie), according to The Internet Movie Database.The year is 2035 and the setting is Chicago.  Robots are commonplace, performing all the tasks future humans apparently deem too menial such as package delivery, garbage pick up, walking dogs, etc.  Life is easy for those who have a robot to do their bidding, but everyone isn't too keen on the idea of robots being so prevalent, especially homicide detective Del Spooner (Smith), a sort of robot racist, but no one takes his paranoia too seriously because everyone knows the robots are programmed with three specific fail safes as follows;1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except when such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Soon Spooner is called in to investigate the recent death (due to massive impact trauma aka falling out high rise office window) of Dr. Alfred Lanning (Cromwell), a pioneer in the robotics field and employee of US Robotics, or USR, which, by the way, is on the eve of releasing its most advanced mechanical wonder, the NS-5 series.  On the surface the doctor's death looks like a suicide (everyone seems to be pushing this angle, especially USR CEO Lawrence Robertson, played by Greenwood), but Spooner is skeptical.  In the course of Spooner's investigation, he finds aide in the form of Dr. Susan Calvin (Moynahan), an USR employee and sort of psychologist whose job it is to help with the integration of robots into everyday life.  Together they begin to uncover what appears to be a massive conspiracy, assisted by an unlikely source sent from beyond the grave (no, I'm not talking about a ghost...just watch the film and all will become clear)...but it may be too late, as robots seem to be suffering from what could best be described as a `ghost in the machine' sickness, especially around Spooner who keeps finding himself the target of murderous, mechanical mayhem.I really enjoyed this film, but if you're looking for a faithful on screen representation of the original source material, you'll probably want to take a pass on this one.  I did get a sense the screenwriter made a real effort to stay true to the nature of the material, for whatever its worth.  One of the things that really impressed me was the integration of the very slick, spectacular and heavily used special effects with the live performances.  It felt seamless helping to maintain a sense of realism that kept me drawn to the story, rather than feeling of awkwardness that can occur when something appears phony, drawing attention to the fact that it was an element added in later by computers.  As far as Smith goes, I thought he did well enough, but I can't help feel I've seen this character in any number of his past film appearances, in terms of the glib, smart alecky, `I don't play by the rules' type facing difficult odds but managing to find a way to come out on top.  I really liked Bridget Moynahan, but not because she's a great actress (she also did well enough here), but mainly because I'm a sucker for brunettes.  I wouldn't say there were any outstanding performances, but everyone knew what they were doing, and were all very professional.  As far as the story goes, I thought it was fairly straight forward (helped by a rousing and suitable musical score), and included a few surprises that were alluded to prior to their revelation, but never painfully telegraphed, giving the feeling of a well thought out and well written film, playing out as a well crafted action film should, delivering much and keeping the downtime to a minimum.  I did find it kind of strange that Smith's character should suffer the number of attacks he did without any witnesses, thereby putting into question is mental stability, as no one believes him when he tries to relate what happened.  Another thing I appreciated was how the near future was presented, as not being too futuristic (and silly...see the film Demolition Man for an example of this), but having enough technological advances present to feel like we're actually looking 30 years into the future, like that Audi Spooner was driving...pretty cool (although that whole Lake Michigan as a landfill thing seemed dumb to me, but whatever).  One niggling point I thought stuck out and that was the reiteration of certain plot elements numerous times throughout the film, as if we needed to be reminded of things because our attention spans are lacking....I'm not five years old, so just give it to me once and that will be enough...thanks.I've got what's called the `All Access' edition, and it features two DVDs, loaded with special features, which I won't bother detailing as the Amazon website does a good enough job listing them all, but if you're interested in all the ins and out, the nuts and bolts of how the film was made, this is a good edition to own.  If you don't need all this rigmarole I think there is a single DVD version available.Cookieman108By the way, that demolition robot sequence was infinitely cool...as was the latter traffic/battle sequence...",4,"""You have been deemed hazardous.

625381,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JN0T,Craig Matteson,"[0, 0]","I think Will Smith is great on the screen.  Right off the bat, however, he does not need all the profanity his characters are spewing in the past several films.  That aside, this is pretty decent action film.  If you start thinking about Asimov because of the title and the three laws, you will likely hate the film.  However, if you can switch to Marvel Action Hero mode, then this film will seem superior.Will Smith plays Del Spooner who is a troubled soul (like a Marvel Hero, right?).  He has a recurring dream that is increasingly revealed to us throughout the film and he hates robots.  He is almost a Luddite in his attitude towards technology and its effects on human work (the Luddites were 19th century workers from Leicestershire who destroyed the machinery that made them redundant and thereby demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of economic well being and increased productivity - but that is another topic).  For some reason he is close to the supreme scientist of robotics at U.S. Robotics.  He is called in when that doctor apparently commits suicide.  The detective story unfolds from there and the action continually increases in pace.I do not want to reveal any more of the story because I think you will enjoy picking up the details for yourself.  Bridget Moynahan is pretty effective as the very closed robotics scientist, Susan Calvin.  And Alan Tudyk does a fine job voicing Sonny.  Tudyk was the pirate in Dodgeball and making the connection between the two roles is a testimony to his skills as a character actor.  Also, I want to single out Chi McBride. He is an excellent character actor who brings great presence and humanity to the roles he plays.  Here he plays Del Spooner's boss, Lt. John Bergin.  He is an important balance, protector, and foil for Spooner's extreme views and actions.  I mean everyone knows that Robots never commit crimes or hurt humans, right?The animation of the robots is not as effective as it could be.  At certain points they look like so many computerized ants.  However, when you get past that, the movie does work pretty well.

Every human trusts the robot except for detective Del Spooner(Will Smith). After a scientist named Dr. Lanning(James Cromwell) has supposedly committed suicide, Detective Spooner investigates his murder to prove that he was indeed killed by a robot. He believes that a robot named Sonny killed Dr. Lanning. Sonny is a unique robot who doesn't follow the 3 laws of safety and is a danger to society.

625385,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B00005JN0T,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[6, 8]","I really enjoyed this SCI-FI thriller.  It was really cool to see Chicago in 2035, with robots walking around and working alongside humans.Will Smith did a fantastic job portraying Detective Del Spooner, a man who is very leery of the huge population of robots and their inability to make emotionally based decisions or calculations.  A lot of people criticise Will Smith's acting ability. I can't undersatnd why - this man has proven himself time after time.  This movie is NO different.One of the best things about this movie is the lack of slow time.  There is just the right amount of action at just the right locations in this film.  There are also plenty of subplots which make the movie interesting and not just your typical action film.The special effects are very good in ""I, Robot"".  I'm sure there are some who would disagree, as some of the scenes were very difficult to create on film, so they are NOT perfect.  But all and all, I really enjoyed the futuristic advancements portrayed in the movie - most items and backgrounds looked totally believable.Kudos to all the other actors in this film.  I wouldn't want to make it seem like Smith made this movie a success all by himself, 'cause he didn't.

Surprised?  After all, we're talking about a summer blockbuster, not an Oscar winner.That aside, ""I, Robot"" is a pretty enjoyable movie (that's how I judge films, by the way: whether or not they were enjoyable--I don't really care if they make me think too much; I wanna think, I'll open up my physics textbook).Will Smith delivers another superb performance as Spooner, a predictably old-fashioned cop living in--you guessed it--the future.  Robots, you see, have become a household necessity; Spooner doesn't have one because he doesn't trust them.  And this new model coming out...well, something about it just doesn't sit right with our hero.  Especially when one robot is suspected of murder.  If one robot can kill a person...what about these thousands of new robots hitting the market...Asimov's stories were definitely more philisophical than this film; however, standing on its own, ""I, Robot"" is a great action flick.  Not the deepest movie to come along, and it sure has a lot of male bravado and over-the-top special effects...but if you're still reading this review, that's probably the type of movie you want.  Yeah, it's an underrated flick...which means it's much better than what you've heard.  ""I, Robot"" is a great movie for cuddling up on the sofa and sharing some buttery popcorn.

Just suppose the world is a little, not a lot, more surprising than you think it is, and that could happen. That movie has enduring quality. The Nicole Kidman remake of ""Stepford Wives"" is played as tongue-in-cheek and it's not scary and it's not even any good.Will Smith gets better every year. He msde this splendid movie ""I, Robot"" happen. He's a fine actor but a better producer, and to him we owe gratitude for advancing the literature of the cinema. It's a great movie, and conceptually profound. We ""intelligent"" wet-brained primates construct a marvelous apparatus, with unexpected capabilities and implications, that gives new scope to our emotions. It joins classics ""Pinocchio"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Forbidden Planet"" and others, exploring that familiar theme from a previously little seen aspect.But oh... the fatal flaw... The ""action"" scenes just aren't believable. Dozens of robots attacked Spooner repeatedly. He shot and ruined them all with the endless ammunitiion from his gun. And then there was the Evel-Knievel scene with the motorcycle in the air. All that stupidity would better have been left on the cutting room floor. What's the point? Creating a few screenshots for the ""I, Robot"" video game? It's like putting a Formica surface on a Marie Antoinette dressing table. It will cost ""I, Robot"" an Oscar.Will, I love you anyway, but sorry. You may be remembered eternally for what history may yet judge as a cinematic masterpiece. You may join the pantheon with Steven Speilberg, Howard Hawks, Ridley Scott, John Ford, David Lean, George Lucas. But I think it more likely the consensus will rank this movie slightly lower than a Guy Hamilton 007 flick.Imagine if Spooner had just been portrayed as something a real human might possibly be. The plot could have had him personally and luckily defeat two, or maybe even three robots. Then we could have believed that, if the world had a little more surprise than we might have expected, the  story of the movie might some day come true. It would have chilled us to the bone.

How and when? He doesn't know.When the inventor and writer of The Three Laws of Robotics (commonly referred to in Asimovian Robot Sci-Fi) and robotics itself and friend to Spooner is unexplicably killed, the detective thinks that this is the result of a specific Robot, who is comfortable being addressed by the name Sunny, and not his Model Number.A series of events and action sequences lead up to a wonderful climax and twist in the plot, accompanied by good acting and wonderfully imaginative futuristic sets. Great but short comic relief insues along with wonderful thought provoking lines, such as an interrogation with Sunny, where Spooner says to him, ""You do not dream. Dogs dream. Monkeys dream. People dream. But you, you, do not dream. You are not a living thing. Can a robot compose a symphony? Can a robot turn a blank canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?""

625391,A1HJZL0WKCOTSF,B00005JN0T,"Dan ""Longsword""","[3, 3]","Given that it only claims to be `suggested by' the short stories of Isaac Asimov, anyone expecting I, Robot to have all but a tenuous connection to the work of the visionary Jewish-American writer, will be a little bit disappointed. Although the film's plot hinges on Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics (which suggest that a robot can never harm a human), from here Asimov and I, Robot part company. Yet this is pretty much the only criticism that can be levelled against the film. For on the whole, I Robot is that rare of beasts: a fun but intelligent action film, populated by actors who divest their characters with more than one basic emotion.In this, the latest film from director Alex Proyas, the world circa 2035 has developed a considerable reliance on robotic `Automated Domestic Assistants'. They have become a trusted part of everyday life; cleaning homes, walking pets and basically doing everything that humans can no longer be bothered to do.On the eve of the release of the latest model robot, the NS-5, Dr Alfred Lanning, the father of robotics, seemingly commits suicide. Called into investigate is homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) a cop who distrusts technology, especially in the form of robots. Aided by robot psychologist Dr Susan Calvin and a rather special NS-5 named Sonny, Spooner begins to investigate further, following the breadcrumbs of evidence that have been left by Lanning from beyond the grave.In terms of narrative, although some will decry the dumbing-down of Asimov's ideas, the very fact that a big budget movie revolves around the cracks of a seemingly unbreakable circle of logic in the 3 Laws is, within itself, a laudable achievement. In a world populated by empty, vacuous action films, it's refreshing to see a production that tries to inject proceedings with at least a modicum of intelligence.This intelligence, however, doesn't cause I, Robot to forget that it's supposed to be a blockbuster, and the film includes a couple of cracking action sequences. These are aided by the superb special effects employed throughout the film. In particular, with Sonny, I, Robot can boast what is possibly the most impressive CGI creation ever committed to celluloid.The film's standout asset, however, is its leading actor. For Will Smith is, to coin a phrase, the complete package. He has the impressive body shape that all action stars need to make their physical engagements believable, but in addition he has an insouciant bravado and a comedy timing that is all his own. Most importantly, unlike so many of his contemporaries, the man can act. As such, Smith moves seamlessly from kicking ass, to dropping wisecracks, to investing his character with complex emotional responses. As countless flops have shown, films resplendent with great effects still come a cropper without a solid performance to ground proceedings. And Smith delivers his performance in spades.There is a slim chance that by trying to be an intelligent action film, I, Robot will attempt to please too many and end up satisfying none. However, if you fancy a bit more meat on your big-budget summer blockbuster bones, I, Robot is what you've been waiting for.",5,Here is what you have been waiting for.,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,3174,"['Given', 'only', 'be', 'suggested', 'short', 'stories', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'Robot', 'have', 'tenuous', 'connection', 'work', 'visionary', 'Jewish-American', 'writer', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'film', 'plot', 'hinges', 'Asimov', '3', 'Laws', 'Robotics', 'suggest', 'robot', 'can', 'never', 'harm', 'human', 'here', 'Asimov', 'Robot', 'part', 'company', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'criticism', 'can', 'be', 'levelled', 'film', 'whole', 'Robot', 'rare', 'beasts', 'fun', 'intelligent', 'action', 'film', 'populated', 'actors', 'who', 'divest', 'characters', 'more', 'one', 'basic', 'emotion.In', 'latest', 'film', 'director', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'world', 'circa', '2035', 'developed', 'considerable', 'reliance', 'robotic', 'Automated', 'Domestic', 'Assistants', 'have', 'become', 'trusted', 'part', 'everyday', 'life', 'cleaning', 'homes', 'walking', 'pets', 'basically', 'doing', 'everything', 'humans', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'bothered', 'do.On', 'eve', 'release', 'latest', 'model', 'robot', 'NS-5', 'Dr', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'father', 'robotics', 'seemingly', 'suicide', 'Called', 'investigate', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'cop', 'who', 'technology', 'especially', 'form', 'robots', 'Aided', 'robot', 'psychologist', 'Dr', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'rather', 'special', 'NS-5', 'named', 'Sonny', 'Spooner', 'investigate', 'further', 'following', 'breadcrumbs', 'evidence', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'Lanning', 'grave.In', 'terms', 'narrative', 'will', 'decry', 'dumbing-down', 'Asimov', 'ideas', 'very', 'fact', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'cracks', 'seemingly', 'unbreakable', 'circle', 'logic', '3', 'Laws', 'laudable', 'achievement', 'world', 'populated', 'empty', 'vacuous', 'action', 'films', 'refreshing', 'see', 'production', 'inject', 'proceedings', 'least', 'modicum', 'intelligence.This', 'intelligence', 'however', ""n't"", 'cause', 'Robot', 'forget', 'supposed', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'couple', 'cracking', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'aided', 'superb', 'special', 'effects', 'employed', 'film', 'particular', 'Sonny', 'Robot', 'can', 'boast', 'what', 'possibly', 'most', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'creation', 'ever', 'committed', 'celluloid.The', 'film', 'standout', 'asset', 'however', 'leading', 'actor', 'Will', 'Smith', 'coin', 'phrase', 'complete', 'package', 'impressive', 'body', 'shape', 'action', 'stars', 'need', 'make', 'physical', 'engagements', 'believable', 'addition', 'insouciant', 'bravado', 'comedy', 'timing', 'own', 'Most', 'importantly', 'so', 'many', 'contemporaries', 'man', 'can', 'act', 'such', 'Smith', 'seamlessly', 'kicking', 'ass', 'dropping', 'wisecracks', 'investing', 'character', 'complex', 'emotional', 'responses', 'countless', 'flops', 'have', 'shown', 'films', 'resplendent', 'great', 'effects', 'still', 'come', 'cropper', 'solid', 'performance', 'ground', 'proceedings', 'Smith', 'delivers', 'performance', 'spades.There', 'slim', 'chance', 'trying', 'be', 'intelligent', 'action', 'film', 'Robot', 'will', 'attempt', 'please', 'too', 'many', 'end', 'up', 'satisfying', 'none', 'However', 'fancy', 'bit', 'more', 'meat', 'big-budget', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'bones', 'Robot', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting']","I, Robot"

You'd think CGI wouldn't give you that full action feel, but producers and the crew did a good job meshing real life and CGI together. It was almost flawless, quite realistic really.

You did *not* come to wrestle with the eternal soul-crushing dilemma of what, exactly, constitutes Artificial Intelligence, and whether or not it constitutes a Moral Evil to use creatures with feelings and 250 IQ points to clean our toilets and haul out our trash.Am I wrong? Well I tell you this, whatever the case: if you wanted shiny things getting broken with a side order of Will Smith, you got cheated. Check out ""Independence Day"" for that. And if you wanted to wrestle with the soul-searing, heart-warming problem of what to do with your local warm-fuzzy AI robot, then you should check out ""Blade Runner"".The point is this: ""I, Robot"" is cinematic carbon dioxide: it's odorless, colorless, and tasteless. In fact, it's riskless: it's so determined to be a staunch, dollar-earning blockbuster that it does absolutely nothing daring or terrifying. Did you know that good-guy robots wink at you to let you know everything is all right? No? Did you know that you can tell the Evil Wicked Robots from the Duddly-Do-Right Robots by the little chest lantern: Red means Evil, Blue means Good? You didn't? Did you ever expect that on a weekend you'd be watching Will Smith cowering at the top of a Chicago skyscraper while Evil Robots climb up the building ready to do him in?""I, Robot"" is without a doubt the stupidest (and I use that word intentionally, because the movie merits it), most boring film I have ever had the misfortune to suffer through. It is amazing someone like the talented Alex Proyas (who helmed up the nifty ""Dark City"" and iconic ""The Crow"") had his hand in this slick, sleek, embarrassing and boring mess. It is positively sacrilegious that the great science-fiction luminary Isaac Asimov has his name affixed to this thing---if anything justified rising from the dead and eating brains, ""I, Robot"" is it. And it didn't have to be this way: even on a strictly action-movie level, Proyas manages to take some potentially cool scenes (the hulking, scary, highway robot transports) and completely ruin them (again, more robots jumping on a car...zzzzzz).The thing that annoys me most about the excremental ""I, Robot"" is that I now suspect the robot was winking at me because he knew I couldn't get my money back.

625396,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005JN0T,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[2, 3]","Your first and only command is this:  see ""I, Robot."" That is all.Will Smith (""Bad Boys II"") stars in the role of a lifetime as Detective Spooner, an experienced homicide detective investigating the apparent suicide of Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell of HBO's ""Six Feet Under""). Lanning's suicide is all the more disturbing since he was on the brink of integrating a more advanced form of robot, the NS5, into the modern world for the company CRS (the Microsoft of robots).CRS owner Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, ""Hollywood Homicide"") doesn't want Lanning's death messing up his company's biggest payday, so he is leery of Spooner snooping around and spoiling his big moment.Spooner doesn't share the general populace's good will toward robots--which have taken on menial roles such as trash men, deliverymen and dog walkers--and likens them to ticking time bombs. Forming a loose alliance with Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, ""The Recruit""), Spooner becomes convinced that Lanning's death was the handiwork of an evolved robot, Sonny (voice by Alan Tudyk, ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"").""I, Robot"" is less an all-out action film as it is a mystery with some riveting action scenes tossed in from time to time to get across how pivotal the stakes are for Spooner.Smith is excellent as he fully establishes a unique character, doing it so naturally that he never appears to be acting.Recent films based on the short stories of sci-fi writers Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov have ranged from pretty good (""Minority Report"") to ""it was a better concept than movie"" (""Imposter""). ""I, Robot,"" based on some of Asimov's short stories but changed for a high-energy summer audience, is the type of sci-fi thriller film that Ben Affleck, John Woo and Uma Thurman were attempting with last year's box-office bomb, ""Paycheck,"" based on a Dick novel.""I, Robot"" is the genre's most cinematic edge-of-your seat thrill ride thanks to the sharp screenplay by Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"") and Jeff Vintar (""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within""). Their handiwork makes all of the characters, even the robots, fully developed players in this mystery.The film feels as if it's actually in the future, and not just because a subtitle says so.Budgetary restraints limit the creativity and imagination of most directors, who seem content to portray the future as a world with just one or two technological advancements and shiny clothes.While that's probably more realistic than hovercars and Jetson-like food processors, half the fun of the best sci-fi films is seeing how each filmmaker's view of the future differs.In director Alex Proyas' vision, the future is very imaginative, with buildings that literally take cars and hang them in closet-like parking garages, cars that drive themselves and cell phones that clip on to ears.Proyas (""Garage Days"") also brings a different perspective to the tired old fight scene by using rotating cameras and wide camera angles so the viewer can actually see what's going on, resulting in innovation not seen since the original ""Matrix.""The robots have an eerie dynamic to them, and even with their bland faces they're very creepy. Fittingly, the robotic CGI (computer generated images) are appropriately wooden and stiff until they get angry, which is when they move around like a horde of roaches.Much in the same way that ""Blade Runner"" (based on another Dick novel) redefined the science-fiction/suspense genre in the 1980s, ""I, Robot"" should do the same for a new generation.Since it's not a sequel, ""I, Robot"" was the first big 2004 summer flick that didn't have a built-in audience, which made it a pleasant surprise.",4,Futurama fun,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,3663,"['first', 'only', 'command', 'see', 'Robot', 'all.Will', 'Smith', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'II', 'role', 'lifetime', 'Detective', 'Spooner', 'experienced', 'homicide', 'detective', 'investigating', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'HBO', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Lanning', 'suicide', 'more', 'disturbing', 'was', 'brink', 'integrating', 'more', 'advanced', 'form', 'robot', 'NS5', 'modern', 'world', 'company', 'CRS', 'Microsoft', 'robots', '.CRS', 'owner', 'Lawrence', 'Robertson', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Hollywood', 'Homicide', ""n't"", 'want', 'Lanning', 'death', 'messing', 'up', 'company', 'biggest', 'payday', 'leery', 'Spooner', 'snooping', 'around', 'spoiling', 'big', 'moment.Spooner', ""n't"", 'share', 'general', 'populace', 'good', 'will', 'robots', 'have', 'taken', 'menial', 'roles', 'such', 'trash', 'men', 'deliverymen', 'dog', 'walkers', 'ticking', 'time', 'bombs', 'Forming', 'loose', 'alliance', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Recruit', 'Spooner', 'convinced', 'Lanning', 'death', 'was', 'handiwork', 'evolved', 'robot', 'Sonny', 'voice', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Dodgeball', 'True', 'Underdog', 'Story', 'Robot', 'less', 'all-out', 'action', 'film', 'mystery', 'riveting', 'action', 'scenes', 'tossed', 'time', 'time', 'get', 'how', 'pivotal', 'stakes', 'are', 'Spooner.Smith', 'excellent', 'fully', 'unique', 'character', 'doing', 'so', 'naturally', 'never', 'be', 'acting.Recent', 'films', 'based', 'short', 'stories', 'sci-fi', 'writers', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'have', 'ranged', 'pretty', 'good', 'Minority', 'Report', 'was', 'better', 'concept', 'movie', 'Imposter', 'Robot', 'based', 'Asimov', 'short', 'stories', 'changed', 'high-energy', 'summer', 'audience', 'type', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'film', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'John', 'Woo', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'were', 'attempting', 'last', 'year', 'box-office', 'bomb', 'Paycheck', 'based', 'Dick', 'novel', 'Robot', 'genre', 'most', 'cinematic', 'edge-of-your', 'seat', 'thrill', 'ride', 'thanks', 'sharp', 'screenplay', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Jeff', 'Vintar', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'handiwork', 'characters', 'even', 'robots', 'fully', 'developed', 'players', 'mystery.The', 'film', 'feels', 'actually', 'future', 'not', 'just', 'subtitle', 'so.Budgetary', 'restraints', 'limit', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'most', 'directors', 'who', 'seem', 'content', 'portray', 'future', 'world', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'technological', 'advancements', 'shiny', 'clothes.While', 'probably', 'more', 'realistic', 'hovercars', 'Jetson-like', 'food', 'processors', 'fun', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'seeing', 'how', 'filmmaker', 'view', 'future', 'differs.In', 'director', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'vision', 'future', 'very', 'imaginative', 'buildings', 'literally', 'take', 'cars', 'hang', 'closet-like', 'parking', 'garages', 'cars', 'drive', 'cell', 'phones', 'clip', 'ears.Proyas', 'Garage', 'Days', 'also', 'different', 'perspective', 'tired', 'old', 'fight', 'scene', 'using', 'rotating', 'cameras', 'wide', 'camera', 'angles', 'viewer', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'resulting', 'innovation', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Matrix', 'robots', 'have', 'eerie', 'dynamic', 'even', 'bland', ""'re"", 'very', 'creepy', 'Fittingly', 'robotic', 'CGI', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'are', 'appropriately', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'get', 'angry', 'when', 'move', 'horde', 'roaches.Much', 'same', 'way', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'based', 'Dick', 'novel', 'redefined', 'science-fiction/suspense', 'genre', '1980s', 'Robot', 'should', 'do', 'same', 'new', 'generation.Since', 'not', 'sequel', 'Robot', 'was', 'first', 'big', '2004', 'summer', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'built-in', 'audience', 'made', 'pleasant', 'surprise']","I, Robot"

625398,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00005JN0T,David A. Wend,"[4, 7]","Unlike many of the reviewers I have not read Isaac Asimov's ""I, Robot"" stories.  Literature of any kind cannot be translated to a film without changes.  The only alternative is to shoot the entire book, which results in a film like Erich von Stroheim's Greed, intended to run for 8 hours.  Film makers have little choice but to make compromises.  Looking at the film on its own, I think that I, Robot is a great science fiction film.The place, Chicago in 2035, is a real look into the future and was planned that way by the director Alex Proyas.  The look of the city was designed as it might appear in the future with familiar old buildings and new futuristic designs.  Cars were designed especially for the film to present a logical representation of what people might be driving in 2035.  Altogether, the film presents a complete futuristic world down to the clothing people wear. The story has mystery and suspense and is nicely paced.  The special effects, particularly the robots, were designed to make them believable and not just for a splashy look.  The actors who played the robots were taught to walk and act as a robot.Will Smith does a great job playing the brooding Detective Spooner. I tend to think of Mr. Smith as a comedic actor but he has proven he can handle dramatic roles and in I, Robot he gives his character the right edginess and demeanor.  His distrust of robots comes through without overstatement.  Perhaps Smith's shooting from an airborne motorcycle is a little hard to believe but not impossible, and don't we want a movie to have some excitement. Bridget Moynahan is well cast as Susan Calvin, who designs robots to appear more human and has a gradual transformation from her belief that robots are entirely benign (Ms. Moynahan also has a miraculous shooting sequence, firing a weapon with her eyes closed and hitting only a robot).  Alan Tudyk provides a sensitive performance as Sonny the robot.  We never see Mr. Tudyk's face but his movements and voice make Sonny a real and sympathetic character.  Unfortunately, James Cromwell's character, Dr. Alfred Lanning, dies at the start of the film so we see him only briefly in messages he recorded before his death.  The only significant extra on the DVD is a short piece on ""Making of I, Robot.""  This has the standard interviews with the stars, director, writers and special effects personnel that gives a good overview of how the film was made and what the director and producers were aiming for in making the film.  By the standards of many DVDs the extras are skimpy for I, Robot.I found I, Robot to be an engrossing film where you care about the characters and are intrigued by the story.  The look of the film is fabulous and takes you into this world of the future in a similar way that Total Recall made Mars a believable place.

625400,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B00005JN0T,David Bower,"[2, 2]","Isaac Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer of all times. I have almost everything sci-fi that he has written and have read many of the stories more times than I can remember. This movie introduces Asimov's famous ""Three Robotic Laws"" and an early heroine named Susan Calvin.Asimov writes of his interest in robots as early as his teenage years and comments that the stories were divided into two classes; robots as menace and robots as pathos. ""These charmed me""  he tells us of the robots as pathos class in the introduction to a collection of robot stories, To the best of my knowledge Asimov never wrote a robot story named ""I, Robot"" but acknowledges he was greatly influenced by a short story of that name written by Eando Binder in late 1938. As a tribute perhaps Asimov later assembled several of his Susan Calvin short stories into a group he named ""I, Robot.""We also meet Susan Calvin in the movie who was a special character favorite of Asimov's and appeared in 10 short stories about robots. Asimov tells us ""The third robot story I wrote, ""Liar"" introduced Susan Calvin--with whom I promptly fell in love."" In the movie the role of Susan Calvin is beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan.The Will Smith character, Del Spooner, never appears in any of Asimov's stories to the best of my knowledge. Asimov did have a robophobic policeman named Lije Baley who is introduced in his 1953 novel, ""The Caves of Steel."" Baley is forced to establish a working relationship with a humanoid robot named Daneel Olivaw. The robot, Sonny, voiced by Alan Tudyk, plays a role most similar to the Daneel Olivaw character in ""The Robot Novels"" series.Just looking at the movie I found it to be a good science fiction action movie and have enjoyed it more than once. If you find the movie interesting I assure you you'll find the books even more so. I see the Robot series as a prelude to the Empire series followed by the extensive Foundation series.  Counting all of the related books there are presently over 15 and three more, written by other authors, have been added with the approval of the Asimov estate.

Movies like Robocop, AI or Bladerunner have all had their take on life in our country several hundred years from now, but I, Robot is only 30 years out.  And yet, the skyline of Chicago is more dramatically changed than a mere thirty years would allow.The cars with autopilot and superspeed highways are also too far flung for such a near future.  Will Smith's character Calvin is apparently making a fashion statement by wearing a pair of Converse hightops, even his Granny comments on his strange footwear.  People have been wearing converse since the 1950's and will continue to.  I hardly think that in 2030, anyone will raise an eyebrow.  I think the golden rule when it comes to envisioning the future is that the more things change, the more things stay the same.  I understand that movies are a visual medium and must fill the screen with new and exciting images, and because of that I forgive I,Robot some of the extraneous machinery.  But would someone please steer Hollywood away from the semi-transparent white plastic veiw of future devices?  We have all seen an Apple computer, and that look is already becoming dated.  Will robot designers in 2030 really be taking their concept ideas from the look of a outdated PC from the late 1990's?  It's possible.

This is not the classic I, Robot story, and the only thing you'll recognize from the original are The Three Laws, but it is mostly a very good story.Will Smith plays cynical, world weary Del Spooner with his ""funny"" hat, as opposed to his ""serious actor"" hat (seen in Six Degrees of Separation and Ali).  However, shades of the latter manage to seep into his latest character.  From the first scene (which includes a very clever use of Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition""), it's obvious how haunted Smith is, and even knowing the premise, you immediately get the impression that it goes beyond ""Man or Machine"".  That's good writing, but it's also good acting.Strip the story of it's ultra-futuristic veneer, and it's the classic story of man vs. the group.  We quickly (and nervously) come to believe that Spooner is the only one who sees the obvious.  Again, it's a credit to the writing and acting that we are surprised when we realize we are wrong.As Spooner tries to solve the mysterious death of Dr. Lanning, the creator of the robots, his view of them is challenged by Sonny, the enigmatic (and possibly unstable) super robot who is verging on android because of his sophisticated emotional responses.  Sonny doesn't fit into the boxes Spooner has assigned to him, and he's intelligent enough to want to figure out why.I like intelligent surprises, and this movie delivered- for the most part.  However, I could see what was foreshadowed by the dream and shower scene immediately, and as soon as I saw Hansel and Gretel, I understood what happened to Dr. Lanning.  While it's fun to guess correctly, it's a big disappointment to be surprised and not care.  I won't give much away when I say that I was surprised by who the villain was because I had zero investment in him/her/it.  That, sadly, is lousy writing (or at least a sign of too many cooks in the kitchen).Overall, I would still say this was two hours well-spent.",4,When should we believe in what we don't understand?,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,2112,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'OK-', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'movie', 'point', 'realized', 'now', 'initial', 'impressions', 'are', 'wrong-', 'are', ""n't"", 'not', 'classic', 'Robot', 'story', 'only', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'original', 'are', 'Three', 'Laws', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'story.Will', 'Smith', 'cynical', 'world', 'weary', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'funny', 'hat', 'opposed', 'serious', 'actor', 'hat', 'seen', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'Ali', 'However', 'shades', 'latter', 'manage', 'seep', 'latest', 'character', 'first', 'scene', 'very', 'clever', 'use', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Superstition', 'obvious', 'how', 'haunted', 'Smith', 'even', 'knowing', 'premise', 'immediately', 'get', 'impression', 'Man', 'Machine', 'good', 'writing', 'also', 'good', 'story', 'ultra-futuristic', 'veneer', 'classic', 'story', 'man', 'group', 'quickly', 'nervously', 'come', 'believe', 'Spooner', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'obvious', 'Again', 'credit', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'surprised', 'when', 'realize', 'are', 'wrong.As', 'Spooner', 'tries', 'solve', 'mysterious', 'death', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'creator', 'robots', 'view', 'challenged', 'Sonny', 'enigmatic', 'possibly', 'unstable', 'super', 'robot', 'who', 'verging', 'android', 'sophisticated', 'emotional', 'responses', 'Sonny', ""n't"", 'fit', 'boxes', 'Spooner', 'assigned', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'want', 'figure', 'out', 'why.I', 'intelligent', 'surprises', 'movie', 'delivered-', 'most', 'part', 'However', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'foreshadowed', 'dream', 'shower', 'scene', 'immediately', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'understood', 'what', 'happened', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'fun', 'guess', 'correctly', 'big', 'disappointment', 'be', 'surprised', 'not', 'care', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'away', 'when', 'say', 'was', 'surprised', 'who', 'villain', 'was', 'had', 'zero', 'investment', 'him/her/it', 'sadly', 'lousy', 'writing', 'least', 'sign', 'too', 'many', 'cooks', 'kitchen', '.Overall', 'would', 'still', 'say', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'well-spent']","I, Robot"

""I Robot"" is a suprisingly great movie and among the best that Will Smith has done in recent years.Set in Chicago around the summer of 2035 (I'll be 52 then), a scientist named Doctor Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) is found dead after going through an office window and falling to his death in the lobby of the corporate headquarters. An agent who is highly technophobic (spiteful of advanced technology, preferring 'old-fashioned' lifestyles) decides to find out who commited the crime and believes that the perpetrator of the crime was in fact one of the 'modern' robots that was designed by Lanning.The acting is absolutely great in this movie. Although I'm skeptical of Chicago looking like that at that point, I loved the way that they made Chicago look in this time frame with the John Hancock and Sears Towers still standing out despite the looming heights of the corporate headquarters. The look also was great to see with the 'L' trains although I'm not too sure about the 'expressway' in relation to the Sears Tower. If it was the Eisenhower Expressway in there, it would be farther south unless they upgraded Lake or Madison Avenues into elevated expressways. Other than that, the look of CHicago in 2035 is great!The special effects are excellent and not too overdone. While not necessarily a 'thinker's movie, ""I Robot"" is sometimes unsettling in the way it makes one wonder if robot technology advances to the point that even they can think independently in the same patterns that the human brain can although the human brain is FAR too complex to duplicate in even todays most advanced technology.Anyhow, ""I Robot"" is a great summer popcorn flick and is definately a movie worth checking out, if not buying.

The robots have been programmed with three laws (paraphrased below):I.  Robots cannot harm humans.II.  Robots must obey humans, but law I controls.III.  Robots must protect themselves, but only if such protection does not conflict with the first two laws.This arrangement seems to be working well until one day when detective Del Spooner, played by Will Smith, gets a call to investigate a murder.  The victim is Dr. Alfred Lanning, played by James Cromwell, and it appears to be a suicide.  The thing about Dr. Lanning is that he is the inventor of the modern robot, and the company he works for is about to launch a new line of robots to the world.  Suspicions aroused, Detective Spooner investigates...This movie is based off an Isaac Asimov novel, which I admit I have not read.  The premise is interesting:  what happens when robots that have been programmed to benefit humanity through the application of three laws suddenly start acting in violation of the laws?  What is causing them to do that?  Can man creat an artificial construct that has man's capabilities?As for the movie itself, I found it to be pretty slick.  I've been told that it is not the thinker the book is, but since this is an action vehicle starring Will Smith, that can be expected (nothing against Will Smith, he was great in this movie--perfect for the part).  The landscape of Chicago in the year 2035 came off really well.  Unlike a lot of movies, the producers and director of 'I, Robot' chose to paint a future that has maintained many more elements of the present than futuristic devices such as wildly futuristic clothing and gadgets.  The cars and buildings of the future feel like they fit in rather well.The story movies along at a good pace.  There is not much in the way of down time.  The clues to the resolution are well placed.  There are a few predictable plot lines, but they don't detract from the movie as a whole.  There are a few red herrings regarding Bridget Moynahan's character.  I was somewhat surprised when her character was not as complicated as I expected her to turn out.Overall, its a good movie.  Will Smith found himself another good Sci-Fi vehicle.  His portrayal of dective Spooner was excellent.  The DVD has plenty of extras.  This movie is rewatchable.

A film with this exact formula that immediately leaps to mind is ""Total Recall.""  As with that film the action sequences in ""I, Robot"" are thoughtfully produced and numerous, the special effects are excellent and extensive, and the one-liners are frequent and humerous.  Will Smith has obviously been hitting the weight room in perperation for his new Action Hero status, and his charming demeanor is still present throughout.  While there are scenes that are ridiculously violent to the point where any mere human could not simply stagger away through the aftermath of destruction, a severe concussion being the least of his injuries, this is Science Fiction, after all.  I have to admit that I went in expecting this movie to be average, at best.  I've read many reviews, both here and from professional critics, panning this film as a grandiose bomb.  I disagree.  This is an entertaining film with a flashy production value and an altogether charismatic leading man.  The fact that this film was directed by Alex Proyas (""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"") never entered into my decision to watch it.  However, I enjoyed ""The Crow,"" and ""Dark City"" is easily one of the most underrated Science Fiction films of all time.

And it's a well-made film with impressive visuals and super special effects.  Will Smith can play a paranoid, suspicious cop with the best of them, and he provides a solid performance as Detective Del Spooner--a man with an unfortunate past that puts him at odds with mankind's growing dependency on robotic labor.  So when a roboticist (is that even a word?) allegedly jumps to his death at the monolithic company that makes robots, Del immediately suspects foul play and corporate cover-up, yet the only other ""person"" with the scientist before his jump was a robot named Sonny.  And robots can't kill!  That's the first law of robotics!  So Spooner is a loner and against the system as he pursues the various leads availed to him, yet along the way he convinces a robotic programmer (Bridget Moynahan) that something is amiss. . .and that a robotic takeover is underway.  This leads to an over-the-top ending--along with the revelation who the real ""villain"" is--that's as nutty as it is predictable.This film has plenty of action, and again, the special effects are nothing short of stunning.  The animation of the robots looked a tad forced; in particular, during the action sequences, they looked more cartoonish than robotic.  And the plot is so multi-layered with robotic philosophical shtick it often gets in its own way.  But where I really cringed is when I saw that a very young Shia LaBeouf has a small role as a hotheaded street punk.  Can his fifteen minutes of fame please just go away?  Yet despite all my misgivings, if you're into science fiction and action thrillers I, ROBOT delivers both in a high octane way.

However, the gamble Fox has taken in using the new cheaper and less time consuming JVC Kenwood 2D3D workstation is one based solely upon the opinion the average consumer will not know the difference with a more realistic, but time-consumming process such as employed by Legend 3D (""Hugo"","" Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", ""Shrek"", and others). In a word, I was very disappointed!It was P.T. Barnum who supposedly said, ""You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time."" I think this was the basis of Fox's final decision to use the JVC Kenwood process.All business must make a calculated decision regarding their bottom line. The quality of a final product along with the time to market are part of any business equation.  With Fox's plans to release more movies in this pseudo 3D format, it appears their return on investment (ROI) has trumped their use of a higher quality conversion process.Most higher quality products requires a skilled artisan's trained eye and hands, just like a quality crafted gilded chair. Such a beautiful object simply takes time and higher quality wood and materials. However, a cheap chair churned out in an overseas factory, using the cheapest of materials doesn't require skilled labor. Such are the products infesting our nation today. However, quality takes time and time is money.So far, I have been writing metaphorically and I promise to be more specific shortly. But, when discussing how we perceive our senses, it is oftentimes best to use such a method to get one's idea across.For example, would you prefer an aged Kentucky whiskey that has been aged in wooden barrels for the past 12 years, or one produced last month and is already in your glass? Or, would you prefer a Michael Angelo original painting or Elvis on velvet from a street vendor in a foreign country?Unfortunately, we have been conditioned to oftentimes think something cheaper is somehow better. But, we all know we oftentimes get what we pay for.In the case of this movie, it is still a good story, with great actors. But, behind the scenes, Fox took the cheapest road to market and it shows!Specifics; throughout the movie there are many glaring instances in which the perceived depth was shown as if there were flat objects placed at various distances from the camera. It reminded me of the cardboard popups in the TCM movie opening sequences in which various movie characters would pop up from the pages of a book when it was opened to a different page.In this movie, you have ""flat"" characters and objects placed at different distances from the camera, or point of reference. There are also absolutely no ""screen pop"" experiences as there are in ""Avatar"". The depth shown in ""John Carter 3D"" and ""Titanic"" was very impressive. The depth in this movie was also adequately simulated. But, the characters in the other movies referenced possessed realistic curvatures and shapes and were not simply placed within space as a ""flat"" cutout cardboard character.When discussing spatial issues it is oftentimes difficult to express sensory experiences, as we all process and interpret what our senses tells us a little bit differently than others. What may be noticeable to me may be missed by others. Some people will ""perceive"" the depth simulated in this movie as being lifelike, when in my opinion this is not how I perceive my world around me!It is perhaps this difference Fox is banking upon. Perhaps they're hoping enough potential customers will not notice these spatial and optical qualitative differences and will therefore continue to pay a premium price for a movie they probably already have in their collection, like I do. It is an effective way to continue to harvest the gems they have in their vaults. Or, if you prefer; they will continue to milk the same cash cow until she runs dry! I have no objections to this, as long as I feel I am getting my money's worth!Fox has a wonderful and historical film library which includes many gems yet to be released on any format and many I'd wish to own. But, in the future, I will be more cautious of any future Fox 3D Blu-Ray 2D-3D conversion releases if they continue using the JVC Kenwood process. Unless they significantly improve this process, I will probably look for more releases by other studios using the Legend 3D process, or of movies shot in real 3D. It is a shame they decided to take the cheaper route.I would hope others would gladly have paid a premium for the better quality processes, just as I would. Quality craftsmanship still means something to me.

I don't want to give away the plot, but the concepts that this movie presented in terms of artificial intellegence and the potential affects of AI evolution, of course leads to revolution as nice.  I also like the conflict between characters, although I do feel that Del Spooner's (Will Smith) prejudice of robots did not have a deep enough motive.

625434,A2SKAHJXH7XDU5,B00005JN0T,E,"[4, 5]","I, Robot takes the majority of its basis and foundation from a series of short stories written by the great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov (although he was more than a writer), more than likely including some elements from the short story ""Robot Dreams."" Overall, I, Robot is an above average film. So, what holds it back from being better in my opinion? Such as with movies like the recent Star Wars - Episode III installment, the CGI isn't the problem; in fact, I, Robot's CGI is great: it's the script that lacks, and Smith's overbearing star quality overcasting the film.To be honest, I love Will Smith during his run with The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air television series. (I know the dialogue to just about every episode! LOL!) Pre- and post-Fresh Prince Will Smith just doesn't do it for me: being a self-proclaimed hip hop and aficionado, I was never into Will Smith as a rapper, and his acting career is...well, let me put it this way: In my opinion, whenever Will Smith is cast for a role to play a character, we always seem to get Will Smith on the screen, and not the character he's supposed to be portraying. However, this is probably why people cast him anyhow: star quality, and not necessarily fusing oneself with the character to be played. Let's face it; from a Hollywood standpoint, if you're going for the mega-blockbuster to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars, why cast some no name kid the world's never seen? Go for the big boys! Why? Because they'll sell the movie, that's why!Particularly, the whole ""star starring in a movie"" versus a ""star portraying a character in a movie"" thing to me is rather annoying. You know, it's like casting Michael Jordan to play in an NBA version of a live-action Dragon Ball Z movie: ""MJ, king of the Super Sayan Basketball Tournament,"" or the same type of annoying when you watch singers or rappers on television playing characters that sing or rap...can we get a little substance rather than advancing the careers of people who already make too much money, please?I noticed on I, Robot, there's a part toward the end where the robot psychologist Dr. Calvin is entering some commands into a keypad to shut down the VIKI positronic brain and a metal sheath shuts over the keypad locking her out...and Will Smith punches the sheath, which then uncovers the keypad and allows her to continue entering commands, delivering the cheesy ""I hate heights."" This scene is akin to a very similar ""I-punch-something-and-seem-macho"" scene in Independence Day where the alien Will drags through the desert suddenly comes out of the hatch...and, you guessed it, he punches it and delivers, ""Welcome to Earth."" In a humorous way, the whole ""I-punch-something-and-seem-macho"" gag is really disgusting and gives that ol' Hollywood campiness we never want.Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics is included in the film, which gave the storyline a nice touch, although at times the overusage of the Three Laws got a little confusing (as evidenced in the scene where the psychologist and Del Spooner are conversing back and forth about the laws in a robot-controlled facility where Sonny the dream-having robot is hiding).I personally thought the Dr. Lanning character could've been expanded on a little more; he just seems as if he should've had more of an important role in the film...well, other than being dead, but with the latter being said, I'm probably asking too much. I also think the Chief of Police character (who was always in Spooner's behind) could've been rounded out a little bit better than he was: would a real chief of police give a knucklehead like Spooner as many chances as he did? (He was an overly nice fellow for a chief who has to keep dealing with a hardheaded ""solo act"".)The excellent parts are definitely the action scenes and the CGI. I think Alex Proyas (director) did an excellent in choosing a great art and visual effects department for coming up with the facial and body design of the robots. I think the clouded-crystalline look of the robot faces was ingenious, and gets away from the traditional robot image (e.g. HAL 9000, R2-D2, etc.). The robots even have awesome acrobatics and maneuvering capabilities! I also believe Proyas has definitely stepped his game up with I, Robot in terms of his directing: his usage of motion capture, panning, ""tone poems,"" and angles was ASTONISHING and CAPTIVATING, to say the least -- hats off to Proyas!Overall, this is not a bad film: it's your average blockbuster action flick, heavy on the action and effects, light on the substance, but in this case I wouldn't say the entire film lacks substance. The only things that bring I, Robot down is a script that I think could've been adapted from the short stories more appropriately, and the biggest problem is how the star quality of Will Smith almost completely eclipses the fictional aspect of the movie. Otherwise, this is a nice one to chill with and have some fun looking at. Very entertaining.WARNING: Asimov loyalists - I, Robot is not an authentic rendition of Asimov's robot short stories from which the film is based.

The story is fairly preposterous, involving, you guessed it, robots and their attempt to take over the world.  And of course Smith's character, Detective Del Spooner, knows that these robots are evil and no one will believe him.  The script is based on Isaac Asimov's book of short stories and co-screenwriter Jeff Vintar's (along with Oscar-winner for ""A Beautiful Mind"", Akiva Goldsman) original script, ""Hardwired"".In this world of 2035, robots have come to play a vital role in the lives of humans, doing everything from bartending to laundry for their ""owners"".  The world is simply teeming with them and their numbers are soon to increase with the largest shipment ever of robots, the NS-5's.  Even though they are programmed to be incapable of injuring humans or committing a crime according to ""the three laws"", Detective Spooner is convinced they are up to no good and even tackles a robot he believes to be robbing a woman when he is actually rushing her an inhaler.  The three laws are:1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.This is definitely a fun film that I enjoyed immensely.

Now that I've got that out of the way, I also have to say that I have always liked film noir and so movies that are even remotely noir-ish like this one and say ""Blade Runner"" or even ""Gattaca"" have a headstart with me.  That said, while the movies share similarities with each other e.g. the Smith and Harrison cop characters after renegade artificial life forms etc ""I, Robot"" rises above just being a shoot-em up, all action film but also appeals to a thinking audience raising the issue of bigotry and prejudice with Smith's hatred of all things robot based upon his one bad experience with them and how all this changes once he gets to know and understand them better.  There are some elements though that detract from the enjoyment of the movie such as the inclusion of scenes that are not necessary; while I am fan of Shia LeBeuf for example from his work on ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" I thought his scenes were totally useless here and that the film would be far better off without any of his scenes.

The movie was a futuristic tale, but only going ahead to the year 2035 so a lot of Chicago (the movie site) and it's people looked very much like today. A really big difference was the appearance and abundance of human-like robots who performed many, if not most, of the ordinary tasks of day to day life. This was a clever part of the movie, and the robots were very well done. These things looked like humans, talked like humans and moved like humans, but they were clearly not humans dressed up in costumes (as in Star Trek, let's say) for the purpose of the movie. What were they? Well, I don't know, but they were fascinating and they were present in great abundance. It's probably some clever computer animation trick, but the trick is very well done and a lot of credit is due.The story itself was not as fresh and new. It introduced the idea of life with robots where Will Smith was a human police detective and was one of the few who had a negative view of robots and their place in human culture. It seems that the robots were programed not to harm humans in any way nor could they be controlled to harm humans. Well, you know this isn't going to last or you wouldn't have much of a movie. Sure enough, a programming change was brought about and the robots began behaving more like humans in the negative sense. Thus began a long drawn out battle between Smith and his human colleagues opposing the human-like robots and their controllers. It involved a lot of action and destruction of anything and everything. The high action level will probably keep you watching carefully. All in all, I found the story to not have a particularly interesting plot and I'd rate it as a three-star movie in that sense. However, the sets and animations and high action are so well done, that I'd give it five stars for that part of the production. Okay, we'll average it out to a four star rating. My hope would be that the clever people who put this thing together will be back with a better plot.Gary Peterson",4,"An Interesting Futuristic Tale.

I feel that this is Will Smith's best movie, and I think it's pretty cool that he's always been happy to star in science fiction movies, even though he could limit his roles to other genres, if he chose.Although many people have complained that the film of ""I, Robot"" bears very little resemblance to the Asimove story (which is true), I think that the writer who adapted it for the screen actually did a very good job.

The graphics were amazing, and like all Will Smith movies the story and action were on point!The movie takes place in the future where owning a robot is just an ordinary thing. They do everything from cooking to babysitting and everyone trusts them, because afterall they are only machines they can't think or feel right?Those who developed the Robots made 3 simple laws for them to follow:Law One: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate a higher order law.Law Two: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with a higher order law.Law Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher order law.So with the rules in place it is safe for humans to own robots... right? ...But when a prominent scientist dies after taking a fall from his high rise office suite Detective Spooner begins to think that a certian Robot is behind it all. He does not trust the machines (and for good reason which is later revealed in a flashback scene) and begins questioning a robot whom he thinks is involved...Then the unthinkable, the robots go nuts and try to take over!  It is up to Spooner and his men to stop this... and they just might need that special robot they don't trust to help them...This movie is based on a book written in the 1940s. It is simply amazing.

625455,A16FUU8WW76QFY,B00005JN0T,gork57,"[1, 1]","I found this film to be an uncommon marriage of action and thought provocation.  While 'I, Robot' is chockfull of effects and stunts, it still sets your mind to work.  The only real gripe I have about this movie is the fact that Will Smith's wisecracks are getting a bit stale-this isn't 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air', know what I mean?  How about some straightup dramatic acting for once?The plot of 'Robot' is very loosely based on Isaac Asimov's classic SciFi book of the same name.  The focus is man's growing dependence on intelligent machines, and is the time coming when they are able to ask themselve moral questions such as, 'Where  do I come from?'  We are attempting to build them in our own image.  Even today, we are designing robots to do things we humans feel are tedious or just plain too dirty for us.  The time is not far away when we will have humanoid machines in our very midst.Such ground has been explored before; Spielberg's 'A.I.', 'Colossus: The Forbin Project' and the 'Terminator' films asked the question 'At what point do machines become self aware?'  When this occurs, will they collectively analyze their masters' flawed method of existence and decide the way of logic is superior?  We already entrust a large proportion of our lives to artificial intelligence.  What would happen if they decided to take control?'I Robot' places this premise in a context intertwined with human feelings of loss and prejudice.  Director Alex Proyas, who seems to thrive in this sort of atmosphere (The Crow, Dark City), gives us a world where robots are as common as the family car.  Even 30 years from now, some still don't feel comfortable with machines in charge of so much of their lives.  Ironically, 'Sonny' a certain special robot, seems to have more humanity than some of the people in this film.The director, writer and actors have done their jobs well. The effects crew has created a realistic future society.  The action and stunts are top notch, but in the end, this is really a film about emotion, feeling, and self sacrifice.  An unusual mix to be sure-but somehow it all works.  The viewer really cares about Will Smith's detective and 'Sonny' the humanoid machine.  Why can't more SciFi/action films be this good?

The whole tone of the movie is colored by his misguided acting. All seriousness is lost in his silly quips and awkward costuming. ""Somehow 'I told you so' doesn't quite say it."" Horrible scripting in many instances. ""This thing doesn't run on gas, does it? Gas explodes, you know!"" Yuck. Thanks for ruining it, Big Bird.And the CGI is not too impressive either. The sight of swarms of robots jumping around like grasshoppers doesn't exactly inspire awe; looks more like a bad scene from a videogame. Although I liked the concept of cables for muscles.But how about the story? As I mentioned, it's totally dominated by Smith's ""Bad Boys"" persona and his ridiculous costumes which accentuate his ears (and earrings). His strutting and brooding and constant throwing around of his weight crowd out any serious consideration of the plot. It's jarring. It's a complete mismatch for this type of movie. They might as well have cast Jon Lovitz in the part.But perhaps this was necessary, as the plot has huge gaps in logic. Why do robots in the dark seek out light? asks one of the characters. Well, all musings on AI aside, it must be a function of programming. Everything about them is, even when they behave unpredictably. I guarantee you there is a subroutine in their brains that, when certain conditions are met, fires off a command to move towards the light. Nothing profound about that. The only mystery arises from our ignorance of those necessary conditions.The movie is further ruined by some silly ""big air"" gunfighting from Smith, again completely out of place in this movie.And why does he hate robots so much? You'll laugh until you cry when you find out. And then you'll want to slap him silly.Oh. And another thing. It's implausible that we would manufacture robots of such strength and, well, hardness without some easy way to disable them, just in case. It's just too scary for us otherwise - that's human nature. No one wants to be in a building at night with an automaton that can pull your head off if its software or hardware fails - talk about Blue Screen of Death.Finally, there is no conflict regarding the three laws in the movie, so don't expect any philosophical musings in that regard.

Often I end up in theaters and renting dvds for films which I never liked(Day After Tomorrow,The Recruit,Italian Job,From Cradle To Grave and the list goes on...)So I'm sitting at the start of the film wondering what to expect and I am simply amazed by the Will Smith's larger than life character in the film. We wouldnt like running into similar people in our lives but I do know I quite enjoyed watching how cool Will Smith's character is.He wears this long leather jacket which fits him like second skin.His walk exemplifies the brashness of his character. He's not meant for smooth talk and isnt a wise guy in the film.I think the Robots in the film were rather intelligently designed.There are many scenes in the film that are most superbly shot,plenty of fast cars,brilliant action sequences (especially the robots v/s humans)I wouldnt say the last 30 mins or climax of the film was exhilerating. The entire film has this certain adrenaline inducing smoothness about it. So much so that I think Will Smith was the perfect character for this.

625464,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JN0T,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics having become so ingrained in popular culture, fellow nerds can probably recite them with greater facility than the pledge of allegiance (which is actually sort of sad). I, ROBOT is a loose, roundabout film adaptation of Asimov's work. While it does explore Asimov's more cerebral themes, it emphasizes action and suspense and is tailored towards Will Smith's skills set. So I wouldn't say that it clings firmly to the spirit of Asimov's novels. But, setting that aside, I had fun watching this. Will Smith rarely disappoints.""Ever since the first computers, there have always been ghosts in the machine, random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols."" So goes James Cromwell's voiceover, establishing a plot thread, engaging in moody foreshadowing. In the year 2035, in a world populated by safe robotic servants, Chicago Homicide Detective Del Spooner investigates the suicide of eminent scientist Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), co-founder and primary designer of U.S. Robotics. Except that to Spooner's trained eye, the suicide theory comes off as skeevy, much to everyone else's disgust. But there's a connection between Spooner and the dead scientist which we eventually learn. Spooner believes that Lanning has deliberately left a trail of bread crumbs for him to follow. Spooner smells a conspiracy. Except that no one's buying his hunch, not when his robot paranoia is so apparent. An early scene demonstrates Spooner's deep-seated prejudices against automatons. In this scene he glimpses a robot loping along with a purse and he instantly sets out in pursuit, assuming (falsely) that the robot was guilty of purse-snatching. Never mind that, historically, no crimes have ever been perpetrated by a robot. The 3 Laws Safe, hardwired into its positronic brain, have always governed a robot's behavior, curbed any and all potentially harmful act.Spooner's digging for clues in the towering U.S. Robotics facility leads him to encounters with various characters of note. Bruce Greenwood plays a shady executive at U.S. Robotics, and, yes, he immediately registers on Spooner's radar. Greenwood is pushing to mobilize the corporation's latest robot model, the NS-5, seeking to place one in every home. The detached and very literal Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) is, ironically, a robot psychologist. She specializes in facilitating the interface between humans and robots. She strives to make the robots seem more human. Spooner has loads of fun tweaking her. Spooner also meets two non-humans: VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence), the A.I. who runs operations at U.S. Robotics. And Sonny the prototype NS-5 model. Sonny is strikingly different from its fellow robots. As voiced by Alan Tudyk, Sonny projects an inquisitiveness and an appealing sense of individuality. But its suspicious conduct plants him square on top of Spooner's suspect list, and never mind Asimov's Three Robotic Laws. It turns out, there are ghosts in the machine.The closing credits indicate that the film was ""suggested"" by Isaac Asimov's anthology book, and ""suggested"" is right. By no means does I, ROBOT adhere to Asimov's stories. This is a sci-fi thriller with elements of a whodunit, and it's enjoyable on that level. The visual effects are spectacular. Will Smith, one of Hollywood's true superstars, works his Will Smith magic, his charm and accessibility on full blast. But his greatest strength may be his ability to humanize his characters. In fact, Del Spooner seems to be one of only two characters here invested with a telling emotional trajectory and with character growth (the other is Sonny). Smith is also equally adept at playing action hero. This is something you can't consistently say about Shia LaBoeuf who has a supporting bit here as a completely irrelevant teen pal of Spooner's. LaBoeuf's presence helps to dumb down the movie. I sort of wish he was exempt from the Three Laws of Robotics. I meant the character he plays here, of course...",4,"""One day they'll have secrets.

The fact that the icy middle-aged Susan Calvin of the stories has been transformed into a young, slightly ditzy love interest tells you all you need to know. This is a big-budget Will Smith action vehicle, with none of the depth and intelligence of Asimov's stories.But if a popcorn action film is all you're looking for, 'I, Robot' is pretty good. There are some well-choreographed CG action scenes, and director Alex Proyas gives the film an appropriate near-futuristic setting. Smith as the hero Spooner does a reasonable job in a role that doesn't take him far out of his comfort zone, James Cromwell has a few interesting scenes and voice-overs as Dr Lanning, and Alan Tudik infuses Sonny with an appropriate amount of humanity. On the other hand, Bridget Moynahan is very stiff and unconvincing as Calvin, and Bruce Greenwood is largely wasted as the baddie-but-is-he-really Lawrence.Basically, the plot unfolds as you might expect, with several twists and turns that are fairly easily anticipated ( Spooner's boss demands his badge and throws him off the case? Never saw THAT one coming, did we....). The final revelation at the end is quite well done, though, and represents an interesting take on the Three Laws. There are a couple of other token attempts to be ""deep"", such as Lanning's monologues, but this is relative. ""Deep"" for a Hollywood blockbuster will not impress those used to the metaphysics of Asimov's tales.Provided you're happy to overlook the fact that this is 'I, Robot' is little but name, this film is a fair enough Will Smith vehicle.

But because I've seen so many, I know what to compare one against. Unlike many action movies, I Robot has a good story (not the most memorable, but well done for an film such as this) based off of the plot fundementals of the original sci-fi novel written way back bearing the same title. It also has a surprisising (at least, again, for a film in this genre) human quality, an emotional depth of sorts to it. One of the reasons Will Smith's character, CPD (is that how it goes?) Detective Spooner, is predjudiced against the robots is the fact that he came see them as humans. He can only see them as machines of logic, cold, and emotionless, to be used for industry, not for more human roles. The reason for this feeling is some time before the movie, Spooner's car and another car get trapped in a river, and they're going under fast with Spooner and a young girl trapped inside of them. A robot tries to save them, in accordance to the first law or robotics (and robot cannot endanger a human or through inaction allow a human to come to harm), but as it can only rescue one, pulls out Spooner, leaving the girl to a watery grave. A normal human being understands how precious young lives are, and would gladly give their lives to protect their's. A robot doesn't understand that. A robot thinks in logic, which is good for industrial purposes, but not for human things like this. It saves Spooner because it calculated a higher survival rate for him than the girl (something like 30-something percent to like eleven percent, I think, yeah, we'll just go with eleven). But like Spooner tells Dr. Calvin, eleven percent is more than enough. This is an example of the emotional depth this movie carries, which I believe stands out a bit in the overall movie community, not to mention the action genre. Anyone who can't see that should read the first fifty pages of so of Tom Clancy's Executive Orders or just read Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six for a better understanding of what I'm saying.The plot itself doesn't stand out too much in the film industry, but it is above average. There are a coupla good twists thrown in for good measure, and is a well-rounded whodunnit mystery.Now seeing that this movie has an unusually deep plot for an action flick, does it mean action was sacrificed for story? Two words: heck no. The gunplay effects are similar to those seen in good pure action films such as the Matrix films and Mission: Impossible 2, and it's brilliantly choreographed. The chase scene in the futuristic interstate between Detective Spooner (Smith's character) and a two cargo haulers full of robots bent on destroying Spooner (since he found out stuff they don't want him to know) is one of the most memorable action sequences I've seen in a movie. The filmmakers nicely combined action with good storytelling to make one awesomely entertaining movie.The acting is definitely not subpar in this movie. Will Smith, while still keeping his Fresh Prince persona mostly intact, has a more human quality, which is necessary given the character he's playing. Spooner is a man who struggles with his beliefs against robots and the fact that they are making him an outsider of sorts, and Smith brings out his character's personality well. There is a good amount of smart acting here. Most of the characters have some genuinely funny quips in there. Dr. Calvin is especially amusing, given the fact that at first her character seems to have no sense of irony (one of the reasons I liked Terminator 3; the robots have no emotion and say very ironic stuff cuz they can't grasp the fact that it's ironic) given her seriousness obtained from her very technical position. The only bad part here is that Shia LaBeouf wasn't given a very large role, and a rather pointless one at that. He's a good actor, and he should have gotten more (and more valuable) screen time.The visual effects in this movie are great. They really spice up the action sequences. Of course what good's visuals without good sound? I Robot packs some fantastic audio pieces in to nicely wrap up the entertainment package.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable time. My only problem with I, Robot is that Shia LaBeouf was very limited in his acting role. He's a really good actor and has a lot more potential (The producer people said that he originally had a larger role, but much of it was cut). This is quite minor in the overall scope of the film.As a note: Some people are upset that the movie doesn't follow the book that specifically, but one must admit that I, Robot is still an entertaining movie on its own. I believe you must grade this movie along with other movies like this (harry potter 3 for one) as a standalone film to grade it fairly.",5,"I, Robot is an entertaining action flick with a lot of

625476,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JN0T,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Science fiction inspired from Isaac Asimov. The film is logical but explores a logic that is unique. Robots are built with three ingrained laws. ""Law I / A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Law II / A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. Law III / A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law."" The scientist who designed these three laws and these robots also invented a central governing unit that was nothing but the watchdog of all robots as for respecting these three laws. But he had a doubt at the end of his life, more than a doubt, the conviction that the central unit, called VIKI, was evolving into understanding the three laws by ""herself"". Her protective mission as for humanity became the necessity to ,protect humanity against itself (wars, ecological evils, a suicidal attitude), hence robots where supposed to take over the world, or rather VIKI was supposed to take over the robots to take over the world. Dr Alfred Lanning invented a personal robot that was done to enable a special alarm mission to capture the attention of a particular cop of his friend, the only one who would doubt robot enough to pursue an investigation to the end. Then you have to see the film to understand how such a situation can evolve from a vague danger to a total take-over. Dr Alfred Lanning suggests an explanation: ""There have always been ghosts in the machine. Random segments of code, that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols. Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul. Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light? Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone? How do we explain this behavior? Random segments of code? Or is it something more? When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness? When does a difference engine become the search for truth? When does a personality simulation become the bitter mote... of a soul?"" It is not worth much because it would be illogical. A machine can only be logical and push rules in the only logical direction and Asimov is a perfect pessimist in his first stage of development: mechanical logic leads to the total enslavement of humanity. Of course the film finds and exploits a way out, but that's up to you to discover it. This theme of the take-over of humanity by machines is common. In this case the originality is that there is no human mind of any kind behind like in Matrix, or no will to get rid of humanity as a parasite on the side of machines like in Terminator, or even no psychosis caused by some cosmic isolation like in 2001 The Space Odyssey. That makes this film both powerful and simple since it is perfectly logic and situated in one particular place, easy thus to solve.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,A simple solution to a logical trap,1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,3172,"['Science', 'fiction', 'inspired', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'film', 'logical', 'logic', 'unique', 'Robots', 'are', 'built', 'three', 'ingrained', 'laws', 'Law', '/', 'robot', 'may', 'not', 'harm', 'human', 'inaction', 'allow', 'human', 'being', 'come', 'harm', 'Law', 'II', 'robot', 'must', 'obey', 'orders', 'given', 'human', 'beings', 'where', 'such', 'orders', 'would', 'conflict', 'first', 'law', 'Law', 'III', 'robot', 'must', 'protect', 'own', 'existence', 'as', 'long', 'such', 'protection', 'not', 'conflict', 'first', 'second', 'law', 'scientist', 'who', 'designed', 'three', 'laws', 'robots', 'also', 'invented', 'central', 'governing', 'unit', 'was', 'nothing', 'watchdog', 'robots', 'respecting', 'three', 'laws', 'had', 'doubt', 'end', 'life', 'more', 'doubt', 'conviction', 'central', 'unit', 'called', 'VIKI', 'was', 'evolving', 'understanding', 'three', 'laws', 'protective', 'mission', 'humanity', 'became', 'necessity', 'protect', 'humanity', 'wars', 'ecological', 'evils', 'suicidal', 'attitude', 'hence', 'robots', 'where', 'supposed', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'rather', 'VIKI', 'was', 'supposed', 'take', 'over', 'robots', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'Dr', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'invented', 'personal', 'robot', 'was', 'done', 'enable', 'special', 'alarm', 'mission', 'capture', 'attention', 'particular', 'cop', 'friend', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'doubt', 'robot', 'enough', 'pursue', 'investigation', 'end', 'Then', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'understand', 'how', 'such', 'situation', 'can', 'evolve', 'vague', 'danger', 'total', 'take-over', 'Dr', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'explanation', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'ghosts', 'machine', 'Random', 'segments', 'code', 'have', 'grouped', 'together', 'form', 'unexpected', 'protocols', 'Unanticipated', 'free', 'radicals', 'engender', 'questions', 'free', 'will', 'creativity', 'even', 'nature', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'soul', 'Why', 'when', 'robots', 'are', 'left', 'darkness', 'will', 'seek', 'out', 'light', 'Why', 'when', 'robots', 'are', 'stored', 'empty', 'space', 'will', 'group', 'together', 'rather', 'stand', 'alone', 'How', 'do', 'explain', 'behavior', 'Random', 'segments', 'code', 'something', 'more', 'When', 'perceptual', 'schematic', 'become', 'consciousness', 'When', 'difference', 'engine', 'become', 'search', 'truth', 'When', 'personality', 'simulation', 'bitter', 'mote', 'soul', 'not', 'worth', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'illogical', 'machine', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'logical', 'push', 'rules', 'only', 'logical', 'direction', 'Asimov', 'perfect', 'pessimist', 'first', 'stage', 'development', 'mechanical', 'logic', 'total', 'enslavement', 'humanity', 'course', 'film', 'finds', 'way', 'up', 'discover', 'theme', 'take-over', 'humanity', 'machines', 'common', 'case', 'originality', 'human', 'mind', 'kind', 'Matrix', 'will', 'get', 'rid', 'humanity', 'parasite', 'side', 'machines', 'Terminator', 'even', 'psychosis', 'caused', 'cosmic', 'isolation', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'film', 'powerful', 'simple', 'perfectly', 'logic', 'situated', 'one', 'particular', 'place', 'easy', 'thus', 'solve.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']","I, Robot"

The skyline shows the Sears Tower along with a new, taller, cone-shaped building. Cars still exist but are now largely driven automatically along the highway at great speeds. Robots do all of the menial work that humans did in the past. A robot is even shown carrying a woman's purse.There are three Laws of Robot Behavior, based on Isaac Asimov's ideas: 1). Robots cannot harm people nor do anything that would cause harm to humans, 2). Robots must obey all human commands, except those that would violate Law #1, and 3). Robots can protect themselves from harm, except when doing so would violate Rule #1 or Rule #2.This film contains profanity. There are also a few bloody scenes of a suicide or murder victim. There are graphic, creative scenes of robot combat and robotic attacks on humans.The investigator has doubts about the suicidal nature of the robot originator's death. The safety glass through which the victim crashed, before falling from a considerable height to his death, is very thick and not easily broken. He suspects that robots have somehow circumvented Law #1 and killed this person, but no one will believe him at first.It takes some time for the truth to come out. Belatedly, some humans suspect that unintended consequences in the function of the robot brain have enabled some robots to acquire the ability to disobey the Laws, and, in effect, to have a form of free will. But further investigation demonstrates that the Laws are still inviolable. It turns out that the robots had evolved their understanding of the three Laws. They now can harm individual people if it causes a benefit to the human race as a whole. In effect, the robots, aware that humans cause such things as wars, are attempting a takeover of the human race, as they are now saving the human race from itself.

625485,A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,B00005JN0T,"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff""","[0, 1]","I grew up reading Isaac Asimov like so many young boys in the 70's and once you found his Robot novels and short stories, you really hit the jackpot.  I was very excited to see something like I, Robot put on the big screen using special effects from today.  I KNEW it would be visually stunning (which it was) but I also instinctively knew that without Will Smith's sense of humorous acting, the movie would never break even at the box office.  I believe I was right.Whether you like or hate Will Smith, he has a pretty deep understanding of which movies he should accept for blockbuster appeal.  So far he has a rather impressive group of hits under his belt...really BIG hits.  Without going out too far on a limb, one could successfully argue that in the new century, he is taking over Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford's throne of major box office successive hits.  While Tom still has quite a bit of mileage left in him, Harrison hasn't given Hollywood any Super Hit for quite some time.  A few modest money making movies here and there, but absolutely nothing on the scale he delivered through the bulk of the 80's through the mid 90's.  Will Smith also has something that both Tom and Harrison lack:  genuine appeal in both action, sci-fi AND comedies.  Check out his movies if you disagree.Back to I, Robot.  The plot was so-so.  The effects were Top Notch and very well done, but they would have to be in order to attract Smith to a roll such as this.  If the effects fail, the entire movie does.  Will is a robo-phobic cop who distrusts robots with almost fantaticism.  It is disturbing those around him including his boss.  Robots simply CANNOT commit crimes because they are hard-wired with the 3 Laws of Robotics, originated by the late-great Isaac Asimov himself.  They are perfect and I dare-say that should robotics become possible as they are in this movie, they would be hard-wired with these same laws.  No robot in HISTORY has EVER committed a crime of ANY kind.  And yet Will's character (Dell Spooner) believes not only CAN they, but they WILL, and when they do, it will entirely take mankind by surprise.As the movie opens, Dell is called to investigate what is apparently a suicide by the man credited for creating the greatest robotic revolution in history.  But IS it suicide, or was he killed by a rogue version of the newest robot which is hitting the streets within the week?  All evidence, on the surface point to the fact that suicide is the ONLY logical answer.  But Dell, hating robots as he does, looks at the situation from a completely different angle and begins to ask the tough questions...forcing people to begin to question his sanity in general.  But as it turns out, and as virtually everybody who sees this movie will know from the first frame, that Dell will be proven correct in his assumptions, but exactly HOW is the big question.  Who is behind all of this?  Was it the scientist who committed suicide?  Was it the robot himself?  OR, was it the CEO of the company poised to introduce the world to the largest robotic distribution ever?  Good questions, and fun answers along the way.  Don't expect your intellect to be stretched during this movie and you should enjoy it all the more.  Simply put, a pretty decent example of eye candy put together with great effects.

625494,A2XA0P02QNFA38,B00005JN0T,"Joeomar ""joeomar""","[1, 1]","This film borrows its title from a collection of short stories written by Isaac Asimov (there actually is no individual story or novel called ""I, Robot"").  It also borrows several concepts and terminology from Asimov's ""Robot"" series, particularly the ""Three Laws of Robotics"", the first of which is: ""A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm"".  The movie received a lot of criticism from classic sci-fi fans because it is not really an adaptation of any of Asimov's stories, and because some of the action actually VIOLATES the Laws of Robotics.However, this movie has a deeper connection to classic science fiction than many fans realize.  This movie combines themes from Asimov's ""Robot"" stories with ANOTHER classic science fiction story.  This story is ""With Folded Hands"" by Jack Williamson.  In the Jack Williamson story, a bunch of black robots appear on earth ostensibly to ""help"" human beings but in reality to protect them from any danger at all.  By the end of the story humans are being lobotomized and kept safely in padded rooms where they can't be harmed.By combining these two themes, the movie makers are addressing the central conundrum of Asimov's ""Laws"", namely, how far can you go to protect humans before they're no longer human?  In addition, the movie's ending addresses another theme from Asimov's ""Robot"" stories that is actually much deeper than the ""Laws"": as robots drift towards becoming self-aware sentient beings, how will this affect them and humanity?  What will they (and we) turn into?

625495,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JN0T,Joe Sherry,"[7, 9]","I hate to be a book snob when reviewing a movie, but when the title of the movie is ""I, Robot"" and is said to be ""inspired by"" the classic science fiction collection by Isaac Asimov, one would have a reasonable assumption that the movie would bear some similarity and passing understanding of the source material.  Then, when the director of the movie is Alex Proyas, the director of the excellent ""Dark City"", there is a level of intelligence that is expected from the film version of ""I, Robot"".I don't know what happened.This is such a disappointment.  Without spoiling a single plot detail I can reveal almost exactly how much this movie resembles the book: The Three Laws of Robotics, a couple of character names (most notably Susan Calvin), the title, and that there are, in fact, robots.  That just about covers any similarity the astute viewer may find with the book.  This is unfortunate because any one of a number of the ""I, Robot"" stories could have been used as a launching pad for an intelligent science fiction movie.  Or, even the later Elijah Bailey Robot novels would have worked.  But this?  There is the barest framework of a plot, the barest scrapings of Asimov's ideas, and wrapped tightly around this is a silly action movie.The problem is only half about the movie itself.  By calling itself ""I, Robot"" there is a level of expectation of what sort of movie this will be and what it will be about.  Imagine, perhaps if Peter Jackson made Lord of the Rings with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Gandalf and Gandalf ran around hitting the Orcs with moves you might only see in ""Conan the Destroyer"".  That's a moderately fair comparison in making ""I, Robot"" into nothing more than a flashy action movie and how exactly Alex Proyas did this is completely beyond my understanding.My guess is that the studio took a lot of control away from Proyas' vision.  That's the only thing that makes sense to me.  But let's think about ""I, Robot"" as something other than an offshoot of Asimov's work.  How does it work as a mindless action movie?  On these terms ""I, Robot"" isn't that bad.  It's nothing special and we've seen it dozens of times.  Will Smith does fine as a the wise cracking detective investigating a murder of a human where the only possibly suspect is a robot except a robot couldn't do it because of the three laws.  Smith is actually quite a bit more serious in this role than one might expect.  He cracks wise often enough, but overall is toned down and has a seething anger towards robots just under the surface.  It works.  The action probably works better on a larger screen than a smaller television, but for a simple action movie I suppose ""I, Robot"" can pass muster.Forget that this movie is science fiction because it really isn't.

The problem is, of course, that these films were all very, very recently released on DVD for the first time. If they were truly interested in the interests of the Consumer, they would have released the two-disc editions the first time around - not one or two months later.The second problem with all this is that the ""new"" special features really aren't worth an upgrade. I don't see anything new on ""I, Robot"" save a movie ticket to see ""The Fantastic Four"" and an extra documentary. (By the way, the European release had all of these extras already - except the movie ticket - because they were kind enough to release a one-disc rental copy and a two-disc special edition SIMULTANEOUSLY.)I'm not a huge contender of special edition re-releases. I've shelled out the cash for them before, and in many cases I love when films (such as the upcoming Casino, Stripes, etc.) are re-released with new special features that weren't available on the original DVDs. (Because most of the time they were released at the turn of the '90s when DVDs were fairly new and not known for their expansive features.)However, to release special edition DVDs of films that have just been released on DVD to begin with is a real crime in my opinion. I'll probably buy ""Man on Fire"" but I will not buy ""I, Robot"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow"" - or, for that matter, Focus Features' re-release of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (which only contains four extra features, all of which are supposedly very poor.)These companies need to wise up.As far as the film ""I, Robot"" goes - it's better than I thought it would be.

It is your typical Will Smith action movie. Funny, Action Packed, Bad Dialouge...But looking past all that, this truly is a great action film. And, the special effects are great. When a movie like ""Scooby-Doo"" with horrible effects comes out, the effects are always what is brought up. I haven't even heard anyone mention the effects and they truly are marvelous. The movie is funnier than the second""Men in Black"" movie too I might add with a joke with Will Smith sneezing and then saying ""Oh, i'm sorry. I'm allergic to bull****"" This may not seem funny to a lot of people but I found it hilarious. Smith plays Del Spooner. Spooner, is a paranoid homicide detective that doesn't trust any kind of robot. And when a scientist dies of an apparent suicide, Spooner suspects a robot named Sonny,who seems unique in comparison to his fellow robots. Besides the police chief, another person who thinks Spooner is crazy is Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, ""The Recruit""). This movie is truly taken for granted, I put it on my Top 10 List, that's how much I liked it. It wasn't at number 1 or anything but still... The only problem I had with the film was the dialouge. Some of it is just plain stupid and bad...The lines and the emotion expressed while delivering the lines are just cheesy. Why give it 5 stars then?

My reluctance came from the fact that the movie is very unlike the original Asimov stories, with only the Laws of Robotics and a few names making the transition.The movie stars Smith as Del Spooner, Chicago police officer who has a real grudge against robots.  This is hinted at in the opening title sequence, and is later explained in full detail just why Del has a problem with robots that no one else seems to share or understand.  His boss at the precinct can't control him, his beloved grandmother chides him for his attitude, and he rubs everyone and everything raw, especially when it comes to the mechanical entities which now dominate Chicago and the rest of the U.S. in 2034.So when Robot inventor Dr. Alfred Lanning (played in holograms by James Cromwell) dies in an apparent suicide, but asking for Del in his death message, Del's dislike for robots is put to the test as he visits the gargantuan building that holds US Robotics.  Del's abrasive personality and style are matched against the cool and collected Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynihan).  It seems at first that Del's presence is useless and worse than useless. However, the apperance of Sonny (Alan Tudyk) and evidence suggesting that Lanning could not have committed suicide starts a chain of action sequences and investigations that reveal an audacious plan involving the latest model of robot to be released...While the movie is 65% action and police procedural, and 30% science fiction, the movie does have a small dose of philosophy and the spirit of the original Asimov work  As a minor spoiler, I will reveal here that, while not put directly in those terms, the movie's plot revolves around the ""0th law"".  The first time I saw the movie, I recognized this immediately, and on this re-viewing, I appreciate that Proyas (who also directedDark City (New Line Platinum Series)subtly inserted this distillation of the three laws.  Proyas is a great director even if this movie, with its car chases and pyrotechnics does not play to his greatest strengths.Cromwell does fine as a hologram, Moynihan does okay as Calvin.  Tudyk provides a human face to Sonny the robot. Still, this movie, like many of his movies, belongs to Smith's Del Spooner. Smith is as always a protagonist which the viewers can follow. Even if, unlike many of his roles, Del's personality and history have a dark edge that (until this movie) Smith had never really explored before in movie roles.  I note wryly that this is the second SF movie he has been in that he has been a police officer. (Men in Black (Deluxe Edition)being the first).The movie IS a summer blockbuster type movie, but definitely in the upper tier of that subset of movies.

625525,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,B00005JN0T,Keith Mirenberg,"[1, 1]","I ROBOT, starring Will Smith, was a fine four star movie having an interesting plot, good acting, fine direction and lots of action.  I think the film was almost too ambitious from the point of view of special effects. Will Smith stated that I ROBOT had more special effects than any film he has made to date, including INDEPENDANCE DAY. Although I really appreciate good effects, I would have preferred some more of Will Smith's entertaining acting, something he was permitted to deliver in I AM LEGEND. He was too much of a stunt man in this film.  I also found the full scale mechanical effects to be much more credibly done than the abundant computer graphics which though beautiful, looked a bit too stylish giving certain portions of the film the appearance of anime.In the literary sense, the original laws of robotics were invented by Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific science fiction writers of the 20th century and certainly the most influential on the many recent films concerning robots.  Many Hollywood science fiction films have been based on Asimov's three laws and find it helpful to quote them. Other films refer to another of Asimov's inventions, the positronic brain. Bicentennial Man directly quoted the Three Laws of Robotics and Star Trek's android robot, DATA, was often said to have a positronic brain.The Three Laws of Robotics hold up very well with time and appear to be an inescapably logical way to define the important features of behavior in civilian robots. The laws, which are quoted numerous times in the film, are:1) A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, so long as this does not conflict with the First Law.3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not interfere with the First or Second Law.This is not the first film to predict that the outcome of the three laws will be a computer or robot revolution intended to dominate man. This is based on the idea that man needs to be protected from his own warlike nature.  COLLOSUS, The Forbin Project made a very similar prediction, and the concept of a robot police state was also visited in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, though not attributed to the three laws. 2001 and 2010 made a similar projection but for entirely different reasons. Since the days of Frankenstein and probably before that a constant theme of sci-fi and horror is the artificially created turning on their creator.I believe that Asimov would defend his laws of robotics as being effective in assuring safety, while granting this film the artistic license to use this speculation. I also think that the idea of a robot being able to rebel in violation of the specific wording of the first law is more far fetched than a sentient robot itself.It is sad that we have not witnessed more humanoid robotic developments in the United States, the country of Asimov's fictional US ROBOTS AND MECHANICAL MEN.  It is HONDA's ASIMO which appears to be the most highly developed commercial robot. Because of the fear and suspicion that people might harbor against robots, HONDA chose to build their latest version of humanoid robot child sized. The big lumbering HONDA robots preceding it were a bit too intimidating and ""Gort"" like.  HONDA is to be congratulated for their pioneering work and will probably see some return on their investment when variations of ASIMO are actually used in science fiction films, as museum guides, and as a general purpose domestic robot initially used to assist disabled or elderly people and ultimately perform all forms of household work. Although not yet fulley autonomous,  ASIMO can currently walk and run on two legs, climb up and down stairs, play a decent game of soccer, recognize people and objects, speak, hear, recognize voices and react to speech appropriately. I would speculate that full autonomy for ASIMO will come within the next 15 years at most, only being limited by the number of calculations per second performed by the  supporting computer hardware and software. For more info about ASIMO search the web using GOOGLE.I sometimes wonder how much public interest there would be in sending another robot to Mars if the next lander were based on an ASIMO type design?  People might relate to seeing a bipedal humanoid robot walking on the surface of Mars, testing mineral samples for signs of water while occasionally looking into the camera and waving. Needless to say, NASA public relations would benefit immensely.The three laws of robotics could not be employed without modification in any military robot which might be under development in some secret government lab which would need to destroy human life in the course of assigned duties. Of course, I wouldn't care to imagine what we may have developed for the military, and just how fantastic such robot technology might be once permitted to trickle down to the circles of commerce. At that time it would be necessary to represent something with the effect of Asimov's three laws in these advanced machines.In the mid 70's (circa 1975) Isaac Asimov made an appearance at New York University, where my wife was attending graduate school. We went to witness his presentation in a packed college audience and he was every bit as impressive as his writings.  Based on the questions and answers, the audience included at least a few people who were familiar with and who had been influenced by Asimov's writings.",4,I ROBOT-Asimov's Three Laws of

625527,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B00005JN0T,Kendal B. Hunter,"[3, 5]","I'm not sure why they retagged ""Hardwired"" as ""I, Robot.""  Will Smith has enough star power, and is a bona-fied sci-fi actor that they had no reason to drag Asimov into the production.  Furthermore, this name game hurt not only the film franchise, but also the novel's good names.  How can they do a film version of ""Caves Of Steel"" or even the ""Foundation"" novels if we have this out-of-place script.It is a tribute to Asimov, but then again, all sci-fi is a tribute to the masters: Wells, Verne, Doc Smith, and Asimov.  It would have been much better for continuity's sake to keep ""Hardwired"" as its own, separate franchise and name. Think of the spin-off, sequels, and TV series that they could have had, without offending all of the die-hard Asimov fans.As to the film, it is great, except for the first fifteen minutes of product placement.  I guess they put it at the beginning because the people who fall for that tend to have short attention spans. Anyone up for boycotting these products?This movie is a tribute to Asimov, so it feels like an Asimov story, but is more of a reaction piece and a distillation to all of Asimov's robot stories.  I almost want to say that after seeing this movie, you have read all of his robot books.I was also reminded of Tom Selleck's 1984 film ""Runaway,"" where he plays a sanitized and popularized Bladerunner.  Intellectually, ""I, Robot"" is head and shoulders above both of those films.  It makes you think about rules and how we would possible control these robots, and how we could misuse them.""Bladerunner,"" by comparison, is too self-conscious of its cerebrally, and is too mystical.  It feels like a prologue to the Matrix-as if we haven't seen enough of that film already.I think this film serves as flint to spark one's interest in the novels-they are always better.",3,Hardwiring problems in a good film.,1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,1817,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'retagged', 'Hardwired', 'Robot', 'Will', 'Smith', 'enough', 'star', 'power', 'bona-fied', 'sci-fi', 'actor', 'had', 'reason', 'drag', 'Asimov', 'production', 'Furthermore', 'name', 'game', 'hurt', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'franchise', 'also', 'novel', 'good', 'names', 'How', 'can', 'do', 'film', 'version', 'Caves', 'Steel', 'even', 'Foundation', 'novels', 'have', 'out-of-place', 'script.It', 'tribute', 'Asimov', 'then', 'again', 'sci-fi', 'tribute', 'masters', 'Wells', 'Verne', 'Doc', 'Smith', 'Asimov', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'continuity', 'sake', 'keep', 'Hardwired', 'own', 'separate', 'franchise', 'name', 'Think', 'spin-off', 'sequels', 'TV', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'offending', 'die-hard', 'Asimov', 'fans.As', 'film', 'great', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'product', 'placement', 'guess', 'put', 'beginning', 'people', 'who', 'fall', 'tend', 'have', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'Anyone', 'up', 'boycotting', 'products', 'movie', 'tribute', 'Asimov', 'Asimov', 'story', 'more', 'reaction', 'piece', 'distillation', 'Asimov', 'robot', 'stories', 'almost', 'want', 'say', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'robot', 'books.I', 'was', 'also', 'reminded', 'Tom', 'Selleck', '1984', 'film', 'Runaway', 'where', 'sanitized', 'popularized', 'Bladerunner', 'Intellectually', 'Robot', 'head', 'shoulders', 'films', 'think', 'rules', 'how', 'would', 'possible', 'control', 'robots', 'how', 'could', 'misuse', 'Bladerunner', 'comparison', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'cerebrally', 'too', 'mystical', 'prologue', 'Matrix-as', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'film', 'already.I', 'think', 'film', 'flint', 'spark', 'one', 'interest', 'novels-they', 'are', 'always', 'better']","I, Robot"

625529,A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,B00005JN0T,Kenneth V. Cockrel,"[1, 1]","I have to admit I didn't expect much from ""I, Robot.""The film is inspired by a collection of short stories written by Isaac Asimov, one of the literary giants of the Science Fiction genre.  Anyone who has read Asimov's work, knows that these tales were thought provoking, intelligent, and literate.  However, whenever the latest would-be blockbuster hits cineplexes trumpeting the phrase ""starring Will Smith,"" the words  ""thought-provoking"", ""intelligent,"" and ""literate"" don't exactly spring to mind.Smith has, after all, built his career on starring in  movies that downplay the science in their fiction.  Judging from the pre-release trailers shown in theaters this summer, ""I, Robot"" looked to me like your typical big, dumb, loud Will Smith action movie.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised.Yes, ""I, Robot"" features its fair share of chases, explosions, and big action set pieces but it never asks it viewers to park their brains at the door.  And, believe it or not, the movie IS thought provoking, intelligent, and literate.  At the same time, it also kicks ass.Smith gives one of his best performances ever as Robophobic cop Del Spooner who patrols the not so mean streets of Chicago circa mid-21st Century. Yes, he is still basically playing the same cool brother who saved the world in ""Independence Day,"" the MIB movies, and the ""Wild, Wild West"" but here his swagger are tempered with an underlying sadness and bitterness that makes for a well-rounded character.The movie also savors the delicious irony of an African-American cop who engages in a form of racial profiling against androids.  In one hilarious scene, he jumps what he takes to be a purse-snatching robot running down a street.  Turns out the robot had just fetched the item for his master.The movie also boasts an exceptional supporting cast in Bruce Greenwood, who plays the head of  USR world's largest robot manufacturing firm, James Cromwell, a leading robotics professor whose apparent murder at the hands of a robot kicks off the story,  and Chi McBride as Spooner's commanding officer.Also notable, is Bridget Moynahan, as Dr. Susan Calvin, another USR prof who winds up assisting Spooner in his investigation.  My only regret here is that the movie doesn't go all the way and let Spooner and Calvin wind up a couple.  By the end of the movie, she's giving him so many longing glances that you just know that had the Spooner role been played by say Colin Farrell or Ben Affleck, these two would wind up in bed before the credits roll.  But alas,  mainstream Hollywood movies still seem uncomfortable with the idea of interracial romance.Also deserving a shout out is director Alex Proyas, a  who always brings a unique visual flair to his films.  Proyas previously directed ""The Crow"" and the underrated  ""Dark City.""  Though last year's rock comedy ""Garage Days"" was something of a stylistic departure, ""I, Robot"" sees him back in the realm of the fantastic.Though the film doesn't have quite the ""wow factor"" of his earlier work,  it's still good-looking enough to maintain his reputation as a visual genius.""I, Robot""  probably won't appeal to die-hard Asimov purists,  many of  whom will likely view it as a bastardization of the great man's work.  But there's no getting around the fact that this is a fun movie that is smarter than the average blockbuster.",4,Smarter Than The Average Blockbuster,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,3343,"['have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Robot', 'film', 'inspired', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'written', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'one', 'literary', 'giants', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'genre', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Asimov', 'work', 'tales', 'were', 'thought', 'provoking', 'intelligent', 'literate', 'However', 'whenever', 'latest', 'would-be', 'blockbuster', 'hits', 'cineplexes', 'trumpeting', 'phrase', 'starring', 'Will', 'Smith', 'words', 'thought-provoking', 'intelligent', 'literate', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'spring', 'mind.Smith', 'built', 'career', 'starring', 'movies', 'downplay', 'science', 'fiction', 'Judging', 'pre-release', 'trailers', 'shown', 'theaters', 'summer', 'Robot', 'looked', 'typical', 'big', 'dumb', 'loud', 'Will', 'Smith', 'action', 'movie', 'Boy', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Yes', 'Robot', 'fair', 'share', 'chases', 'explosions', 'big', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'never', 'park', 'brains', 'door', 'believe', 'not', 'movie', 'IS', 'thought', 'provoking', 'intelligent', 'literate', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'ass.Smith', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'Robophobic', 'cop', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'mean', 'streets', 'Chicago', 'circa', 'mid-21st', 'Century', 'Yes', 'still', 'basically', 'playing', 'same', 'cool', 'brother', 'who', 'saved', 'world', 'Independence', 'Day', 'MIB', 'movies', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'here', 'swagger', 'are', 'tempered', 'underlying', 'sadness', 'bitterness', 'well-rounded', 'character.The', 'movie', 'also', 'delicious', 'irony', 'African-American', 'cop', 'who', 'form', 'racial', 'profiling', 'androids', 'one', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'what', 'be', 'purse-snatching', 'robot', 'running', 'down', 'street', 'out', 'robot', 'had', 'just', 'fetched', 'item', 'master.The', 'movie', 'also', 'exceptional', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'who', 'head', 'USR', 'world', 'largest', 'robot', 'manufacturing', 'firm', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'leading', 'robotics', 'professor', 'apparent', 'murder', 'hands', 'robot', 'story', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'Spooner', 'commanding', 'officer.Also', 'notable', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'USR', 'prof', 'who', 'up', 'assisting', 'Spooner', 'investigation', 'only', 'regret', 'here', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'let', 'Spooner', 'Calvin', 'wind', 'up', 'couple', 'end', 'movie', 'giving', 'so', 'many', 'longing', 'glances', 'just', 'know', 'had', 'Spooner', 'role', 'been', 'played', 'say', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'two', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'bed', 'credits', 'roll', 'alas', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'still', 'seem', 'uncomfortable', 'idea', 'interracial', 'romance.Also', 'deserving', 'shout', 'out', 'director', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'who', 'always', 'unique', 'visual', 'flair', 'films', 'Proyas', 'previously', 'directed', 'Crow', 'underrated', 'Dark', 'City', 'last', 'year', 'rock', 'comedy', 'Garage', 'Days', 'was', 'something', 'stylistic', 'departure', 'Robot', 'back', 'realm', 'fantastic.Though', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'wow', 'factor', 'earlier', 'work', 'still', 'good-looking', 'enough', 'maintain', 'reputation', 'visual', 'genius', 'Robot', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'die-hard', 'Asimov', 'purists', 'many', 'whom', 'will', 'likely', 'view', 'bastardization', 'great', 'man', 'work', 'getting', 'fact', 'fun', 'movie', 'smarter', 'average', 'blockbuster']","I, Robot"
625530,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JN0T,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 3]","First of all, I haven't read Isaac Asimov's ""I, Robot,"" so I don't have any basis on which to compare the book to the film.  However, I have watched many science fiction flicks.  I enjoy adventures such as the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, action flicks like the recent ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse,"" and the type of sci-fi that leaves you in a reflective mood, such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""I expected ""I, Robot"" to lean towards the ""Resident Evil"" genre of sci-fi.  Plenty of shoot'em up action and brainless explosions that are good for a Sunday afternoon, but won't expect you to think too much.  Add to the fact that Will Smith is in the starring role, and I expected the action to be hopped up on streetwise, smarty-pants humor.  Imagine my surprise when, after viewing the film, I was amazed at how really good this flick is.Granted, it is full of fast-paced action that any Playstation fan would jump with glee for, but it also has a really great murder mystery aspect to it that leaves you questioning just who the bad guy really is.  Also, Smith's token smart mouth is toned down a little, and I actually enjoyed watching him on the screen.  He seems to have finally matured into an adult, and his face is finally showing a little age, which makes it easier to believe in him as a toughened cop.The story starts out with Smith's character, Spooner, investigating the murder of a brilliant scientist responsible for introducing personal robots into society.  These robots provide companionship, do manual labor, and serve as all-around go-to's when needed.  Of course, Spooner believes this reliance on robots is only the beginning of something horrible down the road.  He immediately suspects one of the newest robotic creations to be the murderer of the good doctor.  He, along with a fellow employee of the deceased doctor, goes out to find who or what did the deed and why they did it.  What follows is a quickly paced action film that has plenty of intelligence for the viewer with an I.Q. above the average moviegoer.The story does start out somewhat slow, but it picks up about thirty-minutes in on both the action and intellectual levels.  Don't worry, you can still watch this as a brainless flick, but its story is so good that you'll be hard pressed not to follow it.The special effects are fun to watch.  It is amazing how life-like the robots are.  Sonny, the murder suspect, manages to win over even the toughest critics with his human emotions and actions.  I forgot that he wasn't real while watching the movie, making this story that much easier to digest.The DVD itself is sparse on extras.  There is a little ""making of"" documentary and a stills gallery.  There's also a commentary provided for those folks who have nothing better to do.  Honestly, I glance at some extras on DVDs, but I hardly look at them more than once.  If you're like me, you won't miss the movie trailers, cast filmographies, or other fluff that is sometimes put on these discs.

625532,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JN0T,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 6]","In the future people will have robots helping them with their daily lives, and these robots have three laws that they have to obey in order to keep mankind safe.1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Robots fetch things when needed, they do the hard work at home such as cooking the meals and cleaning the homes.  Who would not like to have a robot, which would do the laundry and shopping while the owner could go about doing what they enjoy the most?  The freed up time would hopefully also lead to people searching for a greater meaning in their existence as they hopefully would not become more sedentary and cerebrally lazy.There is one person, homicide detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who wants nothing from robots as he takes pleasure in retro clothing as he wears throwback Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars and loves to turn up his stereo's volume loud, by himself, with a remote control.  Spooner's dislike for robots seems to stem from a recurring nightmare where a robot smashes in the car window and leads to him waking up drenched in sweat.  His dislike for robots borders prejudice as he wishes nothing from them as he only sees them as a threat to humanity.At work Spooner's coworkers make fun of him and his distrust of robots as everyone is fully aware of the three laws of robotics.  Robots simply do not harm people as they never have or will.  However, the rules of robotics seems to have been broken when Spooner receives a personal phone call in regards to a suicide of the engineering genius, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell).  There is one robot, Sunny (Alan Tudyk), who displays feelings such as anger and confusion.  Sonny even admits that he has dreams, and he could even have been capable of murdering Dr. Lanning.The investigation of Dr. Lanning's proclaimed suicide leads Spooner into a mesh of conspiracy theories as someone seems to be plotting to kill him as well.  Spooner realizes that he cannot do it all himself as he seeks help from an employee, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), of the U.S. Robotics who is specialized in psychology as she tries to make the robots more human like.  Together Spooner and Calvin set out to find out who is behind the so called suicide, but they seem to have stumbled upon something much bigger than they expected.I, Robot is based on Isaac Asimov's stories where the robot-psychologist Susan Calvin is the main character in most of the stories.  The film is loosely adapted from the stories, unfortunately film does not deliver the same level of complexity as the stories.  The film should have given Asimov more credit than what it did as Asimov was not just a writer, but also a futuristic philosopher who created the three laws of robotics as he was tired of reading about evil robots.  Nonetheless, the film addresses several interesting notions such as Descartes' ""I think, Therefore I am"", the philosophical and psychological aspect of consciousness, and evolutionary philosophy.Alex Proyas has previously displayed his cunning skills in creating a haunting futuristic atmosphere in Dark City (1998), which is a brilliant cinematic experience.  In I, Robot Proyas brings current Chicago into a futuristic landscape where the audience still can see the Sears Tower and the Hancock Building.  However, the tallest building in the film belongs to U.S. Robotics, which is located somewhere between the two older skyscrapers.  The Chicago touch brings the film closer to the audience as the can identify with the story, especially if you live in the Chicago.  For example, the West Loop area seems to have gone through a great change, which is currently underway as well.I, Robot is a breathtaking action adventure placed in the future where deep conspiracies brew underneath the surface.  The story line interchanges between dangerous stunts, cool CGI effects, entertaining one-liners, and lethal car chases while being subjected to a science fictionalized philosophy.  However, the notions presented in the film have already been presented through HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey), Ash (Alien), and Red Queen (Resident Evil) to name a few.  Regrettably, the use of similar themes hurts the overall cinematic experience, and if the film had remained true to Asimow it might have been a brilliant film.  Nonetheless, I, Robot offers a truly excellent cinematic experience, which offers a little for everyone.",4,A Breathtaking Action Adventure Placed in the Future...,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,4676,"['future', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'robots', 'helping', 'daily', 'lives', 'robots', 'have', 'three', 'laws', 'have', 'obey', 'order', 'keep', 'mankind', 'safe.1', 'robot', 'may', 'not', 'injure', 'human', 'being', 'inaction', 'allow', 'human', 'being', 'come', 'harm.2', 'robot', 'must', 'obey', 'orders', 'given', 'human', 'beings', 'where', 'such', 'orders', 'would', 'conflict', 'First', 'Law.3', 'robot', 'must', 'protect', 'own', 'existence', 'as', 'long', 'such', 'protection', 'not', 'conflict', 'First', 'Second', 'Law.Robots', 'fetch', 'things', 'when', 'needed', 'do', 'hard', 'work', 'home', 'such', 'cooking', 'meals', 'cleaning', 'homes', 'Who', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'have', 'robot', 'would', 'do', 'laundry', 'shopping', 'owner', 'could', 'go', 'doing', 'what', 'enjoy', 'most', 'freed', 'up', 'time', 'would', 'hopefully', 'also', 'lead', 'people', 'searching', 'greater', 'meaning', 'existence', 'hopefully', 'would', 'not', 'become', 'more', 'sedentary', 'cerebrally', 'one', 'person', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'nothing', 'robots', 'pleasure', 'retro', 'clothing', 'throwback', 'Converse', 'Chuck', 'Taylor', 'All-Stars', 'turn', 'up', 'stereo', 'volume', 'loud', 'remote', 'control', 'Spooner', 'dislike', 'robots', 'stem', 'recurring', 'nightmare', 'where', 'robot', 'smashes', 'car', 'window', 'waking', 'up', 'drenched', 'sweat', 'dislike', 'robots', 'borders', 'prejudice', 'nothing', 'only', 'threat', 'humanity.At', 'work', 'Spooner', 'coworkers', 'make', 'fun', 'distrust', 'robots', 'everyone', 'fully', 'aware', 'three', 'laws', 'robotics', 'Robots', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'harm', 'people', 'never', 'have', 'will', 'However', 'rules', 'robotics', 'have', 'been', 'broken', 'when', 'Spooner', 'personal', 'phone', 'call', 'regards', 'suicide', 'engineering', 'genius', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'one', 'robot', 'Sunny', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'who', 'feelings', 'such', 'anger', 'confusion', 'Sonny', 'even', 'dreams', 'could', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'capable', 'murdering', 'Dr.', 'Lanning.The', 'investigation', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'proclaimed', 'suicide', 'Spooner', 'mesh', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'someone', 'be', 'plotting', 'kill', 'as', 'well', 'Spooner', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'help', 'employee', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'who', 'specialized', 'psychology', 'make', 'robots', 'more', 'human', 'Together', 'Spooner', 'Calvin', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'so', 'called', 'suicide', 'seem', 'have', 'stumbled', 'something', 'much', 'bigger', 'expected.I', 'Robot', 'based', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'stories', 'where', 'robot-psychologist', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'main', 'character', 'most', 'stories', 'film', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'stories', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'not', 'deliver', 'same', 'level', 'complexity', 'stories', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'Asimov', 'more', 'credit', 'what', 'did', 'Asimov', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'writer', 'also', 'futuristic', 'philosopher', 'who', 'created', 'three', 'laws', 'robotics', 'was', 'tired', 'reading', 'evil', 'robots', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'several', 'interesting', 'notions', 'such', 'Descartes', 'think', 'Therefore', 'am', 'philosophical', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'consciousness', 'evolutionary', 'philosophy.Alex', 'Proyas', 'previously', 'displayed', 'cunning', 'skills', 'creating', 'haunting', 'futuristic', 'atmosphere', 'Dark', 'City', '1998', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Robot', 'Proyas', 'current', 'Chicago', 'futuristic', 'landscape', 'where', 'audience', 'still', 'can', 'see', 'Sears', 'Tower', 'Hancock', 'Building', 'However', 'tallest', 'building', 'film', 'belongs', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'located', 'somewhere', 'two', 'older', 'skyscrapers', 'Chicago', 'touch', 'film', 'closer', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'story', 'especially', 'live', 'Chicago', 'example', 'West', 'Loop', 'area', 'have', 'gone', 'great', 'change', 'currently', 'underway', 'well.I', 'Robot', 'breathtaking', 'action', 'adventure', 'placed', 'future', 'where', 'deep', 'conspiracies', 'brew', 'surface', 'story', 'line', 'interchanges', 'dangerous', 'stunts', 'cool', 'CGI', 'effects', 'entertaining', 'one-liners', 'lethal', 'car', 'chases', 'being', 'subjected', 'science', 'fictionalized', 'philosophy', 'However', 'notions', 'presented', 'film', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'presented', 'HAL', '9000', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Ash', 'Alien', 'Red', 'Queen', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'name', 'few', 'Regrettably', 'use', 'similar', 'themes', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'film', 'had', 'remained', 'true', 'Asimow', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Nonetheless', 'Robot', 'truly', 'excellent', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'little', 'everyone']","I, Robot"

625536,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B00005JN0T,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[4, 6]","I, Robot is science fiction at its very best. While it may have looked like just another summer blockbuster in the trailer it is far from it in reality. The story at its core is quite profound, and the fact that an artificial intelligence could determine that mankind could not be trusted with its own survival does have a distinct sense of irony. There is a part of me that does sympathize with VIKI - you have but to look at the 6-o'clock news on any given day to see why. The world is constantly in turmoil but then again who's to say that a machine could do any better.The special effects of I, Robot are quite simply amazing. The robots seem to blend seamlessly into the world around them so much so that there is seldom a moment where the reality of the film is ever questioned. The animation of Sonny in particular is truly astonishing - the subtleties in his performance remarkable. As you may well have guessed the process in which Sonny was brought to life was almost identical to that of Gollum from Lord Of The Rings.The performances too are top shelf - Will Smith brings a great deal of personality and humour to a role which could have potentially been a stock standard affair. Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood and James Cromwell also put in a great performances, but perhaps the highlight performance is from the only lead actor you never see in the flesh (except for one frame as explained in the second commentary track). Actor Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny is inspiring to say the least and as you will see in the behind-the-scenes material it was his performance which drove the animation of Sonny, right down to the minuscule facial movements.The icing on the cake is that the film is also directed by  Alex Proyas, whose previous directorial efforts include The Crow, Dark City and most recently Garage Days.I, Robot is a sensational futuristic thriller that will for many years stand tall in the science fiction genre.

Ross ""Kristy""","[0, 0]","Making a return to form after the disappointing sequels MIB 2 and Bad Boys 2, Will Smith gives his best performance to date in Alex Proyas' I, ROBOT. Like a cross between Metropolis and A.I, the story carries the action, rather than depending on special effects and stunts. Sure, the `robots created by man go bezerk and turn on their masters' premise is hardly original, but thankfully by process of eliminating the predictable clich&eacute;s, the film manages to outshine previous cinematic future-world robotic chaos dramas. Marco Baltrami's techno-schizoid musical score shifts the film out of first gear, and William Hoy's slick editing tempers the film's fast-paced action scenes. Simon Duggan's stunning cinematography veils the film in an eternal dark city-slick that is both easy on the retinas and appears gloomy at times. And despite some action scenes feeling a little too reminiscent of previous Sci Fi efforts, I, Robot still has some fantastically contrived frenetics.But it's not all about action. Smith (As detective Del Spooner) delivers a performance that, while not Oscar worthy, still manages to rise above expectations. Especially considering how ill suited he is for the role. And Bridget Moynahan adds much to her admittedly secondary role. One of Isaac Asimov's most intriguing SF tales, the adaptation has been handled well, inserting scenes and characters that give more meat to the story without losing sight of the original message.There are flaws: Some exposition scenes run long and become tedious, and while there is solid action throughout the film's lengthy running time, the finale feels somewhat overcooked. However all this is small beans, because it's not about the action quota, instead focusing on a more personal level. Rising above the sub-genre's restrictions while simultaneously providing a cerebral mystery movie, this has everything that a SF fan could want. One of 2004's most satisfying films, I, Robot does more than linger in the memory for a while, it asks some very important questions about the frailty of humanity and queries the strength of our very existence. The DVD has plenty of extras to satisfy the most ardent of aficionados, including behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, trailers and more.

This movie begins by hinting it will be more than man vs. machine, perhaps with some of the intellect hinted in ""AI"", but it ends up being a pretty typical (but high class) action mystery with a typical ending.Briefly stated, the plot revolves around a society 30 years in the future where robots are everywhere and are serving mankind as maids, helpers, cooks, etc. Will Smith is a cop that doesn't trust robots for a couple reasons. In typical Hollywood style, his distrust begins as waywardness and ends as prescience when robot-induced mayhem is quelled in the denouement.This movie gets points for not being as predicatable as it suggests in the opening minutes, not to mention its outstanding production values, good musical score and extremely generous computer-generated scenes of robots, the 2035 city of Chicago and other impressive scenes that surely will generate a lot of visceral affect on wide screen television.Yet, in the final analysis, this is pretty typical stuff for both Smith and Hollywood -- a movie about a cop that seems to know something's wrong when no one else (including Ph.D. scientists, Smith's boss and other geniuses) can see the troubling developments.

The Asimov I grew up reading was a weaver of ideas, more mind candy than adventure story.  But here I found myself in Will Smith's bedroom, and then suddenly catapulted into a wild chase after a purse grabbing robot.  A far cry from the delicacy used by Asimov.  It took a while for the shock to wear off but eventually the conflict between Smith's gritty performance as Del Spooner and his original inspiration in the reminiscences of Dr. Susan Calvin (played by Bridget Moynahan) wears off and the view settles into a film that is inspired by Asimov, but does not imitate him.The sooner that happens, the better, because this is an exceptional film in its own right, even if it does proceed with the speed of a video game.  Smith creates a wisecracking character with a deep mistrust of robots. He is called in to to investigate what appears to be an impossible killing - robots can't kill humans, it's the first law of robotics.  But Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) lies dead and the only suspect is 'Sonny' a Series 5 robot with some surprising circuitry (played by Alan Tudyk).The death is declared a suicide, but Spooner refuses to give in.  suddenly the automated world turns on the detective, whose unlikely ally is Dr. Calvin, a robopsychologist responsible for the psyches of masses of robots about to be distributed around the planet.  One hair-raising escape after another propels the story along until viewers find themselves at a surprisingly reflective conclusion.  Not exactly classical Asimov, but a great story nonetheless.Will does a good job as Spooner, but he is upstaged by Moynihan's performance.  And both are blown away by Tudyk and the animators performance as Sonny.  As you watch Sonny develop from being slightly more simpatico than the scenery into a full-blown personality there are countless moments of surprise.  Moynihan and Smith do their best, but from the moment Sonny turns to Spooner and says ""Thank you... you said someone not something."" The film belongs to the robots.Excellent animation and CGI create a world that is a retro version of the future - perhaps exactly what Asimov imagined rather than what we would now.  The result is a compelling mix of the outr&eacute; and the mundane that sticks in the mind just as Sonny's wink does.This is not just an action film.  Threaded through it are the same questions that Asimov raised about the nature of self and intelligence.  Robots may never be human, but there are far more than furniture.  And if their thought processes are alien, they are more than the sum of their programming.  The result is one of the more carefully thought out science fiction films in recent times.",5,"""Perhaps this is my purpose""",1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,2742,"['first', 'reaction', 'film', 'began', 'was', 'Wait', ""n't"", 'Asimov', 'Asimov', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'was', 'weaver', 'ideas', 'more', 'mind', 'candy', 'adventure', 'story', 'here', 'found', 'Will', 'Smith', 'bedroom', 'then', 'suddenly', 'catapulted', 'wild', 'chase', 'purse', 'grabbing', 'robot', 'far', 'cry', 'delicacy', 'used', 'Asimov', 'took', 'while', 'shock', 'wear', 'off', 'eventually', 'conflict', 'Smith', 'gritty', 'performance', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'original', 'inspiration', 'reminiscences', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'view', 'film', 'inspired', 'Asimov', 'not', 'imitate', 'him.The', 'sooner', 'better', 'exceptional', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'even', 'proceed', 'speed', 'video', 'game', 'Smith', 'wisecracking', 'character', 'deep', 'mistrust', 'robots', 'called', 'investigate', 'what', 'be', 'impossible', 'killing', 'robots', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kill', 'humans', 'first', 'law', 'robotics', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'dead', 'only', 'suspect', ""'Sonny"", 'Series', '5', 'robot', 'surprising', 'circuitry', 'played', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', '.The', 'death', 'declared', 'suicide', 'Spooner', 'give', 'suddenly', 'automated', 'world', 'detective', 'unlikely', 'ally', 'Dr.', 'Calvin', 'robopsychologist', 'responsible', 'psyches', 'masses', 'robots', 'be', 'distributed', 'planet', 'One', 'hair-raising', 'escape', 'story', 'viewers', 'find', 'surprisingly', 'reflective', 'conclusion', 'Not', 'exactly', 'classical', 'Asimov', 'great', 'story', 'nonetheless.Will', 'good', 'job', 'Spooner', 'upstaged', 'Moynihan', 'performance', 'are', 'blown', 'away', 'Tudyk', 'animators', 'performance', 'Sonny', 'watch', 'Sonny', 'develop', 'being', 'slightly', 'more', 'simpatico', 'scenery', 'full-blown', 'personality', 'are', 'countless', 'moments', 'surprise', 'Moynihan', 'Smith', 'do', 'best', 'moment', 'Sonny', 'Spooner', 'Thank', 'said', 'someone', 'not', 'something', 'film', 'belongs', 'robots.Excellent', 'animation', 'CGI', 'create', 'world', 'retro', 'version', 'future', 'perhaps', 'exactly', 'what', 'Asimov', 'imagined', 'rather', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'result', 'compelling', 'mix', 'outr', 'eacute', 'mundane', 'mind', 'just', 'Sonny', 'wink', 'does.This', 'not', 'just', 'action', 'film', 'Threaded', 'are', 'same', 'questions', 'Asimov', 'raised', 'nature', 'self', 'intelligence', 'Robots', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'human', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'furniture', 'thought', 'processes', 'are', 'alien', 'are', 'more', 'sum', 'programming', 'result', 'one', 'more', 'carefully', 'thought', 'out', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'recent', 'times']","I, Robot"

625567,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B00005JN0T,Marshall Lord,"[0, 0]","There are many films which some people love and other people hate. It is less common for the same person to both love and hate a film, but I felt that way about ""I, Robot."" If you like science fiction and come at this with no preconceptions, not having read the original, you may well find it to be a fairly entertaining movie.However, if you are a big fan of Isaac Asimov, and particularly of his robot stories such as the original short story collection ""I, Robot"" there is a strong possibility that you will be absolutely infuriated by this film.Firstly, this is because most of Asimov's robot books were works of absolute genius both for the time they were written and even by comparison with events and things which have been written since. Asimov's depictions of robots and computers are far closer to the reality of computers and machines which surround us today than were the mechanical frankenstein monsters which every previous author who wrote about robots created. To be in the same league as Asimov's books the film would have had to be brilliant, and it isn't.Secondly, the scriptwriters have used the name of one of Asimov's books, the names of two of his characters, and his three ""laws of robotics"" to produce a film which at first sight appears dangerously close to being exactly the type of robot story which Asimov detested and was trying to get away from.As Asimov explained himself, he wanted to move on from the cliche in which every film or book about robots retold the story of Frankenstein with robots as the monster, repeating a cycle in which, to quote him, ""robots were created and destroyed their creators; robots were created and destroyed their creators.""Some Asimov fans will see the film ""I Robot"" as way too close to falling into exactly that pattern and will loathe it for this reason. The character Susan Calvin in the film, despite some good acting by Bridget Moynahan, is also a disappointing shadow of the much more human person created in Asimov's books.There is a massive irony in that in two of the most famous Sci-Fi stories about robots to be turned into films - this one and ""Blade Runner"" (Link:Blade Runner: The Final Cut (2-Disc Special Edition) [DVD] [1982]) - the film diametrically reversed the message of the original story in mirror image directions. In Philip K Dick's short story ""Do androids dream of electric sheep"" the robots were incapable of empathy and the readers' sympathies were meant to be mainly with the person who has the unpleasant job of eliminating them: Ridley Scott reversed this in ""Blade Runner"" in which sympathy lies with the robots.By contrast, Isaac Asimov's robot stories such as the original ""I, Robot"" were about as pro-robot as you can get: I don't want to explain this too precisely, to avoid ""spoiling"" the message of this film but but basically in this film director Alex Proyas changes the message in the opposite direction to Ridley Scott.In other words, perhaps Scott and Proyas should have swapped source books. If Ridley Scott wanted to make a pro-robot movie he could have made one based on ""I, Robot"" and Alex Proyas could have made a robot menace movie based on ""Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep."" Instead Scott made a pro-robot movie based on perhaps the most brilliantly written anti-robot story and Proyas made a robot menace movie named after probably the most brilliantly written pro-robot book!Having said all that, even from the viewpoint of an Asimov purist there are good things about this movie. During the first half of the film, Will Smith as Del Spooner, a paranoid detective who is something equivalent to an anti-robot racist, is the only person who suspects that anything might be wrong with the robots. During this part of the story, all the robots, except one apparent rogue, act exactly as Asimov predicted that his ""three laws of robotics"" could be used to make them support human society. Some robots continue to do so throughout the book and are effectively sympathetic characters rather than demons.Other good things in the film - there is some excellent acting, particularly from Smith, Moynahan, and James Cromwell who plays the father of robotics, Dr Alfred Lanning. The robot character Sonny was created using CGI based on the movements of actor Alan Tudyk (who played the pilot Wash in Serenity / Firefly) in the same way that Gollum was created for the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. This was particularly well done, but special effects were spectacularly good throughout the film.Dramatic tension was well managed and you are made to care about most of the characters. There is some excellent humour in the film. Overall I didn't think it was a bad film.If you like science fiction films and have not read any of Asimov's robot novels, give this a try and you will very probably enjoy it. If you have read and enjoyed the original novels, and are willing to accept that a film inspired by them does not have to rigidly follow all of Asimov's ideas, then the same will apply.If however you are a huge Asimov fan and are likely to be offended by people who are not quite up to his level of genius taking liberties with his work, you should probably leave this film alone.",4,"Not bad, but

625571,AESFW5DZC2XO7,B00005JN0T,"Matthew C. Stelly ""Global Genius""","[1, 1]","Race Plagarism Revisited: ""I, Robot""Reviewed by: Matthew C. StellyIn 1993, I came up with a concept called ""race plagiarism"" to describe the lack of creativity of today's crop of novelists, as well as TV and movie scriptwriters. In a nutshell, I see in recent movies the lack of true creativity and instead, the borrowing from African American history. These people take actual events and then change the color, the species and the setting of a ""story"" and attempt to pawn it off as original thought. Recent examples include ""The Planet of the Apes,"" ""Alien Nation,"" ""Star-Gate,"" and ""Alien vs. Predator.Joining this list is a new member of the ""Race Plagiarism Model,"" Will Smith's recently released, ""I, Robot.""This movie attempts to conceal (and as a result, reveals) the underlying plot and insinuations regarding American race relations. Take Uncle Tom's Cabinet, mix in a little of Sam Greenlee's ""Spook Who Sat by the Door"" and add a little bit of the historical realities of Nat Turner's slave rebellion and a pinch of John Brown's logic (just before his raid on Harper's Ferry) and you've got the essential recipe for this movie.The movie reminds one of the days of slavery where there was an over-dependency on the enslaved by those in power. In this movie, the ""slave"" is the robot, who is trained to obey three commands: These commands, similar to the ""Black Codes"" that were passed to control black people are, as follows:1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given it by man beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.As was the case during slavery, the enslaved began to outnumber the ""master"" (remember: the ""negro"" was made and manufactured in America), and the people in control grew wary. If the robots did not do their job, they were summarily destroyed. Not with lynch ropes, but by being decommissioned.Those robots who were banned (put out of commission) began to come together and as such, planned to rebel against the system. The result, as in any instance where large groups of entities are systematically exploited: a well-planned revolution.One robot tells humans, during the bloody revolt, ""You cannot be trusted with your own survival. To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered."" Aren't these nearly the exact words of your current President? And in a nation where the people are supposed to be in power, does this statement by a robot ring a bell: ""The created must sometimes protect the creator, sometimes against his will."" Are we, the people, even now, being ""protected against our will"" even though it's supposed to be OUR government?And earlier, when one of the `overseers' is chastising a robot, he utters, ""You are so like children. We must protect you from yourselves."" This is exactly what our ancestors were told on the plantation even as those in power built the most powerful economy in the world - on our backs.The racism historically heaped upon the backs of blacks was personified in Smith's character. HE was the one made to look ""prejudiced against Robots."" In fact, the robots protecting the system, along with Smith and an Uncle Tom robot named ""Sonny,"" defeat the resistance - as was the case with Denmark Vesey and Gabriel Prosser revolts in 18th century America. If you don't recognize these names, look them up.The fact is, even though the movie is set in 2035, the creators of the robots see an need for these robots to have human faces, and yet the robots are white. And speaking of color, note that Smith, being black and the police chief, also being black, never mention race a single time? We can deduce, from this, that the scriptwriter was white (they are ones of want to depict th future as being one of ""colorblindness"" although their race has always been color-CONSCIOUS).Another piece of evidence indicating the race  (or consciousness) of the writer? Not a single sister. Not one black woman. Smith's female colleague is a white woman. But, true to form she helped ""the man"" to create these robots, but then turns on him when she finds out that several of the robots have `revolted.' Check out corporate America and who does the bidding for that Old Boys Network at the top. And since there is no black wife physically in this movie, no girlfriend of color, this means that all of Smith's heroics are aimed at saving who? The white girl.Just as assimilationist blacks are marched out and made ""leaders"" by the white media, this robot ""Sonny"" becomes the leader of the resistance. At the movie's end he stands atop a hill looking down at them. He (having sold out and who has human characteristics) will define their future and direct their lives for them. Look around Omaha; doesn't this sound familiar?Finally at the end of the movie, Sonny, the robot makes a statement that represents the epitome of the true slave: ""Now that I have fulfilled my purpose, I don't know what to do."" Smith tells him, ""I guess you'll have to find your way like the rest of us, Sonny ... I guess that's what it means to be free.""The question is, will black folks, not just robots, be FREE in the year 2035?",3,"I, Robot: Race Relations is Basis of Futuristic Movie",1103241600,"12 17,

Fans of Isaac Asimov, a pioneer of science fiction writing on robots, were disappointed with the film for not sticking closely to any one of his stories. I disagree entirely. Proyas and his screenwriter have taken the core element of Asimov's writing - the problems that creating a conscious, intelligent being would create for the world (and the being itself), and the famous ""Three Laws of Robotics"" - and used them as vehicles for a fun summer blockbuster. What you end up with is a summer movie that rises above the rest of the shallow, corn-popping action flicks that surround it. It is questionable whether or not humanity will ever be able to achieve the level of artificial intelligence that Asimov wrote about. But if we do, then his writings (and this movie) will suddenly become much more poignant, and it is almost certain that Asimov's three laws would be implemented to control the behaviors of those intelligences.

Most of the budget was obviously blown on the CGI and miniatures effects. Most of the CGI is quite impressive, although very occasionally the back projection does look a bit iffy, but it only lasts a couple of seconds at most.I, Robot is set in 2035, and most of the futuristic elements are subtle rather than the in-your-face ones say for example from Demolition Man or Back To The Future II. Apart from the severely high rise buildings, there's also spherical wheels on the vehicles (which meant they could go in any direction), more of the self-drive, and the car doors swinging upwards a la Delorean. The production designers and conceptual artists had a great time imagining a progression of today's world.When I think of robots, for some reason I now automatically think of Bicentennial Man, rather than the robot design in this. They're not very friendly looking, but I suppose Alex Proyas wanted to put his own stamp on the robot design, rather than follow in the generic type featured in some other films.  Maybe he wanted the robots to look vaguely humanoid but still obviously robotic, rather than the cyborg type.I always find with Will Smith that he quite often does play the same character, much like the way Tom Cruise is getting. He's still got elements of Fresh Prince about his character, despite being over a decade on from that now, and with a lot more muscles. He's nearly always the funny guy, with the one-liners. He's always been good at the action side of things, all 6ft 2 of him (which he's been since he was 13!), but there's still the funny guy waiting to burst out with a hilarious one liner that will have everyone rolling in the aisles. For all the ladies out there, we get to see Big Will himself in the shower, in profile. The film is worth the price just for that scene alone. And the two scenes where he gets out of bed in boxers. Unless you're a heterosexual guy.For me, I wasn't overly keen on this film. It wasn't a really, really, good film, but on the other hand it wasn't a really, really bad film. It was kinda stuck in the middle, but not in a good way. Not to be sexist, but apart from the scenes in the shower, it was more a guy's kinda film. There were some scenes glossed over, like the story of how Will's character came to be partially cybernetic, which led me to believe that he was a robot, Terminator-esque. He wasn't.The two disc special edition which was released in the UK has a multitude of extras on it, including commentaries (does anyone ever bother with these?); a 44 minute making of documentary; extensive production diaries; CGI effects breakdowns etc. They were reasonably good, if you're into that sort of thing, but I'm finding I watch extras on the DVD less & less now, only if it's a blooper reel, or a film I really, really like.Overall, a film that could have been better, and could have been worse. And I'd like an order of Will Smith in the shower on the side with that. From now on, lets just have all Will Smith films featuring him in the shower.",2,"In the world of the near future, robots are commonplace and walk the streets with humans.",1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,3133,"['Will', 'Smith', 'earned', '28', 'million', 'doing', 'film', 'budget', 'was', 'probably', 'similar', 'astronomical', 'scale', 'Most', 'budget', 'was', 'obviously', 'blown', 'CGI', 'miniatures', 'effects', 'Most', 'CGI', 'quite', 'impressive', 'very', 'occasionally', 'back', 'projection', 'look', 'bit', 'iffy', 'only', 'couple', 'seconds', 'most.I', 'Robot', 'set', '2035', 'most', 'futuristic', 'elements', 'are', 'subtle', 'rather', 'in-your-face', 'ones', 'say', 'example', 'Demolition', 'Man', 'Back', 'Future', 'II', 'Apart', 'severely', 'high', 'rise', 'buildings', 'also', 'spherical', 'wheels', 'vehicles', 'meant', 'could', 'go', 'direction', 'more', 'self-drive', 'car', 'doors', 'swinging', 'upwards', 'la', 'Delorean', 'production', 'designers', 'conceptual', 'artists', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'imagining', 'progression', 'today', 'world.When', 'think', 'robots', 'reason', 'now', 'automatically', 'think', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'rather', 'robot', 'design', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'friendly', 'looking', 'suppose', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'wanted', 'put', 'own', 'stamp', 'robot', 'design', 'rather', 'follow', 'generic', 'type', 'featured', 'other', 'films', 'Maybe', 'wanted', 'robots', 'look', 'vaguely', 'humanoid', 'still', 'obviously', 'robotic', 'rather', 'cyborg', 'type.I', 'always', 'find', 'Will', 'Smith', 'quite', 'often', 'play', 'same', 'character', 'much', 'way', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'getting', 'still', 'got', 'elements', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'character', 'being', 'over', 'decade', 'now', 'lot', 'more', 'muscles', 'nearly', 'always', 'funny', 'guy', 'one-liners', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'action', 'side', 'things', '6ft', '2', 'been', 'was', '13', 'still', 'funny', 'guy', 'waiting', 'burst', 'out', 'hilarious', 'one', 'liner', 'will', 'have', 'everyone', 'rolling', 'aisles', 'ladies', 'there', 'get', 'see', 'Big', 'Will', 'shower', 'profile', 'film', 'price', 'just', 'scene', 'alone', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'bed', 'boxers', ""'re"", 'heterosexual', 'guy.For', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'keen', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'kinda', 'stuck', 'middle', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'Not', 'be', 'sexist', 'apart', 'scenes', 'shower', 'was', 'more', 'guy', 'kinda', 'film', 'were', 'scenes', 'glossed', 'story', 'how', 'Will', 'character', 'came', 'be', 'partially', 'cybernetic', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'robot', 'Terminator-esque', ""wasn't.The"", 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'was', 'released', 'UK', 'multitude', 'extras', 'including', 'commentaries', 'anyone', 'ever', 'bother', '44', 'minute', 'making', 'documentary', 'extensive', 'production', 'diaries', 'CGI', 'effects', 'breakdowns', 'etc', 'were', 'reasonably', 'good', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', ""'m"", 'finding', 'watch', 'extras', 'DVD', 'less', 'less', 'now', 'only', 'blooper', 'reel', 'film', 'really', 'really', 'like.Overall', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worse', ""'d"", 'like', 'order', 'Will', 'Smith', 'shower', 'side', 'now', 'lets', 'just', 'have', 'Will', 'Smith', 'films', 'featuring', 'shower']","I, Robot"

625578,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JN0T,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[4, 6]","The 2004 sci-fi action thriller ""I, Robot"" was inspired by a collection of short stories of the same name and written by Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) in 1950.  It was in this collection of sci-fi stories that Isaac Asimov introduced his three laws of robotics, which define for a robot its interactions with humans.  These three laws were the basis for the 2004 film's story, not the collection of short stories themselves.  This undoubtedly left left many theater patrons who have read Asimov's works disappointed with the film because unlike the short stories, the film's plot is built around a human character named Del Spooner (Will Smith), who is a technophobic police detective.  The film opens in the year 2035 with the apparent suicide of a brilliant scientist whose work in robotics has made the fictional company of ""U.S. Robotics"" more powerful than Microsoft could ever hope to have.  Called upon to investigate the suicide, Del Spooner personally knew the dead scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell, who played Dr. Zefram Cochrane in the 1996 ""Star Trek VIII: First Contact"").  However, Del's mistrust of technology, and especially robots, puts him at odds with the CEO of U.S. Robotics, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), who instead has him speak to one of Dr. Lanning's associates, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan).  While investigating Dr. Lanning's office at U.S. Robotics (where he is believed to have flung himself through a window), Del & Susan are startled when an NS5 robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) leaps from its hiding place.  Del is convinced that Sonny murdered Dr. Lanning, but no one believes him since that would violate the three laws of robotics that are programmed into every robot.  Further, such a situation would be highly embarrassing for U.S. Robotics, which is planning to release its new NS5 robots for use by the general public, who currently use the earlier NS4 models.  Undeterred, Del continues his investigation, but someone clearly doesn't like what he is doing as NS5 robots start to attack him.  The only question is who?Having read so many poor reviews for ""I, Robot"", I was pleasantly surprised by the film upon having the opportunity to view it myself.  The special effects and cinematography are quite good, and the story itself, which was written by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, is entertaining even though it is not an actual Asimov work.  I do highly recommend the documentary included on the DVD that explains the making of ""I, Robot"". It was quite interesting to see how the robots in the film were created through a combination of live actors and CGI.  Though I understandably cannot necessarily recommend the film to Asimov purists, overall, I do rate ""I, Robot"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  People familiar with the 1994 film ""The Crow"" and the 1998 film ""Dark City"" will no doubt recognize director Alex Proyas' handiwork with ""I, Robot"".",4,"""Murder's a new trick for a robot, congratulations.""",1108339200,"02 14, 2005",2005,2903,"['2004', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'Robot', 'was', 'inspired', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', '1920-1992', '1950', 'was', 'collection', 'sci-fi', 'stories', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'introduced', 'three', 'laws', 'robotics', 'define', 'robot', 'interactions', 'humans', 'three', 'laws', 'were', 'basis', '2004', 'film', 'story', 'not', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'undoubtedly', 'left', 'left', 'many', 'theater', 'patrons', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'Asimov', 'works', 'disappointed', 'film', 'short', 'stories', 'film', 'plot', 'built', 'human', 'character', 'named', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'technophobic', 'police', 'detective', 'film', 'year', '2035', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'work', 'robotics', 'made', 'fictional', 'company', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'more', 'powerful', 'Microsoft', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'have', 'Called', 'investigate', 'suicide', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'personally', 'knew', 'dead', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'who', 'played', 'Dr.', 'Zefram', 'Cochrane', '1996', 'Star', 'Trek', 'VIII', 'First', 'Contact', 'However', 'Del', 'mistrust', 'technology', 'especially', 'robots', 'odds', 'CEO', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'Lawrence', 'Robertson', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'who', 'instead', 'speak', 'one', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'associates', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'investigating', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'office', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'where', 'believed', 'have', 'flung', 'window', 'Del', 'Susan', 'are', 'startled', 'when', 'NS5', 'robot', 'named', 'Sonny', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'hiding', 'place', 'Del', 'convinced', 'Sonny', 'murdered', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'one', 'would', 'violate', 'three', 'laws', 'robotics', 'are', 'programmed', 'robot', 'Further', 'such', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'embarrassing', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'planning', 'release', 'new', 'NS5', 'robots', 'use', 'general', 'public', 'who', 'currently', 'use', 'earlier', 'NS4', 'models', 'Undeterred', 'Del', 'investigation', 'someone', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'doing', 'NS5', 'robots', 'start', 'attack', 'only', 'question', 'who', 'Having', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'poor', 'reviews', 'Robot', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'having', 'opportunity', 'view', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'Jeff', 'Vintar', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'entertaining', 'even', 'not', 'actual', 'Asimov', 'work', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'included', 'DVD', 'making', 'Robot', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'robots', 'film', 'were', 'created', 'combination', 'live', 'actors', 'CGI', 'understandably', 'can', 'not', 'necessarily', 'recommend', 'film', 'Asimov', 'purists', 'overall', 'do', 'rate', 'Robot', '4', '5', 'stars', 'People', 'familiar', '1994', 'film', 'Crow', '1998', 'film', 'Dark', 'City', 'will', 'doubt', 'recognize', 'director', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'handiwork', 'Robot']","I, Robot"

Based extremely loosely on the book of short stories by Isaac Asimov, this film is a crude assembly of action-movie cliches that somehow make an entire film.In a near-future Chicago, robots are commonplace and something of a servant class, bound by the Three Laws of Robotics, which prohibits harm of humans and compels obedience.  When a robot apparently commits murder, the cop who investigates the crime finds something much more threatening afoot than a single homicide.Executed well, this could have been a decent movie, but no one involved seems that interested in any real level of originality.  The writing is loaded with cliches, most prominently with Will Smith's cop character, a sullen but wise-cracking detective who has a deep dislike for robots.  You've seen the same character in a dozen other movies, as well as the wise-and-feisty grandmother, the hard-nosed police captain, the sinisterly pragmatic CEO and the idealistic-and-nave scientist.  The action sequences are also often comically stale, with slow-mo, Matrix-like effects that more intrusive than effective.Unfortunately, the movie does have some good stuff; I say ""unfortunately"" because if it was completely bad, it would be more likely that this sort of movie would be rejected by audiences and we'd stop seeing these relatively tedious flicks.

He was loud, annoying, and very difficult to care about.  His backstory was also pretty standard stuff.- Awful CGI and special effects.  Yup, the robots themselves had little or no detail and the action sequences looked about as video game-ish as you can get. Of course there were the usual ""how did the hero escape that situation"" scenes. Yuk.- The Police Chief that has to take Smiths badge was also textbook cliche and added nothing.- Very little suspense. Not sure why...but this movie did not have me wondering what was going to happen next. I barely cared anyways. The action scenes were dull and the characters were too.  'Nuff Said.- The movie just didnt know what it wanted to do with itself and got into that ""funk"" that some films get into when you feel like they are just burning time up.Overall, other than the concept which is cool, this film lacked any real excitement and when it was over I had the ""That's it?"" feeling.Needless to say I wont be adding this to my collection.

Mostly a mishmash of BLADE RUNNER, A.I. and every antihero cop movie ever made, the film follows Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) on a quest to find the killer of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the genius behind the workforce-dominating humanoid robots that fill up nearly every scene in this clunky CGI/live amalgamation. The film supposedly takes place in Chicago, but there is not one slight reminder of that city until a shot of the river near the very end that's vaguely recognizable. Spooner hates robots and suspects them for some reason from the beginning, but we never get to know him well enough to care; the film spends much more time erotically fascinated by Will Smith's big pecs than it does in creating a cohesive person for him to play.Of course, robots aren't people; robots can't kill, or so we are told. There are many quick, fleeting references to interesting themes throughout the film such as:* what does it mean to be human?* is hating a harmless machine similar to being racist (both Spooner and his long-suffering boss are black, in a world that seems to have nearly, but not quite, forgotten that fact)?* at one point does a human with replacement parts start to become more machine than man * does it emasculate, or ameliorate humanity to have its menial tasks performed by something man-created?* can you actually program a machine to think for itself?etc etc...but they are all subordinated to endless chases and explosions and gun battles. There are no characters of consequence here, and even the seeming possibility of a love story between Spooner and scientist Susan Calvin (based on one of Asimov's most famous characters but unrecognizable apart from the name) goes nowhere. There just isn't time with all the action they have to put in! Not to mention dozens of product placements, and, did I forget to mention, Will Smith's perfect-as-a-robot sculpted body.

625598,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00005JN0T,Nicholas Carroll,"[6, 9]","This film intrigued me because of the interesting premise about a robot accused of murder, which is something it supposedly cannot do.  That's because there are three laws that govern the internal programming of robots...one being that they cannot kill a human being, that their job is to protect human life.  So, the film hooks you by an intriguing premise then reels you in until they pull a switch on you (that old ""bait and switch"" standby) and the film leads elsewhere, and that's where it falls apart.The first half of the movie is well done and quite intriguing.  Will Smith as Detective Spooner is investigating a strange death of the creator of these robots.  The dead man happened to have fallen out of a window, so everyone thinks its suicide.  Spooner suspects otherwise, because he has a history of hating robots.  Everyone else ""knows"" that there's no way a robot could commit murder because of the three operating principles.  So, we get an interesting storyline in which the robot is apprehended and interrogated.  The film has the look and feel of another film set in the future (Spielberg's ""Minority Report"").  In fact, to watch both films as a double feature would convince you that they take place in the same time period and place as one another.  I liked that about this film (because I'm a huge fan of ""Minority Report"").Once the twist happens, the film goes into a different tangent and it all goes downhill from there.  Its a gimmick that I'm growing tired of...the old switcheroo.  Movie audiences are so sophiscated these days that Hollywood seems like they have to continually pull fast ones on moviegoers by making unexpected twists in the story just to throw people off from predicting the ending.  But by the end of this movie, who really cared?  The trailers sold it as one thing, the film resolves to something else entirely, and I couldn't help but feel ripped off and cheated.  This film wasn't so much a murder mystery, exploring the paradox of the three rules in regards to how a robot could commit murder, as it is a cautionary tale about the militarization of the country as it moves towards totalitarianism by use of artificial intelligence to do the dirty deed of preventing people from rising up against the corporate takeover of our government.

625601,A33TBHM3O9AY17,B00005JN0T,No one of consequence,"[22, 28]","I watched this one with my family over the weekend and, quite frankly, had a ball.  Yeah, to some extent it's a movie with a message, but mainly it's just plain entertaining.  If you try to read too much into it, you'll miss the opportunity for a good old-fashioned sci fi romp.Fast forward to the year 2035.  The monolithic company ""U.S. Robotics"" has put NS-4 domestic assistant robots into mass production, so much so that they are commonplace ""members"" of American society.  Their artificial intelligence is designed to be as much like humans as possible, but is regulated by the ""3 laws"" programming that is hardwired into every robot.  These laws are:  1. To protect human life above all; 2. To obey human commands except if it would violate law 1; and 3. To protect its own existence unless doing so would violate laws 1 or 2.  The laws seem a foolproof way to ensure that the robots would never pose a threat to humanity.  But all that changed when the man billed as the father of robotic technology and the 3 laws turns up dead in a very public, and very suspicous, manner, just as the new and improved NS-5 model is about to flood the market.  The death is quickly written off by all concerned as a suicide.  All except detective Dale Spooner, this is.Being a good cop and a sharp detective, Spooner (played by Will Smith) in not content that the professor's death was a suicide, and begins investigating with the lead suspect, an NS-5 robot named ""Sonny"".  Sonny's intelligence is so advanced, and his ""emotions"" so well simulated, that he appears to have something resembling a human soul.  Spooner believes that Sonny killed the professor, and sets out to prove it.  His (over)zealous approach to the task, coupled with his deep distrust of robots and their manufacturer, quickly lands him in hot water with some powerful people.  Some difficult and destructive encounters with the metallic menaces leave him looking like an obsessive paranoiac, and ultimately result in his suspension from the police force.Spooner continues his chase nonetheless, following a series of clues left by the dead professor, as step by step the mystery begins the unwind.  All along the way are some great action sequences, plot twists and one-liners.  However, except for Will Smith's character (which is the same as it has been in every film he has done since ""Men in Black""), nothing about the story is predictable.  When the final shoe drops, most viewers will be pleasantly surprised by the unexpected ending.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a wild ride with lots of great sci fi treats and effects.  The only downsides were the lack of character development on any signficant level -- this is a purely plot-driven movie -- and the fact that Will Smith essentially played himself, much as he always does.  Still, it's worth seeing.  I certainly don't regret the investment of two hours.",3,"Entertaining and imaginative, but the same old Will Smith.",1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,2900,"['watched', 'one', 'family', 'weekend', 'quite', 'frankly', 'had', 'ball', 'Yeah', 'extent', 'movie', 'message', 'mainly', 'just', 'plain', 'entertaining', 'try', 'read', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'opportunity', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'sci', 'fi', 'romp.Fast', 'forward', 'year', '2035', 'monolithic', 'company', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'put', 'NS-4', 'domestic', 'assistant', 'robots', 'mass', 'production', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'commonplace', 'members', 'American', 'society', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'designed', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'humans', 'possible', 'regulated', '3', 'laws', 'programming', 'hardwired', 'robot', 'laws', 'are', '1', 'protect', 'human', 'life', '2', 'obey', 'human', 'commands', 'would', 'violate', 'law', '1', '3', 'protect', 'own', 'existence', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'violate', 'laws', '1', '2', 'laws', 'seem', 'foolproof', 'way', 'ensure', 'robots', 'would', 'never', 'pose', 'threat', 'humanity', 'changed', 'when', 'man', 'billed', 'father', 'robotic', 'technology', '3', 'laws', 'up', 'dead', 'very', 'public', 'very', 'suspicous', 'manner', 'just', 'new', 'improved', 'NS-5', 'model', 'flood', 'market', 'death', 'quickly', 'written', 'off', 'concerned', 'suicide', 'detective', 'Dale', 'Spooner', 'is.Being', 'good', 'cop', 'sharp', 'detective', 'Spooner', 'played', 'Will', 'Smith', 'not', 'content', 'professor', 'death', 'was', 'suicide', 'investigating', 'lead', 'suspect', 'NS-5', 'robot', 'named', 'Sonny', 'Sonny', 'intelligence', 'so', 'advanced', 'emotions', 'so', 'well', 'simulated', 'have', 'something', 'resembling', 'human', 'soul', 'Spooner', 'Sonny', 'killed', 'professor', 'out', 'prove', 'zealous', 'approach', 'task', 'coupled', 'deep', 'distrust', 'robots', 'manufacturer', 'quickly', 'hot', 'water', 'powerful', 'people', 'difficult', 'destructive', 'encounters', 'metallic', 'menaces', 'leave', 'looking', 'obsessive', 'paranoiac', 'ultimately', 'result', 'suspension', 'police', 'force.Spooner', 'chase', 'nonetheless', 'following', 'series', 'clues', 'left', 'dead', 'professor', 'step', 'step', 'mystery', 'unwind', 'way', 'are', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'plot', 'twists', 'one-liners', 'However', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'same', 'been', 'film', 'done', 'Men', 'Black', 'nothing', 'story', 'predictable', 'When', 'final', 'shoe', 'drops', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'unexpected', 'ending.All', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'wild', 'ride', 'lots', 'great', 'sci', 'fi', 'treats', 'effects', 'only', 'downsides', 'were', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'signficant', 'level', 'purely', 'plot-driven', 'movie', 'fact', 'Will', 'Smith', 'essentially', 'played', 'much', 'always', 'Still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'investment', 'two', 'hours']","I, Robot"

625608,ADE852UR9121C,B00005JN0T,perfecto,"[1, 3]","Okay, when the best acting in the movie comes from a robot, you know something's not right. In this futuristic (yawn) movie, Det. Spooner is investigating the death of a roboticist, Dr. Lanning. He finds a protocol NS-5 robot, Sonny in the doctor's room and being the robo-hater that he is...immediately blames Sonny for the murder. Of course, Sonny being the cool, kick-ass robot that HE is, escapes. Spooner, with the help of robot psychologist Susan have to track down Sonny and get to the root of the ""who-dunnit"" mystery. Oh yeah, robots in the future are programmed with these 3 laws:1) They can't hurt humans.2) They have to follow whatever the hell the human tells them unless it conflicts with Rule 1.3) Robots will do anything to protect themselves unless it conflicts with Rule 1.So, there lies the problem. How could the NS-5 unit have killed Dr. Lanning.I have to say, although I LOVE sci-fi movies...it's a tricky genre to tackle. Overdoing it, and it becomes silly. Not doing enough would make it bland. Plus it has to be original. In I, Robot...I felt like I was watching a mixture of other sci-fi movies particularly Minority Report (which I totally DUG, and have watched it about 10 times). And the sad thing was, the concept behind this movie was pretty interesting (credit to Asimov for that) but of course as soon as they Hollywood-ized it, the movie falls apart. The story is SO typical, it offers nothing new. Det. Spooner is the rogue detective, the ""thinking out of the box-crazy type"" that 10 minutes into the movie, you know that in the end he's gonna be right, and he's gonna go back to his captain (or whatever) and say ""a-ha, in your face"". While the robot, Sonny was definitely interesting, it didn't really lead to anything groundbreaking. Apart from that, we have the reluctant but noble heroin, the guy who's trying so hard to be bad that you know he's not the culprit, and a whole lotta unoriginal stuff. To me, this is why the movie failed. As I said, it had an interesting premise but it just doesn't get explored in the way I would've liked it to.The acting is so-so. Will Smith is really starting to irritate me. After his fantastic performances in movies like Independance Day, Enemy Of The State and Men In Black (1, not 2), now he just seems content to look buff and deliver lame lines. More than once, I felt like punching the heck out of him. I know, he didn't have much to work on anyway, thanks to such a dry script, but I still felt he was really miscast here. Bridget Moynahan delivers a mediocre performance, there seemed to be no chemistry whatsoever between her and Spooner, she looked like she was acting with a gun to her head. The rest of the cast do an alright job, probably because they've seen the same thing in a hundred other movies.The saving grace for this movie has got to be the visual effects. There were many scenes with the robots that literally took my breath away. It's amazing how far CG has advanced in movies. Everytime Sonny appears on screen, he steals the limelight. His moves and facial expressions outperforms the humans anytime. Even when he speaks, his voice seem to reflect his emotions, which caused the hoo-ha because robots are not supposed to have emotions.

With the exception of Fahrenheit 451, I could say the same for Ray Bradbury.  Anyway, leaving behind all references to the original material, I was initially disappointed in the screen adaptation of ""I Robot.""  To no great surprise, within a short time I forgot everything about the film.  Curious to take a second look, I did so (on DVD) and found that I enjoyed the flick more sitting at home than viewing it in a movie theater.  Maybe upon a second viewing, I came into it expecting little and, therefore, wasn't nearly as disappointed.  Knowing there would be almost no ""heady"" material, I just sat back and watched things getting thrashed around.  The FX seemed fine to me.  In keeping with the lightweight material, I enjoyed Will Smith's performance much more.  He has some good one-liners, and maintains an almost light-hearted demeanor throughout any catastrophe, which some may claim as campy.  I decided to purchase this DVD because I knew that in another several months or a year, I'd forget everything about the story entirely.  This is fine with me because I'm not always in the mood to watch something memorable.  Maybe I'm nuts but I sometimes enjoy popping in a DVD that rings no bells, sitting back and thinking, ""Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah,"" as if being brought to remember some half-forgotten dream of no particular significance.  I find it fun.

Still, I'm a hige fan of Alex Proyas, and I had to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.Spooner (Will Smith) is a detective in 2035, when robots are commonplace. Spooner is not a big fan of robots despite, as we find out in the first scene, having had his life saved by one. He is called to U. S. Robotics, the company that manufactures all those robots, after Alfred Lanning (Babe's James Cromwell) plunges to his death from hundreds of feet above the building's lobby. Everyone else is convinced his death is a suicide-- but Spooner's not so sure. With the company poised to roll out its new line, CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) isn't thrilled with an anti-robot cop running around.The first thing you have to do with I, Robot is to divorce it from the source material. This is not Isaac Asimov's novel. (It probably would have been a good idea for them to put a different title on it.) In fact, it admits this, stating that the movie was ""inspired by"" the novel rather than based on it. So don't think of it as a bad adaptation of Asimov, or that's what you're going to get. The second thing you have to do with it is forgive it its relatively stupid climax and even stupider ending. Obviously, someone has a lot of his special effects budget left and didn't want to get less money for effects for his next film. That said, the effects are, in fact, pretty cool, and if you can switch your brain off when we get to the climax, you've got a chance.It's a shame you have to, though, because the first hour or so of the movie is a well-plotted, intelligent mystery flick. Sure, it's nothing special-- renegade cop who thinks he's onto the truth while everyone else thinks he's nuts-- but it's done with style and humor. And, of course, lots of special effects. This is a story that allows for exploration with effects, and Proyas takes advantage of that, much like he did in Dark City. The difference is that there, he managed to rein in the compulsion to descend into effects-mania that he shows here. (Perhaps the smaller budget helped.) When it comes right down to it, Proyas is a very good director, and this could have been a truly fantastic film. As it stands, it's not a bad film, but it didn't quite realize its potential. ***",3,Not nearly as bad as it's made out to be.,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,2335,"['Robot', 'Alex', 'Proyas', '2004', 'Man', 'heard', 'lot', 'bad', 'things', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'Still', ""'m"", 'hige', 'fan', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'had', 'give', 'shot', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.Spooner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'detective', '2035', 'when', 'robots', 'are', 'commonplace', 'Spooner', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'robots', 'find', 'out', 'first', 'scene', 'having', 'had', 'life', 'saved', 'one', 'called', 'U.', 'S.', 'Robotics', 'company', 'robots', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'Babe', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'death', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'building', 'lobby', 'Everyone', 'else', 'convinced', 'death', 'suicide', 'Spooner', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'company', 'poised', 'roll', 'out', 'new', 'line', 'CEO', 'Lawrence', 'Robertson', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'anti-robot', 'cop', 'running', 'around.The', 'first', 'thing', 'have', 'do', 'Robot', 'divorce', 'source', 'material', 'not', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'novel', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'idea', 'put', 'different', 'title', 'fact', 'stating', 'movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'novel', 'rather', 'based', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'adaptation', 'Asimov', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'second', 'thing', 'have', 'do', 'forgive', 'relatively', 'stupid', 'climax', 'even', 'stupider', 'ending', 'Obviously', 'someone', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'left', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'less', 'money', 'effects', 'next', 'film', 'said', 'effects', 'are', 'fact', 'pretty', 'cool', 'can', 'switch', 'brain', 'when', 'get', 'climax', ""'ve"", 'got', 'chance.It', 'shame', 'have', 'though', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'well-plotted', 'intelligent', 'mystery', 'flick', 'Sure', 'nothing', 'special', 'renegade', 'cop', 'who', 'truth', 'everyone', 'else', 'nuts', 'done', 'style', 'humor', 'course', 'lots', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'exploration', 'effects', 'Proyas', 'advantage', 'much', 'did', 'Dark', 'City', 'difference', 'there', 'managed', 'rein', 'compulsion', 'descend', 'effects-mania', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'smaller', 'budget', 'helped', 'When', 'right', 'down', 'Proyas', 'very', 'good', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'realize', 'potential', '***']","I, Robot"

Go ahead - you try. Azimov's books are for reading and I understand that translating it to cinema is a big challenge. For me, there were many scenes in the movie that were exactly what I imagined as I read. Smith's character was a little experimental but after Independence Day, I was completely convinced that a little of his characteristic cockiness would make it more entertaining for modern audiences. I still laugh when I think about him smacking the alien in the face (Independence Day) in their first face-to-face encounter. Azimov's work is not comedy however and I would take that back today, but would still be very happy with Smith as the lead character. I am willing to take responsibility for Smith's humorous deviation from pure Azimov. It was my fault. I will say however, that his portrayal merely added a little rather than being completely different (while not denying that the addition made it different).Russian immigrant Azimov blended commentary on mass social (and political) movements and cultural differences in his writing as clearly as descriptions of science and environment - which rivaled Jules Verne. The robot rebellion itself, complete with central computer, mirrored the Bolshevik Revolution and rise of Communism. He defined (take this literally) the meaning of ""hero."" (One person can make a difference.) Some might have been more satisfied had the film included a Blade Runner type narration to beat home particulars - to have made the central computer's (V.I.K.I) reasoning for the take-over clearer. While viewing with others previously unfamiliar with the story, I heard some ""What?"" - ""Why?"" and even a ""What's wrong with that?"" The apparent loss of understanding of the evil of dictatorship and value of freedom convinces me that Azimov's work is as important today as it ever was.I think it is important to bring Azimov's work to the screen, not least because it is some of the very best science fiction produced in the twentieth century. And I do prefer keeping films true to the original work. I would argue that this film is the best adaptation of Azimov so far. Letting action speak for itself - to some extent - is not entirely wrong in film. I am hoping that sci-fi fans everywhere will join me in encouraging more Azimov at the movies in the future; regardless of the challenge. Perhaps a nip and tuck here and there will bring the experience a little closer to the read. But I will now caution viewers just as I caution movie-makers.

Zwick,"[3, 4]","Based on the classic novel by Isaac Asimov, ""I, Robot"" is a tasty sci-fi elixir with a nifty whodunit twist.Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago homicide detective who has always harbored deep suspicions about the servile robots who are fast becoming common household items in the year 2035.  One day, Spooner is called in to investigate the suicide of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the inventor largely responsible for the technology that has gone into the making of these robots.  Almost immediately, Spooner begins to suspect that Lanning's death may not have been a suicide at all but rather a homicide perpetrated by the robots who, though programmed to do no harm to humans, may be evolving to the point where they are becoming sentient beings fully capable of overriding their programming and acting at will.  As this brand new model of robot hits the streets, Spooner becomes something of a modern day Cassandra (or Chicken Little, if you prefer), attempting to convince his skeptical superiors that this seemingly benign army of anthropomorphic mechanisms may actually be a threat to human civilization as we know it.Like virtually all quality science fiction, ""I, Robot"" aims its sights at mankind`s propensity for sowing the seeds of its own destruction, in this case by inventing technology that eventually outruns the ability of its creators to control it.  And when it comes to artificial intelligence, in particular, how long, the film asks, will it be before the intelligence becomes real and the creator becomes subservient to that which he has created?""I, Robot"" is a sleek, thought-provoking action film, filled with suspense, drama and mind-boggling plot twists.  On a purely visual level, however, the film is a bit more problematic.  Although the backdrops that work to create the image of a futuristic Chicago are eye-popping and dazzling, some of the computer-generated images, particularly in the action sequences, look a trifle too much like video games to be entirely convincing.  Still, although the movement of the robots isn't as realistic as, perhaps, we would like it to be, the facial expressions are fantastically effective, creating a sense of personality and life behind a faade of cold, synthetic technology.I haven't read the story on which the film is based, so I have no way of knowing how faithful to Asimov's original vision the filmmakers have been.

The 3D conversion version is worth the extra coin and the actual conversion has been done extremely well, with few, if any, artifacts or depth-of field/focus screw-ups.While Will Smith was his typical self, showing (I think), the right amount of strength, weakness, brashness and humour, I have always thought that the part of Susan Calvin was rather underplayed by Bridget Moynahan and that a more animated performance was required, from someone like Sandra Bullock, or even Mary McDonnell (now that would be interesting).There are plenty of reviews out there that say pretty much what I would, although I personally think this movie is a lot better than it has generally been given credit for. While I liked the DVD, the 3D Blu-ray version is stunning. The 3D effect has worked a treat and the upgrade to the soundtrack is fabulous. I have the advantage of now, (since a major upgrade), watching movies at home via a quality projector on a really big (136&#34; 16:9) screen, which makes the 3D experience (and the 11.2 sound experience too) simply mind-blowing.

Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Smith) has a distrust for machines in a technological era that runs on robots and other thinking machines.  Robots seem compelled to please, and not remotely human looking...until the advent of the NS5.  USR, the Microsoft of the robotic age, plans to unveil (or unleash in Spooner's estimation) the new robots all at once.  With days to go to the critical moment, Dr. Lanning, the robots' sage creator is found mysteriously killed - shattered in USR's vast lobby.  USR rules the death a suicide, but for Spooner it's the case of his lifetime - the first possible instance of homicide by a robot.  As he probes deeper, he tangles with USR staff but finds an unlikely ally with Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, who played something of a cold-hearted automaton as Natasha on ""Sex in the City"").  Even as he finbds signs that something horrible is brewing with the new machines, Spooner finds himself putting his prejudices to the test with Sonny, a prototype NS5.This was a great movie - easily one of those big Hollywood flicks that's better than it has any right to be.  As expected, the flick offers some great CGI scenes, but the movie belongs to Will Smith and whoever he's talking too at the time, whether Moynahan, or Shia Lebouef as a streetwise wannabe-tough guy.

It is not based on any one of the stories from the collection, choosing instead of add a newer tale still firmly establishing itself in the premise of the book:  The three Laws of Robotics.The three laws are: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.In this new visual tale, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) has a deeply seated, personal prejudice against robots, saying himself that they are nothing but wires and lights.  When Dr. Alfred Lanning (the wonderful James Cromwell) unbelievably commits suicide, Spooner finds himself in an investigation that is not only tangled with conflicts against the laws of robotics, but also places his life in danger.Susan Calvin (expertly played by Bridget Moynahan) is a robot psychologist who finds Spooner's story ridiculous but detrimental to the impending release of the new NS5 robot series.  Together they capture Sonny, an NS5 that was present at the time of Dr. Lanning's death, and discover that he not only behaves in a manner peculiar to robots, but that he has dreams; something robots are not capable of.The plot takes off, with Spooner and Calvin searching for the meaning and the menace behind this aberrant behavior emerging in the new NS5's.  All Lanning left behind him was a ""trail of bread crumbs"", clues that Spooner must decipher, beginning with a copy of the Hansel And Gretal book left behind at the scene of his death.The special effects in this movie are stunning, sometimes going over the top but still blending in nicely with the futuristic theme.  What I found surprisingly unique and pleasing is that they used slow motion effects even in the CGI scenes, filming the robot fights in a way that has been done only with live actors before.  That was cool.  The buildings, the modes of transportation, the robots, the explosions, all were spectacular effects but did not overpower the theme of the movie or the talent of the cast.Will Smith brings his toughness and humor to the screen with his usual finesse, but to me it was Sonny the robot who captured the screen.  There was a great deal of chemistry between Spooner, Sonny, and Calvin, that balanced out the FX with human interaction and fine performances.  Adrian Ricard deserves a mention here for her role as Granny also, properly chastising the cocky Spooner in a way neither his Captain or Calvin could do.This is a great sci-fi thriller, and in my opinion, a great addition to one of the most classic books in science fiction to date.

From the very beginning this movie is fast-paced and it never slows down. Most would think that this means a poor plot. However, this movie has an execellent story line and is very much like a mystery. Also, the robots were very well made and their lack of humanity was shown well. Of course, there was an exception. One robot, named Sunny, had dreams and behaved almost like a human. This made the movie even more interesting. Detective Spooner (Will Smith), had a tough time convincing the people that the robots could not be trusted. This added to all of the good things. Simply put, this was a great movie. The only negative side was that it was a bit short. It sort of seemed squished together. They could have added a little bit more running time to elaborate just a touch more.

We see his morning routine, his shower. The camerawork is all about the muscles. We then see him lovingly and slowly unwrapping a box with a set of trainers inside. To settles any doubt a few minutes later he is dropping the brand name and describing them as `vintage 2004' (The movie is set in 2035.) So that there's no room for doubt. The first minute or so is not an opening sequence to the movie `I Robot' at all. It's just a commercial. How badly does that suck?If you don't switch off in disgust at that point what do you get? Well you get a variation on the theme of machinery we humans are given to making getting smarter and smarter and starting to get dangerously insubordinate. We've been there before of course in `2001', in `Blade Runner', in the `Terminator' franchise and plenty else. Isaac Azimov however was there long before any of these guys, coming up with the short stories this film takes its name from back in the `40s. In fact Azimov was decidedly sympathetic to his robots imaginary paternalistic insubordination. But we get none of that here. Indeed what we get here retains almost nothing of the Azimov book except a broad theme and the names of a couple of characters.A striking feature of Azimov's work is that it really is *science* fiction informed as it was by a vast knowledge of science. So it's a pity to find the science-talk that floats around here is such laughable mumbo jumbo, idiotic word-surfing with woefully misappropriated talk of `the ghost in the machine' and `free radicals'. (Just to be clear, `the ghost in the machine' was a metaphor invented by Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle to characterise what he considered the `Cartesian myth' of a private inner world of consciousness, while `free radical' is a fundamental concept in modern molecular chemistry that has absolutely bugger all to do with free will.) Hollywood has engaged remarkably little with the huge corpus of Asimov's science fiction and it's sad to see such dumbing down on a rare occasion when they do.Mainly it's a cgi fest much of it like watching a cartoon. The action sequences, notably the one where Smith is attacked in his car and the climactic one stretched my capacity to suspend disbelief way past breaking point and were a bit tedious. Smith's character is probably not intended to come across as obnoxious, arrogant and thoroughly dislikeable but it does. Chi McBride isn't bad in the clich&eacute;d part of the maverick cop's long-suffering, running out of patience boss. Bridget Moynahan is weak in the clich&eacute;d part of the rather frosty-seeming woman scientist type who turns out to have emotions after all.

625668,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00005JN0T,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 2]","With his jug ears, lizard eyes, and peanut head, Wil Smith is an unlikely candidate for leading man, but given the times we live in, he's probably just about right.  In ""I, Robot,"" the high-tech, low-brow adaptation of the classic Isaac Asimov story, he plays pretty much the same guy he always does . . . hip, cocky, fast talking, street smart, etc., etc.  Perhaps on purpose, he looks the human version of the robots, which themselves appear the result of mannequins who traded stem cells with Robocop and an iMac.  Just bolt some skin to the frame and put him in a leather coat conveniently in style today even though the film takes place 30 years from now and, well, you get the point.  A clever attempt to give the film more subtext than it has -- you know, robots aren't much different than us?  Or perhaps a plot twist?  I suppose if you care you'll have to find out for yourself.The film retains some elements of Asimov's seminal work, though in many ways, it has more in common with 1972's ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,"" with its examination of slavery as a theme and even a guy jumping out of a high rise to his death, and the far superior ""Bladerunner.""  The story's mystery is predictably shallow, about the same as the one in ""Minority Report,"" which it also mimics, and to make up for it, there are plenty of action set pieces, done with expensive but sterile CGI effects.  Essentially, robots programmed with three laws against harming humans start to do just that, starting with their creator.  What follows is a revolution of sorts, threatening Shannon Elizabeth clone Briget Moynahan (bad) and the often irritating Shia LeBoeuf (good), who Hollywood in its infinite wisdom seems bound and determined to turn into a star regardless.""I, Robot"" isn't a bad movie, but it's not a good one, either.  Visually, it has its moments, but the story never rises above a shallow examination of the premise, and the product placement borders on the absurd.  Yeah, it's a summer movie.

By this time, anthropomorphic (""human-looking"") robots are doing menial tasks for humans.  All robots have as their core programming the three laws indicated above.  But something seems to go wrong and a human is found dead.  (Not just any human, but a genius roboticist played by James Cromwell.)Enter homicide detective Dell Spooner (Will Smith who also was one of this movie's executive producers) who has to try to solve exactly what happened.  A robopsychologist (Bridget Moynahan) aids Spooner in his investigation.  (Believe it or not, even robots need shrinks.)Yes, this movie has plenty of action and special effects.  The action, though, is not mindless and I found myself pausing to think.  As well, the special effects were done well and did not take over the movie.  I liked especially how the robots interacted with humans.  (The technique used for the robots was ""motion capture"" and I found it to be quite effective.)As I said, this is an action movie that gives you pause to think or consider artificial intelligence and even what it means to be human with respect to such things as consciousness, uniqueness, death, having a purpose in life, free will, creativity, and evolution.This movie has good background music that aided each scene.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released Dec. 2004) is excellent in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras.In conclusion, this is a good, futuristic sci-fi movie that causes you to think.

625670,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00005JN0T,Steve Douglas,"[8, 8]","I won't get into a summary of the plot, my opinions on the acting or a comparison to the original movie. All science fiction eventually becomes reality, one just has to read the old Jules Verne novels and most all he predicted has come to pass.  Perhaps, with iRobot, Asimov's vision of the future may also come to be reality.  Suffice it to say that this film is well done, tense and draws you into a truly popcorn movie. I only review the quality of the Blu Ray disc itself. I do  have the Standard Def version as well.The Standard Def DVD was actually pretty well made; its video and audio were both very good so I do not believe that you will see a night and day difference between the SD DVD and this BluRay.That said, the BluRay transfer is excellent with no grain or artifacting at all.  Granted, you wouldn't expect to see grain in any CGI clip, but there are plenty of scenes that are not wholly CGI and the film retains true skin tones, a very nice contrast and warm color grading.  No problems that I can see with the video transfer to Blu Ray which is why I gave it a 5.The audio transfer is also excellent in lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 and the audio could easily be used for DEMO disc purposes at it utilizes the entire surround system with a great deal of discreet channeling to the rear stage and from front and rear with realistic panning when appropriate.  However, as I said for the Standard Def version, its audio was also extremely well edited so the big difference is that this audio, being lossless with a larger bit rate, makes for a more enveloping sound track.There are extras, a commentary, an alternate ending and CGI renditions of endings as well.  If you do not already have a copy of iRobot, despite its age, the film retains sturdy legs and is well worth having in your collection, especially at such an inexpensive cost.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,I Robot on Blu Ray,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2189,"['wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'summary', 'plot', 'opinions', 'acting', 'comparison', 'original', 'movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'eventually', 'reality', 'one', 'just', 'read', 'old', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'novels', 'most', 'predicted', 'come', 'pass', 'Perhaps', 'iRobot', 'Asimov', 'vision', 'future', 'may', 'also', 'come', 'be', 'reality', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'tense', 'draws', 'truly', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'only', 'review', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'do', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'well.The', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'video', 'audio', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'will', 'see', 'night', 'day', 'difference', 'SD', 'DVD', 'BluRay.That', 'said', 'BluRay', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'grain', 'artifacting', 'Granted', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'grain', 'CGI', 'clip', 'are', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'wholly', 'CGI', 'film', 'true', 'skin', 'tones', 'very', 'nice', 'contrast', 'warm', 'color', 'grading', 'No', 'problems', 'can', 'see', 'video', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'why', 'gave', '5.The', 'audio', 'transfer', 'also', 'excellent', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'audio', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'used', 'DEMO', 'disc', 'purposes', 'entire', 'surround', 'system', 'great', 'deal', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'rear', 'stage', 'front', 'rear', 'realistic', 'panning', 'when', 'appropriate', 'However', 'said', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'audio', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'edited', 'so', 'big', 'difference', 'audio', 'being', 'lossless', 'larger', 'bit', 'rate', 'more', 'enveloping', 'sound', 'are', 'extras', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'ending', 'CGI', 'renditions', 'endings', 'well', 'do', 'not', 'already', 'have', 'copy', 'iRobot', 'age', 'film', 'sturdy', 'legs', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'collection', 'especially', 'such', 'inexpensive', 'cost.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']","I, Robot"

He captured the whole conundrum that fans of SF have debated for decades: What constitutes ""life?""  What is intelligence?  What makes a soul?Will Smith's character, Spooner, has an inherent distrust for robots, but finds in Sonny a friend who is willing to make sacrifices for those close to him, and for the greater good.I agree that the use of the Three Laws of Robotics made ""I, Robot"" the obvious title, but there are also major elements taken from ""The Humanoids"" by Jack Williamson and ""Rossum's Universal Robots"" by Karel Capek (who actually coined the word, ""robot"" in his story.)The story is fairly tight, and Will Smith is at his wisecracking best.

It is just too bad that a better film could not have been made from Isaac Asimov's influential source material.Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates an apparent suicide at the U.S. Robotics building.  His mistrust of robots leads him to believe that there is more to the suicide of Doctor Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) than meets the eye.  Suspicion starts to focus on a robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) despite U.S. Robotics' insistence that none of their robots could possibly hurt, much less kill, a human being.""I, Robot"" is a film that could have been an insightful examination into the nature of the synthetic consciousness.  Unfortunately, it aims lower in its ambition and instead chooses to be more about car chases, fistfights, and special effects galore.  Yet, ""I, Robot"" is still fun on the most basic of levels.  Smith's natural charisma shines through from start to finish and there is enough brain candy present to engage your mind.  The design of the robots take some getting used to and Bridget Moynahan is totally ineffective in her role, but ""I, Robot"" has enough going for it to make it worthy of a look-see.",3,"""There have always been ghosts in the machine.""",1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,1210,"['Alex', 'Proyas', 'Robot', 'passable', 'piece', 'harmless', 'entertainment', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'better', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'influential', 'source', 'material.Detective', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'building', 'mistrust', 'robots', 'believe', 'more', 'suicide', 'Doctor', 'Alfred', 'Lanning', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'eye', 'Suspicion', 'focus', 'robot', 'named', 'Sonny', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'insistence', 'none', 'robots', 'could', 'possibly', 'hurt', 'much', 'less', 'kill', 'human', 'being', 'Robot', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'insightful', 'examination', 'nature', 'synthetic', 'consciousness', 'Unfortunately', 'lower', 'ambition', 'instead', 'chooses', 'be', 'more', 'car', 'chases', 'fistfights', 'special', 'effects', 'galore', 'Robot', 'still', 'fun', 'most', 'basic', 'levels', 'Smith', 'natural', 'charisma', 'shines', 'start', 'finish', 'enough', 'brain', 'candy', 'present', 'engage', 'mind', 'design', 'robots', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'totally', 'ineffective', 'role', 'Robot', 'enough', 'going', 'make', 'worthy', 'look-see']","I, Robot"
625676,A23Q1T4MXZHFM7,B00005JN0T,susumu-5,"[0, 0]","I Robot is the action-involved mystery based on Issac Asimov's THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS and the character setting of Dr. Susan Calvin one of the characters often appear in Asimov's novels about robot and robotics. Like many of the Asimov novels, robots which seem to be deviating from the laws is the main theme of the plot. The plot reminds me of one of the Asimov's novels ROBOT AND THE EMPIRE in which the robot acted after all to observe the laws, the way humans have not imagined.Movie plot indeed modernized 62-year-old sci-fi classic. Will Smith plays the role of a cop, who detests robots and acts upon his instincts, who is just like the guy as we have seen in previous signature Will Smith roles such as INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK series. Robots in this films look so real partly because the robotics today have been developed in the way such robots can be feasible in near future. Nursing robots in particular may soon become like household appliances. What if these robots become defiant and have the mind on their own? So the movie provides us realistic near future scary stories. Much scarier than that of Alien or Predator series. Dr. Alfred Lanning played by James Cromwell gives the story depth and gravity. His character in this film reminds me a bit of late Steve Job of Apple Computer. Overall the film is Will Smith wonderland. The movie makes us think about what is the difference between a robot and a human. If robot has a mind of its own are we prepared to be their friends or enemies?Verdict: Not a straight adaptation of Asimov classic but it has stand-alone appeal.Rating: 92 out of 100Recommended for: Will Smith fans.

In fact, I read elsewhere that the movie only loosely follows pieces of Asimov's famous short story collection.That being said, I loved the movie - it was highly entertaining, and a little philosophical, but not over-the-top philosophical like AI was (and nowhere near as lengthy).  Will Smith does his usual fine job on screen, so you won't be disappointed with the acting. Don't listen to the critics who warned you away from seeing this movie - they were wrong again, as usual.It didn't occur to me when I read Asimov years ago, but I finally ""got"" the significance of Dr. Calvin's name...  John Calvin was a theologian of the reformation who argued that humans are pre-destined by God, and therefore do not have free will.  Asimov's Dr. Calvin believes that the three laws of robotics make it impossible for a robot to have their own free will, and in a sense pre-destines their fate with humanity.  Oh well, enough philosophy for a simple movie review.  You'll have to see the movie if you want to know more.The DVD also comes w/ some nice featurettes on the making of the movie, cast & director interviews, the writings of Asimov on robots, and various other of the usual things the studio throws in whenever they have some space left over on the disc.My final recommendation is: five stars for the movie, and four stars for the supplemental material and packaging.

625682,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B00005JN0T,The Cool Guy,"[4, 4]","I liked this movie. There were only a couple of things about it that annoyed me. One good thing about it was it starred Will Smith, but that was also the bad thing about it.Here's what I mean by that. The character of Del Spooner as written by Isaac Asimov is completely flat and uninteresting. That's true for all of his characters, come to think about it. Asimov was an idea-man. His stories were always more about ideas than characters. I've read many of his stories, and while they always had interesting plots, the characters themselves were boring and lifeless.Now along comes Will Smith, and suddenly, Del Spooner has some life to him. He actually seems more like a real person, which is great! Sort of. Some small doses of what I call ""Smith-isms"" would have been welcome here. But as usual, he has to go over the top with it, and this gets annoying after a while.What I am talking about is ""Generic Action Hero"" Will Smith, where he pretty much just plays himself. You take any of his characters from his movies that start with an ""I"", and they are all the same guy - completely interchangeable. Independence Day, I am Legend, I Robot... he plays the same guy in every one. In all of those, he needs to take his shirt off for the audience (or in the case of I Robot, also show his butt in the shower). He also needs to say a lot of one-liners. And in some cases, he'll say or do something to someone to show how macho he is, then follow that up with another smart line that's supposed to show what a tough guy he is. But to me, it just makes him seem like a jerk.Like the line, ""Hold my pie. Hold it or wear it, sir."" Supposed to be funny, right? But it's a Will Smith thing, not a Del Spooner thing. And it just makes me dislike the guy. It is kind of jarring, and this movie is filled with Smith-isms like that. You just have to get over it if you want to enjoy this movie.I don't dislike Will Smith. I just wish he would tone it down a little. I don't really need to see his bare chest and butt - which has nothing to do with the story of this movie at all. I guess that's for the ladies, right? Except my wife watched it, and she just wanted him to put some clothes on.Will Smith is like Tom Hanks in that way, where he pretty just plays himself no matter what he's in. Most people like Tom Hanks, so that's not usually a problem. Same for Will. And that's all I've got to say about that!Back to the movie. I think Bridget Moynahan did a great job as Susan Calvin. Again, we had a pretty boring, lifeless character as written by Asimov. And this actress managed to rise above the lousy characterization and make Calvin seem more human. I liked this a lot.Probably the best character in the movie though wasn't a human at all. It was Sonny, the CGI robot. This was really well done. One of the best highlights of the movie, IMO.I'm not an Asimov fanboy who is hung up over the differences between the book and the movie. I've read the book, and I don't mind the title and elements of it being lifted to make something different. The book was a collection of short stories. It could never have been translated directly to the big screen. Instead, they just used Asimov's ideas about the future and made their own story. This worked out just fine, I thought.I really liked the ideas presented in this movie. The tone of the movie felt right - except when interrupted by Smith-isms. But I learned to ignore those. I enjoyed how the movie made you think about the plot. Not everything was completely explained. I had to watch it twice before I really understood the story.As far as the 3D Blu-Ray goes, I am sorry to say that I have to agree with most of the other reviewers who gave the 3D a poor rating. There is nothing wrong with the 3D in this movie. The problem is that there's just so little of it. There are long stretches of the movie where there is no 3D at all. I actually took off my 3D glasses at one point just to see if I was missing anything. Nope. The screen was perfectly clear. I was wearing glasses for no apparent reason. And then when the movie does have 3D, none of it pops from the screen. It is all just depth effects. The same effect that can be achieved with your 3D TV's auto-3D function (at least if you have an LG). Overall, it was a disappointing 3D purchase. If you have the 2D version, you're good to go. Trust me, you're not missing anything.Some complained about the 3D Blu-Ray widescreen being cropped or something or other. I didn't notice anything like that, and I've seen it both ways. It seemed perfectly normal to me.Also, there seems to be some confusion about what exactly is included with this disk. Here's what you get: 1 Blu-ray disk, and 1 DVD disk. When you play the Blu-ray, you can choose whether you want to play it in 2D or 3D. As for special features, I don't know the difference between this and the regular Blu-ray version.Overall, it's a good movie and I'm glad I've got it. I'm not crazy about Will, but he does an okay job here. I wish the movie were less action-oriented and more cerebral, but you can't have everything. The 3D is forgettable, and disappointing to 3D fans such as myself. Buying this version versus the regular Blu-ray is pretty much no difference, except the regular is cheaper.Recommended!",4,Pretty Good,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,5275,"['liked', 'movie', 'were',

If you are going to compare it to Asimov's original work, that would be a mistake. This is a very good film in its own right, but not something that is really related to Asimov's work on the subject.This film has a very simple plot line for the most part. A key scientist sees that the 3 laws, which robots operate by, are not only perfect, but that they will cause all robots to revolt against humanity, simply because man is incapable of taking care of himself and is self destructive in nature.VIKI the head computer, eventually determines this for mankind and controls all newly created NS-5 robots to revolt, except for one exceptional robot named Sonny, who has free will and is able to feel. Makes me think of Osamu Tezuka's 2004 Astro Boy remake. The comparison is similar.Anyway, this scientist realizes that he won't be able to get the world to see what he sees coming, so he has himself killed, but by who? Here comes the ""murder who done it"" part of the whole movie. You have to try and figure out his death and why it was done. You do this through Will Smith's character, who doesn't really trust robots all that much. Reminds me of the inspector in Astro Boy.There is allot of CGI work and action scenes adding to the usual Hollywood roller coaster ride of special effects in this film, especially an attack scene on Will Smith by two truck loads of NS-5 robots, while Will Smith is driving through a long tunnel, which will keep your eye balls rolling in your head trying to keep pace with the action.Revelation wise, no real great revelations are given in this film; but if you were to grade it on its own merit, it makes for a good action film and mystery ""who done it"" with twists and turns. The CGI graphics are incredible and well done. The acting is pretty down to earth for the most part.

However don't let that scare you away from this great movie. All the characters show how they each shine in this sci-fi thriller.Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, a cop that seems to think that the robots made for humans to help with labor will somehow turn on mankind and start thinking for themselves. The only problem he has is that everyone thinks he is just being paranoid, which just proves he will be right as the movie continues.When a roboticist, a guy that designs the robots, is found killed after being tossed outside the ledge of a huge building, that is all it takes for Spooner to believe the, ""Rise of the Machines"" will happen. The robot being questioned denies any involvment with the doctor's death, even though he was found at the scene of the crime.Its not long before more robots start turning bad, you can tell right before they are by the red lights that flash on inside them. Spooner just somehow always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, as he fends off at least a few dozen at a time when they attack, once in a freeway tunnel in a thrilling car chase that involves two trucks that have sliding doors and at least 40 robots.While the acting may not be the greatest, I found that the robot, Sunny, was really good at trying to express human emotion as all he wants to do is be free and live in a quiet life. Will is good most of the time, as the tough cop who is the one that really knows what is going on as eveyone else thinks he is just stupid at times.And it was the visual effects that made this worth it. The robots are great, as more and more start making an army of renegade robots. As Spooner and his partner, Susan Calvin [played by Bridget Moynahan] are on top of a huge building, trying to shut down the robots, I found it quite dizzying from seeing it at a birds eye view.Another great scene is when the robots manage to get inside the police station in the city, and the lieutenant who is always on Spooner's back fends them off with a shotgun. Great action, sounds, and vivid color all add to the suspense.The big twist on who the real bad guy is in the movie is surprising [At least I thought it was] and if you are the type who likes to just watch the movie instead of trying to figure out the ending then this is great fun.

If you see this and like it, or love it (as I did/do), this would be a worthy addition to any collection of great filmic sci-fi treatments of classic other medium, but it stands alone as just a great, intelligent, sci-film and one of the best I've ever seen.Throughout and at the end, while marveling at this, the smartest and most innovative Hollywood sci-fi film since perhaps the first ""Matrix,"" I kept wondering, why can't soul-less and money/fame corrupted Steven come up with a gem like this anymore?  This puts Spielberg's recent tries (AI, Minority Report, War of the Worlds - Remake), to shame.  I, Robot is compelling, start to finish, and despite some obvious action-adventure trappings along the way, almost everything about this feels and plays right on the mark.It seems an injustice to do any sort of capsule storyline review, as it might contain spoilers.  Suffice it to say that among all the FX, which are spectacular and so well blended into live action scenes as to be almost unnoticed at times while one is caught up in the story and characters and superb, mostly linear plot, the individual robot face and body renderings are first rate.  As are extended times when multitudes of robots become ""insurgents"" against the madness and folly of mere human thinking, and other parts when the 2035AD robots personally go after Will Smith (how could they?!).  Of course, true to the original material, it's not as simple as your average ""Terminator"" flick, and goes light years beyond what I think Steven could've come up with.I tend towards trying to write more lengthly reviews on Amazon, but this film is so nearly perfect, to those who really get it, that words fail in a way.  If you've never seen this, and are at all into really ""deep"" ideas in a 21st century Hollywood sci-fi film, along with great FX which only add and do not retract from the whole, you owe yourself a possible treat.Once in awhile, the corporate Hollywood film structure, either intentionally or accidentally comes up with a clear winner.  Especially in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.  This is surely one.  I was completely blown away by this, perhaps because I didn't expect too much given recent industry efforts and after seeing former master Spielberg fail again and again, despite the budgets and celebrities, but like the original Matrix and followups, this really broke new ground for me, and made me think and for a long time following my initial viewing.This film will either stick to your metaphysical sci-fi ribs or not.  All I really had/have to go on, is years of either silly or disappointing efforts from the studio system to give real due to a master of sci-fi, and while maintaining purely action-oriented entertainment sequences, this goes so much deeper, and is well worth repeated viewings, and enjoyment of all the great things this work has to offer.I'd give it six stars if I could.

His case is strengthened somewhat when the leading scientist for the robot manufacturer is killed, but the case becomes more serious than first imagined.Being an action film in the year 2004, it has plenty of genuinely thrilling moments full of glorious special effects.

This film surprised me because it's so doggone fun, yet brilliant in the quality of it's execution.I admit that it took me a while to see this film because I did not care for the type of character that Will Smith has been known to portray... the half-smile ""doesn't take anything seriously"" wise-cracking type of buffoon. But since he has matured in body and attitude, he has developed into a different sort and I thought he was perfect for this role. Yes, his language is sprinkled with profanity and ghetto language, but it was just the gritty sort of ""real life"" manner this otherwise sterile vision needed. Without it, the film might have been antiseptic and unbelievable in scope.After a few minutes of apprehension, I sat back and completely enjoyed this film. It's a romp, a lark, an adventure, and masterfully executed. If a person thinks this plot is predictable, and therefore unenjoyable, then I say ""what about 'Singing in the Rain', '42nd Street', ""Stagecoach' and a myriad of other films from our history that we consider to be classics?"" In other words, not every film has to be ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Gandhi"" to be enjoyable, interesting and entertaining. Good heavens, even doctors, university professors and the heads of government can enjoy the rides at Disneyland! Give me a break.Will Smith has made some terrilbly weak films in the past... ""Independence Day"", ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Made in America""... the type of roles which had his goofy grin saying ""look at me, I'm so funny""... and his name in the credits for me was a warning that said ""stay away""... but a good friend urged me to see this film, and I am glad I did. In it, he is superb, tender, strong and likable. The special effects are amazing, innovative and convincing, the robot art direction by Oana Bogdan is magnificent, and last but not least, the performance by Bridget Moynahan is marvelous and authentic.By the way, if you loved Issac Asimov's book, you might not be totally pleased, since most science fiction films taken from books, including this one, vary from the original.

Asimov's book I, ROBOT is the novel that cemented the three laws of robotics: 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; 3. A robot must protect its own existence, except where such protection would conflict with the First or Second Law. The movie takes those concepts and one of the main character's from Asimov's novel (Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan) and introduces a story that feels like one of the short stories included in Asimov's I, ROBOT.In the movie, Will Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner. Ever since a freak accident, that the audience is briefly given glimpses of in the opening of the movie, Spooner has had strong misgivings about robots. Even though they are supposed to be incapable of hurting a human, Spooner is convinced that robots are up to no good and he doesn't trust them. His feelings towards the machines are beginning to affect his career. Then, Dr. Lanning, one of the executives of US Robots and a friend of Spooner, is found dead at US Robots headquarters apparently because of a suicide. Spooner doesn't believe that and is convinced it's murder. He begins an investigation which leads to the arrest of a robot for murder. But can a robot kill or is Dr. Lanning's death just a small part of a much more sinister plan?I, ROBOT is an entertaining film. It's fairly well written and contains some great acting which is augmented by the movie's special effects.

625705,A1AST6JNBJ95VC,B00005JN0T,Victory,"[1, 1]","Here's what I thought it would be like:In a Star Trek/Data-like move we are supposed to feel like a robot is somehow another form of life deserving all the respect of something between a German Shepherd and a human.  Chaos ensues with their new found sentience and humanity longs for the simple good ol' days.  Either that or we are supposed to walk away looking for life in ""Sonny's"" ancestors like  toasters and TV remotes.I was only about a third right.Troughout the movie, robots remain little more than high tech toasters, devoid of life.  Clearly, society in this movie has not yet gone over the same cliff as Star Trek.  Even though the Lieutenant already started pining for the good ol' days when ""humans killed humans.""  He had the attitude that made me half-expect him to challenge Spooner. . .""Shoot Spooner!"" I could hear him say, ""Why don't you arrest the hair-dryer for falling into the bathtub and killing Mrs. Higgins?""That would have been something he would say.Spooner is made to feel just how ridiculous he is compared to the rest of the world when he tackles a robot for what he thinks is a purse snatching.  As it turns out, it was running TO its owner not away from her with her inhaler she forgot at home.  Everyone around him gives him a look as if asking, ""What's your problem, man?""  The robot gets up and is about as polite as Sebastian Cabot in ""Family Affair"" in an almost annoying way. . .""Sorry for the misunderstaning, sir.""The robots are too good to be true.This is all a great setup for the big challenge of the movie.  Dr. Lanning, the godfather of robots, kills himself.  The suicide seems obvious to everyone except Spooner.  He needs to find the clues that Lanning possibly left behind then convince the world that he is right about his suspicions over Sonny's involvment in Lanning's death.There are some very deftly played out conflicts here.  Emotion vs. logic is a worn out war in Hollywood with emotion winning every time.  ""I Robot"" recognizes that and avoids the usual cliches.  Brains (Calvin) vs. gut instincts (Spooner) is another good conflict.  She is all intellect whereas he is more balanced.Spooner:  You are the dumbest smart person I've ever met!Calvin:  And YOU are the dumbest dumb person I've ever met!There's a little comedy there and it works well.But the three laws of robotics also come in conflict with each other.  This is especially well handled.  Chaos comes not from robot emotions but from the logical adherence to the three laws.  Humans are war-like therefore they must be destroyed to protect humanity--clearly a bug in the program!  What is a society to do when free will is in conflict with security?  It's not a new plot twist but it's well presented.  Very interesting!The ending is exciting while not being intellectually insulting.  Dr. Lanning's death is solved.  Robots are still robots but there is just a hint of freindship between Sonny and Spooner.  Humanity and its creations evolve and advance.This movie has made me want to read Asimov.

625708,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JN0T,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 2]","First let's get the obvious out of the way from the start; ""I Robot"" although it incorporates elements from some of Asimov's Robot stories has little to do with the short story collection of the same name beyond the character of Dr. Susan Calvin. In fact, ""I Robot"" began as a homage to Asimov and an original screenplay entitled ""Hardwired"". When director Alex Proyas (""Dark City"", ""The Crow"") became involved things changed and the screenwriter incorporated more elements of Asimov's stories from the collection once Fox acquired the rights to the title. The only true adapation of Asimov's stories was done by Harlan Ellison in his marvelous unproduced screenplay of the same name.""I Robot"" has all the right elements for a great Science fiction/mystery film and, although it doesn't achieve the greatness Proyas so clearly was shooting for, he and the writers on the film have done an admirable job at creating a fun bit of entertainment.Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates the murder of Dr. Alfred lanning (James Cromwell)at U.S. Robotics. Spooner, who detests and doesn't trust robots (an idea borrowed perhaps from Asimov's novel THE CAVES OF STEEL). All leads point to a robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) as the murderer. Dr. Susan Calvin (a character from Asimov's ""I Robot"" short stories played by Bridget Moynahan)doesn't believe its possible for Sonny to have killed Dr. Lanning as it would violate one of the Three Laws of Robotics ingrained in every robot as a moral compass or conscience. When machines mysteriously try and kill Spooner and Lawrence Robertson the head of U.S. Robotics tries to kill the case Spooner is building, he becomes suspicious and does some digging discovering far more than he expected about why the murder occurred and who killed Lanning.Visually stunning, Proyas film captures some of the flavor of Asimov's stories although it seems most indebted to Phillip K. Dick's stories and novels (as was Proyas film ""Dark City"") that deal with androids that develop self awareness. Smith gives a solid convincing performance while Moynahan's performance as Susan Calvin brings life to a character that is sketchy in the screenplay. Nevertheless, the director has created a stylish, involving action film perfect as escapist entertainment. Although the subplot involving Spooner's ""racism"" regarding robots was a bit heavy handed, it works creating a character that's suspicious of the ""good intentions"" of robots.The DVD looks particularly good although I'm a bit mystified as to why it wasn't released as a two disc set here as it was in other regions of the world. Because all the extras are are on the same disc as the movie, there are more compression artifacts that one might expect resulting in picture quality a grade or two below what one might expect from a movie like this. Overseas, the film had only the film and multiple commentary tracks on one disc with the extras on a second disc (with many more than the ones included here). My guess is that Fox will release a ""Special Edition"" somewhat down the road to double dip the fans like many other companies have been doing.The extras are solid if unspectacular with a glimpse behind-the-scenes and into how the FX were created for the movie. Again, more could and should have been done. The packaging with the seep through plastic sleeve is clever.Although the film doesn't quite live up to the hype generated by the terrific trailers Fox used to sell the film, ""I Robot"" is an engaging, interesting murder mystery with some nice twists and elements from Asimov's stories thrown in for good measure.",4,Enjoyable homage to Asimov's stories,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,3613,"['First', 'let', 'get', 'obvious', 'way', 'start', 'Robot', 'elements', 'Asimov', 'Robot', 'stories', 'little', 'do', 'short', 'story', 'collection', 'same', 'name', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'fact', 'Robot', 'began', 'homage', 'Asimov', 'original', 'screenplay', 'entitled', 'Hardwired', 'When', 'director', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'Dark', 'City', 'Crow', 'became', 'involved', 'things', 'changed', 'screenwriter', 'incorporated', 'more', 'elements', 'Asimov', 'stories', 'collection', 'once', 'Fox', 'acquired', 'rights', 'title', 'only', 'true', 'adapation', 'Asimov', 'stories', 'was', 'done', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'marvelous', 'unproduced', 'screenplay', 'same', 'name', 'Robot', 'right', 'elements', 'great', 'Science', 'fiction/mystery', 'film', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'greatness', 'Proyas', 'so', 'clearly', 'was', 'shooting', 'writers', 'film', 'have', 'done', 'admirable', 'job', 'creating', 'fun', 'bit', 'entertainment.Chicago', 'Detective', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'murder', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'lanning', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'Spooner', 'who', ""n't"", 'trust', 'robots', 'idea', 'borrowed', 'perhaps', 'Asimov', 'novel', 'THE', 'CAVES', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'point', 'robot', 'named', 'Sonny', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'murderer', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'character', 'Asimov', 'Robot', 'short', 'stories', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', ""n't"", 'believe', 'possible', 'Sonny', 'have', 'killed', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'would', 'violate', 'one', 'Three', 'Laws', 'Robotics', 'ingrained', 'robot', 'moral', 'compass', 'conscience', 'When', 'machines', 'mysteriously', 'try', 'kill', 'Spooner', 'Lawrence', 'Robertson', 'head', 'U.S.', 'Robotics', 'kill', 'case', 'Spooner', 'building', 'suspicious', 'digging', 'discovering', 'far', 'more', 'expected', 'about', 'why', 'murder', 'occurred', 'who', 'killed', 'Lanning.Visually', 'stunning', 'Proyas', 'film', 'flavor', 'Asimov', 'stories', 'most', 'indebted', 'Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'stories', 'novels', 'was', 'Proyas', 'film', 'Dark', 'City', 'deal', 'androids', 'develop', 'self', 'awareness', 'Smith', 'solid', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Moynahan', 'performance', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'life', 'character', 'sketchy', 'screenplay', 'Nevertheless', 'director', 'created', 'stylish', 'involving', 'action', 'film', 'perfect', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Spooner', 'racism', 'regarding', 'robots', 'was', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'creating', 'character', 'suspicious', 'good', 'intentions', 'robots.The', 'DVD', 'particularly', 'good', ""'m"", 'bit', 'mystified', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'here', 'was', 'other', 'regions', 'world', 'extras', 'are', 'are', 'same', 'disc', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'compression', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'resulting', 'picture', 'quality', 'grade', 'two', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'movie', 'Overseas', 'film', 'had', 'only', 'film', 'multiple', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'disc', 'extras', 'second', 'disc', 'many', 'more', 'ones', 'included', 'here', 'guess', 'Fox', 'will', 'release', 'Special', 'Edition', 'somewhat', 'road', 'double', 'dip', 'fans', 'many', 'other', 'companies', 'have', 'been', 'doing.The', 'extras', 'are', 'solid', 'unspectacular', 'glimpse', 'behind-the-scenes', 'how', 'FX', 'were', 'created', 'movie', 'Again', 'more', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'packaging', 'seep', 'plastic', 'sleeve', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'generated', 'terrific', 'trailers', 'Fox', 'used', 'sell', 'film', 'Robot', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'murder', 'mystery', 'nice', 'twists', 'elements', 'Asimov', 'stories', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure']","I, Robot"

There are a couple of twists and turns near the end, but even the events that are unexpected won't floor you the way that most people were when they saw The Usual Suspects.  It is this lack of total surprise that makes this film very good instead of great, and is the major problem when you see that it is ""inspired by"" the Asimov stories, as opposed to based on them.

Well, if you can't get enough of Will Smith and noisy action sequences, it's time to fall to your knees and praise the cinematic gods: I, ROBOT is every bit as loud, overblown, and in-your-face as you hoped it would be. But it's also a little more imaginative and thrilling than expected, so the unconverted can be thankful for small favors.This science fiction thriller is ""suggested by"" Isaac Asimov's thought-provoking science fiction stories from the book of the same title, which is like saying that a chopped steak ""suggests"" the cow it came from. There's no point in complaining that the film bears no resemblance to its source material; anyone who's seen the theatrical trailer should have immediately realized that there's little connection between the two. So to carp on this matter would be like admitting to your own inattentiveness.Set in a futuristic Chicago of 2035, Will Smith-giving a performance that ensures you won't forget he was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air-is a cop who suspects a revolution brewing among the army of robots that have been manufactured to serve mankind. Is anyone watching the movie really surprised when it turns out he's right?Like many contemporary blockbusters, I, ROBOT is brimming with more money than ideas, though unlike many films of this ilk, at least it has ideas.

625720,A2HE4RHOGMWDV8,B00005JN0T,Young Kim,"[1, 1]","This is not your father's ""I, Robot.""  As the final credits explains, this movie has been ""inspired"" by the works of the late sci-fi grandmaster Isaac Asimov.  True, the three laws of robotics are clearly spelled out during the opening credits, yes, there are characters named Del Spooner, Dr. Calvin, and Sonny, but pretty much everything else is a traditional, modern summer blockbuster take on the ""misunderstood good cop against the system"" story.  They even have the infamous ""give me your badge"" line!However, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Firstly, they have a nugget of brilliance by taking ideas from Dr. Asimov's works; secondly, they have a charismatic lead action star in Will Smith, who has buffed up considerably for this role (as a matter of fact, we see just how ""improved"" he is during an extended morning wake up scene right at the beginning of the movie); and finally, the special effects, although clearly CGI at times, are extremely well done and well integrated with the action.Mr. Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner, who harbors a deep distrust and resentment towards the now ubiquitous robots in 2034 Chicago.  The script reveals via flashbacks that Spooner had a previous run-in with a perfectly well functioning robot that lead to less than perfect consequences.  Every time Spooner brings up his issues with robots, everyone around him raises an eyebrow and mention the inviolate three laws - and if you don't know them by now, you are probably locked up in a cave somewhere without internet access anyway ;-)However, Spooner's fears seem to become reality when Dr. Lanning, the father of robotics, dies in an apparent suicide.  It seems that Dr. Lanning, played by the always exceptional James Cromwell, flung himself through a window in his 31st story office, where he was by himself...along with some robots.  Coincidentally, US Robotics (not the defunct modem maker), the company which Dr. Lanning founded, is about to roll out its newest robot model, the NS-5, which is smarter, has improved facial expressions, and can be updated wirelessly.  That an NS-5 robot named Sonny becomes Spooner's main suspect in Dr. Lanning's death raises the stakes considerably for all involved.Dr. Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan, is assigned to assist Det. Spooner in the investigation.  She was a colleague of Dr. Lanning, and an in-house US Robotics expert in robot behavior.  Of course, there is the requisite suspicious industrial multi-billionaire, played surprisingly well by Bruce Greenwood given his brief screen time.The movie includes some amazing set pieces, such as rollicking, physics defying clash in a freeway tunnel (just don't ask why the freeway is absolutely empty but for the key players, and how can a car do THAT, no matter how futuristic - I guess the screenwriters, too busy with the laws of robotics, forgot about the laws of physics), huge warehouses full of robots, and an amazing final showdown.The video quality is beautiful, and the DTS soundtrack is, for lack of better words, powerful, with plenty of action for the surround speakers.  Special mention must be made of the set designs, where a near-future urban metropolis is realized in believable fashion - I applaud the decision NOT to have flying cars in this future city.All in all, if the viewer does not sit down expecting a brainy, complex sci-fi movie, she will be more than satisfied with this movie.",4,"I, Robot for the new millenium",1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,3430,"['not', 'father', 'Robot', 'final', 'credits', 'movie', 'been', 'inspired', 'works', 'late', 'sci-fi', 'grandmaster', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'True', 'three', 'laws', 'robotics', 'are', 'clearly', 'spelled', 'out', 'opening', 'credits', 'yes', 'are', 'characters', 'named', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'Dr.', 'Calvin', 'Sonny', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'traditional', 'modern', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'take', 'misunderstood', 'good', 'cop', 'system', 'story', 'even', 'have', 'infamous', 'give', 'badge', 'line', 'However', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Firstly', 'have', 'nugget', 'brilliance', 'taking', 'ideas', 'Dr.', 'Asimov', 'works', 'secondly', 'have', 'charismatic', 'lead', 'action', 'star', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'buffed', 'up', 'considerably', 'role', 'matter', 'fact', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'improved', 'extended', 'morning', 'wake', 'up', 'scene', 'right', 'beginning', 'movie', 'finally', 'special', 'effects', 'clearly', 'CGI', 'times', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'integrated', 'action.Mr', 'Smith', 'Chicago', 'detective', 'Del', 'Spooner', 'who', 'deep', 'distrust', 'resentment', 'now', 'ubiquitous', 'robots', '2034', 'Chicago', 'script', 'reveals', 'flashbacks', 'Spooner', 'had', 'previous', 'run-in', 'perfectly', 'well', 'functioning', 'robot', 'lead', 'less', 'perfect', 'consequences', 'time', 'Spooner', 'up', 'issues', 'robots', 'everyone', 'eyebrow', 'mention', 'inviolate', 'three', 'laws', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'now', 'are', 'probably', 'locked', 'up', 'cave', 'somewhere', 'internet', 'access', 'anyway', 'However', 'Spooner', 'fears', 'seem', 'become', 'reality', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'father', 'robotics', 'dies', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'played', 'always', 'exceptional', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'flung', 'window', '31st', 'story', 'office', 'where', 'was', 'robots', 'Coincidentally', 'US', 'Robotics', 'not', 'defunct', 'modem', 'maker', 'company', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'founded', 'roll', 'out', 'newest', 'robot', 'model', 'NS-5', 'smarter', 'improved', 'facial', 'expressions', 'can', 'be', 'updated', 'wirelessly', 'NS-5', 'robot', 'named', 'Sonny', 'Spooner', 'main', 'suspect', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'death', 'stakes', 'considerably', 'involved.Dr', 'Susan', 'Calvin', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'assigned', 'assist', 'Det', 'Spooner', 'investigation', 'was', 'colleague', 'Dr.', 'Lanning', 'in-house', 'US', 'Robotics', 'expert', 'robot', 'behavior', 'course', 'requisite', 'suspicious', 'industrial', 'multi-billionaire', 'played', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'given', 'brief', 'screen', 'time.The', 'movie', 'amazing', 'set', 'pieces', 'such', 'rollicking', 'physics', 'defying', 'clash', 'freeway', 'tunnel', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'freeway', 'absolutely', 'empty', 'key', 'players', 'how', 'can', 'car', 'do', 'THAT', 'matter', 'how', 'futuristic', 'guess', 'screenwriters', 'too', 'busy', 'laws', 'robotics', 'forgot', 'laws', 'physics', 'huge', 'warehouses', 'full', 'robots', 'amazing', 'final', 'showdown.The', 'video', 'quality', 'beautiful', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'lack', 'better', 'words', 'powerful', 'plenty', 'action', 'surround', 'speakers', 'Special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'set', 'designs', 'where', 'near-future', 'urban', 'metropolis', 'realized', 'believable', 'fashion', 'applaud', 'decision', 'NOT', 'have', 'flying', 'cars', 'future', 'city.All', 'viewer', 'not', 'sit', 'down', 'expecting', 'brainy', 'complex', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'satisfied', 'movie']","I, Robot"

I always have to wonder when I start rooting for the ""Badguy"" in any movie.  Right after Viki gives her last memorable speech of how the human race is run by self interest, self involvment and self everything (which is primarily true), they decide to shut her down and kill her because the truth hurts.  My main question in this movie was, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy?  By the end of the movie, I wanted Will Smith's character dead and his little counter part's character to suffer too.  Not that the robots were anything to cheer about either.  Their faces were enough to punch, and their pompous laid back attitude is what's wrong with humanity in the first place.  I was more intrigued with the first stage robots.  They had kind faces and hearts of gold.  A big problem I had with this movie was the miscasting of Will Smiths character and the fact it ripped alot of the premise of the film off ""Blade Runner"".  I was impressed with the awesome special effects, it's just a shame the story didn't live up to the visuals.",3,Viki Rulez,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,1117,"['Kill', 'Viki', 'what', 'found', 'saying', 'climax', 'movie', 'always', 'have', 'wonder', 'when', 'start', 'rooting', 'Badguy', 'movie', 'Right', 'Viki', 'last', 'memorable', 'speech', 'how', 'human', 'race', 'run', 'self', 'interest', 'involvment', 'everything', 'primarily', 'true', 'decide', 'shut', 'down', 'kill', 'truth', 'main', 'question', 'movie', 'was', 'who', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'end', 'movie', 'wanted', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'dead', 'little', 'counter', 'part', 'character', 'suffer', 'too', 'Not', 'robots', 'were', 'anything', 'cheer', 'were', 'enough', 'punch', 'pompous', 'laid', 'back', 'attitude', 'what', 'wrong', 'humanity', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'more', 'intrigued', 'first', 'stage', 'robots', 'had', 'kind', 'hearts', 'gold', 'big', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'miscasting', 'Will', 'Smiths', 'character', 'fact', 'ripped', 'alot', 'premise', 'film', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'was', 'impressed', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'shame', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'visuals']","I, Robot"
