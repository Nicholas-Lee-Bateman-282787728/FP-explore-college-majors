The production quality was good and there was some really good acting and that's what warrants a four-star rating. The plot, however, was sub-par and some of the dialogue was unbearable.

1616895,A2M85JGCPOR97Y,B00AUJH3E2,Misterbanks,"[0, 3]","I thought Nathan Gamble's acting was good as usual.  But other than that it was an awkward, contrived, and stretched thin plot line. There was no real point to it other than you can believe in God and science.  However, most religions condemn large parts of science, so I don't see the point that was trying to be made as anything other than pandering to people who see the church's views as outdated.

1616896,AE7MJ2ZKR5AKQ,B00AUJH3E2,R. A. Gomez,"[20, 22]","A great film that challenges a person to remove the veil of their natural eyes and begin to see with their spiritual eyes the works and role of a Creator.  In this film the challenge is tossed from a child, his parents, even his Biology teacher.  Yet, it is all tied together by a special messenger, who appears to be a stranger to this small community.  Nonetheless, in its short-time, this film expands so much of what is known and at times taken for granted.  Its short-time, this film challenges logic and provides an incentive to explore that which fills in the void of the pattern of the grand design.  Watch the film, it will be worth it.
