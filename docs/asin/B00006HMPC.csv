716425,A1GQ7AFCN7OZMK,B00006HMPC,amster,"[3, 6]","I've never read the books (I'm not into self-torture), nor have I seen the first film in the series.  I'm vaguely familiar with the whole ""Left Behind"" phenomena, but mostly through second hand sources, such as those awkward-turtle conversations with a co-worker that one sometimes finds oneself in.  You know, the kind that has you saying ""okay then...good luck with that"", because sometimes it's better to say nothing if you can't think of anything nice to say.  I basically watched this on Netflix on a lark.  It was one of those ""how bad could it really be?""  kind of moments.Well, it was bad, really bad, and it really deserves one star, but I gave it a bonus star because I found it entertaining in a ""Battlefield Earth"" sort of way, and I gave it another bonus star because of the sincerity of the people involved in the making of it.  Paradoxically, that's what I found to be the most disturbing as well.As the story picks up, presumably after the events of the first film, hundreds of millions of people have mysteriously disappeared off of the face of the Earth.  We quickly learn that they have been raptured up to Heaven, and these lucky souls (literally) are those who had already accepted the Protestant Evangelical Jesus as their Lord and Savior.  I think it's safe to assume from the tone of the film that this doesn't include Catholics or liberal Christian denominations, but it does include all of the world's children.  Apparently those who are too young to choose whether or not to accept Jesus automatically get a free pass into Heaven, which I suppose would make abortion a good thing, if one were to think about it logically.  But I think it's fair to say that logic doesn't play a very big role in the thought process of either the filmakers nor their target audience.  In fact, they seem quite proud of the fact that they don't use logic, wearing their stupidity as if it were a badge of honor.  Apparently the rest of us were ""left behind"" because God likes to torture humanity until we kiss His backside, at which time he'll still torture us with immeasureable suffering because HE works in mysterius ways and it's not our place to question Him.  Those who turn to Christ after the Rapture, which include all of the characters in the film, have to remain on Earth and suffer throuth the Apocalypse.  Apparently God's favorite game is ""talk to the hand"".  Die unsaved?  You get to spend eternity in Hell.  Don't like it?  You should have thought about that when you had the chance.  Unsaved prior to the Rapture?  You get to endure Hell on Earth, but at least you can still qualify for the Big Prize that's behind Door #1, because, He's a meciful God who LOVES you.So how are things after the rapture?  Well, the Anti-Christ is the Secretary General of the United Nations, because nothing says EVIL like liberal notions like world peace, nuclear disarmament, and the nations of the world working out their differences through diplomacy.  And he's Russian, because, you know, Russians are all Atheist Commi-Socialists.  We know this because he proclaims that ""there is no God"".  I suppose what we're supposed to take from this is that Atheists and Satanists are basically the same, right?  Uh, no.  Atheists don't believe in a supernatural diety of any kind, and would find a Satanist's belief system to be as logically flawed as that of a Christian's.  But I digress.  After this anouncement, his first act as Secretary General is to create one world-wide monetary system, because apparently the world is in some sort of mass economic crises after millions of people disappear.  Of course, that doesn't make sense either.  With hundreds of millions of less people, one would think that there would be more real estate and natural resources to go around, making life more comfortable for those ""left behind"", but as I already noted, logic isn't this film's strong suit.Other than that, things don't seem to be THAT bad.  All the characters live in nice homes and have well paying jobs.  Things seem pretty much the same.  One would think that the Apocalypse would be a little more Apocalyptic.  You know, fire and brimstone coming out of the heavens, famine, desease, mass murder.  I would even take a lack of clean running water.  Something.  ANYTHING.  Maybe the filmakers saved all that stuff up for the third installment, but I doubt it, given the production values on display here.  The characters even go to church openly.  You would think that at the very least that the Anti-Christ would be rounding the Christians up and sending them to concentration camps, but no.  But one only has to look at contemporary Christians to see why the filmakers did it this way.  Concentration camps aren't needed to convey the message of persecution, because Christians love to pretend like they're being persecuted already, when in actuality they don't even know the meaning of the word.I don't want to give away to much of the plot because I personally don't apppreciate spoilers, but I'll suffice it to say that it is completely ruined by the overwhelming, unbiquitous presence of DEUS EX MACHINA.  Maybe it's not surprising, given the subject matter, but it's lousy story telling nonetheless.  It's simply unsatisfying (and lazy) on a dramatic level if the hero is unable to solve his problems on his own.  Here, problems are solved through a mere act of prayer, wherein God magically intervenes and solves the problem for them.  What's worse is the fact that millions of people come away from this thinking that's how the world actually functions.  Forget science and logic, which is based on observable, natural, and CONSISTENT phenomena.  Instead, we get treated to a world where things just magically happen, apparently upon the whim of a capricious diety who gets to change the rules whenever He feels like it.  Little Timmy's heart transplant is a success?  Our God is an awesome God!  Little Timmy dies?  Our God works in mysterius ways, and who are we to question His plan.  Either way, God get's a free pass, while the surgeons who actually performed the operation apparently had no part in it.  This failure on the part of the characters to function as if they existed in the real world results in some major plot holes.  Why doesn't Brad Johnson simply fly the Anti-Christ's jumbo jet straight into the ground?  Because according to Bible prophecy, the Anti-Christ gets to rule, that's why.  So why even try?  But if that's the case, why do anything?  Why even bother to get out of bed in the morning?  And why bother to pray, if the future is set and God has already decided everything that will happen, including knowing who will turn to Him and who won't, which sorta makes all those people burning in Hell for all enternity sorta INNOCENT, doesn't it?It's a very interesting film is one wants to understand the mentality of millions of contemporary Christians.  To summarize:1)  They don't believe in a universe that's built on natural law.  Basically anything goes, and prayer and blind obedience to biblical authority take precedence over personal initiative.  2)  This belief in a ""higher power"" in control of ""everything"", coupled with a denial of and guilt over their own natural drives and insticts, leads to feelings of helplessness and delusions of persecution, fueled by passive agresssion and a resentment of those who choose not to follow their (God's) rules.  3)  This leads to the creation of and the belief in eloborate revenge fantasies wherein the righteous are rewarded and the wicked are punished, such as the Book of Revelations and The Left Behind Series on which it was based.In closing, I'm not an Atheist.  I would consider myself an Agnostic.  Even if the universe was somehow created by a sentient being outside of it, I don't see that alone is proof of either an afterlife or proof that such a being would be even mildly interested in us.  If I were a betting man, I'd throw my lot in with Azathoth, the Blind Idiot God.  Suffice it to say that I DON'T KNOW, and I'm okay with that.  Just because I don't know doesn't mean I'm going to accept every explanation that comes along.",3,A Paranoid Revenge Fantasy,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,8140,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'books',

716428,A2MW0RYIXMEYGS,B00006HMPC,Dave,"[0, 0]","Okay, if you read my review of the first Left Behind movie, than you know I didn't like that one as much because it presented a vague Gospel message...the crucial focal point of the Left Behind series itself.In Tribulation Force, it's much better. The Savior's name, Jesus, is mentioned a good dozen or two times. There are several touching salvation moments. The characters interact better. The groundwork was laid in the first movie, and now the second movie got better. Granted, it still has a slight air of cheap-ness, but not as bad as the first. (Example, the set for The Wailing Wall just looks like a Wall in a sound stage...I wonder why?)There are a few changes which kind of throw you off...Tsion Ben-Judah doesn't look very good at all for his character, but he's...at most, acceptable. Besides the actor, the movie guys changed the plot so that Ben-Judah isn't a Christian until halfway through the movie! Big change, and rather unnecessary.Readers of the book will remember a mix-up between Chloe Steele and Buck Williams. This was portrayed rather differently in the movie. And I was not pleased with the change at all. Chloe actually DID find a woman living in Buck's apartment. For WHATEVER reason, Buck allowed a friend of his, Ivy, to ""crash at his place"" for a few days. There wasn't any sin per se, implied or other, but the implications for public movie-goers could be less than sterling.The Witnesses - TWO this time - are pretty well-done. The fire-breathing is a little disjointed. First they blow CGI fire, and then some stunt-soldiers have flames on their backs/fronts. To me, if fire were actually BLOWN onto you, you would be engulfed in flames. A little unreal the way they did it.All-in-all, I give this movie high marks, because they do a better job in comparison to the first movie.",5,"Much better than Left Behind, the first movie!",1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,1814,"['Okay', 'read', 'review', 'first', 'Left', 'Behind', 'movie', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'as', 'much', 'presented', 'vague', 'Gospel', 'message', 'crucial', 'focal', 'point', 'Left', 'Behind', 'series', 'itself.In', 'Tribulation', 'Force', 'much', 'better', 'Savior', 'name', 'Jesus', 'mentioned', 'good', 'dozen', 'two', 'times', 'are', 'several', 'touching', 'salvation', 'moments', 'characters', 'interact', 'better', 'groundwork', 'was', 'laid', 'first', 'movie', 'now', 'second', 'movie', 'got', 'better', 'Granted', 'still', 'slight', 'air', 'cheap-ness', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'first', 'Example', 'set', 'Wailing', 'Wall', 'just', 'Wall', 'sound', 'stage', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'kind', 'throw', 'off', 'Tsion', 'Ben-Judah', ""n't"", 'look', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'most', 'acceptable', 'actor', 'movie', 'guys', 'changed', 'plot', 'Ben-Judah', ""n't"", 'Christian', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Big', 'change', 'rather', 'unnecessary.Readers', 'book', 'will', 'remember', 'mix-up', 'Chloe', 'Steele', 'Buck', 'Williams', 'was', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'differently', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'pleased', 'change', 'Chloe', 'actually', 'DID', 'find', 'woman', 'living', 'Buck', 'apartment', 'WHATEVER', 'reason', 'Buck', 'allowed', 'friend', 'Ivy', 'crash', 'place', 'few', 'days', 'was', ""n't"", 'sin', 'se', 'implied', 'other', 'implications', 'public', 'movie-goers', 'could', 'be', 'less', 'sterling.The', 'Witnesses', 'TWO', 'time', 'are', 'pretty', 'well-done', 'fire-breathing', 'little', 'disjointed', 'First', 'blow', 'CGI', 'fire', 'then', 'stunt-soldiers', 'have', 'flames', 'backs/fronts', 'fire', 'were', 'actually', 'BLOWN', 'would', 'be', 'engulfed', 'flames', 'little', 'unreal', 'way', 'did', 'it.All-in-all', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'marks', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'comparison', 'first', 'movie']",Left Behind II - Tribulation Force

In most movies based on books they unfortunately must leave out a lot of content, usually due to time constraints. Such is the case with Left Behind. I understand it and know there is not much that can be done. What can be done, though, is to make sure the right content is selected and that what is selected is put together in a good way that keeps the story coherent and the main message of the book intact. I loved the book (the entire series actually), but felt the movie seemed to not be as impacting mostly due to the content that was left out. Of course, maybe if I had not read the book first it would have seemed better, but I just did not feel anywhere near the thrill from watching the movie that I got from the books. That being said, I think it does still give a good message and can help people understand end time prophecies by presenting one plausible scenario. I would recommend the books in this series over the movies (all of them), but the movies are worth seeing even if they may not have the same impact. And of course I would say if you can get an unbeliever to watch with you (since it would be harder to get them to read the book) then it could definitely be a valuable tool in getting a conversation started about end times and man's need for salvation through Christ.",4,"Good movie, book is better",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,1361,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', 'first', 'one', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'unfortunately', 'must', 'leave', 'out', 'lot', 'content', 'usually', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'Such', 'case', 'Left', 'Behind', 'understand', 'know', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'make', 'sure', 'right', 'content', 'selected', 'what', 'selected', 'put', 'together', 'good', 'way', 'story', 'coherent', 'main', 'message', 'book', 'intact', 'loved', 'book', 'entire', 'series', 'actually', 'felt', 'movie', 'seemed', 'not', 'be', 'impacting', 'mostly', 'due', 'content', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'course', 'maybe', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'better', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'anywhere', 'thrill', 'watching', 'movie', 'got', 'books', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'still', 'give', 'good', 'message', 'can', 'help', 'people', 'understand', 'end', 'time', 'prophecies', 'presenting', 'one', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'would', 'recommend', 'books', 'series', 'movies', 'movies', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'impact', 'course', 'would', 'say', 'can', 'get', 'unbeliever', 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'harder', 'get', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'could', 'definitely', 'be', 'valuable', 'tool', 'getting', 'conversation', 'started', 'end', 'times', 'man', 'need', 'salvation', 'Christ']",Left Behind II - Tribulation Force

Hernandez""Left Behind 2"" is the most anti-Semitic film ever produced. Its bottom line is that even the most holy Jewish sage on earth ... a man clearly intended to represent the Chief Rabbi of Israel ... is easily swayed and conquered by evil. That in itself speaks volumes about what is happening, according to this film, with all the other Jews on earth. They are all swallowed in evil, going right along with it.Why? Because the Jews are not Christian. Sound familiar?May I request of my readers (that is, 'critics') to stop lecturing me about ""lightening up"" because this is ""just a movie""? Plus you hypocrite Christians who say it's fiction! This is NOT fiction, it's darned close to the ""Last Days"" theology most of your churches teach. So back off, find someone else to hoot and holler at - this movie SUCKS, is offensive as a KKK promo film, plain and simple.Almost the entire movie is set in Jerusalem; the Jews that are portrayed in the film are demonstrably stupid, wandering around under the total spell of evil. The novel may have been richer in characters than the film, but it was certainly not any richer in its insulting theological hypotheses or muddiness of thought. It most certainly was just as anti-Semitic.Actually, the novel in a sense pales compared to the film in its repulsive anti-Semitism. The film is a right-wing Christian Dispensational Fundamentalist's wet dream spilled all over the audience: the entire Jewish world ultimately accepts Jesus as ha-Meshiach, the Messiah. Even the character Rabbi Zion ben Judah (listed in the credits simply as ""Ben Judah""), who is the chief rabbi of Israel character, publicly converts to Christianity ... on global television, no less.That moment, when Rabbi ben Judah accepts Jesus and also announces the Jewish findings that Jesus is the real Messiah, and begs God's forgiveness for having been a Jew, is cinema's all-time low. But it is not that simple. This moment in the film is humanity at its most evil.No doubt a suitably horrified and angry view of the film would be shared by the real Chief Rabbis of Israel (there are three: the Ashkenazi, the Sephardi and the Ethiopian). One feels they would all shriek in horror at ""Left Behind 2"" as the phony-looking ""Rabbi ben Judah"" begs Jesus' forgiveness for not having accepted him.Of course, a Christian pal of mine justified this horrid way of thinking, by reminding me that the New Testament tells us that most of the world will be deceived in these times. He stated that it must have been a demonstration of this plague of deception that was the movie's goal. The goals of this movie, however, are loftier than Hitler's Final Solution. Why not just make a movie- one that has deeply touched thousands of American Christians- that ""shows what the Jews really are""? ""Left Behind 2"" does just that, and does it better than Hitler's ""rat"" documentary ever did.Ignore the other ridiculous drivel found in the novels and the films of the ""Left Behind"" series. They range from the laughable to the nauseating. But the anti-Semitism cannot be ignored; it is deliberate, it is crassly to the point and it is unashamed. One cannot escape the feeling that some neo-Nazi or a White Power screwhead wrote this film. I was waiting for the rabbi in the film to throw away his yarmulke, throw out his right arm and cry, ""Heil, Jesus!""Even the Roman Catholic Church, which has banned its stores and schools from possessing any of the ""Left Behind"" series, has finally apologized for all its past wrongdoings against the Jewish people. The Church did not ban ""Left Behind"" for its anti-Semitism, but one wonders: Pope John Paul II had a Jewish mother, and was raised exclusively among Jews. He feels a strong bond with the Jewish people; under his guidance especially, the Mass and all catechesis materials have removed prayers for the conversion of the Jews.After watching the first film,Left Behind - The Movie, I was amused at the way the ""good guys"" (read: born-again Christians) were becoming just as fascist and frightening as 'Carpathia', the humorously Bosnian-sounding antichrist character. In one scene, they chase down and corner a man unwilling to share in the faith; it's scarier than any scene with the antichrist guy.After the first 20 minutes of watching ""Left Behind 2"", I was feeling more frightened at the anti-Semitic crap than anything else. Suddenly, all my good humor had left me. When I returned the videos to Blockbuster, I attached a note to the tape of ""Left Behind 2"", suggesting that they warn viewers of the extreme anti-Semitic offensiveness of the film. I wonder if they will turn a blind eye too.I cannot fathom which is worse; that this horrible movie was ever made; that even anti-Christian reviews of it have been fairly favorable; or that no Jewish group has uttered one single peep about it. Well, folks, here's ONE Jew who is royally pissed off about the whole thing. Look at the comment posted at my review, courtesy of user ""im*a*western*gal"": 'The movie, if nothing else, gets people thinking that there IS a tribulation period coming, and that we need to get ourselves prepared for that, AND the second coming of Christ.'Scary as hell or what?! Can this user not read how incredibly angry I am about this entire PHONY mythological issue??We need to start worrying about anti-Semitism and stop worrying about antichrists. Because by virtue of Christian argument itself, many Christians are doing a good job of being antichrists already. Like the people who made this film, for example.",1,"Rotten, anit-Semitic and horrifying",1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,5603,"['Original', 'date', 'review', 'publication', '26', 'July', '2003',

716432,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B00006HMPC,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[5, 7]","I may have been a little skeptical about the first Left Behind at first, but then I realized it had a great message to it, and would really mean something in my life. When I saw the sequel, I definetely say this had more meaning to it. It had two characters become christians, which had really been far away from God in the first place, plus this gives people who don't know, more information about him.It has been exactly one week since people all over the globe have disappeared without a trace. There's confusion everywhere, but not in a few newfound christians, Rayford Steele, Chloe Steele, Bruce Barnes, and Buck Williams. They now know that after what Buck experienced, Nicolae Carpathia, the peace leader of the world, and the secretary general to the UN, isw infact the antichrist. Buck, and Rayford want to help out as much as they can in stopping him, but it may mean giving the devil himself a little help first. They have only one goal, and that's to try and bring more people to God in anyway they can.It may have been lower budget than the first Left Behind, but this one is definitely better. As a fourteen year old, a lot of people think I'm crazy when I talk about the rapture. When I think about that, I think of Pastor Bruce Barnes in church and how difficult it is to tell these people what they already knew, yet denied it long before.Thinking about the church scene in the movie, it made me think a lot of 9/11, and how all of the sudden people are going to church, and praising God because of an apocalyptic event. It shouldn't take something like that to get people to go to church, or devote their life to God. It shows you, though, how cowardess people are when something like this happens.I now own this movie because of these, and glad about it. I still believe the rapture is coming, so I'm careful. As a Christian, I do believe, and hope you believe it too. Just remember, if you are caught in the Tribulation, you can still give your life to God regardless. He stands at the door, and knocks.

For those concerned about Biblical content, especially in relation to the presentation of the Gospel, you need not worry.  Though several verses are combined, the material is presented in proper context throughout the film.The Two Witnesses of Revelation 11 make their appearance in this film.  Also, Tsion ben Judah delivers his startling announcement regarding Messianic Prophecies from the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.  Virtually all original cast members have reprised their roles and the Gospel is clearly presented, but without ""hitting someone over the head with a Bible"".  Nonetheless, there will still be those who criticize the ""Bible thumping"" aspect of the film.

I mean, Kirk Cameron's been miscast and his character badly re-written from the books (he's a print journalist, not a tv journalist. Oh: and by the way, live shots take WORK! You don't just turn on a camera and start beaming to the whole world without telling anyone at the office you're about to break into regular programming)! But Kirk is a trooper and does a good job. Clarence Gilyard and Gordon Currie, the best actors of the original movie, are pretty much wasted in this one (although Currie, as Nicolae Carpathia, gets the best special effect). Brad Johnson comes across as the most genuine of the bunch, and Janaya Stephens' character is a vast improvement over the original movie (which was not a bad jumping off point for her).So the actors did okay given what they had to work with.My problem with the movie is that they were working with GARBAGE! The writing in the book is bad enough without being given the Cloud Ten treatment. Bleagh.Let's see, I'm going to take a trip to see a potential girlfriend, but first, I need to take a detour because the anti-Christ is on my roof and wants to talk to me!I have to show my ID to a security guard, even though he and I are on a first name basis!I thought the anti-Christ was the Messiah, but a couple of homicidal ""witnesses"" spouting a few verses from the New Testament convinced me to consider Jesus instead.I just recently became a devout Christian, but I've got no problem inviting a woman AND HER FIANCE to stay in my apartment.Sigh.Not to mention that characters are supposed to meet, but don't; characters are supposed to marry, but don't; characters are supposed to die, but don't.And by the way, this criticism really belongs to the book, but how CHEESY is ""tribulation force"" as a name, anyway? No self-respecting group of Christians would call themselves that. As if four schmoes from Chicago are going to isolate themselves from their church and give themselves such a ""cool"" name based on... based on what, exactly? Cheesy and stupid. They're a circle of friends. Not to be cliche about it, but they are a fellowship. They are not a ""tribulation force."" That's stupid and self-important and detracts so much from what should be the characters' appreciation for God in Christ.The first movie was campy fun, an evangelical tool that works well as a conversation piece and little else. This movie was just bad. An earlier writer noted that they did a better job of presenting a Christian message, and I'll agree. They did get that right, relatively speaking. But at what cost? Bleagh.

And as for the comment about the Angel &quot;hypnotizing&quot; the guards, Angels would not use secular means to their advantage. It was the Holy Spirit working through the Angel as she sings it brings forth the mighty power of God to stop those guards. We as Christians need to understand that the Spirit of God is so mighty, mighty enough to stand against any guards and most importantly to stand against Satan.Who knows, one day when Jesus comes again and the rapture takes place.

They were able to get all the same actors back two years later to film this. And their acting was a bit better then the first movie. The sets were nice, extras did a good job, but the especial effects were not that great. The did the best on the morphing of the Nicolae...which if you think about no one would see him like that until after he was indwelt.This movie strayed much further from the book then the first movie did. And this time I found it disappointing. I wonder how Buck will continue his work once he is on his own now that he is a TV reporter instead of a writer.Some of the things that bothered me were: The plane is really small for Global Community One. I guess they could not afford to pay to place that sticker on a 757. Rayford has to almost beg Hattie to become Nicolae's Pilot, the opposite of what happened. Nicolae actually loses his temper and throws a tantrum, very unNicolae like. And though there were many more errors these last two bothered me the most. The two witnesses do not get to actually witness. And they are sealed off from the world. We see them once. And Dr. Ben Judah starts off believing that their is no God, yet Nicolae is the Messiah. The last was most disappointing for me. For he was one character I had a lot of respect for.Now, though not in the book, the movie is character driven. They are very proactive. Like Rayford going to get his pilot job and Buck getting himself to the Rabbi Tsion Ben Judah speech.

716453,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B00006HMPC,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[1, 2]","I wonder if the Kirk Cameron jokes on Family guy were inspired by these two films, or if it was simply Kirk being an outspoken and vocal Christian. I am sort of a Schizophrenic Christian. Sometimes I am feeling drawn to the spirit of Christian ideas and values, and then sometimes I feel like Christianity is nothing but hypocrisy. I know this makes me human. I know many Christians would say I need to get saved. Some would feel I am living in the flesh. Really, it's hard for me to know how I feel since I no longer go to any kind of church. I've had bad experiences which led to my dead end in the church.That being said the first two Left Behind movies did little for me. The acting is bad. The actors are not very credible. The scripts are bad. It's very easy to see what a low budget the producers and actors had to work with. The movies try to deal with a global crisis but the films have a local aspect or perspective. Never was I lead to believe that the actors actually went anywhere. How did Kirk Cameron and others worship in very public places during the tribulation? With the Antichrist on the loose and in the flesh, when EVIL was prevailing all over the world, how were these CHRISTIANS worshiping in CHURCHES. The characters even wore CROSSES around their necks, or a couple did.I appreciate the work and the effort put into the movies but as someone who is not in the church I have to say these films simply are not on a part with any modern film which has any sort of respectable budget to work with. The movies are sort of entertaining. The ideas are compelling but the actors cannot sell the ideas and they can't make them believable. When the one character in this last film came up saying that so and so ""just got saved"" it just sounded childish and silly. The characters have not SOLD the feeling of the SPIRITUAL WARFARE. There needs to be a lot of BELIEVABLE DISTINCTION and CONTRAST between these forces of GOOD and EVIL. Sure, the Kirk character seems like a WHOLESOME Christian, but he doesn't look like some STRONG man that GOD has used to TRICK the ANTICHRIST. And the ANTICHRIST has a REALLY BAD ACCENT. Come on!!!!!! What was the ANTICHRIST, RUSSIAN? What a put on and silly accent.I'm sorry, I got rid of the first film and I feel the same will follow for the second. I know if I was hanging out with other Christians my age (50ish) that then I would be KINDER to these films. Christians ALWAYS SUPPORT the work of the lord. Fans of any BAND always SUPPORT the work of the band. Employees in a business support their employer and their company. But as someone not in the CHURCH I can say these films did little to steer me back into fellowship. They are just weak low budget Christian flicks.Sorry, I've watched TWO of these movies now and they have left little impact on me, and I AM reachable. I am not SO far gone. I am able to recognize good acting and good scripts, and I know how a budget makes all things POSSIBLE or IMPOSSIBLE.",2,Forgettable sequel to the forgettable debut.

As a Christian-moviegoer, I find it an embarassment that movies like Left Behind + Omega Code are the best entertainment we have to offer the world.The Christian film industry, in its' current state, deserves every type of criticism and stereotyping it receives because, let's be honest, it's all true! THESE MOVIES ARE HORRIBLY WRITTEN, ACTED, AND PRODUCED WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE NOT IN THEATRES AND WHY THE VERY SECOND THEY ARE RELEASED THEY HEAD STRAIGHT TO THE BOOKSHELVES!!! Why do we Christians so badly want to get our message out to movie lovers that we'll blindly support and purchase any 2-bit operation that has a Christian moto/message to it? We can do so much better, yet we continue to give our money away to movie houses like Cloud 10 so they can continue to make movies that no non-believer in their right mind would ever want to watch?Another thing is, why do all major Christian film fall under the category of ""end-times thriller"". I'm sick of hearing movies like Left Behind I+II, Tribulation, Appocalypse, and Omega Code getting so much praise when they are not only horribly made, but are repeating the same messages over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and again! Don't we Christians have anything better to make movies about than an upcoming persecution on believers? I mean, why not make a serious movie with serious characters dealing with serious issues? Why not make a movie about a man torn between God and country? Or a young girl having to decide whether or not to get an abortion? Or about problems inside the church related to new Christians falling unwittingly into a cult? There must be a million other ideas we could use to make good Christian movies! I refuse to believe that we Christians only have the mental capacity to talk about one thing and make bad movies about it that don't serve the topic any justice anyway! The fact is that we can do so much better! And I for one will refuse to support any half-witted film that has no structure or entertainment value whatsoever just because I might hear something positive about Jesus.Now, after reading my big tirade above, don't think that I haven't fully given up on the Christian film industry. I do firmly believe that there is hope for the future. If you want to support the real filmmakers who can actually keep an audience interested long enough to care about the message of the gospel, I suggest you go out and buy movies like the Veggie Tales. Or better yet, find some ameteur Christian video movie houses online. They're a thousand times better than any major Christian movie house, and they're actually entertaining! Not to mention much, much cheaper than buying a DVD at your local bookstore.",1,Please don't support these movies!,1037664000,"11 19, 2002",2002,2822,"['Christian', 'think', 'great', 'are', 'expanding', 'horizons', 'film', 'industry', 'Christian-moviegoer', 'find', 'embarassment', 'movies', 'Left', 'Behind', '+', 'Omega', 'Code', 'are', 'best', 'entertainment', 'have', 'offer', 'world.The', 'Christian', 'film', 'industry', 'current', 'state', 'type', 'criticism', 'stereotyping', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'true', 'THESE', 'MOVIES', 'ARE', 'HORRIBLY', 'WRITTEN', 'ACTED', 'AND', 'PRODUCED', 'WHICH', 'IS', 'WHY', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'IN', 'THEATRES', 'AND', 'WHY', 'THE', 'VERY', 'SECOND', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'RELEASED', 'THEY', 'HEAD', 'STRAIGHT', 'TO', 'THE', 'BOOKSHELVES', 'Why', 'do', 'Christians', 'so', 'badly', 'want', 'get', 'message', 'movie', 'lovers', ""'ll"", 'blindly', 'support', 'purchase', '2-bit', 'operation', 'Christian', 'moto/message', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'continue', 'give', 'money', 'away', 'movie', 'houses', 'Cloud', '10', 'can', 'continue', 'make', 'movies', 'non-believer', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'watch', 'thing', 'why', 'do', 'major', 'Christian', 'film', 'fall', 'category', 'end-times', 'thriller', ""'m"", 'sick', 'hearing', 'movies', 'Left', 'Behind', 'I+II', 'Tribulation', 'Appocalypse', 'Omega', 'Code', 'getting', 'so', 'much', 'praise', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'horribly', 'made', 'are', 'repeating', 'same', 'messages', 'over', 'again', 'again', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Christians', 'have', 'anything', 'better', 'make', 'movies', 'upcoming', 'persecution', 'believers', 'mean', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'serious', 'movie', 'serious', 'characters', 'dealing', 'serious', 'issues', 'Why', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'man', 'torn', 'God', 'country', 'young', 'girl', 'having', 'decide', 'not', 'get', 'abortion', 'problems', 'church', 'related', 'new', 'Christians', 'falling', 'unwittingly', 'cult', 'must', 'be', 'million', 'other', 'ideas', 'could', 'use', 'make', 'good', 'Christian', 'movies', 'refuse', 'believe', 'Christians', 'only', 'have', 'mental', 'capacity', 'talk', 'one', 'thing', 'make', 'bad', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'serve', 'topic', 'justice', 'anyway', 'fact', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'will', 'refuse', 'support', 'half-witted', 'film', 'structure', 'entertainment', 'value', 'whatsoever', 'just', 'might', 'hear', 'something', 'positive', 'Jesus.Now', 'reading', 'big', 'tirade', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', ""n't"", 'fully', 'given', 'up', 'Christian', 'film', 'industry', 'do', 'firmly', 'believe', 'hope', 'future', 'want', 'support', 'real', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'keep', 'audience', 'interested', 'long', 'enough', 'care', 'message', 'gospel', 'suggest', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'movies', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'better', 'yet', 'find', 'ameteur', 'Christian', 'video', 'movie', 'houses', 'online', ""'re"", 'thousand', 'times', 'better', 'major', 'Christian', 'movie', 'house', ""'re"", 'actually', 'entertaining', 'Not', 'mention', 'much', 'much', 'cheaper', 'buying', 'DVD', 'local', 'bookstore']",Left Behind II - Tribulation Force

Obviously the would have to be much longer to include all of the scenes. But some of the differences between the book and the movie are too egregious and present a real dificulty for some people.The differences I had the most trouble with are with the Wailing Wall scenes. In the book, there are many people there. In the movie the UN made it off-limits and would shoot anybody who approached. The other is about Ben-Judah. I feel if I went into details on this one it may constitute a spoiler.I had some mixed feelings over the fact that the DVD includes a blooper reel. This movie is supposed to be a serious subject matter and the idea of adding humor.The acting is pretty good and includes Kirk Cameron, of the TV series ""Growing Pains"" Clarence Gilyard Jr. of ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" Godron Currie of ""Alive"" and many others.I hope that when the next film is made that they will make it more like the books.

The dialogue is cliched, the action keeps stopping for these sermons, the hamfisted flashbacks bring pain to viewing audiences.Not only are the silly aspects of the book back with a vengeance but annoying details surface in the movie. The character of Rabbi Ben-Judah was fairly mysterious in the book up until he did the Big Speech that Christians have been waiting to hear from Jews for centuries. In the book he's manipulated by the power of Kirk Cameron's faith. The Witnesses at the Western Wall (referred to in the movie as the Wailing Wall) were fairly integral to the first two books. They were slightly silly as they were old time prophets acted like hopped-up street preachers but that was their charm. In the movie they show up once and recite the Gospel of John.And there's some angel character that helps the heroes get to the wall by singing Amazing Grace - a move that reminds me of the end of season two with Angel - the one episode where the demons fall down clutching their ears whenever a character goes past singing (usually ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"")But the prophets breathe fire.

With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie TRIBULATION FORCE. I really was expecting to totally hate the movie because the book it's based on is nothing more than a glorified romantic novel set against the backdrop of the Tribulation (I think the only reason TRIBULATION FORCE was written was to increase the female readership of the series). However, this movie is better than LEFT BEHIND, correcting mistakes made in that film. Also the filmmakers took enough liberties to make the film much more enjoyable to watch than the book was to read.The acting in TRIBULATION FORCE is much better than in LEFT BEHIND. Kirk Cameron and Clarence Gilyard were tiers above their fellow performers in the first movie. Their performances still outshine everyone else, but the rest of the cast has developed some acting skills and their characters seem like real people rather than the wooden cut-outs they appeared to be in LEFT BEHIND. The movie's plot is more tight-knitted and not as jumpy as in LEFT BEHIND. The dialogue isn't as cheesy and much of the inexpensive production values are hidden with creative and clever cinematographical tricks.However, though TRIBULATION FORCE is an improvement upon LEFT BEHIND, the movie makes several mistakes the prevent it from being as good and powerful as it could have been. The mysterious wandering angel was unnecessary and distracting. Her presence isn't justified and there are much better ways that could have explained how Buck visited the Western Wall (a simple scene of praying hands coming together e.g.). The character of Tsion Ben-Judah was highly underdeveloped and the fact that he wasn't a Christian before seeing the two prophets irrated me greatly. Finally, even though the purpose of this film is evangelism, I found that there were too many scenes of witnessing and conversion. The movie would have been more entertaining and therefore reach a wider audience if the only salvation scenes would have been the service at the church and Raymond's talk with his friend.As a movie, TRIBULATION FORCE is a decent film. It is better than both LEFT BEHIND and the TRIBULATION FORCE novel. The movie is also a better piece of evangelism than the movie LEFT BEHIND. The novice filmmakers are becoming better movie magicians and hopefully if they continue the series, they will again improve in their craft and make a film worthy of showing in movie theatres around the world.",3,Better Than Expected.,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,2568,"['begin', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'made', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'novel', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'forms', 'artistic', 'expression', 'said', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'TRIBULATION', 'FORCE', 'really', 'was', 'expecting', 'totally', 'hate', 'movie', 'book', 'based', 'nothing', 'more', 'glorified', 'romantic', 'novel', 'set', 'backdrop', 'Tribulation', 'think', 'only', 'reason', 'TRIBULATION', 'FORCE', 'was', 'written', 'was', 'increase', 'female', 'readership', 'series', 'However', 'movie', 'better', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'correcting', 'mistakes', 'made', 'film', 'Also', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'enough', 'liberties', 'make', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'book', 'was', 'read.The', 'acting', 'TRIBULATION', 'FORCE', 'much', 'better', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'Clarence', 'Gilyard', 'were', 'tiers', 'fellow', 'performers', 'first', 'movie', 'performances', 'still', 'outshine', 'everyone', 'else', 'rest', 'cast', 'developed', 'acting', 'skills', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'wooden', 'cut-outs', 'appeared', 'be', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'movie', 'plot', 'more', 'tight-knitted', 'not', 'as', 'jumpy', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'cheesy', 'much', 'inexpensive', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'hidden', 'creative', 'clever', 'cinematographical', 'tricks.However', 'TRIBULATION', 'FORCE', 'improvement', 'upon', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'movie', 'several', 'mistakes', 'prevent', 'being', 'good', 'powerful', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mysterious', 'wandering', 'angel', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'distracting', 'presence', ""n't"", 'justified', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'explained', 'how', 'Buck', 'visited', 'Western', 'Wall', 'simple', 'scene', 'praying', 'hands', 'coming', 'together', 'e.g.', 'character', 'Tsion', 'Ben-Judah', 'was', 'highly', 'underdeveloped', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'Christian', 'seeing', 'two', 'prophets', 'irrated', 'greatly', 'Finally', 'even', 'purpose', 'film', 'evangelism', 'found', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'witnessing', 'conversion', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'therefore', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience', 'only', 'salvation', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'service', 'church', 'Raymond', 'talk', 'friend.As', 'movie', 'TRIBULATION', 'FORCE', 'decent', 'film', 'better', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'TRIBULATION', 'FORCE', 'novel', 'movie', 'also', 'better', 'piece', 'evangelism', 'movie', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'novice', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'becoming', 'better', 'movie', 'magicians', 'hopefully', 'continue', 'series', 'will', 'again', 'improve', 'craft', 'make', 'film', 'worthy', 'showing', 'movie', 'theatres', 'world']",Left Behind II - Tribulation Force
