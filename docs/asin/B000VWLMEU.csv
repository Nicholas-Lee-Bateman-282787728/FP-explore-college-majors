So my mom and I teamed up and watched season one (more like an introduction), and this became the kind of show where you're wanting to put an axe through your tv!Season Two: One step higher in suspense involving getting rid of an atomic bomb, and Jack sacrificing his life for his country.  This really shows how Jack puts family and his country first before himself.Season Three: Holy crap, this one killed me!  An airborne virus is released into Los Angeles, killing hundreds of people, while the romance of Michelle and Tony is a major entertaining part of the season.  This is one of the top seasons of the entire show!Season Four: Sad to say, but this one didn't quite pull me as the other ones have.  Though the bad guy is clever, they never really catch him, and it seems that some of the same things are repeated.  But the season finale is amazingly done, and people have said, that the show could've ended here.  This is somewhat true, but we would've said goodbye to classic characters so soon.Season Five: MY FAVORITE SEASON EVER!  This is a major comeback from the previous season, as Jack is forced to come out of hiding.  This season just never stops giving screams and thrills no other, and Sutherland really did deserve the golden globe that year.  This definitely is the season to watch if you're ever bored.Season Six: Lots of people didn't like this one, but I really did enjoy it a lot!  Again, it shows the deeper level of Jack's humanity and his desire for a normal life.  I loved how some lovable characters came back, and it gets you ready for the upcoming seventh season.  But lets hope that the show keeps our hopes alive, and stays immortal on FOX TV.",5,One of my Favorites!,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,1793,"['first', 'heard', 'show', 'family', 'friend', 'parents', 'knew', 'who', 'would', 'drop', 'anything', 'watch', 'show', 'TV', 'mom', 'teamed', 'up', 'watched', 'season', 'one', 'more', 'introduction', 'became', 'kind', 'show', 'where', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'put', 'axe', 'tv', 'Season', 'Two', 'One', 'step', 'higher', 'suspense', 'involving', 'getting', 'rid', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'Jack', 'sacrificing', 'life', 'country', 'really', 'how', 'Jack', 'family', 'country', 'first', 'himself.Season', 'Three', 'Holy', 'crap', 'one', 'killed', 'airborne', 'virus', 'released', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'killing', 'hundreds', 'people', 'romance', 'Michelle', 'Tony', 'major', 'entertaining', 'part', 'season', 'one', 'top', 'seasons', 'entire', 'show', 'Season', 'Four', 'Sad', 'say', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'other', 'ones', 'have', 'bad', 'guy', 'clever', 'never', 'really', 'catch', 'same', 'things', 'are', 'repeated', 'season', 'finale', 'amazingly', 'done', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'show', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'here', 'somewhat', 'true', 'would', ""'ve"", 'said', 'goodbye', 'classic', 'characters', 'so', 'soon.Season', 'Five', 'FAVORITE', 'SEASON', 'EVER', 'major', 'comeback', 'previous', 'season', 'Jack', 'forced', 'come', 'hiding', 'season', 'just', 'never', 'giving', 'screams', 'thrills', 'other', 'Sutherland', 'really', 'did', 'deserve', 'golden', 'globe', 'year', 'definitely', 'season', 'watch', ""'re"", 'ever', 'bored.Season', 'Six', 'Lots', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'Again', 'deeper', 'level', 'Jack', 'humanity', 'desire', 'normal', 'life', 'loved', 'how', 'lovable', 'characters', 'came', 'back', 'ready', 'upcoming', 'seventh', 'season', 'hope', 'show', 'hopes', 'alive', 'immortal', 'FOX', 'TV']",N/A

The whole series is exsplosive with constant action and great drama. Jack Bauer IS my favorite charater on the show. The death of David Paulmer was indeed the only sad thing.Can't wait for 24 season 7 to start airing on FOX 39 in January 2009. Now I am really into the show!! The DVD for SEASON 7 will possibly be coming out in December 2009?? I HOPE Many people say that the end of Season 6 Day 6 left a big gap not knowing what will happen next. WELL FOLKS! Fox 39 tv network has the solution. A 2 hour TV movie will be presented on NOVEMBER 23rd 2008 to recap what happend last in season 6 and what will happen in Season 7. The movie will be titled 24:The Exile.This movie is due to the January 2008 writers strike forcing Fox and the cast of 24 to postpone SEASON 7.,5,24 SEASONS 1-6,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,881,"['must', 'say', 'am', 'BIG', 'FAN', '24', 'not', 'watching', 'first', 'aired', 'when', 'bought', '6', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'whole', 'series', 'exsplosive', 'constant', 'action', 'great', 'drama', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'IS', 'favorite', 'charater', 'show', 'death', 'David', 'Paulmer', 'was', 'indeed', 'only', 'sad', 'thing.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', '24', 'season', '7', 'start', 'airing', 'FOX', '39', 'January', '2009', 'Now', 'am', 'really', 'show', 'DVD', 'SEASON', '7', 'will', 'possibly', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'December', '2009', 'HOPE', 'Many', 'people', 'say', 'end', 'Season', '6', 'Day', '6', 'left', 'big', 'gap', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'WELL', 'FOLKS', 'Fox', '39', 'tv', 'network', 'solution', '2', 'hour', 'TV', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'presented', 'NOVEMBER', '23rd', '2008', 'recap', 'what', 'happend', 'last', 'season', '6', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Season', '7', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'titled', '24', 'Exile.This', 'movie', 'due', 'January', '2008', 'writers', 'strike', 'forcing', 'Fox', 'cast', '24', 'postpone', 'SEASON', '7']",N/A
