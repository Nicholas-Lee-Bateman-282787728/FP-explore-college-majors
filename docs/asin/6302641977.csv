324561,A14NAALFHMKMED,6302641977,"C. Hawke ""oldmoviequeen""","[2, 2]","Love all the Reynolds comedies.  Glenn Ford plays the perfectly serious, level headed, military husband who has a job to get on with but is caught between a rock and a hardheaded wife who wants FUN and GLAMOR.  Debbie is the somewhat unique young woman who does not want to commit to a relationship with a fellow who is not wealthy.  Her heart (and his passionate kisses) eventually win her over to him AFTER the marriage vows are taken.  In the meantime, a wild trip overseas with a wilder automobile provides the elements to create comedy here. It's a funny farce with many unbelievable moments...which in reality, is what makes comedy work.  They are a great team here, both with diffent types of energy that mesh beautifully.  The end makes the journey worthwhile.",5,"Love it!

324565,A2JYIDH7JIG48H,6302641977,"R. Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[12, 12]","It Started With A Kiss is a romantic comedy about an Air Force sergeant (Ford) who marries a girl with extravagant tastes (Reynolds).  Stationed in Madrid, Ford's salary won't make ends meet after they win a prototype sports car in a lottery, putting them in a high tax bracket.  Meanwhile, Reynolds comes to believe they married too hastily based on physical attraction, and inists on spending at least a month living together platonically to make sure they're compatible.  Some of the comedy probably seemed risque in 1959, such as a misunderstanding about pregnancy and Ford's efforts to get his own wife in the sack.  Eventually she is wooed by a Spaniard (Gustavo Rojo) and to get even Ford moves in with Eva Gabor.  But they get it all straightened out with a happy ending.  It's far from the best movie of either star, and not even the best they did together - in my humble opinion Gazebo was somewhat better.  However, it has it's moments and a fine supporting cast. You'll enjoy it if you're a fan of any of them, and it's worth a look for the car, for nostalgia, and for film buffs.",4,"Nice comedy, but not best.",1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,1092,"['Started', 'A', 'Kiss', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Air', 'Force', 'sergeant', 'Ford', 'who', 'girl', 'extravagant', 'tastes', 'Reynolds', 'Stationed', 'Madrid', 'Ford', 'salary', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'win', 'prototype', 'sports', 'car', 'lottery', 'putting', 'high', 'tax', 'bracket', 'Meanwhile', 'Reynolds', 'believe', 'married', 'too', 'hastily', 'based', 'physical', 'attraction', 'inists', 'spending', 'least', 'month', 'living', 'together', 'platonically', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'compatible', 'comedy', 'probably', 'seemed', 'risque', '1959', 'such', 'misunderstanding', 'pregnancy', 'Ford', 'efforts', 'get', 'own', 'wife', 'sack', 'Eventually', 'wooed', 'Spaniard', 'Gustavo', 'Rojo', 'get', 'even', 'Ford', 'Eva', 'Gabor', 'get', 'straightened', 'out', 'happy', 'ending', 'far', 'best', 'movie', 'star', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'did', 'together', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Gazebo', 'was', 'somewhat', 'better', 'However', 'moments', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'fan', 'look', 'car', 'nostalgia', 'film', 'buffs']",It Started With a Kiss VHS

Debbie Reynolds plays a gold digger who meets a soldier when she is selling raffle tickets to wealthy benefit attendees. Glenn Ford won't stop bothering her but she won't give him the time of day since he doesn't have money. He buys one ticket to win an extravagant red custom car (which later became the Batmobile) and asks her to dinner. After saving her from a wardrobe malfunction a la Bringing Up Baby she agrees, and after one kiss, it's over. They get married.However, Debbie begins to have second thoughts when she meets hubby in Italy with their new car. Are they really in love or is it just a physical attraction? She puts their relationship on a 30 day hiatus to get to know each other, and their luxury automobile causes quite a few problems for them.This movie has its amusing moments but it is overall predictable and too long. Some editing and a few fresh ideas would have made it much better.",3,The Only Innovation is the Car,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,987,"['Started', 'Kiss', 'silly', 'movie', 'around', 'moderately', 'fun', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'gold', 'digger', 'who', 'soldier', 'when', 'selling', 'raffle', 'tickets', 'wealthy', 'benefit', 'attendees', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'bothering', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'time', 'day', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'one', 'ticket', 'win', 'extravagant', 'red', 'custom', 'car', 'later', 'became', 'Batmobile', 'dinner', 'saving', 'wardrobe', 'malfunction', 'la', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'one', 'kiss', 'over', 'get', 'married.However', 'Debbie', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'when', 'hubby', 'Italy', 'new', 'car', 'Are', 'really', 'love', 'just', 'physical', 'attraction', 'relationship', '30', 'day', 'hiatus', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'luxury', 'automobile', 'quite', 'few', 'problems', 'them.This', 'movie', 'amusing', 'moments', 'overall', 'predictable', 'too', 'long', 'editing', 'few', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better']",It Started With a Kiss VHS
