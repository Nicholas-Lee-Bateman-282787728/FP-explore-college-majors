He loves the Teletubbies, and is in Teletubby heaven with this tape and Silly Songs and Funny Dances.  At first, I cringed at watching the Teletubbies, but after seeing my son watch it and the smiles that it brought to his face, it made me changed my mind;  I actually thought it was cute.  He watches this tape so often that I am now considering buying it on DVD so that he has a spare copy.  By the way, my son also loves the Sun Baby and the squeals of laughter that come out of her!  Anything that makes my son that happy even if he's watched it over and over again is ok by me.",4,A Wonderful Video,1033257600,"09 29, 2002",2002,631,"['bought', 'son', 'who', '13', 'months', 'old', 'Teletubbies', 'Teletubby', 'heaven', 'tape', 'Silly', 'Songs', 'Funny', 'Dances', 'first', 'cringed', 'watching', 'Teletubbies', 'seeing', 'son', 'watch', 'smiles', 'brought', 'face', 'made', 'changed', 'mind', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'tape', 'so', 'often', 'am', 'now', 'considering', 'buying', 'DVD', 'so', 'spare', 'copy', 'way', 'son', 'also', 'Sun', 'Baby', 'squeals', 'laughter', 'Anything', 'son', 'happy', 'even', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'ok']",N/A
662582,A1FXEHWJN2TU3M,B00005LC18,Allen W. Nyhuis,"[7, 31]","The Teletubbies are a warning for our time.  I know it sounds funny; you're probably thinking, &quot;How can a stupid kid's show be all that important?!&quot;  All I ask is that you read the data I've collected and decide for yourself.The time-period for the show is sometime after the Armageddon; every country on earth has basically destroyed each other.  During that third World War, some people were able to escape into a bomb shelter underground.  Because of the radiation, no one dared to come up, until one man/woman had a proposition: let's send four toddlers outside to start a civilization.  So they did, and that's how the Teletubbies originated.Of course, because of the radiation, the Teletubbies did go through some mutations (notice the odd shapes growing from their heads and bright colors).  These mutations are actually the show's metaphor on how we all need to accept each other, no matter our color, shape, or size.  This is demonstrated well whenever the tubbies decide to have a &quot;big hug.&quot;The speaker that comes out of the ground is controlled by, of course, the people underground.  What they are trying to accomplish is to keep these Telletubbies child-like, with simple words such as &quot;Teletubby bye bye&quot; and &quot;All done.&quot;  After all, a race of babies wouldn't know how to kill each other.  The people also send that robot-vacuum cleaner up to tend after the Telletubbies.  No human being is allowed up there besides the tubbies; man is just not trustworthy enough.As for the television sets on their bellies, these are just little reminders of what earth used to be like....... short videos to comfort those who need them.  It's very moving how the Telletubbies shout &quot;again!  again!&quot; after watching the video; they truly seem to want this life of happiness.The sun with the baby's face is perhaps the deepest aspect of the show.  If we human beings would simply become babies again, like the Telletubbies, then we would truly live, just as the sun brings life to everything under it.Some may say, &quot;If Teletubbies is such an important piece of work, why is it geared towards kids?&quot;  Well, think about it.  Kids are tomorrow's leaders.  It may be too late for some of us, but children still have a chance.  They are innocent and willing to accept anything.People afraid of the show's important message tend to attack it.  Remember the countless attacks against Tinky-Winky's &quot;gayness&quot; and how the Po doll mutters cuss words?  All lies as we soon discovered.  Anything that is good will receive persecution; it's just a fact of life.",5,A Warning For Our Times,1004832000,"11 4, 2001",2001,2614,"['Teletubbies', 'are', 'warning', 'time', 'know', 'funny', ""'re"", 'probably', 'thinking', 'quot', 'How', 'can', 'stupid', 'kid', 'show', 'be', 'important', 'quot', 'ask', 'read', 'data', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'decide', 'yourself.The', 'time-period', 'show', 'sometime', 'Armageddon', 'country', 'earth', 'basically', 'destroyed', 'other', 'third', 'World', 'War', 'people', 'were', 'able', 'escape', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'underground', 'radiation', 'one', 'dared', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'man/woman', 'had', 'proposition', 'let', 'send', 'four', 'toddlers', 'outside', 'start', 'civilization', 'did', 'how', 'Teletubbies', 'originated.Of', 'course', 'radiation', 'Teletubbies', 'did', 'go', 'mutations', 'odd', 'shapes', 'growing', 'heads', 'bright', 'colors', 'mutations', 'are', 'actually', 'show', 'metaphor', 'how', 'need', 'accept', 'other', 'matter', 'color', 'shape', 'size', 'demonstrated', 'well', 'tubbies', 'decide', 'have', 'quot', 'big', 'hug.', 'quot', 'speaker', 'ground', 'controlled', 'course', 'people', 'underground', 'What', 'are', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'keep', 'Telletubbies', 'child-like', 'simple', 'words', 'such', 'quot', 'Teletubby', 'bye', 'bye', 'quot', 'quot', 'All', 'done.', 'quot', 'race', 'babies', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'kill', 'other', 'people', 'also', 'send', 'robot-vacuum', 'cleaner', 'tend', 'Telletubbies', 'human', 'being', 'allowed', 'there', 'tubbies', 'man', 'just', 'not', 'trustworthy', 'enough.As', 'television', 'sets', 'bellies', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'reminders', 'what', 'earth', 'used', 'be', 'short', 'videos', 'comfort', 'who', 'need', 'very', 'moving', 'how', 'Telletubbies', 'shout', 'quot', 'again', 'again', 'quot', 'watching', 'video', 'truly', 'seem', 'want', 'life', 'happiness.The', 'sun', 'baby', 'face', 'perhaps', 'deepest', 'aspect', 'show', 'human', 'beings', 'would', 'simply', 'become', 'babies', 'again', 'Telletubbies', 'then', 'would', 'truly', 'live', 'just', 'sun', 'life', 'everything', 'it.Some', 'may', 'say', 'quot', 'Teletubbies', 'important', 'piece', 'work', 'why', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', 'quot', 'Well', 'think', 'Kids', 'are', 'tomorrow', 'leaders', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'children', 'still', 'have', 'chance', 'are', 'innocent', 'willing', 'accept', 'anything.People', 'afraid', 'show', 'important', 'message', 'tend', 'attack', 'Remember', 'countless', 'attacks', 'Tinky-Winky', 'quot', 'gayness', 'quot', 'how', 'Po', 'doll', 'mutters', 'cuss', 'words', 'soon', 'discovered', 'Anything', 'good', 'will', 'receive', 'persecution', 'just', 'fact', 'life']",N/A

I'm not sure why my kids haven't really gotten 'into' it.Each little segment is about animals- a dog, a lamb and more. The Teletubbies sing about Mary and her little lamb, and more. I think the penguin part is fantastic.Although the whole video is about animals, it is broken down into little segments that make it easier to reach a 'good stopping point' for children, so the option is there to only watch a short segment of it.I use this video (and all others and TV) as a time for my kids to wind down at the end of the day or just prior to nap. A short time to just sit and turn off their brains for a few minutes. I know about the controversy surrounding the Teletubbies, but I just refuse to believe that this video teaching anything bad.

It was the first time we could see her sitting quiet for longer then 5 minutes. In fact she watched often a half hour, faszinated. Now she is 9 months and likes to dance with the Teletubbies. We do not agree with too much TV for children. But a kid who normally is very activ can learn to sit down a while and concentrate to one thing. And we parents have sometimes all hands full with work and its fine to have some minutes free of kids.

There are two important reasons why.  First, Teletubbies move so slowly I can't imagine that they would disrupt the development of a lengthy concentration span.  Second, for whatever reason, the Teletubbies are remarkably mesmerizing to a toddler.  In this case, that means 70 minutes of peace for the parent to relax, unwind, or review the video.Teletubbies--Baby Animals does absorb my 19 month old's attention through almost every sketch.  The exception is the ""How Now Brown Cow"" sketch, which involves each Teletubby in turn learning how to say ""How...now...brown...cow..."" over and over again.  I haven't timed this sketch, but would be surprised if it didn't last at least five minutes.  Once we get past that sketch, it's smooth sailing through baby elephants and teletubbies crawling (always good for a giggle), and swans and so forth.The other criticism I have of this video is that a few of the sketches are built around animal props and stuffed animals, and I think they would be more effective and/or educational if the animals moved and made genuine animal sounds.  Still and all, that's a small price to pay for 70 minutes of all-but-guaranteed free time, so I give the video 4 stars.",4,Slow but Steady,1023667200,"06 10, 2002",2002,1381,"[""'re"", 'going', 'defy', 'American', 'Pediatrics', 'Association', 'recommendation', 'expose', 'child', 'media', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'Teletubbies', 'way', 'go', 'are', 'two', 'important', 'reasons', 'why', 'First', 'Teletubbies', 'move', 'so', 'slowly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'would', 'disrupt', 'development', 'lengthy', 'concentration', 'span', 'Second', 'reason', 'Teletubbies', 'are', 'remarkably', 'mesmerizing', 'toddler', 'case', '70', 'minutes', 'peace', 'parent', 'relax', 'unwind', 'review', 'video.Teletubbies', 'Baby', 'Animals', 'absorb', '19', 'month', 'old', 'attention', 'almost', 'sketch', 'exception', 'How', 'Now', 'Brown', 'Cow', 'sketch', 'Teletubby', 'turn', 'learning', 'how', 'say', 'How', 'now', 'brown', 'cow', 'over', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'timed', 'sketch', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'least', 'five', 'minutes', 'get', 'past', 'sketch', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'baby', 'elephants', 'teletubbies', 'crawling', 'always', 'good', 'giggle', 'swans', 'so', 'forth.The', 'other', 'criticism', 'have', 'video', 'few', 'sketches', 'are', 'built', 'animal', 'props', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'and/or', 'educational', 'animals', 'moved', 'made', 'genuine', 'animal', 'sounds', 'Still', 'small', 'price', 'pay', '70', 'minutes', 'all-but-guaranteed', 'free', 'time', 'give', 'video', '4', 'stars']",N/A
