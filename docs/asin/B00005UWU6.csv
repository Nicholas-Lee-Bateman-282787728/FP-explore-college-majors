686513,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005UWU6,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I looked up this 69 comedy mainly because I wanted to see Goldie Hawn's Oscar winning turn.  I'm a fan of the actress and so I thought it might be fun to see where she got her start (not only did she win the Oscar for this, but it was her first film).  Add to the heap that this also stars Walter Matthau (my wife and I are pretty big fans, especially of his work alongside Jack Lemmon) and one of my personal favorite actresses EVER, Ingrid Bergman, and you have ample reason to indulge in this lightweight comedy.I think that's my biggest issue; it's really, really lightweight.Dr. Julian Winston (tooth doctor) has come up with the perfect dating plan.  He keeps ditzy girlfriend Toni at a safe distance by filling her head with the lies that he is married with three children.  With a wife in the picture he can have fun with Toni without being tied down by commitment.  When Toni decides that she needs that commitment, Julian runs into a problem.  How can he keep up the lie that he's married and turn around and marry Toni?  He persuades his `prim and proper' secretary, Stephanie, to pose as his wife and he then sets the divorce proceedings in motion.  Toni, the caring woman that she is, is insistent that the longsuffering Stephanie get a fair deal, which makes what could have been a smooth transaction a rather bumpy ride.The film is beyond ridiculous and predictable.  We know within the first few minutes how this is going to end and who is going to end up with who.  That wouldn't be so bad if the film had actually aged better.  The film is rather corny, thanks to the embrace of the era in which it was made.  It reminds me a lot of `Austin Powers' in feel and `groovyness' but it lacks impact due to the fact that this is not an intentional spoof.What the film DOES have going for it are the performances.  Goldie Hawn is delightful in all her wide-eyed gushiness.  I just wanted to squeeze her.  She has this sensual charm that just smothers you.  She reminded me a lot of Liza Minnelli here, which is a very good thing.  Ingrid Bergman is in TOP form here, funny and witty and even seductive in her old (not really) age.  She masters the stripping of layers beautifully.Without these two women the film would have been a forgettable loss.Walter Matthau is very good here, and Jack Weston is even better as the odd womanizer Harvey Greenfield.  He has some of the funniest lines, and makes the most out of the corn he is given (he even makes the tired `I work for the CIA' routine seem funny and fresh).In the end I have to give the film as a whole a C+, but the performances (especially from the women) are a surefire A+.  It's a film that I would watch again and enjoy, but not one that I would shout praises from the rooftops for.  If you see it, you will like it, but if you don't see it you won't be missing anything important.",3,It's a below average romp that gets a major facelift due to some remarkable performances...,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2852,"['looked', 'up', '69', 'comedy', 'mainly', 'wanted', 'see', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'turn', ""'m"", 'fan', 'actress', 'so', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'fun', 'see', 'where', 'got', 'start', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'win', 'Oscar', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Add', 'heap', 'also', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'wife', 'are', 'pretty', 'big', 'fans', 'especially', 'work', 'alongside', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'EVER', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'have', 'ample', 'reason', 'indulge', 'lightweight', 'comedy.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'issue', 'really', 'really', 'lightweight.Dr', 'Julian', 'Winston', 'doctor', 'come', 'up', 'perfect', 'dating', 'plan', 'ditzy', 'girlfriend', 'Toni', 'safe', 'distance', 'filling', 'head', 'lies', 'married', 'three', 'children', 'wife', 'picture', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'Toni', 'being', 'tied', 'down', 'commitment', 'When', 'Toni', 'commitment', 'Julian', 'problem', 'How', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'lie', 'married', 'turn', 'around', 'marry', 'Toni', 'prim', 'proper', 'secretary', 'Stephanie', 'pose', 'wife', 'then', 'divorce', 'proceedings', 'motion', 'Toni', 'caring', 'woman', 'insistent', 'longsuffering', 'Stephanie', 'get', 'fair', 'deal', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'smooth', 'transaction', 'rather', 'bumpy', 'ride.The', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'predictable', 'know', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'who', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'film', 'had', 'actually', 'aged', 'better', 'film', 'rather', 'corny', 'thanks', 'embrace', 'era', 'was', 'made', 'lot', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'feel', 'groovyness', 'impact', 'due', 'fact', 'not', 'intentional', 'spoof.What', 'film', 'DOES', 'have', 'going', 'are', 'performances', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'delightful', 'wide-eyed', 'gushiness', 'just', 'wanted', 'squeeze', 'sensual', 'charm', 'just', 'smothers', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'TOP', 'form', 'here', 'funny', 'witty', 'even', 'seductive', 'old', 'not', 'really', 'age', 'stripping', 'layers', 'two', 'women', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'forgettable', 'loss.Walter', 'Matthau', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'even', 'better', 'odd', 'womanizer', 'Harvey', 'Greenfield', 'funniest', 'lines', 'most', 'corn', 'given', 'even', 'tired', 'work', 'CIA', 'routine', 'seem', 'funny', 'fresh', 'end', 'have', 'give', 'film', 'whole', 'C+', 'performances', 'especially', 'women', 'are', 'surefire', 'A+', 'film', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'enjoy', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'shout', 'praises', 'rooftops', 'see', 'will', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'anything', 'important']",N/A
686514,A3759QIB6KMQZ2,B00005UWU6,"Anthony Paul ""AP""","[72, 77]","Being an avid movie and music fan, I'm always happy to find hidden gems in either artform that can take me by surprise.  I will also say that on most occasions I usually tend to agree with the critics in their attitudes and assertions.  However, this was not such a case.  When I recently stumbled upon this movie, I had never heard of it; the cast immediately intrigued me, especially Ingrid Bergman (in a 60's comedy?!)  I did a little research and was dissappointed to see that most of the reviews of this film were either lukewarm or negative, with most of the complaints being made about the &quot;miscasting of Ingrid Bergman&quot;.  Interesting enough, Goldie Hawn managed to win an Academy Award for her role...(was 1969 that bad a year for actresses?).Anyway, I wasn't expecting much when I finally watched it, especially after reading Leonard Maltin's review.  However, I quickly found myself thouroughly enjoying the scenarios unfolding.  Lighthearted, yes...but very fun.  It is very much in line with the Neil Simon plays/film of the era, having also been derived from a Broadway play.  I have to say that good old Leonard is wrong on this one, as are many other critcs.  The most astonishing error is the claim that Ingrid Bergman was miscast and has no comedic timing.  She was a riot to watch in a role like this; I'll say the best moments in the film are hers.  To my eyes, Bergman appears to be having a blast with this role and it is quite apparent.  At this point in her career, her mid 50's, it is wholly enjoyable to see the still beautiful Bergman having some lighthearted, carefree fun.I am surprised that the Academy chose to honor Goldie Hawn for her performance.  I found her to be a tad too cooky, even for a '60's go-go girl.  Walter Matthau, however, plays the role of a sneaky dentist quite well and is fully enjoyable.Apart from the actors' performances, I did also enjoy the look and feel of the film.  While many films from the 60's and 70's appear, to me, to be hopelessly dated in both of these aspects, I found that the &quot;1969&quot; in this film looked great.  It was actually very appealing...oranges,browns, flowers, and miniskirts, et.al.All in all, a very satisfying, simple little romp.  Look folks, I'm not saying this is a masterpiece by any stretch, but I definately found this worthy seeing.  The DVD has no extras to speak of...just a trailer of the film, as well as trailers for two other completely unrelated film (?)  However, the transfer of the film to DVD is surprisingly satisfying...colors are rich and vibrant, with minimal artifacts, film dirt/damage.  Also, and thankfully, the Widescreen is anamorphic.  Of course, there is the obligatory inclusion of the Standard (aka butchered)Version on the flipside of the disk, for those who haven't made the transition to the CORRECT way that is widescreen.  (ok...so maybe that was a little unnecessary)So if you've possibly not seen or heard of this film and are interested, don't listen to the critics on this one.  Give it a try, it's a good time.",4,"What?!...Ingrid Bergman, Walter Matthau, and Goldie Hawn?!",1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,3054,"['Being', 'avid', 'movie', 'music', 'fan', ""'m"", 'always', 'happy', 'find', 'hidden', 'gems', 'artform', 'can', 'take', 'surprise', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'most', 'occasions', 'usually', 'tend', 'agree', 'critics', 'attitudes', 'assertions', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'such', 'case', 'When', 'recently', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'cast', 'immediately', 'intrigued', 'especially', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', '60', 'comedy', 'did', 'little', 'research', 'was', 'dissappointed', 'see', 'most', 'reviews', 'film', 'were', 'either', 'lukewarm', 'negative', 'most', 'complaints', 'being', 'made', 'quot', 'miscasting', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'quot', 'Interesting', 'enough', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'managed', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'was', '1969', 'bad', 'year', 'actresses', '.Anyway', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'finally', 'watched', 'especially', 'reading', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'review', 'However', 'quickly', 'found', 'thouroughly', 'enjoying', 'scenarios', 'unfolding', 'Lighthearted', 'yes', 'very', 'fun', 'very', 'much', 'line', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'plays/film', 'era', 'having', 'also', 'been', 'derived', 'Broadway', 'play', 'have', 'say', 'good', 'old', 'Leonard', 'wrong', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'critcs', 'most', 'astonishing', 'error', 'claim', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'was', 'miscast', 'comedic', 'timing', 'was', 'riot', 'watch', 'role', ""'ll"", 'say', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'hers', 'eyes', 'Bergman', 'be', 'having', 'blast', 'role', 'quite', 'apparent', 'point', 'career', 'mid', '50', 'wholly', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Bergman', 'having', 'lighthearted', 'carefree', 'fun.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'Academy', 'chose', 'honor', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'performance', 'found', 'be', 'tad', 'too', 'cooky', 'even', ""'60"", 'go-go', 'girl', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'however', 'role', 'sneaky', 'dentist', 'quite', 'well', 'fully', 'enjoyable.Apart', 'actors', 'performances', 'did', 'also', 'enjoy', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'many', 'films', '60', '70', 'appear', 'be', 'hopelessly', 'dated', 'aspects', 'found', 'quot', '1969', 'quot', 'film', 'looked', 'great', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'appealing', 'oranges', 'browns', 'flowers', 'miniskirts', 'et.al.All', 'very', 'satisfying', 'simple', 'little', 'romp', 'Look', 'folks', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'masterpiece', 'stretch', 'definately', 'found', 'worthy', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'extras', 'speak', 'just', 'trailer', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'two', 'other', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'film', 'However', 'transfer', 'film', 'DVD', 'surprisingly', 'satisfying', 'colors', 'are', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'minimal', 'artifacts', 'film', 'dirt/damage', 'Also', 'thankfully', 'Widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'course', 'obligatory', 'inclusion', 'Standard', 'aka', 'butchered', 'Version', 'flipside', 'disk', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'transition', 'CORRECT', 'way', 'widescreen', 'ok', 'so', 'maybe', 'was', 'little', 'unnecessary', 'So', ""'ve"", 'possibly', 'not', 'seen', 'heard', 'film', 'are', 'interested', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'critics', 'one', 'Give', 'try', 'good', 'time']",N/A

Romantic comedy ""Cactus Flower"" is flirty, frothy and very amusing (not to mention it's nice to see a gal in her fifties shown as being attractive by the movie industry). It's predictable and lacking in twists, but it's entertaining by itself.Bachelor dentist Julian Winston (Walter Matthau) met the ditzy but sweet Toni (Goldie Hawn) a year ago, but to avoid the looming threat of commitment, he claimed he was married with three kids. But Toni tries to commit suicide -- a faulty attempt botched by her attractive playwright neighbor Igor (Rick Lenz). When Julian learns of it, he decides to marry her, and pretends that he's getting a divorce from the wife he doesn't have. Small problem: Toni wants to meet her personally.Julian tries to convince his straightlaced nurse Stephanie (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At first she says no way, but then agrees (partly because she is secretly in love with him... of course). Except then Toni thinks that Stephanie is still in love with Julian, and that his kids will be traumatized by the divorce. So then Julian tries to recruit a fake boyfriend for his fake wife, to give an excuse for the fake divorce... and the web of nonexistant lovers starts to spread.This film is a fun film, not a great film; it's froth, and pretends to be no more. In fact, I guessed the outcome of the movie (give or take a cactus and mink stole) within the first ten minutes. But getting there is half the fun. It's cute to see the little web of lies getting worse and worse, right down to the womanizing pal Harvey telling his idiot girlfriend that he's an agent for the CIA.The trappings of ""Cactus Flower"" are a bit dated now -- the dancing, the store of vinyl records, the clothing, the hippie putting flowers on people's windshields. Fortunately, the script has aged pretty well if you know what ""square"" means. The cluelessness of Hawn's character starts to grate on the nerves (surely NO ONE can be this dim), but it has some funny dialogue.Ingrid Bergman usually got stuck in dramatic, often melancholy roles, but here she gets to bust loose with plenty of acid-tongued barbs, the ""dentist"" dance, not to mention a funny, sexy dance with Igor and a mink stole. Matthau does an excellent job as the increasingly uptight, habitual liar Julian, whom we like despite his jerkishness. Hawn is merely okay; she spends a little too much time biting her lip and looking fawnish, and Lenz is extremely funny, charming and quite underrated.The witty repartee and amusingly predictable plotline make this a fun watch, if you're in the mood for something light and bizarrely romantic.

Directed by the redoubtable stage-to-screen expert Gene Saks, this 1969 comedy is about Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor, who pretends to be married in order to avoid long-term commitment with his young girlfriend of a year, Toni. In response to Toni's half-hearted suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni first insists on meeting his wife to alleviate her conscience. Enter Julian's devoted nurse Stephanie to play the wife, and the inevitable complications ensue with white lies growing into major whoppers that lead to presumed couplings and de-couplings.As Julian, a relaxed Walter Matthau dexterously plays the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic manner, but he lets his two female co-stars walk off with the picture. In her big screen debut, a pixyish 24-year old Goldie Hawn is still retaining her giggly ""Laugh-In"" persona but provides unexpected savvy and depth as Toni. She and Matthau have great, unforced chemistry in their scenes together. Screen legend Ingrid Bergman, still serenely regal at 54, is obviously having a ball playing Stephanie, initially starchy and quick-witted but blossoming into a liberated spirit as the story evolves. I particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp. There is nice supporting work from Rick Lenz as Toni's bohemian neighbor Igor and Jack Weston as Julian's smarmy actor buddy Harvey. Billy Wilder's longtime collaborator, I.A.L. Diamond, provides the sparkling screenplay and opens up the story beyond its stage-bound origins for Saks, who is not the most cinematic of directors.

686525,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00005UWU6,Einsatz,"[1, 2]","This movie was based on a play that was based on another play, Fleur de Cactus.Walter Matthau was 49 when he made this movie.  I was a teenager when I first saw it upon its theatrical release.  What struck me then as odd was the same thing that struck me now, viewing it again all these years later: what's a 24 year woman (Goldie Hawn) doing with a guy rapidly approaching 50?  (Just for the record, Ingrid Bergaman was 54 when she made this movie.)  I never could accept that Goldie Hawn's character would fall for someone of Matthau's age (maybe if Cary Grant had played the part?).  I still don't find it plausible, but whatever; it's still an amusing premise: what do you do when a perfectly good scheme suddenly goes wrong after working so well for a whole year?I also don't buy the part about Goldie's character being ditzy.  She does, after all, get him to snap to attention and do exactly what she wants him to for the rest of the movie.Despite his claim, ""I'm the first decent man she's ever met,"" no one could play a stinker quite like Matthau.  He's matched every step of the way by his buddy, the CIA agent, Jack Weston.  Everyone in the cast works well together, with Ingrid Bergman firmly grounding them to the reality of the situation.  She played my favorite character when I first saw this movie and remains steadfastly so all these years later.

686527,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005UWU6,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","CACTUS FLOWER began life as the French farce FLEUR DE CACTUS by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy.  In 1965 it was adapted to the New York stage by Abe Burrows, Pulitzer Prize winning author of such Broadway hits as HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING.  Originally starring Lauren Bacall, the play was a great success, running over two thousand performances.  It thereafter passed into the hands of I.A.L. Diamond, author of such screenplays as SOME LIKE IT HOT and THE APARTMENT, and with Ingrid Bergman, Walter Matthau, and Goldie Hawn in the leads, it became one of 1970's most popular comedies.At the time, both play and movie were considered pretty racy, and the film was released with a recommendation that it be shown to ""mature audiences"" only.  By today's standards, however, it is pretty mild stuff.  A womanizing dentist (Matthau) has held his girlfriend (Hawn) at bay by pretending to be married--but now he has actually fallen in love with the girl, who feels guilty about causing a divorce.  When she demands to meet his wife, the dentist recruits his nurse (Bergman) to play the part.  Needless to say, complications pile upon complications, but in the manner of romantic comedies everything sorts out to our satisfaction at the end.At times CACTUS FLOWER feels a bit slow, but the charm of its cast is overwhelming.  Goldie Hawn was a popular television star and no one seemed to expect much of her beyond her stock-in-trade kookiness--but she really nails the part of the dingy mistress.  Matthau is also memorable, and supporting player Jack Weston is wickedly funny as a dental patient who gets roped into the game.  But this is really Ingrid Bergman's show.  She was not known for comedy and she was past the age Hollywood considered suitable for leading ladies, but she is marvelous from start to finish.The plot may creak now and then, but the dialogue pops, and the cast puts it over extremely well.  A bit old fashioned, but still fun.  Sadly, the DVD offers nothing in the way of bonuses except a few trailers.

686533,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005UWU6,Kevin Killian,"[3, 4]","It may be sacrilegious to say, but CACTUS FLOWER is a much better picture than those that Billy Wilder was making at roughly the same time.  We watched this, then THE FORTUNE COOKIE in rapid succession, and this one wins by a country mile.  I bring in Wilder's name because in some quarters CACTUS FLOWER has been looked on as a flimsy Billy Wilder rip-off, due to the use of Walter Matthau and also to the scenarist I A L Diamond, who worked wonders on the original Broadway play script to CACTUS FLOWER and really makes it bloom on the screen.  (Only in the cramped dentist set do you feel that you're watching a play transferred to the screen.  Could that set have been any smaller, sometimes you watch Ingrid Bergman try to figure out what to do with her hips as she nears a desk or filing cabinet.)  Diamond squeezed this one in during the long wilderness years for Wilder, between the ragged comeback that was THE FORTUNE COOKIE, and the 1970 megaflop that became THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.  Those two shows seem absolutely dour next to the radiance of CACTUS FLOWER.  Maybe Diamond felt freed up from his own impossible to live up to legacy, and he could just be really dumb.Well, CACTUS FLOWER has a Wilder sort of mise-en-scene anyhow, as Walter Matthau plays a swinging dentist who pretends to be married in order to deceive his young girlfriend, Goldie Hawn.  All the actors play this out as though it were perfectly normal for a 60 year old guy to be ""dating"" a 21 year old hippie girl.  Last week we watched Clint Eastwood's BREEZY where the exact same situation is played out as a problem picture, nearly a tragedy, and yet here it is a sex romp.  Of sorts.  Basically Matthau doesn't understand that his own nurse, Stephanie Dickinson, has been devotedly in love with him for years and years.  And that she, Ingrid Bergman, is the woman for him.I wonder if there's a code of reception for audiences in which we mentally dislike the pairing of the old and the young, so we're prepared for Matthau to switch his affections from Hawn to Bergman, and to let Hawn find romance with the kooky writer next door who saves her from a suicide attempt at the beginning of the film (shades of Diamond's APARTMENT script!) . . .  What's great about Columbia producing this film is all the commercial tie-ins, the product placement which must have seemed super grating and cheesy in its day, but now floats somewhere in the comfort zone.  For example, Goldie works in a Village record shop, and every album on the racks seems to be -- by Columbia records!  (I should say, the majority of them are, but here and again a non-Columbia LP is shown, which must have been a triumph of artistic integrity.)  And my favorite scene is the disco evening, where Ingrid Bergman invents a new dance called the ""Dentist.""  Listen to the parade of Muzaked chartbusters playing in the background while the beautiful people show it off on the dancefloor--everyone of them a Colgems tune--""I'm a Believer,"" ""I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight,"" really, if the Monkees had made an appearance I wouldn't have blinked an eye.
