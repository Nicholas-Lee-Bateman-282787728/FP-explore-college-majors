968952,A1AF8GGNQ6LTBK,B000E5N6B6,,"[0, 4]","The latest in a growing line of slick miniseries produced by the Sci-Fi Channel, Dean Devlin and Bryan Singer's The Triangle draws from a number of standard sci-fi story elements in an effort to provide an original take on a tired enigma.  While the miniseries concerns itself with a mystery long celebrated as unsolvable, The Triangle keeps itself from descending into maddening vagueness by demanding concrete answers from both its characters and its story.  That's not to say this story is not enigmatic, but this is a brain-teasing puzzle with a surprising solution.  Writer Rockne S. O'Bannon should be commended.  The Bermuda Triangle here is more intriguing than it has ever been, kept entertaining by the slow revealing of the shadowy sources of its power.  The threat escalates as the film progresses and scientific theories--ranging from wormholes to alternate realities to exotic matter--are blended into an engaging, reality-threatening cataclysm of apocalyptic proportion.  At the outset, single ships are threatened but by the time of the paradoxical climax, the globe hangs in the balance.  The inevitable time-travel is elegantly handled amidst all of this and the endgame is both intelligent and stunning.The acting here is above average, too, and each of the leads elevates not only their character's role but the film's believability as well.  Eric Stoltz, Bruce Davison, Catherine Bell, and Michael E. Rodgers are excellent as a team of unique experts in unusual fields of study.  Keeping the story emotionally grounded is Lou Diamond Phillips, whose individualized subplot allows us to experience the film's reality-altering oddness through the eyes of an everyman.  The miniseries is beautifully produced, nicely photographed, and the considerable visual effects are always impressive.  More importantly, those effects are used primarily to service the story's intricacies, not as a means of distracting from plot holes.  In fact, The Triangle's most serious flaws are those extended scenes echoing science fiction clich&eacute;s for suspense or drama, chunks of the narrative that will seem all-too familiar--and perhaps, as a result, all-too dull--for fans of the genre.  Conspiracy plotlines wear thin too quickly, the quirks of Davison's psychic irritate as they escalate, and Sam Neill's obsessed magnate is instantly forgettable.  At those moments when the film is successful, however, it plays off of our curiosity and becomes quite gripping.  Viewers have set-out on this sort of strange sea voyage before, but Devlin and Singer manage to make it smart and sexy.  The Triangle does make something old new again; the three-part miniseries takes a host of familiar pseudo-scientific theories and science fiction themes and finds a way to recombine them into something that feels, for the most part, fresh.--Brian A.

Alas, while a satisfying enough diversion for a while, it does not tread any new ground, ideas, or benchmarks in sci-fi.The story revolves more around technobabble than character development, despite some fine acting from almost all involved. Sam Neill is a multi-millionaire shipping magnate who offers a huge sum to a disparate group of experts to solve the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle. As time goes by, it becomes clearer that his motivation is more personal than he at first admits, and that there is a time constraint, as things head from mystery to countdown to disaster.An interesting subplot revolves around the excellent Lou Diamond Phillips, who is one of the victims, experiencing alternate realities as a result of his encounter with the Triangle. Did I say alternate realities..? Yes, you'll have to get used to listening to theories on `exotic matter', `parallel universes', `ripples in space time', `government conspiracies' and `electromagnetic disturbances'.. however the end does tie things together - with the help of a substantial dose of belief suspension. In fact, the ending is just a little too neat and ideal to be truly satisfying. That said, there are plenty of interesting ideas here to keep this fresh enough to be worth viewing.The effects are just up to small screen standard, but never believable enough to make you forget they are special effects. However the acting is, for the most part, excellent, and it is this, particularly from Phillips and from Eric Stolz, that help us suspend belief to make this mini series work.Over the disc we get the three episodes, each just under 1  hours, plus some interview snippets with the principals and a making of documentary.Overall, at the price offered by Amazon, well worth a buy, as long as you do not keep too high expectations.

968963,AAC2GHQF1TG4I,B000E5N6B6,,"[3, 5]","The Triangle is a miniseries originally broadcast on the Sci-Fi channel and now available on DVD. I rented the DVD over this weekend because it's about 255 minutes of running time broken into 3 episodes. This is a very original take on the Bermuda Triangle and time travel discrepancies.You will enjoy this DVD if you enjoy other science fiction series likeThe 4400 - The Complete First SeasonorHeroes - Season 1. The producers include Bryan Singer, director of first 2 X-Men films andSuperman Returns (Widescreen Edition)as well as Dean Devlin, producer ofStargate (Ultimate Edition)andIndependence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition). The cast is exceptional with Eric Stoltz, Sam Neil (Jurassic Park (Widescreen Collector's Edition)), Lou Diamond Phillips, Catherine Bell, Bruce Davidson (twice in X-Men as Senator Robert Kelly), and Michael E. Rodgers. There is also two South African actors in the series with brief roles: Marius Weyers, still with a thick South African accent after all these years and Hakeem Kae-Kazim, originally from Nigeria but primarily based in South Africa. I've met Hakeem a few times and he has awesome energy about him.The plot is simple - it seems. A very rich shipping magnate Eric Benirall (Sam Neill) recruits a group of misfits that include a journalist for a tabloid, a deep ocean resource engineer, a man with genuine psychic abilities and Meteorology professor. They band together in desperate times as they find weird coincidences or as Freud called them uncanny happenings. On the surface it seems straightforward, Benirall's company controls about 1/5th of all ships on the sea at any given time through his cargo company and has lost 6 ships in a short space of time. Later on more deeper reasons emerge as it turns out Benirall lost a brother in the Bermuda Triangle. Each one of the main cast have personal circumstances which adds depth to their characters. The navy it turns out is building a huge machine to counter the effects of the infamous Philadelphia Experiment, in which a ship allegedly disappeared in a scientific experiment in 1943. Please Google this name and read more about it. It has been an integral part of many conspiracy theories over the decades.In summary this is a great action packed, sci-fi thriller. It's also reminiscent of theThe X-Files - Fight the Futurein many ways and pays homage to mixing hard core scientists, with sceptics, with soothsayers. This is a highly recommended DVD to all those who enjoy suspense, unusual events mixed with great science fiction and excellent performances by the cast.

968983,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000E5N6B6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 6]","You do roll the dice with the Sci-Fi Channel when it comes to their made-for-television movies. Mostly, you come up snake eyes. But, every now and then, you land a seven. THE TRIANGLE is one of the good ones, and the hefty budget shows up on screen. THE TRIANGLE features a cast of familiar names. The writing/producing pedigree is solid, what with Bryan Singer and Dean Devlin having co-conspired with the crafting of the story. Teleplay credit goes to Rockne O'Bannon.This mini-series ran for three nights and goes for an epic near four and a half hours, which is a lot of bathroom breaks for a decrepit old bloke like me. I don't think there's anyone out there not clued in to the Bermuda Triangle mystique, and certainly there's familiar terrain covered in this sci-fi thriller. But Singer, Devlin, and O'Bannon keep things interesting and pace the story well. The key lies in the first episode of the mini-series, whether it hooks you in. It sets up the plot, creates a genuinely gripping air of mystery, and introduces the five core actors. By the end of this opening chapter, you're either tantalized and willing to follow these five characters or you don't tune in the next night.A shipping magnate contracts four experts in various fields to investigate why his cargo vessels are mysteriously vanishing in the Sargasso Sea, known more notoriously as the Bermuda Triangle, site of abrupt disappearances of uncountable ships and souls down the centuries. A deep ocean resource engineer (Catherine Bell), a maverick meteorologist (Michael Rodgers), a psychic (Bruce Davison), and a tabloid journalist (Eric Stoltz) all jump at the chance to make five million dollars each, and there's a thought that perhaps all they would have to do is amass a wealth of mumbo-jumbo facts and engage in double speak and dazzle the shipping magnate and, in that manner, earn their sexy paychecks. Except that things abruptly get X-FILES-y. It's not long before the quartet are fully engaged, thoughts of paychecks shoved to the back of the mind. Getting a peek at things beyond the ken of man will do that.We also get a running perspective from a survivor (Lou Diamond Phillips) of yet another baffling phenomena in the Sargasso Sea, and in a lot of ways Meeno Paloma's is the most personal story arc. Meeno returns home after a hospital stint only to find that little things aren't adding up, which eventually leads to big things not adding up. It begins with a wrong-colored truck and escalates to the appearance of a young son who didn't before exist.No one escapes the Bermuda Triangle's spooky influence. Our four investigators eventually begin suffering hallucinations, or what they believe are hallucinations but are actually windows into alternate realities. Ultimately, the fate of the world rests on their and on Meeno Paloma's ability to solve the riddle of the Bermuda Triangle. And, then, at the end of it, there's the epilogue which plays out nicely, which deals with the fallout of our characters' actions. There's a balance in how the characters' fortunes have changed, some for the better, some not so much. Just like you roll the dice when you tune in to a Sci-Fi Channel program, you do the same when you eff around with the space/time continuum.Government conspiracy. Crazy military experiments. Warped realities. Time travel. A race against time. The Ni&ntilde;a, the Pinta, the Santa Maria... The Devil's Triangle is bounded by its three points: Miami, Bermuda, and San Juan. It encompasses 14,000 square miles. Surely, within those desolate, sprawling confines, a lot of things are possible. Including Eric Stoltz and Lou Diamond Phillips anchoring the film with their rather terrific acting. So, good performances, excellent production values, a script that engages and is taut and doesn't insult your intelligence. What?

He hopes these four (with the help of a Greenpeace volunteer who survived an encounter in the Triangle) will discover what is happening, but as they work together and dig deeper, a conspiracy that dates back decades begins to be uncovered, and the very fabric of time and space soon starts to unravel. Will they find out what is happening before the universe is lost?The Triangle is a truly fantastic and wonderful voyage into the unknown, with stunning visual effects and great performances from the cast all around. Bryan Singer (Valkyrie, X-Men) and Dean Devlin (Independence Day, Stargate) worked together with director Craig R.

SyFy, back then the SciFi Channel, understood that the world at large was suddenly celebrating what was supposed to be their niche and came out swinging with a miniseries created by and starring some serious heavy hitters.Enter The Triangle, a 255-minute picture that reads like a Hollywood blockbuster rather than a made-for-television miniseries.  Written by the powerhouse trifecta Bryan Singer (of the first two X-Men films, Superman Returns and the upcoming Battlestar Galactica film), Dean Devlin (Independence Day and Stargate), and living legend Rockne O'Bannon (Farscape and Alien Nation), the production crew was certainly taking no shorts.  The cast, it would turn out, would be no less qualified to deliver the goods.The story centers on billionaire shipping magnate Eric Benirall (played perfectly by Jurassic Park's Sam Neill) who has a record of losing ships in the Bermuda Triangle.  In addition to the resulting financial loss, he begins experiencing troubling hallucinations.  Having enough with the mystery, he assembles a motley group of ""experts"" to provide a reasonable explanation for the mysteries haunting the Bermuda Triangle for centuries.This team consists of tabloid reporter Howard Thomas (Eric Stoltz) a skeptic who only takes the assignment to help make his alimony payments; engineer and overeducated Emily Patterson (played by JAG's Catherine Bell); Stan Lathem (Bruce Davison) a struggling psychic; thrill seeker and Hugh Jackman wannabe Bruce Geller (Michael Rodgers); and finally Greenpeace commando Meeno Paloma (Lou Diamond Phillips) who returns from a disastrous trip through the triangle only to discover that reality is not how he remembers it.So where does The Triangle succeed amidst a swarm of science fiction competition?  Surprisingly, in its pacing.  While a majority of the shows mentioned above were structured as ongoing dramas, The Triangle finds itself neither stretched out across twenty-two episodes nor compressed to fit into the 2-hour timeslot of a motion picture.  Instead, thanks to the miniseries format, it fits neatly between the two extremes with a runtime of roughly five-hours.  In other words, while movies often feel rushed and series tend to stretch out endlessly, The Triangle manages to capture the best of both worlds in its structure and this shows in viewing through brisk pacing and well-developed characters.The 2-disc DVD set breaks the production down into the first two chapters of the series on the first disc and the final chapter on the second.  The second disc also includes a promotion spot originally aired on SyFy with interviews with the cast and crew and some light behind-the-scenes information.  It also contains several Lions Gate trailers ranging in genre from horror to dedicated science fiction.The plot itself is pretty darn spot-on as well, with links and references that tie the Bermuda Triangle phenomena back to Christopher Columbus's famous trip across the ocean-blue on up to the Naval experiments of the 1940s (including the infamous Philadelphia Experiment).The story works off the canvas created by shows like X-Files and Outer Limits in that the day to day tribulations of the lead characters is used as the catalyst to establish a much larger mystery.  And while calling some of the inscrutabilities here spooky may be overdoing it, in truth the presentation of the phenomena requiring investigation is done surprisingly well.  Sometimes in sci-fi less is more, and in this case, the filmmakers wisely combine slick visuals with just enough intrigue to let the viewer's imagination take hold to fill in the blanks.The picture is nearly flawless, in my opinion anyway, throughout the first two sections but only drops the ball a bit in the third and final chapter.  The science is certainly plausible and the plot structure builds itself up into a nice appropriate fever pitch by the end, but the second half of the final segment is definitely the most ""Hollywood"" of the whole production.  Some of the concluding explanations could have been ironed out a bit better and the actual finale itself leaves viewers not entirely sure if the overall experience was satisfying through and through.  Perhaps the third part of the miniseries is the weakest simply because it is the only one of the segments that manages to hint toward the rush and tight scheduling that shooting on a television schedule implies.In all, I found The Triangle to be an entirely enjoyable ride despite some slight shortcomings.  The talent that contributed to this miniseries is evident throughout and a testament to the fact that amazing things are possible, even on a television budget, when enthusiastic individuals bring their enthusiasm to the table.  And unlike many of the other hit science fiction television programs that saw the light of day in 2005, The Triangle ends conclusively; it's tough to put a value on the closure one finds in following along with a show that wasn't cancelled on an unresolved cliffhanger.",4,An Impressive Work from a Year Known for Sci-Fi TV,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,5278,"['was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'apparent',

968998,AFG98PAWML3UC,B000E5N6B6,"snoopy67 ""kelley""","[4, 6]","The Triangle Starring Catherine Bell:The Triangle was a Science Fiction mini-series made by the producers of ""Independence Day"" and ""X-Men"" exclusivly for the ScFi Channel (Should tell you something right there)this is a story about the Bermuda Triangle and about one man's quest to find out why his ships are disappearing there and so he goes forth to assemble a team of ""experts"" to go out and find out the answer to his questions ""With absolute proof"" and if they accomplish this task they will each get five million dollars each.so he gathers a team that consist of 4 people: a meteorologist/adventureer, a has-been psychic,a skeptical tabloid reporter and an Oceanography engineer. also there is a character in a side story about a Greenpeace voleenteer who was the only survivor of his sinking boat while battling a whaling ship that also sank that took place in the Triangle due to the Triangle.the movie was 6 hours long and was in three parts. on the dvd it is four hours and fifteen minutes - but it is still in 3 parts. the opening segment was great. i loved it. i bought the whole thing especially when they kept going to the story of the survivor of the greenpeace boat and his struggles with coping with being the only suvivor and the effect of the Triangle itself had on him. it was a great story, Lou Damond Phillips played him very well. i wish they focused more on him at times throught the movie.however, as the movie went along the more it was hard to believe. there were some great and sometimes powerful images and scenes throughout the whole thing but as it went along towards the end it was getting to caught up in itself. the writers were too into it and obviously loved the ""Nerdy/Geek"" Science fiction and wanted all to know it. towards the end you knew who there audience was it was no longer for the causual viewer.i found the characters, dialogue and even the special effects were cliched.i have seen other movies like this do the same damn thing. they showed me nothing new in the story of the Bermuda Triangle. as a matter of fact i found it offensivly the opposite.i felt that they could have told a better story with just one or two characters then five. it made no sense. i don't why they needed the tabloid reporter. it wasn't like he was the narrorator of the story.at first i found the Special effects appropriate and well done. but as the movie went on they seemed like they wanted to do them just because they could and they began to look hokey and cartoonish - very out-of-place as they came to the conclusion. the theories they picked to explain the triangle was at first believable but they kept changing it to where they -i guess- picked all of them and decided to painfully explain them all using polysyllabic words to make it sound intellegent leaving nothing for the audience to figure out for themselves even if we could understand it. and by the way, a lot of what they said in the film was wrong. they said the Alantic ocean had the deepest water. not true. it the pacific. i think around the coral sea. (an example)but inspite of all this. there are moments that are very good and outside the box of cookie cutter ScFi (not much though) it was well casted. everyone did a good job with what the had to work with and so i will give this a fair to good rating. but i guess it is for people like the Nerdy/Geeky ScFi die-hard fans who more interested in the psedo-science and the hard to believe fiction in their ScFi. or for people like me a Catherine Bell fan. and this was her movie.Catherine Bell plays a strong woman (on ScFi standards) named Emily Patterson, an Oceanography engineer who was recruited to join the team to figure out the mysteries of the triangle.Catherine Bell Played her well. She Radiates here. she is the Focual point when ever she's on camera. she breathtaking and she holds her own with the rest of the great cast and even betters them. my favorite scene of hers is the one with her real mother who is not really there but in another timeline with her. (Don't even ask me to explain it.) there sitting in her kitchen, having dinner. the room is lit with candles and thunderstorm is going on outside. it a very conversational scene. they are bonding. Emily ask her mother what her name is then asked her whay she put her up for adoption (in her timeline) her mother, understandly has no idea what she's talking about. i think that was a good piece of acting by catherine. i was moved. it was a sweet scene. well done-paced. it is probably my favorite scene in the whole movie. scenes like that are peppered throughtout the movie. but most come and go and them it get ridicules again.i think this was Catherines best effort. but it was done on a pretty much wasted movie. but i own the a copy of it. i will probably watch it again. but mainly for CatBell. because of her it is worth it.",4,i got it for Catherine Bell she rocks...the movie justs rolls.,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,4860,"['Triangle', 'Starring', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'Triangle',

The acting is fantastic (great cast!), the storyline is plausible, thrilling and action-packed. The special effects are insane (and there's more of them here than in X-men 2!)And the scientific quality of the movie is way above par for most sci-fi films of the last decade! Basically everyone involved is awesome.Let me add another element here too. I have studied the Bermuda Triangle most of my life. I know all the theories, and this series manages to touch on all of them, while creating an entirely new and unpredictable explanation for the phenomena. The idea is highly unlikely naturally, but fascinating. It may help to be familiar with the subject so to speak, but even without, this is a mind-bending event. There are a plethora of paradoxes that work, ironies and events that are recurrent enough to keep everything tight and consistent. I think for anyone paying attention, this is a cinematic event that pays the viewer well for their time. In fact, as a huge cinemaphile, i think this mini-series is the best thing i've seen all year. Certainly better than any of the recycled drivel Hollywood had pumped out.If you like action, solid acting, good cinematography, tight special effects, or any of the other elements that make watching a movie worthwhile, I highly recommend investing the 4 plus hours to see this. To Bryan Singer and Dean Devlin, thank you! I've been missing real science fiction!",5,The Ultimate Sci-Fi Mini-series!!!,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,1474,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'would', 'give', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'great', 'cast', 'storyline', 'plausible', 'thrilling', 'action-packed', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'insane', 'more', 'here', 'X-men', '2', 'scientific', 'quality', 'movie', 'way', 'par', 'most', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'Basically', 'everyone', 'involved', 'add', 'element', 'here', 'too', 'have', 'studied', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'most', 'life', 'know', 'theories', 'series', 'touch', 'creating', 'entirely', 'new', 'unpredictable', 'explanation', 'phenomena', 'idea', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'naturally', 'fascinating', 'may', 'help', 'be', 'familiar', 'subject', 'so', 'speak', 'even', 'mind-bending', 'event', 'are', 'plethora', 'paradoxes', 'work', 'ironies', 'events', 'are', 'recurrent', 'enough', 'keep', 'everything', 'tight', 'consistent', 'think', 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'cinematic', 'event', 'viewer', 'well', 'time', 'fact', 'huge', 'cinemaphile', 'i', 'think', 'mini-series', 'best', 'thing', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Certainly', 'better', 'recycled', 'drivel', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'pumped', 'action', 'solid', 'acting', 'good', 'cinematography', 'tight', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'elements', 'make', 'watching', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'highly', 'recommend', 'investing', '4', 'hours', 'see', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Dean', 'Devlin', 'thank', ""'ve"", 'been', 'missing', 'real', 'science', 'fiction']","Triangle, The"
