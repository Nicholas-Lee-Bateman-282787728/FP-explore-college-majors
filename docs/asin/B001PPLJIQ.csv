Her defense (just as Eichmann's in his trial) was that she was just doing her job.  Thus the banality of evil because in the end evil on such a scale can only be accomplished by thousands of people who are only doing what they're told.  And we feel for this woman a bit because she likes to be read to from Homer which makes her all too human.  She's sort of like us in a lot of ways.

1228680,A2K6XRL5PUKWJ9,B001PPLJIQ,abbyjo,"[3, 4]","What is the power of written word? Like most good films, this asks more questions than it answers.Hanna is illiterate.  During the war, she was SS. She was one of six women who locked three hundred people in a church during the war, and burned them alive.  One of these victims survived and wrote a book. Twenty years after the war, Hanna was given life in prison when the other five women received four years each. She accepted the greater punishment because she was too embarrassed to admit she was illiterate. She spent 20 years in prison, never married or had a child.Michael read to her.  Michael taught her how to read.The film explores whether the crime is forgivable? Can survivors forgive? Can Michael forgive? Did Hanna deserve the greater punishment she received? To what degree can we forgive someone who does not know what they do because they cannot read or write? Is it an explanation or an excuse for her actions? Are human crimes ever forgivable? Is &#34;wartime&#34; an excuse? Is forgiveness what makes us human? Hanna could not forgive herself after she learned how to read and realized what she was responsible for.  For her, responsibility was everything. She could not accept responsibility until she could read and understand...and then she did. Is this justice?I myself am the only child of a WW2 holocaust orphan. My father, as a young boy of 17, arrived in Chicago before my five aunts, uncles and two grandparents were taken to the same camp Michael walks through in one of the scenes of the film. Perhaps I am alone now because of what SS did over sixty years ago. My relatives don't know me. Too much time has passed. Too many generations in between. Yet I feel no anger toward the character of Hanna.Can I forgive? Perhaps by contributing to literacy, we forgive a little.  It's not absolution. That, like the survivor says in the film, is not forthcoming. But illiteracy can be cured by reading, by learning how to read. And that's a start toward healing. With understanding comes healing. Forgiveness perhaps is down the road a bit from healing.In a strange way, Hanna is every girl who wants to hear a bedtime story.  And do we not all do this now when we point, click or push the button to start a film? We ask the universe, please, tell me a story. And we attend, we listen.

1228683,A3GLX47PF4ZN9T,B001PPLJIQ,Alex,"[2, 2]","The Reader is a tragedy that draws enough hope and profundity to make it transcend depression. It is a story about the nature of good intentions and how these are warped by the chaotic cold world they manifest in. I'd rather you not read this review if you haven't seen the movie: it's a romance with interesting people and a tragic plot that I loved, despite being an average twenty year old guy with a streak of hating period pieces, romances, and reflective movies alike. This was the first time I've seen this particular movie, while most of the rest in its genre have been recycled since the 20s and 30s. If that sounds good to you, go see it and don't spoil it with this self indulgent review. Otherwise, go ahead.The film begins when a young man and an older woman meet and create an affair that veritably reeks of springtime, birds, and new love.  The relationship is perfect in its balance: Michael draws wonder and awe from his experienced Hannah, who in turn gains strength and purpose from his invigorating youth. Matthias Habich is excellent as a boy who is honest and quietly brave and magnanimous. Kate Winslet is transcendent as a dutiful and simple goddess for her lover. I related to Michael easily. I wasn't as intuiting and graceful as a fifteen year old, and he allowed me a window to see how it could have been. During the first hour I relived a year as it could have been in late 50s West Germany with a mysterious, gorgeous creature to come home to. It was beautiful.The tragedy begins when Michael begins to outgrow his Hannah but misses opportunities when his more stunning and socially appropriate classmate Sophia unsuccessfully tries to engage him. Now out of a familiarity and attachment to Hannah he returns again and again to her apartment, reading to her and making love, forming his identity with her as a part. When Hannah leaves unexpectedly, Michael is left with a gap in experience and comfort in relationships with women his age that he never truly fills; when he goes to college, he turns down the invitations of a beautiful coed so that he can study. Even while maintaining outward self confidence, he has lost a building block of his personage.The second hour reveals the true craggy ice block beneath the iceberg of beauty and connection that was visible above the surface in the previous romance. Michael takes a law seminar that leads him to a Nazi trial where Hannah has been charged with war crimes, as it is revealed that she had once been an SS guard. As Michael is torn apart by this revelation, the film contemplates morality and guilt with a light sweep that is heavy enough to create poignancy but not indulgent enough to be clich&eacute;. It ends with a redemption of Hannah as she teaches herself to read, which is a great ending: nothing is really solved, but the characters have all made it through an impossibly difficult situation and are now catching their breath on the other side.The Reader has an amazing classical score, terrific acting, and a truly significant plot.

Young Michael Berg (David Kross) has an affair to remember with Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet)2. They alternate between bed covers and book covers3. It ends abruptly4. Michael carries it in his heart for the rest of his life5. As a young law student, he encounters her again under highly unusual circumstances6. Her secret shame becomes her undoingThe movie is told mostly through the recollections of the adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes).  Although the subject matter is dark, and Hanna's career choice disturbing, Winslet does both the simplicity and complexity of her character so well that you'll empathize with her, even while hating what she becomes through fate and circumstance.  This is a character that you should have no sympathy for, but don't be surprised if you find yourself surreptitiously wiping away a tear towards the end of the movie.An unforgettable story that will stay with you after the credits have rolled, and a magnificent performance by Winslet, surpassing even her award-winning performance inRevolutionary Road.Hanna Schmitz: ""It doesn't matter what I think.

I was intrigued by the premise.The book was indeed a pager-turner.  And, what you take from a book, you expect on the screen.  This is for me, is what I got from this adaptation:  fulfillment.***I came across some sparse reviews and a few comments like the movie was slow; Kate Winslet's ""Hanna"" was flat; her (Winslet's) facial expressions weren't expressive enough.  This may be true for a different character in a different story, but it is an accurate translation of the character that Schlink wrote about.The issue with Hanna is that she was a woman of a different age.  Education (at least for women in the early part of the 20th century Europe) was strictly a class privilege.  Clearly, Hanna and her family had no resources to invest in her education.  She (like in the book) just one day existed when she got a job as a ticketer on a trolley.Because there was no expectations of her, there was nothing that she could aspire to be.  So, simple things such as reading a book, writing a letter or having indepth conversations were not her place.THIS is what we're seeing on the screen: someone who's own lack of awareness and social mobility made her invisible and, some may say, in capable of relating to another human being beyond the common needs that we all have.This is demonstrated when she first meets with a young, Michael-- a 15 year old high school student who fell sick at her feet as they crossed paths in front of her building.  We'd also learn of her chivalrous acts in the prison camp.  The real tragedy is that no one, even when they recognize her humanity, ever stopped to validate her efforts.In many ways, Michael is also a self-centered, or impersonally introspective to the degree that he is unable to voice his concerns about her in a way that would make her visible-- psychologically visible-- to herself and later to the court.I liked the double-entendre here, because you do have the binding tie of a book being read about other people and yet no one connected with Michael or Hanna actually got a good read of them.This, I would argue, is the beauty of this film.",5,An Accurate Translation of The Book,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,2194,"['remember', 'when', 'Oprah', 'announced', 'Bernard', 'Schlink', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'Book', 'Club', 'selection', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise.The', 'book', 'was', 'indeed', 'pager-turner', 'what', 'take', 'book', 'expect', 'screen', 'what', 'got', 'adaptation', 'fulfillment', '***I', 'came', 'sparse', 'reviews', 'few', 'comments', 'movie', 'was', 'slow', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Hanna', 'was', 'flat', 'Winslet', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', ""n't"", 'expressive', 'enough', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'different', 'character', 'different', 'story', 'accurate', 'translation', 'character', 'Schlink', 'wrote', 'about.The', 'issue', 'Hanna', 'was', 'woman', 'different', 'age', 'Education', 'least', 'women', 'early', 'part', '20th', 'century', 'Europe', 'was', 'strictly', 'class', 'privilege', 'Clearly', 'Hanna', 'family', 'had', 'resources', 'invest', 'education', 'book', 'just', 'one', 'day', 'existed', 'when', 'got', 'job', 'ticketer', 'trolley.Because', 'was', 'expectations', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'aspire', 'be', 'So', 'simple', 'things', 'such', 'reading', 'book', 'writing', 'letter', 'having', 'indepth', 'conversations', 'were', 'not', 'place.THIS', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'screen', 'someone', 'who', 'own', 'lack', 'awareness', 'social', 'mobility', 'made', 'invisible', 'may', 'say', 'capable', 'relating', 'human', 'being', 'common', 'have.This', 'demonstrated', 'when', 'first', 'young', 'Michael', '15', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'fell', 'sick', 'feet', 'crossed', 'paths', 'front', 'building', ""'d"", 'also', 'learn', 'chivalrous', 'acts', 'prison', 'camp', 'real', 'tragedy', 'one', 'even', 'when', 'recognize', 'humanity', 'ever', 'stopped', 'validate', 'efforts.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Michael', 'also', 'self-centered', 'impersonally', 'introspective', 'degree', 'unable', 'voice', 'concerns', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'visible', 'psychologically', 'visible', 'later', 'court.I', 'liked', 'double-entendre', 'here', 'do', 'have', 'binding', 'tie', 'book', 'being', 'read', 'other', 'people', 'yet', 'one', 'connected', 'Michael', 'Hanna', 'actually', 'got', 'good', 'read', 'them.This', 'would', 'argue', 'beauty', 'film']",N/A
1228694,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B001PPLJIQ,Andrew Desmond,"[0, 0]","""The Reader"" is a thoroughly captivating and engrossing film.  Two hours speed by as the viewer is transported to post war Germany and the steamy affair between Michael Berg, a boy of fifteen, and Hanna Schmitz, a woman of twice his age.  We then see the story move between a series of time line changes that serve to fit in the various missing pieces until the film's conclusion in 1995.Schmitz is played by Kate Winslet who deservedly won an Oscar for her role.  She is totally believable as the woman with the sordid pass.  Indeed, as the film reveals in due course, she was a member of the SS and is brought before a tribunal charged with mass murder.  This trial has a huge impact on Michael Berg who, by this time, is a law student studying the case.  He is confronted with his own past.  His first lover is there before him charged with the most heinous of crimes.  He is torn between trying to forget his own past and the compulsion to help the woman.  He chooses the former and Schmitz is jailed for life.  Berg is distraught.  Has he chosen the right course?There are some critics who believe ""The Reader"" glamorises perpetrators of the Jewish holocaust.  This view is mistaken.  The holocaust was obviously a great and evil crime.  Yet, in its wake, it created stories with their own inherent dramas.  This is one of those cases.  It does not seek to relieve the guilty of blame.  It simply tells a story of those involved.  ""The Reader"" does this magnificently.My recommendation to critics is simple.  Go see this film.  It is symptomatic of an event that resonates to this day.",4,Captivating,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,1590,"['Reader', 'thoroughly', 'captivating', 'engrossing', 'film', 'Two', 'hours', 'speed', 'viewer', 'transported', 'post', 'war', 'Germany', 'steamy', 'affair', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'boy', 'fifteen', 'Hanna', 'Schmitz', 'woman', 'twice', 'age', 'then', 'see', 'story', 'move', 'series', 'time', 'line', 'changes', 'serve', 'fit', 'various', 'missing', 'pieces', 'film', 'conclusion', '1995.Schmitz', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'totally', 'believable', 'woman', 'sordid', 'pass', 'Indeed', 'film', 'reveals', 'due', 'course', 'was', 'member', 'SS', 'brought', 'tribunal', 'charged', 'mass', 'murder', 'trial', 'huge', 'impact', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'who', 'time', 'law', 'student', 'studying', 'case', 'confronted', 'own', 'past', 'first', 'lover', 'there', 'charged', 'most', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'torn', 'trying', 'forget', 'own', 'past', 'compulsion', 'help', 'woman', 'former', 'Schmitz', 'jailed', 'life', 'Berg', 'distraught', 'chosen', 'right', 'course', 'are', 'critics', 'who', 'believe', 'Reader', 'perpetrators', 'Jewish', 'holocaust', 'view', 'mistaken', 'holocaust', 'was', 'obviously', 'great', 'evil', 'crime', 'wake', 'created', 'stories', 'own', 'inherent', 'dramas', 'one', 'cases', 'not', 'seek', 'relieve', 'guilty', 'blame', 'simply', 'story', 'involved', 'Reader', 'magnificently.My', 'recommendation', 'critics', 'simple', 'Go', 'see', 'film', 'symptomatic', 'event', 'day']",N/A
1228695,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001PPLJIQ,Andrew Ellington,"[220, 263]","I am writing this review on Oscar Nomination morning (although due to the fact that I refuse to post a review until the DVD has dropped you will be reading this much later) mostly due to my elation that it has been nominated for not only the marvelous performance by Kate Winslet (in the right category mind you) but also for Best Picture, Best Director and Adapted Screenplay.  I've been chomping at the bit to write this review ever since I walked out of the theater a few weeks back, and since then I've seen the film a record three times and I would watch it again right now if I could.  I've pondered this film, discussed this film, relived this film and can honestly label it the best film of the year and quite possibly one of the best films I've seen in a long time.Sure, you can be quick to pinpoint it's supposed faults, and you can try and label it something that it is not, but if you allow your eyes to open and your mind to absorb you may be able to see this for what it really is; a masterpiece.When sitting down to write this review I asked my friend how I was going to be able to do so without being redundant or irritating.  I mean, how many different ways can you say masterpiece before someone says ""I get the point, now move on""?  I'm going to try and get all that out of the way right now so that my review will be palatable.`The Reader' is a masterpiece.Okay, I'm done now.Having read Bernhard Schlink's beautiful novel I was really anticipating this film.  I feel that Kate Winslet is the finest working actress today and this just seemed like such an ideal role for her (Oscar, if you pass her over this year I vow to never watch another telecast).  I of course try and shrug off all `high expectations', and thankfully with `The Reader' there was no hype.  It hasn't been hailed as the best of anything, and while it has landed on a few top ten lists it rarely breaks close to the top.  The reviews have been mixed, some raving it as a masterpiece, some labeling it a faux; an imitation of a more insightful film.  The only awards the film has garnered up until the point have been for Winslet so walking into the film, I was not feeding into hype.I was simply hoping to see a good movie.The film tells the story of Michael Berg, a young fifteen year old boy living in Post-WWII Germany.  One day while making his way home he falls ill and is helped back by an older woman named Hanna.  After waiting out his illness he attempts to thank Hanna but he winds up falling into a steamy affair.  The two bond over books, using reading as a form of foreplay, and the two become almost inseparable.  Then for no apparent reason Hanna leaves town without a word and Michael is left wondering why his only love has left him.  Years later while Michael is attending law school he gets the opportunity to sit in on a trial being held over war crimes and is stunned, and ultimately heartbroken, to see Hanna is one of the accused.First and foremost it should be addressed that this is not your typical Holocaust film, for quite frankly the Holocaust is the least impressionable part of this film.  The film, like the novel, deals strongly with the feelings of guilt and redemption.  There is a moral play that runs throughout each scene that begs the audience to cast judgment, but not in an absolute way but in a more complex and understanding way.  `The Reader' has no easy answers, but it throws at the audience a bit of a conundrum.  It reminds me very much of `Dead Man Walking', a film that appears to have such an easy answer yet causes you to rip apart your own ideals.I am keeping SPOILERS to a minimum here, but be forewarned that there may be a few.When we meet Michael and Hanna they seem like an odd match.  He is obviously better off financially than she is.  He is attending school and is doing rather well.  Hanna is working a dead end job and living in a small apartment.  Her education is limited but her yearning for more is apparent.  There is an attraction physically, which cannot be denied.  While Hanna is rough due to the nature of her life she is a diamond in the rough, a beautiful woman trapped within the shell of her former life.  Michael is young and coming into his own; a handsome boy with a head on his shoulders.There's innocence within him that Hanna desires.Their relationship is very fast and very graphic, but there is a sincerity there that one needs to truly look for.  Some have complained that the relationship was pure surface; nothing but lust.  They are missing something crucial.  `The Reader' is a film filled with quiet moments that speak volumes about the characters.  There is a deeper connection between these two souls, one that maybe they can't even recognize.  There is a moment where Hanna finds herself inside a small church listening to a young choir and the tears are streaming down her face, and as Michael watches her from the doorway we can see it; even if he or even she doesn't truly understand it.It is there.As the film progresses and the two are separated we begin to truly see the deeper connection that they are feeling for the first time.  As the trial proceeds Michael is caught between his own feelings of right and wrong; between what is ethical and what is not.  He is disturbed by the revelations concerning his former love; distraught over what this means for him and whether or not it had anything to do with his personal attachment to this woman.Can he bring himself to hate her?  Can he bring himself to forgive her?  Does she deserve that hatred or that forgiveness?There is a moment when Michael is attempting to visit Hanna in prison when everything makes sense; his eyes swelling with an emotion he has yet to fully realize.  He struggles to convince himself that he hates this woman, because hating her would make it easier to forget her.`The Reader' is a masterfully crafted tale of love and loss; of what we tell ourselves in order to better understand something we haven't the capacity to grasp.  There is the shame in Hanna's eyes as she hides her secret (one that you no doubt had guessed long before it was revealed, but the revealing of the secret is not really the point of the story), willing to sacrifice her very life so as not to be downgraded or looked down on.  There is the guilt in Michael's eyes as he blames himself for Hanna's fate, unable to step outside his skin long enough to decide the correct course to case.  This is a story about mistakes and missteps and regrets and the ultimate loss that comes from not fully understanding how to feel.Technically, this is a flawless film.  I remember reviewing `...Jesse James...' last year (this site still won't let me type in that full name) and going on and on about how technically perfect it was, from the cinematography to the score to the lighting to the mood to just about everything.  `The Reader' is the exact opposite in scope yet just as profound.  It is a much subtler film, and so the score, the lighting, the cinematography and the set designs are smaller, yet just as pristine.  Everything is so crisp and delicate; adding layers to the mood perfectly presented by director Stephen Daldry.  I was a little hesitant about Daldry's ability to transfer Schlink's novel to the big screen.  I loved `Billy Elliott' and continue to love it more and more every time I watch it, but Daldry's latest effort was that 2002 debacle `The Hours' and so I was truly afraid that he was going to run the same gamut and deliver a similar piece.`The Reader' is not only much more profound and poignant, but it is also executed much better than `The Hours' (to be fair, I need to watch this movie again, but I was not impressed the first or second go around).When it all boils down to it though, this movie is all about two things; Kate Winslet and David Kross.  Both actors deliver career highs (and to say that about Winslet is saying a lot since she is always top notch).  Their performances are truly organic.  That has become my new favorite word this year, for I feel as though it truly taps into the depth of these performances.  There is a naturalness that fortifies itself within these performances, deepening with each flicker in the eyes or twitch under the skin.  Try your hardest to watch Winslet's face (I know it's hard, especially since she is without clothing for practically the whole first hour of the film).  There is a scene where she is lying in the bathtub and Kross comes in to hash out their argument.  As he speaks you can see for the first time her hard exterior melting away and revealing this woman that she doesn't even know exists.  It is so subtle yet so profound.Winslet is utter perfection.Kross is just as superb, sinking into his character and delving deep into his emotional responses to his current situation.  The scene in the courtroom (all of the courtroom scenes are beyond breathtaking) when he notices Hanna for the first time is utterly immobilized.  Watch as Kross exhibits such a natural gut reaction; as controlled as he can be yet giving way to lapses of uncontrollability.The supporting cast is also superb, from Fiennes' dynamic understanding of Michael's emotional regression to Bruno Ganz's grasp of the real situation at hand.  The one standout here is truly Olin, who proves to be one of the most important facets of the film.  Her final scene with Fiennes is what makes the movie work, dispelling any easy sympathies for Hanna's atrocities with her cold standing.  For anyone who has complained (and there have been many) that this film tries to condone the actions taken by Hanna I urge you to rewatch and study this scene, for in a few short words Hanna's actions are condemned wholeheartedly.Remember, it is not her actions that we are sympathizing with, it is her inner person; cold and rigged yet incomplete, pleading for something or someone to make her feel whole.Thanks in large part to David Hare's marvelous adaptation, `The Reader' lives up to its source material and delivers a truly outstanding and utterly astounding look at this tragic yet beautiful love story.  If you walk away from `The Reader' unmoved then maybe you are just plain unmovable.I'll close by saying that the Oscar's have passed, Kate won the gold (YES!!!) and I still agree wholeheartedly with every word in this review.",5,A profoundly moving and intellectual masterpiece...,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,10318,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'morning', 'due', 'fact',

1228696,A28T0Y6Z2MRIIQ,B001PPLJIQ,Andrew Griffiths,"[1, 2]","I have just watched the film for the third time. There is one loose end which made me feel unsatisfied when I left my seat. We never got to see what role Hanna REALLY played in the burning down of the church. Normally, films show flashbacks to what happened).

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 7]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***Maybe it's just me, but I'm sort of surprised that the Jewish community hasn't gotten a tad up-in-arms over this film. I mean, it really sets a seriously sympathetic tone for a death-camp guard with unfortunate circumstances. I realize she wasn't well educated and had to make tough decisions in order to survive, but so did many people who came out of the holocaust ...Germans among them. But usually NOT death-camp personnel who were the overseers of those who went into gas chambers.Still, this film is well-acted thanks to the amazing performance of Kate Winslet (The Holiday) as Hannah Schmitz, the guard in question. Although I won't take anything away from the other actors in this film, particularly young David Kross as Michael Berg, the boy turning into a man with the help of Hannah's sexual appeal, I will say that, without Winslet, this film likely would've fallen flat, theatrically.Set across generations of Germans and Germany, the story is loaded with historical interest surrounding the holocaust courts that were set up after WWII. Hannah, not surprisingly, is a keystone for the courts as they uncover what they think is her sole involvement in the ordering of the deaths of Jewish women in one of the camps. Circling back to her time at the camps as a guard, it is quickly surmised (by the movie watcher and Michael, but not the courts) that Hannah has never learned to read, so has those she's about to condemn read to her.The condemnation is set up in a way that allows Hannah to remember those she's let loose into the gas chambers; a sort of penance for what she is ""forced"" to do. In a similar manner, she condemns young Michael to a life of lovelessness in that he can never forget her, his first true love. And when Michael goes to school to become a lawyer, he and his classmates are soon brought into the case involving Hannah, but only as spectators. But for Michael, much more is apparent. He has the chance to save Hannah from the courts but is forced into a moral conundrum: Is she worth saving? Is she deserving?The story continues as we watch Hannah's prison years pass by. With her age comes knowledge and words. Michael sends her packages containing books on tape that he recorded for her, emboldening Hannah to learn to read on her own. Which she does. But is it too late for personal forgiveness and redemption?The ending hits pretty hard at these core issues. Personal responsibility. Moral condemnation. Rule of law. Historical atrocity. All of these are intertwined to form a patina of the past that blurs the future.The film is watchable mainly for the purposes of Kate Winslet. Her performance is absolutely stellar.

It is not a romantization ofthat involvement. On the contrary, it lays bare those complicit in the crimes of killing of innocents. Winslet's amazing and multi-layered portrayal of a woman did remind me of Streep in Sophie's Choice in that she was desperate to cling onto life while at the same time flinging it away from her. Her knowledge of her past actions is sublimely subtle.The young lawyer has to grapple with the crimes of his ancestors and indeed, that is Germany today.

The reasons for comparison are that this is another Holocaust story, of someone who is responsible for others' deaths in the Holocaust.  Sophy was played by the young Meryl Streep whereas this female lead is played by Kate Winslet, who is an acting powerhouse who can be compared to Streep.  Finally, in both stories there was also a love aspect to and because of the lead's culpability in atrocity, that love story cannot be fully realized.The problem is that SOPHIE'S CHOICE was an electrifying movie which engaged the viewer on every level. Sophie was deeply tragic and your heart was broken by the end of the movie for her and the mentally deranged Nathan.  But this movie is hardly electrifying.  It seems almost academic in comparison, the way it plods along.The premise is this: Hanna (Kate Winslet) has an affair with a young man and the part she likes best about their affair is when he reads to her, no matter what it is he reads.  They part and much, much later, she is tried as a war criminal for following orders which resulted in many people's deaths in the Holocaust.  As a ""good German,"" she went along with the Nazi party line and frankly does not see that she had any other choice.  Her lover is now a grown, middle aged German man himself (Fiennes) and he watches her trial and is torn by conflicting emotions.  He cannot doubt her complicity because it comes out in the trial that she liked prisoners to read to her, just like he read to her.  This compounds his horror at what she has done.Ralph Fiennes is capable of being every bit as electrifying as Kevin Kline was in SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  For some reason though, it never happens.  Since we have two powerhouse actors here that never catch fire, I can only assume it is the writing and the directing which are the problem.Let me also add that in 2009, this is well covered literary material.  I am sure there will always be someone somewhere who writes something of great merit of the events which took place during WWII.  However, so much has been written by this point, and so much of it is FABULOUS, that any writer who tackles this thematically is taking on a path well trod.

1228725,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B001PPLJIQ,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay as well as a nomination for Kate Winslet for Best Actress and is based on Bernhard Schlink's novel of the same name.It is the story of a young fifteen year old boy on the verge of sexual maturity, Michael Berg, living in the days of adjustment in Germany in the few years following World War II. He comes from an upper-class home with educated parents. While coming home from school, he becomes sick and vomits on the doorstep of a woman who helps him get home. This woman, Hanna, is a central character in the film. He has scarlet fever and after 3 months recovers from the illness, but something about the woman has captured his attention, even when he was ill, and he returns to thank her for her kindness. This somewhat unlikely pair begins an affair. Michael has a sexual awakening but also full romantic attachment to Hanna. She on the other hand seems very isolated and her motivations are more dark and uncertain.  When Michael complains about school, she invites him to read to her and soon they are making love and reading on a regular basis. The two go on a picnic where Hanna asks Michael to read the menu for her. Both Hanna and Michael are physically beautiful and the attraction seems natural even though she is twice his age. But then Hanna disappears and moves out of town and Michael is totally heartbroken as only a young first love can be hurt. We see him interacting with his peers, becoming sexually active, but always a bit more aloof and removed and unreachable than his peers. Many years later, while attending law school, he enrolls in a seminar that requires that he attend some trials of war criminals and sees that Hanna is one of those being prosecuted. It turns out that Hanna was a prison guard at a woman's prison where a terrible fire broke out and the guards would not release the women, condemning them to death.At this point, it appears that maybe Hanna was seeking something innocent and fresh in her love affair with Michael, a sensation that could not last as she tries to escape her past and her guilt. Thus for her the affair was about lust for a beautiful bright and innocent young man as a way to regain her own lost innocence.As the trial proceeds Michael is ambivalent in his feelings toward Hanna, having a difficult time separating the anger he feels for her leaving him with the anger he may feel for her war crime.  He is not caught between his own feelings of right and wrong, for he knows what she did was wrong. He is caught between his personal anger toward her for running away and his more intellectual concerns around the crimes and her role in them.Michael will need to forgive her to emotionally move onward with his life. During the trial, Michael learns something that could make a real difference in the length of Hanna's sentence. Yet he does not act and there is considerable ambivalence here for we are uncertain if he fails to act because he wishes to protect Hanna's dignity or because he has yet to forgive her and thus is removed from her fate. There may also be a bit of revenge acting here as Michael has information that could impact the sentence given to Hanna and yet he withholds the information.But if we are unable to forgive, who do we really hurt?  Michael was once a victim of an older woman who had sex with him as a boy and then left him when he was most in love. But the inability to forgive Hanna turns Michael into his own tormentor.Director Stephen Daldry does a perfect job at capturing the cool world of post WW II Germany. Kate Winslet and David Kross are excellent. Ralph Fiennes is the only disappoint for he plays David too coldly, too icy, too removed and emotionless. Once again David Hare has done an exceptional adaptation of the novel into the screenplay.The film is thoughtful, well acted, beautifully photographed, and remains a rich puzzle even after you have seen it to the end.",4,Thoughtful puzzle about motives and forgiveness,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,3962,"['film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'nomination', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Best', 'Actress', 'based', 'Bernhard', 'Schlink', 'novel', 'same', 'name.It', 'story', 'young', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'verge', 'sexual', 'maturity', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'living', 'days', 'adjustment', 'Germany', 'few', 'years', 'following', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'upper-class', 'home', 'educated', 'parents', 'coming', 'home', 'school', 'sick', 'vomits', 'doorstep', 'woman', 'who', 'get', 'home', 'woman', 'Hanna', 'central', 'character', 'film', 'scarlet', 'fever', '3', 'months', 'recovers', 'illness', 'something', 'woman', 'captured', 'attention', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'ill', 'thank', 'kindness', 'somewhat', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'affair', 'Michael', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'also', 'full', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'Hanna', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'isolated', 'motivations', 'are', 'more', 'dark', 'uncertain', 'When', 'Michael', 'school', 'read', 'soon', 'are', 'making', 'love', 'reading', 'regular', 'basis', 'two', 'go', 'picnic', 'where', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'read', 'menu', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'are', 'physically', 'beautiful', 'attraction', 'natural', 'even', 'twice', 'age', 'then', 'Hanna', 'disappears', 'town', 'Michael', 'totally', 'heartbroken', 'only', 'young', 'first', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'hurt', 'see', 'interacting', 'peers', 'becoming', 'sexually', 'active', 'always', 'bit', 'more', 'aloof', 'removed', 'unreachable', 'peers', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'attending', 'law', 'school', 'seminar', 'attend', 'trials', 'war', 'criminals', 'sees', 'Hanna', 'one', 'being', 'prosecuted', 'out', 'Hanna', 'was', 'prison', 'guard', 'woman', 'prison', 'where', 'terrible', 'fire', 'broke', 'out', 'guards', 'would', 'not', 'release', 'women', 'condemning', 'death.At', 'point', 'maybe', 'Hanna', 'was', 'seeking', 'something', 'innocent', 'fresh', 'love', 'affair', 'Michael', 'sensation', 'could', 'not', 'last', 'escape', 'past', 'guilt', 'Thus', 'affair', 'was', 'about', 'lust', 'beautiful', 'bright', 'innocent', 'young', 'man', 'way', 'regain', 'own', 'lost', 'innocence.As', 'trial', 'proceeds', 'Michael', 'ambivalent', 'feelings', 'Hanna', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'separating', 'anger', 'leaving', 'anger', 'may', 'feel', 'war', 'crime', 'not', 'caught', 'own', 'feelings', 'right', 'wrong', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'wrong', 'caught', 'personal', 'anger', 'running', 'away', 'more', 'intellectual', 'concerns', 'crimes', 'role', 'them.Michael', 'will', 'need', 'forgive', 'emotionally', 'move', 'onward', 'life', 'trial', 'Michael', 'something', 'could', 'make', 'real', 'difference', 'length', 'Hanna', 'sentence', 'not', 'act', 'considerable', 'ambivalence', 'here', 'are', 'uncertain', 'act', 'protect', 'Hanna', 'dignity', 'yet', 'forgive', 'thus', 'removed', 'fate', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'bit', 'revenge', 'acting', 'here', 'Michael', 'information', 'could', 'impact', 'sentence', 'given', 'Hanna', 'yet', 'information.But', 'are', 'unable', 'forgive', 'who', 'do', 'really', 'hurt', 'Michael', 'was', 'once', 'victim', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'sex', 'boy', 'then', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'most', 'love', 'inability', 'forgive', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'own', 'tormentor.Director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'perfect', 'job', 'capturing', 'cool', 'world', 'post', 'WW', 'II', 'Germany', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'David', 'Kross', 'are', 'excellent', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'only', 'disappoint', 'David', 'too', 'coldly', 'too', 'icy', 'too', 'removed', 'emotionless', 'Once', 'again', 'David', 'Hare', 'done', 'exceptional', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'screenplay.The', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'well', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'rich', 'puzzle', 'even', 'have', 'seen', 'end']",N/A

Gruff woman Hanna, Winslet completely convincing as a German woman, comes and helps him and takes him home. Turns out he has scarlet fever, and is laid up in bed for three months. When he's better, he returns to her apartment to thank her. He visits again, and eventually the 16-year-old boy and the woman in her thirties are in a sexual relationship.She provides his sexual education, and soon she asks him to bring things and read them to her. They spend many nice hours with him reading to her before or after sex. Michael grows to love her and is thrilled to have such an exciting secret, but soon he finds that it interferes with him having normal friendships and girlfriends with people his own age, since he is always running off after school to be with Hanna.Eventually the affair abruptly ends. Years pass, and Michael goes to law school. The class goes into the city to watch a war crimes trial as a lesson, and Michael is surprised to see Hanna there--on trial. She joined the SS after their affair, as a nurse, and was in particular partially responsible for the burning deaths of a number of prisoners. Michael is very upset at the entire thing, but can't really confide to his fellow students, and by this time has started to notice that he has trouble forming deep relationships anyway.SPOILERS > > >Okay, serious spoilers, I'm not kidding! This section is better for people who have seen the movie. Michael tells his teacher that he has information that could affect the outcome of the trial... but he eventually declines to give it. Hanna is asked to provide a handwriting sample to prove that she wrote a statement about the atrocity. Rather than submit, she admits to the crime, and thus receives a far worse sentence than the others. The reason for both Michael and Hanna's actions? Hanna can neither read nor write. Therefore Michael could have had her exonerated, or at least significantly reduced her sentence, but he chose not to. She, too, could have exonerated herself, but she chose not to admit that she is unable to read. The film continues and throws out a few more moral complications, but I think this is the crux. &lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS ENDIt strikes me as being about guilt and complicity. Michael has his chance to help Hanna, but now he has seen that his affair perhaps wasn't the best thing for him in the long run, and left him with several emotional issues. So he takes his revenge--by refusing to help her, and helping her in only very small, grudging ways later--and ways that could be considered as making her a sort of prisoner to him or someone deeply in his debt and control. Hanna seems for long periods to have no moral sense--and to harshly dismiss anyone who makes claims to one--but there's an element of her self-punishment that goes beyond superficial shame to a feeling of deeper guilt, almost as though, through whatever formed her, she believes herself to be evil and deserving of punishment.So it all turns into a very literary moral lesson on guilt and levels of complicity. One of those things that chooses a subject and examines it from all sides, providing several different examples and aspects toward creating a detailed whole picture. In this way it's a very literary film, as it's about different aspects and shades of a concept, rather than an accumulation of events that eventually impart a lesson or provide an insight.All the performances are very good. As I said, Winslet is completely convincing as a gruff German woman, and the role requires her to age to about seventy. She also makes a convincing old woman, although my only complaint is that, as an elderly woman, she still moves just as fast as her younger self. David Kross as young Michael conveys the innocent excitement and sense of specialness of being in this unconventional affair, and of course Ralph Fiennes is perfect as always. The direction [by Billy Eliot and The Hours director Stephen Daldry] is effective if undistinguished, using short little shots at times to express a character's troubled mind, without having to create another scene just to show it.Overall, an engaging film with great performances that offers a lot to think about more than anything. An examination of the various aspects and shades of guilt and complicity as it relates to a certain interrelated circles of moral quandary. A thoughtful little movie you won't regret seeing.",4,Complicity,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,4826,"['was', ""n't"", 'really', 'radar', 'started', 'reading', 'good', 'reviews', 'fact', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'one', 'few', 'women', 'would', 'unquestionably', 'go', 'straight', 'conspired', 'send', 'multiplex', 'where', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'billing', 'cooing', 'Marley', 'Me.We', 'have', 'brief', 'snippet', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'fellow', 'Michael', 'adult', 'then', 'back', '1958', 'Germany', 'where', 'suddenly', 'sick', 'street', 'Gruff', 'woman', 'Hanna', 'Winslet', 'completely', 'convincing', 'German', 'woman', 'home', 'out', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'laid', 'up', 'bed', 'three', 'months', 'When', 'better', 'apartment', 'thank', 'again', 'eventually', '16-year-old', 'boy', 'woman', 'thirties', 'are', 'sexual', 'relationship.She', 'sexual', 'education', 'soon', 'bring', 'things', 'read', 'spend', 'many', 'nice', 'hours', 'reading', 'before', 'sex', 'Michael', 'love', 'thrilled', 'have', 'such', 'exciting', 'secret', 'soon', 'having', 'normal', 'friendships', 'girlfriends', 'people', 'own', 'age', 'always', 'running', 'off', 'school', 'be', 'Hanna.Eventually', 'affair', 'abruptly', 'Years', 'pass', 'Michael', 'law', 'school', 'class', 'city', 'watch', 'war', 'trial', 'lesson', 'Michael', 'surprised', 'see', 'Hanna', 'trial', 'joined', 'SS', 'affair', 'nurse', 'was', 'particular', 'partially', 'responsible', 'burning', 'deaths', 'number', 'prisoners', 'Michael', 'very', 'upset', 'entire', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'confide', 'fellow', 'students', 'time', 'started', 'notice', 'trouble', 'forming', 'deep', 'relationships', 'anyway.SPOILERS', '>', '>', '>', 'Okay', 'serious', 'spoilers', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'section', 'better', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Michael', 'teacher', 'information', 'could', 'affect', 'outcome', 'trial', 'eventually', 'give', 'Hanna', 'asked', 'provide', 'handwriting', 'sample', 'prove', 'wrote', 'statement', 'atrocity', 'Rather', 'submit', 'crime', 'thus', 'far', 'worse', 'sentence', 'others', 'reason', 'Michael', 'Hanna', 'actions', 'Hanna', 'can', 'neither', 'read', 'write', 'Therefore', 'Michael', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'exonerated', 'least', 'significantly', 'reduced', 'sentence', 'chose', 'not', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'exonerated', 'chose', 'not', 'admit', 'unable', 'read', 'film', 'out', 'few', 'more', 'moral', 'complications', 'think', 'crux', 'lt', 'lt', 'lt', 'SPOILERS', 'ENDIt', 'strikes', 'being', 'guilt', 'complicity', 'Michael', 'chance', 'help', 'Hanna', 'now', 'seen', 'affair', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'thing', 'long', 'run', 'left', 'several', 'emotional', 'issues', 'revenge', 'refusing', 'help', 'helping', 'only', 'very', 'small', 'grudging', 'ways', 'later', 'ways', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'making', 'sort', 'prisoner', 'someone', 'deeply', 'debt', 'control', 'Hanna', 'long', 'periods', 'have', 'moral', 'sense', 'harshly', 'dismiss', 'anyone', 'who', 'claims', 'one', 'element', 'self-punishment', 'superficial', 'shame', 'feeling', 'deeper', 'guilt', 'almost', 'though', 'formed', 'be', 'evil', 'deserving', 'punishment.So', 'very', 'literary', 'moral', 'lesson', 'guilt', 'levels', 'complicity', 'One', 'things', 'subject', 'examines', 'sides', 'providing', 'several', 'different', 'examples', 'aspects', 'creating', 'detailed', 'whole', 'picture', 'way', 'very', 'literary', 'film', 'different', 'aspects', 'shades', 'concept', 'rather', 'accumulation', 'events', 'eventually', 'impart', 'lesson', 'provide', 'insight.All', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'said', 'Winslet', 'completely', 'convincing', 'gruff', 'German', 'woman', 'role', 'age', 'seventy', 'also', 'convincing', 'old', 'woman', 'only', 'complaint', 'that', 'elderly', 'woman', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'fast', 'younger', 'self', 'David', 'Kross', 'young', 'Michael', 'conveys', 'innocent', 'excitement', 'sense', 'specialness', 'being', 'unconventional', 'affair', 'course', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'perfect', 'always', 'direction', '[', 'Billy', 'Eliot', 'Hours', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', ']', 'effective', 'undistinguished', 'using', 'short', 'little', 'shots', 'times', 'express', 'character', 'troubled', 'mind', 'having', 'create', 'scene', 'just', 'show', 'it.Overall', 'engaging', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'lot', 'think', 'more', 'anything', 'examination', 'various', 'aspects', 'shades', 'guilt', 'complicity', 'certain', 'interrelated', 'circles', 'moral', 'quandary', 'thoughtful', 'little', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'seeing']",N/A
1228728,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B001PPLJIQ,Chris Luallen,"[0, 0]","After an act of kindness, 36 year old Hannah Schmitz (Kate Winslet) begins a passionate but secret filled affair with 15 year old Michael Berg (David Cross). Hannah ends the relationship abruptly and contact is lost until 8 years later when Michael, now a law student, finds Hannah on trial for Nazi war crimes. Michael has information that could help Hannah avoid a longer jail sentence. But decides to not let this secret become known. Many years later an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) begins sending Hannah tapes of him reading great literary works as his reading to her was once an important aspect of their intimate relationship.I much prefer films that have intelligence and complexity to the mind numbing shlock of far too many Hollywood movies. But I found ""The Reader"" subtle to the point that I left the cinema feeling more perplexed than enlightened. Obviously, this film is about the guilt felt by a former Nazi guard. But how does her illiteracy factor into her level of cupability and were Homer's ""The Odyssey"" and Anton Chekov's ""The Lady With The Little Dog"" referenced for specific reasons or just as examples of great literature? It's true that Michael could have saved Hannah time in prison by divulging to the court that she was illiterate and thus unable to have written the report that served as the most damning evidence against her. But beyond that there seemed to be many layers of meaning that the film was trying to get at but did not express clearly enough. Perhaps Bernard Schlink's book, on which it was based, goes into greater detail.In any case, the result is that, why I did feel some sympathy for Hannah and could relate in certain aspects to Michael, I did not become emotionally involved enough with the characters for this to be a monumental cinematic expereince for me. I appreciate the movie's artistic ambitions.

1228729,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001PPLJIQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","If there's one thing ""The Reader"" is above all else, it's a commentary on the power of the written word. This doesn't necessarily mean that the act of reading will change your life; sometimes, books have a very different power, the kind that can link people together in the most extraordinary ways. At other times, it's not about what has been printed, but about what has and hasn't been written by hand, and to say any more would be too revealing on my part. Based on Bernhard Schlink's novel ""Der Vorleser,"" ""The Reader"" is an absorbing examination of an unconventional love between a teenager and a war criminal. It's also a coming-of-age story, which isn't to suggest that it's solely focused on a transition from childhood to adulthood, or more figuratively, from ignorance to knowledge--there's another kind of maturation at work here, one that takes the processes of reading and writing and uses them for redemptive purposes.The main character is Michael Berg, a German whose story shifts back and forth between 1958 and 1995. When he's introduced as a fifteen-year-old (David Kross), he lumbers off a bus into pouring rain, in the initial stages of scarlet fever. As he sits just inside a rundown apartment building, vomiting, a woman named Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) passes by, cleans his mess, and offers to take him home. After three months of bed rest, he returns to Hanna's apartment to thank her. Sexual tension brews almost immediately, although nothing much happens until his second visit, when she in essence orders him to take a bath. There's no question that he's well aware of what's happening to his body, seeing as he's standing naked in front of an older, attractive woman; she seems to sense it too, which is why she brings him a towel without any clothes on.Thus begins a summer-long affair, one that consists not only of lovemaking, but also of Michael reading literature to Hanna. Why she likes him to read aloud is not yet known. Being so infatuated, Michael doesn't question what he's doing. Nor does he notice the subtler nuances of Hanna's existence, the way she lives such a regimented life within the walls of her meager apartment. There always seems to be something she needs to do, whether it's ironing or gathering coal or washing out milk bottles. There's an interesting scene towards the end of their summer fling, in which Hanna washes Michael as he stands in the bathtub; despite the fact that it ends with them making love, there's nothing erotic about the way she scrubs him down. It's a distant moment, as if she were washing a hospital patient instead of her lover.Without warning, the affair ends, leaving Michael with no choice other than returning home. The story then flashes forward to 1966, at which point he's studying law in Berlin. At around the same time, a group of women affiliated with the S.S. during World War II are brought to trial. One of them is Hanna. This represents a narrative shift, but in no way does it affect the overall theme; at this point in the story, Michael has transitioned from an innocent, fresh-faced young man to a chain-smoking, slightly unkempt college student. There's the sense that reality hasn't been treating him well. The same can be said for Hanna, who faces an unsympathetic judge, a group of women who go by the Judas philosophy, and a courtroom full of angry Nazi haters. When the judge interrogates Hanna about an event that resulted in numerous deaths, she seems genuinely baffled, as if to suggest that following orders is more important than following your conscious.Interestingly, Michael finds himself in a very similar situation. He knows something about Hanna, something that, if revealed in court, could affect the verdict. The thing is, she's too ashamed to reveal it herself, leaving Michael in an awkward position: Should he obey the rules of law, or should he respect Hanna's wishes and keep her secret? It's a maddening dilemma, seeing as it's hard to have sympathy for a known associate of the Nazi party. Michael doesn't see her ugly past; he only sees the beautiful but solemn woman who physically and emotionally helped him transition into manhood.During the sections of the story that take place between the 1970s and `90s, we see an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) who can't seem to let anyone get close to him. Given his former relationship with Hanna, it comes as no surprise that his attempt at marriage was unsuccessful. It also comes as no surprise that he's having trouble bonding with his grown daughter. As was the case earlier in his life, Michael must make the choice to change what he has the power to change. If he doesn't, there's a sense that he'll be doomed to a lifetime of regret. The greatness of ""The Reader"" comes from the fact that it's so focused on the act of decision-making, which, given the heavy-handed subtexts, makes it all the more powerful. Some may be critical of the meandering nature of the story, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not all that significant. What audiences should really pay attention to is the emphasis placed on the written word--it's actually quite clever how well the idea is woven throughout the film.",4,"Truth, Consequences, and Handwritten Notes",1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,5176,"['one', 'thing', 'Reader', 'else', 'commentary', 'power', 'written', 'word', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'act', 'reading', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'sometimes', 'books', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'power', 'kind', 'can', 'link', 'people', 'together', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'ways', 'other', 'times', 'not', 'what', 'been', 'printed', 'what', ""n't"", 'been', 'written', 'hand', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'revealing', 'part', 'Based', 'Bernhard', 'Schlink', 'novel', 'Der', 'Vorleser', 'Reader', 'absorbing', 'examination', 'unconventional', 'love', 'teenager', 'war', 'criminal', 'also', 'coming-of-age', 'story', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'solely', 'focused', 'transition', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'more', 'figuratively', 'ignorance', 'knowledge', 'kind', 'maturation', 'work', 'here', 'one', 'processes', 'reading', 'writing', 'redemptive', 'purposes.The', 'main', 'character', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'German', 'story', 'shifts', 'back', 'forth', '1958', '1995', 'When', 'introduced', 'fifteen-year-old', 'David', 'Kross', 'bus', 'pouring', 'rain', 'initial', 'stages', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'just', 'rundown', 'apartment', 'building', 'vomiting', 'woman', 'named', 'Hanna', 'Schmitz', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'passes', 'mess', 'take', 'home', 'three', 'months', 'bed', 'rest', 'Hanna', 'apartment', 'thank', 'Sexual', 'tension', 'almost', 'immediately', 'nothing', 'much', 'second', 'visit', 'when', 'essence', 'orders', 'take', 'bath', 'question', 'well', 'aware', 'what', 'happening', 'body', 'seeing', 'standing', 'naked', 'front', 'older', 'attractive', 'woman', 'sense', 'too', 'why', 'towel', 'clothes', 'on.Thus', 'summer-long', 'affair', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'lovemaking', 'also', 'Michael', 'reading', 'literature', 'Hanna', 'Why', 'read', 'aloud', 'not', 'yet', 'known', 'Being', 'so', 'infatuated', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'question', 'what', 'doing', 'notice', 'subtler', 'nuances', 'Hanna', 'existence', 'way', 'such', 'regimented', 'life', 'walls', 'meager', 'apartment', 'always', 'be', 'something', 'do', 'ironing', 'gathering', 'coal', 'washing', 'out', 'milk', 'bottles', 'interesting', 'scene', 'end', 'summer', 'fling', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'bathtub', 'fact', 'making', 'love', 'nothing', 'erotic', 'way', 'scrubs', 'down', 'distant', 'moment', 'were', 'washing', 'hospital', 'patient', 'instead', 'lover.Without', 'warning', 'affair', 'leaving', 'Michael', 'choice', 'other', 'returning', 'home', 'story', 'then', 'forward', '1966', 'point', 'studying', 'law', 'Berlin', 'same', 'time', 'group', 'women', 'affiliated', 'S.S.', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'are', 'brought', 'trial', 'One', 'Hanna', 'narrative', 'shift', 'way', 'affect', 'overall', 'theme', 'point', 'story', 'Michael', 'transitioned', 'innocent', 'fresh-faced', 'young', 'man', 'chain-smoking', 'slightly', 'unkempt', 'college', 'student', 'sense', 'reality', ""n't"", 'been', 'treating', 'well', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Hanna', 'who', 'unsympathetic', 'judge', 'group', 'women', 'who', 'go', 'Judas', 'philosophy', 'courtroom', 'full', 'angry', 'Nazi', 'haters', 'When', 'judge', 'Hanna', 'event', 'resulted', 'numerous', 'deaths', 'genuinely', 'baffled', 'suggest', 'following', 'orders', 'more', 'important', 'following', 'conscious.Interestingly', 'Michael', 'very', 'similar', 'situation', 'something', 'Hanna', 'something', 'revealed', 'court', 'could', 'affect', 'verdict', 'thing', 'too', 'ashamed', 'reveal', 'leaving', 'Michael', 'awkward', 'position', 'Should', 'obey', 'rules', 'law', 'should', 'respect', 'Hanna', 'wishes', 'keep', 'secret', 'maddening', 'dilemma', 'seeing', 'hard', 'have', 'sympathy', 'known', 'associate', 'Nazi', 'party', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'see', 'ugly', 'past', 'only', 'beautiful', 'solemn', 'woman', 'who', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'helped', 'transition', 'manhood.During', 'sections', 'story', 'take', 'place', '1970s', '90s', 'see', 'adult', 'Michael', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'let', 'anyone', 'get', 'close', 'Given', 'former', 'relationship', 'Hanna', 'surprise', 'attempt', 'marriage', 'was', 'unsuccessful', 'also', 'surprise', 'having', 'trouble', 'bonding', 'grown', 'daughter', 'was', 'case', 'earlier', 'life', 'Michael', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'change', 'what', 'power', 'change', ""n't"", 'sense', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doomed', 'lifetime', 'regret', 'greatness', 'Reader', 'fact', 'so', 'focused', 'act', 'decision-making', 'given', 'heavy-handed', 'subtexts', 'more', 'powerful', 'may', 'be', 'critical', 'meandering', 'nature', 'story', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'not', 'significant', 'What', 'audiences', 'should', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'written', 'word', 'actually', 'quite', 'clever', 'how', 'well', 'idea', 'woven', 'film']",N/A

1228733,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B001PPLJIQ,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that is almost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.The second part is what most people, I assume, will remember about this film. Can ""Hanna Schmitz,"" a Nazi employee (so to speak), who was part of concentration camps, be a sympathetic character? To me, that's what it looked like that's the question the story was asking. The answer may have come in the final minutes of the movie when her ex-lover ""Michael Berg,"" now grown up and played by Ralph Fiennes, confronts a survivor of the camp. That, too, was very intense and interesting scene. Lena Olin is riveting as ""Rose/Illana Mather.""""The Reader"" was full of quiet, but intense scenes. This is a very thought-provoking film, especially for one that doesn't start off that way but look almost like some soft-porn flick to get our attention. It is anything but that.For Germans, this film must bring out many emotions and thoughts. Guilt and forgiveness are just two of the issues that are dealt with in this unique film.

As a young student in post-WW2 West Germany, he slips into an intimate and risky relationship with an older woman, Hanna.  Together they consummate an unusual love and he reads aloud to her.  Suddenly, she is gone and his heart is forever broken.  Years later, as a university law student, he finds her again ... only to have their love, her past, and his future further complicated.  The rest you will have to watch for yourself.The parallels of guilt, culpability, and what we do to others, on a large scale during war and in the most intimate and brief of love affairs, really make this film.  It is this intriguing look at our selfish, stupid pride; our naivet&eacute;; and our inability to answer for our pasts.The ideas of this film are refreshing.  It is a complex look at human nature and human relationships.  Kate Winslet plays the role of Hanna beautifully--you never really know her, you can barely feel for her, and yet you can comprehend how she chooses her life.  David Cross is also superb as young Michael: you can see his transformation from boy to man, from naive to jilted through his subtle portrayal.The Reader is a quiet reflective film (although it is quite abundant in nude scenes) that should be watched for its complexity of theme and characters.

1228735,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B001PPLJIQ,C.Wallace,"[2, 2]","Kate Winslet's performance in The Reader is one of the most powerful that I have seen. It seems to me that this kind of acting is what has driven drama since the seminal plays of ancient Greece. Winslet portrays Hanna Schmitz, a German woman in her mid thirties who engages in a summer-long affair with a sixteen year old youth, Michael Berg (David Kross).It's a torrid affair indeed. A major attraction for Hanna is that Michael reads aloud to her such classic books as Homer's Odyssey. Hanna even initiates a ""read to me first"" policy when Michael so ardently seeks her affections. The lovers part, and the film advances eight years, to 1966. Michael is now a law student. It so happens that he comes to observe the trial of a group of women who were SS concentration camp guards. One of these women is Hanna! To reveal much more would spoil it.I think the films fails on a couple of points. First, amazingly, it does not explain why Hanna is illiterate, a crucial part of the film. Surely, there is a relatively simple explanation for this that Hollywood could invent. Secondly, it only feebly attempts to explain why Hanna participated in the murders of the Holocaust, certainly a far more challenging topic than the literacy issue. She seems to be a ""good person."" Was she just following orders, as she, and so many other Germans claimed in the trials that followed the war? Can a ""good person"" do what she did? The film brings this up and then stumbles away from it.Winslet carries this film. Without her acting it all becomes a mess.

First, there are at least four or five stories here, beginning with fifteen-year-old Michael Berg who has a summer love affair with Hanna Schmitz (Winslet) who is almost forty. Nearly an hour later, and without any warning, The Reader turns into a Holocaust film, with the attendant themes that you might expect. There are also deeply personal, moral, and legal twists that turn the film into a melodrama. What appears to be a minor subplot turns into an undeveloped major theme in the last minutes of the film. Finally, with the film flashing back and forth between Michael's obsession with his past, The Reader is a study of the power of memory to shape the present. The other major flaw is that these separate but related stories require a significant suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. The love affair is not the only twist that begs many complicated questions.

But that's okay, because you really can't get a grip on the Holocaust until you've had a gynecologist's eye view of Kate Winslet's privates.""The Reader"" is pretentious cheese. It isn't honest enough to be straightforward soft-core coming-of-age porn, or to be a hard-hitting, revelatory Holocaust movie. Rather, it's a clunky and silly film that attempts to graft the one onto the other and succeeds at neither. ""The Reader"" brings the viewer in, and then teases him, with a half hour of almost uninterrupted simulated bodily functions, combined with nude bathing. It's all a great big, high school literature class metaphor about the washing off of guilt, dontcha know. Then ""The Reader"" devotes its remaining hours to scenes of well-dressed, attractive young Germans sitting around asking and declaring, ""Who's guilty? Aren't all our parents guilty? I hate my parents."" Overlaying every boring, banal, scene and vapid line of dialogue with ponderous, self-important gas, ""The Reader"" ultimately succeeds at neither serious discussion nor eroticism.From top to bottom, the cast is first rate. David Kross is achingly poignant as teenager Michael Berg, who, in the 1950s, loses his virginity in an affair with Hanna Schmitz, a 36-year-old, former SS concentration camp guard. Kross is both intimately human and vulnerable and also larger than life and every bit the compelling, big screen movie star. In that he reminds the viewer of the young Peter O'Toole. May Kross have a long and bountiful career.In the ""deleted scenes"" reel on the DVD, there are three fine scenes that could have served as centers of three fine movies. In the most gripping, Thomas Thieme is a truck driver who gives Kross a ride on a backwoods road where a large horse is transporting logs. Thieme is repulsive, so terrifying, and also clearly human and in need of understanding. In another deleted scene, in a conversation with his professor (the always brilliant Bruno Ganz) an attractive German boy admits that his father was an SS guard. In a third deleted scene, a prisoner painstakingly learns to read in a prison cell. That these three fabulous scenes were deleted, while endless scenes of nude bathing were kept, informs you of the filmmakers' eye on the box office.In the DVD commentary, the film's director Stephen Daldry, CBE (Commander of the British Empire), script writer David Hare, and novelist Bernhard Schlink smugly pat themselves on the back. Wearing professorial clothing, tweeds and nubbly sweaters, these graying white men express how mah-velous, perfectly mah-velous it is that they've made such a big, fat, profound film that will finally get people to engage in some serious thought about the Holocaust. Significantly, they never mention a single other of the, by now, millions of works of art that got to the topic before they did, nor do they ever address their pimping out Kate Winslet's privates to make their contribution to the body of Holocaust lit stand out.Check out online discussions of ""The Reader."" Most threads are devoted to such deep and heavy topics as clinically detailed examinations of the tautness and firmness, pendulousness or sag of Kate Winslet's privates, the straightness or curvature and length of David Kross', the specific acts that the characters engage in, and what bodily orifices are employed.This review is not a protest against erotica; it's a protest against BS. This review isn't even a protest against the disturbingly burgeoning subgenre of Holocaust porn. In fact there is a brilliant, scathing, unforgettable scene in ""Schindler's List"" where Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) menaces his Jewish slave, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) as she bathes in a cramped basement. That scene is so powerful and unforgettable because it has two things ""The Reader"" completely lacks: psychological insight - the viewer knows exactly who Goeth and Hirsch are and what their relationship is to each other, and, thus, complexity and depth, and stylistic sophistication - Goeth does all the talking. He imagines Helen's replies.Look, there is worthy art out there about the Holocaust. Read Elie Wiesel's ""Night,"" Borowski's ""This Way to the Gas;"" Rufeisen's ""In the Lion's Den,"" see ""Schindler's List,"" ""Europa Europa,"" ""The Gray Zone,"" ""Shoah,"" or ""The Shop on Main Street."" There's also really good soft-core porn out there, much of it free on the internet.

1228741,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B001PPLJIQ,Darren,"[0, 0]","The responses from some of the major critics to this masterwork were pretty ridiculous.  On the one hand, there was a lot of whingeing about the portrayal of &#34;child abuse&#34;, as the film tells the story of a summer affair in 1958 between a woman in her mid-30s and a 15-year-old boy; on the other hand, there was also a lot of deep, deep concern-trolling about whether or not director Stephen Daldry & Co. were &#34;humanizing&#34; a former (and fictional, remember) SS guard at Auschwitz, who just happens to be that same mid-30s lady who ravishes the kid more than a decade later.  Ron Rosenbaum trashed the filmmakers for, in his opinion, comparing mass murder favorably to the scourge of illiteracy.  If we may set aside for just a moment that this movie is based on a novel, meaning that the particulars of the Holocaust as described here are therefore fictional, I still can't imagine a more shallow interpretation of the events of the film.  But then, that's why guys like Rosenbaum are paid the big bucks, I guess.  Easy answers to difficult questions make great copy and lucrative careers.I think we can pretty quickly set aside the spurious charges about &#34;child abuse&#34;; that's an attention-seeking criticism that isn't worthy of a rebuttal.  But the question of whether or not &#34;The Reader&#34; humanizes SS guards demands deeper exploration.  If the movie has a fault, it's that it isn't about &#34;German guilt&#34; enough.  Throughout, I was struck by Winslet's similarities to other monsters we've seen in novels and films, Nazi or not: Stephen King's &#34;retired&#34; Nazi living in California in the novella &#34;Apt Pupil&#34;; Sean Penn's killer in &#34;Dead Man Walking&#34;; both Judi Dench's and Cate Blanchett's essentially vampiric characters in the brilliant &#34;Notes on a Scandal&#34; (Blanchett even has an affair with a high school boy in that movie).  These are all monsters who end up having to face the consequences of their crimes.  What this movie perhaps fails to do is fully commit to the idea of German society facing up its collective crimes, even as that society observes Winslet having to face up to hers 20 years after the fact.  Unless Ralph Fiennes (the lucky 15-year-old all grown up) is supposed to symbolically represent Germany itself in the post-war, indeed post-Berlin Wall, years -- outwardly successful, inwardly crippled beyond relief -- the story keeps things so personal that the wider sociological context is missed, despite the trial scenes and a chilling stroll through a deserted, pre-tourist-attraction death camp.  The screenplay hurriedly tries to explore the wider context by having a young law student who is witnessing Winslet's trial complain to professor Bruno Ganz that one particular trial of a small group of women guards is meaningless; he asks Ganz why his generation just didn't all commit suicide after the war, since they so clearly knew what was going on.  How could they live with themselves, let alone pass judgment on those monsters who participated actively, rather than just passively, in the genocide (implying here that Ganz was one of those passive observers).  But the scene ends with that question hanging in the air.  Perhaps because there's not a good answer.Even if one considers the lack of pressing the question about collective responsibility to be a failure, I still think it's churlish to rate this movie less than 5 stars.  Because even on the more intimate stage that it's working on, it's a fascinating story and character study, and the questions are just as interesting (and just as unanswered).  Holocaust survivors, quite understandably, are not terribly interested in the extent to which some or even all Nazis had any humanity within them.  For them, justice must and should be served until the last Nazi is dead in the ground.  But even so, Nazis were still human beings.  Monsters they might have been, but they were also human beings nevertheless.  Hitler liked his dogs and his mistress and was affectionate to young children, just as Kate Winslet's &#34;Hanna&#34; cared for and tried to spare the more sickly inmates under her watch and, long after the war, took pity on a sickly teenage boy.  She was also unwilling to attempt to stop people from getting burned to death, and selfishly took advantage of that boy in every sexual and emotional way possible.  What can you say about such people?  About the contradictions of humanity itself?  Answer: nothing certain.  But even people like Winslet often have someone to care for them after they are finally brought to justice.  Fiennes reminds us of those parents of mass murderers, sadly and guiltily attending to those who have no one else.  And just as violence engenders its perpetrators from the very field it plunders, so catastrophic and genocidal wars reverberate down into the innocent lives of those who come into the world after such horrible events have already happened.  For the Jewish survivors of the camps and their descendants, and for the Germans who have had to live with what their people have done to the world, the Second World War did not end in 1945.  It may never end.5 out of 5.  Thought-provoking, beautifully performed and filmed.

1228743,A1CK4J7YRAUQ53,B001PPLJIQ,"David Foughty ""DLF""","[0, 1]","Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience. Somehow, he let go of his control and made ""Billy Elliot"" exuberant and glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the tragedy in ""The Hours""; somehow the balance continues in ""The Reader"", a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their interactions. In ""The Reader"" learning occurs, consequences, origins, and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices are carry a bigger weight than others.The marvelous Kate Winslett, who should be honoured for the quality of her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film, get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslett is able to show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters.Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslett does not say much, but her manipulations provoke her desired effects.As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again, and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives.In the final act of the film is when Winslett and Feines do some of their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful turns in ""Revolutionary Road"", and ""Eternal Sunshine"". Every gesture, every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and bewitching, the work very few people are able to do.""The Reader"" reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes that might break whatever little strength we might still have left.

Many of us are confronted with conflicting situations that call for us to choose between the expedient and the difficult. The war in Vietnam comes to mind. People had to choose to serve or not in the face of extreme moral ambiguity and all the arrayed forces of government and society. In this film Hana and her lover made choices that haunted and injured themselves and others! Kate Winslet certainly deserved the Oscar for her performance. Ralph Fiennes chose another difficult role and he delivered a deep, subtle characterization. The young German actor, David Kross, gave a bravura performance. The rest of the cast was superb!

Set in post-World War II Germany, teenager Michael Berg (David Kross) begins a relationship with a much older woman (Kate Winslet) who shows blunt kindness to him when he falls ill on the way home from school.  When he returns to thank her, Hanna draws him into his first sexual relationship, where the passion of words, read to Hanna by Michael, becomes foreplay to the passion of the flesh.  The strange and secret relationship ends suddenly, breaking Michael's heart.  Years later, when Michael is a law student, he attends a Nazi war crime trials where he sees Hanna once again and learns of her horrifying past.  (Ralph Fiennes plays a much older Michael decades after the trial.)Hanna's seduction of Michael comes across as predatory, since everything is on her terms and at her instigation; of course, the age difference, plus Winslet's affectless expression, contributes to this, especially as we later learn that she used to force Jewish prisoners to read to her before they were executed.  One sex scene would have been fine, with hints of other intimacies, but director Daldry and screenwriter Hare seem to use them as filler.Winslet's Hanna is hardly likeable, not even in the midst of her relationship with Michael, thus ruining making sure that the viewer never sympathizes with a Nazi war criminal, not even when she has presumably built another life and, through the knowledge gained by Michael, is not as quite as guilty as she seems.  Winslet does a remarkable job of conveying thought and repressed emotion through her largely affectless expressions.  And Kross creates a believable teenage/young adult Michael.  Fiennes, given less to work with, is less memorable.This bleak story of love, illicit acts, and the failure to do the right thing falls flat because too much is repressed.  Nothing new is revealed.

Get it at Amazon.]BEWARE OF SPOILERS.There is a certain segment of the German mentality that is Hanna Schmidt.  English Kate Winslet captures the intent of novelist Bernhard Schlink in her interpretation of the character.  Hanna was an ordinary but proud woman of discipline who always did her duty, a woman without the ability to separate herself from what she knew was right and what was wrong, but a woman who was able to hide from herself what she did that was wrong.She seduces fifteen-year-old Michael Berg.  She finds him doubly useful as a reader of great literature. She knows it will not work.  Of course how could it?  She indulges herself but, being strong and proud, is able to divorce herself from him emotionally when the time comes, as it must.  When he reads D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover to her, she is genuinely offended at the open sexuality, but we viewers are taken back since what she is doing with 15-year-old Michael Berg is on the screen and naked before our eyes.In a sense this is the somewhat familiar story of the young man of station and potential had briefly in his youth by the older woman who has neither station nor potential.  They take advantage of one another for the time being, both knowing that they will move on.  But young Michael is not fully aware of this old story because his station in life is, although above hers, still rather modest, and being fifteen and knowing a woman for the first time, he is in love as much as--or even more than--a fifteen-year-old can be.She is short with him and selfish because she knows she will be tossed aside and so instinctively knows she needs to get something now.  She calls him ""kid"" and consumes him, as would be the case in such a relationship.  Yet there is his ""reading.""  He has a talent for it and he enjoys reading to her.  At one point she instructs him, reading first and then making love.What is love?  Hanna Schmidt does not know.  And so her character is triply flawed.  She has low self-esteem, hiding her illiteracy from all.  She is removed from her feelings because of the past.  That is how she has coped.  What she has done she knows on one level was something horrendous; but on another level she only took the job at Siemens.  What else was she to do?  She was a guard.  She had to guard the prisoners, otherwise there would be chaos.  This is her defense. This is her belief.  And finally, she cares for young Michael as she cares for herself, as one might care for valuable livestock, but she neither loves him nor herself.  For again ""What is love,"" as Tina Turner once had it, ""but a second-hand emotion""?At the end we see her, an old woman in prison being visited by the adult Michael Berg.  She has put out her hand to him, and he, being human, has touched it.  But he has withdrawn his hand.  And now they stand and she leans, ever so slightly toward him to be hugged perhaps, to be touched for perhaps the first time in decades.  But he does not respond.  He cannot.This echoes back to an earlier scene when he, as a young law student suddenly finds himself observing her trial.  He realizes that she is taking the blame for the deaths of the Jewish ""prisoners"" because she would rather do that then reveal that she cannot read or write.  It is interesting that young Berg realizes the truth of why she liked to be read to only then.  And so he thinks to save her by letting the court know that she could not have written the order that condemned the prisoners to death.  And so he makes an appointment to go to the prison and see her.  But as she waits for her unknown visitor to arrive, he suddenly turns away.  What he realizes, one speculates, is that there is nothing he can say to her or to the court that will change anything.  Whether she wrote the actual order or not really doesn't matter.  The others get off with lighter sentences, but all of them are equally guilty of whatever it was that was that allowed the German psyche to allow the holocaust.  And too Berg is not clear about how he feels.  Here is a woman he once loved who now is revealed as a monster.  Yes, she is a monster, but strange to say almost an innocent monster.It is curious that Berg so deeply loved her that he acquires her trait of emotional distance.  He learns he can only sleep alone.  His marriage fails.  He is not as close to his daughter as he would like.  And finally he is not able to help Hanna when she is alone in prison.  He cannot bring himself to respond to her letters.  And yet he reads to her.  Hour after hour after hour he reads the classics into a microphone and sends the tapes to her to listen to in prison.I wonder how this was received in Germany.  There is such a guilt that hangs over the generations after the war.  I wonder what they think of the humanization of a certain familiar mentality.  And I must add that this mentality that follows orders and does its duty to the exclusive of its humanity is not something special with the Germans of that era.  It is a human trait that is expressive of a human type that can be found in any society.This is a deeply moving film, exquisitely written and directed and wondrously acted by especially the great Kate Winslet, and Ralph Fiennes who plays the older Michael Berg, and David Kross who plays the younger Michael Berg.

Having seen THE READER (several times, along with all the extras in this DVD), I remain officially dumbstruck.  A flood of emotions sweep over me when I think about, or discuss, this moving portrayal of guilt, shame, turmoil, anguish, remorse, tormented love--and reclamation--set in post-WW II Germany and based on Bernhard Schlink's internationally acclaimednovel.  The story reflects Germany's relentless guilt, pain, and denial, as the succeeding generations come to grips with the horrors of its Nazi past.  Or, better yet, doesn't come to grips.And how is this struggle allegorically portrayed?  An affair, a summer fling in 1958, between 36-year-old Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and 15-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross as the youth, Ralph Fiennes as the man).  The affair is doomed from the start, yet for one fleeting summer Hanna and Michael are the fulcrums of one another's lives--especially when Michael, either before or after their lovemaking, reads to Hanna.  And he reads everything:  literature, plays, poetry; and Hanna is so very moved.  Why?The affair ends abruptly, and Michael moves on with his life.  As a law student he signs up for a seminar studying a war trial now taking place--and Hanna is one of the defendants.  Beforehand, Michael was firmly in agreement with his law school peers in their condemnation of the generation that was either duplicitous, or looked the other way, as Nazi atrocities were committed.  Now, he's torn, because before his eyes is the woman he once loved--a proud, stubborn woman willing to pay any price to hide her shame--and Michael, at the cost of haunting regret, does not reveal information that would aid Hanna.  Subsequently, Michael is distant, aloof, tentative, unemotional, with all his relationships--even his relationship with his daughter.  As Hanna ages in prison, Michael reaches out to her in the only distant way he knows how:  He reads books on a cassette recorder and ships the tapes to her.  The story moves on to its tragic conclusion--yet we are given a glimpse that maybe, perhaps, Michael is moving towards his own reclamation.Kudos to director Stephen Daldry for bringing such a complex, tragic, and cerebral story to the screen.  The cast is superb, especially Kate Winslet; this, by far, is her best role.  Extra features include interviews with the cast and crew, along with a very humorous vignette depicting Winslet's ordeal each day sitting in a makeup chair being aged more than 30 years (Winslet's wry humor definitely shows this lady has her feet firmly on the ground).  THE READER will have you talking and thinking about its haunting story a long time; a must-have for all collectors of quality cinema.--D.

1228758,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B001PPLJIQ,Dogville,"[0, 0]","It almost seems like Kate Winslet has a penchant for appearing nude having done so in Titanic and Little Children. The first hour or so of The Reader might seem like soft-porn but seeing the raw passion between a 30-something Hanna Schmitz and her young teenage lover, Michael Berg (David Cross) is anything but a riveted and emotional ride.The Nazi backdrop is not so much a necessity but more of a setting. Much of the early part of the show has to do with the torrid affair, how Hanna loves being read to and then when Berg as a young law student meet Hanna after her unexplained disappearance, only to find her stand trial for her holocaust crimes.That is where the story gets more interesting as Hanna is actually an illiterate who's too ashamed to admit to her inadequacies. The adult Michael played by Ralph Fiennes shows great remorse and love for the by then elderly Hanna. What follows is a touching tale of transcendental love and heartache. Fiennes' hardhearted portrayal of the tormented adult Berg is both bittersweet and intense.

1228767,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001PPLJIQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 6]","If you mixed Robert Mulligan'sSummer of '42with Stanley Kramer'sJudgment at Nuremberg, you could likely come up with a melodramatic hybrid as lugubrious as this 2008 drama about post-WWII moral ambiguity and obsession. Adapted by playwright David Hare (Plenty) from Bernhard Schlink's critically acclaimed 1995 novel, the film directed by Stephen Daldry (The Hours) offers the veneer of an important subject in reflecting upon the years-later psychological aftermath of the Holocaust.  The source book deals with the difficulties which subsequent generations have in comprehending the scope and magnitude of the war crimes However, the screenplay focuses more squarely on the passionate affair that develops between Hanna Schmitz, an enigmatic, controlling woman in her mid-thirties, and Michael Berg, an impressionable fifteen-year-old student in 1958 Berlin.The film begins well enough when the focus is primarily on these two characters with Hanna calling upon Michael to read to her during their discreet afternoon meetings. The affair ends abruptly, and he doesn't see her again until six years later when she goes on trial with several other women for contributing to the murder of 300 Jews while she was serving as an SS guard at Auschwitz. The plot turns on a key revelation that is quite obvious from the early scenes, yet it is at this point when the film loses momentum considerably. Daldry's excessive jumbling of the timeline does not help either in overcoming the increasingly convoluted storyline which has the older Michael conveying a deep sense of conflict over Hanna when she is found guilty and serves a life sentence.Making good cinema out of such introspection poses a challenge. We are meant to empathize with a man who is torn between protecting the subject of his youthful ardor and withdrawing from the horror of the crime for which she accepts accountability. When the plot threads wrap together with the characters' fates sealed, there is a pervasive sense of emptiness since Daldry and Hare cannot move us emotionally beyond the elliptical nature of Hanna and Michael's relationship. This leaves the principal actors to fill in the gaping holes. In response, Kate Winslet gives a strong, nuanced performance as Hanna, foregoing much of her glamour to track the oblique character over three decades of stoic concealment. German actor David Kross is genuinely affecting as Michael, and he brings the necessary vulnerability and eagerness to make more palatable the controversial sex scenes with Winslet. Ralph Fiennes has the diabolically difficult role of the older, haunted Michael, who must come to terms with his unresolved feelings toward Hanna. He is given precious little latitude to flesh out an obviously pained character.Give credit to Daldry and Hare, however, for attempting to tread a fine morality line in presenting a character whose sense of duty to the Nazis did not end up defining her life. At the same time, they fall short in dramatically connecting her lack of rehabilitation with the broader question of responsibility and culpability for the Holocaust. There are plenty of extras on the 2009 DVD beginning with five separate featurettes. The first is the standard ""making of"" puff piece with the cast and crew discussing the characters and the production, while another is a ten-minute interview with Kross and Daldry about the young actor's casting. Winslet is spotlighted primarily for the make-up and prosthetics she had to don as the aging Hanna. Two shorts focus on Nico Muhly's haunting soundtrack and Brigitte Broch's meticulous production design. The theatrical trailer is also included, although the best extra is a run of deleted scenes, 42 minutes in total, which provide added context for some of the more elliptical turns of the story.",3,Haunting Post-Holocaust Drama Falls Short Despite Solid Work from Winslet and Kross,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,3799,"['mixed', 'Robert', ""Mulligan'sSummer"", ""'42with"", 'Stanley', ""Kramer'sJudgment"", 'Nuremberg', 'could', 'likely', 'come', 'up', 'melodramatic', 'hybrid', 'as', 'lugubrious', '2008', 'drama', 'post-WWII', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'obsession', 'Adapted', 'playwright', 'David', 'Hare', 'Plenty', 'Bernhard', 'Schlink', 'critically', 'acclaimed', '1995', 'novel', 'film', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'Hours', 'veneer', 'important', 'subject', 'reflecting', 'years-later', 'psychological', 'aftermath', 'Holocaust', 'source', 'book', 'deals', 'difficulties', 'subsequent', 'generations', 'have', 'comprehending', 'scope', 'magnitude', 'war', 'crimes', 'However', 'screenplay', 'more', 'squarely', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Hanna', 'Schmitz', 'enigmatic', 'controlling', 'woman', 'mid-thirties', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'impressionable', 'fifteen-year-old', 'student', '1958', 'Berlin.The', 'film', 'well', 'enough', 'when', 'focus', 'primarily', 'two', 'characters', 'Hanna', 'calling', 'Michael', 'read', 'discreet', 'afternoon', 'meetings', 'affair', 'abruptly', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'six', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'trial', 'several', 'other', 'women', 'contributing', 'murder', '300', 'Jews', 'was', 'serving', 'SS', 'guard', 'Auschwitz', 'plot', 'key', 'revelation', 'quite', 'obvious', 'early', 'scenes', 'point', 'when', 'film', 'momentum', 'considerably', 'Daldry', 'excessive', 'jumbling', 'timeline', 'not', 'help', 'either', 'overcoming', 'increasingly', 'convoluted', 'storyline', 'older', 'Michael', 'conveying', 'deep', 'sense', 'conflict', 'Hanna', 'when', 'found', 'guilty', 'life', 'sentence.Making', 'good', 'cinema', 'such', 'introspection', 'challenge', 'are', 'meant', 'empathize', 'man', 'who', 'torn', 'protecting', 'subject', 'youthful', 'ardor', 'withdrawing', 'horror', 'crime', 'accountability', 'When', 'plot', 'threads', 'wrap', 'together', 'characters', 'fates', 'sealed', 'pervasive', 'sense', 'emptiness', 'Daldry', 'Hare', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'emotionally', 'elliptical', 'nature', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'relationship', 'principal', 'actors', 'fill', 'gaping', 'holes', 'response', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'strong', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Hanna', 'foregoing', 'much', 'glamour', 'track', 'oblique', 'character', 'three', 'decades', 'stoic', 'concealment', 'German', 'actor', 'David', 'Kross', 'genuinely', 'affecting', 'Michael', 'necessary', 'vulnerability', 'eagerness', 'make', 'more', 'palatable', 'controversial', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Winslet', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'diabolically', 'difficult', 'role', 'older', 'haunted', 'Michael', 'who', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'unresolved', 'feelings', 'Hanna', 'given', 'precious', 'little', 'latitude', 'flesh', 'out', 'obviously', 'pained', 'character.Give', 'credit', 'Daldry', 'Hare', 'however', 'attempting', 'tread', 'fine', 'morality', 'line', 'presenting', 'character', 'sense', 'duty', 'Nazis', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'defining', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'fall', 'short', 'dramatically', 'connecting', 'lack', 'rehabilitation', 'broader', 'question', 'responsibility', 'culpability', 'Holocaust', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', '2009', 'DVD', 'beginning', 'five', 'separate', 'featurettes', 'first', 'standard', 'making', 'puff', 'piece', 'cast', 'crew', 'discussing', 'characters', 'production', 'ten-minute', 'interview', 'Kross', 'Daldry', 'young', 'actor', 'casting', 'Winslet', 'spotlighted', 'primarily', 'make-up', 'prosthetics', 'had', 'don', 'aging', 'Hanna', 'Two', 'shorts', 'focus', 'Nico', 'Muhly', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'Brigitte', 'Broch', 'meticulous', 'production', 'design', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'also', 'included', 'best', 'extra', 'run', 'deleted', 'scenes', '42', 'minutes', 'total', 'provide', 'added', 'context', 'more', 'elliptical', 'turns', 'story']",N/A

1228774,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B001PPLJIQ,e. verrillo,"[1, 3]","The Reader is an impressive film. The acting was superb, the filming exquisite, and the subject matter treated in a profoundly thoughtful and honest fashion. The main fault of the film lay in its editing, which regrettably left out some of the most important explanatory scenes. (Be sure to watch the deleted scenes if you found the film choppy.) Equally as regrettable was the insertion of a secondary (and completely irrelevant) plot line revolving around Michael Berg's daughter, which only served to add confusion to a movie that was already somewhat at odds with itself. (In contrast to the book, which was crystal clear.)The plot is fairly straightforward. A young man, Michael, falls ill in an alley. An older woman, Hanna, encounters him, and after cleaning him up and giving him a mysteriously compassionate hug, she accompanies him to his home. After Michael recovers from his illness, he returns to thank Hanna. A rather lopsided love affair ensues--Michael enthusiastically in love, and Hanna somewhat erratic in her behavior. One day, Hanna disappears, breaking Michael's heart. Years later, when Michael is a law student, he once again encounters Hanna, now as the defendant in a war crimes trial. As Michael listens in horror to the testimony concerning Hanna's participation in the Holocaust, it dawns on him that he alone has a piece of information that may reduce her sentence. Michael's agonized pangs of conscience over whether to come forward and help Hanna, or allow her to pay for the sins of the many form the crux of this tale. This is the post-war German dilemma in a nutshell. Do they all share the blame?What was striking about this film was the thorough depiction of the effects that guilt has had on post-war German society--all kinds of guilt. There is the guilt of the parents who ""all knew"", the guilt of the survivors, the guilt of the perpetrators, the guilt of children who cannot love their parents for what they did or did not do. This is the profoundest guilt of all--the one that has torn the post-war generation of Germans from their wartime parents. As one angry law student put it, ""They should have put a gun to their heads!"" Indeed if they had, if most Germans had refused to participate in wholesale atrocities, whether actively or passively, then the retroactive guilt of the next generation would certainly have been lessened. But wartime Germans cooperated with the Nazis. Why? Because they were told to do their jobs.If anyone reading this review thinks that ""I was just doing my job"" is a trite excuse, I would ask you to go to Wikipedia and look up the ""Milgram experiment."" Shortly after the Eichmann trials, a Yale social psychology professor by the name of Milgram conducted a series of experiments in which ordinary people were asked by an authority figure (someone in a lab coat) to administer a series of electrical shocks to a ""student."" When the shocks were administered, the ""student"" (an actor) screamed horribly and begged them to stop. The authority figure calmly told the subjects to continue administering electric shocks. The majority of participants, ordinary Americans, continued administering shocks until the ""student"" was ""dead"" (three lethal doses).Originally, Milgram designed this experiment to try to uncover the basis for the Germans' cooperation with something they knew to be morally wrong. The answer to his question was that ordinary people everywhere (the experiment has been conducted in many locations over a span of 40 years) will obey authority even in the most morally questionable circumstances. Most important of all, their obedience is enhanced by the presence of other people who are following suit. In short, when an entire nation obeys, it becomes nearly impossible for people--of any nationality or social station--to resist authority.

Michael, a teenager boy who is sick, is taken in by the older Hanna and he begins to read to her as a part of their liaisons. Being young and nave, Michael is later crushed by Hanna's cold, aloof manner and ultimately her rejection of him.Fast forward years later, and as a law student, Michael is shocked to see Hanna on trial for the war crime of murder. Women on duty are accused of letting 300 Jewish women perish in a fire. As the trial progresses, there is a critical moment when Hanna, a former SS soldier, has an opportunity to save face, but rather than do this, she admits writing a report to cover up a secret she's been hiding all along--her illiteracy. The past comes to light in Michael's point of view--she had wanted him to read to her during every sexual encounter. He has a dilemma to deal with, being that he has crucial information about the defendant. He seeks advice from his law teacher by indirectly saying he has information about the woman on trial, but ultimately he has to choose what to do on his own. Eventually he begins recording books to send to her after she is sentenced to life. Feeling distant in life, he makes arrangements to try to reconcile his own life and family, and also the past.As some have indicated, character motives in this film are a bit perplexing. Michael is quite distant to his own family, but this is never truly explained. One may assume that the past experience as a young man with Hanna scarred Michael, but would it have this deep of an impact on his family life years later? Also, it seemed strange that Michael would act cold to Hanna after going to so much trouble to ease her prison life. Admittedly, I haven't read the novel that this film is based on. Perhaps those are addressed in the book. Many aspects just don't seem to add up, and we are left feeling aloof ourselves.Also, the film is a bit uneven . There is too much time spent in the first thirty minutes with Hanna and Michael sexual encounters and not enough time on Michael's revelations later on in life. At times, the film seems to move too slowly, but then doesn't spend enough time on critical moments, such as the film's resolution. The slow scenes seem to reduce the power and intensity of critical moments, and this makes for a less effective film.Over all, this is a passable film, but nothing exceptional.",3,"Maybe a little overhyped, and a bit uneven",1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,2606,"['Reader', 'several', 'issues', 'war', 'crimes', 'revisiting', 'past', 'consequences', 'past', 'decisions', 'healing', 'old', 'wounds', 'protecting', 'secrets', 'costs.For', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Michael', 'teenager', 'boy', 'who', 'sick', 'taken', 'older', 'Hanna', 'read', 'part', 'liaisons', 'Being', 'young', 'nave', 'Michael', 'later', 'crushed', 'Hanna', 'cold', 'aloof', 'manner', 'ultimately', 'rejection', 'him.Fast', 'forward', 'years', 'later', 'law', 'student', 'Michael', 'shocked', 'see', 'Hanna', 'trial', 'war', 'crime', 'murder', 'Women', 'duty', 'are', 'accused', 'letting', '300', 'Jewish', 'women', 'perish', 'fire', 'trial', 'critical', 'moment', 'when', 'Hanna', 'former', 'SS', 'soldier', 'opportunity', 'save', 'face', 'rather', 'do', 'writing', 'report', 'cover', 'up', 'secret', 'been', 'hiding', 'all', 'along', 'illiteracy', 'past', 'light', 'Michael', 'point', 'view', 'had', 'wanted', 'read', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'dilemma', 'deal', 'being', 'crucial', 'information', 'defendant', 'advice', 'law', 'teacher', 'indirectly', 'saying', 'information', 'woman', 'trial', 'ultimately', 'choose', 'what', 'do', 'own', 'Eventually', 'recording', 'books', 'send', 'sentenced', 'life', 'Feeling', 'distant', 'life', 'arrangements', 'try', 'reconcile', 'own', 'life', 'family', 'also', 'past.As', 'have', 'indicated', 'character', 'motives', 'film', 'are', 'bit', 'perplexing', 'Michael', 'quite', 'distant', 'own', 'family', 'never', 'truly', 'explained', 'One', 'may', 'assume', 'past', 'experience', 'young', 'man', 'Hanna', 'scarred', 'Michael', 'would', 'have', 'deep', 'impact', 'family', 'life', 'years', 'later', 'Also', 'seemed', 'strange', 'Michael', 'would', 'act', 'cold', 'Hanna', 'going', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'ease', 'prison', 'life', 'Admittedly', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'addressed', 'book', 'Many', 'aspects', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'add', 'up', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'aloof', 'ourselves.Also', 'film', 'bit', 'uneven', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'Michael', 'revelations', 'later', 'life', 'times', 'film', 'move', 'too', 'slowly', 'then', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'critical', 'moments', 'such', 'film', 'resolution', 'slow', 'scenes', 'seem', 'reduce', 'power', 'intensity', 'critical', 'moments', 'less', 'effective', 'film.Over', 'passable', 'film', 'nothing', 'exceptional']",N/A

And Kross and Fiennes are competent as Michael Berg, Schmitz's young lover. The characterization in this film is brilliant. You really get to know and feel for these 2 people and even the jump in age for both characters is seamless. There's a bit of everything in this film. The unconventionality of Schmitz and Berg's relationship, how Berg grows and matures into a man from his interactions with her and the abrupt change in the relationships dynamics a few decades later. The film also explores the theme of morality as Berg struggles with his contempt over her crime and his love for her and also through Schmitz's characterization as her final actions symbolize what Berg taught her.What I like most about this film is that the ending is a proper one which gives the audience such a great sense of closure and contentment.

And for once the book to film version holds nearly as much agony and beauty as the original. The screenplay is by David Hare (whose transformation of 'The Hours' was so worthy) and it captures not only the dialogue of Schlink's novel but fills in the silences with well-constructed added commentary. Stephen Daldry ('The Hours', 'Billy Elliot') directs with great sensitivity to not only the narrative story but to the myriad metaphors that fill the quiet spaces in both the novel and the film.Michael Berg (David Kross, a significant discovery!) lives in Berlin, falls ill with Scarlet Fever, and is given shelter from the rain and cold by a stern appearing Hanna (Kate Winslet). When Michael recovers from his illness he returns to Hanna's flat to thank her for her kindness and there begins a strange and beautiful love affair between a virginal shy lad and an older but obviously emotionally flat yet needy woman. Despite Michael's family's disdain for his absences away from home, Michael surrenders himself to the passion of love and Hanna softens as she pleads for Michael to read to her. Reading and sex become exchanges for this rare couple until Hanna disappears. Michael discovers her some ears later when Hanna is on trial for war crimes (she had been a guard in the concentration camps). Hanna allows her guilt to override reality in confessing she had been the one who had written the orders for the extermination of Jews - this despite the fact that Hanna is illiterate, a fact known only to Michael.While Hanna is imprisoned Michael (now Ralph Fiennes) records his reading of books to send to Hanna and during Hanna's twenty years of confinement she learns to read and write because of Michael's efforts and gifts. Once Hanna is scheduled to be released from prison and the prison matron convinces Michael to be in charge of the aging Hanna, the story takes turns and the ending is so gently painful that sharing it would ruin the impact for those who have neither read the book nor seen the film.Winslet, Kross, and Fiennes are excellent in these very difficult roles. Their performances are enhanced with the supporting cast that includes special cameos by Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz and some other fine German actors. The mood of the film is gray except of the isolated moments of bliss Michael and Hanna share and the atmosphere is well balanced by the musical score of Nico Muhly. This is a film worth viewing repeatedly, there are that many layers of meaning to glean from this cinematic triumph.

If you're looking for a Holocaust picture, this really is not it, but it's mentioned. If you're looking for a period film, NOT THIS, it covers every decade from the 50's to the 90's. It's a movie hard to categorize other than ""astonishing depth"" for looking deeply into the psychological make-up of several leading characters. The activity of ""the reader"" at different segments of Hanna's life helps makes this story so intriguing.It begins with a teenage Michael Berg (David Kross) becoming ill in the alley and an mid-30's, Hanna, helps him home.  This chance meeting sparks an affair. Hanna (Kate Winslet, ""Titanic"") shares her body in trade for Michael reading to her. The affair ends suddenly, but not in the heart and mind of Michael.The movie travels 5 decades. An early 90's decade scene has older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) planning to meet with his daughter. Michael is obviously troubled, struggling within himself, but why? The movie tell WHY! It tells of multiple relationships with ""The Reader.""Kate Winslet's performance is the driving force and success to this thought stimulating story. It's why she won the Oscar and many other awards for her role in ""The Reader."" She stated in the bonus material, ""It (this film) doesn't answer any questions."" Another great summary line from the screenplay writer (David Hare), ""How do you live in the shadow of one of the greatest crimes in human history?"" ""The Reader"" asks questions, but lets the viewer think of possible answers, or why?After watching during an evening, my night was filled with pondering, dreaming, and my own inward struggle dealing with the issues of the film's main characters. This movie does that to you.  Not exactly entertaining, but surely and hugely thought provoking. Call it a masterpiece.There are many Special Features on the DVD including ""Deleted Scenes"" (a great many, & very worthwhile). ""Kate Winslet On The Art Of Aging Hanna Schmitz"" also indicates the Winslet nudity is not all real. This bonus segment is important to see just how Kate was able to so successfully portray a 36 year-old, and then age each decade, until her final scene where Hanna's age is her late 60s.

Hanna (Kate Winslet) was a member of the older generation, while Michael (David Kross/Ralph Fiennes) was from the generation of German children who were born towards the end of the war. While Michael was raised to abhor the atrocities of the Holocaust, and blame their elders for not stopping it in time, Hanna and other non-Jewish Germans did not realize they were doing something wrong. The characters of the movie are really great in showing that we truly are just a product of our environment.The movie is good otherwise as well. The acting is well done, and I especially like seeing the character Michael mature. I also loved Hanna's quote during her trial, referring to her position as a Nazi guard: ""What would you have done?"" It's not to say that I dismiss what the Nazi guards did--clearly, they made bad decisions that contributed to one of the worst tragedies in history--but it just makes you realize that people may do certain bad actions because of their circumstances.I know a lot of people criticized this movie because of the illicit affair between a teenage boy and a woman in her 30s. While I don't approve of people who do that in real life, you have to realize that it's just a movie.

Alvi,"[4, 5]","I found this movie to be fairly gripping, partly because the time and place are somewhat unfamiliar (post-war Germany), and partly because the atypical plot has unanticipated twists and turns right up to the end.  Moreover, the scenery and acting are excellent, with Kate Winslet in particular doing a great job (as usual).The plot mainly revolves around a love story, but it's a love which starts out unbalanced and not entirely promising, undergoes a painfully abrupt separation, and then struggles without real success to regain a meaningful foothold.  And just when we think the love might finally reestablish itself in a less intense but more mature form, thereby giving some sense of closure, our hopes are instead permanently dashed.So, while the movie is certainly powerful and moving, sadness was the feeling it most lastingly elicited in me.  I felt pity for the character of Hanna Schmitz (played by Kate Winslet) because she paid dearly for her overblown shame, unexplained insensitivity, and excessive navet&eacute;, factors which unwittingly made her both a victimizer and victim.  And I also felt pity for the character of Michael Berg (played by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes), who started life with so much promise but never managed to recover from his broken heart, to the detriment of other relationships which he could and should have nurtured.In the end, although this movie was made well and has strong entertainment value (of a serious sort), I didn't really learn any life lessons from it, and feeling sad isn't what I look for in a movie, so I'm rating it four stars instead of five.

1228799,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B001PPLJIQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 2]","This film is in many ways a drama that concerns us all because we produced the situation that prevailed after the victory/defeat of 1945.All Germans are responsible either because they voted for Hitler or because they were not able to unify against Hitler, thus enabling him to seize power with one third of the votes. Then you had the simple workers, employees and farmers who were hanged when trying to be trade-unionists, or deported. Everyone knew what it meant, saw the crimes and smelled the smoke.Then you had the middle and upper middle class, the university professors and intellectuals, the doctors and surgeons, the lawyers and judges who all decided that justice was the implementation of the law of the moment, hence of Hitler's law, and then in 1945 of the law imposed by the US or the USSR. The father and mother of the main male character are such people.Then you had those who came of age before the end of the war and got into it, including into the SS, like G&uuml;nther Grass. They took part in the atrocities, including Auschwitz, which is the case of the main female character. The liaison between the two main characters does not change one iota to that fact.Justice in that case cannot be only the retribution of a crime. It has to make sure the criminals they convict and sentence are really the authors of the acts that are brought against them. And in that case it is not true and the main male hero who is a law student when the trial takes place does not provide justice with what he knows, and that is a crime too.Three hundred people were burnt to death in a church whose doors had been locked and were not unlocked under the responsibility of six female SS. The problem for the court is to find out who is the leader of these six SS women. They satisfy themselves with the fact that the main female character acknowledges she wrote the report that was signed by the six women; that the five other women accuse this one to be the author. But they do not check if this woman can write. They assume she can. But she can't. The real leader of the six, the one who wrote the report is one of the five other women who was very lightly sentenced.But the main male character, and his law professor, does not do what he should have done: tell the court what he knew, that she was illiterate and that the sentence was a miscarriage of justice.

Directed by Stephen Daldry (""The Hours""-- one of my favorite movies ever)...this is a powerful, almost perfect film! It possesses an intiguing story, informative tensions between our needs for black and white moralities versus realities of here and now, and outstanding acting, direction, and editing. David Kross is perfectly cast as the young, impressionable Michael. It will be interesting to see where he goes from here. (And, as a side note-- let me just say it now-- he is HOT!!! And yes, for those of you who have heard about the nudity/sex in the film-- he bares it all several times...) Kate Winslet deserves yet another Oscar nomination in one of her most perfect roles to date... (I understand she is in the running for a ""best supporting actress"" nom. and if that is what it takes to finally land her the award, give it to her! Nevertheless, this is definetly a lead role... Politics of the Oscars -- ughhh)... The film pulls at your heart and thoughts as you find yourself questioning your beliefs on what is right and wrong in a number of controversial issues. Like many of the award contenders this season, this isn't a film to raise your spirits, but it will make you think long and hard about what happens and stay with you in the end...I had expected this to be a heavy WWII film-- something we have seen time and time again... However, I was very wrong. Although it does deal with the aftermath of war, it is a much deeper, more personal, storyline... This is an intimate human drama that I did not quite expect, having not known much about the film other than Kate Winslet was in it... Great movies transport you, and that is exactly what makes this as good as it is! It really does takes you away, and causes you to think and rethink... There are abundant life lessons contained in this film, and like Daldry's previous film ""The Hours"", I feel it deserves to be viewed multiple times to fully capture everything it has to offer.

1228803,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B001PPLJIQ,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[2, 2]","I saw ""The Reader"" over a month ago and had an almost visceral reaction to the film. The drama is certainly disturbing, as it would be, dealing with the Holocaust and Nazi concentration camps. It also gives the viewer an insight into the generation of Germans who came of age after the war. Although German post-war guilt is not a popular subject, the guilt these young people experienced, (and many still do), is tremendous, as they must come to grips with the crimes of their parents, teachers and others they love. The storyline, which addresses these issues, is unusual, because the point of view is that of a perpetrator not a victim. ""The Reader"" had an enormous impact on me. I find myself thinking about it even now - about the characters and the events that motivated and drove them.The film is constructed as a series of flashbacks. Opening in 1995 Berlin, attorney Michael Berg, (Ralph Fiennes), stares out of his office window at a passing train. His facial expression is one of great sadness. As the film progresses, the viewer begins to understand Berg's melancholy and the reasons for his emotional detachment. The image of the moving train segues to a moving tram, where a 16 year-old Michael, played by David Kross, is seated, hunched over, obviously very ill. The scenery is dark and drab, just as Germany was in the early post WWII years. He exits the tram and vomits in the doorway of an apartment building. Young Berg is discovered there, near collapse, by Hanna Schmitz, (Kate Winslet), a 36 year-old tram conductor. She lives in the same building where she discovers the adolescent boy. Hanna cleans him up and takes him home. He has scarlet fever. When he recovers, he returns to find the woman to thank her.The visit turns into a seduction, a very powerful one, as the viewer compares the youth's inexperience and innocence with Hanna's age, experience and apparent nonchalance. Michael is soon addicted to Hanna, and to sex with Hanna. A fast study, he becomes quite comfortable in his role as lover. He is a scholarly boy and loves books. Hanna, seeing a few of his books in his school briefcase, asks him to read aloud to her. She becomes as addicted to Michael as he is to her. Increasingly, however, his reading becomes her primary focus, more so than matters physical. He opens the world of Mark Twain, Homer, Chekhov, Tolstoy and D. H. Lawrence to her, undoubtedly a most extraordinary experience. Hanna's vulnerability is most apparent when she listens to Michael. The affair ends abruptly when Hanna disappears.Fast forward eight years -  Michael is in law school, and he and his classmates attend a war crimes trial where he recognizes Hanna as one of the defendants. She and the other women, former ""colleagues,"" are being tried as war criminals. They were guards at a concentration camp and are allegedly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of women. Michael has never gotten over his love for Hanna Schmitz...but how can he reconcile his feelings of love for a ""monster?"" And later, as an adult filled with guilt and shame, he is unable to open-up to the people in his life. How can he forgive himself? There are explanations, of course, for why Hanna performed the actions which led to such misery and death. But it is impossible to sympathize with one such as she. One can only begin to understand her complex, intense character...and the secret she keeps to her death.I won't write any more about the film's plot, because to do so would mean introducing ""spoilers."" I think ""The Reader"" is a 5 star film which would be a shame to miss, so I definitely do not want to spoil the movie for others.Director Stephen Daldry has done a remarkable job bringing this drama to life, as has David Hare, who adapted the screenplay from a bestselling book by the German author Bernard Schlink. Kate Winslet gives a powerfully haunting performance as Hanna Schmitz, as does David Kross, who is truly remarkable as the young Michael. I will be very surprised if Ms. Winslet doesn't win an Academy Award for her role. Bruno Ganz makes a brief appearance as a law professor, as does Lena Olin as a camp survivor. She meets Berg at the end of ""The Reader,"" when he travels to New York looking for answers. She tells him to, ""Go to the  theatre if you want catharsis. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out of the camps.""Jana Perskie",5,"""Go to the  theatre if you want catharsis. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps.

1228805,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B001PPLJIQ,Jason Bean,"[2, 2]","I find the best way to go into a film is to know as little about it as possible. I didn't know a thing about 'The Reader' before buying it on Amazon other than it starred Kate Winslet (who won an oscar) and Ralph Fiennes and Winslet plays yet another character who spends a good portion of a film wearing absolutely nothing and having sex. Sounded like a winning purchase ('Little Children' was a great movie after all). Turns out 'The Reader' is one of the best films I've seen in the last few years. It has a richly layered plot of human drama that hits on the generational attitudes of post-WWII Germany, the Holocaust, and brings up questions of guilt and blame.'The Reader' follows the character Michael Berg, a lawyer in Berlin who's distant with other people, particularly the women in his life. We learn through extended flash-backs that Michael at age 15 secretly carried on an affair with an older woman named Hanna. Along with sexual confrontations Michael and Hanna connect through stories as Hanna asks Michael to read books to her before (and sometimes during and after) their love-making. After the affair ends we follow Michael through college to present day (or 1995 in the movie's terms) and we see how his relationship with Hanna has effected the rest of his life, especially after witnessing a high-profile trial involving the Holocaust with Hanna as a defendant!What makes 'The Reader' work so well for me is that it doesn't provide any easy answers or solutions for it's characters. Michael is constantly confused and trying to understand, not just the actions of other characters in the film but his own emotions as well. Every decision he makes has a lasting impact on his life and this is perfectly realised in the story.As much as I love this film I do have two major complaints. No doubt anyone who's read Bernhard Schlink's book (also titled 'The Reader' on which this movie is based) knows a certain twist involving Hanna's character in the middle of the film. While this reveal is made obvious early on it's still treated as a major plot-twist through Michael's eyes and the montage really wasn't necessary.The other element that didn't strike true is the handling of the impact of the Holocaust. Despite being a major theme, the Holocaust is very much under-played throughout the movie and for the most part this is successful (and I loved how the uncomfortable confrontation between Ralph Fiennes and Lina Olin played out in the end). It was however very hard to get a grasp on the true horror of Hanna's actions, despite some emotional character reactions. Even Michael's walk through an abandond concentration camp didn't give weight to the heavy emotions the character must've been feeling. The audience is still treated as an outsider.Lots of praise for 'The Reader' comes from the performances of it's main three actors. Kate Winslet has always been a high-profile actress and in my opinion has never been better portraying Hanna from her mid-thirties to elderly age towards the end of the story. Ralph Fiennes is equally good playing a man who's been haunted his entire life by his past and the decisions he's made. Screen legend Bruno Ganz is given a great role as Michael's Law-teacher and he's excellent! Perhaps the best performance of the film, though is by unknown actor David Kross who plays Michael from age 15 to 18 (where most of the film takes place). Watching him change from naive boy to young adult coming to terms with some harsh realizations really commands your attention.Despite some complaints, 'The Reader' gripped me and held my interest from beginning to end. I was absolutely mesmerized by this film and I very much recommend it to anyone who likes good human-drama as well as movies about Germany's attitudes towards the Holocaust.(For like-movies check out: Europa Europa, The Tin Drum, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and The Pianist.)",5,Thought-provoking and engaging!,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,3902,"['find', 'best', 'way', 'go', 'film', 'know', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'thing', ""'The"", 'Reader', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'other', 'starred', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'won', 'oscar', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Winslet', 'yet', 'character', 'who', 'good', 'portion', 'film', 'wearing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'having', 'sex', 'Sounded', 'winning', 'purchase', ""'Little"", 'Children', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'out', ""'The"", 'Reader', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'richly', 'layered', 'plot', 'human', 'drama', 'generational', 'attitudes', 'post-WWII', 'Germany', 'Holocaust', 'up', 'questions', 'guilt', 'blame', 'Reader', 'character', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'lawyer', 'Berlin', 'who', 'distant', 'other', 'people', 'particularly', 'women', 'life', 'learn', 'extended', 'flash-backs', 'Michael', 'age', '15', 'secretly', 'carried', 'affair', 'older', 'woman', 'named', 'Hanna', 'sexual', 'confrontations', 'Michael', 'Hanna', 'connect', 'stories', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'read', 'books', 'before', 'sometimes', 'love-making', 'affair', 'follow', 'Michael', 'college', 'present', 'day', '1995', 'movie', 'terms', 'see', 'how', 'relationship', 'Hanna', 'effected', 'rest', 'life', 'especially', 'witnessing', 'high-profile', 'trial', 'involving', 'Holocaust', 'Hanna', 'defendant', 'What', ""'The"", 'Reader', 'work', 'so', 'well', ""n't"", 'provide', 'easy', 'answers', 'solutions', 'characters', 'Michael', 'constantly', 'confused', 'trying', 'understand', 'not', 'just', 'actions', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'own', 'emotions', 'well', 'decision', 'lasting', 'impact', 'life', 'perfectly', 'realised', 'story.As', 'much', 'love', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'major', 'complaints', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Bernhard', 'Schlink', 'book', 'also', 'titled', ""'The"", 'Reader', 'movie', 'based', 'certain', 'twist', 'involving', 'Hanna', 'character', 'middle', 'film', 'reveal', 'made', 'obvious', 'early', 'still', 'treated', 'major', 'plot-twist', 'Michael', 'eyes', 'montage', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary.The', 'other', 'element', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'true', 'handling', 'impact', 'Holocaust', 'being', 'major', 'theme', 'Holocaust', 'very', 'much', 'under-played', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'successful', 'loved', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'confrontation', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Lina', 'Olin', 'played', 'out', 'end', 'was', 'however', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'grasp', 'true', 'horror', 'Hanna', 'actions', 'emotional', 'character', 'reactions', 'Even', 'Michael', 'walk', 'abandond', 'concentration', 'camp', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'weight', 'heavy', 'emotions', 'character', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'feeling', 'audience', 'still', 'treated', 'outsider.Lots', 'praise', ""'The"", 'Reader', 'performances', 'main', 'three', 'actors', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'always', 'been', 'high-profile', 'actress', 'opinion', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'portraying', 'Hanna', 'mid-thirties', 'elderly', 'age', 'towards', 'end', 'story', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'equally', 'good', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'haunted', 'entire', 'life', 'past', 'decisions', 'made', 'Screen', 'legend', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'given', 'great', 'role', 'Michael', 'Law-teacher', 'excellent', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'unknown', 'actor', 'David', 'Kross', 'who', 'Michael', 'age', '15', '18', 'where', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'Watching', 'change', 'naive', 'boy', 'young', 'adult', 'coming', 'terms', 'harsh', 'realizations', 'really', 'attention.Despite', 'complaints', 'Reader', 'gripped', 'held', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'absolutely', 'mesmerized', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'human-drama', 'as', 'well', 'movies', 'Germany', 'attitudes', 'Holocaust', 'like-movies', 'check', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'Tin', 'Drum', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'Pianist']",N/A

What follows is an affair, sometimes innocent and at others tumultuous, that bonds the two despite their dissimilarities, over books and bedroom trysts.  After an abrupt and confusing end to their affair, Michael - now a law student - attends a seminar through which he reunites with Hannah in a less than pleasant manner.  A stupid decision fueled by shame overrules Hannah's logic, and desire to keep her illiteracy a secret outweighs her care or understanding of eventuality.  Years later they reacquaint - Michael now played by Ralph Fiennes - in a less than conventional manner that rekindles some of the past's feelings.  The final results are a personal travesty but an unobjectionably just resolution for humanity.Since the spoiler for this film is painfully clear, it's easy to speak of Hannah's past.  Having personally been to Dachau - not to mention having read Elie Wiesel's novel Night - I was ill affected by the attempts at compassion for the monster wearing a Kate Winslet disguise; her plight fell on deaf ears.  Neither stupidity nor apathy is a sufficient excuse for her actions, and anyone with even a cursory understanding of history shouldn't shed a tear over the final outcome of this film.  Brooks from Shawshank Redemption she is not.  Her character is a morally bankrupt, soulless, mass murdered responsible for willfully taking part in an attempted genocide.  Period.Despite the somber tone and misplaced attempt at sympathy, this is nonetheless the tour de force of Winslet's career.  Her acting range is magnificent; her portrayal flawless.  It's almost a successful reconciliation and I could see how the situation would sway viewers.  Both Kross and Fiennes play second fiddle very well.  Aside from a few minor developments, the script is fairly predictable.Ignoring the ephebophilia and the misplaced attempts at sympathy, this is a pretty good movie.Jason Elin",4,A Holocaust tale with twisted morality,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,2114,"['post', 'WWII', 'Germany', 'teenager', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'David', 'Kross', 'ill', 'one', 'day', 'fate', 'brings', 'doorstep', 'Hannah', 'Schmitz', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'simple', 'tram', 'worker', 'mysterious', 'past', 'who', 'twice', 'Michael', 'age', 'What', 'affair', 'sometimes', 'innocent', 'others', 'tumultuous', 'bonds', 'two', 'dissimilarities', 'books', 'bedroom', 'trysts', 'abrupt', 'confusing', 'end', 'affair', 'Michael', 'now', 'law', 'student', 'seminar', 'Hannah', 'less', 'pleasant', 'manner', 'stupid', 'decision', 'fueled', 'shame', 'overrules', 'Hannah', 'logic', 'desire', 'keep', 'illiteracy', 'secret', 'care', 'understanding', 'eventuality', 'Years', 'later', 'reacquaint', 'Michael', 'now', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'less', 'conventional', 'manner', 'past', 'feelings', 'final', 'results', 'are', 'personal', 'travesty', 'unobjectionably', 'just', 'resolution', 'humanity.Since', 'spoiler', 'film', 'painfully', 'clear', 'easy', 'speak', 'Hannah', 'past', 'Having', 'personally', 'been', 'Dachau', 'not', 'mention', 'having', 'read', 'Elie', 'Wiesel', 'novel', 'Night', 'was', 'ill', 'affected', 'attempts', 'compassion', 'monster', 'wearing', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'disguise', 'plight', 'fell', 'deaf', 'ears', 'stupidity', 'apathy', 'sufficient', 'excuse', 'actions', 'anyone', 'even', 'cursory', 'understanding', 'history', 'should', ""n't"", 'shed', 'tear', 'final', 'outcome', 'film', 'Brooks', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'not', 'character', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'soulless', 'mass', 'murdered', 'responsible', 'willfully', 'taking', 'part', 'attempted', 'genocide', 'Period.Despite', 'somber', 'tone', 'misplaced', 'attempt', 'sympathy', 'nonetheless', 'tour', 'force', 'Winslet', 'career', 'acting', 'range', 'magnificent', 'portrayal', 'flawless', 'almost', 'successful', 'reconciliation', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'situation', 'would', 'sway', 'viewers', 'Kross', 'Fiennes', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'very', 'well', 'Aside', 'few', 'minor', 'developments', 'script', 'fairly', 'predictable.Ignoring', 'ephebophilia', 'misplaced', 'attempts', 'sympathy', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

B Kraft ""lonestargazer""","[0, 0]","The difference between Art and mere Entertainment, is Art causes us to think and feel -- sometimes thoughts and feelings that are not exactly enjoyable. If I have ever seen a movie that is Art, it is ""The Reader.""When I undertook my undergraduate studies, I decided to focus on 20th Century European History because I wanted to understand how and why the Holocaust happened. I even had opportunities over the years to talk to a few survivors of the camps and to talk with Germans who denied knowing anything at the time. Needless to say, I did not achieve understanding despite reading countless books and watching documentaries and films that dealt with that subject directly or indirectly. I cannot wait to read the novel, because this movie ""takes no prisoners"", which is a tribute to its actors, director, and the exquisite job of editing in the released version.I will take a moment to contrast The Reader with another fine movie, Schindler's List. Both are powerful movies, but Schindler's List is easier on the viewer, because it is so easy to say: ""I would have been like Schindler."" Inevitably, that enables us to avoid a deep confrontation with not only our own possibility of evil, but the ease with which our race will allow evil to happen to others or even assist. In no way is The Reader easy on the viewer!The Reader, on the other hand, hits you squarely between the eyes with the question of knowing the right thing to do . . . and doing nothing. There was a particularly gripping scene in the meeting between a now-older woman in New York who as a child had been an Auchwitz inmate and between the adult lawyer after Hanna's death. She remarks people are always asking her about what she learned in the camps, and she vehemently says, ""Nothing. . . . Nothing comes out of the camps!""This somehow resonates that nobody can draw any lofty conclusions from the fact that our race so easily perpetrates and endures genocide. Perfectly ordinary people go to great lengths to hide its existence under their very noses.As other viewers have said, this requires the right frame of mind to confront what it depicts. In some ways, the nudity particularly will keep any well-intentioned parent from watching it with immature children.

What it doesn't have is that certain something that brings a film's elements together into something special.It's hard to discuss the movie without giving away its major surprise elements. But here goes. A 15-year-old schoolboy in post-war Berlin has a love affair with a 40-ish woman with a past. Kate Winslet plays the woman, and Ralph Fiennes plays the young man as grown up.I found the movie tedious and perplexing. It put my wife to sleep. The first hour focused on the rather raw sexual liaison between the schoolboy and his mistress. There was lots of nudity and groping and washing and sex -- discomfiting and not very interesting from a viewer's perspective. Then, the woman's past is revealed, and the young man has a chance to help his lover. Inexplicably, he does not. We see him brooding and moping, but have no idea what is going on in his head. Even as as grownup, his motives and continued cowardice have no explanation. By the time the credits rolled, the audience heaved out of its seats in relief.""The Reader"" purports to be a film about moral complexities in post-war Germany. But it never manages to get beyond the facades of the debate. Whatever we might have learned about the difficulty of feeling loyalty to a person and repulsion by their actions is left to our imaginations. Indeed the one and only scene of any emotional depth occurred toward the end of the film when Fiennes visits a camp survivor in New York. That 15 minutes was tense and captivating. The rest of the the movie was flat and listless -- an excuse for Kate Winslet to show off her body. That's when it was not deliberately confusing. Winslet played her brutal, amoral character as a doe-eyed sensitive. That's poor acting or direction, not complex characterization. Another point of confusion was the young man's home life. His father was supposedly a stern disciplinarian. But his son somehow managed to stay out late night after night and take a 2-day solo bike trip into the mountains.I don't know how this sloppy, badly-played film managed to cop a Best Picture nod. It's certainly not a feel-good story about illiteracy, young love, morality or the conquest of truth over evil. Just a jumble of ideas and images strung together to no particular purpose.

Other than that, the movie defies logic and leaves you wanting more.My biggest complaint was that the movie makers wants us to believe that the handsome, adorable German youth would fall in love with someone as scrubby, ugly and plain looking as the Hannah character.  Lust, yes. He's young and lusty and she might have been a brief sexual encounter before he goes out into the world.But we're supposed to believe that he loves her over the years--even after she's convicted by a court of mass murder. If possible, she looks even more grubby, plain and repulsive. She never shows us a trace of charm, wit or beauty. She's just a stolid mass of mangy hair and a plain body and she lives in a dark, depressing hovel of an apartment.Ralph Fiennes portrays the lad as a grownup but he is so quiet and subdued and blank that his later admission to the daughter of a Nazi concentration camp is embarassing to watch. The close-up of him, in tears, and feeling so sorry for himself is cringe-worthy.I watched this in the movie theater and am glad I did. But once was enough.

Rooney,"[4, 5]","In ""The Reader"" Kate Winslet is fantastic, David Kross as young Michael gives a break-out performance, and Ralph Fiennes as the old Michael is fine, but he seems to take depression and melancholy to a new depth. As an older man he tells his grown daughter, ""I'm not open with anyone.""Michael, a fifteen-year-old boy has an affair with Hanna, a thirty-six year old streetcar conductor. Michael disavows Hanna almost from the very beginning. Hanna is often rude and domineering. Once she says, ""You don't matter enough to me, to upset me."" One time he says, ""Everything is always on your terms.""She has a secret that only Michael eventually learns about. A teacher says ""The Odyssey"" is about holding secrets that characters are determined not to disclose. The movie is erotic with some steamy lovemaking.After seeing the movie and reading the book I am of two minds: I don't fully understand Michael's motivation for doing certain things, and I don't agree with what he does. Why doesn't he give a key piece of exculpatory evidence to the judge? Only because Hanna wouldn't want him to? And when he finally meets her after all those years, why doesn't he hug, embrace her? Why is he so cold and accusatory? And why does he say he'll no longer read to her? Why didn't he answer her letters? Is he acting as judge and jury after she has served her time?When he was a teenage boy, she made him happy. When he was a grown man, he made her miserable by not answering her letters, acting so coldly. Was he paying her back? For what?Like the book, the movie is sad, a downer, and really a tragedy for both lovers. The movie makes few changes from the book, and it is a more moving and powerful statement than the book particularly in the section in which Fiennes makes tapes for Hanna. The movie has subtleties that the book couldn't convey such as Anna's feelings in visiting the church on their bike trip. The courtroom scene recalling the forced march and the church crematorium is riveting.

Wright,"[3, 5]","There seem to be two films here:  The first half is a lovely exploration of the relationship between a very young boy and an older woman, beautifully captured by its two actors.  Newcomer David Kross turns in a fine performance that fully captures the confusion and abundant sexuality of adolescence, and Kate Winslet surely earned her Oscar.  Alas, the story loses its grip on us in the second half, wherein the author begins to manipulate us with serial improbabilities, utterly false plot turns, and shallow moralizing.  Worse, we are made to endure yet another brooding portrait of misery from actor Ralph Fiennes.  No actor in my experience has ever become so tedious and predictable.  By the time we get to the war crimes trial, I, for one, refuse to believe that the young man just happened upon the trial of his former lover, or that he just happened to be a law student, or that she would refuse to confess her illiteracy to avoid a life sentence, or that he would likewise refuse to reveal her secret.  The author has created a most improbable straw woman in furtherance of his shallow moralizing.  What we have here is the kind of story designed to make Book Club members (Oprah!) feel that they have grappled with a very difficult subject, when, in truth, they have merely experienced a pale and shallow version of a very large and difficult subject - that of German war guilt.  So it is with this film, which is content to exploit the Holocaust as a plot device (always a sure way to get noticed at Oscar season).  For example, our hero is seen in one sequence touring one of the concentration camps:  Gazing forlornly through the barbed wire; walking down a long hall full of empty shoes; meditating in front of the ovens, etc.  Aside from the fact that a real camp would be thronged with tourists, not empty as it is here, these scenes are merely cheap shorthand meant to manipulate us and instill a generic sense of guilt.  In the penultimate scene (surely meant to drip with irony and meaning), the author of a Holocaust memoir who had testified at the original trial, now a very wealthy woman in a fabulous art-filled apartment (Holocaust memoirs, it seems, can be very lucrative), sanctimoniously refuses the few dollars willed to her by the guilty woman:  All possibility of redemption and innocence is forbidden.  Poor Ralph Fiennes' character must carry his guilt a little longer, until he finally confesses his story to his daughter.  The mantra ""confession is good for the soul"" has become the chief clich&eacute; of our age.The film itself is very nicely made and photographed, with excellent period detail.  Both the director and the screenwriter are very talented people - it is quite difficult to successfully translate a literary first-person narrative into a film narrative, and it is nicely done here.

The affair at first seems to be about sex. When Michael brings his schoolbooks to Hannah's house, which includes a copy of The Odyssey, Hannah asks Michael to read it to her. Throughout the summer of their affair Michael reads book after book to her until one day Hannah disappears without any explanation to Michael.Michael assimilates the loss of Hannah into his life and moves on becoming a law student. One day one of his professors takes Michael and the class to a war crimes trial where Michael discovers Hannah is one of the defendants. During the war Hannah had a been a prison guard and true to Hannah's character she had become a guard because it was a good job, and still truer to Hannah's character is the revelation that Hannah asked the prisoners to read to her. Michael is devastated to learn why Hannah picked a prisoner to read to her and what happened to them afterwards. But Hannah has a deeper secret, one she fears revealing more than a war crime. Michael has information that would exonerate Hannah, and if Michael helps her or doesn't sets the moral conflict of the story. Both sides of the issue are discernable, arguable and provocative.Michael grows up to be Ralph Fiennes, and Kross looks enough like Fiennes that there's no jolt as the movie switches from a young Michael to the older Michael. You believe Kross can grow up to be Fiennes. Fiennes as the older Michael and half a lifetime away from Hannah still can't come to grips with the effect, both positive and negative that Hannah has had on his life, as he tries to assuage his guilt in an attempt to come to terms with it.The acting is uniformly great throughout the movie and David Kross holds his own with both Winslet and Fiennes. While Fiennes is consistently good in the movie, this is Winslet's movie. One scene that stands out is a moment between Fiennes and Winslet when Hannah wants and needs to be held by Michael and her body betrays her emotions. It is a moment rarely seen in actors that they can portray their characters so viscerally and vulnerably. It's a nuanced gesture that says so much for the character and for Winslet's increasing acting abilities.I like bonus features on DVD's and The Reader has plenty of bonuses for you. There are deleted scenes that seem like they could have only been deleted for time considerations because they add to, or would have added to the understanding of Hannah. Usually, when watching deleted scenes you understand why they were deleted, but not in this case.There are also featurettes about the making of the movie, Kate Winslet explaining the make-up (which is actually interesting and funny) and a featurette about the composer as well as the set design of the movie.From the movie to the bonus features this a complete and full package for someone looking for a good movie to add to their DVD collection.",5,Sex and Nazis in Post War Germany,1239926400,"04 17, 2009",2009,3183,"['Reader', 'set', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Germany', 'late', '50', 'where', 'post-war', 'generation', 'simultaneously', 'trying', 'forget', 'come', 'terms', 'literally', 'sins', 'fathers', 'mothers', 'Nazi', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Michael', 'Burke', 'David', 'Kross', 'Hannah', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'older', 'woman', 'have', 'affair', 'affair', 'first', 'be', 'sex', 'When', 'Michael', 'schoolbooks', 'Hannah', 'house', 'copy', 'Odyssey', 'Hannah', 'Michael', 'read', 'summer', 'affair', 'Michael', 'book', 'book', 'one', 'day', 'Hannah', 'explanation', 'Michael.Michael', 'loss', 'Hannah', 'life', 'moves', 'becoming', 'law', 'student', 'One', 'day', 'one', 'professors', 'Michael', 'class', 'war', 'trial', 'where', 'Michael', 'Hannah', 'one', 'defendants', 'war', 'Hannah', 'had', 'been', 'prison', 'guard', 'true', 'Hannah', 'character', 'had', 'become', 'guard', 'was', 'good', 'job', 'still', 'truer', 'Hannah', 'character', 'revelation', 'Hannah', 'asked', 'prisoners', 'read', 'Michael', 'devastated', 'learn', 'why', 'Hannah', 'picked', 'prisoner', 'read', 'what', 'happened', 'afterwards', 'Hannah', 'deeper', 'secret', 'one', 'revealing', 'more', 'war', 'crime', 'Michael', 'information', 'would', 'exonerate', 'Hannah', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'sets', 'moral', 'conflict', 'story', 'sides', 'issue', 'are', 'discernable', 'arguable', 'provocative.Michael', 'up', 'be', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Kross', 'enough', 'Fiennes', 'jolt', 'movie', 'young', 'Michael', 'older', 'Michael', 'believe', 'Kross', 'can', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'Fiennes', 'Fiennes', 'older', 'Michael', 'lifetime', 'away', 'Hannah', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'grips', 'effect', 'positive', 'negative', 'Hannah', 'had', 'life', 'assuage', 'guilt', 'attempt', 'come', 'terms', 'it.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'great', 'movie', 'David', 'Kross', 'own', 'Winslet', 'Fiennes', 'Fiennes', 'consistently', 'good', 'movie', 'Winslet', 'movie', 'One', 'scene', 'out', 'moment', 'Fiennes', 'Winslet', 'when', 'Hannah', 'be', 'held', 'Michael', 'body', 'emotions', 'moment', 'rarely', 'seen', 'actors', 'can', 'portray', 'characters', 'so', 'viscerally', 'vulnerably', 'nuanced', 'gesture', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'Winslet', 'increasing', 'acting', 'abilities.I', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'Reader', 'plenty', 'bonuses', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'seem', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'deleted', 'time', 'considerations', 'add', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'understanding', 'Hannah', 'Usually', 'when', 'watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'not', 'case.There', 'are', 'also', 'making', 'movie', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'explaining', 'make-up', 'actually', 'interesting', 'funny', 'featurette', 'composer', 'as', 'well', 'set', 'design', 'movie.From', 'movie', 'bonus', 'complete', 'full', 'package', 'someone', 'looking', 'good', 'movie', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

That said, this film definitely didn't disappoint.This film, along with Atonement and several others, really outlines the grey areas of war.  Kate Winslet plays Hanna, a thirty something German woman with a dark past, who in the late 1950s, has a short affair with then teenager Michael.  Hanna, who is illiterate, requests the young student Michael to read books to her during their time together, a detail which becomes important later on.  As you may imagine, the affair between Hanna and Michael is transient, but has long-lasting impacts on them both.  Several years later, their paths cross again--this time Michael is a law student observing a well-publicized trial condemning former SS prison guards--and Hanna, a defendant. Hanna goes through great depths to hide her illiteracy, and those actions ultimately damage her during the trial as she is given a life sentence.Kate Winslet's performance as Hanna is the centerpiece of the film...as we are introduced to the character in the beginning of the film, we know nothing of her past life.  Hanna seems an ordinary, introverted working-class woman, and only later as the story unfolds do we begin to judge her harshly for her previous actions.  Her character has several sides--in one we see Hanna as a sympathetic character, helping a young stranger--Michael--on the street when he falls ill with scarlet fever.  Yet Hanna is also capable of taking the lives of many innocent strangers.Fiennes as Michael is a striking counterpart; he struggles along with the viewer as he learns of Hanna's past, entirely different from the woman he once loved.Overall, this was a somber but thought-provoking film, and worth watching.",5,Striking performance by Kate Winslet,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1829,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'came', 'movie', 'browsing', 'was', 'drawn', 'fact', 'Winslet', 'received', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'said', 'film', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint.This', 'film', 'Atonement', 'several', 'others', 'really', 'grey', 'areas', 'war', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Hanna', 'thirty', 'something', 'German', 'woman', 'dark', 'past', 'who', 'late', '1950s', 'short', 'affair', 'then', 'teenager', 'Michael', 'Hanna', 'who', 'illiterate', 'young', 'student', 'Michael', 'read', 'books', 'time', 'together', 'detail', 'important', 'later', 'may', 'imagine', 'affair', 'Hanna', 'Michael', 'transient', 'long-lasting', 'impacts', 'Several', 'years', 'later', 'paths', 'cross', 'again', 'time', 'Michael', 'law', 'student', 'observing', 'well-publicized', 'trial', 'condemning', 'former', 'SS', 'prison', 'guards', 'Hanna', 'defendant', 'Hanna', 'great', 'depths', 'hide', 'illiteracy', 'actions', 'ultimately', 'damage', 'trial', 'given', 'life', 'sentence.Kate', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'Hanna', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'are', 'introduced', 'character', 'beginning', 'film', 'know', 'nothing', 'past', 'life', 'Hanna', 'ordinary', 'introverted', 'working-class', 'woman', 'only', 'later', 'story', 'unfolds', 'do', 'begin', 'judge', 'harshly', 'previous', 'actions', 'character', 'several', 'sides', 'one', 'see', 'Hanna', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'helping', 'young', 'stranger', 'Michael', 'street', 'when', 'ill', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'Hanna', 'also', 'capable', 'taking', 'lives', 'many', 'innocent', 'strangers.Fiennes', 'Michael', 'striking', 'counterpart', 'viewer', 'Hanna', 'past', 'entirely', 'different', 'woman', 'once', 'loved.Overall', 'was', 'somber', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

1228844,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B001PPLJIQ,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[0, 1]","First off, let me start by saying that I began viewing this movie, with not only a totally open mind, but also an excited & eager/enthusiastic one as well. Because as bad as it may or does sound, I have been a Holocaust buff, and have been interested in anything & everything about the Holocaust (especially HOW & WHY it was allowed to happen) for almost as long as I can remember.As such, movies (and books) dealing with the Holocaust are & have been a favorite genre, and therefore I was really looking forward to seeing this film - particularly since the blurbs/synopses implied, ""The Reader"" is a Holocaust movie with themes focusing on the HOW & WHY of its occurrence, something I am especially interested in.However, I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with this movie.First of all, the movie dragged on WAY too much - especially in the beginning/middle, without (or before) even getting into the subject of the Holocaust. It wasted too much time (literally almost HALF the film!) on the steamy/torrid summer affair between the thirty-something Kate Winslet's character, Hanna Schmitz, and the teenage Michael Berg (played by David Kross in the 15/16 year old character & Ralph Fiennes as an adult)Seriously, at least the first 40 minutes (if not more!) of this 2 hour movie was spent on the clearly pedophilic affair between Hanna Schmitz and Michael Berg, which could've done with a FRACTION of the time spent on it, and that, in all honesty, boils down to just a few points:1. Michael gets sick, walking home from school & is helped to get back home by Hanna Schmitz, after which it is learned that Michael is stricken with scarlet fever and has to be bedridden for 3 months.2. After recovering, Michael goes to Hanna's with flowers to thank her, for her help, and unexplainably ends up in a steamy pedophilic affair with this 30-something stranger during which Michael reading to Hanna from various books is the foreplay, and he neglects his family, friends & social events to spend all his time with Hanna, seemingly without more than a cursory mention by his father once, in regards to his being tardy to dinner.3. After a torrid summer affair, Hanna suddenly moves with NO word to Michael, leaving him bereft & despondent.Unfortunately, even after this endless half (more or less, anyway!) the movie doesn't get that much better.Eight years after the affair with Hanna, Michael is a law student, taking a special seminar in which he observes the trial of some female Nazi guards who had let 300 people burn to death in a locked & barred church, and discovers, to his dismay, that one of the guards on trial is his own former lover, Hanna Schmitz.Yet though Michael is harboring a secret of Hanna's that could, though not necessarily exonerate her completely, could clear her of the most serious charges, and despite even his professor urging him to come clean to the court, he does not & just lets whatever is to happen to Hanna to happen.On top of that, with the exception of a brief mention, by a fellow classmate of Michael's, who brings up the fact that despite everyone knowing about the concentration camps & death camps, how & why did the Holocaust happen, the second half of the movie is wasted focusing on this secret about Hanna that Michael is harboring, and bouncing back ad forth between various time periods, (1995, 1958, the mid-to-late 60's, 1976, 1988, etc.) and random unrelated/disconncted scenes (like one scene of Michael taking his daughter to Neustadt [his childhood hometown] out of the blue to visit his widowed mother).I foundThe Readerto be a pretty confusing movie, and one of the few (or only, I think) Holocaust movies that I've seen that I did not neither enjoyed (as much as one can enjoy a Holocaust movie) nor find informative in the slightest.Although would NOT say that ""The Reader"" is a BAD movie, it definitely is NOT that great, nor worthy of all the good reviews & 5-star ratings on here!

He's called that because he reads books to Schmidt, first during their affair in postwar Germany during the 1960s, and later when he sends her books on tape while she is serving a prison sentence.The reader's role in this film is essential to the subterranean themes that dominate the Schmidt character. A German, Schmidt becomes a member of the Nazi SS during the war and takes part in a pogrom of Jewish women and children. When tried for the crime, her court testimony indicates she had no option but to do this because she was programmed in life to do exactly as told. This typical Nazi theme carries over to all parts of her life -- first as a ticket puncher on a railway car and, later, as the willing participant in the affair with the younger man.Her roles in both places are described for her by the other participants in her life, not by her. She demonstrates a near total lack of initiative and personal decision-making. At one point in the trial, the judge asks why she allowed all the prisoners to die. ""What else was I to do?"" she replied. ""They'd have escaped otherwise. What would you have done."" The ""reader"" also does something for her she cannot -- read. This terrible secret, Hannad Schmidt's illiteracy, also forms the basis for everything that happens in her life.""The Reader"" is an involving film that forces viewers to re-examine old ideas about good and evil and the differences between personal and national will. Winslet's performance is marvelous, always credible and two-dimensional even though she is the victim of poor makeup work late in the movie that works against her. She is not a fully developed human being but more comprehensive than the usual Nazi criminal. Ralph Fiennes, who is not a great actor but always gets great roles, seems both sympathetic to her and abhorrent to her at times in the movie. The fellow that plays his role as a teenager and young man, David Kross, is more convincing and has the meatier part of the role to play during Schmidt's trial for war crimes.This film is worth buying and watching though it lacks the package that made ""The English Patient"" the Oscar winner for best movie in 1996. In a world full of flicks made on a dime with no thought whatsoever given to what they are going to say, ""The Reader"" tells a story and is full of ideas and conflicts you may not have seen in cinema previously.

1228855,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B001PPLJIQ,lily t.,"[0, 0]","When I first saw this movie in the theaters, I thought it had the resonance of truth to it. I googled Bernhardt Schlink, the author , who is a jurist today. Schlink's own parents were theologians and his father lost his professorship under the Nazi regime. So when Schlink asks the question, prevalent among his generation, how could the people we loved and depended on most have done such heinous things, to whom is he referring? It turns out it was a beloved and gifted schoolmaster who transmitted his love of literature and reading to his pupils --and who had [ I believe and I read the interview in 2009 ] been in the SS -directly responsible for the deaths of three people. The teacher apparently felt a tremendous sense of guilt about it, yet Schlink could not reconcile this kind, sensitive man with the brutal image of a Nazi.Every author fictionalizes their own story and preoccupations in certain ways. I suppose Schlink didn't think the tale of a boy and a schoolmaster would make for particularly exciting reading, so he upped the story a few notches by adding the romance. Why a literate SS officer became an illiterate camp guard is perhaps an interesting question. More interesting is how the Michael character comes to terms over the years with the dilemma of having loved someone who had done monstrous things- And then forgiving that person as well as himself for loving her.For those viewers who are scandalized by the notion of a sixteen year old boy having sex with a grown woman, I'll say that according to my late father, uncles and their friends, it was a very commonplace occurrence in post-war Europe simply because so many adult men had died in the war, or were held in Soviet camps, or had fled or been stranded outside of their own countries when the iron curtain fell. Additionally, though the boy in the film was younger, a baby, during the war years, most boys had to grow up very quickly during the war and the sometimes harsh postwar years, so by comparison, sex was rather a mundane, albeit, pleasant event.Moving with wonderful performances all around.",4,True but sexed up,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,2089,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'thought', 'had', 'resonance', 'truth', 'googled', 'Bernhardt', 'Schlink', 'author', 'who', 'jurist', 'today', 'Schlink', 'own', 'parents', 'were', 'theologians', 'father', 'lost', 'professorship', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'So', 'when', 'Schlink', 'question', 'prevalent', 'generation', 'how', 'could', 'people', 'loved', 'depended', 'most', 'have', 'done', 'such', 'heinous', 'things', 'whom', 'referring', 'out', 'was', 'beloved', 'gifted', 'schoolmaster', 'who', 'transmitted', 'love', 'literature', 'reading', 'pupils', 'who', 'had', '[', 'believe', 'read', 'interview', '2009', ']', 'been', 'SS', '-directly', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'three', 'people', 'teacher', 'apparently', 'felt', 'tremendous', 'sense', 'guilt', 'yet', 'Schlink', 'could', 'not', 'reconcile', 'kind', 'sensitive', 'man', 'brutal', 'image', 'Nazi.Every', 'author', 'own', 'story', 'preoccupations', 'certain', 'ways', 'suppose', 'Schlink', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'tale', 'boy', 'schoolmaster', 'would', 'make', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'reading', 'upped', 'story', 'few', 'notches', 'adding', 'romance', 'Why', 'literate', 'SS', 'officer', 'became', 'illiterate', 'camp', 'guard', 'perhaps', 'interesting', 'question', 'More', 'interesting', 'how', 'Michael', 'character', 'terms', 'years', 'dilemma', 'having', 'loved', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'monstrous', 'things-', 'then', 'forgiving', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'loving', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'scandalized', 'notion', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'having', 'sex', 'grown', 'woman', ""'ll"", 'say', 'according', 'late', 'father', 'uncles', 'friends', 'was', 'very', 'commonplace', 'occurrence', 'post-war', 'Europe', 'simply', 'so', 'many', 'adult', 'men', 'had', 'died', 'war', 'were', 'held', 'Soviet', 'camps', 'had', 'fled', 'been', 'stranded', 'own', 'countries', 'when', 'iron', 'curtain', 'fell', 'Additionally', 'boy', 'film', 'was', 'younger', 'baby', 'war', 'years', 'most', 'boys', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'very', 'quickly', 'war', 'sometimes', 'harsh', 'postwar', 'years', 'so', 'comparison', 'sex', 'was', 'rather', 'mundane', 'albeit', 'pleasant', 'event.Moving', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'around']",N/A

But that didn't stop me from loving this 2008 film version which received several Academy Award nominations including a Best Actress award to Kate Winslett. The film explores the many faces of guilt and redemption and doesn't necessarily draw conclusions.  It just tells a story and lets the viewer be the judge.  And, when it was over there was much to ponder about.The film is set in Germany and opens in 1958 when Kate Winslet, who is employed as a ticket-taker on a bus, befriends a teenage boy, played by David Kross, who is sick. Their relationship blossoms into a full blown affair in which they take baths together and he reads to her.  Suddenly, she leaves him and he is heartbroken.  Fast-forward to 1966 when he is a law student observing a trial against six female former Nazi concentration camp guards.  He is shocked to see her as a defendant, especially when the other five women accuse her of being in charge.  He has information that could help her but he keeps silent.  Years pass, and Ralph Fiennes, who is cast as the grown up boy, tries to redeem himself.  How this all plays out is the stuff of fine theater.Subtle questions are raised.  What is the nature of guilt?  Why do people keep silent?  How does this effect a person's life?  The film is a allegory for what happened in Germany all those years ago when ordinary people got caught up in what they considered just doing their jobs or keeping silent to protect themselves.This is a truly fine film.  The acting was exceptional and the mood and tone were perfect to explore the ambiguities of human nature.  I give it my highest recommendation.

1228858,A1D8BC9UD8LTHJ,B001PPLJIQ,Little Me,"[2, 2]","I've read the book. I've seen the movie. I liked both. Definitely 4 stars each.The movie follows the book very closely. The acting is excellent, especially Kate Winslet as Hanna Schmitz. The directing and cinematography are top notch, and the locations are accurately portrayed with sets spanning the last five decades of the 20th century. The story takes place in German after WWII in the long dark shadow of the holocaust. A young man of late high school age, Michael, has a love affair with an older woman, Hanna, who was a prison guard during WWII. The first part of the movie is a coming-of-age story. The second part of the movie centers around Hanna's actions during WWII, her subsequent trial and imprisonment, and Michael's adult life. The story does have a significant twist, Hanna's illiteracy. It makes me wonder what her childhood was like, probably austere or even abusive, but neither the book nor the movie give us any hints in that regard.My wife and I enjoyed the love story and found the social context and deeper moral conundrums very interesting. (The DVD extras and special features provide additional background material.) What at first seems to be a relatively simple story, contains several personal, emotional, and historical complexities. I think that's what they call ""subtle."" Here's another element that helps the film: The older Michael Berg played by Ralph Fiennes is a plausible representation of the younger Michael Berg played by David Kross. You can see the younger man in the older man's face. But the weight of his youth has turned his adult life into an abstraction. Hanna has spoiled him for all other women. He has become The Reader.Near the end of the movie, Lena Olin does a masterful job of playing the last survivor of the church fire which resulted in the deaths of 300 Jewish prisoners. She's perceptive, wise, and self assured. Her performance gives the movie a small, but vital, degree of closure. The victim speaks.

However, after reading some of the reviews posted below, I concluded that the timeline of events were missed by some viewers and that some were expecting a more tightly woven ending. I will address the former, but the latter is more like real life, composed of loose ends and no clear answers. I will refrain from giving away the plot twists, preferring to allow the viewer to enjoy the unfolding plot.To clarify, the narrative timeline is important and the questions the story raises are still relevant.  The male lead, Michael meets Winslet's character Hannah first in 1958, AFTER the war.  Whatever she did in the war is part of her past when they have their affair. He would have been a small child in the war, he is fifteen when they meet, and in his early 20s in law school. Her sudden disappearances and many of her choices are dictated by a personal secret that has dire consequences later, when Michael, now a law student, sees her again in a courtroom.The viewer must understand that post war Germany felt, and still feels shame over the Holocaust and faced serious challenges when it was over and the nation had to answer for crimes against humanity. It's difficult to say what any of us would do in the same circumstances.  We were not there. Would a person be swept along?  Would they rationalize?  Would they act in fear? In habitual obedience?  What role does ignorance play?  Can someone who is capable of great kindness, even tenderness, also be capable of evil, of knowing unthinking cruelty? Does one act nullify the other? What is the punishment when a whole nation is held in thrall? It's all easy to answer from a point of safety and security.Watch the film for Winslet and Kross, who are astounding in the lead roles, watch it for the lessons it offers and the questions it asks.

Kate Winslet has gainedsome overdue statuary, and a well deserved fifth Oscar nomination, and finally a highly deserved Oscar.Act 1 opens with The Innocent yet Illicit Love Affair, an act of kindness to a 15 year old boy caught out sick in the storm. It helps to know in advance that it happens after the second world war.The love scenes are candid and authentic, and for a while, we feel we can empathise with her. For the boy David, it's a sexual awakening that will direct his life. He expands her imagination by reading her the classics. Her passion and initial kindness is tempered by a perplexing coldness. It ends with her unannounced disappearance.Act 2, The Trial, contains the meat of the story, explores the worst aspects of human behavior. Her coldness now becomes understood in the light of new and incriminating information, quite an inhuman portrait. Yet a new perplexity emerges, her seeming unwillingness to save herself. Here we have the crucial decisions made by her and her former lover. Will she help herself? Will Michael help her?Act 3: The Aftermath.On an emotional level, it is an exploration of fear, guilt and shame, and the consequences when we act out of these emotions.On a more personal level is the question, what would we do?There is a quotation by George Santayana: Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I must mention David Kross as the young Michael, a very promising performance from this actor.

1228869,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B001PPLJIQ,Marc Cabir Davis,"[1, 2]","""The Reader"" isn't exceptional only for Kate Winslets' show-stopping performance (though I do rate her performance in 1999's underrated 'Hideous Kinky' better than this), but also for the fact that someone had the nerve to think up a story such as this. On the face of it, this is a slow, plodding film that bases itself entirely upon dialog and low-budget sets, but dig deeper and its a rich tapestry of interwoven storylines that span three eras.While other reviews may give you glimpses of the storyline, my review is to alert you to the fact that this is an 'adult' film, not because of the nudity, but because of the themes involved. Winslets' character Hannah is certifiably a villain, but one is left feeling rather sorry for her character. Then you remind yourself that the character is a dumb spoke in the wheel of mass genocide and you are rocked back to your senses.Especially telling is the court-martial segment, when it is clear that Hannah has no remorse over what shes done, simply because she does not consider it wrong. For her, life is just duty and honor to ones' employers, and she carries this rigid and horrifying attitude to her grave. However, there is also a softer side to her, where she likes classic literature read out to her, and she seems to enjoy nature and freedom. The movie seems to pose a very valid question and statement both at the same time - I bet intellectuals, especially Holocaust scholars have had numerous discussions about this films' subject matter, because it really makes you think.Ralph Fiennes was sort of the weak link here for me, as he seemed to be sleepwalking through his ill-written role. The script sagged in the second half, especially so in the all-so-important 'reunion' scene, which came and went without much fuss. Perhaps that was the intent. Either way, this is a film that starts off bursting with potential, but somehow along the way deflates into a rather mediocre statement on the lives of Post-Holocaust criminals.At the center is a lovely performance by Kate Winslet, who clearly has matured as an actress. The young lead (an 18 year old playing a 15 year old) deserves special mention. But this is very much an 'actress-driven' film, and if at all you have been interested in World War II, Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, and the 'final solution', this is the perfect film for you to indulge in even more reflection over that damned piece of human history.Certainly not a masterpiece, but a very, very solid piece of work. As far as I'm concerned there are only four feature films that could classify as Holocaust 'masterpieces':1. ""Schindler's List"" (Steven Spielberg)2. ""Holocaust"" (3-Hour TV Movie starring Meryl Streep, out now on DVD)3. ""Shoah"" (The Definitive Holocaust Documentary, 11 hours long, and out of print on DVD)4.

1228870,A1JLH6T4WAOPHY,B001PPLJIQ,Marc Musnick,"[1, 2]","Surprisingly some of Amazon's synopsis is incorrect.  The book and film's main character is Michael Berg who at 15 in 1958, begins a summer affair with Hannah Schmitz, a woman twice his age.  There are so many layers of mystery to this story that I don't want to ruin it for anyone who has still not seen the film or read the book.  So I'll glide a bit over the story.  After Michael's heart is broken by Hannah's sudden disappearance, which is another mystery of the story, years pass, and Michael at 22 is studying law.  He is in a special seminar of law students studying German guilt over the Holocaust, taught by a professor who is concentration camp survivor.  They attend a war crimes trial where a group of women are accused of participating in a horrendous act.  As the names of the accused are read aloud, Michael is stunned when he hears the name of Hannah Schmitz.What follows is a heartbreaking journey of love lost, conflicts of morality, non-redemption and how sometimes the expression sadder but wiser is an inadequate way of describing the end of an affair.I was profoundly moved by this film and was very surprised by the mixed reviews it received.  Those critics who were negative to the film, just didn't get it.  Kate Winslet's amazing performance alone would be a reason to see the film.  The most neglected performance of the film was given by David Kross who plays the 15 and 22 year old Michael.  I was amazed to read that this young man was only 17 when he made the film.

1228875,A36EW68H08UOCS,B001PPLJIQ,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 5]","Kate Winslet won the Academy Award for Best Actress for ""The Reader,"" and the film was nominated as well for Best Picture, Director, Cinematography and Adapted Screenplay.The film is beautiful and touching, brutal and distressing.  It raises issues that range from uncomfortable to horrific, but it does so with an even-handed view.The story begins in 1960 Germany.  David Kross plays Michael Berg starting at age 15.  He contracts scarlet fever and becomes ill trying to make his way home.  A kind and practical woman helps Michael get home, first washing away his vomit outside her door.It takes several weeks for Michael to recover, but once he does, he returns to thank the woman.  Her name is Hanna Schmitz and, although twice as old as Michael, she is still beautiful.  She awakens sexual feelings in the teenager.He makes a few awkward teenaged attempts at courtship.  When she realizes his actual intention, she offers herself frankly and sexually, but not romantically or intimately.  These scenes include a significant amount of nudity on the part of both Kross and Winslet, and it would not be a stretch to say that Hanna crosses a boundary of propriety.  But Hanna also has Michael read to her.  He reads ""The Odyssey"" and ""Huckleberry Finn"". Comically, she scolds him for reading ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" to her while they are in a bathtub.Hanna is a toll-taker on the trolley.  Their affair lasts through the summer and Michael's 16th birthday.  Hanna receives a promotion, a desk job, with the transportation company, and abruptly packs her things and leaves.Michael does not see her again until eight years later, when he is a law student.  As a part of his training Michael goes with his classmates and professor to a war crimes trial.  There Michael is stunned to see Hanna again.  She is on trial as one of the chief female guards at Auschwitz.A film that initially seems almost soft-porn becomes a film about people who do nothing, or even willingly participate, when an evil as great as Hitler's final solution appears in their society.  Hanna was not Hitler, or even one of the senior Nazis.  In her testimony, she makes it sound as if working with the SS was only a job.  In a fine scene Winslet passionately asks the court ""what would YOU have done"" and this scene made me ponder this question in a way that a hundred previous films or documentaries had not.Michael discovers a key piece of information during the trial.  While not exonerating Hanna, it may mitigate her sentence by almost 20 years.  He is torn.  Hanna also has the same information, but she is not using it to save herself.  Should Michael?Ralph Fiennes plays the adult Michael, and with every gesture he shows that Michael has been tormented by the experience.  In the final scene Fiennes comes to New York to meet a woman who survived Auschwitz and was one of the key witnesses in Hanna's trial.  The woman, played by Lena Olin, is appropriately suspicious of Michael and his motives.  In this scene we find neither absolution for Hanna or relief for Michael's torment.  But we do find a modicum of understanding, and common ground.  In a world with so many diverse cultures and opinions, finding even that seems a significant accomplishment.",5,Could you fall in love with a monster?,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,3237,"['Kate', 'Winslet', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Reader', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'as', 'well', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Cinematography', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'brutal', 'distressing', 'issues', 'range', 'uncomfortable', 'horrific', 'so', 'even-handed', 'view.The', 'story', '1960', 'Germany', 'David', 'Kross', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'starting', 'age', '15', 'contracts', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'becomes', 'ill', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'home', 'kind', 'practical', 'woman', 'Michael', 'get', 'home', 'first', 'washing', 'away', 'vomit', 'door.It', 'several', 'weeks', 'Michael', 'recover', 'once', 'thank', 'woman', 'name', 'Hanna', 'Schmitz', 'twice', 'as', 'old', 'Michael', 'still', 'beautiful', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'teenager.He', 'few', 'awkward', 'teenaged', 'attempts', 'courtship', 'When', 'actual', 'intention', 'frankly', 'sexually', 'not', 'romantically', 'intimately', 'scenes', 'include', 'significant', 'amount', 'nudity', 'part', 'Kross', 'Winslet', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'stretch', 'say', 'Hanna', 'boundary', 'propriety', 'Hanna', 'also', 'Michael', 'read', 'Odyssey', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'Comically', 'scolds', 'reading', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'Lover', 'are', 'bathtub.Hanna', 'toll-taker', 'trolley', 'affair', 'summer', 'Michael', '16th', 'birthday', 'Hanna', 'promotion', 'desk', 'job', 'transportation', 'company', 'abruptly', 'things', 'leaves.Michael', 'not', 'see', 'again', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'law', 'student', 'part', 'training', 'Michael', 'classmates', 'professor', 'war', 'trial', 'Michael', 'stunned', 'see', 'Hanna', 'again', 'trial', 'one', 'chief', 'female', 'guards', 'Auschwitz.A', 'film', 'initially', 'almost', 'soft-porn', 'becomes', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'even', 'willingly', 'participate', 'when', 'evil', 'as', 'great', 'Hitler', 'final', 'solution', 'society', 'Hanna', 'was', 'not', 'Hitler', 'even', 'one', 'senior', 'Nazis', 'testimony', 'sound', 'working', 'SS', 'was', 'only', 'job', 'fine', 'scene', 'Winslet', 'passionately', 'court', 'what', 'would', 'YOU', 'have', 'done', 'scene', 'made', 'ponder', 'question', 'way', 'hundred', 'previous', 'films', 'documentaries', 'had', 'not.Michael', 'discovers', 'key', 'piece', 'information', 'trial', 'not', 'exonerating', 'Hanna', 'may', 'mitigate', 'sentence', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'torn', 'Hanna', 'also', 'same', 'information', 'not', 'using', 'save', 'Should', 'Michael', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'adult', 'Michael', 'gesture', 'Michael', 'been', 'tormented', 'experience', 'final', 'scene', 'Fiennes', 'New', 'York', 'meet', 'woman', 'who', 'survived', 'Auschwitz', 'was', 'one', 'key', 'witnesses', 'Hanna', 'trial', 'woman', 'played', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'appropriately', 'suspicious', 'Michael', 'motives', 'scene', 'find', 'absolution', 'Hanna', 'relief', 'Michael', 'torment', 'do', 'find', 'modicum', 'understanding', 'common', 'ground', 'world', 'so', 'many', 'diverse', 'cultures', 'opinions', 'finding', 'even', 'significant', 'accomplishment']",N/A
1228876,A30TW9R3R0NODW,B001PPLJIQ,Mark Kittell,"[56, 70]","It takes a while to figure out what exactly ""The Reader"" is about. Teenage boy by chance meets older woman who apparently has no existence outside of work. At first they have sex, and after the third go-round get around to finding out what each other's name is. Then she wants him to read to her. So life goes as follows: Sex and reading, then reading and sex.  Only he does all the reading. She is also a bit touchy and self-conscious, for reasons beyond the boy's understanding, and causes him pain. He loves her, but why? The only thing they share is sex and books, and then there is the age difference.Then one day she inexplicably disappears. The next time we see her she is in a courtroom, being charged as a Nazi war criminal. He is part of a law school seminar, ostensibly to study the psychology of mass murder. At a crucial moment he is in a position to help her, but at the last moment turns away. Why? But then again, he is distant from family, friends, his own daughter. Why?One day he finds books that he had once read to her, and decides to spend hours of his free time making cassette recordings which he mails to her while she is prison, without informing her prior. Why? He never visits her. Why? She learns to write brief notes which she mails to him, but he never responds in spite of her entreaties. Why? When he finally visits her when summoned, as her only known contact, to help her adjust to the world on her release, he reacts rather chillily to her obvious delight in seeing him. Why? If he has gone so far out of his way to ease her prison existence, why should he be disappointed in her now?The subtext of the film is ""How far would you go to protect a secret?"" Hanna Schmitz's secret is that she was illiterate. Even for her life she will not reveal that secret. Michael Berg's seems to be that he knows Hanna, but not because of her illiteracy. He never tells anyone--family, friends, anyone until the end--that he knows Hanna, even before he discovers her other past. Strangely, we are given to believe that Hanna's motives are much easier to understand than Michael's.Not that Hanna deserves our sympathy, or even understanding. Hanna is never bothered by her conscience; she has none. She has a job to do, and she does it by the book--whether it is collecting tram fair or insuring death camp prisoners do not escape from a burning building. Coins or human beings--these are just objects she must collect and distribute. When they  meet for a final time at the end, Michael wants to know what she has ""learned"" from the past. ""The dead are still dead"" she says. To her the past is past, and should remain in the past. Michael, perhaps to clear his own guilt in even knowing this woman, wants her to say that she knew what she did was wrong, and regrets it. But being the blunt person she is, she can only tell him the truth, which is to say she was only doing her job, and she feels no guilt over that. The seminar professor was wrong: not everyone who kills another human being is aware that it is wrong. Hanna's final ""will"" can only be understood in the context of her realization that her relationship with Michael was dead because she was incapable of moral reflection.The end of the film is supposed to provide ""catharsis,"" but there is really none honestly to be had. Michael realizes that he had helped Hanna find some meaning in her life, but his clear disappointment with her at their last meeting rendered it now meaningless to her. But what of that?  Many ""civilized"" Germans committed mass murder, even those who appreciated classic literature. The film seeks to force us to empathize with Hanna, just as it forces Michael to realize how ""wrong"" he was in his ""ill"" treatment of Hanna.This film actually had forty percent negative reviews, despite its Oscar pedigree. I don't fault the actors, they can only work with what they are given. The biggest problem is that there is very little in the way of exposition. The actors are given surprisingly little useful to say; all too often we have to ""read"" their thoughts and expressions to understand what's going on.  Kate Winslet as Hanna does an admirable job of giving us less to guess about; during the trial sequence, we don't need to hear her words to see that she simply doesn't understand what she did wrong.  One can credit Winslet with giving an Oscar-worthy effort, but nevertheless there seems just too many plot holes for her to fill by herself.David Kross does well enough as the young Michael, but again there are just too many potholes in the story line for him to successfully emote through. What is so empty about his life that he needs to have it filled by a woman twenty years his senior when there are other girls his age who are much more attractive--and who are more interested in him? It can't be sex, because they seem willing enough, and Hanna seems disinterested in him outside the sex and reading, a recipe for a relationship that is headed straight for a dead-end (in spite of declarations of love on his part). The sex scenes themselves are fairly brief and tame; the deleted scenes include the NC-17 material. As the older Michael, Ralph Fiennes is given even less to do, and he comes off the worse for wear.Given the quality of the deleted scenes, I think a ""director's cut"" or ""unrated"" version of this film would come off better. The deleted scene in which the young Michael hitchhikes with a former soldier who reveals the blas&eacute; mentality of many Germans who murdered Jews was quite effective and would have cleared-up in a major way both the young and older Michael's changing attitude toward Hanna. Inclusion of the sex scenes would have made the younger Michael's incomprehensible fascination with Hanna more believable, and several other scenes would have made plot transitions and character motivations more comprehensible. The film would have been longer, but sometimes plot confusion makes a film seem longer than it actually is.The Reader is not a film to be dismissed out-of-hand, if only for Winslet's performance. But this is a film that requires the viewer work harder than he or she needs to.

It was none of these. Maybe all the hype affected my expectations of the movie, but I thought it was pretty lame.When I described Kate Winslet's character as ""a zombie,"" my husband asked, ""Was she a real zombie, or are you just saying that?"" Actually, had she portrayed a ""real"" zombie, the movie at least would have had that element of suspense: when is she going to rip Michael to shreds and eat his brains? But nothing like that happened.The sex scenes were awkward and not very compelling (seduction, German-style: have someone stand naked in a tub and rub them raw with a loofah. Whoa, that's a turn-on!) I thought the movie would use the relationship between Hanna and Michael to set up a lot of soul-searching about the nature of evil, culpability, the complexity of human relationships....but even though strands of the plot moved in those directions, there was no follow-through.All of the elements are here for a great novel, and I may one day read the book on which the movie was based. And despite what I've already written, the the actor who plays Michael (Matthias Habich) was really good.

She really can disappear into a character.  In this movie, you just see Hanna Schmitz and not the incredibly talented actress playing her.***spoilers***The first aspect about the movie is the love story.  It's done with great sensitivity and tenderness (and eroticism).  I did not find it distasteful (although I'm a guy and the idea of being welcomed into a attractive older woman's bed at the age of 15 would have been the stuff of my dreams...at least when I was at that age...and besides David Cross looked older than 15).  Also, the book points out that Hanna misjudged Michael's age (thinking him 17 and the age of consent laws in Germany don't outright ban contact between a 35 year old woman and 15 year old male anyway).  I remember someone I knew who was in his late teens who was involved with a much older woman and while I thought that rather odd, it didn't come across as monstrous (although I admit I find the notion of any man in his mid-30s seducing a 15 year old girl appalling).The second aspect of the story is the question of Hanna's guilt for what she did in World War II.  She was a guard at Auschwitz.  On a weekly basis, she picked ten inmates there to be sent to the gas chamber in response to a standing requirement that she do so (some of them were women she gave preferential treatment to for a time while she had them read to her).  She also was partially responsible for deaths of hundreds of women and children who died when the church that the SS women locked them in was hit by Allied bombers.  These facts are indisputable, so she's evil and beyond redemption, right?But what would someone plunked from our safe secure perch in the early 21st century into Nazi Germany do in someone like Hanna's shoes?  It's easy to say ""I would never have joined the SS, and if I had, I wouldn't have served as a guard at Auschwitz.  And I would have released those women and children in the church.""  But I wonder.  We shouldn't be that surprised that a relatively unsophisticated, illiterate person living in a society like Nazi Germany where life was so cheap and obedience so prized behaved the way Hanna did (and besides joining the SS in late 1943 when a lot of Germans could clearly see the handwriting on the wall was not a shrewd or opportunistic move or the mark of an ardent Nazi!).  There's a world of difference between someone like her (who was a child when the Third Reich took power) and someone like Rudolph Hoess, the first commandant of Auschwitz, who was an ardent Nazi and with Hitler almost from the very beginning.It's entirely plausible that someone like Hanna was --in a normal society where there is rule of law-- a ""good"" person, and she apparently was after the war.  It's hardly wrong for the film to depict her as someone capable of love and tenderness.  Many Nazis were thugs or sadists but Hanna was not (in fact the movie didn't even indicate she was a member of the Nazi Party or held anti-semitic views).  She was just a little cog in an evil machine.  Demanding that anyone who was part of that inhuman machine be depicted as someone with horns is simplistic.The character of Michael Berg is somewhat inexplicable, and this is why I am giving the film only four stars.  He falls head over heels in love with Hanna as a youth.  He's devastated by her departure from his life.  He's heartbroken when he sees her in the dock on trial for war crimes.  But he doesn't act to help her by revealing the fact she's illiterate and couldn't have written the report about the fire that damns her to a life sentence.  Was he sparing her feelings, punishing her, or both? (if I had been in his shoes I would have revealed her secret to the court...She might have hated me for it, but she probably would have gotten to learn to read and write much earlier than she did and would have gotten out of jail much sooner).  Frankly, I found Michael remaining silent bewildering (particularly when we see him crying when she gets a life sentence)...just like I found him recording all those books for her but never writing and actually communicating with her impossible to understand.There are a few more points to ponder here.  First, it is striking how little we the readers wind up knowing about Hanna.  Even at the end of the movie, she's still a cipher to both us and Michael.  Even in what amounted to her last will and testament where one might have expected her to pour out her feelings to Michael and talk about what she did in the war, she doesn't (just saying ""Tell Michael Berg I said hello."")  I for one found myself wanting to know more about her and why she did what she did and why she --apparently impulsively-- became involved with Michael.Second, it was a mistake to have Winslet play Hanna as a woman in her mid-60s.  No matter how good the make-up and how good an actress Winslet is, I didn't buy her as a prematurely aged woman.  That's one reason why having her in prison less time would have worked better...because she was plausible as someone in her late 40s to early 50s but not much beyond that.Third, the movie and book seem to construe the incident where Hanna didn't let the prisoners out of the burning church as her greatest sin.  But what would someone nowadays have been charged with in similar circumstances (let's say, a sheriff fails to release prisoners from a burning jail)?  He'd be guilty of a crime of omission.  He'd probably be found guilty of manslaughter or negligent homicide and not willful murder unless it could be proved that he set fire to the jail or announced that he was going to let those prisoners burn to death.  A lot of people in such a situation would have gone into moral vapor lock and found it easier --at least at that moment-- to do nothing.And remember, she was just one of six guards.  The other five could have acted to save those people as well but didn't.  The book also makes it clear that there were soldiers present who had escorted the guards with their charges.  They did nothing either.  Moreover, there were villagers who did nothing as well.  The guilt and responsibility for the incident was collective and involved many people.  Singling out Hanna for exceptional punishment while others walked free or got token sentences wasn't fair and not in the interest of justice...and it wouldn't have brought anyone back from the dead.Yet another point to ponder:  the story had Hanna serving about 18 or 19 years in prison.  Albert Speer, the economic czar of the Third Reich, served twenty years of his life sentence before being released.  The duration of those sentences would make one think that Speer and the fictional Hanna's crimes were roughly equivalent in magnitude...but as anyone knows, Speer's culpability and guilt was infinitely greater.Finally, I said to myself, ""You don't like the ending of the book and movie.  What sort of ending would have been satisfactory to you and possibly other people as well?""  This is what I came up with***the following is an alternative ending that substantially changes events as depicted in the book and movie and those who are happy with the way it stands probably should not read it***A Better EndingPart I would not change.  In Part II, Michael would visit Hanna in jail and express disbelief, anger, and dismay over both her past and her leaving him.  Michael would still go through all the angst that he did in this point of the narrative, but when he realized Hanna was illiterate and it would be wrong for her to be assigned the lion's share of blame for the deaths at the church, he would go to the judge --despite her pleading with him not to-- and tell him that Hanna could not read or write and could not have written the report about the incident.  As a result, Hanna would draw a ten year sentence along with the other women guards (instead of her getting a life sentence while the others got token ones).Now, Hanna's first reaction to Michael's ""betrayal"" of her secret would be shame and anger at him.  We'd see her refusing to let him visit her.  Michael would try to forget about her, getting married and even more quickly divorced.  Michael would then start reading and recording books for Hanna and eventually she'd learn to read and write and when she started sending him letters...after some hesitation, he would start writing back to her (this correspondence would allow us to learn more about her character).  One thing we would learn was that she became involved with Michael because he bore a strong resemblance to a young German soldier she grew up with and loved and who died in the war....We'd also see her develop insight and regret over what she did and failed to do in the war.Time would march on, and after the sixth year or so of her sentence, Michael would begin visiting her and around the eighth or ninth year of her sentence, Hanna would receive clemency and be released from prison.  Michael would pick her up at the prison and when they were in the car together, she'd ask --much like he asked her long before-- ""do you forgive me? and he'd nod imperceptibly and then ""do you love me?"" and he'd again nod.  Later, we'd see them in bed together at his home and in another turn, Michael would have her read to him.I figure that we'd then flash forward until around 2004 or 2005 (and learn that Hanna had died of natural causes a year or so before) with Michael visiting the survivor of the fire and having much the same conversation with that woman that he did in the book and the movie, and we'd then see Michael visiting Hanna's grave and once again read to her.For me that would make a better ending.  Hanna would still wind up being held to account but she and Michael would be together at the end...for others perhaps not, but that's one of the best things about fiction.  It isn't real so there's no sin in saying, ""No, it happened this way.""",4,Thought Provoking and Poignant but Would Have Preferred a Better End,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,9997,"['did', ""n't"",

Through flashbacks, the viewer learns of his maturation process, beginning in his mid-teens when caught in the throes of age appropriate hormonal insurrection the onset of a bout of scarlet fever renders him incapacitated on the doorstep of public transport worker, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). Understandably smitten with the attractive but appreciably older woman, it is no surprise when he clumsily but enthusiastically acquiesces to her sexual advances.As this segment processes, we learn a great deal more about Berg and the familial dynamics that have contributed to his development while Schmitz remains very much the enigma, compassionate but aloof, intensely private yet undeniably psychologically (and physiologically) needy.  She revels in being read to, with content or context seemingly irrelevant. Their relationship suffuses an aura of incongruent equality but rationality always forces the viewer to understand there is very little likelihood it could ever be sustainable and a deserved yet unacceptable promotion at work for Hanna proves to serve as the catalyst for the dissolution of her interactions with Michael, and she simply vanishes.Eight years later, Michael now a law school student participating in a seminar on ethics attends a war crimes trial and is shocked to discover his past infatuation on trial as part of group of women for crimes allegedly committed as concentration camp prison guards. He finds himself confronted by a spectrum of feelings, shocked to discover the secret for decades Hanna had shared with no one and also commensurately conflicted as he realizes out of recalcitrance she would rather wholly submit to the vagaries of legal system and the duplicity of her co-defendants than openly acknowledge her personal guilt and shame.Winslet clothed or not (but with the understanding as far as sexiness is concerned for this year's crop Marisa Tomei is in pole position), is mesmerizing as the complicated former prison guard as she is aged over a course of thirty years or more and is convincing at each epoch. She pulls off a German accent that seems completely unforced and tends to elicit empathy for a persona that very easily could have been construed as an abomination. David Kross as the youthful Michael Berg is nearly as impressive most especially throughout a group of sex scenes that I have to believe would turn most 18 year-olds the complexion of Hellboy. Fiennes is...well he's Ralph Fiennes which is not intended to infer a negative connotation but his typical thespian retentiveness is clearly on display here.The Reader is a very good film, one that highlights a multitude of moral/ethical questions, not necessarily new or revelatory, but questions that consistently reappear and are forever worthy of investigation.",4,I feel for you,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,3150,"['Reader', 'one', 'films', 'seem', 'attempt', 'examine', 'expansive', 'range', 'moral', 'ethical', 'values', 'variable', 'levels', 'success', 'story', 'introduction', 'middle-aged', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'professionally', 'prosperous', 'successful', 'barrister', 'who', 'also', 'convey', 'image', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'personal', 'vacuity', 'flashbacks', 'viewer', 'learns', 'maturation', 'process', 'beginning', 'mid-teens', 'when', 'caught', 'throes', 'age', 'appropriate', 'hormonal', 'insurrection', 'onset', 'bout', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'incapacitated', 'doorstep', 'public', 'transport', 'worker', 'Hanna', 'Schmitz', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Understandably', 'smitten', 'attractive', 'appreciably', 'older', 'woman', 'surprise', 'when', 'clumsily', 'enthusiastically', 'acquiesces', 'sexual', 'advances.As', 'segment', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'Berg', 'familial', 'dynamics', 'have', 'contributed', 'development', 'Schmitz', 'very', 'much', 'enigma', 'compassionate', 'aloof', 'intensely', 'private', 'yet', 'undeniably', 'psychologically', 'physiologically', 'needy', 'being', 'read', 'content', 'context', 'seemingly', 'irrelevant', 'relationship', 'aura', 'incongruent', 'equality', 'rationality', 'always', 'viewer', 'understand', 'very', 'little', 'likelihood', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'sustainable', 'deserved', 'yet', 'unacceptable', 'promotion', 'work', 'Hanna', 'serve', 'catalyst', 'dissolution', 'interactions', 'Michael', 'simply', 'vanishes.Eight', 'years', 'later', 'Michael', 'now', 'law', 'school', 'student', 'participating', 'seminar', 'ethics', 'war', 'trial', 'shocked', 'discover', 'past', 'infatuation', 'trial', 'part', 'group', 'women', 'crimes', 'allegedly', 'committed', 'concentration', 'camp', 'prison', 'guards', 'confronted', 'spectrum', 'feelings', 'shocked', 'discover', 'secret', 'decades', 'Hanna', 'had', 'shared', 'one', 'also', 'commensurately', 'conflicted', 'recalcitrance', 'would', 'rather', 'wholly', 'submit', 'vagaries', 'legal', 'system', 'duplicity', 'co-defendants', 'openly', 'acknowledge', 'personal', 'guilt', 'shame.Winslet', 'clothed', 'not', 'understanding', 'as', 'far', 'sexiness', 'concerned', 'year', 'crop', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'pole', 'position', 'mesmerizing', 'complicated', 'former', 'prison', 'guard', 'aged', 'course', 'thirty', 'years', 'more', 'convincing', 'epoch', 'German', 'accent', 'completely', 'unforced', 'elicit', 'empathy', 'persona', 'very', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'construed', 'abomination', 'David', 'Kross', 'youthful', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'nearly', 'as', 'impressive', 'most', 'especially', 'group', 'sex', 'scenes', 'have', 'believe', 'would', 'turn', 'most', '18', 'year-olds', 'complexion', 'Hellboy', 'Fiennes', 'well', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'not', 'intended', 'infer', 'negative', 'connotation', 'typical', 'thespian', 'retentiveness', 'clearly', 'display', 'here.The', 'Reader', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'multitude', 'moral/ethical', 'questions', 'not', 'necessarily', 'new', 'revelatory', 'questions', 'consistently', 'reappear', 'are', 'forever', 'worthy', 'investigation']",N/A
1228886,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B001PPLJIQ,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[29, 36]","The film:""The Reader"" deserved its Oscar for best actress, but it also deserved the Oscar for best film (it lost to the inferior ""Slumdog Millionaire."") It tells the tale of a young man growing up in post-war Germany who has an affair with a mysterious older woman. Without spoiling too much, the story ends up touching on the holocaust, how much we can blame participants, and whether or not love transcends these historical pains.Normally, I dislike holocaust films. I find that Hollywood too often beats us over the head with the ""it's BAD"" message (This Just In! Hollywood Geniuses Discover Holocaust Was Bad!) as opposed to mining the much more interesting tales of personal struggle, loss, redemption, and ignorance. ""The Reader"" offers an intelligent, probing, and insightful look at the human costs on those who were not direct victims, and on the society of post-war Germany at large. It also tells a heck of a love story, to boot.I felt so respected by the makers of this film. There is no heavy-handed moralizing, in fact, the message of the film seems to be that, while of course there are great moral wrongs that have been perpetrated, there are lesser consequences which do not make it into history books, but do have an impact on real people and deal them real pains that ought to be respected.As mentioned in other reviews, this is not a movie for the kids, at least not kids who still titter when they see nudity on screen. The first half of the film is consumed by a lusty affair between a 32 year old and a 15 year old. It's not for immature audiences.The Blu-Ray:On the opening scene, I thought this film must be shot on digital. The source was just too clean, with little to no film grain in evidence. Upon further research, however, I have discovered that it was indeed shot on Kodak Vision2 and Vision3 film - which Kodak advertises as producing less grain in low light and in general. Given this, and the fact that detail is generally so strong in this image, I can only assume that this Blu-Ray has been mastered without excessive Digital Noise Reduction.It is a lovely 1.85:1 image which suits nice widescreen displays beautifully. Black levels are strong, loads of detail is evident in shadows, and colors are extremely naturalistic. There are many moments that offer the sort of ""3-D"" realism that the best HD can give. The quality of the image adds immediacy and impact to the already involving film.Audio is very dialogue driven. This is not a BD that will rock your neighbors.Extras are very strong. 42 minutes (!) of deleted scenes are presented in 480p widescreen. I watched them all, and I would say only one cut was truly unfortunate - a little bit of backstory for Michael's law professor that would have added depth to the story. Mini-documentaries are also available, touching on the writing and casting process, as well as Kate Winslet's aging with make-up. Overall, it's a very strong slate of extras.*********Any fan of serious dramas and romances would do quite well to pick this up. It's a truly great movie that is very affecting and also thought provoking. It's a monument to respecting the viewer, allowing them to digest complex morality without beating them over the head with a ""message."" I would compare it to films like ""The English Patient"" or ""I've Loved You So Long"" (another 2008 Oscar Nominee).It is also presented in an exceedingly beautiful HD transfer and a strong package of extras. Certainly, if you're doing a survey of 2008 Oscar nominees, you should pick this up over the trite, pat Hollywood fare of ""Slumdog."" It's also better than the very good, but somewhat flabby ""Benjamin Button,"" and the excellent, but not as brainy ""Milk.""

Given that, I will focus my review on the cast and the outstanding performances.I got this movie believing that my favorite actor, Ralph Fiennes, would perform the parts of both young and older ""Michael"". The discovery of the young star David Kross shinning through as the young Michael only added to the uniqueness of this movie. While every movie Fiennes stars in exceeds my expectations, I'm grateful that Fiennes appearance wasn't prolonged because it gave space for other stars to shine as well.  Simply put, stars are not easily seen in the presence of the sun, and for Fiennes to accept such a small role adds to my certainty that he fell in love with the story and the cast.The movie is not only the story of an unusual love story between a young boy and an older woman, nor a repeated expose about war crimes. Rather, the movie is an unbiased and close observation of the human experience of good, evil, love, rage, loyalty, and unexplained ambivalence.Kate Winslet was born to play Hanna's role, a complex character that is torn between her guilt, morals, passion and insecurities. David Kross, in his first English role, is a talent way beyond his age; an unbelievable gifted young actor who still has so much to give.""The Reader"" is one of the best movies I`ve ever seen, great direction, production, and a well chosen cast (especially Bruno Ganz as professor Rohl who says :"" there is a difference between law and morality"").Ignore all the bad reviews accusing Winslet of abusing and corrupting young Michael.

Its that film that does get you to feel emotion but it dosen't stick with you and almost thirty minutes after the film ends, you lose all sense of what the film was trying to achieve. Its as if the film only meets you halfway and not give you the whole juggular that you seek.Michael is young man who, one day on his way home, becomes ill and is tended to by one of the tram conductors named Hanna. The two soon begin a passionate affair that last for one summer until she leaves mysteriously. Years later, as a law student, he encounters her again, this time on trial for crimes she commited when she was an officer at a Nazi concentration camp.As mentioned, the film is beautifully shot and each actor is good in their respected role, with David Kross and Ralph Fiennes acting as the young and old Michael and of course the always great Kate Winslet as Hanna. However, as much as I love Kate, I didn't think this film was 'Oscar material'. For me, she gave a better performance in Revolutionary Road and the only reason she won the award not for the performance but as a lifetime achievement award for all the times she was shafted by the Acadamy (she should have won for her role in Titanic).However, thats about where the positives end. I'm still not sure what exactly happen when translating the book to film version but it just did not do well. The entire film has this very cold feeling, as if it dosen't want you to feel too much and try as hard as the actors will, they also give off this feeling of coldness.As for all those Oscar noms this film picked up, it basically boils down to three things. 1. Pedigree (both Anthony Mingella and Sydney Pollack produced the film). 2. Material (its a Holocaust film, thats like Oscar gold!) and then 3. Kate Winslet (she is such Oscar bait that she is a force all her own).While The Reader strives to be great, it ultimatly falls short in many aspects. However, that may not be the case for me, others may love this film and think it is absolutly stunning, its just one of those films that shifts depending on the viewer.

The relationship only lasts over the course of a summer, but it is extremely intense and affects both Michael and Hanna deeply. Although the couple enjoy the time they spend in bed together, their connection is strongest when Michael reads aloud to Hanna. Abruptly, the affair comes to an end when Hanna suddenly leaves town without a word of explanation. Their paths cross again years later, when Michael's law school class sits in on a high-profile trial for German guard crimes against Jewish prisoners. Shockingly, Hanna appears as one of the defendants in the case, and it is revealed that she is a former member of the S.S. Years later, a grown Michael (Ralph Fiennes) still finds himself haunted by the memory of Hanna, and he reestablishes a connection with her.This is a fantastic film that features an extraordinary cast.

It tells a story of some unusual choices people make and the consequences they will have to face. I feel sorry for the ignorance of Hanna and the false attachment of young Michael to her. I feel angry and sad about Hanna's indifference to other people's suffering - she was probably already drowning in her own pain. It's frustrating to see the grown Michael carrying the burden of his memory with Hanna which affects his family.It's terribly wrong (if we don't talk about the law here) to take advantage of minors, whether it's a girl or a boy, by manipulation or physical force. Young people aren't given the same social power in a grown-up society, nor are they equipped with the wisdom to cope with being both emotionally and sexually overpowered. Not enough weight on this point in the movie.... maybe hinted in the brief screen time between Michael and his daughter, and his conversation with the holocaust servicer.I wonder why Hanna actually kills herself in the end - Is she ashamed of what she did, or because she is ashamed of how she looks in front of Michael?  The director put the camera mostly on the parts of when Hanna appears to be somewhat pitiful and distant.  But when I take a deeper look into what she has actually done, it's really hard to forgive her, despite of the possibility of her unfortunate childhood to cause her illiterate or some past abusive relationships with men which make her a control freak. However, a little bit of mercy can still be given to the sorriest souls....

Now, director Stephen Daldry's film of Bernhard Schlink's best-selling novel, THE READER, joins that short list.Kate Winslet won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar for her performance in that post-Holocaust drama, but as much as I enjoyed SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, I think that THE READER should have won Best Picture also.This is a story that presents the Holocaust's war criminals as ""human beings,"" not the two-dimensional villainous figures that have populated other films about this horrible, tragic era.  By showing these characters as real people, we can (hopefully) understand their behavior, as evil and unforgivable as it might be.I'm not in any way suggesting that Winslet's acts should not be punished.  What she did was despicable.  Yet, you cannot put her in the same category as, say Hilter or even the Ralph Fiennes character in SCHINDLER'S LIST.  They were truly evil people who knew exactly what they were doing.It's no excuse, but Winslet's character committed her terrible acts out of, for lack of a better word, stupidity.Winslet plays Hannah, a woman who has a passionate summer affair with a much younger man, Michael (played at different ages by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes).After she suddenly disappears, Michael is confused, then she resurfaces years later as one of the defendants in a war crimes trial stemming from her actions as a concentration camp guard.Incidentally, the tears that I shed in this film were for Michael, not Hannah.The DVD from The Weinstein Company and Genius Products contains eleven deleted scenes, in-depth interviews/conversations with Daldry, Kross and Winslet, plus several other ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

The heart of the film is the fact that she's illiterate and he reads to her; later, in prison she even learns to read herself. The actors are fine (though the present-day scenes with Ralph Fiennes as the boy grown up are stilted) and the score by Nico Muhly is strong, but it's a strange, strange film to say the least. The message seems to be that even war criminals need love. Or perhaps that illiteracy is sad, even if it's a Nazi who can't do it. (She may not actually be a Nazi but she was a prison guard and oversaw atrocities because she was so focused on following orders.) Truly, there is no scene in the film where Kate Winslet's character has learned to read and thus, perhaps, learned to see the world from the point of view of others. And I don't understand why there isn't. Surely that's the whole point of her learning to read -- that she might come to some self-awareness or sense of recognition for what she had done. But no.

1228900,A1N10AC8OCR4EV,B001PPLJIQ,"Michael ""Michael""","[35, 51]","I hope that all those who give this film a positive review would be equally enthusiastic about the story of an ex-SS soldier and his repeated statutory rape and subsequent desertion of a 15 year old girl.  Western society's pseudo-equality, presented in its most exaggerated form in Hollywood, states that the crimes of women, especially the good-looking ones, are to be forgiven and are nowhere near as bad as the identical crimes committed by men.  This is because women have feelings, even war criminals involved in genocide, while men are creatures devoid of them and deserve their full punishment.Throughout the film, Winslet's character shows not the slightest sign of remorse that she helped burn people alive, and merely tries to give excuses.  At one point, she asks the ridiculous question to the judge 'What would you have done?'.  This from a woman who volunteered for the SS to work in concentration camps, which only the mentally challenged could have had any doubts about even during the war.  Yes, say that to one of the German Wehrmacht's poor conscripts who were uprooted from family and home for military service, or faced a concentration camp for draft-dodging.  But please don't say that about someone who as a woman could have spent the war sitting pretty in her factory job, but chose to make extra money by working at Auschwitz.Apart from showing not the slightest sign of remorse for her part in the Holocaust, she has the audacity to commit child abuse on a 15 year old child, using him for her selfish ends and then dumping him when she'd had enough.  What he sees in the miserable, unloving, haggard woman is beyond comprehension.  But would fans of this film watch an equally well-made film of the repeated statutory rape of a girl with equal enthusiasm?  Or has Hollywood's gender fascism really blunted the intellects and moral sensibilities of so many?Should we really feel sorry for her excessive sentence for not admitting she couldn't write?  Certainly not.  We should see it as an example of the damaging effects of having an ego so massive, of being so swollen-headed and vain that one would rather get life imprisonment than admit one's failures. Pathetic. (But then again, this could never have happened in reality. Every SS applicant had a mountain of papers and forms to fill in and illiterates then wouldn't have got much further than your average applicant for the police force today.  More Hollywood fantasy.)The woman was lucky she wasn't prosecuted directly after the war when war criminals were still executed, which is what she definitely deserved.  Instead, she got away with life imprisonment, something the 600 poor women she enjoyed burning alive would have done anything for.  Kate Winslet and her young co-star do a good job playing these roles, no question.  But this film is fundamentally, morally flawed, and is not only hated by all Holocaust survivors for good reason.  It's increasingly hated by those who see the perversion of justice that results when we say that murder and child abuse committed by a woman are not as as bad as the identical crimes committed by a man.PS: I hope all those who liked this film are supporting ex-SS guard John Demanjuk. Looking at people's reactions to his story compared with Winslet's is the perfect way of assessing the level of gender fascism in our society. He is a Ukrainian facing life imprisonment for working just 6 months at Sobibor extermination camp. Not only did he work for a much shorter time than Winslet's character, but his country was under occupation and he would never have been in that job if the Germans hadn't invaded his country. Compare him with Winslet's character, who is a German who volunteers to be an SS guard for more money. Why doesn't John Demanjuk get as much support from those who feel sympathy for Winslet? (1) Most importantly, because he's a man. (2) He's old and unattractive. (3) The people assessing him aren't influenced by years of gender fascism and pseudoequality emanating from western feminist organizations that have led people to believe in the inherent evilness of men and goodness of women.",2,The sick result of Gender Fascism - a kick in the teeth for all Holocaust victims,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,4138,"['hope', 'who', 'give', 'film', 'positive', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'enthusiastic', 'story', 'ex-SS', 'soldier', 'repeated', 'statutory', 'rape', 'subsequent', 'desertion', '15', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Western', 'society', 'pseudo-equality', 'presented', 'most', 'exaggerated', 'form', 'Hollywood', 'crimes', 'women', 'especially', 'good-looking', 'ones', 'are', 'be', 'forgiven', 'are', 'nowhere', 'as', 'bad', 'identical', 'crimes', 'committed', 'men', 'women', 'have', 'feelings', 'even', 'war', 'criminals', 'involved', 'genocide', 'men', 'are', 'creatures', 'devoid', 'deserve', 'full', 'film', 'Winslet', 'character', 'not', 'slightest', 'sign', 'remorse', 'helped', 'burn', 'people', 'alive', 'merely', 'tries', 'give', 'excuses', 'one', 'point', 'ridiculous', 'question', 'judge', ""'What"", 'would', 'have', 'done', 'woman', 'who', 'volunteered', 'SS', 'work', 'concentration', 'camps', 'only', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'doubts', 'even', 'war', 'Yes', 'say', 'one', 'German', 'Wehrmacht', 'poor', 'conscripts', 'who', 'were', 'uprooted', 'family', 'home', 'military', 'service', 'faced', 'concentration', 'camp', 'draft-dodging', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'someone', 'who', 'woman', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'war', 'sitting', 'pretty', 'factory', 'job', 'chose', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'working', 'Auschwitz.Apart', 'showing', 'not', 'slightest', 'sign', 'remorse', 'part', 'Holocaust', 'audacity', 'commit', 'child', 'abuse', '15', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'using', 'selfish', 'ends', 'then', 'dumping', 'when', ""'d"", 'had', 'enough', 'What', 'miserable', 'unloving', 'haggard', 'woman', 'comprehension', 'would', 'fans', 'film', 'watch', 'equally', 'well-made', 'film', 'repeated', 'statutory', 'rape', 'girl', 'equal', 'enthusiasm', 'Hollywood', 'gender', 'fascism', 'really', 'blunted', 'intellects', 'moral', 'sensibilities', 'so', 'many', 'Should', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'excessive', 'sentence', 'not', 'admitting', 'could', ""n't"", 'write', 'Certainly', 'not', 'should', 'see', 'example', 'damaging', 'effects', 'having', 'ego', 'so', 'massive', 'being', 'so', 'swollen-headed', 'vain', 'one', 'would', 'rather', 'get', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'admit', 'one', 'failures', 'Pathetic', 'then', 'again', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'reality', 'SS', 'applicant', 'had', 'mountain', 'papers', 'forms', 'fill', 'illiterates', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'got', 'much', 'further', 'average', 'applicant', 'police', 'force', 'today', 'More', 'Hollywood', 'fantasy', 'woman', 'was', 'lucky', 'was', ""n't"", 'prosecuted', 'directly', 'war', 'when', 'war', 'criminals', 'were', 'still', 'executed', 'what', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'Instead', 'got', 'away', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'something', '600', 'poor', 'women', 'enjoyed', 'burning', 'alive', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'anything', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'young', 'co-star', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'roles', 'question', 'film', 'fundamentally', 'morally', 'flawed', 'not', 'only', 'hated', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'good', 'reason', 'increasingly', 'hated', 'who', 'see', 'perversion', 'justice', 'results', 'when', 'say', 'murder', 'child', 'abuse', 'committed', 'woman', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'identical', 'crimes', 'committed', 'man.PS', 'hope', 'who', 'liked', 'film', 'are', 'supporting', 'ex-SS', 'guard', 'John', 'Demanjuk', 'Looking', 'people', 'reactions', 'story', 'compared', 'Winslet', 'perfect', 'way', 'assessing', 'level', 'gender', 'fascism', 'society', 'Ukrainian', 'facing', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'working', 'just', '6', 'months', 'Sobibor', 'extermination', 'camp', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'work', 'much', 'shorter', 'time', 'Winslet', 'character', 'country', 'was', 'occupation', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'job', 'Germans', 'had', ""n't"", 'invaded', 'country', 'Compare', 'Winslet', 'character', 'who', 'German', 'who', 'be', 'SS', 'guard', 'more', 'money', 'Why', ""n't"", 'John', 'Demanjuk', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'support', 'who', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Winslet', '1', 'Most', 'importantly', 'man', '2', 'old', 'unattractive', '3', 'people', 'assessing', 'are', ""n't"", 'influenced', 'years', 'gender', 'fascism', 'pseudoequality', 'emanating', 'western', 'feminist', 'organizations', 'have', 'led', 'people', 'believe', 'inherent', 'evilness', 'men', 'goodness', 'women']",N/A

He does so through the experiences of Michael Berg (David Kross), who, as a teenager in 1958, had an affair with a woman 20 years his senior, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). Years later, when he is at law school, Michael finds that Hanna is a defendant in a war crimes case. She is charged with the murders of hundreds of prisoners who died in a burning building when she was a guard at a concentration camp. Decades later, when Michael (Ralphes Fiennes) is middle-aged, he still has trouble assessing how much guilt to assign Hanna and by this time is carrying around some guilt of his own.It's probably impossible to write any opinion or lack of opinion about the events of World War II in Germany without stirring controversy. But, in the rest of the world, people interpret these stories as morality plays that can be applied to a broader context. ""The Reader"" was a bestseller in the United States. The movie has a great cast and an interesting story, but it may owe its critical success to the fact that it lends itself to being interpreted differently by different people. The question of whether people should be condemned for doing what most people would do under the circumstances, that was acceptable behavior at the time, remains a sticky issue in Germany. ""The Reader"" views the trial of a group of SS guards whose commitment to duty resulted in hundreds of deaths through the eyes of the younger generation, which is deeply ashamed of the nation's past.The DVD (Weinstein 2009): There are 5 featurettes, 11 deleted and extended scenes, and a theatrical trailer. ""Adapting a Timeless Masterpiece"" (25 min) interviews director Stephen Daldry, screenwriter David Hare, and author Bernhard Schlink about the adaptation, themes, and the cast about the director's style. ""A Conversation with David Kross & Stephen Daldry"" (10 min) includes a few press interviews with the actor and director. ""Kate Winslet on the Art of Aging Hanna Schmitz"" (13 min) spends time in the make-up chair with Winslet and the make-up team as they age her 30 years. The composer talks about what the music needs to accomplish in ""A New Voice: A Look at Composer Nico Muhly"" (4 min). ""Coming to Grips with the Past"" (7 min) interviews production designer Brigitte Broch about locations, period design, and her own choice to leave Germany 40 years ago.

1228907,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B001PPLJIQ,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[2, 2]","The heartbreaking bittersweet love story of a 15 year old boy named Michael Berg (played at different ages by Ralph Fiennes and David Kross),who has a romance with a 36 year old woman and eventually falls in love with her. After their lovemaking he reads many of the classics to her (this affair goes on for months) and that's where we get the title for this film.But she strangely disappears on him (he shows up to an empty apartment) and with his broken heart he finds it hard to relate to women his age. More time passes and he's in law school and he's at the hearings in the 1960s for Nazi War criminals and his ex lover is there and taking the heat at the expense of the accused female group (they were female guards who kept Jewish prisoners in a burning church during a death march because they were told to not let them escape). She goes to prison for a very long time but Michael keeps in contact with her. What follows is his long correspondence over the years and arguably at the expense of his extended family. It's poignant at times when his mother complains about him never coming to visit much in his hometown or even flying back for his father's funeral (he's in New York City). But what his mother doesn't realize is that the memories of his lost love are too painful to revisit. One wonders if his broken heart resulted in his eventual divorce from a wife that doesn't appear on the screen but is only mentioned.** MINOR SPOILER **At the original hearing he learns that she doesn't know how to read so she couldn't have been mainly responsible for issuing orders to let the prisoners burn in the building. Hanna would rather go to prison for most of her life than admit she cannot read. Michael realizes this during the trial as he flashbacks to all the times he read to her and the moments in which she looked at his books but didn't fully comprehend them.So what follows is him sending her tape recordings (this is before DVDs and all that other tech that we love) teaching her how to read and enunciate words. His former lover's world opens to the world of reading. She writes back to him with simple letters but he never responds and instead keeps sending tapes to her. In a way you get that this is therapeutic for Michael, who is still dealing with the pain of their break up so many years later.Michael in later years has to make a choice. The prison calls him to tell him that Hanna is soon to be released and he's the only person listed as somebody who knows her. After a lot of angst Michael decides to meet her and see if a relationship so many years later is possible but tragedy is at the door. There's a nice book ending to this tale in which Michael couldn't tell his mother about his love affair but he does get to tell his daughter during the closing credits.** END SPOILERS **The best part of this film are the many layered themes interwoven with personal emotions. Can movies and literature truly convey the horrors of the Holocaust or is it something one had to live through to fully understand? Are we wasting time trying to convey the horrors to later generations which have mixed feelings about it? Can a boy truly be in love with an older woman or is it pedophilia? Why does a younger man in love with a far older woman bother us as a society yet the reverse is fine? Can literature be used to convey feelings that cannot be expressed in words? Can literature be used to fill in the empty space of silence between two people? How can people do absolutely horrible things and then go on living a normal life as if nothing had happened? How does a country deal with a generation of its people that did horrible things and even tried to justify their actions? Can one be forgiven for doing horrible things? Who decides what can and cannot be forgiven?Kate Winslet, who plays the older woman, Hanna, would garner an Oscar (Best Actress) as well as a Golden Globe award for her superlative performance as a cold yet strangely sympathetic and compelling Nazi war criminal. Not surprisingly this film was nominated for a host of other awards, including the coveted Best Picture. Based on a novel of a similar title by Bernhard Schlink who was an advisor on the film.The budget was $32M and it made over $108M at the Box Office. Arguably one of the top ten movies for 2008 if you want more than explosions and cute but empty lines in your dialogue.STORY/PLOTTING: A minus to A; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; THEMES/QUESTIONS: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): Michael: I can't live without you. The thought of leaving you kills me. Do you love me?  //// Hanna Schmitz: It doesn't matter what I feel. It doesn't matter what I think. The dead are still dead.  /// Young Ilana Mather: [Testifying in court] Each of the guards would choose a certain number of women. Hanna Schmitz chose differently. Judge: In what way differently?  Young Ilana Mather: She had favourites. Girls, mostly young. We all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep. In the evening, she asked them to join her. We all thought - well, you can imagine what we thought. Then we found out - she was making these women read aloud to her. They were reading to her. At first we thought this guard... this guard is more sensitive... she's more human... she's kinder. Often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost. But then she dispatched them. Is that kinder?  //// Rose Mather: People ask all the time what I learned in the camps. But the camps weren't therapy. What do you think these places were? Universities? We didn't go there to learn. One becomes very clear about these things. What are you asking for? Forgiveness for her? Or do you just want to feel better yourself? My advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis. Please. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out of the camps. Nothing.  //// Professor Rohl: Societies think they operate by something called morality, but they don't. They operate by something called law. Professor Rohl: 8000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 of murder. Professor Rohl: The question is never ""Was it wrong"", but ""Was it legal"". And not by our laws, no.

I read the book 10 years ago so my memory of all the details was a little fuzzy going in, but I can say here that I actually think the movie is better than the book. I don't remember the book having as big an impact on me as the movie.Kate Winslet shines here as a lonely and troubled woman (Hanna) whose bleak existence is briefly interrupted by an affair with a high school boy (Michael). When the affair ends, they seem to go their separate ways only to cross paths again years later under the worst of circumstances. It is truly heartbreaking to see the effects of Hanna's trial on Michael, and the young actor portraying him (David Cross) does a fine job conveying his emotional devastation. In fact all the actors are great; I especially enjoyed seeing Bruno Ganz (Wings of Desire, The Last Days of Chez Nous) as Michael's law school professor. Hanna and Michael's past romance and his difficulty in coming to terms with learning that she was an SS officer, along with her illiteracy are the driving forces behind this film. Ralph Fiennes turns in a thoughtful performance as the adult Michael, now as lonely and troubled as was Hanna when they first met.I need not go on and on with further descriptions of the plot. This film is worth your time and money for the fine acting and the powerful message it delivers about illiteracy and the sins of one generation being visited upon another. My vote for best actress goes to Kate Winslet.When I say the movie is better than the book, remember it is only my opinion; perhaps something was lost in the translation from German to English.

I was glad that it was being turned into a film. A film can never compare to the book but, this is a film that does the book justice. It enhances it as it gives the story further life and still remains faithful to the novel.Michael, a 15 year old boy, has an affair with an older woman, Hanna, in post-Nazi Germany. One day she just disappears. Later, as a young law student, Michael enrolls in a seminar and attends the trial of SS women guards. There he finds Hanna, who is on trial for her role as a guard for the SS and he holds the key to a secret that could help her case. Will he help her or just stand by (like the generations before him)?The book deals a lot with the idea of German guilt and the resentment of the post-Nazi generation towards their parent's generation who they view as conscious accomplices of the Nazi regime. The movie does as well, but the movie also focuses on the idea of morality and law and their differences. It also deals with the idea of standing by while wrongs are being committed. The film also explores the relationship of Michael and Hanna as it morphed through the years. These two people needed each other but dare not be open with each other.The film is not really about the Holocaust, it is about the aftermath, about these two characters who have become isolated from the world and each other.

But not for the kindness of a passing woman, he does not know how he would have made it home. To express his gratitude he goes back to her with flowers. His innocent act of thanks then leads to a torrid affair with this older woman. Their time together lasts only a few months before the woman disappears without saying goodbye, but the boy, Michael, will never be the same. Later, in law school, Michael's class goes to the courthouse to learn from courtroom experience. On trial is Hanna, the woman who changed Michael's life forever.After a few days of soul searching I am finally ready to say if I liked this movie or not. And I did. I thought that there were a few things that detracted from the movie, but there are almost always things that detract from movies. I will try to be brief and discuss my main complaint with the movie first. It was in English. The movie bounces between different chapters of Michael's life, but except for a short scene at the end (that I would have left out if I had edited this film) the entire movie takes place in Germany. The movie, based on more than just the countless scenes of passion between Michael and Hanna, strives to become intimate with the audience. I found it strange that the movie was not in German with subtitles. I feel this would have given the movie a more authentic feel and bridged that final gap of intimacy.With that out of the way, I may continue with what I enjoyed. Much early press suggests that Kate Winslet will take home an award or two for her role as Hanna. I have not seen every movie she is nominated, or might be nominated, against so I will not comment on that. I will say that in this movie alone her performance was second best. David Kross was young Michael. He is our protagonist. While it is hard to overlook Ralph Fiennes, who plays older Michael, most of the movie happens while Michael is young. David Kross, a young actor with very little experience, shows strong talent in The Reader.I wanted to argue against the amount of nudity and ""adult situations"" that make up essentially the entire first half of the movie. I have gone so far as to jokingly call this movie pornography, but I think it was all necessary to lend credibility to the impact Michael and Hanna had on each other. Here were two people who yearned to be together and were physically intimate beyond all boundaries, yet secrets were kept. And the secrets drove them apart.I cannot say that The Reader was any better or worse than the other movies I have seen where a boy has an affair with an older woman then sees her tried in a court of law. Shockingly, this is the only movie I have seen in that category. Since I cannot compare it to anything, I will say that I found the story to be deeply moving at times. I thought the characters were developed well and the things I didn't like did not make the movie unwatchable.",4,Certainly a unique film.

As I watched it unfold, I found myself drawn into it more and more despite some significant shortcomings.  The film begins as a fairly racey ""coming of age"" story.  A 15 year-old boy encounters an older woman (at one time mistaken as his mother) and things develop.  Things end abruptly when the older woman leaves with no forwarding address.  Naturally, things resume later only this time the 15 year old is a young adult law student in Germany (everything takes place in Germany but no one speaks German).  Now the former lover (looking a bit older) is on trial for Holocaust crimes.  The young man wrestles with the unfolding truth while holding back on his own knowledge of the truth.  Well, I'm not trying to give away the plot but eventually something unique and wonderful happens as the film makes its' way to a bumpy end.For a movie about relationships, this was a movie that was equally guitly of not clarifying relationships.  One night the teenage boy has to nervously make up his excuse for being late for supper and the rest of the nights who knows when he gets home.  I suspect that an arrangement of some sort of boarding school happened when I blinked.  How about the marriage that failed without us ever really knowing it happened.  Of course a total of 2 minutes of good dialogue was all that was needed to explore the deep and fragile relationship between father and child.  Then there's the brief appearances of Ralph Fiennes which constituted top billing.  Oh well, Kate Winslet is the movie; not Ralph or his youthful understudy.  This film is about nobody doing the right thing with a major lone exception and that is where the film's title comes in.",4,Love in the Time of War Trials,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,1722,"['Reader', 'struck', 'most', 'unusual', 'movie', 'watched', 'unfold', 'found', 'drawn', 'more', 'more', 'significant', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'fairly', 'racey', 'coming', 'age', 'story', '15', 'year-old', 'boy', 'encounters', 'older', 'woman', 'one', 'time', 'mistaken', 'mother', 'things', 'develop', 'Things', 'end', 'abruptly', 'when', 'older', 'woman', 'forwarding', 'address', 'Naturally', 'things', 'resume', 'later', 'only', 'time', '15', 'year', 'old', 'young', 'adult', 'law', 'student', 'Germany', 'everything', 'place', 'Germany', 'one', 'speaks', 'German', 'Now', 'former', 'lover', 'looking', 'bit', 'older', 'trial', 'Holocaust', 'crimes', 'young', 'man', 'unfolding', 'truth', 'holding', 'back', 'own', 'knowledge', 'truth', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'eventually', 'something', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'happens', 'film', 'way', 'bumpy', 'movie', 'relationships', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'equally', 'guitly', 'not', 'clarifying', 'relationships', 'One', 'night', 'teenage', 'boy', 'nervously', 'make', 'up', 'excuse', 'being', 'late', 'supper', 'rest', 'nights', 'who', 'when', 'home', 'suspect', 'arrangement', 'sort', 'boarding', 'school', 'happened', 'when', 'blinked', 'How', 'marriage', 'failed', 'ever', 'really', 'knowing', 'happened', 'course', 'total', '2', 'minutes', 'good', 'dialogue', 'was', 'was', 'needed', 'explore', 'deep', 'fragile', 'relationship', 'father', 'child', 'Then', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'constituted', 'top', 'billing', 'Oh', 'well', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'movie', 'not', 'Ralph', 'youthful', 'understudy', 'film', 'nobody', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'major', 'lone', 'exception', 'where', 'film', 'title']",N/A

He remembers his teenage youth when he met and had a short but passionate affair with his first love - a simple older woman who was living an orderly, dutiful but reclusive life. The age difference could be disturbing to some, but I think the woman being full of repressed feelings and individuality, she was on a similar emotional level as our teenage boy and used her sexual energy to experience some freedom through ecstasy.For pretty obvious reasons (to the viewer), she asks Michael to read books to her out loud. She is so keen to keep this particular reason a secret that she even causes great harm to herself protecting it.I know I'm talking in sign language here, but don't wanna spoil the story. So I'll end by saying that it really is worth watching. A tale about how sometimes doing your 'duty' for the lunatic people that run your country will be considered evil by later generations.

But the two major twists to the film, which is based on Bernard Schlink's book, is that Michael is a young man, 15 or 20 years Hannah's junior, and both Michael and Hannah have so-called skeletons in the closet.  And it is only when years have passed that those secrets are revealed in the most unsettling circumstance while Michael is a law student and observes the proceedings for Nazi war crimes that took place in Auschwitz during World War II, which included female Nazi guards; the intensity in those scenes are highly moving.But the touching and somewhat puzzling part about Michael and Hannah's relationship is how Michael reads to Hannah.  He reads to her various classic pieces of literature, especially his droll reading of ""Huckleberry Finn.""  But what would have a lasting impression would be a book called ""The Lady and the Dog.""  As the film progresses, viewers will see the significance of Michael's readings and how his affections for Hannah, even as an adult, never faded despite subtle expressions that showed his remoteness towards her.Viewers can owe those scenes and the overall film to the screenplay by David Hare, the cinematography of Roger Deakins and Chris Menges, and Director Stephen Daldry.

I found interesting, with great acting by the lead characters but was left with several questions....1 Is the relationship between the 'kid' and Hanna one of sexual education or molestation? 15 years is young but not exactly a kid either...and he seems to come back to her because he clearly enjoys what goes on between them in bed. Teenagers engaging in sex is not anything new, and Kate Winslet does not look like his mom - she definitely looks elder to him but not that old. He is emotionally damaged...yeah sure..how many adult relationships leave people scarred and emotionally damaged for life? Lots of them...All said and done if it is meant to depict molestation it fails miserably, some advantage has been taken with age and depiction to titillate viewers.2 Why does the 'kid' feel so much regard for her after he is grown up? He is portrayed as a kind and compassionate man who genuinely tries to understand the horrors of the holocaust..she on the other hand resists every effort to show any feelings around it...even in his last effort to rekindle her memories she only talks of what she gained (to read), and dismisses how she thinks and feels as 'does not matter since the dead are still dead' (perhaps should be 'does matter since so many died'?:)) She committed suicide..yeah perhaps with the realization that she is a misfit in the outside world now...and grossly ashamed of her affair..But why does he think she is so important? Perhaps because she engaged him in a way nobody else did - sexually, by reading to her, something?? Still makes the viewer feel something is missing...3 Is it really possible for a woman to be illiterate and be a bus conductor and a nazi guard, even in those days? Both roles require minimal reading capabilites...she does punch tickets and am guessing the tickets had numbers or something printed on them ?:)), and lots of nazi guards had lists and various printed material to read. Somehow unconvincing...Given all of that still Winslet and the male lead put on stellar performances.

Kate Winslet earns her Oscar in a conflicted performance: You sympathize with her when she becomes the scapegoat of a trial, and you hate her for her frustrating lack of remorse.  The film doesn't ask you to forgive her, but to put yourself in her shoes.  Yes, there is obviously something psychologically wrong with her that helped her do the horrendous things that she did, but in spite of that, can you say with confidence that you wouldn't have done the same?Bottom line: Some may find the film gratuitous in its eroticism, immoral in its portrayal of the Nazis, or boring in its pace.

1228945,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001PPLJIQ,RMurray847,"[2, 2]","Warning:  this review contains a significant spoiler.  If you really have no idea what the movie is about, and don't want to know...read no further.  I don't discuss anything beyond what you find in virtually any review about the film...but be warned nonetheless.THE READER is fabulously well-acted, and thus it is a gripping drama.  When it's all said-and-done, though...I was left perplexed as to how to react.  I didn't have mixed feelings about it...I literally wasn't sure how I felt.That may be both a huge accomplishment and a failing.  THE READER essentially conspires to make us sympathize (to one extent or another) with a Nazi war-criminal.  In a way, the film may be doing this to help illustrate how easy it is to turn away or ignore horrible things going on.  To give some sense of how so many Germans could have turned a blind eye at the atrocities of the SS during World War II.  Yet by the same token, the film cheats in evoking these feelings because we are introduced to the main character years after the war, and are led to see her in a sympathetic manner...feelings that stick with us throughout the film.Kate Winslet plays Hanna, a 30 something woman working as a conductor on a streetcar in post-war Germany.  She lives a quiet life in a tiny apartment, making a very small ripple in the world.  One day, she shows a little kindness to 15 year-old Michael, and when he returns to Hanna's apartment to thank her some weeks later, the two fall into a deep, passionate and highly inappropriate affair.  Hanna clings to Michael for some kind of comfort, yet she is also quite demanding on him.  She will give him virtually anything he can imagine sexually, yet she holds up a very solid wall against his efforts to build a truly intimate relationship.  He is, understandably, madly in love with this amazing older woman who is teaching him things his friends can only imagine.  And he also reads to Hanna (at her insistence):  short stories, novels like HUCKLEBERRY FINN, etc.One day, Hanna just disappears and Michael is left bereft.  Years later (I won't explain the circumstances), Michael finds that Hanna is on trial for war crimes...apparently she was a guard who led a fair share of women to the death chambers and also left a large group of women and children to die in a church fire.  There is no question she was involved...but to what extent?  Did she have a valid reason?  And does Michael know something about Hanna that could help her?  And if he DOES...should he use it, or should he let Hanna ""suffer"" a large punishment?This dilemma is at the crux of what the film is about.  It explores guilt and it also explores the idea of a ""shared"" guilt.  I know the book upon which THE READER is based was written by a German, so I believe both works also are working at understanding the national guilt Germany feels, or the world thinks it should feel.  And it was this exploration that left me perplexed.  Am I supposed to sympathize with Hanna?  If I were in Michael's shoes, would I want to help her or hurt her or ignore her?And in this story, Michael is also deeply affected by the sense of loss and betrayal Hanna's sudden disappearance left him with.  He has become a person who is closed-off from his feelings and reluctant to open himself to others.  Frankly, he's become an unlikeable, uptight jerk.How the relationship between Hanna and Michael grows and changes and concludes is the through-line of this movie.  It is certainly and interesting and compelling drama.And the three stars of the film make it very, very watchable.  Kate Winslet, who can do virtually no wrong, gives one of her best performances.  Her character is frequently unlikeable (even before we know about her past)...yet we can certainly see why a 15 year old would be hopelessly smitten by this damaged person.  And although her old-age makeup isn't always the best, Winslet develops her character convincingly over several decades.  The young Michael is played by David Kross, a very talented young man who very convincingly portrays the reserve of a child of a wealthy family, as well as the enthusiasm for sex that only teens can have, along with a very touching effort to try to understand Hanna and make her happy.  Older Michael is played by Ralph Fiennes, who once again shows how many different ways a closed-off, repressed person can be played.  It's another type-casting for Fiennes, but as always, he pulls it off as no other modern actor can.So while I found THE READER a perplexing puzzle at times, I still greatly enjoyed the film.  It is crisply directed, and the cinematography makes the German countryside sparkle.  It is not flashy, but it is still softly powerful and disquieting in how much it can make us care for these far from perfect people.",4,"VERY well acted and quite interesting.

1228947,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001PPLJIQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","The Reader (Stephen Daldry, 2008)It has taken me a very long time to get around to reviewing The Reader, Stephen Daldry's Oscar-winning flick. This is because every time I sat down to review it, I found that the controversy surrounding the movie was still going strong (or had re-ignited), and I wanted to wait until everyone had given closing arguments. At this point, I'm not sure that will ever happen, but it's reached that point where the usual suspects are rehashing the same tired arguments over and over, so I'm abandoning any pretense of being able to report something comprehensive and pretty much ignoring the whole thing; in other words, this is probably the same review I'd have written last December. oops.In The Reader, Daldry (The Hours) tells the story of Michael Berg (played as a teen by Krabat's David Kross and as an adult by Ralph Fiennes), a German boy in the fifties who finds himself befriending, and then becoming the lover of, tram ticket-taker Hannah Schmitz (Kate Winslet). All goes well for one wonderful summer, as Berg and Schmitz romp and Berg reads aloud to her as foreplay or afterglow; one day, however, Schmitz vanishes without a trace. Berg remains haunted by her disappearance until a few years later, when he's in law school and is assigned by one of his professors to cover the trial of a contingent of female Nazi guards; Schmitz is one of them. As if this isn't bad enough, when Berg puts some pieces of the trial together with what he knows of Schmitz, he realizes he has information that could change the outcome of the trial. What's a boy to do?The core of the movie, the piece by which it must stand or fall, is the performances of the two main characters by the three actors who play them. Winslet, who's been racking up Oscar nominations right and left, finally and deservedly won the Oscar that has eluded her for so long, while Kross and Fiennes are both phenomenal as the two phases of Berg. With all the controversy surrounding the setting and the subtexts here, when it comes right down to it, The Reader is a love story, and in that regard, it is an undeniable success.But one cannot ignore the setting and subtexts; without them, it would be as forgettable as something like Message in a Bottle. I have a confession to make; I have never been a fan of Stephen Daldry's films, and the reason for that is that Daldry has always been as subtle as a steel mallet when it comes to subtexts. While that is the case here in more than one scene (one of the very few places I had a problem with Kross here is the wordless scene at the prison, with an agonized look on his face right out of the climax of The Perfect Storm), Daldry has certainly learned to be more subtle with such things than he was in the awful Billy Elliott or the painfully maudlin The Hours. A bit more subtlety, a bit more flair, in the handling of the Nazi question and this could have been one for the ages (and, I'm sure far less controversial than it was); as it is, it's still enough of a success to get a high recommendation from yours truly. I should have given it seven months ago. Silly me. ****",4,"Ignore the tiresome, endless debates.

1228950,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B001PPLJIQ,Robin Friedman,"[4, 4]","""The Reader"" has received largely favorable but mixed reviews. The movie explores themes of guilt, responsibility, and love. It is based upon a novel of the same name by Bernard Schlink, a German law professor.  The larger part of the story tells of an affair between a 15 year old adolescent, Michael Berg, and a woman in her mid-30s, Hanna Schmitz, who works collecting fares on a trolley. Besides their physical relationship, Hanna wants Michael to read to her. He reads novels, poetry, and classics, the stuff of literature. The movie moves both backwards to tell of Hanna's unsavory past as a guard for the SS during the Holocaust and forwards, to recount Hanna's and Michael's lives subsequent to their relationship in the late 1950s.  Michael becomes a lawyer. He marries, has a daughter, and divorces.  He is a tense individual with difficulty forming an intimate relationship with a woman. Hanna is sentenced to life imprisonment for her role during the Holocaust. The movie describes Hanna's and Michael's relationship during Michael's adulthood and how it effects each of them.Some viewers find this movie troubling in that it evokes sympathy for a woman deeply involved in the crimes of the Holocaust. I found that the movie developed Schmitz' character and thought the criticism misplaced. The movie also involves sexual abuse of a minor with many explicit scenes. Again, I did not see the movie as endorsing these activities. The flashbacks have been criticized for being difficult to follow, but I did not find this to be the case.  I thought the manner in which the flashbacks were presented was integral to the story.I found the movie compelling in its portrayal of the long relationship between its two major characters and in their frustrated searches for each other. The film develops the theme of guilt and responsibility as it applies to those who lived through the days of the Holocaust.  It universalizes these themes to people everywhere,and pointedly individualizes them to show their role in the adult life of Michael Berg.  Early in the movie one of Michael's teachers is lecturing on the role of secrecy as a literary device.  The nature of individual secrets is probed throughout the movie.

1228953,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001PPLJIQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","Like all works of art that endeavor to ""illuminate"" the Holocaust, ""The Reader"" ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can be found.  Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge the impossibility of its task.  Thus, rather than trying to resolve all the issues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trusting that, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our own conclusions about what, if anything, it all ""means.""Though it is set in a number of different time periods, the story proper begins in 1958, when a 15-year-old German boy by the name of Michael Berg is seduced by a 38-year-old  woman named Hanna Schmitz.  For a summer, the two carry on a secret, illicit affair, wherein the woman introduces the boy to the joys of physical love, while he reciprocates by reading the classics to her between bouts of passionate lovemaking.  Flash forward to 1966 when Michael, now a university law student, discovers, much to his horror, that this very same Hanna who meant so much to him in his youth is actually a former concentration camp guard currently standing trial for war crimes.  The story goes even further ahead in time as a now middle-aged Michael keeps up the relationship by sending his personalized recordings of books to Hanna as she serves out her time in prison.There has been some criticism leveled against the film that it aims to cast a Nazi mass murderer in a ""sympathetic"" light.  Yet, what ultimately comes across in the story is not how ""likable"" a person Hanna is but how sadly tragic.  Like all fine drama, ""The Reader"" goes beyond the two-dimensional stereotypes of heroes and villains to examine the complexity of human relationships and the messiness of the human condition.  The movie keeps us emotionally off-balance throughout.  Even in the early stages of the courtship, we are torn between our attraction to the characters as individuals and our revulsion at the difference in their ages.  Hanna is particularly enigmatic as she embraces a child two decades her junior yet seems to find some strange fulfillment in him that goes beyond the obvious physicality of their relationship.  Despite the touchy nature of these scenes, we get a feel for what brings these two very different characters together at this particular moment in time.As the story moves on, the screenplay confronts many of the thornier issues surrounding what exactly happened in Germany in the middle of the Twentieth Century, questioning how so many ""average"" people could, at best, have turned a blind eye to the events that were occuring, and, at worst, have allowed themselves to become complicit in the mass atrocities.  There's a beautifully incisive scene in which a young law student confronts his professor, demanding to know how the man has been able to live with himself for all these years, knowing that he did not do everything within his power to try and stop what was happening. In that brief, shining moment, we get a sense of what it must have been like for the people in Germany in the decades following the war when so many, Hanna included, simply turned their backs on the past in an effort to move on with their lives.Perhaps the most complex character in the story is Michael, who, as he ages and learns more and more hidden truths about his first love, must come to terms with the fact that the woman he thought he knew on the most intimate of terms may, in fact, be an unrepentant mass murderer.  Yet, love is not something that can be turned on and off at will, and it takes Michael decades to figure out just how best to deal with the moral dilemma raging in the very depths of his soul.Michael is played first by David Kross in the period from 1958 to 1966, and then by Ralph Fiennes in the time thereafter.  Both are superb, with Kross, in particular, delivering a performance of such delicacy and sensitivity that he sets the groundwork for what Fiennes is called on to do later in the film.  And, of course, Kate Winslet, in the role that won her an Oscar, demonstrates yet again why she is one of the screen's great actresses.Kudos must also go to screenwriter David Hare, who has adapted Bernhard Schlink's complexly structured novel with integrity and taste, and to director Stephen Daldry and cinematographers Chris Menges and Roger Deakins for the sumptuous look they have achieved with the film.

1228956,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B001PPLJIQ,Sean Curley,"[8, 15]","Stephen Daldry is a director who has started to acquire a reputation for tackling books that are rather difficult to adapt, starting with his 2002 debut, ""The Hours"".  This time, he has chosen as his subject Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel 'Der  Vorleser', which was somewhat controversial at the time, attracting accusations of creating too much reader sympathy for a former SS officer.  I did not find that to be the case here; what Schlink and Daldry are doing, as I see it, is raising uncomfortable questions and taking the stance that there are no neat answers (which could, I suppose, be called a dodge, or else dramatically unsatisfying).  Some spoilers follow.The film, like ""The Hours"", has a somewhat intricate narrative structure, juggling timelines in 1958, 1966, spans from the 1970s to the 1980s, and 1995.  There are points when this seems unnecessarily complicated, but it generally works well.  The most effective sequences are the 1958-1966 span, where Michael Berg (David Kross) finds himself drawn into an affair with Hanna Schmidt (Kate Winslet), a Neustadt tram employee.  He is 15, she considerably older.  Their relationship is almost a quid pro quo of sex and reading.  Then, one day, she vanishes, only to return into his life surprisingly in 1966, when he finds her on trial for her role in the death of 300 Jewish women in the final days of World War II.  In the later sequences, an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes, a long way from Amon Goethe) as he deals with the aftermath of these events.One of the more prurient items of discussion regarding this film is that it features quite a bit of Kate Winslet naked and having sex (though 1 in every 2 Kate Winslet movies might be said to have the same).  There is also plenty from the young Kross (one imagines your average young actor would be thrilled for their first role to involve a lot of time being naked in bed with Kate Winslet).  There is in our society something of a double-standard regarding such underage relationships; if this film starred Brad Pitt and Emma Watson, once imagines the reaction of critics and audiences would be rather different.  However, ""The Reader"" conveys with great subtlety the damage this does to Michael (even before the Nazi revelation).  In 1958, while the affair goes on, Michael becomes isolated from his friends and ignores the more age-appropriate Sophie; by 1966, at law school, he finds himself incapable of sleeping in the same bed as a fellow law student; in the present day, we find him divorced and struggling to connect with his daughter.On the issue of the Holocaust, the filmmakers are quite aware of the risk they run in focussing so much on Hanna; the camera tends to create sympathy, particularly as she is so scared an uncomprehending when brought to trial.  We feel the temptation to make excuses for her based on illiteracy.  And, at the end, the film wheels out a survivor (Lena Olin, wonderful in two scenes) to challenge this directly.  Michael, whose story this is and whose views have been transplanted to the audience to an extent, squirms under her questions.  As Olin says, the film cannot offer absolution, nor, perhaps, should it (that's up to you, of course).Berg's guilt comes not just from his inability to resolve the question of Hanna, but also from his own actions in 1966, and what that says about him.  On  a much smaller scale, he repeats the moral cowardice of Hanna's generaton which casts doubt on whether he'd have done any better in her situation.The cast is excellent.  Winslet deserved an Oscar for the work she does here (though it's more properly a supporting role, not a lead); what she does with her facial expressions in the trial scene is impressive.  Kross makes a strong impression here as well.  There's novelty in the presence of actors from past Holocaust dramas occupying roles much more sympathetic; not just Spielberg's Amon Goethe, but Hitler himself, Bruno Ganz (""Downfall"", another film that attracted criticism of too much sympathy for the devil), as a law professor.  Overall, a very strong package.And for those who don't get the title reference, do consider watching the BBC comedy series ""Extras"".",5,"Well, Kate Winslet's plan to win an Oscar by starring in a Holocaust film worked.",1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,4175,"['Stephen', 'Daldry', 'director', 'who', 'started', 'acquire', 'reputation', 'tackling', 'books', 'are', 'rather', 'difficult', 'adapt', 'starting', '2002', 'debut', 'Hours', 'time', 'chosen', 'subject', 'Bernhard', 'Schlink', '1995', 'novel', 'Vorleser', 'was', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'time', 'attracting', 'accusations', 'creating', 'too', 'much', 'reader', 'sympathy', 'former', 'SS', 'officer', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'what', 'Schlink', 'Daldry', 'are', 'doing', 'see', 'raising', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'taking', 'stance', 'are', 'neat', 'answers', 'could', 'suppose', 'be', 'called', 'dodge', 'else', 'dramatically', 'unsatisfying', 'spoilers', 'follow.The', 'film', 'Hours', 'somewhat', 'intricate', 'narrative', 'structure', 'juggling', 'timelines', '1958', '1966', 'spans', '1970s', '1980s', '1995', 'are', 'points', 'when', 'unnecessarily', 'complicated', 'generally', 'well', 'most', 'effective', 'sequences', 'are', '1958-1966', 'span', 'where', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'David', 'Kross', 'drawn', 'affair', 'Hanna', 'Schmidt', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Neustadt', 'tram', 'employee', '15', 'considerably', 'older', 'relationship', 'almost', 'quid', 'pro', 'quo', 'sex', 'reading', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'only', 'return', 'life', 'surprisingly', '1966', 'when', 'trial', 'role', 'death', '300', 'Jewish', 'women', 'final', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'later', 'sequences', 'adult', 'Michael', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'long', 'way', 'Amon', 'Goethe', 'aftermath', 'events.One', 'more', 'prurient', 'items', 'discussion', 'regarding', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'naked', 'having', 'sex', '1', '2', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'movies', 'might', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'same', 'also', 'plenty', 'young', 'Kross', 'one', 'average', 'young', 'actor', 'would', 'be', 'thrilled', 'first', 'role', 'involve', 'lot', 'time', 'being', 'naked', 'bed', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'society', 'something', 'double-standard', 'regarding', 'such', 'underage', 'relationships', 'film', 'starred', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'once', 'reaction', 'critics', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'different', 'However', 'Reader', 'conveys', 'great', 'subtlety', 'damage', 'Michael', 'even', 'Nazi', 'revelation', '1958', 'affair', 'Michael', 'becomes', 'isolated', 'friends', 'more', 'age-appropriate', 'Sophie', '1966', 'law', 'school', 'incapable', 'sleeping', 'same', 'bed', 'fellow', 'law', 'student', 'present', 'day', 'find', 'divorced', 'struggling', 'connect', 'daughter.On', 'issue', 'Holocaust', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'quite', 'aware', 'risk', 'run', 'focussing', 'so', 'much', 'Hanna', 'camera', 'create', 'sympathy', 'particularly', 'so', 'scared', 'uncomprehending', 'when', 'brought', 'trial', 'feel', 'temptation', 'make', 'excuses', 'based', 'illiteracy', 'end', 'film', 'out', 'survivor', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'wonderful', 'two', 'scenes', 'challenge', 'directly', 'Michael', 'story', 'views', 'have', 'been', 'transplanted', 'audience', 'extent', 'squirms', 'questions', 'Olin', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'offer', 'absolution', 'perhaps', 'should', 'up', 'course', '.Berg', 'guilt', 'not', 'just', 'inability', 'resolve', 'question', 'Hanna', 'also', 'own', 'actions', '1966', 'what', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale', 'moral', 'cowardice', 'Hanna', 'generaton', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'have', 'done', 'better', 'situation.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Winslet', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'work', 'here', 'more', 'properly', 'supporting', 'role', 'not', 'lead', 'what', 'facial', 'expressions', 'trial', 'scene', 'impressive', 'Kross', 'strong', 'impression', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'novelty', 'presence', 'actors', 'past', 'Holocaust', 'dramas', 'occupying', 'roles', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'just', 'Spielberg', 'Amon', 'Goethe', 'Hitler', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'Downfall', 'film', 'attracted', 'criticism', 'too', 'much', 'sympathy', 'devil', 'law', 'professor', 'Overall', 'very', 'strong', 'package.And', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'title', 'reference', 'do', 'consider', 'watching', 'BBC', 'comedy', 'series', 'Extras']",N/A

Without doubt Winslet's performance as Schmitz was flawless, one to remember for her career.  Kross as the younger Michael Berg was equally enthralling.  Fiennes's portrayal of adult Berg was a bit stiff and drole, which despite those being hallmarks of Fiennes' skill--posing no challenges to him, the dry delivery of Berg worked well.  Where this film was not a total success to me was in its storytelling.  The plotholes are many, which apparently detracted from the film's glory for much of its audience.  I can say that I did note as the plot progressed that it takes rather unintuitive leaps, though I did not feel that such omissions completely derailed the film.  In the setting of post-war Germany, Berlin, to be specific, I can expect there to be a stoic presentation of life and relationships.  In that setting abundant and lush expressions of feelings and emotion just don't exist.  However, the audience is left to assume this cultural characteristic is the reason for Berg's distance from his family, for any disjunct between Berg and Schmitz, for Berg's reasons that he keeps his relationship with and knowledge of Schmitz to himself.  The explanations of these significant details are conveyed through facial expressions and slowly paced scenes, which for all their subtlety in imparting meaning serve most to slow the pace of the film.  I felt OK with the assumptions I made for characters' motivations, but I can entirely understand an audience for whom that was not enough explanation.  Despite the lack of new perspectives introduced about the Holocaust or the reconstructionist era of Germany, this film will certainly introduce new concepts of humanity to many, particularly the banality of many who were involved with Nazi efforts.

Saying that, all of the performance's from all involved are very strong and the direction is superb as well. The Amazon synopsis explains the story very well, as do other reviews here, but suffice to say this is a richly woven story with an interesting analysis of human nature. Most WW2 or holocaust films can be particularly harrowing and although this is also the case with this film (but only in places) the emphasis is most definitely on the human relationships involved rather than graphic details of cruelty. The relationship between the young Michael and Hanna is intriguing to watch, with an unusual dynamic that is explained as the film develops and you begin to understand why she enjoys being read to so much. The relationship between them when Michael is an adult is more complex and conducted from afar and both these aspects of their relationship are portrayed extremely well.

Hannah had participated in heinous crimes against Jews, during World War II. Hannah is lonely, and leads an isolated life. She has no family, friends, or companions. After the war ends, Hannah is living alone and working in Berlin, Germany.One miserably rainy day in 1958 Berlin, 15-year-old Michael Berg becomes sick, while coming home from school. Hannah happens to spot Michael vomiting, outside of her apartment building. She helps Micheal clean-up, and then sends him home. Michael is later diagnosed with Scarlet Fever, and has to stay in bed for weeks, to fully recover.Michael returns to see Hannah after his convalescence, bringing her flowers to thank her. He spots Hannah putting a stocking on her bare leg, as he's leaving. Hannah sees him ogling her. Hannah is in her 30s. And she's seen as being wise and worldly, by the naive Micheal.Next time that Micheal returns to Hannah's, she asks him to do some chores. When working, Michael gets filthy, and Hannah insists that he bathe, before he leaves. While Micheal is in the tub, Hannah slips quietly into the bathroom. She strips naked, and slyly seduces Micheal, right then and there. It's the start of a summer affair between them.During their time together, Hannah insists the Michael read a variety of literature, poems, and prose to her. Hannah cannot read herself. And she comes to rely on Michael's readings, to expand her understanding of the world, as well as for own pleasure. By the end of the summer of '58, the affair between Hannah and Michael ends. Michael then attends law school, to pursue a law career.As fate would have it, Hannah is caught and tried for her participation in Nazi war crimes. Michael is a part of the trial, as a budding lawyer. He had no idea that Hannah could be capable of such vicious acts. It's all a devastating revelation for Micheal, and he tries to figure out how to handle it.As the years pass, Michael continues to be entwined in Hannah's life, even after she's sentenced to prison, and he grows up and marries someone else. Micheal just can't abandon Hannah, and this leads to his realization, of how deep his feelings are for her. For Micheal, this leads ultimately to tragic heartbreak.This film belongs to Kate Winslet, who should win an Oscar. Ralph Fiennes as the adult Micheal Berg, is good, but not great. He seems to be trying too hard, to convey sorrowful angst. David Kross plays the young Micheal Berg, and his performance shows an incredible emotional fluency. He too, should win an Oscar.The bleak, murky city streets of Berlin, set the emotional tone for the movie. There's always a feeling of heavy gloom, running throughout the course of this film. The racy sex scenes between Hannah and young Michael, manage to temporarily jolt the viewer out of the somber mood that cloaks the film. The full-frontal nude scenes of young Micheal, are alarming though, especially since he's a minor. The producers probably thought that explicit male nudity is hip. It just winds up being tasteless and seedy, in this film.The main reason to view this film, is Kate Winslet. This has got to be the best performance, of her already stellar career. The movie is depressing overall.

The Winslet character, betrayed in a lawcourt by the lies of her former SS group, nevertheless goes on to accept the role of fall guy and the harshest possible sentence for a reason that will probably strike most reasonable moviegoers, upon reflection, as frivolous at best. Coupled with this specious action is the unexplained reticence of her former lover, who posseses information that would serve to get her a markedly reduced sentence, one equal to that of the others of her group. Being of the postwar generation, is this young man not forthcoming in order to show off his disgust at the role she played in the infamous German past, or is he just ticked off at her sudden disappearance years earlier from his life? Rather than emerging as a richly secretive figure with ambiguous motives, he, like Winslet, is finally just an outline David Hare for whatever reason, chose not to fill in.Unlike some reviewers, I have no objection to the decision to present the members of the former SS group as having individual differences, or to show the Winslet character as both sinning and finally - to an infinitely smaller degree - sinned against. But the absence of any rich interiority in her character renders this just a strategy of an author's mind and not a source finally for any intellectual or emotional wallop.

1228966,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B001PPLJIQ,Steve,"[2, 2]","The Reader is a provocative and heartbreaking film which tells the tale of a May-September affair between Hanna (Kate Winslet) and 15 year-old Michael (David Kross) in the decade after WWII. Beyond that, however, I believe the film is an allegory of the relationship between those Germans who were responsible for the Holocaust and those loved ones who came after them, and were forced to confront the horrible truths at a later time. It deals with the guilt, the anger, and the conflicting emotions therein. The story is heartbreaking because it reminds us that we are all struggling with guilt, emotions, and the legacy we have created for ourselves by our actions or inactions. It neither asks the viewer to forgive nor condemn. It merely shows us how similar we are to these people by putting their humanity in our faces.The movie is provocative for both the many nude/sex scenes between Michael and Hanna, and because it purposefully makes it a bit harder to blame or label, not only those responsible for the Holocaust, but all of the people in our history who have a connection between an evil deed and tacit complicity, regardless of the severity.  There is a powerful moment during the trial when a confused Hanna is questioned about her responsibilities as a guard and she innocently asks one of the judges, ""What would you do?"" None of the judges has an answer. Throughout all of history's atrocities, there are always those who were simply ""doing their job."" It's so easy to imagine being the heroic person who would stand up a make a difference, but the fact is, few possess that much courage and conviction.Many recoil at the sexual perversity, but I think the intention was to make the audience uncomfortable. Not only did Hanna's seduction help create a person who would end up sharing her emotional void, but so too did the generation responsible for the Nazi atrocities force their shame onto the generation that followed them. The beauty of The Reader for me was in how these characters can speak for generations; the passion, the heartbreak, the guilt, the shame, the anger, and the eventual cold-blooded detachment.The acting is stellar throughout, with special props going to Kate Winslet and David Kross for their fearless portrayals and for breathing such believability into their characters. To engender empathy for people who run the gamut from despicable to emotionally empty is a nod to their acting skill. To compel me to watch the drama of such unsavory individuals is a testament to the power of this movie. The Reader might disturb you, anger you, disgust you, or even confuse you. Certainly one of the principal responsibilities for art is to provoke such reactions.P.S. I don't usually include info about the dvd extras, but since I watched them this afternoon, I thought I'd add a sentence or five. There are about a handful or so, focusing on the set design with a German woman who had left her native country during the post WWII period to get away from the drama, a lengthy bit with Kate Winslet getting into her older make-up, an interview with Kross and the director, and a bit with the music director.

1228967,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B001PPLJIQ,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","The Reader is set in Germany and the opening scene takes place in 1958. Michael Berg (Kross) is 15 years old and becomes ill on his way home from school. He's helped by Hanna Schmitz (Winslet), who cleans up his mess and ensures that he makes it home. Three months later, he's well enough to go and thank her, and they begin a brief, but intense affair.Hanna appears moody and is quick to anger, but it doesn't usually last for long. There are some fairly graphic sex scenes, although the behavior does fit the characters well. Hanna loves having Michael read to her and it becomes part of his visits. She insists that he read before they have sex.After a while, the affair ends and Michael isn't sure why Hanna left. We see him moving on with his life and studying law in college. Part of his course involves a trip to see a real trial and Michael is stunned to see Hanna among a group of six women who are being charged with war crimes. I only mention this because it's revealed in the trailer. The Reader is not a war film, it's a character study of the effects war can have on people throughout their lives.Imagine being in that situation. Your first experience of sex is something you never forget. It's a very intense memory because it's tied to strong emotions. Michael has a dilemma because he has a piece of information which would help Hanna's case. The problem is, she hasn't volunteered the information herself. Should he allow her to make that decision, or should he present the evidence to ensure that justice is done?The story frequently jumps from 1958 and 1966 to 1995, where Michael (Fiennes plays the older version) is now a successful lawyer. We see how his experience as a child has affected his life. He's unwilling to allow people to get close to him, whether it's a sexual partner or his own daughter.I'm not going to reveal any more of the story because it would ruin the experience if you're watching it for the first time.The acting is superb throughout. Winslet won the Oscar for her performance which spanned 30 years of Hanna's life. It can't have been an easy part to play with the frequent nudity and the strong subject matter. I don't think I have seen a better Winslet performance. Fiennes and Kross are also convincing as Michael Berg. Michael's college professor is played by the always excellent Bruno Ganz, and I loved his subtle performance.If you enjoy good writing and emotional drama with fully-developed characters, The Reader is worth your time.",5,Winslet at her best,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2489,"['Reader', 'set', 'Germany', 'opening', 'scene', 'place', '1958', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'Kross', '15', 'years', 'old', 'ill', 'way', 'home', 'school', 'helped', 'Hanna', 'Schmitz', 'Winslet', 'who', 'up', 'mess', 'home', 'Three', 'months', 'later', 'well', 'enough', 'go', 'thank', 'begin', 'brief', 'intense', 'affair.Hanna', 'moody', 'quick', 'anger', ""n't"", 'usually', 'last', 'long', 'are', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'behavior', 'fit', 'characters', 'well', 'Hanna', 'having', 'Michael', 'read', 'part', 'visits', 'read', 'have', 'sex.After', 'while', 'affair', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'sure', 'why', 'Hanna', 'left', 'see', 'moving', 'life', 'studying', 'law', 'college', 'Part', 'course', 'trip', 'see', 'real', 'trial', 'Michael', 'stunned', 'see', 'Hanna', 'group', 'six', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'charged', 'war', 'crimes', 'only', 'mention', 'revealed', 'trailer', 'Reader', 'not', 'war', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'effects', 'war', 'can', 'have', 'people', 'lives.Imagine', 'being', 'situation', 'first', 'experience', 'sex', 'something', 'never', 'forget', 'very', 'intense', 'memory', 'tied', 'strong', 'emotions', 'Michael', 'dilemma', 'piece', 'information', 'would', 'help', 'Hanna', 'case', 'problem', ""n't"", 'volunteered', 'information', 'Should', 'allow', 'make', 'decision', 'should', 'present', 'evidence', 'ensure', 'justice', 'done', 'story', 'frequently', '1958', '1966', '1995', 'where', 'Michael', 'Fiennes', 'older', 'version', 'now', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'see', 'how', 'experience', 'child', 'affected', 'life', 'unwilling', 'allow', 'people', 'get', 'close', 'sexual', 'partner', 'own', 'daughter.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'more', 'story', 'would', 'ruin', 'experience', ""'re"", 'watching', 'first', 'time.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'Winslet', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'spanned', '30', 'years', 'Hanna', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'part', 'play', 'frequent', 'nudity', 'strong', 'subject', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'Fiennes', 'Kross', 'are', 'also', 'convincing', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'Michael', 'college', 'professor', 'played', 'always', 'excellent', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'loved', 'subtle', 'performance.If', 'enjoy', 'good', 'writing', 'emotional', 'drama', 'fully-developed', 'characters', 'Reader', 'time']",N/A

And it covered, surprisingly for me, a topic that I have grown interested in--WWII and how distorted that period of  history has become and how people can't even talk about it rationally. I was very surprised at how the movie showed a woman in Germany who was 1) not a jew 2) not a nazi and 3) not a spy. How it was a movie about an ordinary Germain woman in WWII making her way in the world . . . trying to make a living. To see the world through her virgin eyes was very very well portrayed in this movie. And the relationship was great. I think the way the story was written to show the boy being human and feeling when he first met her, his brainwashing/indoctrination at college, and the tug of war he goes through at the end to be human again but still want to fit into the politically charge world still was greatly done. The subject matter was very unexpected by me. I thought this was about something totally different.

These two people somehow connect love-making to reading.She wants to be read to from all the works of literature, mainly German literature with a smattering of Russian and Greek(certainly not DHL!).There is also a 21 year age gap-illicit in our culture-maybe not so in Germany.She leaves 15 year old Michael because of this sense of shame, as well as refusing a promotion at work as a conductor on the buses due to her illiteracy.In the Nazi period she worked as a female guard in a concentration camp.In the present(the 50s) she has been indicted in a war crimes trial, when she was responsible for not letting Jews escape from a burning church.She is too ashamed to admit her illiteracy in court and is implicated as guilty in an action against the Jews.I was taken with Winslet's well-scrubbed performance.David Kross was superb as the young man lover,who as a law student years later, becomes aware of the truth, but can't admit it without showing to the legal team he had a relationship with her.Ralph Fiennes is too wooden as the older narrator but serviceable.The cinematography is excellent(Deakins),and recreated the look and feel of post-war Germany.I think the film would have been done better as a German-made film with English subtitles,German actors.As a German actor and English actress seem wrong(tho' Winslet's accent's ok).We see no images of the holocaust and we are far removed from it,only calling up an incident in which Winslet is involved.The theme is of guilt by association:uncles,fathers,mothers,grandparents.The people the next generation came from, and could the younger generation have done things differently? What would they have done as Hannah asks the judge.The film is worthy and better than most others,but there's a hollowness at it's heart that left me cold. Could this woman love like she did and be more ashamed of her admission to illiteracy than her obedience to acts of evil? Evil is evil however you paint it.The clever lawyer has made an act of atonement on behalf of Germans who became implicated by the heinous acts of the Nazis by being there.Berg sends her tapes of books she's heard and loved,he does this to expiate a pettiness:he does not reveal until they are much older, who is sending them and his refusal to acknowledge her at the time of the trial, and in a more human way of touch,when they meet again.",4,This side of good and evil,1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,2813,"['had', 'read', 'book', 'years', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'unsatisfactoriness', 'then.It', 'was', 'first', 'love', 'story', 'yoked', 'subject', 'post-war', 'generation', 'reaction', 'Holocaust.It', 'reads', 'finely', 'worked', 'legal', 'document', 'Shlink', 'had', 'worked', 'judge', 'perpetrator', 'Hannah', 'more', 'implicated', 'illiteracy', 'evil.She', 'loves', 'being', 'read', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'stories', 'not', 'admit', 'illiterate', 'two', 'people', 'somehow', 'connect', 'love-making', 'reading.She', 'be', 'read', 'works', 'literature', 'mainly', 'German', 'literature', 'smattering', 'Russian', 'Greek', 'certainly', 'not', 'DHL', 'also', '21', 'year', 'age', 'gap-illicit', 'culture-maybe', 'not', 'so', 'Germany.She', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Michael', 'sense', 'shame', 'as', 'well', 'refusing', 'promotion', 'work', 'conductor', 'buses', 'due', 'illiteracy.In', 'Nazi', 'period', 'worked', 'female', 'guard', 'concentration', 'present', '50s', 'been', 'indicted', 'war', 'trial', 'when', 'was', 'responsible', 'not', 'letting', 'Jews', 'escape', 'burning', 'church.She', 'too', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'illiteracy', 'court', 'implicated', 'guilty', 'action', 'Jews.I', 'was', 'taken', 'Winslet', 'well-scrubbed', 'performance.David', 'Kross', 'was', 'superb', 'young', 'man', 'lover', 'who', 'law', 'student', 'years', 'later', 'aware', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admit', 'showing', 'legal', 'team', 'had', 'relationship', 'her.Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'too', 'wooden', 'older', 'narrator', 'serviceable.The', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'Deakins', 'recreated', 'look', 'feel', 'post-war', 'Germany.I', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'German-made', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'German', 'actors.As', 'German', 'actor', 'English', 'actress', 'seem', 'wrong', 'tho', 'Winslet', 'accent', 'ok', '.We', 'see', 'images', 'holocaust', 'are', 'far', 'removed', 'only', 'calling', 'up', 'incident', 'Winslet', 'involved.The', 'theme', 'guilt', 'association', 'uncles', 'fathers', 'mothers', 'grandparents.The', 'people', 'next', 'generation', 'came', 'could', 'younger', 'generation', 'have', 'done', 'things', 'differently', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Hannah', 'judge.The', 'film', 'worthy', 'better', 'most', 'others', 'hollowness', 'heart', 'left', 'cold', 'Could', 'woman', 'love', 'did', 'be', 'more', 'ashamed', 'admission', 'illiteracy', 'obedience', 'acts', 'evil', 'Evil', 'evil', 'however', 'paint', 'it.The', 'clever', 'lawyer', 'made', 'act', 'atonement', 'behalf', 'Germans', 'who', 'became', 'implicated', 'heinous', 'acts', 'Nazis', 'being', 'there.Berg', 'tapes', 'books', 'heard', 'loved', 'expiate', 'pettiness', 'not', 'reveal', 'are', 'much', 'older', 'who', 'sending', 'refusal', 'acknowledge', 'time', 'trial', 'more', 'human', 'way', 'touch', 'when', 'meet', 'again']",N/A

1228982,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B001PPLJIQ,Terence Allen,"[0, 0]","""The Reader"" is a wonderful, poignant film that asks and does not try to answer tough questions, and leaves the viewer moved beyond words.In late fifties' Germany, Michael, a 15 year-old boy crosses paths with Hanna, an engimatic, thirtyish tram car employee played by Kate Winslet. They quickly begin an affair. The affair is marked by torrid lovemaking, and Hanna's constant request for the boy to read to her. The affair runs the course of a summer, and then Hanna disappears. Years later, as a law student attending a trial for class, Michael is shocked to see that Hanna is on trial along with several other women for being a concentration camp guard.From here, the movie asks those questions that don't have answers, or if they do have answers, they are difficult ones. What is the nature of evil? How do you separate duty and decency? Is there is any secret worth losing your freedom, even your life?The performances here defy description. Kate Winslet continues to confirm that she is one of the best actors of this or any other generation with an astounding, fearless performance that will undoubtedly rank as one of her alltime best. Her Hanna is rife with contradictions, and seems to gain and lose sympathy and humanity with rapidity. Ralph Fiennes continues to build his career at risk of typecasting by often playing emotionally repressed characters, and his adult Michael, whose memories set the film in motion, is heartbreaking in his inability to have any joy or communicate love and affection. And David Kross gives a splendid performance as the young Michael, whos goes through the gamut of emotions as he lives and learns hard lessons through his relationship with Hanna.This film belongs on the top ten list of 2008's films.

Throughout much of the early portions of the film viewers are treated to relatively graphic nudity for both Kate Winslet and the young man (David Kross) that plays the younger version of Ralph Fiennes.The film covers the tale of Hanna (Winslet) and Michael (Fiennes/Kross) and their relationship and lives.  The setting is NOT World War II, but is actually post WWII, starting in 1958, as well as portions set in the 60's and 70's, up thru the 1990's.Rather than spoiling the story, I'll stop providing details on the story there, and simply say it is quite interesting.  The story is based on a best-seller by Bernhard Schlink, and the filmed version features an award winning performance by Kate Winslet (Academy Award and Golden Globe).  On Blu-ray the film looks beautiful showing excellent detail and clarity.  The audio quality is also excellent though the film is not an action-thriller and doesn't feature the typical booming explosions and sound effects.Most definitely worth viewing, but again not something that most families would screen around younger family members.  The R rating is most definitely deserved for the graphic nudity.  The language is actually surprising clean as the film focuses on the story rather than mixing in profanity just for shock value.

It decreases the most potent revelations and resides on a powerful love that was successfully sustained only during the beginning. Once again the order of events are jumbled on the timeline and an unexpectedly long ending detracts from the impact of the most poignant moments, not least of which is an undying love story that overshadows the historical importance of the war crime trials that set up a heartbreaking reunion.In 1958 West Germany 15-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross) is escorted home by a mysterious woman after becoming ill. Diagnosed with scarlet fever and bedridden for three months, he eventually seeks out Hanna (Kate Winslet) to thank her for her aid. Soon the two begin an unlikely (and very graphic) affair that lasts the duration of the summer - Hanna is distant and uncompassionate, but Michael finds himself hopelessly in love (he insists on knowing her name by the third day they are together). Before each sexual tryst Michael reads to Hanna - starting with his school assignments; a German play, Homer's Odyssey, Huckleberry Finn, The Lady with the Little Dog and eventually he even reads comic strips.One day Hanna vanishes, and Michael is left to return to school, study law, and carry on relationships with people his own age. In 1966, while attending a trial for German guard crimes against Jewish prisoners, he spies Hanna as one of the defendants, who had become involved with the SS shortly after ending their affair. Years later, torn between remembering the great flame they shared and condemning her for her crimes, Michael is haunted by the trial and determined to sort out his feelings of guilt and love.It's certainly a unique angle to show a sympathetic lead character toward Holocaust involvement. As author Bernhard Schlink wrote about his novel, on which the film is based, ""The Reader is not a story about redemption or forgiveness. It is about how my generation of Germans came to terms with what the generation before us had done."" He challenges the viewer with transcending guilt, the ability to choose love and the complexity of monstrous actions undertaken by ordinary people. The film is splendidly emotional and comes very close to being phenomenal. The drawn out conclusion is a meditation on the power of love and its ability to overcome exceptionally trying junctures - and even to overcome time itself. Morally devastating but not emotionally involving enough to attain instant masterpiece status, The Reader still boasts outstanding performances, a beautiful score and a moving tale of complex affection.- Mike Massie",4,The Reader Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,2814,"['Reader', 'brilliant', 'start', 'convincing', 'characters', 'superb', 'acting', 'looming', 'tragedy', 'lose', 'sure', 'footing', 'conclusion', 'partly', 'carelessly', 'planned', 'mainly', 'lacking', 'direction', 'most', 'potent', 'revelations', 'resides', 'powerful', 'love', 'was', 'successfully', 'sustained', 'only', 'beginning', 'Once', 'again', 'order', 'events', 'are', 'jumbled', 'timeline', 'unexpectedly', 'long', 'ending', 'detracts', 'impact', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'not', 'least', 'undying', 'love', 'story', 'historical', 'importance', 'war', 'crime', 'trials', 'set', 'up', 'heartbreaking', 'reunion.In', '1958', 'West', 'Germany', '15-year-old', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'David', 'Kross', 'escorted', 'home', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'becoming', 'ill', 'Diagnosed', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'bedridden', 'three', 'months', 'eventually', 'out', 'Hanna', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'thank', 'aid', 'two', 'begin', 'unlikely', 'very', 'graphic', 'affair', 'duration', 'summer', 'Hanna', 'distant', 'uncompassionate', 'Michael', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'knowing', 'name', 'third', 'day', 'are', 'together', 'sexual', 'tryst', 'Michael', 'Hanna', 'starting', 'school', 'assignments', 'German', 'play', 'Homer', 'Odyssey', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'Lady', 'Little', 'Dog', 'eventually', 'even', 'comic', 'strips.One', 'day', 'Hanna', 'vanishes', 'Michael', 'left', 'return', 'school', 'study', 'law', 'carry', 'relationships', 'people', 'own', 'age', '1966', 'attending', 'trial', 'German', 'guard', 'crimes', 'Jewish', 'prisoners', 'Hanna', 'one', 'defendants', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'involved', 'SS', 'shortly', 'ending', 'affair', 'Years', 'later', 'torn', 'remembering', 'great', 'flame', 'shared', 'condemning', 'crimes', 'Michael', 'haunted', 'trial', 'determined', 'sort', 'out', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'love.It', 'certainly', 'unique', 'angle', 'show', 'sympathetic', 'lead', 'character', 'Holocaust', 'involvement', 'author', 'Bernhard', 'Schlink', 'wrote', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'Reader', 'not', 'story', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'how', 'generation', 'Germans', 'came', 'terms', 'what', 'generation', 'had', 'done', 'viewer', 'transcending', 'guilt', 'ability', 'choose', 'love', 'complexity', 'monstrous', 'actions', 'undertaken', 'ordinary', 'people', 'film', 'splendidly', 'emotional', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'phenomenal', 'drawn', 'conclusion', 'meditation', 'power', 'love', 'ability', 'overcome', 'exceptionally', 'trying', 'junctures', 'even', 'overcome', 'time', 'Morally', 'devastating', 'not', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'enough', 'attain', 'instant', 'masterpiece', 'status', 'Reader', 'still', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'score', 'moving', 'tale', 'complex', 'affection.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

You got much more of the male lead's inner thoughts and emotions about the overwhelming guilt of the Holocaust on the German generation that followed World War II.  How do you ask your father what he did during that dark and evil time?  How do you look at the generation before you and not wonder how many of them participated in that black mark on humanity?But I was left at the end of the book wondering about went on inside Hanna's brain.  Could there have been scenes where the Ralph Fiennes character confronts her, questions her, gets the whole story?  Well, there wasn't much of that in the book and there's even less in the movie.  The scenes between the adult Michael and his elderly former lover are nearly without any dialogue at all.  I was left wondering if Hanna's final actions in the end were because of her monstrous past or the dry, perfunctory way in which Michael treats her (she realizes that she may have damaged this kid's relationship for life).  I didn't see much of an answer for myself.Then I read an article written by an angry critic who resents the recent Hollywood films that attempt to rehabilate the German people for the Holocaust.  VALKYRIE was given as another example (did the Tom Cruise character wish to assassinate Hitler because of his evil crimes against humanity--or because Germany was by then losing the war?).  The complaint against THE READER was that Hanna is given a pass, so to speak, because of her illiteracy--yet she knew what was happening at the camps.  Are we supposed to feel more sorry for her than the millions sent to their deaths in the Nazi death machine?  It's a sticky point and the guilt of that terrible time will go on for generations.But I liked the movie.  I wish it had gone farther in playing out the confrontation of evil between the generations, between the lovers, between each person in the story.Worth seeing.

1228995,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001PPLJIQ,Turfseer,"[19, 33]","'The Reader' begins in West Germany in 1958. Michael Berg hails from a grim-faced German family and is ready to sow his adolescent oats. Hanna Schmitz, former SS concentration guard now turned streetcar conductor, brings Michael back to her apartment after he's not feeling well. Hanna gives Michael a bath and before you know it she's playing sex therapist to the impressionable teenager. The affair lasts a scant month or so but on screen it feels like an interminable couple of years.While Hanna is tender showing Michael new sexual positions, she is unable to control those flashes of temper (foreshadowing the revelation of a very nasty past!). Michael ends up reading various classic novels he's been reading at school to Hanna and she hides a deep dark secret that she is actually illiterate! One day Michael comes over to Hanna's apartment and she's disappeared.Flash forward to 1966. Michael is now a law student in Heidelberg. As part of a class trip, he attends a war crimes trial and finds Hanna in the docket, accused of unimaginable horrors as a Nazi concentration camp guard. Initially, Hanna denies she's the ringleader of a group of female guards responsible for an atrocity where they prevent a group of Jewish prisoners, locked inside a burning church, from escaping. Prosecutors insist that a document ordering the atrocity is in Hanna's handwriting. Hanna won't give up her dark secret of being illiterate and falsely confesses, taking the rap for her fellow Nazis. It costs her big time: a sentence of life in prison.The first half of 'The Reader' is slow-moving, the erotic scenes are repetitious and there's no central antagonist unless you count what's going on in Michael's confused mind. In a slightly more interesting second half, we meet an all grown up Michael (played by a grim-faced Ralph Fiennes). He's alienated and cut off from his emotions evidenced by his inability to bond with his daughter. Obviously he is still troubled by his relationship with Hanna even after all these years.So Michael decides to record the famous novels he used to read to Hanna in the old days on cassette tapes. Soon, Hanna is devouring the tapes and over the years finally learns to read comparing the tape narrations to books she's taken out in the prison library. Hanna writes to Michael but he won't write back (even though he still has feelings for her the idea of writing to a convicted former SS guard is something a good German should not do).Finally Hanna is about to be released but she has no family to help on the outside. Will Michael come and help her get set up with her own apartment? After initially balking, Michael changes his mind and meets Hanna in the prison cafeteria where he informs her that he's taken care of the apartment. But Michael asks her in effect does she feel any remorse for her actions as a Nazi? All she can that she is happy she's learned to read. As for the atrocities--there's nothing she can do about it now. Michael isn't happy with the answer but he'll still help her. But Hanna must pay the price in terms of the audience. No remorse = the need for some kind of punishment (Nazis must be punished!) So what does she do? On the day of her release, Hanna hangs herself. But she leaves a makeshift will, donating the rest of her cash to one of the Holocaust survivors, a woman who testified against her at the trial.In the best scene in the movie (and most truthful) Michael visits the Holocaust survivor in the United States where he informs her of Hanna's wishes. She doesn't want Hanna's money and tells Michael if he wants drama he should go to the theater and not dwell on concentration camps where no positive life lessons can be learned. Still Michael suggests donating the money to an illiteracy campaign and the Holocaust survivor won't stand in his way.Flash forward to 1995. Michael has overcome his demons and he's ready to tell the whole story of Hanna to his daughter as they pass Hanna's headstone in a church cemetery.Although the Reader is not a very dramatic or even good movie, it still is fascinating because its main focus is on the whole issue of German guilt. The movie is based on a novel written by a German writer, Bernhard Schlink, who is grappling with years of guilt feelings over the Holocaust. He's saying in effect, 'Hey, we Germans aren't that bad. Can you forgive us?' Schlink (and the Reader's screenwriter, David Hare) present two characters that don't mince words (the aforementioned daughter of the Holocaust survivor at the end of the movie and a young law student who points out that Hanna and her co-defendants are scapegoats since there were thousands who went unpunished).But while Schlink can face German responsibility for the Holocaust, he can do so only up to a point. His guilt leads to such confusion that Hanna is presented as a tragic figure, done in by ignorance. During the trial, it was her compulsive need for order that prevents her from allowing the prisoners to escape (however more typically, Nazis on trial would say they were ""only following orders"").'The Reader' gives the wrong impression that Hanna was somehow not responsible for her actions--that somehow by being ignorant, deep down she wasn't a bad person. In this way Schlink and Hare sugarcoat their antagonist. The vast majority of Nazis were not illiterate, ignorant people--they knew exactly what they were doing and they, along with the German people, followed Hitler with gusto.The generation of post-war Germans don't have to apologize for 'the sins of their fathers' nor feel guilt. They merely have to study history with clear and detached eyes in order to make sure things like this never happen again.",2,More atonement than drama,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,5688,"[""'The"",

The overall storyline of THE READER is kind of depressing. There's the whole great lost-love aspect of the film; a love between two people so great that it affects a person so much that he is never able to really love again for the rest of his life.  There's also the shadow of WW2 and the Holocaust that permeates the entire picture.  Lastly, there's also the issue about watching a person being convicted (though being guilty of other horrible crimes) for a crime which she wasn't directly responsible. These are very heavy issues and it doesn't make THE READER an easy film to watch (though I have to admit Kate Winslet helps to make the drama easier to take).  Despite this, the issues the film raises are important and ones everyone should think about now and again.  For instance, if you have evidence that someone did not commit a crime they are being tried for, yet they are responsible for other acts of evil, what would you do? What should you do? What is your duty as a citizen in such? What is the humane thing to do?Besides the beautiful presence of Winslet, some of the drama in THE READER is easier to bear because of the lovely scenery and great cinematography.  There are moments that this motion picture seems to stop and the action on the screen seems to become a portrait of life captured in a moment of time.  Sometimes art-house type films (which THE READER is--though a very popular one) use good cinematography to cover up for a weak script or bad acting. That's not the case with this movie and instead of distracting from the action of the movie, these elements enhances it.Though there are moments of happiness and vitality, THE READER is not a happy movie and, therefore, will not appeal to some people.  However, if you don't mind a deep-message movie full of drama and great acting with beautiful scenery and cinematography, then you might want to take a couple hours out of an evening and spend time with THE READER.",5,"Lost Love, the Holocaust, and Dangling With Redemption",1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,2265,"['Kate', 'Winslet', 'David', 'Kross', 'star', 'THE', 'READER', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'set', 'three', 'time', 'periods', 'young', 'teenager', 'named', 'Michael', 'David', 'Kross', 'who', 'love', 'affair', 'older', 'woman', 'named', 'Hannah', 'Schmitz', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'pre-WWII', 'Germany', 'how', 'relationship', 'young', 'boy', 'forever', 'overall', 'storyline', 'THE', 'READER', 'kind', 'depressing', 'whole', 'great', 'lost-love', 'aspect', 'film', 'love', 'two', 'people', 'so', 'great', 'person', 'so', 'much', 'never', 'able', 'really', 'love', 'again', 'rest', 'life', 'also', 'shadow', 'WW2', 'Holocaust', 'entire', 'picture', 'Lastly', 'also', 'issue', 'watching', 'person', 'being', 'convicted', 'being', 'guilty', 'other', 'horrible', 'crimes', 'crime', 'was', ""n't"", 'directly', 'responsible', 'are', 'very', 'heavy', 'issues', ""n't"", 'make', 'THE', 'READER', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'have', 'admit', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'make', 'drama', 'easier', 'take', 'issues', 'film', 'raises', 'are', 'important', 'ones', 'everyone', 'should', 'think', 'now', 'again', 'instance', 'have', 'evidence', 'someone', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'crime', 'are', 'being', 'tried', 'yet', 'are', 'responsible', 'other', 'acts', 'evil', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'What', 'should', 'do', 'What', 'duty', 'citizen', 'such', 'What', 'humane', 'thing', 'do', 'beautiful', 'presence', 'Winslet', 'drama', 'THE', 'READER', 'easier', 'bear', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'great', 'cinematography', 'are', 'moments', 'motion', 'picture', 'stop', 'action', 'screen', 'become', 'portrait', 'life', 'captured', 'moment', 'time', 'Sometimes', 'art-house', 'type', 'films', 'READER', 'very', 'popular', 'one', 'use', 'good', 'cinematography', 'cover', 'up', 'weak', 'script', 'bad', 'acting', 'not', 'case', 'movie', 'instead', 'distracting', 'action', 'movie', 'elements', 'are', 'moments', 'happiness', 'vitality', 'READER', 'not', 'happy', 'movie', 'therefore', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'people', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'deep-message', 'movie', 'full', 'drama', 'great', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'couple', 'hours', 'evening', 'spend', 'time', 'READER']",N/A

1229000,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B001PPLJIQ,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[2, 7]","This is a tough film to review. Immediately after watching it, the first though that sprung to mind was- do I like this or not? I couldn't tell. I know I didn't hate it, but I couldn't figure out how I really felt about it. After stewing it over for a while, I came to the conclusion that I did like it, but I certainly didn't love it. It is a difficult film to care for, perhaps because every character comes off as irritating and/or irrational and/or pitiful. The list goes on.This is not a Holocaust film. I really wish people would stop calling it that. In fact, the earliest date in the film is over 10 years after WW2 ended. This does reference aspects of the Holocaust, specifically a certain concentration camp and what occured there with Kate Winslet's character Hanna Schmitz.The movie takes place in three acts. The first is certainly the best. There we meet Hanna and a boy named Michael Berg, played maturely by David Kross. He is very young, either 15 or 16, I can't remember. She is in her thirties. To make a long story short- they begin to have an affair. She awakens in him passion and sexuality, and being a teenager, he can't get enough of it, or her. After a while, she tells him that before they can make love, he must read a book to her. He agrees and they fall into a pattern. They both seem content for a while until one day, Michael goes to her flat, and finds that she has moved.He moves on and goes on to college where we find he is studying to be a lawyer. This is where Act 2 goes into play and really all the heavy angsty stuff emerges. His professor takes the class to see an actual court case where Michael finds the defendant is none other than Hanna. She, and several other women, are on trial for crimes commited during the Holocaust.Michael is stunned and watches the proceedings in morbid fascination, while simultaneously feeling pained, saddended and probably betrayed and/or disgusted. He discovers a terrible truth then and must decided what he should do with that particular bit of information. Here is the part of the film where my thoughts became confused and jumbled. I will not go into the plot further for that would be to spoil everything, but I can say I found it odd and once again, irritating.The last act is by far the weakest. We see a grown-up Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes living his life. We actually see him periodically throughout the film, in flashbacks, well in this case, flash forwards. Again, so as not to spoil the plot, I'll just say that I personally didn't care for the latter part of the film and while I can't say I hated it, it left a sour taste in my mouth.The acting is superb. Kate has her well-deserved oscar and I am just thrilled for her. She completely deserved it. Though she won for best actress, I must stress that, for the most part, I saw her as more of a supporting role, even though she is the biggest female role of the film. I can't really explain my thinking-it's better to see it for yourself. Fiennes does a wonderful job as usual.

1229001,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B001PPLJIQ,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[0, 1]","Last night I streamed free on Amazon Prime, The Reader. It was a movie that I had not seen at the theater when it was released in 2008. I really like Kate Winslet, so I thought I would watch it to see why she won an Oscar for her performance.First off, I will admit I did not read any reviews or synopsis of the movie beforehand. I hit play in total ignorance. Yes, it's a bit shocking that a woman, who was probably in her early 30's, had an affair with a 15-year old boy. However, had I turned it off,  claiming it was nothing more than a sickly and vile movie about pedophilia, I would have missed an intriguing story that turned out to be quite a surprise.I will give a few insights as to the story, without spoiling the ending. It starts out with Ralph Fiennes, who plays the adult version of Michael Berg reminiscing about the past. Set in 1958 post-WWII Germany, it tells the story of a teenager who is helped by Hanna Schmidt, a young woman, when he becomes ill with Scarlet Fever. After his recovery, he returns to thank her, but to his surprise she seduces him and an affair ensues.Hanna is a woman that at first you really know nothing about, other than she enjoys two things with Michael - sex and the fact that he reads books to her during his visits. Strange as it seems,they fall in love until one day she mysteriously disappears without a word and breaks his heart.Fast forward to Michael's days at university as he studies to be a lawyer. His professor takes the class to sit in on the the war crime trials. To his surprise, Hanna is a defendant, along with a group of other women, for her participation as a guard at a Nazi concentration camp. Day after day he attends the hearings, listening to the crimes she committed during the war and then realizes something about Hanna that no one else knows. The fact could lessen her sentence, but Michael cannot reconcile the horrors of her actions in helping to kill the Jews. What he knows, he keeps silent, and her sentence is life in prison compared to a paltry four years for the other women involved in the same crimes.The movie is one of conscience as the younger generation deals with the guilt of the older generation and the crimes committed to humanity in WWII. Michael takes a sobering visit to Auschwitz to see for himself where she worked as a guard. Hurt and brooding for the woman he once loved, he makes the choice not to help her avoid her punishment regardless of the secret she has held from everyone, which Hanna refuses to admit to even at her trial. Her shame regarding that one fact is greater than the shame of being a guard during the war and her participation as a murderer.In the end, the story reverts to Michael as an adult and the guilt and feelings he has wrestled with throughout his life regarding Hanna. The movie is an interesting and thought-provoking story that reaches far more than the risque first half of an older woman having sex with an under-aged boy. David Kross looks very young in the part, but the sexual explicit scenes were not filmed until he turned 18 years of age.If you're looking for a sobering movie regarding love, morality, secrets, and consequences of one's actions, this is a good flick. Kate's achievement in winning an Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and many other awards for her portrayal of Hanna are well deserved and worth the watch.",4,Thought-Provoking Theme Regarding the Sins of Another Generation,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,3358,"['Last', 'night', 'streamed', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Reader', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'released', '2008', 'really', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'thought', 'would', 'watch', 'see', 'why', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance.First', 'will', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'beforehand', 'hit', 'play', 'total', 'ignorance', 'Yes', 'bit', 'shocking', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'early', '30', 'had', 'affair', '15-year', 'old', 'boy', 'However', 'had', 'turned', 'off', 'claiming', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'sickly', 'vile', 'movie', 'pedophilia', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'intriguing', 'story', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'surprise.I', 'will', 'give', 'few', 'insights', 'story', 'spoiling', 'ending', 'out', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'adult', 'version', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'reminiscing', 'past', 'Set', '1958', 'post-WWII', 'Germany', 'story', 'teenager', 'who', 'helped', 'Hanna', 'Schmidt', 'young', 'woman', 'when', 'ill', 'Scarlet', 'Fever', 'recovery', 'thank', 'surprise', 'affair', 'ensues.Hanna', 'woman', 'first', 'really', 'know', 'nothing', 'other', 'two', 'things', 'Michael', 'sex', 'fact', 'books', 'visits', 'Strange', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'day', 'mysteriously', 'word', 'breaks', 'heart.Fast', 'forward', 'Michael', 'days', 'university', 'studies', 'be', 'lawyer', 'professor', 'class', 'sit', 'war', 'crime', 'trials', 'surprise', 'Hanna', 'defendant', 'group', 'other', 'women', 'participation', 'guard', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Day', 'day', 'hearings', 'listening', 'crimes', 'committed', 'war', 'then', 'realizes', 'something', 'Hanna', 'one', 'else', 'fact', 'could', 'lessen', 'sentence', 'Michael', 'can', 'not', 'reconcile', 'horrors', 'actions', 'helping', 'kill', 'Jews', 'What', 'silent', 'sentence', 'life', 'prison', 'compared', 'paltry', 'four', 'years', 'other', 'women', 'involved', 'same', 'crimes.The', 'movie', 'one', 'conscience', 'younger', 'generation', 'deals', 'guilt', 'older', 'generation', 'crimes', 'committed', 'humanity', 'WWII', 'Michael', 'sobering', 'visit', 'Auschwitz', 'see', 'where', 'worked', 'guard', 'Hurt', 'brooding', 'woman', 'once', 'loved', 'choice', 'not', 'help', 'avoid', 'punishment', 'regardless', 'secret', 'held', 'everyone', 'Hanna', 'admit', 'even', 'trial', 'shame', 'regarding', 'one', 'fact', 'greater', 'shame', 'being', 'guard', 'war', 'participation', 'murderer.In', 'end', 'story', 'Michael', 'adult', 'guilt', 'feelings', 'wrestled', 'life', 'regarding', 'Hanna', 'movie', 'interesting', 'thought-provoking', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'risque', 'first', 'half', 'older', 'woman', 'having', 'sex', 'under-aged', 'boy', 'David', 'Kross', 'very', 'young', 'part', 'sexual', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'filmed', 'turned', '18', 'years', 'age.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'sobering', 'movie', 'regarding', 'love', 'morality', 'secrets', 'consequences', 'one', 'actions', 'good', 'flick', 'Kate', 'achievement', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'BAFTA', 'many', 'other', 'awards', 'portrayal', 'Hanna', 'are', 'well', 'deserved', 'watch']",N/A

The tracking shots drag on a bit longer than necessary, and both characters seem obsessed with water for reasons I haven't quite discerned.The film gets going once Hanna is put on trial for her actions as a guard in the SS during WWII.  Her young lover is forced to watch and listen as she reveals her complicity in events that left hundreds dead.  This is where Winslet gets a chance to show the complexity and emotions of a woman who has done things she can't keep hidden.Another secret, which I won't reveal, has to do with why she wants the young man to come around--and it isn't so much for sex.  It's also the reason why the older version of this fellow, played ably by Ralph Fiennes, sends her so many tapes while she's in prison.It's not clear to me why she did not take advantage of her upcoming parole (I won't spill on that point either).

The repetitive scenes of perfect gray backgrounds endless shots of pouting by all the characters with somber music to assist in the mood and the classic film filler of smoking a cigarette for dramatic effect of deep contemplation (Freud would say of guilty sexual pleasures) is too scripted for my pallet.I can understand that many people will find this film a profound revelation and/or even a classic representation of flawless acting that achieves a balance of realism seldom found in the Hollywood movie industry.For me however, it loses purpose, by not exposing the ugly side of human nature for which we are all vulnerable to regardless of nationality, faith, or moral upbringing.The film is too self absorbed into the characters of Hanna and Michael's feeling of guilt and shame which makes them come across somewhat pathetic and bland. It overindulges in trying to have us feel sympathetic to the characters plights.Like most people if you like soap operas you will probably love this movie.

1229010,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B001PPLJIQ,Westley,"[4, 5]","""The Reader,"" based on the book of the same name by German author Bernard Schlink, tells the story of an affair between a middle-aged trolley-car worker (Hanna Schmitz, played by Kate Winslet) and a teen boy (Michael Berg, played by David Kross) in 1958.  The affair is odd, with Hanna insisting that the boy read classic literature to her before they make love.  They don't even know each other's names initially.  After several months together, the boy finds Hanna's apartment empty one day, and he does not see her again for 8 years when he is in law school.  Despite the briefness of the affair, it has a profound effect on the boy.I read the book, ""The Reader,"" about 10 years ago, shortly after it was released, and the movie is more or less faithful to it.  Some audiences are going to avoid ""The Reader.""  For example, some viewers are bound to be offended by an affair between a woman in her 30s and a 15 year old boy.  Indeed, these scenes are rather graphic, including full frontal female and male nudity (director Stephen Daldry had to hold off filming these scenes until the end of filming when David Kross turned 18 years old).  Likewise, some people probably think that ""The Reader"" is just another dreary Holocaust movie.  However, they're going to miss a worthwhile movie.  First, neither the affair nor the Holocaust is the core of the movie; instead the focus is on post-WWII German guilt.  The affair basically is a plot device to illustrate the generation gap in how Germans viewed what occurred during the Holocaust.  Second, no scenes depict Holocaust events, although there is some brief emotional trial testimony.  Certainly ""The Reader"" is an emotion-laden movie, but it does not show explicit violence like ""Schindler's List.""For interested viewers, there's much to appreciate in this film.  Kate Winslet is spectacular and deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actress.  She also won a slew of Supporting Actress awards for the part, including the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild (she was marketed as supporting actress so it wouldn't compete with her leading role in ""Revolutionary Road"").  Her part perhaps is smaller than David Kross' role, but she is definitely the leading actress here.  The makeup artists (who get their own mini-documentary on the DVD extras) also merit attention, as they age Kate quite believably across 40 years.  Ralph Fiennes also does solid work as the older version of Michael Berg; he really had a great 2008, with terrific turns in ""The Duchess"" and ""In Bruges.""  He really should have gotten more love during awards season, especially for ""In Bruges.""  Finally, David Kross is perfectly cast as the teen Michael.  Kross is German and had to learn English for the role; he more than holds his own against the luminous Winslet.Another major strength is the movie's spare script, which prevents the audience from an easy resolution.  ""The Reader"" never directly tells us what we should think about Hanna - never moralizes.  As Kate Winslet explains on one of the documentaries on the DVD extras, the movie doesn't ask the audience to sympathize with Hanna.  However, the movie does not demonize her, instead maintaining enough gray areas to force the audience to think critically about their response.  I appreciated this approach even more after viewing some of the deleted scenes which tended to overexplain situations and lead the viewers in certain directions.  Despite these strengths, ""The Reader"" is flawed.  The movie unfolds a bit too leisurely.  In addition, by making Hanna an enigma, it distances the audience and prevents an emotional catharsis.

1229020,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001PPLJIQ,Z Hayes,"[10, 12]","The movie ""The Reader"" is based on Bernhard Schlink's semi-autobiographical 1995 novel of the same name. For the most part, the movie stays true to the novel and it is a movie that bears watching again and again, if only because it raises so many questions, having to do with the collective guilt of the German people due to the events of WW II, i.e. the Holocaust, the moral ambiguities and conflicts experienced by some of the characters, and the matter of redemption or absolution.The timeline of the story is in three parts, though viewers are taken back and forth between the three periods via flashbacks.In the present, Ralph Fiennes plays the mature Michael Berg who recollects the events of his youth that have left emotional scars on him. Viewers are taken via flashback to 1958, where Michael Berg [David Kross] is a 15-year-old schoolboy who first meets Hanna Schmitz [Kate Winslet] when he throws up because of scarlet fever. Hanna comes to his aid and when Michael recovers a few months later, he goes back to thank her. The young teen finds himself sexually attracted to Hanna, and very soon a torrid affair ensues between the two. The sex scenes themselves are muted and tastefully done, though there is a lot of graphic nudity, and I can understand how these scenes may put off some people, given that it is sex between a 30+ year-old woman and a 15-year-old boy [ David Kross had to wait till he turned 18 before filming the more graphic scenes]. But, given the story, the sex scenes are integral in establishing the nature of the relationship between the two and how this later affects both of them.Michael is engrossed by Hanna, and finds it hard to accept how she distances herself from him in terms of revealing more about herself [for quite some time, he doesn't even know her name]. Hanna is drawn to Michael for reasons of her own, one being that she loves listening to him read to her - works such as Lady Chatterley's Lover, a novel by Chekhov etc. The pair find happiness and lose themselves in each other, but one day Michael comes to Hanna's flat and finds her gone.Eight years later, Michael is a young law student who attends a trial of Nazi war criminals, and is stupefied to find Hanna one of the defendants. he is mortified to realize that Hanna used to be an SS guard at a concentration camp. Even more so, as the trial progresses, he makes a startling discovery, one that could help Hanna in her defense. The decision he makes is one that will haunt him for the rest of his life.""The Reader"" is an emotionally-charged movie that deal with a multitude of issues - the guilt of an individual vs the collective guilt of the German people for the Holocaust, the pangs of first love and of two souls connecting despite all the social taboos that frown upon such associations, the matter of atonement or lack of it, redemption etc. In the capable hands of the director, the viewer is able to follow the story as it presents all these issues - and I came to  understand the main characters with all their complexities and conflicts.Winslet and Kross are to be commended for their credible character portrayals. In one of her finest performances [justifiably winning the Oscar], Winslet portrays a tormented soul who harbors a secret so shameful that she will not even use it in her defense. She can be aggressive one moment, yet tender and passive the next, and the mercurial changes in her behavior are so credibly portrayed by her vivid facial expressions and manner of speech. Kross beguiles in his performance as the besotted schoolboy who loves passionately and who later feels 'betrayed' by what he discover about Hanna's past, vacillating between hurt, anger and a yearning for the one woman he truly loved. Ralph Fiennes also does a credible job as the mature Michael who has to come to terms with his past.""The Reader"" is a compelling movie indeed.",4,Winslet and Kross mesmerize in this thought-provoking movie,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,3886,"['movie', 'Reader', 'based', 'Bernhard', 'Schlink', 'semi-autobiographical', '1995', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'true', 'novel', 'movie', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'having', 'do', 'collective', 'guilt', 'German', 'people', 'due', 'events', 'WW', 'II', 'i.e', 'Holocaust', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'conflicts', 'experienced', 'characters', 'matter', 'redemption', 'absolution.The', 'timeline', 'story', 'three', 'parts', 'viewers', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'forth', 'three', 'periods', 'flashbacks.In', 'present', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'mature', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'who', 'events', 'youth', 'have', 'left', 'emotional', 'scars', 'Viewers', 'are', 'taken', 'flashback', '1958', 'where', 'Michael', 'Berg', '[', 'David', 'Kross', ']', '15-year-old', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'first', 'meets', 'Hanna', 'Schmitz', '[', 'Kate', 'Winslet', ']', 'when', 'up', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'Hanna', 'aid', 'when', 'Michael', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'back', 'thank', 'young', 'teen', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'Hanna', 'very', 'soon', 'torrid', 'affair', 'ensues', 'two', 'sex', 'are', 'muted', 'tastefully', 'done', 'lot', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'scenes', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'people', 'given', 'sex', '30+', 'year-old', 'woman', '15-year-old', 'boy', '[', 'David', 'Kross', 'had', 'wait', 'till', 'turned', '18', 'filming', 'more', 'graphic', 'scenes', ']', 'given', 'story', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'integral', 'establishing', 'nature', 'relationship', 'two', 'how', 'later', 'them.Michael', 'engrossed', 'Hanna', 'hard', 'accept', 'how', 'terms', 'revealing', 'more', '[', 'quite', 'time', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'name', ']', 'Hanna', 'drawn', 'Michael', 'reasons', 'own', 'one', 'being', 'listening', 'read', 'works', 'such', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'Lover', 'novel', 'Chekhov', 'etc', 'pair', 'find', 'happiness', 'lose', 'other', 'one', 'day', 'Michael', 'Hanna', 'flat', 'gone.Eight', 'years', 'later', 'Michael', 'young', 'law', 'student', 'who', 'trial', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminals', 'stupefied', 'find', 'Hanna', 'one', 'defendants', 'mortified', 'realize', 'Hanna', 'used', 'be', 'SS', 'guard', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'trial', 'startling', 'discovery', 'one', 'could', 'help', 'Hanna', 'defense', 'decision', 'one', 'will', 'haunt', 'rest', 'life', 'Reader', 'emotionally-charged', 'movie', 'deal', 'multitude', 'issues', 'guilt', 'individual', 'vs', 'collective', 'guilt', 'German', 'people', 'Holocaust', 'pangs', 'first', 'love', 'two', 'souls', 'connecting', 'social', 'taboos', 'frown', 'such', 'associations', 'matter', 'atonement', 'lack', 'redemption', 'etc', 'capable', 'hands', 'director', 'viewer', 'able', 'follow', 'story', 'issues', 'came', 'understand', 'main', 'characters', 'complexities', 'conflicts.Winslet', 'Kross', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'credible', 'character', 'portrayals', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', '[', 'justifiably', 'winning', 'Oscar', ']', 'Winslet', 'tormented', 'soul', 'who', 'secret', 'so', 'shameful', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'use', 'defense', 'can', 'be', 'aggressive', 'one', 'moment', 'tender', 'passive', 'next', 'mercurial', 'changes', 'behavior', 'are', 'so', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'vivid', 'facial', 'expressions', 'manner', 'speech', 'Kross', 'performance', 'besotted', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'passionately', 'who', 'later', ""'betrayed"", 'what', 'Hanna', 'past', 'vacillating', 'hurt', 'anger', 'yearning', 'one', 'woman', 'truly', 'loved', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'also', 'credible', 'job', 'mature', 'Michael', 'who', 'come', 'terms', 'past', 'Reader', 'compelling', 'movie', 'indeed']",N/A
