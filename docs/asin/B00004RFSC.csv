This video is well divided into working various parts of the body: arms, abs, hips, and so on, but the camera focuses mostly on Dolphina's face or abs. It's hard to do the steps she shows when the camera is panned on her abs. But if you already know the steps it's not too bad. The tape offers a relaxing 50 minutes, and if someone wanted a more intense workout they could just rewind each segment and do it again. The costumes and settings are great, and she is encouraging, but when the sequel comes out, I hope they do a full-body shot of her demonstrating the moves. It's not a tape for beginners, but just something to add to the collection to add variety to the workouts.",4,"Not bad, not great",1010016000,"01 3, 2002",2002,815,"['bought', 'video', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'bellytwins', 'tapes', 'while', 'helped', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'moves', 'video', 'well', 'divided', 'working', 'various', 'parts', 'body', 'arms', 'abs', 'hips', 'so', 'camera', 'mostly', 'Dolphina', 'face', 'abs', 'hard', 'do', 'steps', 'when', 'camera', 'panned', 'abs', 'already', 'know', 'steps', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'tape', 'relaxing', '50', 'minutes', 'someone', 'wanted', 'more', 'intense', 'could', 'just', 'rewind', 'segment', 'do', 'again', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'great', 'encouraging', 'when', 'sequel', 'out', 'hope', 'do', 'full-body', 'shot', 'demonstrating', 'moves', 'not', 'tape', 'beginners', 'just', 'something', 'add', 'collection', 'add', 'variety', 'workouts']",The Goddess Workout with Dolphina - Introduction to Bellydance VHS
549132,AMTV3L9A3WPSG,B00004RFSC,"E. L. White ""member of the 3AM Zill Brigade""","[6, 6]","Besides terrible camera angles, Dolphina can't really bellydance. She can't isolate her movements, which is a key part of bellydance. She tries to throw in graceful arm movements, but the overall effect is a worm on a hook. She teaches moves improperly, often to the point that the viewer must figure it out on his/her own. She doesn't teach the viewer how to stand or do moves to prevent them from doing them wrong and hurting themselves. Some moves she teaches in ways which you could injure yourself! Other moves she just plain does, teaches, and describes wrong, and in a different way for each! She demonstrates it by not isolating and sometimes even doing the wrong move, she teaches it in ways which are harder or impossible, and describes it in ways which will totally throw you off! &quot;Learn to bellydance with the ultimate goddess herself, Dolphina&quot; The ultimate goddess? Give me a break! Taking a few bellydance classes doesn't make you good enough to make a video.In conclusion this video is good for three things. One: if you just want something fun and don't care if you're dancing wrong. Two: if you already know how to do all the moves and just want someone to tell you in what order to do your practice moves. Three: You want something new to &quot;self date&quot; with.

549136,A18VVDLRLG9SVO,B00004RFSC,Kimberly Wells,"[2, 2]","I do like this video, but I agree that there are parts where the camera could have focused better of exactly what Dolphina is doing.  If you don't already know the moves, you might really find it hard to follow her.  So this is why I think perhaps this tape is not for those who haven't taken any classes at all.  But if you have, and want something that you can do at home to remind yourself of the moves you've learned already, and to keep the exercise going on non-class days, and to feel really good about yourself, then this is a great tape.The costumes are fabulous; one of the things that belly dance can do is make you obsessed with the things to wear for belly dance.  The sets are interesting; not the bare bones studio sets-- it made me wonder whether these were her home, or what?Unlike some other reviewers, I actually liked the short sessions with each costume change-- focusing in on a particular part of the body is something we do a lot in class, and it felt familiar, and I didn't have time to get bored &amp; remember that I was working out.  And if you do the whole workout without stopping, then you do get quite sweaty &amp; worked out-- especially the &quot;shimmy&quot; section.The caveat I must add, and a reason my review is just four stars-- Dolphina is into the kind of &quot;new age&quot; elements of belly dance. (Although why this is a surprise about a video named after the goddess I'd have to say).  If that kind of culture  bugs you, go after a different video cause she's probably going to get on your nerves talking about chakras and the like.  But I still really liked it, and will continue to work out with it.But finally, if you want to learn to belly dance, TAKE A CLASS.  Probably there are some in or near your home town-- you'd be surprised-- look for a Greek or Indian or Turkish restaurant and ask them there.  There really is NO substitute for being in a classroom with a real, live teacher.  And you'll get some great opportunities to go out and practice this stuff, live, and become a real belly dancer yourself.",4,a good tape if you already know the basics of belly dance,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2060,"['do', 'video', 'agree', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'camera', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'better', 'exactly', 'what', 'Dolphina', 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'moves', 'might', 'really', 'find', 'hard', 'follow', 'why', 'think', 'perhaps', 'tape', 'not', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'taken', 'classes', 'have', 'want', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'home', 'remind', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'already', 'keep', 'exercise', 'going', 'non-class', 'days', 'feel', 'really', 'good', 'then', 'great', 'tape.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'fabulous', 'one', 'things', 'belly', 'dance', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'obsessed', 'things', 'wear', 'belly', 'dance', 'sets', 'are', 'interesting', 'not', 'bare', 'studio', 'sets', 'made', 'wonder', 'were', 'home', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'actually', 'liked', 'short', 'sessions', 'costume', 'change', 'focusing', 'particular', 'part', 'body', 'something', 'do', 'lot', 'class', 'felt', 'familiar', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'get', 'bored', 'amp', 'remember', 'was', 'working', 'out', 'do', 'whole', 'workout', 'stopping', 'then', 'do', 'get', 'quite', 'sweaty', 'amp', 'worked', 'out', 'especially', 'quot', 'quot', 'caveat', 'must', 'add', 'reason', 'review', 'just', 'four', 'stars', 'Dolphina', 'kind', 'quot', 'new', 'age', 'quot', 'elements', 'belly', 'dance', 'why', 'surprise', 'video', 'named', 'goddess', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'kind', 'culture', 'bugs', 'go', 'different', 'video', 'cause', 'probably', 'going', 'get', 'nerves', 'talking', 'chakras', 'like', 'still', 'really', 'liked', 'will', 'continue', 'work', 'out', 'it.But', 'finally', 'want', 'learn', 'belly', 'dance', 'TAKE', 'CLASS', 'Probably', 'are', 'home', 'town', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'look', 'Greek', 'Indian', 'Turkish', 'restaurant', 'ask', 'there', 'really', 'NO', 'substitute', 'being', 'classroom', 'real', 'live', 'teacher', ""'ll"", 'get', 'great', 'opportunities', 'go', 'out', 'practice', 'stuff', 'live', 'become', 'real', 'belly', 'dancer']",The Goddess Workout with Dolphina - Introduction to Bellydance VHS

549138,A1AVSEZREQI89I,B00004RFSC,Robyn Russell,"[70, 74]","Sadly, anyone who looks reasonably good in a two piece outfit, has had a few Middle Eastern dance lessons, and has a good publicist can not only produce their own bellydance video these days, but can flog it to an unsuspecting public and no one will be the wiser. That's my review of The Goddess Workout in a nutshell. As a Middle Eastern dancer/instructor with 20 years experience, I am always on the lookout for good videos, especially beginner's videos, to recommend to my students.  The Goddess Workout will not be getting a recommendation from me for several reasons. The movements are not well broken down or not broken down at all. ""Be open"" is not helpful advice for mastering undulations--just take it from me. The importance of basic posture--pelvis tucked, back long, shoulders down and relaxed, knees bent--which is very critical for doing Mid-Eastern dance movements safely and well is not emphasized or even mentioned. The neckrolls are not done properly--you should not allow the head to drop all the way back. The rhythm she identifies as ""zar"" is actually ""beladi"". And on and on. I don't know how long Dolphina has been dancing (and I even went to her website to look it up), but I suspect that she has either not been dancing very long or that she didn't manage to learn very much while she was taking lessons because she seems to be having trouble with her isolations and her movements in general seem awkward. The mark of an experienced dancer is that she is able to isolate her muscle movements and that her transitions are smooth.In my opinion, the beginning dancer will be lost, the intermediate dancer will either pick up bad habits or will be frustrated since Dolphina tosses in (without breaking them down) some layered moves (shimmies with Figure 8s, for example) that can take a while to master, and the advanced dancer will be bored, amused, or nauseated (or possibly a combination of all three).If you are looking for a New Age belly dance instructional video, I highly recommend Delilah's Bellydance Workshop Vols. 1-3 by Delilah Flynn...  New Age philosophy makes me throw up, but Delilah is an excellent dancer and teacher. If you are looking for a dance teacher in your area, check out Shira's teacher's directory...

That said, it is particularly difficult to learn from this video.  This so-called Introduction to Belly Dance is more of a whirlwind tour.  I have taken a ten-week beginner class and we did not cover half of this material.In some ways it is a good video because the frequent changes and the advanced moves made it interesting for me.  The costum changes and scenery is beautiful, and you are sure to get some amusement from Dolphina's SoCal commentary.  &quot;Sufism, which is a religion&quot; particularly made me chuckle.  This video is chock full of references to open chakras, energy, and the goddess within.One failure in the instruction is that the video goes far too quickly.  Another failure is that she does not explain how to execute the move.  In belly dance, much is an illusion.  Unless you talk about and show what parts are actually moving, the video-watcher will be as mystified as anyone else.  The only time I can remember her properly explaining a move was when she explained hip shimmies, showing that the bending knees create the movement of hips from side to side.Dolphina also does not go over good form, and a novice dancer could hurt her knees or back by not being in the proper dancing position.",2,not a good introduction,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,1316,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'possible', 'learn', 'belly', 'dancing', 'video', 'said', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'learn', 'video', 'so-called', 'Introduction', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'more', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'have', 'taken', 'ten-week', 'beginner', 'class', 'did', 'not', 'cover', 'half', 'material.In', 'ways', 'good', 'video', 'frequent', 'changes', 'advanced', 'moves', 'made', 'interesting', 'costum', 'changes', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'are', 'sure', 'get', 'amusement', 'Dolphina', 'SoCal', 'commentary', 'quot', 'Sufism', 'religion', 'quot', 'particularly', 'made', 'chuckle', 'video', 'chock', 'full', 'references', 'open', 'chakras', 'energy', 'goddess', 'within.One', 'failure', 'instruction', 'video', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'failure', 'not', 'explain', 'how', 'execute', 'move', 'belly', 'dance', 'much', 'illusion', 'talk', 'show', 'what', 'parts', 'are', 'actually', 'moving', 'video-watcher', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'mystified', 'anyone', 'else', 'only', 'time', 'can', 'remember', 'properly', 'explaining', 'move', 'was', 'when', 'explained', 'hip', 'shimmies', 'showing', 'bending', 'knees', 'create', 'movement', 'hips', 'side', 'side.Dolphina', 'also', 'not', 'go', 'over', 'good', 'form', 'novice', 'dancer', 'could', 'hurt', 'knees', 'back', 'not', 'being', 'proper', 'dancing', 'position']",The Goddess Workout with Dolphina - Introduction to Bellydance VHS
549140,A3QFE1H3RUP6Z7,B00004RFSC,"Shantell Powell ""The ShanMonster""","[14, 17]","Yesterday, I finally got to watch The Goddess Workout with Dolphina.  It was scarier than I'd imagined.  No, not Jeanine Rabbitt scary.  It was bad in entirely different ways.First off, a cursory history of the dance is given.  This would normally be a nice touch, but the degree of misinformation was downright comical.  This is wishtory at its most luvvy-duvvy, new age best.  A hodgepodge of references are made throughout the video to chakras, kundalini, goddesses, sufis and dervishes.  The would-be dancer is even warned at one point that shimmying has the power to cause earthquakes, so you should really check out your intentions before beginning to dance.  My goodness!  I had no idea!  I'm glad she warned me....From a learner's perspective, the video is extremely frustrating.  I suspect the videographer was enamoured with Dolphina's pretty face, because that's where the camera was focused for much of the tape.  While Dolphina soulfully and breathily explains how her kundalini is being awaken by a particular hip move, instead of focusing on her hips, the camera is aimed at her sincere face and pouting lips.  Also, the camera tends to linger on Dolphina's bust for overlong periods of time, even when the movement being demonstrated is using some other part of the body.I'm guessing you can only see enough of the movements less than a quarter of the time.  This, in itself, makes The Goddess Workout a terrible instruction video.When you do see the correct areas of the body, there are still other problems.  Dolphina presents every movement from only one angle:  she directly faces the camera.  There are no side shots, three-quarter views, let alone rear views.  The lack of side shots is especially problematic for such movements as the shimmies.  You cannot see her leg placement at all, here, and a beginner could easily hurt her or himself by hyperextending the knees.  To top it off, in the shimmy section, the section where seeing the legs is the most crucial of all, the legs are completely obscured by a beautiful, flowing pink skirt.The travelling movements are also especially frustrating, because again, the focal areas are not being shown.  When Dolphina does a travelling hip twist shimmy, her feet are not shown.  It's almost impossible for a would-be dancer to know what to do, here.  Seeing body weight placement and dynamics are vital to comprehension, yet are not provided.The explanations for movements are also bad.  For instance, while doing hip raises, Dolphina explains that the movement is generated by pushing up with the ball of the foot, up through the calf.  This is wrong, wrong, wrong.  Indeed, she doesn't even follow her own advice.  She does it properly, by using her obliques and hips to lift and drop, but by following her instructions, students, although getting a nice calf workout, will end up dancing in a very clunky, incorrect manner.I also have issues with one of her warm-up and cool-down exercises.  She encourages dancers to roll their heads all the way around, crunching down through the neck in the back.  This is a dangerous movement, and can easily result in a badly-pinched nerve.All this being said, there are some good points to this video.  The video quality if superb, the settings are gorgeous, and Dolphina's costumes are elegant and lovely.  However, looking well does not equate to teaching well.Avoid this video tape, if you're looking for dance instruction.  There are many safer, more informative videos on the market.",2,Ouch.,1056585600,"06 26, 2003",2003,3499,"['Yesterday', 'finally', 'got', 'watch', 'Goddess', 'Workout', 'Dolphina', 'was', 'scarier', ""'d"", 'imagined', 'No', 'not', 'Jeanine', 'Rabbitt', 'scary', 'was', 'bad', 'entirely', 'different', 'ways.First', 'cursory', 'history', 'dance', 'given', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'nice', 'touch', 'degree', 'misinformation', 'was', 'downright', 'comical', 'wishtory', 'most', 'luvvy-duvvy', 'new', 'age', 'best', 'hodgepodge', 'references', 'are', 'made', 'video', 'chakras', 'kundalini', 'goddesses', 'sufis', 'dervishes', 'would-be', 'dancer', 'even', 'warned', 'one', 'point', 'shimmying', 'power', 'cause', 'earthquakes', 'should', 'really', 'check', 'out', 'intentions', 'beginning', 'dance', 'goodness', 'had', 'idea', ""'m"", 'glad', 'warned', 'learner', 'perspective', 'video', 'extremely', 'frustrating', 'suspect', 'videographer', 'was', 'enamoured', 'Dolphina', 'pretty', 'face', 'where', 'camera', 'was', 'focused', 'much', 'tape', 'Dolphina', 'soulfully', 'breathily', 'how', 'kundalini', 'being', 'awaken', 'particular', 'hip', 'move', 'instead', 'focusing', 'hips', 'camera', 'aimed', 'sincere', 'face', 'pouting', 'lips', 'Also', 'camera', 'linger', 'Dolphina', 'bust', 'overlong', 'periods', 'time', 'even', 'when', 'movement', 'being', 'demonstrated', 'using', 'other', 'part', 'body.I', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'enough', 'movements', 'less', 'quarter', 'time', 'Goddess', 'terrible', 'instruction', 'video.When', 'do', 'see', 'correct', 'areas', 'body', 'are', 'still', 'other', 'problems', 'Dolphina', 'movement', 'only', 'one', 'angle', 'directly', 'camera', 'are', 'side', 'shots', 'three-quarter', 'views', 'let', 'alone', 'rear', 'views', 'lack', 'side', 'shots', 'especially', 'problematic', 'such', 'movements', 'shimmies', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'leg', 'placement', 'here', 'beginner', 'could', 'easily', 'hurt', 'hyperextending', 'knees', 'top', 'off', 'shimmy', 'section', 'section', 'where', 'seeing', 'legs', 'most', 'crucial', 'legs', 'are', 'completely', 'obscured', 'beautiful', 'flowing', 'pink', 'skirt.The', 'travelling', 'movements', 'are', 'also', 'especially', 'frustrating', 'because', 'again', 'focal', 'areas', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'shown', 'When', 'Dolphina', 'travelling', 'hip', 'twist', 'shimmy', 'feet', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'almost', 'impossible', 'would-be', 'dancer', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'here', 'Seeing', 'body', 'weight', 'placement', 'dynamics', 'are', 'vital', 'comprehension', 'are', 'not', 'provided.The', 'explanations', 'movements', 'are', 'also', 'bad', 'instance', 'doing', 'hip', 'raises', 'Dolphina', 'movement', 'generated', 'pushing', 'up', 'ball', 'foot', 'up', 'calf', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'Indeed', ""n't"", 'even', 'follow', 'own', 'advice', 'properly', 'using', 'obliques', 'hips', 'lift', 'drop', 'following', 'instructions', 'students', 'getting', 'nice', 'calf', 'workout', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'dancing', 'very', 'clunky', 'incorrect', 'manner.I', 'also', 'have', 'issues', 'one', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'exercises', 'dancers', 'roll', 'heads', 'way', 'crunching', 'down', 'neck', 'back', 'dangerous', 'movement', 'can', 'easily', 'result', 'badly-pinched', 'nerve.All', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'good', 'points', 'video', 'video', 'quality', 'superb', 'settings', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Dolphina', 'costumes', 'are', 'elegant', 'lovely', 'However', 'looking', 'well', 'not', 'equate', 'teaching', 'well.Avoid', 'video', 'tape', ""'re"", 'looking', 'dance', 'instruction', 'are', 'many', 'safer', 'more', 'informative', 'videos', 'market']",The Goddess Workout with Dolphina - Introduction to Bellydance VHS
549141,A2JMK7VH2CQQU2,B00004RFSC,"TJ ""=&#60;^..^&#62;=""","[5, 5]","I have mastered most of the moves in the Bidasha twins' Sensual Art of Bellydance series and was looking for something more advanced. This definitely isn't any more advanced and teaches many of the same moves but I still liked it. I wish that at the end where she teaches you a routine stringing all the learned moves together that it didn't end right after but that she danced it without talking at least one time so that it would have included a little bit of cardio movement. It did not make me work up a sweat, though, so I am going to be using this tape as well as the Sensual series tapes as a sort of warm up and then will just dance away to several Arabic songs for a cardio effect. For a person who is a very beginner, though, this tape may be a little difficult because there are many scenes where the camera focuses on Dolphina's face instead of the body area being worked. You can't see what she is doing and luckily I know the moves already so it wasn't difficult at all.  But after watching and trying several times, you should be able to get it down. I would say maybe even get the Sensual Art series and combine this along with the other tapes for maximum practice!! Once your muscles tone up to the moves, believe me, if you hear any arabic song or any tune that has like sound, you will just shimmy away to it!!...",5,good beginner/intermediate workout for tightening,1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,1332,"['have', 'mastered', 'most', 'moves', 'Bidasha', 'twins', 'Sensual', 'Art', 'Bellydance', 'series', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'advanced', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'more', 'advanced', 'many', 'same', 'moves', 'still', 'liked', 'wish', 'end', 'where', 'routine', 'stringing', 'learned', 'moves', 'together', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'right', 'danced', 'talking', 'least', 'one', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'little', 'bit', 'cardio', 'movement', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'though', 'am', 'going', 'be', 'using', 'tape', 'as', 'well', 'Sensual', 'series', 'tapes', 'sort', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'will', 'just', 'dance', 'away', 'several', 'Arabic', 'songs', 'cardio', 'effect', 'person', 'who', 'very', 'beginner', 'though', 'tape', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'difficult', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'camera', 'Dolphina', 'face', 'instead', 'body', 'area', 'being', 'worked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'luckily', 'know', 'moves', 'already', 'was', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'watching', 'trying', 'several', 'times', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'down', 'would', 'say', 'maybe', 'even', 'get', 'Sensual', 'Art', 'series', 'combine', 'other', 'tapes', 'maximum', 'practice', 'Once', 'muscles', 'tone', 'up', 'moves', 'believe', 'hear', 'arabic', 'song', 'tune', 'sound', 'will', 'just', 'shimmy', 'away']",The Goddess Workout with Dolphina - Introduction to Bellydance VHS
