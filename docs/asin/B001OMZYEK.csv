1222908,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B001OMZYEK,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[1, 1]","I've seen a little over 100 anime titles since my (nearly) eight years of watching anime, and Shigurui is one of the most violent and psychotic I've seen that doesn't spiral into cartoony schlock such as &lt;cough>Elfen Lied&lt;cough> and &lt;cough>Gantz&lt;cough>.  As you can see by the score, I was really glad to see Shiguri as well.The plot is that in Japan circa 1629, during the rule of Tokugawa Tadanaga, a tournament is held where two scarred warriors fight to the death.  The two warriors are Gennosuke Fujiki and Seigen Irako.  Their pasts are unraveled as so you can see why things happened that led them into this fight.CHARACTERSOne of the things that makes Shigurui stand out is how interesting they are.  Since this is set in the years when the samurai populated the Japanese landscape, it shows the really unpleasant yet often overlooked realism in their lives.  What I mean is that unlike most anime focusing on the lives of samurai, there's no tale about becoming a hero and triumphing over their inner demons.  Shigurui instead focuses on how a rivalry was forged between the two main characters and how it spiraled into a visceral bloodbath.  There's also no clear-cut good or bad guy in this anime, practically everyone (save most of the female characters) has shades of evil in them.  Fujiki may seem the most sympathetic main character because he has an unbending loyalty to his master, the ultra-demented Kogan Iwamato, who'se in charge of the Kogan-Ryuu school.  I personally like Irako more simply because he was simply a man who wanted to raise his status and thought he could do so by becoming a pupil at Kogan-Ryuu, but ended up having a falling out with Kogan and became blind.  Kogan is easily the most detestable character because of his ultra-violent and maniacal behavior to everyone.  Two of the most notable acts that shows how sick Kogan is are a scene where he goes up to Lady Iku, his concubine, and cuts off her nipple.  The other is when he sticks his sword in Gonzaemon Ushimata's mouth, which cuts the edges of his lips and makes his oral cavity look much larger.PLOT STRUCTURE AND PACINGMy only gripes with this anime is that the plot can be a little slow at times, and that the ending seems a little unfinished (though not quite like the detestable ""completely sudden cliffhanger"" featured in horrid anime like Elfen Lied), though the final battle towards the end is one of the best I've seen in a martial arts anime.  On the upside, though, it seems like everything that happens in Shigurui actually adds to the story and thus, not really much pointless filler to detract from the viewing experience.  I felt that the events were well structured in a way that wouldn't make you bored since I was on the edge of my seat nearly the whole time watching this, anxiously anticipating what would happen as each event occurred.  What I also find really refreshing is that Shigurui has next to zero comedy in it.  The only part I could say that even comes close to being ""funny"" is when there's an arranged marriage between Seigen and Mei and Kogan keeps saying ""Conceive!"", which I think was put in only to show his demented behavior and not for any intentional comic relief.  Comedy for an anime like this would only hurt this anime drastically, and I'd be the first to throw giant rocks at it because I have ZERO tolerance for that.MATURE CONTENTAs stated before, Shigurui is one of the most gruesome anime titles out there.  I'd even say that if compared to an anime of similar ilk, such as Ninja Scroll, it would make the former title look like an episode of Sesame Street in comparison.  Heck, in the opening scene, you see a fellow whose cut himself to demonstrate the consequences of using swords in duals by yanking out his entrails, and the gore in said scene looks quite real for an animated series.  The violence even had me, a pretty seasoned gore hound, wincing at some scenes.  There's also a good helping of nudity.  I felt that the nudity was pretty well used in Shigurui because despite its pretty abundant quantity, they felt like they belonged in nearly all of the scenes they were used in.  The nudity isn't all pretty, either, there's a pretty weird scene where Lady Iku sees herself nude, with large bugs crawling on her.  Another scene towards the end of the series shows how the many acts of cruelty inflicted upon Mie Iwamoto literally eats away at her body and is starved, and she doesn't look pretty in this stage.  There's also male nudity in Shigurui as well, since it lightly shows the encouraged homosexual relationships shared between samurai in that period, which was also further explained in the booklet that came with the series.SOUNDTRACKShigurui's soundtrack is really superb.  It consists entirely of ethnic Japanese music that fits perfectly with its setting and thankfully, is also used in the opening and closing scenes.  The music itself is also well incorporated by not overpowering the scenes they're played in and distracting the audience from the action.  This is a really warm welcome for those who are sick of J-pop and J-rock constantly being regurgitated in anime.  The cherry on the sundae is that it's consistent, a quality that's missing as well since the ""in thing"" in most anime is to mash different and unfitting styles of music in its soundtrack.ANIMATION AND ARTWORKOnce again, Madhouse Studio has made another great anime, and it shows in the production values.  This is some of the most beautiful (albeit disgusting) imagery I've scene in anime.  The animation itself is also really well done since everything seems to move rather smoothly and the incorporation of CGI into this 2D anime is tastefully done by only complementing it rather than overtaking it.FINAL WORDIf you're looking for an ultra-nihilistic, martial arts-themed anime with one of the most realistic atmospheres to it, then Shigurui will reward you pretty handsomely.",4,It's

I ""research"" my purchases by reading reviews, product descriptions, checking out wikipedia, etc.  Very rarely do I make a blind purchase & just buy something without checking it out first.Shigurui Death Frenzy was one of those purchases that, while I did check out reviews & product descripitons, I found the information about it to be somewhat misleading.  What I expected from what I had read & what it actually turned out to be was different than described.  I agree with many of the other (non five star) reviewers comments, mostly about it being slow.  It was extremely slow paced.  Because of that it really didn't hold my interest, thus making the storyline somewhat hard to follow.  The storyline was good, but I expected more action than there was.  I thought the animation was beautifully done & the music complimented the series well.  Very artistic.  I give the series a 3 out of  5 stars.  I CAN see why some people would enjoy this series.  I, for the most part, did not.

Darker stories are difficult to come by as it is.The artwork is not anything that will detract from the show. The audio is not amazing. No part was particularly lacking. The conclusion was not all I hoped for, but that helps the series perhaps.A number of people have said that they couldn't like either main character. All of the characters were so depraved and they had no investment in any of them. The characters' have their moments of admirable actions (save a few characters). Seeing their humanity and how they handled similar situations differently is what made this worth watching.I don't love gore, but I appreciate directors not holding back (so long as it doesn't become an exposition). Unfortunately, there are some scenes where it really is just exposition. The most valuable part of the series is the moral (or ethical) problem of what should/could have been done. No, this is not as good as Berzerk. No, it is not a great directing masterpiece like from Kurosawa. It is Shigurui, a bloody, dark, tale you can enjoy if you managed to watch Berzerk through to the end.",4,Bloody and watchable,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,1405,"['worth', 'watching', 'are', 'looking', 'darker', 'series', 'looking', 'cover', 'away', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'story', 'bloody', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'also', 'fairly', 'complicated', 'politics', 'dojo', 'small', 'sampling', 'Japan', 'era', 'historically', 'accurate', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Darker', 'stories', 'are', 'difficult', 'come', 'artwork', 'not', 'anything', 'will', 'detract', 'show', 'audio', 'not', 'amazing', 'part', 'was', 'particularly', 'lacking', 'conclusion', 'was', 'not', 'hoped', 'series', 'number', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'like', 'either', 'main', 'character', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'depraved', 'had', 'investment', 'characters', 'have', 'moments', 'admirable', 'actions', 'save', 'few', 'characters', 'Seeing', 'humanity', 'how', 'handled', 'similar', 'situations', 'differently', 'what', 'made', 'worth', 'watching.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'gore', 'appreciate', 'directors', 'not', 'holding', 'back', 'so', 'long', ""n't"", 'become', 'exposition', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'really', 'just', 'exposition', 'most', 'valuable', 'part', 'series', 'moral', 'ethical', 'problem', 'what', 'should/could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'No', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Berzerk', 'No', 'not', 'great', 'directing', 'masterpiece', 'Kurosawa', 'Shigurui', 'bloody', 'dark', 'can', 'enjoy', 'managed', 'watch', 'Berzerk', 'end']",Shigurui: Death Frenzy Complete
1222915,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B001OMZYEK,maskedgamer,"[2, 5]","This anime is a perfect example of great art with poor story. I checked this anime out not expecting much from it i'll be honest. I now know why this anime was such a disappointment. You try to enjoy it but it's very hard to. Shigurui is an extremely abstract anime that feels like one freaky mind trip when you watch it.The pacing of shigurui is extremely slow. Which doesn't at all help with the confusing and poorly developed plot. The episode are out of sequence and don't explain anything that is happening or has happened. Your left to decipher that for yourself while also having to deal with figuring out what the real story is with all the imagery they used.I didn't expect much out the anime from the get go but as I watched it I tried so hard to like it. But, how can you when the first episode of the series has NOTHING! and I mean NOTHING! to do with anything else that happens in the 11 episodes after it. Matter of fact after I watch all 12 episodes and went back to the first trying to figure out where it fit in. The only thing I could think about that maybe 11 more episodes were missing to explain what happened to the 2 main characters at the beginning.One guy loses an arm and the other one can barley walk and there's a sword wound on his foot. I mean what happened? Who did those things? These guys are the 2 greatest swordsmen in the land that's what the 11 episodes basically tell you then all of a sudden your thrown a wild card? That's just how screwed up this anime is not even the 1st episode is right.There's plenty of good animation. Probably what kept me from putting this thing back in the case. The story again is so slow you lose interest in it after a while. There were actually points in the series where I thought that my DVD player was stuck but it was just another still screen. There's lots of action in the film but mostly it's just a still screen of them holding or locking swords and then the move after its been executed. I mean this is the laziest anime I have ever seen. They don't even try to show you a good battle it's all just left to imagery.When you watch this anime I'll tell you one thing. The character they present to you as the hero type actually isn't. Matter of fact he doesn't do a noble thing in the anime. He doesn't care who he hurts just as long as he can please his master. The one guy they try to make out to be the villain is actually a good guy...I think. I mean he calls the one guy scum for torturing a woman but then there's a completely random scene where he kills a random female character. Which isn't explained at all. This guy by default becomes the hero because he's the only one willing to save the girl and defeat the real villain...but this anime does not make any sense! **possible spoiler** there's this theme throughout the entire anime that the daughter of the dojo's Sensei hates her father and overall want's the other villain guy to save her. Then when he comes and slays her father she resents him and somewhere along the line she has fallen in love with the guy whom she hated so much she went into a 3 year depression.**spoiler end** So just what in the heck was her character even about? I mean this anime doesn't tell you anything. It's just well drawn art some dialog,a lazy still shot battle scene, more dialog and then episode end. If your watching this your definitely doing it for the artwork. I can tell right now I'm going to be forgetting this anime and it's sad. This could have been great if they threw some effort into the dialog and plot.Overall all this is just a smoke and mirrors cover up to conceal an anime with a lazy story.3 stars. 1 for the artwork and 2 because I actually like the character that was forced to be the mistress. They actually managed to make me care about her character and what happened to her because of all the abuse she went though.ooohhhh btw did I forget to mention that scene where the random guy with big eyes is fantasizing about a young boy who recently died and is performing fellatio on himself? How could I forget such a wonderful scene I mean wonderful at least 5 good minutes of seeing the boy in his underwear doing random poses. Ah yes.....this was such a great scene I needed so much to see all of that... oops im sorry did I accidentally take another star off the rating?",2,Plays like a youtube slide show...,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,4320,"['anime', 'perfect', 'example', 'great', 'art', 'poor', 'story', 'checked', 'anime', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'anime', 'was', 'such', 'disappointment', 'try', 'enjoy', 'very', 'hard', 'Shigurui', 'extremely', 'abstract', 'anime', 'one', 'freaky', 'mind', 'trip', 'when', 'watch', 'it.The', 'pacing', 'shigurui', 'extremely', 'slow', 'Which', ""n't"", 'help', 'confusing', 'poorly', 'developed', 'plot', 'episode', 'are', 'sequence', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'anything', 'happening', 'happened', 'left', 'decipher', 'also', 'having', 'deal', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'real', 'story', 'imagery', 'used.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'anime', 'get', 'go', 'watched', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'like', 'how', 'can', 'when', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'NOTHING', 'mean', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'anything', 'else', '11', 'episodes', 'Matter', 'fact', 'watch', '12', 'episodes', 'went', 'back', 'first', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'think', 'maybe', '11', 'more', 'episodes', 'were', 'missing', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'beginning.One', 'guy', 'arm', 'other', 'one', 'can', 'barley', 'walk', 'sword', 'wound', 'foot', 'mean', 'what', 'happened', 'Who', 'did', 'things', 'guys', 'are', '2', 'greatest', 'swordsmen', 'land', 'what', '11', 'episodes', 'basically', 'tell', 'then', 'sudden', 'wild', 'card', 'just', 'how', 'screwed', 'up', 'anime', 'not', 'even', '1st', 'episode', 'plenty', 'good', 'animation', 'Probably', 'what', 'kept', 'putting', 'thing', 'back', 'case', 'story', 'again', 'so', 'slow', 'lose', 'interest', 'while', 'were', 'actually', 'points', 'series', 'where', 'thought', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'stuck', 'was', 'just', 'still', 'screen', 'lots', 'action', 'film', 'mostly', 'just', 'still', 'screen', 'holding', 'locking', 'swords', 'then', 'move', 'been', 'executed', 'mean', 'laziest', 'anime', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'show', 'good', 'battle', 'just', 'left', 'imagery.When', 'watch', 'anime', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'one', 'thing', 'character', 'present', 'hero', 'type', 'actually', ""n't"", 'Matter', 'fact', ""n't"", 'do', 'noble', 'thing', 'anime', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'please', 'master', 'one', 'guy', 'try', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'villain', 'actually', 'good', 'guy', 'think', 'mean', 'one', 'guy', 'scum', 'torturing', 'woman', 'then', 'completely', 'random', 'scene', 'where', 'random', 'female', 'character', 'Which', ""n't"", 'explained', 'guy', 'default', 'hero', 'only', 'one', 'willing', 'save', 'girl', 'defeat', 'real', 'villain', 'anime', 'not', 'make', 'sense', '**possible', 'spoiler**', 'theme', 'entire', 'anime', 'daughter', 'dojo', 'Sensei', 'father', 'overall', 'want', 'other', 'villain', 'guy', 'save', 'Then', 'when', 'father', 'somewhere', 'line', 'fallen', 'love', 'guy', 'whom', 'hated', 'so', 'much', 'went', '3', 'year', 'depression', '**spoiler', 'end**', 'So', 'just', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'character', 'even', 'mean', 'anime', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'just', 'well', 'drawn', 'art', 'dialog', 'lazy', 'still', 'shot', 'battle', 'scene', 'more', 'dialog', 'then', 'episode', 'end', 'watching', 'definitely', 'doing', 'artwork', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'forgetting', 'anime', 'sad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'threw', 'effort', 'dialog', 'plot.Overall', 'just', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'cover', 'up', 'conceal', 'anime', 'lazy', 'story.3', 'stars', '1', 'artwork', '2', 'actually', 'character', 'was', 'forced', 'be', 'mistress', 'actually', 'managed', 'make', 'care', 'character', 'what', 'happened', 'abuse', 'went', 'though.ooohhhh', 'btw', 'did', 'forget', 'mention', 'scene', 'where', 'random', 'guy', 'big', 'eyes', 'fantasizing', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'performing', 'fellatio', 'How', 'could', 'forget', 'such', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'mean', 'wonderful', 'least', '5', 'good', 'minutes', 'seeing', 'boy', 'underwear', 'doing', 'random', 'poses', 'Ah', 'yes', '..this', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'scene', 'needed', 'so', 'much', 'see', 'im', 'sorry', 'did', 'accidentally', 'take', 'star', 'rating']",Shigurui: Death Frenzy Complete

The virtues of this series are at first masked behind opaque layers of extremely graphic violence, sex and nudity. Not that I have a problem watching violence, sex and nudity. But too often are the three used as stand-ins for a missing story. But that is not the case for Shigurui. Our story here begins with a tournament between two samurai with severe disabilities that they were clearly not born with. Instead, these handicaps were brought upon them by an event (or events) in their lives prior to their stand off. From here, the story circles back to the beginning, following the breadcrumbs that lead to said tournament. It is here that we learn that these two men, Fujiki Gennosuke and Irako Seigen were competing successors to their master's dojo. Fujiki, who was initially the obvious choice to follow in his master's footsteps, is suddenly eclipsed by Seigen. However, sex, betrayal and Fujiki's need for redemption and revenge re-tips the scales of the story. That is when things turn really nasty.Just how nasty they get, will be for you to discover.Seeing the hideous deformities of the two men at the beginning foreshadows the volume of carnage that you can expect to witness in Shigurui. Do not underestimate the visceral impact of this violence because the series is animated. The explicit detail of a man's entrails rivals what you'd see in a live action version. The good news for those with a weak stomach is that, thanks to minimal animation, you typically will only see the before and after of some disturbing slicing and dicing. The bad news is that the fast cuts between a raised sword and a hashed body amplifies the tension, and the long takes of a sliced off limb gives the imagination plenty of time to either recoil or recover from the aftermath. You'll be given generous time to meditate on the upper portion of a person's face. To aid in your meditation is an atmospheric soundtrack that makes the image either terribly putrescent or strangely poetic. Or both.This dichotomy alone might be the brilliance of Shigurui. By walking the line of gratuity and minimalism you certainly get a feeling of art and not pornography. Even the explicit nudity and sex is so disturbing that it neutralizes any inherent erotica. You also get a clean break (or slice) from the usual good versus evil thing. Shigurui offers us no protagonists or antagonists. There's only an ensemble of characters who stand on the same nihilistic stage and under a morally ambivalent spotlight that casts no judgment on any action or ambition - no matter how foul.  All men are truly created equal in this series: equally troubled. Equally troubling. And equally twisted.",4,Poetic Nihilism.,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2752,"['be', 'honest', 'almost', 'abandoned', 'Shigurui', 'somewhere', 'first', '2', '3', 'episodes', 'virtues', 'series', 'are', 'first', 'masked', 'opaque', 'layers', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Not', 'have', 'problem', 'watching', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'three', 'used', 'stand-ins', 'missing', 'story', 'not', 'case', 'Shigurui', 'story', 'here', 'tournament', 'two', 'samurai', 'severe', 'disabilities', 'were', 'clearly', 'not', 'born', 'Instead', 'handicaps', 'were', 'brought', 'event', 'events', 'lives', 'prior', 'stand', 'here', 'story', 'back', 'beginning', 'following', 'breadcrumbs', 'lead', 'said', 'tournament', 'here', 'learn', 'two', 'men', 'Fujiki', 'Gennosuke', 'Irako', 'Seigen', 'were', 'competing', 'successors', 'master', 'dojo', 'Fujiki', 'who', 'was', 'initially', 'obvious', 'choice', 'follow', 'master', 'footsteps', 'suddenly', 'eclipsed', 'Seigen', 'However', 'sex', 'betrayal', 'Fujiki', 'need', 'redemption', 'revenge', 're-tips', 'scales', 'story', 'when', 'things', 'turn', 'really', 'nasty.Just', 'how', 'nasty', 'get', 'will', 'be', 'discover.Seeing', 'hideous', 'deformities', 'two', 'men', 'beginning', 'volume', 'carnage', 'can', 'expect', 'witness', 'Shigurui', 'Do', 'not', 'underestimate', 'visceral', 'impact', 'violence', 'series', 'animated', 'explicit', 'detail', 'man', 'entrails', 'rivals', 'what', ""'d"", 'see', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'good', 'news', 'weak', 'stomach', 'thanks', 'minimal', 'animation', 'typically', 'will', 'only', 'see', 'before', 'disturbing', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'bad', 'news', 'fast', 'cuts', 'raised', 'sword', 'hashed', 'body', 'tension', 'long', 'sliced', 'off', 'limb', 'imagination', 'plenty', 'time', 'recoil', 'recover', 'aftermath', ""'ll"", 'be', 'given', 'generous', 'time', 'meditate', 'upper', 'portion', 'person', 'face', 'aid', 'meditation', 'atmospheric', 'soundtrack', 'image', 'terribly', 'putrescent', 'strangely', 'poetic', 'both.This', 'dichotomy', 'alone', 'might', 'be', 'brilliance', 'Shigurui', 'walking', 'line', 'gratuity', 'minimalism', 'certainly', 'get', 'feeling', 'art', 'not', 'pornography', 'Even', 'explicit', 'nudity', 'sex', 'so', 'disturbing', 'inherent', 'erotica', 'also', 'get', 'clean', 'break', 'slice', 'usual', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'thing', 'Shigurui', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'only', 'ensemble', 'characters', 'who', 'stand', 'same', 'nihilistic', 'stage', 'morally', 'ambivalent', 'spotlight', 'judgment', 'action', 'ambition', 'matter', 'how', 'foul', 'men', 'are', 'truly', 'created', 'equal', 'series', 'equally', 'troubled', 'Equally', 'troubling', 'equally', 'twisted']",Shigurui: Death Frenzy Complete

1222924,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001OMZYEK,trashcanman,"[34, 35]","""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is among the most twisted anime I've ever seen and an outstanding vengeance tale from a culture stuffed to the gills with similarly-themed works. It is based on true events (whatever credibility you give to that) and takes place in feudal Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate. It's spectacularly graphic in both the sex and violence departments, but features extremely beautiful artwork and a pace and tone that is almost Kurosawan in it's meticulous and thoughtful storytelling and features a very gorgeous traditional Japanese soundtrack.  But as artistic as it is, there enough mayhem, nudity, and general psychosis here to rival any Asian grindhouse flick I've ever seen. This one is not for the kiddies.In the opening sequences the audience is treated to a retainer pleading with his daimyo to allow a tournament to use wooden blades rather than steel ones lest their most talented samurai die needlessly.  He then opens up his slit belly and pulls his entrails out with his bare hands, telling his lord that that would be the only result of a tournament using real swords.  His final plea falls on deaf ears and bloodthirsty eyes that have more than a hint of madness in them. As the tournament begins we see the first two samurai face off.  It is a one-armed swordsman versus a blind samurai.  While the audience mocks the pair, it is soon obvious that the two are not only skilled warriors, but have a past together.  The story of ""Shigurui"" is that past.Rewind to a few years back in time and we meet earnest sword pupil Gennosuke Fujiki and Seigen Irako, a stranger to the Kogan dojo who seeks audience with the sensei.  The two clash, leaving Fujiki embarrassed and possibly stripped of his status as the heir to the deadly techniques of the sword school.  Kogan Iwamoto is the deranged sensei whose advanced age regularly leaves him in a state of vulgar dementia with a string of neverending drool in the corner of his mouth and a habit of urinating on himself even as he performs feats of swordsmanship.  Even more disturbing, the man still has a sexual appetite when in his glassy-eyed stupor. As Kogan's concubine Lady Iku, she gets to bear the brunt of that, though the sensei's own daughter gets a taste as well.  The children of the town sing a song about Iku's body bringing misfortune and death to all of her lovers, but that doesn't deter Irako but getting a piece of the action.  This is something that he will regret as he seeks the title of heir to the secrets of the Kogan style. And eventually, each and every character will regret the chain of events that forms.As I said before, ""Shigurui"" is not for kids even if it does seem like a typical samurai anime on the surface.  There's plenty of viscera, eyeball abuse like you wouldn't believe, decapitation, and dismemberment. In fact, the Kogan school seeks to spread it's name not by killing those who challenge it, but by ""giving them a new look"" which is to say the cut off various facial features so all of Japan can see their prowess rather than hear about it.  Then there's the graphic sexual content which includes watching Kogan's drool fall upon his daughter as he ""inspects"" her suitability for breeding, a rather explicit but brief glimpse of cunnilingus -which I've NEVER seen in an anime (and no, I don't count hentai as true anime)- and a woman getting her nipple sliced off then watching her attacker pick it up and lovingly place it upon his tongue. Yeah, this is twisted stuff. Kogan is among the most intimidating and disgusting villains ever and the rest of the cast are more tragic victims then heroes.  In fact, I think it's safe to say that there are no heroes here at all; just brutality, cruelty, and selfish deceit.I really wish I could give this a perfect score because it is so harsh and uncompromising but still manages a plethora of beautiful and artistic flourishes that give this anime a credibility that few examples of the genre have anymore.  But there is a fatal flaw that left me feeling less then thrilled at the conclusion in spite of the fact that the final kill is quite possibly the most impressive I've ever seen animated.  While it is the best samurai anime I have seen in a long time, at only 12 episodes ""Shigurui"" becomes a victim of it's own slow pacing during the second half and the viewer can't help but feel a bit cheated at the lack of resolution in the story.  After the amazing setup of the first episode, we never see it revisited for a fitting conclusion.  It's almost like the staff got bored and just decided to move on before the story was done. A few more episodes -even one- could have easily garnered this show an unapologetic five star rating.  But frankly, it's close enough. This is an anime that will absolutely warrant repeat viewings.I am very pleased to say that this anime has been released in a full boxed set right off the bat.  None of the month(s)-long waits and customer-gougingwhile each disc is released individually.  Thanks, Funimation! While there is not much in the way of extras on the discs, there is a ""marathon play"" feature which means that the discs will play as a continuous film rather than making you fast-forward through the opening and closing credits every 20 minutes.  I hope to see more of these things in the future.  They are reason enough to buy this set.  If we support more quality anime releases that take the fans' wishes into account, maybe we'll see more of this kind of thing.""Shigurui: Death Frenzy"" is an outstanding adult anime that stops just short of all-time greatness, but is still an absolute must-own for fans of animated sex, violence, and chanbara films.  The soundtrack, animation, plot, and characters are all first-rate.  It's some of the best of classic Japanese arthouse cinema with all the cheap thrills of the grindhouse.  Buy, buy, buy!4 1/2 stars, rounded up for treating the fans right.",5,"""What does the demon's smile herald?""",1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,5910,"['Shigurui', 'Death', 'Frenzy', 'most', 'twisted',

1222925,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001OMZYEK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 1]","With a backdrop of true events and based on the manga series written by Takayuki Yamaguchi, the anime series ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is a very violent tale of lust, dark ambition and vengeance that takes place during the 1600's in the Tokugawa period. Yamaguchi took his ideas from the novel called ""Surugajyo Gozenjiai"" and with director Hiroshi Hamasaki, the two have put together a harrowingly beautiful anime series that pretty much took my breath away. The series is about the famed Kogan school of Japanese swordplay, which became famous in the Kagegawa region, mainly because of the tutelage of a mysterious swordsman named Iwamoto Kogan. Unlike the chambara films we've seen in the past, this is not a series about honor, loyalty and duty; it is a melodrama about a school, its sensei and his apprentices. IT IS NOT YOUR KID'S Anime.The series begins with two scarred warriors facing off against each other in a brutal contest to satisfy the bloodlust of a cruel lord Tadanaga Tokugawa; a blind swordsman named Irako Seigen (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) and a one-armed swordsman called Gennosuke Fijiki (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa). These two warriors carry the scars of a very violent and twisted past. They were bitter rivals under the tutelage of sword master Kogan Iwamoto (Seizou Katou); the two aspired to attain the mastery of the Kogan style secret techniques and to be worthy of their sensei's beautiful daughter Mie (Houko Kuwashima). This is the story of these two warriors who had mortally wounded each other--physically, emotionally and psychologically, all for the honor to become the heir to the Kogan school. Now they must gird themselves for one last battle...""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is a series divided into 12 parts (2 discs). The presentation contains beautiful animation, visceral and violent swordplay, and has been noted because of the amount of graphic sex and nudity. The screenplay and direction are both beautiful and ugly. It is beautiful because it utilizes superb style in its cinematography. The colors lean towards the use of earth colors, and a little muted which adds to its brooding, intense mood and gloomy style. This has been done to reflect on the bleakness of its subject matter which brings us to its ugly face. The ugliness I speak of hover mostly around in its disquieting storyline. The subject matter is about the darkness within the ""way of Bushido"". I wouldn't say that these men are true samurai who follow the ideals of that code--these men are very human, full of lust, greed, betrayal, and ambitions. Unlike other chambara features we have been privy to, they are NOT men to be admired for their character; they may be admired for their skills but they are mostly to be feared.The screenplay by Yamaguchi is quite intense, taut and very moody. In the school, we see the workings of its inner circles, and the rules that apply to the Iwamoto residence. The feature also utilizes some very effective use of metaphors and symbolism. The Cicada is an insect used to signify apprenticeship because of its noisy, vibrating qualities. The dragonfly represents unrelenting totality because of the straight direction in its flight. The Butterfly is used to signify beauty and the unpredictable nature of one's future. I thought it was wise direction to use the ""flashing"" naked effect when one engages in swordplay--I think when fighting, one's nature is utterly exposed and one is unprotected. Sure, it also displays the movement of muscles in engagements but it was a lot more than that. The direction relies on some fragmented sequences, to further give its characters their dimensions in the story. Quite clever and ingenious, the proceedings manage to maintain its intensity in not just its graphic violence.The action sequences aren't really your run-of-the-mill choreography. Slow-motion animation, freeze frames and close-ups are utilized. The swordplay is very graphic and it never holds back. Eyes and limbs are severed, beheadings, bowels and entrails are graphically shown, and looks very reminiscent to Japanese effects we've all been privy to. Dismemberments are done quite often, as well as ""skinning"" and faces and bones being smashed in. The thing is director Hamasaki does the Blood and Gore in a very artistic kind of way, it was impressive--not too repulsive but certainly shocking. The combatants imagine just how they would react to an attack before the actual combat begins which serves as a sort of a teaser to the viewer.The feature does have its share of graphic violence towards women, but I don't think it glorifies it at all. It uses those actions to display the cruelty of its characters, most specifically sensei Kogan; who manhandles his daughter and has a lot of sex with his mistress, lady Iku (Emi Shinohara) when he is in a state on dementia. Oh, this feature has a lot of graphic sex and nudity. There are some very twisted displays of torture and violence; castrations by fire, cut-off nipples and burned breasts are what you are in for. Incest and sick desires are also hinted at. Yes, this is one disturbing anime feature and not for the weak of heart.The characters are for the most part very human, in a way they give in to their carnal desires, pride and blind obedience--it does have certain undertones about curses and karma. Irako is the prideful apprentice, who almost whose goal is to attain fame and fortune--he is also a womanizer and proves to be his main weakness. Mie is the daughter of the master swordsman, Kogan; she is dutiful and becomes imbalanced in a way. Lady Iku is the beautiful mistress of Kogan who is always taunted at by children and believes her body to be cursed. Iwamoto Kogan is the sensei who becomes demented from time to time for reasons unspecified; probably due to his very violent ways. I suppose if a hero is to be had from this feature it would be Gennosuke, the stoic pupil, ever obedient to his sensei who carries a grudge against his rival--Gennosuke is driven to master the art. Let's not forget Gonzaemon Ushimata (Yosaku Yara), his one flaw may be his blind obedience.The animation is fluid and very beautiful and it was almost photorealistic. There are no bulging, over-expressive eyes and the facial expressions speak a lot for their emotions and manner. I thought it was wise for the animators to give its characters certain features quite unique to one another. Each separate scene have a use of one color hue to express its mood, but stays within earth colors--to signify its worldly workings in its environment. If there are some flaws, it would fall on some minor details undefined and it does lack some closure.""SHIGURUI DEATH FRENZY"" is one twisted and brilliant animated production. It successfully reaches a plateau that surprisingly mixes beauty and repulsive qualities. It is so beautiful that one would be hard-pressed to say that it is all about disturbing imagery yet NONE can deny its visceral, brooding tone. It does efficiently represent what it is trying to say and gets its message across; The beauty of swordsmanship can lead to one's damnation when wielded irresponsibly. ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is beautiful, and magnificently executed, but it also leaves a repulsive taste in your mouth. I am very impressed as to how it managed to balance beauty and artistry with ugliness and repulsive nature. I almost didn't want the show to end.Highly Recommended!
