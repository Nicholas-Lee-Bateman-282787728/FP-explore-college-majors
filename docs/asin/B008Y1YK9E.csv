1578606,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B008Y1YK9E,Boston Reader,"[4, 4]","In the fall of 1990, a new show was introduced to the audience that would follow the crime the aspect of the police detectives in the first half and prosecutors in the second half. At the time, Sgt. Greevey and Detective Logan were the investigators and Captain Cragen was their commanding officer. ADA Ben Stone and Paul Robinette were the prosecutors and Adam Schiff was their boss, the DA of New York County. And now by season 11, Adam Schiff, the only character left from season one, had resigned from the DA's office. In the season premiere, the then Mayor Giuliani introduces Nora Lewin to ADAs McCoy and Carmichael as the new DA of New York County. The episodes in this season were top notch. And so many headlines. The murder of a basketball player's pregnant mistress, the murder of a police officer, a spree shooting in a school, an incident arising out a national holiday and a drug smuggling Army wife are a few. Sports rage, animal testing, reality shows and problems inside prisons are just some of the topics arising from the episodes. As seen many times before, the great revolving door of casting for Law & Order gives a new character and takes an old one away. With Dianne Wiest's inclusion as Nora Lewin, comes Angie Harmon's departure as Abbie Carmichael. Another great season of Law & Order that is strongly recommended for all and any fans of the series. The only flaw with this product is the lack of bonus features/extras and the slim downed DVD case. I will not mention the lack of episode information as a flaw, because anyone who is reading this review can easily find at least three websites that lists the episodes and their plot summery. I will applaud the manufacturers for their decisions to not make double-sided DVD disks.",5,"A new decade, a new DA, a New Era",1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,1756,"['fall', '1990', 'new', 'show', 'was', 'introduced', 'audience', 'would', 'follow', 'crime', 'aspect', 'police', 'detectives', 'first', 'half', 'prosecutors', 'second', 'half', 'time', 'Sgt', 'Greevey', 'Detective', 'Logan', 'were', 'investigators', 'Captain', 'Cragen', 'was', 'commanding', 'officer', 'ADA', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'Paul', 'Robinette', 'were', 'prosecutors', 'Adam', 'Schiff', 'was', 'boss', 'DA', 'New', 'York', 'County', 'now', 'season', '11', 'Adam', 'Schiff', 'only', 'character', 'left', 'season', 'one', 'had', 'resigned', 'DA', 'office', 'season', 'premiere', 'then', 'Mayor', 'Giuliani', 'introduces', 'Nora', 'Lewin', 'ADAs', 'McCoy', 'Carmichael', 'new', 'DA', 'New', 'York', 'County', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'so', 'many', 'headlines', 'murder', 'basketball', 'player', 'pregnant', 'mistress', 'murder', 'police', 'officer', 'spree', 'shooting', 'school', 'incident', 'arising', 'out', 'national', 'holiday', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'Army', 'wife', 'are', 'few', 'Sports', 'rage', 'animal', 'testing', 'reality', 'shows', 'problems', 'prisons', 'are', 'just', 'topics', 'arising', 'episodes', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'great', 'revolving', 'door', 'casting', 'Law', 'Order', 'new', 'character', 'old', 'one', 'away', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'inclusion', 'Nora', 'Lewin', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'departure', 'Abbie', 'Carmichael', 'great', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'strongly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'series', 'only', 'flaw', 'product', 'lack', 'bonus', 'features/extras', 'slim', 'downed', 'DVD', 'case', 'will', 'not', 'mention', 'lack', 'episode', 'information', 'flaw', 'anyone', 'who', 'reading', 'review', 'can', 'easily', 'find', 'least', 'three', 'websites', 'episodes', 'plot', 'summery', 'will', 'applaud', 'manufacturers', 'decisions', 'not', 'make', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'disks']",N/A

1578615,AGB7UQZMVHNUJ,B008Y1YK9E,"NewDiane ""I live to read!""","[7, 7]","During a full decade of Steven Hill portraying the D.A. Adam Schiff, the role was almost entirely that of a cranky person with little input to a case. I'm not a fan of Dianne Wiest, but I have to admit her version of the D.A. has a lot more depth and contributes a lot to each episode. The rest of the cast remains the same; Jerry Orbach's Det. Lennie Briscoe is sarcastic and features a ""been there, done that"" attitude, Jesse Martin's Det. Ed Green is still a hot-head, Sam Waterston's Jack McCoy is a dogged, confrontational EADA and Angie Harmon's Abby Carmichael provides both cheesecake and some snark as an ADA. The episodes in this season are quite good, including some excellent guest stars (Clarence Williams III gives a powerful performance) and many of the scripts are riffs off the headlines. Most of those headlines took place in NYC and this season was 2000-2001, so a viewer out of state may not see those connections, but they're good ones. Yes, I'm still ticked off about the way the DVDs are packaged, with no inserts or playlists with summaries as there were in the early seasons. There don't seem to be any bonus tracks, either. This season marks the exit of Angie Harmon, which is a shame, but in its 20-year lifespan, Law & Order has many cast configurations and this is just another in a long line. Everyone gets replaced, sooner or later - I don't think there's a single character present through the whole span. One thing makes me rather nostalgic. This season, 2000 through 2001, was written and filmed before 9/11. In all the following seasons, there's a distinct change in the show, reflecting our new reality in NYC.",4,"Enter Dianne Wiest, exit Angie Harmon",1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,1646,"['full', 'decade', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'portraying', 'D.A', 'Adam', 'Schiff', 'role', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'cranky', 'person', 'little', 'input', 'case', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'have', 'admit', 'version', 'D.A', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'lot', 'episode', 'rest', 'cast', 'same', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Det', 'Lennie', 'Briscoe', 'sarcastic', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'attitude', 'Jesse', 'Martin', 'Det', 'Ed', 'Green', 'still', 'hot-head', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Jack', 'McCoy', 'dogged', 'confrontational', 'EADA', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'Abby', 'Carmichael', 'cheesecake', 'snark', 'ADA', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'including', 'excellent', 'guest', 'stars', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'powerful', 'performance', 'many', 'scripts', 'are', 'riffs', 'headlines', 'Most', 'headlines', 'took', 'place', 'NYC', 'season', 'was', '2000-2001', 'viewer', 'state', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'connections', ""'re"", 'good', 'ones', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'still', 'ticked', 'off', 'way', 'DVDs', 'are', 'packaged', 'inserts', 'playlists', 'summaries', 'were', 'early', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'either', 'season', 'exit', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'shame', '20-year', 'lifespan', 'Law', 'Order', 'many', 'cast', 'configurations', 'just', 'long', 'line', 'Everyone', 'replaced', 'sooner', 'later', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'character', 'present', 'whole', 'span', 'One', 'thing', 'rather', 'nostalgic', 'season', '2000', '2001', 'was', 'written', 'filmed', '9/11', 'following', 'seasons', 'distinct', 'change', 'show', 'reflecting', 'new', 'reality', 'NYC']",N/A
