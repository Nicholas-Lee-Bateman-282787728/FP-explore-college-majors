Shakur and Jim Belushi have some great scenes together. Unfortunately, the film turns incredibly stupid after the first hour. It seems like two different individuals wrote this film.

147261,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,0792841905,Crazy Jim,"[8, 9]","James Belushi and rapper Tupac Shakur in his final performance before his death are corrupt detectives who murder an undercover DEA agent and try to pin the murder on someone else. With the help of Belushi's stripper girlfriend, played by Lela Rechon, the two go on a rampage trying to find the perfect suspect to tag the murder to. When the murdered DEA agent's colleagues keep asking questions, the cops feel even more pressured to produce any evidence that distances them from the murder.Belushi and Shakur make for a good team in an otherwise average crime thriller. Belushi is the more brutal of the two as he goes around kicking and blasting while the more sympathetic Shakur is trying to keep it together and also seems to feel some form of guilt over the crimes that he and his partner have committed. As is often the case in films like this, the deeper the two cops get in trying to cover up their crime, the more their world seems to fall apart. Real criminals that they have arrested are acquitted because they have used the stolen evidence in other cases, some of their phony witnesseses are buckling under pressure, and the man who they try to stick the murder charge to turns out to be more than what they expected. Through it all, Belushi and Shakur have a real chemistry and the audience often finds itself rooting for these guys who are in all honesty, complete jerks.Many of Shakur's hardcore fans often praise his performance, which is real good, but Belushi is the one carrying the team here. Not to say that Shakur does not give an excellent performance but his role is less-defined so without Belushi, the film doesn't work. He is the one we all love to hate here. A scumbag homicide cop with homicidal tendencies who seems to keep testing his luck in every area. Shakur is more or less the guilty conscience of the duo. The more the story progresses, the worse he seems to feel about what he has done.The interesting thing is how Shakur's character compliments Belushi's. Once the two are no longer functioning as a unit, Belushi is lost in our eyes. The little sympathy we felt for his character is gone. The way that he distances himself from Shakur is one of the few noble things that he does in the film but unfortunately, without his partner to save him, he is beyond help. He is now just a renegade without a purpose and we as an audience know that wherever he is going, he is in for some trouble.""Gang Related"" is not an excellent movie. The story seems to wear thin in some areas but the film's two leads really keep this one above water. James Belushi turns in one of his best perfomances in some time in a role much different from what you're used to seeing from him. Shakur, in somewhat of a low-key performance is absolutely brilliant. Many people criticize rappers for trying to pick up a second paycheck without mastering the acting craft. Shakur is so natural as an actor, you would think it was his first love. It is a shame that Tupac never got an opportunity to be all that he could as far as acting goes. ""Related"" is not exactly an original concept but it is worth the time spent as it takes you for a nice little ride. On a side note, the Pac-influenced soundtrack of the film also helped give it a more professional feel.",3,GANG RELATED review,1060819200,"08 14, 2003",2003,3266,"['James', 'Belushi', 'rapper', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'final', 'performance', 'death', 'are', 'corrupt', 'detectives', 'who', 'murder', 'undercover', 'DEA', 'agent', 'try', 'pin', 'murder', 'someone', 'else', 'help', 'Belushi', 'stripper', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Lela', 'Rechon', 'two', 'go', 'rampage', 'trying', 'find', 'perfect', 'suspect', 'tag', 'murder', 'When', 'murdered', 'DEA', 'agent', 'colleagues', 'keep', 'asking', 'questions', 'cops', 'feel', 'even', 'more', 'pressured', 'produce', 'evidence', 'murder.Belushi', 'Shakur', 'make', 'good', 'team', 'otherwise', 'average', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Belushi', 'more', 'brutal', 'two', 'kicking', 'blasting', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Shakur', 'trying', 'keep', 'together', 'also', 'feel', 'form', 'guilt', 'crimes', 'partner', 'have', 'committed', 'often', 'case', 'films', 'deeper', 'two', 'cops', 'get', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'crime', 'more', 'world', 'fall', 'apart', 'Real', 'criminals', 'have', 'arrested', 'are', 'acquitted', 'have', 'used', 'stolen', 'evidence', 'other', 'cases', 'phony', 'witnesseses', 'are', 'buckling', 'pressure', 'man', 'who', 'try', 'stick', 'murder', 'charge', 'turns', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'expected', 'Belushi', 'Shakur', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'audience', 'often', 'rooting', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'honesty', 'complete', 'jerks.Many', 'Shakur', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'often', 'praise', 'performance', 'real', 'good', 'Belushi', 'one', 'carrying', 'team', 'here', 'Not', 'say', 'Shakur', 'not', 'give', 'excellent', 'performance', 'role', 'less-defined', 'so', 'Belushi', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'one', 'love', 'hate', 'here', 'scumbag', 'homicide', 'cop', 'homicidal', 'tendencies', 'who', 'keep', 'testing', 'luck', 'area', 'Shakur', 'more', 'less', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'duo', 'more', 'story', 'worse', 'feel', 'what', 'done.The', 'interesting', 'thing', 'how', 'Shakur', 'character', 'compliments', 'Belushi', 'Once', 'two', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'functioning', 'unit', 'Belushi', 'lost', 'eyes', 'little', 'sympathy', 'felt', 'character', 'gone', 'way', 'Shakur', 'one', 'few', 'noble', 'things', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'partner', 'save', 'help', 'now', 'just', 'renegade', 'purpose', 'audience', 'know', 'wherever', 'going', 'trouble', 'Gang', 'Related', 'not', 'excellent', 'movie', 'story', 'wear', 'thin', 'areas', 'film', 'two', 'leads', 'really', 'keep', 'one', 'water', 'James', 'Belushi', 'one', 'best', 'perfomances', 'time', 'role', 'much', 'different', 'what', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Shakur', 'somewhat', 'low-key', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Many', 'people', 'criticize', 'rappers', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'second', 'paycheck', 'mastering', 'acting', 'craft', 'Shakur', 'so', 'natural', 'actor', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'love', 'shame', 'Tupac', 'never', 'got', 'opportunity', 'be', 'could', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'Related', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'concept', 'time', 'spent', 'nice', 'little', 'ride', 'side', 'note', 'Pac-influenced', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'also', 'helped', 'give', 'more', 'professional', 'feel']",Gang Related VHS

147268,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,0792841905,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[1, 7]","It's Jim Belushi's acting that saves this film, yet his character is too dumb to be credible, as is the premise of the film.  He's a vicious corrupt cop who doesn't check anything twice, just shoots and doesn't ask any questions--later or at any time.  Yet because of Belushi's strong acting talents, his character is almost believable.He and his partner, played by a wildly overacting Tupac Shakur, have a nasty profitable scam going:  they set up trades with drug dealers, then kill the latter for the drugs which they can sell again.  Here's another problem--any money cops use for set ups has to be authorized by higher ups, then accounted for.  There's no mention of that in the film; how do they get away with keeping the money?  It's also mentioned that they've pulled this 11 times.  OK, so after all those times, NOBODY on the force investigates how it is that so many drug dealers have died after a set up put in place by the same two cops over and over?  Also not credible.The two thug cops kill a drug dealer who turns out to be an undercover DEA agent and fellow DEA guy Gary Cole pulls in and starts hassling the precinct for answers.  Cole also overacts here; he's a caricature, not a character.However, as an upscale attorney, James Earl Jones does a fine job, as does Dennis Quaid as a surprising suspect the thug cops have framed for the murder of the DEA agent.  Yet the surprise that comes with discovering Quaid's real identity is another plot point that severely strains credibility.The film seems to be a collection of characters thrown together to flesh out a collection of random, often non-credible, and distinctly unrelated story segments that have not been thought through.  Even the ending is disappointing--you can smell it coming a mile away.In spite of all the above, this is not a bad film because the pacing and momentum are strong enough--along with the acting of Belushi, Jones, and Quaid--to carry it through to its predictable end.  Belushi is on screen most of the time and he's a lot of fun to watch.  You're thinking no cop can be that dumb, but his acting chops make you feel that if a guy could be this crude and vicious, then, OK, maybe he COULD be that dumb.A truly mixed bag.

It all goes badly wrong when they mistakenly kill an undercover cop, and have to continuosly scramble to cover their tracks.  Tupac is perhaps surprisingly cast as the better of the two cops, the one with a conscience, a less imaginative director would have probably cast them the other way round.  Belushi plays the cop who will do anything to save himself, and to be honest, though Tupac is good in the film, Belushi does steal the show, Pac has more of a supporting role.There are many twists and coincidences in the plot, and it does keep you on edge, but it is not without it's faults though, the poor ending being the main problem.
