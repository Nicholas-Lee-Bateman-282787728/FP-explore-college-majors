Sometimes I thought I did know, but most of the time -- NOT!!!  These two Nana's are young women who want fame, fortune and love, but maybe not in that order.  Seems like they're impatient and want it all now.  I can relate.  This DVD set is good for those who are 20-something, or those who want to get together with their girlfriends and reminiscence about their college days gone by...By the way, Volume 3 comes out on February 2nd!!!!

Fortunately, she has some great friends around to lift her spirits. The 2 Nana's take a trip to see a Trapnest concert, where Nana O. rekindles her old relationship with Ren. Now that Nana O. is back in the arms of Ren, Nana K. gets a chance to meet the Tranpnest bassist. Her wounded heart allows Takumi to talk her into sleeping with him. Now she is infatuated with a man that seems like a slimeball, and the guy who really cares for her is heartbroken.This volume is pretty good. It's hard to say whether I liked it better than volume 1. They are both good, but totally different. I think that the show is definitely getting better at this point. You know a show is good when you want to get inside it and dry one of the character's tears or kick another character's ass. I'm totally glad that I saw this volume, and can't wait to see the rest of the series.

The only things that are in english were the menus and the subtitles. It came from japan itself, so I am very happy to own an original boxset of the Nana series. It is my favorite anime series, and if you are into romance and drama, this is for you.It starts as two different girls both named Nana meet on a train, they are both going to Tokyo. They talk for a few hours, then don't see each other for awhile. Then they both run into each other AGAIN when they are both looking at the same apartment to buy. They end up becoming roommates and a huge bond of friendship forms. The series is about how they tie into each other's lives as they both go through romance and their own dreams to get to where they want to be, but keep their friendship strong through everything.It offers real life situations of drama and romance. The emotions are deep and pure, and will even leave tears.This is one series I highly recomend. You will love it.

1159284,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B0018BA758,Mir,"[3, 5]","Spoilers Galore. Tread with caution if you haven't read the manga:I really liked Nana, the first flick based on the popular manga about two Japanese gals, both named Nana, who end up via coincidence/fate becoming roommates, then best friends. Both girls have serious relationship issues and both end up suffering setbacks. Together, though, they find a harbor with each other and start to move toward love again. The first flick had Ryuhei Matsuda as Ren, and while he's not as handsome  as the taller actor who plays Ren in Nana 2, Matsuda was actually a more compelling presence and had real chemistry in his scenes with Mika in Nana 1.In Nana 2, rocker Nana's career starts to move forward, which is nice, but I get nuts about how she still keeps a distance from Ren,who clearly loves her and wants he to live with him. I do not get this girl and her pride, but pride is her main failing and it continues to be an obstacle. The other Nana (Hachi) turns into this really mushy, submissive, nothing, and it's horrible to watch. Really horrible. Here was this energetic, bouncy gal without much in terms of accomplishment (other than being a super cook and chipper cute gal), and in the face of meeting a mystifyingly distant one minute and mystifyingly insightful lover the next dream guy (played by the uberhottie Tetsuji Tamayama, who frankly gives me the vapors he's so hot), she turns into an aproned soulless mistress. Ick. My skin crawls.And yet, we do understand why she chooses the hottie rich rocker over Nobu. Nobu is sweet, funny, endearing, thoughtful and very easy to like. We think, ""Oh, surely she's gonna pick him."" But no. She picks the broody, thoughtless, but insightful hottie. And explains why. And, yes, we get it, but I still hated that she did.Nuff said.I loved the Hyde song they used in the first film, a terrifically catchy song you keep singing after the movie is over, performed very nicely by the Black Stones (the group in the flick of which Nana is the frontwoman). Glamourous Sky. (Do head over to youtube and search for the live performance by Hyde, shirtless, with Kaz on guitar, which is a real treat.) No song in this film caught my fancy. Pity.I agree with the previous commenters that the original Hachi had a certain charm and cute factor that was more muted in Hachi in Nana 2. Mika Nakashima may not be the greatest actress and all, but I think she does a really good job portraying Nana (the rocker), with her pencil-thin legs and arms and moody expressions. I love the scene where she comforts Nobu in the street after revealing to him a painful plot twist.I missed the delectably upper-lipped Kenichi Matsuyama, but the boyish actor cast as the bassist was quite adorably gangly and sweet.I wish they'd given Ren more screen time. Seems to me he was short-shrifted, and that actor was a hottie giving Takumi a visual run for the money.Really, if you like hot Japanese boys, this is a good film to catch some eye candy. If you like romantic themes and stories with musicians who will perform for you, this will do that. But be prepared to wanna slap both these gals upside the head for some of their choices.And overall, it's enjoyable, if lacking some of the drive of Nana, the first.",3,"Had some good moments, but I felt let down by both Nanas and no catchy song in this one",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,3230,"['Spoilers', 'Galore', 'Tread', 'caution', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'manga', 'really', 'liked', 'Nana', 'first', 'flick', 'based', 'popular', 'manga', 'two', 'Japanese', 'gals', 'named', 'Nana', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'coincidence/fate', 'becoming', 'roommates', 'then', 'best', 'friends', 'girls', 'have', 'serious', 'relationship', 'issues', 'end', 'up', 'suffering', 'setbacks', 'Together', 'though', 'find', 'harbor', 'other', 'start', 'move', 'love', 'again', 'first', 'flick', 'had', 'Ryuhei', 'Matsuda', 'Ren', 'not', 'as', 'handsome', 'taller', 'actor', 'who', 'Ren', 'Nana', '2', 'Matsuda', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'compelling', 'presence', 'had', 'real', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'Mika', 'Nana', '1.In', 'Nana', '2', 'rocker', 'Nana', 'career', 'move', 'forward', 'nice', 'get', 'nuts', 'how', 'still', 'distance', 'Ren', 'who', 'clearly', 'live', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'girl', 'pride', 'pride', 'main', 'failing', 'be', 'obstacle', 'other', 'Nana', 'Hachi', 'really', 'mushy', 'submissive', 'nothing', 'horrible', 'watch', 'Really', 'horrible', 'Here', 'was', 'energetic', 'bouncy', 'gal', 'much', 'terms', 'accomplishment', 'other', 'being', 'super', 'cook', 'chipper', 'cute', 'gal', 'face', 'meeting', 'mystifyingly', 'distant', 'one', 'minute', 'mystifyingly', 'insightful', 'next', 'dream', 'guy', 'played', 'uberhottie', 'Tetsuji', 'Tamayama', 'who', 'frankly', 'vapors', 'so', 'hot', 'aproned', 'soulless', 'mistress', 'Ick', 'skin', 'crawls.And', 'yet', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'hottie', 'rich', 'rocker', 'Nobu', 'Nobu', 'sweet', 'funny', 'endearing', 'thoughtful', 'very', 'easy', 'like', 'think', 'Oh', 'surely', 'gon', 'pick', 'broody', 'thoughtless', 'insightful', 'hottie', 'why', 'yes', 'get', 'still', 'hated', 'did.Nuff', 'said.I', 'loved', 'Hyde', 'song', 'used', 'first', 'film', 'terrifically', 'catchy', 'song', 'keep', 'singing', 'movie', 'performed', 'very', 'nicely', 'Black', 'Stones', 'group', 'flick', 'Nana', 'frontwoman', 'Glamourous', 'Sky', 'Do', 'head', 'youtube', 'search', 'live', 'performance', 'Hyde', 'shirtless', 'Kaz', 'guitar', 'real', 'treat', 'song', 'film', 'caught', 'fancy', 'Pity.I', 'agree', 'previous', 'commenters', 'original', 'Hachi', 'had', 'certain', 'charm', 'cute', 'factor', 'was', 'more', 'muted', 'Hachi', 'Nana', '2', 'Mika', 'Nakashima', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'actress', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Nana', 'rocker', 'pencil-thin', 'legs', 'arms', 'moody', 'expressions', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'Nobu', 'street', 'revealing', 'painful', 'plot', 'twist.I', 'missed', 'delectably', 'upper-lipped', 'Kenichi', 'Matsuyama', 'boyish', 'actor', 'cast', 'bassist', 'was', 'quite', 'adorably', 'gangly', 'sweet.I', 'wish', ""'d"", 'given', 'Ren', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'short-shrifted', 'actor', 'was', 'hottie', 'giving', 'Takumi', 'visual', 'run', 'money.Really', 'like', 'hot', 'Japanese', 'boys', 'good', 'film', 'catch', 'eye', 'candy', 'like', 'romantic', 'themes', 'stories', 'musicians', 'who', 'will', 'perform', 'will', 'do', 'be', 'prepared', 'wan', 'na', 'slap', 'gals', 'upside', 'head', 'choices.And', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'lacking', 'drive', 'Nana', 'first']",NANA 2
