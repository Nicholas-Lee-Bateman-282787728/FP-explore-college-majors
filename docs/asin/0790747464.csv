117998,A39AWL2FKWDFK6,0790747464,Cory D. Slipman,"[6, 6]","'Thirty Seconds over Tokyo"" directed by Mervyn LeRoy is a wartime produced tribute to the earliest air raids made into Japan in 1942, orchestrated by General Jimmy Doolittle.Establishing acting veteran Spencer Tracy playing the authoritative Doolittle plays largely a supporting role in this film.  The true story is based on the diary kept by Army Air Corps flier Lt. Ted Lawton, a man under Doolittle's command played sympathetically by Van Johnson.  Johnson and a number of other flyboys including actors Robert Mitchum and Robert Walker had volunteered for a secret mission which would require months of training.  They practiced takeoffs on a short runway presumably to simulate the deck of an aircraft carrier.  Their mission was to conduct bombing raids on the Japanese mainland to prove that these targets were vulnerable and to hopefully curb the far reaching expansion of the Imperial Japanese forces.The first part of the film establishes the camaraderie of the men during training and gives us a view into their personal side.  The newlywed Johnson is married to his wholesome wife Ellen played by Phyllis Thaxter.  After 6 months of marriage and all of two weeks alone together she of course is pregnant.The men finally depart on a aircraft carrier to commence their mission.  This begins the second part of the film.  We follow Johnson's crew as he soars across the Tokyo landscape is some very nice footage. Their strategy was to drop their payload and head to some secure landing strips in China.  Running out of fuel they have to ditch their plane and crash land off the Chinese coast.  The badly injured crew in rescued by some pariotic Chinese rebels whose abhorence of the Japanese make them wonderful allies.The Chinese shelter the airmen sheltering them from capture and shuttling them from village to village. They  courageously manage to arrange for them to be transported back to the U.S. command.Johnson who is badly mutilated fears that his infirmities will cause his loving wife to reject him.",4,Heroic action in the Pacific theatre,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,2021,"[""'Thirty"", 'Seconds', 'Tokyo', 'directed', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'wartime', 'produced', 'tribute', 'earliest', 'air', 'raids', 'made', 'Japan', '1942', 'orchestrated', 'General', 'Jimmy', 'Doolittle.Establishing', 'acting', 'veteran', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'playing', 'authoritative', 'Doolittle', 'largely', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'diary', 'kept', 'Army', 'Air', 'Corps', 'flier', 'Lt.', 'Ted', 'Lawton', 'man', 'Doolittle', 'command', 'played', 'sympathetically', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Johnson', 'number', 'other', 'flyboys', 'including', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'had', 'volunteered', 'secret', 'mission', 'would', 'require', 'months', 'training', 'practiced', 'takeoffs', 'short', 'runway', 'presumably', 'simulate', 'deck', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'mission', 'was', 'conduct', 'bombing', 'raids', 'Japanese', 'mainland', 'prove', 'targets', 'were', 'vulnerable', 'hopefully', 'curb', 'far', 'reaching', 'expansion', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'forces.The', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'camaraderie', 'men', 'training', 'view', 'personal', 'side', 'newlywed', 'Johnson', 'married', 'wholesome', 'wife', 'Ellen', 'played', 'Phyllis', 'Thaxter', '6', 'months', 'marriage', 'two', 'weeks', 'alone', 'together', 'course', 'pregnant.The', 'men', 'finally', 'depart', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'commence', 'mission', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'follow', 'Johnson', 'crew', 'Tokyo', 'landscape', 'very', 'nice', 'footage', 'strategy', 'was', 'drop', 'payload', 'head', 'secure', 'landing', 'strips', 'China', 'Running', 'fuel', 'have', 'ditch', 'plane', 'crash', 'land', 'Chinese', 'coast', 'badly', 'injured', 'crew', 'rescued', 'pariotic', 'Chinese', 'rebels', 'abhorence', 'Japanese', 'make', 'wonderful', 'Chinese', 'shelter', 'airmen', 'sheltering', 'capture', 'shuttling', 'village', 'village', 'courageously', 'manage', 'arrange', 'be', 'transported', 'back', 'U.S.', 'command.Johnson', 'who', 'badly', 'mutilated', 'fears', 'infirmities', 'will', 'cause', 'loving', 'wife', 'reject']",N/A

118013,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,0790747464,Great Movie Addict,"[2, 2]","After watching the disastrous, multi-million-dollar hokum in 'Pearl Harbor' this weekend, I got therapy by going straight home to re-play this wonderful 1944 classic from Mervyn LeRoy.  Accurate, understated heroism (none of the sappy hype from 'Pearl Harbor', thank you), and a wonderful recreation of emotions and attitudes of the era.  Historically accurate down to the crew's names (some even look like those in old photos, even the young Chinese doctor is a virtual twin to the real one, who was photographed by DooLittle).  It takes a while to get to the Hornet take-off sequence, but it's worth it.  I first saw this movie as a kid in its 1949 re-release; I sat on the edge of my seat then, and I still get a chill watching this film today.  Makes the fantasy ending of 'Pearl Harbor' look like an over-hyped comic book.  ""30 Seconds"" is proof that in the old days, the Hollywood pro's really knew how to mount a good movie.  The action sequences are beautifully done -- and no computers back then, either.  It's a lost art, so GET THIS MOVIE before it disappears under the current wave of mindless multimedia junk.  Much credit goes to director Mervyn LeRoy (""Little Caesar"", ""Mister Roberts"", and many other classics), who was obsessed with technical and historical accuracy.  Despite the fact that ""Tokyo"" is actually shots of coastal cities in Oregon and Washington state, and the B25's are B25-D's instead of the original 'B' models (which were battle casualties by 1944), one has to admit that the effects are chlllingly effective.  Fans of the Superman films will get a kick out of seeing pretty and talented young Phyliss Thaxter, who played Clark Kent's mom in 1978, and who's simply perfect as a war-time bride.  Personal dramas aside, this movie succeeds quite well as an ""action"" film that more closely resembles the real, harrowing story than any of the megabuck diasters of the last few years.  The b&w photography is an example of the cinematic artistry that peaked at MGM in the 40's.  It's a shame that garbage like ""Pearl Harbor"" gets a market-blasting DVD release while the wasted film is still warm in the can, while ""30 Seconds"" languishes in VHS.  Come on, Turner Classics, get this beautiful camera work onto DVD as soon as you can.  The VHS print, meanwhile, is still fairly decent. [update 2009: Finally got my gleeful hands on a DVD edition from Amazon. Even my wife liked this movie, sat straight-up chewing her fingernails in suspense from the second half onward. The movie gets deeper into characters than most films do. The DVD transfer is of excellent quality, so much so that I played this DVD occasionally just to see the images onscreen; gives you a great appreciation for what good cinematographers could do with black and white.

118022,A2K8LG0NQ7W5X0,0790747464,J. Collins,"[54, 63]","""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" is based on the book of the same name, authored by Captain Lawson.  The book tells the story of the training, execution and aftermath of the ""Doolittle Raid"" through the perspective of Lawson (and to a lesser degree, his crew).  Lawson never meant the book to be more than a personal retelling of what happened.  The movie pretty faithfully follows the book, though some wartime schmaltz is tossed in as well.The strike itself was in fact designed primarily to raise morale of the homefront and US armed forces, who were taking a pounding in the first 6 months of the war in the Pacific.  The success of the raid, made Doolittle-already famous as an air racer in the 30's- and the B25 household words.This is ironic in the B25's case as it was accepted for production in the 1940-41 ""50000 a year"" aircraft expansion authorized by President Roosevelt.  As a medium bomber it really had no doctrinal role in airpower as conceived by the AAC at the time; it was accepted because it was reasonably quick, had excellent range and was easy to fly.  No small advantage, when the average age of the pilots who would take this aircraft into combat was 22....  The aircraft proved one of the most versatile of the war, especially after conversion into an attack aircraft with the bombardier comparment replaced with a solid-nose of guns and cannon.  Doolittle basically chose the aircraft for the simple reason they were available (the upper echelon refused to release the B17/B24 ""Strategic"" Bombers for what may be a suicide mission) and had the range.  Only after he saw what the AAC was willing to cough up did the idea for carrier transport come about-contrary to myth.The movie glosses over the development of the plan, and the frustrations Doolittle and his planners encountered.  Understandably, since the now USAAF senior leadership would look uncooperative-which they were.  Instead the movie gives some standard ""Hollywood"" personalities:  the naive but determined kid from Montana, the loudmouthed but sincere Southern person etc  They indulge in some all-American antics up to the time they start training for the mission  (My Father who was a crewmember during WW2, would say when he saw what the actors were doing, ""crews NEVER acted like that, EVER"".  Certainly, a crew wagging wings while singing ""Rockabye Baby"" would've been as peculiar then as now.)  Some great social history is here for the viewer who looks for it. This film was made in 1944, and the current issues in US society of that time make it into the movie.  Also,the B25 footage is outstanding with some of the actual raid footage-the Nav with the movie camera was a real person-combined with stock and model footage.  Actual B25 crews were used for the formation flying and training portions of the film.  The operations details make this film valuable as a historical piece.  As other reviewers have said, doubtful CGI could improve on the aerial sequences.So, for anyone interested in WW2 aviation, this is a must-see; the running time given over to schmaltzy ""All-Americanisms"" instead of the planning keep me from giving it 5 stars, though.",4,"It's a Wartime, war movie after all",1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,3147,"['Thirty', 'Seconds', 'Tokyo', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'authored', 'Captain', 'Lawson', 'book', 'story', 'training', 'execution', 'aftermath', 'Doolittle', 'Raid', 'perspective', 'Lawson', 'lesser', 'degree', 'crew', 'Lawson', 'never', 'meant', 'book', 'be', 'more', 'personal', 'retelling', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'pretty', 'faithfully', 'book', 'wartime', 'schmaltz', 'tossed', 'well.The', 'strike', 'was', 'fact', 'designed', 'primarily', 'raise', 'morale', 'homefront', 'US', 'armed', 'forces', 'who', 'were', 'taking', 'pounding', 'first', '6', 'months', 'war', 'Pacific', 'success', 'raid', 'made', 'Doolittle-already', 'famous', 'air', 'racer', ""30's-"", 'B25', 'household', 'words.This', 'ironic', 'B25', 'case', 'was', 'accepted', 'production', '1940-41', '50000', 'year', 'aircraft', 'expansion', 'authorized', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'medium', 'bomber', 'really', 'had', 'doctrinal', 'role', 'airpower', 'conceived', 'AAC', 'time', 'was', 'accepted', 'was', 'reasonably', 'quick', 'had', 'excellent', 'range', 'was', 'easy', 'fly', 'small', 'advantage', 'when', 'average', 'age', 'pilots', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'aircraft', 'combat', 'was', '22', 'aircraft', 'proved', 'one', 'most', 'versatile', 'war', 'especially', 'conversion', 'attack', 'aircraft', 'bombardier', 'comparment', 'replaced', 'solid-nose', 'guns', 'cannon', 'Doolittle', 'basically', 'chose', 'aircraft', 'simple', 'reason', 'were', 'available', 'upper', 'echelon', 'refused', 'release', 'B17/B24', 'Strategic', 'Bombers', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'suicide', 'mission', 'had', 'range', 'Only', 'saw', 'what', 'AAC', 'was', 'willing', 'cough', 'up', 'did', 'idea', 'carrier', 'transport', 'come', 'about-contrary', 'myth.The', 'movie', 'glosses', 'development', 'plan', 'frustrations', 'Doolittle', 'planners', 'encountered', 'Understandably', 'now', 'USAAF', 'senior', 'leadership', 'would', 'look', 'uncooperative-which', 'were', 'Instead', 'movie', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'personalities', 'naive', 'determined', 'kid', 'Montana', 'loudmouthed', 'sincere', 'Southern', 'person', 'etc', 'indulge', 'all-American', 'antics', 'time', 'start', 'training', 'mission', 'Father', 'who', 'was', 'crewmember', 'WW2', 'would', 'say', 'when', 'saw', 'what', 'actors', 'were', 'doing', 'crews', 'NEVER', 'acted', 'EVER', 'Certainly', 'crew', 'wagging', 'wings', 'singing', 'Rockabye', 'Baby', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'peculiar', 'then', 'as', 'now', 'great', 'social', 'history', 'here', 'viewer', 'who', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1944', 'current', 'issues', 'US', 'society', 'time', 'make', 'movie', 'Also', 'B25', 'footage', 'outstanding', 'actual', 'raid', 'footage-the', 'Nav', 'movie', 'camera', 'was', 'real', 'person-combined', 'stock', 'model', 'footage', 'Actual', 'B25', 'crews', 'were', 'used', 'formation', 'flying', 'training', 'portions', 'film', 'operations', 'details', 'make', 'film', 'valuable', 'historical', 'piece', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'doubtful', 'CGI', 'could', 'improve', 'aerial', 'sequences.So', 'anyone', 'interested', 'WW2', 'aviation', 'must-see', 'running', 'time', 'given', 'schmaltzy', 'All-Americanisms', 'instead', 'planning', 'keep', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'though']",N/A

Neither is the case with this highly exciting movie.  Starring Van Johnson, Spencer Tracy, and Phyllis Thaxter, this movie does an excellent job of accurately portraying the events of the Doolittle raid as it actually happened.  Van Johnson stars as Ted Lawson, an actual pilot in the Doolittle raid.  The story of the raid is told through his eyes.  I've read several books about the raid, and I was pleased that the producers of the film were so correct in their filmmaking.  The movie shows the entire process from beginning to end.  From the training at Eglin base in Florida to the take-off from the deck of the USS Hornet, each minute detail is covered with historical correctness.Lawson himself was an advisor to the film.  This helped even more with the historical aspect.  Van Johnson was an excellent choice to play Lawson.  His performance throughout the film made it a pleasure to watch.  Phyllis Thaxter does a wonderful job as Ellen Lawson.  Top billing for this film went to Spencer Tracy as Jimmy Doolittle, but his role is really an extended cameo; Lawson and his crew are the real stars of the movie.Perhaps the best part of the movie was the actual take-off from the Hornet, the bombing of Tokyo, and the crash landing in China.  unable to parachute from their plane, the crew of Lawson's B-25 were forced to crash land.  Lawson was thrown through the cockpit glass upon landing and suffered many broken teeth as well as a severely damaged leg which would later have to be amputated.  Fortunately, the crew was aided by many Chinese who risked their lives to keep the flyers safe and eventually they are returned to safe ground.  Lawson is concerned about how his wife will feel about him after his leg had been removed, but the ending tells it all. I highly recommend this excellent film.

Doolittle.Directed by Mervyn LeRoyApril 1942 - stunned by Pearl Harbor and a string of defeats, America needed a victory and to that end, Colonel Jimmy Dolittle, a former air racer and stunt pilot, devised a plan for a daring raid on the heart of Japan itself. To do this, he must train army bomber pilots to do something no one ever dreamed possible - launch 16 fully loaded B-25 bombers from an aircraft carrier 400 hundred miles from Japanese soil!The film concentrates on Lt. Ted Lawson (Van Johnson) the commander of a B25, the Fractured Frog, and its crew. Having accepted the mission without really knowing what they will have to do, their first task is to learn to take off with only 500 ft. of runway. They also have to learn to drop bombs without the use of their Norton bomb sites. Once they've dropped their bombs on various Japanese targets, they are to fly on to a part of China that is not under Japanese control.There's nothing dated about the cinematography employed here. When the Ruptured Duck flies over Tokyo, you feel like you're right there in the cockpit and the crew's low-altitude escape to China is nothing less than harrowing.One of the all-time great TRUE adventures of WWII. Just to see the B-25's that they used in the film really gives you a sense of what these brave men actually dealt with on a daily basis.

Made the year after the actual event, the trials that Ted Lawson and his crew endured are unbelievable.  If made today, the film would be much more graphic by showing just how injured Lawson was when he had to make his escape through China after crash-landing.  In the book, he describes it well enough to make me shudder to this day.  True to the cinematic style of the 40's, Ellen Lawson is a sweet and enduring woman, true to her man and concerned about her appearance.  Having met the real Ellen, I can tell you that she is full of fire, personality, and even sweeter than the movie portrays.  This movie gives you a glimpse into a portion of the Doolittle Raid, America's first retaliatory strike on Japan after Pearl Harbor.  If you love this film, I would also recommend that you read the book for an even deeper appreciation of these heroic men, along with their Chinese friends who risked their lives to save them.  Read anything and everything that CV Glines (Carrol V. Glines) has written about Jimmy Doolittle and his Raiders.  Some of the men didn't make it out of China... that book is called &quot;Four Came Home&quot; and it shook me to the core. There are only 18 Raiders still living and it's important that we recognize these little old men for the heroes that they were/are.

118034,A2T049UQONS0OY,0790747464,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 1]","It seems relevant and important to say something about my favorite World War II film -- ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" -- on Veteran's Day. While I did not serve in the military, my dad fought in WW2 in the Pacific at Tarawa, one of the Marines' most heralded battles in history. Dad told me 6,000 men were killed in the four-day shootout for Tarawa, a little island in the Pacific we wanted for an air strip. Five thousand of those deaths, he told me, were Japanese. We buried the Americans in grave and dug trenches for the enemy dead, he said.None of this says anything about this great film, which relates a time much earlier in the war and reconstructs our first mainland attack on Japan. What makes this film great is its authenticity, being filmed while the war was taking place, and its importance as a gift to the shattered American psyche. Knowing war was imminent after the Nazis overwhlemed Europe beginning in 1939, Americans still did not want to enter the war. After Pearl Harbor -- the equivalent of this generation's 9/11 -- there was no question we would go to war.Spencer Tracy is magnificent, as always, playing Gen. Doolittle, the leader of the raid. What has always been most interesting for me on repeated viewing of this film is the training the pilots went through in order to lift a B-25 from the deck of a World War II-era carrier. I've seen a B-25 up close; they don't look all that big, truth to tell. Still, it had to be a trial to do this in 1942 -- get one airborne from the relatively short running distance of a carrier deck.The aftermath of the attack, when the pilots crash their planes in the Pacific off China, and the military personnel's recovery from that Japanese-dominated country, has also always fascinated me. For these and many other reasons, this film is essential viewing for anyone that likes war films. I would be remiss if I did not admit my own private admission about ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"": I've always enjoyed Ted Turner's colorized version he ran on TNT and Turner Classic Movies far more than the original black and white.",5,A Veteran's Day tribute to a great WWII actioner,1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,2082,"['relevant', 'important', 'say', 'something', 'favorite', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'Thirty', 'Seconds', 'Tokyo', 'Veteran', 'Day', 'did', 'not', 'serve', 'military', 'dad', 'fought', 'WW2', 'Pacific', 'Tarawa', 'one', 'Marines', 'most', 'heralded', 'battles', 'history', 'Dad', 'told', '6,000', 'men', 'were', 'killed', 'four-day', 'shootout', 'Tarawa', 'little', 'island', 'Pacific', 'wanted', 'air', 'strip', 'Five', 'thousand', 'deaths', 'told', 'were', 'Japanese', 'buried', 'Americans', 'grave', 'dug', 'trenches', 'enemy', 'dead', 'said.None', 'anything', 'great', 'film', 'time', 'much', 'earlier', 'war', 'first', 'mainland', 'attack', 'Japan', 'What', 'film', 'great', 'authenticity', 'being', 'filmed', 'war', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'importance', 'gift', 'shattered', 'American', 'psyche', 'Knowing', 'war', 'was', 'imminent', 'Nazis', 'overwhlemed', 'Europe', 'beginning', '1939', 'Americans', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'enter', 'war', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'equivalent', 'generation', '9/11', 'was', 'question', 'would', 'go', 'war.Spencer', 'Tracy', 'magnificent', 'always', 'playing', 'Gen.', 'Doolittle', 'leader', 'raid', 'What', 'always', 'been', 'most', 'interesting', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'film', 'training', 'pilots', 'went', 'order', 'lift', 'B-25', 'deck', 'World', 'War', 'II-era', 'carrier', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'B-25', 'up', 'close', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'big', 'truth', 'tell', 'Still', 'had', 'be', 'trial', 'do', '1942', 'get', 'one', 'airborne', 'relatively', 'short', 'running', 'distance', 'carrier', 'deck.The', 'aftermath', 'attack', 'when', 'pilots', 'crash', 'planes', 'Pacific', 'China', 'military', 'personnel', 'recovery', 'Japanese-dominated', 'country', 'also', 'always', 'fascinated', 'many', 'other', 'reasons', 'film', 'essential', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'war', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', 'not', 'admit', 'own', 'private', 'admission', 'Thirty', 'Seconds', 'Tokyo', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'colorized', 'version', 'ran', 'TNT', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'far', 'more', 'original', 'black', 'white']",N/A

Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is based on the book by Captain Ted. W. Lawson and Robert Considine, and it is Van Johnson as Lawson who is the main character in this film.  Spencer Tracy's role as Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle is basically a supporting part, which, or course, Tracy nails.  The film is an exciting and essentially faithful retelling of the famous air raid of Japan that was America's first significant payback for the raid on Pearl Harbor.  The film not only has a documentary style, including actual footage of the B-25s taking off from the carrier Hornet, it also uses the real name of the raiders, which is a nice tribute to the members of the Doolittle Raid.  Covering both the grueling training as well as the actual raid, &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; has the deserved reputation of being one of the most accurate films produced during World War II about the actual war, winning the 1945 Oscar for Best Special Effects.  The cast includes Robert Walker, Don DeFore, and a very young Robert Mitchum.

118040,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0790747464,Linda Linguvic,"[84, 88]","This 1944 film, shot in black and white, is based on a true story. Four months after Pearl Harbor had been bombed, Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle devised a plan for a daring raid on the heart of Japan itself. To do this he had to train army bomber pilots to do something no one ever dreamed possible - launch 16 fully loaded bombers from an aircraft carrier. It was a success. And this film is a tribute to those men.Van Johnson stars as Lieutenant Ted Lawson and he does a great job as the fighter pilot who is sometimes scared, confused and very human. The supporting cast includes Spencer Tracy as Doolittle, and Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Robert Walker and a dozen other young actors whose names never did become household words. Phyllis Thaxter is cast as Van Johnson's young wife and the romance scenes they have together, complete with background violin music, are the only scenes I found a bit too overdone for modern tastes.The rest of the film however, was full of action.  I can well understand why it won an Academy Award for special effects because it put the audience right there on those little planes along with the men and used newsreel footage to supplement the scenes shot inside the planes. I really learned about the mission and the nature of the training, and felt the authenticity of a film that was actually made in 1944, not just a revisionist historian's interpretation. Here, the slang was real. They got the &quot;dope&quot; on what was going on, found out that everything was &quot;swell&quot; and the women were called &quot;girls&quot;. Everyone smoked cigarettes too, a reality the recent politically correct &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; seemed to ignore. Also, considering the hatred that raged during the war, I was surprised that in one scene Van Johnson says that his family had a Japanese gardener and he didn't seem like a bad guy. And when Doolittle addresses his men before they take off, he talks about the fact that the men will be taking civilian lives as well as the military targets. The raid was successful but the film doesn't end there. Van Johnson and his crew were shot down over China and were treated like heroes by the Chinese. Some of the scenes that followed, where Van Johnson's leg has to be removed are harrowing and displayed his fine acting skills.To get a good understanding of what it must have been like in 1944 in America, this video is a must. Not only do we get a feeling of the patriotism, we also hear the music, hear the slang and get a sense of time and place that is impossible to re-create 50 years later.

Van Johnson plays Dawson and Jimmy Doolittle is enacted by Spencer Tracy.  Robert Mitchum has a minor role as Dawson's friend in what may have been one of his first featured roles.The movie follows Dawson and the crew of the ""Ruptured Duck"" from volunteering for a secret mission, through the training required for an aircraft carrier take-off, into the brief bombing raid itself followed by the crash landing in Japanese occupied China. The rescue of the crew by the Chinese and the eventual reunion of Dawson and his wife in the States makes up about half of the movie.Although this is a war movie the crux of the story is about the people involved and the interactions of a group of the ""greatest generation"".

118045,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0790747464,magellan,"[9, 9]","This movie is a refreshing respite from such current over-hyped and unrealistic war movies as Pearl Harbor. The movie realistically and unsentimentally tells the story of the daring Doolittle raid, concentrating on the crew of one of the 16 bombers, headed up by Van Johnson as captain, where he turns in a fine performance. But the other characters are also nicely drawn and neither over-romanticized nor over-sentimentalized. Some of the action sequences, such as the actual bombing raid at low altitude over Tokyo, are truly spectacular. I don't know how they did it, without modern technology, but this scene could stand up to any modern movie's special effects any time. The movie also realistically portrays the training for the mission, where the crews are taught to take off in 500 feet instead of 1500 feet, the normal take-off distance for a B-24. As a result, you get to see a lot of the inside of the planes as well as the outside, again adding to the overall realism. Interestingly, Tracy doesn't have that big a part in the movie, compared to Johnson and his crew, but when he does appear, usually to just brief the men on their upcoming mission, he's nevertheless superb. Another interesting aspect of the movie is Doolittle's discussion of civilian casualties, and that any pilot who objects to killing civilians can withdraw from the mission without penalty if he so chooses. All in all a fine movie that shows that the old Hollywood greats knew how to make a better war movie than the moderns with all their extra resources and technology.

118046,AAW58LG72PG7I,0790747464,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","When THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO was released in 1944, the war was a long way from being over.  Hollywood knew that the Average Joe was basically still a decent sort, despite the understandable need for a revenge of Pearl Harbor.  Director Mervyn LeRoy had to walk a fine line between an over the top jingoistic paen of American pride and one that dealt with a reasonably accurate and entertaining account of the famed Doolittle raid. LeRoy managed to achieve this delicate balance.  First, he divides TSOT into three parts.  Part one is presented in a semi-documentary style that favors fact over character.  General Doolittle (Spencer Tracy) organizes an attack force of bombers to launch a devastating retaliation against Tokyo.  Van Johnson in the film's protagonist.  He is seen as the Average Joe, one who feels both fear and pressure yet can subsume both in time of peril.  America's other Average Joes could look at him and relate almost on a molecular level.  The training that he and the other pilots undergo is necessarily harsh.  The unfit are weeded out. Again and again, they are reminded of the need for total secrecy.  The wartime saying: ""The slip of a lip can sink a ship"" is still remembered by those of that generation.  Phyllis Thaxter is Johnson's loving wife.  The second part is the thirty seconds of the title.  The actual bombing run, of course took more time, but the special effects of the time aided by some actual footage are both gritty and convincing.  Johnson's ship meets minimal Japanese response, drops its bombs, and heads to China for safety. In Part three, TSOT combines the true story of the survivors with a believable human drama of the return of the crew.  Johnson's plane is shot down and he and several of his comrades are badly wounded. Some local Chinese risk their own lives to protect and heal them.  These Chinese civilians and doctors are presented as kind and noble.  It is difficult not to get a lump in one's throat at several scenes. There are numerous closeups of Chinese, most of whom say not a word, but their resolute faces tell of a world of hurt that is magnified by their Stoic silence.THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO is an unabashed film designed to instil patriotism even as it tells an entertaining tale in a manner that Hollywood has long since forgotten how to tell.",5,A Very Long Thirty Seconds,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,2325,"['When', 'THIRTY', 'SECONDS', 'OVER', 'TOKYO', 'was', 'released', '1944', 'war', 'was', 'long', 'way', 'being', 'over', 'Hollywood', 'knew', 'Average', 'Joe', 'was', 'basically', 'still', 'decent', 'sort', 'understandable', 'need', 'revenge', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Director', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'had', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'top', 'jingoistic', 'paen', 'American', 'pride', 'one', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'entertaining', 'account', 'famed', 'Doolittle', 'raid', 'LeRoy', 'managed', 'achieve', 'delicate', 'balance', 'First', 'TSOT', 'three', 'parts', 'Part', 'one', 'presented', 'semi-documentary', 'style', 'favors', 'fact', 'character', 'General', 'Doolittle', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'attack', 'force', 'bombers', 'launch', 'devastating', 'retaliation', 'Tokyo', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'film', 'protagonist', 'seen', 'Average', 'Joe', 'one', 'who', 'fear', 'pressure', 'yet', 'can', 'subsume', 'time', 'peril', 'America', 'other', 'Average', 'Joes', 'could', 'look', 'relate', 'almost', 'molecular', 'level', 'training', 'other', 'pilots', 'undergo', 'necessarily', 'harsh', 'unfit', 'are', 'weeded', 'out', 'Again', 'again', 'are', 'reminded', 'need', 'total', 'secrecy', 'wartime', 'saying', 'slip', 'lip', 'can', 'sink', 'ship', 'still', 'remembered', 'generation', 'Phyllis', 'Thaxter', 'Johnson', 'loving', 'wife', 'second', 'part', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'title', 'actual', 'bombing', 'run', 'course', 'took', 'more', 'time', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'aided', 'actual', 'footage', 'are', 'gritty', 'convincing', 'Johnson', 'ship', 'meets', 'minimal', 'Japanese', 'response', 'bombs', 'heads', 'China', 'safety', 'Part', 'three', 'TSOT', 'true', 'story', 'survivors', 'believable', 'human', 'drama', 'return', 'crew', 'Johnson', 'plane', 'shot', 'down', 'several', 'comrades', 'are', 'badly', 'wounded', 'local', 'Chinese', 'risk', 'own', 'lives', 'protect', 'heal', 'Chinese', 'civilians', 'doctors', 'are', 'presented', 'kind', 'noble', 'difficult', 'not', 'get', 'lump', 'one', 'throat', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'numerous', 'closeups', 'Chinese', 'most', 'whom', 'say', 'not', 'word', 'resolute', 'tell', 'world', 'hurt', 'magnified', 'Stoic', 'silence.THIRTY', 'SECONDS', 'OVER', 'TOKYO', 'unabashed', 'film', 'designed', 'instil', 'patriotism', 'even', 'entertaining', 'tale', 'manner', 'Hollywood', 'long', 'forgotten', 'how', 'tell']",N/A

As such, I was always interested in books and movies that could help me understand what the war was like in combat and at home.  Indeed, one of the first real books I read was Lawson's ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"".  I must have read that when I was 9 or 10.  I saw the movie for the first time when I was 53.  Personally, the book was better but I appreciated the movie because of its' purpose and its' meaning.What I remembered mostly about the book was the fact that most of the planes crashed in or near China and many of the pilots were captured, killed or wounded.  Ted Lawson seriously injured his leg and I remember reading about how he was moved around to keep the Japanese from capturing him.  I thought it odd that such a successful attack resulted in such a disasterous conclusion.  The movie took me through a lot of the training and preparation that I had forgotten about in the book.  It is tedious yet it shows the seriousness of the mission and the men who planned it.  There are a number of scenes to show the camaraderie of the men and the dedication to the dangerous and unknown mission.  This helped re-enforce the understanding that the people in the war effort, from top to bottom, were capable and focussed.  The everyday, boy next door soldier that we see in the movie reminds the audience that these are heroes but they are also our neighbors, classmates, and relatives.  The love interest served a dual purpose of letting the public know the importance of the support and fidelity of the loved ones at home while branching into a subsequent message of the need to give 150% support and understanding to the returning veteran; especially the disabled vet.  The attack itself was far more important as a moral building tool than a strategic strike for military purposes.  In order to maximize the effect, the movie was made and released in 1944 to an American public still in need of reassurance that the tide was turning.  I reflected on all of this as I watched the movie unfold.  I have no problem with propaganda so long and its' used in a positive manner.  However, I think many of us blush a bit with shame the way the Japanese were portrayed on film during the war.  I remember a scene from ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" in which Japanese soldiers, in stealth, slithered away like snakes after a sneak attack.  By and large, I took the movie ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" as a positive work of wartime propaganda; based on noteworthy true events and molded to uplift the American spirit.I think that it is important to note that these kinds of movies are not often made nowadays.  I don't condemn a man like Michael Moore for making ""Fahrenheit 911"" but I am bothered that people would stretch the truth to make an anti-American statement and then be lionized for it.

The special effects were superb for 1944 or now.  The techinical accuracy is very good.  The correct markings on the B-25s were used.  The infomration in the film is historically correct.  Most films about the ""Doolittle"" or ""Tokyo Raid"" are not technically correct.Spencer Tracy's portrail of Lt. Col. James Doolittle is excellent.  Van Johnson' role as Lt.

118067,A2ZU7RPVGBM1J8,0790747464,Roy M. Raffield,"[1, 1]","This movie is set in the early days of World War II, and it was the first offensive action taken in the wake of the disaster at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. While the Doolittle raid on Japan had only marginal military value, it provded a much needed psychological boost to the American people, and it also prompted Admiral Yamamoto to set into motion his plan to invade the Aleutian Islands and Midway.In order to get a good time line on the above events, there are three movies that will help. The first is ""Destination Tokyo"" starring Cary Grant, and this is about the American submarine that managed to sneak into Tokyo Bay. This action allowed vital information to be passed to the naval task force bringing Doolittle's raiders to the coast of Japan, and a point that helped to confuse the Japanese is the US Navy officer transmitting the information spoke fluent Japanese.The second aspect of this equation is ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" and it outlines the training conducted in preparation for the raid. Actual training of the pilots occurred at Eglin Air Force Base's Auxillary Field 3 (now Duke Field), and here Army Air Force pilots learned how to do a takeoff from an aircraft carrier. During the Vietnam War, pilots also trained here for the Son Tay rescue mission of POWs, and today Duke Field still is used for various types of SOF training.Also, there was a great deal of confusion on the part of the Japanese, and initially they did not realize this had been an air raid. Adding to this mix ""South Pacific"" had just made its debut, and when asked where our aircraft had originated, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used this point to tell reporters the attack had originated from our secret base in Shangra Li.As the third point, there is the movie ""Midway"" starring Henry Fonda and Charlton Heston, and it starts with Admiral Yamamoto being told of Doolittle's raid on Tokyo. This was the impetus for him to set into motion his plan to invade Midway and the Aleutian Islands, and the movie reflects that Admiral Chester Nimitz feared this Japanese reaction to the Doolittle raid. Admiral Nimitz knew the US Navy had been too badly damaged to take on the Japanese in a full scale naval engagement.Roy M.

But it is war, so his circumstances are more intense than they might be in a different time. He is asked to consider a highly secretive project under the command of Lieutenant Doolittle (Spencer Tracy). He accepts and eagerly trains for a mysterious final command.The project is the now-famous Doolittle raid that bombed Japan following the Pearl Harbor attack. It has been shown in many movies, but this one is all the more poinent because it was filmed during the war. Consequently, the sentiments are still strongly in favor of the Americans, but there is a certain charm about that. This movie is a time capsule of an era as much as it is an entertainment piece.If you're a fan of classic Hollywood, you will not be disappointed by the performances in this movie. Johnson is a standout leading man. He can play romantic scenes well and he is a great leader in the wartime scenes. He was the everyman, someone that each audience member could relate to. He plays alongside Tracy whose few scenes are memorable and Robert Walker and Robert Mitchum among others.Funnily enough, there are no scene selections on this DVD.

118085,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,0790747464,"""weirdo_87""","[2, 3]","On April 18 1942, sixteen B-25 Mitchell bombers roared off the deck of the aircraft carrier U.S.S Hornet. Their mission was to drop bombs on military targets in Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, Osaka and Nagoya. The mission was led by Lt. Colonel James H. Doolittle, who had distinguished himself during the pre-war era.When word came out about the ""The Doolittle Raid"", it had an effect on the morale of both sides. The Americans had an electrifying propaganda victory, with headlines around the country saying ""Pearl Harbor Avenged"". The Japanese, on the other hand, were shaken. The empire they thought was invincible had been hit just months after the bombing of Pearl. They hurried their plans for the destruction of the American Pacific fleet, which resulted in their own devastation at Midway in June 1942. When they came home to the states, Doolittle and his men were treated like kings, with Doolittle receiving the Medal of Honor.I admit that the raid wasn't that important tactically. Still, it has captured the imagination of everyone who has heard it, including myself.""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" was based upon a best-selling book by Lieutenant Ted W. Lawson, pilot of the number seven aircraft, nicknamed ""The Ruptured Duck"" because of a mishap that occurred on a practice flight. His story told of the top-secret training that the pilots went through at Eglin Field, the time they spent aboard Hornet enroute to Japan and of the mission and result of. I have not read the book, so I am unsure as to how close it comes to the movie. But the movie is certainly very good, though it lacks some polish that makes it a great movieThe Pros:There is much to recommend about this. I am a big aviation buff, so I got a kick out of the aerial photography in this movie. Among them include scenes of B-25s taking off and landing or in flight over such things as farmland in the central united states, buzzing under the Golden Gate bridge and flying over the patrol boats, country and cities of ""Japan"" (It was most likely just another part of American country). The special effects are very good, used at recreating the bombers or the actual bombing: Those explosions looked very realistic. I also liked the music score, with mixes song like the ""Air Force Hymn"".Van Johnson is very likable as Lawson. But, unlike some films at the time, this one denies him a last minute reprieve from getting his leg amputated. Those who remember Robert Walker's chilling performance as Bruno Anthony in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" will have difficulty recognizing him here as Engineer/Gunner David Thatcher. Maybe it was the voice or the way he acts, but he seemed like such a lightweight. Two other noteworthy roles are Spencer Tracy as Colonel Doolittle, who never appears on screen for more then a minute or so at a time, and Robert Mitchum as Bob Gray, a fellow pilot and good friend of Lawson (He was at his wedding).Some of the scenes I most remember from the movie are simple yet moving or, in some cases, humorous: While out on a practice flight, Lawson reads a letter from his wife announcing she is pregnant, which leads to a rendition of ""Rockabye Baby"" as the plane sways back and forth. There is a moment when Lawson and other airman get lost inside the Hornet trying to look for the deck. After being rescued in China, Lawson and his fellow crew listen to a rendition of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" as sung by some children in their own language. Indeed, with a few exceptions, most of the Chinese characters do speak their own language.I also liked how the men in this movie weren't supermen. They are ordinary men who volunteered and did their best in extraordinary things. They also never face a Japanese solider.The Cons:Most of my criticism comes through two things: The subplot involving Lawson's wife and various propaganda scattered throughout.Lawson's wife is named Ellen Reynolds, I believe, and she's played by Phyllis Thaxter. The inclusion of her character didn't bother me as much as her beliefs. Though she is obviously saddened and bothered by it, she is understanding and committed to allowing Ted to go off on his mission. I also did not like her character's thought that Ted would not love her if she wasn't skinny or did dress up to look pretty. What airman wouldn't want a girl like her?There is some wartime ""cheerleading"" done here: What the wife at home can do (One of Ellen's friends says she'll work in a defense factory to remain occupied). Lawson and Gray have a discussion about the moralities of bombing Japanese civilians, with Gray remarking that he doesn't love them (The Japanese), but he doesn't hate them, and Lawson saying ""If I don't drop a bomb on them, sooner or later, they'll drop one on Ellen"". There's also a discussion that Lawson and a Chinese man, Dr. Chung, have: When asked if he'll be coming back, Lawson says that he may not, but a lot of other guys like him will because ""You're our kind of people"". How could he have known that relations between the U.S and Communist China would grind to a halt after the war?Then again, like I said, I haven't read Lawson's book. Maybe these events were in it, and that these discussions actually took place. That would mean that Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was just being faithful to the book. I guess I'll have to check out for myself.Conclusion:A bit flawed, no doubt, and maybe even aged, like many World War II era films. However, with the exception of ""Pearl Harbor"", it is the only feature length film that tells the story of the Tokyo Raiders.

Filmed during the war in 1943, 'Thirty Seconds over Tokyo' gives the viewer not only the action sequences one expects from the raid on Japan but the stories of the men that flew the mission.  The movie is based on the book by the film's protagonist, Ted Lawson (Van Johnson).  Director Mervyn LeRoy and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo changed little from that first hand account.  The training, bombing run and subsequent escape in China are all as they actually happened.The story also portrays the emotions and sentiment of the period.  Scenes which may seem overly sentimental or dramatic are not Hollywood hype but the real feelings of people caught up in WW2.  The flying scenes of B25s are also authentic as is the interior of the bomber when we are inside the plane.  I would go into a story synopsis but it isn't necessary.
