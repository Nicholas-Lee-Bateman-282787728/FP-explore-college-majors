My husband and I would pay extra for show time during the seasons of soul food just to watch soul food! That is the only reason we would pay extra for cable.. I remember I could not wait to get home to watch soul food with my husband. It was the show to watch!We waited and waited to buy this series because it was sooooooooo expensive... I will say that it was worth the wait and worth the deal that we received. So I am double excited about finally owning this series. We now can watch soul food anytime and as many times as I want!Which is great since there is really nothing good on TV...... now a days.............As far as the series being edited, yes it would be nice if all of the scenes were left as they aired on showtime. I don't understand what the reason was for the editing. The rating on amazon states unrated.For us, we still wanted the series as we wanted to see for ourselves what was edited out. So far we are enjoying the series the way it is, The scenes are as we remember them, we will continue to watch to see what was and was not edited out.We will be watching this, over this holiday season and into and through out the new year.. Just in time for the holidays!We were looking for something to watch for the holidays and every year we usually add a few new DVD's to our collections. This makes a great addition!I don't want to give any spoilers away, all I can say is that we were hooked on this series the first time we watched!And now to the great part of it all. We only paid $8.00 plus tax for the first series and $9.00 plus tax for the second series! What a deal!Happy watching!",5,How could I forget how good this T.V.

I did not subscribe to Showtime when it initially aired and missed the entire season.  I was however, very troubled by the high price of the set.  On every dvd site I've checked, Soul Food's price for a 5 dvd set surpasses other hour long dramas with 6 dvd's (eg The Sopranos, Once &amp; Again, Felicity).  I suspected that the price was set high to DISCOURAGE purchases and in effect justify the non-release of subsequent seasons.Anyway, I bought a used set and am quite satisfied with it but hope that if they release Seasons 2-5, they keep the price in line with other series ($35 for a 5 dvd set is reasonable, $80 IS NOT!!!!!)And to that poster from the lovely, racially enlighted state of KY: you seem to be someone who did not really watch this series and is a caucasian who does not know any African-Americans personally.  It is 2004 - we are doctors, lawyers, professors, investment bankers, business owners - in other words, we are just like you.  So why is it unbelievable to see a family where there is a lawyer, two business owners and a stay-at-home mom venturing out into the workplace?  Would it have been more believable to you if they were all unemployed &amp; on welfare, selling drugs and shooting each other??

I loved the movie, and apart from the fact that there are different stars in this, the storyline is as good and the drama and heart warming moments continue.  Nicole Ari Parker isn't quite as good as Vanessa Williams (the singer - not the actress) was in the movie, but all the other characters are as equally warm.  The music is amazing too.  There is an excellent guest appearance by Gerald Lavert and he's so good.  The soundtrack from the TV series isn't complete and they need to release a second version.

It's a great show, awesome acting and just good to watch anywhere, anytime. On the plane flying home, after a long day of work; it's great to escape into Soul Food DVD's.If you're into drama's I definitely recommend you buy the first season. Within a couple episodes you'll be hooked!It is great to see an African American series written so well with good characters to portray the story line. With most TV shows currently being reality it's a breath of fresh air to see a drama series. And what better way than buying and watching the whole season at your leisure!Highly recommend and will soon be purchasing season two and the movie to complete my collection.Thanks for reading!Cheers!",5,"Soul Food Season One!

That it wasn't publicized more or picked up by a network -- ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox --  suggests that unless black folks are in comedies, most network execs can't be so bothered.  How was this show any less entertaining, dramatic, or sexy than anything one might have seen on Sex and the City or, more recently, Grey's Anatomy? I bet most, if not all of the stars of this show could use a steady gig again. BRING BACK THIS SHOW!! (And, in the meantime, release the rest of the episodes on dvd. What could possibly be taking so long? Hell, they are releasing shows from the 1960s on dvd -- in their entirety.

I got the first season on DVD right away after that. This is a greatly written series, which presents the events in the life of a normal family. The viewer gets to see all kinds of emotions among the different characters, from love to rage, hope to disenchantment, trust to suspicion, etc.Big Mama held the Joseph family together, and when she died they went through a rough patch, events that are shown in the movie that originated the series. Now, the three sisters and their loved ones have to fend off by themselves through this maze called life. Teri (Nicole Ari Parker) is the successful lawyer, who spends most of her time trying to make partner and who is going through a divorce after her husband cheated on her with her own cousin. Bird (Malinda Williams) is having a baby in the first episodes of the series and looks forward to life with her husband Lem, who has supposedly rehabilitated after being in prison for a short period of time. But Lem is having trouble getting a &quot;regular&quot; job, so his options are running out and he may be forced to go back to his previous activities. The third sister, Maxine, is a stay-at-home mom, with three kids, married to Kenny, owner of his own business. Her oldest kid Ahmad, who is entering into adolescence, is one of the central characters of this story. He is the one that brought the family together in the movie, and now he has the role of telling the story and sharing his thoughts with the audience.All of these different characters have their problems and they usually find in their loved ones the support necessary to resolve them. In several episodes we get to see Big Mama again in the recollections of the different characters about how her wisdom and love led them through life. I wish I had the chance to see the following seasons on DVD, but sadly it seems that is not going to happen, so I will probably have to catch these episodes on TV.",5,A heartwarming series,1087689600,"06 20, 2004",2004,2047,"['once', 'while', 'would', 'be', 'channel', 'surfing', 'come', 'Soul', 'Food', 'Showtime', 'once', 'stopped', 'watched', 'episode', 'got', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'right', 'away', 'greatly', 'written', 'series', 'events', 'life', 'normal', 'family', 'viewer', 'see', 'kinds', 'emotions', 'different', 'characters', 'love', 'rage', 'hope', 'disenchantment', 'trust', 'suspicion', 'etc.Big', 'Mama', 'held', 'Joseph', 'family', 'together', 'when', 'died', 'went', 'rough', 'patch', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'movie', 'originated', 'series', 'Now', 'three', 'sisters', 'loved', 'ones', 'have', 'fend', 'off', 'maze', 'called', 'life', 'Teri', 'Nicole', 'Ari', 'Parker', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'make', 'partner', 'who', 'going', 'divorce', 'husband', 'cheated', 'own', 'cousin', 'Bird', 'Malinda', 'Williams', 'having', 'baby', 'first', 'episodes', 'series', 'forward', 'life', 'husband', 'Lem', 'who', 'supposedly', 'rehabilitated', 'being', 'prison', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'Lem', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'quot', 'regular', 'quot', 'job', 'options', 'are', 'running', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'forced', 'go', 'back', 'previous', 'activities', 'third', 'sister', 'Maxine', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'three', 'kids', 'married', 'Kenny', 'owner', 'own', 'business', 'oldest', 'kid', 'Ahmad', 'who', 'entering', 'adolescence', 'one', 'central', 'characters', 'story', 'one', 'brought', 'family', 'together', 'movie', 'now', 'role', 'telling', 'story', 'sharing', 'thoughts', 'audience.All', 'different', 'characters', 'have', 'problems', 'usually', 'find', 'loved', 'ones', 'support', 'necessary', 'resolve', 'several', 'episodes', 'get', 'see', 'Big', 'Mama', 'again', 'recollections', 'different', 'characters', 'how', 'wisdom', 'love', 'led', 'life', 'wish', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'following', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'sadly', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'catch', 'episodes', 'TV']",Soul Food - The Complete First Season
