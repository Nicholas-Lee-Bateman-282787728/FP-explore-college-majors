However, while this was a good set, I think that there were glaring omissions. First off, I loved that they highlighted the 1960-1970s Broncos. Prior to this DVD, I had no idea about this chapter in the history other than the 1978 Super Bowl. It was good to see how it took over 15 years before the Broncos first became competitive. They spent plenty of time on all the coaches and the key players as well.However, while the 1960s-1970s were well covered, I think that they kind of dropped the ball on the 1980s-1990s. They really did not spend too much time on the losing 1980s Super Bowl seasons. They covered ""The Drive"" & ""The Super Bowls"" but other than that, they really did not spend a whole lot of time on them. I would tend to think that there were some important games during those seasons.Secondly, they spent almost no time on the tumultuous relationship between Elway and Dan Reeves and Elway and the fans/media. The Reeves-Elway relationship dominated the late 1980s-early 1990s and led to Reeves being fired in 1992(and replaced by Wade Phillips who they don't even mention and go right to Mike Shanahan). It was even spotlighted on the cover of Sports Illustrated.  Also, it was known that until he won the 2 Super Bowls, Elway had a love-hate relationship with the fans and media. This was not highlighted in the DVD. These events would seem like something that should at least deserve mention since they demonstrated the adversity that Elway, the most important Broncos of all-time, faced throughout his careerLastly, the 1996 & 1998 seasons were really short-changed. The 1996 season saw the Broncos having the best record in football but getting upended by the 2nd year expansion Jacksonville Jaguars in a huge upset in the second round of the NFL playoffs. This upset was perhaps the key motivation for the 1997 Super Bowl season. I remember Elway and Shannon Sharp saying that it was the most painful loss in their careers. Yet it was not even mentioned on this DVD. As far as the 1998 season, they only fast forwarded to the Super Bowl game. They never mentioned that the Broncos had won their first 13 games and there was talk about an undefeated season before they were upset by the New York Giants in Week 15. They also never mention that, throughout the season, John Elway had hinted that this would be his final season and that the team was focused on having him ride off into the sunset as a two-time Super Bowl.I would highly recommend this DVD, especially if you are a Broncos. However, just be aware that with all compilation sets, there are going to be things left out. Just like with a ""Greatest Hits"" CD, there is always going to be one or two songs that should've been included that were not. This set is no different.My Rating: 1960s-1970s (5 stars): 1980s-1990s (3 stars): Whole Set (4 stars)",4,Very Good but a little disappointing,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,2955,"['know', 'Complete', 'History', 'sets', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'complaints', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'However', 'was', 'good', 'set', 'think', 'were', 'glaring', 'omissions', 'First', 'loved', 'highlighted', '1960-1970s', 'Broncos', 'Prior', 'DVD', 'had', 'idea', 'chapter', 'history', 'other', '1978', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'how', 'took', 'over', '15', 'years', 'Broncos', 'first', 'became', 'competitive', 'spent', 'plenty', 'time', 'coaches', 'key', 'players', 'well.However', '1960s-1970s', 'were', 'well', 'covered', 'think', 'kind', 'dropped', 'ball', '1980s-1990s', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'losing', '1980s', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'seasons', 'covered', 'Drive', 'Super', 'Bowls', 'other', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'spend', 'whole', 'lot', 'time', 'would', 'tend', 'think', 'were', 'important', 'games', 'seasons.Secondly', 'spent', 'almost', 'time', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Elway', 'Dan', 'Reeves', 'Elway', 'fans/media', 'Reeves-Elway', 'relationship', 'dominated', 'late', '1980s-early', '1990s', 'led', 'Reeves', 'being', 'fired', '1992', 'replaced', 'Wade', 'Phillips', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'go', 'right', 'Mike', 'Shanahan', 'was', 'even', 'spotlighted', 'cover', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'Also', 'was', 'known', 'won', '2', 'Super', 'Bowls', 'Elway', 'had', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'fans', 'media', 'was', 'not', 'highlighted', 'DVD', 'events', 'would', 'seem', 'something', 'should', 'least', 'deserve', 'mention', 'demonstrated', 'adversity', 'Elway', 'most', 'important', 'Broncos', 'all-time', 'faced', 'careerLastly', '1996', '1998', 'seasons', 'were', 'really', 'short-changed', '1996', 'season', 'saw', 'Broncos', 'having', 'best', 'record', 'football', 'getting', 'upended', '2nd', 'year', 'expansion', 'Jacksonville', 'Jaguars', 'huge', 'upset', 'second', 'round', 'NFL', 'playoffs', 'upset', 'was', 'perhaps', 'key', 'motivation', '1997', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'season', 'remember', 'Elway', 'Shannon', 'Sharp', 'saying', 'was', 'most', 'painful', 'loss', 'careers', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'As', 'far', '1998', 'season', 'only', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'game', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Broncos', 'had', 'won', 'first', '13', 'games', 'was', 'talk', 'undefeated', 'season', 'were', 'upset', 'New', 'York', 'Giants', 'Week', '15', 'also', 'never', 'mention', 'season', 'John', 'Elway', 'had', 'hinted', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'team', 'was', 'focused', 'having', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'two-time', 'Super', 'Bowl.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'especially', 'are', 'Broncos', 'However', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'compilation', 'sets', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'things', 'left', 'out', 'Just', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'CD', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'two', 'songs', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'included', 'were', 'not', 'set', 'different.My', 'Rating', '1960s-1970s', '5', 'stars', '1980s-1990s', '3', 'stars', 'Whole', 'Set', '4', 'stars']",Denver Broncos: The Complete History
