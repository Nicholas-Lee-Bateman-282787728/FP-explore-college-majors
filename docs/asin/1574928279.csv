Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[69, 73]","It's very amazing that this was originally presented as a cable mini-series - as I eventually happened to watch it in its entirety and found it to be, in fact, quite extraordinary!  I never thought, in all these years of watching movies, that such a film could be made from such a classic and intricate collection of stories - Ah - and how it has come to enthrall me!  I truly am undone!Scheherazade (Mili Avital) marries the Sultan Schahriar (Dougray Scott) even though she knows that his mad mind has contrived a plan to execute his new wife the morning after their wedding.  After they are married, she proceeds to spend every wakeful night with him, feeding his imagination with wondrous tales!This is based on the classic work of writing - A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS, by Sir Richard Burton.  It includes ancient tales that had been passed down for hundreds and even thousands of years!  Five of these stories, including the tale of Ali Baba (Rufus Sewell) and Aladdin (Jason Scott Lee) are woven and portrayed upon the screen here in brilliant fashion!  The special effects are far beyond what one would ever expect - even from a big-screen movie.  I am sure, in fact, that this was only made for cable because it is a captivating 4-hours long!The performances herein are as excellent as ever one can come by - Mili Avital and Dougray Scott are both so lovely and possess a wonderful chemistry - And the settings are nothing less than exquisite!

192116,A3Q6KNHE70J4LA,1574928279,Alyn S. Rumbold,"[1, 1]","""Arabian Nights"" is continuing proof that it is possible to put together a highly entertaining, superbly-acted television program with a cast of primarily lesser-known actors and actresses. The performances in the movie are almost uniformly first-rate. For example, John Leguizamo is hilarious and totally believable as Aladdin's genie(s), and far better than Robin Williams' portrayal in Disney's ""Aladdin."" Mili Avital is enchanting as Scheherezade, and Dougray Scott and James Frain are terrific as the warring brothers Schariar and Schazenan (an interesting re-telling of the original base story line). The ever-reliable Rufus Sewell and Alan Bates give very enjoyable portrayals of Ali Baba and the Storyteller, respectively, and Jason Scott Lee gives a very amusing turn as Aladdin. I particularly enjoyed the segment of the constantly fighting Princes of Yemen, Ali, Ahmed, and Hussain (played with gusto by relative unknowns Alexis Conran, James Callis, and Hari Dhillon). While it is the acting that really shines in ""Arabian Nights,"" the set designs and costuming are truly magical. The special effects are also very good considering the budget limitations of the small screen.If you're going to rent or buy this on video/DVD, be careful to find the 175 minute version. I don't know what they cut from the shorter version, but honestly you won't want to miss ANY of this marvelous TV movie.I really hope that Hallmark decides to do a sequel to this with a few more of the tales from the Arabian Nights.

192117,A12KDW2EB3JOLH,1574928279,Amazon Customer,"[176, 177]","As other reviewers have pointed out, the VHS edition of this movie has been hacked to bits and re-edited. There are a few other versions floating around, one is recorded on EP (bad quality) and the other is in a set and rather expensive. I saved the time by buying the DVD instead. The DVD offers a few extras like cast bios and a making of featurette (which is basically just them patting themselves on the back for a lavish production, something we could tell by ourselves) The movie is the star in this case. If you have any sort of access to a DVD player, buy the movie in this format.The tale of Arabian Nights is an ancient one about the beautiful Scheherezade (played by lovely Israeli actress Mili Avital, best known to Americans from Stargate) who tries to cure the mad Sultan Schahriar (Scottish actor Dougray Scott) through her considerable story telling ability. At first, Schahriar is a suspicious, childish man but then as his wife's tales grip him, he begins to see the lessons she is teaching him. So, what starts as a marriage based on convenience and murder becomes a truly deep relationship.Scheherezade's tales are brought to life by a variety of stars in a variety of settings. Some of the &quot;Saturday Morning Cartoon&quot; feel of the stories is removed and many of them return to their roots. The tale of Aladdin, for example, was originally set in China with the bad guy as a sort of African Shaman and that is what is used in this version. Also, the fact that there were two genies is brought to light. (American John Leguizamo is very good in the duel roles as the genies of the lamp and ring) Historical findings are also used (the clay sldiers used in a Chinese tomb to guard the dead are incorporated) And lesser known tales such as the story of Bacbac are used.It is facinating to watch the friendship between Schahriar and Scheherezade develope. He alternately loves her, needs her, hates her and wants to kill her throughout the first half of the movie. And she knows it. Talk about spooky, being in the hands of a homicidal madman who could have her killed at the snap of his fingers. But, self-sacrifice is what make Scheherezade's character so great, she is doing it to save other women, the kingdom but most of all to save Schahriar from himself.The camera work is imaginative and the sets and scenery (much of this was filmed in Turkey) are lavish. The costumes are breathtaking, particularly anything Scheherezade puts on. The his/hers matching armor at the climax was just too cool. The music is always appropriate without being intrusive. The special effects are pretty good (especially for TV), a few are a bit cheesy but I still liked the movie. All the trimmings aside, the cast of international stars is the main reason to watch this film.One more note, I found that I enjoyed this movie more when I watched it at night with the lights out. Maybe Scheherezade was right when she said it was hard to create the right atmosphere with the sun shining.This is the best of the Hallmark mini series that have been on TV lately and I do hope everyone is able to enjoy the complete and unedited version. Find an evening, get some friends, make some tea and I am certain you will be enchanted.",4,Buy the DVD and savour it at night,1010448000,"01 8, 2002",2002,3231,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'VHS', 'edition', 'movie', 'been', 'hacked', 'bits', 're-edited', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'versions', 'floating', 'around', 'one', 'recorded', 'EP', 'bad', 'quality', 'other', 'set', 'rather', 'expensive', 'saved', 'time', 'buying', 'DVD', 'instead', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'cast', 'bios', 'making', 'featurette', 'basically', 'just', 'patting', 'back', 'lavish', 'production', 'something', 'could', 'tell', 'movie', 'star', 'case', 'have', 'sort', 'access', 'DVD', 'player', 'buy', 'movie', 'format.The', 'tale', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'ancient', 'one', 'beautiful', 'Scheherezade', 'played', 'lovely', 'Israeli', 'actress', 'Mili', 'Avital', 'best', 'known', 'Americans', 'Stargate', 'who', 'cure', 'mad', 'Sultan', 'Schahriar', 'Scottish', 'actor', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'considerable', 'story', 'telling', 'ability', 'first', 'Schahriar', 'suspicious', 'childish', 'man', 'then', 'wife', 'tales', 'grip', 'see', 'lessons', 'teaching', 'So', 'what', 'marriage', 'based', 'convenience', 'murder', 'truly', 'deep', 'relationship.Scheherezade', 'tales', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'variety', 'stars', 'variety', 'settings', 'quot', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'Cartoon', 'quot', 'feel', 'stories', 'removed', 'many', 'return', 'roots', 'tale', 'Aladdin', 'example', 'was', 'originally', 'set', 'China', 'bad', 'guy', 'sort', 'African', 'Shaman', 'what', 'used', 'version', 'Also', 'fact', 'were', 'two', 'genies', 'brought', 'light', 'American', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'very', 'good', 'duel', 'genies', 'lamp', 'ring', 'Historical', 'findings', 'are', 'also', 'used', 'clay', 'sldiers', 'used', 'Chinese', 'tomb', 'guard', 'dead', 'are', 'incorporated', 'lesser', 'known', 'tales', 'such', 'story', 'Bacbac', 'are', 'used.It', 'facinating', 'watch', 'friendship', 'Schahriar', 'Scheherezade', 'develope', 'alternately', 'kill', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Talk', 'spooky', 'being', 'hands', 'homicidal', 'madman', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'snap', 'fingers', 'self-sacrifice', 'what', 'make', 'Scheherezade', 'character', 'so', 'great', 'doing', 'save', 'other', 'women', 'kingdom', 'most', 'save', 'Schahriar', 'himself.The', 'camera', 'work', 'imaginative', 'sets', 'scenery', 'much', 'was', 'filmed', 'Turkey', 'are', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'particularly', 'anything', 'Scheherezade', 'his/hers', 'matching', 'armor', 'climax', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'cool', 'music', 'always', 'appropriate', 'being', 'intrusive', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'TV', 'few', 'are', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'still', 'liked', 'movie', 'trimmings', 'aside', 'cast', 'international', 'stars', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'film.One', 'more', 'note', 'found', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'when', 'watched', 'night', 'lights', 'out', 'Maybe', 'Scheherezade', 'was', 'right', 'when', 'said', 'was', 'hard', 'create', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'sun', 'shining.This', 'best', 'Hallmark', 'mini', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'lately', 'do', 'hope', 'everyone', 'able', 'enjoy', 'complete', 'unedited', 'version', 'evening', 'get', 'friends', 'make', 'tea', 'am', 'certain', 'will', 'be', 'enchanted']",N/A

192119,A13NM1PES9OXVN,1574928279,"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell""","[19, 19]","Just as Sheherazade would like it, &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; is a tale well told.  It's a movie filled with color, humor, romance, and fascinating  characters -- in short, it's everything those other awful recent  &quot;magical&quot; miniseries wish they would've been (only to fail  miserably).  After suffering through the overcooked disappointments of  &quot;Merlin&quot; or this year's &quot;10th Kingdom,&quot; I wasn't  looking forward to &quot;Arabian Nights.&quot;But I watched, and was  glad I did.  &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; is that rare TV attempt that does  justice to the original book it's based on (1001 Nights).  The miniseries  is told in a tight two nights (175 minutes total on DVD), and is an example  of a production in which everything was done right.  The DVD itself not  only boasts a beautifully rendered and uncut version of the film, it also  offers an enjoyable look behind the scenes, plus the standard bios and  production notes -- as well as some unusually beautiful interactive menus  featuring a hint of magic in each one.The special effects for  &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; are beautifully done, and without the overkill  usually associated with this kind of TV fare.  There's also a poetry  missing from most TV family entertainment -- a beautiful score, and a  thoughtfully written script (by Peter Barnes).  The actors also rise to the  challenge:  From the graceful Mili Avital, who makes a lovely and spirited  Sheherazade, to Dougray Scott's complex, tormented, and surprisingly  sympathetic Sultan, and delightful guest appearances from the likes of  Jason Scott Lee, Rufus Sewell, Alan Bates, and many more -- Arabian Nights  is one of those rare gems whose substance more than matches its  style.&quot;In telling a story, get to the end -- then stop,&quot; says  the wise old storyteller to beautiful Sheherazade.  Truer words were never  spoken -- Arabian Nights does indeed tell a wonderful, exciting, humorous,  and even romantic story that moves with the speed of a thousand genies --  and then stops, in just the right place.

In order to draw him out of his paranoia that everyone is conspiring against him she tells him tales from the Arabian Nights. At first he is ready to kill her after their wedding. She must make her stories hook him so that he will delay her death till the next night so that she may finish her tale. Like the Odyssey when the tapestry is unwoven to extend the time before an unwanted marriage, the audience is drawn in to see what happens next. All the stories are well done and include favorites like Ali Baba and Aladdin. The tales are well done with a good cast, decent special effects, and excellent directing and editing.

The ever-reliable Rufus Sewell and Alan Bates give very enjoyable portrayals of Ali Baba and the Storyteller, respectively, and Jason Scott Lee gives a very amusing turn as Aladdin.

Truth to be told, I enjoyed this dvd enormously, and I think many of you will like it too.For those who haven't read any of the versions of ""A thousand and one nights"" yet, the plot is simple but the resulting story that the spectator can enjoy is great. A Sultan (Dougray Scott) discovers that his wife betrays him with his brother, and kills her. Hurt and almost mad, the Sultan says that he will wed again but declares that he will marry a new bride everyday, killing her the next morning so she won't betray him too. His first chosen bride is the daughter of his main advisor, Scheherazade (Mili Avital), a woman who loves him and that will try to keep herself and the other women in the palace alive, as well as make the Sultan fall in love with her. In order to do so, Scheherazade begins to tell him a story during their first night together, engaging the Sultan so much in it that the next day he postpones her execution.And that continues for a long time, every night and with different and enchanting stories, that the director (Steve Barron) somehow manages to show to the spectator, mixed almost seamlessly with the main story. Among other tales, you will be treated to wonderful versions of ""Ali Baba and the forty thieves"" and ""Aladdin and the magic lamp"".Of course, you will wonder how this story finishes, and what happens with the Sultan and Scheherazade. But for that, unfortunately (or fortunately?), you will have to watch this movie, or buy a good version of ""A thousand and one nights"". In my opinion, doing those two things one after the other would be an excellent idea.

192155,A179GX8E3M4G52,1574928279,"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[9, 9]","Until recent times, in this age of terrorists, the Western world's most memorable impression of the Middle East came through Scheherazade and her wonderful tales of ""The Thousand and One Arabian Nights."" That's why it was a pleasure to leave behind the suicide bombings, beheadings and snarling hatred, to revisit this magical world of romance and intrigue; even if only for one night.Most of us are familiar with the best-known tales of the Arabian Nights, `Aladdin and the Magic Lamp' and `Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves' but as the story goes, there were more, a lot more.PlotEmmy award winning, Arabian Nights, is a shortened interpretation of the saga of Scheherazade, an Arab Queen who delayed her scheduled execution by weaving a web of incredible tales for a thousand and one nights. Each night she would tell her enchanting tale, making sure to leave the story unfinished at dawn forcing the king to stay her execution on a daily basis, until finally, he was hopelessly in love with her, and deferred her execution permanently.The StoryThe Sultan Schariar (Dougray Scott) was driven paranoid by his wife's infidelity and collusion in his assassination attempt by his brother Shazanon. (James Frain) - an attack, in which the Sultaness was killed. Needing to take a wife to keep his throne from his brother, and no longer able to trust the women close to him, the Sultan concocts a bizarre plan in which he will execute his bride the morning after their wedding.Knowing full well, that it is Sultan Schariar's (Dougray Scott) intention to have her executed the morning after their marriage, Scheherazade, (Mili Avital) the Grand Vizar's daughter and childhood friend of the young prince, volunteers to marry the Sultan in an effort to bring him back to his senses while saving other women of the harem from a similar fate.On the wedding night, Scheherazade begins telling the Sultan a story, which extends far into the night. It is the story of `Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.' By daybreak, the scheduled time of execution, she is at a crossroads in the tale and the frustrated king suspends the execution for a day. So goes the pattern Scheherazade initiated, deftly weaving the fabric of an enthralling story, yet not finishing each night and getting a morning reprieve. This goes on for a thousand nights, until the Sultan not only trusts her but loves her as well.Arabian Nights was a made for TV movie which aired on Hallmark Theater early in 2000. This condensed version shows only five of the hundreds of tales that Scheherazade ostensibly spins for the Sultan. In a twist, the show tries to portray how these tales later helped the Sultan turn back an attack sponsored by his treacherous brother. For me, this seemed rather forced as the tales only mildly fit the scenario in which they were placed.Not unexpected, the film takes liberties by varying from both history, being Persian rather than Arab, and the actual story, wherein Scheherazade had a little sister and portraying Scherazade as the first wife chosen, rather than the last of a bloody trail of previously executed women.As a whole, the show was most enjoyable. Almost but not quite five stars. The acting, especially by Mili Avital was very good, the story flowed well and despite it's extensive length of almost three hours, never loses the viewer's interest.This is a family movie, suitable for all but the youngest (under six) of children.",4,A fun film for the entire family,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,3424,"['recent', 'times', 'age', 'terrorists', 'Western', 'world', 'most', 'memorable', 'impression', 'Middle', 'East', 'came', 'Scheherazade', 'wonderful', 'tales', 'Thousand', 'One', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'why', 'was', 'pleasure', 'leave', 'suicide', 'bombings', 'beheadings', 'snarling', 'hatred', 'revisit', 'magical', 'world', 'romance', 'intrigue', 'even', 'only', 'one', 'night.Most', 'are', 'familiar', 'best-known', 'tales', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'Aladdin', 'Magic', 'Lamp', 'Ali', 'Baba', 'Forty', 'Thieves', 'story', 'were', 'more', 'lot', 'more.PlotEmmy', 'award', 'winning', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'shortened', 'interpretation', 'saga', 'Scheherazade', 'Arab', 'Queen', 'who', 'delayed', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'weaving', 'web', 'incredible', 'tales', 'thousand', 'one', 'nights', 'night', 'would', 'tell', 'enchanting', 'tale', 'making', 'sure', 'leave', 'story', 'unfinished', 'dawn', 'forcing', 'king', 'stay', 'execution', 'daily', 'basis', 'finally', 'was', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'deferred', 'execution', 'permanently.The', 'StoryThe', 'Sultan', 'Schariar', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'was', 'driven', 'paranoid', 'wife', 'infidelity', 'collusion', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'brother', 'Shazanon', 'James', 'Frain', 'attack', 'Sultaness', 'was', 'killed', 'Needing', 'take', 'wife', 'keep', 'throne', 'brother', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'trust', 'women', 'close', 'Sultan', 'bizarre', 'plan', 'will', 'execute', 'bride', 'morning', 'wedding.Knowing', 'full', 'well', 'Sultan', 'Schariar', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'intention', 'have', 'executed', 'morning', 'marriage', 'Scheherazade', 'Mili', 'Avital', 'Grand', 'Vizar', 'daughter', 'childhood', 'friend', 'young', 'prince', 'volunteers', 'marry', 'Sultan', 'effort', 'bring', 'back', 'senses', 'saving', 'other', 'women', 'harem', 'similar', 'fate.On', 'wedding', 'night', 'Scheherazade', 'telling', 'Sultan', 'story', 'far', 'night', 'story', 'Ali', 'Baba', 'Forty', 'Thieves', 'daybreak', 'scheduled', 'time', 'execution', 'crossroads', 'tale', 'frustrated', 'king', 'execution', 'day', 'So', 'pattern', 'Scheherazade', 'initiated', 'deftly', 'weaving', 'fabric', 'enthralling', 'story', 'yet', 'not', 'finishing', 'night', 'getting', 'morning', 'reprieve', 'thousand', 'nights', 'Sultan', 'not', 'only', 'well.Arabian', 'Nights', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'aired', 'Hallmark', 'Theater', 'early', '2000', 'condensed', 'version', 'only', 'five', 'hundreds', 'tales', 'Scheherazade', 'ostensibly', 'Sultan', 'twist', 'show', 'portray', 'how', 'tales', 'later', 'helped', 'Sultan', 'turn', 'back', 'attack', 'sponsored', 'treacherous', 'brother', 'seemed', 'rather', 'forced', 'tales', 'only', 'mildly', 'fit', 'scenario', 'were', 'placed.Not', 'unexpected', 'film', 'liberties', 'varying', 'history', 'being', 'Persian', 'rather', 'Arab', 'actual', 'story', 'wherein', 'Scheherazade', 'had', 'little', 'sister', 'portraying', 'Scherazade', 'first', 'wife', 'chosen', 'rather', 'last', 'bloody', 'trail', 'previously', 'executed', 'women.As', 'whole', 'show', 'was', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'Almost', 'not', 'quite', 'five', 'stars', 'acting', 'especially', 'Mili', 'Avital', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'flowed', 'well', 'extensive', 'length', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'never', 'viewer', 'interest.This', 'family', 'movie', 'suitable', 'youngest', 'six', 'children']",N/A
192156,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,1574928279,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 0]","This retelling of the classic story of 1001 Arabian Nights (abridged somewhat to just a few nights...) works surprisingly well.  A mini series edited to form one movie, it may be a little too long to take in one sitting, but this is one of those rare things - a movie that adults will enjoy, but the kids will too.The story is in fact several stories, as told by Scheherazade to her new husband, the Sultan, in a framing story.  The framing story is a rare thing - a device to hold several stories together, which works as well as the individual tales.  The Sultan is on the brink of madness as a result of his late wives betrayal.  He now has developed a pattern of marrying and then killing the bride in the morning... a pattern Scheherazade intends to break by engrossing him in her tales enough to keep him wanting to hear the end the next night.  As she tells her tales, she aims to help his madness subside and impart wisdom to help him confront the reasons for his torment.And so we get the classic stories of Ali Baba, Aladdin, and a couple more that might be less familiar but are no less compelling, with a surprisingly diverse and well known cast including Alan Bates, Jason Scott Lee, Vanessa Mae, Dougray Scott, Andy Serkis and others.Scenery and sets all appear surprisingly authentic and detailed, the big budget (for TV) is evident in the terrific effects (genies, magic carpets etc..) and of course the timeless stories work well.There are a couple of gripes - the sound is in stereo only, and the dubbing is much worse than we should expect from a big budget production these days.  Also, while the overall tone works well, the slapstick in places might be a little too much for adults, and the occasional gruesome death may unnerve younger viewers.A short featurette outlining the undeniable scale of the production completes a package which is a success, provided your expectations are simply for some light entertainment, and nothing more substantial.",4,Family friendly fantasy,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1972,"['retelling', 'classic', 'story', '1001', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'abridged', 'somewhat', 'just', 'few', 'nights', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'mini', 'series', 'edited', 'form', 'one', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'take', 'one', 'sitting', 'one', 'rare', 'things', 'movie', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'kids', 'will', 'too.The', 'story', 'fact', 'several', 'stories', 'told', 'Scheherazade', 'new', 'husband', 'Sultan', 'framing', 'story', 'framing', 'story', 'rare', 'thing', 'device', 'hold', 'several', 'stories', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'individual', 'tales', 'Sultan', 'brink', 'madness', 'result', 'late', 'wives', 'betrayal', 'now', 'developed', 'pattern', 'marrying', 'then', 'killing', 'bride', 'morning', 'pattern', 'Scheherazade', 'break', 'engrossing', 'tales', 'enough', 'keep', 'wanting', 'hear', 'end', 'next', 'night', 'tales', 'help', 'madness', 'subside', 'impart', 'wisdom', 'help', 'confront', 'reasons', 'torment.And', 'get', 'classic', 'stories', 'Ali', 'Baba', 'Aladdin', 'couple', 'more', 'might', 'be', 'less', 'familiar', 'are', 'less', 'compelling', 'surprisingly', 'diverse', 'well', 'known', 'cast', 'including', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'Vanessa', 'Mae', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'others.Scenery', 'sets', 'appear', 'surprisingly', 'authentic', 'detailed', 'big', 'budget', 'TV', 'evident', 'terrific', 'effects', 'genies', 'magic', 'carpets', 'etc..', 'course', 'timeless', 'stories', 'work', 'well.There', 'are', 'couple', 'gripes', 'sound', 'stereo', 'only', 'dubbing', 'much', 'worse', 'should', 'expect', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'days', 'Also', 'overall', 'tone', 'well', 'slapstick', 'places', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'adults', 'occasional', 'gruesome', 'death', 'may', 'unnerve', 'younger', 'viewers.A', 'short', 'featurette', 'outlining', 'undeniable', 'scale', 'production', 'package', 'success', 'provided', 'expectations', 'are', 'simply', 'light', 'entertainment', 'nothing', 'more', 'substantial']",N/A

All cater to the family crowd of some action but no blood, romance but no sex, and high drama but no swearing.  But not all are worth the money to buy them or the time to watch them.  Lately, Hallmark has been rehashing stories already made (i.e. Swiss Family Robinson, Moby Dick), making sequels that should not have been made (Merlin's Apprentice), or remaking previous Hallmark movies (The 10 Commandments).  This is an exception; it is original in that no other major Western movie company has produced a movie version of this famed set of stories.  Set in the Middle East pre-Crusades, the story focuses on relationship between the Sultan and his childhood love and recent wife, Scheherazade.  She prolongs her life, diminishes his anger, and strengthens their marriage by telling him stories, one per night, for a year.  The movie is her stories, and they are wonderfully done.  The settings are beautiful, the costume design looks authentic, the stories are well played out with good doses of comedy, suspense, adventure, and romance.  The only drawback is that too many of the actors / actresses are clearly not of Middle Eastern origin.  The sultan is a good example; the actor, Dougray Scott, is Scottish and speaks with a clear European accent.

Fisher ""Ravenya""","[5, 8]","Arabian Nights is the story of Sultan Schariar (Dougray Scott) who unfortunatly married an unfaithful wife who was conducting an affair with his brother Schahzenan. The two of them had plotted Schariar's death so that Schahzenan could take over the kingdom and upon discovering this, the Sultan hurled a sword at his brother which instead killed his wife. The guards were called in, but Schariar had forever lost his faith in love, in his brother, in trust, and most of all - in women.When the time came for him to wed again he was very reluctant to go ahead with it in case history repeated itself, so he formed his own plan with the royal executioner - after the wedding night he would have his new wife killed. When the women in the harem hear of this, they fear greatly for their own lives and turn to the wise Scheherezade (the beautiful Mili Avital) the Visier's only child, who spends most of her days in the village, listening in wonder at the stories that the Storyteller (Alan Bates) tells to the crowds. When Scheherezade hears of their plight, she offers herself up as a bride for the Sultan, certain that she can help save her childhood love from his madness.But the Sultan is very far gone, and is a selfish, paranoid man who harbors no guilty feelings over having her killed the next morning. And so Scheherezade begins to tell him stories - an adventure (Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves), a comedy (the story of BacBac the hunchback), a romance (Aladdin) and a tragedy (the story of a drunk that wakes up in the Sultan's bed), leaving each one at the climax till the following night so that Schariar must spare her life if he is to learn what happens next. Slowly he begins to find himself again. But at the same time Schahzenan is gathering forces at the edge of the kingdom to overthrow his brother. Confused and afraid, the Sultan tries to heed Scheherezade's advice: ""Stories can save us, if we use our imagination.""Arabian Nights is a very atmospheric movie, full of the magic of eastern lands, customs and costumes. The combined efforts of Mili Avital, Jason Scott Lee as Aladdin and John Leguizamo in the duo role as both the genie of the lamp and the genie of the ring make this a very watchable movie.There are some faults however - any attempt at humour or jokes doesn't quite work, sometimes it drags on a bit, and a few of the special effects don't look very real, but the story itself is very touching - the rather strange plot (which is basically Scheherezade telling the Sultan lots of stories) works wonderfully as she draws inspiration from things around her; and the blending from the 'real world' into her stories is perfect. Morals are drawn mostly from Scheherezade, as she is rewarded for her unfailing love for Schariar, and her teachings in the power of stories is a good lesson to be learnt in the days of technology.",3,The Power of Stories,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,2857,"['Arabian', 'Nights', 'story', 'Sultan', 'Schariar', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'who', 'unfortunatly', 'married', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'conducting', 'affair', 'brother', 'Schahzenan', 'two', 'had', 'plotted', 'Schariar', 'death', 'Schahzenan', 'could', 'take', 'over', 'kingdom', 'discovering', 'Sultan', 'hurled', 'sword', 'brother', 'instead', 'killed', 'wife', 'guards', 'were', 'called', 'Schariar', 'had', 'forever', 'lost', 'faith', 'love', 'brother', 'trust', 'most', 'time', 'came', 'wed', 'again', 'was', 'very', 'reluctant', 'go', 'ahead', 'case', 'history', 'repeated', 'so', 'formed', 'own', 'plan', 'royal', 'executioner', 'wedding', 'night', 'would', 'have', 'new', 'wife', 'killed', 'When', 'women', 'harem', 'hear', 'fear', 'greatly', 'own', 'lives', 'turn', 'wise', 'Scheherezade', 'beautiful', 'Mili', 'Avital', 'Visier', 'only', 'child', 'who', 'most', 'days', 'village', 'listening', 'wonder', 'stories', 'Storyteller', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'crowds', 'When', 'Scheherezade', 'hears', 'plight', 'up', 'bride', 'Sultan', 'certain', 'can', 'help', 'save', 'childhood', 'love', 'madness.But', 'Sultan', 'very', 'far', 'gone', 'selfish', 'paranoid', 'man', 'who', 'guilty', 'feelings', 'having', 'killed', 'next', 'morning', 'so', 'Scheherezade', 'begins', 'tell', 'stories', 'adventure', 'Ali', 'Baba', 'Forty', 'Thieves', 'comedy', 'story', 'BacBac', 'hunchback', 'romance', 'Aladdin', 'tragedy', 'story', 'drunk', 'up', 'Sultan', 'bed', 'leaving', 'one', 'climax', 'following', 'night', 'so', 'Schariar', 'must', 'spare', 'life', 'learn', 'what', 'next', 'Slowly', 'find', 'again', 'same', 'time', 'Schahzenan', 'gathering', 'forces', 'edge', 'kingdom', 'overthrow', 'brother', 'Confused', 'afraid', 'Sultan', 'tries', 'heed', 'Scheherezade', 'advice', 'Stories', 'can', 'save', 'use', 'imagination', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'movie', 'full', 'magic', 'eastern', 'lands', 'customs', 'costumes', 'combined', 'efforts', 'Mili', 'Avital', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'Aladdin', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'duo', 'role', 'genie', 'lamp', 'genie', 'ring', 'make', 'very', 'watchable', 'movie.There', 'are', 'faults', 'however', 'attempt', 'humour', 'jokes', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'bit', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'very', 'real', 'story', 'very', 'touching', 'rather', 'strange', 'plot', 'basically', 'Scheherezade', 'telling', 'Sultan', 'lots', 'stories', 'wonderfully', 'inspiration', 'things', 'blending', ""'real"", 'world', 'stories', 'perfect', 'Morals', 'are', 'drawn', 'mostly', 'Scheherezade', 'rewarded', 'unfailing', 'love', 'Schariar', 'teachings', 'power', 'stories', 'good', 'lesson', 'be', 'learnt', 'days', 'technology']",N/A
192163,A3UBWCLVJ6WN2V,1574928279,"""saintbsm""","[9, 9]","Arabian Nights is a spectacularly lavish fantasy!Based on the 1001 Arabian Nights that Schiharazade told the sultan every night to keep him in suspense and keep him from executing her! The story is marveously played out. It does not suffer the burden of being a TV movie and lacking the budget and grand scope of a movie but instead acts takes advantage of the fact that it is a TV show! Originally on television the story was divided into two separate two-hour parts, told different nights. But on DVD it plays just as a movie would, with lavish, larger-than-life sets that needed to be just right for the movie to succeed. And succeed the movie does, marvelously in fact.Telling 5 main stories in addition to the main story that's being played out. The stories are, in order: Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (An expertly told adaption of the classic arabian tale with fine acting and even a twist ending that will please everyone), The Sultan's Jester (An amusing story that I had not heard before about a court jester who accidentally chokes on a fishbone and dies, the people who he was dining with, thinking that they had killed the Sultan's beloved jester,  leave the body at the door of a doctor who also believing he'd killed the jester, brings him to another person's house and so on, all and all an amusing, well told tale), Aladdin and the Magic Lamp (The longest, biggest and most lavishly told of the 5 tales, Aladdin recounts the tale we all know, but a seemingly different, more authentic, and interesting version. Look for John Leguizemo of Moulin Rouge, and Collateral Damage as the genie), Never Tell the Same Joke Twice (A very interesting and seemingly new tale that ties the two main characters in the real story into this story. A tale that has the sultan playing jokes on one of his particular citizens by having him go from a drunk to waking up as the Sultan and then back and forth. All and all very amusing and even funny), The last story, surely one of the best, is a magical tale that tells the story of three brothers who go out on a quest to find the greatest gift on earth. A tale of love, hope, and brotherhood. Spectacular), abrubtly after this story ends we are thrust into a battle between the sultan and his evil twisted brother bent on revenge.

192164,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,1574928279,S.E. Poza,"[1, 1]","At its  heart, Arabian Nights is about the importance of story-telling and how to tell stories well. A variety of exotic tales are told, each with a lesson to be learned. The glue that holds this anthology of morality tales together is Scheherazade. She has married a sultan who has been driven mad by his wife's betrayal. He now feels he can trust no woman and must kill his wife after their wedding night. In order to survive, she tells a story each night and leaves her husband wanting more.Each story is well done using a different location and cultural background. The actors are all quite competent in their roles and the special effects are good. About the only thing I didn't care for was the occasional reference to modern concepts or humor based on modern notions that seemed out of place (especially by John Leguizamo's genies). This sort of thing only appeared in one segment though so it wasn't too great an issue.The special features are rather limited and I really would have liked to have heard about the history of the tales and the culture(s) they were derived from much more than about the lavishness of the production. While everyone involved has every right to be proud of how well done this miniseries was, I think that the stories themselves are more provocative than the movie making process.",4,Well constructed anthology of morality tales,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,1316,"['heart', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'importance', 'story-telling', 'how', 'tell', 'stories', 'well', 'variety', 'exotic', 'tales', 'are', 'told', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'glue', 'anthology', 'morality', 'tales', 'together', 'Scheherazade', 'married', 'sultan', 'who', 'been', 'driven', 'mad', 'wife', 'betrayal', 'now', 'can', 'trust', 'woman', 'must', 'kill', 'wife', 'wedding', 'night', 'order', 'survive', 'story', 'night', 'husband', 'wanting', 'more.Each', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'using', 'different', 'location', 'cultural', 'background', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'competent', 'roles', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'occasional', 'reference', 'modern', 'concepts', 'humor', 'based', 'modern', 'notions', 'seemed', 'place', 'especially', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'genies', 'sort', 'thing', 'only', 'appeared', 'one', 'segment', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'great', 'issue.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'rather', 'limited', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'history', 'tales', 'culture', 's', 'were', 'derived', 'much', 'more', 'lavishness', 'production', 'everyone', 'involved', 'right', 'be', 'proud', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'miniseries', 'was', 'think', 'stories', 'are', 'more', 'provocative', 'movie', 'making', 'process']",N/A

192166,AOE0XMITAJWDT,1574928279,Terry Sunday,"[5, 5]","""Arabian Nights"" tells the timeless tale of Scheherazade and the imaginary stories with which she enthralled her husband, the Sultan Schahriar, in order to save her life, over the span of ""a thousand and one Arabian nights."" This lavish and visually stunning production brims with fantastic images, fabulous sets and costumes, compelling characterizations, interesting stories and exotic locations. An updated version of five of the classic 2,500-year-old fantasies popularized in the 1800s by Sir Richard Burton, it features such memorable figures as Aladdin, Ali Baba and the genie of the lamp. It is sure to captivate viewers young and old.I found it especially enjoyable because it was filmed entirely on location in Morocco and Turkey. Having vacationed in both of these countries, I recognized some of the locations, such as the leather tanneries in Fez, Morocco, and the other-worldly rock formations in Cappadocia near Goreme, Turkey. The sets and buildings overflow with the exquisite detailing common to Islamic architecture. It is a treat to the eye to take in all of the rich, delicate decorations in each scene and realize that, in many cases, these are real places, not simply movie sets.You can easily view the main feature, running just less than three hours, in a single sitting. But more likely you'll split it up over several days, and the 40 convenient chapter stops nicely divide it up into bite-sized segments. The special features include a fairly typical 13-minute ""making of"" documentary, cast and crew biographies and production notes.There were just a few areas that I found less than fully satisfying with ""Arabian Nights,"" but none of them detracted from my enjoyment of the story. First, the sound volume and clarity tended to fluctuate, and sometimes it was hard to understand the dialogue (this is a common problem with many DVDs). Second, the computer graphics, while quite good overall, were not up to the latest standards set by the likes of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""King Kong."" For instance, the ""dragons"" guarding a cave full of treasures discovered by Ali Baba were not particularly well-rendered, and the digital ""smoke"" that appears in many scenes was too obviously CGI. Finally, there were a few deliberate ""modernisms"" in speech or actions, or subtle pop-culture references to modern times. At first this was a little jarring, but I soon accepted it in the spirit with which it was probably intended. Think ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" and you'll understand what I mean.This is a great DVD for the whole family to enjoy. I heartily recommend ""Arabian Nights"" to anyone interested in spending a few pleasant hours in a magical world of sibling rivalry, palace intrigue, genies and flying carpets.",4,A Classic Tale Well Told,1161216000,"10 19, 2006",2006,2733,"['Arabian', 'Nights', 'timeless', 'tale', 'Scheherazade', 'imaginary', 'stories', 'enthralled', 'husband', 'Sultan', 'Schahriar', 'order', 'save', 'life', 'span', 'thousand', 'one', 'Arabian', 'nights', 'lavish', 'visually', 'stunning', 'production', 'brims', 'fantastic', 'images', 'fabulous', 'sets', 'costumes', 'compelling', 'characterizations', 'interesting', 'stories', 'exotic', 'locations', 'updated', 'version', 'five', 'classic', '2,500-year-old', 'fantasies', 'popularized', '1800s', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'such', 'memorable', 'figures', 'Aladdin', 'Ali', 'Baba', 'genie', 'lamp', 'sure', 'captivate', 'viewers', 'young', 'old.I', 'found', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'location', 'Morocco', 'Turkey', 'Having', 'vacationed', 'countries', 'recognized', 'locations', 'such', 'leather', 'tanneries', 'Fez', 'Morocco', 'other-worldly', 'rock', 'formations', 'Cappadocia', 'Goreme', 'Turkey', 'sets', 'buildings', 'exquisite', 'detailing', 'common', 'Islamic', 'architecture', 'treat', 'eye', 'take', 'rich', 'delicate', 'decorations', 'scene', 'realize', 'many', 'cases', 'are', 'real', 'places', 'not', 'simply', 'movie', 'sets.You', 'can', 'easily', 'view', 'main', 'feature', 'running', 'just', 'less', 'three', 'hours', 'single', 'sitting', 'more', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'split', 'up', 'several', 'days', '40', 'convenient', 'chapter', 'nicely', 'divide', 'up', 'bite-sized', 'segments', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'fairly', 'typical', '13-minute', 'making', 'documentary', 'cast', 'crew', 'biographies', 'production', 'notes.There', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'areas', 'found', 'less', 'fully', 'satisfying', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'none', 'detracted', 'enjoyment', 'story', 'First', 'sound', 'volume', 'clarity', 'tended', 'fluctuate', 'sometimes', 'was', 'hard', 'understand', 'dialogue', 'common', 'problem', 'many', 'DVDs', 'Second', 'computer', 'graphics', 'quite', 'good', 'overall', 'were', 'not', 'up', 'latest', 'standards', 'set', 'likes', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'King', 'Kong', 'instance', 'dragons', 'guarding', 'cave', 'full', 'treasures', 'discovered', 'Ali', 'Baba', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'well-rendered', 'digital', 'smoke', 'many', 'scenes', 'was', 'too', 'obviously', 'CGI', 'Finally', 'were', 'few', 'deliberate', 'modernisms', 'speech', 'actions', 'subtle', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'modern', 'times', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'jarring', 'soon', 'accepted', 'spirit', 'was', 'probably', 'intended', 'Think', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'mean.This', 'great', 'DVD', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'anyone', 'interested', 'spending', 'few', 'pleasant', 'hours', 'magical', 'world', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'palace', 'intrigue', 'genies', 'flying', 'carpets']",N/A
