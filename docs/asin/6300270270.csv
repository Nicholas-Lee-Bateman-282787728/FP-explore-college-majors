236262,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300270270,Acute Observer,"[0, 3]","The Bad Seed, 1956 filmThis story begins at a large mansion. The talk introduces the people. Little Rhoda seems perfect in her behavior. But she seems mature for her age. [You see a horse-drawn wagon in the background.] Their talk is about psychology. One woman met Freud! They talk about a nurse who killed nine patients. Does speaking the first word that pops into your mind have any practical use? Does believing you were adopted have any significance? The talk continues about murders. [No mention of politics and economics?] The radio tells of the death of a young student at that school! Will this affect the other students? &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel anyway at all.&#8221; Was she naughty? Leroy empties wastepaper baskets. Is Rhoda sorry? No. Her mother reads to Rhoda at bedtime. Claude&#8217;s death causes turmoil. Where was his Penmanship Medal?Rhoda was the last to see Claude alive. Does she know anything? Miss Fern doesn&#8217;t want Rhoda back next year; she is not a good sport. Claude&#8217;s parents arrive, the mother speaks out. [Does class resentment affect Hortense?] Was there something funny about the death? &#8220;It was no accident&#8221; she says. &#8220;Who took the medal?&#8221; [Is drinking the answer to disappointments?] Rhoda&#8217;s father is away for the next four weeks. Christine finds something in Rhoda&#8217;s jewelry case: the missing Penmanship Medal! [Watch the behavior or Rhoda. Is she an adroit liar?] &#8220;Is that the truth?&#8221; [Does a changing story show guilt?] We learn more about Rhoda&#8217;s past. [Is this believable?] &#8220;It can&#8217;t be true!&#8221; Rhoda&#8217;s father sent her a tea set. &#8220;Aunt Monica is sweet.&#8221; Leroy says he knows what people say about Rhoda, and what Rhoda did to Claude. The police can detect blood on a stick. [Luminol,]Leroy made a bed from excelsior in the basement so he can rest during the day. Can a child commit a murder? Yes, he says. It depends on the environment. There is talk about heredity. Could a person kill and get away with it? A good looking woman would, goes this story. [What if there are women on the jury? &#8220;Don&#8217;t hate me because I&#8217;m beautiful.&#8221;] What if Christine was an adopted child? [Look at family photographs.] &#8220;Whose child am I?&#8221; &#8220;I must know.&#8221; Christine has childhood memories. Is it only a dream? She learns the truth about the Denker family! &#8220;Don&#8217;t let it bother you.&#8221; Rhoda wants to throw her shoes into the incinerator. [In that large mansion?] She confesses, and show her emotions. &#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; &#8220;I won&#8217;t let them hurt you.&#8221; Rhoda also tells what happened earlier. Does Leroy talk too much?&#8220;I never had shoes like that.&#8221; [We can guess what will happen to Leroy.] Mrs. Dagel drops by again to talk to Rhoda. She knows Rhoda was on the dock before Claude died. What can Christine tell Kenneth? They hear shouting from the cellar. The outside cellar door was locked! [Basement apartments are dangerous.] Rhoda plays the piano loud and fast. &#8220;Do you love me, Mommy?&#8221; Christine has new vitamin pills for Rhoda, she will take them too. Rhoda tells about the matches, it was all Leroy&#8217;s fault. Christine reads to Rhoda, she won&#8217;t let them hurt Rhoda. &#8220;I will sleep too.&#8221; Later they ask &#8220;why did she do it&#8221;? &#8220;You still have Rhoda.&#8221; &#8220;I love you Daddy.&#8221; But Christine survived. &#8220;Will Mommy get better?&#8221; Monica fixed up a place on the roof to sunbathe. Rhoda gets up in the night. Christine telephones Kenneth. Rhoda goes to that dock on a rainy stormy night. [They ask to not reveal the ending, which differs from the controversial play.]This is an unbelievable story. Does Rhoda look like an 8-year old? Its like a propaganda film where the audience doesn&#8217;t believe the advertising message. Can anyone believe it? The Hollywood Code provided a better ending, but this movie appears to have been a major and deserved failure. Maybe it would be more believable if Rhoda was 14 years old, like Constance Kent. Why is there an absent father? Are the men shown as lacking in something?

Frankly I was blown away by it. Before becoming a film, it had completed over 200 showings as a stage production. The original cast is inluded in the film, which explains why everyone nails their character.My favorite movie of all time, after seeing thousands of movies from modern to silent era, is Signs. One of the qualities of signs success at achieving creepiness and claustrophobia was the choice to keep 90 percent of the story in the house and its surrounding cornfields. As signs, a massive majority of the movie takes place within a spacious apartment and backyard, with a few exceptions.Yes, the bad seed is black and white. Get over it. I have spent years defending the quality of older films, be it black and white or cinemascope. Drain the color from L.A. Confidential or Find Me Guilty for a cool treat. Frankly, if it's a problem for you... as I always say... you are missing it. Get on board. Hey, wouldn't it be cool to be the unique eccentric one in the group that actually knows James Cagney for his talent rather than Michaelangelo's impersonation in Ninja Turtles? I feel better now.Acting, as afore mentioned, is superb. Yeah, put here all of the critical cliche's deserving of a great cast. One of the best drunks I have ever seen. A child star that near matches L. Blair (in a different way, yeah.) A mother that rides rollercoasters with her facial expressions and moods... its just cool really. It touches everything just right, and is entirely believable.When originally released, the studio thought it was so disturbing that they had the cast take a bow after you see ""The End"". A cheerful voice appears from behind the words and reassures tha audience that no one was really burn-... I better not go there. Then after the bows, there is a funny obligatory moment, to show the actual humanity of the child star. And yes, it still holds that intensity. Also, reguardless that the reason was studio restrictions, it keeps true to the rule that the audiences imagination is a better tool than any special effect ridden death scene.After seeing The Bad Seed again after nearly a decade, it is nice to see that it still has the effect on on me as an adult that it did when I was a child. All I wanna do is convince you to watch it, so forgive me for not including the usual theatrics included in the average review.

236266,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,6300270270,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[2, 3]","""The Bad Seed"" holds a unique place in cinema history for daring (in 1956) to show a small child as being a wilful and calculating evil killer.  I can only imagine the impact it must have had on it's release in the 1950's when portraying such cold-blooded behaviour in children would be unprecedented. But as a viewer today, I can only review it based on my own impressions, and whether it lives up to it's reputation and still works today.The story is not complicated, it revolves simply around an eight year old girl named Rhoda and her family. Rhoda appears to be the perfect daughter, all plaits and smiles and frilly dresses, but unbeknown to her mother she is a skilled troublemaker, and has no compunction or guilt in ""removing"" obstacles that stand in the way of her getting what she wants. Most notably, the action centres on a school handwriting competition that sees Rhoda denied first place. The prize goes to another classmate who is subsequently found drowned...is it possible that rivalry among a class of kids this young could lead to murder? And how could it possibly be the ultra-cute Rhoda with her cute manners and sunny demeanor? It's left up to Rhoda's mother, Christine, to face up to the terrible truth behind her daughter's perfect facade.What works the best is undoubtedly Patty McCormack's performance as Rhoda. Without her portrayal the film would not be half of what is is here. Totally relaxed and confident, McCormack brings the character beautifully to life. Her delivery, ranging from petulant, suger-sweet, angry or cruel is spot on every time, and her facial expressions rival many adult actors in terms of ambiguity. It's easy to believe Rhoda has most adults in the palm of her hand with her disarming good manners and sweet behaviour, but it's equally easy to imagine the evil underneath when she is seen purposely covering up damning evidence or taunting the few brave souls that dare speak out against her. As long as Rhoda is on screen, the film is a joy to watch. But conversely, when she's not....oh dear. The film creaks to a slow crawl as the adult characters mill about with lots of hand-wringing and soul searching as they try and make sense of the bizarre goings on. The worst offender is Nancy Kelly in the pivotal role of Christine, Rhoda's anxious mother. Both Kelly and McCormack played the same characters in the original stage production, but unfortunately, unlike the serene McCormack, Kelly acts like she's still on stage, gesticulating with tremendously exaggerated movements and hammy histrionics at every one of Rhoda's misdemeanours which look far too over-the-top on celluloid. This weeping and wailing hampers the dramatic tension greatly, and a little firmer direction of her performance could have darkened the overall tone to even better effect.Veracity is not further helped by some sadly very dated psycho-babble about the possible cause behind Rhoda's homicidal tendancies. Nancy Kelly's confession, when she reveals why she suspects Rhoda to be a ""bad seed"" is amusingly implausible, and presumably based on some kind of mid-1950's quack psychology, because it really sounds daft today. However, I will say though, that Nancy's final scene as Christine still has some potency, as she takes final measures to stop all the madness in the only way she can see how. Thanks to the tiresome Hays Code of the day, though, the film is famous for having a tacked on ending that follows Rhoda to her come-uppance (one which the stage version never meted out), and although many audiences have howled at the obvious ""divine retribution"" tone of it, if you watch it, it's actually not that bad as a plot continuation, although the actual depiction of it is rather ridiculous. What really fails, though, is the wildly inappropriate final curtain call which shows Christine enthusiastically spanking Rhoda as both giggle profusely. This 30 second shot, with no reason or relevance to ANYTHING that has gone before in the film, is the worst mistake of the whole affair, and should have been erased from as many releases as possible - it would have been a perfect DVD extra, no way should it still appear as the final shot of the movie.Having said that, the whole film itself is a lot of fun. I woudl recommend it for an afternoon's entertainment, as long as you watch it with hindsight about restrictions that go with it's time, you can appreciate the plot pretty well. It does suffer from some stagy acting, and some stagy setpieces as well, with over-reliance on a few conversation-heavy sequences that take place in just one room.

236272,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300270270,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","With a delicious score from Alex North to anchor every scene, `The Bad Seed' is one of the more unnerving films I've ever seen, even if it is seriously flawed.  I mean, thinking back on this, it is really kind of bad and yet kind of brilliant and I can't for the life of me decide which outweighs the other.  The acting, outside of a true gem in Patty McCormack, is atrocious (that Oscar nomination for Eileen Heckart is one of the worst in the history of the Oscars), the ending is far too drawn out and the melodramatic frustrations in the unraveling of the plot are really tiresome and yet they all come together to make something rather marvelous.I couldn't stop watching it.The film is adapted from a stage play of the same name that covers the evil decline of young Rhoda Penmark, a conniving and heartless little girl who will stoop to murder to get whatever it is that she wants.  With a pitch perfect outward appearance, she fools the fools around her, but when her mother starts to see through her candy coated shell to the evil within (after she murders a schoolmate for his penmanship award) things start to crumble fast.The film gets a tad too wordy in scenes, trying too hard to paint a complete picture and get `intellectual' about it all, and that just comes across forced and can make some of the scenes drag, and Eileen Heckart's two scenes are two scenes too many.  Seriously, acting drunk does not mean acting like an idiot.  I don't even know where to begin with that mess.  Nancy Kelly isn't a whole lot better.  The problem with transferring these stage actors over to the big screen is that they don't know how to emote without over dramatizing everything.Which is precisely why Patty McCormack's largely internalized performance is BRILLIANT.I know that sounds like a lot of complaining, but like I said, this is a very compelling film and it is intense from start to finish, so it does have a lot going for it despite having so many notable flaws.",4,So bad it's good?,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1973,"['delicious', 'score', 'Alex', 'North', 'anchor', 'scene', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'one', 'more', 'unnerving', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'even', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'mean', 'thinking', 'back', 'really', 'kind', 'bad', 'yet', 'kind', 'brilliant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'decide', 'outweighs', 'other', 'acting', 'true', 'gem', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'atrocious', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'one', 'worst', 'history', 'Oscars', 'ending', 'far', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'melodramatic', 'frustrations', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'are', 'really', 'tiresome', 'yet', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'something', 'rather', 'marvelous.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'it.The', 'film', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'evil', 'decline', 'young', 'Rhoda', 'Penmark', 'conniving', 'heartless', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'stoop', 'murder', 'get', 'whatever', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'outward', 'appearance', 'fools', 'when', 'mother', 'see', 'candy', 'coated', 'shell', 'evil', 'schoolmate', 'penmanship', 'award', 'things', 'start', 'crumble', 'fast.The', 'film', 'tad', 'too', 'wordy', 'scenes', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'paint', 'complete', 'picture', 'get', 'intellectual', 'just', 'across', 'forced', 'can', 'make', 'scenes', 'drag', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'too', 'many', 'Seriously', 'acting', 'drunk', 'not', 'mean', 'acting', 'idiot', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'mess', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'problem', 'transferring', 'stage', 'actors', 'big', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'emote', 'dramatizing', 'everything.Which', 'precisely', 'why', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'largely', 'internalized', 'performance', 'BRILLIANT.I', 'know', 'lot', 'complaining', 'said', 'very', 'compelling', 'film', 'intense', 'start', 'finish', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'notable', 'flaws']",Bad Seed VHS

236277,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300270270,Austin Somlo,"[1, 4]","Viewed: 5/14Rate: 25/14: What should have been a simple black-and-white 90 minute horror film, The Bad Seed is a 130 minute non-stop talky picture with possibly one of the worst, most laughable deus ex machina endings I've ever seen. Then, there is an added unnecessary finish by having all of the players bowing to the audience for the final curtain call and showing Nancy Kelly mock-spanking (what?) Patty for fun. Regardless, the pacing of the film is a dreadful bore; sometimes, with so many lines to spew out, the characters are speaking them fast as possible and then slowing down their cadence when they have shorter lines. It's pretty awkward at times as it is painfully clear that the film is a theatrical play instead. Astounded as I am at the fact that three of the actresses were nominated for their performances, they, save for Nancy Kelly who gives an all right but nothing to get gaga about performance, are truly terrible. Eileen Heckart, who plays Hortense Diagle, wildly overacts, chews unnecessarily too much of the screen time, is too theatrical for her own good, and won't simply go away. Ditto for Evelyn Varden as Breedlove and Henry Jones as Leroy. William Hopper, who plays the colonel, is a perfect candidate for Plan 9 from Outer Space. Finally, the worst acting performance and the shining example of what an awful child actor looks like with no acting experience is Patty McCormack's. It's one of the most pathetic portrayal of what a bad seed is supposed to act like. In fact, the film should have been aptly re-titled as The Spoiled Seed. The film runs far too long; I am just bored of the circular talking, the theatrical acting, and the lack of horror. And now the ending...my goodness...let me make a very good, educated guess about why it happened: because the characters talked for so long, the director, Mervyn LeRoy, had run out of time and money, so he opted for a very hasty, wrap-it-up-pronto of an ending just to tie up all the loose ends if there were any. Anyway, I blame the film's failure on the director who was probably lazy throughout, and no wonder why Alfred Hitchcock turned down the chance to direct this turkey. I can't bear watching it again if ever; it is too boring to sit through. All in all, The Spoiled Seed is the BIG BORE.",1,So Bad That It's So Ridiculous. Three Acting Nominations?

We just saw this a few days ago on TMC, and it's quite a wallop packer of a story.Great thriller for its time that brings to light the fact that sociopathic children of this day are nothing new.  A cold-blooded little killer who has  to have her own way over stupid things like a penmanship medal and a snow globe will tell you that a child who is smart is still a child.  She looks and dresses like a little lady, but the ice in her veins tells you that this kid is capable of playing happily in the yard, dancing around and playing piano only moments after tap dancing on a little boy's fingers.  Spine chilling moments ensue for little actress Patty McCormack as she cold-bloodedly admits to the horrible crimes she's commited, and yet her ""basket of kisses and basket of hugs"" spiel just doesn't come off charming at all.  Like Henry Jones's character Leroy, you see right through her.Nancy Kelly's characterization of Rhoda's mother Christine is why I gave this move 4 stars instead of 5.  Come on now, you are that stupid and opaque that you keep making excuses for a child who isn't even charming in her ladylike demeanor.  Her snotty delivery on curtsies doesn't throw mom or the lady upstairs off?  Worse yet is the way Kelly's voice squeals like an asthmatic smoker the more wild she goes over the realization that Rhoda is a bit too much like Grandma.Outside of Kelly's lousy acting(and it is, people), McCormack is downright bone chilling when she throws screaming tantrums almost as if she is in The Exorcist.  Henry Jones is also noteworthy as the crafty, sleazy janitor who is simpatico with Rhoda, and Eileen Heckart's portrayal as Claude's drunken grieving mother are the highlights of this film.  It is ahead of its time considering what children are capable of these days.  If you like this movie, I'd like to recommend Lisa Gardner's novel Live to Tell on the same subject of violent children.

When one of Rhoda's classmates is killed in an unfortunate drowning accident, Christine Penmark begins to suspect that her jealous daughter might have had something to do with it. Soon, she learns that this might not have been the first time that Rhoda was responsible for murder, nor would it be the last...THE BAD SEED, adapted from the novel by William March, explores the concept of nature versus nurture through the terrifying tale of a child murderer and her submissive mother. It attempts to play both sides of the coin, though it would seem that the final conclusion is that Rhoda has a genetic disposition that forces her to kill. The lack of a central father figure due Mr. Penmark's involvement in the military might also suggest the latter argument. THE BAD SEED would be nominated for four Academy Awards, both for the superb cinematography and for the incredible performances by the leading and supporting cast members. Nancy Kelly is brilliant as the distraught Christine Penmark, whose fear and paranoia creep off the screen. She is joined by Patty McCormack in an unforgettable performance as the manipulative Rhoda. McCormack transforms from a starry-eyed little angel into a tumultuous devil in seconds.

Much is made of environment playing the main role in a child's criminal behavior, not genetics.As Christine begins suspecting Rhoda more, weird handyman Leroy (Henry Jones, who is great) begins teasing Rhoda, knowing she was involved. Christine's reporter dad (Paul Fix) drops by with the bombshell that Christine was in fact adopted and her birth mother was a murderer whose case the father was covering.As Christine tries to battle these life changing issues, another major character dies. Christine then makes the decision to stop Rhoda's murderous habits for good, and take herself out of the picture as well.While often placed in the horror section of video stores, this is more Hitchcockian suspense than anything. On the positive, it does contain some creepy scenes. When McCormack describes how she killed her classmate, I got chills down my spine. Also Kelly's recounting of her recurring dream about escaping from her real mother's house when she was a toddler is also good. Kelly and McCormack deserved their Oscar nominations for these brief scenes alone.Director LeRoy makes no bones about this story's popularity on the stage first, and there are too many scenes set in Christine's living room. He does not try to open it up enough, and instead of claustrophobia, boredom sets in. It is one thing for a mother not wanting to believe the worst of her child, it is another when the mother seems too stupid not to believe the worst. LeRoy overplays everyone's love for the child, to the point of nausea.While the audience knows the child is a killer, we must sit through quite a few static dialogue scenes before others figure it out. While Jones is good as Leroy, it seems his fate is put near the end of the film so we would not be mad at Christine, who could have stopped her daughter from harming him. He is made lecherous and weird, so we won't feel bad when anything happens to him.The cast here is way over the top. Much of the gestures are very broad, and even the speech delivery is overly theatrical. The cast still seems to be playing for a live audience, and there is not the intimacy of film in the execution here. Eileen Heckart is the dead boy's drunk grieving mom, and plays her as that and nothing more.A word about the ending. The cast is called back out for a curtain call, just like onstage. Then actress Kelly play-spanks actress McCormack, both laughing. I do not know if this was supposed to diffuse the downer ending, but instead it negates it, trying too hard to remind the audience that this is just a movie.Despite the few tense scenes, this is a very dry and boring film. The cast tries to liven it, but they try too hard, resulting in overacting an underwritten story. I hate to do this, and I may be the only one on this planet, but I do not recommend &quot;The Bad Seed.&quot;This is unrated, and contains adult situations.",2,Mervyn LeRoy's The Bad Seed,1023062400,"06 3, 2002",2002,3680,"['classic', 'suspense', 'field', '1950', 'film', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'reputation.Rhoda', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'perfect', 'little', 'pig-tailed', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'overloved', 'military', 'dad', 'stoic', 'mom', 'even', 'frumpy', 'landlady', 'upstairs', 'hunky', 'father', 'William', 'Hopper', 'temporary', 'duty', 'Christine', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'alone', 'Rhoda', 'A', 'child', 'school', 'picnic', 'out', 'Rhoda', 'was', 'last', 'see', 'alive', 'Rhoda', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'little', 'Claude', 'penmanship', 'medal', 'something', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'won.Christine', 'begins', 'suspect', 'not', 'perfect', 'little', 'Rhoda', 'emotion', 'losing', 'classmate', 'somehow', 'up', 'disputed', 'medal', 'Christine', 'consulting', 'amateur', 'psychologist/landlady', 'Monica', 'Evelyn', 'Varden', 'criminologist', 'Much', 'made', 'environment', 'playing', 'main', 'role', 'child', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'not', 'genetics.As', 'Christine', 'suspecting', 'Rhoda', 'more', 'weird', 'handyman', 'Leroy', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'who', 'great', 'teasing', 'Rhoda', 'knowing', 'was', 'involved', 'Christine', 'reporter', 'dad', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'drops', 'bombshell', 'Christine', 'was', 'fact', 'adopted', 'birth', 'mother', 'was', 'murderer', 'case', 'father', 'was', 'covering.As', 'Christine', 'tries', 'battle', 'life', 'changing', 'issues', 'major', 'character', 'dies', 'Christine', 'then', 'decision', 'stop', 'Rhoda', 'murderous', 'habits', 'good', 'take', 'picture', 'well.While', 'often', 'placed', 'horror', 'section', 'video', 'stores', 'more', 'Hitchcockian', 'suspense', 'anything', 'positive', 'contain', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'When', 'McCormack', 'how', 'killed', 'classmate', 'got', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'Also', 'Kelly', 'recounting', 'recurring', 'dream', 'escaping', 'real', 'mother', 'house', 'when', 'was', 'toddler', 'also', 'good', 'Kelly', 'McCormack', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'brief', 'scenes', 'alone.Director', 'LeRoy', 'bones', 'story', 'popularity', 'stage', 'first', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'set', 'Christine', 'living', 'room', 'not', 'try', 'open', 'up', 'enough', 'instead', 'claustrophobia', 'boredom', 'sets', 'one', 'thing', 'mother', 'not', 'wanting', 'believe', 'worst', 'child', 'when', 'mother', 'too', 'stupid', 'not', 'believe', 'worst', 'LeRoy', 'everyone', 'love', 'child', 'point', 'audience', 'child', 'killer', 'must', 'sit', 'quite', 'few', 'static', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'others', 'figure', 'out', 'Jones', 'good', 'Leroy', 'fate', 'put', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'mad', 'Christine', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'stopped', 'daughter', 'harming', 'made', 'lecherous', 'weird', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bad', 'when', 'anything', 'him.The', 'cast', 'here', 'way', 'top', 'Much', 'gestures', 'are', 'very', 'broad', 'even', 'speech', 'delivery', 'overly', 'theatrical', 'cast', 'still', 'be', 'playing', 'live', 'audience', 'not', 'intimacy', 'film', 'execution', 'here', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'dead', 'boy', 'drunk', 'grieving', 'mom', 'nothing', 'more.A', 'word', 'ending', 'cast', 'called', 'back', 'out', 'curtain', 'call', 'just', 'onstage', 'Then', 'actress', 'Kelly', 'play-spanks', 'actress', 'McCormack', 'laughing', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'diffuse', 'downer', 'ending', 'instead', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'remind', 'audience', 'just', 'movie.Despite', 'few', 'tense', 'scenes', 'very', 'dry', 'boring', 'film', 'cast', 'liven', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'resulting', 'overacting', 'underwritten', 'story', 'hate', 'do', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'planet', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Bad', 'Seed.', 'quot', 'unrated', 'adult', 'situations']",Bad Seed VHS

This film caused such a stir in its hey day that the ending was changed AND a playful curtain call was added, with &quot;Miss Rhoda&quot; being put over her movie mom's knee.This is a film you can watch again and again.  Rhoda is a creepy little girl who has no sense of right or wrong and her only motive is to get what she wants at whatever cost.  People around her are dispensible.  The characters cast in TBS give riveting performances, especially the drunken mother of one of Rhoda's victims. (a Tony award winner as a result)  You find yourself feeling sympathy for Rhoda's mother who is racked with fear, grief and a never-ending feeling of guilt over her daughter's presence in the world.  One of my favorite scenes is when Rhoda is skipping down the steps en route to yet another day of imminent destruction and is sprayed with water intentionally.  Her temper flares and boy does she go off on poor LeRoy!  To watch them go at it in later scenes adds more fuel to this fiery film.There are just too many memorable &quot;moments&quot; to name here.

236304,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6300270270,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[69, 77]","Does heredity and environment play equal parts in a child's development?  Or is one factor stronger than the other?  That's the loaded question the film The Bad Seed (1956) brings forth, seemingly siding on the side of heredity.  Personally, I would tend to lean towards environment, but until we can definitely discern the nature of the wiring of our brains, mapping the neural networks and determining the thought processing pathways, we may never know...does bad beget bad?  It's possible, but if so, what choices do we have in terms of ending genetically transposed evil from traversing one generation to another?  Enforced sterilization?  I wouldn't touch that subject with a ten foot Lech Walesa...The Bad Seed, directed by Mervyn LeRoy (No Time for Sergeants), is actually a film based on a play written by Maxwell Anderson, which was based on a novel written by William March...quite a circuitous path to the silver screen, but one worth waiting for, in my opinion.As the story begins, we meet the Penmarks, Kenneth (Hopper), Christine (Kelly), and their eight year old daughter Rhoda (McCormack), replete with blue eyes, blonde hair and pigtails.  The family appears very normal, except Rhoda, who seems just a little too sweet, a little too ingratiating...but whatever...soon after Kenneth, who's a colonel in the military, has to leave for an extended period of time on some army business, one of Rhoda's school mates dies mysterious drowning incident, after supposedly falling off the end of a pier (seems the boy won an award coveted by Rhoda).  No one is overtly posing the theory of foul play in the boy's death, but Christine discovers evidence suggesting her daughter may not be `sugar, spice, and everything nice' (by this time the audience has already entertained the notion that the glossy, sickly sweet veneer presented by Rhoda may conceal more than any of the cast is willing to accept).  Connections are made, and truths are revealed (along with a long buried secret), but how does a mother accept the possibility that her child, her own flesh and blood, may be a cold, methodical, remorseless monster, especially when nearly everyone else believes differently .While I did enjoy this movie, it does have its' faults.  As others have mentioned, the film appears much like that of a staged play (not necessarily good for a film).  The theater and film are two very different mediums, and what's good for one may not be good for the other.  The theatrics within some of the characters (especially that of Ms. Kelly), while necessary for the stage, didn't always jibe on the screen.  I do think all the actors did really well, even if a few of the performances tended to be over the top, but for the sake of the film, I think director LeRoy could have provided a stronger production coaxing a bit more subtly from certain cast members.  Also, I have to say I found it a little hard to swallow at times that nearly everyone should except Rhoda's sweet, sweet act so whole-heartedly, as she tended to pour it on so very thick.  Are, or were, adults ever this gullible?  I could understand a certain amount of denial, as we like to think children are basically pure, unadulterated little lumps of clay, waiting to be fashioned into beings better than ourselves, but it seemed everyone (well, except for the handyman Leroy, played by Jones) was so very patently blind to her rather transparent act.  Maybe I complain too much...the film did have an incredibly eerie quality throughout, and Patty McCormack did a wonderful job presenting her character, often giving me a major case of the creeps with a side order of the willies.  Two performances that really stand out are that of Eileen Heckart and Henry Jones.  Heckart plays the mother of the boy who died, drowning herself in the drink, trying to come to terms with what happened, knowing there is more to what happened than nearly everyone believes.  Jones performance as Leroy, the creepy, borderline pedophilic handyman is probably the best, as he believes, while Rhoda has most everyone else fooled, he can see right through her act she puts on for the other adults, and takes some kind of perverse pleasure in teasing and taunting her, that is until he comes to the realization that Rhoda might not be just a spoiled, bratty child but something much more...something truly evil...  The scenes with Jones and McCormack are chilling, partly because McCormack's character tends to drop the sweet, charming, adorable act knowing it won't work on Leroy, but also secure in the knowledge no one would believe him.  The film runs surprisingly just a tad over two hours, but I felt the time was used well.  Some have commented on the ending, and the difference between the film and the play, but one should keep in mind the ending used complied with The Motion Picture Production Code which had specific requirements with regards to criminal activity portrayed on the screen.  It may have felt `tacked on', but it sure was satisfying (divine retribution, perhaps?)The full screen (original aspect ratio) picture on this DVD looks really good, and the audio is clear and sharp.  Special features include an original trailer, an interview piece with McCormack titled Enfant Terrible, and a commentary track featuring Patricia McCormack and everyone's favorite cross-dressing actor/playwright and Bette Davis enthusiast Charles BuschCookieman108",4,"""Rhoda, what happened to old Mrs. Post in Witchita?""",1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,5410,"['Does', 'heredity', 'environment',

With blonde pigtails and fetching freckles, Rhoda is precocious, charming, polite, gregarious, outgoing, vicious, vindictive, manipulative, calculating, homicidal...She's 'DENNIS THE MENACE' with a sex change on a 'roid rage bender; Damien Thorn's demonic sibling in a pretty summer frock.She easily dispatches several of the cast members with the same kind of shrug and smile she would use to ask for milk and cookies, and Christine begins a little intuitive detective work, searching her own troubled past for the clues to why, as Rhoda's crimes and her darker nature become more and more horrifyingly apparent...Controversial in its day, I wish I could've been in the audience who attended its premiere. And the morality code be damned, I never accepted why they tacked on the ""shocking"" ending, though the times being what they were, I do understand why it was unavoidable. All I knew is that at the young age I was when I saw it, the concept of a little girl evil enough to make GOD strike her dead, scared the absolute Hershey squirts out of me!Most of the cast is from the original Broadway production, and though the acting seems more geared for the stage than screen and therefore appears to be overdone, I thought Nancy Kelly was fine as the emotionally disintegrating Christine. Considering what she discovers about Rhoda, as well as what she learns about herself, it's a wonder she wasn't MORE freaked out! And what more can be said about the jaw-droppingly awesome performance by Patty McCormack? We can trace a line of child-acting evolution from her turn as Rhoda directly to outstanding screen tykes like Dakota Fanning, but we have yet to see a turn from any of our younger thespians that will give you nightmares the way Patty's has done for countless adult moviegoers. (Okay, there was Harvey Stephens as the adorable little devil who had this problem with churches...)Henry Jones as Leroy should've damn well been honored with a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the very least. He made such an impression on me, that for years afterward, I always thought of him as ""toasted Leroy."" And Eileen Heckart balanced humor and histrionics with tightrope precision as Mrs. Daigle, the mother of the little boy who becomes Rhoda's first victim. Though you can't help but laugh at her at some points, your sympathy for her pain is always palpable.It would be hard to do a bad movie with all these veterans around, and Mervyn LeRoy knew that. It's only too bad he didn't attempt to open things up a bit more to let the movie out of its ""playhouse"" cage. Still, it remains a classic, in spite of the fact that with what we now know about kids today and what they are capable of, in places with tragic histories like Santee and Columbine, the subject matter is sadly enough, no longer sensational or unique. Which is a lot more chilling realization than this movie could achieve for today's audiences.",4,"Sugar, Spice and...BELLADONNA!",1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,3617,"['yet', 'one', 'late', 'night', 'classics', 'sneaked', 'when', 'was', 'eight', 'when', 'was', 'actually', 'supposed', 'be', 'bed', 'BAD', 'SEED', 'still', 'packed', 'quite', 'wallop', 'even', 'then', 'Now', 'nearly', 'half-century', 'release', 'staid', 'somewhat', 'static', 'presentation', 'certainly', 'stage', 'play', 'acting', 'borders', 'MST3K', 'campiness', 'still', 'much', 'original', 'ghoulish', 'charm', 'only', 'familiar', 'noxious', 'TV', 'movie', 'remake', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'original.Christine', 'Penmark', 'great', 'life', 'handsome', 'successful', 'husband', 'military', 'PERRY', 'MASON', 'William', 'Hopper', 'cutest', 'daughter', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'Rhoda', 'blonde', 'pigtails', 'fetching', 'freckles', 'Rhoda', 'precocious', 'charming', 'polite', 'gregarious', 'outgoing', 'vicious', 'vindictive', 'manipulative', 'calculating', 'homicidal', 'THE', 'MENACE', 'sex', 'change', ""'roid"", 'rage', 'bender', 'Damien', 'Thorn', 'demonic', 'sibling', 'pretty', 'summer', 'frock.She', 'easily', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'same', 'kind', 'shrug', 'smile', 'would', 'use', 'ask', 'milk', 'cookies', 'Christine', 'little', 'intuitive', 'detective', 'work', 'searching', 'own', 'troubled', 'past', 'clues', 'why', 'Rhoda', 'crimes', 'darker', 'nature', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'horrifyingly', 'apparent', 'Controversial', 'day', 'wish', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'audience', 'who', 'attended', 'premiere', 'morality', 'code', 'be', 'damned', 'never', 'accepted', 'why', 'tacked', 'shocking', 'ending', 'times', 'being', 'what', 'were', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'unavoidable', 'knew', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'when', 'saw', 'concept', 'little', 'girl', 'evil', 'enough', 'make', 'GOD', 'strike', 'dead', 'scared', 'absolute', 'Hershey', 'Most', 'cast', 'original', 'Broadway', 'production', 'acting', 'more', 'geared', 'stage', 'screen', 'therefore', 'be', 'overdone', 'thought', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'was', 'fine', 'emotionally', 'disintegrating', 'Christine', 'Considering', 'what', 'Rhoda', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'MORE', 'freaked', 'out', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'jaw-droppingly', 'awesome', 'performance', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'can', 'trace', 'line', 'child-acting', 'evolution', 'turn', 'Rhoda', 'directly', 'outstanding', 'screen', 'tykes', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'turn', 'younger', 'thespians', 'will', 'give', 'way', 'Patty', 'done', 'countless', 'adult', 'moviegoers', 'Okay', 'was', 'Harvey', 'Stephens', 'adorable', 'little', 'devil', 'who', 'had', 'problem', 'churches', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'Leroy', 'should', ""'ve"", 'damn', 'well', 'been', 'honored', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'very', 'least', 'made', 'impression', 'years', 'afterward', 'always', 'thought', 'toasted', 'Leroy', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'balanced', 'humor', 'histrionics', 'tightrope', 'precision', 'Mrs.', 'Daigle', 'mother', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'Rhoda', 'first', 'victim', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'points', 'sympathy', 'pain', 'always', 'palpable.It', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'do', 'bad', 'movie', 'veterans', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'knew', 'only', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'open', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'let', 'movie', 'playhouse', 'cage', 'Still', 'classic', 'spite', 'fact', 'what', 'now', 'know', 'kids', 'today', 'what', 'are', 'capable', 'places', 'tragic', 'histories', 'Santee', 'Columbine', 'subject', 'matter', 'sadly', 'enough', 'no', 'longer', 'sensational', 'unique', 'Which', 'lot', 'more', 'chilling', 'realization', 'movie', 'could', 'achieve', 'today', 'audiences']",Bad Seed VHS

236312,A1FDW1SPYKB354,6300270270,David Von Pein,"[28, 29]","Cool-as-a-cucumber Rhoda Penmark is not at all what she appears to be. Hiding underneath that sweet, perfect exterior exists an unspeakable evil. Patty McCormack is superb as Rhoda, the pig-tailed murderess. The whole cast, in fact, is first-rate here. Some chilling moments await the viewer of this film, including a classic ending! A very good music score accompanies the action, as well.This film was originally a stage play, and this ""stagy"" feel somewhat comes through in the movie version as well.  But the film's convincing and effectively-told story cannot be denied.  I would have loved, however, to have been able to see the stage play version, which starred the same group of actors we see in the motion picture.Patty McCormack was 10 years old when ""The Bad Seed"" was made in 1956. Patty was so good here, she received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She lost the Oscar to Dorothy Malone, however.Two other ""Bad Seed"" actresses were also nominated for Oscars -- Nancy Kelly and Eileen Heckart.  Heckart was heart-breakingly good in this movie, playing the mother of one of Rhoda's victims.In my opinion, Henry Jones (as handyman ""LeRoy"") could very easily have been yet *another* Oscar nominee that year.  Jones was wonderfully ""offbeat"" in ""The Bad Seed"", delivering lines with a relish that simply *must* be replayed multiple times when watching this DVD.  They are just too good and humorous to only view once. Such as his witty warning to little Rhoda: ""They've got a little blue [electric] chair for little boys; and a little pink chair for little gals!""This DVD retains the originally-shown ""actors taking a bow"" ending, which (in a way) dilutes the fabulous conclusion of the story.  But, I like having the original ending included here nevertheless.  You can always turn it off before you get to the last few minutes, so that you'll be left with that great ending ""on the pier"".Original poster art adorns the cover of this DVD.  And while I really like the diabolical look on Rhoda's face on this package, I'm perplexed (for the most part) by the written passages that are shown.  They don't seem to quite ""fit"" this movie, IMO.  Most curious I thought.  Well, anyway, at least Warner Brothers has given us some original artwork for the cover (which is nice).DVD Specs ...... Video is the OAR (Original Aspect Ratio) as seen in theaters in late 1956 -- Full Frame (1.33:1).  This actually kind of surprised me a tad bit.  Because I thought this film just *might* have been shot in a Widescreen format (which was, by 1956, becoming commonplace among movie studios).  But, obviously, I was mistaken.  The Full Frame format is correct for this movie. .... Audio: 1.0 Dolby Digital Mono soundtrack (English only).  The audio for the Commentary Track is in rich-sounding 2.0 DD Stereo, with excellent channel separation between the two channels. .... Subtitles: English, French, and Spanish.The video quality on this disc is absolutely superb!  Just perfect from what I can see. This B&W; film has never looked better on your TV screen. Just a terrific DVD transfer.DVD Special Features include an Audio Commentary Track and a 15-minute ""Making Of"" documentary (""A Conversation With Patty McCormack""). McCormack, who was 58 years of age when this DVD was produced, provides some interesting observations about the making of the film during the documentary and she also participates in the Audio Commentary Track as well. The Original Theatrical Trailer is also included on this disc. This trailer, which has a run time of 3:19, is in very good shape (picture quality-wise), and is of particular interest to me for the many ""alternate takes"" that are shown of various scenes from the film. Nearly every scene that is previewed in this trailer is a slightly different variant from what ended up in the final cut of the movie.This 1956 suspense-filled treasure looks mighty fine on DVD. Pick up a copy of this Grade-A thriller and let little Rhoda come into your home any time of the day or night. Just make sure you don't kick the DVD around carelessly -- because Rhoda wouldn't like that. And when Rhoda is displeased, she gets slightly cranky.  :-)",5,"""The Bad Seed"" Blossoms Nicely On DVD!",1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,4188,"['Cool-as-a-cucumber', 'Rhoda', 'Penmark', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'Hiding', 'underneath', 'sweet', 'perfect', 'exterior', 'unspeakable', 'evil', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'superb', 'Rhoda', 'pig-tailed', 'murderess', 'whole', 'cast', 'fact', 'first-rate', 'here', 'chilling', 'moments', 'await', 'viewer', 'film', 'including', 'classic', 'ending', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'score', 'action', 'well.This', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'stage', 'play', 'stagy', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'movie', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'convincing', 'effectively-told', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'however', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'stage', 'play', 'version', 'starred', 'same', 'group', 'actors', 'see', 'motion', 'picture.Patty', 'McCormack', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'was', 'made', '1956', 'Patty', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'here', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'lost', 'Oscar', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'other', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'actresses', 'were', 'also', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'Heckart', 'was', 'heart-breakingly', 'good', 'movie', 'playing', 'mother', 'one', 'Rhoda', 'victims.In', 'opinion', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'handyman', 'LeRoy', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'yet', '*another*', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'year', 'Jones', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'offbeat', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'delivering', 'lines', 'relish', 'simply', '*must*', 'be', 'replayed', 'multiple', 'times', 'when', 'watching', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'humorous', 'only', 'view', 'once', 'Such', 'witty', 'warning', 'little', 'Rhoda', ""'ve"", 'got', 'little', 'blue', '[', 'electric', ']', 'chair', 'little', 'boys', 'little', 'pink', 'chair', 'little', 'gals', 'DVD', 'originally-shown', 'actors', 'taking', 'bow', 'ending', 'way', 'fabulous', 'conclusion', 'story', 'like', 'having', 'original', 'ending', 'included', 'here', 'nevertheless', 'can', 'always', 'turn', 'off', 'get', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'great', 'ending', 'pier', '.Original', 'poster', 'art', 'cover', 'DVD', 'really', 'diabolical', 'look', 'Rhoda', 'face', 'package', ""'m"", 'perplexed', 'most', 'part', 'written', 'passages', 'are', 'shown', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'fit', 'movie', 'IMO', 'Most', 'curious', 'thought', 'Well', 'anyway', 'least', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'given', 'original', 'artwork', 'cover', 'nice', '.DVD', 'Specs', 'Video', 'OAR', 'Original', 'Aspect', 'Ratio', 'seen', 'theaters', 'late', '1956', 'Full', 'Frame', '1.33:1', 'actually', 'kind', 'surprised', 'tad', 'bit', 'thought', 'film', 'just', '*might*', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'Widescreen', 'format', 'was', '1956', 'becoming', 'commonplace', 'movie', 'studios', 'obviously', 'was', 'mistaken', 'Full', 'Frame', 'format', 'correct', 'movie', 'Audio', '1.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Mono', 'soundtrack', 'English', 'only', 'audio', 'Commentary', 'Track', 'rich-sounding', '2.0', 'DD', 'Stereo', 'excellent', 'channel', 'separation', 'two', 'channels', 'Subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish.The', 'video', 'quality', 'disc', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'Just', 'perfect', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'B', 'W', 'film', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'TV', 'screen', 'Just', 'terrific', 'DVD', 'transfer.DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'include', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Track', '15-minute', 'Making', 'documentary', 'Conversation', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'McCormack', 'who', 'was', '58', 'years', 'age', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'produced', 'interesting', 'observations', 'making', 'film', 'documentary', 'also', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Track', 'as', 'well', 'Original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'also', 'included', 'disc', 'trailer', 'run', 'time', '3:19', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'picture', 'quality-wise', 'particular', 'interest', 'many', 'alternate', 'are', 'shown', 'various', 'scenes', 'film', 'Nearly', 'scene', 'previewed', 'trailer', 'slightly', 'different', 'variant', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'final', 'cut', 'movie.This', '1956', 'suspense-filled', 'treasure', 'mighty', 'fine', 'DVD', 'Pick', 'up', 'copy', 'Grade-A', 'thriller', 'let', 'little', 'Rhoda', 'come', 'home', 'time', 'day', 'night', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'kick', 'DVD', 'carelessly', 'Rhoda', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'Rhoda', 'displeased', 'slightly', 'cranky']",Bad Seed VHS
236313,A27ZOCD5B63Y0P,6300270270,"D. Collier ""Shelf-Help""","[13, 17]","...but you're the meanest!These words were spoken by LeRoy, the handyman, concerning the devilish 8-year-old Rhoda Penmark: murderer and penmanship champion wannabe.  And quite possibly the inspiration for Little House On the Prairie's Nellie Oleson.  Of course, that's just my own opinion.This little girl is mean indeed!  She's about as mean as they come.  After coming home from a school picnic in which her classmate has mysteriously drowned, Rhoda decides it's the perfect time for a tasty peanut butter sandwich and an enjoyable skate in the warm sunshine.  When LeRoy asks her how she can possibly be enjoying herself at such a time, she replies,""Why should I feel sorry?  It was Claude Dagel that got drowned, not me!""Don't expect any top-notch performances from this movie.  Most of the acting is way overdone, passing the characters off more as mere caricatures.  But this was a famous play before it was a famous movie (and a famous novel before either of those two), and, as I understand it, most of (if not all) the actors from the play were used in the movie as well.  There are a few good performances, like Mrs. Dagel, LeRoy, and at times even you-know-who.You-know-who is, of course, Rhoda Penmark, the only daughter of Colonel and Mrs. Penmark, and the center of the story.  Why is she referred to as ""the Bad Seed""?  Well, that expression in this film refers to a child who is born without a conscience, or without the ability to decipher between right and wrong; a child who is incapable of feeling any kind of remorse.And that's our girl!With Dad away on military business, Mom is left alone to raise up Rhoda in the way she ought to go, so that when she's older she will not depart from it (to use a Biblical reference).  But little by little, one by one, the hints of Rhoda's foul play start to close in on her mother.  But by the time Mom finds out about the evil lurking beneath Rhoda's disarming smile and innocent disposition it may be too late to redeem her daughter.

A loud and intrusive landlady (whom most of us secretly hope the kid will ""off"" sooner than later!). A creepy janitor who has a terrific scene in which he tries to scare the child as he talks about little blue electric chairs for little boys and little pink electric chairs for little girls. It just goes on. First a terrific novel by the under-rated William March (check out his ""Company K"" if you want to read a powerful anti-war book), then a stage adaptation, and, finally, the film. With stage cast pretty much intact, the film had to ""clean up"" the pessimism of the ending, and that is the single biggest flaw, in my opinion.  In fact, the film shows the last lines of the book but then adds the happier ending, followed by a ""curtain call"" (not always seen in previous VHS editions)in which the cast reappears as if on stage in order to further distance the audience from the horror of this tale of a murderous little girl. Despite all the 1950s white-washing, the film still has Patty McCormack (Rhoda), Henry Jones (LeRoy) and Eileen Heckart (Mrs. Daigle), who deliver the goods and then some.

236318,A2HB5ENM2PJAHL,6300270270,Dory P.,"[3, 4]","I saw ""The Bad Seed"" years ago, circa 1970, for the first time, and have seen it periodically over the years. When I first saw the film, as a child, I found the film, expectedly, quite chilling.I saw it again this afternoon, after not having seen it for about three years, and still find it quite disturbing. Now that we have IMDb, I decided to offer my thoughts. And so, I was shocked to find SO MANY comments about it...more than for any other film that I've reviewed on IMDb to date. If I add anything of unique value, great. If not, I'm happy to share my review anyway.Certainly, there are flaws, or perhaps only ""unique differences"", in this film. Primarily, it can very easily be considered a filmed play, as the staging, the dialog, and the entrances and exits of the characters throughout the film seem to be lifted directly from the stage version. Therefore, some may find the film a bit too sterile or unnatural in many ways. However, I think it is this very sterile, staged, stark-from-a-production-standpoint quality that gives the film an even eerier and in some ways far more realistic edge than might be found were it to be produced today for film, with far more slick and sophisticated sets, dialog, camera work, etc. The realism and pronounced disturbing quality of this version stem from the simple story itself, the psychological horror of which could be in some ways obfuscated from a much more sophisticated, big-studio, modern-day production.As for the subject matter itself, I know that the number of cases, historically, involving child murderers is actually low. Therefore, some critics have argued that to take a relatively rare phenomenon, such as the child murderer, and build a motion picture around it, portraying it in the vein of plausibility, can be misleading and dangerous, giving the impression, especially to younger viewers, that child criminals are more commonplace than you may think. I wholeheartedly reject this notion. The whole purpose of acting is to portray the entire range of the human condition with as much truth as possible, no matter how rare or commonplace certain aspects of human behavior might be. Though child murderers may be few in number, it's an area worthy of as much exploration, in film, as is an ugly, unrealistic alien telling us to ""phone home"" or the sinking of the Titanic.Even though this film possesses a definite ""campy"", staged, and perhaps even ""cult"" quality, it is chillingly effective. One reason for which this film works is due to the character of Rhoda herself, played by Patty McCormack. The smiling, blond, blue-eyed veneer of the child juxtaposed with the idea of her criminal potential (and actions) is just plain ""creepy"". Moreover, the less you see, in terms of the actual crimes she commits, the more you conjure. And, you continually wonder who her next victim will be. Furthermore, you wonder how many people will eventually ""come on to her"" and become aware of who she is, and how that knowledge will affect their fate.Another reason for which this film works is because of the mother, Christine, played by Nancy Kelly. As we slowly watch her become aware of what has become of her daughter, we can't help but empathize with her predicament and her decision in handling it. The first few times I saw the film, just as I felt that Patty McCormack's portrayal and dialog delivery were probably mere replicas of what she offered on stage, I felt that Nancy Kelly's performance was affected and probably lifted directly from her work on the stage (I've never seen a stage version, nor have I read the book, yet). But in the case of Ms. Kelly, watching her realize what she has ultimately given birth to and raised is very heart wrenching. Moreover, I have always wondered if the use of her right hand was a direction given to her by either of her directors (for play or film), or if it was something she came up with herself. Two instances come to mind.In the first one, the manner in which she hits the table with her right hand as she listens to what is happening outside near her shed while Rhoda plays ""Au Claire de la Lune"" on her piano is very pronounced, appears somewhat odd and is perhaps symbolic. She seemed to be pounding her hand not only in outward denial and anger at the realization she now has of what her child is capable of committing, but as a means to torture and punish herself for having given birth to her in the first place. In the second instance, Nancy Kelly used her right hand again in a very pronounced manner when she offers Rhoda her vitamins ""that night"". Again, I couldn't help but wonder what symbolism she wanted us to draw from her gesture. It might be said that this very hand, which once comforted and fed her child all her life, has now become the tool that feeds the ultimate fate of her child toward the end of the film. (Again, not having read it, I have a fairly good idea how the book ends).As for how the ending/epilogue in the film was handled, practically everyone on this site who has offered a review knows that the use of the ""casting call"" was basically dictated by the mandates of the Hays Code. I'll just add that I find that the chilling effect of the story carries over to this bizarre ""epilogue"". I still find it a bit unsettling to see each of these actors take their bows, especially considering that some of the characters they portrayed would, in my estimation, appear stranger to a child than does Rhoda....particularly Leroy, when he bows to the viewing audience carrying his large pitchfork.In the end, I think that this film works, and is definitely worth watching. As great as ""The Exorcist"" was, which for me is the definitive ""horror flick"", ""The Bad Seed"" is in many ways more chilling, perhaps because its story seems even that much more plausible than someone's being possessed by the devil. This film is, to a degree, definitely flawed. The dialog is a bit affected, and the character of Kenneth Penmark, played by William Hopper, is just too vapid. Moreover, the entire conversation among Christine, Monica, Richard Bravo (Christine's father) and Monica's brother appears completely ""planted"" and a bit awkward, though obviously serves some measure of establishment into Rhoda's character as well as foreshadowing. Even so, you will not forget this film. You might even parody some key lines throughout your life, as I have done. (""You're the prettiest mother"", ""Give me back those shoes, Leroy"", and ""Good Morning, Miss Fern"", while making a curtsy).Overall, I highly recommend this film, and it should be watched periodically over the years, because you'll always catch something new, and want to study each character's contributions and mannerisms, even though the film is clearly stolen by Patty McCormack, Eileen Heckart, and, most especially, Nancy Kelly.",4,"Though Flawed and Stagy, Still Chilling",1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,6820,"['saw', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'years', 'ago', 'circa', '1970', 'first',

Eileen Heckart is also a stand out in a small, but heartbreaking role as the mother of a child murdered by Rhoda. Henry Jones is appropriately creepy as Leroy, the janitor in Rhoda's apartment building, who teases Rhoda one time too much.

Rhoda's father's profession (and knowledge about Rhoda) and Leroy's background (he had a wife and family and was a much more disreputable character in the book) were also changed.  Christine and her husband were more ""eyes wide shut,"" than clueless in the book.

236327,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300270270,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 1]","Overwrought histrionics usually indicate a level of desperation with the material, but it is hard to resist the often over-the-top performances found in this sturdy, entertaining 1956 melodrama based on a Broadway hit by Maxwell Anderson two years earlier and a best seller by William March before that. Directed by Hollywood veteran Mervyn LeRoy and adapted by screenwriter John Lee Mahin, the movie's lofty credentials lend substance to the story's central notion of nature versus nurture when it comes to absolute evil, although the entire venture never feels like it left the stage.The subject is eight-year old Rhoda Penmark, the unctuous pigtailed daughter of Christine, a nervous mother whose own origins have remained a mystery. With her immaculate crinolines, Rhoda displays the smarmy etiquette of a trained android, plays abominable piano exercises and repeatedly asks her parents, ""What would you give me for a basketful of kisses?"" Something is amiss, however, when one of her classmates, Claude Daigle, turns up dead near a pier. A much sought-after penmanship medal calls to question Rhoda's role in the death, and then other deaths start to occur.LeRoy imported most of the Broadway cast for the movie, and apparently no one told them to tone it down for the cameras. The chief culprit is Nancy Kelly who plays Christine constantly wringing her hands, clutching her stomach and rolling her eyes in an otherwise escalating state of hysterics. By comparison, ten-year old Patty McCormack is almost subtle in showing Rhoda's malevolent culpability once you get past the artifice of her appearance. The supporting cast includes ham-fisted turns by Evelyn Varden as the irritatingly dense landlady upstairs, Henry Jones especially wild-eyed as slow-witted janitor LeRoy, and Eileen Heckart in the film's best performance as Claude's alcoholic mother Hortense. In her two brief but masterful scenes, she brings a palpable desperation to her character that taps into a deeper pain of personal loneliness and social exclusion.The film ends in a most contrived manner with a tacked-on curtain call by the cast that seems aptly ridiculous now.  The 2004 DVD provides a pristine print transfer that enhances the sharp black-and-white cinematography by longtime veteran Hal Rosson. Moreover, there is an eminently entertaining commentary track by McCormack (now about sixty) and cross-dressing actor/writer Charles Busch (""Die, Mommie, Die!""). Much of the information provided is repeated in a fifteen-minute featurette, ""Enfant Terrible: A Conversation with Patty McCormack"", and a making-of short and a vintage trailer complete the extras.",4,"Ham-Fisted Histrionics Surround One Mean Little Girl in a Spirited, Stagebound Melodrama",1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2645,"['Overwrought', 'histrionics', 'usually', 'indicate', 'level', 'desperation', 'material', 'hard', 'resist', 'often', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'found', 'sturdy', 'entertaining', '1956', 'melodrama', 'based', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'Maxwell', 'Anderson', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'best', 'seller', 'William', 'March', 'Directed', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'adapted', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Lee', 'Mahin', 'movie', 'lofty', 'credentials', 'lend', 'substance', 'story', 'central', 'notion', 'nature', 'versus', 'nurture', 'when', 'absolute', 'evil', 'entire', 'venture', 'never', 'left', 'stage.The', 'subject', 'eight-year', 'old', 'Rhoda', 'Penmark', 'unctuous', 'pigtailed', 'daughter', 'Christine', 'nervous', 'mother', 'own', 'origins', 'have', 'remained', 'mystery', 'immaculate', 'crinolines', 'Rhoda', 'smarmy', 'etiquette', 'trained', 'android', 'abominable', 'piano', 'exercises', 'repeatedly', 'parents', 'What', 'would', 'give', 'basketful', 'kisses', 'Something', 'amiss', 'however', 'when', 'one', 'classmates', 'Claude', 'Daigle', 'up', 'dead', 'pier', 'much', 'sought-after', 'penmanship', 'medal', 'question', 'Rhoda', 'role', 'death', 'then', 'other', 'deaths', 'start', 'occur.LeRoy', 'imported', 'most', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'movie', 'apparently', 'one', 'told', 'tone', 'down', 'cameras', 'chief', 'culprit', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'who', 'Christine', 'constantly', 'wringing', 'hands', 'clutching', 'stomach', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'otherwise', 'escalating', 'state', 'hysterics', 'comparison', 'ten-year', 'old', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'almost', 'subtle', 'showing', 'Rhoda', 'malevolent', 'culpability', 'once', 'get', 'artifice', 'appearance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'ham-fisted', 'turns', 'Evelyn', 'Varden', 'irritatingly', 'dense', 'landlady', 'upstairs', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'especially', 'wild-eyed', 'slow-witted', 'janitor', 'LeRoy', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'Claude', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Hortense', 'two', 'brief', 'masterful', 'scenes', 'palpable', 'desperation', 'character', 'deeper', 'pain', 'personal', 'loneliness', 'social', 'exclusion.The', 'film', 'most', 'contrived', 'manner', 'tacked-on', 'curtain', 'call', 'cast', 'aptly', 'ridiculous', 'now', '2004', 'DVD', 'pristine', 'print', 'transfer', 'sharp', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'longtime', 'veteran', 'Hal', 'Rosson', 'Moreover', 'eminently', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'track', 'McCormack', 'now', 'sixty', 'cross-dressing', 'actor/writer', 'Charles', 'Busch', 'Die', 'Mommie', 'Die', 'Much', 'information', 'provided', 'repeated', 'fifteen-minute', 'featurette', 'Enfant', 'Terrible', 'Conversation', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'making-of', 'short', 'vintage', 'trailer', 'complete', 'extras']",Bad Seed VHS

236335,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,6300270270,F. Gentile,"[3, 3]","This is a totally engrossing and horrifying film, that remains unique even today. Taken from the stage play, and starring many of the actors from their original stage roles, this movie of a child murderess with a heart of stone is scarier than almost any horror film. That is largely due to the performance of Patty McCormick as ""Rhoda"", who appears so icky-sweet & well mannered, but in actuality is Hell on roller-skates. Nancy Kelly is fantastic as her mother ""Christine"", who, as she learns the truth about her perfect little child, so effectively unravels before your eyes that you may need a valium. The fact that this pint-sized monster wreaks all this havoc and mayhem, without a murder actually being shown, says alot for the way a good movie is crafted. All the other actors are very convincing in their roles, the stand out being Eileen Heckert as ""Mrs. Daigle"", the mother of the ""drowned"" little boy, who deals with her inconsolable grief by staying drunk. I have never seen anyone so effectively portray a rip-roaring drunk, yet there is nothing comical about her performance, on the contrary, her pain is so real, it will break your heart. Eileen Heckert was one of my favorite character actresses, and I don't know if she received an Oscar for her portrayal here, but she should have. This movie also has several famous lines which, at least for film buffs, have entered our pop culture vocabulary. Many have accused this film of being too ""over the top"", too stagey, too Hollywoodized....blah..blah....Forget that! This is a great film that will so ""involve"" you, you may be a wreck afterwards. But isn't that the fun of movies??

236337,A1R6KGK8TRJAGV,6300270270,"Free Thinker ""Amazon made me remove my blog s...","[2, 3]","Imagine a person who looks like you and I....actually, they probably look better than you or I (well, at least me). They have the wit, charm, and personality to match their good looks.  By all appearances they are happy, well-adjusted and polite, perhaps even virtuous.But this person is different from the vast majority of humanity in one very significant way.  They have no conscience, none whatsoever.  That little voice inside that scolds us when we do wrong never troubles them.  They are incapable of grasping the concepts of right and wrong in any way.  Their only thoughts are of what they want and how they may obtain it as quickly and easily as possible.  They're not immoral so much as ammoral, in that they simply don't possess the ability to understand or appreciate ethical concepts.Furthermore, they lack empathy.  You and I feel bad when we watch the news and see stories of tragedies like 9/11.  They don't.  The suffering and misfortunes of others do not register in their minds whatsoever.  Completely self-centered, they walk among us, hurting and murdering with no more compunction about it than a cat may have about torturing and killing a mouse.This is an apt description of real people living in the world right now.  The psychological term for them is psychopath.  This film ably portrays such a person.  What makes it especially chilling is that this devil in human flesh is clothed in the skin of a pretty, polite, and ever so well mannered little girl.  Her parents are fine people, propserous and respectable.  She attends private school, is showered with presents and attention, and enjoys every advantage.But beneath her thin veneer of amiability she is a monster who kills at the slightest provocation while manipulating the adults around her with ease.  The only emotions she ever feels are envy, rage, and fear for her own well-being - no tenderness, no compassion, and absolutely, positively no love.This movie was made in 1956, but that fact in no way detracts from its appeal.  Patty McCormack did a brilliant job of playing the little hellspawn, Rhoda Penmark.  Rhoda wants things she can't have, like a crystal snowball.  Or a medal for penmanship won by another child.  Or a pet bird owned by the older woman who lives in the apartment above hers.A funny thing happens when Rhoda sets her eyes on such things: the original owners soon turn up dead, after which Rhoda acquires the object of her desire, explaining to the grownups around her that the deceased always wanted her to have it, in the event something unsavory ever happened to them.No doubt about it, Rhoda is a cold, calculating killer.  But after watching the film for a while I found myself starting to like her, simply because the adults around her are too stupid, weak-willed or cowardly to put a stop to her mischief.  At least she doesn't let such character faults prevent her from achieving her goals.Not that I'd want her for a daughter, of course.  I have no desire to wake up with a slit throat one night because my 8 year old just had to have that shiny new tie clip I got for Christmas.The only major fault with this movie - and it is a BIG one - is its cheesy, moralistic, easy-out ending.  It is reminiscent of tales told to wide-eyed children by dour old Sunday school teachers, about the evils of smoking, swearing and parking in cars with members of the opposite sex.  ""And just as Billy finished gulping down the liquid in that dark glass container, boys and girls, he saw the skull and crossbones label on it.  He knew then that, instead of swiping one of his dad's beers, he had actually stolen the bottle of rat poison his mother had bought the day before, and drank every deadly drop!""  ""OOOHHHH....""I learned from research, though, that the film's pathetic finale was forced on the producers by movie censors, who felt that its intended climax was simply too shocking for audiences of the day.  Something tells me I would have hated living in the 1950s.Nevertheless, the fine performances of Miss McCormick and the rest of the cast make this disturbing story well worth watching, even 51 years after its release.

Don't get me wrong, this is a 50s movie  with touches of 50s melodramatic flair and may seem over-scripted by today's standards.  The film sometimes reads more like a play.  But in spite of its flaws it retains its chilly essence and intriguing theme of child sociopath. Reminded me a little of a Twilight Zone episode I saw once (""Nightmare As A Child"") about a girl 'little Marky' who comes back to remind an older woman of some memory she'd been blocking out - except that the girl in that episode was not a killer.  Speaking of the Twilight Zone, this movie the Bad Seed really had touches of the early 60s in how far they were pushing the curtain of 'acceptable' at the time (1956).  The ending is hilarious.  This is how all movies should end - don't worry I won't tell you anything except that when it's over, each of the actors is personally introduced to the audience - and the final scene will surely have you laughing.The reason I bought this movie is because I played ""Reginald Tasker"" in a high school production of the play ""The Bad Seed"".

In this case, the movie itself didn't seem any better but the expressions on the faces of the actors seemed more expressive than they had on regular DVD.This film was first released in 1956. Little Patty McCormack and I are just about the same age. The Ad campaign was low key and asked the audience to &#34;please don't tell you friends anything about this picture&#34;, or words to that effect. As a child, I assumed there was something &#34;dirty&#34; anout the picture from the way it was being promoted.I didn't see THE BAD SEED until the advent of the VCR.The premise of Maxwell Anderson's play is straighforward. Are some people just &#34;Born Bad?&#34;.Mervyn Leroy attempts to &#34;open the play&#34; up in this film version. It is still very stage bound but it is still very engrossing. Young mother Christine Penmark (Nancy Kelly) worries that her daughter Rhoda is a little too mature for an eight year old child and suspects that something may be wrong. During a school picnic, a classmate of Rhoda's, Claude Daigle, is drowned under very suspicious circumstances and there are indications that Rhoda may have been somehow involved, a detail that no one wants to believe, at first. Christine finds one clue after another incriminating Rhoda and Christine begins to explore her own background to see if somehow Rhoda may have inherited some genetic trait that has set her on the road to murder. I'll stop here and let you watch this film play out for itself.Great acting performances abound in this film, many of the actors having appeared in this play on the New York Stage. Nancy Kelly as Christine received a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance. Some people feel that her performance is a little too over-the-top, but I disagree. Christine's agonizing descent into a near nervous breakdown is the glue that holds this play together. Equally good is Patty McCormack as Rhoda Penmark,a heartless child murderess. Patty earned an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress for one of the greatest performances by a child actress in Film History. Eileen Heckart is unforgettable as Hortense Daigle, the grieving alcoholic mother of the murdered boy, who suspects that all is not what it seems to be. She too was nominated for an Oscar as Best supporting Actress.In addition, Henry Jones plays &#34;Leroy&#34;, a sly dim-witted handyman who works at the apartment building where Christine and Rhoda live. There is something dangerous in Henry's performance which seems to suggest that he is a potential child molestor as he tries to match wits with Rhoda. Evelyn Varden is Monica Breedlove, the Penmark's well-intended buttinsky landlady. Jones and Varden deliver Oscar Caliber performances as well.

It is very unique, especially in the world of thrillers. In today's scary movies, you'll mostly just find blood and gore, but in this movie, while there IS murder and mayhem, you see nothing, but are tense and on the edge of your seat the whole time.Patty McCormack as Rhoda is the creepiest little girl ever. She goes around acting so sweet, but the expressions she gets on her face when no one can see it, except for the audience... wow. Most of the acting is over-the-top, it's true. But it works for this particular movie. Nancy Kelly as Rhoda's mom, for instance... she gets more and more hysterical as the movie progresses. But seriously, wouldn't you freak out - after attempting to deny it - if you just realized your only-8-year-old daughter had committed murder? Henry Jones as LeRoy, the handyman who comes across as some dumb servant but is the only one who sees Rhoda for her true self is delightful. My favorite performance, however, is Eileen Heckart as the victim's mother, continually getting drunk to drown her grief. Amazing. I think this is the only movie I own in which I am not really familiar with any of the actors, and yet so many of them impress me!Aunt Monica, however, annoys me. Even if Rhoda were a good child, what is up with all that spoiling? What kind of adult would she grow into, being taught that it's OK to flip out at your servant because he got a little water on your shoes? Geez.So I just read on here that they had to change the ending because of censorship. Too bad they had to, but I have always totally loved the ending of this movie. It just seemed so... appropriate. Like divine intervention. Especially with the convenient location where it took place!It's only too bad they couldn't get any actors other than Patty McCormack for the special features. 1956 movie, DVD almost 50 years later... I guess no one was left! I know Eileen Heckart was doing a recurring role on ""Ellen"" just a few years earlier.

This is Oscar-worthy in comparison.It's almost always a big risk when you have a child as the center of attention in a scrpt--particularly an evil child. The little girl in the remake was really terrible because she had a single level of performace. In comparison I thought Patty McCormack (who played the role on Broadway along with her ""Mother"" Nancy Kelly) was pretty darn good. I liked it when the little girl's rage & explosive behavior got the best of her & she displayed her carefully concealed aggressive & psychotic streak.There were other valid points made in the script: The girl's history of playing with matches (usually a boy thing), her inability to socialize with her peers, sadistic tendencies, extreme selfish & narcissistic behavior--and a need to control everyone & everything in her environment. Yes, she is a very bad little girl, but was this film (or the play version) mainly about the daughter--or was the center REALLY the Mother?There's a few observations about Nancy Kelly's portrayal of the loving mother I'd like to share. Number one, her awful hairdo. There's a feeling of constriction about it--with one rather sinister looking forelock hanging right at the center. It's like she's tried so hard to unconciously surpress her dark side, that it sneaks out in her coiffure. It reminded me of the Satanic Nanny in THE OMEN. Then to support this theory--when you see the film--watch the way Kelly engages in self-injurious behavior whenever she gets frustrated. She starts hitting either herself or the furniture. In the original script (and original ending) the Mother's role at the center makes sense. I mean in the future who's more dangerous, a little girl discovered to be a monster, or a mother who pretends even to herself that she'e not one too? After all, this appears to be (a genetic) family affair.I think this script was poorly adapted from the play--and the direction not much better. It's all very box set stagey with too little use of the exteriors/outdoors. The characters are stock types. The interaction between the Grandfather & an edlderly crime story buff is just embarrassing with it's feeble dialogue & acting--and, good god, how many drinks does the Grandfather need? His daughter keeps shoving drinks down him like he just walked in from the Sahra Desert.Obviously time was of the essence in going from Broadway to the Silver Screen.

The family at first comes across as very 50s, which of course they are, but which sometimes doesn't age well for modern audiences. But as time passes and the stress gets to the mother, she becomes more and more real. And poor Mrs. Daigle! The drunken mother of one of the first murder victims! She is worth the price of admission alone. She's hilarious and heartbreaking in the same breath. The little girl is just great. This also comes down to the writing, I think. She's princess-perfect, but you start to see the cracks show when she keeps being princess-perfect and adorable in exactly the wrong situations. It is much more chilling than I expected.2. The darkness. I always expect old black and white movies to be sort of tame and bland in some ways, and I think this is because most of my experience comes from the ""classics"" on network TV as a kid. Because this movie has one of the harshest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. There's not a drop of blood, but there is a scene late in the movie where we essentially watch a murder take place over the course of a few minutes, and I couldn't believe they'd gone there.

A sweet little girl is really a cold blooded killer and has a line and excuse for every occasion. The story begins with an off-screen drowning of a classmate at at a school picnic. You see the little boy was awarded a 'writing medal' for best penmenship. The little girl wanted the medal and thought she deserved to have it. So she winds up with the medal.She later burns up a janitor in his basement, and drives her mother to poisening herself. Such is the life of a military family. The father is on the movie at the beginning and the end. He's an Air Force officer who is completely lost as to what is going on.Some say the acting is bad, but I wholeheartedly disagree. The alcoholic manic depressive mother of the drowned boy should have won an award. You can feel her pain and misery, and you'll stay on the edge of your seat as she tries to piece together the happenings at the picnic.But the little girl steals the show. She gets her just deserts in the end, even though it's a bit far fetched. Getting struck by lightning?However this film was meant to have a serious side. It's another take on the old ""Heredity VS Environment"" argument. The little girl had a loving mother and a wonderful little life, but she is adopted and we learn who her father really was.....In the tradition of fine old movies with shock value.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[1, 1]","Patty McCormack won a nomination as Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Rhoda Penmark, the eight-year-old socio-pathic serial killer in the 1956 film, ""The Bad Seed."" The film shocked audiences then and still has an equal capacity to shock now.In fact, the last eight reviews of the film were written in the last ten months, indicating the continued popularity of this controversial film. It raises the question: What causes killers--heredity or environment? Few would disagree with the influence of environment as a catalyst for the incubation of murderers. Horrible living conditions, brutal parents, absorbed violence from television and video games, neglect, the list goes on. But heredity? Does a murderer pass on murder genes?Such is the gist of ""The Bad Seed."" The film is what some would call a ""talking"" movie, i.e. much of the background and foreshadowing are established through dialog. Basically, the plot reveals a happy family with kind and loving parents, Ken and Christine Penmark and a perfect little girl, Rhoda, who prefers dresses to jeans. Early on the viewer learns that Rhoda has crescent-shaped taps on her shoes to prevent the heels from wearing down. And the most important thing is that Rhoda did not win the coveted penmanship medal, which she most emphatically wanted!I have seen this movie many times, but did not notice until this last viewing that Christine has been concerned about Rhoda a long time now. In fact, she and her husband think Rhoda too grown-up for her age and want her to be a little girl. Christine also worries that she herself is a changeling and that her father is not her father. But enough background.Every detail, every sentence uttered is an important piece of information in the unraveling of the plot, in reaching that final scene. I've always considered the movie's ending perfect because it settles everything. As for that spanking, it's just a fun addendum to the introduction of the cast and not part of the plot. It becomes an ""if this, then not that"" scenario, but definitely not part of the movie.An intriguing aspect of the story is the addition of the slightly mentally challenged LeRoy, the handyman who has free run of the property. It's as if his intellectual lessening heightens and intensifies his ability to read people, as he shows in several scenes. And of course, he knows Rhoda, but not well enough.The premise of nature vs nurture is not the only controversial topic of the film. However, mention of two other equally explosive subjects would be a spoiler. Suffice it to say, viewers will want to plan time for a good discussion afterward.Note: What ever happened to Patty McCormack? She went on to have a film, television, and film career, but not one of importance. However, her latest role is Pat Nixon in ""Frost/Nixon.""",5,The bad seed--how will it grow?,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,2820,"['Patty', 'McCormack', 'won', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Supporting', 'Role', 'portrayal', 'Rhoda', 'Penmark', 'eight-year-old', 'socio-pathic', 'serial', 'killer', '1956', 'film', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'film', 'shocked', 'audiences', 'then', 'still', 'equal', 'capacity', 'shock', 'now.In', 'fact', 'last', 'eight', 'reviews', 'film', 'were', 'written', 'last', 'ten', 'months', 'indicating', 'continued', 'popularity', 'controversial', 'film', 'question', 'What', 'killers', 'heredity', 'environment', 'Few', 'would', 'disagree', 'influence', 'environment', 'catalyst', 'incubation', 'murderers', 'Horrible', 'living', 'conditions', 'brutal', 'parents', 'absorbed', 'violence', 'television', 'video', 'games', 'neglect', 'list', 'heredity', 'murderer', 'pass', 'murder', 'genes', 'Such', 'gist', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'film', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'talking', 'movie', 'i.e', 'much', 'background', 'foreshadowing', 'are', 'established', 'dialog', 'Basically', 'plot', 'happy', 'family', 'kind', 'loving', 'parents', 'Ken', 'Christine', 'Penmark', 'perfect', 'little', 'girl', 'Rhoda', 'who', 'dresses', 'jeans', 'Early', 'viewer', 'Rhoda', 'crescent-shaped', 'taps', 'shoes', 'prevent', 'heels', 'wearing', 'down', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'Rhoda', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'coveted', 'penmanship', 'medal', 'most', 'emphatically', 'wanted', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'last', 'viewing', 'Christine', 'been', 'concerned', 'Rhoda', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'fact', 'husband', 'think', 'Rhoda', 'too', 'grown-up', 'age', 'want', 'be', 'little', 'girl', 'Christine', 'also', 'changeling', 'father', 'not', 'father', 'enough', 'background.Every', 'detail', 'sentence', 'uttered', 'important', 'piece', 'information', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'reaching', 'final', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'always', 'considered', 'movie', 'ending', 'perfect', 'everything', 'spanking', 'just', 'fun', 'addendum', 'introduction', 'cast', 'not', 'part', 'plot', 'then', 'not', 'scenario', 'definitely', 'not', 'part', 'movie.An', 'intriguing', 'aspect', 'story', 'addition', 'slightly', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'LeRoy', 'handyman', 'who', 'free', 'run', 'property', 'intellectual', 'lessening', 'heightens', 'intensifies', 'ability', 'read', 'people', 'several', 'scenes', 'course', 'Rhoda', 'not', 'well', 'enough.The', 'premise', 'nature', 'vs', 'nurture', 'not', 'only', 'controversial', 'topic', 'film', 'However', 'mention', 'two', 'other', 'equally', 'explosive', 'subjects', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'Suffice', 'say', 'viewers', 'will', 'want', 'plan', 'time', 'good', 'discussion', 'afterward.Note', 'What', 'ever', 'happened', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'went', 'have', 'film', 'television', 'film', 'career', 'not', 'one', 'importance', 'However', 'latest', 'role', 'Pat', 'Nixon', 'Frost/Nixon']",Bad Seed VHS

It leaves a chill running down your spine and stays with you long after you have watched it.  The acting may have been a little too much (and scenes ""laughable"" and ""unbelievable"" as other ""critics"" put it) but we're talking about a movie that was made in the 1950's.  There were no special affects, computer animation and the such back then so producers had to work with what was available.  And in my opinion they did a good job.  I liked how you still got a chill just from the descriptions and dialogue.  There was no need for a scene or blood and gore (unlike today's horror movie where it seems the more blood and guts in the scene = the best horror movie ever.....as unrealistic as they all are).  That's my favorite part of the movie because I'm not a big fan of violence in movies and most of them today turn my stomach when I watch them.

It's also worth noting that the DVD was presented in a standard version, while the Blu-ray is in widescreen 1:85:1.  This might seem to be an improvement, but all indications are that the picture area has simply been enlarged to fill the screen. Many scenes seem rather awkwardly framed, with the actors' heads almost cut off at the top.  Sad to say it, but I think this was a low-budget rush job to get the disc out in time for Halloween.

236370,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6300270270,Kevin Killian,"[3, 4]","If you watch THE BAD SEED with a sympathetic eye, you can see why, out of all actresses (and indeed actors) in the world, Greta Garbo picked Nancy Kelly to represent her when she was awarded the lifetime achievement Oscar and, too reclusive to appear in person, she was asked to name a modern substitute who would accept it for her at the Shrine Auditorium.  And in a way, if Nancy Kelly's acting seems stagey and dated today, I've been in theaters where Garbo's mannerisms have also elicited shrieks of laughter and howls of amusement from modern audiences.THE BAD SEED seems directed not as a movie at all, but as a play, by Mervyn LeRoy, the most up and down of classic Hollywood directors.  With LeRoy you never knew what you were getting into.  Sometimes he buckles down for business, at other times he seems to have been asleep at the wheel during the shoot.  In THE BAD SEED he lets his stars go to town, and they truly raise eyebrows today with their unadulterated ham.  Nancy Kelly is not the worst offender.  Patty McCormack is so evil, she telegraphs it a mile away.  No shadings here.  And what about Eileen Heckart as the drunk mother of little Rhoda's unfortunate playmate?  As Hortense Daigle, she turns in a performance as grotesque as her name.  It's like every drunk scene in every other movie, combined.  However, none of these ""flaws"" detracts one bit from the power of the film nor its fascination as a document of horror.  Watching THE BAD SEED reminds us of how little, when you get down to it, nurturing counts; apparently it's all in genetics.  This movie must have frightened millions of people away from adoption, that's for sure: (As well as shrinking the number of people who wanted to name their little girls ""Rhoda"" after this one.)  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but as Christine Penmark comes to realize, there was a broken link in the chain of DNA and that broken link was herself!  She stands up and tries to bear the burden of that tragic knowledge, and soon, we realize, the turmoil inside is unbearable for her.We saw THE BAD SEED a few years back, with Patty McCormack in attendance.  She commented on the film and how it took its toll on her, not only on her career (for she found it hard to get other parts after being typecast as Rhoda Penmark), but on her mental health as a little girl, having done this play every day for years, then having to make the film version.  Did you know that Orson Welles was impressed by her and cast her in his never-released film of DON QUIXOTE?  McCormack is now a grown, beautiful woman.  Sharp eyed viewers have spotted her as poor Adriana's mother in re-runs of THE SOPRANOS.",4,A Medal For Rhoda,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,2664,"['watch', 'BAD', 'SEED', 'sympathetic', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'actresses', 'indeed', 'actors', 'world', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'picked', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'represent', 'when', 'was', 'awarded', 'lifetime', 'achievement', 'Oscar', 'too', 'reclusive', 'appear', 'person', 'was', 'asked', 'name', 'modern', 'substitute', 'who', 'would', 'accept', 'Shrine', 'Auditorium', 'way', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'acting', 'stagey', 'dated', 'today', ""'ve"", 'been', 'theaters', 'where', 'Garbo', 'mannerisms', 'have', 'also', 'elicited', 'shrieks', 'laughter', 'howls', 'amusement', 'modern', 'audiences.THE', 'BAD', 'SEED', 'directed', 'not', 'movie', 'play', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'most', 'up', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'LeRoy', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'Sometimes', 'down', 'business', 'other', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'shoot', 'THE', 'BAD', 'SEED', 'stars', 'go', 'town', 'truly', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'today', 'unadulterated', 'ham', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'not', 'worst', 'offender', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'so', 'evil', 'telegraphs', 'mile', 'away', 'No', 'shadings', 'here', 'what', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'drunk', 'mother', 'little', 'Rhoda', 'unfortunate', 'playmate', 'Hortense', 'Daigle', 'performance', 'as', 'grotesque', 'name', 'drunk', 'scene', 'other', 'movie', 'combined', 'However', 'none', 'flaws', 'one', 'bit', 'power', 'film', 'fascination', 'document', 'horror', 'Watching', 'BAD', 'SEED', 'how', 'little', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'nurturing', 'counts', 'apparently', 'genetics', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'frightened', 'millions', 'people', 'away', 'adoption', 'sure', 'As', 'well', 'shrinking', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'wanted', 'name', 'little', 'girls', 'Rhoda', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'Christine', 'Penmark', 'realize', 'was', 'broken', 'link', 'chain', 'DNA', 'broken', 'link', 'was', 'up', 'tries', 'bear', 'burden', 'tragic', 'knowledge', 'soon', 'realize', 'turmoil', 'inside', 'unbearable', 'her.We', 'saw', 'THE', 'BAD', 'SEED', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'attendance', 'commented', 'film', 'how', 'took', 'toll', 'not', 'only', 'career', 'found', 'hard', 'get', 'other', 'parts', 'being', 'typecast', 'Rhoda', 'Penmark', 'mental', 'health', 'little', 'girl', 'having', 'done', 'play', 'day', 'years', 'then', 'having', 'make', 'film', 'version', 'Did', 'know', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'was', 'impressed', 'cast', 'never-released', 'film', 'DON', 'QUIXOTE', 'McCormack', 'now', 'grown', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Sharp', 'eyed', 'viewers', 'have', 'spotted', 'poor', 'Adriana', 'mother', 're-runs', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS']",Bad Seed VHS

The cast came direct from the Broadway show and were comfortable in their roles.  Nancy Kelly goes from contented housewife to hysterical lunatic and is believable all the way.  Patty McCormack is perfect as the angelic little devil in crinolines and braids.  She's tough and gutsy and holds her own with the adults, especially Henry Jones, the handy man, who is really creepy and terrific.While the actors are all great, the director chose to make a filmed play and it doesn't always work. The actors politely take turns speaking and then shout their lines as if trying to reach the top balcony; there's no overlap or hesitation in speaking, everything sounds too rehearsed.  The action is mostly confined to a living room set where the actors do a LOT of talking with little action; they stand still and stare at whoever is speaking; this probably worked a lot better on stage.The Extras include film commentary and a memories short with Patty McCormack and these are great fun.

On Broadway, of course, the original ending was left as Maxwell Anderson wrote it, but in the movie version, with the censors (who decreed that all evil must be punished) breathing down every one's neck in Hollywood in the 1950's, the original Broadway ending would have been virtually impossible to present to an audience.  So ---- with a drastically changed ending, the film loses some of it's punch.  That said, the film is still involving and a lot of fun to watch.  I doubt whether any child actor ever undertook a role which conveyed as much pure and unvarnished evil (not even Linda Blair in ""The Excorist"") as does Patty McCormick does here.  She performed the role in the original stage play, and was obviously the only choice possible for the film.  Nancy Kelly was an extremely competent actress, but films were not her millieu.  Subsequently,  she acts as though we all were sitting in the second balcony of the theatre -------- great for the theatre, but way over the top in a film, where such emotions need to be smaller scaled and underplayed before a camera, which is like a magnifying glass.  The supporting cast, all from the original play, are absolutely ""on target"".  What a shame that this film was made at a time when  censorship was all pervasive.

Rhoda is raised in an affluent home, loving parents, sucessful father, but all this isn't enough to overcome her manic personality.  Never before has a child been portrayed in such a twisted manner, but many have since.  I don't include Veda (Mildred Pierce) in the same catagory, as Veda's character is several years older than Rhonda, almost a woman.  Veda does display similar traits to Rhonda growing up, selfish, manuliputive, but she doesn't quite fall into the same level of amorality as Rhonda.  Veda still has some conscience about her actions.  Some reviewers have felt that some of the acting was ""over the top"", which may be true. However, the story still draws you in and you do feel Nancy Kelly's pain at her decision to stop Rhoda before its too late.

This chiller about the ""perfect"" Rhoda Penmark with her long blonde braids and cold, cold heart stars most of the play's cast---Patty McCormack as Rhoda, Nancy Kelly as her mother, Henry Jones as Leroy the apartment handyman and Eileen Heckart as the mother of one of Rhoda's schoolmates. While her pilot husband is away, Mrs.Penmark begins to suspect there's something wrong with her perfect little girl. You bet there is, she's a cold-blooded killer! As Rhoda's list of victims grows, so does her mother's terror as she begins piecing together the clues and facts. The film, shot in stark black & white, appears stagy but this works fine because it's all about the performances. They're brilliant. Mervyn LeRoy allows the characters to remain like they were on stage for maximum impact. The only complaint, Hollywood tacked on a dumb second ending to allow the characters their bows and to say ""See? This was only a movie!"" because in 1956 the subject matter (and original climax and ending) was quite shocking.

Just about everyone remains blissfully ignorant, falling for Rhoda's sugar-sweet act, never suspecting that she could ever be capable of such a thing. But since Rhoda is not a seasoned criminal and has the naivete of a little girl regarding certain matters, she inadvertently slips up just a bit here and there - nothing blatant as being caught red-handed - and Mom has to deal with the slow realization that her daughter is not what she seems.Overall, the movie was well-paced, with believable acting. One treat was the scene where Mom absolutely freaks out after finding out who her real mother was, and realizing that it is why Rhoda acts the way she does.

It's a shame MST 3K didn't do a send up of this one before the show went off the air.  In case you don't know, the plot centers on a woman who must decide  what to do when she finds out that her lovable little adopted daughter is a  murderer.  Although the play on which the film was based was heavily  deterministic in its philosophy and included an essay at the beginning  defending its views (that criminal tendencies are inborn), the film version  almost plays like a parody of determinism.  I also think that perhaps Patty  McCormack (who was, incidentally, along with Nancy Kelly and Eileen  Heckart, nominated for Academy Awards) was getting a bit too old for the  role as well, which adds a bit to the unintentional humor.  It's one of  those films that, although the subject matter is intended to be dead  serious (in 1956, Warners only allowed Adults into the theaters to see it),  you'd be hard pressed not to chuckle at some of the scenes (especially a  scene where Nancy Kelly and Evelyn Varden are arguing, while Patty  McCormack continues playing the same chords over and over on  a piano  faster and faster . . it ends with Kelly giving in and bursting into tears,  pounding her fist on the table to the rhythm of McCormack's playing).  I  can't watch Kelly's performance as the highly strung mother without  imagining that Carol Burnett must have at some point done a parody of this  film on her show (for me it's reminiscent of her soap opera parody &quot;As  the Stomach Turns&quot;).  It's also interesting to me that the janitor's  name is pronounced, &quot;le-ROY&quot; not &quot;LEE-roy&quot; - maybe a  subtle joke on the director's last name (?)

236412,A3DYIGOLWS5CNS,6300270270,Niel Rishoi,"[1, 1]","This movie is definitely a time-capsule, 1950s artifact. It is resolutely 50s in every way. The concept of ""inherited evil"" sounds exactly like the kind of indoor-sport-pseudo-Freudian- 50s-styled-psychology. It is an intriguing idea: whenever one reads histories of serial killers, most notably such as Jeffrey Dahmer, we subsequently learn of their rather cold-hearted personas that seemed to have existed from childhood, where reports of isolation from other children, obsession with fire and torture of harmless animals is commonplace.The Bad Seed's Rhoda Penmark seems like a monster grown-up in a child's body, all the mature craftiness and instinct for knowing human weaknesses. The lack of compassion is believable, but her nerve in proceeding with the killings seems a bit far-fetched.Nevertheless, as a theoretical exercise, and as a drama, the premise is fascinating, as is the time and setting. It's entertaining because its overwrought themes and presentation seem so removed from today, and also because it has a fascinatingly morbid appeal. The concept of a child being greedy is an entirely believable premise; the fact in this case that she'll kill for her greed is a tantalizing prospect.Patty McCormack as the child from hell is quite amazing. Both the director of the play and the film got a performance out of the young actress that is quite a feat in itself; one can teach a child to do many things, but to have a young girl plausibly present the personification of evil is an altogether extraordinary circumstance. Watch McCormack in particular in several scenes when the adults hug her; the grimaces and disgust for sentimental emotions are a lot more chilling than Rhoda's baleful, angry threats (which are riveting in themselves). It's fun to watch Rhoda toy with the emotions of the adults, and the mixed reactions that ensue; she's a deranged version of the Kay Thompson creation Eloise.Rhoda seems exactly like a creation that Rod Serling (creator of the Twilight Zone) might have made up; his stories were often theoretical exercises, offering the kind of ""what-if"" scenarios that were deliberately farfetched but wholly intriguing.And yet, at other times this movie seems like a black comedy; some of the dialogue is preposterously over-the-top, like vintage comic books. Yet it holds you.Of the other performances, Nancy Kelly as Rhoda's mother is the standout. She is effective at portraying her agonizing, increasing realizations, and her despair, guilt and sorrow are very touching. Henry Jones as Leroy is a comic masterpiece of sneeringly gleeful pleasure. Eileen Heckart was evidently a high prized actress, but her role gets tiresome in short order; the script calls for the character to be a stereotypical, messy drunk begging for sympathy, and her scenes go on forever.Entertaining stuff.",4,Twilight Zone-creepy story,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,2829,"['movie', 'definitely', 'time-capsule', '1950s', 'artifact', 'resolutely', '50s', 'way', 'concept', 'inherited', 'evil', 'exactly', 'kind', 'indoor-sport-pseudo-Freudian-', '50s-styled-psychology', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'one', 'histories', 'serial', 'killers', 'most', 'notably', 'such', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'subsequently', 'learn', 'rather', 'cold-hearted', 'personas', 'seemed', 'have', 'existed', 'childhood', 'where', 'reports', 'isolation', 'other', 'children', 'obsession', 'fire', 'torture', 'harmless', 'animals', 'commonplace.The', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'Rhoda', 'Penmark', 'monster', 'grown-up', 'child', 'body', 'mature', 'craftiness', 'instinct', 'knowing', 'human', 'weaknesses', 'lack', 'compassion', 'believable', 'nerve', 'proceeding', 'killings', 'bit', 'far-fetched.Nevertheless', 'theoretical', 'exercise', 'drama', 'premise', 'fascinating', 'time', 'setting', 'entertaining', 'overwrought', 'themes', 'presentation', 'seem', 'so', 'removed', 'today', 'also', 'fascinatingly', 'morbid', 'appeal', 'concept', 'child', 'being', 'greedy', 'entirely', 'believable', 'premise', 'fact', 'case', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'greed', 'tantalizing', 'prospect.Patty', 'McCormack', 'child', 'hell', 'quite', 'amazing', 'director', 'play', 'film', 'got', 'performance', 'young', 'actress', 'quite', 'feat', 'one', 'can', 'teach', 'child', 'do', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'young', 'girl', 'plausibly', 'present', 'personification', 'evil', 'altogether', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'Watch', 'McCormack', 'particular', 'several', 'scenes', 'when', 'adults', 'hug', 'grimaces', 'disgust', 'sentimental', 'emotions', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'chilling', 'Rhoda', 'baleful', 'angry', 'threats', 'are', 'riveting', 'fun', 'watch', 'Rhoda', 'toy', 'emotions', 'adults', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'ensue', 'deranged', 'version', 'Kay', 'Thompson', 'creation', 'Eloise.Rhoda', 'exactly', 'creation', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'creator', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'stories', 'were', 'often', 'theoretical', 'exercises', 'offering', 'kind', 'what-if', 'scenarios', 'were', 'deliberately', 'farfetched', 'wholly', 'intriguing.And', 'yet', 'other', 'times', 'movie', 'black', 'comedy', 'dialogue', 'preposterously', 'over-the-top', 'vintage', 'comic', 'books', 'you.Of', 'other', 'performances', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'Rhoda', 'mother', 'standout', 'effective', 'portraying', 'agonizing', 'increasing', 'realizations', 'despair', 'guilt', 'sorrow', 'are', 'very', 'touching', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'Leroy', 'comic', 'masterpiece', 'sneeringly', 'gleeful', 'pleasure', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'was', 'evidently', 'high', 'prized', 'actress', 'role', 'tiresome', 'short', 'order', 'script', 'character', 'be', 'stereotypical', 'messy', 'drunk', 'begging', 'sympathy', 'scenes', 'go', 'forever.Entertaining', 'stuff']",Bad Seed VHS

The film is stagy and way overlong but it is compelling nonetheless and you won't easily forget it. Many of the actors from the play were chosen for the film version, an unusual decision but one of economics at the time. It didn't really matter as the entire cast is quite excellent. Nancy Kelly plays the distraught mother in a highly overwrought performance that borders on high camp at times. Evelyn Varden plays the landlady who can see no wrong in little Rhoda. Eileen Heckart is very memorable in two brief scenes as a drunken mother grieving over her dead son (a victim of you-know-who). Henry Jones plays LeRoy, the janitor/gardener who can't resist picking on little Rhoda. And as Rhoda Penmark, the little monster is played to perfection by Patty McCormack. I swear if you ever come across a little girl with blonde pigtails, you'll probably start looking for the nearest exit!The film transfer looks outstanding on dvd - the sharp black and white photography is a stand-out and the film received an Oscar nomination for cinematography. Also nominated in the acting categories were Nancy Kelly, Patty McCormack and Eileen Heckart. Although none of them won the award (Kelly lost the Best Actress Award to Ingrid Bergman and Heckert and McCormack lost the Best Supporting Award to Dorothy Malone), they were certainly deserving of their nominations.A commentary done by Charles Busch and Patty McCormack is pretty entertaining, aside from a few slow spots, and Busch asks McCormack questions relating to the making of the film and the play as well as working with the actors. McCormack also appears in a 15 minute interview.

An early '90s Broadway play, ""Ruthless! The Musical,"" which starred Britney Spears, was a direct parody of ""The Bad Seed""; Nick Cave named his band ""The Bad Seeds"" after it, and I think I even caught a parody-nod to ""The Bad Seed"" in an episode of ""South Park"" the other day.  In fact, little Rhoda Penmark, with her saccharine grins and gag-me-with-a-Sunday-school-prize curtsies, might also be a parody of sorts: a very pointed and devastating one directed at 1950s Leave-it-to-Beaver ideals.With a tiny budget and a cast mostly composed of actors from the Broadway play, director Mervyn LeRoy bottled this explosive film inside a small if tasteful family apartment and turned mother (Nancy Kelly) and daughter (Patty McCormack) loose to seethe, steam-boiler like, within the four walls.  The father (William Hopper) is predictably benign and clueless, not to mention forever absent on a lengthy business trip, the purpose of which is never explained.Don't be deterred by the tendency of websites and video stores to sweep this film into the ""Horror"" category; while ""The Bad Seed"" may be partly responsible for spawning the mini-genre of child axe-murderer movies, ""The Bad Seed"" itself is actually straight drama, with a plot no less improbable than that of most mainstream pictures of its era.  Kelly delivers the screen performance of her career--and it is mesmerizing, although it clearly belongs to the antique era of high-glamour and gilded studio powerhouses.  Eileen Heckart more than deservedly took the Golden Globe for her turn as Mrs. Daigle; I think she should have won the Oscar.As much as any movie made during the Eisenhower era, ""The Bad Seed"" takes the domestic paradigms of that era and stands them on their heads.  Nothing is what it seems, and assumption upon assumption is shattered as the cherished homefront approaches the point of total collapse.  In this way, the movie is both a nice piece of fifties kitch and a harbinger of the chaos of the sixties.  There's also some not-so-subtle symbolism creeping around in the little apartment--for example, practically every scene depicts some sort of cross-shaped object in the background, or the cross of shadows from a window pane.An important movie, a must for serious film buffs.",5,A Basket of Praise for a Classic Cult Spectacular,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,2409,"['cult', 'favorite', 'essential', 'only', 'so', 'often', 'spoofed', 'miss', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'miss', 'key', 'undercurrents', 'popular', 'culture', 'early', 'Broadway', 'play', 'Ruthless', 'Musical', 'starred', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'was', 'direct', 'parody', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'named', 'band', 'Bad', 'Seeds', 'think', 'even', 'caught', 'parody-nod', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'episode', 'South', 'Park', 'other', 'day', 'fact', 'little', 'Rhoda', 'Penmark', 'saccharine', 'grins', 'gag-me-with-a-Sunday-school-prize', 'curtsies', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'parody', 'sorts', 'very', 'pointed', 'devastating', 'one', 'directed', '1950s', 'Leave-it-to-Beaver', 'ideals.With', 'tiny', 'budget', 'cast', 'mostly', 'composed', 'actors', 'Broadway', 'play', 'director', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'bottled', 'explosive', 'film', 'small', 'tasteful', 'family', 'apartment', 'turned', 'mother', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'daughter', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'loose', 'seethe', 'steam-boiler', 'four', 'walls', 'father', 'William', 'Hopper', 'predictably', 'benign', 'clueless', 'not', 'mention', 'forever', 'absent', 'lengthy', 'business', 'trip', 'purpose', 'never', 'explained.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'deterred', 'tendency', 'websites', 'video', 'stores', 'sweep', 'film', 'Horror', 'category', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'may', 'be', 'partly', 'responsible', 'spawning', 'mini-genre', 'child', 'axe-murderer', 'movies', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'actually', 'straight', 'drama', 'plot', 'less', 'improbable', 'most', 'mainstream', 'pictures', 'era', 'Kelly', 'screen', 'performance', 'career', 'mesmerizing', 'clearly', 'antique', 'era', 'high-glamour', 'gilded', 'studio', 'powerhouses', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'more', 'deservedly', 'took', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'turn', 'Mrs.', 'Daigle', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar.As', 'much', 'movie', 'made', 'Eisenhower', 'era', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'domestic', 'paradigms', 'era', 'heads', 'Nothing', 'what', 'assumption', 'assumption', 'shattered', 'cherished', 'homefront', 'point', 'total', 'collapse', 'way', 'movie', 'nice', 'piece', 'fifties', 'kitch', 'harbinger', 'chaos', 'sixties', 'also', 'not-so-subtle', 'symbolism', 'creeping', 'around', 'little', 'apartment', 'example', 'practically', 'scene', 'sort', 'cross-shaped', 'object', 'background', 'cross', 'shadows', 'window', 'pane.An', 'important', 'movie', 'must', 'serious', 'film', 'buffs']",Bad Seed VHS

Now the story itself was very unusual and the ending was something else. If you are a fan of only action movies, you will be disappointed as this is a drama and they used the actors from Broadway for the most part to play their own roles, which means the acting style is a lot different from the normal movie roles, such as more facial and body expressions with their hands and turning their backs to the cameras. As for the cameras, they only used three different angles, with none of those horrible shots where the actors stay still and the camera goes round and round to make one dizzy. The mother, when she has her nervous breakdown, reminded me  of a certain V.P. a few years ago, that was running for president and he, thank God, lost. He was ranting and raving all over Washington D.C. blaming his ex-boss (the president) for costing him the election.  The movie is just over two hours long, but it didn't  really drag on as they kept your attention even without real action scenes. No gore at all, and the murders by Rhoda were not shown.  Sadly, this is in b/w and the DVD was made about 10 years ago.  This is not the type of movie that I would watch very often, and not with children, as they would be bored with it and they just might get ideas of taking matters into their own hands when somebody gets in their way, as this happened a few years ago, when a nine-year old boy killed another, just because he wanted his jacket and thought that it should be his; he had no remorse at all, just as Rhoda in this movie.  The ending was a little bit not real with the mother's suicide, but they wanted to tie up a few loose ends and they hoped these scenes would be believable, and as our family went through this same problem two Christmasses ago, sadly with a horrible ending, I didn't buy into it; but, after all, this is the movies and not real life.  +JMJ+",5,Don't trust little girls with long braids,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2044,"['First-', 'quality', 'DVD', 'great', 'sound', 'visual', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'commentary', 'interview', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'what', 'actress', 'age', 'Now', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'unusual', 'ending', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'are', 'fan', 'only', 'action', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'drama', 'used', 'actors', 'Broadway', 'most', 'part', 'play', 'own', 'roles', 'acting', 'style', 'lot', 'different', 'normal', 'movie', 'roles', 'such', 'more', 'facial', 'body', 'expressions', 'hands', 'turning', 'backs', 'cameras', 'cameras', 'only', 'used', 'three', 'different', 'angles', 'none', 'horrible', 'shots', 'where', 'actors', 'stay', 'still', 'camera', 'round', 'round', 'make', 'one', 'dizzy', 'mother', 'when', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'reminded', 'certain', 'V.P', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'running', 'president', 'thank', 'God', 'lost', 'was', 'ranting', 'raving', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'blaming', 'ex-boss', 'president', 'costing', 'election', 'movie', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'drag', 'kept', 'attention', 'even', 'real', 'action', 'scenes', 'gore', 'murders', 'Rhoda', 'were', 'not', 'shown', 'Sadly', 'b/w', 'DVD', 'was', 'made', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'very', 'often', 'not', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'ideas', 'taking', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'when', 'somebody', 'way', 'happened', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'nine-year', 'old', 'boy', 'killed', 'just', 'wanted', 'jacket', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'had', 'remorse', 'just', 'Rhoda', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'not', 'real', 'mother', 'suicide', 'wanted', 'tie', 'up', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'hoped', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'believable', 'family', 'went', 'same', 'problem', 'two', 'Christmasses', 'ago', 'sadly', 'horrible', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movies', 'not', 'real', 'life', '+JMJ+']",Bad Seed VHS

236428,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6300270270,Randy Keehn,"[5, 6]","I saw ""The Bad Seed"" when I was a kid.  I was fascinated with the evil young girl and the whole concept of the movie.  It was about as scary a movie as I can remember seeing as a youth and it gives me those same chills everytime I've seen it since.  The absence of any sense of guilt or remorse, the syrupy way she sucks up to the adults who can give her what she wants, the plotting mind that sorts out how to cover her tracks; all these traits in an elementary school-aged girl!  Patty McCormack gives an outstanding performance in a role you might have trouble forgiving her for.There is actually a story behind all of this evil.  There is a mother whose husband is off in the services.  She begins to doubt her daughter's virtue after a classmate dies on a school outing.  As her doubts grow, she is able to discover from her father that he is in fact not her father.  In finding out the truth of her past, the mother becomes convinced that she has passed a sort of genetic evil to her daughter.  This is actually a interesting subject; is evil a part of our DNA?  (I modernized the question a bit).  The mother's conclusion is essential to how she deals with her daughter's guilt.Movies have pushed the envelope a lot since ""The Bad Seed"" came out yet it remains a classic in its' genre.  There isn't much in the way of special effects in this movie.  After all, it was a stage play brought to the screen.  Nonetheless, the way in which this evil young creature exists without any sense of a conscience is so totally frightening that we don't need elaborate monsters.  The monstrosity is not visual, it is conceptual and the movie would have us believe that it could live next door.  Time and experience tells us that there is good in everyone.  However, I remember a young boy who was convinced otherwise after seeing ""The Bad Seed"".",5,Is Evil Inherited?,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,1839,"['saw', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'fascinated', 'evil', 'young', 'girl', 'whole', 'concept', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'scary', 'movie', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'youth', 'same', 'chills', 'everytime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'absence', 'sense', 'guilt', 'remorse', 'syrupy', 'way', 'up', 'adults', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'what', 'plotting', 'mind', 'out', 'how', 'cover', 'tracks', 'traits', 'elementary', 'school-aged', 'girl', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'role', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'forgiving', 'for.There', 'actually', 'story', 'evil', 'mother', 'husband', 'services', 'doubt', 'daughter', 'virtue', 'classmate', 'school', 'outing', 'doubts', 'grow', 'able', 'discover', 'father', 'fact', 'not', 'father', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'past', 'mother', 'convinced', 'passed', 'sort', 'genetic', 'evil', 'daughter', 'actually', 'interesting', 'subject', 'evil', 'part', 'DNA', 'modernized', 'question', 'bit', 'mother', 'conclusion', 'essential', 'how', 'daughter', 'guilt.Movies', 'have', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'lot', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'came', 'out', 'yet', 'classic', 'genre', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'was', 'stage', 'play', 'brought', 'screen', 'Nonetheless', 'way', 'evil', 'young', 'creature', 'sense', 'conscience', 'so', 'totally', 'frightening', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'elaborate', 'monsters', 'monstrosity', 'not', 'visual', 'conceptual', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'could', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'Time', 'experience', 'tells', 'good', 'everyone', 'However', 'remember', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'convinced', 'otherwise', 'seeing', 'Bad', 'Seed']",Bad Seed VHS

Today, this beautifully constructed play about a sociopathic neat-freak child named Rhoda,  who will gladly kill anyone who gets in her way, is loved for its camp value. The writing by Maxwell Anderson, based on a novel by William March, is over the top, as are the acting performances by practically everyone. As Patty McCormack herself points out in the delicious commentary she does with Charles Busch, everyone's acting reflected a similar ""heightened reality"" so that no performance would appear out of sync. It's still a toss-up as to which actor chews the most scenery, but the award probably goes to Nancy Kelly as an ordinary mom who begins to suspect the unthinkable regarding her well-behaved child. Henry Jones as the half-witted apartment repairman and Eileen Heckart as the drunken mother of one of Rhoda's victims aren't far behind in their excesses. Only marginally more subtle is the delightful Evelyn Varden as the landlady, friend, and part-time babysitter. And of course, Patty McCormack shines as Rhoda, sweet and courteous one moment, a hellion with pigtails the next. Also, feel free to laugh at the tacked-on Hollywood ending added because in those Hays Code censorship days, movie characters were not allowed to get away with murder. And smile at the entire cast for doing an actual filmed curtain call on-set following the ending to assure viewers that this is just the filming of a play, so not to worry.

It has the same flaws I remembered quite clearly.For one thing, it never got much beyond the stage play.  Nearly all the action takes place in the Penmark living room, which looks like a stage set.  The dialogue is stilted.  The psychology is sophomoric--people spouting nonsense as if it were wisdom.  For the most part, the acting is stagy.  For example, Eileen Heckart as the drunken mother of the murdered boy is grossly overdone.  In fact, the only acting worthy of note is by Patty McCormack as Rhoda and Henry Jones as Leroy the janitor.  I'm always astonished to see a very young person who is good--and Jones is an old pro who always came through.But worst of all, from my view, the ending goes about five minutes too long.

I am sure she would have loved to have a physically handicapped child over this little 'crearure'. This is one of my favorite thrillers to date and i am all but positive it will hold it's place. This little girl is so creepy and controlling at such a young age that as an adult she would wipe out civilization as we know it! I know a bit dramatic! Anyway she seems as if she is the perfect little lady. Which in her distorted mind she is and strives to be,everyday. The horror of this film is the mom trying to reveal her genetics which makes her child lets say ""not right in the head"". All the while this child taunts and puts fear in the severely mentally challenaged gardener. I only place that lable on him because his slowness makes him as pure as an animal and sniffs out the evil within her. We also know he is ""not all there"" because the idiot has the nerve to confront the devil's number one offspring. Come on idiot thats is sure death! So now we wait and watch the idiot have a one up on her for a moment and gets a high. Then her stepford sweet and in some what control self comes out and freaks out and threatens the fool.Which brings him back to reality. He is screwed. So we the onlookers begin to wonder what is or rather how is his fate played out by her. Her anger is so scary but controlled i would do what the distraught mother does in the end! Oh and the ending ,,,Amazing Amazing. The very very end when the players come out and show that they were only actors and that Rhoda was only a character and the ""mother and daughter"" have a cute moment. I assume because it was unprecedented and involved a child. Too creepy. So they wanted to send the crowd home a little less messed up. Sorry doesnt work. Still horrifying.The good son was a kind homage to this film. Two amazingly talented actors and a good script. I really really liked it alot but they needed more scenerey and people and more horrifiying acts, to pump our hearts.

236475,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,6300270270,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 1]","There are horror films that shock with blood and gore, horror films that scare with inhuman and giant monsters, and then there are horror films that have the scariest villains of all -- human beings who are outwardly normal -- who go 'bad' with a diabolical twist.For me the last category of film is the most lasting, thought provoking, and terrifying.""The Bad Seed"" fits this category, thanks to a brilliant screen play (based on a long running Broadway play), superb cinematography, a fine musical score, and outstanding acting all the way around. It is the epitome of understatement, yet is compelling and riveting.It's worth getting and watching not only for the crisp black and white clarity of the film itself, but for the subtle, and emotionally wrenching interactions of the fantastic actors and characters, most notably:Patty McCormack as Rhoda (the monster of the piece),Nancy Kelly as her distraught mother, andEileen Heckart as Hortense Daigle, the mother of Rhoda's first victim.Other reviews of this movie around the Internet reveal the plot, so I won't spoil it here. Suffice it to say that the story unfolds in a way that we, as the audience, can guess who's doing what to whom. But it is loaded with peculiar twists that also keep us guessing, especially the ironic ""Twilight Zone"" type ending (a MUST see). And a word or two about the ending -- without giving it away -- are required:One: The film comes from the 1950's when the Production Codes for ""decency"" were strongly upheld. These codes demanded that evil be punished, the bad guy (or gal) be caught or killed and retribution (divine or human) be applied to satisfy the moral code. Realism didn't matter. So it was with this film, and Rhoda must pay for her crimes. But she's only 8 years old! How does one punish an 8-year old killer without seeming inhumanly cruel? This film comes up with an interesting answer.How the film makes this happen (and thus satisfy the Code) is the twist that some reviewers feel is unacceptable because it is too 'contrived'. I prefer to think of it as ironic. To understand that, one must pay attention to earlier parts of the film that reference judicial punishments upon murderers. Put the two together and the twist ending comes off not only as a surprise, but a diabolically humorous one at that, replete with strong irony.Watch the film and keep in mind: What's the one thing that terrifies Rhoda, the thing that Leroy teases her with, that she will do anything to avoid, and then what actually happens to her? The irony is unmistakeable.Two: After the story ends, the film asks audience members to remain seated so the cast can take a bow. Some reviewers feel that this approach was unnecessary and it softened the impact of the film. I feel that since this was based on a stage play, and tried very much to look like a stage production, the cast appearances at the end are simply an homage to the brilliant stage play that sparked the film. Not only that, but the brilliant cast DESERVES to take a bow. They all did such a good job! And this is reason to buy and view the film.The Actors:Patty McCormack was nominated for an Oscar as Rhoda, and she deserves it. She seems a bit over the top at times, but her character is so dang manipulative, we can easily forgive her being a bit hammy as an actress. Her Rhoda is a true sociopath (psychopath?) and Patty plays it to the hilt, and then some. One of the movie posters has the tag line: ""For Rhoda, murder is child's play"". Brilliant. When it comes to psychopaths, Norman Bates has nothing on Patty's Rhoda!Nancy Kelly's role as Rhoda's mother, Christine, is filled with angst, confusion, love and eventually shock and horror as she faces the reality of what she has ""created"" in her child, through no fault of her own. She has done everything 'right' as a parent, yet her precocious child is a monster -- yep, she's got a defective brain -- but she's family! What IS a mother to do? It is touching and agonizing to watch her mentally collapse as she realizes that unless she takes it upon herself -- and ONLY herself -- to deal with Rhoda, the body count will continue to rise unabated.Her resolution, her focused determination at the end to deal with the problem in an irreversible, but humane fashion are truly and tragically heroic (and there is a surprise coming here, a great twist). Watching her come to terms with her situation while trying to stay balanced is absolutely gut wrenching and left me with the question ""What would I have done?"" in the situation.Eileen Heckart's 'Hortense Daigle' deserved an Oscar as well. She is loaded -- really -- she turns to drink in her grief -- and brilliantly plays a tragic woman trapped in a drunken stupor with a strong inferiority complex to boot. We genuinely feel her suffering and her desperate need for a solution to explain the loss of her child. All around her seem to conspire to hide the truth (from themselves and her), and her frustration and desperation for an answer to her suspicions are palpable. She is brilliantly played, painfully so. And I suspect, given half the chance, she would have torn darling little Rhoda to shreds!Of special note is Evelyn Varden as the upstairs neighbor and landlady, Monica. Her character is sublimely enabling of Rhoda, can see no wrong in the child, and is so outstandingly naive that she maintains a tension in the audience. She professes to understand psychology, yet when faced with a true 'case', she knows and sees nothing. Which works very well for Rhoda! We just KNOW that Rhoda has her eye on her! It's not a question of 'if', it's a question of 'when' she's going to join the growing list of Rhoda's victims! Monica has a brilliant line near the end of the movie (in the hospital scene) that presents an ironic twist in the plot. It's priceless.The rest of the cast is also quite good, especially Henry Jones (a well known character actor) as the sleazy and child-like 'Leroy', the janitor of the apartment house. He learns too late that he should keep his suspicions confined to himself and the police. In fairness, characters in horror films never manage to figure this trick out, just as they never figure out ""don't go into the dark room at the top of the stairs!"" So we, as the audience squirm in twisted delight while awaiting the inevitable, which Rhoda delivers with absolute nonchalance --  making her more terrifying than ever.Leroy is a complex character:Being such a child himself, he can't resist teasing Rhoda with his suspicions. It is almost embarrassing that he pits himself -- a married adult with children of his own -- against an 8-year old. He never seems to realize that this is not a good idea when dealing with a psychotic killer in pigtails!He is almost psychotic himself, and in the beginning of the film, a bit ominous. He's a slimy kind of guy who is scary in his own right. He could easily go 'over the edge' himself, but the film keeps him to the level of a doomed and unappealing simpleton. He is no match for Rhoda when it comes to a battle of wits (of which he has very few).A final note of kudos goes to the musical score by Alex North (wonderfully orchestrated by Maurice De Packh). Music is an important element in film, and this score is tender and filled with pathos in all the right places, ominous in others. The music supports the film and story, it doesn't compete with it, making for a wonderful homogenous whole.The film was produced by Warner Brothers and it is possibly one of their finest productions. It is an excellent film, and we just don't see horror handled so thoughtfully or sensitively anymore, which is a pity. But thanks to Amazon and Turner (where the film occasionally appears) it is not lost to history.Conclusion and Recommendation:For modern movie fans, this film may seem too slow, not gory enough and totally lacking in car chases and explosions -- but this is quality 1950's film making that is thought provoking and gets into our psyche through profoundly human and shocking behavior. It is a 'thinking persons' horror film, not a vicarious thrill ride.If you love horror films, even some modern ones that are so over-the-top, give this one a view. It will give you an alternative perspective on how to handle a horror story.You may find yourself wondering about other horror films on similar subjects and ask: ""Could they have done as good a job with so little -- no real special effects, black and white photography, and a strong leaning on psychology?""And most of all, there is Rhoda. We have met the monsters-- and they are us!Bravo all the way around for an outstanding and very creepy film.",5,"Brilliant film, brilliant acting, scary and thought provoking!
