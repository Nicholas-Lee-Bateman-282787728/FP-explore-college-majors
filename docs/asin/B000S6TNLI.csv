Nevertheless, we are still hungry for information and inspiration. One can only listen to records for so long without wanting to see someone actually playing.These type of instructional DVD's are shortcuts, but are the next best thing to lessons, I feel.This DVD fulfils that educational need for me - I find I can go back to it every so often. Anything that shows drummers that they do not need to hurt themselves by playing too hard by showing that natural physics should be made to work for us is very welcome. I think that in itself is a secret weapon - it's also VERY obvious, but there must be a few drummers out there who think they've got to look like they are in pain whilst playing and confuse that with making an effort.Hopefully this DVD shows them that they need to think about how they move and why some techniques may not be good for the arm, wrist or hand.If an instrumentalist wishes to perform (and be paid to perform) well into their 60's or beyond, they will need good technique - that probably holds true for any instrument. What Jojo does on this DVD in a lighthearted but fully accurate manner is show that the modern drummer has quite a few options available - in the way of using different strokes and grips.It is likely he will enlighten you to some extent, depending on how much you already know, of course.I won't use all of the techniques he describes, but the DVD did (and continues to) show me that I need to be aware of how my hands move and whether they are hurting whilst I'm playing at a gig. If they are, then I change what I'm doing. I can't do that if I don't have options - this DVD equips you well.It will depend on the style of music you like to play and you may find some of the ideas to be a bit like 'tricks', like the one-handed roll.Those who like to play full out rock may see that Jojo can play in a jazzy way and may follow that interest - in that case, may I also recommend Steve Smith's DVD, 'Standing on the Shoulders of Giants'.",5,This gives an inspiring starting point - the rest is up to you,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,2169,"['might', 'be', 'own', 'here', 'think', 'are', 'drummers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'years', '20', 'years', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'lessons', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'still', 'hungry', 'information', 'inspiration', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'listen', 'records', 'so', 'long', 'wanting', 'see', 'someone', 'actually', 'playing.These', 'type', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'are', 'shortcuts', 'are', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'lessons', 'feel.This', 'DVD', 'fulfils', 'educational', 'need', 'find', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'so', 'often', 'Anything', 'drummers', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'hurt', 'playing', 'too', 'hard', 'showing', 'natural', 'physics', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'work', 'very', 'welcome', 'think', 'secret', 'weapon', 'also', 'VERY', 'obvious', 'must', 'be', 'few', 'drummers', 'who', 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'look', 'are', 'pain', 'whilst', 'playing', 'confuse', 'making', 'effort.Hopefully', 'DVD', 'need', 'think', 'how', 'move', 'why', 'techniques', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'arm', 'wrist', 'hand.If', 'instrumentalist', 'wishes', 'perform', 'be', 'paid', 'perform', 'well', '60', 'will', 'need', 'good', 'technique', 'probably', 'true', 'instrument', 'What', 'Jojo', 'DVD', 'lighthearted', 'fully', 'accurate', 'manner', 'show', 'modern', 'drummer', 'quite', 'few', 'options', 'available', 'way', 'using', 'different', 'strokes', 'grips.It', 'likely', 'will', 'enlighten', 'extent', 'depending', 'how', 'much', 'already', 'know', 'course.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'use', 'techniques', 'DVD', 'did', 'show', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'how', 'hands', 'move', 'are', 'hurting', 'whilst', ""'m"", 'playing', 'gig', 'are', 'then', 'change', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'options', 'DVD', 'well.It', 'will', 'depend', 'style', 'music', 'play', 'may', 'find', 'ideas', 'be', 'bit', ""'tricks"", 'one-handed', 'roll.Those', 'who', 'play', 'full', 'rock', 'may', 'see', 'Jojo', 'can', 'play', 'jazzy', 'way', 'may', 'follow', 'interest', 'case', 'may', 'also', 'recommend', 'Steve', 'Smith', 'DVD', ""'Standing"", 'Shoulders', 'Giants']",Secret Weapons for the Modern Drummer

Jojo goes through the rudiments of basic drumming - the different grips and their advantages, why he uses traditional, strokes, double strokes, controlling bounce, moeller technique, the Mayer stroke, etc. in a clear and engaging manner. In between short sessions are little vignettes of him drumming, which is both amazing and inspiring, as this guy is *fast*. He has clearly studied drumming in great detail, as evidenced from the vocabulary he uses - rotors, axes, etc. - but all is explained nicely.It'll take a while to master many of the exercises from the Moeller technique onwards, but if you do, you'll be way ahead as a drummer.

Although music is much more than technique, without technique, our vocabulary with which we can express our musical ideas is stunted. As musical as Buddy Rich was, we'd never have enjoyed his playing if not for the fact that his awesome technique gave him unlimited expression. That spark and excitement we all hope for simply cannot be achieved with sloppy, energy depleting technique.  Jojo created a masterpiece of drumming technique here.

I've always regretted this and just recently purchased an electronic drum set to catch up on lost time.  Being that it is not exactly like riding a bike (the fundamentals come back but overall I feel like a spaz), I decided to relearn everything the right way by getting some drum DVD's and books.  Of the several training items I purchased, this one is the best. JoJo is entertaining, extremely talented, and does an excellent job demonstrating what he is trying to teach you.  He doesn't zip through anything during the lessons.  Plus he has a good sense of humor and is easy to listen to. This is one great instructional DVD and highly recommended.

1085521,A1AWJUDQU6JXGU,B000S6TNLI,Music maven,"[7, 7]","This is the most aggravating DVD I've ever seen. Not because it isn't good, but because it gives me nowhere to hide. I have other DVDs that try to explaining these techniques, but they don't actually explain them, and I could use that as an excuse for my not being able to play like that. Jojo's DVD is such an extraordinary model of clarity, simplicity, and painstaking detail that I really feel there is nothing left to explain. It's all right there. Now if I can't do a one-handed roll at buzz-roll speed, it's only because I haven't practiced it enough, not because I don't know how. I guess I'll just have to practice more--much more.There really is nothing quite like this out there, and it is exactly what I've been looking for. It uses multiple camera angles, animation, slow-motion, repetition at various speeds, and, perhaps most useful from my point of view, he demonstrates a technique using all those tools, then shows you the same technique with no stick in his hand, so you can clearly see the finger, hand, and wrist motions and all the muscle contractions.
