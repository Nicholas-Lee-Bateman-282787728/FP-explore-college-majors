Socialists. If they are becoming Socialists, then they could eventually begin treating American's who believe in God, like the Socialists did to the people of Medjugorje.As I watched Gospa, I wondered if it was going to be similar to the movie Romero where Raul Julia played the part of Archbishop Oscar Romero in El Salvador, where the Socialist murdered him during Mass.I hope someday, that a production company with a big budget will make another Gospa Film, and if they do, I hope they get Martin Sheen and Michael York to play their same roles again in the new production.P.S. There were some square colored blotches that appeared once at the beginning of the movie. Those were probably caused by Amazon making the Copy to quickly.

I made it a point to make a visit to Medjugorje and had one of the most memorable visits in my life. I saw this DVD on Amazon, but I failed to read this description. I assumed this was a documentary narrated by Martin Sheen and Michael York. It is not a documentary but a movie based on the events of 1981 when 6 children claimed to have visitations by the Virgin Mary.Unfortunately, this movie is not about the children and their visions but rather the story of the parish priest Father Zovko who becomes enamored with the fame and glory now associated with Medugorje. Sadly, an inpsiring and beautiful story is turned into a low quality TV movie with some high class actors. There is even a lovely Morgan Fairchild, without make-up, as a pious nun. The two fellow priests in the parish are two actors I have seen regularlty on TV. Great cast in a very low budget film. As the story unfolds, the screen goes to black for a few seconds as if we are cutting to a non existent commercial break. There is no transition between major scenes and the music is seriously annoying and low budget. Even the title credits are simple computer generated letters.I wondered how Martin Sheen, Michael York and Morgan Fairchild became involved in low quality production such as this one.My visit to Medugorje was a very moving and profound experience. It was wonderful to see the beautiful and modest church in Medugorje. I recognized a few locations in the film so it was nice to relive the memory of my visit. Once I found out this was a film, I assumed it would be about the children and their visions of the Virgin Mary. It was not. This turned out to be a film about Father Zovko's troubles with the communist government. His religious sermons seemed to be encouraging political change in Yugoslavia and the powers that be were not pleased.Yes, there is a story here but somehow everything gets lost. Michael York gives a fine performance as the fiery lawyer defending Father Zovko in court.This is a story about Father Zovko and the 6 children are more a side story. We really don't know much about their visions and what the Virgin Mary's message was to them other than to pray for peace and to fast. The children seem to be in a trance with little to say and there is little explanation about what they are experiencing.This is an odd movie for another reason. The main characters are either American or British speaking with their normal accents. The lesser actors speak English but with a Croatian accent. It all seems so out of place. I don't know what the option would be but the three priests and nun speaking like Americans seemed so out of place in the former Yugoslavia.The events of Medugorje deserve and more loving and inspired telling.",2,UNINSPIRED TELLING OF AN INSPIRATIONAL STORY,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,2793,"['spent', 'summer', '1988', 'former', 'Yugoslavia', 'made', 'point', 'make', 'visit', 'Medjugorje', 'had', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'visits', 'life', 'saw', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'failed', 'read', 'description', 'assumed', 'was', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Michael', 'York', 'not', 'documentary', 'movie', 'based', 'events', '1981', 'when', '6', 'children', 'claimed', 'have', 'visitations', 'Virgin', 'Mary.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'not', 'children', 'visions', 'rather', 'story', 'parish', 'priest', 'Father', 'Zovko', 'who', 'enamored', 'fame', 'glory', 'now', 'associated', 'Medugorje', 'Sadly', 'inpsiring', 'beautiful', 'story', 'turned', 'low', 'quality', 'TV', 'movie', 'high', 'class', 'actors', 'even', 'lovely', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'make-up', 'pious', 'nun', 'two', 'fellow', 'priests', 'parish', 'are', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'seen', 'regularlty', 'TV', 'Great', 'cast', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'story', 'unfolds', 'screen', 'black', 'few', 'seconds', 'are', 'cutting', 'non', 'existent', 'commercial', 'break', 'transition', 'major', 'scenes', 'music', 'seriously', 'annoying', 'low', 'budget', 'Even', 'title', 'credits', 'are', 'simple', 'computer', 'generated', 'letters.I', 'wondered', 'how', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Michael', 'York', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'became', 'involved', 'low', 'quality', 'production', 'such', 'one.My', 'visit', 'Medugorje', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'profound', 'experience', 'was', 'wonderful', 'see', 'beautiful', 'modest', 'church', 'Medugorje', 'recognized', 'few', 'locations', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'relive', 'memory', 'visit', 'Once', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'film', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'children', 'visions', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'was', 'not', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'film', 'Father', 'Zovko', 'troubles', 'communist', 'government', 'religious', 'sermons', 'seemed', 'be', 'encouraging', 'political', 'change', 'Yugoslavia', 'powers', 'be', 'were', 'not', 'pleased.Yes', 'story', 'here', 'somehow', 'everything', 'lost', 'Michael', 'York', 'fine', 'performance', 'fiery', 'lawyer', 'defending', 'Father', 'Zovko', 'court.This', 'story', 'Father', 'Zovko', '6', 'children', 'are', 'more', 'side', 'story', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'visions', 'what', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'message', 'was', 'other', 'pray', 'peace', 'fast', 'children', 'seem', 'be', 'trance', 'little', 'say', 'little', 'explanation', 'what', 'are', 'experiencing.This', 'odd', 'movie', 'reason', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'either', 'American', 'British', 'speaking', 'normal', 'accents', 'lesser', 'actors', 'speak', 'English', 'Croatian', 'accent', 'so', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'option', 'would', 'be', 'three', 'priests', 'nun', 'speaking', 'Americans', 'seemed', 'so', 'place', 'former', 'Yugoslavia.The', 'events', 'Medugorje', 'deserve', 'more', 'loving', 'inspired', 'telling']",N/A
