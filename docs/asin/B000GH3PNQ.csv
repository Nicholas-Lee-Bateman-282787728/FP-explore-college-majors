With Jullian Fellowes as Killwillie out of the picture and no more Hector, it seems this series just tries to aim for tackiness.  I do recommend the first two series highly as they are intriguing and provide an interesting insight into Scottish Highland customs, but this installment is just at best overbearing.  The plot lines are forced and the general message is cheapness.  I really don't even think it is worth bothering with.  Sorry to be negative, but I'm not sure what the BBC was thinking on this one.",1,Lackluster Installment,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,649,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'series', 'really', 'just', 'fails', 'live', 'up', 'kind', 'standard', 'Jullian', 'Fellowes', 'Killwillie', 'picture', 'more', 'Hector', 'series', 'just', 'aim', 'tackiness', 'do', 'recommend', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'highly', 'are', 'intriguing', 'provide', 'interesting', 'insight', 'Scottish', 'Highland', 'customs', 'installment', 'just', 'best', 'overbearing', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'forced', 'general', 'message', 'cheapness', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'worth', 'bothering', 'Sorry', 'be', 'negative', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'BBC', 'was', 'thinking', 'one']",Monarch of the Glen - Series Five
