1008966,A2WE3L0Q9KUQQK,B000H1RFIM,A. Beck,"[65, 68]","I've always wanted to learn kickboxing, but most DVDs are for intermediates, which often goes too fast and don't show you the basics.  This DVD has a tutorial for the Top Ten Kickboxing moves.  They include 1)Ring Moves, 2) Cross, 3) Hook, 4) Front Kick, 5) Sidekick, 6) Jab, 7) UpperCut, 8) Knee Thrust, 9) Back Kick, 10) Roundhouse.  The beginner can take their time mastering these basic moves before going on the other 3 kickboxing exercises, which the viewer can choose.  The beginner can also learn to do these moves right so that injuries can be avoided.  Keli takes her time and shows you the proper way to move.  This builds confidence and you won't feel like you'll fall behind when she goes a little quicker in her exercises.  After buying this DVD, I can forget about the fast paste TAE BO DVD's, which seem to be for fit folks who like to look competitive.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to take their time learning kickboxing right.",5,Rare gem for beginners,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,965,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'learn', 'kickboxing', 'most', 'DVDs', 'are', 'intermediates', 'often', 'too', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'basics', 'DVD', 'tutorial', 'Top', 'Ten', 'Kickboxing', 'moves', 'include', '1', 'Ring', 'Moves', '2', 'Cross', '3', 'Hook', '4', 'Front', 'Kick', '5', 'Sidekick', '6', 'Jab', '7', 'UpperCut', '8', 'Knee', 'Thrust', '9', 'Back', 'Kick', '10', 'Roundhouse', 'beginner', 'can', 'take', 'time', 'mastering', 'basic', 'moves', 'going', 'other', '3', 'kickboxing', 'exercises', 'viewer', 'can', 'choose', 'beginner', 'can', 'also', 'learn', 'do', 'moves', 'right', 'so', 'injuries', 'can', 'be', 'avoided', 'Keli', 'time', 'proper', 'way', 'move', 'confidence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'when', 'little', 'quicker', 'exercises', 'buying', 'DVD', 'can', 'forget', 'fast', 'paste', 'TAE', 'BO', 'DVD', 'seem', 'be', 'fit', 'folks', 'who', 'like', 'look', 'competitive', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'take', 'time', 'learning', 'kickboxing', 'right']",Fat-Burning Kickboxing Workout for Dummies

1008970,A1IROAQI1F1PK9,B000H1RFIM,"E. Parker ""pushbuttonkitty""","[26, 26]","Overall Rating: 4.5/5I'd always been interested in learning kickboxing, so I began shopping around for an at home workout regimen that included kickboxing moves.  One called 'for Dummies' seemed like a good place to start.I'm so glad I bought this!  I'll be honest, when I first got this, I wasn't in the best of shape, but I wasn't in horrible shape either.  I did the Top 10 and thought 'oh, no biggie, this'll be cake'.  Then I did the actual workout.Or rather, tried to do.I was flopping around, falling, trying to keep up, always ten moves behind.  I got frustrated really quick and was hurting myself doing the wrong thing the wrong way.So I stopped.  Went back to the Top 10 and did it again.  And again.  I started doing the Top 10 every day, six times in a row, perfecting my form and getting totally comfortable with the moves.  And although the tutorial is much slower paced, I still had a sweat going by the time I was through.I did this for a couple of weeks, five days a week, six times in a row.  Finally, I felt totally confident that I could get through the workout with no problems.I managed to scuttle my way through it, but I was going slower than Keli, the instructor.  For every eight reps she did, I was managing about six.  I would lose my form when I tried to keep up with her because it switched from one move to the other quicker than I could set myself up to execute the move.I finally figured it out.  What I do is, each time, I'll do the Top 10 once, as a warm up, getting my muscles reacquainted with each stance and execution.  Then, when I get into the workout, I've already got my moves down, and I don't have to fumble around during part of the main routine.Another thing that I think helped me was learning the workout one section at a time, instead of tackling the whole thing.  There are three different workouts between the warm up and the cool down.  I would do one of them three times in a row instead of doing the other two.  I would do that every time I did the workout until I felt comfortable with the moves.  Then I'd start working on the second one and repeat the process until I mastered the whole thing.  This dvd is broken up into convenient segments, take advantage of that.  It's better to do it right than to do it fast.  Take this one slow and work into it.I love the setup of this dvd.  The dvd itself is very easy to navigate through.  I like the modifications and hints it shows you during the workout.  I really like Keli Roberts as an instructor.  She's tough but doesn't take herself too seriously.  She's far less annoying than other instructors I've had on workouts.  I have a thing for accents, too, so her voice kind of makes me smile rather than annoys me.  She's got great energy without being obnoxious.The warm-up on this one is pretty high energy, I think.  More so than warm-ups on other vids I've done.  That's another reason why I do the tutorial first- it acts as a prelude to the warm-up, gets me ready to go.Fat Burning #1 is my least favorite of the three.  It was the most complicated for me to learn, moves wise, and maybe that frustration is still with me,  I do it, but it is always the one I skip if I'm pressed for time and only want to do one or two of the fat burning sequences.Fat Burning #2 is my favorite of the three.  Not because it's the shortest, although that is a contributing factor, but because it focuses on kicks.  When I'm having a crappy day and I'm angry or frustrated or just have a lot of pent up energy, I love doing kicks.  It really gets the grr out.  I like it so much I'll sometimes do the whole set again just so I can kick some more.Fat Burning #3 is the one that gets my blood pumping the most.  I really get in the zone when I'm doing this one.  The moves in this sequence don't flow in a normal way so it keeps you on your toes.  You have to really think about this one.  It switches back and forth instantly between two similar punches and then again with two similar kicks so you really have to know your form.  I've found saying the moves out loud as I do them helps me execute them better.I really like the cool down.  I think it's during the cool down that you realize what a stress buster kickboxing is.  The music softens, the moves soften, the room starts to feel cooler as your sweat cools, and it feels so calm and peaceful compared to kicking and punching and bouncing you were doing two minutes ago.  It's very smooth, flowing from one stretch to the other, slowing down your body and breathing deep.  More than any other workout, this one is the best at improving my mood.  I normally keep it for days I don't have time to do a full length workout, but sometimes when I've had a particularly hard day I'll come home and do this workout, and make up the rest of my workout time on my elliptical.  This one is also great to bring when traveling because it's short, and most people away from home don't have too much time to devote to working out, and also because it requires no special equipment, so all you have to bring is the dvd.I definitely recommend this workout to anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to devote to working out as it gives you the most bang for your buck.  The Top 10 tutorial is so good that I'd even recommend this dvd to people who just wanted to learn some basic kickboxing moves and weren't necessarily interested in the workout portion.If you're a beginner, have some patience, take it slow, and be persistent.  You'll get a lot out of this workout, guaranteed.For those who aren't beginners, this would still be a great workout for when you're strapped for time.Either way, you can't go wrong!",4,This is THE

I've done some of her other workouts, and if done consistantly, there are fantastic results.I don't have too many kickboxing dvds, and seeing that Keli leads this, I had to get it.  It's fantastic.  This is mainly geared for beginners in kickboxing and the impact is low and it's easy to follow because the moves are basic.  She goes at a fast pace, but this makes sure that you are always burning fat and calories.  If you are unsure about posture and your positioning, don't fret - she cues very well.  There is also some options for different intensity levels, so it doesn't matter if you are unfit or not.  I also like the safety tips they use throughout and the seperate instructional portion of the dvd that's done at the end.  This will really help you learn all the terminology and exactly how each move is done.Keli really knows her stuff.

Keli is alone & teaches you w/o distraction in 1/2 time or slower throughout the entire dvd proper form for kickboxing so you don't get sloppy & possibly injure yourself.It's broken down into a 17 min. instruction & 3 workouts each one adding more punches & kicks.Although I liked she went slow, I found it a bit boring. A martial arts friend said her form was fine. I'm picky about body awareness & though she moved well, I look for a workout that emphasizes on using this for self defense one day. Hence emphasizing on putting real energy & all you can into the kicks & punches.

If you're new to kickboxing, it's worth doing the tutorial before the workout until you get familiar with the ring moves.  This is a fast-paced DVD and an excellent workout!  Keli Roberts gives clear, concise instructions and makes the workout fun.  Be ready to sweat!
