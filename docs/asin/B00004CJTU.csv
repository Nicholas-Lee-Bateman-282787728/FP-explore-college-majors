547000,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00004CJTU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 0]","What is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge.  Recently, my viewing has taken the form of stapled classics like ""Raging Bull"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but this time my VCR took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right down in front of Lionel Jeffries' ""The Railway Children"".  This is a skillfully directed film about three youthful children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation to the open fields of England, and eventually the rewards inherited by merely waving at trains.  At first glance this seemingly simple children's film doesn't seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on VHS rarity for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is more than just your common place children's movie - ""Railway Children"" was created during a time when purity was more than just saying ""no"", when family meant everything, and where adventure was ready for you around every railroad track bend.  This is more than an adorable film, it has amazing cinematic techniques used, it keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions, and gives three perfect companions to follow along this 110-minute voyage.  ""Railway Children"" is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by families and film aficionados alike.There are several moments that stand out proudly in ""Railway Children"" that transform this from mediocrity to excellence - one happens to be our three children; Bobby, Phyllis, and Peter.  Modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide ample darkness, laughter, and insight into the world surrounding them, but Jeffries' children prove otherwise.  From intelligently spoken lines (both from acting and the script), to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, all the way to the final meeting at that train stop; these children are more than just child stars advancing a story, they are leading us with emotion, persuasion, and a realism unseen by today's children.  There is more imagination packed in this small VHS than I have witnessed in film for years.  A favorite scene that could have been handled with generality, of which I have seen in other films, was the birthday scene for Bobby.  The way that Jeffries floats her between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes excited about each scene, as well as our mind.  Another scene that captured my attention was when the children were working on gifts for Perks, when asking one man for a gift, Jeffries has him merely state, ""No, I will not.  I don't like Perks."" The children's reaction is hilarious - providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout.  Filmed in the 1970s, this tiny feature provides genuine laughs than most modern comedies.  It is a creative film coupled with great choreography and direction.That is to say, as much as I loved this film, it wasn't perfect.  Jeffries does a great job of keeping us guessing as to what happened to father, but it did feel like the event occurred, the children were kept in the dark, and it suddenly resolved itself by the end.  More detail to father, not much more, would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction.  Also, there is one scene in this film, one of those grandiose wide-screen shots of the English countryside that is just breath-taking, but when looking a bit closer you happen to see cars in the background.  It made me chuckle, but didn't distract too much from the overall picture.  Cinema like this is sorely missed today, and oddly, it seems that only the British have the gumption to produce it.  Films like ""Love, Actually"" or ""Vicar of Dibley"" demonstrates the power and excitement for community towns, places where everyone knows everyone and we aren't afraid to be neighborly.  This is more of a theme that American audiences could have more of - more understanding of what is happening outside, instead of remaining secluded to your own events.Overall, I loved ""Railway Children"".  I didn't know what to expect when I first put it in the VHS player, but from the opening scene, to the exploding train set, to Perks birthday, Jeffries proved that he could handle the most child-friendly story with ease.  His ability to make the child actors feel like real characters, to involve the adults less, and to involve the children like they were adults was outstanding.  This is a film to be viewed as a strong alternative to anything Disney releases.  The continually occurring themes of friendship, kindness to strangers, and forgiveness blasts through the TV with grace and power.  ""Railway Children"" is more than just a kid's film; it is a feature that should be a staple to modern audience viewing.  Not only does it give a great visual to the English countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting any CGI bad guys.Grade: ****  out of *****",5,The Railway Children should be the poster children of today's youth...,1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,5095,"['What', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'random', 'movies',

This is the style like ""Pride and Prejudice"" where over time a familiarity and respect develops. This is similar to Disney movies made about 30 years ago. They don't make many like it any longer unfortunately. Three English children are told their father will be away for some time and they must go to the country to live like the poor. They are saddened and yet optimistic there will be new things to see and do. The settings in Victorian England are very well done. The cast and story is what really makes the movie. Special appearance by Sir Richard Attenborough is well received. Even though he is only seen briefly throughout the movie, his part is well performed. This movie is not fast paced, but if you are patient about watching it will pay off.

547003,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00004CJTU,C. O. DeRiemer,"[9, 9]","The Railway Children, at least this 1970 movie version written and directed by that long-time British character actor, Lionel Jeffries, is an unmitigated...classic. It tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; the sentimentality is muted; the evocation of childhood adventures is involving; and Jeffries brings cleverness and style to his production.The Waterbury family is leading an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are well-mannered and affectionate, their home is warm and cozy. Then one night during the Christmas holidays two men appear at the doorstep, talk quietly to the father, and then take him away. In a moment the lives of Mrs Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and young Peter (Gary Warren), have been changed. Only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through. Now teetering into poverty, Mrs. Waterbury takes her children to live in a musty old brick house in the countryside near a rail-line, not too far from a small village with a train station. The children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave at the passengers as the train chugs by. One day an old gentleman, going to his business in the city, looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back. It's not long before he will play an important part in the story.As time passes, Mrs. Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children. She begins to write stories to earn money. She teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them. The story, however, is about these three children, especially Bobbie. At 14, she is old enough to want to share her mother's worries, yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother. They find a poor man at the station who cannot speak English. They discover he is a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. They insist he must come home with them, and their mother takes him in. Before long the children have written a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for his help. They help a young man taking part in a steeplechase who breaks his leg in a train tunnel. Soon, he is at their home recuperating. They decide to have a birthday party for the station master, a man with few friends and several children who is a stickler for his dignity. It's not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures, and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all the problems have happy endings.But what of their own problems? Bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he had been accused of treason, of giving state secrets to the Russians. Will Bobbie be able to find a way to help? Will the old gentleman be something more than simply an old gentleman on a passing train? Will their father's case be reopened? Will there be a happy ending?Jenny Agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her part; she plays the 14-year-old Bobbie with great naturalness and charm. As important as the other players are, especially Dinah Sheridan as the mother, Agutter is the heart of the story. For me, it is Jenny Agutter's talent and Lionel Jeffries' style and restraint that make this movie so memorable. The story's problems come with no serious doubt but that they will be solved. And Jeffries does not just give us an expertly adapted and directed movie, he adds touches that are barely noticed but which charm us. This might include just a split second of a freeze frame as two people talk; or a slow close-up of a small, yellow wildflower in the grass outside Bobbie's home, then a slow pull-back from a yellow oil lamp being turned up inside; or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill...all suddenly recall those charming Edwardian hand-tinted drawings of a perfect by-gone time.Perhaps this gentle story can't compete for the time kids need nowadays to perfect their Nintendo monster-splatting skills. I'm almost positive it would never capture the attention of most of their parents, especially those weaned on Batman and Leone. Still, it's a perfectly put together movie and shouldn't be forgotten. As an aside, 19 years later the story was retold as a television program. This time, Jenny Agutter played the mother.The DVD is available as a Region two from AmazonUK. The transfer looks very good.

Jenny Agutter shines as the oldest daughter in a role that could very easily have been overacted.  I've seen this movie numerous times since first taking my children to see it when originally released.  I'm constantly amazed at the sense of civility and decency one brings away from it.  It's a family film about family, and how important (no matter how jaded we think we are) it really is.  The lovely Johnny Douglas score is also quite wonderful.  And I bet the last scene brings a smile to your face.  Needless to say this version of ""The Railway Children"" is highly recommended.

There is one line in the film that can get to me even now, some 40+ years later, when Jenny Agutter says &#34;Daddy, my Daddy&#34;!It is charming and gentle, it can be watched on a summer's evening or on Christmas Eve. It will not shock you or leave you feeling nervous! you can watch it with your children, your grandchildren or just as I did on my own!",5,A feel good film for all ages,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,594,"['was', 'film', 'remember', 'having', 'effect', '12', 'year', 'old', 'growing', 'up', 'village', 'had', 'train', 'station', 'just', 'same', 'station', 'master', 'was', 'cross', 'Bernard', 'Cribbins', 'one', 'Mrs', 'Miniver', 'played', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'one', 'line', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'even', 'now', '40+', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', '34', 'Daddy', 'Daddy', '34', 'charming', 'gentle', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'summer', 'evening', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'will', 'not', 'shock', 'leave', 'feeling', 'nervous', 'can', 'watch', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'just', 'did', 'own']",The Railway Children VHS

I can't think of a better way than to watch this lovely evocation of Victorian family, love & perseverance. It does something rare by capturing all the warmth & sentimentality of such a story without ever succumbing to the maudlin or sticky-sweet. Even though we know the story must end happily, with the world of the struggling family fully restored, it still maintains a distinct dramatic tension throughout.Of course the young Jenny Agutter is a marvel! It's no wonder she managed the transition from child to adult actress so well -- she brings a rich, subtle palette of emotion to the role of Bobbie, saying so much more than words could with the slightest change of expression. Yet she can also give us displays of unalloyed sorrow & joy that burst to overflowing with feeling, and make them absolutely convincing & honest.The look of the film is beautiful, with a particular glow & depth of color that so many English films from that period display. And Lionel Jeffries' direction is superb -- you can sense how much he loves telling this story, and that love comes through on the screen. It's a golden dream of a place too perfect to exist in real life ... but what a wonderful dream it is, while it lasts!Now, if someone will only bring this DVD back into print again ...",5,Victorian perfection,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,1426,"['Sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'escape', 'awhile', 'simpler', 'time', 'place', 'where', 'suffering', 'virtue', 'are', 'rewarded', 'injustice', 'always', 'set', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'way', 'watch', 'lovely', 'evocation', 'Victorian', 'family', 'love', 'perseverance', 'something', 'rare', 'capturing', 'warmth', 'sentimentality', 'such', 'story', 'ever', 'succumbing', 'maudlin', 'sticky-sweet', 'Even', 'know', 'story', 'must', 'end', 'happily', 'world', 'struggling', 'family', 'fully', 'restored', 'still', 'distinct', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'throughout.Of', 'course', 'young', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'marvel', 'wonder', 'managed', 'transition', 'child', 'adult', 'actress', 'so', 'well', 'rich', 'subtle', 'palette', 'emotion', 'role', 'Bobbie', 'saying', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'words', 'could', 'slightest', 'change', 'expression', 'can', 'also', 'give', 'displays', 'unalloyed', 'sorrow', 'joy', 'overflowing', 'feeling', 'make', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'honest.The', 'look', 'film', 'beautiful', 'particular', 'glow', 'depth', 'color', 'so', 'many', 'English', 'films', 'period', 'display', 'Lionel', 'Jeffries', 'direction', 'superb', 'can', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'telling', 'story', 'love', 'screen', 'golden', 'dream', 'place', 'too', 'perfect', 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'wonderful', 'dream', 'Now', 'someone', 'will', 'only', 'bring', 'DVD', 'back', 'print', 'again']",The Railway Children VHS
