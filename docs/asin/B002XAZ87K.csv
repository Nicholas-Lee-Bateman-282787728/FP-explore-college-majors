1297522,AR9UJR8C22Z33,B002XAZ87K,bonzzonz,"[0, 7]","A DVD dedicated to a Propaganda that promotes a mythical church that never existed.  The type of DVD is expressly for the Sheeple -- (Sheeple (a portmanteau of ""sheep"" and ""people"") is a term that highlights the herd behavior of people by likening them to sheep, a herd animal.  The term is used to describe those who voluntarily acquiesce to a suggestion without critical analysis or research.--quoted from the Dictionary).  The Albigenses (12 and 13th century) and the Waldenses (Peter Waldo- Originated in the 12th century) --  Definition of WALDENSES: a Christian sect arising in southern France in the 12th century, adopting Calvinist doctrines in the 16th century, and later living chiefly in Piedmont.  In this time and as early as the fall of Rome, the peasantry worked 7 days a week.  The only hope the peasant had was at the end of life was to go to heaven.  Contradictory movements were met with extreme results before the Rome Pope could act.  After all the only hope out of this world is heaven and a message that lead to the French invention of the Albigenses and Waldenses saying that you have to leave the Apostolic Church for their way is the only way out was not the hope of the time.  Not possible that the peasantry would believe the Albigenses or the Waldenses from the 12th century.  This DVD does state that the Rome Church did chose to separate from One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church in 1054.  Thus the Roman Church separated from the Christian East and made unto itself its own separate church.  This DVD completely leaves out that the Rome Church was being run by disregarded European royalty and Large Commercial Families.  The Roman Church has gone through its own Reformation and the Roman Church does not rule countries any more; governments do that now.  The only recommendation for this DVD is that it does have in it historical data that is not covered in the Class rooms of government schools.  Only if you have a History back ground and know basic facts of the total development of the Christian Church would this DVD be a recommendation.  Baptist, Mormons, Jehovah Witness and other invented groups that claim a divine origin also claim the Albigenses and Waldenses fiction as their historical record.  After the fall of Rome, groups were separated from the Church and the Scholars of scripture.  They made their own theology up, to include animals speaking at Christmas and other strange tails.  Would you want to believe that a separate church existed in Europe and also used the Roman Italic Latin Bible?  Seams strange that a unknown underground church did not have its own Bible.",1,A Lamp in The Dark -- Mostly propaganda Historical Ficton,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,2625,"['DVD', 'dedicated', 'Propaganda', 'mythical', 'church', 'never', 'existed', 'type', 'DVD', 'expressly', 'Sheeple', 'Sheeple', 'portmanteau', 'sheep', 'people', 'term', 'herd', 'behavior', 'people', 'likening', 'sheep', 'herd', 'animal', 'term', 'used', 'describe', 'who', 'voluntarily', 'suggestion', 'critical', 'analysis', 'research.', 'quoted', 'Dictionary', 'Albigenses', '12', '13th', 'century', 'Waldenses', 'Peter', 'Waldo-', 'Originated', '12th', 'century', 'Definition', 'WALDENSES', 'Christian', 'sect', 'arising', 'southern', 'France', '12th', 'century', 'adopting', 'Calvinist', 'doctrines', '16th', 'century', 'later', 'living', 'chiefly', 'Piedmont', 'time', 'as', 'early', 'fall', 'Rome', 'peasantry', 'worked', '7', 'days', 'week', 'only', 'hope', 'peasant', 'had', 'was', 'end', 'life', 'was', 'go', 'heaven', 'Contradictory', 'movements', 'were', 'met', 'extreme', 'results', 'Rome', 'Pope', 'could', 'act', 'only', 'hope', 'world', 'heaven', 'message', 'lead', 'French', 'invention', 'Albigenses', 'Waldenses', 'saying', 'have', 'leave', 'Apostolic', 'Church', 'way', 'only', 'way', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'hope', 'time', 'Not', 'possible', 'peasantry', 'would', 'believe', 'Albigenses', 'Waldenses', '12th', 'century', 'DVD', 'state', 'Rome', 'Church', 'did', 'chose', 'separate', 'One', 'Holy', 'Catholic', 'Apostolic', 'Church', '1054', 'Thus', 'Roman', 'Church', 'separated', 'Christian', 'East', 'made', 'unto', 'own', 'separate', 'church', 'DVD', 'completely', 'out', 'Rome', 'Church', 'was', 'being', 'run', 'disregarded', 'European', 'royalty', 'Large', 'Commercial', 'Families', 'Roman', 'Church', 'gone', 'own', 'Reformation', 'Roman', 'Church', 'not', 'rule', 'countries', 'more', 'governments', 'do', 'now', 'only', 'recommendation', 'DVD', 'have', 'historical', 'data', 'not', 'covered', 'Class', 'rooms', 'government', 'schools', 'Only', 'have', 'History', 'back', 'ground', 'know', 'basic', 'facts', 'total', 'development', 'Christian', 'Church', 'would', 'DVD', 'be', 'recommendation', 'Baptist', 'Mormons', 'Jehovah', 'Witness', 'other', 'invented', 'groups', 'claim', 'divine', 'origin', 'also', 'claim', 'Albigenses', 'Waldenses', 'fiction', 'historical', 'record', 'fall', 'Rome', 'groups', 'were', 'separated', 'Church', 'Scholars', 'scripture', 'made', 'own', 'theology', 'up', 'include', 'animals', 'speaking', 'Christmas', 'other', 'strange', 'tails', 'Would', 'want', 'believe', 'separate', 'church', 'existed', 'Europe', 'also', 'used', 'Roman', 'Italic', 'Latin', 'Bible', 'Seams', 'strange', 'unknown', 'underground', 'church', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'own', 'Bible']",A Lamp in the Dark: The Untold History of the Bible

1297524,A5I5DXHUD6B6Y,B002XAZ87K,Dennis,"[8, 23]","As Catholic who dabbled in Protestantism, it's stuff like this that made me really examine the Church history and come back to Catholicism.  I don't care what anyone says they'll always have different interpretations of Christianity and how it should be structured. Such was the case in the early days of the Church. The Catholics are rightfully documented as not having the best history. Unfortunately as they grew larger, so too did their humanistic quest for greed and power. And I shouldn't say ""their"" because it was not all Catholics that thought this way.The documentary makes some very bold claims in that the church itself had a satanic front that continues to this day to bring about the Antichrist or literally is the Antichrist. Most of these theories started by the likes of Dave Hunt years ago have began to lost their thunder and have been outright disproven. Much of the christian morals/customs even today are structured on the customs the Roman Catholic Church created. Last time I checked I haven't seem too many Protestant  churches denouncing celebrating christmas on Dec 25th.My main issue on the film was it was solely based on bashing the Catholics, which again was the most dominating Christian presence at the time. There is no real or fair debate on the history of the Bible in this film.  Mr. Pinto vaguely even describes how the book was structured and assembled and barely mention that Catholics do get credit for building the model of the Bible we know today. I say not so balanced because then he definitely nit picks from obscure sources. He also totally ignores the positive impact the church had on the world. He doesn't tell you that key reformers such as Martin Luther who is praised throughout, had a number of outlandish quotes of denouncing the Old Testament all together and straight up altering the Bible's content. My point is absolute power in any mortal hands will corrupt on some length of the chain. Thank God Martin Luther's ideas didn't take over or we'd have NO OLD TESTAMENT IN THE BIBLE!!! Here's a quote I just read in an independent magazine (Whistle Blower WND.com) about Martin Luther regarding the Jews that you won't hear mentioned by Pinto ""On the Jews and their Lies...We are at fault in not slaying them..."" As critical as Pinto is to direct quotes, I'd love for him to just be fair about it. JUST BE FAIR MR. PINTO! Anything else is simply unethical and is a product of disinformation. Here's a link to some other outrageous quotes from Luther[...]I was really searching for balanced portrayal and in some ways this really hurt my view of Chris Pinto's work. It me question if this is where he gets his theories how much else of his material is built on straw houses. His radio show is filled daily how the Catholic Church is essentially the Antichrist and is looking to take over the world. What else is new. This has been talked about for centuries and yet the biggest thing we Catholics are looking today at a local level is how to help the Community. Look around you and tell me if the Catholics are growing in numbers or if they're morals of pro life anti homosexuality is catching on. It's the complete opposite if anything where the emerging church movement made up of mostly Protestants is under riding the Church. I'm should add that I'm hardly anti-protestent as I own and support a great deal of Protestant publications/dvds. To see such a production dealing with ""corruption's"" in the Protestant church, check out the Submerging Church...Excellent Documentary.He uses the same old conjecture of why do catholics worship mary, call their pastors father, worship idols ect all of which are so ignorantly misunderstood and shows he either did no real research or is simply trying to sway the viewer.I will say it's well worth the time watching it to get some historical background of the early Church, but just realize this is HARDLY the full history of the Bible. Even Alex Jones who promoted this dvd eventually took it off his shelves. And if you watch his interview with Chris you'll find that when he pushes Chris for answers, he replies ""Well it's a complicated issue"". Sure it is Chris. Trying to sum up the history of the Oldest Christian Church. If you want a REAL hisotry of Catholicism, check out the Catholicism DVD series by Fr. Baron.There's just way too much out there that is blatant anti Chrisitian and for people like Pinto to put all his energy into anti Catholicism (a trinitarian bible believing Christian religion) seems like a waste of time. But I guess when your whole career is built on the same hypothesis than you have no choice.",1,This Doc made me lose respect for Chris Pinto,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,4627,"['Catholic', 'who',

I sat through 26 minutes of it and after catching a lie I started taking notes. I filled a page of lies in those 26 minutes.1) they quote a ""historian"", John Dowling saying ""50 million heretics were killed in the 600 years of the inquisition"". A blatant lie from a strong opponent of the RCC writing in 1845. The Vatican opened its archives for modern historians in the last decade, and guess what? the number is less than 5,000 people executed during the inquisition, which is by almost half per annum the executions in the state of Texas.2) Those true Christians the ""Albigenses"", which was a hersy was persecuted by the most violent Saint Dominic and Saint Louis de Montfort. at this point I started to laugh. Anybody ever heard of the Albigenses heresy? Lets take a look at what they believed, and you can decide if they were Christian:""A heresy during the middle ages that developed in the town Albi in Southern France.  This error taught that there were two gods:  the good god of light usually referred to as Jesus in the New Testament and the god of darkness and evil usually associated with Satan and the ""God of the Old Testament.""  Anything material was considered evil including the body which was created by Satan.  The soul, created by the good god, was imprisoned in the evil flesh and salvation was possible only through holy living and doing good works.  At death, if the person has been spiritual enough, salvation comes to the believer.  But, if the person has not been good enough, he is reincarnated as an animal or another human.  The Albigenses denied the resurrection of the body since it was considered evil."" Folks that is not from a Catholic source. And the list goes on.This isn't even slickly packaged. The lies were so blatant that anyone with a modicum of Church history would see them as glaringly obvious.This made for RCC haters and the ignorant.Why did I give it 2 stars instead of just 1?

So much of this comprehensive program is biased towards the Protestant point of view. The other reviewers are correct concerning their statements about Christianity's bloody past, especially during the Dark Ages. The Holy Book was something considered very sacred and had been for a thousand years or so and the Church did not take kindly to others giving their private interpretation. I think this DVD shows the struggles concerning religious points of view and man's inhumanity to man. Fortunately, today we have come to a better understanding of the motivations behind the Reformers and hopefully Catholics and Protestants can come together and stand together in a world where any believer in Christ is increasingly under attack. Make of the viewpoints what you will. It is always hard to know exactly what happened during many time periods. We owe the Reformers for putting the Bible into everyone's hands written in their own vernacular. We owe the Catholic church and people like Saint Patrick for protecting the Bible through various councils, priests and monks. We can also thank the Catholic church for its controversial Crusades. At best, you can see how it kept the onslaught of Islam from increasing and taking over all of the Holy Land. It is hard to determine where history would have led us if it weren't for the good things that came out of the Catholic Church.

This film leaves no stone unturned.This film is extremely exhaustive with chapter titles;The Gospel Record; The Roman Church; Dominic and the Inquisition; The Pilgrim Church; John Wycliffe; The Great Reformation; William Tyndale; Tyndale to King James;Enter The Jesuits; and The King James Bible.It documents dates and sources from which it derives its information.  Not only does it compile its history from reliable sources...this is perfectly scriptural in its presentation of Biblical Christianity's history.  This film is a breathe of fresh air when it comes to a solid historical viewpoint.  It does not set forth politically correct views regarding the Catholic church or their historical doctrines.

1297532,A2GA7FLT91IWLV,B002XAZ87K,thechrisaccount,"[72, 76]","This film is three hours jam packed with information about the history of the Bible, and the blood that was shed so that our generation could read it.  Sadly, too few Christians really understand the sacrifice of the saints who have come before us, especially during the Inquisition era.  ""A Lamp in the Dark"" has been called a ""sure cure for Christian apathy,"" and does not pull any punches in revealing the uncomfortable truth of the Dark Ages.The production goes on location to England and Belgium, to the British Library and the William Tyndale Museum, the site where Tyndale was strangled and burnt at the stake, and then Erasmus House in Anderlecht.  There are original interviews with the curators of these museums who explain significant facts about the history of Textus Receptus and the development of the English Bible.  There is a lot of footage of ancient manuscripts and even a replica of the jail cell where Tyndale was kept before he was put to death.  The film really gives a timeline of the Bible from the first century up through the Middle Ages, climaxing with the King James Bible of 1611, and showing that the reason Rome hates the KJV is because it represents the collective work of the Protestant Reformation.The documentary also seems designed as a witnessing tool to Roman Catholics, since it confronts some of the key doctrines of the Catholic Church, including transubstantiation, papal authority and the veneration of Mary.  The producers were careful to focus their commentary on the teachings of the Reformers, and show clearly how the faith of modern Evangelical Christians developed by recovering the original teachings of the Bible.  Also, events of the past are often linked to modern events, showing how the Reformation continues to impact Europe and America today, through things like the European Union and the Emerging Church.  Shocking information and detailed quotes are presented about the popes, which every Christian and Catholic should know.There is also a detailed history of the Jesuit Order and the Counter Reformation begun by them.  Some of the Jesuits history in the modern world, with the Lincoln assassination and during World War II with Hitler is also shown.The film is done in a History Channel ""style"" with a variety of interviews cross-cut with dramatic re-enactments of certain historical events.",5,A powerful history revealed,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,2355,"['film', 'three', 'hours', 'jam', 'packed', 'information', 'history', 'Bible', 'blood', 'was', 'shed', 'so', 'generation', 'could', 'read', 'Sadly', 'too', 'few', 'Christians', 'really', 'understand', 'sacrifice', 'saints', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'especially', 'Inquisition', 'era', 'Lamp', 'Dark', 'been', 'called', 'sure', 'cure', 'Christian', 'apathy', 'not', 'pull', 'punches', 'revealing', 'uncomfortable', 'truth', 'Dark', 'Ages.The', 'production', 'location', 'England', 'Belgium', 'British', 'Library', 'William', 'Tyndale', 'Museum', 'site', 'where', 'Tyndale', 'was', 'strangled', 'burnt', 'stake', 'then', 'Erasmus', 'House', 'Anderlecht', 'are', 'original', 'interviews', 'curators', 'museums', 'who', 'explain', 'significant', 'facts', 'history', 'Textus', 'Receptus', 'development', 'English', 'Bible', 'lot', 'footage', 'ancient', 'manuscripts', 'even', 'replica', 'jail', 'cell', 'where', 'Tyndale', 'was', 'kept', 'was', 'put', 'death', 'film', 'really', 'timeline', 'Bible', 'first', 'century', 'up', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'climaxing', 'King', 'James', 'Bible', '1611', 'showing', 'reason', 'Rome', 'KJV', 'collective', 'work', 'Protestant', 'Reformation.The', 'documentary', 'also', 'designed', 'witnessing', 'tool', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'key', 'doctrines', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'including', 'transubstantiation', 'papal', 'authority', 'veneration', 'Mary', 'producers', 'were', 'careful', 'focus', 'commentary', 'teachings', 'Reformers', 'show', 'clearly', 'how', 'faith', 'modern', 'Evangelical', 'Christians', 'developed', 'recovering', 'original', 'teachings', 'Bible', 'Also', 'events', 'past', 'are', 'often', 'linked', 'modern', 'events', 'showing', 'how', 'Reformation', 'impact', 'Europe', 'America', 'today', 'things', 'European', 'Union', 'Emerging', 'Church', 'Shocking', 'information', 'detailed', 'quotes', 'are', 'presented', 'popes', 'Christian', 'Catholic', 'should', 'know.There', 'also', 'detailed', 'history', 'Jesuit', 'Order', 'Counter', 'Reformation', 'begun', 'Jesuits', 'history', 'modern', 'world', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Hitler', 'also', 'shown.The', 'film', 'done', 'History', 'Channel', 'style', 'variety', 'interviews', 'cross-cut', 'dramatic', 're-enactments', 'certain', 'historical', 'events']",A Lamp in the Dark: The Untold History of the Bible

Anyway I got the digital version on  the instant video and also Purchased the disk again. They both work well.If you are seeking the truth about the history of Christianity from it's beginning to now This is a very good documentary to explain it. I also would like to recommend another part to this series that I've just learned about. it's called &#34; Tares among the Wheat&#34;. This too is also an excellent guide to the truth of Christianity and how it's emerged into what it is today that is the main stream version of Christianity. You need to watch them with an open mind, don't go by how you have been taught because for most of us it might get upset if you have strict beliefs. Lamp in the dark gives a good description of how our bibles have evolved into what it is today. The history of how it got this way. And lets you know about the lives of those to helped write them. Tares in the wheat it too continues on with more information that the Lamp in the dark just didn't have time enough to explain. From what I've been told there is a third part. I believe it mentions that in the credits at the end. These are documentary's that most churches would not like it if you were to watch it. So if you dare to find the truth on your own, rather than rely on your church, and blindly follow. Myself I follow the bible and look up what people say to be fact and I follow what the word says. ( 1 Thessalonians 5:21 prove all things; hold fast that which is good; ) I believe in the bible and follow that as my guide. The King James/ The Geneva Bible/ and the NIV are good ones for study. I like using them as my guide rather than to trust my soul to someone that collects tithe every Sunday. Mainly cause that's their motivation to their version of their truth. The digital copy the instant video on Amazon works excellent on here and I believe you could rent it instead of buying. This is an excellent documentary not a Hollywood production. So you are getting your money's worth on this.
