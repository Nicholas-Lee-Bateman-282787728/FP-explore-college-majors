729427,A2WCY11WAGBXBX,B00007JMCZ,Aileen,"[2, 2]","Our son is a big Thomas fan, and he really loves this new DVD from the Thomas and Friends series.  This one introduces a new character, Elizabeth, who is Sir Tophamm Hatt's first truck.In the first story, Percy's Chocolate Crunch, there is a water shortage.  Since Percy has been doing a lot of dirty work, he complains that isn't always clean like he wants to be.  His driver suggests that they take some cars loaded with sugar to the chocolate factory, but chaos ensues.In Thomas, Percy and the Squeak, Thomas is chosen to take the famous singer Alicia Botti to her concert.  She refuses to go with Thomas when she sees a mouse in one of his coaches.  Percy then comes to her rescue.In Gordon Takes a Tumble, Gordon shows Salty that he's ""too big for his buffers"" and disobeys a few signs telling him to go slow when he is accidentally switched onto a branch line.  An accident then occurs.In Buffer Bother, Ben needs new buffers.  Bill, his twin, is jealous because he wants them too.In Middle Engine, Percy falls for Iron 'Arry and Iron Bert's devious tricks.In Faulty Whistle, Duncan tries to show off by tooting his whistle too much.  It then comes loose and flies off when he tries to give Terence the Tractor ""the loudest whistle yet"".  A man who plays the organ then comes to Duncan's rescue (he has been riding with Duncan and offers to play his organ because it's too dangerous to travel without a whistle to alert the stations).I definitely recommend this DVD in addition to the rest of the Thomas series.  It also has a cute little song called Little Engines.  Also, the bonus features are worth trying out as well.",4,A Real Chocolate Treat for our 20 Month Old!,1050451200,"04 16, 2003",2003,1628,"['son', 'big', 'Thomas', 'fan', 'really', 'new', 'DVD', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'series', 'one', 'new', 'character', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'Sir', 'Tophamm', 'Hatt', 'first', 'truck.In', 'first', 'story', 'Percy', 'Chocolate', 'Crunch', 'water', 'shortage', 'Percy', 'been', 'doing', 'lot', 'dirty', 'work', ""n't"", 'always', 'clean', 'be', 'driver', 'take', 'cars', 'loaded', 'sugar', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'chaos', 'ensues.In', 'Thomas', 'Percy', 'Squeak', 'Thomas', 'chosen', 'take', 'famous', 'singer', 'Alicia', 'Botti', 'concert', 'go', 'Thomas', 'when', 'mouse', 'one', 'coaches', 'Percy', 'then', 'rescue.In', 'Gordon', 'Takes', 'Tumble', 'Gordon', 'Salty', 'too', 'big', 'buffers', 'disobeys', 'few', 'signs', 'telling', 'go', 'slow', 'when', 'accidentally', 'switched', 'branch', 'line', 'accident', 'then', 'Buffer', 'Bother', 'Ben', 'new', 'buffers', 'Bill', 'twin', 'jealous', 'too.In', 'Middle', 'Engine', 'Percy', 'Iron', ""'Arry"", 'Iron', 'Bert', 'devious', 'tricks.In', 'Faulty', 'Whistle', 'Duncan', 'show', 'off', 'tooting', 'whistle', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'loose', 'flies', 'off', 'when', 'give', 'Terence', 'Tractor', 'loudest', 'whistle', 'yet', 'man', 'who', 'organ', 'then', 'Duncan', 'rescue', 'been', 'riding', 'Duncan', 'play', 'organ', 'too', 'dangerous', 'travel', 'whistle', 'alert', 'stations', '.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'addition', 'rest', 'Thomas', 'series', 'also', 'cute', 'little', 'song', 'called', 'Little', 'Engines', 'Also', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'worth', 'trying', 'out', 'as', 'well']",N/A

But my little one really loves his trains so he was quite excited about Percy going through the chocolate factory.  It's a really cute video.  But, why on earth do the creators find it necessary to teach our children to call each other names and make fun of each other?  Why is this always the underlying current in all of these Thomas videos?  I just don't understand it or see a need to promote something that they learn soon enough and you have to correct one school starts.  I wish these videos showed positive interaction between the trains and how they should act instead of acting poorly as if that is how we all should behave.  It doesn't add to the storyline nor does it help teaching manners at home when you hear, ""Well Thomas said it.""  Where do you go from there?Anyway, this one is definitely an improvement over our first Thomas video.  Alec Baldwin does a wonderful job on the narration of this - his acting ability is a definite asset over choosing one of the Beatles or George Carlin.
