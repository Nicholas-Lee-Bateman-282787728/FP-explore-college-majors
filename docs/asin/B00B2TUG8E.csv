As you watch the film, you grow to care about these kids--some are adults now, but that makes it more tragic to realize what they have gone through to survive. During the filming of Mother India, the filmmakers were presented an opportunity to a tour of the Harvest India campus and children's home in Tenali. Suresh Kumar and his wife, Christina of Harvest India helped expedite matters, but it further heightened my awareness of the complexities involved in helping these children and the glimmer of hope that can be offered. You feel overwhelmed as you watch at the enormity of it all, but even helping one or two can make an impact on those who will need help in the future. It is always better to do something rather than nothing.This is not a film for young viewers. Some of the topics are drug abuse, sexuality, violence, and HIV/AIDS. You hear children talk of being used for sex, drug use is shown, and wounds from abuse. Nor is this a film aimed only at a Christian audience, but is intended to bring awareness to all about the plight of these kids. If your family, church, or organization are wanting to be involved with a ministry, watch this film and you will realize the needs to be met.YOU can...- Spread the word.- Sponsor a child.- Serve with organizations who are helping orphans in India.I received this movie free from Word Films as part of their Blogger Review Program, via Blogger Gateway.

1621317,A2Y2CUMX2MUCU7,B00B2TUG8E,Joshua Lake,"[0, 1]","This particular documentary shines a whole new light on the life of the orphan in India, specifically the street orphan. David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha, first-time filmmakers, made this documentary by spending two weeks in India with a small group of street orphans. In India alone there are over 31 million orphans. To bring perspective, a friend of ours pointed out, that's close to as many people there are in  all of Canada.As you get to know each of these children and young adults, it is heart breaking to hear their stories. Many of them are abandoned, including the littlest 3 and 5 year olds, and have memories of their parents leaving them. You watch them beg for money on the local train, find ways to laugh together, and use almost any method to numb their pain. It makes you cringe as they tell stories of the violence experienced at the hands of other children on the street.David and Shawn are able to end on a somewhat hopeful note, but I definitely left feeling emotionally spent. This brings me my only real caution before you watch this: if you have a weak stomach, be forewarned, there are both graphic stories and filming of drug use and injuries that can be overwhelming. These things don't normally bother me, but possibly because the filming is of children, it gets pretty heavy, pretty fast.Overall, the documentary is educational and interesting. My main reason for giving this only a 3-star rating is this: I left sad, really sad, but kind of hopeless. I don't feel the filmmakers did a thorough job in helping us think together how to truly help the children in India. Maybe there isn't a viable way to help, other than sponsoring a child, but when the only wrap-up message was to sponsor a child it started to feel a little like a World Vision or Compassion International advertisement. I am not saying either of those organizations are unimportant or don't do great things for children worldwide, but for me it wasn't enough to feel a crowd would move to action. To sponsor a child they must be in an orphanage, but these children were not in an orphanage, and were abandoned late enough in life that most orphanages in India would not take them. There must be some other way to help a country that considers millions of children to really not even be human. The documentary will stir your heart, but I just didn't feel satisfied that the solution presented connected with the problem shown throughout the documentary.",3,A Review of Mother India,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2451,"['particular', 'documentary', 'shines', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'life', 'orphan', 'India', 'specifically', 'street', 'orphan', 'David', 'Trotter', 'Shawn', 'Scheinoha', 'first-time', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'documentary', 'spending', 'two', 'weeks', 'India', 'small', 'group', 'street', 'orphans', 'India', 'alone', 'are', '31', 'million', 'orphans', 'bring', 'perspective', 'friend', 'ours', 'pointed', 'out', 'close', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'Canada.As', 'get', 'know', 'children', 'young', 'adults', 'heart', 'breaking', 'hear', 'stories', 'Many', 'are', 'abandoned', 'including', 'littlest', '3', '5', 'year', 'olds', 'have', 'memories', 'parents', 'leaving', 'watch', 'beg', 'money', 'local', 'train', 'find', 'ways', 'laugh', 'together', 'use', 'almost', 'method', 'numb', 'pain', 'cringe', 'tell', 'stories', 'violence', 'experienced', 'hands', 'other', 'children', 'street.David', 'Shawn', 'are', 'able', 'end', 'somewhat', 'hopeful', 'note', 'definitely', 'left', 'feeling', 'emotionally', 'spent', 'only', 'real', 'caution', 'watch', 'have', 'weak', 'stomach', 'be', 'forewarned', 'are', 'graphic', 'stories', 'filming', 'drug', 'use', 'injuries', 'can', 'be', 'overwhelming', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'bother', 'possibly', 'filming', 'children', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'pretty', 'fast.Overall', 'documentary', 'educational', 'interesting', 'main', 'reason', 'giving', 'only', '3-star', 'rating', 'left', 'sad', 'really', 'sad', 'kind', 'hopeless', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'thorough', 'job', 'helping', 'think', 'together', 'how', 'truly', 'help', 'children', 'India', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'viable', 'way', 'help', 'other', 'sponsoring', 'child', 'when', 'only', 'wrap-up', 'message', 'was', 'sponsor', 'child', 'started', 'feel', 'little', 'World', 'Vision', 'Compassion', 'International', 'advertisement', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'organizations', 'are', 'unimportant', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'things', 'children', 'worldwide', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'feel', 'crowd', 'would', 'move', 'action', 'sponsor', 'child', 'must', 'be', 'orphanage', 'children', 'were', 'not', 'orphanage', 'were', 'abandoned', 'late', 'enough', 'life', 'most', 'orphanages', 'India', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'must', 'be', 'other', 'way', 'help', 'country', 'millions', 'children', 'really', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'human', 'documentary', 'will', 'stir', 'heart', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'satisfied', 'solution', 'presented', 'connected', 'problem', 'shown', 'documentary']",Mother India: Life Through the Eyes of the Orphan

India has over 31 million orphans, so this film is just a brief glimpse into the lives of a handful of the orphans. Some of these kids - living in a family-type group - have no parents while others come from abusive families. Many of these children have HIV/Aids. While spending time with these children, David Trotter and Shawn Scheinoha feel lead to try to help two of the younger kids in the group, so they call on Harvest India for some help. They have some hurdles (including getting permission from the older kids in the group) to jump through to allow it to happen.It was sad to see how these kids were living, but it was even harder seeing the drugs abuse, huffing, and physical abuse they dealt with on a regular basis. I was surprised that they actually showed the exact products and how the kids went about huffing. They also showed the kids shooting up ""something"" as the kids didn't even now what was in the syringes.MotherIndia is not a light movie due to the topics covered, but it's done well and brings to the forefront the needs of the many orphans in India. It closes with how you can help combat the problems these kids face.
