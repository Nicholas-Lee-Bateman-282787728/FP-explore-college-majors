It makes me think of my inspirations and once I did not know that Kevin Kline narrated that. I did not know who was in there until I felt like I was ready. Whenever I felt scared or something I say the kinds of delights the sugar plum fairy brought out. I like the part where the Snowfflakes were dancing and also the part where Marie knew it was her Godfather. I even saw some versions of The Nutcracker and out of all of them, I like this one. Later before I had it, I just chose not to see it but once I found it at the Public Library, I was like, ""Come About!"" and I was so excited. When I saw this first I noticed that it was absolute silence with nothing but music and ballet dancing and nobody, not one, except Kline who narrates it.

365004,A396SBGKAOLTZE,6303224407,Chris Aldridge,"[8, 8]","I can easily give this DVD four stars- maybe even five in time. This tale is interesting to dissect, because there are apparently two camps for this very famous, 110 year-old ballet: those who like it as a children's story and those who like it as an adult's. It's been staged both ways in the past, as others have already mentioned (and I won't repeat here, I promise). This version, which allows the kids to be front and center, has some stellar 'adult' moments in it: the Act 1 finale dance of the snowflakes, while not adult in content, is the personification of sophistication and beauty with its ice-blue lighting and costuming and multiracial corps de ballet. A beautiful sequence of dance which stands on its own, and which you'd enjoy replaying. The other moment comes in the second act, when the relatively innocent dances of various sweets give way to the Arabian solo of Wendy Whelan. The pink-and-purple lighting, the floating camera work, and the dancer's sexy, serpent-like movements (jeeez!!) do not resemble any other moment in this already polished film, and one can't help but think that either the director or the choreographer wanted it that way. (It's like watching Ann Reinking, Vicki Frederick, or Carol Haney on the Broadway stage.) As far as Macaulay Culkin- it didn't bother me since he was the right age (12) at the time of filming, and, frankly, he looks bored in *most* films he's in.

365005,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,6303224407,drkhimxz,"[5, 9]","There is another listing for the Nutcracker suite bearing an almost identical disc cover (save for the printing in the open mouth)which has nothing to do with this film version. From reviews there, it appears to be a non-professionally recorded version taken from the audience of the staged Balanchine performance.Certainly, I have nothing to add to the other reviews as to the content. As far as I was concerned, never have seen the staged version by the NYC Ballet, this is what it purports to be, a film taking what it can from Balanchine but a film in its own right to be seen as that. As a ballet, certainly it would be better to have the children played by adults, as a movie it makes sense to have it as it is (I assume this is true for the projected audience for the film). What we see of the children dancing is charming, for children dancing. None stood out as the next Gelcey kirkland, but then, who can tell at that age. Where the NYC Ballet appears, in adaptations by Peter Martins, who succeeded Balanchine, they look good in lush settings appropriate to the season.I can only guess at how well the film goes over with various age groups and types of audience; my guess is, that it will be fully appreciated by people who fully appreciate this sort of film.

365010,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,6303224407,J. Lizzi,"[127, 130]","All things considered, I have to say that this is quite an enjoyable theatrical presentation of Balanchine's &quot;The Nutcracker.&quot;  Looking at &quot;the show&quot; itself, its most rave-worthy characteristic is how well the team of Peter Martins (ballet master), Emile Ardolino (director) and Ralf Bode (cinematographer) collaborated to actually &quot;choreograph the camera&quot; to the movements of the performers.  Thanks to a talented movie crew and an incredible amount of consideration given to viewing angles (read the description in the disc's &quot;special features&quot;), the TV always seemed to be showing exactly what I wanted to look at on the stage.  Add in some nice work by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, decent narration, and a top-notch production team, and the result is a superb presentation.From a performance standpoint, I'd give this an A-minus mainly because the versions of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; I've seen most often cast the Nutcracker Prince in a much more active role dancewise.  Still, everyone else did a fantastic job.  Noteworthy were the Pas de Deux by the Cavalier (Damian Woetzel) and Sugarplum Fairy (Darci Kistler), and the powerful dance presence of Coffee (Wendy Whelan).  The other &quot;Sweets&quot; performed very well also.  So long as you try not to picture Macaulay Culkin as a ballet dancer, you'll be okay.  Let's face it:  you can't expect the little guy to measure up next to the NYC Ballet, but he is there to add a little star appeal and possibly sell ballet to your kids (which may not be a bad idea).  Nuff said.  By the way, the younger performers from the School of American Ballet were wonderful.Regarding disc features, the DVD has some cool stuff to offer:  two viewing formats, 30-scene index, and some good production notes regarding the history of the show, camera choreography and description of ILM's special effects.",5,Impressive production; all-around fine performance; good DVD,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,1891,"['things', 'considered', 'have', 'say', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'theatrical', 'presentation', 'Balanchine', 'quot', 'Nutcracker.', 'quot', 'Looking', 'quot', 'show', 'quot', 'most', 'rave-worthy', 'characteristic', 'how', 'well', 'team', 'Peter', 'Martins', 'ballet', 'master', 'Emile', 'Ardolino', 'director', 'Ralf', 'Bode', 'cinematographer', 'collaborated', 'actually', 'quot', 'choreograph', 'camera', 'quot', 'movements', 'performers', 'Thanks', 'talented', 'movie', 'crew', 'incredible', 'amount', 'consideration', 'given', 'viewing', 'angles', 'read', 'description', 'disc', 'quot', 'special', 'features', 'quot', 'TV', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'showing', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'look', 'stage', 'Add', 'nice', 'work', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'amp', 'Magic', 'decent', 'narration', 'top-notch', 'production', 'team', 'result', 'superb', 'performance', 'standpoint', ""'d"", 'give', 'A-minus', 'mainly', 'versions', 'quot', 'Nutcracker', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'often', 'cast', 'Nutcracker', 'Prince', 'much', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'dancewise', 'Still', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'were', 'Pas', 'de', 'Deux', 'Cavalier', 'Damian', 'Woetzel', 'Sugarplum', 'Fairy', 'Darci', 'Kistler', 'powerful', 'dance', 'presence', 'Coffee', 'Wendy', 'Whelan', 'other', 'quot', 'Sweets', 'quot', 'performed', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'So', 'long', 'try', 'not', 'picture', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'ballet', 'dancer', ""'ll"", 'be', 'okay', 'Let', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'little', 'guy', 'measure', 'up', 'next', 'NYC', 'Ballet', 'there', 'add', 'little', 'star', 'appeal', 'possibly', 'sell', 'ballet', 'kids', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'idea', 'Nuff', 'said', 'way', 'younger', 'performers', 'School', 'American', 'Ballet', 'were', 'wonderful.Regarding', 'disc', 'features', 'DVD', 'cool', 'stuff', 'offer', 'two', 'viewing', 'formats', '30-scene', 'index', 'good', 'production', 'notes', 'regarding', 'history', 'show', 'camera', 'choreography', 'description', 'ILM', 'special', 'effects']",George Balanchine's The Nutcracker VHS

365014,A308QC9XPFHFGJ,6303224407,"Malfoyfan ""Cath""","[0, 0]","I wanted to view this recording of Balanchine's Nutcracker ballet because of a book I've owned for a long time called A Very Young Dancer, a photo essay documenting a young ballet student's participation in this production, back in the 70s.The production and filming of it are overall good - the DVD picture is fine and the photography is good - it's not easy to capture dance on film - some productions edit too much or don't focus on the whole dancer.  Some reviewers have noted that the production looks a little dated, but for me that's part of its charm.  It's true that the costumes and sets haven't changed much over the years, judging by photos I have seen, but I like that it has that continuity.I don't like the narration, but I think it's good to have it for first-time viewers and kids so they understand the story line.I wouldn't have cast Macauley Culkin, but I realize they probably did it because he was well-known at the time and I imagine the filmmakers were thinking that a &#34;name&#34; would bring in people who don't normally watch ballet.  I'd have preferred an anonymous young dancer, the way it would be in the actual stage production.As far as the performances, the child dancers sometimes look nervous or stiff - understandable because they're kids and if one were watching the performance on stage, their faces would be too far away to see the expressions.  I like the fact that Balanchine used children in his productions when it was appropriate, rather than short dancers impersonating children.  As for the adults - WOW!  The &#34;Coffee&#34; dance and the Sugar Plum Fairy/Cavalier pas de deux are worth the price of the DVD alone.  Both are absolutely breathtaking.  The &#34;tree angels&#34; were great - I loved how they looked like they were floating across the stage.  The rest of the cast are across-the-board very good too.If watching this with kids, bear in mind that the first part is mostly the party scene and there isn't much dance.  I got a little bored and I can see kids losing interest quickly.  It really picks up in the &#34;land of sweets&#34; second act.  While I was watching, I kept thinking that I prefer the first act of Baryshnikov's Nutcracker and the second act of this one.  It's probably better live - most things like this are - but as I said, I think it's worth watching for the performances of the adult dancers alone.I think this recording is valuable because we need to preserve performance - whether dance, music, or theater - as a cultural reference for the future.  I would highly recommend watching this if you are a ballet fan or if you have an aspiring dancer in the house.  It's also fun to watch the other well-known version starring Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland and compare the two, as I was doing in my head while watching this one.

There really aren't that many versions out there.  Baryshnikov's is not a very child friendly version.  Yes it's true, this does not have the precision of some of the other corps but this version is really geared to young children.  And it's a great version for them to see.2.  It is a plus that it features many child dancers.  It allows children to see others like them dancing.  Additionally, a big bonus is that there are acutally boys dancing male parts - parents of boys who love ballet like myself will appreciate this.3.  Yes, Culkinis a bad dancer but as someone else noted - if it  helps sell the movie, then it gets ballet out to more people which is a plus (I personally think it's better than a Barbie doll version of Swan Lake).  Again, for parents of boy dancers, it's nice to see a boy with a real dancing part.4.  The main character is called Marie because that's her name in the original book by ETA Hoffman (which by the way, is a VERY different story from the one we traditionally see in the ballet.  It's a great book and for a special treat of the video performance of the real story see the Milwaukee Orchestra's Notes Alive: The Nutcracker:  The Untold Story, based on Maurice Sendak's illustrations).  In the original story, Clara is one of Marie's dolls.5.  I did not find Culkin's expressions to be disinterested or bored.  To the contrary, I was impressed with  his focus and respect throughout the show.  There is a nice photo text book that accompanies this video.  The book explains that the expression on his face early in the show may be his attempt to show that he is different, more refined, than the other more boisterous boys at the party including Fritz, Marie's brother.",4,Good choice for young children,1085616000,"05 27, 2004",2004,1931,"['have', 'young', 'child', 'who', 'see', 'Nutcracker', 'home', 'version', 'buy', 'bought', '3', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'loved', 'ballet', 'Here', 'are', 'selling', 'points', 'comments', 'previous', 'remarks1', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'versions', 'out', 'there', 'Baryshnikov', 'not', 'very', 'child', 'friendly', 'version', 'Yes', 'true', 'not', 'have', 'precision', 'other', 'corps', 'version', 'really', 'geared', 'young', 'children', 'great', 'version', 'see.2', 'plus', 'many', 'child', 'dancers', 'children', 'see', 'others', 'dancing', 'Additionally', 'big', 'bonus', 'are', 'acutally', 'boys', 'dancing', 'male', 'parts', 'parents', 'boys', 'who', 'love', 'ballet', 'will', 'appreciate', 'this.3', 'Yes', 'Culkinis', 'bad', 'dancer', 'someone', 'else', 'noted', 'sell', 'movie', 'then', 'ballet', 'out', 'more', 'people', 'plus', 'personally', 'think', 'better', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'version', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'Again', 'parents', 'boy', 'dancers', 'nice', 'see', 'boy', 'real', 'dancing', 'part.4', 'main', 'character', 'called', 'Marie', 'name', 'original', 'book', 'ETA', 'Hoffman', 'way', 'VERY', 'different', 'story', 'one', 'traditionally', 'see', 'ballet', 'great', 'book', 'special', 'treat', 'video', 'performance', 'real', 'story', 'see', 'Milwaukee', 'Orchestra', 'Notes', 'Alive', 'Nutcracker', 'Untold', 'Story', 'based', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'illustrations', 'original', 'story', 'Clara', 'one', 'Marie', 'dolls.5', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'Culkin', 'expressions', 'be', 'disinterested', 'bored', 'contrary', 'was', 'impressed', 'focus', 'respect', 'show', 'nice', 'photo', 'text', 'book', 'video', 'book', 'expression', 'face', 'early', 'show', 'may', 'be', 'attempt', 'show', 'different', 'more', 'refined', 'other', 'more', 'boisterous', 'boys', 'party', 'including', 'Fritz', 'Marie', 'brother']",George Balanchine's The Nutcracker VHS

I'll never forget how enthralling it was to see the Christmas tree growing accompanied by Tchaikovsky's incredible music. It could be argued persuasively that it is the finest staging of the work ever conceived. I've not seen one to equal it!This DVD is a beautiful document of the classic production. No expense has been spared in bringing the production to life. The costumes and the sets are as I remember them. A few sections have been done by ILM to enhance the video presentation of essentially a stage work. The ballet flows beautifully. Video quality is excellent; vibrant colors and clear picture unlike alot of ballet videos.The dancing couldn't be finer. The cast is attractive and energetic including the children. The presence of Mr. Culkin does not detract at all from the quality of the performance. He's there to help sell the thing and he is just fine.The NYC Ballet Orchestra has been playing this score for decades and their mastery of it under Zinman's baton is evident throughout. This is simply gorgeously played and rivals any other Nutcacker played by world class orchestras.A benefit to the proceedings is the fact that Zinman is conducting an actual balletic performance and his zippy tempi add just the right amount of panache. It is a very transparent reading and makes Tchaikovsky's delicious orchestrations sound like a shiny new car! The dancer's tempi doesn't mean that there is a lack of ""symphonic"" presence. The recording engineers have done a beautiful job in capturing the majesty of the performance as well.If you love the Nutcracker, this DVD is essential. We are fortunate to have Balanchine's masterpiece so beautifully documented for posterity!

365026,A3FT799OERFPOX,6303224407,R. G. Rosa,"[6, 6]","Was Balanchine the most imaginative choreographer of the 20thCentury?I think so.How many of us have seen the Nutcracker ? Since it is such a staple and so popular with community and school groups, I would say that a huge percentage of us have seen it in one form or another.But I don't think anyone has put together a more creative, magical version than Balanchine.There are many Nutcracker DVDs available, many different approaches to the piece, but this is the one that I like best.This film is a fairly exact, expanded for film, version of the stage production that the NYC Ballet puts on stage for about 6 weeks each year during the holiday season. Although the Balanchine version is now 50 years old, it is still fresh and endlessly entertaining.Although the first act can often be uninteresting with so much of it being pantomime, Balanchine treats the two lead children as the main players. Balanchine wisely casts Marie/Masha/Clara(the girl has different names in different versions) as a child rather than have an adult ballerina play the role. Most ballerinas can't stand the close scrutiny and tend to look ridiculous as a child. Perhaps the only exception here is the latest Royal Ballet version with Alina Cojocaru, if any ballerina has the looks and charm of a little girl, she has.But this version is spoiled with Anthony Dowell's fussy, hammy Drosselmeyer. Some one needs to take that cape away from him, he fiddles and swirls it endlessly.Back to Balanchine. I don't think there has been any version of the mouse fight that is more fun. I love how the mice cheer from the sidelines as the King Mouse seems to be winning the battle with the soldiers.All the adult dancers are very effective in their roles and again Balanchine's great imagination comes into play with the wonderful staging of the Act 2 divertissments in the Land of the Sweets.Just a few quibbles. I can understand the logic of casting Macaulay Culkin as the young prince with his box office draw. But he is the single biggest flaw here. The young prince has been done far less self consciously by other children from the SAB.Balanchine painstakingly recreated the young prince's famous mime scene in Act 2 where he describes so beautifully the battle scene with the mice. As a child, Balanchine knew this from the early 20th century Kirov production under what was still the Imperial Russian Era. In the theater this scene has tremendous effect , the children in the audience inevitably break into cheers.Here Caulkin does the mime in a fuzzy, sloppy , unmusical manner. This blunts the impact of one of the major scenes. He also lacks the grace of movement needed here.Also, although I'm sure the effect was to open up the ballet for film, I dislike the bed flying through the air as the children leave the house and go into the snowy forest. The effect is somewhat cheesy, the directer should have stayed closer to the stage version where the house vanishes and the children walk immediately into the forest where the snow starts falling. It's a magical effect that is missing here.Still, let me not appear to quibble too much. This is a wonderful DVD and both adults and children will enjoy it immensely",5,A  Tasty Treat from the Land of the Sweets.,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,3190,"['Was', 'Balanchine', 'most', 'imaginative', 'choreographer', '20thCentury', 'think', 'so.How', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'Nutcracker', 'such', 'staple', 'so', 'popular', 'community', 'school', 'groups', 'would', 'say', 'huge', 'percentage', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'form', 'another.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'put', 'together', 'more', 'creative', 'magical', 'version', 'Balanchine.There', 'are', 'many', 'Nutcracker', 'DVDs', 'available', 'many', 'different', 'approaches', 'piece', 'one', 'like', 'best.This', 'film', 'fairly', 'exact', 'expanded', 'film', 'version', 'stage', 'production', 'NYC', 'Ballet', 'stage', 'about', '6', 'weeks', 'year', 'holiday', 'season', 'Balanchine', 'version', 'now', '50', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'fresh', 'endlessly', 'first', 'act', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'uninteresting', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'pantomime', 'Balanchine', 'two', 'lead', 'children', 'main', 'players', 'Balanchine', 'wisely', 'Marie/Masha/Clara', 'girl', 'different', 'names', 'different', 'versions', 'child', 'rather', 'have', 'adult', 'ballerina', 'play', 'role', 'Most', 'ballerinas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'tend', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'child', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'exception', 'here', 'latest', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'version', 'Alina', 'Cojocaru', 'ballerina', 'looks', 'charm', 'little', 'girl', 'has.But', 'version', 'spoiled', 'Anthony', 'Dowell', 'fussy', 'hammy', 'Drosselmeyer', 'one', 'take', 'cape', 'away', 'swirls', 'endlessly.Back', 'Balanchine', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'been', 'version', 'mouse', 'fight', 'more', 'fun', 'love', 'how', 'mice', 'cheer', 'sidelines', 'King', 'Mouse', 'be', 'winning', 'battle', 'soldiers.All', 'adult', 'dancers', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'roles', 'again', 'Balanchine', 'great', 'imagination', 'play', 'wonderful', 'staging', 'Act', '2', 'divertissments', 'Land', 'Sweets.Just', 'few', 'quibbles', 'can', 'understand', 'logic', 'casting', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'young', 'prince', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'single', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'here', 'young', 'prince', 'been', 'done', 'far', 'less', 'self', 'consciously', 'other', 'children', 'SAB.Balanchine', 'painstakingly', 'recreated', 'young', 'prince', 'famous', 'mime', 'scene', 'Act', '2', 'where', 'so', 'beautifully', 'battle', 'scene', 'mice', 'child', 'Balanchine', 'knew', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Kirov', 'production', 'what', 'was', 'still', 'Imperial', 'Russian', 'Era', 'theater', 'scene', 'tremendous', 'effect', 'children', 'audience', 'inevitably', 'break', 'cheers.Here', 'Caulkin', 'mime', 'fuzzy', 'sloppy', 'unmusical', 'manner', 'impact', 'one', 'major', 'scenes', 'also', 'grace', 'movement', 'needed', 'here.Also', ""'m"", 'sure', 'effect', 'was', 'open', 'up', 'ballet', 'film', 'dislike', 'bed', 'flying', 'air', 'children', 'leave', 'house', 'go', 'snowy', 'forest', 'effect', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'directer', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'closer', 'stage', 'version', 'where', 'house', 'vanishes', 'children', 'walk', 'immediately', 'forest', 'where', 'snow', 'falling', 'magical', 'effect', 'missing', 'here.Still', 'let', 'not', 'appear', 'quibble', 'too', 'much', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'adults', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'immensely']",George Balanchine's The Nutcracker VHS

All that dancing gets so monotonous!  So it was startling to watch Emilio Ardolino's film version of George Balanchine's THE NUTCRACKER (1993) on videocassette and just adore it.  The sets and costumes, by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, use color to perfection.  The Tschaikovsky music is glorious.  And the dancing, by the New York Ballet, is outstanding.  I could even follow the story with just Susan Cooper's minimal narrative read by Kevin Kline.  It is a great ensemble cast, and Macauley Culkin fits in nicely as the Nutcracker Prince.  Bart Robinson Cook as Godfather Drosselmeier is magnificent, and newcomer Jessica Lynn Cohen is enchanting as Marie.I clearly don't have a lot of experience in stage NUTCRACKER's, or any live ballet.  A NUTCRACKER expert may pan it for something.  Leonard Maltin asininely called it ""much too stagey""!  Leonard, they call it filmed ballet!  Of course, it is stagey!  And this 1993 production is as good as ballet gets for me.  As someone at NEWSWEEK says on the front of the videocassette box, this is ""like having the best seats anyone ever had for THE NUTCRACKER.""
