1216518,A1CT884F9HEA8Q,B001M9OL5S,Luigi Facotti,"[8, 11]","The topic of trains is one of great interest despite the poor state of US railroads with the legend and the logic of railroads is a permanent part  of US history. What would DC be without the Metro or Chicago without the 'L""? This series while well intended and at times interesting is nothing if not reminiscent of the faux sports competition of various Gordon Ramsey kitchen projects or the numerous team sports on the Food Channel. The most positive to be said about the presenter is that at least he is confined to Maine and will not be sitting next to me on a flight.The topic has great potential but its presentation as ""We've got to get this train of produce to Schenectady by x hours"" as if the train were not running on a 365/24/7 schedule is inane - as if ""We"" including the presenter were a help and not a hinderance. A richness of subject matter and scenery is subsumed by moronic chit chat (or is that chit chat by a moron?) and superficiality. Amtrak's Acela is not even close to being among the world's fastest (or reliable) trains given the poor infrastructure, the freight trains are par for the  course with France and Germany equal in every respect except the latter don't derail as often. The program ignores the rich history of the stations (hey let's go to the rodeo in Cheyenne instead!!), the scenery, the fascinating history and technology of the infrastructure support (yes there is some but the commentary is by the idiot commentator - ""isn't this great"" not by the experts who as one reviewer noted appear to either cringe or ignore Mr. Matt). the future role of the railroad in the US - if the funding doesn't end up with the vampire squids in NYC etc. etc. Imagine the BBC or PBS doing this series - it would be sublime.

1216520,AORIU3JBETE3Q,B001M9OL5S,"Ransom Park ""ranger keith""","[6, 6]","This two disk set shows a lot of different trains and train operations. But it sometimes seemed this series is more about the host than the topic. His face fills the screen constantly, with quick cuts to different train operations. I saw a lot of quick glimpses into how things are done, but would have really enjoyed longer, more detailed shots of the hardware and shorter shots of the host. One thing for sure, I know what the host looks like while riding and working around trains. I'm certainly no expert, but I did hear one bit of information about train line brakes that was backwards (applying air to the train brake line applies the brakes, which it doesn't). Later on in another segment the host seems to get the correct script and mentions the actual way train brakes work. There's some interesting shots in a major locomotive repair facility, and in the railroad control center. Just be ready to see the technical stuff once the host moves his face out of the way. Did we get to see how a locomotive is started? No. Why they are rarely shut down? No. Close-up shots of the instrument panel, especially the ones with computer screens? No. All in all it's enjoyable and worth the price. But the camera crew was RIGHT THERE! They could have captured so much more, but missed it. If you're not interested in the technical stuff, than you'll probably be 100% satisfied. Otherwise, get ready to join the host close up and ride the rails (while looking over his shoulder).",4,It's very good but could have been better.,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,1476,"['two', 'disk', 'set', 'lot', 'different', 'trains', 'train', 'operations', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'series', 'more', 'host', 'topic', 'face', 'screen', 'constantly', 'quick', 'cuts', 'different', 'train', 'operations', 'saw', 'lot', 'quick', 'glimpses', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'longer', 'more', 'detailed', 'shots', 'hardware', 'shorter', 'shots', 'host', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'host', 'riding', 'working', 'around', 'trains', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'no', 'expert', 'did', 'hear', 'one', 'bit', 'information', 'train', 'line', 'brakes', 'was', 'backwards', 'applying', 'air', 'train', 'brake', 'line', 'brakes', ""n't"", 'Later', 'segment', 'host', 'get', 'correct', 'script', 'mentions', 'actual', 'way', 'train', 'brakes', 'work', 'interesting', 'shots', 'major', 'locomotive', 'repair', 'facility', 'railroad', 'control', 'center', 'Just', 'be', 'ready', 'see', 'technical', 'stuff', 'host', 'face', 'way', 'Did', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'locomotive', 'started', 'Why', 'are', 'rarely', 'shut', 'down', 'Close-up', 'shots', 'instrument', 'panel', 'especially', 'ones', 'computer', 'screens', 'enjoyable', 'worth', 'price', 'camera', 'crew', 'was', 'RIGHT', 'THERE', 'could', 'have', 'captured', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'missed', ""'re"", 'not', 'interested', 'technical', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', '100', '%', 'satisfied', 'Otherwise', 'get', 'ready', 'join', 'host', 'close', 'ride', 'rails', 'looking', 'shoulder']",N/A

It's the favorite show of my 4 year old who watches an episode at least daily, and knows more about the operations of railroads than most adults because of this show.The camera work is well done, and captures the hard steel and movement of a train. Matt Bown is a great host who adds excitement and his love of trains with the audience, giving great descriptions of the technical aspects of railroading.  You'll walk away from the show with a greater understanding of trains and a deeper love for them as well.The extras are nice, as there are some scenes from nearly every episode that never aired.
