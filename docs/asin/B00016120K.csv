This DVD is just a collection of the cast fooling around with bits here and there of them doing several different lawns. It's better than nothing.... but doesn't really give a good overall view of what this show is all about.,3,A little disappointed,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,287,"['love', 'Ground', 'Force', 'really', 'want', 'buy', 'series', 'DVD', 'just', 'collection', 'cast', 'fooling', 'bits', 'here', 'there', 'doing', 'several', 'different', 'lawns', 'better', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'good', 'overall', 'view', 'what', 'show']",The Best of Ground Force - Garden Rescues

794046,A3VGMX05HBFE88,B00016120K,"Mackie ""mackie3745""","[33, 34]","The BBC television series Ground Force is a whole lot more than a gardening show. Like Trading Spaces, the team has 48 hours to complete their transformation, usually turning a weedy back garden into a thing of beauty in the space of 48 hours. In between this miraculous accomplishment, there is much banter, the occasional argument, and even a rare, full-blown snit. The team is marvelous, the projects imaginative, and the results always spectacular. It's a wonderful show, much more interesting than the subject implies. Great views of Britain abound as well. However, this DVD just whets the appetite for more. DVD releases by season would be much appreciated!",4,Leaves You Hungering For More,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,664,"['BBC', 'television', 'series', 'Ground', 'Force', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'gardening', 'show', 'Trading', 'Spaces', 'team', '48', 'hours', 'complete', 'transformation', 'usually', 'turning', 'weedy', 'back', 'garden', 'thing', 'beauty', 'space', '48', 'hours', 'miraculous', 'accomplishment', 'much', 'banter', 'occasional', 'argument', 'even', 'rare', 'full-blown', 'snit', 'team', 'marvelous', 'projects', 'imaginative', 'results', 'always', 'spectacular', 'wonderful', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'subject', 'implies', 'Great', 'views', 'Britain', 'abound', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'DVD', 'just', 'appetite', 'more', 'DVD', 'releases', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'appreciated']",The Best of Ground Force - Garden Rescues
