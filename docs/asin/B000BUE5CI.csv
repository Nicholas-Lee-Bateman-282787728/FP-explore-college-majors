950170,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B000BUE5CI,"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster""","[12, 12]","Back in my younger days, I probably would've filled an entire wall of my house with VHS tapes of my favourite childhood TV shows - Knight Rider, Airwolf and, of course, the A-Team. Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, I can now store the first four seasons in a small corner of my shelf.Looking at the series through adult eyes, it's absolutely amazing to see just how well this show has stood the test of time. When I was young, I enjoyed the totally implausible but well-mounted action scenes. As an older and wiser man, I enjoy it for the charisma of its four main stars. They all have a sense of fun, camraderie and joie de vivre about life in general that you just don't find in shows nowadays.It's amazing to see just how popular these shows still are. Like everyone else, I sometimes wish they'd bring shows like this back. Characters like Michael Knight, Stringfellow Hawke, and Hannibal Smith and co. provided some truly great role models that most of todays modern TV shows sorely lack. I wouldn't have grown up to be the man I am today without them.",4,Still fun to watch and holds up extremely well,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,1067,"['Back', 'younger', 'days', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'filled', 'entire', 'wall', 'house', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'favourite', 'childhood', 'TV', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Airwolf', 'course', 'A-Team', 'Thanks', 'wonders', 'modern', 'technology', 'can', 'now', 'store', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'small', 'corner', 'shelf.Looking', 'series', 'adult', 'eyes', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'show', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'When', 'was', 'young', 'enjoyed', 'totally', 'implausible', 'well-mounted', 'action', 'scenes', 'older', 'wiser', 'man', 'enjoy', 'charisma', 'four', 'main', 'stars', 'have', 'sense', 'fun', 'camraderie', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'life', 'general', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'shows', 'nowadays.It', 'amazing', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'popular', 'shows', 'still', 'are', 'everyone', 'else', 'sometimes', 'wish', ""'d"", 'bring', 'shows', 'back', 'Characters', 'Michael', 'Knight', 'Stringfellow', 'Hawke', 'Hannibal', 'Smith', 'co.', 'provided', 'truly', 'great', 'role', 'models', 'most', 'todays', 'modern', 'TV', 'shows', 'sorely', 'lack', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'man', 'am', 'today']",N/A

950172,A1OZYQ4V83X8K4,B000BUE5CI,Brad Hutchinson,"[29, 30]","I bought this the day it came out and watched a couple of episodes without incident and then began watching ""The Bend In The River"" when the problems started. At 1 hour 10 minutes and 43 seconds into the episode right when Hannibal says ""sure"" the dvd just stopped and went to the main menu. The rest of the episode was missing...it just stopped so I tried it out on two other dvd players I have here and then figured I got a bad copy and went up to the store to exchange it. Well, once I got it home the second one did the same exact thing, so I exchanged it a third time. The third copy actually plays through the episode but freezes for about 5 seconds in the exact same place that the others were messed up. I haven't even gotten to the other 5 DVD's but my assumption from reading the reviews here is that they are going to have problems too.I can't understand how they release these seasons of the A-Team so painfully slow at Universal and can let something with this many errors reach the stores. In the 10 months since the release of Season 2 could they not have had some type of quality control make sure that the Season 3 DVD's actually played?This release has absolutely no bonus features unlike the Columbia House collectors edition ones, which have some outtakes and other things. And I have to wonder with this release just like the other two seasons why can they not put chapters in where the commercial breaks are instead of having to fast forward to get back to the spot I left off? Just like Season 2 these are double sided DVD's which scratch very easily and make all kinds of noises in the DVD player, I would have liked 6 single sided DVD's much better. And one last problem is that when you put the DVD you absolutely have to watch the Universal Studios introduction for about 10 seconds because you cannot skip it and access the menu.There are two good things I can say about this release the first being that it's the A-Team, which is the best television show of all time and this is probably my favorite season. The second good thing is that a coupon is enclosed for $5 off of Season 4 when it gets released. To have released this Season with this many errors and problems on the DVD's is an insult to A-Team fans everywhere who have waited 20+ years to buy this on DVD. Universal needs to recall all of them and issue working copies.Update: I have just gotten off the phone with Universal and they have said that they will replace the DVD for me and others who are having problems. You can call them at 972-293-5903 or email ushe.consumerrelations@worldmarkinc.com and put A-Team Season 3 replacement in the subject line. I have added a star to my review since they're customer service was friendly and returned my call promptly, but I have still subtracted a star for each trip I have made to the store.",2,"Best show ever, but DVD has problems!",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,2830,"['bought', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'watched', 'couple', 'episodes', 'incident', 'then', 'began', 'watching', 'Bend', 'River', 'when', 'problems', 'started', '1', 'hour', '10', 'minutes', '43', 'seconds', 'episode', 'right', 'when', 'Hannibal', 'sure', 'dvd', 'just', 'stopped', 'went', 'main', 'menu', 'rest', 'episode', 'was', 'missing', 'just', 'stopped', 'so', 'tried', 'out', 'two', 'other', 'dvd', 'players', 'have', 'here', 'then', 'figured', 'got', 'bad', 'copy', 'went', 'up', 'store', 'exchange', 'Well', 'once', 'got', 'home', 'second', 'one', 'did', 'same', 'exact', 'thing', 'exchanged', 'third', 'time', 'third', 'copy', 'actually', 'episode', '5', 'seconds', 'exact', 'same', 'place', 'others', 'were', 'messed', 'up', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'gotten', 'other', '5', 'DVD', 'assumption', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'release', 'seasons', 'A-Team', 'painfully', 'slow', 'Universal', 'can', 'let', 'something', 'many', 'errors', 'reach', 'stores', '10', 'months', 'release', 'Season', '2', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'type', 'quality', 'control', 'make', 'sure', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'actually', 'played', 'release', 'absolutely', 'bonus', 'Columbia', 'House', 'collectors', 'edition', 'ones', 'have', 'outtakes', 'other', 'things', 'have', 'wonder', 'release', 'just', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'chapters', 'where', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'are', 'instead', 'having', 'fast', 'forward', 'get', 'back', 'spot', 'left', 'off', 'Just', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'scratch', 'very', 'easily', 'make', 'kinds', 'noises', 'DVD', 'player', 'would', 'have', 'liked', '6', 'single', 'sided', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'last', 'problem', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'have', 'watch', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'introduction', '10', 'seconds', 'can', 'not', 'skip', 'access', 'are', 'two', 'good', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'release', 'first', 'being', 'A-Team', 'best', 'television', 'show', 'time', 'probably', 'favorite', 'season', 'second', 'good', 'thing', 'coupon', 'enclosed', '5', 'Season', '4', 'when', 'released', 'have', 'released', 'Season', 'many', 'errors', 'problems', 'DVD', 'insult', 'A-Team', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'who', 'have', 'waited', '20+', 'years', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Universal', 'recall', 'issue', 'working', 'copies.Update', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'off', 'phone', 'Universal', 'have', 'said', 'will', 'replace', 'DVD', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'can', 'call', '972-293-5903', 'email', 'ushe.consumerrelations', '@', 'worldmarkinc.com', 'put', 'A-Team', 'Season', '3', 'replacement', 'subject', 'line', 'have', 'added', 'star', 'review', ""'re"", 'customer', 'service', 'was', 'friendly', 'returned', 'call', 'promptly', 'have', 'still', 'subtracted', 'star', 'trip', 'have', 'made', 'store']",N/A

950176,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000BUE5CI,Dorrie Wheeler,"[2, 2]","A-Team-The Complete Third Season is now available on DVD. The dual sided DVD box set includes all 25 episodes from the shows 1984-1985 season. The A-Team was a very popular series during the 80's. Co-star Mr. T owes much of his 1980's success to The A-Team. Mr. T, as B.A., didn't really have as much screen time as Hannibal (George Peppard) or the characters of Face and Murdock, but he is easily the most recognizable member of the cast.Season 3, similar to previous seasons was filled with-action, adventure, exotic locals, disguises, and interesting situations. The season begins with the episode ""Bullets and Bikinis"" (airdate 9/18/84). When the mob attempts to take over a hotel The A-Team to rescue her hotel. In a strange twist, the two part episode ""The Bend In The River"" falls into the slot of the second and third episodes of the season. Usually when a series has a two part episode early in the season that episode is used as the season premiere. Well, ""The Bend in the River"" is actually a slow episode which may explain why it was not used as the season premiere. In this episode an archeologist is traveling in the Amazon region looking for secrets but he finds conflict with local pirates and bad guy named El Cahon. Soon Hannibal is seen on a movie set dressed up in a monster costume as The Aquamaniac. After he is fired , Face tries to convince the producer to keep him on. With no film work keeping them occupied, they decide to help Tanya (the archeologists girlfriend) find her missing archeologist boyfriend.By season three, The A-Team had begun to lose a little of it's magic and fan base. Compared to Miami Vice, The A-Team seemed a little quirky and corny at times. Despite this, it was still a great show and fans of the show should add season three to their collection because there were some good episodes during the season. Season three special guests include Markie Post (Nightcourt), Dennis Franz (NYPD Blue), and Kristen Meadows.",5,More A-Team on DVD,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,1963,"['A-Team-The', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'dual', 'sided', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', '25', 'episodes', 'shows', '1984-1985', 'season', 'A-Team', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'series', '80', 'Co-star', 'Mr.', 'T', 'much', '1980', 'success', 'A-Team', 'Mr.', 'T', 'B.A.', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Hannibal', 'George', 'Peppard', 'characters', 'Face', 'Murdock', 'easily', 'most', 'recognizable', 'member', 'cast.Season', '3', 'similar', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'filled', 'with-action', 'adventure', 'exotic', 'locals', 'disguises', 'interesting', 'situations', 'season', 'episode', 'Bullets', 'Bikinis', 'airdate', '9/18/84', 'When', 'mob', 'take', 'over', 'hotel', 'A-Team', 'rescue', 'hotel', 'strange', 'twist', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'Bend', 'River', 'slot', 'second', 'third', 'episodes', 'season', 'Usually', 'when', 'series', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'early', 'season', 'episode', 'used', 'season', 'premiere', 'Well', 'Bend', 'River', 'actually', 'slow', 'episode', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'season', 'premiere', 'episode', 'archeologist', 'traveling', 'Amazon', 'region', 'looking', 'secrets', 'conflict', 'local', 'pirates', 'bad', 'guy', 'named', 'El', 'Cahon', 'Soon', 'Hannibal', 'seen', 'movie', 'set', 'dressed', 'up', 'monster', 'costume', 'Aquamaniac', 'fired', 'Face', 'convince', 'producer', 'keep', 'film', 'work', 'keeping', 'occupied', 'decide', 'help', 'Tanya', 'archeologists', 'girlfriend', 'find', 'missing', 'archeologist', 'boyfriend.By', 'season', 'three', 'A-Team', 'had', 'begun', 'lose', 'little', 'magic', 'fan', 'base', 'Compared', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'A-Team', 'seemed', 'little', 'quirky', 'corny', 'times', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'show', 'fans', 'show', 'should', 'add', 'season', 'three', 'collection', 'were', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'Season', 'three', 'special', 'guests', 'include', 'Markie', 'Post', 'Nightcourt', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'Kristen', 'Meadows']",N/A

But I have to say for any A-Team fan, this is the best season of the show yet. Seasons 1-2 were still kind of building up to this season if that makes sense. I found seasons 1-2 kind of confused in where they wanted to take the show. This season really is the peak of the show. This season has it all. It has action, adventure, comedy, maybe even a bit of drama thrown into the mix. I always got a kick out of Murdock, and he'll always be my favourite character. The things he says and does has me in stitches. I think the way he feeds off of Faceman and B.A. is genius.One thing I do have to complain about with this set is Universal's use of the dreaded DOUBLE SIDED DISCS. Man I hate these! I don't know who ever invented these things, but they are complete crap. I've heard nothing but complaints from fans about the discs not working, to having glitches, to getting scratched too easily. Luckily for me I've had no problems with them, but I still don't like them. I'm a fan of Artwork, or at least a logo of the show or something on the disc itself. I really liked the discs on Miami Vice seasons 3-5, and wish they would do this to other shows, and eliminate the double sided discs altogether, but I don't think we'll see that happening.So for any A-Team fans thinking of buying this season I give it the thumbs up. The only thing is the picture quality isn't as up to par as I'd like, but is still way better quality than watching it on tv, and the sound is only either Mono or Stereo. I'm guessing Mono.

This comedic series had an eclectic group of actors with George Peppard, Mr. T, Dwight Shultz, and Dirk Benedict who with their everyman type of fighting and propensity to create tanks out of gardening supplies provided a fun hour of television.  This season had a few turkey episodes but overall it was entertaining with several excellent episodes, some of which were penned by the excellent writing talents of Stephen J. Cannell. The Big Squeeze, and Incident at Crystal Late stood out as some of the best the episode in the series and even the ones that were a little clich&eacute; such as Bullets and Bikinis, and Timber you got the idea the actors where having a little fun.  This season was before the Cosby show made them make some serious changes in order to try to stay alive, and the formula was in full force.

950191,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000BUE5CI,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 2]","I like this 1984-85 Season of this action-packed drama, but I noticed that this show started becoming stale afterwhile in this season since this show had started lacking a lot of the interesting and sophisticated actions that the first 2 seasons of this show had especially since the A-TEAM wasn't a fivesome anymore in the absence & departure of Tawnia Baker(Marla Heasley) and her predeccesor Amy Allen(Melinda Culea) who was dropped abruptly from the show in the mid Fall of 1983 since Culea was already fired in mid November of 1983 after only 10 weeks and 9 episodes for being too tomboyish and since Heasley quit the show in the 3rd Season in the Fall of 1984, due to sexual harrassment leaving us to mourn the loss of Tawnia & Amy, unlike they had in the 1st Season when the A-TEAM was a fivesome the whole time and the 2nd Season when they were only a foursome temporarily between Amy's departure in the mid Fall of 1983 and the arrival of Tawnia in the Winter of 1984.As a matter of fact, the ""Fire"" episode was the first episode with Tawnia out of the picture as well as the episode when THE A-TEAM's hard-nosed Army nemesis Col.Decker(Lance LeGault)was abruptly so-called replaced by the antagonistic Army nemesis Col.Briggs(Charles Napier)as Hannibal, B.A., and Face's new military nemesis, since Briggs had said at the beginning of the ""Fire"" episode to Hannibal ""Hey Smith, You've Played Out Your Last Tricks On Lynch & Decker"" and mentions later on at the Fire station in the middle of the ""Fire"" episode to Hannibal ""All that garbage about Lynch & Decker admiring you while they were chasing you was stupid"" with Hannibal replying to Briggs by saying ""Whatever happened to Decker, they shipped him off to Alaska because he never caught us?"", which indicated that Briggs was Decker's successor indicating that Decker had ran out of steam just like Decker's predecessor Col. Lynch(Bill Lucking)did after his unsuccessful 10-year pursuit of the A-Team.But then Decker returned to the show 4 episodes later in ""The Island"" episode with the A-TEAM talking about watching out for Decker as if Decker was never even replaced and as if Decker never even departed from the show in the first place, plus they never mentioned Briggs name on the show again after the ""Fire"" episode, but I think Briggs would've been a great permanent replacement for Decker and as luck would have it Lance LeGault was also playing Magnum's bitter Navy nemesis(Col. Green)on MAGNUM, P.I. at the time as well, but it turns out that the only reason why Briggs was the teams nemesis in the ""Fire"" episode was due to Lance Le Gault(Decker)not being able to show up for filming that week, so the producers had to improvise by getting an Army interim nemesis in Decker's absence.Overall, the 3rd Season was okay, but the first half of the 1984-85 Season was when it was better, since they showed some more interesting and sophisticated episodes in the Third Season like ""Fire"", ""Showdown"", ""Sheriffs Of Rivertown"", ""Breakout"", ""Hot Styles"", ""Bullets & Bikinis"", ""Trouble On Wheels"", etc.Overall I personally don't think the 3rd Season was as good as the first 2 seasons, especially since the A-TEAM wasn't a fivesome anymore, plus I think the 1984-85 Season would've been better if Tawnia had become a permanent and full-time co-star of The A-Team instead of departing the show, because I stopped watching this show in the second half of the Third Season since it started getting stale and boring with the ousting of Amy and Tawnia and without any female co-star team members, because the show just didn't feel the same without Amy or Tawnia on the team anymore since the show didn't have Amy or Tawnia's smiles or chipper personalities anymore, especially without the spunky Amy, which was the only real female co-star and team member of the A-TEAM, since Amy was always included in the credits of that show during the introduction in all the episodes of the First Season and during the 9 episodes of the Second Season when the A-TEAM was a fivesome like they were originally, unlike Tawnia which would only show her real name on the credits on the guest stars names credits at the beginning of most of the last 9 episodes of the 1983-84 Season by displaying ""Also Starring Marla Heasley as Tawnia Baker"" which was of course before her last appearance in ""The Bend In The River"" episode.Therefore, this 1984-1985 Season would've been much better and a lot more interesting if Tawnia would've become a permanent co-star in the 3rd Season or or if they would've found a new female co-star to replace Tawnia in the Autumn of 1984, but since this was the first season without a female co-star as well as the first season when THE A-TEAM became a foursome permanently leaving us to mourn the loss of Amy & Tawnia from here on, that started making this show quite a bit less enjoyable and a lot more stale, especially less enjoyable than the first 2 seasons, which is why I stopped watching this show on NBC in the Winter of 1985 when this show was in the second half of this season along with the fact that the double-sided discs on this DVD box set of THE A-TEAM skip & freeze too much on top of that which is probably why Universal released a complete series DVD box set with all 5 seasons on single-sided discs to overcompensate for the skipping & freezing that kept occuring on the 2-sided discs.It was also nice being able to watch these episodes complete and uncut like they were originally shown on NBC as well as commercial-free instead of having to watch them edited with all those deleted scenes and additional commercials in between when the A-TEAM was shown in reruns on FX, TV Land, TNN, and Retro TV.I also liked the way Universal had each of these episodes posted with a brief summary along with their original air-dates too.For instance9/18/84: BULLETS & BIKINIS9/25/84: THE BEND IN THE RIVER10/2/84: FIRE10/16/84: TIMBER10/23/84: DOUBLE HEAT10/30/84: TROUBLE ON WHEELS11/13/84: THE ISLAND11/20/84: SHOWDOWN11/27/84: SHERIFFS OF RIVERTOWN12/4/84: THE BELLS OF ST.

before her co-starring days on NIGHT COURT*Ismael Carlo in the ""Sheriffs Of Rivertown"" episode before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES & SANTA BARBARA*Vincent Baggetta in the ""Bullets & Bikinis"" episode after his co-starring days on the short-lived TV series EDDIE CAPRA MYSTERIES, which came out on NBC in the Fall of 1978.Something else I noticed about this season was I noticed that in the ""Bullets & Bikinis"" episode that they had used clips from the movie SPRING BREAK just like they had used a clip from the movie AIRPLANE in THE BELLY OF THE BEAST OF BOEING episode, which was quite intriguing.This 1984-85 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""Let's All BE THERE"", since that was their slogan on NBC from the Summer of 1984 thru the Summer of 1986.By the way, THE A-TEAM movie is scheduled to be released in theatres on Friday June 11th, 2010.So this review should be helpful to anyone who watched this show religiously during it's 4-year run on NBC.",4,The no more Amy or Tawnia Season!,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,9632,"['like', '1984-85', 'Season', 'action-packed', 'drama', 'noticed', 'show', 'started', 'becoming', 'stale',
