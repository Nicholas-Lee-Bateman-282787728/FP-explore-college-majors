The film is based on an actual 14 month strike in New Mexico by Mexican American zinc miners that ended in January 1952.The people who made the film, Herbert Biberman (a member of the Hollywood Ten) and the brothers-in-law Paul Jarrico and Michael Wilson were all blacklisted by the Hollywood studios for ""taking the Fifth"" before the House un-American Activities committee. They formed the Independent Production Company (IPC)and settled on a story where miners wives took over a picketline because the men had been forced into a 60 day negotiation period by a Taft-Hartely injunction.The film is a delight, the politics is a bit ham-fisted and the players - many of whom were miners and union officials in the actual strike - were not the best of actors, but their passion for the film gave their performances true-grit. The best know actor in the film was Will Geer.: grandfather in TV's ""The Waltons""...Geer was blacklisted too, for writing a favorable review of Soviet cinema.A lot of the cutural tensions come out between traditional Mexican-American male and female roles of the day. The ending of the film is upbeat and everybody I've suggested to have a look - has found film a delightful surprise.Seeing that it was blacklisted and only ran in U.S. Theatres for 13 weeks. Even so Salt of the Earth, is actually one of the best known films in the world... outside the U.S. that is.Salt of the Earth is $4-to-$10 well spent.",5,"Hollywood's first ""Mexican Fim""",1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,1527,"[""'ve"", 'actually', 'done', '40,000', 'word', 'thesis', 'Salt', 'Earth', 'short', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'film', 'based', 'actual', '14', 'month', 'strike', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Mexican', 'American', 'zinc', 'miners', 'ended', 'January', '1952.The', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'Herbert', 'Biberman', 'member', 'Hollywood', 'Ten', 'brothers-in-law', 'Paul', 'Jarrico', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'were', 'blacklisted', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'taking', 'Fifth', 'House', 'un-American', 'Activities', 'committee', 'formed', 'Independent', 'Production', 'Company', 'IPC', 'settled', 'story', 'where', 'miners', 'wives', 'took', 'over', 'picketline', 'men', 'had', 'been', 'forced', '60', 'day', 'negotiation', 'period', 'Taft-Hartely', 'injunction.The', 'film', 'delight', 'politics', 'bit', 'ham-fisted', 'players', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'miners', 'union', 'officials', 'actual', 'strike', 'were', 'not', 'best', 'actors', 'passion', 'film', 'gave', 'performances', 'true-grit', 'best', 'know', 'actor', 'film', 'was', 'Will', 'Geer', 'grandfather', 'TV', 'Waltons', 'Geer', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'too', 'writing', 'favorable', 'review', 'Soviet', 'cinema.A', 'lot', 'cutural', 'tensions', 'come', 'out', 'traditional', 'Mexican-American', 'male', 'female', 'roles', 'day', 'ending', 'film', 'upbeat', 'everybody', ""'ve"", 'suggested', 'have', 'look', 'found', 'film', 'delightful', 'surprise.Seeing', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'only', 'ran', 'U.S.', 'Theatres', '13', 'weeks', 'Even', 'so', 'Salt', 'Earth', 'actually', 'one', 'best', 'known', 'films', 'world', 'U.S.', 'is.Salt', 'Earth', '4-to-', '10', 'well', 'spent']",N/A
438035,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304863365,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Salt of the Earth, 1954 filmThe story begins in New Mexico with women washing clothes in the backyard. [You never saw this in those old western films.] They have lived in ""Zinc Town"" for generations. They no longer live on their land and are unhappy. An accident results in a protest against working alone - no one to check for trouble. The family worries about money and living conditions. The men worry about working conditions and safety on the job. A strike will cause hardships. They want raises, seniority, better conditions, and equality. Discrimination is used as a weapon. Celebrating a name-day is like a birthday where persons are named after the saint's day of their birth.The people celebrate the birthday. Later women complain about the lack of indoor plumbing. A siren screech warns of trouble. The men refuse to go back down in the mine. [Mining, like farming, is the most dangerous work.] They voted to strike over equality in working conditions. The ladies want better sanitation. [You need electricity for running water, etc.] The managers plan to attack the strikers. Can they negotiate? Some are tempted to become strike-breakers. Ramon is arrested and worked over. [Leaders are always targeted.] Can their differences be resolved? Do the Anglos treat their women differently? Winning the strike means a better life for their children. The repossession of a radio is a sign. After seven months some workers went to other mines (hardship cases). They get help from other unions too.The crisis came with an injunction against their strike. [This judge-made law is a weapon against organized workers.] The leader explains their choices: obey and lose the strike, disobey and be jailed and fined so the strike is lost. The International Union will back them up [democracy means home rule]. A woman points out that the injunction only applies to the miners! Some men laugh, but she is applauded. The discuss their options. They vote as a community, the motion carries. May women join this new picket line. Will they scatter like quail? There is conflict and tear gas. The women fight back. ""We shall not be moved."" Not even with tear gas. Some will be arrested, an informer points them out. ""Solidarity Forever."" The sick infant is released from jail.Ramon and the other men work at home; they learn of the need for indoor plumbing. Equality for women? Should Ramon go away for hunting? They can use venison for food. The picket line goes on. The company threatened eviction to scare the workers into surrender. Striking miners arrive. The women take the furniture back into the home. The crowd stands, the sheriff and his men leave. The company decides to settle - for now. Will their children see a better world?This film about working people was produced by the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. It was blacklisted by the movie theater chains and rarely seen until the 1980s. It is a pretty good story for a low-budget drama. You can compare it to the old westerns where the people united against a big landowner to save their ranches and homes. Christopher Jencks was later framed for perjury when a paid informer accused him of attending a Communist meeting. Later they learned this professional witness committed perjury since he was hundreds of miles away from the meeting he claimed he witnessed. The US Supreme Court voided Jencks' conviction (US v. Jencks). This movie is based on an historical event. Quintero may have owned all those lands but the mining company owned the mineral rights and could dig them up.",5,A Story About Working Conditions,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,3559,"['Salt', 'Earth', '1954', 'filmThe', 'story', 'New', 'Mexico', 'women', 'washing', 'clothes', 'backyard', 'never', 'saw', 'old', 'western', 'films', ']', 'have', 'lived', 'Zinc', 'Town', 'generations', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'land', 'are', 'unhappy', 'accident', 'results', 'protest', 'working', 'alone', 'one', 'check', 'trouble', 'family', 'worries', 'money', 'living', 'conditions', 'men', 'worry', 'working', 'conditions', 'safety', 'job', 'strike', 'will', 'cause', 'hardships', 'want', 'raises', 'seniority', 'better', 'conditions', 'equality', 'Discrimination', 'used', 'weapon', 'Celebrating', 'name-day', 'birthday', 'where', 'persons', 'are', 'named', 'saint', 'day', 'birth.The', 'people', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'Later', 'women', 'complain', 'lack', 'indoor', 'plumbing', 'siren', 'screech', 'warns', 'trouble', 'men', 'refuse', 'go', 'back', 'down', 'mine', '[', 'Mining', 'farming', 'most', 'dangerous', 'work', 'voted', 'strike', 'over', 'equality', 'working', 'conditions', 'ladies', 'want', 'better', 'sanitation', '[', 'need', 'electricity', 'running', 'water', 'etc', ']', 'managers', 'plan', 'attack', 'strikers', 'Can', 'negotiate', 'are', 'tempted', 'become', 'strike-breakers', 'Ramon', 'arrested', 'worked', 'over', '[', 'Leaders', 'are', 'always', 'targeted', ']', 'Can', 'differences', 'be', 'resolved', 'Do', 'Anglos', 'treat', 'women', 'differently', 'Winning', 'strike', 'better', 'life', 'children', 'repossession', 'radio', 'sign', 'seven', 'months', 'workers', 'went', 'other', 'mines', 'hardship', 'cases', 'get', 'help', 'other', 'unions', 'too.The', 'crisis', 'came', 'injunction', 'strike', '[', 'judge-made', 'law', 'weapon', 'organized', 'workers', ']', 'leader', 'choices', 'obey', 'lose', 'strike', 'disobey', 'be', 'jailed', 'fined', 'so', 'strike', 'lost', 'International', 'Union', 'will', 'back', 'up', '[', 'democracy', 'home', 'rule', ']', 'A', 'woman', 'out', 'injunction', 'only', 'miners', 'men', 'applauded', 'discuss', 'options', 'vote', 'community', 'motion', 'May', 'women', 'join', 'new', 'picket', 'line', 'scatter', 'quail', 'conflict', 'tear', 'gas', 'women', 'fight', 'back', 'shall', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'Not', 'even', 'tear', 'gas', 'will', 'be', 'arrested', 'informer', 'points', 'out', 'Solidarity', 'Forever', 'sick', 'infant', 'released', 'jail.Ramon', 'other', 'men', 'work', 'home', 'learn', 'need', 'indoor', 'plumbing', 'Equality', 'women', 'Should', 'Ramon', 'go', 'away', 'hunting', 'can', 'use', 'venison', 'food', 'picket', 'line', 'company', 'threatened', 'eviction', 'scare', 'workers', 'surrender', 'Striking', 'miners', 'arrive', 'women', 'take', 'furniture', 'back', 'home', 'crowd', 'sheriff', 'men', 'leave', 'company', 'settle', 'now', 'Will', 'children', 'see', 'better', 'world', 'film', 'working', 'people', 'was', 'produced', 'International', 'Union', 'Mine', 'Mill', 'Smelter', 'Workers', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'movie', 'theater', 'chains', 'rarely', 'seen', '1980s', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'low-budget', 'drama', 'can', 'compare', 'old', 'westerns', 'where', 'people', 'united', 'big', 'landowner', 'save', 'ranches', 'homes', 'Christopher', 'Jencks', 'was', 'later', 'framed', 'perjury', 'when', 'paid', 'informer', 'accused', 'attending', 'Communist', 'meeting', 'Later', 'learned', 'professional', 'witness', 'committed', 'perjury', 'was', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'away', 'meeting', 'claimed', 'witnessed', 'US', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'voided', 'Jencks', 'conviction', 'US', 'Jencks', 'movie', 'based', 'historical', 'event', 'Quintero', 'may', 'have', 'owned', 'lands', 'mining', 'company', 'owned', 'mineral', 'rights', 'could', 'dig', 'up']",N/A

Those events, as well as the repeated instances in this space of my writing about the Kentucky coal mines and the sagas of bloody Harlan County have provided many lessons about how to proceed with this kind of struggle. So it is apt that the film under review, ""Salt Of The Earth"", is being reviewed at this time. This rather didactic film, by today's standards at least, with quite a political history of its own brings home in dramatic form almost all the lessons of the struggle in the mines.

438039,A3ASFB4UC4N9GR,6304863365,Dody,"[0, 0]","The Salt of the Earth is a remarkable movie in so many ways it is hard to put into such a small space.First, this is a really good film. It is no use praising it for the rest of its vertues if the picture was not gripping in and of its self.Second, it is the story of a real historic strike at a mine in Southern New Mexico near Silver City in 1951. During the strike the men were restricted in what they could do and so the women took over the task of picketing and holding the families together.Most of the strikers were hispanic in a time when Hispanic workers were afforded little  respect. Therefore this is a story of racial bias and about womens' empowerment.Third the movie was made with very few professional actors and no, it is not a documentary. The acting is remarkable.Fourth, If you have't heard of the Hollywood 10 ...you should have. The Hollywood10 stood up to the House on Un-American Activities Comattee HUAC and refused to cooperate with the witch hunt of the early 1950's. Because of this these men were 'blacklisted' and refused work in their fields despite the fact that they were Academy Award winners. Many were sent to prison.There is a documentary about the Holywood 10 and the HUAC scares of the 50's on the disc.Salt of the Earth has been listed as one of the most important and siminal motion Pictures made in the USA not only for the excellent story and acting but for the way it was made and the costs to some of the people involved. Rosaura Revueltas, the female lead was blacklisted in Mexico and was never able to make another film.Today few would believe that such a film would cause such a reaction. Yet the movie was not seen in the USA for many yearsyet,in Europe and Asia it ran to packed houses for years.This is a movie everyone should see and probably every school should have a copy. It has stood the test of time and the vagarities of politics to demonstrate the strength and resilience of people. It should be ranked with The grapes of Wrath as an American Classic.",5,A Wonderful Movie and a Remarkable Story,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,2012,"['Salt', 'Earth', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'hard', 'put', 'small', 'space.First', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'use', 'praising', 'rest', 'vertues', 'picture', 'was', 'not', 'gripping', 'self.Second', 'story', 'real', 'historic', 'strike', 'mine', 'Southern', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Silver', 'City', '1951', 'strike', 'men', 'were', 'restricted', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'women', 'took', 'over', 'task', 'picketing', 'holding', 'families', 'together.Most', 'strikers', 'were', 'hispanic', 'time', 'when', 'Hispanic', 'workers', 'were', 'afforded', 'little', 'respect', 'story', 'racial', 'bias', 'womens', 'empowerment.Third', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'few', 'professional', 'actors', 'not', 'documentary', 'acting', 'remarkable.Fourth', ""have't"", 'heard', 'Hollywood', '10', 'should', 'have', 'Hollywood10', 'stood', 'up', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'Comattee', 'HUAC', 'refused', 'cooperate', 'witch', 'hunt', 'early', '1950', 'men', 'were', ""'blacklisted"", 'refused', 'work', 'fields', 'fact', 'were', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'Many', 'were', 'sent', 'prison.There', 'documentary', 'Holywood', '10', 'HUAC', 'scares', '50', 'disc.Salt', 'Earth', 'been', 'listed', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'siminal', 'motion', 'Pictures', 'made', 'USA', 'not', 'only', 'excellent', 'story', 'acting', 'way', 'was', 'made', 'costs', 'people', 'involved', 'Rosaura', 'Revueltas', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'Mexico', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'make', 'film.Today', 'few', 'would', 'believe', 'film', 'would', 'cause', 'such', 'reaction', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'seen', 'USA', 'many', 'yearsyet', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'ran', 'packed', 'houses', 'years.This', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'probably', 'school', 'should', 'have', 'copy', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'vagarities', 'politics', 'demonstrate', 'strength', 'resilience', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'ranked', 'grapes', 'Wrath', 'American', 'Classic']",N/A
438040,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6304863365,Douglas Doepke,"[22, 23]","In the early 1950's, film studios were under attack from two directions. Small screen tv had put a big dent in theatre attendance, while the Mc Carthyite cold war had put a big chill in the cultural milieu. A formerly lucrative industry found itself suddenly reeling, with a future no longer very certain. In short, the commercial winds had changed and Hollywood needed an overhaul. To meet tv's challenge, studio moguls introduced big screen Cinerama, biblical spectaculars and full-cleavage romance goddesses; to please congressional investigators, they fired unrepentent left-wingers and blackballed them from future employment. Social commentary, never much of a staple, disappeared entirely, while the escapism of Westerns, Tennessee Williams, and bedroom innuendo took over. The 50's had arrived with a vengeance.Against this backdrop, Salt of the Earth appears to have parachuted in from another planet. In retrospect, the film's look, feel, and values, plus use of non-actors, represent an anti-Hollywood aesthetic in just about about its purest form. Instead of the usual ersatz, there are company shacks, a desolate land, and real workers sometimes speaking a foreign tongue about hot water and labor solidarity. This was and is about as far removed from the fabled dream factory as any commercial film before or since. To my knowledge, Salt is the only professional movie made in America by known communists. And though I've seen it a number of times, I've yet to detect a theme that any conscionable liberal would disagree with. The emphasis throughout is on reform, not revolution.So why was the movie so thoroughly ostracized. Aside from the obvious negatives, there are two aspects that challenge patriotic assumptions about the power of the individual. The strikers win because of their solidarity, that is, their capacity to overcome internal divisions in pursuit of common goals. But more importantly, theirs is a leaderless solidarity. Unlike so many other labor films, no one person arises in Salt to take charge or direct the actions of the others. No single iconic personality dominates. Community of labor is the real agent of change and victor here, while no one individual can be pointed to as indispensible. Second, through the pivotal role of Esperanza (a professional actress), the individual is shown as flowering amidst the common effort. Far from being submerged in a faceless mass, she discovers through participation a heightened sense of individualness and a wealth of hidden talents. Moreover, a stronger, more confident Esperanza means a stronger, more confident strike effort. In short, it's not individuality versus the group, but individuality from within the group. I don't know how subversive these ideas ultimately are, but I do know they challenge decades of iconic film-making, in which the omnipotent movie star, a John Wayne or a Sylvester Stallone, is transfomed into a demi-god and exalted above the common folk. Against this grain, Salt seeks to empower its audience, not disempower.There are many fine touches in the film. I'm glad the workers are not romanticized, nor are the bosses or their law-enforcement allies caricatured. Instead the hardscrabble families are treated as ordinary people, able, nevertheless, to act intelligently beyond the cultural limits placed upon them. Ordinarily, the viewer would expect a heavy hand with such politically charged material; however, the producers have the good sense to hew to a lighter approach that features unexpected deposits of humor, as when the men whine about being forced to hang out the wash. This furnishes both a good laugh and an incisive piece of social commentary. In fact, most of the movie's considerable humor comes from its strong feminist subtext, certainly a striking exception to the Ozzie and Harriet stereotypes of the period.Despite an obvious appeal to cultural historians, Salt is much more than a mere artifact. There is, of course, no more Mc Carthy-led purge, and miners' wives have long since gotten hot water and indoor plumbing thanks to labor militancy. Nevertheless, the film's social themes continue to reach beyond that long-ago period. Women continue to strive for equality, just as the workers' wives in Salt struggled as domestics against the chauvinism of their husbands. Moreover, the need for racial equality remains as pressing now as it was in Michael Wilson's prescient screenplay. And, of course, there's labor's ongoing battle to get something like a fair share of the wealth it produces. Far from being a dead artifact, the power of this suppressed treasure along with the courage of the men and women who made it, continues to echo across the decades, furnishing inspiration to generations to come.",5,Suppressed Treasure,1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,4745,"['early', '1950', 'film', 'studios', 'were', 'attack', 'two', 'directions', 'Small', 'screen', 'tv', 'had', 'put',

Madeby artists largely  blacklisted from Hollywood for liberal beliefs, and/or for refusing to testify againstothers, this  was the only film in U.S. history that was itself blacklisted, and kept out of theaters despitepositive reviews.Yet what it preached; basic dignity and rights for Hispanics, for women, and for workers could hardlybe seen, even then, as a real threat to America -- had it not been for hysteria towards all thingsliberal, progressive, or intellectual &#8211;- those things being lumped in with communist revolutionaryactivity.It's remarkable for a 1954 film to see a U.S. film with all the leading roles being Hispanic, andplayed by Hispanics, not white actors in 'brown face'. Even more impressive is the film's earlybut potent feminist viewpoint.The issue of women also adds a nice level of complexity to a story that could have felt too simplisticin terms of right and wrong. The male Hispanic workers are almost as guilty of oppressing their wivesas the Anglo bosses are of oppressing their Hispanic workers. So there's an acknowledgment thateveryone still had a lot to learn about creating an equal society in those days.Along with the occasionally awkward acting (most of the cast were non-professionals) and occasionallytoo blatant speech-making, there are some very moving, human and inspiring moments.And in a nice twist of fate, after being blacklisted from theaters and kept from the public, the film nowresides on the U.S. National Registry of important films.",4,"Less than perfect dramatically, but an important historic document",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,1696,"['bit', 'awkward', 'rough', 'edged', 'form', 'bit', 'nose', 'politics', 'bit', 'telling', 'story', 'miners', 'strike', 'historically', 'important', 'early', ""'independent"", 'film', 'Madeby', 'largely', 'blacklisted', 'Hollywood', 'liberal', 'beliefs', 'and/or', 'refusing', 'testify', 'againstothers', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'U.S.', 'history', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'kept', 'theaters', 'despitepositive', 'reviews.Yet', 'what', 'preached', 'basic', 'dignity', 'rights', 'Hispanics', 'women', 'workers', 'could', 'hardlybe', 'seen', 'even', 'then', 'real', 'threat', 'America', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'hysteria', 'towards', 'thingsliberal', 'progressive', 'intellectual', '8211', 'things', 'being', 'lumped', 'communist', 'revolutionaryactivity.It', 'remarkable', '1954', 'film', 'see', 'U.S.', 'film', 'leading', 'roles', 'being', 'Hispanic', 'andplayed', 'Hispanics', 'not', 'white', 'actors', ""'brown"", 'face', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'film', 'earlybut', 'potent', 'feminist', 'viewpoint.The', 'issue', 'women', 'also', 'nice', 'level', 'complexity', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'felt', 'too', 'simplisticin', 'terms', 'right', 'wrong', 'male', 'Hispanic', 'workers', 'are', 'almost', 'guilty', 'oppressing', 'wivesas', 'Anglo', 'bosses', 'are', 'oppressing', 'Hispanic', 'workers', 'acknowledgment', 'thateveryone', 'still', 'had', 'lot', 'learn', 'creating', 'equal', 'society', 'days.Along', 'occasionally', 'awkward', 'acting', 'most', 'cast', 'were', 'non-professionals', 'occasionallytoo', 'blatant', 'speech-making', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'human', 'inspiring', 'moments.And', 'nice', 'twist', 'fate', 'being', 'blacklisted', 'theaters', 'kept', 'public', 'film', 'nowresides', 'U.S.', 'National', 'Registry', 'important', 'films']",N/A

438047,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6304863365,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Salt of the Earth (Herbert J. Biberman, 1953)It occurred to me sometime after I had watched it that it would have been a great idea to co-review Salt of the Earth, Herbert Biberman's muckraking 1953 film about the Empire Zinc Mine strike in southwestern New Mexico, and Dreams of Dust, Laurent Salgues' 2006 drama about Nigerian immigrants who turn to gold mining in Burkina Faso to make a living. Unfortunately, by the time I came up with that idea, I had long completed my Dreams of Dust review, but if you've seen one of them, you would do yourself a service seeking the other one out. For two movies that couldn't be more different on a meta level, they work as a fantastic double-bill.Biberman's movie is a thinly-veiled portrait of the events surrounding the 1951 strike at a mine in Bayard, a town in southwestern New Mexico (now a Superfund site). Thanks to a combination of its location (Bayard sits very close to the Mexican border) and stinginess, Empire had a tendency to hire a large number of Latino workers. This is, of course, not a terrible thing, and you would imagine that in today's world the company would be crowing about its diversity. All well and good except that it got out that Empire were paying the Latino miners a fraction of what they were paying the gringos. This led to the Latino workers going on strike. The movie covers the lead-up to the strike more than the thing itself, though it does devote some time at the end to the actual strike. That was kind of a gutsy move in the fifties, and it works pretty well.Looking back on the movie seventy years later, it can be hard to separate the meta from the actual movie. There is a great deal of meta surrounding this picture. Most of the principals in front of the camera were non-actors (and, unthinkable in Hollywood at the time, most of the actors playing Mexicans were actual Mexicans), while four of the principals behind the camera were blacklisted. (So was the movie itself, the only film in American history to actually be blacklisted; ironically, it is also the only American film that was released theatrically in China between 1950 and 1979. It would not be shown theatrically in America until the mid-sixties.) All of which makes it great on trivia night, but is it good for movie night? It's not a bad little movie, to be sure, but I think the meta has caused it to be lionized maybe a little more than it should. The non-actors do a good job for non-actors, but Cidade de Deus this ain't. Will Geer, as a local sheriff tasked with quelling the natives, brings a touch of professionalism to the proceedings, and male lead Juan Chacn really does rise to the occasion, but the two of them often have the unintentional effect of highlighting the amateurs around them. That said, that we're seventy years on also makes the film fit a little better. After all, we live in an age where any student filmmaker with a digital camcorder and a DVD-R burner can get a movie streaming on Netflix, so Salt of the Earth is a little more at home.
