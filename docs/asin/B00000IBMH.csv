I know her back ground-like the back of my hand.  And true to film form, this flick leaves some gaps in her real story, and over dramatizes her issues.

Also, are there any plans for another film about your life since so many things occurred after this movie was made? (Dania of New Jersey)A: The story for the &quot;Nadia&quot; movie was created from stories and background information provided by Bela and Martha Karolyi and Geza Poszar. Although, I might have explained my story a little differently, I was proud of the way the movie was made. Considering the typical &quot;Hollywood,&quot; treatment stories like mine get, the movie was pretty accurate and well done. I have been approached about doing another &quot;Nadia&quot; movie, concerning my life after my competitive days up through my &quot;happily ever after&quot; situation now. I am not sure, maybe some day I will do it. (Nadia Comaneci)Review by mailoon: I found the actress who played the 14 years old onwards Nadia was badly casted, she was the major set back for this movie, or else the story was actually real good and inspiration to many. This VHS version was out of stock for some time, many people paid for a lot of money to get the second hand auction. Now it is great to have it back in sales again. It sure has lasting effect, after 17 years of screening. Nadia Comaneci has just celebrated her 25th Anniversary of the 1st perfect ten last July 18. Isn't it an incredible moment to remember? This movie showed how it had began and after that. We have so much to learn from Nadia. Today both Nadia and Teodora Ungureanu are still great friends, it is great to see these ladies had done so much for gymnastics, are still active with the sports. Lets also hope there will be another Nadia movie to show us the after story, her way to the freedom and regain her honour to one of the Greatest Athletes of 20th century.",4,Nadia Comaneci Own Comment of This movie,999993600,"09 9, 2001",2001,1971,"['Refering', 'web', 'page', 'quot', 'Ask', 'Bart', 'Nadia', 'quot', 'International', 'Gymnast', 'Magazine.Nadia', 'Comaneci', 'personal', 'answered', 'following', 'question', '-Q', 'What', 'opinion', '[', '1984', 'made-for-TV', ']', 'movie', 'quot', 'Nadia', 'quot', 'Also', 'are', 'there', 'plans', 'film', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'occurred', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Dania', 'New', 'Jersey', 'A', 'story', 'quot', 'Nadia', 'quot', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'stories', 'background', 'information', 'provided', 'Bela', 'Martha', 'Karolyi', 'Geza', 'Poszar', 'might', 'have', 'explained', 'story', 'little', 'differently', 'was', 'proud', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Considering', 'typical', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'treatment', 'stories', 'mine', 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'been', 'approached', 'doing', 'quot', 'Nadia', 'quot', 'movie', 'concerning', 'life', 'competitive', 'days', 'up', 'quot', 'happily', 'ever', 'quot', 'situation', 'now', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'maybe', 'day', 'will', 'do', 'Nadia', 'Comaneci', 'Review', 'mailoon', 'found', 'actress', 'who', 'played', '14', 'years', 'old', 'onwards', 'Nadia', 'was', 'badly', 'casted', 'was', 'major', 'set', 'back', 'movie', 'else', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'real', 'good', 'inspiration', 'many', 'VHS', 'version', 'was', 'stock', 'time', 'many', 'people', 'paid', 'lot', 'money', 'get', 'second', 'hand', 'auction', 'Now', 'great', 'have', 'back', 'sales', 'again', 'sure', 'lasting', 'effect', '17', 'years', 'screening', 'Nadia', 'Comaneci', 'just', 'celebrated', '25th', 'Anniversary', '1st', 'perfect', 'ten', 'last', 'July', '18', ""n't"", 'incredible', 'moment', 'remember', 'movie', 'showed', 'how', 'had', 'began', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'learn', 'Nadia', 'Today', 'Nadia', 'Teodora', 'Ungureanu', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'friends', 'great', 'see', 'ladies', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'gymnastics', 'are', 'still', 'active', 'sports', 'Lets', 'also', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'Nadia', 'movie', 'show', 'story', 'way', 'freedom', 'regain', 'honour', 'one', 'Greatest', 'Athletes', '20th', 'century']",N/A

Granted, it isn't really a movie. In fact, it was initially aired as a multi-part miniseries. And time has not been kind to it.Despite that, this remains the definitive Nadia film. Why? The performances, and the brisk, crisp direction. It has TV movie written all over it, and the second half of the film is horribly cast (the actress playing Nadia looks nothing like her, and doesn't know anything about gymnastics either. She barely manages to even pose right), but it is charming and refreshing in its' portrayal of the young Nadia and her best friend Theodora Unguriyanu.The 'perfect 10' that Nadia scored at the Olympics is reduced to slo-mo editing here, and her performance at the Montreal Olympics looks stilted and way too dramatic. Also Bela Karolyi is portrayed as this sinister egotist. Whether or not this is true, I don't know - but it stuck out in this movie. However, there are many sweet and tender moments within this film that make it well worth a buy. I've watched it many times myself, though its been years that I last saw it - and would still highly recommend this lost treasure.",3,"Touching yet Hysterical : A Warped, Enjoyable Nadia",1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1255,"['brother', 'recorded', 'off', 'TV', 'early', ""'90s"", 'much', 'childhood', 'was', 'peppered', 'bits', 'inspired', 'dialog', ""'gem"", ""'"", 'movie', 'Granted', ""n't"", 'really', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'initially', 'aired', 'multi-part', 'miniseries', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'it.Despite', 'definitive', 'Nadia', 'film', 'Why', 'performances', 'brisk', 'crisp', 'direction', 'TV', 'movie', 'written', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'horribly', 'cast', 'actress', 'playing', 'Nadia', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'gymnastics', 'barely', 'even', 'pose', 'right', 'charming', 'refreshing', 'portrayal', 'young', 'Nadia', 'best', 'friend', 'Theodora', 'Unguriyanu.The', '10', 'Nadia', 'scored', 'Olympics', 'reduced', 'slo-mo', 'editing', 'here', 'performance', 'Montreal', 'Olympics', 'stilted', 'way', 'too', 'dramatic', 'Also', 'Bela', 'Karolyi', 'portrayed', 'sinister', 'egotist', 'not', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'stuck', 'out', 'movie', 'However', 'are', 'many', 'sweet', 'tender', 'moments', 'film', 'make', 'well', 'buy', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'years', 'last', 'saw', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'lost', 'treasure']",N/A

This is a true story about Nadia Comaneci played by Leslie Weiner (her only movie feature) and her life in Romania, to the rise to stardom in the Olympics. She went from playing in her back yard to working for hours practicing gymnastics. From being a sound person, to one living on the edge. This is a wonderful movie about pledging your live to one thing only, even if it means leaving everyone and everything you ever knew, to do just one thing, gymnastics. What a life this child had, the suffering, the committed time spent practicing, and the competition with other gymnists.
