1578194,A35BZ58CZ2MAZ,B008XMQPHO,Dia,"[0, 0]","Wow. This film was so bad. I kept expecting it to get better and it only got worse. They hinted that his lifelong best friend was his true love (he refused to attend the guy's first wedding, he ""wept"" before this one etc etc.) That led nowhere. Several sympathetic characters were set-up -- all so they could get their hearts broken by a guy who wasn't so great to begin with. And he wore the ugliest bathrobe. Supposedly, they all had big dicks. There was just no point to any of it! The screenplay was atrocious. I'm annoyed that it was listed as 3 stars. Hopefully, this one star review will save others from this time-waster. Ugh!

1578196,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B008XMQPHO,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[0, 2]","The premise offered a 21st century twist on the ol' ""wedding condition inheritance"" tale.  Sadly the entire thing is an unrelenting, crashing bore.  Clocking in at less than 90 minutes it still felt longer than War and Peace.  I'm not kidding.  The lead actor is short, not particularly attractive, so he must be a nice, yes?  Nope.  Instead we're presented with a selfish, egotistical to the point of narcissism, cruel and petty little man who keeps getting referred to in attractive terms and who literally dozens of men want to gay marry.What little story there is, for the first quarter of the film, mostly tossed aside in favor of endless bad pop tunes accompanying Danny (our hero) in his selection process, followed by more bad pop and a parade of family members, friends, hangers-on and other irritating guests arriving at a fancy country inn for the wedding.  A bit more dialogue, then more music, pointless plot twists (one involving an drunk uncle trying to connive Danny out of his inheritance) and then at least two false starts to the main event itself.Dreadful stuff.

Two of the actors were horrible clich&eacute;s and the rest were just bad actors. The movie was not unbearable so I did watch it all and in the end it (like the last ten minutes) it was getting better but then it was over. Had interesting possibilities with the story line that were not explored, weak plot development and no good actors what-so-ever. Even the lead male part was supposed to be a hottie, which his body was, but his face was not which seemed to be a theme in the movie.

What a disastrous waste of anyone's time. It seemed like they were making this up, dialog and all, as it was being filmed. Acting? There are no actors here. Eye candy? Thank goodness I knew better than to believe that in the first place.  Stupid, stupid, stupid, all the way through. I give it 1 star because it was 1 of the first gay brit films I could actually understand the words although, they were just plain stupid too.
