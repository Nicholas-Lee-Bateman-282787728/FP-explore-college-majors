And here it shows no sign of slowing down. Some of the catch phrases and jive remarks of Jimmy Walker's JJ are still intact,a big part of why Amos departed from the show after this season but as an extention of the second season this is a good one. During this season the character of James isn't seen as much as he'd gained more steady employment. Also the character of JJ faces some strong growth issues such as narrowly escaping a gang and sadly almost marrying a lady who sercame to drug addiction in 'JJ's Fiancee"". During this season we also see Michael's militant attitude turn towards a more confrontational attitude as he begins as his teenage hits him hard. James also reunites with the father that abandoned him,thanks to his daughter Thelma in ""The Family Tree"". This episode provides one of Amos's best acting performances as his character is confronted with the man who did to him the one thing he's vowed never to do to his own family. You see a lot of family growth this season as the children get older and even the friendly sparring between James and Wilona starts to receed to a degree. They even get some big laughs in as the Evans's face their challanges in episodes such as ""Florida's Protest"" when,after picketing a grocery store that sold her spoiled meat she and Wilona are wrongly arrested and later confront the hustling manager with his own rotton goods. JJ's art also proves a point on interest too. In ""The Mural"" JJ paints a mural for a bank and does get paid,but after helping the banks owner realize that some people even within the black community have a mildly different perception of ""the happy side of ghetto life"".  In the episode ""Sweet Daddy Williams"" JJ is again confronted by the local hustling pimp who plans on commisioning a piece from him. He also finds himself dealing with painting a nude,later in a bathing suit as a wedding present for her husband. The funniest episode is ""The Rent Party"",featuring different characters entertaining to help a neighbor such as Bookman's fairly spot on celebrity impressions and Florida,Wilona and Thelma copping The Supremes in a hilerious version of ""Stop In The Name Of Love"". Even though this was the final season for one major cast member it was certainly a wonderful season to go out on.",5,Final Season With John Amos,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2379,"['Good', 'Times', 'was', 'big', 'peak', '1975', 'year', 'spanned', 'second', 'third', 'season', 'here', 'sign', 'slowing', 'down', 'catch', 'phrases', 'jive', 'remarks', 'Jimmy', 'Walker', 'JJ', 'are', 'still', 'intact', 'big', 'part', 'why', 'Amos', 'departed', 'show', 'season', 'extention', 'second', 'season', 'good', 'one', 'season', 'character', 'James', ""n't"", 'seen', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'gained', 'more', 'steady', 'employment', 'Also', 'character', 'JJ', 'strong', 'growth', 'issues', 'such', 'narrowly', 'escaping', 'gang', 'sadly', 'almost', 'marrying', 'lady', 'who', 'drug', 'addiction', ""'JJ"", 'Fiancee', 'season', 'also', 'see', 'Michael', 'militant', 'attitude', 'turn', 'more', 'confrontational', 'attitude', 'teenage', 'hard', 'James', 'also', 'father', 'abandoned', 'thanks', 'daughter', 'Thelma', 'Family', 'Tree', 'episode', 'one', 'Amos', 'best', 'acting', 'performances', 'character', 'confronted', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'one', 'thing', 'vowed', 'never', 'do', 'own', 'family', 'see', 'lot', 'family', 'growth', 'season', 'children', 'get', 'older', 'even', 'friendly', 'sparring', 'James', 'Wilona', 'receed', 'degree', 'even', 'get', 'big', 'laughs', 'Evans', 'face', 'challanges', 'episodes', 'such', 'Florida', 'Protest', 'when', 'picketing', 'grocery', 'store', 'sold', 'spoiled', 'meat', 'Wilona', 'are', 'wrongly', 'arrested', 'later', 'confront', 'hustling', 'manager', 'own', 'rotton', 'goods', 'JJ', 'art', 'also', 'point', 'interest', 'too', 'Mural', 'JJ', 'mural', 'bank', 'get', 'paid', 'helping', 'banks', 'owner', 'realize', 'people', 'even', 'black', 'community', 'have', 'mildly', 'different', 'perception', 'happy', 'side', 'ghetto', 'life', 'episode', 'Sweet', 'Daddy', 'Williams', 'JJ', 'again', 'confronted', 'local', 'hustling', 'pimp', 'who', 'commisioning', 'piece', 'also', 'dealing', 'painting', 'nude', 'later', 'bathing', 'suit', 'wedding', 'present', 'husband', 'funniest', 'episode', 'Rent', 'Party', 'featuring', 'different', 'characters', 'entertaining', 'help', 'neighbor', 'such', 'Bookman', 'fairly', 'spot', 'celebrity', 'impressions', 'Florida', 'Wilona', 'Thelma', 'copping', 'Supremes', 'hilerious', 'version', 'Stop', 'Name', 'Love', 'Even', 'was', 'final', 'season', 'one', 'major', 'cast', 'member', 'was', 'certainly', 'wonderful', 'season', 'go', 'out']",N/A

Good Times was a look at a family in the ghetto who managed to navigate through poverty, the sexual revolution, racial changes and so much more during a volatile time in our nation's history.  The interplay between Esther Rolle (Florida) and the children is hilarious, bombastic, but always loving.  It showed a family pull together with love, honor, and dignity. I wish amidst all the new reality shows, trash talk shows, and MTV, that there could be just ONE show like Good Times.  But since those days look pretty much gone, get this set of DVD's and enjoy what was a much funnier and more sane time in American television history.  (P.S. One of my favorite characters on the show, but one who was not on very often was ""Sweet Daddy Williams"", a neighborhood loan shark and hustler.

When I would come home afterschool I used to look forward to watching Good Times it was and still is and always will be one of my favorite television shows. This show included some of the best black actors in the world in my eye; They were: John Amos, Ja'net Dubois, Esther Rolle truly a pioneer one of my idols , T.K. Carson, Johnny Brown, Roscoe Brown, Jimmie Walker, Debbie Allen, Ralph Carter, Bernadette Stanis, Ben Powers, Janet Jackson, Shirley Hemphill, Theodore Wilson, Calvin Lockhart, Rosiland Cash, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Paulene Myers, Phillip Michael Thomas, Hubert Johnson, Helen Martin, Debbi Morgan, Moses Gunn, and many many other great actors. I thank these wonderful actors/actresses because they helped  pave the way and made Black Entertainment and Black Talent. I love this show it showed the real world and real lessons that go on in this cruel world. This show made me laugh and made me cry. Everytime I drink kool-aid I think about J.J.  and I love the phrase ""Dynomite"". I love this show it also taught me Black Pride. and when I was a little girl watching them in rerunds I always looked forward to the Black Jesus, Thelma's Wedding and being married, Janet Jackson, and James episodes.  I especially love the performances. My favorite performances on this disc is when Wanda needed money to pay her rent ; They had a rent party and Thelma,Wilona, and Florida performed ""Stop in the name of Love"" and the my favorite ""Young and In Love"" by Ralph Carter(Stacy Latttisaw's song).  I love this show it brings back so many memories it taught a lot of lessons and showing what it like to be black and to be proud of who and what you are and that you can acheive success and that you can eventually get out of the ghetto, black talent, black everything Ilove this show. I thank the person who decided to release this on dvd thank you so much it is worth every dollar I can't wait until they finish the whole series then my GOOD TIMES collection will be complete. I wish that they would do a reunion that would be so wonderful if any  Reunion show I would like to see this would be the one..........",5,BLACK  PRIDE!!!!!,1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,2160,"['used', 'love', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'When', 'would', 'come', 'home', 'afterschool', 'used', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'Good', 'Times', 'was', 'still', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'shows', 'show', 'included', 'best', 'black', 'actors', 'world', 'eye', 'were', 'John', 'Amos', ""Ja'net"", 'Dubois', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'truly', 'pioneer', 'one', 'idols', 'T.K', 'Carson', 'Johnny', 'Brown', 'Roscoe', 'Brown', 'Jimmie', 'Walker', 'Debbie', 'Allen', 'Ralph', 'Carter', 'Bernadette', 'Stanis', 'Ben', 'Powers', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'Shirley', 'Hemphill', 'Theodore', 'Wilson', 'Calvin', 'Lockhart', 'Rosiland', 'Cash', 'Lincoln', 'Kilpatrick', 'Paulene', 'Myers', 'Phillip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'Hubert', 'Johnson', 'Helen', 'Martin', 'Debbi', 'Morgan', 'Moses', 'Gunn', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'actors', 'thank', 'wonderful', 'actors/actresses', 'helped', 'pave', 'way', 'made', 'Black', 'Entertainment', 'Black', 'Talent', 'love', 'show', 'showed', 'real', 'world', 'real', 'lessons', 'go', 'cruel', 'world', 'show', 'made', 'laugh', 'made', 'cry', 'Everytime', 'drink', 'kool-aid', 'think', 'J.J.', 'love', 'phrase', 'Dynomite', 'love', 'show', 'also', 'taught', 'Black', 'Pride', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'watching', 'rerunds', 'always', 'looked', 'forward', 'Black', 'Jesus', 'Thelma', 'Wedding', 'being', 'married', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'James', 'episodes', 'especially', 'love', 'performances', 'favorite', 'performances', 'disc', 'when', 'Wanda', 'needed', 'money', 'pay', 'rent', 'had', 'rent', 'party', 'Thelma', 'Wilona', 'Florida', 'performed', 'Stop', 'name', 'Love', 'favorite', 'Young', 'Love', 'Ralph', 'Carter', 'Stacy', 'Latttisaw', 'song', 'love', 'show', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'taught', 'lot', 'lessons', 'showing', 'what', 'be', 'black', 'be', 'proud', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'can', 'acheive', 'success', 'can', 'eventually', 'get', 'ghetto', 'black', 'talent', 'black', 'everything', 'Ilove', 'show', 'thank', 'person', 'who', 'decided', 'release', 'dvd', 'thank', 'so', 'much', 'worth', 'dollar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'finish', 'whole', 'series', 'then', 'GOOD', 'TIMES', 'collection', 'will', 'be', 'complete', 'wish', 'would', 'do', 'reunion', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'wonderful', 'Reunion', 'show', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'would', 'be', 'one']",N/A
826487,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000286S42,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[9, 9]","Nominated for three Golden Globes, Good Times premiered in mid-season 1974 to widespread critical acclaim and audience popularity. A spin-off of the Bea Arthur (of Golden Girls fame) sitcom Maude (1972), Good Times became the fourth of five highly successful sitcoms brought into being during the 1970's decade by Norman Lear. In addition to Maude, those sitcoms were All In The Family (1971), Sanford & Son (1972), and The Jeffersons (1975). The second of three to focus exclusively on African-American family life, Good Times became a source for groundbreaking social commentary in compliment to its penchant for hilarious family comedy...Good Times centers around the lives of James (John Amos) and Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), an African-American couple raising their three children in a Chicago housing development. Eldest son J.J. (Jimmie Walker) is a skinny, wisecracking ladies man with an affinity for painting. Middle child Thelma (BernNadette Stanis) plays the role of moderating influence on the passions of her two brothers, while youngest son Michael (Ralph Carter) is always involved in a cause to help others or end an injustice. The family is often visited by Florida's best friend from high school, Willona (Ja'net DuBois), who also lives in the project. In later seasons, she's accompanied by adopted daughter Penny (Janet Jackson). With additional comic relief provided by overweight super Nathan Bookman (Johnny Brown), Good Times is a family-oriented TV series laden with great one-liners and plenty of laugh-tracks...The Good Times (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""A Real Cool Job"" in which James, having taken a number of courses at a trade school, is finally offered the high-paying job of his dreams. But there's a catch, the job requires a transfer to the frozen tundra of Alaska... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Love in the Ghetto"" in which Thelma announces she's engaged, much to the chagrin of James and Florida, and ""The Mural"" in which J.J. paints a mural for a bank in order to earn the money necessary for Thelma to attend college...Below is a list of episodes included on the Good Times (Season 3) DVD:Episode 38 (A Real Cool Job)Episode 39 (The Family Gun)Episode 40 (Operation Florida)Episode 41 (Love in the Ghetto)Episode 42 (Florida's Rich Cousin)Episode 43 (The Weekend)Episode 44 (The Baby)Episode 45 (Michael's Big Fall)Episode 46 (The Politicians)Episode 47 (Willona's Dilemma)Episode 48 (Florida's Protest)Episode 49 (The Mural)Episode 50 (A Loss of Confidence)Episode 51 (Cleatus)Episode 52 (The Family Tree)Episode 53 (A Place to Die)Episode 54 (J.J.'s Fiancee: Part 1)Episode 55 (J.J.'s Fiancee: Part 2)Episode 56 (Sweet Daddy Williams)Episode 57 (The Investigation)Episode 58 (J.J. in Trouble)Episode 59 (Florida the Woman)Episode 60 (The Break Up)Episode 61 (The Rent Party)The DVD Report",5,Absolutely Dy-no-mite...!,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,2908,"['Nominated', 'three', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Good', 'Times', 'premiered', 'mid-season', '1974', 'widespread', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'audience', 'popularity', 'spin-off', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'fame', 'sitcom', 'Maude', '1972', 'Good', 'Times', 'became', 'fourth', 'five', 'highly', 'successful', 'sitcoms', 'brought', 'being', '1970', 'decade', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'addition', 'Maude', 'sitcoms', 'were', 'All', 'Family', '1971', 'Sanford', 'Son', '1972', 'Jeffersons', '1975', 'second', 'three', 'focus', 'exclusively', 'African-American', 'family', 'life', 'Good', 'Times', 'became', 'source', 'groundbreaking', 'social', 'commentary', 'compliment', 'penchant', 'hilarious', 'family', 'comedy', 'Good', 'Times', 'centers', 'lives', 'James', 'John', 'Amos', 'Florida', 'Evans', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'African-American', 'couple', 'raising', 'three', 'children', 'Chicago', 'housing', 'development', 'Eldest', 'son', 'J.J.', 'Jimmie', 'Walker', 'skinny', 'wisecracking', 'ladies', 'man', 'affinity', 'painting', 'Middle', 'child', 'Thelma', 'BernNadette', 'Stanis', 'role', 'moderating', 'influence', 'passions', 'two', 'brothers', 'youngest', 'son', 'Michael', 'Ralph', 'Carter', 'always', 'involved', 'cause', 'help', 'others', 'end', 'injustice', 'family', 'often', 'visited', 'Florida', 'best', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'Willona', ""Ja'net"", 'DuBois', 'who', 'also', 'project', 'later', 'seasons', 'accompanied', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Penny', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'additional', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'overweight', 'super', 'Nathan', 'Bookman', 'Johnny', 'Brown', 'Good', 'Times', 'family-oriented', 'TV', 'series', 'laden', 'great', 'one-liners', 'plenty', 'laugh-tracks', 'Good', 'Times', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'A', 'Real', 'Cool', 'Job', 'James', 'having', 'taken', 'number', 'courses', 'trade', 'school', 'finally', 'offered', 'high-paying', 'job', 'dreams', 'catch', 'job', 'transfer', 'frozen', 'tundra', 'Alaska', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Love', 'Ghetto', 'Thelma', 'engaged', 'much', 'chagrin', 'James', 'Florida', 'Mural', 'J.J.', 'mural', 'bank', 'order', 'earn', 'money', 'necessary', 'Thelma', 'attend', 'college', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Good', 'Times', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '38', 'Real', 'Cool', 'Job', 'Episode', '39', 'Family', 'Gun', 'Episode', '40', 'Operation', 'Florida', 'Episode', '41', 'Love', 'Ghetto', 'Episode', '42', 'Florida', 'Rich', 'Cousin', 'Episode', '43', 'Weekend', 'Episode', '44', 'Baby', 'Episode', '45', 'Michael', 'Big', 'Fall', 'Episode', '46', 'Politicians', 'Episode', '47', 'Willona', 'Dilemma', 'Episode', '48', 'Florida', 'Protest', 'Episode', '49', 'Mural', 'Episode', '50', 'Loss', 'Confidence', 'Episode', '51', 'Cleatus', 'Episode', '52', 'Family', 'Tree', 'Episode', '53', 'Place', 'Die', 'Episode', '54', 'J.J.', 'Fiancee', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '55', 'J.J.', 'Fiancee', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '56', 'Sweet', 'Daddy', 'Williams', 'Episode', '57', 'Investigation', 'Episode', '58', 'J.J.', 'Trouble', 'Episode', '59', 'Florida', 'Woman', 'Episode', '60', 'Break', 'Up', 'Episode', '61', 'Rent', 'Party', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

826489,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000286S42,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[23, 23]","By Season Three, Good Times had fully hit its amazingly entertaining stride, delivering nonstop laughs week in and week out while beginning to introduce some more serious issues into the lives of the Evans family.  People always say that J.J. got the most attention, and he certainly did draw in a lion's share of the audience (especially kids like me, who placed him behind only Fonzie on our list of characters to be imitated) with his obligatory Kid Dy-No-Mite pronouncements and hilariously goofy behavior, but the heart and soul of Good Times was still James Evans.  Watching all these episodes again has been a real revelation to me.  When I was a kid, I didn't like James - he sort of scared me because he was yelling all the time.  As an adult, though, I have a much better appreciation of the remarkable job John Amos did playing such a strong and truly heroic husband and father who worked like a dog to support his family.  Amos gives his best performance ever in Season Three's episode The Family Tree, in which he meets and comes to terms with his own father, a man who walked out on his family when James was still a kid.  As for all that yelling - well, it's usually hilarious and, more importantly, understandable given the family's situation.The Evans family experienced a number of fairly momentous events in Season Three.  Thelma got engaged and almost moved to California; J.J. eloped, only finding out in the nick of time that his beloved was a junkie; Florida had to have gall bladder surgery, an event which put the family in bad economic straits for awhile (J.J.'s twelve cavities didn't help much, either); Michael got the family on the FBI watch list by requesting information from the government of Cuba; Florida got herself thrown in the slammer after picketing the local meat market (bad meat market, to be exact); Florida's bank-robbing nephew showed up and threw the family in turmoil; and J.J. learned he might have VD.  Jay Leno and Debbie Allen put in guest appearances, J.J. sported his chicken- and ribs-delivery hats for the first time, Bookman turned up again and actually put on quite a show at the season-ending rent party episode (which also features the memorable ""Supremes"" performance), and - best of all - you had the first appearance of the man, the legend, the icon - Sweet Daddy Williams.J.J.'s catch phrases can get a little old if you watch these episodes one after another, as do the constant arguments between J.J., Thelma, and Michael, but this was probably the show's funniest season.  There is even comedy to be found in the worst of the family's struggles.  Perhaps my favorite line from the whole show belongs to James - lamenting the money problems he faces after Florida's operation, he complains that his tombstone will say ""Here lies James Evans, back in the hole again.""

Good Times tackled issues on race, class, social status, the entire spectrum and the overall treatment of blacks in America as a whole especially the ones who were less educated and less fortunate than others. In response to the gentleman from Australia who wrote the review about Good Times being a racist show toward white people, I will have to disagree.  African Americans have more opportunites now than they did 30, 40, 50 years ago.  The show was not racist toward whites, blacks, or any other ethnic group.  It basically dealt with a poor, black family who had to make do with what they had simply because they were denied opoortunities to better their situations that people like Martin Luther King Jr., Mary Bethune, Fredrick Douglas, etc..worked tirelessly and hard for, so that we could have the same opportunities as everyone else in this beautiful country of ours.  To answer the gentleman's question about Good Times portraying whites in a positive light, actually there is an episode that did just that.  When Wilona (Janet Du bois) was trying to adopt Penny (Janet Jackson) the social worker who was played by a white woman, almost stop the adoption process simply because Wilona was not married.  But the social worker saw that Wilona had a good heart and was really sincere about providing a good, loving environment for the child, the social worker went ahead anyway with the adoption.  But of course to know that you will have to buy the DVD.  The producers of the show were white, in order for them to tell the story, they had to know the struggle.

Another ironic point about the show is that the two seinor leads(John Amos and Esther Rolle)both quit in a dispute over ""Mr Dynomite"" getting too big a starring role over them.",3,A funny show.but....,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",2004,794,"['Good', 'Times', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'portrayal', 'white', 'people', 'was', 'extremely', 'racist', 'White', 'people', 'were', 'portrayed', 'two', 'ways', 'show-either', 'incompetent', 'corrupt', 'entire', 'run', 'not', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'white', 'person', 'shown', 'positive', 'light', 'anyone', 'comment', 'then', 'invite', 'name', 'one', 'episode', 'ironic', 'show', 'struggles', 'black', 'people', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'have', 'hypocritical', 'attitude', 'What', 'pity', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fair', 'balanced', 'funny', 'show', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'themes', 'discouraging', 'kids', 'joining', 'gangs', 'ironic', 'point', 'show', 'two', 'seinor', 'leads', 'John', 'Amos', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'quit', 'dispute', 'Mr', 'Dynomite', 'getting', 'too', 'big', 'starring', 'role']",N/A

This season proves how essential and important the father was to the story.The first episode is entitled the Family Gun featuring James Sr. buying an illegal handgun to protect his family. In the meantime, Florida's purse was reported stolen but the African American police officer takes a week to visit their apartment and keeps calling her Georgia and keep repeating that it was a bicycle not a purse stolen. At the same time, the family gun goes missing. Worse, a 3 year old boy is shot with an unknown gun in the projects. Fortunately, the gun was hidden away by an unexpected member of the family and boy survived. Even during that morning, Thelma, the Evans' only teenage daughter, gets attacked and the policeman does nothing about it. I showed this episode on my last day of student teaching in Newark, New Jersey. My students live in the projects and these dangerous neighborhoods. Even all they go through, the Evans family remains intact until the network disables the family.Another episode has Florida going for an operation but her husband wants her to have the best so he take her to a better hospital.Another episode has a possible family separation when James Sr. takes a good-paying job in Alaska leaving his family behind in the projects, don't think that happens.Of course, the politicians episode is worth remembering because of the politics and differences between a young promising politican who wants to make things better and the incumbent who continues to keep playing the same useless role while he vacations in Bermuda and buys his wife a mink coat.Another episode has the Evans asking for assistance by Florida's wealthier cousins, Edgar and Betty. Sadly, times have fallen on them too.The supporting cast features Janet Dubois who plays WIllona Woods, the Evans beloved friend and neighbor, a divorcee with no children of her own. Jimmie Walker Jr. is dynmite in his unforgettable role of James Evans Jr. or J.J. as an aspiring artist with a passion for the ladies. Bernadette Stanis is also terrific and under-rated as the butt of his many sibling jokes. Regardless of the jokes among the family members, you can tell that they still love each other. Of course, Ralph Carter plays Michael Evans, the youngest, outspoken, African American with some radical ideas of his own to help his community. You can't leave out the roles of John Amos and Esther ROlle as James and Florida Evans, the loving couple and parents. Despite their ups and downs, they remained a family.

826509,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B000286S42,Twiddles42,"[8, 23]","I wish Columbia Star would give better restoration and DVD transfer treatment of the TV shows they're licensed to release.  But that won't ever happen so I may as well clam up and be a happy mindless consumer, grateful for any scraps they charge me $30 MSRP for.  :rollingeyes:  What happened to giving customers quality goods that they spend their hard earned money on?But I digress, this review is about the quality of the stories - not the quality of the medium (which should be higher, when you consider how DVD's been hyped as being a high quality medium and that other companies release even older shows that look much better...)I digress again!  I own season 1 and 2 box sets already.  They are definitely worth buying.  Season 1 is great stuff, if only 13 episodes.  Season 2 has a lot of good moments and a few great episodes, but seems to be giving more time to what became the WORST character of the bunch, JJ.  While ""DYNOMITE!"" was a worthy catchphrase whose delivery merely needed some polishing compared to season 1, they somehow changed the line and gave JJ a superhero status.  He became ""Kid DYN-O-MITE!"" for some unexplained reason.  This ""Kid DYN-O-MITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" stuff is excessively overplayed in many episodes, is generally anything except funny (it's hubris and pointless raving egoism), not to mention the character's personality is utterly abrasive and brainless and a pain to watch at times.  I'm amazed Florida puts up with half his antics and telling her how he's going to give hickeys with every girl he speaks of, as her persona in the first two seasons is the epitome of Christianity (she's far more a true Christian than many who claim to be these days...).  (Also, behind the scenes, both Esther Rolle and John Amos became increasingly frustrated with the CBS execs because of Jimmy Walker and the waste of a character known as JJ.  They wanted the show to have some substance, but Jimmy Walker's (now badly dated) shtick was funny at the time so he got the glory instead, and the leads were told to lump it.  No wonder they both left...)""Good Times"" had real potential.  Season 1 is easily the best of the bunch, with season 2 being a worthy purchase given the strength of the stories, even if JJ is starting to become a pantomime caricature...  I will reluctantly purchase season 3, but I suspect it's going to be devoid of all the qualities Norman Lear was famous for in his comedies (social commentary, and all thanks to copying a British TV show when he 'created' ""All in the Family""!).  Season 2 is clearly more JJ-centric, with season 3 going even more in that direction despite the first couple of stories trying to remain on solid ground (the gun episode being one of the few times the execs dared to put the show to rights, but they cowered and went back to the JJ antics...)Back to ""All in the Family"", that show seems to get (less than) one season per year.  For a 9+ year show, this release schedule is uacceptable.  Worse, the third season of AitF was due out 6 months ago in order to have maintained at annual release schedule.  Could Columbia be releasing that show for ironically political reasons?  But at least it's coming out, as it's arguably the best season that show had.(And where's ""Maude""?!  It's the only Norman Lear-based show that hasn't been released yet...)",2,Why's this show getting pushed faster than All in the Family,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,3326,"['wish', 'Columbia', 'Star', 'would', 'give', 'better', 'restoration', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'treatment', 'TV', ""'re"", 'licensed', 'release', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'happen', 'so', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'clam', 'up', 'be', 'happy', 'mindless', 'consumer', 'grateful', 'scraps', 'charge', '30', 'MSRP', 'rollingeyes', 'What', 'happened', 'giving', 'customers', 'quality', 'goods', 'spend', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'digress', 'review', 'quality', 'stories', 'not', 'quality', 'medium', 'should', 'be', 'higher', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'DVD', 'been', 'hyped', 'being', 'high', 'quality', 'medium', 'other', 'companies', 'release', 'even', 'older', 'shows', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'digress', 'again', 'own', 'season', '1', '2', 'box', 'sets', 'already', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'Season', '1', 'great', 'stuff', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'lot', 'good', 'moments', 'few', 'great', 'episodes', 'be', 'giving', 'more', 'time', 'what', 'became', 'WORST', 'character', 'bunch', 'JJ', 'DYNOMITE', 'was', 'worthy', 'catchphrase', 'delivery', 'merely', 'needed', 'polishing', 'compared', 'season', '1', 'somehow', 'changed', 'line', 'gave', 'JJ', 'superhero', 'status', 'became', 'Kid', 'DYN-O-MITE', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'Kid', 'DYN-O-MITE', 'stuff', 'excessively', 'overplayed', 'many', 'episodes', 'generally', 'anything', 'funny', 'hubris', 'pointless', 'raving', 'egoism', 'not', 'mention', 'character', 'personality', 'utterly', 'abrasive', 'brainless', 'pain', 'watch', 'times', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'Florida', 'up', 'antics', 'telling', 'how', 'going', 'give', 'hickeys', 'girl', 'persona', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'epitome', 'Christianity', 'far', 'more', 'true', 'Christian', 'many', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'days', 'Also', 'scenes', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'John', 'Amos', 'became', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'CBS', 'execs', 'Jimmy', 'Walker', 'waste', 'character', 'known', 'JJ', 'wanted', 'show', 'have', 'substance', 'Jimmy', 'Walker', 'now', 'badly', 'dated', 'shtick', 'was', 'funny', 'time', 'got', 'glory', 'instead', 'leads', 'were', 'told', 'lump', 'wonder', 'left', 'Good', 'Times', 'had', 'real', 'potential', 'Season', '1', 'easily', 'best', 'bunch', 'season', '2', 'being', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'given', 'strength', 'stories', 'even', 'JJ', 'starting', 'become', 'pantomime', 'caricature', 'will', 'reluctantly', 'purchase', 'season', '3', 'suspect', 'going', 'be', 'devoid', 'qualities', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'was', 'famous', 'comedies', 'social', 'commentary', 'thanks', 'copying', 'British', 'TV', 'show', 'when', ""'created"", 'Family', 'Season', '2', 'clearly', 'more', 'JJ-centric', 'season', '3', 'going', 'even', 'more', 'direction', 'first', 'couple', 'stories', 'trying', 'remain', 'solid', 'ground', 'gun', 'episode', 'being', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'execs', 'dared', 'put', 'show', 'rights', 'cowered', 'went', 'back', 'JJ', 'antics', 'Back', 'Family', 'show', 'get', 'less', 'one', 'season', 'year', '9+', 'year', 'show', 'release', 'schedule', 'uacceptable', 'Worse', 'third', 'season', 'AitF', 'was', 'due', 'out', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'order', 'have', 'maintained', 'annual', 'release', 'schedule', 'Could', 'Columbia', 'be', 'releasing', 'show', 'ironically', 'political', 'reasons', 'least', 'coming', 'out', 'arguably', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'where', 'Maude', 'only', 'Norman', 'Lear-based', 'show', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'yet']",N/A
