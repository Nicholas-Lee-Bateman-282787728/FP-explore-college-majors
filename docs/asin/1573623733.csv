189396,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1573623733,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[49, 50]","This is director Kasi Lemmons' first film and she has entered the world of cinema with a very bold start.  Eve's Bayou is a very passionate story about life and love with a family surrounded by dark secrets.  Lemmons' has boldly introduced us to a world in which magic is obvious and characters are deeply developed.  There isn't one actor in this film that you do not fully appreciate.  Everyone in this film gives everything that they have to help create this hidden masterpiece.  Roger Ebert named this film the best of 1997, and I agree whole-heartedly.  What makes this film different from other films of this nature is that Lemmons keeps us grounded.  We are constantly reminded of where we are and whom we are dealing with.  There is not some outside element trying to sneak in and disrupt the peace; it is a completely internal movie that allows us to devote ourselves to this desperate family.  She controls Jackson with the greatest of ease, and gives us one of the most powerful child performances ever.  If I had the chance to give the Oscar to Jurnee Smollett for her role of Eve in this film, I would have gladly handed it to her.  Her performance commanded the film.  She was the strongest and most beautifully developed character in this film.  Smollett was outstanding.  I have never been so impressed with a child actor as I was with her in this film.  Her eyes gave us all the drama that we needed.  I never thought that I would witness acting in its purest form come from a child.  For anything, this film is worth seeing just for the performance of Smollett.  She literally steals the scenes from everyone, even Mr. Jackson.I mentioned earlier that I loved the fact that this film kept us grounded by continually showing us scenes from the bayou.  It kept our minds focused on where we were and the environment that surrounded these troubled people.  Amazingly, Lemmons has transformed this setting into more than just a place, she has given it life.  Not only through our characters, but it also is the center of most of the magic that occurs.  It is a very symbolic reference.  A bayou is a creek or a secondary waterway that is a passageway to another larger body of water.  In this film, Eve represents the bayou as she travels to her family, the larger body of water.  Also, whenever Mozelle calls upon the ""spirits"" her first sight is of the bayou.  Lemmons may be saying that the bayou is more than just water, it is the center of everyone's universe in this town.  Perhaps it has more meanings, but I really felt that Lemmons was using the bayou as more than just a place setting, it spoke to me more about the characters.Finally, I would like to add that coupled with the amazing acting, Lemmons gives some of the most memorable direction behind the camera.  The scenes when Mozelle speaks about how she lost her second husband (the one that loved her the most) because her lover wanted her to himself was riveting.  Told through the mirror, this was one of the most interesting ways to tell a flashback.  Instead of using the classic ""black and white"" or faded lines trick, Lemmons actually brought the scene to us.  We witness it firsthand and this allows us to be impacted deeper.  I felt the connection, and it worked.Overall, this was a gem.  I wasn't expecting to see such a caliber of acting and direction as I did in this film.  The cinematography was outstanding.  Lemmons has an eye and a passion for this film, and it is apparent with every scene that she captures.  The Batiste family engulfs all of your emotion.  Lemmons takes innocent children and captures you within their world, giving you only brief moments to breathe.  She shows us the power behind Jackson's voice and the ability he has to expand his career.  This was a surprise for me, but a well enjoyed surprise.  I suggest you check this film out when time permits.  It is a rare find that you will probably see in the bargain bin at any local store.  Pick it up and enjoy it.  I do not think you will be disappointed.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Memory is a selection of images...,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,4048,"['director', 'Kasi', 'Lemmons', 'first', 'film', 'entered', 'world', 'cinema', 'very', 'bold', 'start', 'Eve', 'Bayou', 'very', 'passionate', 'story', 'life', 'love', 'family', 'surrounded', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Lemmons', 'boldly', 'introduced', 'world', 'magic', 'obvious', 'characters', 'are', 'deeply', 'developed', ""n't"", 'one', 'actor', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'Everyone', 'film', 'everything', 'have', 'help', 'create', 'hidden', 'masterpiece', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'named', 'film', 'best', '1997', 'agree', 'whole-heartedly', 'What', 'film', 'different', 'other', 'films', 'nature', 'Lemmons', 'grounded', 'are', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'where', 'are', 'whom', 'are', 'dealing', 'not', 'outside', 'element', 'trying', 'sneak', 'disrupt', 'peace', 'completely', 'internal', 'movie', 'devote', 'desperate', 'family', 'Jackson', 'greatest', 'ease', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'child', 'performances', 'ever', 'had', 'chance', 'give', 'Oscar', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'role', 'Eve', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'gladly', 'handed', 'performance', 'commanded', 'film', 'was', 'strongest', 'most', 'beautifully', 'developed', 'character', 'film', 'Smollett', 'was', 'outstanding', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'impressed', 'child', 'actor', 'was', 'film', 'eyes', 'gave', 'drama', 'needed', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'witness', 'acting', 'purest', 'form', 'come', 'child', 'anything', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'performance', 'Smollett', 'literally', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'even', 'Mr.', 'Jackson.I', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'loved', 'fact', 'film', 'kept', 'grounded', 'continually', 'showing', 'scenes', 'bayou', 'kept', 'minds', 'focused', 'where', 'were', 'environment', 'surrounded', 'troubled', 'people', 'Amazingly', 'Lemmons', 'transformed', 'setting', 'more', 'just', 'place', 'given', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'characters', 'also', 'center', 'most', 'magic', 'very', 'symbolic', 'reference', 'bayou', 'creek', 'secondary', 'waterway', 'passageway', 'larger', 'body', 'water', 'film', 'Eve', 'bayou', 'family', 'larger', 'body', 'water', 'Also', 'whenever', 'Mozelle', 'spirits', 'first', 'sight', 'bayou', 'Lemmons', 'may', 'be', 'saying', 'bayou', 'more', 'just', 'water', 'center', 'everyone', 'universe', 'town', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'meanings', 'really', 'felt', 'Lemmons', 'was', 'using', 'bayou', 'more', 'just', 'place', 'setting', 'spoke', 'more', 'characters.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'coupled', 'amazing', 'acting', 'Lemmons', 'most', 'memorable', 'direction', 'camera', 'scenes', 'when', 'Mozelle', 'how', 'lost', 'second', 'husband', 'one', 'loved', 'most', 'lover', 'wanted', 'was', 'riveting', 'Told', 'mirror', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'ways', 'tell', 'flashback', 'Instead', 'using', 'classic', 'black', 'white', 'faded', 'lines', 'trick', 'Lemmons', 'actually', 'brought', 'scene', 'witness', 'firsthand', 'be', 'impacted', 'deeper', 'felt', 'connection', 'worked.Overall', 'was', 'gem', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'see', 'such', 'caliber', 'acting', 'direction', 'did', 'film', 'cinematography', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Lemmons', 'eye', 'passion', 'film', 'apparent', 'scene', 'Batiste', 'family', 'emotion', 'Lemmons', 'innocent', 'children', 'captures', 'world', 'giving', 'only', 'brief', 'moments', 'breathe', 'power', 'Jackson', 'voice', 'ability', 'expand', 'career', 'was', 'surprise', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'surprise', 'suggest', 'check', 'film', 'when', 'time', 'rare', 'find', 'will', 'probably', 'see', 'bargain', 'bin', 'local', 'store', 'Pick', 'up', 'enjoy', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.Grade', '****', '*****']",N/A

189400,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1573623733,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 9]","I walked into `Eve's Bayou' with high expectations.  One of my film snob friends (I can call him that, he's cool with it) said that this was one of the greatest ensemble pieces of all time, and while I wasn't really sure what all the movie was about and had really heard nothing about it, I took his word for it anyways and decided to give it a watch through.Sadly, I think he was wrong; dead wrong.I will say this for the movie; I actually thought that its premise was smart, to an extent.  The final frames of the film are truly the most enlightening when in regards to the overall message of the film, and they are haunting to a degree, but getting to that moment was far from exceptional.  The film focuses on a close nit family living in 1962 Louisiana.  The film opens with Eve Batiste voice telling us that she killed her father when she was ten.  Then the film takes us to the summer that took place and shows us all the events leading up to it.  It all starts with young Eve witnessing her father in the arms of another woman and then spirals down from there.  The film broadens from the subject of infidelity to eclipse Eve's entire family, including the very spiritual Mozelle Batiste Delacroix, Eve's Aunt.The story told has its high points as well as many low points (especially when in regards to Mezelle's character) that take away from the overall impact of the film.  I found my interested waning quite a bit throughout the film, wondering what all the buzz was about.  The script could have used some tightening, or at list a little more focus (in the right places) and the direction, which tended to lose interest with the film, could have been reeled in to try and keep the audience interested in what was going on.I know I am in the minority here, but I have to speak my truth.I was also very unimpressed with the acting, the foundation for which most of the praise has been heaped.  I thought that Jurnee Smollett (who is such a familiar child actress) was very unbelievable as Eve.  She appeared over the top and rehearsed, as if she was reading her lines from a cue card.  Samuel L. Jackson was decent but rarely seen, even if his character was the basis of the films initial focus.  Lyn Whitfield had promise, but was ill used.  A lot of praise has been handed to Debbi Morgan for a performance that I consider to be the worst in the bunch.  She was horrifically mannered and very unimpressive, delivering a performance that felt clich&eacute;d and uninspired.  Meagan Good was actually the only acting force in the film for me.  She felt natural and well cast, and in the end she is the only character for which I have any lasting interest in.  It's a shame that she has yet to expound on the possibilities within her career.Like I mentioned, in the final throws of this film there is light of brilliance, for the premise is one that is unique and inspiring, but the handling of the premise of never done so with the technique it deserves.  I love the last few moments of the film, but getting there was much too difficult; and quite frankly the end result is not worth the journey one takes to get there.",2,"It has so much promise, yet it fails to deliver...",1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,3131,"['walked', 'Eve', 'Bayou', 'high', 'expectations', 'One', 'film', 'snob', 'friends', 'can', 'call', 'that', 'cool', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'had', 'really', 'heard', 'nothing', 'took', 'word', 'decided', 'give', 'watch', 'through.Sadly', 'think', 'was', 'wrong', 'dead', 'wrong.I', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'actually', 'thought', 'premise', 'was', 'smart', 'extent', 'final', 'frames', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'most', 'enlightening', 'when', 'regards', 'overall', 'message', 'film', 'are', 'haunting', 'degree', 'getting', 'moment', 'was', 'far', 'exceptional', 'film', 'close', 'nit', 'family', 'living', '1962', 'Louisiana', 'film', 'Eve', 'Batiste', 'voice', 'telling', 'killed', 'father', 'when', 'was', 'ten', 'Then', 'film', 'summer', 'took', 'place', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'young', 'Eve', 'witnessing', 'father', 'arms', 'woman', 'then', 'spirals', 'down', 'there', 'film', 'broadens', 'subject', 'infidelity', 'eclipse', 'Eve', 'entire', 'family', 'including', 'very', 'spiritual', 'Mozelle', 'Batiste', 'Delacroix', 'Eve', 'Aunt.The', 'story', 'told', 'high', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'low', 'points', 'especially', 'when', 'regards', 'Mezelle', 'character', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'found', 'interested', 'waning', 'quite', 'bit', 'film', 'wondering', 'what', 'buzz', 'was', 'about', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'tightening', 'list', 'little', 'more', 'focus', 'right', 'places', 'direction', 'tended', 'lose', 'interest', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'reeled', 'try', 'keep', 'audience', 'interested', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on.I', 'know', 'am', 'minority', 'here', 'have', 'speak', 'truth.I', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'unimpressed', 'acting', 'foundation', 'most', 'praise', 'been', 'heaped', 'thought', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'who', 'familiar', 'child', 'actress', 'was', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'Eve', 'appeared', 'top', 'rehearsed', 'was', 'reading', 'lines', 'cue', 'card', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'was', 'decent', 'rarely', 'seen', 'even', 'character', 'was', 'basis', 'films', 'initial', 'focus', 'Lyn', 'Whitfield', 'had', 'promise', 'was', 'ill', 'used', 'lot', 'praise', 'been', 'handed', 'Debbi', 'Morgan', 'performance', 'consider', 'be', 'worst', 'bunch', 'was', 'horrifically', 'mannered', 'very', 'unimpressive', 'delivering', 'performance', 'felt', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'uninspired', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'was', 'actually', 'only', 'acting', 'force', 'film', 'felt', 'natural', 'well', 'cast', 'end', 'only', 'character', 'have', 'lasting', 'interest', 'shame', 'yet', 'expound', 'possibilities', 'career.Like', 'mentioned', 'final', 'throws', 'film', 'light', 'brilliance', 'premise', 'one', 'unique', 'inspiring', 'handling', 'premise', 'never', 'done', 'so', 'technique', 'love', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'getting', 'there', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'difficult', 'quite', 'frankly', 'end', 'result', 'not', 'worth', 'journey', 'one', 'get', 'there']",N/A

Beautifully acted and masterfully conceived of the supernatural on the bayou. An absorbing story that has an otherworldliness to it and that is what makes this film  exceptional, everything from budu, fortunetellers and spells are interwoven  into the story in a fascinating way. But also the acting is truly  impressive, not a bum characterization in the whole cast, even the younger  cast members are great. Lynn Whitfield delivers a powerful performance as  Jackson's tortured wife who must put up with Jackson's affairs with other  women to keep a stable household but yet is in denial of what is happening  around her. Debbi Morgan is also memorable as Jackson's sister who has a  supernatural gift. There is a scene where she explains the death of her  second husband to young Smollett that is masterfully surreal, a gem of a  scene that is a highpoint in the film, as is the powerful ending. Samuel L.  Jackson delivers a powerful performance, he recuperated after a career  slump after 'Pulp Fiction'. But heading this terrific cast is the young  Jurnee Smollett, she plays a key role and carries the whole film on her  shoulders. A lyrical drama with surreal undertones.

Beautifully acted and masterfully conceived of the supernatural on the bayou. It takes you back to a time when magic and voodoo were really big and highly believed in. An absorbing story that has otherworldliness to it and that is what makes this film exceptional, everything from bayou, fortunetellers and spells are interwoven into the story in a fascinating way. But also the acting is truly impressive, not a bum characterization in the whole cast, even the younger cast members are great.Lynn Whitfield who is beautiful and poised has delivers a powerful performance as Jackson's tortured wife who must put up with Jackson's affairs with other women to keep a stable household but yet is in denial of what is happening around her. Debbi Morgan is also memorable as Jackson's sister who has a supernatural gift. There is a scene where she explains the death of her second husband to young Smollett that is masterfully surreal, a gem of a scene that is a highpoint in the film, as is the powerful ending. The performance of Eve (Smollett) almost stopped my heart, that little girl could really make you feel what she was feeling and boy can she act. And Cisely (Good) also did a wonderful job. I really cried with her and my heart went out to her; she only loved her father.Samuel L. Jackson delivers a powerful performance; as the doctor-father whose need for love and affirmation is so engulfing that he seeks it anywhere and everywhere.But heading this terrific cast is the young Jurnee Smollett; she plays a key role and carries the whole film on her shoulders.

Eve is the middle child of an upper-class black Creole  family in Louisiana; her father, a doctor, is a compulsive womanizer, searching for the admiration he is denied by his beautiful but frigid wife.  When Eve catches her father cheating on her mother, she wants to punish him, and in her rage, she brings about his destruction.Eve has the gift of Sight, which was passed on to her from her aunt; throughout most of the film she is unaware of her powers and only at the film's end does she begin to realize what she has inherited and the responsibility it brings with it.  Eve's older sister is their father's favorite, she's his princess, the light of his life, and when her hero-worship of him takes on sexual undertones of which she herself, in her innocence, is unaware, she takes his violent reaction and repulse as a stunning rejection of her as a female and as his child.The acting in the film is superb throughout.  Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as the doctor-father whose need for love and affirmation is so engulfing that he seeks it anywhere and everywhere; Lynne Whitfield is just right as his starched, immaculate and rejected wife;  Debbi Morgan makes the most out of a great role as Eve's aunt, who drives  men to their deaths without even trying, and Journee Smollett gives a knockout performance as the young Eve.

I have NEVER forgotten it!What you see may NOT always be what is true...or is it???EVE'S BAYOU is a totally absorbing and genuinely well directed and performed film of great sensitivity and nuance. From the opening of the shocking line ""That was the year I killed my father"", EVE'S BAYOU is a continued exposing of layers of secrets, betrayals, misinterpretations and murder that have effected generations of the Batiste family, descendants of a white Frenchman and a black slave woman's sixteen children in the Louisiana Bayou.What starts with the youngest daughter Eve (an incredible Jurnee Smollett) witnessing her father (Samuel L. Jackson) and a family friend (Lisa Nicole Carson) having sex in the carriage house, blossoms into an intrigue of forced silence and unbearable secrecy and ultimate hatred for her father and her over protective mother (Lynn Whitfield)and jealousy and mistrust of her older sister Cisely.With a magnificently acted supporting role as Aunt Mozelle the ""healing psychic"", Debbi Morgan becomes the glue through which the family confronts ""the truth."" The problem is that for one reason or another all involved have their own interpretations of ""the truth"" which leads Eve to seek out the local ""Voodoo"" Lady ( a truly outstanding Diahann Carroll).At this point I will stop.What happens here totally throws the story into a mysterious and downright creepy high gear....and WHAT AN INTERESTING ENDING!!!!This is truly a well done piece of story telling and film making by Kasi Lemmons (SEE HER 2007 film TALK TO ME with Don Cheadle- OUTSTANDING!). Lemmons, as an actress herself, truly allows her stars to interpret the material in a very professional yet natural way. Lemmons does not rush scenes. She allows a tremendous amount of space for the viewer to digest what is transpiring.She allows the moss covered bayou to be savoured and contemplated and the underscoring of Terence Blanchard's original soundtrackbreathes gently throughout the film. This is an outstanding film and will be likely viewed many times for it's story, artistic direction ,camera work and thoughtful and riveting performances. I can totally see why critic Roger Ebert felt that EVE'S BAYOU was the best film of 1997!Excellent companion films would be THE SWEET HEREAFTER (especially!!!), SOMETHING ABOUT AMELIA, BELOVED, MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL and THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD and STEEL MAGNOLIAS(for more about Louisiana life).",5,"His side,her side and the truth: A shocking BAYOU",1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,2544,"['grandmother', 'once', 'said', 'are', 'three', 'sides', 'story', 'side', 'side', 'truth', 'have', 'NEVER', 'forgotten', 'What', 'see', 'may', 'NOT', 'always', 'be', 'what', 'true', 'EVE', 'BAYOU', 'totally', 'absorbing', 'genuinely', 'well', 'directed', 'performed', 'film', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'nuance', 'opening', 'shocking', 'line', 'was', 'year', 'killed', 'father', 'EVE', 'BAYOU', 'continued', 'exposing', 'layers', 'secrets', 'betrayals', 'misinterpretations', 'murder', 'have', 'effected', 'generations', 'Batiste', 'family', 'descendants', 'white', 'Frenchman', 'black', 'slave', 'woman', 'sixteen', 'children', 'Louisiana', 'Bayou.What', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Eve', 'incredible', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'witnessing', 'father', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'family', 'friend', 'Lisa', 'Nicole', 'Carson', 'having', 'sex', 'carriage', 'house', 'blossoms', 'intrigue', 'forced', 'silence', 'unbearable', 'secrecy', 'ultimate', 'hatred', 'father', 'protective', 'mother', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'jealousy', 'mistrust', 'older', 'sister', 'Cisely.With', 'magnificently', 'acted', 'supporting', 'role', 'Aunt', 'Mozelle', 'healing', 'psychic', 'Debbi', 'Morgan', 'glue', 'family', 'truth', 'problem', 'one', 'reason', 'involved', 'have', 'own', 'interpretations', 'truth', 'Eve', 'seek', 'out', 'local', 'Voodoo', 'Lady', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', '.At', 'point', 'will', 'stop.What', 'here', 'totally', 'story', 'mysterious', 'downright', 'creepy', 'high', 'gear', '.and', 'WHAT', 'AN', 'INTERESTING', 'ENDING', 'truly', 'well', 'done', 'piece', 'story', 'telling', 'film', 'making', 'Kasi', 'Lemmons', 'SEE', 'HER', '2007', 'film', 'TALK', 'TO', 'ME', 'Don', 'Cheadle-', 'OUTSTANDING', 'Lemmons', 'actress', 'truly', 'stars', 'interpret', 'material', 'very', 'professional', 'yet', 'natural', 'way', 'Lemmons', 'not', 'rush', 'scenes', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'space', 'viewer', 'digest', 'what', 'transpiring.She', 'moss', 'covered', 'bayou', 'be', 'savoured', 'contemplated', 'underscoring', 'Terence', 'Blanchard', 'original', 'soundtrackbreathes', 'gently', 'film', 'outstanding', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'likely', 'viewed', 'many', 'times', 'story', 'artistic', 'direction', 'camera', 'work', 'thoughtful', 'riveting', 'performances', 'can', 'totally', 'see', 'why', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'felt', 'EVE', 'BAYOU', 'was', 'best', 'film', '1997', 'Excellent', 'companion', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'THE', 'SWEET', 'HEREAFTER', 'especially', 'SOMETHING', 'ABOUT', 'AMELIA', 'BELOVED', 'MIDNIGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'GARDEN', 'OF', 'GOOD', 'AND', 'EVIL', 'THE', 'YA-YA', 'SISTERHOOD', 'STEEL', 'MAGNOLIAS', 'more', 'Louisiana', 'life']",N/A

Without the shuffling and attempts at assimilation, some movies are pure beauty. ""Eve's Bayou"" is that kind of movie. Itis only unfortunate that the flashback movies that remind us so much of our culture in the South (the lead character is a doctor that makes house calls) tend to also revolve around how callous we can be as a people. Along this same line is Denzel's ""Devil in a Blue Dress,"" which captured the black neighborhood in a way that few movies have.""Eve's Bayou"" is a movie about family -- and infidelity. I do not want to give much away, but suffice it to say that in the South, the believe in spirituality is not limited to Christianity; there are those of us who delve into voodoo and, among some of our other people, you have Santeria and Curandismo. The belief that a curse culd be put one someone is at the root of a young girl's concern about and commitment to her famliy and, more profoundly, her doctor-father. He is a dawg. He has relationships with other women but takes care of his home. At the end he dies in a way that many black men back then died: allowing machismo to get in the way of common sense. And we're STILL dying like that.At any rate, ""Eve's Bayou"" is the kind of movie that should be shown in every Black Literature, Contemporary Literature and History of the American South course that is offered at the university level.

Eve's Bayou is a town founded by a freed slave.  Our heroine is named after her predecessor.Eve's father, Louis (Samuel L. Jackson) is the town's doctor and he fancies himself as a ladies' man.  Her mother, Roz (Lynne Whitfield) chooses to turn a blind eye to his infidelities.  Eve has an older sister and younger brother.  But the most colorful is her Aunt Mozelle (Debbi Morgan).  Mozelle has visions of things to come and people come to seek her help.  When she has a vision it always comes true.  She also has a curse.  All of her husbands have died.But reality hits this fantasy land first when Eve accompanies her father on a house call and it becomes evident to her that daddy was doing more than helping the sick woman.  Then at a party Eve goes out to the shed and falls asleep.  But she is awakened by her father with another woman, a woman with her own man.Things continue to spiral out of control when Mozelle has a vision that a child is going to be killed by a train.  Roz panics and keeps the kids confined to the house until the premonition comes true.  In the process, Eve's older sister withdraws from the family but it it's not what everyone thinks.This is a great film with breakout performance by Debbi Morgan (well sort of as she has been giving great performances for 20 years.)

Miss Morgan won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female as well as numerous other film critics prizes for her amazing performance that year. But she was sadly overlooked when it came to the Oscar nominations. It's really sad that Hollywood still ignores great talent from actors of different minorities. In today's society I find that actors of different minorities still aren't being given the recognition they solely deserve based on the simple fact of doing great work. Hollywood still has a long way to go before things start to really change.One of the classic scenes from the film is when Aunt Mozelle (Debbie Morgan) tells her niece the story of when her lover killed her husband right in front of her in cold blood. This is when Kasi Lemmons, as a director and writer, is at her best. It also one of the best scenes where you can see Debbie Morgan put her acting chops to work. As Aunt Mozelle begins to describe in great detail how the whole tragic incident unfolded, we as the viewer see the images of her lover and husband in the mirrow behind her. As she continues telling the story she slowly walks over to the mirror making an amazing transition (with the help of great camera work) into the past. We then see her become part of the reenactment as she interacts with the images of her husband and lover while still continuing to narrate the story. It's is very compelling to watch the whole scene unfold and I promise you that you will glued to your seat watching it.The rest of the cast is very remarkable including Lynne Whitfield, Samuel L. Jackson and newcomer Jurnee Smollett. I will not go any further and spoil the whole storyline for you.

Writer/director Kasi Lemmons weaves an intricate story of love, death, and coming of age in the bayous of Louisiana.  As the film begins, Eve Batiste (played by Jurnee Smollett) is one of the three children of Louis Batiste (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and Roz Batiste (played by Lynn Whitfield).  Louis, as the town doctor, is a man of wealth and status in the rural African-American community of Eve's Bayou; but he has a weakness for the many women who are drawn to him, and Roz tries to pretend not to know.  Eve's older sister Cicely (played by Meagan Good), a girl on the threshold of womanhood, seems particularly torn by the disintegration of the Batiste family.  Eve's Bayou is also a community where vodoun plays a daily role in the lives of the people; Roz's sister Mozelle (played by Debbi Morgan) is a practitioner of the art, who has lost three husbands and fears she may be cursed, a ""black widow.""  Also crucial to the vodoun elements of the story is Elzora (played by Diahann Carroll), an old woman of the community who has a reputation as a ""witch.""  Eve becomes aware of her father's infidelities, grows angry over one particularly horrible accusation, and unleashes a chain of events that ends in tragedy; and right up until the end of the film, one is never altogether sure of what really happened.

Diahann Carroll works you because her character is not at all glamorous but pivotal to the plot as Eve comes to realize the responsibility of her &quot;gift&quot; and learns the truth of the age-old adage, &quot;Be careful what you wish for, for you just might get it.&quot; Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as usual and perfectly cast.  While his character is not necessarily sympathetic, he is totally understandable and for a little girl who worships her father he is perfectly cast.  While some aspects of the father-daughter relationship may be somehwat uncomfortable, the director does a beautiful job bringing the complexity of these issues to the screen and I heartily applaud her.  This is one that belongs in any movie collection and one where African-American life is celebrated and treated with the utmost respect and honesty.

189445,A170QM825KM60W,1573623733,rmcrae,"[5, 5]","Set in the Lousiana bayous of 1962, Eve's Bayou tells the story of the seemingly happy, well to do Batiste family. Patriarch Louis (Samuel L. Jackson) is a respected doctor married to his beautiful and elegant wife Roz (Lynn Whitfield), and the doting father of 3 children: 14 year old Cisely (Meagan Good), 10 year old Eve (Jurnee Smollett), and 9 year old Poe (Jake Smollett). Everything looks lovely on the surface. However, looks can be decieving.Unbeknownst to outsiders, Louis is also a philandering alcoholic and Roz struggles to keep her marriage afloat while also dealing with her oldest daughter's coming of age and rebellion. Little Eve is a very rambunctious, curious little girl constantly teasing her little brother, but has no idea of the turmoil facing her family.During the summer months of that year, many dark secrets come to light and threaten to tear the family apart. Eve's discovery of her father's womanizing is just the beginning of several revelations leading up to a tragic event.Louis's sister Mozelle (Debbi Morgan) is the local psychic and Eve's closest confidant, but her life is filled with pain and heartbreak as well. Married 3 times, all of her husbands met untimely deaths and she's been cursed as a black widow, blind to her own life. When she finds a new love (Vondie Curtis-Hall), she's at a crossroads. Should she take a chance on him or be doomed to spend her days in solitude?It's pretty rare to find a movie where all the performances are excellent, but this one is it. Jurnee's (who was only 10 years old at the time of shooting) performance was the most spellbinding. She walked a fine line between a fiesty, smart mouthed brat and a little girl wise beyond her years who wanted everything in her family to stay the same. Why she wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.Same with Debbie Morgan. Her mirror scene and her emotional monologue with Eve alone should've guaranteed her a win. Although Eve is her niece, the two are so much alike (both physically and personality wise) that she could easily be her daughter. The scenes in which they interact are some of the biggest highlights of the film.Sam Jackson's amazing as both a smooth operator (a cheater, but still a smooth talker) and a loving father. Instead of simply playing on the stereotype of the beautiful wife done wrong, Lynn Whitfield is impressive by bringing such depth to the character of Roz. One scene in which she reflects on the first time she met her husband and immediately thought of him as a healer who would take care of her, only to find out he's ""just a man"" is particularly moving. You really feel her pain.It's a shame Meagan Good hasn't been able to find other roles like Cisely. At just 14 or 15 at the time, she was also able to turn in a performance so emotive and far beyond her years. One part of her wants to rebel against and hurt her mother, but at the same time she wants to be just like her. She's in a state of such pain and confusion. She feels lost. Veteran actress Diahann Caroll delivers a bone chilling portrayal of Elzora, a witchy practitioner of the dark arts whom Eve calls upon to help her seek revenge.The soundtrack is beautiful and haunting as well with Erykah Badu's jazzy lament Child With the Blues taking the cake. In closing, sit back and enjoy a Southern gothic tale with twists, turns, and an ending that will leave you breathless.",5,A child with the blues,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3401,"['Set', 'Lousiana', 'bayous', '1962', 'Eve', 'Bayou', 'story', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'well', 'do', 'Batiste', 'family', 'Patriarch', 'Louis', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'respected', 'doctor', 'married', 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'wife', 'Roz', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'doting', 'father', '3', 'children', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Cisely', 'Meagan', 'Good', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Eve', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', '9', 'year', 'old', 'Poe', 'Jake', 'Smollett', 'Everything', 'lovely', 'surface', 'However', 'can', 'be', 'decieving.Unbeknownst', 'outsiders', 'Louis', 'also', 'philandering', 'alcoholic', 'Roz', 'keep', 'marriage', 'afloat', 'also', 'dealing', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'coming', 'age', 'rebellion', 'Little', 'Eve', 'very', 'rambunctious', 'curious', 'little', 'girl', 'constantly', 'teasing', 'little', 'brother', 'idea', 'turmoil', 'facing', 'family.During', 'summer', 'months', 'year', 'many', 'dark', 'secrets', 'come', 'light', 'threaten', 'tear', 'family', 'apart', 'Eve', 'discovery', 'father', 'womanizing', 'just', 'beginning', 'several', 'revelations', 'leading', 'up', 'tragic', 'event.Louis', 'sister', 'Mozelle', 'Debbi', 'Morgan', 'local', 'psychic', 'Eve', 'closest', 'confidant', 'life', 'filled', 'pain', 'heartbreak', 'as', 'well', 'Married', '3', 'times', 'husbands', 'met', 'untimely', 'deaths', 'been', 'cursed', 'black', 'widow', 'blind', 'own', 'life', 'When', 'new', 'love', 'Vondie', 'Curtis-Hall', 'crossroads', 'Should', 'take', 'chance', 'be', 'doomed', 'spend', 'days', 'solitude', 'pretty', 'rare', 'find', 'movie', 'where', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'one', 'Jurnee', 'who', 'was', 'only', '10', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'shooting', 'performance', 'was', 'most', 'spellbinding', 'walked', 'fine', 'line', 'fiesty', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'brat', 'little', 'girl', 'wise', 'years', 'who', 'wanted', 'everything', 'family', 'stay', 'same', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'least', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'me.Same', 'Debbie', 'Morgan', 'mirror', 'scene', 'emotional', 'monologue', 'Eve', 'alone', 'should', ""'ve"", 'guaranteed', 'win', 'Eve', 'niece', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'alike', 'physically', 'personality', 'wise', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'daughter', 'scenes', 'interact', 'are', 'biggest', 'highlights', 'film.Sam', 'Jackson', 'amazing', 'smooth', 'operator', 'cheater', 'still', 'smooth', 'talker', 'loving', 'father', 'Instead', 'simply', 'playing', 'stereotype', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'done', 'wrong', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'impressive', 'bringing', 'such', 'depth', 'character', 'Roz', 'One', 'scene', 'first', 'time', 'met', 'husband', 'immediately', 'thought', 'healer', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'care', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'man', 'particularly', 'moving', 'really', 'feel', 'pain.It', 'shame', 'Meagan', 'Good', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'find', 'other', 'roles', 'Cisely', 'just', '14', '15', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'able', 'turn', 'performance', 'so', 'emotive', 'far', 'years', 'One', 'part', 'rebel', 'hurt', 'mother', 'same', 'time', 'be', 'just', 'state', 'such', 'pain', 'confusion', 'lost', 'Veteran', 'actress', 'Diahann', 'Caroll', 'bone', 'chilling', 'portrayal', 'Elzora', 'witchy', 'practitioner', 'dark', 'whom', 'Eve', 'help', 'seek', 'revenge.The', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'as', 'well', 'Erykah', 'Badu', 'jazzy', 'lament', 'Child', 'Blues', 'taking', 'cake', 'closing', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Southern', 'gothic', 'tale', 'twists', 'turns', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'breathless']",N/A

Kasi Lemmons' amazing directorial debut ""Eve's Bayou"" is a haunting and captivating tale of a upper middle-class black creole Louisiana family in the early 1960s who has a lot of baggage. In this family is a smart, 10 year old girl named Eve who has ""the gift of sight"". The bayou is the perfect setting for this story that deals with infidelity, family secrets, the mysteries of voodoo, magical curses and tragedy.This Southern family has issues, without a doubt: the father, who is the town doctor, continuously cheats on his wife; the mother -  beautiful and classy, protective of her children but distant, knows her husband is unfaithful but is in denial about it; Eve herself has witnessed her father being unfaithful to her mother and is forever haunted by the images that she has seen; the aunt, a widow several times over, who is also psychic like her niece, is hesitant to fall in love with a mysterious stranger that passes through because she is certain that he will meet the same fate as her former husbands; Eve's older sister who adores her father, but something happens that destroys her trust in him....and this is what triggers a cataclysmic chain of events.The cast is superb - with Samuel L. Jackson, Lynn Whitfield, Debbi Morgan (who is EXCELLENT - this is her best role yet) and Diahann Carroll in a less than glamourous role as the town voodoo priestess - but Jurnee Smollett as Eve is the one who really steals this film. Meagan Good, who plays Eve's older sibling, is also very good and effective in her role as Cisely.

The color and scenery is wonderful and the people are elegant and troubled. Even the character's names stir up visions of dark swamp water and sultry heat. The story is told and seen through the eyes of little Eve Batiste played by a wonderful young actress named Jurnee Smollett. Eve takes us deep into her world which is filled with colorful characters and complex personalities.Diahann Carroll is fabulous as the old fortune teller Elzora with her insane laughter. Debbi Morgan as Aunt Mozelle Batiste Delacroix is something to behold. Aunt Mozelle has promised her family that she will not use her &quot;second sight&quot; to tell fortunes, but neighbors won't let her keep her promise. They seek her out to find missing husbands anyway. Lynn Whitfied as the manor born wife is beautiful and poised as she tries to keep her family together in spite of her wandering husband (Samuel L. Jackson). Jackson is very sexy in this movie and his character has roving eyes as well as roving hands that don't stop even when he is caught in a compromising position by his youngest daughter, Eve. This starts a set of events that lead to the total destruction of an already deeply troubled family.Although this movie did not make history at the box office my guess is that it will become a cult classic.
