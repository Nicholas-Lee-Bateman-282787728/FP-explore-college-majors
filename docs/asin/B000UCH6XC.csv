Nowhere does it state what this DVD contains... just the opposite! It leads people to think it has video of the stars in their younger days. Shocking... The DVD cover doesn't give a hint. As soon as you put the DVD in the player and it boots to the menu, then you get it. Watch out for others if you are looking for original video of bands... not old farts.",1,Rip-Off!!!,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,466,"['British', 'Beat', 'LiveI', 'was', 'looking', 'original', '1960s', 'video', 'bands', 'when', 'found', 'listing', 'DVD', 'Nowhere', 'state', 'what', 'DVD', 'just', 'opposite', 'people', 'think', 'video', 'stars', 'younger', 'days', 'Shocking', 'DVD', 'cover', ""n't"", 'give', 'hint', 'As', 'soon', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'menu', 'then', 'get', 'Watch', 'out', 'others', 'are', 'looking', 'original', 'video', 'bands', 'not', 'old', 'farts']",N/A

1094684,A1LLN2OWXITIFE,B000UCH6XC,"F. Nava ""lover of music and film""","[14, 15]","This is a great modern day concert from many hitters of the British Invasion.  It's unfortunate that it has been given so many bad reviews--however they were given by people who expected old footage instead of a live concert from 2007.  But when you look at the concert itself, it is actually very good.The only problem with this release is that it has some horrible editing.  You can tell immediatley that many of the music is overdubbed while some scenes are placed in wrong areas.  For example, in  one shot you will get a close up of the drummer...however, the snare downbeat heard in the song is totally off from the footage (unless the drummer can produce a drum hit in midair!).  In another close up of the drummer, you HEAR him make a fill while the footage SHOWS him drumming straight downbeats.  Close ups of the piano player show him not in sync with the music.  Then, you will occasionally HEAR the vocals, but SEE the vocalist not singing.  On other occasions, you will see a single vocalist but hear numerous voices behind him.  It makes you wonder if many of the bands sounded bad live that they had to make numerous overdubs...or if the person that put the perfomance footage together was even listening to the songs to make them in sync.Other than these visual observations, it is actually a great concert.  If you are a fan of this area, I highly recommend this release.",4,Great Concert...Horrible Editing,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,1388,"['great', 'modern', 'day', 'concert', 'many', 'hitters', 'British', 'Invasion', 'unfortunate', 'been', 'given', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'however', 'were', 'given', 'people', 'who', 'expected', 'old', 'footage', 'instead', 'live', 'concert', '2007', 'when', 'look', 'concert', 'actually', 'very', 'good.The', 'only', 'problem', 'release', 'horrible', 'editing', 'can', 'tell', 'immediatley', 'many', 'music', 'overdubbed', 'scenes', 'are', 'placed', 'wrong', 'areas', 'example', 'one', 'shot', 'will', 'get', 'close', 'drummer', 'however', 'snare', 'downbeat', 'heard', 'song', 'totally', 'footage', 'drummer', 'can', 'produce', 'drum', 'hit', 'midair', 'close', 'drummer', 'HEAR', 'make', 'fill', 'footage', 'SHOWS', 'drumming', 'straight', 'downbeats', 'Close', 'ups', 'piano', 'player', 'show', 'not', 'sync', 'music', 'Then', 'will', 'occasionally', 'HEAR', 'vocals', 'SEE', 'vocalist', 'not', 'singing', 'other', 'occasions', 'will', 'see', 'single', 'vocalist', 'hear', 'numerous', 'voices', 'wonder', 'many', 'bands', 'sounded', 'bad', 'live', 'had', 'make', 'numerous', 'overdubs', 'person', 'put', 'perfomance', 'footage', 'together', 'was', 'even', 'listening', 'songs', 'make', 'sync.Other', 'visual', 'observations', 'actually', 'great', 'concert', 'are', 'fan', 'area', 'highly', 'recommend', 'release']",N/A

While the artists are certainly older, more portly, and not in peak voice, the music is surprisingly good, and the feelings, hearfelt. The absolute highlight of this show is Lulu, who,40 years after becoming a household name (To Sir With Love) looks and sounds more wonderful than she ever has.It would have been nice to present more than just one song from her. Nonetheless, her performance is riviting.
