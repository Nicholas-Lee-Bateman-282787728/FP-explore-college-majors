971377,A2QMLRALDX4U2B,B000EBGF2W,"Alexander Kemestrios Ben ""A.K.""","[3, 3]","Considering our current imbroglio in the Middle East and most people's astonishing ignorance of Islam, a corrective, educational lens is more important than ever.Into the void of documentary material steps this excellently made and well researched documentary on the life-and meaning-of the Prophet Muhammad. This documentary covers all of the key points of the Prophet's life: Muhammad's first revelations on Jabal an-Nur, his marrying of Khadija, protection from his Uncle Abu Talib, Khadija's and Abu Talib's deaths in 619, the Hijra in 622, Muhammad's wars with Mecca, the founding of a fledgling theocratic state in Medina (Yathrib), Muhammad's death in 631, questions of succession, and the meaning of Muhammad's life and the Qu'ran to modern Muslims.In this, the documentary is mostly accurate and up to date with modern scholarhsip. This alone makes the documentary a valuable and worthwhile piece of pedagogy. What is more, the documentary features beautiful cinematography, fluid narration, and touching moments.However, its revisionist, poliically correct nature, is somewhat meretricious. I realize these are perilous times for Muslims, and that public understanding and empathy for this great faith is at its nadir, but it does not help to whitewash history. Presenting a one-sided, holier than though version of Muhammad and Islam is not what we need. As with all religions, Islam has its core problems and flaws. I wish the film would have dealt with these honestly and openly.In my opinion, honest, critical dialogue is the best way to educate citizens. Such critical dialogue should be extended to all the great religious traditions.Alas, this documentary failed to answer some pressing concerns that plague the Islamic community. I understand how hard this task is in the present political climate. However, not doing so raises questions of its own.",4,a little over correction evident,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,1867,"['Considering', 'current', 'imbroglio', 'Middle', 'East', 'most', 'people', 'astonishing', 'ignorance', 'Islam', 'corrective', 'educational', 'lens', 'more', 'important', 'void', 'documentary', 'material', 'steps', 'excellently', 'made', 'well', 'researched', 'documentary', 'life-and', 'meaning-of', 'Prophet', 'Muhammad', 'documentary', 'key', 'points', 'Prophet', 'life', 'Muhammad', 'first', 'revelations', 'Jabal', 'an-Nur', 'marrying', 'Khadija', 'protection', 'Uncle', 'Abu', 'Talib', 'Khadija', 'Abu', 'Talib', 'deaths', '619', 'Hijra', '622', 'Muhammad', 'wars', 'Mecca', 'founding', 'fledgling', 'theocratic', 'state', 'Medina', 'Yathrib', 'Muhammad', 'death', '631', 'questions', 'succession', 'meaning', 'Muhammad', 'life', ""Qu'ran"", 'modern', 'Muslims.In', 'documentary', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'up', 'date', 'modern', 'scholarhsip', 'alone', 'documentary', 'valuable', 'worthwhile', 'piece', 'pedagogy', 'What', 'more', 'documentary', 'features', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'fluid', 'narration', 'touching', 'moments.However', 'revisionist', 'poliically', 'correct', 'nature', 'somewhat', 'meretricious', 'realize', 'are', 'perilous', 'times', 'Muslims', 'public', 'understanding', 'empathy', 'great', 'faith', 'nadir', 'not', 'help', 'whitewash', 'history', 'Presenting', 'one-sided', 'holier', 'version', 'Muhammad', 'Islam', 'not', 'what', 'need', 'religions', 'Islam', 'core', 'problems', 'flaws', 'wish', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'dealt', 'honestly', 'openly.In', 'opinion', 'honest', 'critical', 'dialogue', 'best', 'way', 'educate', 'citizens', 'Such', 'critical', 'dialogue', 'should', 'be', 'extended', 'great', 'religious', 'traditions.Alas', 'documentary', 'failed', 'answer', 'pressing', 'concerns', 'plague', 'Islamic', 'community', 'understand', 'how', 'hard', 'task', 'present', 'political', 'climate', 'However', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'raises', 'questions', 'own']",N/A

Interwoven with the story of Mohammad and the creation of Islam are the stories of modern-day Muslims living in America, a very effective if somewhat nonlinear narrative.  It's not just a history of Mohammad and Islam, nor is it a story about modern-day Muslims (both by birth and by choice), but a beautiful interweaving of the two.  The subtitle 'Legacy of a Prophet' really says it all, as these people live their lives in accordance with the teachings and examples of Mohammad, still looking to him as a role model and looking at his life for guidance over a thousand years after he walked the earth.  I wish more people with open minds would see things like this and come to realise that the majority of Muslims are kind sweet generous peace-loving people like the people in this video, such as Kevin the fireman, Ingrid the professor (she appears in the deleted scenes), and Najah the nurse.  As is pointed out in the scene at the Dearborn soup kitchen, the Catholic priest who came there to learn more about Muslims soon found out the truth about the religion and its practioners, and that the extremists in the news are a small minority, the same way that if an outsider to his own faith had asked him about extreme and newsworthy examples of so-called Catholics behaving badly, he'd rightly explain to the person that that's the exception and not the rule.  It was also surprising to learn that Dearborn, Michigan has a huge Muslim population; you don't usually think of a city in Middle America as having a large immigrant or Muslim population!  After seeing this documentary, now I have even more respect and love for Islam, even though it's not my own personal path to the Divine, and for the prophet Mohammad.The extras are also great.  There are a number of deleted scenes, interviews, and a virtual Hajj.  Also very moving and inspirational is that the people who made this documentary are Muslims, Jews, and Christians, all working together with mutual respect and tolerance for one another's faiths.  The Islamic artwork used for illustrations during the historical narratives was also very beautiful and inspiring, and as the non-Muslim film-makers soon found out, the story or the visuals didn't lose any of their zing or power just because the subject of the documentary is not allowed to be given a face or even drawn at all.  That convention of Islamic artwork just makes the viewer really pay attention to the story of Mohammad's life and the profound impact he still has on his millions of followers the world over today, instead of looking at a physical depiction of him and getting one set idea about who he was based on that.",5,A powerful and thoughtful documentary,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,2715,"['really', 'inspiring', 'moving', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'Interwoven', 'story', 'Mohammad', 'creation', 'Islam', 'are', 'stories', 'modern-day', 'Muslims', 'living', 'America', 'very', 'effective', 'somewhat', 'nonlinear', 'narrative', 'not', 'just', 'history', 'Mohammad', 'Islam', 'story', 'modern-day', 'Muslims', 'birth', 'choice', 'beautiful', 'interweaving', 'two', 'subtitle', ""'Legacy"", 'Prophet', 'really', 'people', 'live', 'lives', 'accordance', 'teachings', 'examples', 'Mohammad', 'still', 'looking', 'role', 'model', 'looking', 'life', 'guidance', 'thousand', 'years', 'walked', 'earth', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'open', 'minds', 'would', 'see', 'things', 'come', 'realise', 'majority', 'Muslims', 'are', 'kind', 'sweet', 'generous', 'peace-loving', 'people', 'people', 'video', 'such', 'Kevin', 'fireman', 'Ingrid', 'professor', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Najah', 'nurse', 'pointed', 'out', 'scene', 'Dearborn', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'who', 'came', 'there', 'learn', 'more', 'Muslims', 'soon', 'found', 'truth', 'religion', 'practioners', 'extremists', 'news', 'are', 'small', 'minority', 'same', 'way', 'outsider', 'own', 'faith', 'had', 'asked', 'extreme', 'newsworthy', 'examples', 'so-called', 'Catholics', 'behaving', 'badly', ""'d"", 'rightly', 'explain', 'person', 'exception', 'not', 'rule', 'was', 'also', 'surprising', 'learn', 'Dearborn', 'Michigan', 'huge', 'Muslim', 'population', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'think', 'city', 'Middle', 'America', 'having', 'large', 'immigrant', 'Muslim', 'population', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'now', 'have', 'even', 'more', 'respect', 'love', 'Islam', 'even', 'not', 'own', 'personal', 'path', 'Divine', 'prophet', 'Mohammad.The', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'are', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'virtual', 'Hajj', 'Also', 'very', 'moving', 'inspirational', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'documentary', 'are', 'Muslims', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'working', 'together', 'mutual', 'respect', 'tolerance', 'one', 'faiths', 'Islamic', 'artwork', 'used', 'illustrations', 'historical', 'narratives', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'non-Muslim', 'film-makers', 'soon', 'found', 'out', 'story', 'visuals', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'zing', 'power', 'just', 'subject', 'documentary', 'not', 'allowed', 'be', 'given', 'face', 'even', 'drawn', 'convention', 'Islamic', 'artwork', 'just', 'viewer', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'story', 'Mohammad', 'life', 'profound', 'impact', 'still', 'millions', 'followers', 'world', 'today', 'instead', 'looking', 'physical', 'depiction', 'getting', 'one', 'set', 'idea', 'who', 'was', 'based']",N/A

It illustrates many of the struggles that some Muslims still face. The strength that many of them have to have in order to live in today's modern times.This documentary goes through the life of the prophet of Muhammad. It begins with Muhammad's birth in 570 A.D. You learn about Muhammad's childhood and how he was raised as an orphan throughout his life. The documentary does a great job explaining the tribes in Arabia as well. You learn about Muhammad's life and how he meets his wife Khadijah, whom later on becomes a great influential encouragement to the success of Muhammad. Muhammad's revelations are told among his early ministry and how they were influenced by several individuals. The hardships and persecution the early followers endured to bring about the religion of the Muslims. It also portrays a lot of information on the battles between Medina and Mecca. It tells the story of Muhammad with profiles of various American Muslims: a firefighter who was converted to Islam; an Islamic calligrapher; a woman who moved to the U.S. from India at age fifteen; the chief of staff for a New York congressman; a nurse in Michigana and a convert making the pilgrimage to Mecca.Some of the key points of the Prophet's life that was shown in the documentary were Muhammad's first revelations on Jabal an-Nur, marrying of his wife Khadija, protection through his Uncle Abu Talib, Khadija's and Abu Talib's deaths in 619, the Hijra in 622, and Muhammad's wars between Mecca and Medina.

971382,A27MIRZEVUJ5MW,B000EBGF2W,House Of Pawz Chilton,"[0, 0]","In my point of view Muhammad and Islam were misunderstood since the birth of the religion. Muhammad was born in the holy land of Mecca which is in Saudi Arabia. He's was born to a father who died before he was born, and a mother who died when he was very young. He was raised by his Uncle who was well known in the community this opened opportunities for people to know him. The area in which he lived was good for trade so merchants did well but also as more people prospered they forgot about the less fortunate. It seems being raised by his uncle he had a hard time at an early age because he was an orphan. When Muhammad was in his early twenties he developed a good reputation working as merchant trade agent, this is where he meets his first wife Khadijah. She was so overwhelmed by his success when assisting her with trades. Although she was forty and he was twenty-five she eventually proposed to him. This definite seemed out of character for a female in this timeframe but maybe it was different because of her wealth. She became his number one supporter with anything he attempted. He would meditate in the mountains nearby very often this were he had his vision of the angel. Obviously anybody would be terrified if an angel approached them and gained control over their body and demanded cooperation. The angel continued demanding him to ""Recite the name of thy lord created"" I am sure he was awe stricken at first but he finally repeated what the angel wanted. The first person he ran to with his built up fear was his wife and confidant Khadijah. Most people would not believe a person if they told them this story but like I said before she was his biggest supporter and believed in him. She went with him to see religious leader who confirmed that Muhammad in deed was the prophet. He struggled at first when he began to preach what the angel told him to but eventually succeed.I would suggest to watch this movie because it is very informative and could change a person mind about a few things.",4,The Misconception of Muhammad,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,2013,"['point', 'view', 'Muhammad', 'Islam', 'were', 'misunderstood', 'birth', 'religion', 'Muhammad', 'was', 'born', 'holy', 'land', 'Mecca', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'was', 'born', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'was', 'born', 'mother', 'who', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'was', 'raised', 'Uncle', 'who', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'community', 'opened', 'opportunities', 'people', 'know', 'area', 'lived', 'was', 'good', 'trade', 'merchants', 'did', 'well', 'also', 'more', 'people', 'prospered', 'forgot', 'less', 'fortunate', 'being', 'raised', 'uncle', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'early', 'age', 'was', 'orphan', 'When', 'Muhammad', 'was', 'early', 'twenties', 'developed', 'good', 'reputation', 'working', 'merchant', 'trade', 'agent', 'where', 'first', 'wife', 'Khadijah', 'was', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'success', 'when', 'assisting', 'trades', 'was', 'forty', 'was', 'twenty-five', 'eventually', 'proposed', 'definite', 'seemed', 'character', 'female', 'timeframe', 'maybe', 'was', 'different', 'wealth', 'became', 'number', 'one', 'supporter', 'anything', 'attempted', 'would', 'meditate', 'mountains', 'nearby', 'very', 'often', 'were', 'had', 'vision', 'angel', 'Obviously', 'anybody', 'would', 'be', 'terrified', 'angel', 'approached', 'gained', 'control', 'body', 'demanded', 'cooperation', 'angel', 'continued', 'demanding', 'Recite', 'name', 'thy', 'lord', 'created', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'awe', 'stricken', 'first', 'finally', 'repeated', 'what', 'angel', 'wanted', 'first', 'person', 'ran', 'built', 'up', 'fear', 'was', 'wife', 'confidant', 'Khadijah', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'believe', 'person', 'told', 'story', 'said', 'was', 'biggest', 'supporter', 'believed', 'went', 'see', 'religious', 'leader', 'who', 'confirmed', 'Muhammad', 'deed', 'was', 'prophet', 'struggled', 'first', 'when', 'began', 'preach', 'what', 'angel', 'told', 'eventually', 'succeed.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'watch', 'movie', 'very', 'informative', 'could', 'change', 'person', 'mind', 'few', 'things']",N/A

It is well-rounded and descriptive of his lifestyle; his birth, trade, faith, marriage, and teachings. They give great examples of his personality as they state dialogues about his appearance, and Khadija's admiration of him. They also state why he began meditating, which was unknown to me before; due the problems and egocentrism the Meccans had. They speak of his first revelation as he states ""Recite in the name of thy Lord."" I like this part because it shows how human he is, as he ran scared from his experience out of the cave he recited in. For the next few years he becomes more involved in Meccan politics, becoming despised by many of the religious officials in the time The death of Khadijah and his uncle made his position very vulnerable to the people of Mecca. He traveled to Medina where he has many revelations about Islamic policy/law. He fought the wars with the Meccans, and settled a truce, and conquered Meccan and stripped the Ka'bah of idols. In his last years he traveled back and forth between Mecca and Medina. He died in Medina.This movie is symbolic of Islam because it speaks of the life of a prophet who changed the world. Muhammad evolved himself into accepting his prophet-hood and in that made people understand the true word of God. Islam is a religion that is based on the revelations sent to Muhammad by God. Many Hadith in Islam are derived from the way Muhammad lived his life, therefore, it is only necessary to learn about his life story. This is an excellent documentary for those wanting to learn more about the founder and initial spreader of Islamic ideologies of peace, heaven and hell, and one God, concepts that are symbolic to Judaism and Christianity.

971384,A1Q9DNHFEEZ47T,B000EBGF2W,Joel S. Peters,"[21, 44]","This documentary at best is a one-sided portrayal of Muhammad and at worst is a deliberate attempt to white-wash and/or ignore some details of his life.  Being a pro-Islam production, the viewer would naturally expect to see Muhammad presented favorably; but what the viewer does *not* get is a complete or balanced presentation, one that does not shy away from dealing with the sordid elements of Muhammad's life.The documentary does well where you would expect it to:  giving the viewer a good introduction to Muhammad, the major events in his life, his founding of Islam, the impact of Islam on the lives of its followers, etc.  But it portrays only the innocuous side of Muhammad, and this is where the production fails.  It not only completely glosses over some rather unflattering and undeniable details about Muhammad, it also casts certain events in such a way that calling them instances of historical revisionism would not be inappropriate.  Consider the following illustrative (but not exhaustive) list of examples:(1) With a mere nod to the non-Muslim view of history, the documentary makes a passing mention that certain events could be viewed from two different perspectives.  For example, the incident involving Muhammad and the Bani Qurayza (the Jewish tribe in Medina that was massacred by Muhammad and his followers) is brought up, and the viewer is led to believe that these Jews betrayed a treaty they signed with Muhammad and thus essentially deserved their fate.  Another view of history (which is never brought up), however, maintains that Muhammad was to blame for the atrocity committed against these Jews.  Either way, the documentary fails to mention that the Qurayza men and teenage boys were decapitated *in front of the Qurayza women and children*--an act that can only be labeled as cruel and insidious.  (Did it mention that the women and children were sold into slavery?)  All of this was done with Muhammad's approval.  Furthermore, despite the assertion by Karen Armstrong (an author who is featured repeatedly) that Muhammad ""had nothing against the Jewish people per se or the Jewish religion,"" the film doesn't mention that Muhammad systematically rid Medina of its Jewish population--either by banishing them or killing them. Consider Muhammad's own words about Jews:  ""Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:  I heard Allah's Apostle saying, `The Jews will fight with you, and you will be given victory over them so that a stone will say, ""O Muslim!  There is a Jew behind me; kill him!""'"" (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56, Number 791)(2) The documentary fails to mention that Muhammad personally ordered or sanctioned the assassination of at least 27 people, including four poets whose only crime was to mock Muhammad in verses and/or stories.  Two of these poets met particularly cruel deaths:  (a) Abu Afak, simply by the nature of him being 100 years old (and therefore posing no real threat to Muhammad), and (b) Asma bint Marwan, who was murdered while she was nursing her youngest child!(3) Armstrong asserts that the Qur'an ""continues to tell Muslims to honor the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] and to honor their religion as authentic.""  This statement is indefensible in light of the fact that Muhammad said things like, ""I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any but Muslim."" (Sahih Muslim, Book 19, Number 4366) and ""The Jews call 'Uzair [Ezra] a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah.  That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say.  Allah's curse be on them:  how they are deluded away from the Truth!"" (Qur'an 9:30, Yusuf Ali's version)(4) Portions of the documentary dealing with Muhammad's wives are conspicuously selective in what information is offered.  For example, it is noted that after Khadijah's death, Muhammad married ""a number of women.""  This film does not offer an actual number for a good reason--it would be embarrassing.  The fact is, Muhammad had a total of twenty wives--in violation of his own rule that a Muslim man may have up to four wives.  Another glaring omission is made with regard to his ""favorite"" wife Aisha, who was a mere six years old when he married her.  The viewer is also never told that Muhammad, in his 50's at the time, had sex with her just three years later, when she was NINE YEARS OLD!  ""Narrated 'Aisha:  that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death)."" (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64)(5) Finally, the concept of jihad is covered (again) in a very selective and antiseptic way.  The viewer is told by various people in the documentary things like jihad ""does not mean holy war primarily,"" ""fighting is by no means the major imperative [of jihad],"" and ""Jihad is misused.  There is absolutely nothing in Islam that justifies the claim of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, or other similar groups to kill innocent civilians.""  While ""jihad"" *can* refer to an inner striving or struggling to overcome obstacles to submitting to Allah, the original application of the word was indeed about violence directed at ""infidels"" (effectively, anyone unwilling to become a Muslim).  A cursory examination of Muslim history will utterly bear this out.  More importantly, though, the film neglects to mention that the Qur'an contains numerous examples of violence commanded against ""unbelievers"" (see 2:190-191, 4:89, 5:33, 8:12, 8:67, and 9:5, to name a few), and to suggest that ""jihad"" is primarily about individual sanctity is simply being nave.  Moreover, in dealing with jihad the documentary tugs at our heart strings about the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in a particularly manipulative way--especially when a NYC firefighter convert to Islam notes in the film that these people were ""fanatics"" who were ""acting on their own.""  Such a disavowal rings hollow in light of the fact that killing ""infidels"" is clearly sanctioned in the Qur'an.Bottom line?  If you're looking for a ""nice"" portrayal of Muhammad and Islam--one that displays only the flattering elements--then you will not be disappointed with this film.  On the other hand, if you want an honest look at Muhammad--warts and all, candid and revealing, balanced and fair--then this documentary will simply not deliver.",2,Not an honest or balanced portrayal

Muslims know that the greatest example of leadership is Prophet Muhammad so I turned to him for inspiration. I searched at amazon and came across this DVD. I won't spoil it for you by telling you too much, but I can categorize my opinion as per two target audiences:FOR NON-MUSLIMS: You will find this production very informative and non-biased-as the main producers and creators of this production are three Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Americans (strange, but true). The guests who are interviewed also come from different faiths; so this production is not about a group of Muslims going on and on about how wonderful the prophet was. You will learn about how this religion got started, how did Muhammad become the prophet of Islam, and how did he lead Muslims around him and throughout centuries. The production mixes between past life of the prophet and how Muslims behave today. The universality of the production and interviews are very well presented.FOR MUSLIMS: If you live or lived in a Muslim country and learned about Islam and the prophet since childhood, most likely, you won't find much to learn about the prophet that you didn't already know. However, the examples of Muslim Americans and what they're doing in their daily lives to live the Muslim way of life are truly inspiring and worth seeing. If it's for nothing else, it makes you proud of seeing some good Muslims who are just ordinary people.The quality of the production is good. There is a good mix between interviews and footage of universal sceneries. The producers had a major challenge for not being allowed to show any illustrations or create any reenactments portraying Prophet Muhammad, who's the lead character, since that's not welcomed by Islam. Nevertheless, this production tells an engaging story that took place more than 1400 years ago of a man who within a period of only 23 years managed to change history.",5,Different faiths unite in this project!,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,2002,"['How', 'do', 'define', 'level', 'success', 'leadership', 'question', 'been', 'mind', 'sometime', 'Muslims', 'know', 'greatest', 'example', 'leadership', 'Prophet', 'Muhammad', 'turned', 'inspiration', 'searched', 'amazon', 'came', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'categorize', 'opinion', 'two', 'target', 'audiences', 'NON-MUSLIMS', 'will', 'find', 'production', 'very', 'informative', 'non-biased-as', 'main', 'producers', 'creators', 'production', 'are', 'three', 'Muslim', 'Christian', 'Jewish', 'Americans', 'strange', 'true', 'guests', 'who', 'are', 'interviewed', 'also', 'come', 'different', 'faiths', 'so', 'production', 'not', 'group', 'Muslims', 'going', 'how', 'wonderful', 'prophet', 'was', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'religion', 'got', 'started', 'how', 'did', 'Muhammad', 'become', 'prophet', 'Islam', 'how', 'did', 'lead', 'Muslims', 'centuries', 'production', 'mixes', 'past', 'life', 'prophet', 'how', 'Muslims', 'behave', 'today', 'universality', 'production', 'interviews', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'presented.FOR', 'MUSLIMS', 'live', 'lived', 'Muslim', 'country', 'learned', 'Islam', 'prophet', 'childhood', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'learn', 'prophet', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'However', 'examples', 'Muslim', 'Americans', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'daily', 'lives', 'live', 'Muslim', 'way', 'life', 'are', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'worth', 'seeing', 'nothing', 'else', 'proud', 'seeing', 'good', 'Muslims', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'ordinary', 'people.The', 'quality', 'production', 'good', 'good', 'mix', 'interviews', 'footage', 'universal', 'sceneries', 'producers', 'had', 'major', 'challenge', 'not', 'being', 'allowed', 'show', 'illustrations', 'create', 'reenactments', 'portraying', 'Prophet', 'Muhammad', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'not', 'welcomed', 'Islam', 'Nevertheless', 'production', 'engaging', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'more', '1400', 'years', 'ago', 'man', 'who', 'period', 'only', '23', 'years', 'managed', 'change', 'history']",N/A

People lived there lives based upon the teachings of Muhammad and looked to Muhammad for advise and spiritual healing. The movie began back in 570 A.D. with the birth of Muhammad. You learn how Muhammad was brought up and his childhood being an orphan. This movie highlighted the lifestyle of Muslim people and showed in detail that Muslim people are caring, peaceful, and compassionate individuals. This Movie also displays different tribes during this time in history. We also learn about Muhammad's ministry and how his followers went through many hardships. There were battles in the movie between the countries of Mecca and Medina. This movie not only shows the lives of the prophet but also what all Muslim's go through on a normal day basis. With the September 11 attacks, I don't think Muslims are bad people, I think that people make choices and when something bad happens were quick to state it was based upon religion as well as label that religion for someone else's mistake. However, there was a scene in the movie where in America New York City, a firefighter rescues after the September 11 attacks and I think that the stories they used in America made the film more watchable. Muhammad was a prophet who wanted to help all and wanted people to treat each other with respect. We learned about Muhammad's life and his teachings as well as the Muslim's culture in America. We witness the mosques, homes, and workplaces of all Muslim's. Muhammad spread the word of Islam and was seen as a historical figure. There were parts in the movie where the Qur'an was recited as well as put into music during the movie.This movie relates to the World Religions by the spread of Islam. Islam still remains in this world with the Muslim Culture. However, Islam is now seen differently due to events such as September 11 attacks on America. I think that Islamic people are not harmful to Americans and that they have been put to a test that I think is unfair. However, with the world of religions there are over billions of people who are of Islamic faith and they will continue to grow throughout history.

Muhammad was born in 570 CE in a small town called Mecca, and was for the most part put to work as a child as Sheppard after his parents died and he went to live with his uncle. He was noticed later with regard to his prophet status, and later married a woman by the name of Khadijah. She was older, in her 40s and he was 25. She was a strong supporter of his life and accomplishments, and comforted him in many times of need. He was a very kind person, which was noticed by many, and he wanted to help others. The documentary goes onto explain that it's believed an angel came to visit him, and led him to quit his current job, and pursue spiritual leadership. Over time, he had many followers as he began to lead others in what is now called the Islamic faith. His teachings and beliefs are noted in a book called the Quran and is used as the ""Islamic Bible"" today. Today, Muslims are counted at around 600 million followers. The documentary noted that he was able to allow for women to obtain rights to their own lives and choices, which was not the case when he was born. Overall, he was able to bring upon many people hope and faith that they could believe in, much like Jesus for Christians.",4,Very educational,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1489,"['documentary', 'most', 'part', 'documents', 'life', 'Muhammad', 'talks', 'accomplishments', 'life', 'really', 'essence', 'how', 'created', 'what', 'know', 'Islamic', 'faith', 'how', 'touched', 'many', 'lives', 'changed', 'way', 'nearly', '2', 'billion', 'people', 'worship', 'Muhammad', 'was', 'born', '570', 'CE', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Mecca', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'put', 'work', 'child', 'Sheppard', 'parents', 'died', 'went', 'live', 'uncle', 'was', 'noticed', 'later', 'regard', 'prophet', 'status', 'later', 'married', 'woman', 'name', 'Khadijah', 'was', 'older', '40s', 'was', '25', 'was', 'strong', 'supporter', 'life', 'accomplishments', 'comforted', 'many', 'times', 'need', 'was', 'very', 'kind', 'person', 'was', 'noticed', 'many', 'wanted', 'help', 'others', 'documentary', 'explain', 'believed', 'angel', 'came', 'visit', 'led', 'quit', 'current', 'job', 'pursue', 'spiritual', 'leadership', 'time', 'had', 'many', 'followers', 'began', 'lead', 'others', 'what', 'now', 'called', 'Islamic', 'faith', 'teachings', 'beliefs', 'are', 'noted', 'book', 'called', 'Quran', 'used', 'Islamic', 'Bible', 'today', 'Today', 'Muslims', 'are', 'counted', '600', 'million', 'followers', 'documentary', 'noted', 'was', 'able', 'allow', 'women', 'obtain', 'rights', 'own', 'lives', 'choices', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'when', 'was', 'born', 'Overall', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'upon', 'many', 'people', 'hope', 'faith', 'could', 'believe', 'much', 'Jesus', 'Christians']",N/A
971391,A3LY48PLYZQEBB,B000EBGF2W,Terrie L. Yow,"[1, 2]","Movie Review - Muhammad: Legacy of a ProphetThe documentary, ""Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet"" is an outstanding recount of the life and legend of the ""last prophet"" and founder of Islam.Muhammad's life begins with what some would term as a disadvantaged beginning. His father dies before he is born, his mother dies when he is only six years old, and as an orphan, is forced to live with his uncle throughout the remainder of his childhood. His only good fortune at the time seems to be having the good luck of being born into one of the most powerful tribes in Arabia.As a young adult, Muhammad works the trade route and encounters many members of neighboring tribes. Although he is not aware at the time, this occupation will pave the way for a greater destiny; one that will leave him astonished, bewildered, persecuted, blessed, and above all, one he cannot escape.While delivering a caravan of goods, Muhammad meets a wealthy widow named Khadijah. She takes note of Muhammad's kindness and develops a deep affection for him. Fifteen years his senior, Khadijah, 40, asks Muhammad, 25, to marry her. He agrees, despite being teased and accused of marrying for her money. In Khadijah, he finds his biggest supporter. Neither of them are aware of the long journey ahead or just how much he will need that support later on.As Muhammad was meditating alone on the mountain, an angel named Gabriel appeared and told him to ""Recite."" Muhammad resisted, but Gabriel persisted and eventually forced him to speak. What came out were the beginnings of the Qur'an. Terrified and shaken, Muhammad ran home to Khadijah, where she gave him comfort and convinced him to visit her cousin, who was a Christian and knowledgeable with regard to various religions. Her cousin identified Muhammad as having the marking of a prophet.The documentary covers Muhammad through his many roles. He was a husband, a father, a general, a statesman, and a man of God (Allah). His life was one of persecution and great honor, for his destiny would become legacy and the foundation of Islam. For those wanting a better understanding of Islam, this documentary is superb and highly recommended.",5,Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,2162,"['Movie', 'Review', 'Muhammad', 'Legacy', 'ProphetThe', 'documentary', 'Muhammad', 'Legacy', 'Prophet', 'outstanding', 'recount', 'life', 'legend', 'last', 'prophet', 'founder', 'Islam.Muhammad', 'life', 'what', 'would', 'term', 'disadvantaged', 'beginning', 'father', 'born', 'mother', 'when', 'only', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'orphan', 'forced', 'live', 'uncle', 'remainder', 'childhood', 'only', 'good', 'fortune', 'time', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'luck', 'being', 'born', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'tribes', 'Arabia.As', 'young', 'adult', 'Muhammad', 'trade', 'route', 'encounters', 'many', 'members', 'neighboring', 'tribes', 'not', 'aware', 'time', 'occupation', 'will', 'pave', 'way', 'greater', 'destiny', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'astonished', 'bewildered', 'persecuted', 'blessed', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'escape.While', 'delivering', 'caravan', 'goods', 'Muhammad', 'wealthy', 'widow', 'named', 'Khadijah', 'note', 'Muhammad', 'kindness', 'deep', 'affection', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'senior', 'Khadijah', '40', 'Muhammad', '25', 'marry', 'being', 'teased', 'accused', 'marrying', 'money', 'Khadijah', 'biggest', 'supporter', 'are', 'aware', 'long', 'journey', 'ahead', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'will', 'need', 'support', 'later', 'on.As', 'Muhammad', 'was', 'meditating', 'alone', 'mountain', 'angel', 'named', 'Gabriel', 'appeared', 'told', 'Recite', 'Muhammad', 'resisted', 'Gabriel', 'persisted', 'eventually', 'forced', 'speak', 'What', 'came', 'out', 'were', 'beginnings', ""Qur'an"", 'Terrified', 'shaken', 'Muhammad', 'ran', 'home', 'Khadijah', 'where', 'gave', 'comfort', 'convinced', 'visit', 'cousin', 'who', 'was', 'Christian', 'knowledgeable', 'regard', 'various', 'religions', 'cousin', 'identified', 'Muhammad', 'having', 'marking', 'prophet.The', 'documentary', 'covers', 'Muhammad', 'many', 'roles', 'was', 'husband', 'father', 'general', 'statesman', 'man', 'God', 'Allah', 'life', 'was', 'one', 'persecution', 'great', 'honor', 'destiny', 'would', 'become', 'legacy', 'foundation', 'Islam', 'wanting', 'better', 'understanding', 'Islam', 'documentary', 'superb', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
