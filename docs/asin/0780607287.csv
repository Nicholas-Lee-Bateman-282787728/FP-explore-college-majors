Obviuosly most of theater flockers would be the millions of saturday morning kiddies who love  the cartoon, but the producers didn't want to forget those whose support of  the original grittier version of TMNT (in the b&w comix) that spawned  the toys and the cartoon in the 1st place. So they decided to mesh the two.  (Aside from new characters created exclusively for the film) only  characters from the original comix were used: the TMNT, Shredder, April,  Casey, Splinter. No Krang, Technodrome, Dimension X, Rocksteady & Bebop  or footbots. (However April is still a reporter though.) But it was done in  the style of the cartoon; lots of joking around, lots of pizza munching and  even multi-colored bandanas and pupils were given to the turtles. But none of  it is done to the point where a fan of the comix couldn't stand it,  actually most of it is quite funny. The plot was even based upon the  original comix following TMNT vol. 1 #1, Raphael #1 (loosely), Leonardo #1  (very loosely), TMNT #10, 11 and 19-21 (Return to New York). Of course some  editing is done to adapt all of these comix into a 100m film and I must say it's done quite well, still us true TMNT fans await a cartoon or film adaptation based ONLY upon the original comix, but hey this is good too.  Also, Jim Henson's Turtle costumes were wonderful.",4,The TMNT As They Were Meant To Be. . .

Raphael was awesome as the outcast who went against everyone else. Michaelangelo and Donatello provided the comic relief and Leonardo was the pretentious leader.

27593,A2W75RZ6WA9DCN,0780607287,"Banon ""IronMan004""","[0, 0]","The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created as an underground comic series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984. The series was about four anthropomorphic mutated turtles that learned the art of ninjutsu from a giant rat named Splinter. He named them all after four famous renaissance painters: Leonardo, Rafael, Donatello and Michelangelo. They live in the sewers fighting super villains and eating pizza while spouting out &#8216;80s and early &#8216;90s &#8220;surfer dude&#8221; clich&eacute;s...the very act of explaining these characters brings to mind their sheer absurdity. The concept alone is as random as a child&#8217;s mad lib. Somehow, the idea proved to be extremely marketable and sparked a pop cultural phenomenon during the &#8216;80s. As a kid I watched the cartoon, played with the toys, played the videogames, and even had my own personal Ninja Turtles tent. It was inevitable that there would be a movie made about the iconic characters. The real question is: how do you take an idea as strange as this and translate it into live action?The story is about a new wave of mysterious crimes sweeping through New York City by an organization known as the Foot Clan. Reporter April O&#8217;Neil (Judith Hoag) covers the story and soon finds herself being attacked. She's rescued by the Ninja Turtles and they become the targets of the Foot Clan and their Leader, the Shredder (James Saito). The first thing to examine is the presentation of the Turtles themselves. They&#8217;re brought to life with a combination of detailed costumes and puppetry, both of which are surprisingly convincing. Jim Henson&#8217;s Creature Shop is responsible for the development of the puppets and they look great; without any reliance on computer animation, this is as good as they could ever look in a live action film. A lot of credit must also be given to the puppeteers and choreographers, because the Turtles can also move really well, pulling off some impressive fight sequences. It&#8217;s clear that martial artists are inside these costumes and their ability to fight while wearing them is commendable.The characters of the Turtles are all fairly likeable as well; Rafael (Josh Pais) being the most prominently featured due to his personal struggle with his anger. Donatello (voiced by Corey Feldmen) and Michelangelo (Robbie Rist) are the comic relief, with Leonardo (Brian Tochi) serving mostly as the counterpoint to Rafael. Although Rafael&#8217;s anger is a conflict for at least the first half of the movie, towards the end it&#8217;s dropped altogether. It&#8217;s a shame because, of all the subplots, Rafael&#8217;s isolation is the most interesting. There are also some other characters like their wise master Splinter (Kevin Clash) who is, as mentioned before, a giant rat, the reporter April, and another vigilante named Casey Jones (Elias Koteas). They&#8217;re all relatively likable and add to the fun of the story, Casey Jones in particular. Elias Koteas plays him as a dumb, but well intentioned ex-hockey player who uses his excess strength to beat up criminals with a variety of sports equipment (ranging from hockey sticks to cricket bats).The plot isn&#8217;t terribly complex (though I think less is more with characters like these), and most of what happens to the main characters is only due to the actions of others around them, as opposed to anything they accomplish personally. What's really one of the biggest drawbacks to the film, and these characters in general, is how instantly dated they are. They&#8217;re very much a product of their times, as none of their catchphrases are even remotely used today. Many of the one-liners fall flat and expressions like &#8220;Radical&#8221; and &#8220;Cowabunga&#8221;, which were barely popular even then, are now nearly forgotten. Where the film truly succeeds however, is in its tone. It manages to bring these characters to life in a real world (meaning characters like Bebop and Rocksteady do not exist here), maintaining a delicate balance between taking itself too seriously and becoming a parody of itself altogether.One example might be the origin story sequences in which Splinter reveals to April how they all came to be. It&#8217;s a silly story, but told from the authoritative voice of a wise old master. A sillier element might be how the turtles can apparently walk the streets of New York without being recognized as long as they wear a fedora hat and trench coat, but it also helps that the villain, the Shredder (who bares a few similarities to Darth Vader, at one point even telling his underlings &#8220;I am your father&#8221;), treats the Turtles as a real threat, regardless of the way they look and act. There's a lot of humor, and much of it is accompanied by the cheesy soundtrack, but there are also some scenes that make the characters feel more realized and developed. The scene in which the four Turtles meditate and communicate with Splinter for instance, feels quite genuine. It&#8217;s also surprising how violent this film is. That&#8217;s not to say that there&#8217;s a whole lot of bloodshed, but there's a good deal of martial arts action to be found here. There are only a few instances of more cartoony action, and I think it&#8217;s possible that more inspiration was drawn from the grittier comics than the child-oriented cartoon series.Overall, this is the best theatrical version of these characters that there's ever going to be. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a fun comic book film that's also a time capsule for its day.",4,Still a classic,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,5555,"['Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'were',

Peterson ""I'm not blind drunk, I'm j...","[0, 0]","I'll admit that I was at first only a reluctant fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoons back in the late 80's and early 90's, if for no other reason than I was pretty much forced to watch it by the simple fact that my brother and sister both watched it while they babysat me. But as time got on I did grow to genuinely enjoy the series. I mean, who can watch the show and not laugh at the bumbling antics of Shredder and his goons as they try to gain the advantage against the turtles? So when I heard that a TMNT movie was in the works (it came out as I recall in the summer of my tenth year back in 1990), I was at least willing to give it a whirl.It should be noted that in quite a few important ways the movie is as unlike to the cartoon as night from day. The actors aren't even the same, for one thing. Not that this detracted from my enjoyment of the film or its two sequels, it didn't. But certain elements of the characters' past, Splinter and Shredder's in particular, were altered, more I think to be more true to the comics than anything. Splinter goes from being the mutated form of a Ninja warrior named Hamato Yoshi to being the pet of said Ninja. Raphael, who in the cartoon was always the wsecracker of the group, becomes a much more solitary, angry character often given to acts of rashness that nearly cost him his life. This behavior almost creates a rift in the turtles at one point, but they reunite in an effort to save their beloved master from Shredder. There's another character much changed from his cartoon persona. Gone is the often petulant, whiny villain, to be replaced by a sinister and ruthless criminal mastermind with an ominous voice. In short he changes from someone to be laughed at to a man to avoid at any cost.All in all I was very impressed with the movies. I only wish I still had my VHS copies, but then again I so rarely watch those anymore that it seemed more advisable to get them on DVD, which I intend to do next month if finances permit. So if you haven't already seen them, pop on over to your local video rental and pick up the three TMNT films. I personally liked the first one best, but Secret of the Ooz was close behind. The third one took a bit of getting used to but I eventually did conclude that I liked it just as much as the others.",5,I liked it when it was on VHS and i'm buying the DVD three-pack as soon as I can.,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,2304,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'reluctant', 'fan', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'cartoons', 'back', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'other', 'reason', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'forced', 'watch', 'simple', 'fact', 'brother', 'sister', 'watched', 'babysat', 'time', 'got', 'did', 'grow', 'genuinely', 'enjoy', 'series', 'mean', 'who', 'can', 'watch', 'show', 'not', 'laugh', 'bumbling', 'antics', 'Shredder', 'goons', 'try', 'gain', 'advantage', 'turtles', 'So', 'when', 'heard', 'TMNT', 'movie', 'was', 'works', 'came', 'out', 'recall', 'summer', 'tenth', 'year', 'back', '1990', 'was', 'least', 'willing', 'give', 'whirl.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'quite', 'few', 'important', 'ways', 'movie', 'as', 'cartoon', 'night', 'day', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'same', 'one', 'thing', 'Not', 'detracted', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'two', 'sequels', 'did', ""n't"", 'certain', 'elements', 'characters', 'past', 'Splinter', 'Shredder', 'particular', 'were', 'altered', 'more', 'think', 'be', 'more', 'true', 'comics', 'anything', 'Splinter', 'being', 'mutated', 'form', 'Ninja', 'warrior', 'named', 'Hamato', 'Yoshi', 'being', 'pet', 'said', 'Ninja', 'Raphael', 'who', 'cartoon', 'was', 'always', 'wsecracker', 'group', 'much', 'more', 'solitary', 'angry', 'character', 'often', 'given', 'acts', 'rashness', 'nearly', 'cost', 'life', 'behavior', 'almost', 'rift', 'turtles', 'one', 'point', 'reunite', 'effort', 'save', 'beloved', 'master', 'Shredder', 'character', 'much', 'changed', 'cartoon', 'persona', 'Gone', 'often', 'petulant', 'whiny', 'villain', 'be', 'replaced', 'sinister', 'ruthless', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'ominous', 'voice', 'short', 'someone', 'be', 'laughed', 'man', 'avoid', 'cost.All', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'movies', 'only', 'wish', 'still', 'had', 'VHS', 'copies', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'rarely', 'watch', 'seemed', 'more', 'advisable', 'get', 'DVD', 'intend', 'do', 'next', 'month', 'finances', 'permit', 'So', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'pop', 'local', 'video', 'rental', 'pick', 'up', 'three', 'TMNT', 'films', 'personally', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'best', 'Secret', 'Ooz', 'was', 'close', 'third', 'one', 'took', 'bit', 'getting', 'used', 'eventually', 'did', 'conclude', 'liked', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'others']",N/A

But you don't have to have played the video game, read the comics, or watched the TV series to enjoy this big-screen version of the adventures of Michaelangelo (voiced by Robbie Rist), Donatello (Corey Feldman), Leonardo (Brian Tochi), and quick-tempered Raphael (Josh Pais), transformed by a mysterious glowing liquid into sentient human-size youngsters and trained in the secret arts of the ninja by Splinter (Kevin Clash), the likewise mutated rat who learned them by watching his former master, one of Japan's foremost experts.  Dwelling in the sewers under the Manhattan streets, the quartet save a TV reporter named April O'Neill (Judith Hoag) from what appears at first to be ordinary juvenile delinquents, but soon discover that they've landed feet first in the affairs of the mysterious Foot Clan, headed by the sinister Shredder (James Saito) and his glowering lieutenant Tatsu (Toshiro Obato).  Meanwhile April's boss (Jay Patterson), all unawares, is harboring a Foot fighter in his own home, in the person of his rebellious teenage son Danny (Michael Turney), and a former pro hockey player, Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), is reinventing himself as a crime-fighting vigilante as well.  Most critics seem to think the story isn't anything to write home about, but if you look at it closely you see that it's not only a new twist on the Fagin motif fromOliver Twist (Unabridged Classics) (Sterling Classics), but a commentary on loyalty, youthful alienation, and the importance of finding your place in the world.

27602,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,0780607287,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","Back in the day, I was a huge Turtles fan. From the cartoon to action figures and whatever Turtle-y stuff was out there, it was usually mine. Of course, like all successful franchises, it gets made into a movie. Spawning 2 sequels and a surprisingly good CGI feature outing, the original is still one of those kind of films where you can't figure out if you're laughing at what you used to like or if it's just actually a good movie. One of the most successful independent movies around, it's still a solid piece of entertainment.The city of New York has just been hit with a massive crime wave with reports of teenagers stealing anything and everything, as well as sightings of weird masked ninjas and thefts happening quite stealthily. News reporter April O'Neal has been making it her business to inform everyone which of course attracts unwanted attention. In come 4 mutated human-sized ninja turtles, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michaelangelo who decide to take the fight to the ninjas, dubbed the Foot Clan and their leader, the Shredder. With the guidance of Splinter, the Turtles end up becoming New York's saviors from crime.Cliche story no? Except for the mutated turtles and rat part, this is pretty much a basic story but of course this is a kid's cartoon so don't expect much. It does have some emotional aspects to it, such as Raphael's bitterness/rivalry towards Leonardo and the groups love for Splinter. Is the script cheesy? Well of course, but that's kind of what makes it fun. It's kind of one of those films where it's largely supposed to be a fun romp and it's what you'd end up getting upon watching. What does become unintentionally funny though are the flashback scenes explaining the Turtles' mutation as well as Splinter's former master and his rival. Stylistically it's quite unique since it takes place against a black background but the puppeteering is so hilarious that it detracts a tad. But then again, Splinter is probably one of the best puppet characters around. Whether he beats Yoda though is another thing.So how does this work as a film? It's actually quite good and it rarely sags. The pacing just feels right, the humor is silly but humorous and you can tell it doesn't feel like a completely low-budget movie. Only issue I had was at times there was 80's sounding music and I felt like ""ugh, what an 80's movie"". Other times though the score was actually good and certain scenes benefited quite a bit from it. Does it have any issues? Well again, people might find it funny due to nostalgia and a kind of ""man, the stuff I used to love"" laughter while other times the costumes looked...odd, like you were way too constantly aware that real characters were talking to humans in suits and not mutated turtles. Of course, I'm reading too much into it.Ever buy a movie simply because it's been so long since you seen it? That's the case here for me.

I would always jump out of the edge of my sofa and imitate what the turtles are doing during the fight scenes. Mainly, I tried to act like my favorite turtle, Leonardo. My mom would always stop me from imitating them too much. When I turned probably about 6 years old, my parents used to buy me Ninja Turtles action figures and soon after, I started to collect them (today, they're collectors items and the cost a lot, according to collectors guides). When I heard that the Ninja Turtles movie was about to release, I was very excited and I always imagined how it would look like when it comes out on video. When I went to my cousins house (where I'm currently living in right now), I finally got a chance to watch the movie for myself and I was not disappointed. The Turtles were totally different. Jim Henson really did a great job in bringing our favorite turtles, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michaelangelo to life. The action is superb. The turtles really fight like never before. You'll find that the action in the movie version is even better. Today as I'm still living and breathing at the age of 17, I own the DVD movie and yes, I'm so proud to own an old memorable movie that I grew up with. Although still wondering when they'll make a new Ninja Turtles series or still continue on with the already canceled series &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot;, I still think this will keep me busy until the other two TMNT movies get restored on DVD. If you're an old fan of the series, and you want to relive all the excitement you used to have as a kid, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie will never let you down.",5,The Ninja Turtles will be remembered forever !,1003536000,"10 20, 2001",2001,1886,"['1989', 'when', 'was', '5', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'introduced', 'first', 'favorite', 'action', 'cartoon', 'series', 'quot', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'quot', 'would', 'always', 'wake', 'up', 'morning', 'turn', 'TV', 'just', 'watch', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'everyday', 'brother', 'would', 'always', 'jump', 'edge', 'sofa', 'imitate', 'what', 'turtles', 'are', 'doing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Mainly', 'tried', 'act', 'favorite', 'turtle', 'Leonardo', 'mom', 'would', 'always', 'stop', 'imitating', 'too', 'much', 'When', 'turned', 'probably', '6', 'years', 'old', 'parents', 'used', 'buy', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'action', 'figures', 'soon', 'started', 'collect', 'today', ""'re"", 'collectors', 'items', 'cost', 'lot', 'according', 'collectors', 'guides', 'When', 'heard', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'movie', 'was', 'release', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'always', 'imagined', 'how', 'would', 'look', 'when', 'out', 'video', 'When', 'went', 'cousins', 'house', 'where', ""'m"", 'currently', 'living', 'right', 'now', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'myself', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Turtles', 'were', 'totally', 'different', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'favorite', 'turtles', 'Leonardo', 'Donatello', 'Raphael', 'Michaelangelo', 'life', 'action', 'superb', 'turtles', 'really', 'fight', 'never', 'before', ""'ll"", 'find', 'action', 'movie', 'version', 'even', 'better', 'Today', ""'m"", 'still', 'living', 'breathing', 'age', '17', 'own', 'DVD', 'movie', 'yes', ""'m"", 'so', 'proud', 'own', 'old', 'memorable', 'movie', 'grew', 'up', 'still', 'wondering', 'when', ""'ll"", 'make', 'new', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'series', 'still', 'continue', 'already', 'canceled', 'series', 'quot', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'Next', 'Mutation', 'quot', 'still', 'think', 'will', 'keep', 'busy', 'other', 'two', 'TMNT', 'movies', 'get', 'restored', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'old', 'fan', 'series', 'want', 'relive', 'excitement', 'used', 'have', 'kid', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Movie', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'down']",N/A

It does a good job of staying child friendly while introducing some of the better elements of the original, definitely for adults graphic novel. It's not a perfect film, obviously. It borrows some elements a little too heavily from other sources (Shredder saying &#34;I am your father&#34; was a bit much even for a 10 year old) and you can tell where the limited budget went to (the turtle puppets/costumes) and where it didn't (wardrobe, set design, lighting/photography*, supporting cast) but it tells a surprisingly solid, if simple, story, and gives every Turtle his due. Elias Koteas and Judith Hoag are quite good as Casey Jones and April O'Neil, and the Turtle voices are all good - even Corey Feldman as Donatello.  The fight choreography is exciting and well staged without being too violent for younger kids. For all its warts, it's a guarantee that this will remain the definitive TMNT film, even after Michael Bay tries to ruin it next year.*It really can't be overstated that the film stock and lighting in the film are subpar. New Line was a very small studio when they made this film, and this was their largest project by far at the time (how times have changed). The film is very grainy, dark and flatly lit. It's not a shock that the only really good-looking scenes are in natural light. It gives the film a rough, realistic look, but it was clearly done for financial and not artistic reasons. Still, those turtle suits look great, and remain the true stars!",4,Perfect nostalgic movie.

America's most favorite Turtles made a huge impact in this film that was originally geared towards kids but turned out to be huge for fans of all types (action, martial arts, comedy and of course the TMNT fans).I won't deny it, I did like this movie. It was pretty good. The action sequences were excellent and choreographed very well. No ""one hit and go down"" stuff. The fight scenes in this were very fluid. The turtles were well represented as well (from the comic) and made this movie a pretty good adaptation.One thing that will forever bother me was that Hockey Mask toting psychopath Casey Jones was perceived as this little pretty boy with a mask on instead of his true comic book personality of a deranged, former athlete turned vigilante. In the comics, Casey Jones is very intimidating but in the movie, he was just another baby face which I could've done without.If you were going to buy any of the Turtles movies, this would be the one because this one was more of a Martial Arts action film instead of what it turned into later in Secret of the Ooze, a cheap slapstick comedy with the occasional fight scene with let's not forget the horrid ""Ninja Rap"" song by everyone's favorite most chewed up, spit out and now washed up MC, Vanilla Ice.Again, TMNT the Movie is good. It's not astonishing and it's not poor but it is good. I personally wouldn't give it anymore than that.

The movie attempted to capture the spirit of the original Mirage TMNT comics.While the plot and dark tone probably weren't the greatest choice for a movie geared towards kids, for an adult it's actually quite deep. There's a lot of interesting stuff about finding family. Some of the scenes are classic and still stay fresh in my mind, particularly the moments of the turtles relaxing at April's summer house. It's a much better story than you'd expect from a kid's movie.The movie was made before the era of CGI graphics. I have mixed feelings about the giant rubber suits they used for the turtles. While they're outdated, the costume designers fit a decent amount of animation in the costumes. They work by and large. But they do look outdated. In short, if you think you can overlook the fact that the rubber suits might look a bit cheesy at times, then this movie will probably work for you. If you care a lot about special effects, then this movie will drive you nuts.Looking back, it's actually shocking how good this movie is. It's a lot more mature than any of the movies coming out today based on comic books, including The Avengers. If anything, I think this movie might have been ahead of its time. I'd love to see a remake with better turtles costumes.",4,Actually aged quite well,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,1519,"['remember', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'movie', 'being', 'wholeheartedly', 'TMNT', 'phenomenon', 'pretty', 'dark', 'compared', 'cartoons', 'However', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'movie', 'attempted', 'capture', 'spirit', 'original', 'Mirage', 'TMNT', 'comics.While', 'plot', 'dark', 'tone', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'choice', 'movie', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', 'adult', 'actually', 'quite', 'deep', 'lot', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'finding', 'family', 'scenes', 'are', 'classic', 'still', 'stay', 'fresh', 'mind', 'particularly', 'moments', 'turtles', 'relaxing', 'April', 'summer', 'house', 'much', 'better', 'story', ""'d"", 'expect', 'kid', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'era', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'giant', 'rubber', 'suits', 'used', 'turtles', ""'re"", 'outdated', 'costume', 'designers', 'fit', 'decent', 'amount', 'animation', 'costumes', 'work', 'large', 'do', 'look', 'outdated', 'short', 'think', 'can', 'overlook', 'fact', 'rubber', 'suits', 'might', 'look', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'times', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'work', 'care', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'drive', 'nuts.Looking', 'back', 'actually', 'shocking', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'mature', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'today', 'based', 'comic', 'books', 'including', 'Avengers', 'anything', 'think', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ahead', 'time', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'remake', 'better', 'turtles', 'costumes']",N/A

The thing about this film watching it now that I am an adult; it's still a very fun movie to enjoy.I sat down recently with a few of my college buddies and we watched this film as we all grew up as fans of the cartoon.  All of us remembered watching it when we were little and we wanted to gain a new perspective of it.The movie is just down-right funny!  It truly is.  The character of Casey Jones just adds so much comic relief to the movie, and it gels perfectly.  Along with the humor is the basic premise that stays true to the cartoon version, but also delvs a bit deeper.  Here, we learn the true background of Splinter and just how exactly he relates to Shredder.Another thing I like about the film is the fact that each character got their own very unique personality.  Another reviewer described the turtles and their traits so I'll spare you that grief, but the character of April is also right up there.  I was very happy to see that the character of April was really her own person, separate from the turtles.  She knew when to stand up for herself and she knew when to lie low.If you're looking for a movie that has action, cheesyness, and humor; than this is it.

Out of a spontaneous urge to watch this movie I went out and bought it.TNMT was a great movie Thirteen years ago and still is today! Having grossed 130 million, it successfully intertwine both the original black and white, bloody comic book and the mid 1980s kiddy cartoon, taking the story and the look of the Shredder from the comic book and the look and attitude of the turtles from the cartoon.The film starts with April O&#65533;Neils news narrative about the sudden increasing &#65533;Silent Crime Wave&#65533; then on the way home she gets mugged, suddenly the lights go out and all the assailants are hog tied!

The cinematography is mind blowing as well. The seen with the grand entrance of the Shredder is one long unbroken crane shot, shadow, bright light reflecting off of his helmet and that wacky cape he wore gives of a massive sense of nemesis.

With the voice talents of Corey Feldman, Josh Pais, and featuring Elias Koteas, it is surprisingly good.The story takes a fairly mature tone that helps it appeal to a much broader age range than one might initially suppose.  The storyline is inclusive and rich, encompassing uncompromising emotional and physical trials for the Turtles.  Judith Hoag is decent as April O'Neill, the newswoman who befriends the Turtles.  The Turtles themselves, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, spring into three-dimensional being in an achievement of visual effects that was fairly jaw-dropping by 1990 standards and holds up well today.  Elias Koteas is perfect as Casey Jones, the hockey-loving antihero whose compassion and good heart compel him to side with the Turtles.  The screenplay invests fairly minor characters with genuine fascination.  The wayward Danny Pennington, the son of April's boss, is an incisive sympathetic character, a symbol of goodness gone wrong.  He humanizes the danger the Foot Clan, the movie's evil martial arts gang, poses.Also starring character actor James Saito as the Turtles' enemy Shredder, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is surprisingly solid.

Then we got the immensely popular 1987 Fred Wolf cartoon which put the Turtles on the map. Then came a series of arcade and video games. Then there were toys, cereal, bed sheets, pajamas and a whole lot of other merchandise. Then in 1990, we were given this movie. This film was surprising to many people as it was a different animal than the cartoon. It was very dark for what is perceived as primarily a children's property. That's because this film is primarily based on the original Mirage Comics which are not for small children. There are brief curse words and some bits of over the top violence. Overall, the plot is terrific and works extremely well as an origin story. 27 years later the film still holds up as a classic. It is one of those movies that needs to be seen by everyone at least once. Animatronics were pretty innovative at the time of the film's release and it is surprising on another viewing of the film just how well the technical aspects of the movie work. 5 out of 5 stars.

27628,A319SKSB556033,0780607287,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[2, 8]","This movie has elements of potential greatness to it. If more were made of the Jim Henson animatronics and if it had stuck closer to the comic-book source instead of giving us a live action version of the awful (let's be honest) 80's animated show then it could have been a classic. Not what we get.The original black and white comics of TMNT were a-maz-ing! The depth, the mythology, the subtext, the endless Lovecraftian allusions and the overall coolness of it is something so great I am sure it can never be done again. The 80's animated show was a travesty. We got robots instead of humans in the Foot Clan, the friendly Utrom aliens were made into a bad guy (Krang), Rocksteady and Beebop!, the Technodrome!, underground drilling machine-thingies and those awful, awful surfer dialect words. Who can honestly NOT cringe when they hear 'Cowabunga', 'bodacious' or 'excellent' in this day and age?The plot loosely matches that of the first issue of the comic-book. Only it's toned down and it's too heavily influenced by the TV show. The Shredder has a tamer 'death' compared to the comic book (he was thrown off a roof while holding a live hand grenade-BOOM!). Though I am glad the Turtles' origin is told in flashback instead of starting right at the beginning like so many other comic-book movies.Steve Barron's direction (Merlin and erm...Coneheads) brings some integrity to the film. I like the grainy and gritty look to some scenes and he seems to take the animatronics more seriously than the directors for the later sequels.Speaking of which, the animatronics are actually still quite good and if made today I'd still be impressed. The real human cast is a bit of a letdown. Judith Hoag is awful as April O'Neil, in the comics she was a lab assistant to the evil Baxter Stockman but the TV show inexplicably changed her to a News Reporter. That's what she is here. And the ginger kid who plays Danny is pretty bad also. However, Elias Koteas is totally brilliant as Casey Jones. I can't imagine anyone being more perfect in this role.The humor, minus the surfer drawl, is still funny. I especially like Raphael (my fave-he has a BAD attitude) coming out of a cinema showing 'Critters' and saying 'Where the hell do they come up with this stuff?'And John Du Prez's(who???) score may sound heavily dated in parts but it keeps the action scenes moving along nicely. The fights may look incredibly staged and false but at least they have a nice beat.It's still superior to the sequels and plenty fun.

I thought it was a great movie at the time, and still enjoy watching from time to time.  TMNT stars Judith Hoag as April O'Neal, Elias Koteas as Casey Jones, and Corey Feldmen as the voice of Donatello.The story takes place in New York, where a popular television reporter, April O'Neal, reports of recent rise in crime which she believes there is more to it then what the police department is saying.  Of course, the people doing the crime want her to shut up.  They are The Shredder and his group of ninjas called The Foot.  During an attack by The Foot, April O'Neal is rescued by one of the turtles and taken to the turtles home.  Soon Splinter, the turtles master, is kidnapped and they meet another ally, Casey Jones, who helps to rescue Splinter.Most critics will write Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles off as a terrible movie.  They always do when it's a movie directed towards the young (with Disney Animated features being the exception).  It may be no Citzen Cane, then again, it isn't trying to be.

It shows the well known genetically mutated turtles Leonardo (voice of Brian Tochi), Michaelangelo (voice of Robbie Rist), Donnatello (voice of Corey Fieldman), and Raphael (voice of Josh Pais), trained by Master Splinter (voice of Kevin Clash), have their first encounter with the evil Shredder (voice of David McCharen), who has been poisoning the minds of teens and spreading a crime wave all over New York. When the Foot Clan kidnapped Splinter, the turtles team up with Casey Jones (Elias Koteas) and April O'Neill (Judith Hoag). When I saw this film, I was amazed on how real it is. It was dark and gritty like the comics with a share of kid friendliness. The turtles talk like adults, with a bit of profane language like ''damn'', for example. The battles' fight coreography was pulled off really well. The animatronics look pretty real as well. Even the acting was good. This is also the best film in the series. Its success would later spawn 3 additional films, but none better than the first. In fact, the second may have had its share of stupidity, but was still a decent sequel. The third was the real deal, it stunk to high heck! The animated fourth made a decent comeback, and are planning a fifth, where they would give live-action another shot with computer enhanced turtles.

I'm a little surprised that my parents sat through some of these things with a straight face.That said, every now and then I need to remind myself of the things that have gone into making me me, and that includes the Turtles.  Watching this, I remember how I was upset that Splinter here had always been a rat, while in the cartoons, he was Hamato Yoshi, a great Ninja master transformed into a rat by Shredder's secret ooze.  I remember my homemade nunchaku, made from some 1"" dowel rod, two eyescrews, and some nylon cord.  I remember saying ""bodacious,"" and ""cowabunga,"" and dreaming of myself as Leonardo.  I remember seeing Turtles II on opening night while on vacation with my best friend--having pestered my dad to take us.These days, I hear the synth drums in the beginning, the reference to MC Hammer in the credits, and I see how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has aged.  But I remember seeing this in the theater and I'm reminded in a good way that I've aged too.  It's not The Goonies, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or Back to the Future, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is still fun.",4,"Ah, nostalgia....",1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,1691,"['Well', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'here', 'bed', 'neck', 'swollen', 'what', 'better', 'activity', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Videos', 'movie', ""'m"", 'one', 'legions', 'TMNT', 'fans', 'who', 'saw', 'show', 'TV', 'bought', 'action', 'figures', 'course', 'saw', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'back', 'smell', 'musty', 'old', 'movie', 'theaters', 'pre-cupholders', 'pre-megaplexes', 'crunch', 'old', 'popcorn', 'dried', 'soda', 'underfoot', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'loved', 'loved', 'sequel', 'course', 'also', 'loved', 'Wizard', 'Troop', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Ghostbusters', 'II', 'host', 'other', 'movies', 'storylines', 'are', 'somewhat', 'questionable', ""'m"", 'little', 'surprised', 'parents', 'sat', 'things', 'straight', 'face.That', 'said', 'now', 'then', 'need', 'remind', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'making', 'Turtles', 'Watching', 'remember', 'how', 'was', 'upset', 'Splinter', 'here', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'rat', 'cartoons', 'was', 'Hamato', 'Yoshi', 'great', 'Ninja', 'master', 'transformed', 'rat', 'Shredder', 'secret', 'ooze', 'remember', 'homemade', 'nunchaku', 'made', '1', 'dowel', 'rod', 'two', 'eyescrews', 'nylon', 'cord', 'remember', 'saying', 'bodacious', 'cowabunga', 'dreaming', 'Leonardo', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Turtles', 'II', 'opening', 'night', 'vacation', 'best', 'friend', 'having', 'pestered', 'dad', 'take', 'us.These', 'days', 'hear', 'synth', 'drums', 'beginning', 'reference', 'MC', 'Hammer', 'credits', 'see', 'how', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'aged', 'remember', 'seeing', 'theater', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'good', 'way', ""'ve"", 'aged', 'too', 'not', 'Goonies', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Back', 'Future', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'still', 'fun']",N/A
27643,A203GG76ILPS1A,0780607287,JonathanDP81,"[2, 2]","One goes into this film expecting a stupidity fest, but you come out pleasantly surprised. Maybe it's low expectations, but it turns out to be much better than you would think. This picture is one of the series of children's character movie tie-ins, and by all rights it should be unbearably awful, just like the rest.Luckily for us, the filmmakers seemed to realize that the turtles had a large adult audience from the comic books out there, so they managed to sneak in a little real drama and some actual character development into this so-called children's movie. Unfortunately, as the cartoon show came to dominate and the turtles were seen as only a kid's phenomenon, this element was sadly taken out of later entries in the series.Many things were thankfully gotten right. The turtles were done very well here. Unlike watching, say, `Howard The Duck', I found it rather easy here to suspend my disbelief and forget that I'm watching four guys in rubber suits. The comedic aspects of their personalities were hit bang on as well, the banter flowing smoothly and true to form. The fight scenes, while not very memorable, were done with some talent behind them and turn out rather well. The character of Casey Jones is surprisingly believable and likeable.Now, I'm not nominating this film for any awards, not by a long shot. It's a quickie tie-in, so there is the expected large list of flaws. April O'Neil, as in all the other entries in the series, is acted horrendously badly. The filmmakers go through the background story so quickly that it would easy to miss something. The final fight with Shredder is woefully disappointing, with this supposedly unbeatable ninja being taken in by a childishly simple trick.But, overall, I'd say this is a good family picture, better than most of junk that's put out in the genre. The kids should like it, and hopefully the parents won't be bored out of their skulls by it.",4,A surprise to say the least.,1000944000,"09 20, 2001",2001,1918,"['One', 'film', 'expecting', 'stupidity', 'fest', 'come', 'out', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Maybe', 'low', 'expectations', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'think', 'picture', 'one', 'series', 'children', 'character', 'movie', 'tie-ins', 'rights', 'should', 'be', 'unbearably', 'awful', 'just', 'rest.Luckily', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'realize', 'turtles', 'had', 'large', 'adult', 'audience', 'comic', 'books', 'there', 'managed', 'sneak', 'little', 'real', 'drama', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'so-called', 'children', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'cartoon', 'show', 'came', 'dominate', 'turtles', 'were', 'seen', 'only', 'kid', 'phenomenon', 'element', 'was', 'sadly', 'taken', 'out', 'later', 'entries', 'series.Many', 'things', 'were', 'thankfully', 'gotten', 'right', 'turtles', 'were', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'watching', 'say', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'found', 'rather', 'easy', 'here', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'forget', ""'m"", 'watching', 'four', 'guys', 'rubber', 'suits', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'personalities', 'were', 'hit', 'bang', 'as', 'well', 'banter', 'flowing', 'smoothly', 'true', 'form', 'fight', 'scenes', 'not', 'very', 'memorable', 'were', 'done', 'talent', 'turn', 'out', 'rather', 'well', 'character', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'surprisingly', 'believable', 'likeable.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'nominating', 'film', 'awards', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'quickie', 'tie-in', 'expected', 'large', 'list', 'flaws', 'April', ""O'Neil"", 'other', 'entries', 'series', 'acted', 'horrendously', 'badly', 'filmmakers', 'go', 'background', 'story', 'so', 'quickly', 'would', 'easy', 'miss', 'something', 'final', 'fight', 'Shredder', 'woefully', 'disappointing', 'supposedly', 'unbeatable', 'ninja', 'being', 'taken', 'childishly', 'simple', 'trick.But', 'overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'family', 'picture', 'better', 'most', 'junk', 'put', 'out', 'genre', 'kids', 'should', 'like', 'hopefully', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'skulls']",N/A
27644,A25RN8X70DSZLU,0780607287,JRP,"[0, 1]","Before I do my 20 years ago review I thought why not do a review for all 3 movies since I haven't seen the 1st 2 TMNT films in like 11 or 12 years. This is a review & retrospective on The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie from 1990. Made on a budget of $13 million made $25 million in it's opening weekend & $135 million in it's entire run in The US. Worldwide it made $201 million & this was money in 1990. I am suprised that this movie doesn't have a special edition. This franchise has a huge fan base & I just saw this for the 1st time in over 11 years & I forgot how much fun was & the tone they set was so good that adults & kids could enjoy it. The movie was directed by Steve Barron the only other movie I have seen by him was Coneheads & I don't remember if I liked or not. The movie stars James Saito as Shredder, Judith Hoag as April O'Neil, Elians Koteas as Casey Jones, Josh Pais as Raphael * is voiced by Josh Pais too. Leif Tilden as Donatello & voiced by Corey Feldman. Michelan Sisto as Michaelanglo voiced by Robbie Rist, David Forman as Loenardo & voiced by Brian Tochi. Michael Turney as Danny, Jay Patterson as Charles Pennington, Tosishiro Obata as Tatsu & Kevin Clash as Splinter. The story is there is a lot of thieft going on in New York City by this group called The Foot Clan a reporter named April O'Neil is doing a lot of news stories on it. Some Foot Soldiers have been sent out to capture her but a group as we all know as The Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtles save her  you have Leonardo who is the leader Raphael who has a short fuse but is likeable Michaelanglo who is the comic relief & Donatello who is the intellgent 1 in the group. You then have Splinter who is like their father. Raphael who lost a sai when fighting The Foot Clan decides to go out for a walk he stops these 2 muggers then you're introduced to Casey Jones a vigilante & they have a brief fight with Jones getting away. I also remember this scene cause Raphael yells d  a  m  n I like the humor like when Michaelanglo orders a pizza & he doesn't want anchovies he says if I find any anchovies there will be serious trouble Splinter throws a book he's reading at Michaelanglo. You have the scene with the pizza delivery guy who can't find the place Michaelanglo is like down here dude he slids the pizza down & gets $10 but the tab is $13 he says he had trouble Michaelanglo responds by saying ""Wise man say, forgivness is devine, but never pay full price for pizza that is late."" The way they cut up the pizza is funny. You have April O'Neil's boss Charles try to have her take some time off Charles son Danny wants to be part of The Foot Clan & steals $20 from April's purse. Shredder the leader of The Foot Clan has his men go & slience April O'Neil. They attack her in The Subway Raphael shows up & fights off The Foot Soldiers & gets April to safety a Foot Soldier follows them & finds out where turtles live at. Aoril O'Neil wakes up & Splinter tells her how he was a rat & he found 4 baby turtles in this ooze that will come into play during the 2nd movie. Anyway the ooze caused them to grow as well as Splinter too it also caused them  to talk. The turtles go to April's Apartment & hang out there for awhile when they get back the sewer they find out that Splinter has been taken. Meanwhile Danny has ran away & goes to this hideout for The Foot Clan where kids have access to arcade games & cigarette's which I always have remembered this kid asking for cigarette's & this guys says regular or mental. The turtles stay at April's apartment. Raphael wants to go & get Splinter Leonardo tells him that we need to have a plan & see what kind of information that April can come up with. That just made Raphael mad he goes up to the roof to calm down & he is attacked by some Foot Soldiers on another building Casey Jones sees what's going on. April returns & she shows the turtles her Father's Antique Store. She wonders where Raphael is at Michaelanglo says he needed to blow off some steam. April asks hasn't he been gone a long time.  Donatello says he does this all the time he likes it. Raphael is thrown through the skylight & knocked unconscious. The rest of the turtles fight The Foot Soldiers Michaelanglo & 1 of The Foot Soldiers have a game of can you top that with nunchuku's which was funny. Donatello jumps over him attacks them with a staff. When The Foot Soldiers dunk Leonardo's head in a fish tank & squirts water in 1 of The Foot Soldiers faces & when Michaelanglo spins on his shelll & knocks some Foot Soldiers down. Is a lot of fun you could tell that the makers were having fun making this movie. You have The Foot Soldiers attack them with axe's the floor gives away where they fall into the shop. Then you have Shredder's right hand man Tatsu come in with more Foot Soldiers. Casey Jones drops in Michaelanglo says who is this Wayne Gretzky on steroids. During the fight I love the piece of musice by John Du Prez. 1 of The Foot Soldiers accidently cut an electrical line & cause a fire. The turtles April & Casey Jones escape & go to this Farm House where Raphael recovers & they all train to go after The Foot Clan. You also have this relationship that builds between Casey Jones & April. While meditationg Leonardo gets a message from Splinter he tells the others & that night they all meditate around a fire where they get a message by Splinter telling what they need to do. I also liked where they did a parody of Rocky IV & Raphael yells Splinter. They go back to NYC where they find that kid Danny in the sewer they also find this pizza that is no good Donatello & Michaleanglo hum some funeral music I also remembered this scene. Danny sneaks out Casey Jones follows him to The Foot Clan hideout. Danny talks to Splinter he tells of this man Yoshi that was his owner he had this rivalry with this man named Oruku Saki & he wanted his girl Tang Shen but she only wanted Yoshi so they fled to The US where Oruku Saki followed them killed Teng Shen when Yoshi came home he was killed by Oruku in a struggle & the cage Splinter was in was knocked down. Splinter jumped at Oruku & bit his cheeck he knocked the rat down to the ground & sliced part of his ear off. Of course Oruku Saki became Shredder. Casey Jones sneaks into the hideout beats up a Foot Soldier takes his uniform. Shredder finds Danny he knows the turtles are back he tells Tatsu to kill Splinter Shredder takes a platoon of Foot Soldiers with him to go after the turtles. Casey tries to get Danny & Splinter out of there but has a fight with Tatsu. Tatsu owns him for most of the fight. Casey grabs a Golf Club knocks hits him down south then smacks it across his head knocking him out. Splinter tells the kids that Shredder doesn't care about them. Meanwhile The Foot Soldiers invade the sewers. The turtles outsmart them they release some kind of steam or smoke from the pipes blocking their sight & they get pwnd. You have the next wave of Foot Soldiers come in & you have some entertaining fight scenes. You have The Foot Soldies flee to the surface & the turtles take them down & they come up with cheesy lines on the spot which got a laugh out of me. You have Shredder show up & he easily beats the turtles they hold their own Leonardo manages to cut Shredder's arm open. Shredder tells them that Splinter has been killed. Leonardo charges twords Shredder & is knocked down he tells the other turtles to there weapons. Splinter shows up confronts Shredder where Shredder charges at him he's thrown over the roof & is hanging on barely. Shredder throws a knife at Splinter but he catches it & lets go of his grip Shredder falls in the back of a Garbage Truck where Casey turns on the compactor & says oops. Danny reunites withg his Dad. April & Casey share a kiss you have the turtles all yell Cowabunga. That's pretty much the movie if I didn't explain the plot all that well in my retrospective I'm sorry about that. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an all time classic that adults & children can enjoy. Cause of the crime issue's of the late 80's & early 90's it deals with along with the family unit vibe it has. The slapstick humor if you want to call it that just works. The fight scens are good & well shot. The animatronics & costume's by Jim Henson's creature shop are great. Very  good direction by Steve Barron. James Saito was good. Judith Hoag was pretty good. Elias Koteas was good. David Forman, Josh Pais, Leif Tilden & Micahelan Saski all did a very good job having to play these characters. The voice acting by Corey Feldman, Josh Pais, Robbie Rist, Brian Tochi & Kevin Clash was good. Not a whole lot wrong with it only it's been 23 years & hasn't got a special edition which I saw all 3 movies on You t  u  be & I would buy this movie if got a Special Edition.

Like Mortal Kombat, the script is kind of funny, but dialogue doesn't always make a good movie. I was five years old when this movie first came out, and remember seeing it on TV later on. I had the comics, the action figures, watched the cartoon and loved all the movies. The truth is, TMNT never really went uncool, and it never will. I now own the DVD and still watch it regularly.The first movie follows the comics closely at first, and a little more loosely later on. I thought it was excellent, and it doesn't ruin the intentions of the comic book. It is not by any means a serious movie. That is what made it  such a huge and long-lasting success.Just as in the comics, Rafael, Michealangelo, Leonardo, and Donatello live in a sewer with their mentor, a mutant rat named Splinter. They fall in with April O'Neill, a TV news reporter, to find the Foot Clan and its leader, their arch-enemy The Shredder. Casey Jones (""Wayne Gretzky? On steroids?"") comes in later to help them find the band of thieves. The Shredder has his own elaborate underground hideout (complete with arcade and mini-skatepark), and recruits kids to join his army by allowing them to do whatever they want in there, on one condition. They have to follow his orders and train to become one of the ""elite"" ninjas. It's pretty funny that the kids playing poker and smoking all look about 10 to 12 years old. The pizza-loving Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ultimately have to fight to stop The Shredder and break up the Foot Clan.I can't even tell you how cool this movie is.

Prior to CGI ruling the big screen, yes, studios had to make the best with what they had and this was the film that topped Dark Crystal when it came to puppetry and animatronics. Personally, animatronics give the film a more realistic feel. The newer version of the Turtles that's about to come out just looks fake in my eyes. Anyway, back to this film.

I loved the Turtles when I was a kid and I watched the cartoon, played with my brother's action figures (tomboy as a child, guilty as charged) and played the video games all the time. When the movie first came out of course I was all about seeing it, and as a child I couldn't have been more enchanted with it.Fast forward to the year 2004, where I am a 19 year old college honor student who still has an affection for things of her past I purchased this video after stumbling over it on this website and have since watched it about 4 times.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles One is a rare gift as far as live action movies based on a cartoon can get. Is it a masterpiece? Not necessarily. But it gets the job done better than anyone could expect. For one thing it creates the Turtles on a level slightly elevated past their cartoon personas, where they seem to have more feasible personalities. Raphael being the most realistic of them, almost a typical New Yorkers. The magic about this movie is you could go into it not knowing who the Turtles are or having ever seen the cartoon and you won't necessarily walk away from it confused. The story holds well on its on, and while it is not 100% accurate to the cartoon, it makes for good movie watching and it's dark mood will appeal to adults while the Turtles wackiness will draw in the kids.

I loved the cartoon and watching the movie was an even better experience. This film has a great story, characters, action, and turtles what more can you ask(no don't even think about it). One particular aspect I loved about the film and was so glad that they did it and did a superb job at it too... was the themes of master and student, of unity. The loyalty, the friendship, the value of ethic and code of honor( also the father and son thing and it adds depth to the emotional level). Its not an easy task to tackle these deep and meaningful issues but when done properly it elevates a films to a greater film...this film could have easily just been a action flick, ass kicking turtle to entertain the kids but it didn't and i am soo glad it didn't... It goes to show what good film makers can do to even the simplest stories...thats why TMNT the original movie is one of my old time favrioutes...Lets examine the tutles, those wonderful green characters of the film... each has their own personality, thoughts, feelings, and styles but all are discplined under one master splinter, he is as much a master as a father to the turtles and looks forward to the day his sons learns the true art of fighting and true value of each and others. The film is clever in the sense its very well balanced for example you have your heroes, the turtles but you also have your non believer which is april who later became a close friend of the turtles, again you have turtles who fights the bad guys but the turtles have limitations and they are binded to the code of honor hence introduced cassy john an independent crime fighter who believe in taking justice in his own hand and has no limitation to what he can do... so you have a clever mix of characters that balances out all the bump of the film...another aspect of the film looks at the struggle of a leadership in the turtle 4some team where raphel is stubborn and independent whereas lenoardo seems to be the natural leader but he's more cautious and more of a team player but in the end they both recongnise the power and strength of ONE... ofcos this also indicates that our turtle heores goes through a learning curve and matures into the heroes in the end.There are plenty of memoriable bits in this film and i will try to list some of them... the most memorable for me was the scene when leonardo and the others rescue raphel and has retreat back to april's country cottage and lenoardo is sitting on the chair nurturing raphel and april takes the time to draw leo that was the moment that send me in tears, the next bit is when cassey john and april heats up i like this scene cos its a nice change and it really ease the pace of the film giving it warmth... next scene is when the 4 turtles trains hard and sits together and meditate then establish a mental connection with splinter and splinters tell he loves all of his sons(turtles) that send me in tears again... the final fight scene with shradder and shradder captures one of the turtle and forces the others to lose their weapons, further re-enforce the bonds they have for one another... and then splinter shows up and uses one of the nun chunk to send shradder to his pitful end in the dump that bit send me cheering! yeah!!!! plus i love the beginning scene when we are first introduced to the turtles, mic dancing to the music and raphel is so much more mature. April meeting the turtles is a great scene too... hmmm i think i am listing all the movie here you guys know what i mean....what can i say Turtles rocks! big time !!!i give a 5 / 5 stars cos 4 for each of the turtles and 1 more for its great entainment value...cowabunga!!!",5,Cowabunga!!!,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,3759,"['TMNT', 'movie', 'best', 'movie', 'turtles', 'really', 'truely', 'classic', 'genre', 'loved', 'cartoon', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'experience', 'film', 'great', 'story', 'characters', 'action', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'One', 'particular', 'aspect', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'too', 'was', 'themes', 'master', 'student', 'unity', 'loyalty', 'friendship', 'value', 'ethic', 'code', 'honor', 'also', 'father', 'son', 'thing', 'depth', 'emotional', 'level', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'tackle', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'issues', 'when', 'done', 'properly', 'films', 'greater', 'film', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'just', 'been', 'action', 'flick', 'ass', 'kicking', 'turtle', 'entertain', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'i', 'am', 'soo', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'makers', 'can', 'do', 'even', 'simplest', 'stories', 'why', 'TMNT', 'original', 'movie', 'one', 'old', 'time', 'favrioutes', 'examine', 'tutles', 'wonderful', 'green', 'characters', 'film', 'own', 'personality', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'styles', 'are', 'discplined', 'one', 'master', 'splinter', 'as', 'much', 'master', 'father', 'turtles', 'forward', 'day', 'sons', 'true', 'art', 'fighting', 'true', 'value', 'others', 'film', 'clever', 'sense', 'very', 'well', 'balanced', 'example', 'have', 'heroes', 'turtles', 'also', 'have', 'non', 'believer', 'april', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'close', 'friend', 'turtles', 'again', 'have', 'turtles', 'who', 'fights', 'bad', 'guys', 'turtles', 'have', 'limitations', 'are', 'binded', 'code', 'honor', 'hence', 'introduced', 'cassy', 'john', 'independent', 'crime', 'fighter', 'who', 'believe', 'taking', 'justice', 'own', 'hand', 'limitation', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'clever', 'mix', 'characters', 'out', 'bump', 'film', 'aspect', 'film', 'struggle', 'leadership', 'turtle', '4some', 'team', 'where', 'raphel', 'stubborn', 'independent', 'whereas', 'lenoardo', 'be', 'natural', 'leader', 'more', 'cautious', 'more', 'team', 'player', 'end', 'recongnise', 'power', 'strength', 'ONE', 'ofcos', 'also', 'turtle', 'learning', 'curve', 'heroes', 'are', 'plenty', 'memoriable', 'bits', 'film', 'i', 'will', 'try', 'list', 'most', 'memorable', 'was', 'scene', 'when', 'leonardo', 'others', 'rescue', 'raphel', 'retreat', 'back', 'april', 'country', 'cottage', 'lenoardo', 'sitting', 'chair', 'nurturing', 'raphel', 'april', 'time', 'draw', 'leo', 'was', 'moment', 'send', 'tears', 'next', 'bit', 'when', 'cassey', 'john', 'april', 'up', 'i', 'scene', 'nice', 'change', 'really', 'ease', 'pace', 'film', 'giving', 'warmth', 'next', 'scene', 'when', '4', 'turtles', 'trains', 'hard', 'together', 'meditate', 'then', 'establish', 'mental', 'connection', 'splinter', 'splinters', 'tell', 'sons', 'turtles', 'send', 'tears', 'again', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'shradder', 'shradder', 'captures', 'one', 'turtle', 'others', 'lose', 'weapons', 'further', 're-enforce', 'bonds', 'have', 'one', 'then', 'splinter', 'up', 'one', 'nun', 'chunk', 'send', 'shradder', 'pitful', 'end', 'dump', 'send', 'cheering', 'yeah', 'i', 'love', 'beginning', 'scene', 'when', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'turtles', 'mic', 'dancing', 'music', 'raphel', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'April', 'meeting', 'turtles', 'great', 'scene', 'too', 'hmmm', 'i', 'think', 'i', 'am', 'listing', 'movie', 'here', 'guys', 'know', 'what', 'i', 'mean', '.what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'Turtles', 'rocks', 'big', 'time', 'i', 'give', '5', '/', '5', 'stars', 'cos', '4', 'turtles', '1', 'more', 'great', 'entainment', 'value', 'cowabunga']",N/A

We thought we were going to see Ernest Goes to Jail when what I got was one of my favorite movies of all time.The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a huge cartoon show. Anybody that was around in the late 1980's remembers these guys even if they never watched it. The four heros named after the artists have become a pop culture legend and this live action movie of the heros didn't disappoint at all.Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael are the Ninja turtles. They were found by there master Splinter in a sewer in green ooze. The ooze mutated the turtles and splinter into walking talking human size animals. Splinter being from Japan had learned karate from mimicking the moves of his master.April O'neil(Hoag) is one of the top reporters in New York City. Her big report is on a clan of teenage ninjas who call themselves the Footclan. They are running amuck in the city and come after her one night after work. She is saved when the light in the parking lot turns in pitch black. She has no idea who saved her but is grateful.During the fight Raphael loses one of his Sais. Determined to get it back he starts to tag the reporter and follow her. He rescues her again because the Shredder(Saito) has sent his men after her again. He takes her back to the turlte lair and is unaware that he was followed. Splinter nurses April back to health and she befriends the Turtles.Shredder doesn't stop and sends the men for revenge. The Foot kidnap Splinter and the Turtles go into hiding with April. Their cover is soon blown and Foot attacks her at her home. The Turtles along with Casey Jones(Koteas) retreat. With Splinter gone and Raphael hurt the moral is shot of the group. They must recover save Splinter and stop the Footclan.I loved this movie as a child. I have the old school VHS version with the kid in the pizza hut commercial ""Making It Great."" I also love the theme song for the movie ""Turtle Power"" by MC Hammer. Thats some good old school. I use to watch this with my bros and sisters a couple of times a week. We couldn't get enough of it. The movie has a cheesy script but it has so many great one liners that you will never forget. I could probaly quote almost half of the movie to you word for word and get 90% of it pretty accurate.Jim Henson's Muppet Shop did a fantastic job with the Turtles. They didn't look stupid and the fighting scenes with them are terrific. All the costumes are good and Splinter is also real good. Thats the biggest rat I think thats ever been made that wasn't a CGI. It's cool seeing some old school costumes like this instead of CGI.This movie is really easy to get cheap. I found it on DVD for under $5. It doesn't have any extras which really stinks. I hope they decide one day to put this on a special edition DVD.If you want to give your kids a great family movie you wil have no problems with then buy this now.

27669,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0780607287,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","You've got to give Steve Barron credit: any other director might've taken the live-action version of Kevin Eastman's and Peter Laird's creations and produced something more akin to the animated, kid-friendly television show that dominated Saturday morning cartoons for years. Not that this film doesn't have an all-age appeal, but who remembers the original comic book, which was far more gritty and mature than what public television might've allowed? Granted, it's hard to sell the idea of four anthromorphic, ninjutsu-practicing, pizza-loving reptiles to begin with, but once the magic of Jim Henson sets in, a rather simplistic storyline becomes a most refreshing display of kung fu, comedy, and rubber suits that goes beyond expectations.These rubber suits are, of course what sells the movie. Create a costume of a 6-foot turtle that will look good in casual circumstances as well as in stylized combat, and you're close to getting yourself a winner. Master puppetry, coupled with fantastic athletic displays and individual voice-acting cements the four brothers (Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatella) as completely believable characters, immersed in an underground (and, eventually, street-top) battle with a villian - the armoured Shredder - whose spectacle is kept revered throughout the film by an unfaltering darkness to his character, highlighted by real-life crimes of child recruitment. Insert Judith Hoag into her tailor-made role of the reporter, April O'Neil, and wiley Elias Koteas into the character of suave streetfighter Casey Jones, and both of their abilities to react believably to people in costumes, and you've got yourself a winner.Well, maybe not yet. Though one can't expect much out of an action film when it comes to storylines, ""Turtles"" pulls it off by filling the fast-paced, quick-evented timeline with enough personality to make up for the relative speedy plot, which includes abduction, ambush, capture, retreat, reconciliation, emotional unearthing, return, battle-battle, and victory - all within 90 minutes. While I would have enjoyed certain aspects of the story (mainly, the time of the story spent between scenes) to be elaborated on more than they were, you can only praise the film for managing to plausibly tell the entire storyline of the original comic in the time that it did, by giving necessary focus on the multi-dimensional proportions of key scenes (ex: the reprieve at the farm, the Shredder's corraling of his recruits). In conclusion, the film pulls off the storytelling as well as and maybe even better than most other action films, securely a good mark in the field, but keeping it from being perfect (maybe if the film had been 30 minutes longer...).By keeping everything in context with the original publication, and by throwing in just the right amount of quirky humor, the film achieves most of its potential. A $13 million budget and collaboration with Jim Henson pay off by producing a cult film which sequels have yet to top (as well as a worldwide profit of about $200 million), and which cinematic history has yet to render obsolete.For fans of the franchise, this film is an absolute must-buy. Casuals viewers who find nothing wrong with talking, butt-kicking turtles and nifty kung-fu should likewise find no fault in this film. It's one of the few features that makes up for its shortcomings (the few that there are) with sheer fun and enjoyment.

27670,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,0780607287,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) of 1990 is a fun time-waster that has a good mix of fun comedy and banter and good action.  It takes an insane premise and has fun with it and somehow makes it work.  TMNT is a big franchise.  It started out as a comic book series but was later turned into a children&#8217;s cartoon series in the late 80s.  Due to the major success of the cartoon this movie was made.  Now I did not grow-up with the 80s cartoon or this film like many people.  What got me into the Ninja Turtles was another cartoon series about them made in 2003.  That, in my opinion, is my favorite incarnation of these characters.  However, this movie is my second favorite incarnation.The plot is quite simple.  Due to a mysterious crime gang known as The Foot headed by the main villain, The Shredder (David McCharen), crime has risen drastically in New York.  The Foot has also brainwashed kids who society has rejected and are training them to be their warriors.  One of these kids is a boy named Dan.  The city, including the police, is doing little to stop this.  However, a reporter named April O&#8217;Neil (Judith Hoag) is determined to bring them to light.  When she is attacked by The Foot she is then saved by four mutant turtles: Leonardo (Brian Tochi), Raphael, Donatello (Corey Feldman), and Michelangelo (Robbie Rist) along with their master Splinter (Kevin Clash).  Splinter is then taken by The Foot.  April and the turtles then must defeat The Shredder and The Foot to save Splinter.  They are also accompanied by a local vigilante named Casey Jones (Elias Koteas).The film has many things going in its favor.  The suits for the turtles look great.  For a live action TMNT movie you are not going to get much better looking turtles than these.  The film does a decent job at balancing the humor with the action and drama scenes.  This film is not like the 80s cartoon.  It has many humorous and lighthearted scenes, but it is more of an action film with some heavy stuff in it.  The action scenes are well done for the most part.  The characters do have good chemistry with each other and there is some good banter between them.However, the film does have its share of problems with are considerable.  Some of the turtles are either underused or are out of characters.  Michelangelo and Raphael are in character and get some good moments.  However Leonardo I feel is fairly underused.  That is a problem because he is supposed to be the leader of the turtles.  Donatello is very out of character in this film.  In most incarnations Donatello is the smart and scientific one.  In this film he is just a carbon copy of Michelangelo.  Corey Feldman was just not a good choice for the role.  He is a good actor but he is not Donatello.  I cannot see Feldman playing a scientist.  Another issue is with Raphael.  He is setup in the first half as central character, but lost his importance in the second half.  The film never follows up on what they setup with him at the start.I also feel they could have elaborated more on Casey.  We do not know his backstory or even why he decided to help the turtles.  I also think him and Raphael needed more scenes together.  In the comics and the 2003 cartoon that I like Raphael and Casey are best buddies.  However that is not really elaborated on here.Another problem is the Shredder himself.  I saw the 2003 cartoon first so I am a bit biased.  However, compared to the Shredder in that show this one was very underwhelming.  At least he is not a joke like in the 80s cartoon, but I still do not care for this version.  Even his backstory was quite lame and clich&eacute;d in my opinion.  I also do not like the way he was defeated.  I found it quite anti-climactic and funny when I was not supposed to.Overall, TMNT is a fun film for the family.  It has drama, action, comedy, fun, and heart.  It has fun characters who work off each other well.  It has some good action and some good laughs.  However, some of the characters could have been developed and utilized better.  The villain is lame as well as how they beat him.

27673,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,0780607287,Negative Comments,"[2, 3]","This movie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, should go down in history as one of the truly grandest achievements in this epoch of human civilization. This is about as close to perfection as can be reached when telling a story about turtles.Wanna know how to make a movie? THIS is how you make a movie. Specifically a movie of the comic book/superhero genre. Let me explain exactly why this works, and exactly why the following movies in this genre fails.--Failures:Transformers//Spider-Man 3//Superman Returns//Elektra//The Punisher//The Crow// Star Wars Episodes 1-3All horrible movies. There's more to this list but I'm gonna limit it to these since I've written reviews on most of them, and my opinions are already explained.Wanna know what all those other movies have in common? They share one or both of the following traits: they either 1) cater too much to kids, or 2) lack characters with realistic emotions.Trying to make a comic book/superhero movie that's catered to kids is synonymous with making it for MORONS. You go out of your way to cater it to simple minds, and you have a simple, moronic movie lacking all the fundamentals on what constitutes a STORY with characters. It means that all bets are off, and you're no longer carefully crafting art. Any semblance of our reality is out the door, and all you're left with on screen are empty entities moving around, making sounds, and doing actions arbitrarily (e.g. every movie I named above, and unfortunately the two sequels to this movie).NINJA TURTLES part 1 is a movie that can be enjoyed by kids, but they didn't completely dumb it down and insult their intelligence, that's why even watching it now I can enjoy it. If someone described a movie to you as being dark, and featuring complex characters, a movie with talking turtles may not be the first guess. The turtles may as well not even been turtles, this could've been a movie about four human brothers, and it would've worked the same way because of the great characterization. That's how you know a movie is good, when it doesn't rely on its ""gimmick"" to get by.3 points that jump out at me:--Splinter. I'm in complete absolute amazement at how UNCHEESY he was. The most amazing thing about his character were his LINES. I mean, this dude says some of the most profound things I've ever heard in my life, let alone in a movie, LET ALONE from a disheveled, talking rat puppet. Everything he said had such weight and substance. He was not stereotyped as some elderly martial arts master with trite, clich&eacute; ""wise man"" phrases. This was truly an endearing character.--Raphael. Look at the list of movies that I wrote up top. Combine all the atoms that make up each individual character from those movies, and they still wouldn't hold a candle to the weight and complexity that just a single molecule that Raphael carries. End of story.--The rooftop fight. Remember the part where Shredder has Leo on the ground, and tells Donny, Raph, and Mikey to throw away their weapons? If you've read any of my other rants, you'd know that a big thing for me is for characters to react realistically in situations. This scene here epitomizes what I mean. After Shredder tells them to throw their weapons away, they specifically had Raph ponder it for a quick second, then begrudgingly throw his weapon away with a grunt, followed by Mikey (who also grunts, a subtle touch) and Donny. This perfectly shows the dynamics of their relationship to each other at work here, because in this type of situation you would hesitate and wait to see what your leader does. It's just like if you and two co-workers are doing something, and then a CEO type person who you've never seen before walks in and makes a comment/questions you three, most times you would let the default leader among you (whether that assignment is subjective due to personality type, or more tangible, such as job position) do the talking for you. And that's what happened here. Mikey and Donny had no clue whether to surrender their weapons or not, their leader and brother is on the ground, about to get killed, so they had to wait to see what their other older brother would do, and then follow suit. This was a great example of great writing, and I love the subtle touch of having Mikey copy Raph's grunt, just like a younger brother would do.Action movies of today can learn from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. If you have good characters, the story almost doesn't matter, as it pretty much writes itself. All the viewer cares about at this point is to see if the characters all make it out ok. There's no need to concoct some over the top plot line as a means of being interesting or original, if we don't care about your characters, we couldn't care less on where the story takes these

Because of the contact with the ooze, Splinter and the four turtles became mutants. Naming them after Renaissance artists, Leonardo (David Forman), Raphael (Josh Pais), Michaelangelo (Michelan Sisti), and Donatello (Leif Tilden), Splinter teaches them the ancient secret art of fighting. When the mysterious evil Shredder James Saito organizes the Foot Clan formed of young teenagers, causing the city to be in uproar because of vandalism. With the help of reporter April O'Neil (Judith Hoag) and former athlete Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to save the day!The movie has an interesting story-line if not extremely cheesy and corny but hey, that's how the original cartoons were! In fact, I would have found the movie unlikable if it hadn't contained some of the cartoon aspects of the original series. Also a lot of interesting facts are revealed like how Splinter's past is related to Shredder and the beginnings of the turtles.Comparing the movie to the series, I was a bit surprised to find that movie usually centers on the character of Raphael. His character is a bit different from the series, a bit more hot-tempered, impatient, and more of a loner. Leonardo is still the leader, Donatello doesn't get much chance to work with gadgets and computers, and Michaelangelo... well... he's still his usual likable self! April O'Neal is also working for Channel 3 news instead of Channel 6 News. The adding of Elias Koteas as Casey Jones was an interesting thread to insert for he was a fun and likable guy.The martial arts and fighting were well choreographed and was enjoyable to watch. I especially liked the fight at April's place, the end fight with the Foot, and the last fight with Shredder. The movie is also sprinkled from beginning to end with funny parts, quotable lines, and humor. Jim Henson should also get credit for doing an incredible job with the turtles and Splinter.To sum of the movie, whether you are or aren't a turtles fan, I highly recommend this movie! Lots of fun and great entertainment, it's terrific for the family. The movie is rated PG because of some language, the fighting, and since it has some dark moments. I also recommend the next two ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movies. The second one, ""The Secret of the Ooze"" is my personal favorite of the three.",5,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - The Movie!,1031443200,"09 8, 2002",2002,2913,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'cartoons', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'have', 'lot', 'episodes', 'tape', 'love', 'still', 'watch', 'had', 'heard', 'were', 'three', 'non-animation', 'movies', 'out', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'compelled', 'see', 'other', 'day', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'decided', 'rent', 'three', 'what', 'surprise', 'got', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'film', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'loved', 'watching', '15', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'rat', 'named', 'Splinter', 'Kevin', 'Clash', 'found', 'four', 'baby', 'turtles', 'puddle', 'ooze', 'sewers', 'contact', 'ooze', 'Splinter', 'four', 'turtles', 'became', 'mutants', 'Naming', 'Renaissance', 'artists', 'Leonardo', 'David', 'Forman', 'Raphael', 'Josh', 'Pais', 'Michaelangelo', 'Michelan', 'Sisti', 'Donatello', 'Leif', 'Tilden', 'Splinter', 'ancient', 'secret', 'art', 'fighting', 'When', 'mysterious', 'evil', 'Shredder', 'James', 'Saito', 'Foot', 'Clan', 'formed', 'young', 'teenagers', 'causing', 'city', 'be', 'uproar', 'vandalism', 'help', 'reporter', 'April', ""O'Neil"", 'Judith', 'Hoag', 'former', 'athlete', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'up', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'save', 'day', 'movie', 'interesting', 'story-line', 'not', 'extremely', 'cheesy', 'corny', 'hey', 'how', 'original', 'cartoons', 'were', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'movie', 'unlikable', 'had', ""n't"", 'contained', 'cartoon', 'aspects', 'original', 'series', 'Also', 'lot', 'interesting', 'facts', 'are', 'revealed', 'how', 'Splinter', 'past', 'related', 'Shredder', 'beginnings', 'turtles.Comparing', 'movie', 'series', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'find', 'movie', 'usually', 'centers', 'character', 'Raphael', 'character', 'bit', 'different', 'series', 'bit', 'more', 'hot-tempered', 'impatient', 'more', 'loner', 'Leonardo', 'still', 'leader', 'Donatello', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'chance', 'work', 'gadgets', 'computers', 'Michaelangelo', 'well', 'still', 'usual', 'likable', 'self', 'April', ""O'Neal"", 'also', 'working', 'Channel', '3', 'news', 'instead', 'Channel', '6', 'News', 'adding', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'was', 'interesting', 'thread', 'insert', 'was', 'fun', 'likable', 'guy.The', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighting', 'were', 'well', 'choreographed', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'especially', 'liked', 'fight', 'April', 'place', 'end', 'fight', 'Foot', 'last', 'fight', 'Shredder', 'movie', 'also', 'sprinkled', 'beginning', 'end', 'funny', 'parts', 'quotable', 'lines', 'humor', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'should', 'also', 'get', 'credit', 'doing', 'incredible', 'job', 'turtles', 'Splinter.To', 'sum', 'movie', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'turtles', 'fan', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Lots', 'fun', 'great', 'entertainment', 'terrific', 'family', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'language', 'fighting', 'dark', 'moments', 'also', 'recommend', 'next', 'two', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'movies', 'second', 'one', 'Secret', 'Ooze', 'personal', 'favorite', 'three']",N/A

Lame to many now, but then it was great before Power rangers infested the TV and then Pokemon controlling our kids into some Poke-cult.  Well this movie was the last of the rough PG movies.  That was before the  parent groups got in the way with how extreme things get.  This movie came  out in a beautiful time when PG movies were worth something.  This movie  has well choreographed martial arts sequences, pretty funny as the young  ninjas characters are, and it had issues.  The type of issues that kids and  parents share from generation to generation, unfortunately at the time  parent groups focused their attention more on the violence. I am not saying  that they are wrong.  It is a rough violent movie, but I did not see heavy  ""actual"" fighting, any blood.  Blood as in oozing liquid.  There was a  death though (not truly as the next movie proved), and a couple in a memory  so I understand that part, but in Bambi they shot Bambi's mother.  Anyway,  this movie has no ""don't do this kid, cause it is bad for you"" or ""you evil  villain, you will never get away with this.""  This is not like that at  all.Ninja Turtles used their trained skills and street smarts to survive  and thrive, instead of using machines and alien given powers, or pokedecks.  The four turtles were raised and trained by their master, who is more like  a father to them, Splinter.  Past meets present, where a ninja clan that  used to terrorize Japan `back in the day' has returned to the streets of  New York.  The turtles do not go out stopping this ninja clan, the clan  goes after them first.  The ninja clan strikes hard and does lost of  physical and emotional damage to the mutant family and then, things get  personal.This movie is good the way it is, but if it was revised in a  PG-13 way, a little darker, serious fight scenes mixed with Jackie Chan  like fight scenes, some up beat music, then we would have a neat movie for  sure.  This movie is good as it is.

While some of the elements of the movie was borrowed from the show though the movie premise followed the original comics that was released in 1984.

MovieCDs are CD-ROMs of movies that can be played on your computer. They used to be sold at computer stores.) Yes, I like this movie. Someday I will probably get the DVD. I do have a few of the toys.Most of my comics are in storage so forgive me for a few minor errors on issue numbers and such. I started reading the original Mirage comics around #16 when the guest artists were just starting to become active. I think I stuck with it to the end. I have the colorized volumes that contained #1-12. (The original comics were black & white.) I also have a few issues of the newer, somewhat weird Ninja Turtles published by Image. I never read any of the Archie issues. I also watched the TV series during the first season.This movie is largely an adaptation of plot elements from an actual story in the original comics - with the order of events flipped around a bit. The fight with Shedder on the rooftop was actually from the first issue (or story if I'm wrong about the issue #) Other plot elements come from around #8-12. The Shedder was not the primary villian in the Mirage comics. He only appeared in a few issues.In the original comics, April was the lab assistant for an evil scientist named Baxter Stockman. She wasn't a news reporter. The Turtles actually met her while rescuing her from Stockman's inventions. In this movie, they met her in a totally different way. For the kids, April is a news reporter.Except for a couple of issues by guest artists, the original Turtles never ate pizza.Overall, this movie is loyal to the essence of the original Ninja Turtle comics with some elements from the children's version mixed in. This is the only movie in the series to do that. It is also the darkest of the movies. The others are strictly for the kids. However, I do enjoy some elements of the third movie, but it's still more of a children's movie. I hate the second one.I think this was the next to last movie Jim Henson did work on.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: the Movie. America's Favorite green teens are brought to life by Jim Henson's creature shop. From the comic book and the popular tv show comes the movie adaptation about four turtles who from a ooze substance evolved in walking talking human like reptiles, given renisance artist names by their master who discovered when they were normal turtles, Splinter,a rat who envolved in size and speaking too. They live in a New York sewer den and they meet and befriend Newsreporter April O'Neal. When an Ninja organization called the Foot lead by the turtle's archenemy The Shredder, finds out about the turtles and kidnapps Splinter,The fighting foursome and their new friend Casey Jones, a former hockey player, must battle the Foot,save splinter and defeat the Shredder. One of the best movies of the 90s and a great movie to start off the 1990s,high kicking fun,action packed,funny,terrific entertainment.One Shell of a time,The Turtles still rule,these boys truly are radical reptiles. If you enjoyed the tv show as a kid like I did, see their blockbuster movie, if you haven't or If you saw the Movie, then see the Sequel, The Secret of the Ooze. The third one not so good, I don't recommend it. I strongly recommend this awsome movie. Bring home the green teens and anyone who tells you the turtles suck give SHELL!

What has always struck me most about this film is how incredibly dark and violent it was for a PG movie geared towards children. The best way to describe this movie and it's lame watered down sequels, is well, think of Batman and it's sequels. You've got the first two Batman movies directed by Tim Burton. Both were very dark and serious movies for what they were based on(a guy flying around the city dressed as a bat), that came across quite well with adults and in turn were a huge a success. Then you have the Hollywoody sequels designed for 8 year old kids, most notably ""Batman and Robin""(i'll admit ""batman forever"" was still pretty good,  mostly because of jim carrey's performance). The first Ninja Turtle movie is very dark and dramatized with a surprising amount of character depth. The reason for this I believe is because this movie is based on the true origin of the Ninja Turtles, a comic book, which in turn was designed for young adults, not kids. The sequels on the other hand seem to mimic the morning cartoon show that's for 5-10 year olds. I've watched this movie recently and I find it to be a better film than when I first saw it in the theatre. Which is strange because I'm 10 years older now, which further proves my point that it's strangely good for adults. The music, dark production, the fantastic costumes, and drama are really well done, despite what some ignorant critics may say. I assure you this is a movie that can be enjoyed by people over the age of 13. I encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to at least go rent it. I know the fact that it's a movie about mutated turtles who live in the sewers, eat pizza and perform martial arts seems incredibly stupid and in concept it is. But the surprisingly serious and dark tone of the film and how well the whole thing was made really does it make it an enjoyable movie, even for adults. Just watch it with an open mind and you might find yourself actually liking it. And if you do like it and decide you wanna see the sequels as a result of that, DON'T! The second movie, despite trying to still appeal to adults, falls flat on it's butt for the most part. It just couldn't help but succumb to Hollywood's desire to water down something good and appeal to younger age groups. The film is somewhat decent at best. The turtles do a rap with Vanilla Ice in it for gods sake!!! Need I say more? And don't even get me started on the third film. What a piece of garbage that is.So I dare anyone who hasn't seen the movie, regardless of your age, to go rent it and watch the entire thing with an open mind.",4,Very underrated comic book based movie.,997747200,"08 14, 2001",2001,2698,"['What', 'interesting', 'film', 'even', 'day', ""'m"", 'happy', 'see', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'What', 'always', 'struck', 'most', 'film', 'how', 'incredibly', 'dark', 'violent', 'was', 'PG', 'movie', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'movie', 'lame', 'watered', 'down', 'sequels', 'well', 'think', 'Batman', 'sequels', ""'ve"", 'got', 'first', 'two', 'Batman', 'movies', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'were', 'very', 'dark', 'serious', 'movies', 'what', 'were', 'based', 'guy', 'flying', 'city', 'dressed', 'bat', 'came', 'quite', 'well', 'adults', 'turn', 'were', 'huge', 'success', 'Then', 'have', 'Hollywoody', 'sequels', 'designed', '8', 'year', 'old', 'kids', 'most', 'notably', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'i', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'batman', 'forever', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'mostly', 'jim', 'carrey', 'performance', 'first', 'Ninja', 'Turtle', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'dramatized', 'surprising', 'amount', 'character', 'depth', 'reason', 'believe', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'origin', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'comic', 'book', 'turn', 'was', 'designed', 'young', 'adults', 'not', 'kids', 'sequels', 'other', 'hand', 'seem', 'mimic', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'show', '5-10', 'year', 'olds', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'recently', 'find', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'theatre', 'Which', 'strange', ""'m"", '10', 'years', 'older', 'now', 'further', 'proves', 'point', 'strangely', 'good', 'adults', 'music', 'dark', 'production', 'fantastic', 'costumes', 'drama', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'what', 'ignorant', 'critics', 'may', 'say', 'assure', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'age', '13', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'least', 'go', 'rent', 'know', 'fact', 'movie', 'mutated', 'turtles', 'who', 'live', 'sewers', 'eat', 'pizza', 'perform', 'martial', 'arts', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'concept', 'surprisingly', 'serious', 'dark', 'tone', 'film', 'how', 'well', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'made', 'really', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'even', 'adults', 'Just', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'might', 'find', 'actually', 'liking', 'do', 'decide', 'wan', 'see', 'sequels', 'result', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'second', 'movie', 'trying', 'still', 'appeal', 'adults', 'flat', 'butt', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'succumb', 'Hollywood', 'desire', 'water', 'down', 'something', 'good', 'appeal', 'younger', 'age', 'groups', 'film', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'best', 'turtles', 'do', 'rap', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'gods', 'sake', 'Need', 'say', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'third', 'film', 'What', 'piece', 'garbage', 'is.So', 'dare', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'regardless', 'age', 'go', 'rent', 'watch', 'entire', 'thing', 'open', 'mind']",N/A

I watched the saturday morning cartoon that aired on CBS, my brother and I played the TMNT video games on NES  (Remember the very first one? I could play it 'til my thumbs bleed!) and Super Nintendo, my brother and I collected the TMNT action figures, and watched our VHS copies of the first two TMNT films so many times, that they wore out.ANYWAY, the film's plot: One day, four turtles named Leonardo, Donnatello, Michaelangelo, and Raphael, and their soon-to-be mentor, a rat named Splinter come in contact with ""the ooze"", and they are mutated into humanoids who can walk upright and talk! Splinter becomes their mentor and guardian, and teaches them all he knows about the Ninjitsu fighting style. The turtles decide to fight crime in New York City with their new skills. Soon Splinter is kidnapped by his former master and arch nemesis, an evil man who wants to control the world, known as Shredder, so it's up to the turtles to defeat him and rescue Splinter!This film definitely holds up well today, considering that it's a late 80's film. If you were a fan of TMNT during the late 80's/early 90's, check this out if you haven't already!
