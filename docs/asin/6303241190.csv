365521,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303241190,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","The Private Life of Henry VIII, 1932 filmHis first wife was Catherine of Aragon (Caterina Fidele). Next came Anne Boleyn (a thousand days). Girls rework the initials on the royal bedding, Jane Seymour is number three. People gather to watch a public execution. A long sword is sharpened. We hear about the arrangements. Henry wants to increase the size of the navy as a defense against foreigners, but that will take more money. A cannon shot signals the start of the wedding. Will there be a son? Henry enjoys falconry. ""It's a boy!"" Jane died. Who will be the next wife? The King dines with his courtiers. They did not use forks or knives then.A lady sings for the King. ""Katherine Howard."" Henry makes a joke and the court laughs. The Duchess of Cleves is mentioned. What does she look like? Her likeness is painted. The King is guarded day and night. No secrets there. Anne of Cleves has crossed the channel, the King is called. They meet, Anne is under the weather. But the marriage must go on or it means war. Henry will do his duty for England. [This is played for laughs.] Anne knows how to play her cards. There is a deal made. ""Good night."" Does the well run dry? People gossip about their ruler. Katherine Howard is number five.The royal couple is entertained by fighting birds. Next a wrestling match. Henry shows his skills. The court cheers (as if their place depends on it). Is Henry aging? Thomas Culpeper gets a written note from Katherine. We see Henry is short of breath. Henry talks about diplomatic efforts in Europe. [Did things change?] One lady tells about the meeting. Who will tell the King? Archbishop Cranmer? The messenger with bad news isn't welcomed. The faces of the Privy Council tell the bad news. Henry grieves. There is another public execution. Anne of Cleves visits a graying Henry to suggest Katherine Parr. She is a match for Henry, and watches over him. Henry eats his fill, and makes a humorous observation about his wife and fate.This historical drama entertains. Note the references that are still topical. This drama avoids the religious conflicts of that era, and the wars in Europe. Henry's illness is mentioned. His children marked the end of the Tudor line. The monarchy was passed to the Scottish Stewarts. Britain had many dynasties since 1066, few of them English. The Tudors were of Welsh origins (the original Britons). The book ""Royal Babylon tells about the royal aristocracies of Europe, now mostly defunct.

Their double-sawbuck price tag for unrestored films with no bonus features simply isn't justified. Best advice: preview any of their products via rental or library loan before purchasing.As for Alexander Korda's THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII, Charles Laughton's super-human thespian efforts cannot save what is a highly arbitrary and episodic script. Right at the outset Henry's first and most significant marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, is dismissed with a text scroll that describes her as ""a good woman"" whom he divorced and ""we won't deal with her here"" etc.The king's last wife, Catherine Parr is depicted as a loving caretaker of the Royal heirs, but once married she became quite the ""nag."" After one such session at story's end, Henry addresses the audience thus: ""Six wives, and the best of them's the worst."" Perhaps if we'd been allowed to see the first Cate, that ""best wife"" statement could never have applied to queen #6, thus, it's probably why Aragon was ignored altogether-- to make a final feeble joke possible.Elsa Lanchester's comically broad portrayal of the rather dull Anne of Cleves is a poorly chosen highlight of the story. Her predecessor, Jane Seymour is around only long enough to die offscreen in childbirth. Wife #2, Anne Boleyn's execution and the moments leading up to it get more coverage than the reason for her beheading, an issue never made clear.Robert Donat as cuckolder of kings, Thomas Culpepper has more screen time than three of Henry's wives. His affair with wife #5, Catherine Howard ends for her at the chopping block. With this second execution we see only a row of drummers.In the closing 20 minutes, Laughton's king ages in two blinks from a hale 50 year old to an elderly near-invalid who overeats whenever the final Mrs. Henry isn't looking. For reasons stated, what should've been a triumph for all involved is a failure that almost rises to the level of the very next Korda/Laughton collaboration, the unfinished epic,I, CLAUDIUS(1935).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.3) The Private Life of Henry VIII (UK-1933) - Charles Laughton/Robert Donat/Elsa Lanchester/Merle Oberon/Wendy Barrie/Binnie Barnes/Franklin Dyall (uncredited: Terry-Thomas)",3,"Anne Boleyn: ""I shall be 'Anne sans tte.'

Pfleeger,"[0, 1]","Alexander Korda's 1933 biopic The Private Life of Henry VIII has the distinction of being the first British film nominated for Best Picture. The film picked up the Best Actor Oscar for Charles Laughton for his portrayal of the king.The story follows the trials and tribulations of King Henry following the execution of his second wife Anne Boleyn for treasson so that he can marry Jane Seymour(Wendy Barrie). Following this marriage which ends when Seymour dies in childbirth. Henry engages in a politically motivated marriage to Anne of Cleves(Elsa Lanchester) which ends in divorce. Lanchester plays her part with relish and the wedding night card game is one of the highlights of the film. Henry's fifth marriage to Katherine Howard(Binnie Barnes)is the main focus of the film. Of all his marriages this is the one most hoped for by the King to succeed until  he finds out of her affair with a former lover, Thomas Culpeper(Robert Donat) which leads to her execution.The film while not always historically accurate is enjoyable to watch. I saw this on the Eclipse standard definition DVD as part of the Korda boxed set. The picture is quite good but there are some flaws in the sound that make thr dialogue difficult to hear at times but this poses no particular problem as it is quite easy to follow the action of the story. This film was a notable beginning for both Korda and his company London Films and it is well worth the effort to seek it out.

The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).

365526,ACFXXSSFH9CWO,6303241190,Dolwyddelan,"[0, 1]","Despite its age, this is remains a terrifically clever and entertaining picture, chronicling the marital woes of the most notorious of all English monarchs.  It is hard to imagine a better choice to play the Henry VIII than the great Charles Laughton.  Laughton *is* Henry, and his first appearance in the film is like seeing Hans Eworth's 1545 portrait come to life.Picking-up after the execution of Anne Boleyn, The Private Life of Henry VIII centres on his remaining four marriages, each offering its own unique heartbreaks (or inconveniences) for the king.  This is very much a black comedy, and quite literally rife with gallows humor.  The film generally glances past accounts of the king's tyranny and his execution of countless innocents (their deaths are either ignored or simply referenced humorously) in favor of his countless domestic woes.Having been made in the early 30s -- and prior to the censorship imposed by the Hayes Code -- there are a number of boudoir scenes (and the requisite jokes to accompany them) that never would have been allowed a few years later.  Particularly amusing is Henry's wedding night with Anne of Cleaves (played by Laughton's real life wife Elsa Lanchester), where his awkward attempt to explain the facts of life to his naive bride eventually settles into a game of cards.Admittedly the production quality is a bit dated.  Having been made when sound films were barely out of their embryonic stage, the style of the picture at times seems primitive and cumbersome.  However this is more than made up for by the witty script and immensely clever performances.  While not exactly a history lesson, The Private Life of Henry VIII still a very enjoyable and highly entertaining romp.",4,Still one of the best films dealing with an English monarch,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1725,"['age', 'terrifically', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'picture', 'chronicling', 'marital', 'woes', 'most', 'notorious', 'English', 'monarchs', 'hard', 'imagine', 'better', 'choice', 'play', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'great', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Laughton', '*is*', 'Henry', 'first', 'appearance', 'film', 'seeing', 'Hans', 'Eworth', '1545', 'portrait', 'come', 'life.Picking-up', 'execution', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Private', 'Life', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'remaining', 'four', 'marriages', 'offering', 'own', 'unique', 'heartbreaks', 'inconveniences', 'king', 'very', 'much', 'black', 'comedy', 'quite', 'literally', 'rife', 'gallows', 'humor', 'film', 'generally', 'past', 'accounts', 'king', 'tyranny', 'execution', 'countless', 'innocents', 'deaths', 'are', 'either', 'ignored', 'simply', 'referenced', 'humorously', 'favor', 'countless', 'domestic', 'woes.Having', 'been', 'made', 'early', '30s', 'prior', 'censorship', 'imposed', 'Hayes', 'Code', 'are', 'number', 'boudoir', 'scenes', 'requisite', 'jokes', 'accompany', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Particularly', 'amusing', 'Henry', 'wedding', 'night', 'Anne', 'Cleaves', 'played', 'Laughton', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'where', 'awkward', 'attempt', 'explain', 'facts', 'life', 'naive', 'bride', 'eventually', 'game', 'cards.Admittedly', 'production', 'quality', 'bit', 'dated', 'Having', 'been', 'made', 'when', 'sound', 'films', 'were', 'barely', 'embryonic', 'stage', 'style', 'picture', 'times', 'primitive', 'cumbersome', 'However', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'witty', 'script', 'immensely', 'clever', 'performances', 'not', 'exactly', 'history', 'lesson', 'Private', 'Life', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'romp']",N/A
365527,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6303241190,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 3]","Charles Laughton is arguably the most capable actor in Hollywood's golden era. His performances in films such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1936) and ""Witness for the Prosecution "" (1958) are peerless, and when you consider he received best actor nominations for both films, separated by more than 20 years, this by itself speaks volumes. While he won the best actor award for his portrayal in this 1933 film, the quality of his acting only improved with age, and what we see in ""Henry VIII"" is a young Laughton (he was 33) learning his trade.On tap for another delightful role is Laughton's wife, Elsa Lancaster. They appeared together in 4 previous English films, and they would continue to co-star throughout their lives (""Rembrandt"" in 1936, ""The Big Clock"" in 1948) culminating in ""Witness for the Prosecution"" which is perhaps their best pairing.Also on hand are Binnie Barnes ( a prolific actress who appeared in action adventure films like ""Diamond Jim"", ""The 3 Musketeers"", ""In Old California""), Merle Oberon in her film debut  (perhaps most famous for roles in ""The Scarlett Pimpernel"" in 1936 and ""Wuthering Heights"" in 1939), and Robert Donat. Donat is not well remembered today, but he was a major presence in such films as ""The 39 Steps"" (1935), ""The Citadel"" (1938) and ""Goodbye Mr Chips"" (1939) for which he won the best actor award.""Henry VIII"" was a big success (nominated for Best Picture) and became a launching platform for almost all the participants, none of whom had been headliners prior to its release.  It was the first foreign film every nominated for Best Picture. Alexander Korda produced and directed the film from his recently founded company, London Films, and put all his money into this film. Fortunately it succeeded. He worked with Laughton again in ""Rembrandt"" (1936) and went on to produce or direct several excellent films such as ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1940), ""Jungle Book"" (1942), ""The Third Man"" (1949), and ""Richard III"" (1955), although none of these would have the impact that ""Henry VIII"" had.  Korda was well known for his high quality production values, which are apparent in ""Henry VIII"" as well as his focus on personality (he also produced ""The Private life of Helen of Troy"", ""The Private Life of Don Juan""). For a time (1939 to 1945) Merle Oberon was married to Korda. Oberon was famous for her sexual exploits, and numbered among her lovers Leslie Howard, and David Niven.The film is known for being wildly inaccurate (e.g., Elsa Lancaster laments that Henry is a ""bluebeard"" but Henry's reign, 1509 to 1547, predates Bluebeard by more than 100 years). In some senses it is a black satire, a nose tweaking that the British are famous for. The film spawned ""The Public Life of Henry the Ninth"" (1935), the debut of Hammer Films, and ""Carrry on Henry"" (1971) from Sid James as part of the Carry On series.

While Charles Laughton does, indeed, give an excellent performance as Henry VIII, the film suffers from its screenplay, which chooses to focus on Henry's last five marriages, with emphasis on his fourth and probably least important marriage, that to Anne of Cleves. One has to wonder if her prominence in the film was due to the role being played by Elsa Lancaster, Laughton's wife at the time.The most important marriage, that to Katherine of Aragon, is dismissed as being of no interest. This is an amazing and absurd statement, given the fact that it was the dissolution of this marriage that was to act as the catalayst for the reformation that ultimately set England on the path to Protestantism and the establishment of the Church of England. As a historical drama, the film leaves a lot to be desired, as it suffers from superficial treatment.The film begins with the execution of Ann Boleyn, played by the lovely Merle Oberon, who, despite star billing, is only in the film for several minutes. The film then goes to the marriage to Jane Seymour, played by an actress with a thirties style hair bob. It is Jane who gives the King his heart's desire, a son and heir, before succumbing to death shortly after childbirth.The film then segues into the marriage to Anne of Cleves, which role is played with comedic abandon by Ms. Manchester. This is followed by Henry's marriage to Katherine Howard, a young wanton who cuckolds the king with Thomas Culpepper, one of the King's Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber. The role of the hapless Thomas Culpepper is played by screen great, Robert Donat. Katherine Howard, as did Anne Boleyn, ends up losing her head on the chopping block for her treasonous transgression. Henry's last wife, Katherine Parr, is merely depicted as a loving and caring woman, watching out for Henry in his dotage.Attention to period detail is hit or miss, and many of the female cast wander about the set with nineteen thirties style hair bobs, which serves to have a jarring effect. For a better and historically more accurate picture of the wives of King Henry VIII, one would do well to view the superlative BBC production, ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"", which is available on DVD and as a set of six video cassettes.",2,NOT FOR LOVERS OF HISTORICAL DRAMAS...,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2321,"['somewhat', 'disappointing', 'historical', 'drama', 'directed', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'indeed', 'give', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'film', 'suffers', 'screenplay', 'focus', 'Henry', 'last', 'five', 'marriages', 'emphasis', 'fourth', 'probably', 'least', 'important', 'marriage', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'One', 'wonder', 'prominence', 'film', 'was', 'due', 'role', 'being', 'played', 'Elsa', 'Lancaster', 'Laughton', 'wife', 'time.The', 'most', 'important', 'marriage', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'dismissed', 'being', 'interest', 'amazing', 'absurd', 'statement', 'given', 'fact', 'was', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'was', 'act', 'catalayst', 'reformation', 'ultimately', 'set', 'England', 'path', 'Protestantism', 'establishment', 'Church', 'England', 'historical', 'drama', 'film', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'superficial', 'treatment.The', 'film', 'execution', 'Ann', 'Boleyn', 'played', 'lovely', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'who', 'star', 'billing', 'only', 'film', 'several', 'minutes', 'film', 'then', 'marriage', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'played', 'actress', 'thirties', 'style', 'hair', 'bob', 'Jane', 'who', 'King', 'heart', 'desire', 'son', 'heir', 'succumbing', 'death', 'shortly', 'childbirth.The', 'film', 'then', 'marriage', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'role', 'played', 'comedic', 'abandon', 'Ms.', 'Manchester', 'followed', 'Henry', 'marriage', 'Katherine', 'Howard', 'young', 'wanton', 'who', 'king', 'Thomas', 'Culpepper', 'one', 'King', 'Gentlemen', 'Privy', 'Chamber', 'role', 'hapless', 'Thomas', 'Culpepper', 'played', 'screen', 'great', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'Katherine', 'Howard', 'did', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'up', 'losing', 'head', 'chopping', 'block', 'treasonous', 'transgression', 'Henry', 'last', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'Parr', 'merely', 'depicted', 'loving', 'caring', 'woman', 'watching', 'out', 'Henry', 'dotage.Attention', 'period', 'detail', 'hit', 'miss', 'many', 'female', 'cast', 'wander', 'set', 'nineteen', 'thirties', 'style', 'hair', 'bobs', 'have', 'jarring', 'effect', 'better', 'historically', 'more', 'accurate', 'picture', 'wives', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'view', 'superlative', 'BBC', 'production', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'available', 'DVD', 'set', 'six', 'video', 'cassettes']",N/A

Londoner's have already gathered in the Tower's courtyard to get a good view.  Meanwhile, Henry waits impatiently for the signal that the deed is done;  in another chamber, his third wife-to-be, Jane Seymour, prepares for her wedding.  Jane is in her twenties and Henry is almost 45.  In the 11 years left him, he will have 3 more wives. . . .While this movie could have had some very gruesome scenes, none are shown;  for example, when the moment of Anne's execution comes, it is simply skipped, followed by a bit of ironic humor of a woman remarking to her husband about how much she admired Anne's frock!There are many comic moments;  the best comic sequence comes when his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, arrives - she practices being ugly and proves herself equal to Henry in wit in negotiating an amicable divorce.  Neither one wished to be married to each other - Henry had already dallied with his future fifth wife, Katherine Howard, and Anne of Cleves had her heart set on Peynell.Overall:  It is an interesting movie, but you get only a cursory look at this complex and significant historical figure.Media: DVD-R - 2011.

In THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII, director Alexander Korda takes more than a few liberties as he presents King Henry VIII as a ruler whose primary focus in life was to stuff his mouth as full of chicken as possible.  That he was a king whose official responsibility was to protect and rule England is barely mentioned.  As far as Henry's daily activities go, Charles Laughton as Henry, goes through them with a gustatory excess that matches his roly-poly physique.  So all consuming is Henry's desire to stuff his face that he barely has time for lechery, which in any case is limited to choosing the next queen.  His wives pass by in a blur.  Merle Oberon as Anne Boleyn evokes a strong note of sympathy as her trip to the block is unwarranted.  His other wives fall victim to their own personal shortcomings that both Korda and Laughton smooth over to such an extent that we can almost hear him think: ""Serves them right.""  Laughton dominates the film not just with his rotundness but with his uncanny ability to cause his subjects to act as human sounding boards that reflect his most volatile nature.  When he laughs at dinner, the entire castle takes note and uproarious shouts of gaiety resound throughout.  When he is in one of his dark moods, no one dares hardly to breathe.  But Laughton alone does not make this a memorable film.  Elsa Lanchester as Anne, marries him unwillingly, and spends her wedding night making herself as unappealing as possible.  Their scene of the upcoming divorce, the details of which are ironed out on their wedding night, is full of crackling good humor.  We learn little of what motivates Henry other than his gluttony, but perhaps that is the point.  Henry is a man who under any other situation would have been quite ordinary in all respects but as King Henry, his foibles have become the stuff of legend.",4,Henry as Glutton,1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,2004,"['monarch', 'who', 'had', 'six', 'wives', 'two', 'whom', 'beheaded', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'gotten', 'pass', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'more', 'sinned', 'sinning', 'THE', 'PRIVATE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'HENRY', 'VIII', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'more', 'few', 'liberties', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'ruler', 'primary', 'focus', 'life', 'was', 'stuff', 'mouth', 'full', 'chicken', 'possible', 'was', 'king', 'official', 'responsibility', 'was', 'protect', 'rule', 'England', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'As', 'far', 'Henry', 'daily', 'activities', 'go', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Henry', 'gustatory', 'excess', 'roly-poly', 'physique', 'consuming', 'Henry', 'desire', 'stuff', 'face', 'barely', 'time', 'lechery', 'case', 'limited', 'choosing', 'next', 'queen', 'wives', 'pass', 'blur', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'strong', 'note', 'sympathy', 'trip', 'block', 'unwarranted', 'other', 'wives', 'fall', 'victim', 'own', 'personal', 'shortcomings', 'Korda', 'Laughton', 'such', 'extent', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'think', 'right', 'Laughton', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'rotundness', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'cause', 'subjects', 'act', 'human', 'sounding', 'boards', 'reflect', 'most', 'volatile', 'nature', 'When', 'dinner', 'entire', 'castle', 'note', 'uproarious', 'shouts', 'gaiety', 'resound', 'When', 'one', 'dark', 'moods', 'one', 'hardly', 'breathe', 'Laughton', 'alone', 'not', 'make', 'memorable', 'film', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'Anne', 'unwillingly', 'wedding', 'night', 'making', 'as', 'unappealing', 'possible', 'scene', 'upcoming', 'divorce', 'details', 'are', 'ironed', 'out', 'wedding', 'night', 'full', 'crackling', 'good', 'humor', 'learn', 'little', 'what', 'Henry', 'other', 'gluttony', 'perhaps', 'point', 'Henry', 'man', 'who', 'other', 'situation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'ordinary', 'respects', 'King', 'Henry', 'foibles', 'have', 'become', 'stuff', 'legend']",N/A

Of six wives : two had their heads chopped off, one died after child birth and two were divorced.He slept around his court, but his wives lost their heads for the same behavior.",4,Lengdary historical classic,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,515,"['As', 'good', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'making', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'seemcomical', 'fact', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'minimal', 'leader', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'England', 'ever', 'had.This', 'king', 'got', 'away', 'killing', 'divorcing', 'wiveson', 'new', 'scale', 'English', 'history.Can', 'comedy', 'be', 'used', 'excuse', 'man', 'being', 'worse', 'beast', 'women', 'six', 'wives', 'two', 'had', 'heads', 'chopped', 'off', 'one', 'died', 'child', 'birth', 'two', 'were', 'divorced.He', 'slept', 'court', 'wives', 'lost', 'heads', 'same', 'behavior']",N/A

It has several big stars from 1933; Charles Laughton as a perfect Henry VIII, Merle Oberon as Anne Boleyn, Elsa Lanchester as Anne of Cleves and Robert Donat as Thomas Culpeper. A young Elsa Lanchester plays perhaps the most interesting character, besides, except of course Charles Laughton; she shows the spirit of one of Henry's wives.If you are looking for a complete historical reenactment, this is not it. Even Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon is dismissed with a the words"" of no interest"" - enough to make a historian cringe. But it is an interesting look at the black and white films of early British filmmaking and Laughton's superb acting.  Unlike many of the films of this period, the background scenery is well done and outside shots of Hampton Court add interest. It has all the splendid innocence of films of the period, with 94 minutes of clear black and white film.As for history, there is no depth, instead it is a pleasure to watch as an example of 1930's moviemaking and superb acting by some classic stars.",3,Eclipse version of Henry,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,1139,"['review', '2009', 'release', 'Private', 'Life', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'eclispe', 'criterion', 'collection', 'several', 'big', 'stars', '1933', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'perfect', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'Thomas', 'Culpeper', 'A', 'young', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'course', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'spirit', 'one', 'Henry', 'wives.If', 'are', 'looking', 'complete', 'historical', 'reenactment', 'not', 'Even', 'Henry', 'first', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'dismissed', 'words', 'interest', 'enough', 'make', 'historian', 'cringe', 'interesting', 'look', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'early', 'British', 'filmmaking', 'Laughton', 'superb', 'acting', 'many', 'films', 'period', 'background', 'scenery', 'well', 'done', 'outside', 'shots', 'Hampton', 'Court', 'add', 'interest', 'splendid', 'innocence', 'films', 'period', '94', 'minutes', 'clear', 'black', 'white', 'film.As', 'history', 'depth', 'instead', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'example', '1930', 'moviemaking', 'superb', 'acting', 'classic', 'stars']",N/A
