364958,A1YNYT8F584IYV,630321956X,"MarvelousMarla ""MarvyM""","[21, 22]","This was an interesting little flick about a troubled teen who escapes with his feuding parents to Martha's vineyard for amini-vacation after he nearly burns down the house. ""The Inkwell"" is the Black section of Martha's Vineyard. Set in the '70s,this is a retro film that evokes a real sense of the period.Granted, this movie does have its weak points, but I thought the overall product was not bad. Larenz Tate has proven himselfto be a chameleon morphing from a psychopath killer in ""Menace to Society"" to this odd character and then later becomes asuave wordsmith in 1997's ""Love Jones."" He does well in this coming-of-age flick that explores a little shown facet of black life -- the upper middle class. Though the relatives who owned the house on the Vineyard seemed a little pretentious at first (Glynn Turman and Vanessa Bell Calloway), we see that they honestly love their family. Even the brother-in-laws with the conflicting political views (Republican Vs Black Panther) manage to make peace with each other in the end.Drew (Larenz Tate) really was a weird character, but at least the role was a departure from the black male stereotype of thecool thug. At least Matty Rich was not afraid to take a chance here with a different type of lead character. Jada Pinkett wasvery good here as the spoiled rich girl who wraps the poor, socially-inept Drew around her little finger. And although his role was minor, Morris Chestnut was a convincing (and foine!) philanderer.My one major complaint is with the mother daughter conflict. Although the two make up in the end, you never really knew whatthey were beefing about. That could have been fleshed out a little more, but I liked that this movie was about a family trying to reconnect with each other. And I also liked that the characters were not total stereotypes.

Its obvious that he has self-hatred issues(who else would refer to afros as tacky besides some self-hating Tom with lots of alabaster ""friends""). Glynn Turman's character(Spencer) never congratulated Drew for courting an older women. Spencer never knew anything about Drew or the older woman. Its kind of obvious that this prudish clown didnt see the movie or if he did he allowed his blinding hatred coerce him into writing an inaccurate review.The other two negative reviews are from sheer idiots simple and plain. Now that that is out of the way....The story: Drew has problems coping with his life after he accidently burns down his house. His mom(played by Suzzanne Douglas and Dad(Joe Morton)move with her sister and from then Drew's life changes.Larenz Tate is pretty good as the naive but likable Drew. Suzzanne Douglas is great as Drew's mother and Joe Morton is perfect as Drew's father Kenny. Glynn Turman is good also as the ignorant and arrogant Spencer Phillips. Duane Martin is just hilarious as Jr Phillips. And for me the silliness only made this movie more appealing.Its a shame that Matty Rich(the director) never had another movie after this one. But I understand all to well that any gifted black director that gives us positive images will not last in Follywood. There is no high demand for them and a lot us will only promote the black films that these childish schizophrenics promote. If you are over the age of thirty and you still allow these freaks to dictate to you what quality entertainment is then you should be ashamed of yourselves. The editorial reviews as well as the negative reviews for this movie are the reason why positive black movies will never get the love they need.
