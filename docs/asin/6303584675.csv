380529,A1LV6LMUHV3DNS,6303584675,"C. Bauer ""buccaneer""","[2, 3]","I am watching ""Jefferson In Paris"" and have just ordered a copy of the DVD.  I think we need to take another look at this glossed over and dismissed film.  When it came out originally in 1995 it was competing with the films of Merchant/Ivory's early 20th century period pieces and several Jane Austen books turned to film.  As a result, it did not fair well with critics or viewers.  Right now HBO gives it only 2 stars.  The accuracy of the film is breathtaking in scope and detail.  From the multiple variety of sets in street scenes, the opera, convents, churches, palaces, gardens and Jefferson's Paris home, to the costumes from the King and the Court to the lowliest peasant to the music and language or dialogue and the ornate and fascinating if arcane customs it is perfection.  Naturally like Powell and Pressburger's remake of the Scarlet Pimpernal filmed right after WW2 in the most gorgeous areas of France, Jefferson In Paris takes advantage of the country where this story takes place.  But it takes real talent to utilize one's surroundings and evoke all the aspects of a time that is now 200 years in the past.  I feel I am rereading Christopher Hibbert's treatment of the French Revolution but on film.  Recently Nick Nolte has been the subject of much negative publicity but I feel his portrayal of Thomas Jefferson is perfect.  I always have felt Jefferson was a brilliant but pedantic and boring old stick.  Nolte captures the contradictions of Jefferson and the plodding but self assured way he nievely moved through French society right before the revolution.  I am only sorry he did not get more credit for what was an excellent job of acting.  Greta Scacchi was as always in the 90's one of the most beautiful actresses.  And in this film, the mores and ways and surroundings and costumes of the 18th century suit her so well and so convincingly she could have stepped back in time to this place and have fit in seamlessly.  A Gainsborough like beauty.  In times like these when other films such as Downton Abbey are receiving cudos I feel are not warrented because I believe viewers want something brilliant and lush and gorgeous, I urge them to take another look at Jefferson In Paris.  It satisfies all the senses and is a story that would charm if not delight nearly all viewers.  The film does pay respect to Jefferson's children by one of the women he held as a slave in the United States and it does not gloss over this story.  But the central focus is bringing the viewer into Paris in a visceral and palpable way right before the French Revolution when everything was swept away in gore and violence, both the good and the bad.  Revisit this film especially if you are tired of the sex and brutality of many modern films and series.  And tired as I am of modern writers portraying history in fiction with little accuracy or respect.",5,Jefferson In Paris Revisited in 2012,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,2865,"['am', 'watching', 'Jefferson', 'Paris', 'have', 'just', 'ordered', 'copy', 'DVD', 'think', 'need', 'take', 'look', 'glossed', 'dismissed', 'film', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'originally', '1995', 'was', 'competing', 'films', 'Merchant/Ivory', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'period', 'pieces', 'several', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'books', 'turned', 'film', 'result', 'did', 'not', 'fair', 'well', 'critics', 'viewers', 'Right', 'now', 'HBO', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'accuracy', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'scope', 'detail', 'multiple', 'variety', 'sets', 'street', 'scenes', 'opera', 'convents', 'churches', 'palaces', 'gardens', 'Jefferson', 'Paris', 'home', 'costumes', 'King', 'Court', 'lowliest', 'peasant', 'music', 'language', 'dialogue', 'ornate', 'fascinating', 'arcane', 'customs', 'perfection', 'Naturally', 'Powell', 'Pressburger', 'remake', 'Scarlet', 'Pimpernal', 'filmed', 'right', 'WW2', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'areas', 'France', 'Jefferson', 'Paris', 'advantage', 'country', 'where', 'story', 'place', 'real', 'talent', 'utilize', 'one', 'surroundings', 'evoke', 'aspects', 'time', 'now', '200', 'years', 'past', 'feel', 'am', 'rereading', 'Christopher', 'Hibbert', 'treatment', 'French', 'Revolution', 'film', 'Recently', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'been', 'subject', 'much', 'negative', 'publicity', 'feel', 'portrayal', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'perfect', 'always', 'have', 'felt', 'Jefferson', 'was', 'brilliant', 'pedantic', 'boring', 'old', 'stick', 'Nolte', 'contradictions', 'Jefferson', 'plodding', 'self', 'assured', 'way', 'nievely', 'moved', 'French', 'society', 'right', 'revolution', 'am', 'only', 'sorry', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'more', 'credit', 'what', 'was', 'excellent', 'job', 'acting', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'was', 'always', '90', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'film', 'mores', 'ways', 'surroundings', 'costumes', '18th', 'century', 'suit', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'convincingly', 'could', 'have', 'stepped', 'back', 'time', 'place', 'have', 'fit', 'seamlessly', 'Gainsborough', 'beauty', 'times', 'when', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'are', 'receiving', 'cudos', 'feel', 'are', 'not', 'warrented', 'believe', 'viewers', 'want', 'something', 'brilliant', 'lush', 'gorgeous', 'urge', 'take', 'look', 'Jefferson', 'Paris', 'senses', 'story', 'would', 'charm', 'not', 'delight', 'nearly', 'viewers', 'film', 'pay', 'respect', 'Jefferson', 'children', 'one', 'women', 'held', 'slave', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'gloss', 'story', 'central', 'focus', 'bringing', 'viewer', 'Paris', 'visceral', 'palpable', 'way', 'right', 'French', 'Revolution', 'when', 'everything', 'was', 'swept', 'away', 'gore', 'violence', 'good', 'bad', 'Revisit', 'film', 'especially', 'are', 'tired', 'sex', 'brutality', 'many', 'modern', 'films', 'series', 'tired', 'am', 'modern', 'writers', 'portraying', 'history', 'fiction', 'little', 'accuracy', 'respect']",N/A

Middleton,"[8, 12]","Merchant and Ivory productions, whose first film appeared in 1957, has a reputation for lavish sets, beautiful cinematography and the ""period piece"" masters of the film industry. It is certainly true that they set a new benchmark in adapting literature to the screen with such films as The Golden Bowl and The Bostonians by the American master, Henry James. They have also produced a magnificent adaptation of E.M. Forrester's groundbreaking novel of a gay man living in England in the 19th century battling with his conscience, Maurice. The list goes on as they continue to make incredible films to present day.My favourite film by the famous duo would have to be Surviving Picasso, about the numerous women who would self-destruct after a relationship with the mad genius. This film was controversial as the Picasso Estate attempted to stop its production. More controversial still, is their 1995 film, Jefferson in Paris.As the title suggests, the film is about the time, (1784-1789) where the 41-year-old Jefferson held the post of Ambassador to France. This important time marked the beginnings of Frances revolution. Jefferson walked the magnificent halls of Versailles, dined and danced with aristocracy and attempted to maintain good relations with the French government and Monarchy, as they had been key, in terms of monetary and military support, during the American Revolution.President Jefferson, played with surprising aplomb by Nick Nolty, establishes himself in Paris and as history has shown, fell in love with a beautiful artist, Madam Cosway, (Greta Scacchi) and begins an innocent affair, (a deep and lasting relationship if one reads the letters), writing his famous ode to love, My Head and My Heart.American historians and biographers (aside from Fawn Brodie in her entertaining biography of Jefferson) had utterly dismissed Jefferson's alleged relationship with his slave, Sally Hemings. This film focuses on the beginnings of this relationship, which began in Paris, and continued through Jefferson's Presidency. The film was scathingly criticised by established historians until the later DNA results revealed the Jefferson paternity through the Hemings line. Interestingly, however, the debate still continues despite evidence to the contrary and the arguments are compelling.Jefferson in Paris has been created to the standard that we expect from Merchant and Ivory Productions. The depiction of Paris during the late 18th century at a time leading up to the revolution is done with reality and tragedy. The famous women's march from Paris to Versailles, taking Louie XVI and Marie Antoinette back to Paris as prisoners is done extremely well. Merchant and Ivory must be perfectionists, as there seems not to be a single flaw in the entire film.Having read Jefferson and many biographies, this film deserves to be amongst the best of them.

Perhaps I was used to seeing the work of these two master craftsmen set in Edwardian drawing rooms instead of the parlors of late-Bourbon France, but nevertheless I was left feeling that this was a lightweight film that wimped out entirely in the Sally Hemings segment of the story, erroneously given central billing here alongside another relationship Jefferson, acting as his nation's envoy to the French court, undertook with a married Englishwoman, Madam Cosway. There was so much more that could have been focused on in the story of Jefferson's 1780's stay in Europe, so why this film went in the directions it did makes little sense. Also Nick Nolte was simply unconvincing and unwelcoming as Jefferson, even if there was a boldness to a filmmaker finally allowing him to speak with the Virginia drawl it has been noted he possessed. A bored and boring Gwyneth Paltrow was even more miscast as Patsy, the future President's daughter, and all in all by the halfway mark I was disenchanted with the entire movie.

During that time he doesn't seem to do much beyond exchange anti-English sentiments with French veterans (and, to be fair, try to get them their pensions that the US government owes them and isn't paying), try to sort out US financial problems with help from Dutch bankers (how times change!), socialize a lot with the pampered and parasitic French upper classes, have a passionate but apparently unconsummated (something to do with a promise made to his wife on her death-bed) relationship with the glamorous wife of a fashionable artist, and misread the political scene totally (he's convinced that the unrest will settle down and all will end well where in fact it went on to bloody revolution). He also seems more concerned with his attempts to grow American crops in his garden in Paris than with his duties.Oh, and he's a racist pedophile. He is liberal enough to give his black slaves wages while they are in France (after he's asked) but makes it clear that the ""normal arrangements"" will resume when they get back to Virginia. And he has a sexual relationship with Sally, who is supposed to be fifteen years old, quickly getting her pregnant (no worries about the dead wife there, but then Sally is black, and a slave).And that's about it. The film doesn't even have a properly rounded-out ending.In fairness I have to say that the allegation that Jefferson had an ongoing relationship and children by Sally, while presented as fact here, is not proved. The most recent genetic research has shown male Jefferson input into that black family gene pool, but not which Jefferson contributed it.Having gritted my teeth through the usual filmic anti-Brit sentiments I did at least have the satisfaction of the last laugh in knowing that Thandie Newton, highly praised for her portrayal of Sally, is fact an African-Briton.",1,What's it all about?,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2167,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'Brit', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sentimental', 'attachment', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Founding', 'Father', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'light', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'praise', 'getting.It', 'rather', 'unfocused', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Jefferson', 'time', 'US', 'ambassador', 'pre-Revolution', 'France', 'time', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'much', 'exchange', 'anti-English', 'sentiments', 'French', 'veterans', 'be', 'fair', 'try', 'get', 'pensions', 'US', 'government', ""n't"", 'paying', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'US', 'financial', 'problems', 'help', 'Dutch', 'bankers', 'how', 'times', 'change', 'socialize', 'lot', 'pampered', 'parasitic', 'French', 'upper', 'classes', 'have', 'passionate', 'apparently', 'unconsummated', 'something', 'do', 'promise', 'made', 'wife', 'death-bed', 'relationship', 'glamorous', 'wife', 'fashionable', 'artist', 'misread', 'political', 'scene', 'totally', 'convinced', 'unrest', 'will', 'settle', 'down', 'will', 'end', 'well', 'where', 'fact', 'went', 'bloody', 'revolution', 'also', 'more', 'concerned', 'attempts', 'grow', 'American', 'crops', 'garden', 'Paris', 'duties.Oh', 'racist', 'pedophile', 'liberal', 'enough', 'give', 'black', 'slaves', 'wages', 'are', 'France', 'asked', 'clear', 'normal', 'arrangements', 'will', 'resume', 'when', 'get', 'back', 'Virginia', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Sally', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'fifteen', 'years', 'old', 'quickly', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'worries', 'dead', 'wife', 'there', 'then', 'Sally', 'black', 'slave', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'properly', 'rounded-out', 'ending.In', 'fairness', 'have', 'say', 'allegation', 'Jefferson', 'had', 'ongoing', 'relationship', 'children', 'Sally', 'while', 'presented', 'fact', 'here', 'not', 'proved', 'most', 'recent', 'genetic', 'research', 'shown', 'male', 'Jefferson', 'input', 'black', 'family', 'gene', 'pool', 'not', 'Jefferson', 'contributed', 'it.Having', 'gritted', 'teeth', 'usual', 'filmic', 'anti-Brit', 'sentiments', 'did', 'least', 'have', 'satisfaction', 'last', 'laugh', 'knowing', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'highly', 'praised', 'portrayal', 'Sally', 'fact', 'African-Briton']",N/A

I know a little bit about Jefferson and his beliefs and relationships and I say the film portrays this enigmatic man very much as he was, which should be something to cheer about. If the movie were done by anyone other than James Ivory, the makers would cast Leonardo Decapprio or some other unsuitable young turkey and turn him into a rake about town to sell more tickets to teenies.A second cheer goes to Nick Nolte, who had the courage to underplay the quiet, seemingly unemotional Jefferson--who would write some of the greatest love letters history has given us. Go figure. And that is our task. If we try to understand the contradictions in Jefferson, perhaps we will make progress in understanding ourselves. One of history's greatest exponents of individual freedom owned slaves. The man who believed religious freedom should be a basic right kept his daughter from following her conscience and becoming a Catholic. The man who vowed to remain true to his departed wife had a long term relationship with a slave girl.I thought Jefferson's love of Maria Cosway was perfectly played. Can our oversexed, jump-into-bed-at-the-first-hint-of-attraction society comprehend a platonic love relationship?

380543,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,6303584675,Midge,"[6, 13]","Don't waste your money on this DVD. It is VERY poorly written, extremely poorly directed and a bad job of acting... but the problem starts with the bad adaptation which does not begin to properly portray the events and people as historical documents and letters have shown them to be. It was obviously written with overt prejudice and the intent to trash the character of Sally Hemings.This film tries to portray Sally as a scheming tramp who was ignorant and wormed her way into the bed of an innocent, vulnerable statesman. This DVD ""Jefferson in Paris"" is pure trash and not worth the money even if you obtained it for free.It is well known and documented that Sally Hemings was educated and tutored with Jefferson's daughter in France. She learned to read and write in both English and French. She was schooled in etiquette, dance and literature. She was intelligent, well mannered, well-spoken and educated with the qualities of a lady of high station who are taught how to walk, talk and carry themselves as ladies of means. Sally attended all the same lessons and was tutored with Jefferson's daughter Polly. While in France, Sally was dressed in fine gowns, attended aristocratic parties, balls and events. She was an escort and companion to both Jefferson and his daughter while they were in France.Another inaccurate portrayal in this movie was the depiction of an aged actor representing the French King Louis XVI as an elderly man in his 60's. The real King of France was beheaded at the age of 38. His Queen, Marie Antoinette was 37. It is apparent that the director was either ignorant of the facts or was determined to deliberately mislead the audience as is grossly obvious by the extremely offensive depiction of Sally Hemings in this movie. The roll written for the character of Sally Hemings is downright degrading and disgraceful. The dialogue and portrayal for Sally can only have been the product of a deeply prejudicial frame of mind and a twisted stereotype meant to completely degrade Sally's character in total contradiction with documented history concerning the true nature of Sally and her relationship with Thomas Jefferson.If you want to see an accurate portrayal of the life and mannerisms of Sally Hemings, then buy the DVD ""Sally Hemings: An American Love Story"" which is an excellent film with excellent direction and acting and was written to portray Sally and her relationship with Jefferson as history has recorded it. That DVD is less than 5 do11ars so quite affordable.Whomever was responsible for this ""Jefferson in Paris"" piece of trash should be ashamed. It is obviously the work of someone with deep racial prejudices trying to rewrite history to suit their own warped bigotry. The writer and director tried to twist Sally into some kind of scheming, money hungry tramp... because they could not face the truth of Jefferson's deep affections for Sally and the tender nature of the feelings and loyalty she had for him. This DVD tried to make it look like Sally imposed herself on Jefferson against his will. This DVD is unbelievably pitiful and was written to cast unwarranted blame upon Sally.Sally was the half sister to Jefferson's late wife and the aunt to his children. She was treated as an equal by the French aristocracy as well as the commoners who felt she would understand their plight. Jefferson was quite taken with Sally and it was not unusual to court females in their teens during that era. In France, you were considered a woman at age 13 as recently as the late 1960's and 70's. I used to live there. Both males and females were considered mature at that age as late as the 1970's. Even in the US, we had several states, including Texas, who allowed females to marry as young as 12 with parents permission... and this was as recently as the 1980's. The age taboos did not begin until the late 1990's... so it is important not to judge someone in the past based on modern morals.Considering the nature of things during that era, Jefferson had to protect Sally from crazies who might retaliate against her if he were to publicly acknowledge their relationship. Sally would have been in terrible danger from racial hatred and fanatics. She did, in fact, suffer to some degree from relatives and neighbors who terrorized her because of the close relationship she shared with Jefferson. Thus, they had a narrow line to walk.As it was, Sally still became the victim of retaliation after the story was published by Callender. You can see some of the belligerence she had to endure from some of Jefferson's relatives and enemies on the other DVD about the life of Sally Hemings.People often blame Jefferson for not doing more about enslavement during his Presidency... but the country was just barely hanging onto its independence after the Rev war and had to fight again in 1812. Any efforts to free the south would have been met with secession of the southern states which would have weakened the country's ability to maintain its independence. The Rev war would have been lost and the country would have been irreparably divided at the time when their cohesiveness was the only thread holding all of the colonies together in the pursuit of independence.  The politicians remained on the fence until the country could be strong enough against foreign enemies to risk splitting the country into a civil war... and that's what it eventually took to accomplish the free south. If the colonies had been fighting over slavery during the revolutionary war, the British would have retaken the colonies while in turmoil and this country would have never achieved independence. It was a terrible price but freedom was finally achieved after the country had forged a strong independent nation which could stand alone.Save your money and buy the other DVD about Sally Hemings. You won't regret it.Another Video I highly recommend is called ""Enslavement"" which is about the life of Fanny Kemble, a British actress who married a southern plantation owner and became involved helping slaves escape on the underground railroad, costing her the custody of her daughters... but even despite her great sacrifice, she continued to help the slaves to freedom.",1,"Not worth buying.

For anyone who wants to see a film about one of our most fascinating Founding Fathers, this is the film to watch and own.  Its my favorite film about any of the presidents and I wish they would make more of them.  I especially loved the actress who played Marie Antoinette.  She embodied exactly how I pictured Marie Antoinette to look and act when I only read about her.  The same goes for Lambert Wilson, who played the Marquis de Lafayette...exactly as I had imagined him.  My favorite performance though, goes to Thandi Newton as Sally Hemmings.  Seeing her in this film when it first came out made me take notice of her and follow her career with interest.  What I love most about this film is the glimpse it gives viewers of life during the pre-revolutionary period in France, and shows the absurdities of ritualized Court life and why the people demanded change.  King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were simply out of touch with ordinary people, and our Ambassador to France Thomas Jefferson was a first hand witness to it all.  The film ends too abruptly for me.  I would have liked a greater resolution than that...but since films like these are rare, and I wish that Hollywood made more films about our Founding Fathers, I can't complain with what this film accomplishes.

It just felt like a part of a mini-series of which we only get to see one episode; thus seeming like a pointless endeavor for all involved.BTW- I thought casting Nolte was going to be a disaster, but he quickly became convincing; although he'd make a much better Andrew Jackson",3,I'm not sure why this was made,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,572,"['Why', 'not', 'cover', 'entire', 'arc/breadth', 'TJ', 'visit', 'France', 'Funny', 'whole', 'time', 'Cosway', 'affair', 'felt', 'background', 'element', 'film', 'realize', 'indeed', 'WHOLE', 'point', 'movie', 'look', 'cover', 'DVD', '.It', 'actually', 'executed', 'rather', 'well', 'just', 'felt', 'part', 'mini-series', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'one', 'episode', 'thus', 'seeming', 'pointless', 'endeavor', 'involved.BTW-', 'thought', 'casting', 'Nolte', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'disaster', 'quickly', 'became', 'convincing', ""'d"", 'make', 'much', 'better', 'Andrew', 'Jackson']",N/A
