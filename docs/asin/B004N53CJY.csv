If it were not for the want to venture out as private investors raking in stacks of green bundles in a Greek owned ocean faring casino, they might have expanded their schemes to more tribal casinos across the nation other than the 5 or 6 listed in the film. Spacey defines Abramhoff as a fast-talking, film quoting, pathological liar that ultimately and predictably had business connections and dealings with the seedy underworld. What seems to be a consistent historical end to many of the corrupt and fast money-making scams with a ""damn the torpedos"" mentality is that everyone surrounding Mr. Abramhoff, including his most loyal and faithful business partner Michael Scanlon (Pepper), runs to their own corner of safe haven while turning all evidence to the justice department. The congressmen he gave money to campaign for elections not only turned their backs on him, but prosecuted him in hearings by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. The Senate hearings was headed by John McCain, the very man he defeated in lobbying and activism for the election of former President Bush. Pepper does a convincing job as the hapless womanizer and partner Scanlon of Abramhoff's schemes, no matter how many times he is asked, ""how soon can you empty your desk"", but Spacey seems to have his Robin Williams moments of imitating movie lines of everyone from Walter Matthau to Al Pacino as Abramhoff was known to do, even to the point of his wife and his bosses no longer finding it amusing, but I did.

Kevin Spacey is excellent as the lead character, a driven Washington lobbyist who sells access for money, and the other actors are uniformly good. We watch as Spacey sinks further and further into debt until he and his partner focus on Indian bands seeking to open casinos. The two men soak the bands for tens of millions of dollars in fees and don't always secure the results they are promising. The partners also become unwisely involved in a floating casino operation which ends up in murder. Some of the more outlandish scenes did actually happen - a representative from the Midwest really did stand up and make statements about the casino in return for campaign donations. The film is an instructive tale of what happens when morals fly out of the window, to be replaced by money.

1420640,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004N53CJY,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","There are any number of movies that are ""based on true events"" and the producers often run fast and loose with the facts. Here you have a movie that starts by saying ""inspired by true events"" so you know your in murky waters. I don't know the facts of the original story and don't know how they were tweeked to make the script work, so I had to take the movie at face value. That being said, this was still a great watch.I won't recount the story as others already have, but watching Kevin Spacey playing Jack Abramoff is something to behold. He turns him into a very colorful character. I had to keep reminding myself that he was ripping people off, had an ego the size of a small country and that his likability was probably the very thing that allowed him to succeed at being a real scumbag. Barry Pepper, who plays his sidekick Scanlon, is essentially as bad as Abramoff, and Pepper plays him with comic aplomb. He is way over the top with his ego and need to consume. Most of the other secondary characters are written and played well.This is a well paced, well directed movie. At just over 2 hours, I wasn't at all bored. The story unfolds at a very rhythmic pace and there is no down time filler. All the other production values are pro level as well. If I have any complaint it would have to be that too much of it was played comically. As I mentioned, Pepper's Scanlon particularly went a bit too far for me. There is a scene where he is coming apart because some things he told his girlfriend about his dealings are now coming back to bite him in the butt and he's looking at some serious jail time. Most movies would have played this heavy and had the audience chewing their knuckles with the tension. Here, I nearly had to keep myself from laughing. But that's a minor quibble given everything else that happens here.This movie occupies the same space as ""All the President's Men"" and ""Recount"" among others.

A ""dark"" comedy? A ""ha-ha"" comedy? An expose on political corruption?When I think back on the script versus the acting, it reminds me of that old joke that goes ""the job sucks, but at least the hours are long!"" I am a Kevin Spacey fan, though he did this role no service.  Even worse was Barry Pepper (great as Roger Maris) who was either crying, whining or calling everyone ""dude"".  Kelly Preston (who I guess is looking for roles that don't require flashing skin) was so plastic that when she had her one emotional monolog toward the end of the film, made me believe that perhaps she stepped on a tack to work up the anger.  Not to forget John Lovitz (great monolog in ""A League of our Own"") who actually made me laugh when he was getting stabbed in the head and face with a pen!Since the cast has some proven talent, I suppose that the script is the real culprit here.

I can't speak to the facts, and to what extent the events portrayed are true vs. exaggerated (it is an unreal tale no matter which version you read), but as entertainment, it worked for me. It definitely is not done in a documentary style, as some films based on current events are. It is nutty, almost surreal - the writers have taken the more absurdist aspects of convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff's story and played off them to create a unique tone. I know many consider it a political satire, and I guess it is, but it is also a bit more absurdist than that at times. In that, it is PERFECT for Kevin Spacey, and I thought this was an Oscar-worthy performance.

1420645,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004N53CJY,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","There is a quote that states ""history is written by the winners"", attributed in this form to George Orwell. This saying seems to be true and in no greater respect than in the films that find their way to the screen and that always have. When Hollywood leaned right, patriotic films made the day. And now that it's more left, films condemning nearly everything are the rage. So it's not too surprising to find that the film CASINO JACK spends most of its time attempting to brand Republicans as the devil rather than focus on the main character of the title.Lobbyist Jack Abramoff (Kevin Spacey) is the typical lobbyist as we've been told time and time again. The job of the lobbyist is to take information provided to them by their client and attempt to influence those in power, here Senators and Congressmen, to vote in favor of things their clients want. And when it comes to making mountains move, Abramoff is a lobbyist you want on your side.As the film begins, Abramoff is attempting to gather higher profile clients for the firm he works for. First connecting with an manufacturer in the foreign Northern Mariana that uses questionable labor tactics and then bringing in a tribe of Indians who are looking to protect their gambling business. Both of these set Abramoff up in the big leagues. But then a senior member of the firm wants him to help find a buyer for a possibly corrupt gambling cruise ship line and things begin to go south.Rather than find someone else, Jack and his partner in crime Mike Scanlon (Barry Pepper) decide to find a front man and take over the business themselves. Their choice is not the best one but it is someone Jack thinks he knows and thinks he can control: Adam Kidan (Jon Lovitz). Kidan was once the owner of a successful mattress company but has fallen on hard times himself. Now he seems the perfect fit for Abramoff.Things start out fine but slowly go from bad to worse. The clothing manufacturer is taken to task for labor law violations, the deal for the cruise line is up in the air thanks to some financial shenanigans Abramoff and crew attempt and the Indian tribes begin to notice something just isn't quite right in their accounting departments. Through is all Jack continues to wheel and deal with Republican members in Washington as he tries to bring it all in check.This sounds like a great story and in actuality it is. Or at least it could have been. There is a section of the film where the Abramoff begins to question just where it was he went wrong, just where it was that he lost sight of doing the right thing in helping others and instead just wanted to make money. No, making money is not a bad thing but doing so using illegal means and trying to hide it is.The problem here is that the section just mentioned last perhaps 5 minutes tops. The rest of the film is busy trying to paint a portrait of Republicans as the most corrupt group of politicians to walk the face of the Earth. This is not to say they can't be but the fact of the matter is that corruption doesn't have an R or a D behind its name. Both sides have had their fair share of corrupt individuals. To make an attempt to claim only one just cheapens the true story here. And to think that there wasn't an unrepentant bone in Abramoff's body seems disingenuous at best. Perhaps he doesn't have any regrets but had that been the story or even going back and forth attempting to show he had none would have made a better film. Instead we have the stereotypical politicians that in Hollywood are ALL guilty of being corrupt...but only if they're Republicans.Kevin Spacey is always great to see and here he turns in another fine performance. The only thing annoying (and perhaps this was true) was in his portrayal of Abramoff as always doing impersonations. Sure Spacey does a great job of that, but it wears thin fast. Still, Spacey can make a believable character out of little and does so here. We don't get to see much depth to Abramoff, but when those moment shine through, Spacey does a great job.Abramoff's fall from grace, a top paid lobbyist to jail inmate, is an interesting story. Even the bits and pieces offered here make for a tale that makes you want to look deeper into the real events.

The movie examines his rise through the world of influence, finally landing him in jail.  Key to his story is the parallel themes of his amoral use of his skills to further the GOP, side-by-side with his personal faith to his Jewish heritage.

The story is one that needs to be told, good actors, but it is a film that is too outlandish and too over the top. This is probably the real Abramoff. The man who gives lobbyists a really bad name. He put Tom DeLay into the eyesight of the real world, and DeLay was found guilty at his trial. The dirty tricks and murder and mayhem attributed to Jack Abramoff and his ilk is so messy and so ugly that comparing it to the Watergate may seem second rate.  All of the power in DC it seems, was beholden to Jack Abramoff. Money was given and spent freely to win elections. Abramoff says plainly that without the money he spent in Florida on Bush's behalf, Bush would not have won the Presidency. I agree with him that our country may have been a better place.What seems to me to be the best of the film, is a scene in a Senate hearing with John McCain presiding. Some of the Senators present were given money by Abramoff and yet, here they were berating him for his practices. The real hearing with McCain present is interspersed with actors. It is quite extraordinary. Real names are used, and the actors portraying them are very much like them. This part of politics that we seem to see more of on a daily basis is abhorrent to most of us. To the politicians who inhabit DC, it is business as usual.Jack's family stood by him. He is portrayed as a man with an ego bigger than he is. A little off center and downright crazy at times. Someone who spent money literally like water.  He bought and sold and then bought and sold some more. Little thought to anyone but to his need to be the biggest man.

1420659,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004N53CJY,Turfseer,"[5, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Casino Jack' chronicles the rise and fall of Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff starring Kevin Spacey. The film begins with his indictment, followed by a flashback to the beginning of his career as a high-powered lobbyist. The film does not get too deeply into Abramoff's activities in his younger days as head of the College Republican National committee and brief stint as a film producer. For information on his formative years, it is well advised to watch the excellent documentary about Abramoff entitled 'Casino Jack and the United States of Money'.'Casino Jack' mainly focuses on the three major areas of Abramoff's lobbying history: work on behalf of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island (CNMI), for various Native American tribes to promote their casino gambling interests and purchase of SunCruz Casinos in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, initially owned by Konstantinos 'Gus' Boulos.At the basic level, 'Casino Jack' provides an informative but somewhat superficial review of Abramoff's illicit activities (again, to be better informed, check out the documentary CJ and the US of Money). In the case of CNMI, sweatshop owners took advantage of the lax labor laws on the islands since the strict regulatory laws of the US did not apply. Abramoff got millions from these crooks to influence legislators to ensure that the sweatshop owners continued to exploit cheap labor imported from Asian countries. At one point, Abramoff is able to have Majority leader Tom Delay come out to the Marianas where he wines and dines him (including ubiquitous golf outings). Delay fails to make any deep inquiries regarding exploitation of the workers and is the later recipient of contributions to his campaign war chest and foundations from Abramoff. 'Casino Jack' further chronicles a setback that Abramoff must deal with--a new governor squashes Abramoff's contract so later CNMI senators are paid off and the senate council reinstates the contract. The US of Money documentary provides a sad postscript: international treaties eventually add regulatory clout to the garment industry so the sweatshop owners pick up and leave, resulting in the destruction of the islands' economy.Abramoff's take no prisoners approach reaches its apotheosis in his dealings with the Native American tribes. Partnering with former Delay assistant, Mike Scanlon (played by an over the top Barry Pepper) Abramoff extracts millions from the Louisiana Coushatta tribe to ensure that the State of Texas passes a law preventing the Tiguas in El Paso from continuing to operate their casino there. He convinces the Coushatta tribe that his old college chum Ralph Reed, head of the Christian coalition, will work for the abolition of casino gambling in Texas. Since it would look bad that Reed was getting money from the Coushattas, their payments were funneled into a shell company under Scanlon's name. Money was sent to Reed and Scanlon but Abramoff of course got his cut, unbeknownst to the tribal leaders who agreed to the deal with Scanlon.. Then Abramoff goes back to the Tiguas and convinces them that although Reed worked against them in Texas, he actually was providing information about his anti-gambling strategy which would help Abramoff reverse the Texas ban on casino gambling. As it turned out, Abramoff's influence came to naught when Congress failed to overturn the Texas ban. The Tiguas were out millions and the embezzlement of their money figured in the eventual indictment of Abramoff.Finally, in the most difficult to understand part of the movie, Abramoff enlists the aid of a disbarred attorney and Mattress company TV pitchman Adam Kidan, played by Jon Lovitz to purchase the SunCruz casino cruise boats. Lovitz plays Kidan as a comic sleaze-ball. The Abramoff documentary shows Kidan to be much more intelligent and classier than the way Lovitz depicts him here. The upshot of the SunCruz deal was that the owner Boulos was forced to sell his interest in his company since he was not a US Citizen. Abramoff conscripted a US representative Bob Ney (later convicted and jailed) to denounce Boulos in the Congressional record in exchange for access to Tom Delay. This apparently moved Boulos to act more quickly in agreeing to the sale of the company to Abramoff and Kidan. In order to obtain a $60 million loan, Abramoff and Kidan used a fake wire transfer of $23 million dollars and this was what they were eventually sent to prison for.'Casino Jack' also delves into Abramoff's relationship with his wife, and some of his other interests including establishing of an Orthodox Jewish school for boys and two restaurants that he opened up for a time. Kevin Spacey is good at regurgitating all those movie lines Abramoff was famous for coupled with some notable impressions of famous politicians. But Spacey plays Abramoff more as a manic showman; the real Abramoff (in the documentary) appears to be much more low-key and cunning. Much more convincing is Spencer Garrett as Tom Delay who really gets the former representative down to a tee. Hannah Endicott-Douglass does a fine job as Abramoff's long-suffering wife. One of the best scenes is when she confronts her husband while he's taking a bath. Abramoff says he's ashamed of himself for letting 'God' down. The wife asks, ""what about your family?""For those who know nothing about the history of Jack Abramoff, 'Casino Jack' should be viewed as a basic primer on the events surrounding Abramoff's rise and fall. The film's scenarists do a fairly adequate job in covering the bases but much of what happens is not always easy to follow. That's what happens when there is too much material available to condense. I would have preferred that the casting director chose someone else besides Kevin Spacey to play Abramoff. Nevertheless, his performance is passable enough to hold one's interest to the end. I'm not entirely sure that 'Casino Jack' works as a comedy (which is what was basically done here). Certainly, there were comic moments to the saga. Overall, however, this was more tragic than funny.",3,Basic primer of Washington lobbyist's rise and fall,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,6096,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers',
