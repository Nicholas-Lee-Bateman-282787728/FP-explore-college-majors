1679247,A2K2DMOM2BJSKP,B00GMV8LIO,Adam Rodriguez,"[0, 1]","This is one of the best films of 2013, the film had sort of a goodfellas feel to it, it was like the goodfellas, a crime drama, but with a spice of comedy that will have you rolling and begging for more.  The plot begins with Christian Bale and Amy Adam's characters getting in trouble with the FBI, they were con artists and conned the wrong person; Bradley Cooper's character. Bradley's character cuts them both some slack and has them become informants for the FBI to catch bigger fish, being a 1970's italian mafia movie, there's a lot of big fish to fry. Anyways, without giving too much away, there's a love triangle between the the four character's, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, and the lovely Jennifer Lawrence. AMAZING acting, funny, yet heart breaking drama comedy, this film deserved the nominations it got.. it's truly an instant classic, falls into the classics like Forest Gump, Goodfellas, it's truly an amazing picture that I wouldnt mind seeing again. Jennifer Lawrence played a guidette, poor, single mother that didn't have Christian Bale's character too much in her life, because he was too busy conning people with his partner in crime Amy Adam's... Jennifer Lawrence is loveable, funny, and will bring a tear to your eye... originally she is what brought me to see this movie. Anyways, it was kind of slow in the beginning, getting to know the characters, but man does it pick up, and man what a ride! Must watch!

1679250,A1NMHU4RJZO1GW,B00GMV8LIO,A. Hollett,"[4, 9]","***Spoilers Ahead***Along with Wolf of Wall Street, this movie got such a great deal of hype, not to mention Oscar awards, that I figured I'd give it a shot. Just like with Wolf of Wall Street, I was quite disappointed by it. The story itself seemed to just jump around all over the place, flashing from scene to scene before the first one was finished. The characters as well seemed very uneven as well, making emotional leaps and nosedives all over the place without any real clear reason why.You have our two &#34;leads&#34;, Christina Bale (who I can't take seriously anymore after Batman) and Amy Adams, that are very close one second, then hate each other the next, then are back in close again without any real explanations as to why. They are supposed to be very smart con artists, and yet they don't utilize any of their skills to get out of the jam, or even try to, until the absolute last five minutes of the movie. Not to mention their &#34;chemistry&#34; seemed more like distilled water as opposed to any kind of fiery heat. I honestly couldn't care less if they ended up with each other or not by the end of the movie. And as far as the &#34;friendship&#34; between Bale's character and Renner's character, I only have Bale's voice over to tell me about this, because other than when Renner's character discovers what Bale's really been doing do we see any real emotion regarding the relationship between these two. Oh yes, and we have the film opening things with a shot of Amy Adams' character being a stripper, something that is never even mentioned again. So my question is, why even bother telling the audience about it? It brought absolutely no weight to the movie and quite honestly I forgot about that tidbit about the character five minutes later. The same could be said about Bale's character. The movie opens with him talking about how he shattered windows so his father would get business for his glass company so he wouldn't get &#34;taken&#34; anymore. Exactly how was his father taken? It's never even explained. Was it done legally or illegally? And, of course, there's his dry cleaning business, which is essentially pointless to this movie other than being a set piece in the beginning for Amy Adams to have a fashion show. Even Bale's art scam was pointless, as it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Hell, the scam he and Adams come up with made absolutely no sense. It was never really explained. What exactly were their marks giving them $5,000 for to begin with. Was it an investment, was it supposed to be money laundering? We're never told.You have the FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) who is so obsessed with going higher and higher up the criminal food chain that the entire character becomes a cartoon. When he beats the living hell out of his boss because he wouldn't give him an incredibly expensive hotel room for a sting operation, and is then given accolades by his boss's boss instead of being thrown out of the Bureau and charged with battery, at that point the whole movie had jumped the shark. And that's not even talking about his inexplicable use of cocaine in one scene that is never even hinted at again, regardless of his manic behavior throughout the movie.Jeremy Renner did do a fine job in the role he was cast. The character seemed rather sincere and wasn't a typical dirty politician, which was just fine for this movie. I can't say I have any complaints about the character other than it and the actor were wasted on this film.Jennifer Lawrence was fine, I suppose, though instead of being conniving and sneaky in her own loud way, she seemed like she was either a sociopath or someone with bi-polar disorder. Seriously, I doubt you'd have much trouble convincing a judge, even one from the late 70's, that she was in no condition to take full-time custody of her child.Then there were the accents. I was actually ok with Adams' British accent. It wasn't great but it wasn't too terrible either. The problem I had is she was supposed to be from New Mexico and yet she would inexplicably shift into a New Jersey or New York accent when not using her British one. This is after, in the opening scenes, we hear her normal accent which sounds Midwestern. It just makes no sense. That and Alessandro Nivola, Bradley Cooper's boss's boss sounded like he was trying to do a Christopher Walken impression the entire movie.About the only thing this movie had going for it was wardrobe, and by that I mean having the two leading ladies (more Adams than Lawrence) wear outfits that showed off their curves to the utter maximum without being vulgar for the entire movie.Overall, I just found the movie to be pretty bad and find it very disheartening that this and Wolf of Wall Street are what is considered wonderful, powerful movies these days. It seems that the people in Hollywood really know their audiences now and know they can cram any kind of garbage down our throats, as long as their PR people tell us it's the finest cut of filet. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, or if you have to watch it make sure you don't pay a dime to see it, it's a waste of your money.",1,Not really worth the hype,1396396800,"04 2,

Russell.  Russell is a director who has been getting a lot of flak over the past few years (and his past few films) for selling out; leaving his former eccentric formula of filmmaking for a more commercial and Oscary trajectory.  I honestly didn&#8217;t care too much either way.  The only Russell film that I really like is &#8216;I Heart Huckabees&#8217;, which is actually very different from any of his other films I&#8217;ve seen.  Granted, I haven&#8217;t seen &#8216;Flirting With Disaster&#8217; (which I hear is a favorite among his fans) but I seem to find some kernel of something I dislike about all his films, sans &#8216;I Heart Huckabees&#8217;.Still, I was kind of excited about &#8216;American Hustle&#8217;.  I&#8217;ll admit, when the project was first announced I wasn&#8217;t very interested.  I liked some of the cast and was disinterested in the other half.  Bale and Adams are usually reliable presences, and while I was never a fan BEFORE &#8216;Silver Linings Playbook&#8217;, I became a fan of Jennifer Lawrence based on that spirited performance and her tactless charm.  Still, I kind of hate Jeremy Renner and find Bradley Cooper annoying.But then the trailer was dropped and it looked like such fun!For me, &#8216;American Hustle&#8217; kind of feels like an eccentrically commercial film, so maybe this is the perfect lane for Russell, who obviously wants that Oscar.  I&#8217;m still shocked that this so heavily over-performed with Oscar (racking up TEN Oscar nominations) and yet failed to win a single award, but AMPAS is obviously responding well to Russell&#8217;s directorial direction, so I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s only a matter of time.Like I said; I couldn&#8217;t honestly care less, but whatever.The film is loosely based the ABSCAM federal con-job of the 70&#8217;s.  I&#8217;m not entirely familiar with the real story, so I have no idea what of this actually happened, but this was intricately plotted fun, and while there are some plotting issues, this film mostly succeeds because of an ample cast and some sharp direction.  Yes, David O. Russell has some serious fun with this one; point to point.Here we have Irving Rosenfeld, a charismatic con man who gets himself in a sticky situation when he gets busted by an over ambitious FBI agent named Richie DiMaso.  Irving&#8217;s partner, Sydney, is pulled into Richie&#8217;s web of charm and while Richie&#8217;s grip on Irving and Sydney tightens with his proposition to them, she begins playing the field herself; turning tables with a subtle allure.  You see, Richie wants bigger names than Irving Rosenfeld, and so he offers Irving a clean slate if he helps entrap four big names.  He sets his sights on Carmine Polito; an ambitious New Jersey mayor looking to make a better life for the kids in his community.  With his passions and Irving&#8217;s persistence, the con is in place to make Richie a big name in his unit.But Irving&#8217;s crazy wife, Rosalyn, could ruin everything.The energy here is pretty great, and that is thanks to all the sharp editing tricks.  Some films really rely on those cuts to create the needed tone, and this one has that in spades.  I kind of found the dialog here really pedestrian, so while the whole plot unraveling and twists here and there were intriguing and wholly engaged, the dialog in some key scenes was just distracting.  Thankfully, actors like Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper knew how to take those ridiculous lines and make them feel soulful and spirited.  The cast all works really, and I was surprised with how much I really liked Jeremy Renner here (who was honestly best in show).  A lot of people balked at Lawrence&#8217;s high octane performance and her battle with the accent, but she was just so hilariously layered here.  Her confrontation scene with Adams, despite some shoddy dialog (seriously Russell?) was so human.  Adams&#8217; accent work, although part of the film itself, was more distracting simply because it was so unbelievably uneven that I can&#8217;t imagine anyone would fall for it, let along an FBI Agent.But like I said, this was a lot of fun, and while I would have trimmed this down a tad, I can&#8217;t say that I want my time back.",4,Do the hustle&#8230;,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,4426,"['kind', 'love', 'movie', 'clever', 'disclaimer', '8216', 'actually', 'happened', '8217', 'tone', 'mostly', 'energetic', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'Russell', 'director', 'who', 'been', 'getting', 'lot', 'flak', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'past', 'few', 'films', 'selling', 'out', 'leaving', 'former', 'eccentric', 'formula', 'filmmaking', 'more', 'commercial', 'Oscary', 'trajectory', 'honestly', 'didn', '8217', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'only', 'Russell', 'film', 'really', '8216', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', '8217', 'actually', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'films', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'Granted', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', '8216', 'Flirting', 'Disaster', '8217', 'hear', 'favorite', 'fans', 'seem', 'find', 'kernel', 'something', 'dislike', 'films', 'sans', '8216', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', '8217', '.Still', 'was', 'kind', 'excited', '8216', 'American', 'Hustle', '8217', '8217', 'admit', 'when', 'project', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'wasn', '8217', 'very', 'interested', 'liked', 'cast', 'was', 'disinterested', 'other', 'half', 'Bale', 'Adams', 'are', 'usually', 'reliable', 'presences', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'BEFORE', '8216', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', '8217', 'became', 'fan', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'based', 'spirited', 'performance', 'tactless', 'charm', 'Still', 'kind', 'hate', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'find', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'annoying.But', 'then', 'trailer', 'was', 'dropped', 'looked', 'such', 'fun', '8216', 'American', 'Hustle', '8217', 'kind', 'feels', 'eccentrically', 'commercial', 'film', 'so', 'maybe', 'perfect', 'lane', 'Russell', 'who', 'obviously', 'Oscar', '8217', 'still', 'shocked', 'so', 'heavily', 'over-performed', 'Oscar', 'racking', 'up', 'TEN', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'yet', 'failed', 'win', 'single', 'award', 'AMPAS', 'obviously', 'responding', 'well', 'Russell', '8217', 'directorial', 'direction', '8217', 'sure', '8217', 'only', 'matter', 'time.Like', 'said', 'couldn', '8217', 'honestly', 'care', 'less', 'whatever.The', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'ABSCAM', 'federal', 'con-job', '70', '8217', '8217', 'not', 'entirely', 'familiar', 'real', 'story', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'was', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'fun', 'are', 'plotting', 'issues', 'film', 'mostly', 'ample', 'cast', 'sharp', 'direction', 'Yes', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'serious', 'fun', 'one', 'point', 'point.Here', 'have', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'charismatic', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'sticky', 'situation', 'when', 'busted', 'over', 'ambitious', 'FBI', 'agent', 'named', 'Richie', 'DiMaso', 'Irving', '8217', 's', 'partner', 'Sydney', 'pulled', 'Richie', '8217', 'web', 'charm', 'Richie', '8217', 'grip', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'tightens', 'proposition', 'playing', 'field', 'turning', 'tables', 'subtle', 'allure', 'see', 'Richie', 'bigger', 'names', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'so', 'Irving', 'clean', 'slate', 'entrap', 'four', 'big', 'names', 'sights', 'Carmine', 'Polito', 'ambitious', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mayor', 'looking', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'kids', 'community', 'passions', 'Irving', '8217', 's', 'persistence', 'con', 'place', 'make', 'Richie', 'big', 'name', 'unit.But', 'Irving', '8217', 'crazy', 'wife', 'Rosalyn', 'could', 'ruin', 'everything.The', 'energy', 'here', 'pretty', 'great', 'thanks', 'sharp', 'editing', 'tricks', 'films', 'really', 'rely', 'cuts', 'create', 'needed', 'tone', 'one', 'spades', 'kind', 'found', 'dialog', 'here', 'really', 'pedestrian', 'so', 'whole', 'plot', 'unraveling', 'twists', 'here', 'there', 'were', 'intriguing', 'wholly', 'engaged', 'dialog', 'key', 'scenes', 'was', 'just', 'distracting', 'Thankfully', 'actors', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'knew', 'how', 'take', 'ridiculous', 'lines', 'make', 'feel', 'soulful', 'spirited', 'cast', 'works', 'really', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'liked', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'here', 'who', 'was', 'honestly', 'best', 'show', 'lot', 'people', 'balked', 'Lawrence', '8217', 'high', 'octane', 'performance', 'battle', 'accent', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'hilariously', 'layered', 'here', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'Adams', 'shoddy', 'dialog', 'seriously', 'Russell', 'was', 'so', 'human', 'Adams', '8217', 'accent', 'work', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'distracting', 'simply', 'was', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'uneven', 'can', '8217', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'would', 'fall', 'let', 'FBI', 'Agent.But', 'said', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'would', 'have', 'trimmed', 'down', 'tad', 'can', '8217', 't', 'say', 'want', 'time', 'back']",N/A

You see all the awards it's been getting, amazing quotes from critics, and your expectations are set way too high. Then, when you actually see it, you're totally disappointed, and expected something much better. That's exactly what happened when I first saw ""American Hustle"". I liked it a lot, but not as much as other people seemed too. When I decided to see it a second time, I tried to put all the hype aside, and I enjoyed the movie considerably more.The film follows Irving Rosenfeld, played by Christian Bale, a con-man who runs a corrupt loan business alongside his seductive partner Sydney (Amy Adams). When busted by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), he is obliged to work together with him to lineup the arrests of several other people including congressmen and mafia members.With awesome costumes and music choices that set you right in the time period, the movie is enchanting from the start.

1679304,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00GMV8LIO,California Dreaming,"[3, 3]","I just watched ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (TWOWS) -- a film that clocks in at just shy of three hours -- and then I watched ""American Hustle"" (AH) -- a film that clocks in at a little over two hours.  Guess which film seemed to have the longer running time to me?TWOWS runs at an incredibly frenetic pace, mostly due to the standard terrific performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.  Sure, after watching that other film, you might look at your watch and think, ""Wow!  Where did the day go!"" but it is such a fun ride that you really don't care.  On the other hand, AH just seems to crawl along at a snail's pace, and after awhile I just wanted to roll up into a ball and go into my shell.I will say that Christian Bale is fantastic, however.  When is he not?  I watched a bit of ""The Machinist"" the other night -- I've seen it in its entirety before, and I just wanted to see him in that film again to see if he was as good as I'd remembered -- and he might have even been better there, although it is a very close call.  He is such a versatile actor that he can move like a chameleon from one role to another and you might only recognize him after glancing at the credits.  The rest of the cast here is fine, of course, but it just seemed to me that this film is less than the sum of its parts; take each of the actors and he or she is very good to great, but add them together and something seems to be missing.But to be fair, I will admit that I've never much been a fan of scam/caper flicks in general.  Usually, these types of films tend to believe that they are funnier than they are, and this one seems to follow suit.

As odd as the rest of the cast was, she was a full blown character from Mars. She just grabs hold of that camera when she comes onscreen and never lets go. Amy Adams was sexier and more sophisticated in the movie but she did not create the indelible impression on me which Lawrence did. Bale was wholly unrecognizable as a pudgy Jewish conman who becomes more likable as the film goes on. Bradley Cooper as the FBI man and Louis C.K. as his boss were good but again these were not roles you will never forget.this is a film about con men and women plus the feds trying to act the same.  they are trying to take down some politicians. the con people are in it to get out of a jail sentence. we have seen con based movies before. The plot all revolves around tricking people until you can't tell who is tricking whom. it all gets ironed out in the end but it is the performances which make this kind of movie. we already have seen the basic plot so our socks have to be knocked out by the cast.  And they were.Bale and Lawrence were such a great comic duo together that they should try it again together. They have real screen chemistry.

Selznick I&#8217;m thinking about, who was a great producer in the 30s and 40s of many Hitchcock films, &#34;King Kong&#34; and most notably &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34;. So David O. Russell really doesn&#8217;t compare to Selznick other than the similarity of name and the fact that the big &#8216;O&#8217; in the middle seems to signify an association with quality films and Oscar nominated and winning films.Russell has been flirting with Oscar trophies for 3-years now. First he directed &#34;The Fighter&#34;, then &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; and now he will most certainly be nominated for a third time for &#34;American Hustle&#34;. He may not win again, but it would be a safe bet that at least one of the actors he cast in &#34;Hustle&#34; will walk away with trophy. While Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner were all outstanding in their performances, I&#8217;d have to admit, it was Jennifer Lawrence that plays the smaller role in the film and steals the scene every time she appears.&#34;American Hustle&#34; is a throwback to when films about heists, swindles and double-crosses were the talk of the town. It&#8217;s the kind of film that tests your true love for cinema. As the film plays out and we swirl around in Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Adams) a.k.a Lady Edith Greensly&#8217;s worlds, it&#8217;s like a test of patience. Irving and Sydney find themselves getting deeper and deeper into trouble and the movie is exhausting with the banter, plots and plans. Your head will be literally spinning just hoping to keep up with their mess. While it was slow moving and littered with a barrage of oncoming information, it&#8217;s exactly how you should feel watching the film, because it is exactly what Irving and Sydney are dealing with.&#34;Hustle&#34; is a dance along the fine line that is right and wrong; survival and ruin. It is exactly what happens when a script, that should be nominated for an Oscar by the way, can either be mundane and boring or lifted above that by the performers of the roles. The performers in &#34;American Hustle&#34; do just that and then some. With humor and passion and great writing, you get caught up in the tornado of right and wrong, trying to figure out how to get off, just like Irving and Sydney.",4,"ACTORS make what could have been boring, NOT",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,2396,"['David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'just', 'one', '1970s', 'directors', 'maybe', '8217', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', '8217', 'thinking', 'about', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'producer', '30s', '40s', 'many', 'Hitchcock', 'films', '34', 'King', 'Kong', '34', 'most', 'notably', '34', 'Gone', 'Wind', '34', 'So', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'really', '8217', 'compare', 'Selznick', 'other', 'similarity', 'name', 'fact', 'big', '8216', 'O', '8217', 'middle', 'signify', 'association', 'quality', 'films', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'winning', 'films.Russell', 'been', 'flirting', 'Oscar', 'trophies', '3-years', 'now', 'First', 'directed', '34', 'Fighter', '34', 'then', '34', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', '34', 'now', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'nominated', 'third', 'time', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'may', 'not', 'win', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'safe', 'bet', 'least', 'one', 'actors', 'cast', '34', 'Hustle', '34', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'trophy', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'were', 'outstanding', 'performances', '8217', 'd', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'smaller', 'role', 'film', 'scene', 'time', 'appears.', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'throwback', 'when', 'films', 'heists', 'swindles', 'double-crosses', 'were', 'talk', 'town', '8217', 'kind', 'film', 'true', 'love', 'cinema', 'film', 'out', 'swirl', 'around', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'Bale', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Adams', 'a.k.a', 'Lady', 'Edith', 'Greensly', '8217', 's', 'worlds', '8217', 's', 'test', 'patience', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'find', 'getting', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'trouble', 'movie', 'exhausting', 'banter', 'plots', 'plans', 'head', 'will', 'be', 'literally', 'spinning', 'just', 'hoping', 'keep', 'up', 'mess', 'was', 'slow', 'moving', 'littered', 'barrage', 'oncoming', 'information', '8217', 'exactly', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'watching', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'are', 'dealing', 'with.', '34', 'Hustle', '34', 'dance', 'fine', 'line', 'right', 'wrong', 'survival', 'ruin', 'exactly', 'what', 'when', 'script', 'should', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'way', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'mundane', 'boring', 'lifted', 'performers', 'roles', 'performers', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'do', 'just', 'then', 'humor', 'passion', 'great', 'writing', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'tornado', 'right', 'wrong', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'off', 'just', 'Irving', 'Sydney']",N/A

1679330,A2CMP5MS7GQ5OQ,B00GMV8LIO,Couch Potato Michael,"[2, 5]","American Hustle is an excellent ensemble of grade A actors who signed on to do a really bad film. Amy Adams plays a ghostly looking smoking hot babe in the first half of this film but fizzles out in the second half. Her makeup is poorly done. Adams is so pale white she truly looks sickly. I thought Amy Adams might seriously have Leukemia or was secretly playing the role of a mime. Someone forgot to tell Adams that in the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s everyone had tans in the summer. Jennifer Lawrence best performance ended up on the cutting room floor. Quite frankly the whole film should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Lawrence is way too good an actress to accept such roles. Sorry but, this role makes Lawrence look cheap and she deserves better. Maybe the &#8220;powers that be&#8221; and a big pay day &#8220;compelled&#8221; Lawrence, as she is too brilliant an actress to do this film otherwise. Also noted is Lawrence&#8217;s hair which looks like it was styled by a low amp electrical socket. Insult to injury, apparently some producers thought they could recreate the magic of last year&#8217;s big winner, &#8220;Silver Lining Playbook,&#8221; by again teaming Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in American Hustle. Sorry folk, there is no magic in Cooper&#8217;s performance but the failure is the lousy script. However, those who love &#8220;hair gone awry&#8221; movies, get so see Adams and Cooper in hair rollers. Thank God, I can now check that off my bucket list. Christian Bale is way out of his normal element in this film and speaking of a bad hair day, I&#8217;m hear to announce Bale wins the Oscar for worse hair ever in a motion picture. Rounding out the cast is Jeremy Renner and speaking of hair, every time I saw Renner in this movie, he reminded me of the &#8220;Big Boy Restaurant&#8221; iconic statue of the boy holding a hamburger. Renner had a small dull role that will be difficult to remember. Renner who? Looking at his performance in this movie, Renner has to be embarrassed to show his face, unless of course he has his &#8220;hair&#8221; on and is visiting Big Boy&#8217;s.The Oscars are awards given by &#8220;The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences&#8221; (AMPAS) for exceptional achievement in the film industry. AMPAS currently has fewer than 6000 voting members. In 2014, the Academy announced American Hustle received 10 Oscar nominations. With this many nods for American Hustle, I have to ask if all AMPAS members are high. American Hustle is a poorly done, boring, nightmarish monster mash of hogwash created in Never Ever Land on the Island of Misfit Movies. There I said it, someone had to say it, and don&#8217;t feel an ounce of guilt for saying it. The movie insults any known existence of real human life but on a positive note, it does come with a lot of bad hair!!! YEAHThe total gross box office take for this movie is in the millions and millions. The box office take tells me, &#8220;American Hustle&#8221; pulled the wool over the eyes of movie goers worldwide. Therefore, the biggest American Hustle here is the fact movie goes paid to see this very small minded entertainment. O dear, did I really call this movie entertainment? My bad! The long and short of this movie is, &#8220;congratulations movie goers, you have been scammed by Bad Hair Are Us.&#8221; Lastly, the Oscar for &#8220;best trick without treat&#8221; scam of the year goes to&#8230;.  &#8220;American Hustle.&#8221; (Applause, Applause) All seriousness and joking aside, if you are looking to have a nice nap on a lazy Saturday afternoon, this is a great movie to sleep past, as long as you don&#8217;t have to pay to watch it.

1679333,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00GMV8LIO,C. Sawin,"[3, 4]","&#34;American Hustle&#34; has an opening so simple it's genius. An out-of-shape Christian Bale is seen adjusting and perfecting his comb-over for five glorious minutes after the words &#34;Some of this actually happened,&#34; appear on screen. Nearly every character is driven by greed as their flaws only seem to compliment the storyline more and more as the film progresses. It's like adding gasoline to a raging wildfire; undisciplined and out of control yet attention demanding in absolutely every way.Irving falls in love with Sydney even though he's married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and has adopted her son and loves him as his own flesh and blood. The love triangle gets even more disfigured when Sydney starts messing around with Richie who blatantly disregards his fianc&eacute;. The film mostly takes place in the late 70s and relocates from New York to New Jersey once the main storyline kicks into gear. Gambling has just been introduced to the state of New Jersey thanks to Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner); a man loved by everyone who just wants to rebuild Atlantic City but occasionally does shady things in order to what's best for the people.Like &#34;Silver Linings Playbook,&#34; &#34;American Hustle&#34; features a dance sequence. One of the main differences is that dancing was used as a way for the characters to connect in &#34;Playbook.&#34; The dancing felt very neat, Pat and Tiffany became more drawn to one another, and dancing was shown in this very positive light that made it seem like an art form. In &#34;Hustle,&#34; the dancing is sweaty, the people are smarmy and rubbing up on one another, and the lighting makes you sick. The whole sequence smells of bathroom sex and you can practically taste it. Dancing in &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; is like making love to someone you care about for the first time; it's tender and intimate but a little sloppy due to inexperience. In &#34;American Hustle,&#34; the dancing is rough, it's sloppy, and it's between two people who not only barely know each other but have done it countless times before. It's like the beginning of car sex without the opportunity to finish.The cast really lets loose in the film. Bradley Cooper unleashes this savage side of himself you've never really seen before. Richie is a loose cannon. The character is so angry in a scary kind of way. Jeremy Renner portrays a character that seems very out of the box for a guy who has mostly portrayed weapon experts. Carmine has this Robin Hood trait to him; he deals with the mafia and the politicians so the people don't have to in hopes of expanding the economy of the city. He has a heart of gold and a face everyone loves. Jennifer Lawrence adds a few new highlights to how well she can play crazy, unpredictable, and manipulative. Christian Bale is able to transform himself yet again and is nearly unrecognizable as Irving Rosenfeld. Irving has this car salesman quality to him that you can't stand and makes your skin crawl, but he has a way of getting exactly what he wants.Seeing Louis C.K. with a fairly substantial role is quite a surprise though. However you will be left craving an ending to that ice fishing story he always starts and never finishes. Lastly, Robert De Niro only has a very small supporting role in the film, but it's easily one of the best roles he's done in years. It's exactly what the actor is known best for. You can feel the tension in the room during the meeting with him and are completely thrown off guard by what he has up his sleeve.David O. Russell has created this riveting world full of eccentric, well-rounded characters. &#34;American Hustle&#34; is a crime drama that is constantly engaging, hilarious, and stimulating.

1679334,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00GMV8LIO,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[5, 7]","Suggested by actual events of the Abscam sting in the 1970s, the FBI plans to setup and arrest corrupt politicians. How they get the officials and the professional con artists that help the sting operation are the basis of a nostalgic film.  As directed and co-written by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, The Fighter), American Hustle is an acting clinic highlighting a convoluted tale of men and women who are looking for a big score.In 1978, ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), forces con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), to help arrange a con on white collar crime, specifically targeting corrupt politicians.  Richie wants to make a name for himself, and he is immediately attracted to Sydney and has designs on her beyond the con.  Starting with a local, beloved mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), high level political figures are drawn in, and there is the possible organized crime connection. Further, Irving&#8217;s wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), threatens to derail the sting.  As Richie&#8217;s grand plan comes together, things get more complicated and risky, and Irving and Sydney must rely on their skills to survive.These are very well etched characters.  Each has something to gain, and each has an angle to exploit, whether it&#8217;s Richie&#8217;s dreams of a big bust or Rosalyn&#8217;s threats to expose the operation.  Kindred souls and survivors, Irving and Sydney have mastered the art of deception and manipulation.  You feel a degree of sympathy for Irving despite his criminal past and his marital discord.  Not only does he love his women, but he tries to save a friend from jail.  Irving turns out to be someone to root for.  In fact the world is not black and white especially when an FBI agent breaks the rules and gets involved with one of the principals.  Carmine is the noble, elected official who truly believes in doing good for his community.  Just who are the good guys and bad guys? Just who is conning who?Memorable scenes include a catty confrontation in a women&#8217;s restroom, the faceoff between Richie and his beleaguered boss (played to great effect by Louis C. K.), and an incredibly tense meeting with a head mobster (Robert DeNiro in a lethal cameo).Acting is superior throughout as expected in a Russell ensemble with the principals at the top of their game.  Bale transforms his physical appearance as an overweight, balding schlep (a far cry from The Dark Knight&#8217;s Batman).  A sultry Adams (Doubt, Her) has a great time playing a kindred con artist with a British accent.  Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) has a ball as the gung ho agent with a 1970s perm who will step over his boss to get his time in the sun.  Lawrence (The Hunger Games, Winter&#8217;s Bone) excels as the wife who exhibits a bold brashness in public which delights her onlookers but risks blowing the sting.There is liberal use of 1970&#8217;s pop songs which blend with the costumes and hair styles seamlessly.  The camera work is fluid and is reminiscent of early Martin Scorsese films. There is a very carefree attitude in the film&#8217;s look and feel which is consistent with this loose, uninhibited decade.A slice of the seventies with freewheeling hustlers and loose morals, at its core, American Hustle is a love story centering on Irving, an imperfect con artist and the women in his life.  The film is essentially a con within a con and keeps you guessing until the end.

When I first started watching it I was lost but then I was trying to watch it while doing something else.  This is not that kind of a movie and you do need to focus on it; once I did that, I liked it.  My husband did what others seem to be doing.  He walked out of the room and said it was weird while I ended up liking this movie a lot.I also think that Amy Adams and most definitely Jennifer Lawrence were ROBBED of an Oscar.  Jennifer Lawrence was so fantastic in the movie that she dominated every scene she was in and you wanted her to be in more scenes.  Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper were really good in the movie too. Overall, the acting was really good and I can see why the actors and movie won a Golden Globe award; they should have won more.I&#8217;ve seen &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; (slow moving, Cate was good but not enough to win), &#34;Gravity&#34; (boring, love Sandra Bullock but not in this movie) and &#34;12 Years a Slave&#34; (horrible movie and some of the worst acting, don&#8217;t know how it won the awards it did) and I have to say in all honesty that Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence should have won.I am giving this movie 4 stars (can&#8217;t give it 4.5) and not 5 for one reason only, it does take focus and it can easily lose viewers and ratings because of it.  I actually liked the soundtrack but then I am almost 60 years old and I know this music.The bottom line is, GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE or perhaps a 2nd chance and give it your undivided attention.  Only then will you begin to understand why we are giving it such a high rating.

1679339,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00GMV8LIO,DanD,"[1, 1]","Imagine a con-artist couple, Irving and Sydney.  They get busted by an FBI agent, Richie, who asks them to help him nab a mayor and a bunch of crooked politicians.  The scheme involves a fake sheik, thousands of dollars that no one wants to put up, the mafia, and Irving's unpredictable, manic-depressive wife Rosalyn.Sound like a slapstick comedy by way of Martin Scorsese?  It is, sort of.  David O. Russell's AMERICAN HUSTLE is an homage to a decade, and an attempt to hone in on some of the classic Scorsese vibe.  A bit too much, at times--the style seems a bit of a rip-off at times, especially when paired with the (admittedly great) soundtrack.  In fact, as good a director as Russell can be, this film is elevated by its script (courtesy of Russell and Eric Warren Singer, featuring fantastic dialogue, some true emotional grit, and a couple nice twists) and the acting.  Christian Bales gives a complex, nuanced performance, which slowly grows as we learn more about Irving.  Amy Adams is dynamite; Bradley Cooper makes his jerk FBI agent sympathetic (but not so much that we ever truly like hime); Jeremy Renner doesn't get a whole lot to do as a pawn in the scheme, but he's clearly having fun.  Aside from Bale, it's Jennifer Lawrence who steals the scenes; like Bale's, her performance grows in complexity as the film progresses.  Sure, she's playing an older character; but it was only when a friend brought it up that I realized she's just 3 days shy of being exactly 4 years younger than me.  Like Bale, who becomes a pot-bellied, balding schlub with a combover, she nailed it.Kudos also goes to a cameo appearance from a film legend that I won't ruin, because it was a genuine (and pleasant) surprise for me.AMERICAN HUSTLE is one of those films that screams, ""Give me an Oscar!""  Perhaps David O. Russell is a little desperate at this point.  That being said, it truly is an enjoyable film, at parts funny, at parts dramatic.  It leans a bit on Scorsese's filmography (particularly GOODFELLAS), but the acting is top-notch, the script is solid, and the overall experience has a few nice thrills.  Maybe it's not worthy of 10 Oscar nominations (and no wins, another Scorsese comparison you can make), but it's certainly one of the better movie experiences out there.",4,"""You're nothing to me until you're everything.""",1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,2284,"['Imagine', 'con-artist', 'couple', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'get', 'busted', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Richie', 'who', 'help', 'nab', 'mayor', 'bunch', 'crooked', 'politicians', 'scheme', 'fake', 'sheik', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'one', 'put', 'up', 'mafia', 'Irving', 'unpredictable', 'manic-depressive', 'wife', 'Rosalyn.Sound', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'way', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'sort', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', 'homage', 'decade', 'attempt', 'hone', 'classic', 'Scorsese', 'vibe', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'style', 'bit', 'rip-off', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'paired', 'admittedly', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'fact', 'good', 'director', 'Russell', 'can', 'be', 'film', 'elevated', 'script', 'courtesy', 'Russell', 'Eric', 'Warren', 'Singer', 'featuring', 'fantastic', 'dialogue', 'true', 'emotional', 'grit', 'couple', 'nice', 'twists', 'acting', 'Christian', 'Bales', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'slowly', 'learn', 'more', 'Irving', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'dynamite', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'jerk', 'FBI', 'agent', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'ever', 'truly', 'hime', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', ""n't"", 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'do', 'pawn', 'scheme', 'clearly', 'having', 'fun', 'Aside', 'Bale', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'scenes', 'Bale', 'performance', 'grows', 'complexity', 'film', 'Sure', 'playing', 'older', 'character', 'was', 'only', 'when', 'friend', 'brought', 'up', 'realized', 'just', '3', 'days', 'shy', 'being', 'exactly', '4', 'years', 'younger', 'Bale', 'who', 'pot-bellied', 'balding', 'schlub', 'combover', 'nailed', 'it.Kudos', 'also', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'film', 'legend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'was', 'genuine', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'me.AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', 'one', 'films', 'screams', 'Give', 'Oscar', 'Perhaps', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'little', 'desperate', 'point', 'being', 'said', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'parts', 'funny', 'parts', 'dramatic', 'bit', 'Scorsese', 'filmography', 'particularly', 'GOODFELLAS', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'script', 'solid', 'overall', 'experience', 'few', 'nice', 'thrills', 'Maybe', 'not', 'worthy', '10', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'wins', 'Scorsese', 'comparison', 'can', 'make', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'movie', 'out', 'there']",N/A

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[10, 13]","&#34;American Hustle&#34; is a laugh-out-loud funny, very clever, well-produced, well-acted movie about conmen, crooked politicians, and an FBI sting operation. I enjoyed it while I was watching it but it left me empty. I didn't care about any of the characters or the plot points. I wasn't rooting for anybody and I wasn't involved in anything. Ultimately &#34;American Hustle&#34; felt been-there-done-that to me, and gimmicky and shallow. It reminded me of a lot of previous films about lovable gangsters and conmen, like &#34;Goodfellas,&#34; &#34;The Sting,&#34; and &#34;Guys and Dolls.&#34; Christian Bale as petty conman Irving Rosenfeld reminded me of Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit.The gimmicks begin as the movie opens. It opens on a shot of Christian Bale's fat and bloated stomach. Bale is famous for losing weight for his role in &#34;The Machinist.&#34; Then he became buff and muscular for &#34;Batman.&#34; For &#34;American Hustle&#34; Christian Bale gave himself a fat gut. His fat gut takes up about thirty seconds of screen time and Bale could have played the role without it. His gut took me out of the movie. I started thinking, not about the character or the plot, but about Bale's tendency to gain or lose weight for roles. I assume he's pushing for an Oscar. I felt manipulated.The plot is pretty pointless. A small time conman, Irving (Christian Bale) and his conwoman girlfriend Sydney / Edith (Amy Adams) are recruited by FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper) to snag crooked politicians, including the mayor of Camden Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) gets in the way and causes some comic mayhem. Robert DeNiro shows up as a dangerous Mafioso.The production values are very high. The costumes are outrageous: velvet tuxedos and open shirts revealing hairy chests and gold chains. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are all decked out and paraded like models. In &#34;Night at the Museum 2&#34; Amy Adams wore tight, flesh-colored jodhpurs. Everyone talks about her butt in that movie. In &#34;American Hustle&#34; she wears plunging necklines and slit skirts. Everyone will be talking about her breasts and legs.The direction is fluid and musical &#8211; you feel like you're on an amusing ride. 1970s pop hits make up the soundtrack and action is choreographed to fit the music.The movie is laugh-out-loud funny, funnier than some films billed as comedies. It's hard to tell what genre the film is meant to be, because there are scenes where characters are obviously in pain.The audience is conned as well as the characters onscreen. There is a surprise. The surprise felt pretty cheap to me. The surprise was executed not by cleverness, but simply by hiding information from the audience.The performances are all fun to watch and very strong. Problem for me was that each performance seemed to exist in its own world. Christian Bale is doing comedy and parody. He is mocking the character he plays, and low class conmen in general. Jennifer Lawrence is weak. She is pretty, pouty, and young, but I didn't catch any acting talent. Bradley Cooper, as the FBI agent, is intense and grating in his hyper ambition and lack of smarts and caution. His character never came together for me, never achieved any coherence.Amy Adams is the heart of the movie. She is fiercely intelligent, deadly, really, in her amorality and her love for her man. The real standout is Jeremy Renner as Camden, NJ, mayor Carmine Polito. Renner is from a completely straight, serious movie. He comes across not as an actor playing a role, but as the &#34;real&#34; Carmine Polito, though Polito is a fictional character based on former Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti.&#34;American Hustle&#34; depicts conflict between straight, square people who tell the truth and con artists who lie, cheat and steal. As is often the case in Hollywood films, &#34;American Hustle&#34; comes down firmly on the side of con artists. &#34;Everybody's a con artist!&#34; the film wants you to believe. &#34;Everybody lies, cheats, and steals!&#34; Hollywood would take this stance because Hollywood manufactures illusions.&#34;American Hustle&#34; alters history to make this position believable. &#34;American Hustle&#34; becomes heavy-handed in its insistence on manipulating its audience into liking two characters and disliking a third. Camden's mayor was not the saint the film wants you to think he was, and the real Irving didn't do the kindly things the film depicts him as doing. Camden, NJ, is a horrible place to live. Its population is shrinking. It ranks first in violent crime. Political corruption is rampant. In making a saint out of the mayor of Camden, David O. Russell sticks his Hollywood finger in the eye of New Jersey's poor and crime victims.",3,"Funny, Clever, Shallow, Gimmicky",1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,4785,"['34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34',

1679345,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00GMV8LIO,Darren,"[1, 2]","David O. Russell's Blast from the Past about the 1970's ABSCAM scandal resonates because it depicts an out-of-control government (here, the FBI) fueled by personal ambition and an addiction to surveillance.  Sound familiar?  The line between Right and Wrong is interestingly blurred, personified by an obnoxious and ambitious FBI agent played by Bradley Cooper, and a personally incorruptible but do-whatever-it-takes Camden, New Jersey mayor played by Jeremy Renner.  The heroes of the tale, Christian Bale and Amy Adams, con artists nabbed by Cooper to work for him as he attempts to bring down &#34;corrupt&#34; politicians, mafiosos, and whomever he else he can bust, are caught in the middle.  The moral ambiguity extends beyond the parameters of the script: Atlantic City was eventually developed as a tourist destination later in the 80s, despite the ABSCAM busts, but by sharks operating &#34;legally&#34; -- people like Donald Trump.  (At least the Mafia knew how to run hotels, unlike the Donald.)  The message here:  corruption is an important civic value.  Greasing palms is how things get done in this country.  The biggest threat to our way of life are ambitious True Believers like Cooper who would stop progress in the name of Truth, Justice, and the American Way.  By the way, movies like this don't win Best Picture awards, so no one should be surprised that it was shut out at the Oscars last month.  However, I think regular Americans, wearied by the nonsense on the news concerning government zealots spying on us in a non-Constitutional manner, are mature enough for this movie's message.The problem is the execution.  There are some plot holes.  How do Bale and Adams expect to continue loan sharking without getting killed by vengeful marks who never got their payout?  The con artists even set up shop in a building to do their sharking.  It makes no sense.  And how does Bale's gum-snapping, fingernail-blowing housewife (Jennifer Lawrence) know about Bale's affair with Amy Adams?  Adams arrives at a party and Lawrence, upon seeing her, instantly knows her to be Bale's paramour.  And yet the movie goes to some lengths to tell us that she never leaves the house and has no idea what Bale does outside their front door.  So how does she know?  Only the Cutting Room Floor knows, I guess.  (Or -- sigh -- the &#34;director's cut&#34; version.)  I'm harping on it because what happens between Lawrence and Adams in the party scene changes that scene and impacts the rest of the movie.  Beyond plot problems, the movie is simply out-of-control and over-the-top, in terms of costume design and performances.  Look, I remember 1978, and I didn't recall women walking around with cavernous decolletage down to the navel except in fashion magazines.  The men suffer worse.  Bale looks like he raided Captain Kangaroo's closet, and the complicated basketry on top of his head would only encourage people to not take him seriously as a wheeler and dealer.  Just because a movie is set in 1978 doesn't mean everyone has to look like they're refugees from Studio 54.  Most people back then dressed the way we dress today, except that the pants were a little more flared and men wore their hair a bit longer.  There were more floral designs on women's attire.  But really, that was it.  (Disagree?  Take a look at &#34;Network&#34; from 1976, for example.  Pretty normally dressed people there, and that was the very apex of the Disco Age.)  Oh well, I guess director Russell is not big on the whole &#34;less is more&#34; concept.Performances?  One thing is clear: Amy Adams has the best agent in Hollywood.  She has managed to be in almost every ensemble cast of Oscar-bait films in the past 5 years.  &#34;Doubt&#34; ... &#34;The Master&#34; ... who knows what-all.  And yet I can't cite one memorable performance from her in all those films.  She doesn't deliver here, either.  She's supposed to be playing a vamp with a past as a stripper, but she's just too wholesome to pull it off, and the tried-and-true waterworks are always at hand if all else fails.  I appreciated Jeremy Renner's work here (he's the mayor) if only because he was restrained in comparison to most of the rest of the cast.  Now -- ahem.  I know everyone loves this girl, but I'll risk the hate and suggest that if Jennifer Lawrence plays another role that's out of her depth, as here, she is going to wear out her welcome really quickly.  She's a 23-year-old kid playing a role designed for an actor in her mid-to-late 30s at the peak of her powers.  The kid has talent, all right, but it needs to be guided and restrained until she has more experience under her belt.  Russell fails Lawrence miserably by miscasting her in the role in the first place, and then by indulging her every whim -- his too, it would seem.  Christian Bale, at least, is wholly convincing once again.  What a great actor.  He is now mastering the art of understatement -- watch him after Cooper knocks off his comb-over.  Watch him again when he enters a dangerous scene and waves Cooper away from Adams with a pistol.  His performance is consistent and true to the character he plays throughout.  If only his wardrobe was as understated as he was!  Bradley Cooper, who is in many scenes with Bale, should've taken Bale's cue.  I've seen Cooper restrained in other films; all I can think is that he and Russell are friends before colleagues and therefore the actor unfortunately did whatever he liked.  The scenes where he tries to seduce Adams are truly cringeworthy, and there are several such scenes.  Time for a rom-com, Bradley.  Calm down.Finally, Louis CK almost steals the show from everyone as Cooper's dull bureaucrat boss.  Cooper:  &#34;I'm going to come over there and BEAT YOU!&#34;  CK:  &#34;What?&#34;  (Now THAT'S good screenwriting.)  He's humiliated, manipulated, and practically castrated, but he emerges triumphant anyway by trying to do the right thing.  If our government was staffed with more CKs and less Coopers, we'd all be a lot better off.  3 out of 5.",3,Corruption: an American civic value,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,6052,"['David', 'O.',

1679346,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00GMV8LIO,David A. Wend,"[3, 6]","American Hustle follows on director David O. Russell&#8217;s Silver Linings Playbook that proved to be a hit last year in 2012. American Hustle is more a madcap comedy as we follow two con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) in the late 1970&#8217;s. Irving and Sydney are kindred spirits and deeply attracted to each other, as they play off of Irving&#8217;s business loan scam where he takes $5,000 from his clients and gives nothing back. He also sells art forgeries on the side to which Sydney adds some class by affecting a British accent and turning herself into Lady Edith Greensly. Sydney eventually discovers that Irving is married to a flaky blond named Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and the two women despise each other.  All is going remarkably well until Irving and Sydney are caught scamming by an FBI agent named Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper).Richie is not the sharpest tool in the shed gets wrapped up in Irving&#8217;s stories on how he conned people. Richie thinks that in the post Watergate 70&#8217;s he can make a name for himself by setting a trap for unwary crooked politicians. Only he needs Irving and Sydney as players to pull his scheme off. Richie picks the mayor of Atlantic City Carmine Polito as his victim, who needs to rebuild his city to get people into a newly built casino.  When bribery fails to lure Polito into Richie&#8217;s trap and Arab investor is invented and Abscam is born. Little by little, the scam becomes more complicated until the mob gets interested.American Hustle is fun to watch because one never knows what is coming next, and everyone is conning someone else. Christian Bale is excellent as Irving, someone who could convince you that it&#8217;s in your interest to hand over all of your money to him. He fits into the 70&#8217;s fashion with his hair piece and comb over hiding his bald head and his loud shirts and trade mark neckerchief. Amy Adams personifies the post-1960s &#34;liberated&#8221; woman, with her loose filling clothing and lack of underwear. Her clothing gives Sydney a liberated and bold appearance that fits her character well. Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful as Irving&#8217;s manipulative wife, throwing insults at Sydney when they meet and almost blowing the scam by spilling some of the details to a mobster.  Bradley Cooper does a great job playing the ambitious but over reactive FBI agent who can barely control himself when it comes to ordering his boss to give him more money for the scam.  It was also good to see veteran actor Anthony Zerbe as Senator Horton Mitchell, brief as his part was.American Hustle is a brilliant caper film that keeps you guessing and has some very fine performances by a fantastic cast.",5,A Great Caper Film,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,2738,"['American', 'Hustle', 'director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', '8217', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'proved', 'be', 'hit', 'last', 'year', '2012', 'American', 'Hustle', 'more', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'follow', 'two', 'con', 'artists', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'late', '1970', '8217', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'are', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'deeply', 'attracted', 'other', 'play', 'Irving', '8217', 'business', 'loan', 'scam', 'where', '5,000', 'clients', 'nothing', 'back', 'also', 'art', 'forgeries', 'side', 'Sydney', 'class', 'affecting', 'British', 'accent', 'turning', 'Lady', 'Edith', 'Greensly', 'Sydney', 'eventually', 'Irving', 'married', 'flaky', 'blond', 'named', 'Rosalyn', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'two', 'women', 'despise', 'other', 'going', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'are', 'caught', 'scamming', 'FBI', 'agent', 'named', 'Richie', 'DiMaso', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', '.Richie', 'not', 'sharpest', 'tool', 'shed', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Irving', '8217', 'stories', 'how', 'conned', 'people', 'Richie', 'post', 'Watergate', '70', '8217', 'can', 'make', 'name', 'setting', 'trap', 'unwary', 'crooked', 'politicians', 'Only', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'players', 'pull', 'scheme', 'off', 'Richie', 'mayor', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Carmine', 'Polito', 'victim', 'who', 'rebuild', 'city', 'get', 'people', 'newly', 'built', 'casino', 'When', 'bribery', 'lure', 'Polito', 'Richie', '8217', 'trap', 'Arab', 'investor', 'invented', 'Abscam', 'born', 'Little', 'little', 'scam', 'more', 'complicated', 'mob', 'interested.American', 'Hustle', 'fun', 'watch', 'one', 'never', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'everyone', 'conning', 'someone', 'else', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'excellent', 'Irving', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'convince', '8217', 's', 'interest', 'hand', 'money', '70', '8217', 's', 'fashion', 'hair', 'piece', 'comb', 'hiding', 'bald', 'head', 'loud', 'shirts', 'trade', 'mark', 'neckerchief', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'post-1960s', '34', 'liberated', '8221', 'woman', 'loose', 'filling', 'clothing', 'lack', 'underwear', 'clothing', 'Sydney', 'liberated', 'bold', 'appearance', 'character', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'wonderful', 'Irving', '8217', 'manipulative', 'wife', 'throwing', 'insults', 'Sydney', 'when', 'meet', 'almost', 'blowing', 'scam', 'spilling', 'details', 'mobster', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'ambitious', 'reactive', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'control', 'when', 'ordering', 'boss', 'give', 'more', 'money', 'scam', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Senator', 'Horton', 'Mitchell', 'brief', 'part', 'was.American', 'Hustle', 'brilliant', 'caper', 'film', 'guessing', 'very', 'fine', 'performances', 'fantastic', 'cast']",N/A

If one finds greed, ambition, and corruption funny instead of tragic I guess you could call this film funny.  Personally I found it all a little ironic.  For those too young to remember events similar to what are depicted in this film  did happen.  If you find that incredible well this was the Carter Administration.  Director-writer David O. Russell expertly captures the sense of time of place from the attitudes, the music, and the fashions.  Stylistically the film is very reminiscent of Scorsese but Russell adds enough of his own flourishes to distinguish it from copycat status.  The ensemble cast assembled here is impeccable with standouts being Jeremy Renner as an entrapped New Jersey mayor and Jennifer Lawrence as a ditzy housewife.  I give Amy Adams' bad British accent the pass because her character is in fact an American stripper.  Robert De Niro has a scene-stealing cameo as a multilingual mobster.  The hair department should have gotten an Oscar for Christian Bale's hairpiece and Bradley Cooper's mini curlers.  The scene with Lawrence and the microwave oven is one for the ages.

1679348,A25AKI0F2WDE1I,B00GMV8LIO,"David B. Straus ""retired Prof.""","[0, 0]","This movie begins with the statement that 'The story is partially based on facts'. It is a fictionalized version of the Abscam case dating to 1980 in which the FBI and the rest of the Justice Department arrange a sting operation to trap a NJ senator and seven congressmen and other Jersey pols into accepting bribes to get a license for a gambling casino in Atlantic City. We are introduced to the con artists (Christian Bales & Amy Adams) assisting each other in selling fake art masterpieces to gullible citizens including the FBI (a separate sting) who have something on Adams and keep her in a bare room for three days in order to get her to get Bales to participate in the great sting. The FBI agent behind the sting, Bradley Cooper, is also a con man chasing Adams and conning his boss to get taxpayer money to set up the sting. An agent is dressed as an Arab prince who offers money through Bales to various pols starting with the Majority Leader of the NJ House, Jeremy Renner, who is portrayed as a 'good guy' only interested in supporting his community through casino-generated income, and, less clearly, Congressmen and Senators. But Renner takes money and serves his time in prison as did all the other pols.But why was a two-bit con man able to carry out such a sting? The movie suggests that it was greed on the part of the pols. This was emphasized by a cameo scene with Robert DeNiro playing a Mafia don who was offered a bribe and spoke Arabic to the agent playing the Arab prince who didn't understand him and couldn't answer in his presumed native tongue.

The start of the film doesn't represent the start of the events portrayed in the movie, but we don't know that, so the sense of bewildered confusion sets in right away. From what I can gather American Hustle is about a small time con merchant (Christian Bale) who hooks up with another con merchant (Amy Adams) to fleece various gullible folk. The FBI pounces and yet with startling speed, the agent handling the case decides to use Bale and Adams to entrap a local mayor he thinks is corrupt. The story is based very loosely on the Abscam scandal of the late 1970s and I wish it had stuck to the facts, since they can't have been as confusing as this mess.

Eastwood,"[0, 0]","AMERICAN HUSTLE (2013) is by far the best comedy-caper film I have seen in decades!The cast is uniformly excellent, the gags are genuinely funny, the dialogue is intelligent, and the plot twists are plausible but nearly always unforeseeable. And the film has a &#34;good heart&#34;! Non-traditional, unexpected kindness and generosity triumph and leave us feeling good at the end.Christian Bale sets the tone at the very start as Irving Rosenfeld, a world-class conman with a potbelly and the most amazing hair comb-over! Laughable as he is and crooked as he is, he and his partner-mistress Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) are made sympathetic to us by their voice-over comments that reveal their backgrounds, their goals, and their high-functioning mental processes.Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Richie DiMaso, a hyper-ambitious curly-haired FBI agent, who lusts for Sydney Prosser and forces her and Irving to help him entrap an array of Congressmen and a New Jersey mayor (Jeremy Renner) with a bribe-offering sting called ABSCAM.Among many loose cannons, the biggest is Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), who is receptive to the amorous advances of a powerful mobster. Will she reveal what Irving and the others are up to? Will she cause Irving to be harmed ...? Will she ...?And, as the film approaches its ending, two of the characters decide that they will take an all-new kind of control of the whole situation. And YOUR job may be to try to spot it as it happens ... IF it is happening. Or to spot it being derailed.As with that great comedy-caper film THE STING (1973; Robert Redford and Paul Newman), despite this explicit heads-up from these two characters, 999,999 viewers out of a million will be totally surprised by the outcome. But very pleasantly surprised if they've been paying attention.For me, the only factor that gives THE STING a very slight advantage over AMERICAN HUSTLE is its great musical score that featured those wonderful ragtime melodies of Scott Joplin.This film deserves a VERY strong &#34;A+&#34; grade.",5,"A+++ FOR WONDERFUL ACTING AND A PLOT AS CLEVER AS NEWMAN'S AND REDFORD'S ""THE STING""!!!",1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,2044,"['AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', '2013', 'far', 'best', 'comedy-caper', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'decades', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'gags', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'intelligent', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'plausible', 'nearly', 'always', 'unforeseeable', 'film', '34', 'good', 'heart', '34', 'Non-traditional', 'unexpected', 'kindness', 'generosity', 'triumph', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', 'end.Christian', 'Bale', 'tone', 'very', 'start', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'world-class', 'conman', 'potbelly', 'most', 'amazing', 'hair', 'comb-over', 'Laughable', 'crooked', 'partner-mistress', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'are', 'made', 'sympathetic', 'voice-over', 'comments', 'reveal', 'backgrounds', 'goals', 'high-functioning', 'mental', 'processes.Bradley', 'Cooper', 'hilarious', 'Richie', 'DiMaso', 'hyper-ambitious', 'curly-haired', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Irving', 'help', 'entrap', 'array', 'Congressmen', 'New', 'Jersey', 'mayor', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'bribe-offering', 'sting', 'called', 'ABSCAM.Among', 'many', 'loose', 'cannons', 'biggest', 'Irving', 'wife', 'Rosalyn', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'receptive', 'amorous', 'advances', 'powerful', 'mobster', 'Will', 'reveal', 'what', 'Irving', 'others', 'are', 'up', 'Will', 'cause', 'Irving', 'be', 'harmed', 'Will', 'film', 'ending', 'two', 'characters', 'decide', 'will', 'take', 'all-new', 'kind', 'control', 'whole', 'situation', 'YOUR', 'job', 'may', 'be', 'try', 'spot', 'IF', 'happening', 'spot', 'being', 'derailed.As', 'great', 'comedy-caper', 'film', 'THE', 'STING', '1973', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'explicit', 'heads-up', 'two', 'characters', '999,999', 'viewers', 'million', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'surprised', 'outcome', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', ""'ve"", 'been', 'paying', 'only', 'factor', 'THE', 'STING', 'very', 'slight', 'advantage', 'AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'featured', 'wonderful', 'ragtime', 'melodies', 'Scott', 'Joplin.This', 'film', 'VERY', 'strong', '34', 'A+', '34', 'grade']",N/A

Christian Bale and Amy Adams are absolutely first rate, and Jennifer Lawrence gets a juicy stereotype to munch on.But mostly, there is the story. Hustlers being outhustled and ending up being dragged into a hustle way out of their league. It's a long, involved process, and remarkably, it grips you throughout the length (2:09) of the film. The music helps, but the story stars. You have to pay attention, and it's worth it. The characters are clever and sharp, they live by their wits. They are pleasure to follow for once.And the risk is real, for once. Any and all of the characters could lose out, right up to their lives. That gives the film extra power, compared to all the superhero and comic book characters who you know must come through no matter what. So suspense plays a significant role too.You have take notice of the hair, of all things. Everyone's hair gets talked about, and there are several scenes of the characters doing their hair, particularly the men.

By what the critics were proclaiming, not only did I miss &#34;the best film of the year,&#34; I also slept through it. I had committed a crime against cinema- and as an avid movie-goer, I even felt like I disrespected the art form. Church is what it felt like I'd fallen asleep through, and religious heathens were the ones I felt as if I'd disappointed.So, in an effort of redemption, I took off to the movie theater that following weekend, highly caffeinated, and more than ready to experience the movie of 2013. I did not fall asleep this time. For two hours and ten minutes I watched... wondering... why my eyes were still open this second time around. &#34;American Hustle,&#34; as it turned out, is a film coasting on the popularity of those involved.The narrative fails to engross and relies completely upon its actors to get the audience through it all. In doing that, the acting is almost always distractingly scenery-chewing. Jennifer Lawrence hams it up in a part meant for someone older; Christian Bale's make up is thicker than his Jersey accent, and everyone else is just deflecting. Louis C.K. is the only one who steals the show simply because it's with very little effort.David O. Russell, creator of some of my favorites (&#34;Flirting With Disaster,&#34; &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34;), is the manufacturer of only a decent product here. &#34;American Hustle&#34; is never bad. There are moments that hold interest, but many more that don't. More importantly, there's a showing off-ness permeating throughout the picture that can never be shaken and a glorified reputation that it never amounts to.In a way, &#34;American Hustle&#34; feels like this monster that climbed the Empire State Building to declare its height, but falls to its death in the process.

1679374,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00GMV8LIO,Doug Anderson,"[1, 2]","Most Hollywood films celebrate working class values and no film does that better this year than AMERICAN HUSTLE. What's weird about this movie though is that neither of the characters who are trying to do good are rewarded but both of the hustlers get exactly what they want: each other. Neither the Bale or Adams characters are loyal to their class (they'll hustle anyone) but they are ultimately loyal to each other. Bale is maybe the more sympathetic character (his schemes are just about money but he really doesn't want to hurt anyone) but the Adams character is far more mysterious, she hustles people not just for money but to prove something to herself -- to prove to herself that life is not determined by the accident of birth or class affiliation. Her roles are opportunities to explore her sexuality, intellect, imagination, and sense of play. To her the real is not some stable property/commodity with a fixed value but whatever you believe it is and get others to believe it is. Although the film like most other Hollywood films praises working class types, it undermines the notion that working class types are one-dimensional and/or incapable of participating not just in the American dream of social mobility but the even more compelling dream of identity mobility. Director David O Russell is clearly on the side of the working class and he loves showing working class types enjoying working class pleasures but in American Hustle he adds at least one new pleasure to the working class repertoir: the joy of conning people from the upper classes. At the beginning of the film Bale and Adams will con anyone regardless of class but by the end of the film they have affirmed their class loyalty and only after doing this do they seem to understand themselves and to be as merry if not as socialist as Robin Hood. American Hustle does play like a Scorsese film with one important difference: the racketeering raconteurs in America Hustle actually find a way to go legitimate (or at least as legitimate as any Modern ""artist"" can be). So what you have in American Hustle is the first existentially complex working class con dramedy.

1679377,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00GMV8LIO,Doug Park,"[1, 2]","{3.5 stars}AMERICAN HUSTLE is a whimsical social satire on greed and the amoral rat & mouse game of FBI/governmental entrapment, with a lot of insightful stuff about the world of appearances, selfish human agendas, and the phoniness in general behind them all. Set in the late 1970s, it captures (and ridicules) that era very well, especially with its use of 70s theme music for specific scenes.While AMERICAN HUSTLE kept my attention throughout its two-plus-hour length, it may move a little too slowly for some tastes and could definitely use more hard tension. Much of the persistent humor is of the smirk-guffaw variety. There are also frequent attempts at lol-slapstick, but the exploding microwaves and one guy beating another over the head with a telephone just aren't particularly funny. This film would probably have worked better if it had just stuck to dry satirical humor, keeping the one hilarious exception of the impromptu after-the-big-bust party by the feds. Anyway, there are some twisty surprises here and there, not all of which are very believable, and it ties up a bit too easily at the end. Though AMERICAN HUSTLE works well as light but meaningful entertainment, the fact that it just doesn't go as far and deep as it could have keeps it from being the rip-roaring success it might have been. Better plotting, more suspense, and sharper surprise elements could have won that Oscar.All the same, Christian Bale (as not-so-bad-a-guy con artist Irving Rosenfeld), Amy Adams (as Rosenfeld's indispensable cohort Sydney Prosser), and Bradley Cooper (as self-serving FBI agent Richie DiMaso) give some nice performances here, with special kudos going to Jeremy Renner as Mayor/FBI target Carmine Polito.",4,"""The art of survival is a story that never ends""",1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,1721,"['3.5', 'stars', 'AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', 'whimsical', 'social', 'satire', 'greed', 'amoral', 'rat', 'mouse', 'game', 'FBI/governmental', 'entrapment', 'lot', 'insightful', 'stuff', 'world', 'appearances', 'selfish', 'human', 'agendas', 'phoniness', 'general', 'Set', 'late', '1970s', 'ridicules', 'era', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'use', '70s', 'theme', 'music', 'specific', 'scenes.While', 'AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', 'kept', 'attention', 'two-plus-hour', 'length', 'may', 'move', 'little', 'too', 'slowly', 'tastes', 'could', 'definitely', 'use', 'more', 'hard', 'tension', 'Much', 'persistent', 'humor', 'smirk-guffaw', 'variety', 'are', 'also', 'frequent', 'attempts', 'lol-slapstick', 'exploding', 'microwaves', 'one', 'guy', 'beating', 'head', 'telephone', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'funny', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'stuck', 'dry', 'satirical', 'humor', 'keeping', 'one', 'hilarious', 'exception', 'impromptu', 'after-the-big-bust', 'party', 'feds', 'Anyway', 'are', 'twisty', 'surprises', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'easily', 'end', 'AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', 'well', 'light', 'meaningful', 'entertainment', 'fact', 'just', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'deep', 'could', 'have', 'keeps', 'being', 'rip-roaring', 'success', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Better', 'plotting', 'more', 'suspense', 'sharper', 'surprise', 'elements', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar.All', 'same', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'not-so-bad-a-guy', 'con', 'artist', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Rosenfeld', 'indispensable', 'cohort', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'self-serving', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Richie', 'DiMaso', 'give', 'nice', 'performances', 'here', 'special', 'kudos', 'going', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Mayor/FBI', 'target', 'Carmine', 'Polito']",N/A

In both works, the principal center of attention is on the psychology of conning; how people can render themselves perfectly plausible to their victims and get away with it.  However there is one important difference: whereas the earlier film took a jokey approach to the subject-matter (complete with Scott Joplin-inspired ragtime score), AMERICAN HUSTLE takes a long hard look at the lives of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and sidekick Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), and shows how their lives are fundamentally empty.  Although Rosenfeld protests his enduring love for his wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), it's clear that his main focus of attention is on sustaining the con.  When it threatens to get out of hand, he tries to withdraw, but finds himself unable to do so.  Likewise Sydney; although she is a masterly impersonator of a British aristocrat, she has nothing much else to fall back on.  In the world of late 70s New York, it is every person for themselves - even the cop Richie DiMasso (Bradley Cooper) is out to exploit everyone around him.  In the end, Irving and Sydney come to a decision - the only way to extricate themselves from difficulty is to plan the ultimate con.  Their lives will not improve as a result, but at least they will be safe for a while.  AMERICAN HUSTLE is a long, controlled, brilliantly acted movie.  Director Russell's camera focuses on the protagonists in minute detail, taking a long hard look at their relationships, while suggesting that such relationships only work if the con works successfully.  If the con fails, then relationships come crashing down.  The late Seventies New York atmosphere is brilliantly evoked; the city is both attractive yet terribly seedy, a place where only the fittest survive.  The soundtrack, with hits from the period, only serves to enhance this mood.  This film has been nominated for several awards, and justifiably so.",5,Excellent Character-Focused Study of the Conperson's Mentality,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,2029,"['viewers', 'long', 'memories', 'might', 'notice', 'resemblances', 'David', 'OI', 'Russell', 'film', 'George', 'Roy', 'Hill', 'THE', 'STING', 'works', 'principal', 'center', 'attention', 'psychology', 'conning', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'render', 'perfectly', 'plausible', 'victims', 'get', 'away', 'However', 'one', 'important', 'difference', 'earlier', 'film', 'took', 'jokey', 'approach', 'subject-matter', 'complete', 'Scott', 'Joplin-inspired', 'ragtime', 'score', 'AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', 'long', 'hard', 'look', 'lives', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'sidekick', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'how', 'lives', 'are', 'fundamentally', 'empty', 'Rosenfeld', 'enduring', 'love', 'wife', 'Rosalyn', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'clear', 'main', 'focus', 'attention', 'sustaining', 'con', 'When', 'get', 'hand', 'withdraw', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'Likewise', 'Sydney', 'masterly', 'impersonator', 'British', 'aristocrat', 'nothing', 'much', 'else', 'fall', 'back', 'world', 'late', '70s', 'New', 'York', 'person', 'even', 'cop', 'Richie', 'DiMasso', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'out', 'exploit', 'everyone', 'end', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'come', 'decision', 'only', 'way', 'extricate', 'difficulty', 'plan', 'ultimate', 'con', 'lives', 'will', 'not', 'improve', 'result', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'safe', 'while', 'AMERICAN', 'HUSTLE', 'long', 'controlled', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'movie', 'Director', 'Russell', 'camera', 'protagonists', 'minute', 'detail', 'taking', 'long', 'hard', 'look', 'relationships', 'suggesting', 'such', 'relationships', 'only', 'work', 'con', 'successfully', 'con', 'then', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'late', 'Seventies', 'New', 'York', 'atmosphere', 'brilliantly', 'evoked', 'city', 'attractive', 'yet', 'terribly', 'seedy', 'place', 'where', 'only', 'fittest', 'survive', 'soundtrack', 'hits', 'period', 'only', 'enhance', 'mood', 'film', 'been', 'nominated', 'several', 'awards', 'justifiably', 'so']",N/A

While the titular hustle is, obviously, the driving force behind this film's plot, the lion's share of its effort is spent inspecting the players themselves, rendering each from a variety of different angles and lights. In fact, the first two acts concentrate almost exclusively on the cast, to the detriment of the heist itself - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a different approach than I'd  expected. Of course, that ratio is flipped on its head in time for the climax, when our slick set of con (wo)men abruptly realize they're in way over their heads and the audience lets out a collective gasp; &#34;Oh, crap.&#34; Predictably, the A-list actors hit all of their notes with sly ease, with the best - Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence - completely disappearing into their roles.

Russell is quickly making a name for himself, and after seeing this movie, there'll be no letting up on the buzz he's creating.Here's the scoop. Irving Rosenberg (Christian Bale) has a few small businesses in Jersey but he also dabbles in small time cons. He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who is looking to changer her life. They up the con game together but get stung by FBI guy Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who holds them ransom so they can provide him with cons involving much bigger fish. They agree but all might be in over their heads in this game and it all gets really messy.This has it all. It has a great script. I would need to view it again to untangle all the cons and schemes but it's smart to a ""T."" The script also gives us great characters who are played tremendously well by an equally great cast. There are no confusing these folks. Each is distinct. And each has an agenda. How far will they go to get what they want? Who's playing who? It has great direction. Russell always seems to know where to put the camera and made certain his set designers, wardrobe folk et al gave this a right on look of mid 70s New Jersey.Back to the actors. Christian Bale emaciated himself for his role in ""The Machinist."" He was as buff as could be in the Batman movies. Here he puts on weight and sports a near reprehensible comb-over. Amy Adams has a couple of scenes where it appears she's wearing no makeup whatsoever. How many actresses would do that? Jennifer Lawrence is just plain great. This is unlike any role I'd ever seen her in. Her knack for turning something she screwed up into something she feels she should be thanked for put me in stitches. Brad Cooper is a real weird one as the FBI agent. He, like most of the other characters, has a hair issue. Jeremy Renner, as Mayor Carl Polito manages to turn a guy from someone you're supposed to think ill of to someone you genuinely feel sorry for is spot on.I could go on but why bore.

1679402,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GMV8LIO,FNDNreview,"[2, 4]","David O. Russell has become a household name in Hollywood and also amongst many avid moviegoers. While he&#8217;s had several projects over the years, he really bust on to the scene in 2010 as the director of The Fighter &#8211; which starred Christian Bale and Amy Adams, both of whom were nominated for multiple awards for their individual supporting roles (Bale won both an Academy Award and Golden Globe). Flash forward two years and that brings us to 2012 where Russell once again made his mark on the big screen by penning the script (originally created by Matthew Quick) and directing Silver Linings Playbook. The film starred Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, both of whom earned several nominations for various awards of their own (Lawrence won both an Academy Award and Golden Globe). Now, here we are one year later as these four well-established actors star in Russell&#8217;s newest film, American Hustle.In American Hustle, Christian Bale stars as a con artist named Irving Rosenfeld. One day, he meets an attractive woman at a party named Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), who he immediately falls for and brings in to his racket. Together, the two are so successful conning people (approving loans, selling fake art, etc.) that it attracts the FBI. Sydney, working alongside Irving under a false name, is busted and taken into custody by an ambitious agent, named Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). In order to clear Sydney&#8217;s name, Irving and Sydney must work undercover alongside Richie to complete four major busts.Posing with the fake financial backing of the foreign Sheik Abdullah (Michael Pe&ntilde;a), the trio goes into business with the crooked New Jersey Mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). The beloved, yet crooked Mayor has a vision of returning Atlantic City to prominence and also creating thousands of new jobs. However, in order to do so, he must secure finances &#8211; which means he is willing to partner-up with the mob. The backroom dealings with the mob also require a few acts of Congress, leading to the eventual bribing of a handful of Congressmen and one Senator. However, the only thing that can screw everything up is Irving&#8217;s wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), who has a flare for the dramatic and constantly requires attention.From the moment this film begins until the very end, it&#8217;s relatively safe to say there&#8217;s no film in the history of cinema that depicts this much hustling, cheating, and lying. In the event that any one of the characters walked into a church, it would positively go up in flames. Irving is hustling Sydney, and she loves him for it. Rosalyn is hustling Irving, and he hates her for it. Richie hustles Sydney and Irving, while Sydney is constantly hustling Richie. Richie and company are hustling the mob, the Mayor, and members of Congress &#8211; and the FBI is behind all of it. There is literally no one in this film that isn&#8217;t hustled at one point or another.To that end, you need accomplished actors and actresses that are capable of selling these onscreen hustles, and with that being said, there might not be a more perfect ensemble in the history of filmmaking than the four individuals featured in this film. David O. Russell clearly had the unspeakably brilliant epiphany to bring the four highly acclaimed cast members from The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook together for one incredible feature. He even sneaks in (SPOILER) Robert De Niro from a perfectly timed cameo. And, the end result is a masterful work of art.Christian Bale is the focal point of this character-driven story. For whatever reason, Bale needed to be overweight and balding for the role and also suffers from a serious heart condition. However, before you jump to any conclusions, it should be noted that none of these elements are vital to the story. Bale&#8217;s character is too confident to let his physical appearance hinder his appetite for the hustle. And confident he most certainly is &#8211; proving he&#8217;s almost too good to be caught. He lives his life through one of the film&#8217;s most prudent themes: the art of survival.Jennifer Lawrence is obviously a huge star these days, especially since he roles The Hunger Games films, along with the X-Men films and Silver Linings Playbook. Those films are all fine and dandy, but they are targeted towards a particular audience and will likely succeed with or without her involvement. Lawrence proves her talent, not by shooting arrows at people, but by taking on serious, well-written dramatic roles. Once more, Lawrence steals each and every scene in which she&#8217;s present (mostly with her humorous nut ball comments) &#8211; and she does so with such elegance. Like her role in Silver Linings Playbook, she portrays a mentally disturbed individual with serious emotional distress. Even though she&#8217;s only present for a handful of scenes in this film, she&#8217;s still a main attraction, even despite the scene dominance of her wondrous cast mates.While it&#8217;s easy to see the outstanding performances of Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence, the impressive acting of Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams shouldn&#8217;t go unnoticed. Neither gives an over-the-top, career defining performance, but they are equally acclaim worthy. Cooper, more so than Adams, shows just how far he&#8217;s come in Hollywood &#8211; going from comedy to action and now fully establishing himself as a serious dramatic actor. Of course, Amy Adams is already a domineering presence in dramatic acting, so the fact that she puts on an amazing performance is no surprise at all. The scenes that Cooper and Adams share together are remarkably energetic, and are proof that despite what you may think you see, the hustle never ends. Never.Overall, it&#8217;s not surprising that so many have praised America Hustle as one of the top films of 2013. There&#8217;s little doubt this film tries to make hustling look cool &#8211; and it succeeds. It also doesn&#8217;t fail to make these ambitious characters look cool &#8211; with their flashy hair, scantily clad outfits, and smooth dialog. No, this film doesn&#8217;t have the satisfying payoff that you&#8217;d expect from a movie like Ocean&#8217;s 11, but it does prove that crime-centric films are still unbelievably entertaining. Obviously, there are drawbacks to seeing this film. Most notably, there is no action-packed shootouts or ridiculous CGI. American Hustle is simply a film where acting and character development come first, while everything else, like plot and tying up loose ends comes second. If drama is your fancy, this film will plain and simply knock your socks off.GRADE:  AFNDNreview.com",5,"Prepare to be dazzled in the crime drama, 'American Hustle'",1387497600,"12 20,

1679407,A28C7103WO6CPD,B00GMV8LIO,Fuinnimh,"[5, 8]","Knowing the pedigree of a movie, not only who the stars are, but who the director is, who the writers are, can easily help us separate the mutts from the pure breeds in the movie world. And if the pedigree is one of huge prior success of many of these elements then that augurs well for the success of this movie.David O Russell directed the highly regarded The Fighter from two years ago which secured 7 Academy Award nominations, Academy Awards for Christian Bale and Melissa Leo,and a nomination for Amy Adams.He wrote and directed Silver Linings Playbook one of the outstanding movies of 2011/12, which secured an Academy Award for Jennifer Lawrence last year, and a total of four acting nominations including Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, and nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.American Hustle reunites Russell, De Niro, Bale, Lawrence and Adams from these previous two hits, and continues the outstanding pedigree displayed in those movies.Loosely based on the 1970s Abscam scandal, this is a multi-layered entertaining movie, involving a con man and his mistress, played by Bale and Adams, an emotionally tempestuous wife played by Jennifer Lawrence, organized crime elements represented by De Niro and others, and law enforcement interests played by Bradley Cooper.I remember an interview Amy Adams gave two years where she complained that a journalist wrote that she did not have a sexual image at which she took great umbrage. Perhaps this was due to characters she played such as the Princess in Enchanted, or the nun in Doubt. She lays that particular criticism to rest in this movie playing a very sexual character, who wears skin clinging outfits, and no bra, ever. This all works to create a very alluring persona, and so she really pushes the envelope in this movie. I think her performance is the most memorable and nuanced of all the actors. Bale's character has a glued on comb over and that hairy thing does not fool anyone.The other memorable performance that distinguishes this movie is that of Jennifer Lawrence. Two scenes in particular, one where she and her husbands mistress have a confrontation with an interesting turn. Very amusing.The other a spectacularly messed up scene which I call the 'power of intention,' scene which had the whole theater laughing and for me was worth the price of admission. Another scene where she intensely lip-syncs I also found highly amusing.Amy Adams has been nominated for Academy Awards four times for Junebug, Doubt, The Fighter , and The Master, without winning yet. Maybe this will be her year. I think she has shown great variety and ability in her roles. I particularly liked her turn as a rough tough warrior type role in The Fighter.One thing that can be said for David O Russell, he knows how to write good roles for actors as all the acting nominations indicate. American Hustle has been nominated for seven Golden Globe awards, which augurs well for its Oscar ambitions.American Hustle opened in limited release in the USA on December 13th 2013, achieving a highly impressive $76,000,000 in only three weeks of release. The movies most likely to win awards are mostly released in December perfectly timed for awards season, and this is definitely a cut above most movies you will see this year with some highly memorable scenes.I think most people will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",4,I admit she is sexy,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,3407,"['Knowing', 'pedigree', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'stars', 'are', 'who', 'director', 'who', 'writers', 'are', 'can', 'easily', 'help', 'separate', 'mutts', 'pure', 'movie', 'world', 'pedigree', 'one', 'huge', 'prior', 'success', 'many', 'elements', 'then', 'well', 'success', 'movie.David', 'O', 'Russell', 'directed', 'highly', 'regarded', 'Fighter', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'secured', '7', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'nomination', 'Amy', 'Adams.He', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'one', 'outstanding', 'movies', '2011/12', 'secured', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'last', 'year', 'total', 'four', 'acting', 'nominations', 'including', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay.American', 'Hustle', 'Russell', 'De', 'Niro', 'Bale', 'Lawrence', 'Adams', 'previous', 'two', 'hits', 'outstanding', 'pedigree', 'displayed', 'movies.Loosely', 'based', '1970s', 'Abscam', 'scandal', 'multi-layered', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'involving', 'con', 'man', 'mistress', 'played', 'Bale', 'Adams', 'emotionally', 'tempestuous', 'wife', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'organized', 'crime', 'elements', 'represented', 'De', 'Niro', 'others', 'law', 'enforcement', 'interests', 'played', 'Bradley', 'Cooper.I', 'remember', 'interview', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'gave', 'two', 'years', 'where', 'complained', 'journalist', 'wrote', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'sexual', 'image', 'took', 'great', 'umbrage', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'characters', 'played', 'such', 'Princess', 'Enchanted', 'nun', 'Doubt', 'particular', 'criticism', 'rest', 'movie', 'playing', 'very', 'sexual', 'character', 'who', 'skin', 'clinging', 'outfits', 'bra', 'ever', 'create', 'very', 'alluring', 'persona', 'so', 'really', 'envelope', 'movie', 'think', 'performance', 'most', 'memorable', 'nuanced', 'actors', 'Bale', 'character', 'glued', 'comb', 'hairy', 'thing', 'not', 'fool', 'anyone.The', 'other', 'memorable', 'performance', 'movie', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Two', 'scenes', 'particular', 'one', 'where', 'husbands', 'mistress', 'have', 'confrontation', 'interesting', 'turn', 'Very', 'amusing.The', 'other', 'spectacularly', 'messed', 'up', 'scene', 'call', ""'power"", 'intention', 'scene', 'had', 'whole', 'theater', 'laughing', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'scene', 'where', 'intensely', 'lip-syncs', 'also', 'found', 'highly', 'amusing.Amy', 'Adams', 'been', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'four', 'times', 'Junebug', 'Doubt', 'Fighter', 'Master', 'winning', 'yet', 'Maybe', 'will', 'be', 'year', 'think', 'shown', 'great', 'variety', 'ability', 'roles', 'particularly', 'liked', 'turn', 'rough', 'tough', 'warrior', 'type', 'role', 'Fighter.One', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'David', 'O', 'Russell', 'how', 'write', 'good', 'roles', 'actors', 'acting', 'nominations', 'indicate', 'American', 'Hustle', 'been', 'nominated', 'seven', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'awards', 'well', 'Oscar', 'ambitions.American', 'Hustle', 'opened', 'limited', 'release', 'USA', 'December', '13th', '2013', 'achieving', 'highly', 'impressive', '76,000,000', 'only', 'three', 'weeks', 'release', 'movies', 'most', 'likely', 'win', 'awards', 'are', 'mostly', 'released', 'December', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'awards', 'season', 'definitely', 'cut', 'most', 'movies', 'will', 'see', 'year', 'highly', 'memorable', 'scenes.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

Strange it was so highly honored by everybody but the Oscars. If ever there were a candidate for Best Ensemble Cast AMERICAN HUSTLE wins hands down. Loosely based on the Abscam, which for those who have forgotten, 'Abscam--sometimes written ABSCAM--was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the Bureau's Hauppauge, Long Island, office in the late 1970s and early '80s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI, aided by a convicted con-man, videotaped politicians as they were offered bribes by a fictional Middle Eastern sheik in return for various political favors. The investigation ultimately led to the conviction of a United States Senator, six members of the United States House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.' Given that bit of reality, Russell and cast and crew created a stingingly brittle yet funny movie.AMERICAN HUSTLE is set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation. It tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down. Elisabeth R&ouml;hm is Carmine tacky wife, Louis C. K. plays Stoddard Thorsen, Michael Pe&ntilde;a is the Mexican man pulled in to impersonate Sheik Abduklah, Alessandro Nivola is the smarmy Anthony Amado, and Jack Huston is the guy Rosalyn goes after - Pete Musane.The costumes, hair, clothes, music and sets mirror the tacky 70s and make us all remember how over the top we were. But setting the core of reality for this fictional movie aside, here are some of the finest acting performances on film to savour.

Why are all the critics raving about it, and WHY is this movie winning all the awards? Loosely based on the Abscam stings of the late 70's and early 80's, I did think the acting was very good, and anyone who could dream up this screenplay deserves some type of recognition. For me, it was an overlong parade of Amy Adams displaying $8,000 worth of hair extensions, and clothing cut to her navel, Christian Bale with a pathetic comb over, Jeremy Renner with a ridiculous pompadour, and Bradley Cooper with his white man's afro. At least the ""dos"" gave me which gave me something to watch, because otherwise the movie was pointless, and actually, boring. My biggest thought watching it was, when is thing going to end? Reading about all the praise being heaped on this movie, proved to me, critics don't always know what they are talking about, so don't take their reviews as gospel.

However there are so many co-ordinates to this film. Other than introducing me to an Arabeque White Rabbit, the film kind of re-introduced me to Amy Adams. The plot is simple but the direction wears you out to the extent you sense the film's loss. This is one of those rare films with a thunderous cast yet it leaves you feeling mixed emotions.There is no doubt in my mind that American Hustle had its moments but the overall product left me feeling a bit thwarted and reminded me of my own self importance as the audience. You see, it tested with its own temperament by temperament. Does anyone else feel they would have done so much better with a better director? Imagine a Martin Scorsese on this set, he would make it so much more thick. Or imagine Ron Howard doing this film, he would make it lovely.I personally think there are two reasons the film failed and one of those two reasons is Bradley Cooper's character.

When he meets Amy Adams and her wardrobe of low, low cut dresses (her boobs ought to get a best supporting credit in this flick) it's love and larceny at first sight. Unfortunately Bale has a cray crazy Jennifer Lawrence at home, who blackmails him into staying in the marriage by using their son as a marker.

What we have is a great cast of talented actors in a seriously depressing story about con artists, criminals and reasonably decent people being tricked into taking bribes. The movie is loosely based on the FBI ABSCAM operation that took down several political figures. AMERICAN HUSTLE seems to juggle the facts and create their own version of history.The actors must have gotten into character.  Christian Bale gained weight for the film and has an awful comb-over bald balding hairstyle, lovely Amy Adams shows extreme cleavage and Bradley Cooper has the worst curled hair known in the 1970's. Jennifer Lawrence is also all hairdo and little substance. What does one make of this?The characters are troubled and not likeable, except for one, and he pays the price for his decency.  Jeremy Renner plays Carmine Polito, the mayor of Camden, New Jersey. Here's another character with seriously strange hair--a mountain of hair piled on a little head. It must a theme in this film. He's the good guy of the film, the closest thing to a hero in this film. He loves his wife and children and is doing the best for his city, yet he is the victim of the scam. It is hard to watch a good guy innocently take the fall but again history tells a different story.An Aran Sheik is needed to finance Polito's dream of bringing a casino to Camden. The FBI beings in a Mexican-American (Micahel Pena) to double as a Sheik. Hey, and add in an aged Robert DeNiro, again with really bad hair to be the mob kingpin.Does any of this even remotely make sense?AMERICAN HUSTLE may have gotten a lot of praise but it can be a hard movie to watch.

1679458,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00GMV8LIO,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[4, 6]","David O. Russell started out as a director with a vision; he made the incredibly challenging films SPANKING THE MONKEY and THREE KINGS, and as the years went on, he seemed to tire of making films with something to say, and opted for performance-based Oscar bait. Both THE FIGHTER and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK are not bad films in the least, but neither of them really do anything to subvert audience expectations. Either of those films could have been directed by just about anyone. AMERICAN HUSTLE has a little of the former and a lot of the latter, but toes the line just enough to keep you interested and invested, and for once with Russell's recent films, you don't know how it's going to end.AMERICAN HUSTLE is a highly fictionalized accounting of the real life Abscam scandals of the late 70's that involved some low to mid-level elected government officials as well as the Mob, and how it took a couple of con artists to teach the FBI how to properly catch them. You have Irving (Christian Bale) and his lover/partner Sydney aka Lady Edith (Amy Adams) as a great short-con artist team, as well as Irving's incredibly unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) on the ""family"" side. But once Irving and Sydney are busted by young FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper), they're behind the eight-ball. But Richie has bigger fish he wants to fry. He's sick of government corruption and wants to go after those who want to use their elected positions to accept graft, and in Irving and Lady Edith, he sees an opportunity to learn what they have to teach. He agrees to drop the many fraud charges against them if they will assist him in four arrests, and they reluctantly agree. The first person Richie wants to go after is Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), the beloved family-man mayor of Camden, New Jersey. Polito seems to be looking to get funds to assist with the renovation of Atlantic City to help create thousands of jobs his constituents desperately need. Once it gets to a certain point, though, thanks in no small part to the emotionally manipulative Rosalyn and the increasingly desperate Richie, Irving and Sydney seem to have no way out of what they themselves have been manipulated into.Russell keeps the film at a really solid rhythm all throughout, and the actors, including Louie C.K. as Richie's FBI superior and a cameo by Robert De Niro as a feared Miami mob underboss, are all stellar. Bale continues to amaze with another chameleonic performance; Cooper gives what I would consider to be the performance of his career; Lawrence keeps hitting the bullseye film after film and is arguably the strongest actor of her generation and this performance is no exception; Renner gets past his misstep from being in HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS to being more on par with the performances he's given in the past. The strongest performer here for me is Adams, who always does incredibly solid work, but here, she's given a role within a role that she plays with gusto, intelligence, sexiness, and total confidence.My main complaint about this film, though, is how it really does seem to be Scorsese-lite. Many indie filmmakers seem to feel the need to ape Scorcese at some point in their careers, and while it works in this film, I would have liked much more to see a film that was more of Russell's and less of a 70's-era homage.All in all, AMERICAN HUSTLE is exciting and entertaining filmmaking that could have used a boost of originality, but let's face it: Russell seems to really just want to get that Oscar.

This chaotic R-rated mess was inspired by the late 70s Abscam mess which involved the FBI, the Mafia, a Middle Eastern Sheik and many elected officials. I never got it straight when it was happening and I scarcely did much better today.Nominated for seven (7!) Golden Globes: Best Picture - Comedy or Musical; Best Actor and Actress; Best Supporting Actor and Actress; Best Director and Best Screenplay. I would suggest they also include Best Hair. In my opinion this one is head and shoulders above many other high-profile films because it's so much fun! Director David O. Russell (""The Fighter"") keeps things humming along and draws extremely natural performances from his cast.We enjoy:* Christian Bale (""The Dark Knight"") as Irving (the names have been changed to protect the innocent), a two-bit flim-flam man lured into an entrapment scheme by an ambitious FBI agent. This time Bale is a stooped, paunchy, married schlub with the most tortured toupee and cockamamie comb-over I have ever seen.* Jennifer Lawrence (""Silver Linings Playbook"") is his wife Rosalyn, who knows Irving has a mistress but can't see why that should have any effect on their marriage. He has adopted her son and doesn't want to lose him. Her hairdo is a stylist's combo of ""Big Hair"" and ""Outrageous Hair."" She HATES that new-fangled ""science oven"" (microwave) because she ignored the warning and tried to heat a foil container. Eek!* Amy Adams (""Her"") is Sidney, Irving's partner in crime, both in and out of bed. Sometimes she's British, sometimes she's from Albuquerque. We see a LOT of Sidney in this one! She spends a lot of time with her hair in huge rollers.* Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover"") is Richie, the manic FBI man. He moves the outlandish plot forward by sheer force of will and is unforgettable with his hair in those teeny permanent wave rollers. Cooper and Adams generate some real sexual heat in this one. Whew!* Michael Pe&ntilde;a (""End of Watch"") is Paco, a Hispanic from California recruited to play the Sheik. His hair is covered by a pseudo white cloth with a black band to make him look Middle Eastern.* Jeremy Renner (""The Town"") is the Mayor. He is the only (sorta) ""Good Guy"" in the bunch, with a glamorous wife and five children, all of whom he adores. Check out his heroic pompadour!Kudos to Susan Jacobs for assembling the wonderful sound track: Everything from Duke Ellington and Steely Dan to ""Yellow Brick Road"" and ""Live and Let Die.""

1679494,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B00GMV8LIO,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[2, 2]","American Hustle is a disappointing chaotic and beautiful mess of a film with a plot that becomes convoluted with every con, twist and turn, and by the end you won't care about the plot, and leave the theater wondering what you just watched. American Hustle is thankfully saved by the excellent cast, and the eclectic cast of characters in the film.Yes I was a little disappointed with American Hustle, and the overall plot of the film. Thankfully what makes American Hustle such a good film are the actors and cast of characters. Christian Bale stars as Irving Rosenfeld a small time business man who owns a few dry cleaners, but makes most of his money as a con artist. The character is balding, overweight with heart problems, but doesn't let his limitations stop him from getting what he wants. It was a welcome change to see Bale in such a different role from the suave good looking dark knight Bruce Wayne, and Bale again shines as Rosenfeld. Just like Rosenfeld, Sydney Prosser is determined to escape her old miserable life as a stripper into Edith Greensly. Amy Adams is superb playing the dangerous, sexy, and complicated Sydney. While Rosenfeld and Prosser find love together a con artist is a con artist and will con even the people he or she loves like having an adopted son, and Rosalyn Rosenfeld a stay at home unhinged wife who is terrified of change. Now Lawrence was funny playing the fierce Rosalyn with raw and primal energy, and Rosalyn slowly grows throughout the film, but it wasn't Lawrence's best performance of her career, and not her best performance this year. Still even with it not being her best performance Lawrence still shines throughout the film, and is worthy of an Oscar nomination.As for the rest of the cast the majority of them gave good performances. Michael Pe&ntilde;a was great playing a FBI agent who poses as Sheik Abdullah, and Robert De Niro was splendid in his brief role as Victor Tellegio. The only questionable acting choice or character in American Hustle was Jeremy Renner as Mayor Carmine Polito. While I like Renner, and know the character was necessary in the plot for Irving to come to some realizations the actor and character just didn't seem to fit, and left the role lacking throughout the film. I am somewhat divided on Richard DiMaso and actor Bradley Cooper. I know director David O. Russell loves to bring out the dark and crazy side of his characters displaying to the world that we're all have a few screws loose, but Russell and Cooper to DiMaso to the extreme as the FBI agent entraps Irving, and Sydney forcing them to help him nap other criminals. While at times laughed and really enjoyed Cooper playing the ambitious DiMaso the character could at times be off-putting and just plain annoying, but with the quality of acting, and Russell's directing these small flaws didn't keep me from enjoying the film.I guess I should speak briefly about the plot as that was what I had the biggest problem with while watching American Hustle. The film is very loosely based on events in the 1970's, and written by Eric Warren Singer and David O. Russell. The plot involving DiMaso using Irving, and Sydney to get an ever growing number of politician and criminals becomes more convoluted as the stakes get higher, and everyone is conning, and using each other to get what they desire out of the situation. That plot drags on for too long, and by the end I just didn't care about that part of the story, and if you look at it that way, and just focus on the great cast of characters, and how the plot is there for the characters to evolve grow, and change than the story does work.David O. Russell is at his best crafting great characters, and bringing out the best in his actors as he has done in Silver Linings Playbook, Three Kings, and The Fighter, and continues to do so here with American Hustle. There is something I've noticed with his directing. Russell loves writing flawed and slightly unhinged characters as well as dipping his feet into the darkness of those said characters yet never truly submerging into the darkness which I enjoy, and continues to do so here with American Hustle. Russell could have easily taken a darker turn with the film, but wanted to display people's ability to change, and grow showing everyone has hope for the future no matter how messed up they are, and I enjoy that about Russell. If there was a flaw to his directing of American Hustle it would be in his writing, and how he put the film together, but I believe what we got was Russell's attention all along, and it just didn't work completely on film, and again that was a small complaint to Russell great directing job in American Hustle.American Hustle does disappoint in the story department most likely keeping the film from being nominated or being a serious contender for best picture award at the Oscars, American Hustle certainly doesn't disappoint in every other department from an excellent cast that includes Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Robert De Niro, Jennifer Lawrence, and Bradly Cooper where Lawrence, Adams, and Bale are the crowning jewels giving Oscar worth performances to the wonderful out of this world characters that spring to life as well as the music, and top not directing by David O. Russell making American Hustle a film that shouldn't be missed",4,"Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Jennifer Lawrence give Oscar worth performances in the flawed, but still downright

Basically, this is a snitch flick with a moral, that is, when it comes to good and bad there's just varying shades of gray. Christian Bale and Amy Adams play grifters who are caught and become Federal snitches in an attempt to avoid lengthy prison sentences. Bradley Cooper plays the Federal  agent they must work with to entrap a network of very powerful and dangerous individuals ranging from mafiosos and politicians including an idealistic mayor effectively portrayed by Jeremy Renner who bares a strong resemblance to Joe Pesci's &#34;Tommy&#34; in Goodfellas. As I said earlier, the operative word in understanding this movie and its cast of &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; guys is gray, because there are no sharp distinctions between the protagonists and antagonists in the film. This is what makes a film interesting and what separates films like these from &#34;Summer&#34; movies.There were surprises in this film, not from the film, which I did not find original or groundbreaking in any way. Nothing very special about the film itself. What surprised me was the commitment Bale gave to his role. He looked downright sloppy and very pathetic, very true to his role in the film. As he did in The Mechanic, he morphed his body to fit the role of his character. Another surprise was seeing DeNiro, looking very old, very much his age as an old gangster.The soundtrack fit the scenes perfectly. My favorite scene was a slow mo scene to Elton John's &#34;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.&#34; However, after a while the music felt like forced melodrama and became both predictable and annoying, though not enough to cancel out the film's positives. The cinematography was gorgeous and captured the feeling and period of the film.

1679509,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00GMV8LIO,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[2, 4]","""American Hustle"" (hereafter ""AH"") is a reasonably entertaining and engrossing variation of the sturdy ""Small-Time Con Man is Pushed Into the Big Leagues"" plot.  The small-time con man is the paunchy and sleazy-looking Irving (Christian Bale) with ratty hair that has a life of its own.  Irving gravitates toward scams and fraudulent businesses because he remembers the racketeers and hoodlums taking advantage of his glass-selling father, and wants to be the on the winning side.  Mainly he dabbles in selling art forgeries and using the proceeds to arrange phony loans to desperate customers.  Somewhat amazingly, he attracts the romantic attention of a sultry, slinky red-haired distaff con artist Sydney Prosser (alias: Lady Edith Greensly) (Amy Adams).  Together they stage more lucrative, but still relatively low-level scams.  Irving keeps Sydney as a mistress and comforting muse and morale-booster because he is married to shrill, maritally frustrated, and seemingly dense Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence from the ""The Hunger Games"") and has a young son by her.  Almost inevitably, Irving and Sydney choose the wrong mark for one of their bogus art sales - excitable, eager, but somewhat meatheaded mama's boy Richard ""Richie"" Dimaso, FBI Agent.To avoid jail time, Irving and Sydney agree to help ""Richie"" orchestrate an ""Abscam"" inspired sting operation intended to expose at least four U.S. congressmen for bribery and, I think, violation of immigration laws since a ""wealthy Sheik Abdullah"" (actually Paco Hernandez) offers to fast-track his American naturalization process for a hefty fee.  Somehow, all this action also involves ""slightly unscrupulous"" New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) and his desire to develop waterfront property businessess and casinos to help his constituents.  And that's the plot of AH.Besides the reasonable pleasure of watching the scams (and counterscams and double-crosses) unfold and unravel, AH also vividly and convincingly re-creates the outlandish and kooky zeitgeist of the '70s with well-chosen '70s song classics (like Steely Dan's ""Reeling in the Years"" and Wings's ""Live and Let Die""), the occasional parties, and introduction of new gadgets like microwaves, which Rosalyn learns are hostile to aluminum foil.  Especially, AH does not forget the hair styles.  Irving isn't the only one with follicle trouble; his wife Rosalyn's 'do looks like yellow spaghetti; Mayor Polito has the Elvis pompadour; even FBI agent Richie (in a hilarious sequence) shows how he gets all the little curls in his hair as his mother yells at him to fix the fish tank filter. Richie's exasperated and brow-beaten FBI superior and mentor Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) provides some humorous bits as he tries to stop Richie from squandering funds on an entire hotel floor for the scam, and to relate and finish an ice-fishing experience he had with his brother as a kid. Jennifer Lawrence (as Rosalyn) is a hoot as the complaining ""bubblehead"" who nevertheless has valid objections against Irving's treatment of her and even advises him on a Plan B when one of his cons (can't remember which one) starts to go south.  From time to time, AH also provides voice-overs (mainly from Irving but sometimes from Sydney) explaining his philosophy, his motivation, and the movie's plot.Thus, AH has its positive qualities, but for me the movie stumbled somewhat because it fails to follow Irving's credo to work on small, simple cons.  The straightforward plot starts to wind back upon itself as cons get conned and counter-conned and players get played and counterplayed.  Robert DeNiro's fleeting and almost-stereotypical but expectedly effective portrayal of mobster Victor Tellegio wanting a piece of the ""Sheik""'s action actually, I humbly think, needlessly complicates matters.  Eventually, at about the midway point, AH becomes, as another Amazon.com reviewer puts it, ""yawny"", and I momentarily lost track.  That was unfortunate for me, because the climax and denouement of AH, with some ironic turns and fates for characters we expected otherwise that the midway point might have explained.Overall, I generally recommend the movie and its various retroactive pleasures (including predicaments that could have been solved by cell phones and Internet access if they had existed in the early '70s), especially the funky coiffures.

The FBI, which usually is so careful in propagating its public image, lets its hair down, literally.  The chief FBI man here, unshaven and looking and acting like a lowlife criminal himself, who lives with his mother and sets his hair in curlers at night, is nothing more than a big mouth, anxious to bring down any politician he can, by entrapment or any other means, in order to gain notoriety for himself.

I really do need to stop putting such high expectations on movies and just watch them for the enjoyment. So today, I will talk about American Hustle.American Hustle introduces us to Irving. Now Irving is not just your average typical man living in the 1970s, no no no Irving is a con man. And even though Irving is married to Rossalyn with whom he shares a son Danny, he is having an affair with a woman ""Edith"" who coincidentally enough is also a con artist. While things are going good for Irving and ''Edith'', their schemes are soon halted by a man Richie DiMaso who is not actually a con man but is actually a FBI agent. In exchange for freedom he commissions Irving and ""Edith"" to help him set up some arrests and just like that we have our movie.For the most part, American Hustle was everything I hoped it would be. I laughed a lot(in a good way) during the movie, mostly at Jennifer Lawrence's character Rossalyn. It is no surprise she was nominated. Bradley Cooper sports quite the hairstyle but he does his job well as Richie DiMaso. Amy Adams was stellar as our con artist ""Edith"". And Christian Bale shows why he is nominated for his role as our main character Irving.To keep my review short, I would honestly say that American Hustle is a Good not Great movie. I did not expect to feel that way going into this movie, but I would not call this movie great. Still, I cannot call American Hustle a bad movie. The story line is interesting (and be prepared to laugh) and the overall setup of the movie itself was nicely done.

1679519,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00GMV8LIO,judy,"[0, 0]","Ok. Yes, this is the third film in a row that I've reviewed that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. It's just that I've been having a marathon of some sort. Also of note is that the date this review is published befalls my birthday. Happy Birthday to Me! Even though I'm writing this a month or so in advance, it's still nice to write. 'American Hustle' was one of those Academy Award Best Picture nominees I most wanted to view myself. I'll be honest when I say that back in August 2013 when the first trailer for the film came out, I was not interested at all. And then later on I watched the second trailer and started to get interested. It's the costumes and cast that really got me attached. It looked like a film that puts you in the 70's and I'm glad to note it does. Now let's read my review of 'American Hustle'.'American Hustle' follows Irving Rosenfeld (Played by Christian Bale) a businessman who operates a small business of dry-cleaning shops. But Irving's greatest business success was as a con man operating a fake money lending scheme, to fool people into handing him 5,000 dollars for credits. He has a wife and child as well. After meeting and falling in love with Sydney Prosser (Played by Amy Adams), a big dreaming, smart girl, Irving asks her to join him in his operation. But the two are soon busted by senile and aggressive FBI agent Richard DiMaso (Played by Bradley Cooper) who forces the two to con the Mayor Carmine Polito (Played by Jeremy Renner) or face jail time. But things go too far with the two whining up attracting the attention of the mob.'American Hustle' is a very interesting film. But the most interesting thing is the characters. Some of them start out cool and end up being a steam pot. The characters are relatable and well fleshed out throughout the bloated 2 hours and 10 minutes runtime. Usually when you watch a movie, the characters are more of a side dish, with the action the main course, and it hurts the film in many ways. But this is obviously not the case with this film. We are given emotionally acceptable characters, characters you hate, characters you love. Highly realistic characters with motives for their actions and interesting back stories. We feel their desperation and anger and fear.Director 'David O. Russell' dives into this crime cape masterfully. Coming off the critical successes of 'Silver Lining Playbook' and 'The Fighter' O. Russell get's inside the story, delivering ripe camerawork and giving us hearty characters, characters that we connect with solely because of O. Russell's direction.But I feel the film lagged in the third act before finally coming to a close. The film feels like 3 hours rather than 2. It includes loads of excess that would have served the film better if it had been cut and left on the cutting room floor. I suggest removing a few nice but rather un-necessary scenes involving DiMaso and his boss (Played by Louis C.K) as well as a scene involving DiMaso at his home, which I felt did nothing to progress the story in anyway. O. Russell is a director who is overly talented but can't seem to leave anything out.The cast is what really makes this film glimmer. 'Christian Bale' coming off the success of the Batman Trilogy plays Irving. He performs the anger, confusion, and smarts that came with the character. He was able to move the story along. 'Amy Adams' shines as Sydney. Her fake British accent is perfect and her performance is remarkably convincing as the clever and decidedly beautiful woman. 'Bradley Cooper' surprisingly pulls off the dramatic role as the somewhat senile detective. I have to give him a tip of the hat, when I say he really puts some effort into the role, and overshadows Bale in the shots they share together. 'Jeremy Renner' plays the sweet mayor, and really pulls off the powerful and very much likable character he plays. I felt sorry for him at the end and felt Renner made the best of his screentime. Also during the end we get a very surprising (and delighting) uncredited cameo from 'Robert De'Niro' as a very powerful mob boss, who plays the tension high and convincing, and gave me a small smirk every time I saw him on screen.The costumes and hair styling is also pretty elegant. Sydney's curly hair is pretty fashionable to the period, and her flashy and scandalous clothing is quite beautiful to look at. Irving himself sports a nice hairdo, as does the agent, DiMaso in a short cut curly hairdo as well. The costumes were well selected and fit the period well. The hairdos were well done and also fit the period well and look really cool as well.All and All 'American Hustle' is a smart film with top notch performances, solid characters, great directing, and even if the film is a bit too long, it's still entertaining. B- 4/7/14'American Hustle' is rated R for pervasive language, some sexual content and brief violence. It's appropriate for ages 14 and up.",4,"Flawed, but man is it easy to love",1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,4928,"['Ok', 'Yes', 'third', 'film', 'row', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'was', 'nominated',

With the great makeup job combined with his being in character and playing the character very well, you hardly realize it is him.This movie has a great supporting cast who do a great job in their roles as well.  Amy Adams also does a great job at being the seductive and fake British con artist who teams up with Rosenfeld as well.  And Bradley Cooper also does a great job at playing the slightly crazy and out of control FBI agent.  Also Jennifer Lawrence, as Rosenfeld's wife who seems to be Rosenfeld's kryptonite even though she is mostly nuts and erratic, does also a nice job at playing the role and playing it well.This movie is a fun ride all the way through with its twists and turns and erratic behavior by all the main players who are all trying to con each other into doing their bidding throughout the movie.  This all provides a great cat and mouse type story that keeps you laughing and entertained all the way through, moments such as the fishing story are hilarious.All in all this is a fun movie to watch, although a bit long, but entertaining all the way through.

I've been watching Christian Bale for a long, long time, and have felt that this actor is truly the greatest male actor that's ever hit the cinema. Why this movie was so good was because it kept you actively wondering, who was for who and what exactly was going to happen next. Riveting drama, the music background (song clips) excelled in holding you in suspense and the emotional scenes between all the characters were just fabulous. I can't say enough about this film, it was five stars all the way. Amy Adams was a tour de force of her own and I would like to see these two actors paired again playing against each other. Wish this movie would have captured more attention for it truly deserved it. We seldom watch movies over again, but we had to on this one, it was just that brilliant.

One thing is guaranteed - starring in a Russell movie will get you a nomination or a win at the various awards. (Melissa Leo won an Oscar for the Fighter - who can forget her acceptance speech?). This is no exception - apart from Robert de Niro's brief cameo, all four of the abovementioned actors have been nominated for Academy Awards for their roles in this movie, with a couple of award wins to date. With such a stellar cast, how can it miss?Christian Bale once again immerses himself fully into his character - con man Irving Rosenfeld - padding an extra 50 pounds onto his frame. His portrayal of the psychotic wraith Trevor Reznik in The Machinist, for which he lost 60 pounds was spellbinding. Robert de Niro's cameo as Victor Telegio was brilliant!But Jennifer Lawrence (Rosalyn Rosenfeld), an exceptionally versatile actress, is simply too young to be convincing in her role, despite her outstanding performance. She is 23, but could easily pass for 18. Amy Adams' (Sidney Tosser/Edith Greensley) inconsistent accent, can't make up its mind whether to be British or American (with even the occasional Aussie twang).  She does not switch easily between her twin roles. She is just too scrawny to exude sex appeal - her low cut dresses hint at boobs, not cleavage. The neurotic but ambitious Bradley Cooper as FBI agent Richie diMaso, with his tightly permed hair is so OTT as to degenerate into a caricature. His mannerisms are Jewish, his appearance Arabic/Jewish - he ain't no Italian! His hysterical temper tantrums, evident in Silver Linings Playbook, may stereotype him for future roles. The supporting cast did better overall, particularly Jeremy Renner's Mayor Carmine Polito and Louis C.K. as Cooper's much abused supervisor Stoddard Thorsen.Without spoilers, the movie is a sting operation, with con artists Bale and Adams being forced to team up with Cooper for immunity when they get caught red handed. Loosely based on the ABSCAM scandals of the 70s and 80s, it is drawn out, overwrought and failed to hold my attention, despite a few really funny throwaway scenes . At over 2 hours, it is too long.It just goes to show that despite a muddled plot, overlong scenes and some mediocre acting, not uncommonly the voters on The Oscars, Golden Globes, Baftas etc. clearly see merit where I don't. As always, far more deserving actors/movies are ignored out there. Joaquin Phoenix, despite numerous nominations, failed to win a single award for Walk the Line.

Russell is my new favorite American movie director.Silver Lining Playbook (2012) was good, and American Hustle (2013) ranks in just as good.Last time I saw a WELL made movie in recent times take takes place in 1970's America was Boogie Nights (1997) and Lovelace (2012), but now that I saw American Hustle, I must say I am blown away by the fashion details, dialogue, and soundtrack of this movie.Although, its music could have been even better if they had at least two songs by the KC & the Sunshine Band, such as:""Keep it Comin' Love"" or ""Shotgun Shuffle"", or ""I like to Do it"", and some Barry White wouldn't hurt either...it could have been 1970's boogie to the core.Most importantly, what I like about this film is the cast (everyone is just brilliant in their role), and the dialogue, the script is prefect, the jokes smart and witty.  The touch of comedy incorporated into this film is pure genius.I hope to see similar movies from Russell in the near future.BTW: Jennifer Lawrence should accept more movie roles similar to the one she played in this film.

How about this: Adolf Hitler (Christian Bale) is really an alien - and FDR (Bradley Cooper) is a robot - and Eleanor Roosevelt (Amy Adams, who needs no makeup for this role) is having an affair with Empress Nariko (Jennifer Lawrence). If you think that's a great idea for a movie then I guarantee you will love American Hustle.Every film has something in it that doesn't make sense. But this one lays it on with a trowel.Bale's and Adams' characters are conducting a finance scam. You give them thousands and they promise to loan you tens of thousands. This is not a Ponzi scheme - which would involve investments, not loans. It could only work if the con artists vanish as soon as they get your money. But these two stick around, have a real office, and intend to do this indefinitely. In other words, it makes no sense whatsoever.When they are arrested, the FBI wants their help because they are &#34;experts&#34; on running a con. Go figure.It gets worse.Adams' character talks with an &#34;English accent&#34; which comes and goes - and would be convincing if your idea of the West End of London is Camden, New Jersey. Her FBI handler does not know who she is, even though he earlier arrested and kept her in a cell for days. Despite this lapse of basic police proceedure, the FBI trusts her and her boyfriend with two million dollars of taxpayer money. (I hope nobody from al Qaida is reading this.)Adams is supposed to make targets of the scam think she is a London banker. Only if British banks staff themselves with Las Vegas hookers would it make sense as to why Adams wears an open blouse apparently glued to her nipples.If you can swallow all this, then you should also have no problem with the scene where an FBI agent pummels his superior and the assault is regarded as just a merry prank.I give this film two stars only because of Jennifer Lawrence, who is a national treasure.

1679584,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B00GMV8LIO,maskirovka,"[8, 14]","The bottom line about ""American Hustle"" is that for me, it was an uneven mix of drama and comedy as well as realism and escapism that left me scratching my head about what sort of movie its makers wanted it to be.  Another problem for me is the depiction of Christian Bale's character as a ""nice conman"" and making him the ""hero"" of the story and the FBI special agent as the (sort of) heavy.  Finally, the movie had a twist ending that I felt was wildly implausible and also completely dishonest with the movie's audience.I really did want to like the movie (it had a power cast who did well with their characters...especially Christian Bales and Bradley Cooper.  Jennifer Lawrence did well as Bale's ditz of a wife although I thought she was a tad too young in the role.  The general outline of the plot was also interesting.  It depicted through a fictional lens, the Abscam investigation where the FBI (using a confidence man it recruited) ultimately caught a number of corrupt politicians, including US Congressmen and a Senator.But I think it was a mistake to depict the story of the film from the perspective of the conman vice the FBI special agents, let alone show the FBI special agent who was his handler as an out-of-control drug abusing nutcase.  I found myself thinking, yeah, that's the way the real-life conman who Bale's character is modeled on (and who sold his ""story"" to the film-makers) probably remembers it, but I wonder how the FBI special agents (there were two handlers in real life) remember things.This leads me to another thing that I really hated about ""American Hustle"" and which the movie ""Goodfellas"" which it imitates in some ways did not have...I'm talking about the ultimate fate of the protagonist and the moronic twist ending that does not play fair with viewers.&lt;spoilers for both ""American Hustle"" and ""Goodfellas"">In ""Goodfellas,"" Henry Hill gets cornered by his own stupidity and greed and facing a long stretch in prison from the Feds or a bullet in the head from his former business associates, he becomes a cooperating witness.  His friends all go to jail and he survives, but the movie ends by showing him frustrated and lost somewhere in middle America far away from the New York milieu that was his home and his marriage over.Contrast that with the ending of ""American Hustle.""  The conman played by Bales suddenly has pangs of guilt over betraying a friend (the corrupt mayor of Camden).  So --and this is all done off-screen until the big ""twist ending-- he manages to steal money the FBI was hoping to snare a mafia boss by staging a con against the FBI and his handler.  He then blackmails the FBI into going easy on his friend the mayor and giving him and his girlfriend a free ride on all the crimes they had committed.One thing I hated about that was the way it was all hidden until after the fact from us the viewers.  Maybe some people don't mind a movie or a book doing something like that but I hate it.  It's a cheap trick, and it's not playing fair with the audience.  They still could have shown the ""lovable"" conman scamming the FBI but the viewers should have known what was going on.(incidentally, in real life, the mayor did not get a light sentence at all but a very severe one; and the conman got very well-paid by the FBI for his work for them)Also, I just gagged a bit at the way the movie sanitized the rather grubby real-life story of the conman after the Abscam case ended.  Yes, he and his girlfriend reconciled but their marriage eventually failed (not too surprising when the people involved were professional liars and cheats).

It is a fictionalized version of actual events, telling the story of two con artists in the late 1970s who get busted by the FBI and are forced to cooperate with them to take down politicians and mobsters.The movie is all about the characters and the acting.  It is a story where there are really no &#34;good&#34; people.  Although all the characters do have some good qualities to them, they are all also very flawed.  So there is really not anyone you truly get behind and root for.  In fact, the closest to a &#34;hero&#34; in the story is Renner's character, Carmine Polito.  I do think all the actors did a wonderful job.  Everyone was really playing a role different than anything they had done in the past, but in my opinion Amy Adams really stole the show.  She was great in every scene she was in whether she was being a British seductress or when she was emotionally vulnerable.  Jennifer Lawrence also did a great job as the bi-polar wife of Christian Bale's character who inserts herself into the operation.  My only complaint is that at just over 2hrs and 10 min it went a little bit too long.  I think some could have been cut out to make the pacing a little bit better.For those who get the actual discs, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  As far as extras go, there are about 22 min of deleted and extended scenes, including two versions of Jennifer Lawrence's power cleaning scenes where she lip syncs to &#34;Live and Let Die&#34; and &#34;Evil Ways.&#34;  There is also a short &#34;making of&#34; documentary with interviews with the cast and director.

The operation proved controversial when it became public, and the FBI was accused of overstepping its authority in creating crimes rather than investigating them. ""American Hustle"" draws on that criticism of the FBI to create a narrative that is downright distrustful of authority and goes so far as to elevate crooks and con artists to the status of anti-heroes. Makeup, wardrobe, and atmosphere steeped in 1970s pop culture, flamboyant behavior, and a strong cast combine to make this an enjoyable darkly comic grift film.Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) outgrew his family dry cleaning business and found success dealing in stolen and forged art and loan sharking before he met his match in Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), an ambitious young New Yorker with a flair for English accents and manipulation. Together, they set up a loan scam to dupe clients out of $5000 each. Then they were caught by Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), an FBI agent with his sights always set on bigger things. In exchange for leniency, DiMaso recruits Rosenfeld and Prosser to help set up some more con artists for him to arrest. They are to deliver 4 busts to fulfill their obligation. But the operation to hook more crooked art dealers and scam artists morphs into a public corruption investigation...and spins out of control.Although the principle characters are based on real people, Sydney Prosser didn't have anything to do with Abscam. Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), Mayor of Camden tirelessly seeking investors for Atlantic City casinos, is more law-abiding than his real-life counterpart. You get the idea. The film opens with the statement: ""Some of this actually happened."" That's more honest than the usual ""based on true events.""Director David O. Russell is adept at slowly turning the audience's sympathies from Rosenfeld's victims and his ambitious FBI persecutor to Rosenfeld and Sydney themselves. By the end of the film, the crooks have become anti-heroes. The strong anti-authoritarian undercurrent is surprising. But the film's rejection of any moral compass is puzzling, given that the writers seem to have intended a political message in criticizing the FBI's agenda and making its agents out to be either amoral and unstable or bureaucratic and impotent. While Russell's manipulation of the audience is effective, he uses a hackneyed gimmick to elicit sympathy for Rosenfeld: Rosenfeld sacrifices his own interests so as not to lose touch with his young adopted son. A bit saccharine for a grift movie.""American Hustle"" was widely praised by critics as one of the best films of 2013. One dissenter was Peter Debruge, who dismissed the film as ""a collection of flamboyant 1970s caricatures run amok"" and criticized its incoherence and sloppiness in ""Variety"". Other dissenting critics said much the same. I don't disagree with them. The film's flashback structure is awkward. It's too long and loaded with filler. The first half needs tighter editing. It's narratively sloppy and thematically confused. It's full of tangents that go no where. ""American Hustle"" has been overpraised. But it's fun, stylish, and the cast is admirable. Amy Adams is particularly strong and even overshadows her low-cut blouses, which are a major feature. I like the erratic interplay between Irving, Sydney, Richie, and Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). This is not a masterpiece, but it's entertaining. Most of the credit should go to Amy Adams and costume designer Michael Wilkinson.",3,"Fun, Stylish, with an Admirable Cast -but Sloppy Narrative, Poor Editing, Thematic Confusion.",1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,3724,"['American', 'Hustle', 'was', 'inspired', 'Abscam', 'operation', 'early', '1980s', 'FBI', 'entrapped', 'number', 'politicians', '-Congressmen', 'one', 'US', 'Senator', 'them-', 'taking', 'bribes', 'wealthy', 'Arab', 'businessmen', 'return', 'political', 'favor', 'operation', 'proved', 'controversial', 'when', 'became', 'public', 'FBI', 'was', 'accused', 'overstepping', 'authority', 'creating', 'crimes', 'rather', 'investigating', 'American', 'Hustle', 'draws', 'criticism', 'FBI', 'create', 'narrative', 'downright', 'distrustful', 'authority', 'so', 'far', 'elevate', 'crooks', 'con', 'artists', 'status', 'anti-heroes', 'Makeup', 'wardrobe', 'atmosphere', 'steeped', '1970s', 'pop', 'culture', 'flamboyant', 'behavior', 'strong', 'cast', 'combine', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'darkly', 'comic', 'grift', 'film.Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'outgrew', 'family', 'dry', 'cleaning', 'business', 'found', 'success', 'dealing', 'stolen', 'forged', 'art', 'loan', 'sharking', 'met', 'match', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'ambitious', 'young', 'New', 'Yorker', 'flair', 'English', 'accents', 'manipulation', 'Together', 'set', 'up', 'loan', 'scam', 'dupe', 'clients', '5000', 'Then', 'were', 'caught', 'Richie', 'DiMaso', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'FBI', 'agent', 'sights', 'always', 'set', 'bigger', 'things', 'exchange', 'leniency', 'DiMaso', 'Rosenfeld', 'Prosser', 'help', 'set', 'up', 'more', 'con', 'artists', 'arrest', 'are', 'deliver', '4', 'busts', 'fulfill', 'obligation', 'operation', 'hook', 'more', 'crooked', 'art', 'dealers', 'scam', 'artists', 'morphs', 'public', 'corruption', 'investigation', 'control.Although', 'principle', 'characters', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'Abscam', 'Carmine', 'Polito', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Mayor', 'Camden', 'tirelessly', 'seeking', 'investors', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'casinos', 'more', 'law-abiding', 'real-life', 'counterpart', 'get', 'idea', 'film', 'statement', 'actually', 'happened', 'more', 'honest', 'usual', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'Director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'adept', 'slowly', 'turning', 'audience', 'sympathies', 'Rosenfeld', 'victims', 'ambitious', 'FBI', 'persecutor', 'Rosenfeld', 'Sydney', 'end', 'film', 'crooks', 'have', 'become', 'anti-heroes', 'strong', 'anti-authoritarian', 'undercurrent', 'surprising', 'film', 'rejection', 'moral', 'compass', 'puzzling', 'given', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'intended', 'political', 'message', 'criticizing', 'FBI', 'agenda', 'making', 'agents', 'out', 'be', 'either', 'amoral', 'unstable', 'bureaucratic', 'impotent', 'Russell', 'manipulation', 'audience', 'effective', 'hackneyed', 'gimmick', 'elicit', 'sympathy', 'Rosenfeld', 'Rosenfeld', 'own', 'interests', 'so', 'not', 'lose', 'touch', 'young', 'adopted', 'son', 'bit', 'saccharine', 'grift', 'movie', 'American', 'Hustle', 'was', 'widely', 'praised', 'critics', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2013', 'One', 'dissenter', 'was', 'Peter', 'Debruge', 'who', 'dismissed', 'film', 'collection', 'flamboyant', '1970s', 'caricatures', 'run', 'amok', 'criticized', 'incoherence', 'sloppiness', 'Variety', 'Other', 'dissenting', 'critics', 'said', 'much', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'film', 'flashback', 'structure', 'awkward', 'too', 'long', 'loaded', 'filler', 'first', 'half', 'needs', 'tighter', 'editing', 'narratively', 'sloppy', 'thematically', 'confused', 'full', 'tangents', 'go', 'where', 'American', 'Hustle', 'been', 'overpraised', 'fun', 'stylish', 'cast', 'admirable', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'particularly', 'strong', 'even', 'low-cut', 'blouses', 'are', 'major', 'feature', 'erratic', 'interplay', 'Irving', 'Sydney', 'Richie', 'Irving', 'wife', 'Rosalyn', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'entertaining', 'Most', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'costume', 'designer', 'Michael', 'Wilkinson']",N/A

There may be spoilers.I think I got my first laugh at the beginning of this movie when a tag line appears saying something to the effect of ""Some of the things seen here actually happened.""  Director David O. Russell and his co-writer, Eric Singer, make no bones about the fact they are making most of this up.  What is true and the basis of the film is the FBI entrapment scheme of the late 1970's called Abscam.  Several New Jersey congressmen, a U. S. senator and local officials were implicated in a bribe scandal to fast-track an Arab's American citizenship and other misdeeds.In the movie the creator of the plot is Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale).  Bale is a far cry from his Dark Knight character, complete with a large beer belly and an atrocious comb over.  Irving is assisted by his mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams).  They've been coerced by the FBI to pull off the scheme in order to get a pass on another crime which is their real pay day.  Essentially they sell fake art and obtain large deposits to get loans for people with no other access to credit.The film has a similar feel as Russell's brilliant ""Silver Linings Playbook"" from 2012.  In fact he recruits Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro from that film.  Cooper plays the ambitious but inept FBI agent who leads the effort.  Lawrence, in another remarkable performance, is Irving's wife Rosalyn, complete with a piled high bee-hive hairdo.  De Niro has a small but very convincing role as the Miami based mobster who wants in on the action.The film has the smart but formally uneducated group outfitted in the finest of the era.  Ugly by most accounts; still I have to say I certainly liked the slinky Halston-styled dresses.  The kind with a deep V-cut and a style that banished the bra.  Jeremy Renner does well as Camden Mayor Polito.  His hair almost reaches the heights of Rosalyn's.  The film is funny, dramatic and has some excellent individual scenes, especially those that include Ms. Lawrence.  To be sure this is a terrific film.  Well written with some authentic sets and designs and some solid performances.",5,"4 1/2 stars for an energetic, clever film by David O.

Instead, it is all a bit jumbled, there are glaring errors, and the fashions look like they were taken from movies of the '70s, not from the actual clothing people wore.Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams deserve their awards for their performances.  Christian Bale does well as the grafter.  But Bradley Cooper is, well, Bradley Cooper.  He's playing the usual character, varying only for whether he's playing someone who's sniveling, or someone who is bullying.  Here he plays both.The representation of the FBI is not consistent with actual FBI culture, but at least it avoids the usual fawning image of the FBI as clockwork, cookie cutter agents who are either good or bad according to the script.  In this case, they are all sniveling, bumbling, and clueless.And in fact this is what I don't care for in the movie.  Not a single character has any redeeming feature that would make you care what happens to them.  Amy Adams, a personal favorite, acts well - but has nothing to work with.

The narrative mainly follows con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) and their money making scams, but also the excessive desire of FBI Agent Richie Di Maso (Jeremy Renner) to stamp out white collar crime.The colourful, vice ridden lifestyle of crooks Rosenfeld and Prosser provides the viewer with several interesting scenes, and the river of deception causes Rosenfeld to be constantly juggling all his dodgy personal and business enterprises, which is a regular source of viewer entertainment. But the storyline also exposes the so-called good guys as corruptible in their own ways, which ultimately places them a step or two behind the seasoned cheats. Seeing into the calamity of all their lives it becomes clear falseness is a currency they all trade in to try and get what they want from people, and may the best swindler win.The costume, hairstyles and set designs masterfully capture the era, and an exceptional cast enables several twisted personalities to shine.Nicholas R.W.

I was a young man in the service when ABSCAM occured, and this movie just didn't hit the mark on the whole &#34;feel&#34; of the operation's aims and the general public's view of the whole matter. But, I realize movies can be made that take a true story, and totally tell another tale when all is said and done. I don't agree with this strategy personally, and I don't understand why a movie maker would pick a story and re-tell it different from fact anyway. Why not just tell your own tale if you think it's good enough. Artistic license is one thing, but re-making a tale is another.There was some good in this story telling though and I'm not rating the maker(s) effort on that score, just the fact that the movie wasn't really telling the tale of ABSCAM IMHO. The actors are solid as you'd expect and it seems they even get into their character's persona well enough to be convincing. If you don't know anything about ABSCAM, I'd wait until after you see the movie to research it if your inclined or curious to find out about it. I wouldn't recommend finding out first, as you will be like me and you will be &#34;waiting&#34; for certain landmarks in the story, and certain facts to surface, and certain events to happen, and it just won't happen.I guess one could also say that it was the ABSCAM story with the focus just somewhere other than center.",2,American Hustle,1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,1396,"['Man', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'service', 'when', 'ABSCAM', 'occured', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'mark', 'whole', '34', 'feel', '34', 'operation', 'aims', 'general', 'public', 'view', 'whole', 'matter', 'realize', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'take', 'true', 'story', 'totally', 'tell', 'tale', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'strategy', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'maker', 'would', 'pick', 'story', 're-tell', 'different', 'fact', 'anyway', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'tell', 'own', 'tale', 'think', 'good', 'enough', 'Artistic', 'license', 'one', 'thing', 're-making', 'tale', 'another.There', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'telling', ""'m"", 'not', 'rating', 'maker', 'effort', 'score', 'just', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'telling', 'tale', 'ABSCAM', 'IMHO', 'actors', 'are', 'solid', ""'d"", 'expect', 'even', 'get', 'character', 'persona', 'well', 'enough', 'be', 'convincing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'ABSCAM', ""'d"", 'wait', 'see', 'movie', 'research', 'inclined', 'curious', 'find', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'finding', 'first', 'will', 'be', 'will', 'be', '34', 'waiting', '34', 'certain', 'landmarks', 'story', 'certain', 'facts', 'surface', 'certain', 'events', 'happen', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen.I', 'guess', 'one', 'could', 'also', 'say', 'was', 'ABSCAM', 'story', 'focus', 'just', 'somewhere', 'other', 'center']",N/A

We see the main characters yet do not know who is who exactly. Then in a further flashback (along with voiceover), we get to know Irving (played by Christian Bale), who meets Sydney (played by Amy Adams) at a party. They hit it off on all levels, and soon the are doing various scams. Comments Sydney: &#34;the more you say 'no' to people, the more they want in!&#34;. Unfortunately in one of those scams, the 'victim' was an undercover FBI agent named Richie (played by Bradley Cooper). Richie eventually convinces Irving and Sydney to help him uncover corrupt politicians, and they set in motion a giant scam. Apart from all that, we learn that Irving is actually married to Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence), who seems to be a 'dumb blond'. At this point we are barely 30 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is another tour de force for director David Russell, after last year's Silver Linings Playbook, and The Fighter the year before that. From the moment the movie opens, Russell pulls us in and won't let go until some 2 hours later. At some point in the movie it becomes impossible to tell who is manipulating whom, and you'll just let go and be surprised as the movie unfolds. Because of the nature and era of the movie, &#34;American Hustle&#34; feels like The Sting-meets-Taxi Driver-meets-The Godfather, just a delight from start to finish. Second, there are so many outstanding acting performances in this movie, I don't even know where to begin. As scheduling fate would have it, I saw Christian Bale just recently in &#34;Out of the Furnace&#34; and now in this, in two roles that couldn't be more different, yet he displays an incredible and confidant acting range reminiscent of, say, a younger Robert de Niro. Speaking of which: de Niro makes a small appearance (10 min. max) that is better than anything he has done in YEARS. Amy Adams has never looked more gorgeous than in this movie. And Jennifer Lawrence (just weeks after seeing her in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) makes the most of her small role. Last, but certainly not least, the movie soundtrack (from the 70s) is nothing short of stellar. Check out the delightful scene where Sydney and Richie are dancing to Donna Summer's I Feel Love, and later when Rosalyn cleans the house while singing/dancing along to Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die. Sheer delight!The movie opened today (yes, Thursday is the new Friday apparently) and I went to see it right away.

1679636,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00GMV8LIO,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[1, 2]","Nine Things about American Hustle1. This is a masterful film of American ambition woven into a gorgeous tapestry of 1970&#8217;s style, fashion and music.2. It is about ego, honor, self-improvement, and the necessity to re-invent oneself in order to make it in this dog-eat-dog world.3. The story centers on Christian Bale, who plays a petty con artist named Irving. The movie starts off by detailing Irving&#8217;s criminal career and his reluctant involvement with federal law enforcement.4. Irving is also having problems at home, which leads him to fall for his partner in crime. While Irving wants to keep his professional and personal lives separate, they inevitably end up on a collision course with each other, and Irving ends up playing for much higher stakes than he ever wanted to.5. For all the sleaziness of the story and characters, the movie has no nudity or blood. This is storytelling magic that doesn&#8217;t rely on sex or violence to keep you interested.6. This means that people who need sex and violence in their movies will likely be kind of bored.7. Everything in the movie, from the fashion, to the hairstyles, to the story, to the actor&#8217;s performances, are slightly exaggerated, just a little bit larger than life. Not enough to turn into a caricature, but just enough to make everything seem to vibrate. The fact that the actors can actually pull this all off is amazing &#8211; the acting is uniformly brilliant, and there are no weak links in the cast.8. The movie takes the old American concept of being a self-made man and cranking it up a notch. The characters are always looking out for themselves, and soon nobody knows who is on what side&#8230; or if there are even any sides at all.9. This is a movie not only about how we fool each other, but how we lie to ourselves, which is the biggest con of all.",5,a gorgeous American tapestry,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1844,"['Nine', 'Things', 'American', 'Hustle1', 'masterful', 'film', 'American', 'ambition', 'woven', 'gorgeous', 'tapestry', '1970', '8217', 's', 'style', 'fashion', 'music.2', 'ego', 'honor', 'self-improvement', 'necessity', 're-invent', 'oneself', 'order', 'make', 'dog-eat-dog', 'world.3', 'story', 'centers', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'petty', 'con', 'artist', 'named', 'Irving', 'movie', 'off', 'detailing', 'Irving', '8217', 'criminal', 'career', 'reluctant', 'involvement', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement.4', 'Irving', 'also', 'having', 'problems', 'home', 'fall', 'partner', 'crime', 'Irving', 'keep', 'professional', 'personal', 'lives', 'separate', 'inevitably', 'end', 'up', 'collision', 'course', 'other', 'Irving', 'up', 'playing', 'much', 'higher', 'stakes', 'ever', 'wanted', 'to.5', 'sleaziness', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'nudity', 'blood', 'storytelling', 'magic', 'doesn', '8217', 'rely', 'sex', 'violence', 'keep', 'interested.6', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'sex', 'violence', 'movies', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'kind', 'bored.7', 'Everything', 'movie', 'fashion', 'hairstyles', 'story', 'actor', '8217', 's', 'performances', 'are', 'slightly', 'exaggerated', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'larger', 'life', 'Not', 'enough', 'turn', 'caricature', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'everything', 'seem', 'vibrate', 'fact', 'actors', 'can', 'actually', 'pull', 'off', 'amazing', '8211', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'brilliant', 'are', 'weak', 'links', 'cast.8', 'movie', 'old', 'American', 'concept', 'being', 'self-made', 'man', 'cranking', 'up', 'notch', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'out', 'soon', 'nobody', 'knows', 'who', 'what', 'side', '8230', 'are', 'even', 'sides', 'all.9', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'fool', 'other', 'how', 'lie', 'ourselves', 'biggest', 'con']",N/A

At times I thought so, a little slow going at first, but then it interrupted into a fast paced film that brought excitement. The film was fashioned after the Abscam affair in the late 80's.&#34;Abscam--sometimes written ABSCAM--was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the Bureau's Hauppauge, Long Island, office[1] in the late 1970s and early '80s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation. The FBI, aided by a convicted con-man, videotaped politicians as they were offered bribes by a fictional Middle Eastern sheik in return for various political favors. The investigation ultimately led to the conviction of a United States Senator, six members of the United States House of Representatives, one member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.&#34; WikiNow we see how this entire affair went down, and what we have is a film with superb characters and acting. Christian Bale is the epitome of the com man, and with his intelligence, Amy Adams, good looks and brain, we have one heck of a scam. The FBI enters with Bradley Cooper as the leader of a group,looking for a couple of good arrests for a fame hungry leader. Jennifer Lawerence as Bale's wife knocks the ball out of the park with her role. Jeremy Renner as the mayor of a New Jersey city, always on the make for his city brings truth and life to his role. Every one in this film out did themselves, believable and so ironic. Can a con man con those in the law? Robert DeNiro plays the second in command of a Florida branch of the Mafia. The hair,and I am not talking about Amy Adams, is so awesome. The clothes of the time, the cars, the homes all a remembrance of things past.This film was one of the better of the season.

It takes place in the late 70's. This movie seemed to capture the 1970's pretty well. It had a great look and the women (Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence) were beautiful. In my opinion, this movie should've won Best Picture.Christian Bale stars as a balding con-artist named Irving Rosenfeld who meets and falls in love with Sydney Prosser, posing as English aristocrat &#34;Lady Edith Greensly&#34; Sydney helps Irving with his scams.

I know this film has been critically acclaimed and was a big box office success; and it has received some awards recognition. The performances, especially by Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, are masterful; and Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper's performances are commendable too. But I was so disappointed in the degree of fictionalization of the ABSCAM Scandal - a story with I believe is worth telling - that I could not bring myself to to give it the highest rating. For example, the Camden, NJ mayor (played by Jeremy Renner) is portrayed as a selfless politician who gets involved in the scam only to provide jobs for his constituents. In reality, though Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti was widely praised for caring about the people of Camden, he also had a reputation for corruption. During the real ABSCAM operation, he offered to get the fake sheik into illegal businesses such as money counterfeiting and drug smuggling. That is just one glaring example...there are many others.

Russell is quickly emerging as the 'Next Scorsese' as American Hustle plays out very much like an homage to Marty and his masterpiece 'Goodfellas'. Russell is building a repertory company around Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Shea Whigham and Mr. Scorsese's former Ace (Rothstein), Robert DeNiro.  All four were able to recreate the manic energy that drove 'Silver Linings Playbook' in this period piece whose title includes a punning reference to the dance craze of the era it recreates.  While 'Goodfellas' was inspired by an earlier '70s 'crime of the century', the Lufthansa Airlines heist at JFK, 'Hustle' is about a similarly notorious latter '70s scandal, 'Abscam', that rocked politicians in New Jersey and Washington. Russell, like Scorsese and Sopranos' mastermind David Chase, is a prisoner of Rock 'n' Roll and his films unfurl like great Classic Rock albums, climaxing when the actors move and emote in time to epic recordings by legends ranging from ELO to Zeppelin, Steely Dan and Santana, all which serve to drive the narrative as effectively as his brilliant script.  Emerging male movie icons Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner (are imbued with the zany offbeat sexual charisma--bad hairpieces and all-- invented by DeNiro and Joe Pesci  in several of Scorsese's films) and Amy Adams hits all the high notes (drama, comedy, phony British accent and spot on sexy dancing) in a breakout performance as she shines so brightly that she affords the movie world's new Golden Girl Lawrence the opportunity to pick a few brilliant spots to apply her scene-stealing capabilities; via their fierce competitiveness for the affections of Bale, these two roar as the film's brassy feminine attractions. Add to all this a fantastic slapstick-inspired comic pairing of the consistently great Cooper with the suddenly (cinematic-ally) ubiquitous Louis C.K., as the Laurel and Hardy-like FBI agents who fall short of their goal to bust up the Mob's nationwide hold on gambling casinos (they have to settle for convictions of Congressmen and a U.S. Senator instead) and you have a film that you can't shake out of your system for at least a week after viewing it --at least twice if possible--much like a great Rock Concert.",4,DO THE AMERICAN HUSTLE,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,2235,"['David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'quickly', 'emerging', ""'Next"", 'Scorsese', 'American', 'Hustle', 'out', 'very', 'much', 'homage', 'Marty', 'masterpiece', 'Russell', 'building', 'repertory', 'company', 'around', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'Mr.', 'Scorsese', 'former', 'Ace', 'Rothstein', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'four', 'were', 'able', 'recreate', 'manic', 'energy', 'drove', ""'Silver"", 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'period', 'piece', 'title', 'punning', 'reference', 'dance', 'craze', 'era', ""'Goodfellas"", 'was', 'inspired', 'earlier', ""'70s"", ""'crime"", 'century', 'Lufthansa', 'Airlines', 'heist', 'JFK', ""'Hustle"", 'similarly', 'notorious', 'latter', 'scandal', ""'Abscam"", 'rocked', 'politicians', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Washington', 'Russell', 'Scorsese', 'Sopranos', 'mastermind', 'David', 'Chase', 'prisoner', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'films', 'unfurl', 'great', 'Classic', 'Rock', 'albums', 'climaxing', 'when', 'actors', 'move', 'emote', 'time', 'epic', 'recordings', 'legends', 'ranging', 'ELO', 'Zeppelin', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'Santana', 'serve', 'drive', 'narrative', 'as', 'effectively', 'brilliant', 'script', 'Emerging', 'male', 'movie', 'icons', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'are', 'imbued', 'zany', 'offbeat', 'sexual', 'charisma', 'bad', 'hairpieces', 'invented', 'DeNiro', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'several', 'Scorsese', 'films', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'high', 'notes', 'drama', 'comedy', 'phony', 'British', 'accent', 'spot', 'sexy', 'dancing', 'breakout', 'performance', 'so', 'brightly', 'movie', 'world', 'new', 'Golden', 'Girl', 'Lawrence', 'opportunity', 'pick', 'few', 'brilliant', 'spots', 'apply', 'scene-stealing', 'capabilities', 'fierce', 'competitiveness', 'affections', 'Bale', 'two', 'roar', 'film', 'brassy', 'feminine', 'attractions', 'Add', 'fantastic', 'slapstick-inspired', 'comic', 'pairing', 'consistently', 'great', 'Cooper', 'suddenly', 'cinematic-ally', 'ubiquitous', 'Louis', 'C.K.', 'Laurel', 'Hardy-like', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'fall', 'short', 'goal', 'bust', 'up', 'Mob', 'nationwide', 'hold', 'gambling', 'casinos', 'have', 'settle', 'convictions', 'Congressmen', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'instead', 'have', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'system', 'least', 'week', 'viewing', 'least', 'twice', 'possible', 'much', 'great', 'Rock', 'Concert']",N/A

Russell's &#34;American Hustle&#34; tells a mostly fictionalized account ('some of this is true' a title says) of the 1980's 'Abscam' scandal in which an eccentric FBI agent exposed corruption in political figures in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  That just begins to describe this top-notch entertainment with idiosyncratic characters that fascinate as they make you laugh.  Virtually everyone is at the peak of their form.Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld (the fictional version of real-life Melvin Weinberg), a con-artist who is 'drafted' into working with the FBI to expose corruption during the &#34;Abscam&#34; scandals, and he's a joy to watch. Amy Adams is Sydney Prosser, seductive British partner to Bale's Irving Rosenfeld, and it's her best role to date.  She's both funny and sexy as she works several different men in the FBI scheme she's been 'drafted' into.  Jennifer Lawrence is also one of the pleasures of &#34;American Hustle&#34;, garnering some of the film's biggest laughs without ever forsaking the believability of her character.David O. Russell has had a good record of making extremely enjoyable films, and many of them display a great sense of artistic achievement.  He started in the early nineties with some provocative and daring independent films (&#34;Spanking the Monkey&#34; and &#34;Flirting with Disaster&#34;, two marvelous black comedies) before making his first masterpiece &#34;Three Kings&#34; in 1999, a darkly comic war film about the first Iraqi conflict, starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.  His subsequent films went from the esoteric and incomprehensible &#34;I Heart Huckabees&#34; to more grounded filmmaking with &#34;The Fighter&#34; and &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34;, both Oscar winners and both excellent showcases for actors.

1679673,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00GMV8LIO,Robert Hayes,"[0, 0]","AMERICAN HUSTLE is a movie which is only nominally about the Abscam sting operation in late 70's/early 80's. The real heart and soul of this movie lies in the many fictional characters created for it, who are all conning each other in one way or another. Basically, the movie is about what people do in order to survive. This is a very compelling theme which is suitably explored over the course of the film, but it lacks enough narrative focus to really leave an impression. Yes, it is wonderfully acted and has some funny scenes (as well as one tense scene with a great cameo), but David O. Russell let his actors run amok with the script and it shows. On the positive side, the film features some of the best period production design and costumes, as well as an impeccably chosen soundtrack. Tonally, Russell seemed to be going for a Scorsese feel. This was nice, but I would have rather that Russell put more of a personal stamp on the material like he did with his previous film SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.

I love a historical piece and this one didn't fail to show us some of the best and some of the worst from fashion in this era.  The soundtrack is diverse and appropriate and doesn't just stick to the same 20 songs we tend to hear from the late 70's.  Also, as story lines go this one was reasonably well executed and held my own interest for most of the 2+ hours.  I saw this one in a VERY crowded theatre and the audience seemed attentive and responsive to the 15-20 comedic bits.  In fact one woman in the front row very nearly choked to death on a piece of popcorn that happened to hit the wrong spot just as something funny was going on.To the negative, the movie did have some continuity problems and the middle hour or so was a bit of a yawn-filled drag.  It seemed like a movie that was cobbled down from about 5 hours to 2 as characters made unexplained transitions between emotional states; I suspect an extended version might make slightly more sense but likely end up being fairly unbearable.In summary, not the best movie I've seen in the past few months but it was amusing enough to justify the time spent.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","For all that we revere the farmer, the soldier, the statesman, the law enforcer, the clergyman and the hero, we Americans have always reserved a special place in our hearts for the outlaw, the gangster, the card shark, the con man, the hustler. It&#8217;s a trait that goes to the very core of our identity as a people, a crucial element in our national mythology. From our most humble beginnings, hustling has stood as a time-honored tradition, a value &#8220;as American as apple pie.&#8221; Indeed, whole genres of literature and popular entertainment have sprung up around this idea. And for all the lip service we pay to what we righteously call the Protestant work ethic, we can&#8217;t help but subversively admire those who are able to achieve the American Dream through less noble and less arduous means. Indeed, our history is populated with scoundrels and scalawags we&#8216;ve somehow managed to turn into folk heroes, and, while today our grifters operate on Wall Street or in corporate boardrooms rather than on the western frontier, the characteristics are the same: they&#8217;re all just slick-talking manipulators operating outside the system and making a fortune while doing so. And, oh, how we love it! Unless it&#8217;s being done to us, of course; then, we&#8217;re not so crazy about it, which is why when it involves political corruption, the fleecing of us the taxpayer, we may no longer be quite so forthcoming in our admiration.&#8220;American Hustle&#8221; is David O. Russell&#8216;s smart and savvy tribute to the con artist in all of us. He and his co-writer, Eric Warren Singer, have chosen to set their work in the 1970s, an age of polyester suits, ultra-wide lapels and bad comb-overs. It was also host to one of the biggest financial scandals of the modern era, Abscam, an FBI sting operation that resulted in the convictions of a mayor (played by Jeremy Renner), a United States Senator, six United States congressmen and an assortment of state officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania on bribery and corruption charges. &#8220;American Hustle&#8221; starts off by declaring that &#8220;SOME of this actually happened,&#8221; and, indeed, the movie&#8217;s often absurdly comic, larger-than-life quality makes us question the veracity of a good deal of what we&#8217;re seeing. But no matter because the movie is clearly more a study in character and theme than it is a factual recounting of the events of history (which explains why all the names have been changed to protect the guilty).And what a cast of characters Russell has gathered for our amusement and delectation! A paunchy, balding Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld, a natural-born shyster who&#8217;s found a way to earn money (to the tune of $5,000 a crack) through offering loans to people desperate for cash, money these down-on-their-luck individuals will never see. Irving is married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), a scatterbrained chatterbox who is so high maintenance that Irving is forced to live on his own even though he supports her and her son, whom he&#8217;s adopted as his own. Irving&#8217;s problem is that for all his willingness to rip off people, he may be just a tad too softhearted to be very lucrative at his profession. Enter Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), an attractive woman with some secrets of her own who becomes Irving&#8216;s business partner and lover.  They&#8217;re not in the business very long before undercover FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) blows the lid off their operation, offering them immunity from prosecution if they&#8217;ll help take down some bigger fish. Richie is, in many ways, the focal point of the screenplay, a preening, overreaching lawman whose main concern is netting as many big fish in his net as he can in order to make a name for himself. It&#8217;s not long before tensions are developing among the three principal players, and much of the movie&#8217;s fun derives from watching these two outsized figures, who find their value in being able to manipulate others to their own advantage, engaging in what amounts to a giant pi**ing contest over strategies, ethics and even Sydney herself.As with any good tale of con artists and grifters, &#8220;American Hustle&#8221; beguiles us with the spectacle of hustlers hustling the hustlers, since, as we&#8217;re told, hustlers are ultimately just people &#8220;doing what they need to do to survive.&#8221; It gets to the point that not only do the characters not know who&#8217;s telling the truth and who&#8216;s playing whom, the audience can&#8217;t tell either. And even though Richie thinks he&#8217;s shrewd enough to play in the big leagues, he soon learns the bitter lesson that, when it comes to hustling, amateurs should never mess around with professionals.Russell employs a dizzying whirlwind technique - consisting of fast-paced storytelling, energetic camerawork and editing, snappy dialogue, crisp narration - that puts one in mind of &#8220;Goodfellas.&#8221; Even when the action is set in an enclosed room, which is often the case, the movie never stops moving. It&#8217;s alive and we&#8217;re alive to it. Moreover, the spot-on period details, especially the uber-tacky 70s fashions, only serve to heighten the absurd humor of the tale we&#8217;re watching.&#8220;American Hustle&#8221; boasts one of the finest acing ensembles we&#8217;ve come across in quite some time, which, in addition to the main cast, includes Louie CK, Michael Pena and Robert De Niro, among others.There&#8217;s a manic energy in both the performances and the filmmaking in &#8220;American Hustle&#8221; that perfectly reflects the soul of a nation founded on youthful vigor and anti-establishment rule-breaking. And indeed it&#8217;s that uniquely American spirit of anarchic iconoclasm that Russell captures to such memorable effect in &#8220;American Hustle.&#8221;",5,A full-throttled tribute to the American

It does an awesome job of telling the tale of a good-ol'fashioned American Hustle in which it was often difficult to tell the difference between the protagonist(s) & antagonist(s).  Storylines abound, and the way the characters' ""soft sides"" tangle with one another brings all kinds of side-plots into the mix that makes for a laughable & entertaining movie.  You won't even realize you've sat still, watching it, for 2 hours & 20 minutes!PLOT (SPOILER ALERT:  consider NOT reading this paragraph):  It's a story of a con man who meets a woman, eventually sways her into his ways, and they setup an operation whereby they're making money (illegally) hand over fist.  Eventually, the ""feds"" nab them...and, rather than simply throw'em in the slammer, a young, ambitious field agent sees the potential opportunity to utilize the pair for their unconventional skills--with the objective of going after political figures--by enlisting them to work under the FBI's guise and execute sting operations.  Initially, sights are set on local politicos...but after seeing the real potential of backroom deals & bribes reaching much farther and larger a network--of known criminals & politicians alike--objectives shift to a much larger scope.  But not without a struggle!  In the end, well...let's just say -- it's entertaining as all hell!It had an all-star cast that just meshed together incredibly.  Christian Bale & Jennifer Lawrence both knocked it out of the park.  Amy Adams & Bradley Cooper both had solid performances, too.  Jeremy Renner was good (although, initially, I had difficulty accepting him playing that particular role).  Adams' character sexed things up just enough to give it sizzle, but keep it classy.  Cooper's character brought a strong sense of impulsiveness to the story.  Bale was just fantastic--transcendent.  Lawrence brought the unstable/crazy factor.  Louis C.K.'s character, as you would expect, added an element of humor.  De Niro's cameo, although short, kept you glued to the screen.The music selection was great, too.

It begins to clear as you realize that a politician (later identified as the mayor of Camden NJ is being offered a bribe.

Then one of their victims turns out to be an undercover FBI Agent.  An agent on the prowl for recognition but undisciplined and while well played (by Bradley Cooper) the chracter is not really believable.  Assaulting his boss was over the top and totally unrealistic.  The many flashbacks are confusing but eventually you begin to piece together what is going on.  Nevertheless the movie is rather slow even though the double and triple crosses leave you wondering what is going on. However, as the plot moves to conclusion the action picks up as you find that you shouldn't try to con a conman.  The ending is totally unexpected but when you get there you realize that that was the only logical conclusion.

1679716,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B00GMV8LIO,SJreviewsEverything,"[0, 0]","Unlike its predecessor Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle is a slow-cooking picture. It takes a long time to get going, and doesn&#8217;t really explain where we&#8217;re going, but once we start rolling it becomes a cinematic dream.The exposition, weirdly, is the film at some of its clunkiest. Maybe it&#8217;s the gradual, deliberate pacing or the oddly deafening silence (we don&#8217;t get the stellar soundtrack til about halfway through), but something about it feels uninvolving. The con scheme set up by Irving and Sydney (later Edith) doesn&#8217;t really make sense, and this disconnect makes it hard to stay interested and engaged with what&#8217;s going down.The intervention of FBI Agent Richie DiMaso, played to perfection by Bradley Cooper (who, in just two films, has become one of my favorite contemporary actors), is the first great curveball thrown at the lead duo. They get caught for their scheme and, in a similarly selfish fashion, he bets the odds in his favor and pushes them to topple greater and greater idols, not for Justice but for his own reputation.The film is often patchy, alternating between sequences of nap-worthy doldrums and truly fantastic filmmaking. My favorite moments are the soundtrack-heavy ones, such as the disco nightclub scene (one of the best I&#8217;ve ever seen) and the montage of arrests at the film&#8217;s climax. It&#8217;s extraordinary how the glorious 70s soundtrack really raises the impact from watching a dime-a-dozen crime caper to this sublime, awe-inspiring cinematic experience. It&#8217;s like watching the greatest music video that was never made.Other highlights, it goes without saying, are those featuring the unforgettable Jennifer Lawrence.  She plays the classic, genre-perfect crazy New Jersey wife with a bitchy honesty that never feels over-the-top or flamboyant. She exercises such remarkable control yet leaves a lasting screen presence, it&#8217;s hard to remember she is in the movie so little compared to the other main characters.This film&#8217;s greatest strength, though, is in its unique brand of messaging. The Wolf of Wall Street (which I actually prefer) does have some line between right and wrong, even if that line is dotted and hard-to-read, American Hustle has no such line at all. Who of any of these characters, is good? Who is wholly unselfish? I love to see this kind of challenging storytelling, where there is no one really doing the right thing, and everyone is working an angle. Hollywood is often too timid to make a movie as cynical as this, and I applaud David O. Russell for having the guts to.While it has some narrative issues and clunks along at times, it is an often-entertaining movie that delivers some unforgettable movie moments.

1679720,A38X3820MO0TAN,B00GMV8LIO,Sony XL,"[0, 1]","I am outraged at the negativity toward a brilliant film. Not only does this movie nail the 70's in so many ways, but mirrors current events (New Jersey) in such perfect concordance, that it seems completely predictive of a thousand news stories circling the planet. How current does a movie have to be when it looks deep in the heart of darkness in American politics and then it all plays out right in front of us?American Hustle is an excellent and entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack all of those elements make American Hustle a great film that has to be seen.Set in New York City in the late 1970s,American Hustle tells the story of two con artists,Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale)and Sydney Prosser(Amy Adams)who have been forced by FBI agent Richie DiMasso(Bradley Cooper)to participate in a FBI operation called ABSCAM,a sting operation to set up corrupt politicians including Camden,New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and gangsters. As the stakes become higher and with danger coming at every corner Irving and Sydney have to figure out how to get out and survive.Throughout the history of cinema,con artists and Grifters have been covered in movies ranging from The Sting(1973),The Grifters(1990)and now American Hustle,an amazing film from beginning to end that keep your attention with fantastic movie making that never stops. Right from it's weird and offbeat opening American Hustle is a movie that combines Comedy,Crime Drama and a true life tale that is funny and quirky and at other times serious and intense giving viewers a movie that plays by it's own rules and creates it's own world. With American Hustle David O'Russell gives us a movie that is dazzling bringing viewers into the crime world of the 1970s showing the personal and professional lives of con artists,federal agents,politicians and gangsters never knowing where the story or it's characters will go and even though AH is a fact based story the movie is not too dark. When you look at AH you will see that the movie was obviously influenced in many ways by Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics such as Goodfellas(1990)and Casino(1995)with the way the camera moves,the style and look of the film and the use of narration replacing Gangsters and Mobsters with con artists but O'Russell takes the style and makes it his own. The Comedy in AH is great and hilarious because the laughs are never forced on viewers or telling them when scenes are funny but lets the viewers figure out when scenes are funny whether it's in some of the scenes or in the main characters dialog or actions. The Comedy is balanced out by the Crime Drama elements as well which are done with attention and detail like a other Crime Dramas and you are gripped with every scene that involves cops and crime. But the Crime Drama element isn't always serious and is entertaining. The beautiful photography by Linus Sandgren and amazing production design by Judy Becker truly add to the film and give AH a realistic look and feel of the 1970s with vibrant colors and sets that pull you into the world that AH wants to portray and it's one of the reasons the movie succeeds. The main characters in the film whether it's the con artists,federal agents are fascinating and interesting with laughs and depth because with each main character everyone wants to succeed at what they do whether it's good or bad. Also,with the characters there is no black and white but a gray area that is complex and real and you will relate to some of the characters in some ways. The screenplay by Eric Singer and David O'Russell is impressive and well-done with dialog that is a mixture of funny and serious. The ending of American Hustle is wonderful,surprising and unexpected and fits with films about con artists and Grifters. An outstanding conclusion to a great movie.The whole cast is amazing. Christian Bale is excellent and at his best as Irving Rosenfield,with Bale bringing intensity and emotional(and physical)depth to the role. Bradley Cooper is brilliant and funny as FBI agent Richie DiMasso,with Copper being offbeat and dramatic. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful as Sydney Prosser,Irving's partner in crime and has great scenes with Bale,Cooper and Lawrence. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as Mayor Carmine Polito,a New Jersey politician. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and sexy as Roselyn Rosenfield,Irving's attractive but overbearing wife. Also,lookout for a great uncredited appearance from Robert De Niro in a great performance as Victor Tellegio,a high level gangster. Louis C.K(Stoddard Thorsen),Jack Huston(Pete Musane),Michael Pena(Paco Hernandez),Shea Whigham(Carl),Alessandro Nivola(Anthony Amando)and Paul Hermane(Alfonse Simone)give good performances as well.The direction by David O'Russell is brilliant and stylish,with O'Russell always moving the camera with tracking shots,close-ups and a nice visual style. Terrific direction,O'Russell.The score Danny Elfman isn't always used but good when it's heard. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Elton John(Goodbye Yellow Brick Road),Wings(Live And Let Die),The Temptations(Papa Was A Rolling Stone),Duke Ellington(Jeep's Blues)and more.

1679723,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00GMV8LIO,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 1]","A lot of talent working hard in this movie, but only with sporadic success.  One of the biggest names, Robert De Niro, has an uncredited cameo, and unkind though it might be to say, I think his decision to keep his name off the credits was a wise one.  The problem is with the rhythm and direction -- there are scenes that seem either unnecessary or to go on to long.  For example, the scene with the agents who believe that they have just taped an incriminating phone call is probably not needed, but certainly goes on far too long.  The scene with Richie (Bradley Cooper) and Sydney (Amy Adams) in the bathroom stall adds nothing to our grasp of these characters or to the plot.  The running gag of Richie's boss (Louis C. K.) and the ice-fishing story is weak and unnecessary  The big party scene involving the sheikh and the mobsters -- way too long.  Carmen Polito, mayor of Camden, NJ, goes on and on about how his constituents are his family, long after we get it.  The energy of the actors and the excellent production values aren't enough to save these scenes, and they throw the rhythm out of kilter.George Roy Hill's ""The Sting"" ran like clockwork -- like the sting itself.  This is a sort of sting movie, and (thanks to Rosalyn [Jennifer Lawrence], the wife of con-man Irving Rosenfeld [Christian Bale]) the sting DOESN'T run like clockwork -- but the movie should, and it doesn't.  The con artists, Irving and Sydney, are constantly having to adapt to unforeseen circumstances -- and there is a possibility of humor in that -- but the adjustments aren't always as funny as they could be.  There is a certain satisfaction in the ending's showing that folks who have to con for a living are better at it than the government, but I'm not sure that that makes up for the dull patches on the way.  I think that Cooper, Adams, Lawrence, and Bale -- as well as Jeremy Renner, who plays Carmine Polito -- are fine, and some local scenes work well enough, but not enough of them.Viewers shouldn't expect a satire on the level of ""M.A.S.H."" or ""Network.""  Despite the title ""American Hustle"" it's not clear that there's anything specifically American in the targets of such satire as there is beyond the setting.  Somewhere in the background, and signaled early, there's a point being made about self-invention and re-invention (this is, I think, what all the stuff about everybody's hair is all about), but it hardly deserves the name of cultural criticism.  Further, the cartoonishness of the characterization distances us from the characters' predicaments, but they are not reduced to social or culturally recognizable types in a way that would enable us to say confidently that this or that aspect of the culture is being satirized.So what's to like?  The energy of the acting is engaging; De Niro's brief moment is gripping and well-paced; there's a great late 1970's soundtrack, and the '70's look is faithfully recreated -- but these alone didn't redeem the movie as a whole for me.  So . . . it's OK, but a bit tiresome, I'm afraid.",3,Overhyped? certainly.

1679725,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00GMV8LIO,Steven Aldersley,"[38, 50]","I had been looking forward to seeing American Hustle since it was announced. I almost saw it on release day, but I have an aversion to watching movies with people who are more concerned with noisily eating their weight in popcorn than watching what is on the screen. Yesterday's viewing was still pretty packed, but I am glad I didn't wait any longer. The movie is a lot of fun.There's something a little jarring about David O. Russell's movies. I think it's the amount of conflict present between his characters. Have you ever been to a party or a gathering where people are all talking at once? It can be chaotic. There might be little gems of information hidden in the cacophony, but it's easy to miss. If you have seen The Fighter, you'll know that Russell's characters were often at each others throats. In Silver Linings Playbook, the central romance wasn't fully realized until the participants had survived numerous arguments. American Hustle feels similar in many ways to both those movies, although the canvas is broader and more colorful.The movie opens with the statement, ""Some of this actually happened."" Well, the 1970s certainly happened, but I doubt that many people resembled the main characters in this story. The opening scene sets the tone by showing Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) fixing his hair. This is an elaborate process involving glue and a comb-over. IMDB states that Bale gained more than 40 pounds to play the role, and herniated two discs while perfecting his slouching posture. It's quite a transformation. That opening scene is a clear statement that American Hustle is not going to be a serious drama, and the movie rarely deviates from that initial statement of intent.Rosenfeld is an interesting character. He spends most of his time conning people out of their money, promising loans for those who can make a down payment of $5,000. He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party and the two form a partnership and are attracted to each other. The plot becomes more complicated when an intended mark turns out to be FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). To avoid going to jail, Rosenfeld and Prosser agree to help DiMaso convict four corrupt officials, starting with Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner).What follows is a complete mess. Does Rosenfeld really love Prosser? Will he ever leave his wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence)? Is Prosser in love with Rosenfeld, DiMaso, both, or neither? The story contains a delightful cameo from another Russell regular, a science oven, a fake sheikh, great music from the 70s, fantastic performances from the main cast, twists, humor, intrigue, and plenty of laughs. Is it coherent? Not completely on the first viewing. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely.Jennifer Lawrence isn't in many scenes, but she's fascinating every time she appears. Bale and Adams dominate most of the story, and are ably supported by Bradley Cooper, who has become a much better actor than I once imagined. It's interesting to see these Russell favorites make fun of themselves. Lawrence is borderline crazy, Bale almost unrecognizable, Adams more manipulative than most of her former characters, and Cooper willing to act like a fool. Is this the sort of chemistry that develops when directors continually use actors that they have worked with in the past? I love seeing directors such as Lynch, the Coens, Darabont and Tarantino going back to the same actors repeatedly. I think it adds something to the performances.Like a Tarantino movie, American Hustle is more about style and the journey than the actual plot. It's simply fun to watch these characters interact. Don't expect a clever scam along the lines of The Sting. Just enjoy the wild ride. I already can't wait to see it again, despite its imperfections. I have a feeling that I will end up loving the movie once I have allowed it to sink in and with repeat viewings. The same was true for Silver Linings Playbook and Jason Reitman's Young Adult.If you're perceptive and still reading, you might have noticed that I haven't talked much about the plot. This is one you need to experience without knowing too much going in. If you're a fan a Russell, or the main actors, you'll come away with a smile on your face. If you're not, this movie might just convert you.For now, the overall score is 4/5.",4,Another chaotic Russell script that will almost certainly grow on you,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,4315,"['had', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'American', 'Hustle', 'was', 'announced', 'almost', 'saw', 'release', 'day', 'have', 'aversion', 'watching', 'movies', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'noisily', 'eating', 'weight', 'popcorn', 'watching', 'what', 'screen', 'Yesterday', 'viewing', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'packed', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'wait', 'longer', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun.There', 'something', 'little', 'jarring', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'movies', 'think', 'amount', 'conflict', 'present', 'characters', 'Have', 'ever', 'been', 'party', 'gathering', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'once', 'can', 'be', 'chaotic', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'gems', 'information', 'hidden', 'cacophony', 'easy', 'miss', 'have', 'seen', 'Fighter', ""'ll"", 'know', 'Russell', 'characters', 'were', 'often', 'others', 'throats', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'central', 'romance', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realized', 'participants', 'had', 'survived', 'numerous', 'arguments', 'American', 'Hustle', 'feels', 'similar', 'many', 'ways', 'movies', 'canvas', 'broader', 'more', 'colorful.The', 'movie', 'statement', 'actually', 'happened', 'Well', '1970s', 'certainly', 'happened', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'resembled', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'opening', 'scene', 'tone', 'showing', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'fixing', 'hair', 'elaborate', 'process', 'involving', 'glue', 'comb-over', 'IMDB', 'Bale', 'gained', 'more', '40', 'pounds', 'play', 'role', 'herniated', 'two', 'discs', 'perfecting', 'slouching', 'posture', 'quite', 'transformation', 'opening', 'scene', 'clear', 'statement', 'American', 'Hustle', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'serious', 'drama', 'movie', 'rarely', 'initial', 'statement', 'intent.Rosenfeld', 'interesting', 'character', 'most', 'time', 'conning', 'people', 'money', 'promising', 'loans', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'down', 'payment', '5,000', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'party', 'two', 'form', 'partnership', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'plot', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'intended', 'mark', 'out', 'be', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Richie', 'DiMaso', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'avoid', 'going', 'jail', 'Rosenfeld', 'Prosser', 'agree', 'help', 'DiMaso', 'convict', 'four', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'starting', 'Mayor', 'Carmine', 'Polito', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', '.What', 'complete', 'mess', 'Does', 'Rosenfeld', 'really', 'love', 'Prosser', 'Will', 'ever', 'leave', 'wife', 'Rosalyn', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Prosser', 'love', 'Rosenfeld', 'DiMaso', 'story', 'delightful', 'cameo', 'Russell', 'regular', 'science', 'oven', 'fake', 'sheikh', 'great', 'music', '70s', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'main', 'cast', 'twists', 'humor', 'intrigue', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'coherent', 'Not', 'completely', 'first', 'viewing', 'seeing', 'Absolutely.Jennifer', 'Lawrence', ""n't"", 'many', 'scenes', 'fascinating', 'time', 'Bale', 'Adams', 'dominate', 'most', 'story', 'are', 'ably', 'supported', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', 'become', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'once', 'imagined', 'interesting', 'see', 'Russell', 'favorites', 'make', 'fun', 'Lawrence', 'borderline', 'crazy', 'Bale', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Adams', 'more', 'manipulative', 'most', 'former', 'characters', 'Cooper', 'willing', 'act', 'fool', 'sort', 'chemistry', 'when', 'directors', 'continually', 'use', 'actors', 'have', 'worked', 'past', 'love', 'seeing', 'directors', 'such', 'Lynch', 'Coens', 'Darabont', 'Tarantino', 'going', 'back', 'same', 'actors', 'repeatedly', 'think', 'something', 'performances.Like', 'Tarantino', 'movie', 'American', 'Hustle', 'more', 'style', 'journey', 'actual', 'plot', 'simply', 'fun', 'watch', 'characters', 'interact', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'clever', 'scam', 'lines', 'Sting', 'Just', 'enjoy', 'wild', 'ride', 'already', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'again', 'imperfections', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'movie', 'once', 'have', 'allowed', 'sink', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'same', 'was', 'true', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'Young', 'Adult.If', ""'re"", 'perceptive', 'still', 'reading', 'might', 'have', 'noticed', 'have', ""n't"", 'talked', 'much', 'plot', 'one', 'need', 'experience', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', 'going', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Russell', 'main', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'come', 'away', 'smile', 'face', ""'re"", 'not', 'movie', 'might', 'just', 'convert', 'you.For', 'now', 'overall', 'score', '4/5']",N/A
1679726,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00GMV8LIO,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 1]","Okay, as I figured, there are already 443 (!) reviews posted on Amazon for &#8220;American Hustle&#8221;.  The BD and DVD were released on March 18th. I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as review of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to my review of the DVD (non-Bluray) version. As I understand it the bonus features are the same on both the DVD and BD.This 129-minute film is &#8220;loosely based&#8221; on the Abscam  &#8220;sting&#8221; in the 1970s &#8211; though there were never any women involved  (and here there are two) and, for those old enough to remember following the news then, the plot will be more interesting and somewhat easier to follow. I say &#8220;somewhat&#8221; because Writer/Director David O. Russell really plays with the real events a lot and often you can&#8217;t tell who the bad guys (or bad gals) are and who aren&#8217;t.  In one of the special features &#8211; more on those in a minute &#8211; Russell admits that the plot is really secondary to the &#8220;characters&#8221;. He loves &#8220;quirky&#8221; characters and that&#8217;s why he was attracted to the project.  Yes, they are &#8220;quirky&#8221; and the 70s clothes and hairstyles bring all the &#8220;quirkiness out&#8221; of all the lead actors. Now Amy Adams wears (should I say bare-ly wears?) her dresses that could be popular today. When the plot gets boring there is always Adams to look watch! This is unlike any character she has played before. Jennifer Lawrence is also playing a character unlike her prior roles and that makes it interesting too. But, honestly, I thought the film dragged a lot and that Russell created some scenes just so he could back them with 1970s pop hits.Because there will be lots of opinions about the &#8220;film&#8221; &#8211; there already are &#8211; I&#8217;ll now jump to the &#8220;Bonus Features&#8221;, and there really aren&#8217;t many of them either. There are a group of &#8220;deleted or extended&#8221; scenes  (about 20 minutes worth) but two of them are just scenes of Jennifer Lawrence dancing around the house while pop hits like &#8220;She&#8217;s A Lady&#8221; play as a soundtrack. The now-requisite &#8220;Making of&#8221; featurette (about 16 minutes) features Russell, some of the cast and a few producers talking about how Russell is so great to work with and how challenging the roles were. And, of course, there are lots of clips from the film.I enjoyed Russell&#8217;s &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook&#8221;, but &#8220;American Hustle&#8221; felt like it could have used a bit more editing, and a script that would help explain the whole Abscam thing to younger viewers.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",3,Review of the DVD version &#8211; with concentration on the &#8220;Special Features&#8221;,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,3125,"['Okay', 'figured', 'are', 'already', '443', 'posted', 'Amazon', '8220', 'American', 'Hustle', '8221', 'BD', 'DVD', 'were', 'released', 'March', '18th', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'film', 'together', 'version', 'will', 'find', 'lots', 'reviews', 'theatrical', 'version', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'review', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'version', 'covers', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'So', 'always', 'recommend', 'buyers', 'sort', 'reviews', '8220', 'Most', 'Recent', '8221', 'first', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'format', 'reviewer', 'discussing', 'said', 'review', 'DVD', 'non-Bluray', 'version', 'understand', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'same', 'DVD', 'BD.This', '129-minute', 'film', '8220', 'loosely', 'based', '8221', 'Abscam', '8220', 'sting', '8221', '1970s', '8211', 'were', 'never', 'women', 'involved', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'following', 'news', 'then', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'easier', 'follow', 'say', '8220', '8221', 'Writer/Director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'really', 'real', 'events', 'lot', 'often', 'can', '8217', 'tell', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'bad', 'gals', 'are', 'who', 'aren', '8217', 't.', 'one', 'special', 'features', '8211', 'more', 'minute', '8211', 'Russell', 'plot', 'really', 'secondary', '8220', 'characters', '8221', '8220', '8221', 'characters', '8217', 'why', 'was', 'attracted', 'project', 'Yes', 'are', '8220', '8221', '70s', 'clothes', 'hairstyles', 'bring', '8220', '8221', 'lead', 'actors', 'Now', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'wears', 'should', 'say', 'bare-ly', 'wears', 'dresses', 'could', 'be', 'popular', 'today', 'When', 'plot', 'boring', 'always', 'Adams', 'look', 'watch', 'character', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'also', 'playing', 'character', 'prior', 'roles', 'interesting', 'too', 'honestly', 'thought', 'film', 'dragged', 'lot', 'Russell', 'created', 'scenes', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'back', '1970s', 'pop', 'hits.Because', 'will', 'be', 'lots', 'opinions', '8220', 'film', '8221', '8211', 'already', 'are', '8211', '8217', 'now', 'jump', '8220', 'Bonus', 'Features', '8221', 'there', 'really', 'aren', '8217', 't', 'many', 'are', 'group', '8220', 'deleted', 'extended', '8221', 'scenes', '20', 'minutes', 'worth', 'two', 'are', 'just', 'scenes', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'dancing', 'house', 'pop', 'hits', '8220', '8217', 's', 'A', 'Lady', '8221', 'soundtrack', 'now-requisite', '8220', 'Making', '8221', 'featurette', '16', 'minutes', 'features', 'Russell', 'cast', 'few', 'producers', 'talking', 'how', 'Russell', 'so', 'great', 'work', 'how', 'challenging', 'roles', 'were', 'course', 'are', 'lots', 'clips', 'film.I', 'enjoyed', 'Russell', '8217', '8220', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', '8221', '8220', 'American', 'Hustle', '8221', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'editing', 'script', 'would', 'help', 'explain', 'whole', 'Abscam', 'thing', 'younger', 'viewers.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",N/A

1679728,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00GMV8LIO,StrangePegs,"[2, 4]","Some of these things actually happened.But probably not many of them. At least not in any way close to the presentation in American Hustle.That doesn't stop it from being an excellent movie, though.It's one of the few movies I've seen where I had no idea about what was coming next. At its base, it's a con movie, so you're never quite sure who's conning whom and what anyone has up his sleeve. Or under her skirt, I suppose, since the women are perpetually dressed as they are in the poster. And, then, at least a couple of the characters are at least slightly unhinged, and you never quite know which direction the story is going.Surprisingly, the movie opens with one of those flash-forward/flashback type things that I normally hate, but they really made it work in this one. For one thing, the movie doesn't start near the climax, just at the point of the first sting operation. It's the place where we meet all of the major players, so to speak. Once the deal falls apart, we flashback with Irving Rosenfeld for a first person narration (which I also usually hate) of what brought him to that point. But what makes it interesting is that when we get to the part where he crosses paths with Sydney Prosser, she picks up the narration and, then, they have this kind of dueling narration giving us the back story, and it really works. It helps that it's not a &#34;36 hours earlier&#34; kind of scenario. It's the characters telling us about who they are, you know, as people, and that's what makes it work.As interesting as the story is, though, it's the acting that makes this movie. The performances, all of them, are incredible.Christian Bale shows us once again just what he's willing to do physically to become his character, this time putting on a bit of a paunch (which he shows off in the movie in a very unflattering way) and shaving a bald spot onto his head (also unflattering). He's what can only be described as a sleazy character, a con man, but, by the time we get back to the point in the story where it started, we have total sympathy for him. I just want to point out that I am not a Bale fan. I have respect for what he's willing to go through for a role (like in The Machinist and Rescue Dawn), and I think he's a good actor, but I don't really like him that much. That I say he was impressive in this role is, then, saying something.Amy Adams--cute, sweet Amy Adams--shows us she's anything but as an ex-stripper trying to reinvent herself. Her boobs should probably also have received some sort of credit. Not that they ever fully appear onscreen or anything, but it's hard not to be aware of them when she's onscreen. She's like some 70s porn star or something. Or like what I think a 70s porn star must have been like. I'm not really sure. At any rate, her performance is pretty amazing, and you're never quite sure what she's up to, just that she is up to... things. It's her performance that provides a lot of the tension in the movie, because you're never really sure whose side she's on. Well, other than her own, that is.Bradley Cooper is amazing as a somewhat overzealous FBI agent. And I'd say more about him, but I don't think I can without spoilers. I'll just say that I think Cooper has a certain intensity about him that not many actors can equal. And, according to my wife, he and Adams deliver one of the sexiest scenes she's ever seen. The amazing thing about that is that nothing happens in that scene. Well, not nothing but, you know, nothing happens: there is no loss of clothing or anything like that. But it's intense, and most of that is from him.Jennifer Lawrence continues to show that she's more than just a pretty face. I'm not quite sure she deserved her Oscar last year (not that her performance wasn't good; it was. I've just never been convinced it was &#34;best actress&#34; quality), but, if she gets a best supporting Oscar for this role, it will be deserved. The scene with her and the &#34;science oven&#34; is almost enough all by itself to earn her the Oscar.And, then, there's Jeremy Renner. And his hair. Because if Amy Adams boobs almost deserved a screen credit, Renner's hair certainly did. I could not take my eyes off of it. It was amazing. And, in a movie where everyone's hair was pretty amazing, that's saying something. This is the first movie I've seen him in where he shows me he can do something besides play &#34;taciturn hero&#34; (and, no, I haven't yet seen The Hurt Locker, but, knowing what it's about (loosely), I'm guess he plays &#34;taciturn hero&#34; in that one, too). He's pretty great as a New Jersey mayor in this. He's pretty great in the sense that I did not actually know he was in the movie before I was seeing the movie, and, then, I kept wondering if I was wrong and maybe that wasn't really him, so that, I think, is a pretty good performance.Louis C.K. also fit in nicely. I don't think there was any kind of stretch for him as an actor, but he worked well with everyone else. As did Elisabeth Rohm (from Angel); I didn't recognize her at all.The end result is a lot of compelling performances and an interesting plot. Enough so that, as I sit here writing this up, it makes me want to watch it again. Especially Jeremy Renner's hair. I don't think I've been so captivated by anyone's hair since the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl back in '93 (I think) and someone (Emmitt Smith?) poured a cooler of water over Jimmy Johnson's head, and his hair didn't move. It was like he had on a plastic, hair-shaped helmet. It was fascinating.Oh! And the cameo appearance by De Niro... the perfect touch.",5,Some of These Things Actually Happened,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,5595,"['things', 'actually', 'probably', 'not', 'many', 'least',

1679744,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00GMV8LIO,The People's Critic,"[2, 3]","Last year, a film about a top-secret 1979 CIA mission to rescue American diplomats during the Iranian hostage crisis took home the best picture Oscar.  This year, David O. Russell looks to keep this trend alive with American Hustle, a stylish story about the top-secret 1978 FBI sting operation, ABSCAM.David O. Russell has been an exciting filmmaker for several years now.  His previous three films, The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, and now American Hustle, have thrust Russell&#8217;s notoriety into a new echelon, however, by examining his previous quirky, clever, and unique films, Russell&#8217;s evolution can be clearly perceived.  1996&#8217;s Flirting With Disaster showed Russell&#8217;s quirky comedic tone.  In what some consider his best film, 1999&#8217;s Three Kings showcased Russell&#8217;s clever style.  Additionally, 2004&#8217;s I Heart Huckabees solidifies Russell&#8217;s unique writing.  Now it seems he&#8217;s hit his stride as his previous three films represent all three of these talents repurposed and mixed with tremendous results.Russell&#8217;s renaissance involves making films about memorable characters with his emerging cast of regular actors.  Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, Jennifer Lawrence, and Amy Adams have all been in at least two of his last three films, and all of them have received at least one Oscar nomination as a result &#8211; including two winners.  While rumors swirl around Russell&#8217;s ease to work with, he is able to coax performances from his actors like none other, and American Hustle is no exception.American Hustle opens against the gritty backdrop of 1978 New Jersey with a tone-setting title card that reads &#8220;Some of this actually happened.&#8221;  We are immediately introduced to con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) who runs a fledgling at best money lending scheme.  That all changes when he meets the seductive Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party.  As a team, they bring Rosenfeld&#8217;s scheme to the next level attracting the attention of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper).  DiMaso uses his leverage on the two con-artists to coerce them to cooperate with him in a series of operations designed to entrap high ranking politicians and power brokers including New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner).Now the story might seem complex enough as it is, but under the guise that &#8220;some of this actually happened,&#8221; Russell does this story one better with the introduction of Irving&#8217;s impulsive wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who could be the one who sends this whole operation crashing down.Bale gives another transformative performance, this time with an added 60 pounds, a comb-over, and a Bronx accent.  Adams continues her quest to become this generation&#8217;s Kevin Bacon by being in a movie with every relevant actor in existence.  She also gives a very strong performance as the mysterious Sydney who is &#8220;hell-on-wheels&#8221; wrapping every man around her finger and perpetually driving Irving crazy in the process.  Lawrence steals every scene she is in as Irving&#8217;s wildly capricious wife who won&#8217;t grant him a divorce and doesn&#8217;t know how to use a &#8220;science oven&#8221; either.  Renner and Cooper are very effective at representing both sides of the law in this wildly outrageous story where the line between hero and villain is very, very thin.Mayor Polito wants nothing more than to re-invent Atlantic City and make New Jersey a better place, but with his hands tied politically, he seeks the necessary capital from a seemingly interested Arab investor who is actually part of agent DiMaso&#8217;s operation.  Thus, what makes American Hustle most intriguing is Russell&#8217;s conscientious effort to construct an irony where con-men and FBI agents are working together to ostensibly take down a criminal who may be the most honorable character in the film.  American Hustle does have one element working against it, running time.  At around 130 minutes, most of which is rapid dialogue, the film feels a bit bloated.  There are many characters and they all have a lot to say.  From an acting standpoint, it is quite impressive, but from an audience standpoint the film slags a bit through its second half.There is plenty to like about American Hustle, far more than what&#8217;s not to like.  For those looking for an amazingly well made and well acted film that does not include the brutality of slavery or the primal fear of being lost in space, this is your movie.  B+American Hustle is rated R and has a running time of 2 hours and 9 minutes.  Keep any eye out for some great and surprising faces in some of the supporting roles.",4,'Eh-Merican Hustle',1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,4716,"['Last', 'year', 'film', 'top-secret', '1979', 'CIA',

1679749,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00GMV8LIO,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[1, 2]","When I first saw the title of this film, I thought it sounded kind of low brow, maybe one of those  I used to all teen sex flicks, or something that wouldn't appeal to me. Then someone on television news with whom I don't always disagree said it was really stellar, and about the ABSCAM scandal a few years ago. So that caught my interest.To be sure, it's about ABSCAM, but it's closer to a black comedy distantly portraying ABSCAM that ""about"" it. And it's worth seeing, if for no other reason, the acting is formidable.By the way, as much a ""politico"" as I am, ABSCAM doesn't mean as much to me as many a scandal. I think I lived in Asia while it took place so my exposure to it was limited. So my interest in it was not as powerful as that of other scandals. But it still interested me.Now, when the film started, the actor playing the lead, was Bradley Cooper. He looked familiar but I couldn't remember when I'd seen him before. Someone in the theatre reminded me he was inSilver Linings Playbook. Wow. He must have gained a lot of weight for this role! I waited for the credits at the end of the film to see his I think they called him ""dialect coach,"" Bob Corff, who earned his keep!And Sydney Prosser was played by Amy Adams. I've seen her play anywhere from a nun (Doubt) to a scoundrel's wife (The Master) and lots of other roles so I wasn't prepared for a role in which she bordered on the erotic in this one. She's certainly among the best.Overall the praise seems to go to Christian Bale, who played the FBI zealot, Irving Rosenfeld, trying to make a name for himself. As critics pointed out, he's Welsh, yet, in this role sounded like he was from the `hood!Then another character, Richie's wife, Rosalyn, looked familiar. Where had I seen her before? Ahh, yes. She played the--was she bipolar?--character for which she was awarded the Oscar inSilver Linings Playbook, again. She was so good in this one that I'm almost afraid for her that she might be typecast. To call her behavior ""eccentric"" is somewhat of an understatement. But, very, very well done.In terms of credit,  Robert DeNiro plays Victor Tellegio in this film, and I don't see him in the credits.  Even my favorite database lists him as uncredited. Perhaps he'd rather not be listen again as a mobster, which has become a little of a stereotype especially afterAnalyze This, andAnalyze That, both of them classics.I'm afraid that anything I say might give away elements of the story that I'd rather not spoil. It's certainly entertaining. Another benefit is that it's not so ""black and white."" I mean, for example, Atlantic City Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) might have been accepting bribes. But his interests were probably more for his community overall than just for personal gain. (And he appeared to be a happy and loyal family man too, contrary to the stereotype of the randy, promiscuous crook).It's well worth seeing, very entertaining, superbly acted. But I recommend you see it, again, as a black comedy with remote scandal suggestion. If you plan to see it as a docudrama, you'll be let down.",4,Not so much a docudrama but worth seeing,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,3089,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'title', 'film', 'thought', 'sounded', 'kind', 'low', 'brow', 'maybe', 'one', 'used', 'teen', 'sex', 'flicks', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'Then', 'someone', 'television', 'news', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'disagree', 'said', 'was', 'really', 'stellar', 'ABSCAM', 'scandal', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'caught', 'interest.To', 'be', 'sure', 'ABSCAM', 'closer', 'black', 'comedy', 'distantly', 'portraying', 'ABSCAM', 'worth', 'seeing', 'other', 'reason', 'acting', 'formidable.By', 'way', 'much', 'politico', 'am', 'ABSCAM', ""n't"", 'mean', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'scandal', 'think', 'lived', 'Asia', 'took', 'place', 'so', 'exposure', 'was', 'limited', 'So', 'interest', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'powerful', 'other', 'scandals', 'still', 'interested', 'me.Now', 'when', 'film', 'started', 'actor', 'playing', 'lead', 'was', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'looked', 'familiar', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'when', ""'d"", 'seen', 'before', 'Someone', 'theatre', 'reminded', 'was', 'inSilver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'Wow', 'must', 'have', 'gained', 'lot', 'weight', 'role', 'waited', 'credits', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'think', 'called', 'dialect', 'coach', 'Bob', 'Corff', 'who', 'earned', 'keep', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'was', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'anywhere', 'nun', 'Doubt', 'scoundrel', 'wife', 'Master', 'lots', 'other', 'roles', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'role', 'bordered', 'erotic', 'one', 'certainly', 'best.Overall', 'praise', 'go', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'played', 'FBI', 'zealot', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'trying', 'make', 'name', 'critics', 'pointed', 'out', 'Welsh', 'yet', 'role', 'sounded', 'was', 'hood', 'Then', 'character', 'Richie', 'wife', 'Rosalyn', 'looked', 'familiar', 'Where', 'had', 'seen', 'Ahh', 'yes', 'played', 'was', 'bipolar', 'character', 'was', 'awarded', 'Oscar', 'inSilver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'again', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'one', ""'m"", 'almost', 'afraid', 'might', 'be', 'typecast', 'call', 'behavior', 'eccentric', 'somewhat', 'understatement', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'done.In', 'terms', 'credit', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Victor', 'Tellegio', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'credits', 'Even', 'favorite', 'database', 'uncredited', 'Perhaps', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'be', 'listen', 'again', 'mobster', 'become', 'little', 'stereotype', 'especially', 'classics.I', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'anything', 'say', 'might', 'give', 'away', 'elements', 'story', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'spoil', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'benefit', 'not', 'so', 'black', 'white', 'mean', 'example', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Mayor', 'Carmine', 'Polito', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'accepting', 'bribes', 'interests', 'were', 'probably', 'more', 'community', 'overall', 'just', 'personal', 'gain', 'appeared', 'be', 'happy', 'loyal', 'family', 'man', 'too', 'contrary', 'stereotype', 'randy', 'promiscuous', 'crook', '.It', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'very', 'entertaining', 'superbly', 'acted', 'recommend', 'see', 'again', 'black', 'comedy', 'remote', 'scandal', 'suggestion', 'plan', 'see', 'docudrama', ""'ll"", 'be', 'let', 'down']",N/A

One night at a party he meets a woman named Sydney Prosser (Adams) and his life is changed. He not only finds a new lover but also a new partner. When she sets up a deal that goes bad they are forced to work for the FBI or spend their lives in jail. The opening of the movie states that &#34;some of this actually happened&#34; so this isn't really a true story just as a heads up. I wanted to see this movie for one reason...the cast. The cast in this is amazing and how can a movie with this cast be bad? The answer to that slowly revealed itself as I watched. It boiled down to the fact that none of the characters were really like-able at all and because of that I felt no connection to any of them. The cardinal sin for any movie is for the watcher not to be involved in the characters lives, if you don't care about them then it doesn't matter what happens in the movie. That is how I felt watching this. Bale did a great job in this but I found it really hard to get into the movie and couldn't find anyone to root for or even care for. That fact alone brought down the enjoyment of the movie and when it ended I was very disappointed by what I saw. Overall, a big disappointment, especially with this cast.

1679760,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00GMV8LIO,Turfseer,"[26, 39]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***David O. Russell, now a shining light in the American film industry, has returned after his recent success with ""Silver Linings Playbook'. His new entry for the Oscar competition is 'American Hustle', which is loosely based on the ABSCAM scandals of the late 70s and early 80s.Russell's new picture aspires to be an updated 'Good Fellas'; except here, the protagonists are not Mafiosi but low rent con artists. The story begins slowly as a narrator fills in the background of the story's anti-hero, Irving Rosenfeld, part legitimate owner of a couple of dry cleaning establishments out on Long Island and part unsavory loan shark and middleman for art forgers. Christian Bale as Rosenfeld probably does the most convincing job of the principal actors in conveying just how this petty criminal fell from grace (notably Bale gained fifty pounds for the role).Less successful is Amy Adams, who plays Sydney Prosser, Rosenfeld's con artist girlfriend who pretends to be a British aristocrat ('Lady Edith Greensley'). There's just something about Adams that prevents me (no matter how hard she tries) in believing that she can play the role of a true 'bad girl' (others, of course, are free to disagree).The break into Act 2 occurs when the FBI catches Irving and Sydney perpetuating one of their loan scams and forces them to help flush out four new marks. Sydney wants to flee the country but Irving refuses, since he's still married and has a young son. As it turns out, the film's antagonist really is Richie, played by an over the top Bradley Cooper, as a belligerent FBI agent, who continually pressures Irving to cooperate and browbeats his own boss to accept some of his far-fetched plans.David O. Russell has been quoted as saying that he concentrated more on the characters' stories, rather than the overall plot. Nonetheless, a good deal of the dialogue is improvised and I found many of the interpersonal scenes to be unnecessarily drawn out (Jennifer Lawrence has little to do as Rosalyn, Irving's over emotional wife, who eventually comes to accept that Irving is no longer attracted to her).Much of the principals' machinations are supposed to be comic in nature-- particularly Ritchie, who at one point slugs his boss in the face with a telephone. Ritchie reminds me of Cooper's character in 'Silver Linings', who also can't control his temper.Unfortunately, it's really the 'Hustle' story itself that leaves quite a bit to be desired. It's a story virtually devoid of any high stakes. The whole idea of course is that this is a story of low stakes--and we're supposed to be bemused by the characters' pettiness. But much of the pettiness simply isn't very compelling at all.We have such low moments in Act II, as Sydney convincing the FBI secretary to make the $2 million unauthorized wire transfer and then Richie's boss' boss, Amado, who inexplicably green lights Richie's escapades. The bulk of the machinations involves Richie's quest to entrap Polito, the corrupt Camden, New Jersey mayor. The closest we get to high drama is when Polito brings Irving's fake sheik to a casino party, where they end up meeting a real mobster, Victor Tellegio, a former Meyer Lansky associate played by Robert Deniro. Tellegio tries to outfox the 'sheik' by speaking Arabic, but Irving's friend turns the tables by showing that he knows Arabic too.The rest of 'American Hustle' is anti-climactic. With the Camden Mayor's assistance, a number of Congressmen are taken down, after they accept bribes. The big 'twist' at the end is too little and too late. It's not necessary to reveal the ending, but suffice it to say that the FBI's plan to fry some bigger fish, goes awry.I'm not sure whether it was that I didn't really care too much about the principals and their back stories or whether the twists and turns in the plot amounted to nothing more than 'small potatoes'. I do know that the film's Hollywood happy ending has nothing to do with what happened in real life (the wife committed suicide and the mistress divorced Mel Weinberg, Irving's real-life prototype, and no longer talks to him).If there's anything good to say about this film, it has more to do with the recreation of the late 70s era, replete with all those golden oldies on the soundtrack. It's too bad that most of the characters here, never rise above the level of caricature.The subjects of the real hustle here, appear to have involved all those critics, who lapped up this overrated cinematic sleight of hand, in their desperate desire to discover a new Scorcese-like auteur.",2,Critics end up getting hustled by this cinematic 'Good Fellas' wannabe,1389916800,"01 17,

It stars Christian Bale and Amy Adams as two con artists who are forced by an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to set up an elaborate sting operation on corrupt politicians, including the mayor of Camden, New Jersey (Jeremy Renner). Jennifer Lawrence plays the unpredictable wife of Bale's character.It&#8217;s hard to believe in the relationship or any chemistry between Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney (Amy Adams). They seem to be people who would never genuinely attracted to one another. Sydney appears to be too sophisticated to have any true feelings. Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) seems to be so disrespectful of him that it&#8217;s hard to believe the lengths she goes to keep (?) him. Lawrence compensates for her Rosalyn's character flaws with unbridled energy but her emotional outbursts and screaming wears annoyingly on the nerves.Bradley Cooper's performance of the FBI fluctuates between blind self-assuredness and insecure cockiness. It becomes entertaining to watch his character get his comeuppance.In the film, Camden mayor Carmine Polito is shown as a selfless politician who gets involved in the scam to provide jobs to his constituents but it&#8217;s unrealistic that a person such as Irving would go to the lengths he goes to for Carmine.The sheik scene is so fruitless in that it doesn't seem that it would have ever been believable.

To be honest, it didn't look like the type of movie I would usually be interested in, but that dynamite cast mixed with overwhelmingly positive reviews got me in a theater seat.  I enjoyed the film and thought it was an exciting mix of cast interactions, period (1970s) references, and some really great music.  I just don't understand why it is being nominated for so many prestigious awards.For a basic plot summary, &#34;American Hustle&#34; tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), two individuals who, after a chance meeting, set out on a life of &#34;hustling&#34; (mainly by charging fees on loans that will never develop).  When they are eventually busted by F.B.I. agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), they are given a deal to work together with the government to take down some &#34;big boys&#34; of crime.The reason this film works so well is because director David O. Russell is such a master of character interactions.  He just has that innate ability to pick a perfect cast and then make literally every interaction between them mean something (whether dramatic, comedic, or any other range of emotion).  Plus, the 1970s atmosphere is fun to be flung into, complete with vintage clothing, music, and set pieces.  There are some negatives to this film, but its main positive is that it has the ability to completely sweep away the viewer and engulf them in every aspect of the movie.The reason I can't give &#34;American Hustle&#34; five stars or consider it a &#34;classic&#34; movie?  The story is a bit weak.  I left the theater (despite being dazzled by the things I described above) thinking &#34;what was the take-home message of this film?&#34;  I felt as if the plot meandered a bit and wasn't as rock solid as perhaps it could/should have been.  Maybe this is somewhat of a Russell &#34;trademark&#34;, though, as I gave a similar four-star ranking to last year's &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; for similar reasons.Thus, my overall verdict for &#34;American Hustle&#34; was that it was a rip-roaring good time at the theater...but nothing worthy of major awards (perhaps with the exception of Amy Adams, whom I thought gave the best performance of the show).  I still think that &#34;The Fighter&#34; is the best movie directed by Mr. O Russell.  Other than that, though, this is a picture that can (and probably should be) watched twice in order to catch all of its complexities.",4,Cinema Fun At Its Finest (But Is It Really Worthy Of All The Awards?),1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,2531,"['Going', 'see', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'interested', 'dynamite', 'cast', 'mixed', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'got', 'theater', 'seat', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'exciting', 'mix', 'cast', 'interactions', 'period', '1970s', 'references', 'really', 'great', 'music', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'being', 'nominated', 'so', 'many', 'prestigious', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'story', 'Irving', 'Rosenfeld', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Sydney', 'Prosser', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'chance', 'meeting', 'set', 'out', 'life', '34', 'hustling', '34', 'mainly', 'charging', 'fees', 'loans', 'will', 'never', 'develop', 'When', 'are', 'eventually', 'busted', 'F.B.I', 'agent', 'Richie', 'DiMaso', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'are', 'given', 'deal', 'work', 'together', 'government', 'take', 'down', '34', 'big', 'boys', '34', 'crime.The', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'such', 'master', 'character', 'interactions', 'just', 'innate', 'ability', 'pick', 'perfect', 'cast', 'then', 'make', 'literally', 'interaction', 'mean', 'something', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'other', 'range', 'emotion', '1970s', 'atmosphere', 'fun', 'be', 'flung', 'complete', 'vintage', 'clothing', 'music', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'negatives', 'film', 'main', 'positive', 'ability', 'completely', 'sweep', 'away', 'viewer', 'engulf', 'aspect', 'movie.The', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'five', 'stars', 'consider', '34', 'classic', '34', 'movie', 'story', 'bit', 'weak', 'left', 'theater', 'being', 'dazzled', 'things', 'described', 'thinking', '34', 'was', 'take-home', 'message', 'film', '34', 'felt', 'plot', 'meandered', 'bit', 'was', ""n't"", 'rock', 'solid', 'perhaps', 'could/should', 'have', 'been', 'Maybe', 'somewhat', 'Russell', '34', 'trademark', '34', 'though', 'gave', 'similar', 'four-star', 'ranking', 'last', 'year', '34', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', '34', 'similar', 'reasons.Thus', 'overall', 'verdict', '34', 'American', 'Hustle', '34', 'was', 'was', 'rip-roaring', 'good', 'time', 'theater', 'nothing', 'worthy', 'major', 'awards', 'perhaps', 'exception', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'whom', 'thought', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'show', 'still', 'think', '34', 'Fighter', '34', 'best', 'movie', 'directed', 'Mr.', 'O', 'Russell', 'Other', 'though', 'picture', 'can', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'twice', 'order', 'catch', 'complexities']",N/A
