I've never actually been a waiter, but all the stories I've heard from friends have been exactly like the ones portrayed here on film.The movie basically relies on disgusting gags to get most of the laughs, but there are a few more insightful moments, especially at the end.

David Koechner is every manager you've ever worked for (""the difference between ordinary and extraordinary....is just that litte extra""), and I truly hope that the portrayal of the chefs wasn't based on any true story, though I have my suspicions.

959641,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000CPH9PM,A. Estes,"[4, 7]","If you've ever worked in a restaurant, even for a brief period, you will appreciate this movie. If you have never stepped foot in a kitchen or put on an apron and waited tables, you really need to take a look at the way things are. ""Waiting"" delivers an excellent portrayal of what it is to be a restaurant worker. As someone who has spent six years of his life in restaurants, I can tell you first hand that this movie hits the nail on the head.  From the toilet humor of the back-of-the-house to the intolerable demands of waiting on needy people, newcomer Rob McKittrick covers every aspect of the job. Coupled with an outstanding cast and enough jokes to fill a healthy appetite, ""Waiting"" is possibly the most underrated (but soon to be classic) comedy of the new millennium.Now, if you haven't worked in a restaurant, I should warn: you really won't find this movie that funny. And on that note, I don't find this to be the funniest movie ever. Where I got my satisfaction was in the story and how real the characters and situations are. ""Waiting"" is as true to life as a restaurant can be, even with some characters that seem truly absurd. The restaurant itself, ""ShenaniganZ"" bears a striking resemblance to chain restaurants in the vein of Applebees (and no, it's not the same restaurant from ""Super Troopers"") and is a character all itself. As authentic as it could possibly be, right down to the cheesy nostalgia pieces on the wall. The cast is a varied and brilliant one, with Ryan Reynolds and Anna Faris taking the reigns, among Justin Long, Luis Guzman, comedian Dane Cook, a pre-fame Andy Milonakis, and Jordan Ladd, among others. All are spot on in their roles, and I swear, all of these characters are true to life, right down the gang-banging busboys.The movie could be compared to other on-the-job classics like ""Clerks"" and ""Office Space"" and it definitely deserves it's rank among them. ""Waiting"" is the only movie I've seen that entirely revolves around restaurant work and it is pretty spot on. Don't be fooled: This isn't a ""teen movie"" or just a ""potty humor"" movie. No, it goes far beyond such gimmicks. ""Waiting"" is simply a movie for those unfortunate enough to get trapped in the restaurant world.

Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[15, 24]","Taking it's cue from Clerks, Waiting... is a movie about a day in the life of the employees of the restaurant ShenaniganZ. This movie is filled with plenty of obnoxious characters, cheap laughs, and no story at all, but still, it's a hilarious movie nonetheless. Not a lot can really be said about this movie other than that, had a story actually been put into the setting and characters of Waiting... it would have been terrible. Instead, we get endless fart jokes, a lot of mature situations, with a little (or a lot) of bush. The cast, while not filled with superstars, has a lot of well-known actors and actresses, which seems to validate this ridiculous attempt at film-making. All I can really say is that this movie has to be seen to be believed. And once you see it, you'll never eat out again.This movie is especially good for fans of Kevin Smith movies, as it follows in the same vein.

After viewing the video and getting tired from laughing so much I can say, YES! IT'S ALL TRUE! IT IS REALLY LIKE THAT!. Speaking as a former professional server, I'm sure this film will open the eyes of (and perhaps frighten) restaurant patrons. It was all familiar to me, from the examples of customers the servers love--or, love to hate, to the behavior of the manager, and onward to the realtionships and personal lives of the employees. Did I enjoy my job and have as much fun and frustration as these workers? Yes, and if you ask anyone who has worked this type of job and seen this film I'm certain they will give you the same answer. I'm not going to be specific in the review because to tell anything about the situations you will see is to spoil the surprise effect of seeing what goes on while you are eating your meal. When we sit down and are served, the type of service we receive is always one of the topics of conversation. This movie reveals what is said when the people being served provide the topic of conversation for the servers. Watch the special features too, because you'll learn about the writer/director.

There are a few good laughs, but nothing to make me want to go back and rewatch it. If I happen to a catch it on TV I won't watch it again. This story centers around a restaurant names ""Shenannigans"", I'm surprised Hannigans or Bennigans didn't sue them considering what is done to the customers food. Actually maybe they did and I didn't hear about it. Teenagers may find this very amusing, until they grow up and someone does it to their food. I was once a Maitre D' so when I caught a bus boy spitting in the potato salad, the rest the staff didn't think it was funny and he was immediately fired.You can say chill, it's a comedy, or whatever you like, the bottom line is people do this in real life and ""IT AIN""T FUNNY!!!!!!!"". So that said, if you find it gross to show people putting hair, spit, and other things from the body in food, you may want to stay clear of this one. Anyone that thinks this is cool should probably be seeing a psychiatrist. Anyone that needs to get back at people by messing with their food has a problem. The only other thing it covers is guys showing their genitalia off so they can kick someone else in the butt in a game of ""how orignal can I be at showing them and naming that method"".

959659,AOXC7HI3O8JWI,B000CPH9PM,"Carlo San Juan ""Caz MD""","[2, 4]","Dean (Justin Long) is about to start another long day as a waiter in Shenanigan's (think TGI Friday's) when he realizes, after hearing news that a high school classmate is now an electrical engineer, he has had the same dead-end job for four years.  His friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is showing a new trainee, Mitch (John Francis Daley), the ropes on being a waiter in the restaurant.  He places the utmost importance in schooling the fresh recruit on a particular game the staff is passionate about (this involves exposure of a body organ which I will not identify and starts with ""p"" and ends with ""enis"") to pass the time away.  Monty also introduces the trainee to the rest of the staff.  Head chef Raddimus (Luis Guzman) and his girlfriend/bartender Danielle (Jordan Ladd), busboy/stoners (Andy Milonakis and Max Kasch), wise man dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride), the eternally cursing waitress (Alanna Ubach), shy urinator/waiter and 'too niceguy' Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), the too-beautiful-to-be-working-here-and-knows-it waitress Serena (Anna Faris), and the underage hostess (Vanessa Lengies) comprise some of the crackpot staff.  All led by the trying-to-be-hip manager Dan (David Koechner) who has placed his job on an incredible pedestal.As soon as the concept of the film becomes apparent, Kevin Smith's Clerks comes to mind.  It seems that Randal and Dante's convenience store adventures were a clear inspiration to filmmaker Rob McKittrick's Waiting... (the wannabe rappers/stoners/busboys... Jay and Silent Bob, anyone?)The cast plays their limited characters remarkably well, to the film's fledgling credit.  Ryan Reynolds, however, is beginning to seem like he acts the same in every film he's in.  Like a less motivated Jason Lee.  Much kudos goes to Dane Cook and John Francis Daley who brighten the screen at the exact moments when you need a gasp for air because the movie was beginning to drown.That's right.  The film loses steam very quickly and has a coal replenishment far too few times.  Granted, the parts that made me laugh made me laugh hard but the rest of the flick seemed to drag on and on.  Plots and sub-plots are only mildly entertaining and only a few of them receive their justified conclusions.If anything, you do leave with a little more respect for your humble waiter.  It also reinforces a cardinal rule: Don't mess with someone who handles your food.It was a valiant effort and a noble concept but for all it's bravado it was clearly apparent that Waiting... was a freshman film.  But it shows McKittrick's promise as a filmmaker.  For now, however, if you feel like frathouse humor and silly, crude funnies, see it.  Otherwise, don't expect the smarts and charm of Clerks.

But what makes it stand out from the majority of these usually brainless and nearly unwatchable movies is the sharply written script by first time writer/director Rob McKittrick.  McKittrick knows his subject, as he was writing from personal experience.  The characters are well fleshed out and recognizable, and the dialogue is quite funny and intelligent.  The ensemble cast - Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris, and Justin Long among them - do a great job.As others have already mentioned, ""Waiting"" is like ""Office Space"", in that it is a movie focused on one peculiar micro-culture of our modern society.  Instead of Cubical-ville, the characters live in the world of those familiar chain restaurants with the ersatz instant ""history"" and ""character"" stuck to the walls, where the waiters gather at your table to sing ""Happy Birthday"".  Think T.G.I.F. or Bubba Gump, more upscale than Denny's or Carrow's, less upscale than Macaroni Grill (the local one here has someone, usually the head waiter or a cute girl, sing ""Happy Birthday"" in Italian, as an aria).And, I now appreciate so much more the budget steakhouses like Ponderosa/Bonanza that show you the cooks grilling the steaks right in front of the customers.  Great idea, all restaurants should do that...Yes, this movie is what happens after the ""coming of age"" movie, when the kids leave the comforts of home to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives.

The theater that i saw it in had a little girl in it about 8 years old. I thought that was a crappy thing to do on the parents part because this movie has a lot of sexual, crude jokes.

Featuring a day in the life of the restaurant Shenanigan's (a fictitious chain based on any number of eateries we all know and love), the viewer is witness to the antics of its screwball staff as they interact with one another--but even more importantly, with the restaurant's unsuspecting patrons.  Accordingly we get the typical sophomoric hijinks:  From scratching dandruff onto a steak sent back for more cooking, to a nonsensical initiation ritual for new employees.  But hey, some of it's funny, some of it's lame--all of it's forgettable.An obnoxious film should have an obnoxious cast, and here WAITING doesn't disappoint.  Ryan Reynolds as a snooty waiter (who gets the film's best line:  ""Never [tick] off the people handling your food."") is as good as obnoxious gets.  Other cast members include Luiz Guzman, John Francis Daley, Dane Cook, and David Koechner.  Come on, that's like the Obnoxious Hall of Fame.  Disappointments include Anna Faris, who doesn't get to show off her considerable comedic talents, and Justin Long, who needs to quit with the pity party and grow a pair.

Waiting is a hilarious movie with addresses restaurant worker common place events like singing the birthday songs, workers that think they know everything about the world, the working couples who can't keep their hands off of each other, rude customers, the bitchy waitresses who turns on the charm for the customers and the infamous people who decide to come in for dinner five minutes before closing time. While some may consider this a Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder) vehicle, its really the entire ensemble cast that makes this film a winner. Ryan is the cute guy with the wise lines, but it is the Justin Long character with the more reflective role. Justin stars in the film as a young waiter with the potential to become assistant manager at the restaurant they work at Shenanigans. He's not sure if he wants the position and is conflicted about being stuck at Shenanigans forever.The entire cast is funny. Character actor Luis Guzman appears in the film as an oversexed kitchen worker and Chi McBride appears in the film as the dishwasher who shares his experience and insight with everyone whether they ask for it or not. Andy Milokanis has a small but hilarious role as a bus boy who aspires to be a rapper.Waiting is the funniest comedy I have ever seen about restaurant life. It so accurately paints a picture of the young restaurant staff. The manager who lusts after a young employee, the staff who hangs our after hours, the rude customers, and most of all the conflicted feeling servers feel whether they enjoy their job or not.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 11]","Workplace comedies are something that strike a chord in us all -- most people have held less-than-glamorous tuition-paying jobs, and sometimes resented the people we have been forced to deal with politely. No tips. Annoying coworkers. Twerpy customers who just don't get it, at all.That's the main idea of Rob McKittrick's ""Waiting..."", a pale imitation of Kevin Smiths' breakout film ""Clerks."" It could have been a delightful comedy in the vein of ""Office Space,"" but alas, we get a pale, rather cliched comedy with a few gem-like moments.Mitch (John Francis Daley) is starting his first day on the job at Shenanigan's, and he rapidly learns that the ropes are tangled and grubby. There's a philosophical dishwasher (Chi McBride), a smart-aleck, the nice guy with issues, a snarling dominatrix, and a sexpot waittress. And that's only the beginning...Though Shenanigan's seems normal, there are drunken parties, crazed employees, and food seasoned with dandruff. With disdain for the customers and for each other, the employees spar, stare, and make jokes that will instantly offend gays, women and people with Down Syndrome. Can Dean (Justin Long) manage to get a decent job, or will he sink into the mire of Shenanigan's kitchen?Anybody who has ever worked a minimum wage job like this will know that it's a gold mine for comedy. I myself have fond memories of a coworker going ballistic when a customer demanded that she spread the cream cheese for him. Unfortunately, that kind of delightful comedy isn't present. Instead, we get armpit-noise-level stuff -- bodily substances being spread on food, and so on.Even crude films can be funny... but this one isn't. It's just moronic. McKittrick tries to spice it up with stuff like the ""Penis Game"" and workplace Lolitas, but it's a bit like trying to rescuscitate a week-old dead moose. Even the name of the restaurant is lame -- okay, Shenanigan's, we get it. The place has shenanigans. It's not really very funny anyway.The characters are all cliches of the slacker worker, and they are so uniformly nasty that you really hope they rot behind those counters. It's a credit to the actors that they manage to inject any humour at all; Daley of ""Freaks and Geeks"" fame is the most entertaining character of all, and the only one that shows a spark of life.The only thing that could be as bad as working at Shenanigan's is watching a gross-out comedy full of obnoxious stereotypes.

I was a waiter for a year and a half at a small pizzareia in New Jersey, and although I left almost two months ago, I still have the battle scars and war stories. So, tonight, me and my friend (who is a cook at a restaurant, but not the same one) went to see it, loving comedy, and both being restaurant vets. Man, are we glad we did! ""Waiting..."" delivers!As you've probably guessed (or found out) by now, the movie revolves around the day in the life of a group of employees at Shenanigan's Restaurant (similar to a TGI Friday's/Ruby Tuesday/Applebee's/etc.). It mostly deals with the waiters, including Monty, the more popular one, Mitch, the clueless trainee (who is hilarious in the end - not giving it away but watch!), Serena, the sassy waitress, Naomi, the irate one, et cetera. This movie also features Dane Cook, Luis Guzman, Dave Koechner, et cetera, playing great, hilarious roles.Not only is the movie very funny and well-written, but it has so many truths about the restaurant world. Think that incredibly rude lady complaining about the steak in the trailer (you have to see the whole scene in the movie to get the full effect, heh) is over the top? Heh, no, sadly, not really. Now do you see what waiters/waitresses have to put up with? Other truthful parts in the movie is Justin Long confronting a cheapskate hillbilly after getting a crappy tip (wish I would've had the guts to do that back then), and oh man, I can sympathize with the cooks in the movie when the idiot comes in two minutes before closing. (I always had the same reaction too, haha)Also worth noting is Dave Koechner's character Dan, as the bumbling doofus manager type. Man, that part was played to a T! He reminds me so much of this [jerk] manager I used to have when I worked at A&P; a couple of years ago.In closing, ""Waiting..."" is everything it's cracked up to be and more. If you are or ever were a waiter/waitress, DEFINITELY see this. If not, see it anyway so you get an idea of what they all put up with.

959680,A92LD431P843F,B000CPH9PM,E. Lambeth,"[1, 5]","I couldn't finish it.I was really excited to see Waiting, too. This type of comedy is right up my alley. But the dialogue was not funny in the least. From the start, Ryan Reynolds sells this game to the new guy where you have to show your genitalia to another employee and make them look. And if they do, you get to kick them in the rear. Are you laughing yet? Because this joke was sold for at least 3/4 of the movie (that's as long as I lasted).The jokes were laid out in a way to make sure you'd get the joke. No subtlety at all...which completely kills the joke. The PITA customer said the food has been horrible the LAST FOUR TIMES she's been there. And the obvious answer to that is, why do you keep coming back? The problem is, she emphasizes the LAST FOUR TIMES, because the writer/director wants to make sure you don't miss the joke in there. They're dumbing down their comedy which makes it much less funny. This is done throughout the movie.So what you have is Ryan Reynolds as the star of the movie, who is a natural at comedy but has no good dialogue to deliver. You've got the guy from Ed and one of the crappier Die Hard movies as a depressed kid because he was a high school honors student but too lazy to use that to his advantage, and the good looking girl that loves him.

We've met customers who you hate, love, mean, friendly, and always wanted to say something to them, but risked losing their jobs. Sometimes a job is all you have.Many critics call this an immature, gross-out snore, but I call it a hilarious, gross-out reality.

I love gross humor like anyone else but this movie did not work for me.  the characters were typical and uninteresting.  the trailer was much funnier and basically it showed you the funniest moments. in the film those scenes came into the movies first 15 mins!!!!.  the rest of the movie went down the drain.  this is one restaurant worth closing.",2,waiting: to laugh?,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,659,"['WAITING', 'seemed', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'seemed', 'really', 'not', 'movie', 'small', 'vignettes', 'tied', 'together', 'sure', 'one', 'scene', 'led', 'overall', 'seemed', 'very', 'predictable', 'times', 'boring', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'humor', 'shock', 'value', 'unfortunately', 'viewer-goes', 'nowhere', 'love', 'gross', 'humor', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'characters', 'were', 'typical', 'uninteresting', 'trailer', 'was', 'much', 'funnier', 'basically', 'showed', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'scenes', 'came', 'movies', 'first', '15', 'mins', 'rest', 'movie', 'went', 'drain', 'one', 'restaurant', 'closing']",N/A

959700,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000CPH9PM,Jason W. Kaiser,"[1, 2]","I will never bitch at any individual at a restaurant again,  be it dishwasher or waiter!!!!!!!!!!! After seeing this I'm not so sure I even want to eat out ever again.....Anyway, Ryan Reynolds continues his excellent performances, he is really an amazing comedic actor, period. I have now seen him in Blade 3, Buying The Cow, Amityville Horror, and now Waiting, and the guy steals every scene he is in. His newest movie Just Friends comes out March 7th and you can bet I'll be there Tuesday morning to pick it up, if only for Reynolds. Now back to Waiting, the plot is quite simple, the daily rituals of six or seven 22-25 year olds working at one of the hottest restuarants in town. Ryan Reynolds plays Monty, the 'leader' of the group if you will who is assigned to train Mitch (played amusingly by John Frances Daley, I know, I'd never heard of him either) Even before Mitch can get a word in edgewise, Monty stars telling him about the penis game, which is brutally funny, this is a constant running joke throughout the entire movie, if you can get any of your male co-workers to look at your 'package' you get to kick them in the ass anywhere from 1 to 3 times depending on the severity of the penis position, but first YOU have to call THEM a fag, interesting huh?Reynolds is letting jokes and disses fly here and there every 5 seconds, and to tell you the truth, almost all of them hit, he is so naturally funny and easy-going and his delivery is almost always perfect. Justin Long (remember him? our Jeepers Creepers boy?) plays Dean, Monty's best friend and roomate, and he at 22 is already having a midlife crisis, his mom tells him about 1 of his high school buddies who just graduated college and his getting this amazing high-paying job, implying that Dean is doing nothing and that he is still a waiter at 22. So naturally, Dean is a wee bit depressed and is not sure what he wants to do with his life. He has some genuine hilarious moments when he and the manager are 'chatting' about him becoming assistant manager.Another great character is Serena, played by Anna Faris (she of Scary Movie 1,2 and 3 fame) She has a on again off again thing going with Monty and when they have a huge arguement in front of the whole staff about there sex life tears will come to your eyes, it's very funny. Dan the mangaer (David Koechner) is a real sleaze, and he is constantly hitting on the 17-year old hostess Natasha played by Vanessa Langies, she leads him on inviting him to a big party but giving him the wrong address sending him to a disgruntled redneck customer who happens to open the door in his tidy whities screaming ""did ya bring my gift certificates?""Dane Cook and Luis Guzman play a couple of the cooks and they are drop-dead funny, during a scene in which a really bitchy lady sends her steak back and the things these two add to 'fix' the problem is not only a complete riot, but disgusting and also scary as hell, thus my claim in the first sentence of this review!!! Ya know it's funny, people consider this movie a box office flop, and true it only grossed 16.5 million, but it cost a whopping 1 million to make, I don't know about you, but I'd take that return on any investment in a heartbeat.So yes, a rather simple plot, but with all the great jokes and the great performances, you really won't mind much. If I had to give it any complaints, it does have the incredibly lame and unfunny Andy Milonakis, he and Max Kasch play a couple of whipped cream sniffing, wanna-be brother bus boys. It's a little funny at first, but it gets real stale by the end of the movie, and if you watch the very funny outakes on the DVD skip the one with them freestyling, it's just wrong and over-the-top vulgar. The performance by Alanna Ubach as Naomi, an extremely stressed out waitress, while over-acted and in your face, is precious. And just remember this advice 'Don't #%$%@* with the people who bring you your food'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!acting......4 stars, Reynolds, Faris, Long, Dane Cook and Alanna Ubach are all perfect, they draw alot of laughsdirecting.....3.5 stars, I'm thinking with this crew, this was pretty painless to make, alot of joking around I betspecial effects....N/Acomedy rating....4 stars, Alot of laughs to be

959701,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000CPH9PM,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","The people at Shenanigan's restaurant are an old mix of characters, never making their jobs boring by the amount of shenanigans of their own. The odd mix of characters of waiting makes this such a fun film. It's just not focused upon the three main characters; Monty, Dean and Serena, the background characters have their own personalities and dilemmas, adding so much more story. The development of the characters aren't fully developed, but you can still understand and sympathies to their problems. The characters are clich?d; you have seen a lot of them before; but they are so well placed and interact perfectly; there is realism to them.The major point of ""Waiting"" is the black humor that runs through it. It doesn't work off big set pieces and outlandish situations to make you laugh; the humor organically comes out of the characters from their dialog. A lot of the dialog is perverse, but it never seems out of place. ""Waiting"" does perfectly reflect the relationship between customer and waiter; well I did. Rob McKittrick unashamedly shows this interaction; the smart-ass customer who always complains, the regulars, and what could go behind the walls when the customers push to hard.Ryan Reynolds brings another eccentric performance forward. He had been stuck with that eccentric ego in a lot of movies; but he does it perfectly and does another great job again. Anna Faris had finally lost that ditsy persona and shows a broader range of acting; bringing a great performance. Justin Long does have a puppy dog face a lot of the time, but really comes forward in the more serious moments. All the other actors as the employees all do wonderful performances, making the background character more interesting.In many ways this movie can be compared to another successful cult comedy by the name of ""Office Space"". Both films are about what really happens in a stressful working environment. While ""Office Space"" and ""Waiting"" do share similar plots, first time director Rob McKittrick seems to have more of a flare for slacker comedy than Mike Judge.This movie can get a tad immature at times, but those who love movies like ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" and ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" will absolutely love this picture.",4,"""Waiting"" is a great black comedy on hospitality that is so painfully funny.",1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,2238,"['people', 'Shenanigan', 'restaurant', 'are', 'old', 'mix', 'characters', 'never', 'making', 'jobs', 'boring', 'amount', 'shenanigans', 'own', 'odd', 'mix', 'characters', 'waiting', 'such', 'fun', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'focused', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Monty', 'Dean', 'Serena', 'background', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'personalities', 'dilemmas', 'adding', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'development', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'developed', 'can', 'still', 'understand', 'sympathies', 'problems', 'characters', 'are', 'clich', 'd', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'placed', 'interact', 'perfectly', 'realism', 'them.The', 'major', 'point', 'Waiting', 'black', 'humor', ""n't"", 'work', 'off', 'big', 'set', 'pieces', 'outlandish', 'situations', 'make', 'humor', 'organically', 'characters', 'dialog', 'lot', 'dialog', 'perverse', 'never', 'place', 'Waiting', 'perfectly', 'reflect', 'relationship', 'customer', 'waiter', 'well', 'did', 'Rob', 'McKittrick', 'unashamedly', 'interaction', 'smart-ass', 'customer', 'who', 'always', 'regulars', 'what', 'could', 'go', 'walls', 'when', 'customers', 'push', 'hard.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'eccentric', 'performance', 'forward', 'had', 'been', 'stuck', 'eccentric', 'ego', 'lot', 'movies', 'perfectly', 'great', 'job', 'again', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'had', 'finally', 'lost', 'ditsy', 'persona', 'broader', 'range', 'acting', 'bringing', 'great', 'performance', 'Justin', 'Long', 'have', 'puppy', 'dog', 'face', 'lot', 'time', 'really', 'forward', 'more', 'serious', 'moments', 'other', 'actors', 'employees', 'do', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'making', 'background', 'character', 'more', 'interesting.In', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'successful', 'cult', 'comedy', 'name', 'Office', 'Space', 'films', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'stressful', 'working', 'environment', 'Office', 'Space', 'Waiting', 'do', 'share', 'similar', 'plots', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Rob', 'McKittrick', 'have', 'more', 'flare', 'slacker', 'comedy', 'Mike', 'Judge.This', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'tad', 'immature', 'times', 'who', 'love', 'movies', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Go', 'White', 'Castle', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'picture']",N/A
959702,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000CPH9PM,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[0, 1]","Waiting is basically Clerks but with a restuarant and gross out humor. Still though, it's a really entertaining movie due to the cast. I thought Ryan Reynolds made a mistake going back to gross out comedies after showing he can do more. Critics who hated this movie would say he made a mistake doing this movie but to me I'm not sure why they didn't like this movie. If they loved Clerks, then why not Waiting ? We get an understanding that...you shouldn't mess with the people that wait on you because they're friends with the cooks. Who will spit in your food among other things. Hell you might not even wanna go to another restuarant after seeing this movie.Still though it's hilarious with a talented cast. Anna Farris is even better here than she was in any Scary Movie film. Usually she doesn't mind just poking fun at herself for a few laughs but here she shows she can do more than that. She outacts Reynolds in the scene where they're arguing over his skills with woman since she's an ex of his. Still though, although I usually disagree with Richard Roeper, Reynolds is pretty much the new Chevy Chase. He has the same facial expressions and same personallity. Which would probably make him perfect for the Fletch sequel or remake that has been talked about for years now. I never really thought that Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers, Dodge Ball) had any talent either until I saw him in this. He's good as Reynolds' bestfriend who doesn't want to work as a waiter his entire life. Luis Guzm&aacute;n (Traffic, The Salton Sea) as a weird cook and Chi McBride (Boston Public) as a cook full of wisdom that nobody wants to hear are also good as always.

959710,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B000CPH9PM,Junglies,"[1, 3]","It has to be said. This kind of comedy is not my forte but many of my acquaintences advised me to watch this movie and I duly followed their advice. Having discovered the wide and varied universe of food places in the American North East it is quite amazing the similarities one finds when watching this cautionary tale. Having worked in retail management for some years now I also had a vested interest in watching this movie.This is very much a comic docudrama. From the outset when the stage is being set and the characters introduced, some stereotypes are sketched in and these will be instantly recognisable to anyone who has worked in the food or retail sectors. And that is just the employees. What is established is a scene in a life sized soap opera with drama aplenty and where every detail is magnified out of all proportion. We follow the trials and tribulations through a section of a working week while the melodrama plays itself out. The most interesting aspect of it all is the treatment meted out to the unpleasant customer who has no respect for the efforts of the staff and who takes saditic delight in their total humiliation. And, as we all know, the customer, it is said anyway, is always right. But, as it is written, ye shall reap as ye shall sow, which leads to consequences.Waiting paints the work in a restaurant as being self-centered and introvert. The manager feels macho and powerful yielding his capacity to hire and fire over the employees heads whilst they all realise that the restaurant is small fry (no pun intended). His feeble attempts to engender some motivation through the shift huddle make the whole ide rather stupid and pointless although that little scene is being played out in numerous stores at least once a day across the wide sweep of the land. People and their own ideas of their self importance are the concern of waiting and yet there is a camaraderie which transcends feelings towards each other. There is a team spirit which carries them through any crisis. Of course, the composition of the team changes relatively frequently and new members are initiated into the team or are rejected.One of the things I most liked about this movie is the way I could identify with many of the characters within whether employee or customer and some of the inanities which are a central part of the retail life.For those readers who have only experienced such life long skills that they may have learned early in their careers, this is a movie to look back on with some nostalgia.

959713,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000CPH9PM,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 3]","""Waiting"" kept me waiting for a long time.  I kept waiting for it to become something more than just another second-rate comedy attempting to play to young adults.  It has a decent cast, with a few notable exceptions.  Justin Long, Anna Faris, Alanna Ubach and John Francis Daley are all fun to watch here.  Daley nearly steals the show with his ""new guy"" persona, Mitch.  Long is torn between becoming something special or just sticking it out at the local eatery.  Faris redeems herself from the ""Scary Movie"" franchise and Ubach, though she has very little to work with here, does the best she can with her tired, overworked and slightly psychotic character.Those were the good characters.  The bad ones are what make this flick almost unbearable at times.  Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds.  Give his character Monty a gun and partner him with Wesley Snipes and you have his character from ""Blade Trinity.""  Slap a slab of pizza in his hand and you have the character he played in that ""Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Parlor.""  Drop him into your local university and sidle him up to Kumar and you have ""Van Wilder.""  Reynolds was pretty funny the first couple of times I've seen him pull off this gig, but he's really starting to wear thin.  I haven't seen him in ""Amityville Horror"" yet, so hopefully he does a better job in that.  Another annoying character was that of David Koechner's Dan, who is, much like Reynolds, basically the same character that he plays in all of his other films.  The worst in the bunch was the completely unfunny Andy Milonakis.  Whoever thought that this dude is funny should be dragged into the street and shot.  Milonakis is absolutely not funny, and his little video at the end is hideous.So why give this flick three stars?  For the simple fact that Long and Daley manage to hold their respective stories together long enough to make this film remotely interesting.  You can actually relate to Long's character who is desperate to break free of his monotonous life, and you can feel for Daley as he tries to make it through ""first day jitters.""In all, I wouldn't recommend this flick to folks who enjoy their humor with a little depth to it.  If you thought ""Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle"" was the funniest thing in the world, breathe through your nose long enough to rent this mildly funny flick.",3,A Smorgasbord Of Tales Crammed Into A Restaurant,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,2365,"['Waiting', 'kept', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'kept', 'waiting', 'become', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'second-rate', 'comedy', 'attempting', 'play', 'young', 'adults', 'decent', 'cast', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Alanna', 'Ubach', 'John', 'Francis', 'Daley', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'here', 'Daley', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'new', 'guy', 'persona', 'Mitch', 'Long', 'torn', 'becoming', 'something', 'special', 'just', 'sticking', 'out', 'local', 'eatery', 'Faris', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'Ubach', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'here', 'best', 'can', 'tired', 'overworked', 'slightly', 'psychotic', 'character.Those', 'were', 'good', 'characters', 'bad', 'ones', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'flick', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'times', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'playing', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Give', 'character', 'Monty', 'gun', 'partner', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'have', 'character', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'slab', 'pizza', 'hand', 'have', 'character', 'played', 'Two', 'Guys', 'Girl', 'Pizza', 'Parlor', 'Drop', 'local', 'university', 'sidle', 'up', 'Kumar', 'have', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'first', 'couple', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'pull', 'off', 'gig', 'really', 'starting', 'wear', 'thin', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'yet', 'so', 'hopefully', 'better', 'job', 'annoying', 'character', 'was', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Dan', 'who', 'much', 'Reynolds', 'basically', 'same', 'character', 'other', 'films', 'worst', 'bunch', 'was', 'completely', 'unfunny', 'Andy', 'Milonakis', 'Whoever', 'thought', 'dude', 'funny', 'should', 'be', 'dragged', 'street', 'shot', 'Milonakis', 'absolutely', 'not', 'funny', 'little', 'video', 'end', 'hideous.So', 'why', 'give', 'flick', 'three', 'stars', 'simple', 'fact', 'Long', 'Daley', 'manage', 'hold', 'respective', 'stories', 'together', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'can', 'actually', 'relate', 'Long', 'character', 'who', 'desperate', 'break', 'free', 'monotonous', 'life', 'can', 'feel', 'Daley', 'make', 'first', 'day', 'jitters', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'flick', 'folks', 'who', 'enjoy', 'humor', 'little', 'depth', 'thought', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Go', 'White', 'Castle', 'was', 'funniest', 'thing', 'world', 'breathe', 'nose', 'long', 'enough', 'rent', 'mildly', 'funny', 'flick']",N/A
959714,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000CPH9PM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 2]","I knew what I was getting into when I sat down to an evening with ""Waiting."" I knew it was from the school of moronic, gross out humor. But when a friend passed the DVD on to me, I respectfully emptied my head and put it on. I expected some sophomore pranks, some groaning one liners, and maybe a few chuckles--but I was completely blindsided by a mind-numbing boredom that set it from this film.The setup was cute enough and the cast seemed appealing. Shenanigans is a great name for the establishment and there is certainly plenty of humorous material in the corporate world of restaurant flair (already impeccably handled in Office Space). But any hopes of a sly satire or a witty commentary on that world were soon abandoned. In fact, go watch Office Space again! The few brief moments in that film set in a similarly themed restaurant are funnier and have more to say than all 90 minutes of ""Waiting.""So, as we are introduced to everyone through the eyes of a new employee played by a likable John Francis Daley I still had some hope. But then we are introduced to The Game, a sophomoric exercise where employees flash their privates. It was enough to make me smile, ONCE. But they beat this not-so-stellar joke to death almost immediately and proceeded to batter and kick and mutilate its unfunny carcass for the rest of the movie. I'm not kidding, eliminate this one clunker of an ongoing joke and ""Waiting"" probably would have been about 22 minutes! Now that would have been a real treat!There is one scene near the end of the film when Daley blows up that I enjoyed. But one scene and a promising but unfufilled setup do not make up for the other 89 minutes I was waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh. Let me make this perfectly clear: In no way was I offended by the content of this film, I'm only bothered by its incapacity to engage me in any humorous way.

We all have, and ""Waiting"" is just the film to represent our frustration with our everyday lives in boring and dead end jobs. The movie has more than enough laughs to offer, as well as a few crude moments, and a great cast, which features the likes of Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder), Anna Farris (Scary Movie) and Justin Long (Dodgeball), to support the overall story line.""Waiting"" is centered around a group of employees who work at a Shenanigans restaurant. You have Monty, the ladies man with a twisted sense of humor, Dean an employee who's not sure of what he should do with his life, Serena a sexy waitress with an attitude, Naomi, a schitzophrantic waitress, Calvin the whipped lover, and Mitch the new guy, as well as a slew of other well liked comedic personalities such as Dane Cook and Andy Milanokis. Mitch is the newest employee at Shenanigans, and it's Monty's job to get his accustomed to the workplace. Mitch quickly learns what Shennagins is really about; girls, the (...)game, and doing rather absurd things to the customers food. The main character of the movie Dean, is feeling trapped by working at Shennanigans and feels he should be doing more with his life after learning from his Mom that his highschool classmate Chet has just graduated college with his bachelor's degree (and they were in all the same classes in high school). To make matters more difficult Dean has been offered a job as assistant manager and has to give his answer by the end of his shift. The movie follows the cast in a typical day of work, and hilarity ensues. The entire cast is absolutely hilarious, whether they're dropping a customers food on the floor and playing the five second rule, or having sex in a bathroom stall. There's really nothing this movie doesn't touch as far as disgusting humor goes, so if you're easily offended, this is not the movie for you. However if you're a fan of obscene comedies with great jokes and a likeable cast, then ""Waiting"" will probably be one of the funniest movies you see this year.I definitely recommend the movie to anyone who likes to laugh at a movie. Once again you can't take this one too seriously. If you do, you're missing the real fun and beauty behind it. So check this movie out, it's definitely worth the $6.50, or however much movie tickets cost these days, and you'll be more than entertained by the laughs.

But who needs a plot when you have penis jokes?A shameless excuse to stir together a group of stagnant character archetypes and low-brow one-liners (mostly involving sex), ""Waiting ..."" has a pretty specific target audience. I guess I wasn't in it. And I'm not sure that those who ARE in that target audience (13 year old males) would (or should) be allowed to watch a film that involves frontal nudity, underaged sex, and the consumption of pubic hairs. If, somehow, a prepubescent male gets his hands on this flick, I can guarantee him a good time.God help him, though, if he identifies with any of the characters, none of which seem like anything resembling normal. There's the too-cool-for-school Monty (Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds), the stoner bus boys (Milonakis and Kasch, who also perform a moderately amusing music video over the credits), the controlling manager who has made his failure a badge of honor (David Koechner playing David Koechner), and, of course, a cadre of vengeful and horny cooks (Luis Guzman and Dane Cook actually do a pretty good job of embracing their poorly drawn places in the film). Chi McBride (I, Robot) is the pontificating dishwasher, Anna Faris (Scary Movie) is the slightly slutty waitress, and Justin Long (Dodgeball) gives us the closest thing to a story arc with his Dean, a 22 year old who is already suffering a mid-life crisis, God help his whiny soul.It's really just another day in the life of a ""family"" restaurant. This one is named, appropriately, Shenaniganz, and it features, as Moe of the Simpsons would say, ""a whole lotta crazy crap on the walls"" (including a clever Rube Goldberg-esque contraption designed to pour beer into an empty mug; it's demonstrated after the final credits roll). In-between dealing with rude customers and training a newbie (a mostly mute John Francis Daley), the male members of the staff entertain themselves with a game that involves flashing their genitals at other waiters and winning, in the process, the right to kick the others in the butt. No, I'm not kidding.This is the best that first-time director/writer Rob McKittrick could come up with, and although his love of this debut film is obvious on every juvenile frame, it doesn't translate into much more than people being crude and crazy. In a long personal note during the credits, McKittrick thanks one friend for reading over the script and ""showing me where the conversations were contrived."" Ha ha. The conversations.

Anna Faris I feel is just a supporter even though shes pictured on the cover of the movie.

Everyone has a tale to tell.  You have the hopeful Dean (played by Justin Long), who is being harassed by his manager Dan (David Koechner) to accept a promotion despite weighing his options to continue a career in food service; all while maintaining his relationship with Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday).  There's also the sarcastic Monty (Ryan Reynolds), who does what he can to maintain his edge as the ""cool, cocky"" worker at the restaurant.  The wise dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride) does what he can to offer advice that would be counter-intuitive to the antics that Raddimus (Luis Guzman) and Floyd (Dane Cook) cook up in an effort to sabotage the restaurant's customers (and their food.)  Serena (Anna Faris) does what she can to hold down the fort while the alcoholic Naomi (Alanna Ubach) and the neurotic Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict) have their issues become the problems of everyone else.  Will the gang get through their day unscathed?  Will Dean make the decision to stay as a manager or will he move on with life?I had to see the movie a few times to be a fan, but push comes to shove this wasn't that bad of a movie at all.

All the characters just mope around complaining about personal problems.One character (Justin Long from Dodgeball) is sick of working at the restaurant and wants a successful life and the two main characters (Ryan Reynolds and Anna Farris) just argue about their past relationship in how Ryan's character, Monty, just wants to sleep with high school girls. This all gets really repetitive and uninteresting.But don't worry!!! This movie has its hilarious moments. On the lighter side of the humor is Ryan Reynolds. This guy has a natural comedic talent. He has quick, sarcastic one-liners that put a smile to your face. Ryan is really funny in small doses. Dane Cook is the highlight of the movie has one of the chefs in the kitchen.

Never, ever, mess with the people who prepare your food.  Ryan Reynolds plays Monty; a smart mouthed waiter at a chain restaurantwhp provides many of the best quips you'll hear in the film. Along for the ride is his best bud Dean (Justin Long, the Mac from the Apple and PC commercials, and soon to be seen in Live Free or Die Hard), former flame Serena (Anna Faris); and plenty of other loose cannons and jokers who all hate their job equally.  There's not much of a story, and what there is of it is nothing we haven't seen before, but Waiting's unabashed ludeness and hilarious gags (flashing each other their genitals may sound like it'll get tiring, but it only gets funnier) make it worth seeing for alone.  The cast, including Luis Guzman, Chi McBride, David Koechner, and the frequently annoying Andy Milonakis; are very funny, and Reynolds in particular is hysterical.

959738,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000CPH9PM,Nicholas Carroll,"[5, 12]","This is one of those pointless, day-in-the-life-of-a type of movies, and while it does offer some big laughs, it lacks a heart. Raunchy comedy was done much better in ""The Wedding Crashers"" and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". But analyzing this film on its own merits...Ryan Reynolds has the perfect face of a snarky jock-type frat boy who's just enjoying life as he works as the top dog waiter at Shenanigans (a not-too-subtle jab at the actual Bennigans). His facial reactions, dead-on Forrest Gump impersonation, and comments make this film better than it is. I haven't seen Van Wilder except for the trailer, so it looks like he's playing a similar role. He better watch out for his career choices, because he could easily get stuck playing the same ""big man on campus frat boy jock"" for the remainder of his career.The rest of the actors are cardboard cut-outs. There's a waitress with anger management problems; a flirty underage waitress who loves to come on to older men and get them into trouble; comedian Dane Cook plays...get this: a cook! The restaurant manager is a balding middle age man with no friends to speak of so he tries to get socially involved with his much younger employees. I actually thought that was true to life, as several managers of restaurants I've worked in certainly fit that stereotype.My favorite scenes were ones with the two white, dishwashing bus boys who act more like rapping b-boys. One of them, T-dog, even has his hair in cornrows. They are often found rapping and throwing insults like a rap star. The rap played during the end credits is hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing. The lyrics are downright funny, even if a bit misogynistic, but who cares?What I love most about this film are the jabs at various customer types who are extremely picky about the way their food is prepared (if a person is that anal retentive about their food, they should never eat in a restaurant), those who don't leave big tips, those who overtip, and the various ways waiters and waitresses flirt with customers in order to garner a large tip. While I'm certain that servers at restaurant deal with difficult customers through the passive-aggressive practice of messing with one's food, I thought those scenes went too far for my taste. If anything, it serves as a warning to difficult customers, but I certainly hope that no waiter/cook would ever do that to a polite/considerate customer. It's the most unethical thing one can do to deal with a difficult customer.What killed the film for me was the stupid game they play. While I'm sure it happens in any industry with immature men who think such things are funny, I just thought they wrapped the whole film around it, taking away from the things they could've and should've shown. However, to the filmmakers credit, the end scene is brilliant and some of the funniest I've seen. Still...I subtract a star for making that game the running gag throughout the film.This is okay to see once, but not to own or ever see again. For raunchy good fun, I'll stick with ""The Wedding Crashers"" and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""...two movies that deliver even bigger and better laughs and a more interesting storyline to match.",3,Things you don't want to know about your waiter!,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,3185,"['one', 'pointless', 'day-in-the-life-of-a', 'type', 'movies', 'offer', 'big', 'laughs', 'heart', 'Raunchy', 'comedy', 'was', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'analyzing', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'perfect', 'face', 'snarky', 'jock-type', 'frat', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'enjoying', 'life', 'top', 'dog', 'waiter', 'Shenanigans', 'not-too-subtle', 'jab', 'actual', 'Bennigans', 'facial', 'reactions', 'dead-on', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'impersonation', 'comments', 'make', 'film', 'better', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'trailer', 'playing', 'similar', 'role', 'better', 'watch', 'career', 'choices', 'could', 'easily', 'get', 'stuck', 'playing', 'same', 'big', 'man', 'campus', 'frat', 'boy', 'jock', 'remainder', 'career.The', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'waitress', 'anger', 'management', 'problems', 'flirty', 'underage', 'waitress', 'who', 'come', 'older', 'men', 'get', 'trouble', 'comedian', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'get', 'cook', 'restaurant', 'manager', 'balding', 'middle', 'age', 'man', 'friends', 'speak', 'so', 'get', 'socially', 'involved', 'much', 'younger', 'employees', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'true', 'life', 'several', 'managers', 'restaurants', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'certainly', 'fit', 'stereotype.My', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'were', 'ones', 'two', 'white', 'dishwashing', 'bus', 'boys', 'who', 'act', 'more', 'rapping', 'b-boys', 'One', 'T-dog', 'even', 'hair', 'cornrows', 'are', 'often', 'found', 'rapping', 'throwing', 'insults', 'rap', 'star', 'rap', 'played', 'end', 'hilarious', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'lyrics', 'are', 'downright', 'funny', 'even', 'bit', 'misogynistic', 'who', 'What', 'love', 'most', 'film', 'are', 'jabs', 'various', 'customer', 'types', 'who', 'are', 'extremely', 'picky', 'way', 'food', 'prepared', 'person', 'anal', 'retentive', 'food', 'should', 'never', 'eat', 'restaurant', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'big', 'tips', 'who', 'overtip', 'various', 'ways', 'waiters', 'waitresses', 'flirt', 'customers', 'order', 'garner', 'large', 'tip', ""'m"", 'certain', 'servers', 'restaurant', 'deal', 'difficult', 'customers', 'passive-aggressive', 'practice', 'messing', 'one', 'food', 'thought', 'scenes', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'taste', 'anything', 'warning', 'difficult', 'customers', 'certainly', 'hope', 'waiter/cook', 'would', 'ever', 'do', 'polite/considerate', 'customer', 'most', 'unethical', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'deal', 'difficult', 'killed', 'film', 'was', 'stupid', 'game', 'play', ""'m"", 'sure', 'industry', 'immature', 'men', 'who', 'think', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'funny', 'just', 'thought', 'wrapped', 'whole', 'film', 'taking', 'away', 'things', 'could', ""'ve"", 'should', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'However', 'filmmakers', 'credit', 'end', 'scene', 'brilliant', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Still', 'subtract', 'star', 'making', 'game', 'running', 'gag', 'film.This', 'okay', 'see', 'once', 'not', 'own', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'raunchy', 'good', 'fun', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'two', 'movies', 'deliver', 'even', 'bigger', 'better', 'laughs', 'more', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'match']",N/A

Of course, but there are obnoxious people in real life, and it feels good to laugh at them once in a while and maybe see a little of yourself in an obnoxious character. Could it be more clever? Of course, but in a movie like this, too much cleverness would be too clever by half. For those who would want or expect more cleverness, have you never acted ridiculously silly and thoroughly enjoyed yourself? How would it be if, after your silly jag, some nitwit says, in all seriousness, that you could have been more clever? Neither is this film ""formulaic."" The story is structured around employees at a restaurant, so yes, it dishes out jokes you would expect. But then, a concert pianist is formulaic for performing the standard repertoire.Like any good ""teen angst"" movie, this one has something to say to ""grown-ups"" and parents as well. It's just that everything is exaggerated to the point of absurdity, which makes it ""safer,"" perhaps, for us to think about the underlying messages.

959758,A5UMUVEV1RUS9,B000CPH9PM,SuperJenn,"[1, 2]","Last night, a friend brought over Waiting which I'd been wanting to see since I'd first seen the previews. I can't stand to go to the movie theater anymore to shell out a lot of money only to have some jackass blab on their phone the entire time. I figured I'd run out and rent it this weekend, but at last my wait for Waiting was finally over. And it was worth it! I'm a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds, plus Waiting had been described to me as Office Space for the restaurant industry. Despite never working in food services, I had an absolute blast watching this movie. It was such fun and proves that in any work environment, you always have some games you play to make your job less awful. I'd never work in food services, and I'm not saying that to put down anyone that does...I have a great respect for those who do because I'm far too clumsy not to drop plates of food everywhere and far too forgetful to remember orders. I'd probably be most like Naomi's charcter if I did work in that industry. My hat is off to the hard-working people in this industry.Waiting takes us through a day in the life of the employees who work at a restaurant called Shenanigan's (which looks like a Bennigan's) as Ryan Reynolds' charcter trains the new guy, Mitch. Since I don't work in this industry, I found it interesting to see things from the perspective of all the employees in the restaurant. The cooks who just wanted to go home. The poor waitress who had the mean, nasty lady. It makes me quite happy that I always treat the people who wait on me with respect.So, if you enjoyed Office Space, or you have worked in a restaurant, I suspect you will like this movie most of all. Anyone with a sense of humor will surely enjoy this as much as I did. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 though just because one of the cooks (the really ugly one...I forget his name) has this stunningly beautiful girlfriend in the movie and it seems very unlikely a girl that looks like that would even give a guy that looks like that the time of day. However, my friend who brought over the movie used to work in food services years ago and he said it's not all that uncommon to see something like that. Whatever.

Anyway, the movie's appeal about the day at Shenanigans (which reminds you of a chain restaurant like T.G.I. Fridays etc.) and an eclectic group of characters.I assume this movie was rated R or should have been for language, sexual references, etc. This is an adult movie or for those who can stomach penis jokes etc. But this 2 disc set offers plenty of extras which shows the development of the film process. This film took years to make mostly of raising money.This two disc set spares no expense in showing out-takes, deleted scenes, and the making of the film. Maybe it's too much for a 90 minute movie that might be a cult hit. I don't know if it's reached cult status like Office Space yet but it might be there eventually.I am giving the 2 disc set three stars because mine wasn't rated R on the box and that's important to us out there. It's still a good bargain and they should make more movies like this about working class people who have dreams and aspirations of higher purpose.The cast was excellent with Ryan Reynolds leading the pack. Anna Faris is fine. Alannah Ubach is my favorite as high strung Naomi. Luis Guzman is always hysterical. William Koetchner should have his own sitcom by now and others.The film was done by a first-time film director who worked in a restaurant.

959763,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B000CPH9PM,Thomas Glebe,"[3, 5]","There was ""Clerks,"" and ""Office Space,"" and now this.  While there have been many insider looks into the ironic, satiric, just plain funny twilight zone that is American lower class work/job experiences, few come close to the above mentioned films.  While I could relate much more to the clerical-oriented ""Office Space,"" I'd bet this film does for the restaurant industry (and ""service sector workers"") what ""Office Space"" did so well for me.  But I could relate to this almost as much.  It's all just done so surprisingly well.While ""Office Space"" dealt with distinct and very different ""work-place"" clerical/office environments and characters usually found in both, this movie deals with the food-service industry, especially that within the more seemingly affluent types of establishment culture.  Still, despite the expensive looking and seeming quality dining experiences this film's dining business dishes up, like former treatments of this general theme, we eventually learn that perhaps one should eat out less frequently than they do, if ever.  And if THEY (those who prepare and deliver your food) dish it up at such rather upscale places like ""Shenanigans"" in the movie, you may want to see this great film before treating anyone in such a place with anything less than respect and a good tip.  From now on!There are so many players here that it would be nearly impossible to straighten them all out and comment individually without writing a few thousand words.  Throughout however, it really doesn't matter.  Virtually every character and the actor or actress playing them, do a first rate job.And the script and direction doesn't hurt.  While one or two characters stand out, and at times present either comic relief or that of a more serious message about the human corporate working environment and the ever increasing need to always try to get ahead, the entire acting staff give first rate performances.  From the smallest part to the majors.The script is tight, very tight.  There are so many lines, so many situations involving so many different types of people, but while some of the humor may be childish and cheap, everything and everyone is believable in a way and it all works as a whole. Especially for anyone who has ever worked in any office or other consumer serving field.  This points to many rewrites, but that's a good thing here, a great thing.  As well as the superb direction, fast, furious, and quick-paced, and completely suiting the general ideas here, without drifting too heavily into perhaps more downer, if realistic modes.Regardless of this film's seeing almost anything corporate, low-paying job-wise as existing in some bizzaro world (which it actually does), despite some excessive misdirections and plot diversions, anyone who's ever held such a job in any way close to what this film constantly and cleverly shows, will find a lot of value here.  Anyone actually who has ever held any kind of struggling, office or ""service"" job, should love this.While the film rarely takes a breath from the continual bombardment of jokes, hit and miss, but mostly hit, throughout, and has only as a side story a more slightly more serious take on one of the employees and his own personal existential angst, even this aspect fits in beautifully, and with the film's fast onslaught of funny tidbits everywhere, even more serious turns only compliment the loads of humor to be found here.There are plots and subplots all along the way, and all interesting, some of them seeming to even demand whole films of their own.  For anyone who has seen this and liked ""Office Space"" and/or ""Clerks,"" and liked this, or loved it as I did and do, this is a most definite buy, as it moves so fast with so many subtle lines and situations and interractions, that it demands repeated viewings to collectors with the money to add truly a special and totally unique modern workplace ""screwball"" comedy to their permanent DVD collection of totally cool flicks.I only started watching this film without much expectations, on cable on demand, simply from the brief description of what the movie was supposedly about.  Amazingly, I watched it through without hardly a break or pause, and never ever reached for the fast forward button.  This is a really funny and at the same time, fairly deep comment on ""working-class"" America in a dining establishment, and while a lot of it seems a bit stretched as to believability, most of it does not, and for me, I'll forever think twice before ever eating out at a seemingly upscale such place.  Let alone one of the fast food outlets.A real instant working-class comedy classic, and great comedy in general.",5,One of the most hilarious and right-on comedies in years!,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,4664,"['was', 'Clerks', 'Office', 'Space', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'insider', 'ironic', 'satiric', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'twilight', 'zone', 'American', 'lower', 'class', 'work/job', 'experiences', 'few', 'come', 'close', 'above', 'mentioned', 'films', 'could', 'relate', 'much', 'more', 'clerical-oriented', 'Office', 'Space', ""'d"", 'bet', 'film', 'restaurant', 'industry', 'service', 'sector', 'workers', 'what', 'Office', 'Space', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'could', 'relate', 'almost', 'much', 'just', 'done', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'Office', 'Space', 'dealt', 'distinct', 'very', 'different', 'work-place', 'clerical/office', 'environments', 'characters', 'usually', 'found', 'movie', 'food-service', 'industry', 'especially', 'more', 'seemingly', 'affluent', 'types', 'establishment', 'culture', 'Still', 'expensive', 'looking', 'seeming', 'quality', 'dining', 'experiences', 'film', 'dining', 'business', 'up', 'former', 'treatments', 'general', 'theme', 'eventually', 'learn', 'perhaps', 'one', 'should', 'eat', 'out', 'less', 'frequently', 'do', 'ever', 'THEY', 'who', 'prepare', 'deliver', 'food', 'dish', 'up', 'such', 'rather', 'upscale', 'places', 'Shenanigans', 'movie', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'treating', 'anyone', 'place', 'anything', 'less', 'respect', 'good', 'tip', 'now', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'players', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'straighten', 'comment', 'individually', 'writing', 'few', 'thousand', 'words', 'however', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Virtually', 'character', 'actor', 'actress', 'playing', 'do', 'first', 'rate', 'job.And', 'script', 'direction', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'times', 'present', 'either', 'comic', 'relief', 'more', 'serious', 'message', 'human', 'corporate', 'working', 'environment', 'ever', 'increasing', 'need', 'always', 'try', 'get', 'ahead', 'entire', 'acting', 'staff', 'give', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'smallest', 'part', 'majors.The', 'script', 'tight', 'very', 'tight', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'lines', 'so', 'many', 'situations', 'involving', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'people', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'childish', 'cheap', 'everything', 'everyone', 'believable', 'way', 'whole', 'Especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'worked', 'office', 'other', 'consumer', 'serving', 'field', 'points', 'many', 'rewrites', 'good', 'thing', 'here', 'great', 'thing', 'As', 'well', 'superb', 'direction', 'fast', 'furious', 'quick-paced', 'completely', 'suiting', 'general', 'ideas', 'here', 'drifting', 'too', 'heavily', 'perhaps', 'more', 'downer', 'realistic', 'modes.Regardless', 'film', 'seeing', 'almost', 'anything', 'corporate', 'low-paying', 'job-wise', 'existing', 'bizzaro', 'world', 'actually', 'excessive', 'misdirections', 'plot', 'diversions', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'held', 'job', 'way', 'close', 'what', 'film', 'constantly', 'cleverly', 'shows', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'value', 'here', 'Anyone', 'actually', 'who', 'ever', 'held', 'kind', 'struggling', 'office', 'service', 'job', 'should', 'love', 'film', 'rarely', 'breath', 'continual', 'bombardment', 'jokes', 'hit', 'miss', 'mostly', 'hit', 'only', 'side', 'story', 'more', 'slightly', 'more', 'serious', 'take', 'one', 'employees', 'own', 'personal', 'existential', 'angst', 'even', 'aspect', 'beautifully', 'film', 'fast', 'onslaught', 'funny', 'tidbits', 'everywhere', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'only', 'compliment', 'loads', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'here.There', 'are', 'plots', 'subplots', 'way', 'interesting', 'seeming', 'even', 'demand', 'whole', 'films', 'own', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'liked', 'Office', 'Space', 'and/or', 'Clerks', 'liked', 'loved', 'did', 'do', 'most', 'definite', 'buy', 'so', 'fast', 'so', 'many', 'subtle', 'lines', 'situations', 'interractions', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'collectors', 'money', 'add', 'truly', 'special', 'totally', 'unique', 'modern', 'workplace', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'permanent', 'DVD', 'collection', 'totally', 'cool', 'flicks.I', 'only', 'started', 'watching', 'film', 'much', 'expectations', 'cable', 'demand', 'simply', 'brief', 'description', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'supposedly', 'about', 'Amazingly', 'watched', 'hardly', 'break', 'pause', 'never', 'ever', 'reached', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'really', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'fairly', 'deep', 'comment', 'working-class', 'America', 'dining', 'establishment', 'lot', 'bit', 'stretched', 'believability', 'most', 'not', ""'ll"", 'forever', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'ever', 'eating', 'out', 'seemingly', 'upscale', 'such', 'place', 'Let', 'alone', 'one', 'fast', 'food', 'outlets.A', 'real', 'instant', 'working-class', 'comedy', 'classic', 'great', 'comedy', 'general']",N/A

It's just annoying beyond belief. I'll admit the only reason I actually decided to watch this movie and rated it 2 stars was because Dane Cook was in. I figured, being a huge fan of his comedy, that this one might actually make me laugh..WRONG. He barely had any parts, and those were the only parts that were funny. But they were few and far between. I also want to note how cheesy Ryan Renyolds charcatar was..I cant quite pin if it was his acting or what, but it was painful to watch.

The depiction of the various characters at the dinning room and kitchen is very realistic. It deals with bad/bitchy/cheap/flirtatious customers, retaliations from the waiting and kitchen staff, the feud and sexual encounters within the staff members all served up a very dirty, shocking, and hilarious experience. Overall, I think the whole sexual activities that take place in behind the scene is a bit exaggerated.
