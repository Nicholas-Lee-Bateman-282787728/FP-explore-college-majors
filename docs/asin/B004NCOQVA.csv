1420957,A339V5QLYDMVL7,B004NCOQVA,Kay Emm Gee,"[26, 27]","This DVD title, ""Jimi Hendrix - Band of Gypsys (Live at the Fillmore East) (1970)"" was originally released in 1999.  In 2011 Sony Legacy re-released it with improved sound.  Even if you already own the original 1999 version you owe it to yourself to buy this new version, no matter what type of speaker system you have.The original DVD release featured a very flat and unexciting audio mix on the concert footage.  The audio (of the 1999 version) sounds nothing like the, ""Band of Gypsys"" album.  This poor sound takes away from the enjoyment of watching the concert.This new release (2011) sounds fantastic, in fact it sounds exactly like the ""Band of Gypsys"" CD!  This greatly enhances the enjoyment of watching the concert.This new DVD also features a 5.1 mix for added depth.",4,The Sony Legacy (2011) edition is much better than the previous DVD release.,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,779,"['DVD', 'title', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Band', 'Gypsys', 'Live', 'Fillmore', 'East', '1970', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '1999', '2011', 'Sony', 'Legacy', 're-released', 'improved', 'sound', 'Even', 'already', 'own', 'original', '1999', 'version', 'owe', 'buy', 'new', 'version', 'matter', 'what', 'type', 'speaker', 'system', 'have.The', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'featured', 'very', 'flat', 'unexciting', 'audio', 'mix', 'concert', 'footage', 'audio', '1999', 'version', 'nothing', 'Band', 'Gypsys', 'album', 'poor', 'sound', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'concert.This', 'new', 'release', '2011', 'fantastic', 'fact', 'exactly', 'Band', 'Gypsys', 'CD', 'greatly', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'concert.This', 'new', 'DVD', 'also', '5.1', 'mix', 'added', 'depth']",Band of Gypsys: Live at the Fillmore East

Jimi is rocking shiz!  Just amazing!  5 stars all the way!  My only problem is that I never cared for Buddy Miles' singing (and he wasn't nearly the drummer Mitch Mitchell was).  Dude, it's Jimi's show...just play your drums and sing some backup.  He is okay I suppose, but Jimi is the superstar.The documentary let us know that Jimi Hendrix was black!  Really?  I had no idea!  I am somewhat joking but that does seem to be the gist of the documentary moreso than the breakup with Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, the rapport amongst the new band with Buddy and Billy and how it was leading up to and directly after the 2 nights at the Fillmore East, their subsequent dissolving and then Mitch back with Jimi and Billy., etc.  I get that the fact that Jimi was getting more bluesy and had 2 black men in the group does indeed need to be discussed but it was really overkill.  Jimi seemed more about all people rather than focusing on an us and them attitude.  Please tell me about this show and what they were doing.  They talked about Buddy getting kicked out of the band for like 2 minutes at the very end.  His version and then some other folks version.  That would have been interesting if we could have gotten more insight into that situation.  What was the audience like that night?  How did Jimi feel about the show?  We just get a bunch of philosophical mumbo jumbo with opinions from a lot of people that didn't even know him and it was really boring and repetitive. 1 star is generous for the documentary.So, 5 stars and 1 star...I will give it 3 stars overall.  I will never watch the documentary again.  I will certainly be checking out the concert again.",3,"Concert 5 stars, Documentary 1 star",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,1802,"['Well', 'concert', 'great', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'sound', 'excellent', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'good', 'enough', 'Jimi', 'rocking', 'shiz', 'Just', 'amazing', '5', 'stars', 'way', 'only', 'problem', 'never', 'cared', 'Buddy', 'Miles', 'singing', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'drummer', 'Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'Dude', 'Jimi', 'show', 'just', 'play', 'drums', 'sing', 'backup', 'okay', 'suppose', 'Jimi', 'superstar.The', 'documentary', 'let', 'know', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'was', 'black', 'Really', 'had', 'idea', 'am', 'somewhat', 'joking', 'seem', 'be', 'gist', 'documentary', 'moreso', 'breakup', 'Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'Noel', 'Redding', 'rapport', 'new', 'band', 'Buddy', 'Billy', 'how', 'was', 'leading', 'up', 'directly', '2', 'nights', 'Fillmore', 'East', 'subsequent', 'dissolving', 'then', 'Mitch', 'back', 'Jimi', 'Billy.', 'etc', 'get', 'fact', 'Jimi', 'was', 'getting', 'more', 'bluesy', 'had', '2', 'black', 'men', 'group', 'indeed', 'need', 'be', 'discussed', 'was', 'really', 'overkill', 'Jimi', 'seemed', 'more', 'people', 'rather', 'focusing', 'attitude', 'Please', 'tell', 'show', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'talked', 'Buddy', 'getting', 'kicked', 'band', '2', 'minutes', 'very', 'end', 'version', 'then', 'other', 'folks', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'insight', 'situation', 'What', 'was', 'audience', 'night', 'How', 'did', 'Jimi', 'feel', 'show', 'just', 'get', 'bunch', 'philosophical', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'opinions', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'really', 'boring', 'repetitive', '1', 'star', 'generous', 'documentary.So', '5', 'stars', '1', 'star', 'will', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'overall', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'documentary', 'again', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'checking', 'concert', 'again']",Band of Gypsys: Live at the Fillmore East
