I just knew that I had purchased a wide screen version, but received a full screen version. Plus I looked all over for the free music CD and never found it. I can't seem to get an option to contact the seller to discuss this with them, but I really would like the music CD. When the DVD first came up, it stated one price, but when I went to purchase it a different price would come up. I could not seem to get it for the price which was listed during the search. But I love Louis Gossett, Jr. and felt that I would love the movie with the CD, but only received half. I was hoping that once I played the movie, that the music might be part of the DVD, but it was not. There were not even any special features. I would really like to rest of the purchase.",3,Touching Movie,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,784,"['finally', 'received', 'movie', 'just', 'knew', 'had', 'purchased', 'wide', 'screen', 'version', 'received', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'looked', 'free', 'music', 'CD', 'never', 'found', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'option', 'contact', 'seller', 'discuss', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'music', 'CD', 'When', 'DVD', 'first', 'came', 'up', 'stated', 'one', 'price', 'when', 'went', 'purchase', 'different', 'price', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'could', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'price', 'was', 'listed', 'search', 'love', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'felt', 'would', 'love', 'movie', 'CD', 'only', 'received', 'half', 'was', 'hoping', 'once', 'played', 'movie', 'music', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'rest', 'purchase']",In His Father's Shoes VHS
