The release dvds over stars that have been there barely two years like Rey Mistero Jr and Brock Lesnar. Anther problem is they release dvds of stars but it lacks alot of matchs that made these people famous such as Shawn Micheals disappointing dvd (which lacks his Rocker, 92-93, and DX days) and Hulk Hogan's dvd looks cool but most of the matchs I have on anther tape and the ones I dont are terriable. The question is if WWE owns WCW and WWE, then why the hell do they put out such so-so dvds? They need to reconize the older stars like Shawn Micheals, Bret Hart, and Undertaker, stars people love and remember. Then make a 5 dvd (or more) set for each superstar with the first years, middle, and last years..i gurantee it'll sell.

Not only does it do a good bio on The Undertaker but it also features additional interviews and five of his all-time great matches.Only two real weak spots in my view. No mention of his feud with The Ultimate Warrior! I feel that was a big focal point of Mark Calloway's early career as The Undertaker and a key feud that helped him become noticed as UW was a big star second to only Hulk Hogan at that point in the early 90's.The other was the additional matches. While I did like them, I wished they would've shown one of his old matches from WCW. In particular, his match with then U.S. Champion Lex Luger at The Great American Bash '90.

Would I see more Taker's current status or would I see the Phenom? What I got was a perfect combination of old and new. We actually get to see highlights Undertaker starting out as &quot;Mean Mark&quot;. The video itself is outstanding with commentary by superstars such as Kurt Angel, Chris Jericho, Kane, Paul Heyman and good ol' Jim Ross. This DVD also delivers in extra's. Finally, a DVD that includes Michaels VS. Taker as well as the inferno match with Kane.while I do indeed miss Undertaker's darker days, it's intreasting to see how he has evolved. It's also intreasting to just see Undertaker sit down and talk about his life and all that he has done. I had seen so much WCW when I was little and it wasn't until about 1991 (I was still little) that I actually began watching WWF. When I came in Undertaker and Hogan were fueding and so this DVD brings back tons of memories for yours truly.

Dangerously and current WWE ref, Theodore 'Teddy' Long. It shows him outside the ring and arena. It has part of his HIAC match with Mankind, Fully Loaded match with Kurt Angle, WM14 and Inferno match with Kane. Undertaker is a true locker-room leader. Comments made by Kane, Brooklyn Brawler, Paul Heyman, J.R., Matt Hardy, Edge, Earl Hebner and Howard Finkle. Jericho admits that he should be more carefull about the things he says to some of the boys in the back. The bonus featres include several of the matches named above as well as the first HIAC with HBK and his WM X-7 match with HHH. The only thing that disapionted me about the WM X-7 match was the ref being out cold for most of the brawl. I was a little shocked to find that his match with Mankind at KOTR in HIAC was not part of the bonus features. It has his fueds with HBK,Kurt Angle and Kane. The tape also includes clips from his match with Hogan at S.Series 1991.

The Undertaker is a very private person, and there's not a lot known about his private life.  So, it's pretty cool that in this DVD you get to see a little of his house in Tampa, FL, as well as some of his motorcycles.  There's also a some segments that include Sara (his wife) and Undertaker even shows and talks about some of his awesome tatoos. For me, the best part of the whole thing is just seeing Undertaker talking about and being himself.  This DVD doesn't really get much into Undertaker's history; it more deals with his present-day ""Badass"" incarnation- tho there is some interesting footage of a young Undertaker wrestling as Mean Mark Callous in the beginning.

Ever since he came at Survivor series over a decade ago he has feuded with all the great superstars, and has beaten them. This is the story of how he started as the Phenom, and became the American Bada**.The extras include several matches from his career, and they are all watchable, allthough some you should only watch once in a while.Undertaker vs. Shawn Michales: This is whithout a doubt, one of the best classics ever seen in the WWE. The first ever Hell in a Cell match and it didn't dissapoint. The Undertaker dominated Shawn during most of this match, and it really started to heat up as they got out of the cell. Even the interference didn't ruin this match, allthough it was a real shocker.  10/10Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle: This was an okay match. Kurt didn't stand a chance and it showed in the match. Funny moment when he came out on a small bike compared to Undertakers huge bike. 8/10Undertaker vs. Kane: This was the first time Undertaker and Kane would fight, and in my opinion it was their best match up. The Undertaker's entrance was awsome with the druids holding up the torches. It was also cool when the Undertaker leaped over the top rope and crashed right onto the announce table. Awsome ending with three tombstones! 10/10The Undertaker vs. Kane: This was the first and only inferno match so far where the entire ring was surrounded by fire. You could feel the heat just by looking at the fire. When Kane's arm caught on fire it was like a torch was lit. 10/10The Undertaker vs. Triple H: This was an awsome match at wrestlmania 17. The ref was unconscious during most of this match which allowed them to really take it to the limit. The Undertaker even chokeslams Triple H over the side of a monitor tower. Even Triple H's sledgehammer couldn't help him. 9/10This DVd was awsome, and the matches were worth it, so go out and buy it.",4,Just barely under a 5 star rating,1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,1914,"['DVD', 'how', 'Dead', 'Man', 'became', 'WWE', 'Icon', 'Ever', 'came', 'Survivor', 'series', 'decade', 'feuded', 'great', 'superstars', 'beaten', 'story', 'how', 'started', 'Phenom', 'became', 'American', 'Bada**.The', 'extras', 'include', 'several', 'matches', 'career', 'are', 'watchable', 'should', 'only', 'watch', 'once', 'while.Undertaker', 'vs.', 'Shawn', 'Michales', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'classics', 'ever', 'seen', 'WWE', 'first', 'ever', 'Hell', 'Cell', 'match', 'did', ""n't"", 'dissapoint', 'Undertaker', 'dominated', 'Shawn', 'most', 'match', 'really', 'started', 'heat', 'up', 'got', 'cell', 'Even', 'interference', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'match', 'was', 'real', 'shocker', '10/10Undertaker', 'vs.', 'Kurt', 'Angle', 'was', 'okay', 'match', 'Kurt', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'showed', 'match', 'Funny', 'moment', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'small', 'bike', 'compared', 'Undertakers', 'huge', 'bike', '8/10Undertaker', 'vs.', 'Kane', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Undertaker', 'Kane', 'would', 'fight', 'opinion', 'was', 'best', 'match', 'up', 'Undertaker', 'entrance', 'was', 'awsome', 'druids', 'holding', 'up', 'torches', 'was', 'also', 'cool', 'when', 'Undertaker', 'leaped', 'top', 'rope', 'crashed', 'right', 'announce', 'table', 'Awsome', 'ending', 'three', 'tombstones', '10/10The', 'Undertaker', 'vs.', 'Kane', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'inferno', 'match', 'so', 'far', 'where', 'entire', 'ring', 'was', 'surrounded', 'fire', 'could', 'feel', 'heat', 'just', 'looking', 'fire', 'When', 'Kane', 'arm', 'caught', 'fire', 'was', 'torch', 'was', 'lit', '10/10The', 'Undertaker', 'vs', 'Triple', 'H', 'was', 'awsome', 'match', '17', 'ref', 'was', 'unconscious', 'most', 'match', 'allowed', 'really', 'take', 'limit', 'Undertaker', 'even', 'Triple', 'H', 'side', 'monitor', 'tower', 'Even', 'Triple', 'H', 'sledgehammer', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', '9/10This', 'DVd', 'was', 'awsome', 'matches', 'were', 'worth', 'so', 'go', 'out', 'buy']",N/A
