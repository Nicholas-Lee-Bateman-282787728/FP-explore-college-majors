910924,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B0009Q0EMY,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[64, 64]","This is the story about two women (Robin Greenspan & Lacie Harmon) who portray themselves in the tale of how they came to be together.  It is a rather unusual film in that it's narrated by both of them.  I felt as though I was in a ""conversation"" with them during the course of the movie.Robin & Lacie are both attractive, but neither are remotely close to being a Supermodel.  Somewhat surprisingly, despite that point, this movie is still one of the most salacious flicks I've ever seen. It had a unique honesty & openness about it that I found to be rather refreshing.People who are looking for a soft-core porn movie that uses the lesbian angle as an excuse for a plot MAY be disappointed in this movie.  This story has a lot more substance to it than what I imagined, and it's quite a well done piece.In the end, it covers the question of commitment vs. being with the person you want to be with.  There are two extremes.  On the one hand, some people expect absolute perfection & will accept nothing less.  On the other hand, there are people who are willing to ""settle for"" someone who does not check-off very many aspects that they're looking for on their personality wish-list.Somewhere in the middle is where we should be.  This applies to all of us, whether we're gay or straight.  Life can be very difficult sometimes, and it becomes obvious that it is a myth that lesbians somehow have it ""easier"" than straight women.If you're looking for a different sort of movie, this one just might be for you.  It offers humor, honesty and frankness blended together with eroticism for a winning story.  If ever there was a movie about lesbians that could actually pass as a date movie (regardless of the genders of the two people), this is it!!",5,This one sizzles!!,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,1747,"['story', 'two', 'women', 'Robin', 'Greenspan', 'Lacie', 'Harmon', 'who', 'portray', 'tale', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'together', 'rather', 'unusual', 'film', 'narrated', 'felt', 'was', 'conversation', 'course', 'movie.Robin', 'Lacie', 'are', 'attractive', 'are', 'remotely', 'close', 'being', 'Supermodel', 'Somewhat', 'surprisingly', 'point', 'movie', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'salacious', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'unique', 'honesty', 'openness', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'refreshing.People', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'movie', 'lesbian', 'angle', 'excuse', 'plot', 'MAY', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'substance', 'what', 'imagined', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'end', 'question', 'commitment', 'vs.', 'being', 'person', 'want', 'be', 'are', 'two', 'extremes', 'one', 'hand', 'people', 'expect', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'will', 'accept', 'nothing', 'less', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'settle', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'check-off', 'very', 'many', 'aspects', ""'re"", 'looking', 'personality', 'wish-list.Somewhere', 'middle', 'where', 'should', 'be', ""'re"", 'gay', 'straight', 'Life', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'sometimes', 'obvious', 'myth', 'somehow', 'have', 'easier', 'straight', 'women.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'different', 'sort', 'movie', 'one', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'humor', 'honesty', 'frankness', 'blended', 'together', 'eroticism', 'winning', 'story', 'ever', 'was', 'movie', 'lesbians', 'could', 'actually', 'pass', 'date', 'movie', 'regardless', 'genders', 'two', 'people']",Girl Play

910930,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009Q0EMY,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[9, 14]","Cinema is a medium that usually focuses on an unbroken chain of images that often are split up into a number of scenes. A series of continuous images creates movement of some kind and strengthens the appealing factor of a scene. Yet, much of what is within the scenes remains stationary, while the audience often finds their attention being attracted to what is in motion. Additional texture often emerges through the fusion of image and sound, as the sound consists of music, dialogue, and sometimes both. Thus, cinema presents a unique opportunity beyond art, music, literature, theater, and dance, as it can combine two or more facets of life and the arts into a thoroughly absorbing experience. However, on occasion some films forget to utilize the exceptional ability of cinema, which leaves the audience with an inorganic cinematic experience.Girl Play presents an intriguingly witty and warm story that is based on the play Real Girls by Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon who also play themselves in the film. The film opens with monologues alternating between Robin and Lacie who begin to debrief the audience about their background to how they fell in love. Robin has settled down with a woman while the free spirited Lacie seeks new challenges out of life on a daily basis. Their monologues narrate how they met and how their careers brought them together. They also disclose how their situations with parents, vocations, and social lives are affected by their love.The monologues in the film are performed in front of what seems to be a small standup stage and the stage crew has decorated the background in order to give the milieu a little depth besides the brick wall behind. Frequently, the monologues are interjected with scenes that depict what Robin and Lacie experienced on their route to this point in their lives. Occasionally, the director Lee Friedlander attempts to utilize more creative cinematography such as creating a black and white scene and the split screen scenes to break up the monotony of the monologues. Despite these extravagant efforts to make the film more appealing Friedlander fails to do so. It is sad to see how the monologues overwhelming length neglects to employ the ability of cinema, which could tie together several aspects of the story in a different light. Instead Girl Play creates a distance between the screen and the audience through the lengthy monologues, which only makes the few cinematic touches feel awkward and out of place. This is truly unfortunate as the story had great potential on both a comic and dramatic level, which probably will cause some viewers to end the cinematic experience before the ending.",3,A Terrific Story That Has Received a Poor Cinematic Treatment...,1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,2670,"['Cinema', 'medium', 'usually', 'unbroken', 'chain', 'images', 'often', 'are', 'split', 'up', 'number', 'scenes', 'series', 'continuous', 'images', 'movement', 'kind', 'appealing', 'factor', 'scene', 'much', 'what', 'scenes', 'stationary', 'audience', 'often', 'attention', 'being', 'attracted', 'what', 'motion', 'Additional', 'texture', 'often', 'fusion', 'image', 'sound', 'sound', 'music', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'Thus', 'cinema', 'presents', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'art', 'music', 'literature', 'theater', 'dance', 'can', 'combine', 'two', 'more', 'facets', 'life', 'arts', 'thoroughly', 'absorbing', 'experience', 'However', 'occasion', 'films', 'forget', 'utilize', 'exceptional', 'ability', 'cinema', 'audience', 'inorganic', 'cinematic', 'experience.Girl', 'Play', 'intriguingly', 'witty', 'warm', 'story', 'based', 'play', 'Real', 'Girls', 'Robin', 'Greenspan', 'Lacie', 'Harmon', 'who', 'also', 'play', 'film', 'film', 'monologues', 'alternating', 'Robin', 'Lacie', 'who', 'begin', 'debrief', 'audience', 'background', 'how', 'fell', 'love', 'Robin', 'settled', 'down', 'woman', 'free', 'spirited', 'Lacie', 'new', 'challenges', 'life', 'daily', 'basis', 'monologues', 'narrate', 'how', 'met', 'how', 'careers', 'brought', 'together', 'also', 'disclose', 'how', 'situations', 'parents', 'vocations', 'social', 'lives', 'are', 'affected', 'love.The', 'monologues', 'film', 'are', 'performed', 'front', 'what', 'be', 'small', 'standup', 'stage', 'stage', 'crew', 'decorated', 'background', 'order', 'give', 'milieu', 'little', 'depth', 'brick', 'wall', 'Frequently', 'monologues', 'are', 'interjected', 'scenes', 'depict', 'what', 'Robin', 'Lacie', 'experienced', 'route', 'point', 'lives', 'Occasionally', 'director', 'Lee', 'Friedlander', 'attempts', 'utilize', 'more', 'creative', 'cinematography', 'such', 'creating', 'black', 'white', 'scene', 'split', 'screen', 'scenes', 'break', 'up', 'monotony', 'monologues', 'extravagant', 'efforts', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'appealing', 'Friedlander', 'fails', 'do', 'so', 'sad', 'see', 'how', 'monologues', 'overwhelming', 'length', 'neglects', 'employ', 'ability', 'cinema', 'could', 'tie', 'together', 'several', 'aspects', 'story', 'different', 'light', 'Instead', 'Girl', 'Play', 'distance', 'screen', 'audience', 'lengthy', 'monologues', 'only', 'few', 'cinematic', 'touches', 'feel', 'awkward', 'place', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'story', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'comic', 'dramatic', 'level', 'probably', 'will', 'cause', 'viewers', 'end', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'ending']",Girl Play

The story is narrated by the real two women standing on a stage telling the story of their relationship. Their narration is interrupted by a sort of reenactment of what they are telling you about, starring them but including actors playing the other parts. It is a creative and entertaining way to do a film.The movie explores universal themes, not even primarily lesbian themes---things like falling in love with someone else when you're in a committed relationship, how it feels to be unable to resurrect a dead relationship, how it feels to try to make love to someone you are committed to but whom you have drifted far away from.I loved it.

910935,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B0009Q0EMY,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[14, 17]","Whatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie.  Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and ""sparks fly.""  As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe.From the movie's self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless:  Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians?  Do the production's other members? Does that derail the production?  What mayhem ensues?In point of fact, however, the single attempt at ""comedy"" comes from DeLuise's portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats.The bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the ""actresses"" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore.  The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic.  There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders.About the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street.  Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters.  Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves.  If so, then this IS bad acting.  If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances.
