In fact, the only thing that saved the one tribe from being completely Pagonged was because Terry's pompous ass kept winning immunity.  I honestly started hating him because of the way he acted when he won the challenges with his ""YESYESYESYES!!!!""  Exile Island and the hidden immunity idol barely played a part except to breed major paranoia.  And Shane was incredibly annoying.  Just not one of the best, but far from one of the worst.  The one incredibly bright light was Cirie who is always a joy to watch and a very smart player.",2,Just okay,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,665,"['season', 'was', 'fine', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'very', 'likable', 'cast', 'Cirie', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'shocking', 'votes', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'saved', 'one', 'tribe', 'being', 'completely', 'Pagonged', 'was', 'Terry', 'pompous', 'ass', 'kept', 'winning', 'immunity', 'honestly', 'started', 'hating', 'way', 'acted', 'when', 'won', 'challenges', 'Exile', 'Island', 'hidden', 'immunity', 'idol', 'barely', 'played', 'part', 'breed', 'major', 'paranoia', 'Shane', 'was', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'Just', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'far', 'one', 'worst', 'one', 'incredibly', 'bright', 'light', 'was', 'Cirie', 'who', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'very', 'smart', 'player']",Survivor: Panama - Exile Island

This was when 'Survivor' had GONE DOWNHILL. No wonder this was the first season to fall out the top 10 most watched TV shows of any television season. It was a disappointment from beginning to end and so was the cast. None of my family or friends liked this season either. The only three people that I actually enjoyed watching were Cirie, Melinda, and Sally. The majority of the cast is just plain UNLIKEABLE. Two examples are Aras, who is incredibly arrogant and shallow, and Shane is just plain weird. I also never understood why Danielle DiLerenzo returned for 'Heroes vs. Villains'. Not only was she unlikeable, but she also is forgettable. At least, she was put on the Villains tribe. Do not watch this season.

He should have been in fans vs. favorites 1 or 2. This is the first installment of exile island, which was a pretty stupid idea in the first place. It's so much better now that everyone gets a chance at the hidden immunity idol instead of just the people who go to exile island. Danielle was a villain in Heroes vs. Villains and it doesn't make sense at all. She's definitely not a hero but being a villain because of this season is ridiculous. She is on that season because she's hot and has fake boobs. Cirie is a fat slob and is worthless. I can't believe Cirie has been on 3 seasons of survivor. It's amazing how one tribe is so dysfunctional and how well they do at challenges. Shane smoked 3 packs of cigarettes a day before going on survivor and goes through detox during the season.

So many of us fans would much rather buy a decent copy of the show than try to record our own (Australian networks are so slack about screening the show in a regular time slot its impossible to not miss half the episodes when they eventually air) Trying to download from the internet is impossible for those who are not computer savvy - just let me buy my DVD's from a shop.  The seasons that were realeased already were not released outside of the US, which means that ordering them from stores like Amazon is a fans only hope of buying them.  If the boxed sets were avail in store outside of North America the production company could have sold many more copies.
