298129,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6302149487,Alex Udvary,"[8, 41]","I personally feel, there are two ways to judge movies. And to determine if they are good or not. The first way, and I think the best way is to judge the quality of the film. Is the directing first rate? Is the screenplay smart and witty? Does it make sense? How is the acting? Do the actors turn in good performances? Are they're characters of the viewer to relate to? Is there some sort of human condition where we feel sorry for the characters? And, if all of this falls into place then I feel you have a wonderful movie. The second way to judge a movie would be to determine if it's simply enjoyable. If it's a guilty pleasure. If your in the mood of lets say some stupid funny comedy. And don't care if the movie is well made, but, as long as it has laughs in it then you should buy or rent that movie. Is the person getting what they wanted out of a certain movie? I don't care if it's &quot;Austin Powers&quot;, &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot;, or some teen comedy. I'm not here to rate people's taste. Now, in knowing what I just said before, about judging a movie, I honestly feel &quot;Weekend&quot; fails in both groups. Many people love movies because it makes them think of when they were younger. It brings back memories. And, perhaps that's the case with this Godard film. I wasn't born in the 60's but maybe so many people like this film because it reflects what was going on in the country at that time. And, if that's the case fine. But, if someone likes the movie for that reason, if you watch it now, that appeal it once had, I feel is now gone. &quot;Weekend&quot; from what I understand after reading the back of the cover was suppose to be Godard making some sort of satire about what has happened to society. He takes the &quot;disjointed&quot; ways of life and applies that &quot;craziness&quot; to the road. There a scene that goes on for about 10 minutes (I could be wrong. I didn't time the scene) where all you see is a long line of traffic. As the two main charaters; Corinne (Mireille Darc) and Roland (Jean Yanne) drive along side trying to get past the traffic. This is considered a &quot;land mark&quot; scene. Godard to me, is just a little bit over the line to the point where he hits being pretenious. Godard has made other films where he trys to examine society. Right now I'm thinking about &quot;Two or Three Things I Know About Her&quot;. But was the metaphor of traffic such a great one to express the social relevancy of the times? If you switch over to Italian cimema and watch Visconti's films, he too, dealt with the down side of society. About how the higher class seems to be no better than the lower class. Watch films like &quot;The Innocent&quot;, &quot;Ludwig&quot;, or &quot;The Leopard&quot;. Visconti used much better metaphors to express his ideas. Fammed Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman was once quoted as saying he hates, he actually used to word hate. He hates Godard's films. He went on to say that he gets the feeling that Godard wants to say something important. but leaves you hanging for more. Sometimes I agree with that statement. There's a scene where a black worker (I'm sorry but I don't seem to remember the name of the character or who played him) and a french worker. They are each describing the &quot;problems&quot; the other ethnic group has or had to face. Now, I don't know, maybe when this was first released. People were taken with this. Maybe Godard didn't have to go all the way with the speech. Maybe people just seemed to completely understand what he was talking about. But, their words to me, are just a bunch of words that never amount to meaningful sentences. He's trying to say something important, but, doesn't go all the way. I really don't think this film is worth watching. Many times durning the movie I found I was getting bored. But I stuck with the movie. The movie just doesn't work. If people would just put aside their admiration for Godard for one second. Clear their eyes watch the movie, and please try to keep in mind what I said. Maybe, just maybe, some people might admit, I have a case to be made. Maybe a small case, but still a case.",1,A Lost Weekend!,987552000,"04 18, 2001",2001,4138,"['personally', 'feel', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'judge', 'movies', 'determine', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'first', 'way', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'judge', 'quality', 'film', 'directing', 'first', 'rate', 'screenplay', 'smart', 'witty', 'make', 'sense', 'How', 'acting', 'Do', 'actors', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'Are', ""'re"", 'characters', 'viewer', 'relate', 'Is', 'there', 'sort', 'human', 'condition', 'where', 'feel', 'sorry', 'characters', 'place', 'then', 'feel', 'have', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'second', 'way', 'judge', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'determine', 'simply', 'enjoyable', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mood', 'lets', 'say', 'stupid', 'funny', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'as', 'long', 'laughs', 'then', 'should', 'buy', 'rent', 'movie', 'person', 'getting', 'what', 'wanted', 'certain', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'quot', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'quot', 'teen', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'rate', 'people', 'taste', 'Now', 'knowing', 'what', 'just', 'said', 'judging', 'movie', 'honestly', 'feel', 'quot', 'Weekend', 'quot', 'groups', 'Many', 'people', 'love', 'movies', 'think', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'back', 'memories', 'perhaps', 'case', 'Godard', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', '60', 'maybe', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'country', 'time', 'case', 'fine', 'someone', 'movie', 'reason', 'watch', 'now', 'appeal', 'once', 'had', 'feel', 'now', 'gone', 'quot', 'Weekend', 'quot', 'what', 'understand', 'reading', 'back', 'cover', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'Godard', 'making', 'sort', 'satire', 'what', 'happened', 'society', 'quot', 'disjointed', 'quot', 'ways', 'life', 'applies', 'quot', 'craziness', 'quot', 'road', 'scene', '10', 'minutes', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'time', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'long', 'line', 'traffic', 'two', 'main', 'charaters', 'Corinne', 'Mireille', 'Darc', 'Roland', 'Jean', 'Yanne', 'drive', 'side', 'trying', 'get', 'traffic', 'considered', 'quot', 'mark', 'quot', 'scene', 'Godard', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'line', 'point', 'where', 'being', 'pretenious', 'Godard', 'made', 'other', 'films', 'where', 'examine', 'society', 'Right', 'now', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'quot', 'Two', 'Three', 'Things', 'Know', 'Her', 'quot', 'was', 'metaphor', 'traffic', 'such', 'great', 'one', 'express', 'social', 'relevancy', 'times', 'switch', 'Italian', 'cimema', 'watch', 'Visconti', 'films', 'too', 'dealt', 'down', 'side', 'society', 'how', 'higher', 'class', 'be', 'no', 'better', 'lower', 'class', 'Watch', 'films', 'quot', 'Innocent', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ludwig', 'quot', 'quot', 'Leopard', 'quot', 'Visconti', 'used', 'much', 'better', 'metaphors', 'express', 'ideas', 'Fammed', 'Swedish', 'filmmaker', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'was', 'once', 'quoted', 'saying', 'actually', 'used', 'word', 'hate', 'Godard', 'films', 'went', 'say', 'feeling', 'Godard', 'say', 'something', 'important', 'hanging', 'more', 'Sometimes', 'agree', 'statement', 'scene', 'where', 'black', 'worker', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'name', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'french', 'worker', 'are', 'describing', 'quot', 'problems', 'quot', 'other', 'ethnic', 'group', 'had', 'face', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'People', 'were', 'taken', 'Maybe', 'Godard', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'way', 'speech', 'Maybe', 'people', 'just', 'seemed', 'completely', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'words', 'are', 'just', 'bunch', 'words', 'never', 'amount', 'meaningful', 'sentences', 'trying', 'say', 'something', 'important', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'Many', 'times', 'durning', 'movie', 'found', 'was', 'getting', 'bored', 'stuck', 'movie', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'people', 'would', 'just', 'put', 'aside', 'admiration', 'Godard', 'one', 'second', 'Clear', 'eyes', 'watch', 'movie', 'please', 'try', 'keep', 'mind', 'what', 'said', 'Maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'people', 'might', 'admit', 'have', 'case', 'be', 'made', 'Maybe', 'small', 'case', 'still', 'case']",Weekend VHS

298131,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302149487,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Jean-Luc Godard is, quite possibly, the greatest director of all time.  I know, that is a hefty title to heap on any individual, but every film I see by the master is better than the last and just further cements in my minds eye his staggering genius.`Weed End' is no exception.Godard frequently used his artistic approach to elaborate on the political dilemmas facing his country at that given time, and the Parisian 60's were a ripe canvas for Godard's superior sense of cinematic vision.  The life of the bourgeois (for an interesting read, check out the Wikipedia page for `bourgeoisie', which will enlighten you on the very culture with which Godard pointed his camera lens) is dissected with brash statements that firmly underscore a point of view towards the political situations they found themselves in, using vivid and ridiculously obscene imagery and dialog to drive home the absurdity of the moment.One, two, three, four...The film revolves around a young Parisian couple who is sifting in their own moral callousness, each individual party possessing disturbed ideals and ideas.  The two embark on a dreaded weekend with the wife's parents, where they fantasize about the demise of her father so as to reap the benefits of his will.  Along the way they are bombarded with events out of their control that only serve to further embellish their misplaced priorities.When their car is engulfed in flames, the cries for the loss of a handbag place a bold exclamation-point at the end of this couples `description'.The absurdity of the film engulfs itself, really piling one ridiculous moment on top of the other, but all in a way that thrives within the context of the film.  Godard was never a mainstream director, but he also created art pieces that told a story, that elaborated on truths not willingly admitted by those around him.  Godard understood that filmmaking was a gift, a gift to be used as a tool to instill something in others.  In all of his works, he did that very thing.  With exaggerated sequences that uses unending tracking shots to create a feeling of uneasiness in the viewer (the never-ending traffic jam is one of many), Godard splashed visual wizardry on the screen and imprinted his political satire on the minds of the audience.  Some have noted that Godard was a distant or cold director, but I find that aspect of his work endearing, for it sharply places a sense of realism in his wildly imaginative take on reality.  There is nothing within `Week End' that appears real.  In fact, even the protagonists here question their reality.  The sequences (which involve, among other things, murder and cannibalism) all wear the stain of the absurd and yet they feel remarkably `honest' thanks to the `cold' approach that Godard takes.  By stepping away from the characters and the moments and delivering a nonchalant take, he inserts a frigid sense of reality that makes this pill a lot easier to swallow.We buy it, every image and every spoken word.",5,Grit your teeth and bare it...,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2983,"['Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'quite', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'director', 'time', 'know', 'hefty', 'title', 'heap', 'individual', 'film', 'see', 'master', 'better', 'last', 'just', 'further', 'cements', 'minds', 'eye', 'staggering', 'genius.', 'Weed', 'End', 'exception.Godard', 'frequently', 'used', 'artistic', 'approach', 'elaborate', 'political', 'dilemmas', 'facing', 'country', 'given', 'time', 'Parisian', '60', 'were', 'ripe', 'canvas', 'Godard', 'superior', 'sense', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'life', 'bourgeois', 'interesting', 'read', 'check', 'out', 'Wikipedia', 'page', 'bourgeoisie', 'will', 'enlighten', 'very', 'culture', 'Godard', 'pointed', 'camera', 'lens', 'dissected', 'brash', 'statements', 'firmly', 'underscore', 'point', 'view', 'political', 'situations', 'found', 'using', 'vivid', 'ridiculously', 'obscene', 'imagery', 'dialog', 'drive', 'home', 'absurdity', 'moment.One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'film', 'around', 'young', 'Parisian', 'couple', 'who', 'sifting', 'own', 'moral', 'callousness', 'individual', 'party', 'possessing', 'disturbed', 'ideals', 'ideas', 'two', 'embark', 'dreaded', 'weekend', 'wife', 'parents', 'where', 'fantasize', 'demise', 'father', 'so', 'reap', 'benefits', 'will', 'way', 'are', 'bombarded', 'events', 'control', 'only', 'serve', 'further', 'embellish', 'misplaced', 'priorities.When', 'car', 'engulfed', 'flames', 'cries', 'loss', 'handbag', 'place', 'bold', 'exclamation-point', 'end', 'couples', ""description'.The"", 'absurdity', 'film', 'engulfs', 'really', 'piling', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'moment', 'top', 'other', 'way', 'context', 'film', 'Godard', 'was', 'never', 'mainstream', 'director', 'also', 'created', 'art', 'pieces', 'told', 'story', 'elaborated', 'truths', 'not', 'willingly', 'admitted', 'Godard', 'understood', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'gift', 'gift', 'be', 'used', 'tool', 'instill', 'something', 'others', 'works', 'did', 'very', 'thing', 'exaggerated', 'sequences', 'unending', 'tracking', 'shots', 'create', 'feeling', 'uneasiness', 'viewer', 'never-ending', 'traffic', 'jam', 'one', 'many', 'Godard', 'splashed', 'visual', 'wizardry', 'screen', 'imprinted', 'political', 'satire', 'minds', 'audience', 'have', 'noted', 'Godard', 'was', 'distant', 'cold', 'director', 'find', 'aspect', 'work', 'endearing', 'sharply', 'sense', 'realism', 'wildly', 'imaginative', 'take', 'reality', 'nothing', 'Week', 'End', 'real', 'fact', 'even', 'protagonists', 'here', 'question', 'reality', 'sequences', 'involve', 'other', 'things', 'murder', 'cannibalism', 'wear', 'stain', 'absurd', 'yet', 'feel', 'remarkably', 'honest', 'thanks', 'cold', 'approach', 'Godard', 'stepping', 'away', 'characters', 'moments', 'delivering', 'nonchalant', 'take', 'frigid', 'sense', 'reality', 'pill', 'lot', 'easier', 'swallow.We', 'buy', 'image', 'spoken', 'word']",Weekend VHS
298132,ARA48345JZPZR,6302149487,Archmaker,"[7, 26]","It's been 4 decades and viewing the political notions in Weekend had for me the feel of the stale dialogue that comes from aging activists who have built a lifetime's ethos and idealogy constructed around insights and ideas they had when they were 19 years old.  No matter that history may have demonstrated how wrong-headed and downright misinformed they may have been, they remain true believers.  Mind you, I have no idea what Jean Luc Godard believes today, but I believe he was part of that French intellectual class that embraced some, if not all, of the ""revolutionary"" rubbish of the 60's and 70's that passed for brilliance in its day.This film is a product of the late 60's when intellectual France, much as intellectual America, was being galvanized into action by opposition to the Viet Nam War and by a romantic notion of the Youth Generation as torch bearers for a new age of enlightenment.  Godard distances himself from the nonsense his young revolutionaries spout, so I don't know what part, if any, he embraces or rejects.  Godard specialists can guide you there.What I see on film, is how tired hot-button political issues become with time and the perspective of history.  Likewise, how utterly mundane what once might have been shocking or ""revolutionary"" becomes with that same time and distance.I always brace myself when I hear the word ""absurdist"" applied to any work of art.  That term can cover the range of the razor sharp satire of a Voltaire to the inane shenanigans of the Three Stooges.  At least the Stooges are straightforward and un-pretentious.  What we get in a much absurdist art is a lot of muck thrown against a wall to see if any sticks.  But with the pretense!  Artsy fartsy stoogery.Director Mike Figgis in the extras says Godard's films inspired because they were ""full of ideas"".  Yep.  You will have to judge whether any of them are worth your time to sort out as you follow this meandering tale.The film starts out well, when after a pornographic monologue (no doubt shocking in 1967) we are introduced to a despicable bourgeois couple, intent on murder of rich relatives and unbeknownst to themselves, each other.  They are vile and amusing, and yes there soon comes the famous endless traffic jam, and it is a nice conceit.  What follows after that, I must confess, increasingly bored and irritated me. An occasional aside or moment was fine, but most of it was about as interesting as having an insurance policy explained, or the subtleties of Gallic political theory.Godard is an acquired taste apparently.  I have tried.  I find some interest in Breathless, Le Petit Soldad, and several others, but the deep regard some have for his work is lost on me.  He may have broken new ground, no doubt.  But there is a certain French existential ennui that breathes beneath his films that just doesn't appeal to me.  It may be a perfecly valid viewpoint, but it cloys. His embrace of film history while questioning its relevance gets old fast. I must try some of his later works, because what I have sampled from the early stuff seems terribly dated and trivial today.",2,Passe...,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,3111,"['been', '4', 'decades', 'viewing', 'political', 'notions', 'Weekend', 'had', 'feel', 'stale', 'dialogue', 'aging', 'activists', 'who', 'have', 'built', 'lifetime', 'ethos', 'idealogy', 'constructed', 'insights', 'ideas', 'had', 'when', 'were', '19', 'years', 'old', 'matter', 'history', 'may', 'have', 'demonstrated', 'how', 'wrong-headed', 'downright', 'misinformed', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'remain', 'true', 'believers', 'Mind', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Jean', 'Luc', 'Godard', 'today', 'believe', 'was', 'part', 'French', 'intellectual', 'class', 'embraced', 'not', 'revolutionary', 'rubbish', '60', '70', 'passed', 'brilliance', 'day.This', 'film', 'product', 'late', '60', 'when', 'intellectual', 'France', 'much', 'intellectual', 'America', 'was', 'being', 'galvanized', 'action', 'opposition', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'War', 'romantic', 'notion', 'Youth', 'Generation', 'torch', 'bearers', 'new', 'age', 'enlightenment', 'Godard', 'nonsense', 'young', 'revolutionaries', 'spout', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'part', 'rejects', 'Godard', 'specialists', 'can', 'guide', 'see', 'film', 'how', 'tired', 'hot-button', 'political', 'issues', 'become', 'time', 'perspective', 'history', 'Likewise', 'how', 'utterly', 'mundane', 'what', 'once', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'shocking', 'revolutionary', 'same', 'time', 'distance.I', 'always', 'brace', 'when', 'hear', 'word', 'absurdist', 'applied', 'work', 'art', 'term', 'can', 'cover', 'range', 'razor', 'sharp', 'satire', 'Voltaire', 'inane', 'shenanigans', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'least', 'Stooges', 'are', 'straightforward', 'un-pretentious', 'What', 'get', 'much', 'absurdist', 'art', 'lot', 'muck', 'thrown', 'wall', 'see', 'sticks', 'pretense', 'Artsy', 'fartsy', 'stoogery.Director', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'extras', 'Godard', 'films', 'inspired', 'were', 'full', 'ideas', 'Yep', 'will', 'have', 'judge', 'are', 'time', 'sort', 'out', 'follow', 'meandering', 'tale.The', 'film', 'out', 'well', 'when', 'pornographic', 'monologue', 'doubt', 'shocking', '1967', 'are', 'introduced', 'despicable', 'bourgeois', 'couple', 'intent', 'murder', 'rich', 'relatives', 'unbeknownst', 'other', 'are', 'vile', 'amusing', 'yes', 'there', 'soon', 'famous', 'endless', 'traffic', 'jam', 'nice', 'conceit', 'What', 'must', 'confess', 'increasingly', 'bored', 'irritated', 'occasional', 'aside', 'moment', 'was', 'fine', 'most', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'interesting', 'having', 'insurance', 'policy', 'explained', 'subtleties', 'Gallic', 'political', 'theory.Godard', 'acquired', 'taste', 'apparently', 'have', 'tried', 'find', 'interest', 'Breathless', 'Le', 'Petit', 'Soldad', 'several', 'others', 'deep', 'regard', 'have', 'work', 'lost', 'may', 'have', 'broken', 'new', 'ground', 'doubt', 'certain', 'French', 'existential', 'ennui', 'films', 'just', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'may', 'be', 'perfecly', 'valid', 'viewpoint', 'embrace', 'film', 'history', 'questioning', 'relevance', 'old', 'fast', 'must', 'try', 'later', 'works', 'what', 'have', 'sampled', 'early', 'stuff', 'terribly', 'dated', 'trivial', 'today']",Weekend VHS

298134,A2Z28WKY1LHBKY,6302149487,"blockhed ""blockhed""","[3, 10]","Nobody seems to have given this film 3 stars yet, so I'm the first. I feel it's just slightly better than 2 stars, but definitely not 4. Frankly, I got the feeling that Godard was simply coasting along, simply chucking at the audience the next thing that came into his cluttered head. They can work out some sort of pattern to it for themselves, if they want to be bothered. Is this all surrealism is, in the end? There are two interviews that come with the features. One is with Mike Figgis, who treats us to an esoteric interpretation which can only barely be understood: anything that the viewer might perceive as a flaw in the film is held up as a virtue. This is apparently because the genius Godard is ""distancing"" himself, and the film itself, both from its subject and the viewer. Well, maybe. The other interview is with the photographer. It looks like Godard was in a filthy mood with everybody when he was making the film, especially the producer and the leading actress. The implication was that the producer had forced the genius to use this actress against his wishes. Shades of Mulholland Drive. Some art critics think that a preliminary sketch is better than a finished picture. This may be so, but only sometimes: sometimes a picture can be over-finished, and its freshness destroyed. But there is a happy medium. No matter how surreal the final product, there does need to be an underlying cohesion, if the audience is to be genuinely impressed and feel some sense of satisfaction. I don't think it will wash to argue that the ultimate intention is to dissatisfy. This is an objective which is far too easy to achieve.

298135,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,6302149487,Edmonson,"[1, 1]","""Weekend"" (1967) is directed by Jean Luc Godard (Breathless, Pierrot le fou, Le Mepris). This black comedy follows a bourgeois married couple, who both have secret lovers, and who are both planning the others' murder. They set off for her parents' home in the country to secure her inheritance from her dying father. On the way through the picturesque countryside they witness violent car accidents, as well as an assortment of characters, some from literature and history, and others representing the various classes in society. The film is broken up with intertitles that comment on the action as well as on the process of film viewing. Discussions from characters range from notions on identity to class struggle. The two protagonists seem intent on their sole and petty goal of the inheritance despite the fact that most everyone else around them are focused on more grave notions regarding philosophy and the binding relationships between humanity and the disparities between people and their rights and freedoms. This incongruous relationship between the two leads, and those around them, is enhanced by the jarring musical score which often sounds like the dramatic music from a film noire gangster film.The film also includes some special features, including a commentary by critic David Sterritt, an interview with cinematographer Raoul Coutard, and a Mike Riggis interview about his views on the film.",4,An intellectual black comedy...,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,1411,"['Weekend', '1967', 'directed', 'Jean', 'Luc', 'Godard', 'Breathless', 'Pierrot', 'fou', 'Le', 'Mepris', 'black', 'comedy', 'bourgeois', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'secret', 'lovers', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'others', 'murder', 'set', 'off', 'parents', 'home', 'country', 'secure', 'inheritance', 'dying', 'father', 'way', 'picturesque', 'countryside', 'witness', 'violent', 'car', 'accidents', 'as', 'well', 'assortment', 'characters', 'literature', 'history', 'others', 'representing', 'various', 'classes', 'society', 'film', 'broken', 'up', 'intertitles', 'comment', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'process', 'film', 'viewing', 'Discussions', 'characters', 'range', 'notions', 'identity', 'class', 'struggle', 'two', 'protagonists', 'seem', 'intent', 'sole', 'petty', 'goal', 'inheritance', 'fact', 'most', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'focused', 'more', 'grave', 'notions', 'regarding', 'philosophy', 'binding', 'relationships', 'humanity', 'disparities', 'people', 'rights', 'freedoms', 'incongruous', 'relationship', 'two', 'leads', 'enhanced', 'jarring', 'musical', 'score', 'often', 'dramatic', 'music', 'film', 'noire', 'gangster', 'film.The', 'film', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'critic', 'David', 'Sterritt', 'interview', 'cinematographer', 'Raoul', 'Coutard', 'Mike', 'Riggis', 'interview', 'views', 'film']",Weekend VHS

298139,AYVFNOQHY8P3,6302149487,J. Christal,"[17, 28]","Jean-Luc Godard's film Week End is loaded with his obsessions with outrageous characters, political and philosophical ideas, and so on, and many viewers have claimed this to be a full on political film. From what I could gather after seeing a poor yet manageable copy of this film, I saw that this is possibly his best effort in terms of abrasive, surreal though bravura directing. He leaves the camera on his characters, with their flaws almost shining off them (which serves as an asset in some scenes), and yet most of the time it feels like he's directing a comedy of these events- comedy of errors.Consider the scene where the woman has the monologue in her panties and bra, how she leads up such telling, informatory details to a payoff that gives as a reminder of the Walken scene in Pulp Fiction (though he is the better actor). Or in other times the comedy is in the sense of a Godard satire of his past work - the traffic set piece(s) gets the viewer to feel in the mood of the car he so pacingly follows, even as it becomes relentlessly obnoxious and tense, and acts like every other driver on the streets of the cities of America.However that, and a moment of argument over a corpse in the passenger seat (he cuts to the faces of the onlookers who happen to find such dialogue rather amusing), show by the time Godard reached this stage in his career he wasn't taking himself and his work 100 % seriously, though that's not to say that the element of the woman's path to guerilla-hood isn't a serious topic. For his art film die-hards he also uses a peculiar, non-linear style in story-telling- an added advantage for a week-end timepiece.I'm reminded of Fellini (as I was while watching another Godard film of recent, Contempt) in one aspect of the picture, in terms of how he portrays his women- he can love them, ignore them, belittle them, or even glorify them in the most drastic of measures, but he can't control them. One also wonders if this is how he just makes it for his films, or if in real life the women of his life were really this (how do I put it) out-there.The script occasionally veers off on it's tale of a couple going on a disastrous week-end out for stretches of poetry, discussion, things that don't have much to do with the story, and yet there's a catching, eccentric, melodic aura to these scenes and passages. These kinds of scenes make it perfectly clear that Godard has created an original work here, one that may put off audience members who ""don't get it"" or expect total sense in the outcomes. Certainly a movie made for it's time, country of origin, and target group.To sum up my review let me put it this way - this is the kind of picture that would've heavily influenced The Doors.",5,One of the most fascinating of Godard's new wave efforts,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,2729,"['Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'film', 'Week', 'End', 'loaded', 'obsessions', 'outrageous', 'characters', 'political', 'philosophical', 'ideas', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'have', 'claimed', 'be', 'full', 'political', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'gather', 'seeing', 'poor', 'yet', 'manageable', 'copy', 'film', 'saw', 'possibly', 'best', 'effort', 'terms', 'abrasive', 'surreal', 'bravura', 'directing', 'camera', 'characters', 'flaws', 'almost', 'shining', 'off', 'asset', 'scenes', 'yet', 'most', 'time', 'directing', 'comedy', 'events-', 'comedy', 'errors.Consider', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'monologue', 'panties', 'bra', 'how', 'up', 'such', 'telling', 'informatory', 'details', 'payoff', 'reminder', 'Walken', 'scene', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'better', 'actor', 'other', 'times', 'comedy', 'sense', 'Godard', 'satire', 'past', 'work', 'traffic', 'set', 'piece', 'viewer', 'feel', 'mood', 'car', 'so', 'pacingly', 'even', 'relentlessly', 'obnoxious', 'tense', 'acts', 'other', 'driver', 'streets', 'cities', 'America.However', 'moment', 'argument', 'corpse', 'passenger', 'seat', 'onlookers', 'who', 'happen', 'find', 'such', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'amusing', 'show', 'time', 'Godard', 'reached', 'stage', 'career', 'was', ""n't"", 'taking', 'work', '100', '%', 'seriously', 'not', 'say', 'element', 'woman', 'path', 'guerilla-hood', ""n't"", 'serious', 'topic', 'art', 'film', 'die-hards', 'also', 'peculiar', 'non-linear', 'style', 'story-telling-', 'added', 'advantage', 'week-end', 'timepiece.I', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'Fellini', 'was', 'watching', 'Godard', 'film', 'recent', 'Contempt', 'one', 'aspect', 'picture', 'terms', 'how', 'women-', 'can', 'love', 'ignore', 'belittle', 'even', 'glorify', 'most', 'drastic', 'measures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'One', 'also', 'how', 'just', 'films', 'real', 'life', 'women', 'life', 'were', 'really', 'how', 'do', 'put', 'out-there.The', 'script', 'occasionally', 'veers', 'off', 'tale', 'couple', 'going', 'disastrous', 'week-end', 'stretches', 'poetry', 'discussion', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'story', 'yet', 'catching', 'eccentric', 'melodic', 'aura', 'scenes', 'passages', 'kinds', 'scenes', 'make', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'Godard', 'created', 'original', 'work', 'here', 'one', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'audience', 'members', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'expect', 'total', 'sense', 'outcomes', 'Certainly', 'movie', 'made', 'time', 'country', 'origin', 'target', 'group.To', 'sum', 'up', 'review', 'let', 'put', 'way', 'kind', 'picture', 'would', ""'ve"", 'heavily', 'influenced', 'Doors']",Weekend VHS
298140,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6302149487,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Have you ever seen a movie where, once it's over, you have no idea what you have just seen? Well, that's pretty much what Jean-Luc Godard's movie ""Weekend"" was like for me. It's the first movie I've seen by Godard; A director, whose work I've been wanting to see for years because I heard he was an inspiration for Quentin Tarantino (my favorite filmmaker). ""Weekend"" seems to take place in a post-Apocalyptic world or Hell; either way, it's a very unique looking movie. The movie features a series of unbroken shots; Including one in the beginning where Corinne explains to her husband Roland about a sexual experience that she had (maybe only in her dreams). This shot (I didn't time it) is completely unbroken and lasts, at least, five minutes. Corinne and Roland are a despicable couple, who are traveling to their parents house. En route, every bizarre thing that you've never though would happen in a movie happens. There's a traffic jam, which is a shot that also seems to never end. There's burning cars...If I've seen a more unique movie than this; I don't remember what it was. The movie is also very funny;A scene early in the film (where the couple tries to leave, but encounters a demon-child, his screaming mother, and a man with a gun) was hilarious. Despite all these traits, a lot of people won't like this movie. This certainly isn't a movie you're going to watch with the family and some popcorn. I think if you do like this film (or appreciate it) you will have a desire to see it again immediately. The movie is, essentially, told through images that aren't always explained and rarely make sense. Whether this improves upon each viewing is yet to be seen, but I'm definitely intrigued. As I said, I've never seen a Godard film but I already want to see another one. A lot of movies can be called original and unique; this movie TRULY is unique. I haven't seen anything like it and chances are, you haven't either. I don't know if you'll agree with me or not, but this is what a film buff would refer to as ""a cinematic experience.""

298142,A2TFV7IJSKJPTS,6302149487,Oliver Sheppard,"[21, 28]","WARNING: SPOILERS BELOWI've not seen all of Jean-Luc Godard's films, but of those I have seen this is my favorite. The narrative concerns a conventional, middle class, married couple who conspire to take a weekend trip to kill the wife's parents for money.The car trip taken by the couple is comprised of a series of disastrous, improbable, and perplexing events. Art terrorists, thieves, rapists, and Marxist revolutionaries assail the couple at all turns. France is being overrun by weirdos! Bloody, flaming car (and plane!) crashes are everywhere. Violent demise is at every turn.In the movie is a famous traffic jam scene that employed what was, up until the time of this movie's making, the longest dolly ever made. The scene is absurd, comical, and one of the delights of the movie. Likewise, Godard was becoming interested in socialist politics at this time in his career, in light of the Vietnam war and anti-colonial struggles that were happening globally, so a lot of ""revolutionary"" ideas are expressed by characters in the film. Unfortunately Godard most often has people simply read manifestos to the camera. Godard's political interests are thus conveyed in an awkward, cumbersome way. You do not have to agree with they're saying in order to enjoy the film.Having said that, the movie is still one hell of a ride -- no pun intended. The bourgeois couple at the heart of the story don't care about the flaming chaos around them. They just want their money. At one point the husband even sits idly by as a stranger rapes his wife.As a journey narrative of two people, WEEKEND (or is it WEEK END?)is reminiscent of Alejandro Jodorwosky's 1968 FANDO & LIS. (There was something in the water in the late 60s.) Like Fando & Lis, Weekend is mainly a series of segments or vignettes strung together over the course of two protagonists' quest. In Fando & Lis's case the couple's uest is for the fabled City of Tar; in Weekend's case it's for an ample inheritance.The last 30 minutes are the best in the film, as well as the most graphic. Comparisons to Pasolini's SALO or even John Waters's PINK FLAMINGOS may come to mind. In short, the bourgeois couple are kidnapped by mod-ish looking radical militants who look as if they've all come from an MC5 concert. One disturbing scene shows the actors actually slaughtering a duck and a pig on camera. The ducks headless neck suirts blood as its body twitches and its wings flap. The pig struggles as its throat is slit in front of the camera. Of course, people kill pigs and fowl everyday -- it's how a lot of folks are supplied with their favorite meals. What could possibly be wrong with showing it, Godard almost seems to ask?But the radicals also, it turns out, like to literally eat the rich, too. One uncomfortable scene portrays a victim stripping naked, being killed, and then being prepared for a meal as a cook cracks two eggs over her lifeless body and then thrusts a fish into her vagina (not shown on camera). Finally, the bourgeois husband is killed and is served up with the pig meat. The wife, who seems to have accepted the militants' way of life at this point, dines on her husband's and the pig's flesh as the movie ends.Not for everyone, but some sort of remarkable milestone in cinema. Chaotic, dangerous, transgressive, and never boring.The version of WEEK END I saw was the PAL version, which featured a great transfer, nice lucid colors, and special features that included an interview with Godard cinematographer Raoul Coutard, who is actually quite humorous and likeable as he sheds light on the circumstances surrounding the making of the movie.

298145,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,6302149487,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","Weekend is an explosive and creative work by the famed Jean-Luc Godard, a story of the apocalypse framed in an Alice in Wonderland-esque format. It follows a middle-class couple as they journey among other refugees, including a man who believes himself God, an isolated barnyard, and ultimately a camp of cannibalistic hippies.I am not typically shocked by movies, but Weekend had certain elements, both thematic and visual, that were very disturbing. One of the opening scenes features the female protagonist describing a horrific sexual encounter, but with an indifferent tone juxtaposing the bizarre acts she is describing. There is also graphic footage of the killing of animals, which was effective but, in my opinion, unnecessary and cruel.Weekend is also full of intriguing and engaging philosophical and political debate. There is a memorable moment when two men, an African and an Arab, discuss the exploitation and destruction done unto their people by Western culture. This profound, and unfortunately still-relevant debate, is bookended by consistent allusions to Marx, Rousseau, and other political thinkers.Considered a cornerstone of French New Wave Cinema, Weekend is an entertaining and very thought-provoking existential look at middle-class culture and how easily one can succumb to terrible acts. Godard's film shows that there is very little separating what we call civilization and the state of nature.",4,Interesting and disturbing film from Godard,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1424,"['Weekend', 'explosive', 'creative', 'work', 'famed', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'story', 'apocalypse', 'framed', 'Alice', 'Wonderland-esque', 'format', 'middle-class', 'couple', 'journey', 'other', 'refugees', 'including', 'man', 'who', 'God', 'isolated', 'barnyard', 'ultimately', 'camp', 'cannibalistic', 'hippies.I', 'am', 'not', 'typically', 'shocked', 'movies', 'Weekend', 'had', 'certain', 'elements', 'thematic', 'visual', 'were', 'very', 'disturbing', 'One', 'opening', 'scenes', 'female', 'protagonist', 'describing', 'horrific', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'indifferent', 'tone', 'juxtaposing', 'bizarre', 'acts', 'describing', 'also', 'graphic', 'footage', 'killing', 'animals', 'was', 'effective', 'opinion', 'unnecessary', 'cruel.Weekend', 'also', 'full', 'intriguing', 'engaging', 'philosophical', 'political', 'debate', 'memorable', 'moment', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'African', 'Arab', 'discuss', 'exploitation', 'destruction', 'done', 'people', 'Western', 'culture', 'profound', 'unfortunately', 'still-relevant', 'debate', 'bookended', 'consistent', 'allusions', 'Marx', 'Rousseau', 'other', 'political', 'thinkers.Considered', 'cornerstone', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'Cinema', 'Weekend', 'entertaining', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'existential', 'look', 'middle-class', 'culture', 'how', 'easily', 'one', 'can', 'succumb', 'terrible', 'acts', 'Godard', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'separating', 'what', 'call', 'civilization', 'state', 'nature']",Weekend VHS
