It is yet another ""found footage"" film, and lord knows, I thought they had beat that horse to death, but I was wrong.  Anyway, some investigative reporters are on their way to Siberia to investigate the goings-on at a previously used psychiatric hospital.  On the way, their lead psychic encounters many visions of people that suffered horrible deaths.  Why they suffered those deaths is never explained, but I digress.I found the mood of this movie to be better than most of its genre, and the acting was very good.  The haunting score also made for a very effective mood for this movie.I enjoyed ""The Entity,"" and think you will too.

I will say that it is not incredibly fast placed, it does take a bit to get to where it was going, but in the end it did draw me in.

1640705,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B00BXKPYHK,Ron,"[1, 2]","I watched the trailer for this movie and thought it looked good so I gave it a try. The story is not new, but the plot was different enough to peak my intrest. The setting in the remote Siberian region of Russia was creepy enough for a movie in this genre, but the exterior shots of the buildings didn't fit the part for a secret Russian human testing lab/prison facility. The interior of the building fit the parameters better although it did not appear as a facility used for researching humans, (observation rooms, labs, tiled walls etc.) but more of some type of industrial fabrication facility. The movie does possess an eerie and creepy feel from its remote location and the low light settings for the scenes. The acting was decent especially for this sub genre catagory with the minor exception of the lead reporter/investigater Kate (Riley) and her scream scenes that get a little annoying. The medium Ruth (Kirwan) does a convincing job with her role as the conduit between the living and the dead. Her job is to find what really happened to the people who were found in shallow graves a short distance from the buildings. The rest of the crew was a camera operater Matt (Hill) a sound tech David (Jackson) and a Russian Yuri (Tomovic) guide/interpreter who called the investigative crew in for the investigation. I found little in all of this footage (there is some shaky cam work, but not a lot) to raise my heart rate or to make me jump at anything that was on screen. I felt a little cheated by this movie for its lack of any really scary ""jump out of my seat"" scenes. The good acting and the errie/creepy aura was not enough to raise this movie above the crowd of this overused genre. The movie has a couple of twists, but they are neither surprising or shocking because of the predictability of the story and the clues given to the viewer. People have argued as to whether or not this is a found footage movie? In the movie we are never shown any found footage (there is a Russian clip at the begining of the movie thats not mentioned by the crew) evidence so in that respect I would say no, But how could their story be told since they're never heard from after arriving near the scene? So did someone find their equipment and show their findings or was all this just a figment of our imaginations? I'm going out on a limb here and saying that YES it is THEIR found footage!!

In this film there are no women sexually abused by a ghost. Don't blame me, I didn't write it.This film takes place in remote Sadovich, Siberia, Russia.

They were contacted by Yuri (Branko Tomovic) who claims 34 people were found in a shallow grave in a remote glade. With the help of Ruth (Dervla Kirwan) a psychic, he hopes to find out what happened as the authorities will not say. A camera crew comes along. Kate (Charlotte Riley) is the reporter/director who reminded me of Sandra Bullock. Charlotte Riley is a rising star. Matt (Rupert Hill) is the camera man and David (Oliver Jackson) is the token guy who needs to grow a set. Someone has to be the first to die.Ruth is the real deal. Eleven minutes into the film you have ghosts, no waiting. The full plot, i.e. the function of the building they explore for most of the movie, is explained half way through. The movie is a mixture of found footage and regular filming with the found footage aspect not being too bad except for a poorly shot night scene.The feature starts to get numb as we see much of the same stuff, then when Kate reviews the film...BAM!
