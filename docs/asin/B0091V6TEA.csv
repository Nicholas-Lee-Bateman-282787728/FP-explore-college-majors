The message was easy for me to connect with and yet very deep--the issue of loneliness and connecting with others in the church.  This is a solid Christian movie not afraid of sharing the message of the gospel and yet a very well made movie.  I had high expectations going in and it surpassed them.The four stars are because I was disappointed with the point of tranformation in the end I felt it was not handled well for both characters and drew me out of the story; however, the final resolution drew me back in again.All in all I'd recommend it highly!",4,Surpassed My Expectations!,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,635,"['Excellent', 'movie', 'Well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'interesting', 'story', 'strong', 'message', 'message', 'was', 'easy', 'connect', 'yet', 'very', 'deep', 'issue', 'loneliness', 'connecting', 'others', 'church', 'solid', 'Christian', 'movie', 'not', 'afraid', 'sharing', 'message', 'gospel', 'yet', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'going', 'surpassed', 'them.The', 'four', 'stars', 'are', 'was', 'disappointed', 'point', 'tranformation', 'end', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'handled', 'well', 'characters', 'drew', 'story', 'however', 'final', 'resolution', 'drew', 'back', 'again.All', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'highly']",Rogue Saints

1584023,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B0091V6TEA,C. Long,"[3, 4]","The tagline for this movie is: ""The greatest church diamond heist, romance, comedy, drama, adventure you've ever seen.""  And that's about right. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you probably haven't seen a better church diamond heist movie. :)Besides being very entertaining, this movie has a lot of heart, and you get to see a transformation occur with the two lead characters as the genuine love of God's people really affects them.  Basically this is a feel-good movie with its biggest message being the importance of having (and being) a church family.  Despite largely taking place in a church, you won't hear much ""sermonizing"" or find any deep Christian conversion scenes or anything like that.  This is not a very deep movie theologically.  Because of the lack of deeper Christian content or discussions, it does at times seem like the church is just one big social club, rather than people that have been changed by Jesus and fellowship with one another because they have Jesus in common.  But if you can go into this movie thinking it is lighthearted Christian entertainment that also happens to say a few things, rather than expecting to see something super-spiritual, I think you'll be just fine.Now, with these types of independent Christian films, the question often comes down to the quality level of acting and production.  I can say that both were reasonable. I can't say ""great"" on either front, but overall was perfectly sufficient.  The acting was believable enough to not distract too much.  The movie did have a very modern, quick-paced, almost ""cartoony"" style, that grated on me a bit, but all things considered, it was fine (and kids will probably love it).This one can potentially be a good family night movie! There are some good family discussion points to be gleaned. The importance of church family and genuinely loving on people is a key one. Another related one is the need to be real and have meaningful and substantive relationships built on truth, rather than falsehood. A contrast is shown where one of the characters has 1,000 facebook friends but feels that most all of them aren't really true friends he can really depend on. There's also themes that include the futility of living life only for your own pleasure, and the importance of helping others. You could also talk about what conversion really entails as far as really turning to Jesus and explain what baptism is all about (there is a baptism scene at the end of the movie). Since there's a scene early on talking about the Trinity, you might want to take the opportunity to clarify what the Trinity is as best you can to any youngsters (God is Father, Son, Spirit - 3 personalities, 1 God.). Another discussion point could be why some people get angry at God when bad things happen (one of the characters did because of a major loss that occured earlier in his life) and how bitterness at God only hurts you. The movie does briefly raise the whole ""why are some healed when others aren't?"" question, which if you really feel you can provide a decent Biblical answer to, you might want to tackle.All in all, this movie is a fun way to spend an evening and is recommended.Reviewed by MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians dot org",4,Lighthearted Christian Entertainment - Well Done!,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,3232,"['tagline', 'movie', 'greatest', 'church', 'diamond', 'heist', 'romance', 'comedy', 'drama', 'adventure', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'about', 'right', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'say', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'better', 'church', 'diamond', 'heist', 'movie', 'being', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'get', 'see', 'transformation', 'occur', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'genuine', 'love', 'God', 'people', 'really', 'Basically', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'biggest', 'message', 'being', 'importance', 'having', 'being', 'church', 'family', 'largely', 'taking', 'place', 'church', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'much', 'sermonizing', 'find', 'deep', 'Christian', 'conversion', 'scenes', 'anything', 'not', 'very', 'deep', 'movie', 'theologically', 'lack', 'deeper', 'Christian', 'content', 'discussions', 'times', 'seem', 'church', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'social', 'club', 'rather', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'Jesus', 'fellowship', 'one', 'have', 'Jesus', 'common', 'can', 'go', 'movie', 'thinking', 'lighthearted', 'Christian', 'entertainment', 'also', 'say', 'few', 'things', 'rather', 'expecting', 'see', 'something', 'super-spiritual', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'just', 'fine.Now', 'types', 'independent', 'Christian', 'films', 'question', 'often', 'down', 'quality', 'level', 'acting', 'production', 'can', 'say', 'were', 'reasonable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', 'front', 'overall', 'was', 'perfectly', 'sufficient', 'acting', 'was', 'believable', 'enough', 'not', 'distract', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'very', 'modern', 'quick-paced', 'almost', 'cartoony', 'style', 'grated', 'bit', 'things', 'considered', 'was', 'fine', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'one', 'can', 'potentially', 'be', 'good', 'family', 'night', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'family', 'discussion', 'points', 'be', 'gleaned', 'importance', 'church', 'family', 'genuinely', 'loving', 'people', 'key', 'one', 'related', 'one', 'need', 'be', 'real', 'have', 'meaningful', 'substantive', 'relationships', 'built', 'truth', 'rather', 'falsehood', 'contrast', 'shown', 'where', 'one', 'characters', '1,000', 'facebook', 'friends', 'feels', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'true', 'friends', 'can', 'really', 'depend', 'also', 'include', 'futility', 'living', 'life', 'only', 'own', 'pleasure', 'importance', 'helping', 'others', 'could', 'also', 'talk', 'what', 'conversion', 'really', 'as', 'far', 'really', 'turning', 'Jesus', 'explain', 'what', 'baptism', 'baptism', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'scene', 'early', 'talking', 'Trinity', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'opportunity', 'clarify', 'what', 'Trinity', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'youngsters', 'God', 'Father', 'Son', 'Spirit', '3', 'personalities', '1', 'God.', 'discussion', 'point', 'could', 'be', 'why', 'people', 'get', 'angry', 'God', 'when', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'one', 'characters', 'did', 'major', 'loss', 'occured', 'earlier', 'life', 'how', 'bitterness', 'God', 'only', 'movie', 'briefly', 'raise', 'whole', 'why', 'are', 'healed', 'when', 'others', 'are', ""n't"", 'question', 'really', 'feel', 'can', 'provide', 'decent', 'Biblical', 'answer', 'might', 'want', 'tackle.All', 'movie', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'recommended.Reviewed', 'MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",Rogue Saints
