The gore is basically tomato juice on a white shirt and red nails. Don't ask? Movies like this give horror movies a bad name.

Now that I've got that out:What a terrible flick. 99% of it has no dialogue, it's just poorly filmed images that, I guess, were designed to horrify, but are more likely to make you bored out of your wits. It's 70 minutes of garbage that could have been condensed to 5 minutes of slightly more tolerable garbage, but I can only assume that this was some prissy college kid's art project that had to run for over an hour. Hopefully he flunked.",1,How dumb,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,540,"['matter', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'best', 'Sub', 'Rosa', 'release', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'out', 'What', 'terrible', 'flick', '99', '%', 'dialogue', 'just', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'images', 'guess', 'were', 'designed', 'horrify', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'make', 'bored', 'wits', '70', 'minutes', 'garbage', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'condensed', '5', 'minutes', 'slightly', 'more', 'tolerable', 'garbage', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'prissy', 'college', 'kid', 'art', 'project', 'had', 'run', 'hour', 'Hopefully', 'flunked']",Last House On Hell Street
728307,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B00007G1YE,ribcage,"[2, 2]","But otherwise just skip it. This film is nothing more than a bad art film with a whole of shots of leafless trees, and a few random shots of ducks and things like that. It kinda feels like an episode of PBS's Nature interspersed with a woman with cheap effects on her spouting endless exposition and a couple doing copule-ish things for a while.But oh man. Forget the couple. That exposition. Ok, so there's a woman. And instead of a narration we get to see her with some really bad camera effects. Discoloration and inverted colors and all that. It's like the director just found it on his camera and decided it was cool and used it. It's bad. And boring.I have no problem with indie films. Or even art films. But this comes off so bad, as if it was made by a bunch of amatuer middle schoolers.At least I had fun talking like an announcer for Nature during all those prolonged shots of leafless trees. That's really all the entertainment I got out of this movie.",1,"I guess if you don't know what constitutes a good art film, you'll think this film is good.",1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,963,"['otherwise', 'just', 'skip', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'bad', 'art', 'film', 'whole', 'shots', 'leafless', 'trees', 'few', 'random', 'shots', 'ducks', 'things', 'kinda', 'feels', 'episode', 'PBS', 'Nature', 'interspersed', 'woman', 'cheap', 'effects', 'spouting', 'endless', 'exposition', 'couple', 'doing', 'copule-ish', 'things', 'while.But', 'oh', 'man', 'Forget', 'couple', 'exposition', 'Ok', 'woman', 'instead', 'narration', 'get', 'see', 'really', 'bad', 'camera', 'effects', 'Discoloration', 'inverted', 'colors', 'director', 'just', 'found', 'camera', 'decided', 'was', 'cool', 'used', 'bad', 'boring.I', 'have', 'problem', 'indie', 'films', 'even', 'art', 'films', 'off', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'made', 'bunch', 'amatuer', 'middle', 'schoolers.At', 'least', 'had', 'fun', 'talking', 'announcer', 'Nature', 'prolonged', 'shots', 'leafless', 'trees', 'really', 'entertainment', 'got', 'out', 'movie']",Last House On Hell Street
728308,AHG7MHCFQ0QMQ,B00007G1YE,T. E. Anderson,"[0, 0]","I cannot find the right words to correctly describe just how bad this movie is.If you like movies shot on video,overdone zooms, and fake blood thats way too bright then you'll love this kindergarten outing.You might enjoy the endless shots of tree branches and the endless effect of negative photography employed through out the whole miserable mess. You might enjoy the pristine woods and the beautiful wind swept fields in the Hell Street neighborhood.All these enjoyable things that combine to make no sense at all.How they got these poor actors to spend a minute in that dilapidated old run down house is a mystery to me but it must have had something to do with extra plates of nachos and cheese from the local Missouri 7-11.Unfortunately,even the lead actress's baring of her breasts couldn't save this dime store floozy of a movie! She truly was the best part of the movie except for the fact that her costume/wardrobe was that of a 16th century virgin...It simply made no sense at all. Were she on a horse for 70 minutes and the movie retitled ""Lady Godiva Rocks the Big MO"" it would have went places.The most redeeming thing about the whole movie is when it ended.I paid a penny for this dog plus shipping. Yes. You guessed it...I paid too much!Run as far away from this movie as you can.

728309,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00007G1YE,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[0, 0]","First off there is no Hell Street. In fact there isn't a street. Kyle (Schmack Virgin) is born with a mark. Dad, who looks like a fat Jim Kramer (CNBC) kills mom because she needs to be cleansed. Afterwards she narrates almost the entire film, except those parts they opt to play some backward masking. Kyle becomes engage to Jessica (Leah Schumacher) and they go out in the meadow to search for her brother Nicholas who wouldn't be there. Jessica wears a flowers in her hair and a white dress that doesn't get grass stains. When they get near an abandoned house, Kyle, like his father decides he needs to cleanse his woman.What the film really looks like is a mentally challenged individual inherited an old farm house and a camera with filters.The camera filters and the sound was irritating, making the film impossible to watch. They were unable to shoot a plot, so a dead woman read it to you. About an hour in length. A minus star rating.Nudity (Leah Schumacher)",1,MR.
