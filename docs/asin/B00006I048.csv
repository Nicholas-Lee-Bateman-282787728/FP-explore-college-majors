716525,A88IZVHRTA0BV,B00006I048,Brandon DiSabatino,"[9, 11]","Oh how my gonadal tethers receded to the pith of my spine as I triumphantly swiped thisDvd from off of the shelf of my local record store, fervently clutching its rectangular beauty in the midst of my tumescent grasp.  Yes!  The excitement was certainly palpable as I discovered this compendium of sonic insanity, and when I impatiently cantered into my docile abode to place this disc inside my player I reluctantly seated myself in the worn khaki cushions of my fetid couch and eagerly awaited the fruition of my monetary exchange.  Well, it was worth it.  As I was only familiar with the later output of the Surfers (Electriclarryland, Independent Worm Saloon, and the compilation of early demo material in Humpty Dumpty LSD) I was concerned briefly as to whether or not I would appreciate the notorious repute of their earlier work.  Such an ignominious fool was I to ever doubt the greatness of the Butthole Surfers.  Not only was I subject to an effusive release of feral brutality and palliative noise, I was fortunate to have my ears graced by some of the most bizarre songs ever assembled into one 80-minute set.  Every single song vindicated my purchase by immeasurable exponents, and the kinetic stage behavior kept me well entertained.  Amidst my amazement, I heard for the first time such classics of unbridled insanity like &#65533;The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey&#65533;s Grave,&#65533; &#65533;Barbeque Pope,&#65533; &#65533;Psy,&#65533; and &#65533;One Hundred Million People Dead.&#65533;  The manic intensity of this disc alone would garner a five star assessment, however it was a considerable act of charity to include intermittent interviews with the boys (and gal), wherein Gibby clearly evinced just how f*cking crazy he was.  Never have I lamented over a band&#65533;s past work  (as compared to their less-than-invigorating efforts of late) than with the Surfers.  I suppose though that if they were to keep up such musical activity they would have destroyed themselves.  But I shall avoid digression by simply stating to you the facts.  This DVD is a living testament to the relevance and pertinence of the Surfers&#65533; legacy.  It demonstrates the pervasive outrageousness and absurdity that they so vehemently supported and offers a rare glimpse into a band that has since inexplicably decided to pursue more accessible material (I cite the dance-infectious Weird Revolution).  But no matter the flaccid work they decide to churn out, this piece of plangent serenity shan&#65533;t be erased.  If you appreciate wild and experimental music, music that poses an imminent threat to your sobriety; if you like music that attacks the conventions of their songs with an incomparable temerity, or if you&#65533;ve ever even held a modicum of reverence for a band that defies conception yet does not appear ostentatious, then the Butthole Surfers are definitely for you and I strongly recommend you procure a copy of this miraculous DVD.  It&#65533;s a damn shame this music won&#65533;t appeal to all of you, but it certainly deserves a fair look.

I would always seem to pick up their albums, partly due to their underground ""buzz"" and partly because I love the name.  And every time, I would basically play it once and shelve it.

So here I am now, and again finding myself purchasing a Butthole Surfers product, partly because of their reputation for legendary live shows (this being from their prime), and partly again because I like the name.  And once again, I don't get it.It just doesn't rock.  Sort of like why I never got into Sonic Youth.  The buttholes are more like a noise/joke band, and perhaps I've missed the point all along.

716528,A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,B00006I048,Gunther Haagendazs,"[13, 14]","Unfortunately I wasn't around when the Butthole Surfers has shows with 2 drummers, strobe lights, film projectors, fires, nude dancers and more.  With the Butts being one of my favorite Bands, I felt that it was essential for me to pick up a copy of this.  Now I'll admit, it was a little premature for them to releases a Video in 1985.  They only had 3 studio albums out by then.  That wasn't them in their peak. There weren't any film projectors, dancers, or fires.  If they could release a DVD of shows from 1988 than that one would blow this sucker out of the water.  But since they haven't (Yet) we all have to settle for this.  Not that it's bad or anything, but for the budget they had at the time, this thing is almost perfect.  The drums sound is unlike anything they had on the records. It stands out a lot more.  The version of Dum Dum they play here is phenomenal.  Gibby also adds another part of sorts between verse 2 and 3.  And at one part the Bassist brings out a Tuba to play on ""Something"" and Gibby switches to Bass. Between each song a reporter tries to interview the Butthole Surfers who are in a bed eating pizza and drinking beer.  Let's just say he fails miserably and is quite frustrated t some points.  It shows just how crazy Gibby is.The flaws in the show are that it was recorded during 2 different shows.  While this doesn't affect it much, it's kind of annoying for Gibbys cloths and hair style to suddenly change when the camera angle changes.  At one point his hair is up and all over the place and he has no shirt on and then he has his hair down and has a black shirt on. The first time I watched this I asked myself ""what the F***?"" Another thing is that if you pay attention then you can tell that they switched the songs out of order.  It's clear that Mark Says Alright comes before Something cause at the end of ""Mark"", The bassist brings out his tuba.  The same thing happens with the shah sleeps in lee Harvey's Grave and 100 million people dead.  At the end off ""100"" Gibby picks up the guitar he had in ""Shah"", but in the next song it disappears.  Another complaint is that The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's Grave isn't that great here, for some reason, that song among the rest looks like the most ""unprofessional"" of the bunch, maybe because it's basically improve.  You will know what I mean when you buy this.  It just doesn't look good for the first song they play.The Song list is:1. The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's Grave2. 100 Million People Dead3. Bar-be-que pope4. Cowboy Bob5. Hey6. Tornadoes7. Dum Dum8. Mexican Caravan-Gibby sings through a roll of toilet paper!!!!!9. Cherub10. Lady Sniff11. Something12. Mark Says Alright13.

We definitely have the same thoughts on this.The Surfers started out as a mediocre generic punk band and currently are a cheezy pop industrial dance type band.  In the middle (before their fall from greatness with Independent Worm Saloon) they were one of the best and most unique bands of all time.  Kind a of big s**t sandwich.  The outer 2 pieces of bread being the s**t and the inside being the good sandwich food.This is the 2nd best part of their career and I am very happy to have it on this dvd.  It was interesting and enjoyable.  However, the BHS best years were directly after this, the Locust Abortion Technician and Hairway to Steven period.This is when I saw them many times in concert and what I most want to have to remember on dvd.  Then they had a lot of screens set up and they would have all types of weird video clips playing in the background.  The sex change footages were the most memorable.  Topless women would come and dance.  And Gibby would light his hand on fire for a second and quickly put it out (as if it were some amazing trick!)However, despite prefering this era, the period they caught on this dvd is a very good era as well.  It is before I learned about them so I was not familiar with their shows of this time.They have 2 drummers.  There is not the twisted elaborate stageshow I was used to but the members do have plenty of antics.  They also utilize a massive tuba, a horn or saxophone (I forgot as I didn't view this recently) and a megaphone.They also have interviews where Gibby just goes off on nonsensical drug induced stories.It is overall a very entertaining dvd and makes me wish I had learned of the BHS a couple of years earlier.",4,When the Surfers were good but not at their best.,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1746,"['post', 'Erik', 'Denning', 'pretty', 'sums', 'up', 'what', 'want', 'say', 'definitely', 'have', 'same', 'thoughts', 'this.The', 'Surfers', 'started', 'out', 'mediocre', 'generic', 'punk', 'band', 'currently', 'are', 'cheezy', 'pop', 'industrial', 'dance', 'type', 'band', 'middle', 'fall', 'greatness', 'Independent', 'Worm', 'Saloon', 'were', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'unique', 'bands', 'time', 'Kind', 'big', 's**t', 'sandwich', 'outer', '2', 'pieces', 'bread', 'being', 's**t', 'inside', 'being', 'good', 'sandwich', 'food.This', '2nd', 'best', 'part', 'career', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'have', 'dvd', 'was', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'However', 'BHS', 'best', 'years', 'were', 'directly', 'Locust', 'Abortion', 'Technician', 'Hairway', 'Steven', 'period.This', 'when', 'saw', 'many', 'times', 'concert', 'what', 'most', 'want', 'have', 'remember', 'dvd', 'Then', 'had', 'lot', 'screens', 'set', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'types', 'weird', 'video', 'clips', 'playing', 'background', 'sex', 'change', 'footages', 'were', 'most', 'memorable', 'Topless', 'women', 'would', 'come', 'dance', 'Gibby', 'would', 'light', 'hand', 'fire', 'second', 'quickly', 'put', 'out', 'were', 'amazing', 'trick', 'However', 'prefering', 'era', 'period', 'caught', 'dvd', 'very', 'good', 'era', 'as', 'well', 'learned', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'shows', 'time.They', 'have', '2', 'drummers', 'not', 'twisted', 'elaborate', 'stageshow', 'was', 'used', 'members', 'do', 'have', 'plenty', 'antics', 'also', 'utilize', 'massive', 'tuba', 'horn', 'saxophone', 'forgot', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'recently', 'megaphone.They', 'also', 'have', 'interviews', 'where', 'Gibby', 'just', 'off', 'nonsensical', 'drug', 'induced', 'stories.It', 'overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'dvd', 'wish', 'had', 'learned', 'BHS', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier']",N/A

Great concert footage (though nothing of them at their wildest, alas). Amazing small venue stuff with double drumming. Paul Leary looks absolutely evil when he plays and Gibby looks like something that shambled out of lunatic asylum. Fantastic, hypnotic songs (of course).The interviews in between are hilarious. Mostly, Gibby (clearly drugged out of his mind) rambling nonsensically while the others eat pizza and look bored. That poor interviewer. It's amazing to me the cheesey bands that flower and get hugely successful, stadium-selling careers, while the Surfers, one of the most innovative, brilliant bands of all time, remain locked into playing smaller gigs. NO ONE argues that they are geniuses. I think its just a matter of accessability. They may have been too brilliant, too far ahead of their time. No matter. Time reveals all.Possibly the strangest part of this DVD is the (extraordinarily brief) clip of an early, early Surfers gig. We see an astonishingly clean-cut, handsome, well-spoken, and flustered Gibby pleading politely with a crowd to please stop throwing things at the band. Wow.

The B-hole Surfers recorded their February 22nd and March 3rd 1985 live shows at TRAXX club in Detroit, Michigan, and edited the footage together (with more than just a bit of mischief) to create this pretty unique live DVD. Gibby appears at the beginning, naked in the snow but for a loin cloth that has a ppppp drawn on it. Nice. He also appears throughout the movie, ranting and raving between songs, usually in bed with the rest of the band but sometimes also as a young short-haired aspiring musician pleading with the audience, telling bad surreal jokes and spouting bloody nonsense that is often quite inspired. Hey - that's Gibby! He blathers, the band eats pizza, smokes joints, trades cigarettes, comments on the wall posters, coughs, slobbers, drools - it's like something out of an R Crumb motif. An example of one of these monologues is:""Thousands of the people that came before me that are descendants of me who had originally been here... there were thousands of people, all down the line to where there were worms, and there were flatworms, and Chinese men who were tied to walls would show worm movies out of their ppppppp into the air in apparent disgruntlement and dismay and it would be wadded up like a little girl would wad up some tissue after she's blown her nose into, and look in it and the horror of seeing little speckled pieces of blood in her snot, it was on that rag that she had wadded up and threw away, knowing that that was her life in there, and that her life would never be the same, because the world was divided up into four parts, there was the Maggots, the Tutor, the Fancor and the Durea, and the Durea and the Fancor were at war with the Tutor and the Farcols, who I haven't mentioned to this point, because they were the fifth part, they were invisible and they were all-powerful, and they were beyond the worms and beyond the Chinese men tied to the wall, who would show worm movies out of their ppppppp, and who had originally been non-existent at all and they never knew how to make fireworks, or ever rifles, or even - they didn't know anyone from Saskatchewan and they didn't know how to dial the telephone, and they had these Volkswagen buses that they had designed like they were cathedrals of God, and they had directed all of us, all of my relatives - the worms and the Chinese men themselves, they had travelled hundreds of thousands of miles. When they came they had the sea, they went under the sea and talked to the fish, and see, when the fish travel in a line there will be a little dot near their rear ends and a string will come out and I have made a kite before and I have flown it out of the string that I got from the dots on fishes bottom ends, and I have flown it so high that I have been able to see the Etruscans, the Bolivians, the Artesians, and the Wallhonkers.""The set starts off with ""The Shah Sleeps In Lee Harvey's Grave"", sung/shouted by Paul, with lots of groovy noise (Gibby's playing guitar). Paul does a great job playing bass and screaming, especially at the end when he's shouting ""Shut up... shut up."" ""One Hundred Million People Dead"" does not appear on any of their albums, it's a nutty piece of putty. Theresa Nervosa and King Coffey are going nuts on the drums, Paul Leary is dancing around in his black turtleneck, Canadian bassist Trevor Malcolm is bopping away in his white three piece suit and shades and thick sideswept blonde haircut, Gibby is confused in his white open chested shirt and bra as he howls with the Gibbitronics and destroys a pillow, it's a fun and funky song (they also mess around and show footage from another show within the same song, people are seen wearing different clothes - Malcolm's suit turns form white to black, etc - this happens all throughout the DVD). In ""Bar-be-que Pope"", a bra-wearing Gibby is playing sax, Paul is doing the ""singing"". Nutty! ""Cowboy Bob"" is nutty and cool, Gibby has Leningrad Cowboy hair, Paul howls like a demon possessed. The same shot of Trevor's head is recycled over and over, at least once per song (probably to see if you're paying attention, maybe to make fun of Trevor, who's Canadian and deserves to be made fun of [as conventional logic seems to go]). You get snippets of clippets from the live show. ""Hey"" is nutty grooviness with Paul sweaty in a blue t-shirt, the audience going nuts, Gibby in a toga. ""Tornadoes"" has Gibby performing in his boxers, great stand-up drumming from Theresa and King. Before ""Mexican Caravan"", there's a scene of a young Gibby stark naked leaving the stage ( you only get to see his back side). In ""Mexican Caravan"" he's unspooling a roll of toilet paper (and singing through the tube). Cool. ""Cherub"" is full of nutty feedback, basslines, drumming, horns, bullhorn rantings. This has to be the B-holes' best song from their first few albums. ""Lady Sniff"" is one of the most chaotic B-holes albums, and this version is no less so, ha ha. It's followed by a young Gibby on the bass talking to the audience between songs to stop pulling down his pants. ""Something"" picks up with Trevor Malcolm coming out with a giant white tuba, Gibby on bass, Paul doing his nutty slide guitar thing on a weird purple-striped guitar, and off they go! Paul handles the screaming vocals and minimal guitar. Great drum noise. In between songs there's another scene in bed where the band does a weird ""LSD"" sound collage, making this nearly the only time King Coffey or Paul Leary speaks up; this quickly becomes a choral of ""Blow The Man Down"". ""Mark Says Alright"" is cool groovy bass-driven boogying that is full of obscene guitar sound effects, Gibby donning a second guitar, spooky images floating in the air, bouncers fending off rowdy audience members, other insanity. The band launches into a proto-jam for ""PSY"", probably my favorite B-hole Surfers song of them all, but this one doesn't really get very far - it's 12 minutes long on the 1991 release Pioughed, but here it's only nine minutes long (about the same length as other live CDs, including The Whole Truth and Nothing Butt).The DVD also contains some bonuses that you can't get on YouTube - B-hole Karaoke, which is several of the live songs with subtitles (I might watch it all some day), and a series of pictures (band pics, naked clown line drawings, concert posters, etc). The music playing over the slideshow is the lost 5' single of ""American Woman"". Cool.- A lot of things that can be said about time can be said about motion.- A lot of things that can be said about something can be said about something else.",5,Never again - NEVER
