892407,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0007WFXK8,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[28, 28]","Prior to this, I tried various bellydance videos, but I failed to find one I liked--some were way beyond my level as a beginner, whereas others, while fun, didn't provide much of a workout.  Happily, Rania's My Personal Trainer seems to be the perfect fit for me.The idea behind this DVD is that you have a wide variety of bellydance segments to choose from; this allows you to create a customized plan OR to follow one of the seven plans already programmed into the DVD.  The pre-programmed plans are Sleek in a Week, and intense 7-day shape-up plan; Intense Legs and Buns; Intense Abs; Time Saver, with each workout being 40 minutes or less; Fit It In, where workouts are split throughout the day; Take It Easy, a series of light 10-20 minute workouts; and Maintainence, mostly shorter workouts for those who have already reached their fitness goals.As far as the workouts themselves went, I found them to be enjoyable, intense, and very doable despite my limited prior bellydance experience.  The cardio segment is about 30 minutes long, and it appears to be compiled from Rania's previous videos, as there are different section featuring Rania and class in different outfits.  Also, the varying sections don't really blend together all that well--rather, each one jumps right in--making it a little difficult to follow along at first, but I was able to manage.  After a 5-minute warm-up, the first 6-minute cardio section is not very intense.  Section #2 is more fun and well as more work (5 minutes), and then third section is even more intense, with lots of shimmies and circles plus some mini hops and jumps (6 minutes).  In the final segment, you do some combination moves (6 minutes), and there is a nice 3-minute stretch to end the cardio work.The eight toning segments are all taught by Rania alone in the studio, and each are 10 minutes in length.  Legs & Butt 1 had plenty of shimmies, tucks, and simple leg moves (kicks, hip drops, etc.), and it felt like further cardio workout.  Legs & Butt 2 was more toning-oriented, beginning with plies and squats, going on to a brief leg lift section using a chair, and ending with work from an all-fours position.  The Arms segment would have more appropriately been called ""shoulders,"" as my shoulders were definitely burning during this one!  Here you will do shoulder rolls and isolations plus various arms and hands movements, including snake arms, lotus hands, and veronica hands; shoulder shimmies finish the segment.  The Hips & Waist segment was another that felt like additional cardio work to me, as you do a lot of movement with hip circles, figure 8s, and front and back movements.  Chest & Back features chest isolations, circles, and figure 8s with leg movement added in. In the first Abs segment, you begin with standing contractions and abdominal rolls, then move on to a series of seated crunches and additional rolls in a balance position.  Abs 2 has some brief standing contractions to start, but then you move to the floor for a straight-leg crunch series which was particularly tough on the lower abs (actually, both abs segments were quite challenging!).  Finally, Rania includes a great Flexibility Training program:  she starts with plies and standing stretches, moves on to dynamic yoga moves such as cobra to down dog and cat to cow, and performs a variety of floor stretches as well; although quick, I found this to be very effective.If all of the above wasn't enough, the DVD includes plenty of bonus features as well.  First of all, there is a video library of bellydance moves; you can use this clips from other workouts to fine-tune your execution of individual bellydance movements.  Secondly, there is a feature performance by Rania, a workout without narration option (this is available for each individual segment as well), plus a photo gallery and trailers from other videos.  Finally, there are brief on-screen explanations of the benefits of bellydance, instructions on monitoring your heart rate, and eating and exercise tips.This is my first video by Rania, and I really liked her easygoing instructional style combined with her excellent dancing.  Those who have tried her other videos may find some of the segments here to be familiar, but it was all new to me.  I love that this DVD provides me with so many different options, and I know that I will use it often.

They help with learning the moves, and are a great way to practice technique and stay in shape.  Overall, Rania is a good instructor, although she can get a vapid, goofy look sometimes.  It in no way affects her instruction though.  The only part of the dvd I don't like is the Bellydance Cardio segment.  There is no instruction at all for this part, and this is the part where it is really apparent that she just cut a bunch of her videos together.  However, if you can learn it, or if you have her previous videos, it is a nice compilation of moves.  I would recommend this for beginners to experienced dancers.  The library of dance moves is especially helpful if you can't get a step right. I'm glad I purchased this dvd, and will be buying more of Rania's dvds in the future.

892409,A3IKFQC64SS4WO,B0007WFXK8,mcel,"[5, 5]","I finally purchased this DVD after debating a little. I own all of Rania's Bellydance for Fitness DVDs but I got bored with them after awhile and preferred Suhaila's teaching style more. I saw this and even though many said it was a rehash of her previous workouts, I wanted to try it anyway for the Personal Trainer aspect. I have to say that I'm in day 6 of her ""Sleek In a Week"" program and I can see and feel the difference!! I would by this DVD just for the Sleek in a Week program. My clothes are already a little looser. I must admit that I've been using the Sleek in a Week program with proper diet as well but for 6 days, the results are amazing! The whole series is very enjoyable, but I have to admit the cardio segment is a little repetitous (you do it about 3-4 times a week) but the more I did it, I found the better I got at it, which is good since some of it can move quickly. There are also several mini workouts for the time crunched (and yes, most of them were on Rania's previous DVDs) but I like the fact that you are given a specific order in which to do in each series, since I'm always wondering when using a workout DVD that is sectioned off: ""What do I do today?"" This DVD takes all the guesswork out of what kind of training to do. All this time, I've been doing weight training DVDs and not burning enough fat, and this disc was the solution to that! Note: There is hardly any bellydance instructions going on here, so if you are looking to learn how to bellydance, order one of Rania's instructional videos. But if you are looking to feel better, get fit, work muscles you never knew you had and not dread working out, then this one's for you.",5,I'm a believer--this works (and it's fun!),1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,1672,"['finally', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'debating', 'little', 'own', 'Rania', 'Bellydance', 'Fitness', 'DVDs', 'got', 'bored', 'awhile', 'preferred', 'Suhaila', 'teaching', 'style', 'more', 'saw', 'even', 'many', 'said', 'was', 'rehash', 'previous', 'workouts', 'wanted', 'try', 'anyway', 'Personal', 'Trainer', 'aspect', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'day', '6', 'Sleek', 'Week', 'program', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'difference', 'would', 'DVD', 'just', 'Sleek', 'Week', 'program', 'clothes', 'are', 'already', 'little', 'looser', 'must', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'Sleek', 'Week', 'program', 'proper', 'diet', 'well', '6', 'days', 'results', 'are', 'amazing', 'whole', 'series', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'admit', 'cardio', 'segment', 'little', 'repetitous', 'do', '3-4', 'times', 'week', 'more', 'did', 'found', 'better', 'got', 'good', 'can', 'move', 'quickly', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'mini', 'workouts', 'time', 'crunched', 'yes', 'most', 'were', 'Rania', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'like', 'fact', 'are', 'given', 'specific', 'order', 'do', 'series', ""'m"", 'always', 'wondering', 'when', 'using', 'workout', 'DVD', 'sectioned', 'off', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'today', 'DVD', 'guesswork', 'what', 'kind', 'training', 'do', 'All', 'time', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'weight', 'training', 'DVDs', 'not', 'burning', 'enough', 'fat', 'disc', 'was', 'solution', 'Note', 'hardly', 'bellydance', 'instructions', 'going', 'here', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'learn', 'how', 'bellydance', 'order', 'one', 'Rania', 'instructional', 'videos', 'are', 'looking', 'feel', 'better', 'get', 'fit', 'work', 'muscles', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'not', 'dread', 'working', 'out', 'then', 'one']",N/A

892411,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0007WFXK8,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[12, 12]","If you are at the point where you enjoy Bellydancing every day or most days of the week, then this is a great solution and will give you lots of variety in your workouts. This is a detailed DVD with lots of sections. The first section is a place where you can decide which type of exercise routine you wish to enjoy OR you can make up your own by choosing a number of exercises one after the other. Here is what this DVD offers:Sleek in a Week - this selection takes you to another pagewhere you can then select a day of the week.Intense Legs & BunsIntense AbsTime SaverFit it InTake It EasyMaintenance PlanThese are all combinations of the customized routines. You may recognize some of the cardio from former Raina DVDs. In fact, it is intriguing to discover how relaxed and comfortable she is on camera as compared to when she was very poised and tense at the start. Now she has fully relaxed into herself and the new exercises are even more sexy and relaxing than before.Customize Your Bellydance Workout:30 minutes Bellydance Cardio10 minutes each: Flexibility Training, Arms, Legs & Butt 1, Legs & Butt 2, Hips & Waist, Chest & Back, Abs 1, Abs 2.The Abs 1 section is worth the purchase of this DVD. It will give you a full Abs workout and I prefer it to Abs 2  from a previous video. This is a mixture of old and new with an emphasis on what really works.The 30 minutes of Bellydance Cardio lacks continuity on its own and you may enjoy it more if you already learned these moves in previous DVS. They will mostly appeal to intermediate to advanced bellydancers and anyone who wants to enjoy Jazz, Electronica and Caribbean music all in one day. The exercises and costumes change frequently so you are never bored.Video Library of Bellydance moves: Shoulder Shimmy, Snake Arms, Hip Shimmy, Hop & Drop, Tut Walk, Chest Drop, Horizontal Figure 8, Vertical Figure 8, Basic Turn and Camel.Some of the unique moves on this DVD are the Cleopatra Stretch and the ways in which Raina moves across the floor while doing the exercises. The Arms workout is intense and creative. Egyptian Shimmies and challenging footwork keep you working and the hip movements are very active and soothing. This DVD is exciting for intermediate and advanced bellydancers because it takes you from folkloric to sexy all in one DVD. There is so much to choose from and there are programs for the week so all you have to do is find out which level you want to exercise at and then select the day of the week.If you have been following the Raina program then this DVD will feel like a reward for all your hard work. If you are new to Raina, this might seem a little confusing and I'd suggest you start with her main DVDs first unless you want everything in one package deal. By starting with her instructional DVDs, you can learn the moves and then really enjoy this series of exercises. I will agree with everyone else who said they felt these exercises! The dancers are talented, elegant and all have beautiful spirits.~The Rebecca Review",5,Design Your Own Bellydance Routine,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,3016,"['are', 'point', 'where', 'enjoy', 'Bellydancing', 'day', 'most', 'days', 'week', 'then', 'great', 'solution', 'will', 'give', 'lots', 'variety', 'workouts', 'detailed', 'DVD', 'lots', 'sections', 'first', 'section', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'decide', 'type', 'exercise', 'routine', 'wish', 'enjoy', 'OR', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'choosing', 'number', 'exercises', 'one', 'other', 'Here', 'what', 'offers', 'Sleek', 'Week', 'selection', 'pagewhere', 'can', 'then', 'select', 'day', 'week.Intense', 'Legs', 'BunsIntense', 'AbsTime', 'SaverFit', 'InTake', 'EasyMaintenance', 'PlanThese', 'are', 'combinations', 'customized', 'routines', 'may', 'recognize', 'cardio', 'former', 'Raina', 'DVDs', 'fact', 'intriguing', 'discover', 'how', 'relaxed', 'comfortable', 'camera', 'compared', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'poised', 'tense', 'start', 'Now', 'fully', 'relaxed', 'new', 'exercises', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'sexy', 'relaxing', 'before.Customize', 'Your', 'Bellydance', 'Workout:30', 'minutes', 'Bellydance', 'Cardio10', 'minutes', 'Flexibility', 'Training', 'Arms', 'Legs', 'Butt', '1', 'Legs', 'Butt', '2', 'Hips', 'Waist', 'Chest', 'Back', 'Abs', '1', 'Abs', '2.The', 'Abs', '1', 'section', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'will', 'give', 'full', 'Abs', 'workout', 'prefer', 'Abs', '2', 'previous', 'video', 'mixture', 'old', 'new', 'emphasis', 'what', 'really', 'works.The', '30', 'minutes', 'Bellydance', 'Cardio', 'continuity', 'own', 'may', 'enjoy', 'more', 'already', 'learned', 'moves', 'previous', 'DVS', 'will', 'mostly', 'appeal', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'bellydancers', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Jazz', 'Electronica', 'Caribbean', 'music', 'one', 'day', 'exercises', 'costumes', 'change', 'frequently', 'are', 'never', 'bored.Video', 'Library', 'Bellydance', 'moves', 'Shoulder', 'Shimmy', 'Snake', 'Arms', 'Hip', 'Shimmy', 'Hop', 'Drop', 'Tut', 'Walk', 'Chest', 'Drop', 'Horizontal', 'Figure', '8', 'Vertical', 'Figure', '8', 'Basic', 'Turn', 'Camel.Some', 'unique', 'moves', 'DVD', 'are', 'Cleopatra', 'Stretch', 'ways', 'Raina', 'floor', 'doing', 'exercises', 'Arms', 'workout', 'intense', 'creative', 'Egyptian', 'Shimmies', 'challenging', 'footwork', 'keep', 'working', 'hip', 'movements', 'are', 'very', 'active', 'soothing', 'DVD', 'exciting', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'bellydancers', 'folkloric', 'sexy', 'one', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'choose', 'are', 'programs', 'week', 'so', 'all', 'have', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'level', 'want', 'exercise', 'then', 'select', 'day', 'week.If', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'Raina', 'program', 'then', 'DVD', 'will', 'feel', 'reward', 'hard', 'work', 'are', 'new', 'Raina', 'might', 'seem', 'little', 'confusing', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'start', 'main', 'DVDs', 'first', 'want', 'everything', 'one', 'package', 'deal', 'starting', 'instructional', 'DVDs', 'can', 'learn', 'moves', 'then', 'really', 'enjoy', 'series', 'exercises', 'will', 'agree', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'said', 'felt', 'exercises', 'dancers', 'are', 'talented', 'elegant', 'have', 'beautiful', 'spirits.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

However, Rania has eliminated the slower-paced, more monotonous segments of those earlier DVD workouts; here she includes only the more challenging, faster-paced segments. She has also added in some new drill segments with a stronger focus on specific areas of the body.Intermediate and advanced dancers who liked the solid cardio format of Rania's old DVD's- but who found that they were not challenging enough-will enjoy working out with this new DVD. You will also be delighted to find that the DVD provides a huge number of choices for varying your daily workout. You can choose one of seven daily 30-minute workouts, or you can add or subtract segments to make longer and shorter workouts.I would definitely NOT recommend this DVD for beginners because of the  fast pacing of the workouts, the intensity of the movements, and the lack of break-down and instruction for the individual steps. Beginners should try Rania's Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss series first. While those DVD's are not primarily instructional in nature, they do provide some breakdown of steps.In her first set of DVD's, Rania used the classic layering approach of teaching the basic step, then adding on the hips and/or arms so that you don't have to try and master everything at once. This classic approach is used by dance instructors everywhere and-aside from doing monotonous drills of basic movements-there is really no other way to maintain an aerobic pace while learning and practicing a new step. Most students prefer this technique, because they want to experience the sensation of ""dancing"" rather than just repeating steps.If you are looking for more thorough teaching of the basic steps, you should try one of the many bellydance instructional videos on the market. There are many high-quality DVD's created by instructors such as Jillina. It is also important to remember that there is no substitute for taking classes with a competent dance teacher.If your interest in bellydance goes beyond just ""having fun,"" if you think you may want to perform some day, and/or if you are concerned about avoiding injury, you should supplement your home workouts with lessons from a qualified teacher.",4,A real bargain for those seeking a varied and challenging bellydance workout,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2344,"['Initially', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'DVD', 'many', 'segments', 'DVD', 'Rania', 'original', '4-part', 'Bellydance', 'Fitness', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Series', 'However', 'Rania', 'eliminated', 'slower-paced', 'more', 'monotonous', 'segments', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'workouts', 'here', 'only', 'more', 'challenging', 'faster-paced', 'segments', 'also', 'added', 'new', 'drill', 'segments', 'stronger', 'focus', 'specific', 'areas', 'body.Intermediate', 'advanced', 'dancers', 'who', 'liked', 'solid', 'cardio', 'format', 'Rania', 'old', ""DVD's-"", 'who', 'found', 'were', 'not', 'challenging', 'enough-will', 'enjoy', 'working', 'out', 'new', 'DVD', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'delighted', 'find', 'DVD', 'huge', 'number', 'choices', 'varying', 'daily', 'workout', 'can', 'choose', 'one', 'seven', 'daily', '30-minute', 'workouts', 'can', 'add', 'subtract', 'segments', 'make', 'longer', 'shorter', 'workouts.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'fast', 'pacing', 'workouts', 'intensity', 'movements', 'lack', 'break-down', 'instruction', 'individual', 'steps', 'Beginners', 'should', 'try', 'Rania', 'Bellydance', 'Fitness', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'series', 'first', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'primarily', 'instructional', 'nature', 'do', 'provide', 'breakdown', 'steps.In', 'first', 'set', 'DVD', 'Rania', 'used', 'classic', 'layering', 'approach', 'teaching', 'basic', 'step', 'then', 'adding', 'hips', 'and/or', 'arms', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'try', 'master', 'everything', 'once', 'classic', 'approach', 'used', 'dance', 'instructors', 'everywhere', 'and-aside', 'doing', 'monotonous', 'drills', 'basic', 'movements-there', 'really', 'other', 'way', 'maintain', 'aerobic', 'pace', 'learning', 'practicing', 'new', 'step', 'Most', 'students', 'prefer', 'technique', 'want', 'experience', 'sensation', 'dancing', 'rather', 'just', 'repeating', 'steps.If', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'thorough', 'teaching', 'basic', 'steps', 'should', 'try', 'one', 'many', 'bellydance', 'instructional', 'videos', 'market', 'are', 'many', 'high-quality', 'DVD', 'created', 'instructors', 'such', 'Jillina', 'also', 'important', 'remember', 'substitute', 'taking', 'classes', 'competent', 'dance', 'interest', 'bellydance', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'think', 'may', 'want', 'perform', 'day', 'and/or', 'are', 'concerned', 'avoiding', 'injury', 'should', 'supplement', 'home', 'workouts', 'lessons', 'qualified', 'teacher']",N/A

892415,A3IFE0G5K9QWT6,B0007WFXK8,Willowdancer,"[1, 1]","I purchased this dvd for only $2.10 and feel it was money well spent. my only complaint is that the cardio really is that bad; I am sure the individual workouts that the cardio segments were derived from were good, but since only clips are taken from each workout there is no explanation of the moves, many of which are often poorly cued. If other people, like me, practice dancing in front of a mirror cues are very vital to keeping up with the workout. This leads me to my second point; while the cardio leaves much to be desired, there is still an abundance of effective workouts on this dvd, but none of them go very much into technique. This dvd is intended to work you out, not to make you a better dancer. If you are looking for technique and drills, I suggest anything by michelle joyce and Arelia's contemporary bellydance dvd. However, if *like me* you are wanting something to get your heart rate up and give ou an effective workout alternative to other cardio and strength training exercises, this dvd is great. Also, I am finding that the combinations used in this dvd give me a great opportunity to apply the technique I have been practicing to a faster tempo. I wouldn't suggest this for someone who is wanting to learn how to belly dance, and if you really couldn't care less about your technique and just want to have a fun workout, then I would suggest this for you, especially for the low price I got it for.",4,not for technique,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,1427,"['purchased', 'dvd', 'only', '2.10', 'feel', 'was', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'only', 'complaint', 'cardio', 'really', 'bad', 'am', 'sure', 'individual', 'cardio', 'segments', 'were', 'derived', 'were', 'good', 'only', 'clips', 'are', 'taken', 'workout', 'explanation', 'moves', 'many', 'are', 'often', 'poorly', 'cued', 'other', 'people', 'practice', 'dancing', 'front', 'mirror', 'cues', 'are', 'very', 'vital', 'keeping', 'up', 'workout', 'second', 'point', 'cardio', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'still', 'abundance', 'effective', 'workouts', 'dvd', 'none', 'go', 'very', 'much', 'technique', 'dvd', 'intended', 'work', 'out', 'not', 'make', 'better', 'dancer', 'are', 'looking', 'technique', 'drills', 'suggest', 'anything', 'michelle', 'joyce', 'Arelia', 'contemporary', 'bellydance', 'dvd', 'However', '*like', 'me*', 'are', 'wanting', 'something', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'give', 'ou', 'effective', 'workout', 'alternative', 'other', 'cardio', 'strength', 'training', 'exercises', 'dvd', 'great', 'Also', 'am', 'finding', 'combinations', 'used', 'dvd', 'give', 'great', 'opportunity', 'apply', 'technique', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'faster', 'tempo', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'someone', 'who', 'wanting', 'learn', 'how', 'belly', 'dance', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'technique', 'just', 'want', 'have', 'fun', 'workout', 'then', 'would', 'suggest', 'especially', 'low', 'price', 'got']",N/A
