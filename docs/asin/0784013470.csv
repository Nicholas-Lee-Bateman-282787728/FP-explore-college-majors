77586,A1NEO06KPX4VCC,0784013470,ADM,"[3, 5]","This film has its share of scary moments, and some excellent acting by almost all of the large cast.The movie is about what happens when Kevin  Bacon's character suddenly becomes &quot;open&quot; to the supernatural  elements that surround him. He struggles to make sense of them, and in the  meantime feels as though he is receiving clues to a puzzle.In addition  to the basic &quot;thriller&quot; premise, I like that director David Koepp  takes time to establish relationships between the characters. For example,  Bacon's character's relationship with his wife is clearly portrayed, and as  a viewer, you understand why those characters behave the way they  do.Koepps's pacing of the unfolding plot is also well-done. He manages  to keep you engaged in the story while still imparting a lot of information  through dialogue, and the breaks between &quot;scary parts&quot; give you a  chance to catch your breath, and re-connect with the characters.The  movie pays homage to a ton of great thrillers -- The Shining, and Close  Encounters, most notably -- and Koepp acknowledges Brian De Palma's help  and influence on this film.One scene that stands out in the film is the  scene in which Bacon's character (Tom) is first hypnotized. Hypnosis scenes  have been done to death in movies, so it was nice to see such an original  take on it in the film. Instead of showing the cliche of the hypnotist  staring into the camera, dangling a pendulum, Koepp decides to show his  audience exactly what Tom is visualizing as he listens to the hypnotist.  The result is that you see all the odd things that follow from Tom's  perspective.This has two beneficial functions: First, there is real  entertainment value in watching someone get hypnotized &quot;from the  inside out.&quot; Second, it helps you sympathize with Tom, who is the  film's protagonist, and an occasionally otherwise unsympathetic  character.Since this is a DVD review, I'll briefly comment on  DVD-specific aspects of the video release. The video is usually clear, but  sometimes grainy in the darker scenes. The audio mix is fine. Extras  include a scene-specific commentary by director David Koepp. The commentary  is usually interesting and insightful, and only occasionally cloying. He  describes how he shot several scenes, why he made certain story decisions,  and what it was like to work with some of the actors.So, all in all, if  you like Kevin Bacon, or think you would like to see a scarier version of  the Sixth Sense, you will probably like this movie.",4,"Scarier Than Sixth Sense, and Well-Acted",966124800,"08 13, 2000",2000,2530,"['film', 'share', 'scary', 'moments', 'excellent', 'acting', 'almost', 'large', 'cast.The', 'movie', 'what', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'suddenly', 'quot', 'open', 'quot', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'surround', 'make', 'sense', 'meantime', 'feels', 'receiving', 'clues', 'puzzle.In', 'addition', 'basic', 'quot', 'quot', 'premise', 'like', 'director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'time', 'establish', 'relationships', 'characters', 'example', 'Bacon', 'character', 'relationship', 'wife', 'clearly', 'portrayed', 'viewer', 'understand', 'why', 'characters', 'behave', 'way', 'do.Koepps', 'pacing', 'unfolding', 'plot', 'also', 'well-done', 'keep', 'engaged', 'story', 'still', 'imparting', 'lot', 'information', 'dialogue', 'breaks', 'quot', 'scary', 'parts', 'quot', 'give', 'chance', 'catch', 'breath', 're-connect', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'homage', 'ton', 'great', 'thrillers', 'Shining', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'most', 'notably', 'Koepp', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'help', 'influence', 'film.One', 'scene', 'out', 'film', 'scene', 'Bacon', 'character', 'Tom', 'first', 'hypnotized', 'Hypnosis', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'movies', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'such', 'original', 'take', 'film', 'Instead', 'showing', 'cliche', 'hypnotist', 'staring', 'camera', 'dangling', 'pendulum', 'Koepp', 'show', 'audience', 'exactly', 'what', 'Tom', 'visualizing', 'hypnotist', 'result', 'see', 'odd', 'things', 'follow', 'Tom', 'perspective.This', 'two', 'beneficial', 'functions', 'First', 'real', 'entertainment', 'value', 'watching', 'someone', 'get', 'hypnotized', 'quot', 'inside', 'out.', 'quot', 'Second', 'sympathize', 'Tom', 'who', 'film', 'protagonist', 'occasionally', 'otherwise', 'unsympathetic', 'character.Since', 'DVD', 'review', ""'ll"", 'briefly', 'comment', 'DVD-specific', 'aspects', 'video', 'release', 'video', 'usually', 'clear', 'sometimes', 'grainy', 'darker', 'scenes', 'audio', 'mix', 'fine', 'Extras', 'include', 'scene-specific', 'commentary', 'director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'commentary', 'usually', 'interesting', 'insightful', 'only', 'occasionally', 'cloying', 'how', 'shot', 'several', 'scenes', 'why', 'made', 'certain', 'story', 'decisions', 'what', 'was', 'work', 'actors.So', 'like', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'scarier', 'version', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'will', 'probably', 'movie']",Stir Of Echoes

The unfortunate timing that had Sense opening first seemed to push this movie off to the side.  That is a terrible shame, because this movie is as  good as any around.  Comparing Echoes to Sense is like comparing DaVinci to  Michealangelo.  Both are great in their own distinct ways.The story of  an ordinary working class guy (Kevin Bacon) living in his version of a  safe, ideal neighborhood whose world is throw out of whack when he is  hypnotized by his ditzy sister-in-law (the always good Illeana Douglas).  When he starts to experience strange things, it turns his and his family's  world upside down.  It would be a shame to say more and possibly spoil the  suspenseful plot, but the twists and turns this tale takes are wonderful.This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and give you a good  half-dozen or so jump out of your skin scares.  Well acted (Bacon and  Douglas are the &quot;big&quot; names, but Kathryn Erbe, Kevin Dunn, AJ Oto  lead a great supporting cast, and Zachary David Cope does an amazing job as  Bacon's son) and written, this movie should have been a much bigger hit.

77591,A2QGM63A8ZNSFG,0784013470,"Alex Kalb ""akalb@clarku.edu""","[1, 3]","Stir of Echoes, based on the book by Richard Matheson, was overlooked when it first came out in 1999.  It was released within two weeks of the similar, and much better, Sixth Sense, so anyone that saw this around that time inevitably thought little of it. Interestingly, this story of Tom Wallace, a man who during a hypnotism session during a party with his new-age sister-in-law develops psychic powers.  Besides being able to predict the future, he also sees a ghost from the past that has a mystery for him to solve.  Incidentally, his son starts to exhibit some of the same powers and his wife becomes thoroughly alienated. This movie is at once simpler and tighter that the source material.  While the movie does not linger on the thoughts that Wallace is bombarded by like Matheson did in the novel, the movie is much more driven and suspenseful around the murder mystery. The players in this movie are very good, with a surprisingly strong performance from Kevin Bacon.  The directing is good and suspensful, and while this movie doesn't live up to the level of the Sixth Sense, it is much better than most of the horror/suspense movies that come out these days (can anyone say, The Haunting). The DVD presentation is very strong with clear, widescreen video and the sound, filled with subtle whispering and other nice touches, is crystal clear.  The extra features are mostly throw-away fluff, but the commentary by the director is strong and informative.

I loved it and so do my guy and my friends....so let's start from the top. I lit a candle and I need you to picture one of those great old movie theatre's; and its an empty theatre, the walls are black......the rest of the theatre is completely drenched in black...theirs  long black letters on the screen, they're blurry at 1st and as you get closer you start to notice a few things......The Theatre is no longer empty as you see a boy the age of 8 and an older girl sitting next to him wearing an old Orange jacket and thick glasses. It's strange but you know that the girls a ghost and the boy has the special ability to talk to ghost to help them...after that you have to know more.....Now I saw this movie after the 6th sense and at 1st I liked this one more cause of the story line....but later I linked the 6th sense and this one all up with The Shining.....(even with Simpson's version of The Shining....where Groundskeeper Willy says you've got the shinning......Bart says...Oh you mean Shining.....and he says......shhh! You wanna get sued, which is funny cause I've seen 50000 spoofs of this, my 2nd favorite being the South Park episode at the old Blockbuster Stan's dad bought. Which brings me to the cemetery scene in Stir of Echoes. The boy walks past a tall black man who says The Boys got the second sight.....x-Ray....the father 2. And I thought this was one of Kevin Bacon's best roles.....the other and this is gonna date me......was Tremors. The mom I thought was a tad annoying cause she took a long while 2 understand what was going on, and wasn't exactly being supportive....until a while in the movie. As for the little boy, as far as I'm concerned....I like him....Haley Joel Osment and Danny. I thought the clues were Really cool, my favorite was the movie theatre intro I did.....and how he kept  humming Paint It Black.....A song which the mom knew but wasn't sure why the kid was singing it...and in turn he wasn't sure either...I liked how the day the murder happened started coming to life in bits and pieces of clues that Kevin Bacon had to figure out, and I liked how when the girl got her retribution.....she was released and got to leave this plane  ( in fact that's the song I used for my Headline.)

77596,A7PBI5HADJYER,0784013470,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","Kevin Bacon is Tom Witzky, a normal man who's just moved into a new Chicago neighborhood with his wife (Kathryn Erbe) and young son. Going to a party one night, he's hypnotized by his sister-in-law just for kicks, but once he's out of his trance, he receives dark visions and strange messages that lead to a mystery that occurred in the very neighborhood he now lives in. Underrated financial failure(somehow, the awful Stigmata managed to gross much more money on the same opening weekend) from writer/director David Koepp is an engrossing thriller and one of the most effective horror films of the 90's, it's intelligent, superbly acted (Kevin Bacon delivers possibly the best performance of his career), and most importanty, suspenseful and frightening.

It's about Kevin Bacon's character who plays the role of a father/husband to a younger son and after some light-hearted encouragement to get hypnotized one night at a party, soon after he begins to see premonitions of future (or past) events around the neighborhood.  This is when the horror kicks in.He and his wife have a younger son and initially it's believed he's talking to imaginary friends, but soon they realize the names he's blurting out while playing with his toys are that of real people that have died.  The parents don't take this seriously or think it's cause for concern until an almost kidnapping incident involving the boy and the babysitter later on (the boy blurts out the name ""Samantha"" the name of the babysitters missing sister, so she panics, grabs the boy and tries to take him to her mother before getting caught).  Then Kevin Bacon and his wife put the pieces together and realize that something isn't quite right here!  Trying to find out what happened to the missing girl is the ultimate message here.Kevin Bacon does a great job playing the confused husband/father never quite sure how to interpret the visions that he sees, and his wife and son are both terrific actors in their respective roles as well.  In fact the little boy is quite sharp as far as his acting skills are concerned.  Basically the movie is about Kevin Bacon trying to figure out what's going inside his brain and why he's seeing events before they happen, and in the second half -without spoiling anything- the little boys images are also revealed and shown in remarkably spooky fashion.  Keeping the events around the neighborhood and especially in the house was the best way to tell this story for the full amount of scariness.I highly recommend this movie.",4,what's stirring in the echoes,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,1816,"['Stir', 'Echoes', 'really', 'impressive', 'horror', 'flick', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'who', 'role', 'father/husband', 'younger', 'son', 'light-hearted', 'encouragement', 'get', 'hypnotized', 'one', 'night', 'party', 'soon', 'see', 'premonitions', 'future', 'past', 'events', 'neighborhood', 'when', 'horror', 'in.He', 'wife', 'have', 'younger', 'son', 'initially', 'believed', 'talking', 'imaginary', 'friends', 'soon', 'realize', 'names', 'blurting', 'out', 'playing', 'toys', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'died', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'think', 'cause', 'concern', 'almost', 'kidnapping', 'incident', 'involving', 'boy', 'babysitter', 'later', 'boy', 'out', 'name', 'Samantha', 'name', 'babysitters', 'missing', 'sister', 'panics', 'grabs', 'boy', 'take', 'mother', 'getting', 'caught', 'Then', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'wife', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'realize', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'here', 'Trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'missing', 'girl', 'ultimate', 'message', 'here.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'confused', 'husband/father', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'interpret', 'visions', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'terrific', 'actors', 'respective', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'little', 'boy', 'quite', 'sharp', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'concerned', 'Basically', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'brain', 'why', 'seeing', 'events', 'happen', 'second', 'half', 'spoiling', 'anything-', 'little', 'boys', 'images', 'are', 'also', 'revealed', 'shown', 'remarkably', 'spooky', 'fashion', 'Keeping', 'events', 'neighborhood', 'especially', 'house', 'was', 'best', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'full', 'amount', 'scariness.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",Stir Of Echoes

In fact in comparing the two, Stir is far and away the better psychological thriller.  Written by Richard Matheson (one of Stephen King's biggest influences) in the 1950's some detail had to be changed and it's all for the better.  The events unfold in Chicago, not L.A., which is a welcome change and gives us a real sense of home.  We identify with Kevin Bacon's Tom, a struggling musician who finds himself in a dead-end job and living a perfectly average life (not what he wants at all).  That is until he finds himself seeing a ghost of a teenage girl whose asking him for help.  While she's very menacing at times there's a consent sense that David Koepp's steering this film in a different direction than you might expect.  It's very sensative and plays on our fears, not so much of haunted houses or evil spirits, but of eachother and more directly - of losing our sanity.  Bacon's performance while not Oscar-worthy is maybe his best since Sleepers and he manages to nail the Chicago accent to a tee.

77630,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0784013470,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Stir of Echoes has something that most movies do not have-a story adapted from a Richard Matheson novel.  I haven't had a chance to read this particular novel as of yet and thus cannot say how closely the movie follows it, but the fact that we have this movie as a result of director David Koepp's chance reading of the highly talented Matheson's 1958 novel is a powerful argument for keeping the works of the truly great writers in print and readily available to all.  Certainly, there is a Sixth Sense quality to this movie, quite by accident and somewhat to its misfortune in terms of the timing of its theatrical release, but this movie stands on its own quite nicely.  Kevin Bacon gives a remarkable performance as Tom Witzky, a man haunted by visions he can neither understand nor escape from.  These disturbing visions first come to him after he is hypnotized by his sister-in-law at a party, and almost immediately they begin to consume him.  His wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) grows frantic with worry, while his son Jake (Zachary David Cope making his feature film debut) eases his transition into this strange new mental world.  Jake has been talking to ghosts throughout his childhood, especially Samantha, the teenager Tom unexpectedly encounters on his couch that first night and seeks to ""find"" again.  Samantha wants him to do something, and Tom's struggle involves finding out just what that something is.  There are plenty of creepy scenes to be enjoyed, and the visual presentation of Samantha is especially well done; the unnatural way she moves was captured by having Jennifer Morrison walk especially slowly and filming her using a different frame rate than normal.  It's remarkably effective.  The visions are also impressive-we see what Tom sees and can understand the frustration he feels at not being able to interpret them.  All he gets are scattered images, and it is up to him to put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.  The mystery of Samantha's disappearance is not obvious, thank goodness, and this fact allows for a truly spectacular end to this movie.This is a thoroughly enjoyable, thought-provoking film, one more than capable of pleasing stalwart horror lovers like myself as well as more mainstream viewers who wander into the realm of the cinematic supernatural only on special occasions or by accident.  The acting is superb on all counts, from Bacon on down the line to Cope, and the rather subdued special effects really work marvelously and help reinforce the believability of the otherwise fantastic story.  There is a definite air of realism and plausibility here, and that helps maintain a crucial connection between the audience and the film.The special features offered on the DVD are good things to have, but they don't really increase your enjoyment of the movie itself.  The featurette is actually rather short in length and mainly features short interviews with the cast and crew.  The behind the scenes featurette seems rather strange; you just get very short looks at cast and crew preparing or doing their work, and there is no effort to explain anything that you are seeing.  Of course, the DVD also features a commentary by director David Koepp for those who really want to dig deeply into the genesis of this action-packed thriller.  I was disappointed to find no deleted scenes included on the DVD, though; normally, I'm not that high on deleted scenes because most of the time it is quite easy to see why they were deleted.  In the production notes for Stir of Echoes, though, Koepp refers to a scene featuring Samantha which he found too creepy to include in the final cut; I would really have liked to have a look at that scene.Stir of Echoes is a great example of realistic suspense done right.  Foregoing blood and heavy-handed horror tactics, director David Koepp has succeeded in giving us an electrifying, deliciously creepy, intellectually stimulating supernatural thriller every bit as exciting and memorable as The Sixth Sense.",5,"A mesmerizing, intelligent supernatural thriller",1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,3999,"['Stir', 'Echoes', 'something', 'most', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'have-a', 'story', 'adapted', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'read', 'particular', 'novel', 'yet', 'thus', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'how', 'closely', 'movie', 'fact', 'have', 'movie', 'result', 'director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'chance', 'reading', 'highly', 'talented', 'Matheson', '1958', 'novel', 'powerful', 'argument', 'keeping', 'works', 'truly', 'great', 'writers', 'print', 'readily', 'available', 'Certainly', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quality', 'movie', 'quite', 'accident', 'somewhat', 'misfortune', 'terms', 'timing', 'theatrical', 'release', 'movie', 'own', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Witzky', 'man', 'haunted', 'visions', 'can', 'understand', 'escape', 'disturbing', 'visions', 'first', 'come', 'hypnotized', 'sister-in-law', 'party', 'almost', 'immediately', 'begin', 'consume', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'frantic', 'worry', 'son', 'Jake', 'Zachary', 'David', 'Cope', 'making', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'transition', 'strange', 'new', 'mental', 'world', 'Jake', 'been', 'talking', 'ghosts', 'childhood', 'especially', 'Samantha', 'teenager', 'Tom', 'unexpectedly', 'couch', 'first', 'night', 'find', 'again', 'Samantha', 'do', 'something', 'Tom', 'struggle', 'finding', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'something', 'are', 'plenty', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'visual', 'presentation', 'Samantha', 'especially', 'well', 'done', 'unnatural', 'way', 'was', 'captured', 'having', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'walk', 'especially', 'slowly', 'filming', 'using', 'different', 'frame', 'rate', 'normal', 'remarkably', 'effective', 'visions', 'are', 'also', 'impressive-we', 'see', 'what', 'Tom', 'can', 'understand', 'frustration', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'interpret', 'are', 'scattered', 'images', 'up', 'put', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'together', 'mystery', 'Samantha', 'disappearance', 'not', 'obvious', 'thank', 'goodness', 'fact', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'end', 'movie.This', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'capable', 'pleasing', 'stalwart', 'horror', 'lovers', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'mainstream', 'viewers', 'who', 'wander', 'realm', 'cinematic', 'supernatural', 'only', 'special', 'occasions', 'accident', 'acting', 'superb', 'counts', 'Bacon', 'line', 'Cope', 'rather', 'subdued', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'work', 'marvelously', 'help', 'reinforce', 'believability', 'otherwise', 'fantastic', 'story', 'definite', 'air', 'realism', 'plausibility', 'here', 'maintain', 'crucial', 'connection', 'audience', 'film.The', 'special', 'features', 'offered', 'DVD', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'increase', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'featurette', 'actually', 'rather', 'short', 'length', 'mainly', 'short', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'rather', 'strange', 'just', 'get', 'very', 'short', 'looks', 'cast', 'crew', 'preparing', 'doing', 'work', 'effort', 'explain', 'anything', 'are', 'seeing', 'course', 'DVD', 'also', 'commentary', 'director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'dig', 'deeply', 'genesis', 'action-packed', 'thriller', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'DVD', 'though', 'normally', ""'m"", 'not', 'that', 'high', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', 'time', 'quite', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'production', 'notes', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'though', 'Koepp', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Samantha', 'found', 'too', 'creepy', 'include', 'final', 'cut', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'look', 'scene.Stir', 'Echoes', 'great', 'example', 'realistic', 'suspense', 'done', 'right', 'Foregoing', 'blood', 'heavy-handed', 'horror', 'tactics', 'director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'succeeded', 'giving', 'electrifying', 'deliciously', 'creepy', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'bit', 'exciting', 'memorable', 'Sixth', 'Sense']",Stir Of Echoes

Woehr,"[0, 0]","This is a good movie to watch during the wee hours of the morning, when  nobody is around to pester you and you're in the mood for some thrills and  chills.  Stir of Echoes has plenty of them.  The movie starts off with the  kid taking a bath.  His father, Tom (Kevin Bacon), is talking to him from  the bedroom.  But the boy is clearly talking to somebody else.  The camera  angles around when he is whisked out of the tub.  Nobody is there.Tom takes  his wife and goes across the street to join a party, where his  sister-in-law hypnotizes him.  The special effects in that scene were very  good.  I won't spoil them for you.  After he comes out the trance and goes  home, thinking he can sleep off the weird experience.But then the ghost of  Samantha, who disappeared about a year before, starts haunting him.  The  movie really takes off from there, catapulting Tom and his family into a  surreal and scary nightmare, where he can see ghosts and foretell the  future of his neighbors.  Samantha continues to haunt him until he is  forced to find out what happened to her.  The ending was typical of  Hollywood, but I was still satisfied.Stir of Echoes is based on the novel  that was written by Richard Mattheson during the 1950s.  Koepp had to  change the plot quite a bit to modernize it to the 90s, but he did a good  job.  The story was still virtually the same.

He and his family live in a small residential neighborhood  filled wit lots of people who care for their image of a well-rounded  community. However, at a party, Bacon is hypnotized by his wife's friend,  and he beins to have visions of a girl, and it seems that she's being  attacked. This begins his spiralling downfall, as he begins to tear apart  his life and his home for the clues to the final answer, forsaking his job,  his social life and his family.  The storyline of the movie is  terrific, with an evident element of suspense that is sure to please fans  of The Sixth Sense. Yet, when the ending comes, it seems as though the  filmmakers traded originality for a typical Hollywood ending scenario.

Even taking into account the obvious similarities to ""The Sixth Sense"" (which I thought was much more well done) and an influence of both movies, ""The Shining"", I never got the impression that I was watching anything original.  ""Stir of Echoes"" is a rote supernatural-themed thriller that probably worked better in the original book than it does on the big screen.Kevin Bacon's character does start to get developed a little in the beginning of the movie as we find out that he wants to be more than an ""ordinary guy"", but this never goes anywhere.  He starts having bizarre visions after being hypnotized by his wife's sister (played by Illeana Douglas, whose role as a dippy academic was funny in ""Ghost World"" but is just annoying here).  The most effective bits of the movie for me were the brief snippets of visions shown through Kevin Bacon's point of view ... whether seeing them in real-time or in DVD freeze-frame, they were both scary and intriguing.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't take the premise anywhere new or exciting.

77644,A2IY9M330NKBW6,0784013470,Eric Sanberg,"[3, 3]","I'm not certain why I'm reviewing this as so many others already have. I suppose it's because I've seen it for a second time after it's original release and I liked it better this time around.Here's the scoop. Kevin Bacon and his wife have a young son who appears to be in communication with someone unseen. After a party where Kevin is hypnotized, he gets a glimpse of what his son is communicating with, and it sends him 'round the bend. This leads to the unraveling of a mystery which began in their neighborhood some 6 months earlier.One of the things that caught my attention was that this story was originally penned by Richard Matheson as a book. He has a boatload of credits to his name both as a book and short story author as well as the dozens of film and TV scripts he's written. He's responsible for many of the episodes of the original ""Twilight Zone"" TV series. That is why, as much as I liked it originally, it seemed a bit out of touch with the times. Like anything else, the approach to writing scripts has changed over the years, and this seemed so 'by the book.' Not at all bad, jut a bit outdated. Also, having been released around the same time as the more popular  ""The Sixth Sense"", which has a similar theme, the differences are striking.This movie sets up the premise and makes a bee-line for the end. Not many subtleties or meanderings. Just pound this sucker out. The second viewing looked better to me. I appreciated the entire thing a lot more. The acting, particularly, struck me as being better. Bacon is usually good but Katheryn Erbe, as his wife, really jumped out. They paired well. The other actors do a good job as well. Illeana Douglas' character might have been a bit 'too' but that's a minor quibble.This is a strong, blue collar type outing. It's by the book in a good way. All the production values and directing are solid.

77648,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0784013470,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 1]","`Stir of Echoes' is one of the better supernatural thrillers I have seen in some time.  It is a frightening and gripping story, well presented and well crafted.  Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) and his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe)  live a normal middle class life with their son Jake (Zachary David Cope) in  a Chicago suburb.  Normal, that is, except for the fact that young Jake is  communing with the dead.  One evening Tom dares his sister-in-law to  hypnotize him to prove it is a bunch of baloney.  The result is that Tom  begins to get visions of a young girl named Samantha; the same girl Jake  has been talking with.  When Tom gets a message to find her, he begins an  all consuming and obsessive quest.  What he finds turns out to be an evil  and sinister revelation that puts him and his whole family in grave  danger.The story is very effective, presented more as a psychological  horror film rather than the grisly gore so prevalent in the genre.  Numerous comparisons have been made between this film and `The Shining' and  `Close Encounters of the Third Kind', somehow implying that because this  film used some of the effective devices from those films, it is without  value.  I couldn't disagree more.  There is a difference between ripping  off a story and adapting effective devices used in other films.  This film  did the later par extraordinaire.  This story used a novel approach to a  well plowed genre.  It combined the supernatural element with a mystery to  produce a powerful hybrid.  Forget the comparison with `Sixth Sense'.  The  only thing these films had in common was dead people.Writer/Director  David Koepp did a terrific job in both capacities.  The story was  plausible, frightening and drew the viewer in.  There were some dangling  dead end plot lines (Maggie's pregnancy disappeared as a plot element after  the announcement; and what was Neil about?) that just wasted our time. But  mostly, everything fit together well.  The direction was fabulous.  It was  designed to scare the hell out of you and that it did.  Koepp created  incredible suspense without the use of expensive special effects, simply by  using the camera and sound effectively.  The five speaker surround on the  DVD was particularly good and added impact and eeriness to each  scene.Kevin Bacon was at the top of his game in this film.  His  obsession with finding Samantha was played with intensity and single  mindedness.  Kathryn Erbe was also good as Maggie, bringing both strength  and passion to the part.I rated this film a 9/10.

He only sees bits and pieces of these images and he tries to place them together to figure out what they mean. He will stop at nothing to figure out this mystery whether it means tearing apart his house, his marriage or his life.

Both of these movies came out the same year, and the sixth sense was worshipped and made a ridiculous amount of money at the box office. I saw it, enjoyed it, but was unaware that this movie existed. But now, I saw it at Blockbuster and picked it up and adored it. This movie is a remarquable achievement caried by Kevin Bacon's best performance. The first 30 minutes of this movie sucked me in and never let up.It's about Tom (Kevin Bacon), a guy living a normal life, in a nice neighborhood in Chicago where he and his wife and child, Jake recently moved into. They are renting a nice houseand have made lots of friends. They're living the life. But after Tom gets hypnotized (in one of the creepiest and most fascinating scenes ever), he is seeing stuff. Weird stuff. And contacting with the dead. His son Jake also seems to have these abilities. Things start getting weird, and I don't want to say anything else. Nothing. I want you to discover this amazing movie by yourself. All I will stay is that everything that you see will all make sense in the masterful finale.The little boy playing Jake was wonderful and Kevin Bacon was fantastic.So check out this wonderful suspense movie that also happens to have lots of great humor and made me laugh a good deal.

Well, basically, this gift that the man has been given drives him crazy and he must uncover the mystery behind a ghost who haunts him to aid her in obtaining justice for her wrongful death.  Acting and directing are average in this movie.The movie ""Stir of Echos"" is definitely good for a chill or two when you watch it the first time, but after watching, the movie loses its horror element and the effect on the viewer is clearly lacking.  Admittedly, a lot of horror movies have this problem, but not to this extent because the horror that is inherent is this movie is extinguished by the time the climax and end of the movie rolls around which is obviously a bummer if you are a pure horror movie extremist as I am.In other words, the problem with the movie is that the ghost and haunting like atmosphere which is created by the movie is spoiled by the ending in which we discover that the true villain is nothing but some kid and his father.  Indeed, the true villains in this movie are not supernatural at all and when one really considers this movie as a whole, the supernatural element is quite benevolent in nature therefore creating a sense of relief before the ending of the movie...hence what was supposed to be the climax turns into an ordinary murder mystery as the element of horror is extinguished.  So, if you realize this much after a first viewing, the movie just is not as effective the second time around...in effect, by the time the end of the movie comes around, one already knows that the ghost is a good ghost who was wronged in her earthly life and therefore, the supernatural theme is rendered rather useless as a tool of inspiring fear at the end.What I am essentially trying to say is that the supernatural and haunting element of this movie was the only thing that was capable of producing scares, but after you realize the ghost is benevolent, what's left to scare you?  Basically, the movie would have been better if the ghost was of an evil or malevolent nature like the ghost in the movie ""The Ring"" as that would have made this movie much scarier and more effective as horror.  Nevertheless, as a sophisticated horror movie fan, you might get ""a little"" entertainment out of it the first time you watch it, but it is certainly not worth an encore viewing.

In &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; we encounter  more paranoia and its effects on a Chicago-based family. The cause of the  paranoia comes when the head of the family (Kevin Bacon) is hypnotized by  an unlicensed hypno-therapist (Illeana Douglas). The hypnosis opens an  unlocked chamber of Bacon's mind and unleashes a long kept secret come to  life.&quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; is a very light and subtle ghost story  thriller. How can a film like this overcome the flooded horror genre  market? Well the standout performance by Kevin Bacon is probably a good  start as he gives one of his best in recent years. His protective nature  towards his boy, his obsession with trying to solve his polluted mind and  his reactions with the supernatural phenomenon bring out every reaction in  Bacon. The portrayal reminded me a lot of Craig T Nelson in the classic  &quot;Poltergeist&quot; as an every day man trying to battle the unknown.  Other evidences of &quot;Poltergeist&quot; were in the &quot;little  boy&quot; who knows more than his parents and seems to be in tune with the  corporeal world. One aspect of Echoes which is never fully explored is the  &quot;open-minded&quot; underground where the wife learns that only 8% of  the population have the ability to see the corporeal world. Begging for  help this intriguing subplot could have been the key this supernatural  thriller needed. Except the story takes the obvious road and we end at the  conclusion. Was this fully explored in the novel? We may never know.

77666,A2J7ZFZIKR267G,0784013470,J A W,"[1, 2]","This is not a bad movie.  It is reasonably well made, although it has dubiously long sequences of Kevin Bacon searching for power tools and using said power tools w/o any serious tension, as we know exactly what he will find, as does he.  Also, the background crime and its perpetrators were too easy to discern halfway through the film, and some variation of the confrontation was obvious 40 minutes into the film.  The film has an effective mood, and a couple of jolts...My problem w/ films like this, and I know there are those of you like me, is this:  In horror, in Supernatural horror, the supernatural has to be malevolent and it has to be the threat.  If an average human is a greater threat to the protagonist than the ghost--which seems to be the common norm of most modern horror/thrillers (Below, 6th Sense, What Lies Beneath, The Others, 28 Days Later, this)--then it does nothing for me.  It's not scary.  A ghost trying to warn you or avenge its death isn't scary.  Sure, the film may manipulate some jumps out of you w/ quick shots of the practically harmless ghost, but after you've experience the thrills, what remains?  Once you know the secret of &quot;The Others&quot;, what could possibly be scary about the movie after a second viewing?  The Exorcist is still scary, because that movie is about an evil presence out to harm you.  The Ring gave me some uneasy nights, I admit, because the threat was evil.  The Blair Witch Project, the same thing.  There's nothing scary about the ghosts in this, in The Others, in the 6th Sense.So, if you really enjoyed movies w/ ghosts who are only harmful in their pop-up-out-of-no-where powers, and human conspiracies about failed coverups scare you more, then you'd like this.

It had several things which did not make sense, such as a small boy sees a dead girl named Samantha, and his father played by Kevin Bacon gets hypnotized at a party and can suddenly see the dead girl as well. This movie is a combination between the crazy hallucinations of Poltergeist, the dead people of the Sixth Sense, and its really a murder mystery movie disguised as a thriller / scary movie. As weird as the movie and the hallucinations of Kevin Bacon are, it does climax quite nicely and predictably at the end, making the movie worth a watch.

His son also has a similar power but only calm to spirits, Tom must find clues of the dead woman so he can get rid of his unwanted powers and find a way to let her spirit rest.Intriguing and smart psychological supernatural horror thriller based on a novel by Richard Matheson is one of the most overlooked horror movies of all time. It was originally made in 1998 then released later in September 1999 on the month after the successful similar movie ""The Sixth Sense"", some folks and critics have compared to the other movie while some have declaired this to be the better of the two. Sure ""The Sixth Sense"" was an excellent movie in it's own right but this is a more involving and scary thrill-ride as it's truly the best horror movie of 1999 and a must see.This Special Edition DVD contains very good extras like audio commentary,  Deleted scenes, Screen test clips, Behind The Scenes/Final Shot Comparisons, Featurettes and Music video.Also recommended: ""Poltergeist"", ""The Others"", ""Silent Hill"", ""Final Destination Trilogy"", ""Saw II"", ""The Tenent"", ""Sixth Sense"", ""Making Contact (a.k.a.

But, Stir of Echoes borrows so heavily from The Sixth Sense that it might as well have been titled The Seventh Sense, and it is a huge disappointment.Tom (Kevin Bacon) is a regular guy, a utilities lineman, married, with a young son, his wife is pregnant; he hangs out with long-time pals in a Chicago neighborhood. At a party, his sister-in-law hypnotizes him, and he goes into a deep trance. Before waking him, she suggests that he keep his mind open. That night he sees flashes of violence and the ghost of a young woman. His young son, too, is &quot;a receiver,&quot; but while the boy is calm and coherent in his conversations with spirits, Tom is confused and agitated. Over time, the young woman's story comes to the surface, and Tom begins a hunt for her body that puts him and his usually understanding wife, Maggie (Katherine Erbe), in grave danger.Stir of Echoes does not only take scenes from The Sixth Sense, it uses The Shining's story, man-goes-crazy-and-freaks-family-out, and it basically insults the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. Most of the performances are laughable, especially Kevin Bacon and Zachary David Cope in a stupidly over-blown chemistry, but, Katherine Erbe manages to an okay heroine, though she does not put nearly enough effort in to save this film. The easy way to say it is this film is predictable, annoying and boring, and does not deserve the critical-acclaim and large audience it got.The finale is entertaining and neatly done, but, guess what! It uses exactly the same techniques as The Green Mile did! God, it's becoming uncountable how many movies this borrows from.

If you read a book or see a movie that stretches the boundaries of reality, or so you believe, but the art compels you to enter into its dimension and you do so, you have willingly suspended your disbelief.Are there ghosts? If so, can they visit their needs upon us? Can they grab our attention and demand justice? Is it possible for hypnosis to ""open doors to the impossible?"" Director David Koepp and his convincing cast make the viewer want to suspend disbelief and join them in this 94-minute excursion into the world beyond death.As usual, Kevin Bacon, one of our best actors, delivers a convincing performance as Tom, the ultimate skeptic. His apology to Maggie for his ordinariness seems out of place at the time, but it foreshadows the unlikely event to follow: his dip into otherworldliness. Another seemingly incongruous scene places Jake (Zachary David Cope) and Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) at a cemetery, where Jake, by seeming happenstance, meets Neil, another open-door traveler into the other world. It is Neil's explanation that helps Maggie grasp the intensity of Tom's visions, but not understand them.A spare economy of scenes makes each one pertinent to plot development, a sort of one-thing-leads-to-another-to-another-and so on. Maggie's visit to Neil causes her to put a knife in her purse. Her grandmother dies, removing Jake from his bed of feathers. Jake reminds his mother to take her purse, which, of course, puts the knife at hand for the ending. None of this is spoiler material. If you read this beforehand, it will mean nothing except a clicking into place as you view. Afterward, you will say, Aha!Crime will out, especially when the echoes of the dead, once living, find an ""open door"" to stir through and demand help.

77693,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0784013470,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 2]","""Stir of Echoes"" succeeds because of the talents of a pair of individuals who are under-appreciated in Hollywood.  First, there is Richard Matheson, whose novel is adapted here by writer-director David Koepp.  Just in terms of novels that have been made into movies Matheson has on his resume ""I Am Legend,"" ""What Dreams May Come,"" ""Bid Time Return"" (filmed as ""Somewhere in Time""), ""Someone Is Bleeding,"" ""Hell House,"" and ""The Shrinking Man"" (which the babysitter is reading in this movie).  There we can talk about 16 episodes of ""The Twilight Zone,"" the scripts for the television movies ""Duel"" and ""The Night Talker,"" and the screenplays for ""House of Usher"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  Matheson should be mentioned in the same breath with Rod Serling and Stephen King, and have his name appear before the title, but after all these years I am left with the feeling that the only ones who have always recognized Matheson as being that good are fellow writers like Serling and King.The other person whose reputation with audiences is not as good as it is with his peers is Kevin Bacon.  The actor held his own with Oscar winners Sean Penn and Tim Robbins in ""Mystic River,"" and while there were certainly reviews that noted how well he did in his less flashier role, you know that most audience members cannot think of him with (a) figuring out how to get from whatever movie they are watching to one in which he starred, (b) humming the theme from ""Footloose,"" or (c) both.  In ""Stir of Echoes"" it is Bacon's performance of a working stiff that grounds Matheson's ghost story in the world of the living, which is what makes it chilling.There is a sense in which ""Stir of Echoes"" is a combination of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Mystic River,"" but simply on the level where we have a ghost story set in a working class neighborhood.  Tom (Bacon) is married to Maggie (Kathryn Erbe), and they have a five-year-old named Jake (Zachary David Cope).  They never notice that their son talks to somebody who is not there and asks questions about whether it hurts to be dead.  One night at a party Tom agrees to be hypnotized by Maggie's sister, Lisa (Illeana Doulgas), who plays around with the idea of being a New Age mystic.  When Tom comes out of his trance he is not quite sure what happened while he was under.  But when he starts seeing the ghost of a young girl (Jenny Morrison), he knows it has something to do with being hypnotized and eventually Lisa confesses that she did make a post-hypnotic suggestion that she thought would improve her brother-in-law.Tom's life starts coming apart as he becomes obsessed with finding out what the ghost wants, especially once he learns that her name is Samantha and that she was a girl from the neighborhood who disappeared the year before. Tom never wanted to be famous, but he is bothered by the fact that his life is so ordinary.  Well, those days (and nights) are behind him now.  It is up to his wife to have a chance encounter with the person, Neil the Cop (Eddie Bo Smith Jr.) who explains what has happened: a switch has been thrown and Tom is now a receiver.  If he does not do what the ghost requires, then he will never be free.  But Tom does not understand what is required and risks losing not only his job, but his friends and family.The rule in films such as this one is to express madness by going over the top, but Bacon heads in the opposite direction.  As he is confronted with nightmarish visions he becomes more withdrawn.  Characters haunted by ghosts are rarely so soft spoken.  Bacon's choice is perfect for both the character and the story, for when Samantha is able to communicate a single word, ""Dig,"" it reinforces the idea that the truth of this tale is buried not only with Tom's house, but within himself as well.  His acceptance of what he is being asked to do has elements is more than weary resignation, for he understands that there is a wrong to be righted.How good of a ghost story you think ""Stir of Echoes"" ends up having to do with how far ahead you get of Tom in his quest to put everything together.  Once Tom starts digging he spends a lot of time digging in the wrong places, and while he is busy doing that pieces start to fall into place.  Koepp plays with us a bit with regards to what is really happening to Tom and his visions.  The ones from the past are easy to figure out, but there are also looks into the future that can fake you out, which can be annoying as well.  But Bacon's performance makes up for these flaws and even if the endgame of ""Stir of Echoes"" takes the story back to familiar ground, it is still a lot better than most of the horror films I have seen since this 1999 film came out.",4,Kevin Bacon does fine in a Richard Matheson ghost story,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,4698,"['Stir', 'Echoes', 'talents', 'pair', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'under-appreciated', 'Hollywood', 'First', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'adapted', 'here', 'writer-director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'Just', 'terms', 'novels', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'movies', 'Matheson', 'resume', 'Am', 'Legend', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'Bid', 'Time', 'Return', 'filmed', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'Someone', 'Bleeding', 'Hell', 'House', 'Shrinking', 'Man', 'babysitter', 'reading', 'movie', 'can', 'talk', '16', 'episodes', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'scripts', 'television', 'movies', 'Duel', 'Night', 'Talker', 'screenplays', 'House', 'Usher', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'Matheson', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'same', 'breath', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Stephen', 'King', 'have', 'name', 'appear', 'title', 'years', 'am', 'left', 'feeling', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'always', 'recognized', 'Matheson', 'being', 'good', 'are', 'fellow', 'writers', 'Serling', 'King.The', 'other', 'person', 'reputation', 'audiences', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'peers', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'actor', 'held', 'own', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Mystic', 'River', 'were', 'certainly', 'noted', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'less', 'flashier', 'role', 'know', 'most', 'audience', 'members', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'movie', 'are', 'watching', 'one', 'starred', 'b', 'humming', 'theme', 'Footloose', 'c', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'working', 'stiff', 'Matheson', 'ghost', 'story', 'world', 'living', 'what', 'sense', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'combination', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Mystic', 'River', 'simply', 'level', 'where', 'have', 'ghost', 'story', 'set', 'working', 'class', 'neighborhood', 'Tom', 'Bacon', 'married', 'Maggie', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'have', 'five-year-old', 'named', 'Jake', 'Zachary', 'David', 'Cope', 'never', 'notice', 'son', 'talks', 'somebody', 'who', 'not', 'there', 'asks', 'questions', 'be', 'dead', 'One', 'night', 'party', 'Tom', 'be', 'hypnotized', 'Maggie', 'sister', 'Lisa', 'Illeana', 'Doulgas', 'who', 'idea', 'being', 'New', 'Age', 'mystic', 'When', 'Tom', 'trance', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'when', 'seeing', 'ghost', 'young', 'girl', 'Jenny', 'Morrison', 'something', 'do', 'being', 'hypnotized', 'eventually', 'Lisa', 'did', 'make', 'post-hypnotic', 'suggestion', 'thought', 'would', 'improve', 'brother-in-law.Tom', 'life', 'coming', 'apart', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'ghost', 'especially', 'once', 'name', 'Samantha', 'was', 'girl', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'disappeared', 'year', 'before', 'Tom', 'never', 'wanted', 'be', 'famous', 'bothered', 'fact', 'life', 'so', 'ordinary', 'Well', 'days', 'nights', 'are', 'now', 'up', 'wife', 'have', 'chance', 'encounter', 'person', 'Neil', 'Cop', 'Eddie', 'Bo', 'Smith', 'Jr.', 'who', 'what', 'happened', 'switch', 'been', 'thrown', 'Tom', 'now', 'receiver', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'ghost', 'then', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'free', 'Tom', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'required', 'risks', 'losing', 'not', 'only', 'job', 'friends', 'family.The', 'rule', 'films', 'such', 'one', 'express', 'madness', 'going', 'top', 'Bacon', 'heads', 'opposite', 'direction', 'confronted', 'nightmarish', 'visions', 'more', 'withdrawn', 'Characters', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'are', 'rarely', 'so', 'soft', 'spoken', 'Bacon', 'choice', 'perfect', 'character', 'story', 'when', 'Samantha', 'able', 'communicate', 'single', 'word', 'Dig', 'idea', 'truth', 'tale', 'buried', 'not', 'only', 'Tom', 'house', 'as', 'well', 'acceptance', 'what', 'being', 'asked', 'do', 'elements', 'more', 'weary', 'resignation', 'wrong', 'be', 'righted.How', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'think', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'up', 'having', 'do', 'how', 'far', 'ahead', 'get', 'Tom', 'quest', 'put', 'everything', 'together', 'Once', 'Tom', 'digging', 'lot', 'time', 'digging', 'wrong', 'places', 'busy', 'doing', 'pieces', 'start', 'fall', 'place', 'Koepp', 'bit', 'regards', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'Tom', 'visions', 'ones', 'past', 'are', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'also', 'future', 'can', 'fake', 'out', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'as', 'well', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'up', 'flaws', 'even', 'endgame', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'story', 'back', 'familiar', 'ground', 'still', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'seen', '1999', 'film', 'came', 'out']",Stir Of Echoes

Of course, many children have invisible friends and we chalk the experience up to what we know.  What becomes unusual is when Tim is hypnotized during a party.  Suddenly, Tim experiences unusual and bizarre nightmares, including situations where he not only sees things, but experiences things physically.Tim tries to have the hypnotist undo whatever she did, but she is unable to do so, because she really does not know what she did.  Tim's visions increase as he becomes obsessed with more than finding out the source of the visions.  For some reason he is being compelled by a ghost to do something, for a reason that he has yet to understand.  As Tim's obsession/compulsion grows, his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) begins to think that Tim is either insane or heading in that direction.As we follow Tim's descent into madness, a number of occurrences convince us that either his insanity is quite vivid (for the skeptics among us), or he truly is seeing a ghost.  Eventually we are convinced that he is seeing a ghost, which makes his situation even more frightening, because the ghost becomes insistent to the extent of putting Tim and possibly Jake's life in danger.This movie contains sufficient psychological thrills in combination with jump out from behind the corner scares and an ending that I did not see coming to give it advantages over ""The Sixth Sense.""  This movie is not necessarily better than ""The Sixth Sense"" because it is a different kind of movie.  However, it is its equal in setting up an eerie atmosphere and superior in providing several moments that gave me a nice jump (when was the last time you saw a dead girl unexpectedly sitting next to you on the couch?).Kevin Bacon provides an incredible performance in this movie.  I consider Kevin's performance superior to Bruce Willis's because of the intensity of Kevin's character, and the need to play someone who appeared on the borderline of being insane yet knowing that he was under a terrible compulsion that he did not control.  The combination of emotions Kevin attained was more difficult than Bruce Willis's rather staid role.The supporting actors completed the rather mundane scenario, which could have been acted out in your neighborhood, just around the corner.  The people seemed so real, so normal.  Their dreams and actions were those of people that likely you know.  It is their very normalcy and that this story takes place in a suburb rather than an isolated location that makes this story scarier.This movie is one of the best ghost stories I have watched, and I consider it to be one of the best ghost stories of all time.

This is a truly creepy  movie, and scary, as well.  And Bacon's just plain great in the lead roll.

77703,A152C8GYY25HAH,0784013470,Matthew Horner,"[0, 2]","Stir of Echoes had an unremarkable run at the boxoffice. While it only faintly resembles The Sixth Sense, it had enough plot similarities for it to be compared unfavorably to that phenomenal smash hit. The truth is that, for a movie of its type, its business was about average. How we media journalists love to make comparisons! What was really happening in Media Land was this: The small company that released Stir of Echoes was Artisan, which also distributed the sleeper hit The Blair Witch Project. So, like in the case of the Rams' winning the Super Bowl, many of us were eager to say that Artisan couldn't do it twice. As a group, we tend to root for the little guy only until he actually wins. A more convincing case might be made that movies headlining poor Kevin Bacon rarely make money. At least there we have several years worth of data.When the movie opens, we see Tony Witsky [Bacon] sitting on his bed strumming a guitar. In the adjoining bathroom, his six-year old son is taking a bath. From Tony's point of view, the boy seems to be babbling on like many kids do. From ours, he looks as though he is talking to someone only he can see. Our viewpoint is the correct one, for this is a ghost story. At first, no one pays any attention to the child, and when they do, they don't believe him. Later on, Tony has good reason to know his son is telling the truth, and the apparition becomes their secret world. Of course, how a child would handle such a situation is quite different from how an adult would, and one of the delights of the movie is in seeing the huge difference in their reactions.Like most movie ghosts, the dead girl in this one is hanging around until justice is done. Her problem is something Tony and his wife Maggie [Katherine Erbe] have no way to deal with. Although Tony dreams of being a rock star, the couple is basically an ordinary one living in a working-class Chicago neighborhood. They have a good marriage. They are well-liked. The extent of their adventures up to know seems limited to beer-drinking parties and to dealing with Maggie's off-the-wall sister, Lisa [Ileana Douglas], who is studying to be a hypno-therapist.As a tale, Stir of Echoes is genuinely spooky. Tony's uncovering of the ghost's terrible secret merely leads to yet more horror. There are few special effects. Director David Keopp doesn't need them. He makes great use of lightening and sound. There are a few problems with the movie, most of them to do with characterization. Tony tends to be indecisive, and I suspect that such a person would usually choose flight over fight. Maggie gets so loud and agitated when she's angry that it makes the idea of a good marriage a little suspect. When it becomes obvious that Tony has gone over the edge, not only does no one try to intercede, no one even pays much attention. Still, these defects in the plot's structure don't do irreparable harm to the thrill and chill aspects. They do cause Stir of Echoes to be a good movie, rather than a great one.",3,"Atmospheric, scary, well photgraphed",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,3010,"['Stir', 'Echoes', 'had', 'unremarkable', 'run', 'boxoffice', 'only', 'faintly', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'had', 'enough', 'plot', 'similarities', 'be', 'compared', 'unfavorably', 'phenomenal', 'smash', 'hit', 'truth', 'movie', 'type', 'business', 'was', 'about', 'average', 'How', 'media', 'journalists', 'love', 'make', 'comparisons', 'What', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'Media', 'Land', 'was', 'small', 'company', 'released', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'was', 'Artisan', 'also', 'distributed', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'So', 'case', 'Rams', 'winning', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'many', 'were', 'eager', 'say', 'Artisan', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'twice', 'group', 'tend', 'root', 'little', 'guy', 'only', 'actually', 'more', 'convincing', 'case', 'might', 'be', 'made', 'movies', 'headlining', 'poor', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'rarely', 'make', 'money', 'least', 'have', 'several', 'years', 'data.When', 'movie', 'see', 'Tony', 'Witsky', '[', 'Bacon', ']', 'sitting', 'bed', 'strumming', 'guitar', 'adjoining', 'bathroom', 'six-year', 'old', 'son', 'taking', 'bath', 'Tony', 'point', 'view', 'boy', 'be', 'babbling', 'many', 'kids', 'do', 'From', 'ours', 'talking', 'someone', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'viewpoint', 'correct', 'one', 'ghost', 'story', 'first', 'one', 'attention', 'child', 'when', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Later', 'Tony', 'good', 'reason', 'know', 'son', 'telling', 'truth', 'apparition', 'secret', 'world', 'course', 'how', 'child', 'would', 'handle', 'such', 'situation', 'quite', 'different', 'how', 'adult', 'would', 'one', 'delights', 'movie', 'seeing', 'huge', 'difference', 'reactions.Like', 'most', 'movie', 'ghosts', 'dead', 'girl', 'one', 'hanging', 'around', 'justice', 'done', 'problem', 'something', 'Tony', 'wife', 'Maggie', '[', 'Katherine', 'Erbe', ']', 'have', 'way', 'deal', 'Tony', 'dreams', 'being', 'rock', 'star', 'couple', 'basically', 'ordinary', 'one', 'living', 'working-class', 'Chicago', 'neighborhood', 'have', 'good', 'marriage', 'are', 'well-liked', 'extent', 'adventures', 'know', 'limited', 'beer-drinking', 'parties', 'dealing', 'Maggie', 'off-the-wall', 'sister', 'Lisa', '[', 'Ileana', 'Douglas', ']', 'who', 'studying', 'be', 'hypno-therapist.As', 'tale', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'genuinely', 'spooky', 'Tony', 'uncovering', 'ghost', 'terrible', 'secret', 'merely', 'yet', 'more', 'horror', 'are', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'Director', 'David', 'Keopp', ""n't"", 'need', 'great', 'use', 'lightening', 'sound', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'movie', 'most', 'do', 'characterization', 'Tony', 'be', 'indecisive', 'suspect', 'person', 'would', 'usually', 'choose', 'flight', 'fight', 'Maggie', 'so', 'loud', 'agitated', 'when', 'angry', 'idea', 'good', 'marriage', 'little', 'suspect', 'When', 'obvious', 'Tony', 'gone', 'edge', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'try', 'intercede', 'one', 'even', 'much', 'attention', 'Still', 'defects', 'plot', 'structure', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'thrill', 'chill', 'aspects', 'do', 'cause', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'rather', 'great', 'one']",Stir Of Echoes
77704,AAHNPLJ1L109Y,0784013470,Matt M.,"[7, 14]","I was rather looking forward to this film, having read the book and enjoying it very much, as well as having liked David Koepp's previous directorial effort, The Trigger Effect.  Imagine my shock, when by the  halfway point of the movie, I wanted nothing more than for the film to just  be over.The film starts out well enough.  It makes a few changes here  and there, such as the main character being a much more blue collar type  person and the hypnotist being a woman rather than a man.  No problems  there.  The problems come in when the film goes on and there is almost  nothing to develop the supporting characters of the neighbors.  It gets  even worse when it decides to throw cheap shock gimmicks at the audience  rather than use the subtle scares Matheson imbued his novel with.  (The  best examples of the cheap shocks include the oft-repeated shot of the  breaking fingernail, as well as the laughable vision of the boy shooting  himself and then spreading the blood over his face.)Probably the lowest  point of the film is when Koepp decides to introduce the character of the  psychic police officer, who does nothing more than give us information that  we've already figured out on our own.  (And if you hadn't figured it out by  that point, then you surely weren't paying attention to all the clues the  director bashed you over the head with.)By the end, due to the lack of  supporting character development, I had no real concern over which  neighbors did what to whom, nor did I feel the shock I'm sure I was  supposed to have felt.  Instead, I was just glad when the screen darkened  and the credits rolled.I will forever be mystified as to why this film  received so many good reviews.  I just think of it as further evidence of  how David Koepp's screenplays in which he adapts pre-existing material  almost always turn out bad.  (The Lost World, The Shadow, Mission:  Impossible...

77711,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0784013470,Michael Crane,"[14, 16]","Talk about a nail-biting thriller, &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; is a supernatural journey into the unknown.  Brilliantly written and directed, this is a movie that shouldn't be missed by anyone.Kevin Bacon stars as Tom.  Tom is an ordinary man who loves his family and is devoted to his job.  The only thing he wishes is that he wasn't so ordinary.  Everything drastically changes at a neighborhood party when Tom is hypnotized for a brief period of time.  After that unforgettable night, Tom starts seeing things; haunting and violent images that he can't stop or ignore.  He hears things that he cannot block from his eardrums.  Later on, he discovers that what he is witnessing are possible puzzle pieces to an unspeakable crime that took place a while back.  As Tom starts losing it and is determined to solve the unbearable puzzle that haunts him day and night, the more danger he puts him and his family into.In a way, this was the movie that &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; was trying to be.  I felt that this movie was a lot more shocking and haunting.  The movie has great acting and a fabulous screenplay.  This is a movie you may not want to watch late at night, unless you don't mind a nightmare or two.  It's too bad that this movie came out the same time that &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; did, otherwise it would've gotten more recognition; well deserved recognition at that.  There are a few extras on the DVD for those of you who enjoy what special features DVDs have to offer, including a behind the scenes feature, a music video, and a couple of trailers.This is a great thriller that should've gotten a hell of a lot more recognition.  Rent or buy this one as soon as you can.  If you love a dark thriller, then you will not be disappointed.  Be warned; there are some shocking and disturbing images that may be hard to stomach for some; not for those who get disturbed easily.  &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; is filled with thrills and surprises that you won't want to miss.  It also has an excellent plot with a surprising climax.

Has to be done though because even the Director of 'Echoes' - David Koepp (in the DVD commentary add on) makes a indirect (and complimentary) reference to that earlier released movie when he talks about the cold breathe effects used by the director of 'Sixth Sense' - M. Night Shyamalan. To me the titles of the movies could have been exchanged as 'Echoes' plot relies  centrally on the development of this 'sixth sense' by Tom Witzky allowing him to see and hear the afterlife.Back to the present life now and this good movie. Tom (Kevin Bacon), a telephone lineman and his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) are trying to make ends meet, improve the life they share with son Jake (Zachary David Cope) and hold onto their dreams. Tom still wants to be a rock musician but is coming to the realization that mid life responsibilities bring &quot;I never wanted to be famous. I just never expected to be so... &quot;What?&quot; Maggie asks. ...&quot;I don't know. ordinary&quot; Suburban life in America for most of us huh? Not quite. The old adage of being careful of what you wish for applies here. On a drunken dare, with his sister-in-law, Tom states that he can't be hypnotized. She tries, and he is.If the idea of hypnosis allowing you to perceive another reality is really bothersome to you then switch off. That is the central theme of the movie and is what the plot depends on. It's not overly done though and there is no 'message' attached, it's just the vehicle the movie uses to explore the underlying crime and the afterlife. The ghosts that come with it provide the horrific visions and clues that help Tom solve the mystery.Overall the movies plot holds together, the acting is excellent, the horror is subtle, not gory -but scary (Tom watching TV on the couch... being watched...brrr!). It's light on psychology of the afterlife and the disappointments of present-life. It's simply a good, scary thriller.

When I first saw it, I remember thinking, &quot;Is that the one about the little boy who sees dead people?&quot; (yes, it also is, but I was specifically thinking of &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;) or the one about the guy who's wife is worried about him because he suddenly freaks out after a weird encounter?&quot;(yes, it is also, but I was specifically thinking of &quot;The Astronaut's Wife&quot;.)Although it is easy to confuse this title with other similar horror movies- and I suppose that means a comment can be made about its lack of originality in plot- it was a very  unique movie that deserves to be watched for its own merit.  I was amazed at the little boy's performance.  He acted out so many scary things- seeing dead people, talking to them, calming down his dad when he was afraid- in a very convincing manner.  A lot of parts in the movie did exactly what they were intended to do- scared me to death!I didn't give this movie five stars because there were some events that happened that didn't seem to reeappear throughout the rest of the movie so I wondered why they were in there at all.  For example, in the beginning the boy's mother says she is pregnant but there is no mention of a coming baby anywhere throughout the rest of the show.

Whether intentionally or not, the two films resemble each other enormously: the restless dead communicate with a little boy, and an adult is drawn into that communication. ""The Sixth Sense"" (the only truly good thing by director M. Night Shyamalan) is more moody, inventive, and compelling (if a little self-important, like Shyamalan himself); it obviously hit a nerve with audiences and critics. Needless to say, it eclipsed ""Stir of Echoes,"" a decent film but one that treads too well-worn territory. Somehow, the ordinary setting is *too* ordinary. I really didn't care about the dull lives of the characters; they were unappealingly presented. Neither did I care about the ghost, though her victimization in life gave me the same feeling of anger when I hear news items about similar violence against women. The acting is professional but uninspired. It's probably Kevin Bacon's best work, but frankly, that's not saying much. He generally delivers his lines in an uninflected monotone and is stiff throughout; and while Bruce Willis was almost as wooden in ""The Sixth Sense,"" Haley Joel Osment's performance as the prescient child was so overwhelming and expressive that Willis hardly mattered. Here, the kid (played by Zachary David Cope) is almost window dressing so Bacon's dull performance has no help. The direction, by the screenwriter, is unobtrusive at least but it constantly borrows images from other films, often very irritating. Worth a look, but you probably won't want to go back for a second viewing. The extras are plentiful but unbelievably uninteresting. They are presented to look like the analogous features on the DVDs of ""The Ring"" and ""The Sixth Sense.""

Besides, after A Pure Formality and Final Approach, I already knew what the twist in that film would be.  Particularly realistic in Stir of Echoes was the involuntary and unconscious urges, instincts, and blurtings that occured.  When my great grandfather died I did exactly the same thing Bacon's character does at the kitchen table over orange juice.  I was like three at the time.  Ditto when I found out about my sister being pregnant and blurting out ""it's a girl.""  The flashes of red in this film, while not accurate, are a good metaphor for the emotional charges or flashes you perceive.  Do I know what causes this stuff or why I can do this and not others?  Is it dead people causing it?  The zietgeist or whatever?  Can I start describing the way the universe is or prescribing a particular philosophy you should adhere to?  I haven't got a frigg'n clue, but not only is this a well made film, with good acting, photography, music, sound effects, and writing, but it also portrays this phenomenon in a way that makes me think someone involved in its creation had first hand experience with it.

77739,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,0784013470,Ron,"[0, 0]","Stir of Echoes is a well produced movie about the dead communicating with the living called receivers. The witzky family has two receivers under one roof, the dad Tom (Kevin Bacon) and his son Jake (Zachary David Cope) who is more receptive. The wife/mother Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) is unable to see or hear the ghosts and is a major cause of tension between the three. The story is not new to the genre, but it is farily well written and between the direction and acting it is an enjoyable movie to watch. I felt that the movies pacing was a little uneven and lags here and there and there was some missed opportunities that could have made this a great story. My case in point is the lack of follow through with Officer Neil ( Eddie Bo Smith Jr.) and his group of receivers that could have greatly expanded on and added some much need depth and dimention to the story and the supporting cast. Tom is driven to the breaking point after he dares Maggie's friend Lisa (Illeana Douglas) to hypnotize him at a neighbors party that opens a pathway for him to become a receiver. His problems revolve around a teenage girl that had dissappeared 6 moths ago and his visions begin to take control of his life with his sole purpose in life is to find the missing neighborhood girl Samantha (a young Jennifer Morrision) that as I mentioned earlier has caused a strain in his otherwise good marriage. The ending has a couple of twists that do little to change the ending from the old standard to something with a bite to it. All in all its an entertaining average movie with good production values.

77741,AY3AVLL5IWW9,0784013470,Russell Fanelli,"[4, 5]","Other reviewers have mentioned The Sixth Sense as a comparison for Stir of Echoes.  Steven King's The Shining also has some similarities which are worth noting. In all these films a young child is sensitive to the restless spirits who want human intervention to right a wrong.  Additionally, this is the premise of the film Ghost, with Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze.  Stir of Echoes is as believable as the rest of these watchable films.While not as frightening as something like The Exorcist, a classic, Stir of Echoes has fine performances by the entire cast and carefully builds suspense as we watch Kevin Bacon go from doubter in the supernatural to obsessed with finding what happened to a missing girl who haunts him and his young son.The Irish seem particularly interested in ghosts.  W.B. Yeats, perhaps the greatest poet of the 20th century, spent much of his adult life trying to communicate with the spirit world, and had some success, if we are to believe his reports in many of his published works.  More recently, Van Morrison talked about the Irish sensitivity to ghosts in discussing his performance of the great Patrick Kavanaugh song, Raglan Road.  In other words, we are prepared to suspend disbelief in what appears to be absurd because so many gifted people seem to think that contacting the dead is possible.Stir of Echoes also owes a debt to Edgar Allan Poe's superb short story, The Cask of Amontillado.  In his obsession to find the missing girl, Kevin Bacon begins to tear down his house to find her.  At this point the story turns grisly as the dark secret of Poe's story is revealed in this new twist on Poe's orginal idea. The action moves relentlessly to a credible conclusion.This is one of those films that surprise the viewer who may not be expecting to see a well made movie. The direction is tight and the dialogue well written.  The ending makes sense given the careful presentation of the various subplots that have been introduced. Kevin Bacon is the driving force in this film and he shows once again that he deserves to be in the top tier of American actors.",4,"Stir of Echoes, a surprisingly convincing ghost story",1003190400,"10 16, 2001",2001,2098,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'comparison', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Steven', 'King', 'Shining', 'also', 'similarities', 'are', 'worth', 'noting', 'films', 'young', 'child', 'sensitive', 'restless', 'spirits', 'who', 'want', 'human', 'intervention', 'right', 'wrong', 'Additionally', 'premise', 'film', 'Ghost', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'as', 'believable', 'rest', 'watchable', 'films.While', 'not', 'as', 'frightening', 'something', 'Exorcist', 'classic', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'fine', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'carefully', 'builds', 'suspense', 'watch', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'go', 'doubter', 'supernatural', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'what', 'happened', 'missing', 'girl', 'who', 'young', 'son.The', 'Irish', 'seem', 'particularly', 'interested', 'ghosts', 'W.B', 'Yeats', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'poet', '20th', 'century', 'spent', 'much', 'adult', 'life', 'trying', 'communicate', 'spirit', 'world', 'had', 'success', 'are', 'believe', 'reports', 'many', 'published', 'works', 'More', 'recently', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'talked', 'Irish', 'sensitivity', 'ghosts', 'discussing', 'performance', 'great', 'Patrick', 'Kavanaugh', 'song', 'Raglan', 'Road', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'prepared', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'what', 'be', 'absurd', 'so', 'many', 'gifted', 'people', 'seem', 'think', 'contacting', 'dead', 'possible.Stir', 'Echoes', 'also', 'debt', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'superb', 'short', 'story', 'Cask', 'Amontillado', 'obsession', 'find', 'missing', 'girl', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'tear', 'down', 'house', 'find', 'point', 'story', 'grisly', 'dark', 'secret', 'Poe', 'story', 'revealed', 'new', 'twist', 'Poe', 'orginal', 'idea', 'action', 'relentlessly', 'credible', 'conclusion.This', 'one', 'films', 'surprise', 'viewer', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'expecting', 'see', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'direction', 'tight', 'dialogue', 'well', 'written', 'ending', 'sense', 'given', 'careful', 'presentation', 'various', 'subplots', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'top', 'tier', 'American', 'actors']",Stir Of Echoes

Trying to ignore or shake off the phenomenon as the product of a stressed imagination does little good for, as Tom finds out, when the dead want to be heard they can be very persistent.  Released theatrically very close to the time of ""The Sixth Sense"", this movie has suffered from a perception that two 'talking to the dead' movies in one summer would have to be too similar, and that the lower profile one (Stir) would be of a weak quality.  I feel that's a mistake on both parts.  The two movies are similar but certainly not clones of one another, and while I don't feel ""Stir Of Echoes"" reached the heights of ""The Sixth Sense"" it's not weak at all either.

Combining both crime and the supernatural by both the writer and director of the movie Richard Matheson and David Koepp and doing it as well as they did put it a step or two above even the great supernatural movie ""The Sixth Sense"" which ""Stir of Echoes"" is always compared too and was released just about the same time in the summer of 1999.  Unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" there's no slick and tricky ending that will have you want to go back to see the film over again to spot what you missed, the ending of ""Stir of Echoes"" is straight-forward and direct and hits you right between the eyes and unlike the Bruce Willis classic you do see it coming. Renting a house in a Chicago working-class neighborhood Tom Witzky, a telephone worker, and his wife Maggie, Kathryn Erbe, and little boy Jack, Zachary David Cope, seem to be fitting it with those living around them.  Little Jack later seems to be seeing things and talking to himself but that does not bother his parents since they think that it's normal for a little boy to daydream. One night Tom and Maggie go to see Maggie's friend Lisa, Illeana Douglas, who dabbles in the occult and the supernatural and Tom reluctantly agrees to be hypnotized by her and the results opens his mind to a world that he scarcely knew and didn't, up to then, believe in. Like his son Jack Tom has, as it's called in the movie, ""The Eye"" to see disembodied spirits or people and one of the spirits that both he and young Jack see is a young girl Samantha Kozac, Jennifer Morrison, who's been missing since last March when she disappeared from sight. One night Debbie, Liza Well, Samantha's sister was baby-sitting Jack and when she heard him mention Samantha and that he knows where she is Debbie loses it and almost kidnapped Jack in order to have him tell her where she can find her sister.Tom also starts seeing flashes of light and ghostly appearances that become more and more real to the point where his wife Maggie thinks that he's losing his mind and, together with little Jack, almost leaves him. As Tom's mind becomes more tuned in with the astral world, that world that between life and death, he realizes that Samantha is somehow connected with the house he living in and that she did not disappeared last March in some kind of accident but was murdered and that her body was hidden somewhere in the house by her murderer or murderers.  The story is very effective, presented more as a psychological horror film rather than the grisly gore so prevalent in the genre. Numerous comparisons have been made between this film and `The Shining' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind', somehow implying that because this film used some of the effective devices from those films, it is without value. I couldn't disagree more. There is a difference between ripping off a story and adapting effective devices used in other films. This film did the later par extraordinaire. This story used a novel approach to a well plowed genre. It combined the supernatural element with a mystery to produce a powerful hybrid. Forget the comparison with `Sixth Sense'. The only thing these films had in common was dead people.Writer/Director David Koepp did a terrific job in both capacities. The story was plausible, frightening and drew the viewer in. There were some dangling dead end plot lines (Maggie's pregnancy disappeared as a plot element after the announcement; and what was Neil about?) that just wasted our time. But mostly, everything fit together well. The direction was fabulous; designed to scare the hell out of you and that it did. Koepp created incredible suspense without the use of expensive special effects, simply by using the camera and sound effectively. Kevin Bacon was at the top of his game in this film. His obsession with finding Samantha was played with intensity and single mindedness. Kathryn Erbe was also good as Maggie, bringing both strength and passion to the part.  An extremely underrated, underappreciated thriller that rivals many of the late 1990's and early part of the 2000 decade.",4,Stir of Echoes  (1999),1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,4379,"['Director', 'David', 'KoeppCast', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Zachary', 'David', 'Cope', 'Kathryne', 'Erbe', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'Conor', ""O'Farrell"", 'Lusia', 'Strus', 'Stephen', 'Eugene', 'Walker.Running', 'Time', '99', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'language', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'more', 'very', 'good', 'murder/mystery', 'thriller', 'then', 'film', 'paranormal', 'Combining', 'crime', 'supernatural', 'writer', 'director', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'David', 'Koepp', 'doing', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'put', 'step', 'two', 'even', 'great', 'supernatural', 'movie', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'always', 'compared', 'too', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'same', 'time', 'summer', '1999', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'slick', 'tricky', 'ending', 'will', 'have', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'spot', 'what', 'missed', 'ending', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'straight-forward', 'direct', 'right', 'eyes', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'classic', 'do', 'see', 'coming', 'Renting', 'house', 'Chicago', 'working-class', 'neighborhood', 'Tom', 'Witzky', 'telephone', 'worker', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'little', 'boy', 'Jack', 'Zachary', 'David', 'Cope', 'seem', 'be', 'fitting', 'living', 'around', 'Little', 'Jack', 'later', 'be', 'seeing', 'things', 'talking', 'not', 'bother', 'parents', 'think', 'normal', 'little', 'boy', 'daydream', 'One', 'night', 'Tom', 'Maggie', 'go', 'see', 'Maggie', 'friend', 'Lisa', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'who', 'occult', 'supernatural', 'Tom', 'reluctantly', 'be', 'hypnotized', 'results', 'mind', 'world', 'scarcely', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'up', 'then', 'believe', 'son', 'Jack', 'Tom', 'called', 'movie', 'Eye', 'see', 'disembodied', 'spirits', 'people', 'one', 'spirits', 'young', 'Jack', 'see', 'young', 'girl', 'Samantha', 'Kozac', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'who', 'been', 'missing', 'last', 'March', 'when', 'disappeared', 'sight', 'One', 'night', 'Debbie', 'Liza', 'Well', 'Samantha', 'sister', 'was', 'baby-sitting', 'Jack', 'when', 'heard', 'mention', 'Samantha', 'where', 'Debbie', 'almost', 'kidnapped', 'Jack', 'order', 'have', 'tell', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'sister.Tom', 'also', 'seeing', 'flashes', 'light', 'ghostly', 'appearances', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'real', 'point', 'where', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'losing', 'mind', 'together', 'little', 'Jack', 'almost', 'Tom', 'mind', 'more', 'tuned', 'astral', 'world', 'world', 'life', 'death', 'Samantha', 'somehow', 'connected', 'house', 'living', 'did', 'not', 'disappeared', 'last', 'March', 'kind', 'accident', 'was', 'murdered', 'body', 'was', 'hidden', 'somewhere', 'house', 'murderer', 'murderers', 'story', 'very', 'effective', 'presented', 'more', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'rather', 'grisly', 'gore', 'so', 'prevalent', 'genre', 'Numerous', 'comparisons', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'Shining', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'somehow', 'implying', 'film', 'used', 'effective', 'devices', 'films', 'value', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'difference', 'ripping', 'off', 'story', 'adapting', 'effective', 'devices', 'used', 'other', 'films', 'film', 'did', 'later', 'par', 'extraordinaire', 'story', 'used', 'novel', 'approach', 'well', 'plowed', 'genre', 'combined', 'supernatural', 'element', 'mystery', 'produce', 'powerful', 'hybrid', 'Forget', 'comparison', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'only', 'thing', 'films', 'had', 'common', 'was', 'dead', 'people.Writer/Director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'capacities', 'story', 'was', 'plausible', 'frightening', 'drew', 'viewer', 'were', 'dangling', 'dead', 'end', 'plot', 'lines', 'Maggie', 'pregnancy', 'disappeared', 'plot', 'element', 'announcement', 'what', 'was', 'Neil', 'just', 'wasted', 'time', 'mostly', 'everything', 'fit', 'together', 'well', 'direction', 'was', 'fabulous', 'designed', 'scare', 'hell', 'did', 'Koepp', 'created', 'incredible', 'suspense', 'use', 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'simply', 'using', 'camera', 'sound', 'effectively', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'film', 'obsession', 'finding', 'Samantha', 'was', 'played', 'intensity', 'single', 'mindedness', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'Maggie', 'bringing', 'strength', 'passion', 'part', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'underappreciated', 'thriller', 'many', 'late', '1990', 'early', 'part', '2000', 'decade']",Stir Of Echoes

77765,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,0784013470,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","This sounds incredible, but it took almost six years for 'Stir of Echoes' to arrive in theaters in Japan, and the reason for this delay is, I believe, the film's accidental resemblance with 'The Sixth Sense.'  Well, but many people have already pointed that out, so let's not talk about it now.  Maybe I should talk about how thrilling this thriller can be.Kevin Bacon gives strong acting as Tom, who is hypnotized for a lark by his sister-in-law, and starts to see things.  And he realizes that his only son also has the same ability to see.  The only difference is that his son is able to see clearer, even people -- particularly, a girl named Samantha.  Tom's new ability results in his obsession with the girl, or the truths behind the images, and guided by the strange images, his quest leads him to the unexpected place where the key is hidden.'Stir of Echoes' is directed by David Koepp, whose track record as writer (before 'Stir') include 'Carlito's Way' 'Mission Impossible' (with Robert Towne), 'The Lost World' and 'Snake Eyes.'  Impressive record?  Innovative writing?  I don't think so.  And I didn't mention 'The Trigger Effect' which he also directed, or 'The Secret Window' he is to direct later.  To his credit, none of these films stink; they all have something to offer.  However, none of them shows outstanding qualities, perhaps except the visuals.Like these films, 'Stir of Echoes' starts with great premise, and solidly develops the idea in the middle of the story (slightly overstepping here and there), and ... here's the important part ... ends with a weak, predictable conclusion.  Not that this thriller is not entertaining.  I'm only talking about the weakness of the last act.  I admit the visuals are often impressive (Tom's consciousness while hypnotized is brilliantly expressed).  And the strong acting from the two leads Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe as Tom's wife make up for that ... almost.So what should I say if you have not seen it?  Should I recommend?  Yes.  But do not try to find a big secret in the ending, which avid thriller fans can foresee from miles away.  After all David Koepp is the guy who has also co-written the script of Tom Cruise's 'War of the World' (with Josh Friedman), and what you find here is spooky images and often disturbing scenes, not a surprise ending.  But perhaps this kind of thriller of which atmosphere matters most, does not need it.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Seeing Things, Hearing Voices: Slick Occult Thriller from David Koepp",1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2411,"['incredible', 'took', 'almost', 'six', 'years', ""'Stir"", 'Echoes', 'arrive', 'theaters', 'Japan', 'reason', 'delay', 'believe', 'film', 'accidental', 'resemblance', ""'The"", 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Well', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'let', 'not', 'talk', 'now', 'Maybe', 'should', 'talk', 'how', 'thrilling', 'thriller', 'can', 'be.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'strong', 'acting', 'Tom', 'who', 'hypnotized', 'lark', 'sister-in-law', 'see', 'things', 'only', 'son', 'also', 'same', 'ability', 'see', 'only', 'difference', 'son', 'able', 'see', 'clearer', 'even', 'people', 'particularly', 'girl', 'named', 'Samantha', 'Tom', 'new', 'ability', 'results', 'obsession', 'girl', 'truths', 'images', 'guided', 'strange', 'images', 'quest', 'unexpected', 'place', 'where', 'key', 'hidden', ""'Stir"", 'Echoes', 'directed', 'David', 'Koepp', 'track', 'record', 'writer', ""'Stir"", 'include', 'Way', ""'Mission"", 'Impossible', 'Robert', 'Towne', 'Lost', 'World', ""'Snake"", 'Eyes', 'Impressive', 'record', 'Innovative', 'writing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Trigger', 'Effect', 'also', 'directed', 'Secret', 'Window', 'direct', 'later', 'credit', 'none', 'films', 'stink', 'have', 'something', 'offer', 'However', 'none', 'outstanding', 'qualities', 'perhaps', 'visuals.Like', 'films', ""'Stir"", 'Echoes', 'starts', 'great', 'premise', 'solidly', 'idea', 'middle', 'story', 'slightly', 'overstepping', 'here', 'there', 'here', 'important', 'part', 'weak', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'Not', 'thriller', 'not', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'only', 'talking', 'weakness', 'last', 'act', 'admit', 'visuals', 'are', 'often', 'impressive', 'Tom', 'consciousness', 'hypnotized', 'brilliantly', 'expressed', 'strong', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'Tom', 'wife', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'should', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Should', 'recommend', 'Yes', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'find', 'big', 'secret', 'ending', 'avid', 'thriller', 'fans', 'can', 'foresee', 'miles', 'away', 'David', 'Koepp', 'guy', 'who', 'also', 'co-written', 'script', 'Tom', 'Cruise', ""'War"", 'World', 'Josh', 'Friedman', 'what', 'find', 'here', 'spooky', 'images', 'often', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'not', 'surprise', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'kind', 'thriller', 'atmosphere', 'matters', 'most', 'not', 'need']",Stir Of Echoes
77766,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,0784013470,Turfseer,"[5, 10]","I disagree strongly with director and writer David Koepp's belief that he was successful in depicting true-to-life working-class characters from Chicago in ""Stir of Echoes"". There is something very unlikeable and unrealistic about most of the characters in this film. The thing that bothers me the most is the foul language. When Kathyrn Erbe (who plays the wife, Maggie) confronts Tom (played by Kevin Bacon), she crudely confronts him over his vision of a woman who's been haunting their house; she blurts out, ""Did you f--k her?"" Not only does this unsubtle, heavy-handed type of dialogue crop up way too often during the film (and spoken by too many of the characters), it also makes the characters wholly unsympathetic. Don't any of them have any wit or a sense of humor or are they all crude boors who like to get into arguments with one another?Koepp based 'Stir of Echoes' on a 1958 tale by Richard Matheson (of Twilight Zone fame). The inciting incident, where Tom is hypnotized and begins seeing visions seems quite dated. Hypnosis might have been a big thing for a movie audience in 1958 but by the late 90s it's old hat! I would have liked to have seen something a little more clever and original to propel Tom into his supernatural world.Many of the characters' actions in this film are way too over the top. I didn't quite believe that the babysitter would kidnap Jake simply because she heard him talking about her missing sister. Most normal teenagers would have calmly told their parents about their suspicions and the parents could have then contacted the police to investigate. Perhaps the most unbelievable part of the film is Maggie's reaction to Tom's obsessions. She visits her friend the hypnotist who advises her to ""get help"" for Tom; but she never follows through. She decides to do everything on her own. Even if you believe that she never notices anything peculiar about her child's behavior (especially Jake telling her to hire the babysitter), she totally ignores everything the psychic cop tells her (spelling it out that her husband has partial psychic powers and the son is fully psychic). She goes home and ends up having another argument with Tom over his visions. It's just too unbelievable that she continues to believe Tom is out of his mind.Koepp implies that Maggie fears humiliation from her working class friends if word gets out that Tom has lost his marbles and that's why she gains no insight into what's going on. I don't really buy it given all the clues put in front of her but even if one accepts Koepp's scenario, a real person probably would have gone for some outside help.Koepp settles for some over the top banter between husband and wife with Tom insisting that Maggie has been trying to stop him from discovering ""the most important thing in my life"". In the silliest scene in the movie, Kevin Bacon, sounding like someone who forgot to take his medication, repeats ""I won't stop"" three times as Maggie tries to get him to stop digging up the body. Koepp needs a device to get Maggie out of the house so Tom is left alone for the killers to appear and try and do him in. So out of the blue, Maggie's mother dies and she takes Jake and leaves the house.Even way before the resolution where the bad guys are dispatched, it seems pretty obvious that a bunch of locals killed the missing girl so I didn't find the film's denouement very gripping. There are a few scenes in ""Stir of Echoes"" that are too drawn out. Koepp could have cut about 10 minutes from the exposition before the hypnosis scene. The same goes for all the digging Kevin Bacon was doing at the end.Koepp has certainly made a name for himself in Hollywood, penning the the two Spielberg films, 'War of the Worlds' and 'Indiana Jones', which showed a marked improvement over the insufferable ""Spiderman"". Now that he is a prime player in Hollywood, perhaps he might consider tackling subject matter that is intellectually on a higher plane.Certainly 'Stir of Echoes', his earlier effort, will never enter the pantheon of memorable films in the future.",2,A Crass 'Mystic River' meets 'The Sixth Sense' (without the twist),1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,4070,"['disagree', 'strongly', 'director', 'writer', 'David', 'Koepp', 'belief', 'was', 'successful', 'depicting', 'true-to-life', 'working-class', 'characters', 'Chicago', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'something', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'unrealistic', 'most', 'characters', 'film', 'thing', 'bothers', 'most', 'foul', 'language', 'When', 'Kathyrn', 'Erbe', 'who', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'confronts', 'Tom', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'crudely', 'vision', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'haunting', 'house', 'out', 'Did', 'f', 'k', 'Not', 'only', 'unsubtle', 'heavy-handed', 'type', 'dialogue', 'crop', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'film', 'spoken', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'also', 'characters', 'wholly', 'unsympathetic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wit', 'sense', 'humor', 'are', 'crude', 'boors', 'who', 'like', 'get', 'arguments', 'one', 'Koepp', 'based', ""'Stir"", 'Echoes', '1958', 'tale', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'fame', 'inciting', 'incident', 'where', 'Tom', 'hypnotized', 'seeing', 'visions', 'quite', 'dated', 'Hypnosis', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'thing', 'movie', 'audience', '1958', 'late', '90s', 'old', 'hat', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'clever', 'original', 'propel', 'Tom', 'supernatural', 'world.Many', 'characters', 'actions', 'film', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believe', 'babysitter', 'would', 'kidnap', 'Jake', 'simply', 'heard', 'talking', 'missing', 'sister', 'Most', 'normal', 'teenagers', 'would', 'have', 'calmly', 'told', 'parents', 'suspicions', 'parents', 'could', 'have', 'then', 'contacted', 'police', 'investigate', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'part', 'film', 'Maggie', 'reaction', 'Tom', 'obsessions', 'friend', 'hypnotist', 'who', 'get', 'help', 'Tom', 'never', 'through', 'do', 'everything', 'own', 'Even', 'believe', 'never', 'anything', 'peculiar', 'child', 'behavior', 'especially', 'Jake', 'telling', 'hire', 'babysitter', 'totally', 'everything', 'psychic', 'cop', 'spelling', 'out', 'husband', 'partial', 'psychic', 'powers', 'son', 'fully', 'psychic', 'home', 'up', 'having', 'argument', 'Tom', 'visions', 'just', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'believe', 'Tom', 'mind.Koepp', 'implies', 'Maggie', 'humiliation', 'working', 'class', 'friends', 'word', 'out', 'Tom', 'lost', 'marbles', 'why', 'gains', 'insight', 'what', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'given', 'clues', 'put', 'front', 'even', 'one', 'Koepp', 'scenario', 'real', 'person', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'outside', 'help.Koepp', 'settles', 'top', 'banter', 'husband', 'wife', 'Tom', 'insisting', 'Maggie', 'been', 'trying', 'stop', 'discovering', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'silliest', 'scene', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'sounding', 'someone', 'who', 'forgot', 'take', 'medication', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'three', 'times', 'Maggie', 'get', 'stop', 'digging', 'up', 'body', 'Koepp', 'device', 'get', 'Maggie', 'house', 'Tom', 'left', 'alone', 'killers', 'appear', 'try', 'do', 'blue', 'Maggie', 'mother', 'dies', 'Jake', 'house.Even', 'way', 'resolution', 'where', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'dispatched', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'bunch', 'locals', 'killed', 'missing', 'girl', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'denouement', 'very', 'gripping', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'are', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'Koepp', 'could', 'have', 'cut', '10', 'minutes', 'exposition', 'hypnosis', 'scene', 'same', 'digging', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'doing', 'end.Koepp', 'certainly', 'made', 'name', 'Hollywood', 'penning', 'two', 'Spielberg', 'films', ""'War"", 'Worlds', ""'Indiana"", 'Jones', 'showed', 'marked', 'improvement', 'insufferable', 'Spiderman', 'Now', 'prime', 'player', 'Hollywood', 'perhaps', 'might', 'consider', 'tackling', 'subject', 'matter', 'intellectually', 'higher', 'plane.Certainly', ""'Stir"", 'Echoes', 'earlier', 'effort', 'will', 'never', 'enter', 'pantheon', 'memorable', 'films', 'future']",Stir Of Echoes

77770,A2S2QOH5JERUV7,0784013470,William,"[1, 1]","Stir of Echoes is a supernatural thriller starring Kevin Bacon.  When it was realeased in theaters it was percieved as a Sixth Sense wannabe but it is actually a very good film now that it can be viewed on its own.  Based on the story by Richard Matheson (who was an influence on Stephen King), it is the story of average guy Tom Witzky (Bacon in an outstanding performance) who lives in a working class Chicago neighborhood and undergoes hypnotizm at a party.  That experience changes him and now he has visions and intuitive feelings that understandably begin to creep him out, particularly since he did not believe in the supernatural until this stuff started happening to him.  The mystery he uncovers is not that complex but it is still suspenseful to see unfold.  His new insight drives him to behave in eratic ways putting stress on his wife and son but leading to eerie results.  I think that family relationship is the most interesting part of the film.  In hindsight this movie has only a couple of similarities with Sixth Sense:  a kid who talks to the dead; a ghost that wants something from the living.  But it also has much in common with Stephen King's work (and probably a number of other ghost stories).  I think some of the photography prefigures the interest in Japanese horror films here in America.  And setting the film in Chicago was an interesting choice as well.
