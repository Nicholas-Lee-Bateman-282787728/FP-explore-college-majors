1352848,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B003L77GTC,A. Estes,"[3, 3]","For better or worse, Showtime's hit series, ""Weeds,"" has certainly changed over the years. As each episode twists and turns, the Botwin clan (led by the indispensable Mary Louise Parker) -- as well as the show -- somehow manages to adapt and evolve in ways that are truer to real life than the average drama, despite the extreme situations they often find themselves in. At this point, you really have to love and identify with the core characters to really enjoy the show. Sure, they may not be living in little boxes selling little baggies, but you can sure bet there is enough juice left in this dramatic-comedy to leave you drooling for the next season by the time this one wraps up in typical cliffhanger fashion.True to form, season six of the show finds the family in yet another setting; this time the Botwins are on the run thanks to some misbehavior by the budding psychopath Shane (Alexander Gould) at the end of season five. With the engagement of Uncle Andy (Justin Kirk) dissolving, he decides to tag along, as per usual. Together they flee from Nancy's husband (Demi&aacute;n Bichir) and commence upon a road-trip that takes them through Seattle to the Midwest, where the family business turns to selling hash and the Botwins actually (gasp!) get jobs. One particularly amusing detour finds the clan blending in with a commune of fellow fugitives while Nancy gets a Zack Attack from Mark-Paul Gosselar and Andy seems to have found his blessed calling. The season wraps up with the family unearthing some major secrets in Michigan while reconnecting with an old friend (Richard Dreyfuss) and ultimately devising a plan to flee the country altogether for what a quaint paradise that seems inevitably out of reach.Like seasons before, season six of ""Weeds"" is almost as addicting as the drugs its characters peddle. It'd be so easy to knock out all 13 episodes in one-sitting, and you can chalk that up to good writing and phenomenal performances by the cast. Although certain characters are left behind (most notably Celia Hodes, as portrayed by Elizabeth Perkins), the core group more than compensates. Parker is excellent as always playing the sometimes selfish and sometimes oblivious mother than you can't help but feel sorry for. Although most of the narrative is driven by the actions of Shane, it is big-brother Silas (Hunter Parrish) who is finally given a bit more depth and the show feels the stronger for it. Kevin Nealon returns as Doug, a wholly useless character in the scheme of things, but it's great to have him along for the ride and Nealon delivers solid chuckles throughout, as always. Other noteable appearances come from the likes of Linda Hamilton, Peter Stormare and Patrick Fischler.Season six of ""Weeds"" is best appreciated with the knowledge that you can never go back. Agrestic was left for dead three seasons ago, and hoping for a return to form will only lead to disappointment. Rest assured, these 13 episodes will keep you on your toes while simultaneously beefing up some of the principal characters (yes, even Doug). If creator Jenji Kohan is to be believed and season seven truly is the last, then you can bet it'll go out with a bang and that many of the detractors of these last few seasons will miss it when it's gone.",4,Road Trippin' with the Botwins...er... the Newmans.,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,3269,"['better', 'worse', 'Showtime', 'hit', 'series', 'Weeds', 'certainly', 'changed', 'years', 'episode', 'twists', 'turns', 'Botwin', 'clan', 'led', 'indispensable', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'somehow', 'adapt', 'evolve', 'ways', 'are', 'truer', 'real', 'life', 'average', 'drama', 'extreme', 'situations', 'often', 'find', 'point', 'really', 'have', 'love', 'identify', 'core', 'characters', 'really', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Sure', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'living', 'little', 'boxes', 'selling', 'little', 'baggies', 'can', 'sure', 'bet', 'enough', 'juice', 'left', 'dramatic-comedy', 'leave', 'drooling', 'next', 'season', 'time', 'one', 'up', 'typical', 'cliffhanger', 'fashion.True', 'form', 'season', 'six', 'show', 'family', 'yet', 'setting', 'time', 'Botwins', 'are', 'run', 'thanks', 'misbehavior', 'budding', 'psychopath', 'Shane', 'Alexander', 'Gould', 'end', 'season', 'five', 'engagement', 'Uncle', 'Andy', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'dissolving', 'tag', 'along', 'usual', 'Together', 'flee', 'Nancy', 'husband', 'Demi', 'aacute', 'Bichir', 'commence', 'road-trip', 'Seattle', 'Midwest', 'where', 'family', 'business', 'selling', 'hash', 'Botwins', 'actually', 'gasp', 'get', 'jobs', 'One', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'detour', 'clan', 'blending', 'commune', 'fellow', 'fugitives', 'Nancy', 'Zack', 'Attack', 'Mark-Paul', 'Gosselar', 'Andy', 'have', 'found', 'blessed', 'calling', 'season', 'up', 'family', 'unearthing', 'major', 'secrets', 'Michigan', 'reconnecting', 'old', 'friend', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'ultimately', 'devising', 'plan', 'flee', 'country', 'altogether', 'what', 'quaint', 'paradise', 'inevitably', 'reach.Like', 'seasons', 'season', 'six', 'Weeds', 'almost', 'as', 'addicting', 'drugs', 'characters', 'peddle', ""'d"", 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'knock', 'out', '13', 'episodes', 'one-sitting', 'can', 'chalk', 'up', 'good', 'writing', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'cast', 'certain', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'most', 'notably', 'Celia', 'Hodes', 'portrayed', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'core', 'group', 'more', 'compensates', 'Parker', 'excellent', 'always', 'playing', 'sometimes', 'selfish', 'sometimes', 'oblivious', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'most', 'narrative', 'driven', 'actions', 'Shane', 'big-brother', 'Silas', 'Hunter', 'Parrish', 'who', 'finally', 'given', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'show', 'stronger', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Doug', 'wholly', 'useless', 'character', 'scheme', 'things', 'great', 'have', 'along', 'ride', 'Nealon', 'delivers', 'solid', 'chuckles', 'always', 'Other', 'noteable', 'appearances', 'come', 'likes', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Patrick', 'Fischler.Season', 'six', 'Weeds', 'best', 'appreciated', 'knowledge', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'Agrestic', 'was', 'left', 'dead', 'three', 'seasons', 'ago', 'hoping', 'return', 'form', 'will', 'only', 'lead', 'disappointment', 'Rest', 'assured', '13', 'episodes', 'will', 'keep', 'toes', 'simultaneously', 'beefing', 'up', 'principal', 'characters', 'yes', 'even', 'Doug', 'creator', 'Jenji', 'Kohan', 'be', 'believed', 'season', 'seven', 'truly', 'last', 'then', 'can', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'many', 'detractors', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'will', 'miss', 'when', 'gone']",N/A

1352852,A3H0LDBQ5G3ANL,B003L77GTC,"Brian Moore ""kibogami""","[8, 12]","The first two episodes of this season really almost did me in as a fan. It was so obvious that the show didn't know where to go. This is something that has cropped up here and there , in all of the earlier seasons , except perhaps the first. A good example would be the sudden, unlikely death of U-Turn. In fact, in my opinion, the writing on this show has ALWAYS been a little on the uneven side. The most popular three solutions to problems as they come bearing down on Nancy....the DEA, Nancy f's someone or someone dies...or sometimes all three, as in the case of Peter.I stuck with it this particular season and at times I thought "" cool , they're back, this is going to be great"".  Unfortuneatly, it never really delivered anything solid or even very memorable other than maybe the conclusion.I thought the show was very stale towards the end of the 5th season , again , other than the finale. Going on the run gave the show a real chance to settle, well , anywhere , really. My imagination soared at the concept of the clan somewhere a little different, such as Canada or Seattle. A chance to recapture some of that magic of the first two seasons without the repetitive, overbearing seriousness of her ascent through the higher ranks. Face it, Nancy was at her best when she was still a small fish.I couldn't help but feel that the writers did not have an end game for the 6th season and didn't really expect a 7th season. It seemed everytime they ran out of quick laugh type scenarios...they moved them down the road. Finally, another option other than death, the DEA and/or sex...just move on. I really wonder if this is an option we may need to consider as fans, in order to preserve the memory of a once overwhelmingly fantastic, unique and innovative show.I am starting to look at this show as Weeds : season 1-3, and Weeds Lite: Season 4&5 and now Sorta-Like-Weeds: now with less of a plot and fewer laughs BUT at least the scenary changes",3,"Long time fan, first time reviewer",1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,1952,"['first', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'really', 'almost', 'did', 'fan', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'go', 'something', 'cropped', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'perhaps', 'first', 'good', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'sudden', 'unlikely', 'death', 'U-Turn', 'fact', 'opinion', 'writing', 'show', 'ALWAYS', 'been', 'little', 'uneven', 'side', 'most', 'popular', 'three', 'solutions', 'problems', 'come', 'bearing', 'down', 'Nancy', '.the', 'DEA', 'Nancy', 'f', 'someone', 'someone', 'dies', 'sometimes', 'three', 'case', 'Peter.I', 'stuck', 'particular', 'season', 'times', 'thought', 'cool', ""'re"", 'back', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'Unfortuneatly', 'never', 'really', 'delivered', 'anything', 'solid', 'even', 'very', 'memorable', 'other', 'maybe', 'conclusion.I', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'stale', 'end', '5th', 'season', 'again', 'other', 'finale', 'Going', 'run', 'gave', 'show', 'real', 'chance', 'settle', 'well', 'anywhere', 'really', 'imagination', 'soared', 'concept', 'clan', 'somewhere', 'little', 'different', 'such', 'Canada', 'Seattle', 'chance', 'recapture', 'magic', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'repetitive', 'overbearing', 'seriousness', 'ascent', 'higher', 'ranks', 'Face', 'Nancy', 'was', 'best', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'small', 'fish.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'writers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'end', 'game', '6th', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', '7th', 'season', 'seemed', 'everytime', 'ran', 'quick', 'laugh', 'type', 'scenarios', 'moved', 'down', 'road', 'Finally', 'option', 'other', 'death', 'DEA', 'and/or', 'sex', 'just', 'move', 'really', 'wonder', 'option', 'may', 'need', 'consider', 'fans', 'order', 'preserve', 'memory', 'once', 'overwhelmingly', 'fantastic', 'unique', 'innovative', 'show.I', 'am', 'starting', 'look', 'show', 'Weeds', 'season', '1-3', 'Weeds', 'Lite', 'Season', '4', '5', 'now', 'Sorta-Like-Weeds', 'now', 'less', 'plot', 'fewer', 'laughs', 'BUT', 'least', 'scenary', 'changes']",N/A
1352853,A2EO3TWW174F7P,B003L77GTC,"Cameron Dimez ""GM Custom Jewelry Owner""","[17, 18]","Warning: contains mild spoilers.Weeds first started out simply, pot-dealing soccer mom Nancy Botwin tries to make ends meet by introducing the herb in her suburb. However, as Nancy finds her way crawling up the drug-world grapevine, danger and comedy are ensured.This season was one of the 'lesser' seasons, it did lack focus and seemed like a real road trip at times. The season begins to pick up once Nancy returns to her hometown, ready to flee the country to escape the Mexican Mafia, FBI and her husband who wants her head on a pike, Esteban (Demain Bichir), and his betrayed henchman, Guillermo (Guillermo Diaz).From Seattle to Colorado and Michigan, we follow the Botwin's on an escape, living off the lam since Shane (Alexander Gould) bludgeoned Mexican VIP and queenpin, Pilar Zuazo (Kate Del Castillo) after she makes her intentions clear in season five's shocking finale.I like to grade the series by episode for a full analysis of the season.Episode 1: Thwack!Fleeing Ren Mar during the aftermath proves to be difficult for Nancy & co. Andy cuts it off with Audra (special guest star Alanis Morissette) and Nancy and her family begin their life on the run. (B+)Episode 2: Felling and SwampingThe Botwin's assume new identities and head north to hide from Esteban, now on hot pursuit of them. (B+)Episode 3: A Yippity SippityStarting over in Seattle proves hard for the Botwin's as they try to manage their double lives. Silas (Hunter Parish), Nancy (Mary Louise Parker) and Andy (Justin Kirk) get jobs at a Space Needle hotel. Oh, and Shane steals a baby stroller for Stevie/Ahvi! (A-)Episode 4: BlissNancy gets back into dealing and makes two new friends, a pot-growing lesbian couple (guest starring Linda Hamilton and Sugar). Low on money, she gets a new idea, bubble hash. Nancy's mind just never stops. (A)Episode 5: BoomerangOne of the best episodes of the series. It had a multi-flustercluck involving Latrice, a hotel maid who finds out Nancy's secret, and Shane gets some blowback from confining in housewives with no lives. Which you should never trust anyway. Seriously. (A+)Episode 6: A Shoe for a ShoeA somewhat disappointing conclusion to Shane being kidnapped by Cesar, but overall a strong episode. Ties everything up and feels kind of like a mid-season finale. (B+)Episode 7: Pinwheels and WhirligigsA rather plain, and in my opinion the worst episode of the series. Fluffy and light, it lacked the darkness that has been lingering around the Botwin's. Oh, and Doug (Kevin Nealon) officially is freed and with the Botwins. (C)Episode 8: Gentle PuppiesForging new identities, the Botwin's become the newest born-again's in Pioneer City 2010. Nancy makes a new friend, and ends up letting her sex drive ruin the Botwin's plans. (B)Episode 9: To Moscow, and QuicklyProblems with Stevie make Nancy more self-conscious about her questionable decisions and parenting styles. Andy proposes they leave the country... and the plot begins to thicken. The FBI remains to keep an eye out for Nancy. (B+)Episode 10: Dearborn-AgainNancy reunites with her eccentric pedophile math teacher who has obsessed about her since she was 15, Mr. Shiff (Richard Dreyfuss) and Shane and Silas start to dig into how Nancy was as a kid. (B+)Episode 11: Viking PrideSilas comes to a revelation after learning Judah (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) might not be his real father. Andy creates a new drug, and the search for passports begins (A)Episode 12: Fran TarkentonThe crap starts to hit the fan for Nancy, as she no longer has anywhere to run. The whole family is ready to leave the country... but not without Nancy. (A)Episode 13: Theoretical Love is Not DeadIn this twisty season finale, Nancy makes a decision to finally bring everything full circle. Gin Wigmore's ""Hey Ho"" plays in an unforgettable montage. Excellent finale. (A+)Season 6 had some strong episodes, but overall lacked a focus. I like how they came full-circle with the final 4 episodes. Season 7 will begin in Summer of 2011.Also, I couldn't help but miss Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) and her family (Allie Grant & Andy Midler) after they built her up last season to rival with Nancy.Overall score: 87% B+Rated: TV-MA; Strong sexual content, course language, adult situations, violence and mature content including drug references.",4,Let's BLOW this joint!

It is an entirely different season, as it is driven by increasing more suspenseful plot lines, several of which are very good, clever and quite successful.The series really moves away from its ""mom sells pot"" genesis and becomes a bit of a ""buddy / road"" movie. Which is OK, its just different.Where it really shines is the performances of Andy, Silas and Shane. They all have much more to work with. Andy, as always, is given the best dialogue. Shane and Silas really develop a rapport and have some important plot contributions. The Nancy character is fine, but becomes (in our opinion) ever more detestable! Hey, its not bad acting, just a bad character in the middle of an entertaining situation. Doug is along for the ride and several previous Weeds characters make cameo appearances.Other reviewers mention ""poor writing"" but I think they are missing the point, or don't know what they are talking about.

Nancy isn't scrubbing toilets for long until she finds a way to start dealing to the hotel guests in search of weed. Linda Hamilton makes an amusing appearance as a no-nonsense lesbian dealer, and nails the delivery of every line she has.Andy, Doug and Silus practice trailer-park evangelism when the gang has a stop-over in Montana. Dale Dickey makes a small but terrific appearance as does Mark-Paul Gosselaar (he has a bare-buns scene having hate-sex with Nancy).Celia disappears this season, and as much as I love Elizabeth Perkins, the plots and guest characters make up for her absence--I didn't miss her near as much as I thought I would.The cliffhanger season-finale is something this series has almost always done to perfection (save for the burning of Agrestic in Season 3--it just wasn't gripping or suspenseful enough for me) and Season 6 does not disappoint.Like the cover art says ""Weeds is still smokin'"" and I whole-heartedly agree.

She's held at gunpoint, her DEA husband is murdered, and she begins to pay a debt to a drug dealer named U-Turn, who eventually dies. Her neighborhood of Agrestic (a high-class suburban neighborhood that she has pretty much dominated over the years) burns down in a wildfire which she inadvertently, sorta-kinda caused. She then moves with her family down to Ren-Mar where she begins trafficking drugs for the Mexican mafia. She falls in love with Esteban Reyes, a mayor of Tijuana. She discovers that her cover business is being used for human trafficking, so she squeals to the DEA, and the tunnel is shut down. People find out that she squealed, so she is almost killed, and then BAM - she's pregnant with Esteban's baby. So, she has the baby, gets married to him, and begins to settle down into her new life. Soon, she discovers that there's a woman named Pilar Zuazo who is Esteban's boss, who wants Nancy out of the picture. Tension between them ensues for quite some time, and then in the finale, Nancy's 13-year-old son Shane kills Pilar, knocking her in the head with a croquet mallet, leaving her to fall into a swimming pool, and bleed from the head, to death.So, here we are, season six. Nancy and the family are on the lam again, and they stay on the lam through out the whole season, while Esteban and his crew are on their tail through out practically the whole thing. Like every season of Weeds, this one has a few slow-burning episodes in the middle of the season, that leads to an eventual spectacular finale, that makes you excited to see where it will go from here. Throughout the season, Nancy and her family settle in Seattle, each of them working minimum wage in a hotel. They then go to Nancy's hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. They impersonate religious fundamentalists, Nancy hooks up with the guy who played Zack Morris on Saved by the Bell, Silas has his long-overdue college experience, and the family makes some big plans.One thing that I love about this season is that every character is brought into some kind of illumination. Each character realizes how crazy the things they've done over the years are, and what kind of person they become because of their actions. Especially Nancy, who has seriously tricked fate over the years, she (finally) takes responsibility for her actions, and realizes what kind of person her actions have made her. And, we (the audience) realizes that she has always been a wild card, making decisions that are risky and possibly self-destructive. I won't elaborate more, other than saying that the season ends with a selfless act that makes Nancy a much more likable character in the long run.One thing that I really didn't like about this season, is that Elizabeth Perkins' character Celia isn't around anymore, when Kevin Nealon's Doug is still on the show, for what reason, I don't know. While Celia's story was getting lame over the years, they gave her a great cliffhanger in season five, which will probably never be resolved. And, at certain points in the season, the direction feels kind of aimless, like they don't know where to go with what they have. However, that proves to be untrue, as the season progresses.Bring on season 7!",5,Weeds Season Six - Still strong,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,3486,"['Weeds', 'certainly', 'changed', 'alot', 'years', 'started', 'out', 'poor', 'widow', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'secretly', 'dealing', 'dime', 'bags', 'suburban', 'neighbors', 'then', 'started', 'carrying', 'DEA', 'agent', 'who', 'then', 'grow', 'marijuana', 'sell', 'own', 'strain', 'held', 'gunpoint', 'DEA', 'husband', 'murdered', 'pay', 'debt', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'U-Turn', 'who', 'eventually', 'neighborhood', 'Agrestic', 'high-class', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'pretty', 'much', 'dominated', 'years', 'burns', 'down', 'wildfire', 'inadvertently', 'sorta-kinda', 'caused', 'then', 'family', 'down', 'Ren-Mar', 'where', 'trafficking', 'drugs', 'Mexican', 'mafia', 'love', 'Esteban', 'Reyes', 'mayor', 'Tijuana', 'cover', 'business', 'being', 'used', 'human', 'trafficking', 'DEA', 'tunnel', 'shut', 'down', 'People', 'find', 'out', 'squealed', 'almost', 'killed', 'then', 'BAM', 'pregnant', 'Esteban', 'baby', 'So', 'baby', 'married', 'settle', 'down', 'new', 'life', 'Soon', 'woman', 'named', 'Pilar', 'Zuazo', 'who', 'Esteban', 'boss', 'who', 'Nancy', 'picture', 'Tension', 'ensues', 'quite', 'time', 'then', 'finale', 'Nancy', '13-year-old', 'son', 'Shane', 'Pilar', 'knocking', 'head', 'croquet', 'mallet', 'leaving', 'fall', 'swimming', 'pool', 'bleed', 'head', 'death.So', 'here', 'are', 'season', 'six', 'Nancy', 'family', 'are', 'lam', 'again', 'stay', 'lam', 'whole', 'season', 'Esteban', 'crew', 'are', 'tail', 'practically', 'whole', 'thing', 'season', 'Weeds', 'one', 'few', 'slow-burning', 'episodes', 'middle', 'season', 'eventual', 'spectacular', 'finale', 'excited', 'see', 'where', 'will', 'go', 'here', 'season', 'Nancy', 'family', 'settle', 'Seattle', 'working', 'minimum', 'wage', 'hotel', 'then', 'go', 'Nancy', 'hometown', 'Dearborn', 'Michigan', 'impersonate', 'religious', 'fundamentalists', 'Nancy', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Zack', 'Morris', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'Silas', 'long-overdue', 'college', 'experience', 'family', 'big', 'plans.One', 'thing', 'love', 'season', 'character', 'brought', 'kind', 'illumination', 'character', 'how', 'crazy', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'years', 'are', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'become', 'actions', 'Especially', 'Nancy', 'who', 'seriously', 'tricked', 'fate', 'years', 'finally', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'actions', 'have', 'made', 'audience', 'always', 'been', 'wild', 'card', 'making', 'decisions', 'are', 'risky', 'possibly', 'self-destructive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'more', 'other', 'saying', 'season', 'selfless', 'act', 'Nancy', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'character', 'long', 'run.One', 'thing', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'character', 'Celia', ""n't"", 'around', 'anymore', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Doug', 'still', 'show', 'what', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Celia', 'story', 'was', 'getting', 'lame', 'years', 'gave', 'great', 'cliffhanger', 'season', 'five', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'resolved', 'certain', 'points', 'season', 'direction', 'feels', 'kind', 'aimless', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'go', 'what', 'have', 'However', 'be', 'untrue', 'season', 'progresses.Bring', 'season', '7']",N/A

The Botwins assume new identities and scrape by working odd jobs and selling hash as they traipse around the country, hiding from Esteban and his cronies. Although there are some truly hilarious moments, many of which include special guest star Richard Dreyfuss as Nancy's former lover/high school math teacher, I really, REALLY missed having Elizabeth Perkins (Celia) on the show this season. Also, the final few episodes were kind of out there.

This season--I'm in agreement with quite a few reviewers--was exceedingly disappointing.  Losing some of the secondary characters was a mistake because it forced us to stick with the Botwins who have, in many ways, become caricatures of themselves.  Shane is primarily a one-note psychopath; Nancy, a certifiable whack-job and most definitely the creepiest, most dysfunctional mother in the history of TV (Peggy Bundy is Donna Reed in comparison); and Andy, who occasionally has a moment or two to shine, needs to grow a pair and get on with his life--this constant mooning over a woman as ridiculous as Nancy is kinda pathetic.  The only character who really grew was Silas.  I was hoping he'd run screaming from the family and get the college dream he wanted.  The show's finale, I must admit, was a great surprise and although it was way over the top, gave me hope that the upcoming season might actually go somewhere different and regain its strength.

In all honesty, where could this series possibly go? Well, the answer awaits in the immensely rewarding 6th Season.After the shocking events in the 5th Season's finale, Nancy and the gang (minus Celia, which is a blessing since the show didn't need her anymore), are off on the road. Sending the characters on the run was a risky but inspired move because it exhausts them dramatically, puts them in contact with some wacky people and locations (adding much of the humor missing from Season 5), adds a real sense of urgency and danger and keeps the pace brisk and engaging.What works best about sending Nancy and Co on the lam is that it also lets the show backtrack it's history, letting the characters come to terms with what they have done over the years. It's in that self reflective nature that the show brings in a wholly unexpected emotional level. The finale here is not necessarily shocking in terms of plot, but shocking for what Nancy does emotionally, when you see it, you will never think she had it in her. Season Six of Weeds is decidedly different in almost every aspect, but it also brings all of the shows past seasons into a greater light.Since we finally get to really see what is going on under the surface with Nancy, Andy, Silas, Shane and yes, even Doug, we begin to understand their past (before the show started), their actions during the series and then how they react during Season Six. With the writing in such top form, the acting is even better. Mary-Louise Parker is as riveting and unlikeable as ever as Nancy Botwin (though the frustration you feel with her during the season is specifically calculated and snaps into focus during the finale). Justin Kirk really takes the front seat as a father figure and leader, being the emotional ground for which the family stands. Hunter Parrish as Silas gives a haunting, aching performance showing how he is really questioning his role in the family and what he truly wants in life. Alexander Gould as Shane is as dark as can be, but we also get to see beyond that facade and into the soul of a tortured young boy. Kevin Nealon as Doug is not exactly needed but adds some nice comedic touches and the send off (for now at least) of his character is rather poignant. Season Six also has a fantastic array of guest stars including Linda Hamilton, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, a very memorable and funny Richard Dreyfuss and a slew of returning cast members from previous seasons (how these past characters are integrated into the story is very clever).If you are a long time fan of the series, Season Six of Weeds will be vastly rewarding and emotional for you, it's a complex, decidedly different, and introspective season that rewards in spades. A great show that just keeps getting better.This Season Six set contains the episodes:- Thwack- Felling and Swamping- A Yippity Sippity- Bliss- Boomerang- A Shoe for a Shoe- Pinwheels and Whirligigs- Gentle Puppies- To Moscow, and Quickly- Dear-Born Again- Viking Pride- Fran Tarkenton- Theoretical Love Is Not Dead",5,"A Complex, Rewarding and All Together Different Season",1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,3191,"['rather', 'low', 'key', 'Seasons', '4', '5', 'great', 'own', 'right', 'vastly', 'different', 'Seasons', '1', '2', '3', 'Weeds', 'seemed', 'was', 'heading', 'end', 'honesty', 'where', 'could', 'series', 'possibly', 'go', 'Well', 'answer', 'immensely', 'rewarding', '6th', 'Season.After', 'shocking', 'events', '5th', 'Season', 'finale', 'Nancy', 'gang', 'Celia', 'blessing', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'anymore', 'are', 'off', 'road', 'Sending', 'characters', 'run', 'was', 'risky', 'inspired', 'move', 'dramatically', 'contact', 'wacky', 'people', 'locations', 'adding', 'much', 'humor', 'missing', 'Season', '5', 'real', 'sense', 'urgency', 'danger', 'pace', 'brisk', 'best', 'sending', 'Nancy', 'Co', 'lam', 'also', 'show', 'history', 'letting', 'characters', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'years', 'self', 'reflective', 'nature', 'show', 'wholly', 'unexpected', 'emotional', 'level', 'finale', 'here', 'not', 'necessarily', 'shocking', 'terms', 'plot', 'shocking', 'what', 'Nancy', 'emotionally', 'when', 'see', 'will', 'never', 'think', 'had', 'Season', 'Six', 'Weeds', 'decidedly', 'different', 'almost', 'aspect', 'also', 'shows', 'seasons', 'greater', 'light.Since', 'finally', 'get', 'really', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'surface', 'Nancy', 'Andy', 'Silas', 'Shane', 'yes', 'even', 'Doug', 'begin', 'understand', 'past', 'show', 'started', 'actions', 'series', 'then', 'how', 'react', 'Season', 'Six', 'writing', 'such', 'top', 'form', 'acting', 'even', 'better', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'riveting', 'unlikeable', 'as', 'ever', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'frustration', 'feel', 'season', 'specifically', 'calculated', 'focus', 'finale', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'really', 'front', 'seat', 'father', 'figure', 'leader', 'being', 'emotional', 'ground', 'family', 'Hunter', 'Parrish', 'Silas', 'haunting', 'aching', 'performance', 'showing', 'how', 'really', 'questioning', 'role', 'family', 'what', 'truly', 'life', 'Alexander', 'Gould', 'Shane', 'as', 'dark', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'facade', 'soul', 'tortured', 'young', 'boy', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Doug', 'not', 'exactly', 'needed', 'nice', 'comedic', 'touches', 'send', 'off', 'now', 'least', 'character', 'rather', 'poignant', 'Season', 'Six', 'also', 'fantastic', 'array', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Mark-Paul', 'Gosselaar', 'very', 'memorable', 'funny', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'slew', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'previous', 'seasons', 'how', 'past', 'characters', 'are', 'integrated', 'story', 'very', 'clever', 'are', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'series', 'Season', 'Six', 'Weeds', 'will', 'be', 'vastly', 'rewarding', 'emotional', 'complex', 'decidedly', 'different', 'introspective', 'season', 'rewards', 'spades', 'great', 'show', 'just', 'getting', 'better.This', 'Season', 'Six', 'set', 'episodes', 'Thwack-', 'Felling', 'Swamping-', 'A', 'Yippity', 'Sippity-', 'Bliss-', 'Boomerang-', 'A', 'Shoe', 'Shoe-', 'Pinwheels', 'Whirligigs-', 'Gentle', 'Puppies-', 'Moscow', 'Quickly-', 'Dear-Born', 'Again-', 'Viking', 'Pride-', 'Fran', 'Tarkenton-', 'Theoretical', 'Love', 'Not', 'Dead']",N/A
