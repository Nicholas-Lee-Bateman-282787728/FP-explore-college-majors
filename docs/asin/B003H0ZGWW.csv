Therefore, one should not compare my rating to motion picture productions, since I employ a much more rigorous rating system to motion pictures.INTRODUCTION:The production is a stage production filmed at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in front of an audience.  The theatre attempts to recreate, as much as possible, the design and feel of Shakespeare's day.From time to time throughout the play, Touchstone and Jaques engage the audience. For example, when giving his famous ""all the world's a stage"" recital, Jaques looks directed into the faces of some adolescent British school boys who are standing near the stage as he recites ""then the whining schoolboy with his satchel / And shining morning face, creeping like snail / unwillingly to school."" Clearly, the actors and actresses attempt to keep the audience involved, as much as possible.STAGING:This stage production plays up Sir Oliver Martext as a blind, incompetent idiot. When exiting the stage, Sir Oliver bumps into a tree and says, ""Excuse me"" to it.Corin is played as a simple shepherd, who has dignity. This production conveys that Corin enjoys his job as a shepherd even if he cannot outperform Touchstone's wit.William is also portrayed as a very stupid man. While I knew this from the script, after watching this stage production, I saw a portrayal of a mentally challenged man who cannot correctly give a flower to the woman he is desperate a touch. (Williams presents the flower to Audrey upside down.)Touchstone's character is also played up. He definitely is an articulate, comic character in this stage production, who dominates a number of scenes with his wit and humor. Touchstone's relationship with Aubrey is particularly humorous. The stage production certainly conveys the idea in the play that ""for thy [their] loving voyage / is but for two months"" (V.5.180-181). When reading the play, I really did not completely grasp just how great a libertine Touchstone could be.Almost immediately after kissing Ganymede, Orlando discovers that Ganymede is really Rosalind. (Yet, Orlando still pretends he does not know. As viewers, we know because Orlando begins pronouncing the name Rosalind a bit differently and gives a few other subtle hints, which make the audience laugh.)In this stage production, Ganymede (Rosalind) begins reading Phoebe's letter in front of Silvius until she reaches the portion in which Phoebe's shows that she is still in love with Ganymede. Then, Silvius snatches the letter and begins reading the parts of the letter that demonstrate Phoebe's infatuation with Ganymede. Because of this switch, I internally questioned whether Rosalind was really reading the letter or making up passages by which Phoebe criticizes Ganymede, in order to benefit Silvius' self-esteem.Certain actors play multiple roles in the play:Amiens plays MartextOliver de Bois plays William.EDITING/DELETIONS:The order of a few scenes is also switched. For example, the audience is introduced to Rosalind and Celia before the scene in which Oliver and Charles communicate.The production skips quite a few lines throughout the play, including the lines where Ganymede claims to be a magician. However, I do not believe excluding those lines harmed the quality of the production.",4,Relatively good for a stage production; makes more changes than I would have liked,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,3404,"['RATING', 'rating', '4', 'stars', 'how', 'view', 'quality', 'stage', 'production', 'relation', 'other', 'stage', 'productions', 'plays', 'have', 'viewed', 'Therefore', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'compare', 'rating', 'motion', 'picture', 'productions', 'employ', 'much', 'more', 'rigorous', 'rating', 'system', 'motion', 'pictures.INTRODUCTION', 'production', 'stage', 'production', 'filmed', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Theatre', 'front', 'audience', 'theatre', 'attempts', 'recreate', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'design', 'feel', 'Shakespeare', 'day.From', 'time', 'time', 'play', 'Touchstone', 'Jaques', 'engage', 'audience', 'example', 'when', 'giving', 'famous', 'world', 'stage', 'recital', 'Jaques', 'directed', 'adolescent', 'British', 'school', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'standing', 'stage', 'then', 'whining', 'schoolboy', 'satchel', '/', 'shining', 'morning', 'face', 'creeping', 'snail', '/', 'unwillingly', 'school', 'Clearly', 'actors', 'actresses', 'attempt', 'keep', 'audience', 'involved', 'as', 'much', 'possible.STAGING', 'stage', 'production', 'up', 'Sir', 'Oliver', 'Martext', 'blind', 'incompetent', 'idiot', 'When', 'exiting', 'stage', 'Sir', 'Oliver', 'tree', 'Excuse', 'it.Corin', 'played', 'simple', 'shepherd', 'who', 'dignity', 'production', 'Corin', 'job', 'shepherd', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'outperform', 'Touchstone', 'wit.William', 'also', 'portrayed', 'very', 'stupid', 'man', 'knew', 'script', 'watching', 'stage', 'production', 'saw', 'portrayal', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'correctly', 'give', 'flower', 'woman', 'desperate', 'touch', 'Williams', 'flower', 'Audrey', 'upside', 'down', 'Touchstone', 'character', 'also', 'played', 'up', 'definitely', 'articulate', 'comic', 'character', 'stage', 'production', 'who', 'number', 'scenes', 'wit', 'humor', 'Touchstone', 'relationship', 'Aubrey', 'particularly', 'humorous', 'stage', 'production', 'certainly', 'idea', 'play', 'thy', '[', ']', 'loving', 'voyage', '/', 'two', 'months', 'V.5.180-181', 'When', 'reading', 'play', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'completely', 'grasp', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'libertine', 'Touchstone', 'could', 'be.Almost', 'immediately', 'kissing', 'Ganymede', 'Orlando', 'Ganymede', 'really', 'Rosalind', 'Orlando', 'still', 'not', 'know', 'viewers', 'know', 'Orlando', 'pronouncing', 'name', 'Rosalind', 'bit', 'differently', 'few', 'other', 'subtle', 'hints', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'stage', 'production', 'Ganymede', 'Rosalind', 'reading', 'Phoebe', 'letter', 'front', 'Silvius', 'portion', 'Phoebe', 'shows', 'still', 'love', 'Ganymede', 'Then', 'Silvius', 'letter', 'reading', 'parts', 'letter', 'demonstrate', 'Phoebe', 'infatuation', 'Ganymede', 'switch', 'internally', 'questioned', 'Rosalind', 'was', 'really', 'reading', 'letter', 'making', 'up', 'passages', 'Phoebe', 'Ganymede', 'order', 'benefit', 'Silvius', 'self-esteem.Certain', 'actors', 'play', 'multiple', 'roles', 'play', 'Amiens', 'MartextOliver', 'de', 'Bois', 'William.EDITING/DELETIONS', 'order', 'few', 'scenes', 'also', 'switched', 'example', 'audience', 'introduced', 'Rosalind', 'Celia', 'scene', 'Oliver', 'Charles', 'communicate.The', 'production', 'skips', 'quite', 'few', 'lines', 'play', 'including', 'lines', 'where', 'Ganymede', 'be', 'magician', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'excluding', 'lines', 'harmed', 'quality', 'production']",William Shakespeare: As You Like It
1345478,A1FT6MCFBM4QOH,B003H0ZGWW,avidreader,"[0, 2]","I was slightly disappointed in this production, because my previous experiences of the Globe productions were marvellous. I think this exploited the gender bending in a 21st century lascivious way rather than in Shakespeare's comic misidentification gambit. It really would have worked better if the cast had been all male as it was when Will did it - the comedy is blunted by having females play males impersonating females impersonating males (I think that's all of it.)However, it gives a most satisfactory account of the text, much more so than Branagh's (although his is visually far superior) and the acting was superb.",4,"Well, I liked it",1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,625,"['was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'production', 'previous', 'experiences', 'Globe', 'productions', 'were', 'marvellous', 'think', 'exploited', 'gender', 'bending', '21st', 'century', 'lascivious', 'way', 'rather', 'Shakespeare', 'comic', 'misidentification', 'gambit', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'cast', 'had', 'been', 'all', 'male', 'was', 'when', 'Will', 'did', 'comedy', 'blunted', 'having', 'females', 'play', 'males', 'impersonating', 'females', 'impersonating', 'males', 'think', 'However', 'most', 'satisfactory', 'account', 'text', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Branagh', 'visually', 'far', 'superior', 'acting', 'was', 'superb']",William Shakespeare: As You Like It
1345479,A1A6YHHR4LBSDH,B003H0ZGWW,E. S. Wilks,"[41, 41]","Thea Sharrocks's ""As You Like It"" is a welcome addition to filmed versions of the play. The most accessible films are the BBC/TimeLife version from the late 1970s and the 2006 Kenneth Branagh film set in Japan both of which suffer from the effort to make the Forest of Arden a realistic rather than magical place of our imagination. The plainness of the Globe stage allows Shakespeare's words and characters to transport us from the corrupt, violent court to the pastoral world of the forest where all are welcomed and accepted for who they are. The transformation from court to forest is simply shown by the removal of black draperies from the columns to reveal plain wood 'trees,' which allow us to enter a world of music and tranquility.The production is spirited and lively and the actors certainly seem to be enjoying it. There is tremendous sense of fun. The only slightly sour note is the unnecessarily violent expulsion of Oliver by Duke Frederick.As Rosalind, one of the most demanding female roles in Shakespeare, Naomi Frederick performs superbly, portraying a woman of wit and intelligence while maintaining a balance between femininity and masculinity. Moving easily between Rosalind and Ganymede, she is in control while indulging in witty banter with Orlando but reveals her feminine vulnerability to Aliena as soon as he has gone. She is ably supported by Laura Rogers as Celia/Aliena, who conveys a warmth and sense of humor not often seen in this role. Jack Laskey as Orlando is suitably 'Byronic' as the romantic hero who needs to learn from Rosalind that his unrealistic view of love can lead only to disillusionment.The Jaques of Tim McMullan is a fresh interpretation of the part. The ""Seven Ages Of Man"" speech is meaningfully delivered (he even delights the audience by picking out a 'whining schoolboy' from their midst). Dominic Rowan's highly energetic Touchstone is a great crowd pleaser whose physical presentation of the ""lie seven times removed"" evokes much laughter. Of the other minor characters, the old shepherd Corin stands out. Sean Kerns invests him with dignity confirming the worth of the simple life of a shepherd. The songs which are an integral apart of the play are enhanced by the pleasant voice of Peter Gale.In addition to the filmed performance, a cast gallery and famous speeches are included on the disc. These extra features should prove useful for educational purposes.This video is a thoroughly entertaining production of one of Shakespeare's happiest plays.

The addition of the thrust, stairs and walkways into the audience, and the brilliant use of them enhanced the production. The complete elimination of the 4th wall was well-done.
