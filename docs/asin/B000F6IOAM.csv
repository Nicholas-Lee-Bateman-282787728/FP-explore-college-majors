I don't know why it got so much negativity, but I guess this film is more directed as scary towards younger people like kids and teenagers. I think it's way better than ""One Missed Call"" or anything stupid and unrealistic like that. I think it's a very good remake with great acting and terrifying suspense. The ending is also really creepy, and I love it.

983550,A30QSLHX2HC9GE,B000F6IOAM,Aaron Von Raschke,"[2, 4]","WHEN A STRANGER CALLS is about a guy who likes to make obscene phone calls to teenage girls and then eventually  break into their house and kill them. His victim in particular for this movie is Jill (Camilla Belle), a high school girl who is babysitting at a home out in the middle of nowhere. She's been grounded for a month (no cell phone and no car) which sets up the fact that she's REALLY stuck at this isolated house when all heck breaks loose toward the end. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of this movie and only saw it because I found out Camilla Belle was in it. Other than that, it probably would have been added to the list of the other lame PG-13 Horror movies that I would have entirely skipped altogether (PULSE, ONE MISSED CALL, PROM NIGHT, etc.).So with that being said, I think my low expectations were met in full. WHEN A STRANGER CALLS was about an hour of Jill overreacting to nothing and about a half an hour of her getting chased around. Nothing special. There's no real explanation as to WHY the ""Stranger"" in the film did what he did or what the motive for his past cases was. And on a personal level nothing in the movie struck me as being scary and I think that the fact that I'm not a high school girl could have played a part in that, because I'm pretty sure any adult will watch this film and automatically pick apart its flaws and come up with solutions to many of Jill's problems. And even when you look at this film from the perspective on someone suspending their disbelief and just accepting it for what it is... it's still not very entertaining. WHEN A STRANGER CALLS is not necessarily a remake, per se, but more of a different version of an older film calledWHEN A STRANGER CALLS BACK. In the original film, it used a lot of different things to create suspense and terror, such as plot twists, weird characters, atmosphere, etc. and most importantly it let you KNOW who the antagonist was and what kind of person he was, where as this film doesn't do that. You don't know anything about him other than the fact that he killed a girl in the beginning of the film.Overall, I didn't like this movie at all. I would watch it again if it was on TV and nothing else was on. It's not entertaining, but it's not COMPLETELY unbearable. The film quality is great, the photography is really nice, and the cast is pretty. It's also not necessarily a Horror film, it's more of a Drama with elements of Horror (a damsel in distress, a psychopathic killer). Ultimately, I think my handicap with this film is that I don't fall into the whole PG-13 demographic. This is a movie for teenagers and that's all there is to it. So if you're a teen, you may like this or if you're smart enough you may see past it's stupidity. If you're an adult looking for something creepy, you should just skip this one and not think twice about it.2 stars",2,God forbid she takes the phone off the hook.,1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,2863,"['WHEN', 'STRANGER', 'CALLS', 'guy', 'who', 'make', 'obscene', 'phone', 'teenage', 'girls', 'then', 'eventually', 'break', 'house', 'kill', 'victim', 'particular', 'movie', 'Jill', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'who', 'babysitting', 'home', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'been', 'grounded', 'month', 'cell', 'phone', 'car', 'up', 'fact', 'REALLY', 'stuck', 'isolated', 'house', 'when', 'heck', 'breaks', 'loose', 'end', 'Honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'only', 'saw', 'found', 'out', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'was', 'Other', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'list', 'other', 'lame', 'PG-13', 'Horror', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'entirely', 'skipped', 'altogether', 'PULSE', 'ONE', 'MISSED', 'CALL', 'PROM', 'NIGHT', 'etc', '.So', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'low', 'expectations', 'were', 'met', 'full', 'WHEN', 'A', 'STRANGER', 'CALLS', 'was', 'hour', 'Jill', 'overreacting', 'nothing', 'half', 'hour', 'getting', 'chased', 'Nothing', 'special', 'real', 'explanation', 'WHY', 'Stranger', 'film', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'what', 'motive', 'past', 'cases', 'was', 'personal', 'level', 'nothing', 'movie', 'struck', 'being', 'scary', 'think', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'part', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'adult', 'will', 'watch', 'film', 'automatically', 'pick', 'apart', 'flaws', 'come', 'up', 'solutions', 'many', 'Jill', 'problems', 'even', 'when', 'look', 'film', 'perspective', 'someone', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'just', 'accepting', 'what', 'still', 'not', 'very', 'entertaining', 'WHEN', 'A', 'STRANGER', 'CALLS', 'not', 'necessarily', 'remake', 'se', 'more', 'different', 'version', 'older', 'film', 'calledWHEN', 'A', 'STRANGER', 'CALLS', 'BACK', 'original', 'film', 'used', 'lot', 'different', 'things', 'create', 'suspense', 'terror', 'such', 'plot', 'twists', 'weird', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'etc', 'most', 'importantly', 'let', 'KNOW', 'who', 'antagonist', 'was', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'was', 'where', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'other', 'fact', 'killed', 'girl', 'beginning', 'film.Overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'TV', 'nothing', 'else', 'was', 'not', 'entertaining', 'not', 'COMPLETELY', 'unbearable', 'film', 'quality', 'great', 'photography', 'really', 'nice', 'cast', 'pretty', 'also', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Horror', 'film', 'more', 'Drama', 'elements', 'Horror', 'damsel', 'distress', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'handicap', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'whole', 'PG-13', 'demographic', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'So', ""'re"", 'teen', 'may', 'like', ""'re"", 'smart', 'enough', 'may', 'see', 'stupidity', ""'re"", 'adult', 'looking', 'something', 'creepy', 'should', 'just', 'skip', 'one', 'not', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'it.2', 'stars']",N/A
983551,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000F6IOAM,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[7, 10]","When I was getting ready to watch this film I was bracing myself for a crapfest. I was very surprised that I didn't hate it. Granted, it won't wow anyone unless you're a teenage girl who has never watched a horror film, but it provides enough entertainment to serve as a likable midnight horror flick. I think people criticize this film more than it deserves. Even if you hate it you can't deny that this film is a big cut above atrocious remakes like Prom Night and The Wicker Man (Hands down, the worst of the remakes I've witnessed thus far).WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Jill Johnson is a teenage girl going through troubles recently. Her boyfriend cheated on her and it turns out she ran up a large cell phone bill. So her parents force her to babysit for a rich family who just so happen to live in the middle of nowhere (Yes this film has stupid little inconsistencies and cliches). The family she is babysitting is fairly nice and let Jill do pretty much whatever she wants. She mostly explores the house since the children are sleeping, but then she starts getting strange phone calls. At first the voice doesn't say anything, but after a few phone calls, the caller poses the question, ""Have you checked the children?"" Jill panics of course and checks, but the children are unharmed and the phone calls continue. But then she realizes the caller can see her and then it becomes a fight for survival against a killer.MUSIC: The music fits the horror mood as it should, and I really have no gripes against it.ACTING: Mixed. Some actors do a fairly good job, while others just plain suck. Camilla Belle's performance I felt was decent and nowhere near as bad as people said it was. While the acting wasn't great, there were enough decent performances to hold it together.ACTION: Most of the film takes place in the house and the main character wandering around trying to find out where the calls were coming from. I have to admit this is what made the film work for me, and I have to applaud the film for going for realism. This is certainly not a fast-paced film, but it instead wants to build suspense and tension. I must say that it actually pulls it off pretty well. I wasn't scared, but it set up rather effective scenes (Especially near the end). I am also pleased to say that I was never really bored either.OVERALL: I know a lot of people hate this film so I'm going to say this should be a cautionary rental. It provides enough entertainment to keep itself afloat and manages to be enjoyable. While I highly doubt it's better than the 1979 original, it gets the job done and works fairly well as a suspense/horror flick. It won't blow you away, but it's certainly better than some of the other remakes to choose from.THE GOOD: Good music, some decent actors, a good setup of suspense and tension, great set design, and I liked how this film aims for a realistic approach.THE BAD: Horror film cliches, some bad actors, and it doesn't feel fully realized.",3,HURRAY!

983552,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000F6IOAM,Adam Craig,"[4, 5]","So here I am, writing another review of a remake of another classicl horror/thriller film.  The lack of originality in Hollywood these days is really mind-numbing.  There aren't that many good remakes out there these days, but this is one of the few exceptions to that rule.Jill Johnson is a grounded teenager who is being forced to babysit on a weekend night to pay off the balance of a cell phone bill that apparently went way over the amount of limited minutes.  Having just broken up with her boyfriend, and now having to miss the big bonfire party, Jill is understandably upset, as any high school girl would be.  She arrives at the house of the doctor she is babysitting for, and is told that the children are sick and already asleep.  Everything is normal for a few hours, then the creepy phone calls commence, and from that point on, the movie takes off.  The thrills and tense moments in the last half hour of When A Stranger Calls are some of the best I've had in a movie theater in quite a while.  The atmosphere is perfect.  The house is cool, but still very creepy, with many amenities that provide ways to creep out the viewer (motion-sensitive lights help some moments out a lot).  Overall, the entire feel of the film is just very creepy, and this is good, because that's why I see a film like this, to be creeped out, or thrilled, or whatever.One of the best things about the film is that it doesn't try to do anything more than is absolutely necessary to further the peril of the babysitter.  We are given a minimal amount of setup, and, aside from a brief introduction  to the film's villain, we pretty much get right down to business with the basica storyline.  Girl is babysitting in creepy house.  Girl gets creepy phone calls.  Strange perpetrator tries to kill girl.  What more can you ask for?Surprisingly, I actually thought that the acting in the film was very good.  The only character that appears that much is Jill, and the actress who plays her does a very good job.  In fact, it was the least cliched and best-acted performance I'd seen from a female horror lead in a long time.  The actor who plays the caller isn't ever really seen that much, but he is sufficiently creepy, and the cinematography on him is great, especially with the use of shadows to conceal his face for most of the final, thrilling sequence.When A Stranger Calls probably isn't as good as the original.  I wouldn't know, I've never seen the old version, but I do know that that remake isn't just some cheap slasher flick for teens, it's actually a well set up, efficient exercise in thrills and tension for the moviegoers.",4,"An efficiently made, well-acted thriller",1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,2626,"['So', 'here', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'remake', 'classicl', 'horror/thriller', 'film', 'lack', 'originality', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'really', 'mind-numbing', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'good', 'remakes', 'out', 'there', 'days', 'one', 'few', 'exceptions', 'rule.Jill', 'Johnson', 'grounded', 'teenager', 'who', 'being', 'forced', 'babysit', 'weekend', 'night', 'pay', 'off', 'balance', 'cell', 'phone', 'bill', 'apparently', 'went', 'way', 'amount', 'limited', 'minutes', 'Having', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'now', 'having', 'miss', 'big', 'bonfire', 'party', 'Jill', 'understandably', 'upset', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'would', 'be', 'house', 'doctor', 'babysitting', 'told', 'children', 'are', 'sick', 'already', 'asleep', 'Everything', 'normal', 'few', 'hours', 'then', 'creepy', 'phone', 'commence', 'point', 'movie', 'off', 'thrills', 'tense', 'moments', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'had', 'movie', 'theater', 'quite', 'while', 'atmosphere', 'perfect', 'house', 'cool', 'still', 'very', 'creepy', 'many', 'amenities', 'provide', 'ways', 'creep', 'out', 'viewer', 'motion-sensitive', 'lights', 'help', 'moments', 'out', 'lot', 'Overall', 'entire', 'feel', 'film', 'just', 'very', 'creepy', 'good', 'why', 'see', 'film', 'be', 'creeped', 'out', 'thrilled', 'whatever.One', 'best', 'things', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'anything', 'more', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'further', 'peril', 'babysitter', 'are', 'given', 'minimal', 'amount', 'setup', 'aside', 'brief', 'introduction', 'film', 'villain', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'business', 'basica', 'storyline', 'Girl', 'babysitting', 'creepy', 'house', 'Girl', 'creepy', 'phone', 'calls', 'Strange', 'perpetrator', 'tries', 'kill', 'girl', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'Surprisingly', 'actually', 'thought', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'character', 'much', 'Jill', 'actress', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'fact', 'was', 'least', 'cliched', 'best-acted', 'performance', ""'d"", 'seen', 'female', 'horror', 'lead', 'long', 'time', 'actor', 'who', 'caller', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'seen', 'much', 'sufficiently', 'creepy', 'cinematography', 'great', 'especially', 'use', 'shadows', 'conceal', 'face', 'most', 'final', 'thrilling', 'sequence.When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'probably', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'original', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'old', 'version', 'do', 'know', 'remake', ""n't"", 'just', 'cheap', 'slasher', 'flick', 'teens', 'actually', 'well', 'set', 'up', 'efficient', 'exercise', 'thrills', 'tension', 'moviegoers']",N/A

983557,A1P5D6RTT42XO8,B000F6IOAM,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","As most of us already know, this is a remake of a Carol Kane movie made back in 1979.  I should say that I'm not a big fan of the original film and was hoping that this movie would correct some issues I had with the original.  In that respect, it succeeded and failed at the same time.  I think the original film was very slow paced towards the ending and this remake made the correct choice to skip that part entirely.  However, what the original film did have was a very tense beginning.  I think this is where this remake fails.  The director Simon West directed Tomb Raider, so I was hoping for a very watchable movie that was well directed.  He made the unfortunate decision to build suspense by having music cues start as Camilla Belle's character turns corners and open doors, only to find nothing there.  This got tedious as it continually occurred.  Had it happened once or twice it would have worked, but West overused the technique and, for me at least, it had a boy-who-cried-wolf affect.  When something was eventually there, I simply didn't care anymore.  West also took a completely different approach with the children from the original.  In the original the killer is calling and asking the babysitter if she's checked the children because he's done something very horrible to them.  Maybe it was to get the PG-13 rating, but West's approach was very different and it ended up being confusing to me since the madman was shown at the beginning to have intense rage issues.  The madman's actions at the end of the movie simply didn't feel consistent with what happened at the beginning of the film.

983559,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000F6IOAM,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","What keeps me coming back to this remake is the sheer fact that it succeeds in so much while doing so little.  It's hard these days to find a good thrill without all the excess blood, sex and language but here the same thrill is achieved with a stripped bare premise.  It's dark, it's tense, it's claustrophobic and most importantly it's entertaining.  Thankfully Camilla Belle is a good actress despite her youth and beauty and so watching her and pretty much only her for almost an hour and a half is doable and enjoyable even.  She's convincing in her role as distressed damsel and while the script, like most of this genre, insists on making her repeat stupid mistakes to prolong her agony in the end she plays it smart and realistic.It can be difficult to absorb an audience when your plot revolves around a few short hours, but here the time seems well spent.  Nothing seems drug out nor compressed and boggled.  Simon West does a great job of creating a mood with lighting and sound and not to mention that house which is enough to scare the bravest of souls.  The movie starts slowly, setting that said mood, and then it gradually starts to build speed, and once the first body is dropped this train is loosed from its tracks and sent spiraling down at breakneck speed.So, the premise is one that I'm sure everyone is familiar with, but here's the rundown.  Jill has just had an outing with her boyfriend who just so happened to kiss her best friend.  Because of this issue they've been spending quite a bit of time on the phone and thus her phone bill is outrageous causing her parents to take away her phone and her car and force her to baby-sit in order to pay off the bill.  That's why she finds herself being stalked by a crazed killer at the Mandrakis residence with no way of leaving.The film may not be perfect but what film is?  It's tense and scary and proves that you don't need all the adult elements to make an interesting thriller.  It meets its purpose and I've recommended it to all my friends and family and they love it as well.  Well worth the time and money and will prove to be a great way to spend the night on the couch with some popcorn and a loved one.  Now I have not seen the original and so I can't comment on the two in comparison but I can say that standing alone as a teen thriller `When a Stranger Calls' delivers the goods.",4,Sets a mood and delivers thrills the whole family can enjoy...,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,2364,"['What', 'coming', 'back', 'remake', 'sheer', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'doing', 'so', 'little', 'hard', 'days', 'find', 'good', 'thrill', 'excess', 'blood', 'sex', 'language', 'here', 'same', 'thrill', 'achieved', 'stripped', 'bare', 'premise', 'dark', 'tense', 'claustrophobic', 'most', 'importantly', 'entertaining', 'Thankfully', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'good', 'actress', 'youth', 'beauty', 'so', 'watching', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'almost', 'hour', 'half', 'doable', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'convincing', 'role', 'distressed', 'damsel', 'script', 'most', 'genre', 'making', 'repeat', 'stupid', 'mistakes', 'prolong', 'agony', 'end', 'smart', 'realistic.It', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'absorb', 'audience', 'when', 'plot', 'around', 'few', 'short', 'hours', 'here', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'Nothing', 'drug', 'out', 'compressed', 'boggled', 'Simon', 'West', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'mood', 'lighting', 'sound', 'not', 'mention', 'house', 'enough', 'scare', 'bravest', 'souls', 'movie', 'slowly', 'setting', 'said', 'mood', 'then', 'gradually', 'build', 'speed', 'once', 'first', 'body', 'dropped', 'train', 'loosed', 'tracks', 'sent', 'spiraling', 'down', 'breakneck', 'speed.So', 'premise', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'here', 'rundown', 'Jill', 'just', 'had', 'outing', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'kiss', 'best', 'friend', 'issue', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spending', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'phone', 'thus', 'phone', 'bill', 'outrageous', 'causing', 'parents', 'take', 'away', 'phone', 'car', 'force', 'baby-sit', 'order', 'pay', 'off', 'bill', 'why', 'being', 'stalked', 'crazed', 'killer', 'Mandrakis', 'residence', 'way', 'leaving.The', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'what', 'film', 'tense', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'adult', 'elements', 'make', 'interesting', 'thriller', 'purpose', ""'ve"", 'recommended', 'friends', 'family', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'Well', 'time', 'money', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'great', 'way', 'spend', 'night', 'couch', 'popcorn', 'loved', 'one', 'Now', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'two', 'comparison', 'can', 'say', 'standing', 'alone', 'teen', 'thriller', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'delivers', 'goods']",N/A

I first watched this suspense tale back in '06 and it is now a regular in my dvd collection. This movie is a cut above the standard teens-in-peril slasher movies that have been coming out in droves the last 15 or so years since movies like Scream, Urban Legend, and I Know What You Did Last Summer rejuvenated the genre in the late 90s. While those 3 movies had unique plots, twists, and turns, everything else that's come out in the 00s is either a retread or copies of those films or poor remakes of 70s/80s horror movies. But THIS remake is a keeper!Ingenue Camilla Belle is very engaging and underrated in this movie, being the sole main character and having the difficult task of keeping the viewer involved in the plot. Belle plays Jill Johnson, a very refreshing character, a teenager that's actually responsible and mature, but not in an annoying, self-conscious way that makes you want to punch the TV screen! While Jill is still more mature than the average teen, she's not an outcast. She's an athlete on the track and field team and has a close circle of friends, one of which kissed Jill's boyfriend. An upset Jill overused her cell phone minutes, so her Dad punishes her by forcing her to babysit for an affluent couple in town, thus the main plot of the film.These early minor details of the goings-on in Jill's life are key to the plot and give her character some personality, which helps the viewer relate to her. The director Simon West does a good job of establishing the minor characters (most of whom only have one scene), like Jill's Dad, her friends, and the parents of the children she is babysitting.The opening scene of the stranger terrorizing his previous targets in a distant town is creepy and effective, giving us a preview of what Jill will be up against. The well-executed, slow-building tension (punctuated by a creepy score and lots of tracking/angular shots of that secluded art-deco house) is a rarity for an 00s ""teen slasher film"", giving it the feel of an old-fashioned horror movie. Plus, the movie feels just about the right length and the ending sticks with the viewer even after the film is over. Not the typical, generic teen horror movie fare at all!

983562,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000F6IOAM,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 2]","The original 1979 movie with Carold Kane scared the living you know what out of me when I was a kid. Those first 20 minutes or so had me transfixed in fear and terror. It was one of the best openings of a scary movie. The rest of that movie?. Not so much. But it's been a while, and I don't remember much beyond those first 20 minutes. This remake changes things a bit. There is no scary opening minutes that is then changed to a standard catch the killer chase movie. The whole movie takes place in the house during the babysitting job. To me, that's actually a bit more interesting. Unfortunatley, the movie doesn't carry that new direction of the story very far. Nothing really interesting happens in the movie until the last 25 minutes or so. We got instant terror with the original, but now have to wait thru most of the movie with this one to see some real good stuff. And even then, it seems to be over much sooner than it should be. The best thing about this movie is it's lone star, Camilla Belle. This young lady carries the film rather well, and she is extraodinarily beautiful. She makes the waiting and waiting slightly more bearable. By now, you know the drill. Babysitter Jill(Belle)babysits for a wealthy couple and their 2 little children. She is in their huge home encased in lots of glass in some remote region. She begins having scary calls that get worse and worse. Finally, the calls are traced from the house!. It's the most famous urban legend of all, and it's been done to death. Not much new here to report. There's very little death(and they are non-graphic and off screen), and very little tension and suspense. When things finally do get moving and the killer makes himself known, it's a bit of too little, too late for the audience. By this time, it's been dragged on for as long as it can go and viewer interest has waned. Still, this is the best part of the film and elicits enjoyment, but you know it's coming and the unfolding drama holds little shock or scare value. If only the movie could of held more suspense and terror leading up to it. The atmosphere of the film is pretty good. The house itself has lights that turn on and off when you walk in the room, and there's lots of glass. The house is as much a character as, well, the characters. However, I think they could of made something more spectacularly scary with the lights. Of course, there is a storm brewing outside. As for the killer himself, the voice of the killer on the phone is supplied by none other than Lance Henriksen. And when the guy does appear, he is strangely interesting and mysterious. You see some of him, but not enough to really know who this guy is. There is not much in the way of cast here. Katie Cssidy(daughter of Partridge Family's David Cassidy)has a brief, and thankless, role as Jill's friend. David Denman(demon Skip on ""Angel"" and Roy on ""The Office"")appears as a friendly cop. That's about it. But it's really all about Belle. She is the sole cast member here and she has to carry this entire thing herself. She does pretty well, but the material isn't strong enough. You really like her and don't want anything to happen to her.

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","When a Stranger Calls begins like it's going to be a low budget flick fitting for the Lifetime Movie Network, but slowly and quietly the storytelling makes enough of an improvement for me to say that it's a pretty good movie in the end.Of course the big issue is this- what can you really do to make a movie that centers around creepy phone conversations suspenseful and interesting enough?  There's only so much you can do.  Well I have to give this movie credit- it tries just about everything in its 80-minute time.It's about a babysitter that has to watch these kids while the parents are away, and my goodness what an extravagant mansion this is!  A high tech security system, a bird sanctuary, a fireplace with a remote control feature, an indoor pond, and beautiful furniture... and the setting is supposed to be on a mountain in the middle of nowhere, hence the reason the cops couldn't get out there right away if something were to occur.Anyway, as you can probably guess, the teenager starts receiving phone calls that are really strange.  At first they're just creepy, but later they turn vicious and nasty.  Of course the girl is terrified the whole time and rightfully so given she has the huge responsibility of taking care of the kids alone and looking out for herself in times of trouble.  In one spot her friend makes a surprise appearance which is a pretty good spooky moment the way she just surprises her friend from behind that one corner.I guess the one flaw here would be that the kids she's babysitting are suspiciously quiet for way too long, however it's understandable I suppose that the kids living in such a big place wouldn't hear all the chaos the babysitter finds herself in downstairs.I won't spoil what happens, but you can probaby guess.

It wasn't boring, but it didn't keep my full attention throughout.I kept waiting for this movie to get exciting, get better, but no, that never happened. It started slowly and never really picked up. It had all the elements necessary for a good scary film, except the scare. Maybe if the main character, Jill, had been smarter, or if we'd seen some dead bodies before the last fifteen minutes it would have been better.Ask yourself this before you buy the movie: Is it smart to turn off the house's alarm system right after it goes off, and then poke your head out the front door to see what's up? Is it smart to run 200 yards through heavy brush to the guest house next to your mansion when you've seen a silhouette of someone through the window of that guest house?

I have to say that I found this remake to be everything that the original film wasn't. It really delivered what the original promised and failed miserably at. It is one of the very best horror remakes to be found and one of the very best horror films for years, period. This new film version kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the 87 minute running time. It took a beautiful, lavish, state-of-the-art, modern home and made it a scary place to be with a lot of dark corners and hallways and strange noises.  It is most definitely not a film to watch before babysitting or going home alone to an empty house at night. It is like a thrill ride that never lets up the pace until the very end. The violence is not at all graphic and the murders take place off-screen. It definitely scores a bullseye in the suspense department though and it fully succeeds in creating a real sense of mounting dread and tension throughout the entire film. Make sure to see it with someone you can hold onto!! Don't miss it!!

At least it was in widescreen HD I suppose.  But in my opinion, the biggest problem with this movie was that the director seemed to forget why he was even making it.  I guess that it is a remake -- I'm not sure that I've seen the original -- which is always a problem in itself.  After all, if a first-run movie is really bad, who wants to remake it?  So usually only decent films are remade, which means that the majority of the audience will have seen the original and will compare the remake against that original.  And it is a rare case indeed where the remake is better than the original.But bigger still, it seemed like this film was going to be a supernatural thriller to me at the beginning.  I was wondering, &#34;OK.  This guy is going to not be human, right?&#34; but then later on in the film, it seems like our protagonist, Camilla Belle, is being tormented by a human.  This major issue is never really resolved.  As for minor issues, I can't believe that anyone older than high school would like this movie; that obviously is their target audience.

They've got big budgets, stars, top notch crews and a competent director. Unfortunately this film is modest, it's biggest name is actually a voice on the phone and it's directed by the guy who did Con Air and Tomb Raider. It does have a good crew without a very picturesque house, some good music and nicely shot at times. Unfortunately it's also on a bad movie.Jill got a little overboard on her cell phone, ringing up a big phone bill. Parents get mad, grounding ensues and she has to babysit to pay it off. She's at a huge nice house and a pretty likable family. Unfortunately she gets harassing phone calls from a man who's quite determined on doing some gruesome things to her. That's essentially the story in a nutshell so there's not much else to say.Let's face it: the original is no classic by any means. The only reason it's so well-known is its twist which despite the fact its so pop culture and was even spoiled in the trailers, I'm not saying it here. This film tries to add spookiness but it's essentially the same thing: Jill sees/hears something creepy, investigates and finds out it's a cat or a housekeeper. Then it gets more creepy and intense. It's a paper-thin plot already and it's scretched considerably.The main attraction is of course Camilla Belle and she was quite good in the Quiet and Ballad of Jack and Rose but here she seems kind of wasted. She's certainly attractive but there's little for her to do: get scared, answer phones, get worried and run. Granted this is the director of Tomb Raider so we're not going to get much. The most well-known star is Lance Henrikson of Aliens, tv show Millennium and many others. Although most of what he does is actually just breathe and say less than 10 lines.Is it scary?

Before the terrorism happens, she is asked by an unknown family to babysit their two children.  However, both of them are asleep.  Therefore, she doesn't work much that night.  That night, she begins receiving harassing phone calls which she originally thinks are her friends playing pranks on her.  Little does she know is that these phone calls would forever change her life in the most unexpected fashion.This remake of the 1979 version directed by Fred Walton (""Black Christmas"", 1974) does not pay great homage.  While parts of the concepts were creative, they could have flown together better.  Mayby more unexpected twists and turns could have improved the storyline.  The ones they have become repetative and predictable after the second one, namely the maid and her best friend sneaking by her.  Though in screenplay writing and literature, some off-plot events are okay.  This film overemphasizes them, becoming a film more about Jill recovering from her cheating boyfriend and her friends playing pranks on her than her being terrorized by a madman.Those who have seen the previews of this film already know the entire story concept.  This alone reveals the little detail of the intended main concept.  The other details leave audiences waiting impatiently for this and bore them.  Many of these should have been replaced with ones that relate more to the main plot.  Maybe more about the killer identity, his past, and his motive would have helped.

It's a common question in Hollywood's quest to redo every single 1970s fright flick, including the baby sitter-in-peril screamer, ""When a Stranger Calls,"" which opened.The answer is usually, ""it's the money,"" with ""stupid"" added for emphasis to address those foolish enough to continually waste their money on the next ""Willard"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""""Stranger"" has a different answer, though, which it explains with ineffable calmness to viewers as they twist in their seats in the enthralled discomfort that comes from the most effective scary movies. For once, here is a horror remake that isn't content to pace through the steps of the original, but revisits an intriguing but flawed premise. The new film isn't a retread of the 1979 version of ""When a Stranger Calls;"" it's an optimization.Screenwriter Jake Wade Wall wisely takes the original hook and runs with it, gutting the lukewarm original of its bizarre plot twists and agonizing extensions. Nearly the entirety of the new film occurs during one tense night of baby-sitting.High schooler Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), recovering from a rough breakup with her boyfriend and starting a one-month grounding, sits for a wealthy couple. She's irritated that she has to miss the big school bonfire party, but at least is content that the job seems easy. The setting is a lake house, and so what if it looks like the creepiest place ever? Its dark hallways and off-putting human-size sculptures are only there for decoration.The place is laden with high-tech amenities, and the kids are sick and already have gone to bed. There's even an alarm system, all the better to protect young ladies from psycho killer stalkers. All Jill has to do is wait out the night. And all we have to do is wait with her, our hearts jumping along with hers at every potential sign that she's being watched and marked for murder.Every creak of the house, every muffled disturbance from outside and, yes, every ring of the telephone brings its own series of chills. Is it Rosa the housekeeper? Or maybe the couple's college kid who might have dropped in for the weekend? Jill scours her mind for the possibilities as she fingers the fireplace poker, hoping she'll have no reason to use it.All Jill can do is wait. And wait. And wait.Director Simon West's calling cards are the explosion-a-minute ""Con Air"" and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" which means he's not exactly known as a paragon of restraint. This film is such the opposite of his usual work, he should have been credited as ""West Simon."" In turning the screw, West dispenses with the megapowered cordless drill in favor of the rusty flathead from the bottom of the toolbox.Belle, a scream queen in training for excellence, is easy to get behind, because her character is so wise and resourceful. When she sees a dark, scary closet, she doesn't go in there. Jill is every bit as freaked out as she should be, and her adrenaline is racing so fluidly it flows off the screen and seeps into your own veins.

983582,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B000F6IOAM,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[0, 0]","Do you like your horror to be gore-free and have low body counts?  Are you easily scared watching scenes of protagonists creeping around dark, deserted houses as they hear strange noises and overreact to shadows?  If so, When A Stranger Calls might be just the ticket for you, because more than 80 percent of this short film is one such extended scene.It didn't work very well for me.  It's not because I care about gore and body counts--although I certainly don't mind that stuff, but I just mentioned that for fans who do care, pro or con, about it.  No, it's that for better or worse--I figure it's worse, but there's not much I can do about it--fright is not an emotion that I ever have in response to films.  It's been that way ever since I can remember--even as a kid I don't remember ever being frightened by horror.  Instead, I usually wanted the monsters to win.  I often identified with the monsters.  I'd dress up as Dracula for Halloween, not because I thought it was scary, but because it was a chance to literalize a beguiling fantasy--to be yourself, whatever that was--to be very different from norms--and still be accepted for it.  So I do love the horror genre, but fear has nothing to do with why I love it.Director Simon West has a different idea, and he banks his first horror film, a remake of a 1979 film of the same name, on a bet that he can scare you.  West also apparently subscribes to the theory that we'll be more frightened by what we imagine than what we can actually see.  So for about an hour (When A Stranger Calls is only about 80 minutes long, not counting the credits), we're treated to Camilla Belle trying to act frightened of things that she imagines, and we're supposed to empathize with her.  I think Belle is gorgeous.  She's been great in other films, like 2005's The Chumbscrubber, and she's not exactly bad here, but her horror chops need some work.  It's usually difficult to buy that she's scared or alarmed.  In fact a couple times she came across as caring more that she looked good, or that the camera wasn't catching her in unladylike positions.Making matters worse, West seems to care a lot more about setting up potential scares than he does about objects and people within his fictional world behaving in a non-puzzling way.  Anyone who knows my views knows that I don't expect films to cohere with what we know or believe to be true about the actual world.  But when, say, remote-controlled living room fireplaces belch out roiling torrents of billowing flames fit for Hades in a film that's not otherwise fantastical; or when characters show up out of the blue, inside a putatively alarmed home because the garage just happened to be left open--even though we have no reason to believe that they knew where the house was located; or when the same character goes from being a bit belligerent and carefree to scared out of their wits just because they dropped their car keys and it's windy outside, then it's unjustified to expect audience members to not become distracted, in a bewildered way, by such occurrences.West displays him film literacy a bit.  For just a couple examples, the beginning makes a strong reference to Fritz Lang's M (1931), M serves as a parallel for the modus operandi of the antagonist, and both the setting and a later, important scene in a bathroom are taken are taken right out of the play-by-play book of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980).  The premise of the film is based on an overused urban legend, while the creeping-through-a-dark-and-lonely-house idea, as well as the mysterious objects that shouldn't be left behind, the red herrings, the clothes on hangers being mistaken for bogeymen, and later, the unexpected bodies popping up, are all taken from horror films almost as old as the genre itself.  Beyond that, West doesn't give us much.I wasn't always disappointed while watching When A Stranger Calls, and it's not just because I like looking at Belle.  This may be overly trodden territory, but West and crew have their mechanics down in an academic--or maybe clinical--way.  It was enough to keep me watching.  However, that's not enough to make When A Stranger Calls recommendable.  Once you learn technique, it's your responsibility as an artist to do something more interesting with it.  I can't say it something more interesting was done here.",2,"Clinically competent, but lacks verve",1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,4350,"['Do', 'horror', 'be', 'gore-free', 'have', 'low', 'body', 'counts', 'Are', 'easily', 'scared', 'watching', 'scenes', 'protagonists', 'creeping', 'around', 'dark', 'deserted', 'houses', 'hear', 'strange', 'noises', 'overreact', 'shadows', 'so', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'ticket', 'more', '80', 'percent', 'short', 'film', 'one', 'such', 'extended', 'scene.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'care', 'gore', 'body', 'counts', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'stuff', 'just', 'mentioned', 'fans', 'who', 'do', 'care', 'pro', 'con', 'No', 'better', 'worse', 'figure', 'worse', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'fright', 'not', 'emotion', 'ever', 'have', 'response', 'films', 'been', 'way', 'ever', 'can', 'remember', 'even', 'kid', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'being', 'frightened', 'horror', 'Instead', 'usually', 'wanted', 'monsters', 'win', 'often', 'identified', 'monsters', ""'d"", 'dress', 'up', 'Dracula', 'Halloween', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'scary', 'was', 'chance', 'literalize', 'beguiling', 'fantasy', 'be', 'whatever', 'was', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'norms', 'still', 'be', 'accepted', 'So', 'do', 'love', 'horror', 'genre', 'fear', 'nothing', 'do', 'why', 'love', 'it.Director', 'Simon', 'West', 'different', 'idea', 'banks', 'first', 'horror', 'film', 'remake', '1979', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'bet', 'can', 'scare', 'West', 'also', 'apparently', 'theory', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'frightened', 'what', 'imagine', 'what', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'So', 'hour', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'only', 'about', '80', 'minutes', 'long', 'not', 'counting', 'credits', ""'re"", 'treated', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'trying', 'act', 'frightened', 'things', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'empathize', 'think', 'Belle', 'gorgeous', 'been', 'great', 'other', 'films', '2005', 'Chumbscrubber', 'not', 'exactly', 'bad', 'here', 'horror', 'chops', 'need', 'work', 'usually', 'difficult', 'buy', 'scared', 'alarmed', 'fact', 'couple', 'times', 'came', 'caring', 'more', 'looked', 'good', 'camera', 'was', ""n't"", 'catching', 'unladylike', 'positions.Making', 'matters', 'worse', 'West', 'care', 'lot', 'more', 'setting', 'up', 'potential', 'scares', 'objects', 'people', 'fictional', 'world', 'behaving', 'non-puzzling', 'way', 'Anyone', 'who', 'views', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'films', 'cohere', 'what', 'know', 'believe', 'be', 'true', 'actual', 'world', 'when', 'say', 'remote-controlled', 'living', 'room', 'fireplaces', 'belch', 'out', 'roiling', 'torrents', 'billowing', 'flames', 'fit', 'Hades', 'film', 'not', 'otherwise', 'fantastical', 'when', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'blue', 'putatively', 'alarmed', 'home', 'garage', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'left', 'open', 'even', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'knew', 'where', 'house', 'was', 'located', 'when', 'same', 'character', 'being', 'bit', 'belligerent', 'carefree', 'scared', 'wits', 'just', 'dropped', 'car', 'keys', 'windy', 'outside', 'then', 'unjustified', 'expect', 'audience', 'members', 'not', 'become', 'distracted', 'bewildered', 'way', 'such', 'occurrences.West', 'displays', 'film', 'literacy', 'bit', 'just', 'couple', 'examples', 'beginning', 'strong', 'reference', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'M', '1931', 'M', 'parallel', 'modus', 'operandi', 'antagonist', 'setting', 'later', 'important', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'are', 'taken', 'are', 'taken', 'right', 'play-by-play', 'book', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', '1980', 'premise', 'film', 'based', 'overused', 'urban', 'legend', 'creeping-through-a-dark-and-lonely-house', 'idea', 'as', 'well', 'mysterious', 'objects', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'red', 'herrings', 'clothes', 'hangers', 'being', 'mistaken', 'bogeymen', 'later', 'unexpected', 'bodies', 'popping', 'up', 'are', 'taken', 'horror', 'films', 'almost', 'as', 'old', 'genre', 'Beyond', 'West', ""n't"", 'give', 'much.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'not', 'just', 'like', 'looking', 'Belle', 'may', 'be', 'overly', 'trodden', 'territory', 'West', 'crew', 'have', 'mechanics', 'down', 'academic', 'maybe', 'clinical', 'way', 'was', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'However', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'recommendable', 'Once', 'learn', 'technique', 'responsibility', 'artist', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'done', 'here']",N/A

The first film of the same name was always a favorite of mine; I even liked the sequel, so I was a little skeptical of this one more so then I was with some of the other remakes. When I first learned of this film I wasn't really thrilled to hear about it, and even after seeing the trailer I was even more disappointed. My first mistake was judging a film by its trailer, and the second was doubting the film before I even had seen it.The thing I liked most about this film was that instead of straight remaking the film they kind of played with the idea of what the first film did in the first 20 minutes. That of course was the part were the killer called the babysitter a toyed with her until attacking, for those who have seen the original they know that the first 15 to 25 minutes was some of the most intense minutes on film. So the idea that they would turn that first 20 minutes of the original into the full movie was  in my mind a pretty good idea. The final product though was a mixed bag of sorts, I liked it but it did have flaws.The story is of a teenage girl who has babysitting duties for a rich family out in the woods [of all places], and all seems well at first. The phone starts to ring and Jill picks up, some times it's nothing but some times a voice comes through. The first call asks her ""is every thing ok"", and with that we are off and running. The thing I like about this film is that it builds some much and the tension is always there. After the famous ""have you checked the children"" line appears in the film, Jill goes to check on them. After she returns down stairs the phone rings again, now we hear ""how were the children"". It's with that line that the film really starts to work, and I am hooked for this point. The only flaw to this film or at least the biggest one is that with all the build up we are kind of let down with the ending. The actual end sequence was actually really good, but the part were the killer was caught kinda left me saying `that was to easy"".Besides that let down towards the end, this film actually pretty good. Director Simon West did a pretty good job with this film, and his direction on this film shows that he really tried to make a good film. Also the film looks great, production designer Jon Gary Steele and DP Peter Menzies Jr. did an excellent job on this film. Even actress Camilla Belle did a great job in her portrayal of Jill Johnson. But I have to say that the person I was most impressed with was screenwriter Jake Wade Wall. His vision of what this film should have been was brilliant, it wasn't carried out the way I think that he wanted it but it was good. Plus his commentary track for the film is great, he sounds like he really wanted this film to work and sounds really enthusiastic. I have to agree with what he said about one shot in particular, that of course being the shot were we see the guy in the ceiling looking down at Jill. That was an excellent shot, and it's also refreshing to know that he originally wrote the confrontation between Jill and the killer longer.The film over all is a decent movie and it shows for the most part, both commentaries are good and the behind the scenes featurette is nice as well.

A girl goes to a house as a sitter for a couple she has never met, and, while there, she begins to investigate the big house, answering many phone calls from an unidentified creep on the other line. The babysitter spends much of her time exploring, wandering around in places she shouldn't go. The movie seems to be a little uneven because there is relatively no building up to the main crisis; it is thrust upon us as soon as she arrives at the house. From here, the movie seems to go into the usual mode of a horror film and, while it is not entirely predictable, you watch the film believing  you have seen it before somewhere.The biggest problems with this film are two-fold: it fails to take any chances outside of its neatly little boxed horror genre and it is utterly and completely implausible. The film's originality is seriously lacking, and this is evidenced through the black cat portending an ominous omen, the loud sound effects which yield no horror whatsoever, the couple mysteriously failing to call back, and the police taking an eternity to come in an emergency situation. It seems that many moment of the film are way too convenient, and make it possible for the babysitter to get the scare treatment the entire film in the huge creepy house. The implausibility of the film is rampant. Why on earth does the girl continue to answer a phone when she knows who is going to be on the other line? With the advanced security that this couple has in their high priced home, you think that keeping him out or locating him on the phone would be an easier task. Why does the babysitter seemingly fall for all the usual baits that the caller wants her to fall for, namely leaving the area of safety? Apparently she has read the rulebook on what to do if you are a victim in an unoriginal horror movie.For what it is worth, there are points where the movie is a little creepy, but these don't outweigh much of the preposterousness of the film. I've never seen the original, but it is probably better than this one.",2,"A few scary moments, but lacks any originality and seems implausible",1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,2142,"['yet', 'line', 'remade', 'horror', 'thrillers', 'past', 'give', 'decent', 'performance', 'girl', 'house', 'sitter', 'couple', 'never', 'met', 'there', 'investigate', 'big', 'house', 'answering', 'many', 'phone', 'calls', 'unidentified', 'creep', 'other', 'line', 'babysitter', 'much', 'time', 'exploring', 'wandering', 'around', 'places', 'should', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'be', 'little', 'uneven', 'relatively', 'building', 'up', 'main', 'crisis', 'thrust', 'upon', 'as', 'soon', 'house', 'here', 'movie', 'go', 'usual', 'mode', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'watch', 'film', 'believing', 'have', 'seen', 'somewhere.The', 'biggest', 'problems', 'film', 'are', 'two-fold', 'take', 'chances', 'neatly', 'little', 'boxed', 'horror', 'genre', 'utterly', 'completely', 'implausible', 'film', 'originality', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'evidenced', 'black', 'cat', 'portending', 'ominous', 'omen', 'loud', 'sound', 'effects', 'yield', 'horror', 'whatsoever', 'couple', 'mysteriously', 'failing', 'call', 'back', 'police', 'taking', 'eternity', 'come', 'emergency', 'situation', 'many', 'moment', 'film', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'convenient', 'make', 'possible', 'babysitter', 'get', 'scare', 'treatment', 'entire', 'film', 'huge', 'creepy', 'house', 'implausibility', 'film', 'rampant', 'Why', 'earth', 'girl', 'continue', 'answer', 'phone', 'when', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'other', 'line', 'advanced', 'security', 'couple', 'high', 'priced', 'home', 'think', 'keeping', 'out', 'locating', 'phone', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'task', 'Why', 'babysitter', 'seemingly', 'fall', 'usual', 'baits', 'caller', 'fall', 'namely', 'leaving', 'area', 'safety', 'Apparently', 'read', 'rulebook', 'what', 'do', 'are', 'victim', 'unoriginal', 'horror', 'what', 'worth', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'movie', 'little', 'creepy', 'do', ""n't"", 'outweigh', 'much', 'preposterousness', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'probably', 'better', 'one']",N/A

The film is about a teenage girl who is babysitting two kids. During the night, she gets constant phone calls from a man who keeps asking her ''Have you checked the children''. At one point, she calls the police, and they tell her they will try to track down the man who is harassing her. After she stays on the phone with the guy for about a minute, she asks him what is it he wants, and he replies ''your blood, all over me''. Right after that, the police call her back and tell her that the calls are coming from inside the house. She then has to try and leave the house with the two kids while trying to avoid the man stalking her.This movie takes the first 20 minutes of the original movie, and remakes it into an 87 minute movie.

983588,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,B000F6IOAM,G. Garner,"[5, 7]","I loved this movie. The atmosphere was incredible. The film has a look and aura about it that make it unique. One thing that I found to be of interest was the fact that, from the start, the viewer is aware that the house is a central character in the movie.This is something I have found to be true in most of my favorite slasher films. Halloween 2, Prom Night, Valentine, Friday the 13th- one thing they all have in common (aside from lots of dead folks) is that they all feature a building or location that is essential to the movie.If you subtract the hospital from Halloween 2, you don't have the same film. The same thing holds true of this story. Nearly everything is influenced by the geography of the house.The house becomes like a little world unto itself. I also liked the girl in this movie. All in all, it was one of the better movies of this sort that I've seen in several years. (Has anyone ever noticed that a lot of the people who write in to call movies like this stupid are also people who have difficulty with basic diction and spelling?)Not that the movie is perfect. They made it a tad soft for my tastes. They were bending over backwards to avoid an 'R' rating, and that process detracts considerably from what it could have been.The movie could have used a couple of more murders. Especially the kids. I don't mean to sound ghoulish, but they should have died. It just stretches credulity a bit too far to imagine that they could have survived. Jesus, this guy kills people with his bare hands, but is unable to subdue two little kids? Why? Because they hid? They hid in a box, right in the middle of the room! Or, in other words, they were hiding in the first place anybody would look. They should have gone all the way with this thing-kill the kids, step up the blood and brutality, accept the 'R' rating, and they would have had a classic.In the end, though, I liked it quite well. It is rather like an anemic version of Halloween. The atmosphere, for the most part, makes up for what is lost in violence. It is an outstanding film........ just not as good as it might have been.You have to have some sense of imagination, and some degree of patience, to get anything out of this movie. This is a tastefully made film. If you like things like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'or 'High Tension', you'll most likely get nothing out of this. This remake is aimed at a narrow audience..........but FOR that audience, it is really good, and only misses true greatness by a fraction.EDIT-March 5,2012-The special features on this dvd are very good. Especially the commentary tracks. They have one that features Camilla Belle and the director-this one is good, and the two come across as pleasant and likeable. The other is by the writer, and that one is even stronger. He really immerses himself in the material, and takes it very seriously, which is something I appreciate.",5,"very good, but could have easily been great",1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,2890,"['loved', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'incredible', 'film', 'look', 'aura', 'make', 'unique', 'One', 'thing', 'found', 'be', 'interest', 'was', 'fact', 'start', 'viewer', 'aware', 'house', 'central', 'character', 'movie.This', 'something', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'true', 'most', 'favorite', 'slasher', 'films', 'Halloween', '2', 'Prom', 'Night', 'Valentine', 'Friday', '13th-', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'aside', 'lots', 'dead', 'folks', 'feature', 'building', 'location', 'essential', 'movie.If', 'subtract', 'hospital', 'Halloween', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'film', 'same', 'thing', 'true', 'story', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'influenced', 'geography', 'house.The', 'house', 'little', 'world', 'also', 'liked', 'girl', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'sort', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'years', 'Has', 'anyone', 'ever', 'noticed', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'write', 'call', 'movies', 'stupid', 'are', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'difficulty', 'basic', 'diction', 'spelling', 'Not', 'movie', 'perfect', 'made', 'tad', 'soft', 'tastes', 'were', 'bending', 'backwards', 'avoid', 'R', 'rating', 'process', 'detracts', 'considerably', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been.The', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'couple', 'more', 'murders', 'Especially', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'sound', 'ghoulish', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'just', 'credulity', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'imagine', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'Jesus', 'guy', 'people', 'bare', 'hands', 'unable', 'subdue', 'two', 'little', 'kids', 'Why', 'hid', 'hid', 'box', 'right', 'middle', 'room', 'other', 'words', 'were', 'hiding', 'first', 'place', 'anybody', 'would', 'look', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'thing-kill', 'kids', 'step', 'up', 'blood', 'brutality', 'R', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'classic.In', 'end', 'liked', 'quite', 'well', 'rather', 'anemic', 'version', 'Halloween', 'atmosphere', 'most', 'part', 'up', 'what', 'lost', 'violence', 'outstanding', 'film', '..', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'might', 'have', 'been.You', 'have', 'have', 'sense', 'imagination', 'degree', 'patience', 'get', 'anything', 'movie', 'tastefully', 'made', 'film', 'like', 'things', ""'The"", 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', ""Massacre'or"", 'Tension', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'get', 'nothing', 'remake', 'aimed', 'narrow', 'audience', '.but', 'audience', 'really', 'good', 'only', 'true', 'greatness', 'fraction.EDIT-March', '5,2012-The', 'special', 'features', 'dvd', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Especially', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'have', 'one', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'director-this', 'one', 'good', 'two', 'come', 'pleasant', 'likeable', 'other', 'writer', 'one', 'even', 'stronger', 'really', 'material', 'very', 'seriously', 'something', 'appreciate']",N/A

He selected a cast of actors who, while they are not big box office names, each arrives with a fine resume of work before the camera.  The production matters in this film take focus and for those who enjoy the 'terror in the night' genre of movies, this one will probably satisfy.Camilla Belle is Jill Johnson, a high school girl on parental probation for over use of her cell phone, etc. who is forced to accept a last minute baby sitting job instead of attending her High School Bonfire party.  Driven by her father to the palatial, designer home on the lake of the Mandrakis family, she is amazed at the high tech status of the home - lights that turn on when you enter a room, pools of Koi with intermittent artificial rain piped in, security system and multiple phones.  Her assigned children are asleep and she makes herself at home - until the telephone rings.  This opens the story of a stranger who calls, says little, but terrifies Jill and eventually is revealed as a serial killer.  The rest is easily predictable.Relying far too heavily on the absurdly moody music score by James Dooley for effect, the film doesn't give us enough character development to make it too involving.  But that probably isn't the point here. There is a vast audience for the constant flow of scary movies, and as far as movies of that ilk goes, this one is well done.  The cast, again, won't ring bells as far as name recognition, but they are a strong group.

983591,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B000F6IOAM,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[3, 6]","Oh the joys of babysitting. Free food, free phone calls, free porn and free unwanted pranks calls from a stranger who is inside the same house. Isn't that supposed to be exciting? Well I guess that would depend on the individual who is forced to sit through this entire movie. I have regretfully wasted about 87 minutes of my life. I can't tell you what my state of mind was when I decided to watch this movie. When A Stranger Calls is one of those cult favorite thrillers that really didn't need re-visioning. The story is old and we've heard the urban legend when we were kids. We know how it starts and how it ends. It would appear that the group behind this motion picture only had one thing in mind, THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR. Why else would somebody want to remake an R rated picture with a watered down and unsatisfying PG-13 rating? What other reasons are there? To tell the truth ladies and gentlemen, there are no other reasons. Money is the root to the abomination that is When A Stranger Calls.In the movie we fallow Jill Johnson, a naive and rebellious teenager who is grounded because of her monstrous cell phone bill. Luckily for Jill she has to miss the bonfire that all of her friends are going to. What does she have planned? Well she has to baby sit at the Mendrakis household. With the parents going out for the night, Jill gets to stay in this big fancy house with the children sound asleep in their beds. Nothing happens for a while and as Jill begins to relax she starts receiving weird phone calls. Some are from friends and prank callers while another is from a stranger who hardly speaks a word. The sound of breathing on the other line has Jill worried that someone is trying to bug her. The stranger calls back later and asks Jill if she's checked the children. Desperate for help Jill calls the police in hopes to identify the caller. Time flies by and Jill is still getting the weird phone calls. The police calls Jill back to warn her that the phone calls are coming from inside the house.Wow that is such a shocking twist, it would have scared me to death if it hadn't been told before. The problem with When A Stranger Calls is that it contains nothing original. And by nothing I really do mean nothing. The film itself is one giant clich&eacute;. We've heard this story before and we already had a movie based on it. Is it so great of a story that we have to be reminded of it? There really is no point. The scares are outdated and there is very little violent content. If it were not for the fireplace scene this movie could have been premiered on television, or the Disney channel. That's how watered down it is, the movie is built on false scares and ridiculous dialog. While the film does run under an hour and twenty three minutes it felt way too long. Nothing suspenseful kicks in until the first hour, so it drags most of the way. All you'll get from the movie is boredom, cheap scares and irritation. This movie easily could have been thirty minutes long but somebody had to find a way to extend it. It's been done before and this movie isn't much of an improvement.Although the musical score was good it was just overdone. You'll hear music in places it shouldn't belong and it ruins the mood. Dialog scenes with no action shouldn't have a frightening score playing in the background. The topic of the movie is very realistic, it can happen to anyone at anytime. The driven goal for this movie was to let the audience use their imaginations. That is another aspect in which the movie fails. Rather than using your imagination you'll just be wondering when the movie will end. Or even better, you just may end up hoping for the main character to die in a brutal and pleasuring way. Why feel scared and worried for an unlikeable main character? I really couldn't care less. When A Stranger Calls is a thriller that fails in almost every aspect.

983592,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000F6IOAM,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[0, 0]","The remake of ""When A Stranger Calls"" was very disappointing. This movie is evidence of the concept that terrible acting can destroy even the finest of plots...in other words, if you don't have actors and actresses that can execute the movie's action, you can have the finest plot in the world, but the poor execution will kill the movie's effectiveness and persuasiveness, especially when it comes to horror movies. Indeed, the acting in the remake of ""When A Stranger Calls"" was nothing short of horrid!!! Bless her heart, the young girl who played Jill was just atrocious and this really ruined the entire movie because good acting is essential to a horror-suspense movie like ""When A Stranger Calls"". Because of Carol Kane's, Charles Durning's and the rest of the cast's brilliance in the original, the horror of the plot of ""When A Stranger Calls"" really produced the suspense and instilled fear in the audience and really brought the movie to life to the audience. In the remake, you don't have this aspect and the movie, as a suspense and horror movie, really never gets off the ground. Sure, you have your jump scenes, but that's not what makes a movie truly scary...it's atmosphere, mood, theme and circumstance that brings captures the audience and the original ""When A Stranger Calls"" is such a wonderful example of this kind of horror that you just don't get with today's rubbish.All and all, the remake of ""When A Stranger Calls"" was inferior in every possible way to the original, but because of the plot's brilliance, the movie still succeeds on some levels as it is still capable of producing some chills because of the setting and situation itself, but not enough to make it into a good horror movie. If the acting could have been at least average, the makers of this movie could have been on to something (although, as I said, nothing close to the brilliance of the original) better than the norm, but sadly, the acting is just awful in this movie and the sophisticated horror movie viewer just can't take this movie seriously as a consequence. On a final note, it was very clear that the remake was slanted toward the young teenaged audience, and this may not be the way to go if you want to make a serious horror movie in this day and age. By contrast, the original ""When A Stranger Calls"" appeals to audiences of all ages and comes across in a way that serious horror movie fans can relate to and appreciate.",2,"Another inferior remake of a great horror movie, plagued by poor acting and re-made into a teeny-flick.",1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2429,"['remake', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'evidence', 'concept', 'terrible', 'acting', 'can', 'destroy', 'even', 'finest', 'plots', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'actors', 'actresses', 'can', 'execute', 'movie', 'action', 'can', 'have', 'finest', 'plot', 'world', 'poor', 'execution', 'will', 'kill', 'movie', 'effectiveness', 'persuasiveness', 'especially', 'when', 'horror', 'movies', 'Indeed', 'acting', 'remake', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'horrid', 'heart', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Jill', 'was', 'just', 'atrocious', 'really', 'ruined', 'entire', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'essential', 'horror-suspense', 'movie', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'rest', 'cast', 'brilliance', 'original', 'horror', 'plot', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'really', 'produced', 'suspense', 'instilled', 'fear', 'audience', 'really', 'brought', 'movie', 'life', 'audience', 'remake', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'aspect', 'movie', 'suspense', 'horror', 'movie', 'really', 'never', 'ground', 'Sure', 'have', 'jump', 'scenes', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'truly', 'scary', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'theme', 'circumstance', 'audience', 'original', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'wonderful', 'example', 'kind', 'horror', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'today', 'rubbish.All', 'remake', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'was', 'inferior', 'possible', 'way', 'original', 'plot', 'brilliance', 'movie', 'still', 'levels', 'still', 'capable', 'producing', 'chills', 'setting', 'situation', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'average', 'makers', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'said', 'nothing', 'close', 'brilliance', 'original', 'better', 'norm', 'sadly', 'acting', 'just', 'awful', 'movie', 'sophisticated', 'horror', 'movie', 'viewer', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'consequence', 'final', 'note', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'remake', 'was', 'slanted', 'young', 'teenaged', 'audience', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'way', 'go', 'want', 'make', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'day', 'age', 'contrast', 'original', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'appeals', 'audiences', 'ages', 'across', 'way', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'can', 'relate', 'appreciate']",N/A

983595,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000F6IOAM,Isaac,"[3, 5]","""When a Stranger Calls"" is all about things that go bump in the night, about prank phone calls, and about the fear that someone may be inside the house on a windy night. Director Simon West has taken the reigns of a project with extremely limited material, which is more than obvious when you watch actress Camilla Bell run around with a phone in one hand and a flash light in the other, breathing deeply, and reacting. The film is a brisk 83 minutes according to my watch, but its still probably ten minutes too long, sporting interesting material that apparently had trouble translating from paper to screen.The film is a remake of a 1979 film of the same name, unseen by me, but after seeing this 2006 update, lets just say I'm not in a big fix to run out to Blockbuster and rent it. This is basically every stalker movie you have ever seen complete with tired genre cliches, including the infamous its-only-a-cat joke, the music that boils up in moments of tension, and a villain who isn't as smart as you think he is. If the screenwriters wanted to conduct a masterful tale of victim and suspect, then they should at least give us something original and characters that we care about.Camilla Belle is Jill Johnson, a high school student recently grounded for (how is this possible?) running up 800 additional minutes on her cell phone, costing her parents a fortune. As part of her punishment, she has to babysit for Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant), who have two small children and a house that will have real estate agents in the audience thinking in the millions. The house is located in the mountains, far from anything that could serve as a response to a cry for help, and it is big only because there are lots of places for a perp to hide. And there is a guest house located through some dense wood.The children are in bed with the flu and there is a maid whom we see for a moment and then disappears. While Jill paces around the house during the night, the phone rings and she answers it. The person hangs up, but after witnessing a similar situation during the title sequence that apparently didn't end too well, we know there is trouble afoot. The caller keeps calling back. Soon Jill gets spooked and...well, you'll have to watch, with a few characters arriving to keep things alive. Keep in mind that Jill is no Jodie Foster, who in ""Panic Room"" and ""Flightplan"" had to respond using quick improvisation and brainpower.What does Jill usually do? She begs the caller to stop and clinches a fire poker, a weapon of choice for people who are investigating a sound that was obviously made by someone packing a lot more than a fire poker. Most of the film's hour-long sequence with Jill in the house involves her answering the phone, checking out noises, and getting freaked out when she sees a light come on (this house has an electrical system in which the lights come on automatically when you walk into a room). Never once, during this time frame, did I see anything that grabbed my attention. I was in my seat watching a movie that I had no chemistry with.""When a Stranger Calls"" is a long stalking with yet another villain who isn't smart enough to use a gun, and a heroine who doesn't seem to realize that she is in a cliched movie. Yet, there is still an interesting science to the film. Why is it scary, within and of itself, that a girl is home alone with someone threatening her? Because the film argues that females are inherently inferior to men, but there is always one heroic enough. I still say that Jill is inferior, only because the killer has yogurt for brains. Why does the killer play this game? Why not break into the house, do what he does best, and leave? Oh, because the house has an alarm system (which he manages to evade long before the end of the film).Whenever a film that comes billed as a thriller fails to accumulate tension, I'm not a happy guy. The magic of ""Red Eye,"" which has about the same running time, is that it created jolted, claustrophobic suspense between two characters, and skillfully presided over the brilliance and realism of its situation. ""When a Stranger Calls"" is in a similar set. A girl is babysitting and a stalker torments her. So? The film never amounts to anything, but instead sits on the material and gives us an ending that's just one step below lame ""Friday the 13th"" territory. - IsaacRated PG-13; 83 minutes; Directed by Simon West",2,When a Stranger Calls,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,4439,"['When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'prank', 'phone', 'calls', 'fear', 'someone', 'may', 'be', 'house', 'windy', 'night', 'Director', 'Simon', 'West', 'taken', 'reigns', 'project', 'extremely', 'limited', 'material', 'more', 'obvious', 'when', 'watch', 'actress', 'Camilla', 'Bell', 'run', 'around', 'phone', 'one', 'hand', 'flash', 'light', 'other', 'breathing', 'deeply', 'reacting', 'film', 'brisk', '83', 'minutes', 'according', 'watch', 'still', 'probably', 'ten', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'sporting', 'interesting', 'material', 'apparently', 'had', 'trouble', 'translating', 'paper', 'screen.The', 'film', 'remake', '1979', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'unseen', 'seeing', '2006', 'update', 'just', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fix', 'run', 'out', 'Blockbuster', 'rent', 'basically', 'stalker', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'complete', 'tired', 'genre', 'cliches', 'including', 'infamous', 'its-only-a-cat', 'joke', 'music', 'up', 'moments', 'tension', 'villain', 'who', ""n't"", 'as', 'smart', 'think', 'screenwriters', 'wanted', 'conduct', 'masterful', 'tale', 'victim', 'suspect', 'then', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'something', 'original', 'characters', 'care', 'about.Camilla', 'Belle', 'Jill', 'Johnson', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'recently', 'grounded', 'how', 'possible', 'running', 'up', '800', 'additional', 'minutes', 'cell', 'phone', 'costing', 'parents', 'fortune', 'part', 'punishment', 'babysit', 'Dr.', 'Mrs.', 'Mandrakis', 'Derek', 'de', 'Lint', 'Kate', 'Jennings', 'Grant', 'who', 'have', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'house', 'will', 'have', 'real', 'estate', 'agents', 'audience', 'thinking', 'millions', 'house', 'located', 'mountains', 'far', 'anything', 'could', 'serve', 'response', 'cry', 'help', 'big', 'only', 'are', 'lots', 'places', 'perp', 'hide', 'guest', 'house', 'located', 'dense', 'wood.The', 'children', 'are', 'bed', 'flu', 'maid', 'whom', 'see', 'moment', 'then', 'disappears', 'Jill', 'house', 'night', 'phone', 'rings', 'person', 'up', 'witnessing', 'similar', 'situation', 'title', 'sequence', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'too', 'well', 'know', 'trouble', 'afoot', 'caller', 'calling', 'back', 'Soon', 'Jill', 'spooked', 'well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'few', 'characters', 'arriving', 'keep', 'things', 'alive', 'Keep', 'mind', 'Jill', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'Panic', 'Room', 'Flightplan', 'had', 'respond', 'using', 'quick', 'improvisation', 'brainpower.What', 'Jill', 'usually', 'do', 'begs', 'caller', 'stop', 'clinches', 'fire', 'poker', 'weapon', 'choice', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'investigating', 'sound', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'someone', 'packing', 'lot', 'more', 'fire', 'poker', 'Most', 'film', 'hour-long', 'sequence', 'Jill', 'house', 'answering', 'phone', 'checking', 'out', 'noises', 'getting', 'freaked', 'out', 'when', 'light', 'come', 'house', 'electrical', 'system', 'lights', 'come', 'automatically', 'when', 'walk', 'room', 'Never', 'once', 'time', 'frame', 'did', 'see', 'anything', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'was', 'seat', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'chemistry', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'long', 'stalking', 'yet', 'villain', 'who', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'use', 'gun', 'heroine', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'cliched', 'movie', 'still', 'interesting', 'science', 'film', 'Why', 'scary', 'girl', 'home', 'alone', 'someone', 'threatening', 'film', 'females', 'are', 'inherently', 'inferior', 'men', 'always', 'one', 'heroic', 'enough', 'still', 'say', 'Jill', 'inferior', 'only', 'killer', 'yogurt', 'brains', 'Why', 'killer', 'play', 'game', 'Why', 'not', 'break', 'house', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'leave', 'Oh', 'house', 'alarm', 'system', 'evade', 'long', 'end', 'film', 'film', 'billed', 'thriller', 'accumulate', 'tension', ""'m"", 'not', 'happy', 'guy', 'magic', 'Red', 'Eye', 'same', 'running', 'time', 'created', 'jolted', 'claustrophobic', 'suspense', 'two', 'characters', 'skillfully', 'presided', 'brilliance', 'realism', 'situation', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'similar', 'set', 'girl', 'babysitting', 'stalker', 'So', 'film', 'never', 'anything', 'instead', 'sits', 'material', 'ending', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'lame', 'Friday', '13th', 'territory', 'IsaacRated', 'PG-13', '83', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'Simon', 'West']",N/A

I don't think I ruined the movie for anyone, because that line of dialog was used in the 1979 original. Yes, what we have here is yet another remake that comes nowhere near the original in quality, and shows Hollywood's well of creativity has certainly run dry.Why, oh, why didn't I use Hollywood's reasoning when I did my highschool and college papers? I could have simply copied my friends' original term papers and called it an updated remake. It certainly would have made my life easier, but my conscience reminded me that cutting corners in such a way would only reinforce that I couldn't think for myself.And so we have today's Hollywood: Why bother with putting forth any effort? Let's just shamelessly take a classic and do it again for a new generation! Yeah! It'll me new to the teen age audiences who we assume are too dense to know about the original, right? And we'll gleefully take their money and reward them with a subpar ""update"" on the original.Here's the plot of the updated version. Jill Johnson gets in trouble for going 800 minutes over on the family's cell phone share plan. Her punishment? Babysitting.So to fufill her punishment, grumpy Dad takes his daughter over to the home of the wealthy parents to watch their presumably wild kids, currently sick with the flu. She gets the run of the house and is told to disregard any noise upstairs because it's Rosa the maid.The parents leave and our generic heroine starts looking around the house. Chester the housecat provides a few false scares, as does Rosa, the noisy maid.A few phone calls come in, but it's Jill's friends calling to prank her. Besides these pesky phone calls, disposable friend #1 shows up to razz Jill about her babysitting job, and how it was no big deal that she kissed the guy Jill likes.Whatever.Disposable friend #1 somehow managed to make it through the locked front gate, as well as the alarm system, yet she's not crafty enough to hold onto her keys or drive over a stick blocking the once easily accessed gate. Here she meets her end, and the world is a sadder place.More false scares ensure, the phone calls continue, and Jill realizes that the calls are coming from within the house. Then the caller shows up and chases Jill and the kids all over the house, into the pond, into the guest house, and back through the main house.It turns out that the caller is some serial killer that managed to target this high end neighborhood. What's his background and his motivation?

Wooooooooowwww, I'm astonished at how many good reviews this movie's gotten.  What's wrong with you people?  I think it's time Mom & Dad took away your keyboards & gave you all back your coloring books cause you're not helping any here.  I kept asking myself through every gut wrenching moment of this movie ""How do movies like this get made?"".  Well looking at the reviews here on Amazon, the world really is filled with stupid people, and it shows.  Every second of this movie was so absolutely predictable, it was funny.  A couple questions for you; how did the girls friend know where she was babysitting?  How did the boyfriend & his friends get the the people's phone number?  There are simple stupid questions like those that could go on for hours about this movie so I won't waste any more of your time.  Honestly, I was offended at how down right retarded this movies producers have to think the movie going public are(judging by the other reviews though, they're right).  The only thing I got outta this movie is that this girl has absolutely no business babysitting.  Oh, and in the future if any of you cave men out there that still don't have caller ID ever have a problem like this...just take the damn phone off the hook, problem solved.  The only suspense I felt through out the entire movie was, when will that idiot  girl just die?  Normally I wouldn't wish that upon anyone especially the heroine of the movie I'm watching, but with this movie I couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more & I wanted blood.  I really, really, really just wanted her to die.  As for ""Ms. Unibrow"" Camilla Belle's horrendous acting; could it have been any worse?  ""Hello?  Hello?  Helloooo?""  I think those were her best lines in the movie, get this girl an oscar dammit.  I say it's time to leave this tramp to the Lifetime Channel & Soap.net(don't ask how I know those, I'm ashamed to admit my wife watch's them), cause there are already way to many talentless actors that I could already care less about, I don't need one more.  Seriously Hollywood, I beg of you, please stop making PG-13 horror movies.  Aren't American children stupid enough?  You don't need to fill their heads with anymore useless garbage, save that for us grown-ups who've got the extra room.

983601,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000F6IOAM,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[7, 10]","This movie, based on a classic urban legend about someone being inside the house making scary phonecalls, dates back many years.  In this remake of the 1979 classic starring Carol Kane, Camilla Belle takes on the role of Jill Johnson and faces the urban legend head-on.Jill has ran up a tremendous amount of money on her cell phone bill.  As such, Jill's father tells her she must earn money to pay back for her overused minutes.  So, she decides to babysit for a wealthy doctor and his wife.  Jill is already in a bad mood after being told that she has lost her car and phone privileges for a month, so she's hoping for a quiet night when she arrives at the house.Everything seems pretty normal at first.  The kids are already in bed, having been battling the flu, the fridge is fully stocked, there's a wide-screen tv, and a remote control fireplace.  Jill settles in for an uneventful night.  However, that soon changes as the phone begins to ring.  Jill answers, but no one is on the other end.  Believing it was a prank, she disregards it.  But soon, it happens again. Then again.  Then again.  By now, Jill has become very nervous and upset, especially when the caller asks if she has checked on the children.Immediately, she rushes to the bedroom.  To her relief, she finds them safe, but by now she's totally freaked out.  She decides to call the police, but they tell her that they can't do too much to help her, but they will monitor the phone lines and keep in touch.  She's also told to keep the caller on the line for at least 60 seconds so they can trace the origin of the call.Unsurprisingly, the caller calls back, and Jill does her best to keep him on the line.  Upon hanging up, the police call back to let her know that the calls are coming from inside the house.  Stunned, Jill rushes to collect the children and get them safely out of the house, but they encounter the caller himself.  Now begins a chase to survive.  Will Jill and the children survive, or will the caller catch them?This is a pretty good rendition of the earlier film.  However, I felt Carol Kane did a better job as Jill.  The earlier film was more suspenseful than this version as well.  However, this movie is still scary and loaded with suspense.  I thought Camilla Belle does a pretty good job as Jill.  But,at only 87 minutes in length, a lot of the story is cut short.  I believe the movie would have been better if it would have been longer and the chase between Jill, the children, and the caller could have been developed a little bit better.  Still, this movie is worth watching, especially if you saw the original film from 1979.",4,"""Have You Checked the Children?""",1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,2630,"['movie', 'based', 'classic', 'urban', 'legend', 'someone', 'being', 'house', 'making', 'scary', 'phonecalls', 'dates', 'back', 'many', 'years', 'remake', '1979', 'classic', 'starring', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'role', 'Jill', 'Johnson', 'urban', 'legend', 'head-on.Jill', 'ran', 'up', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'money', 'cell', 'phone', 'bill', 'such', 'Jill', 'father', 'must', 'earn', 'money', 'pay', 'back', 'overused', 'minutes', 'So', 'babysit', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'wife', 'Jill', 'already', 'bad', 'mood', 'being', 'told', 'lost', 'car', 'phone', 'privileges', 'month', 'hoping', 'quiet', 'night', 'when', 'house.Everything', 'pretty', 'normal', 'first', 'kids', 'are', 'already', 'bed', 'having', 'been', 'battling', 'flu', 'fridge', 'fully', 'stocked', 'wide-screen', 'tv', 'remote', 'control', 'fireplace', 'Jill', 'uneventful', 'night', 'However', 'soon', 'changes', 'phone', 'ring', 'Jill', 'answers', 'one', 'other', 'end', 'Believing', 'was', 'prank', 'soon', 'again', 'Then', 'again', 'Then', 'again', 'now', 'Jill', 'become', 'very', 'nervous', 'upset', 'especially', 'when', 'caller', 'checked', 'children.Immediately', 'bedroom', 'relief', 'safe', 'now', 'totally', 'freaked', 'out', 'call', 'police', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'much', 'help', 'will', 'monitor', 'phone', 'lines', 'keep', 'touch', 'also', 'told', 'keep', 'caller', 'line', 'least', '60', 'seconds', 'can', 'trace', 'origin', 'call.Unsurprisingly', 'caller', 'back', 'Jill', 'best', 'keep', 'line', 'hanging', 'up', 'police', 'call', 'back', 'let', 'know', 'calls', 'are', 'coming', 'house', 'Stunned', 'Jill', 'collect', 'children', 'get', 'safely', 'house', 'encounter', 'caller', 'Now', 'chase', 'survive', 'Will', 'Jill', 'children', 'survive', 'will', 'caller', 'catch', 'pretty', 'good', 'rendition', 'earlier', 'film', 'However', 'felt', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'Jill', 'earlier', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'movie', 'still', 'scary', 'loaded', 'suspense', 'thought', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Jill', 'only', '87', 'minutes', 'length', 'lot', 'story', 'cut', 'short', 'believe', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'chase', 'Jill', 'children', 'caller', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'Still', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'saw', 'original', 'film', '1979']",N/A

The babysitter played by Camilla Belle makes all the teen slasher film mistakes. If this was Scream, it wouldn't even have been a full length movie, she would've been killed in the first 5 minutes. She answers the phone about a hundred times asking ""who are you ?, what do you want ?"". Why don't they ever just take the phone off the hook in this type of movie ?? It's also of course convenient that she's babysitting kids that we don't even see half the movie. This way she can get called and taunted as the kids are peacefully asleep since they are getting over the flu.The phone calls aren't even that scary, the killer says ""what's your name"" and then you just hear heavy breathing. It's almost as if he forgot his next lines and that he was supposed to say ""what's your favorite scary movie ?"". Finally though after about the 100th call he reveils that he wants to kill her after she asks what he wants a 100 times. I guess he kept hanging up because it took him an hour to remember that he was calling because he plans on killing her. I guess he needs Ginko Biloba or some other memory booster lol. His memory is so bad that he even forgot his ghostface mask at home....darn.Plus Belle's character is so clueless that when the killer calls on her friends phone, that it doesn't even go through her head that her friend is dead or that the killer has her phone. She's just like...duh..lol. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate this movie, when I say 2 stars, I mean ** 1/2. It's watchable and Belle isn't that bad.

This is a remake of the first 10 to 15 minutes of the original. They took those 15 minutes and stretched it out for an hour and a half.First of all, why is it that in modern horror movies houses have to be so big?  Is big scary? When you are babysitting in a house that has it's own zip-code and a tropical island in the middle of the living room, you accept that you 'may' here some noises. Is it a killer? Or did one of the rare tropical birds fall off it's perch? You have a housekeeper lurking around in there, a step son that might be in the guesthouse, a cat, even your best friend comes in to visit. There is such a racket going on in this house it's like trying to here a creak in the middle of Times Square and then being afraid of it.The element of surprise which is the location of the killer is not as good here since it's so obvious where he is. You have an hour and a half to figure it out. You will figure it out in 10 minutes. Anybody that has an alarm system in there home will see how many mistakes this girl makes in just a few minutes. In one scene the alarm goes off and rather than check what caused it she does what every homeowner should do. She shuts it off. Now that's safe.This movie drags on way too long to reach it's conclusion and the ending is no where as good as the original. There are so many things the main character could have done, but didn't.

There were some scenes in the original that had perfect spooky atmosphere, but the payoff is not nearly as well as in this remake.I am of the opinion that this remake is better than the original (unlike remakes for The Fog, Psycho etc). One of the great things about this movie is that it retains it's spooky atmosphere that made the original a hit. In fact, I'd say this movie improves on the original in having more ""what's going to happen next"" moments. The enormous size of the house makes you wonder where the killer is and until the end we pretty much don't know. One thing that was a disappointment with this movie is that they ended it in a hospital ""nightmare"" scene ala Friday The 13th movies that did this. Another disappointment was when the babysitter talked to her friends on the phone and the scene shifted to a school party in the woods. This remake reminded me of Halloween in that it refused to show gore (which really isn't needed to show someone is dead) and relied on atmosphere and not knowing where the killer is.The great thing about the original movie is that it left you feeling trapped in the house with the babysitter.

After reading those descriptions and watching the remake- i must say that these two versions are very very differnt. I will have to rent the old one, but anyways, the movie starts off introducing Jill. Jill has been groundedd for going over her minute limit on her phone by 800 minutes (her and her x-bf had been talking), and now she has to babysit a rich doctors children as part of her punishment. This is the part of the movie that is a little slow....they show you around the house(very cool house i must say), and we learn the kids are in bed early because they have the flu. So Jill starts to explore the massive house(which is right on top of a lake with a guest house down the path), but she starts hearing noises.  She finds out that it is Rose(the name was something like that).  But soon Rose disappears. Then Jill's friend shows up, but then soon leaves after Jill tells her to. I wont give away what happenens to her.  So then she keeps getting these calls, so she calls the police, and he told her to keep him on the phone for 60 seconds so they could trace the call. Finally, she learns the call is coming from inside the houseNow Jill isnt your thick-headed big-breasted babysitter, she is quite smartthe first 20 minutes is a little slow, the movie is actually only 83 minutes, very short for your average 2 hour movie, but it seems longer(i love movies that seem longer then they are), overall, great movie, i defaintly recommed it",4,very good....starts of slow though,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,1593,"['well', 'friends', 'were', 'quite', 'exicted', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'So', 'order', 'prepare', 'i', 'decided', 'read', 'up', 'orignal', 'version', 'reading', 'descriptions', 'watching', 'remake-', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'two', 'versions', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'differnt', 'will', 'have', 'rent', 'old', 'one', 'anyways', 'movie', 'introducing', 'Jill', 'Jill', 'been', 'groundedd', 'going', 'minute', 'limit', 'phone', '800', 'minutes', 'x-bf', 'had', 'been', 'talking', 'now', 'babysit', 'rich', 'doctors', 'children', 'part', 'punishment', 'part', 'movie', 'little', 'slow', 'show', 'house', 'very', 'cool', 'house', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'learn', 'kids', 'are', 'bed', 'early', 'have', 'flu', 'So', 'Jill', 'explore', 'massive', 'house', 'right', 'top', 'lake', 'guest', 'house', 'path', 'hearing', 'noises', 'out', 'Rose', 'name', 'was', 'something', 'soon', 'Rose', 'disappears', 'Then', 'Jill', 'friend', 'up', 'then', 'soon', 'leaves', 'Jill', 'wont', 'give', 'away', 'what', 'So', 'then', 'getting', 'calls', 'police', 'told', 'keep', 'phone', '60', 'seconds', 'could', 'trace', 'call', 'Finally', 'call', 'coming', 'houseNow', 'Jill', 'isnt', 'thick-headed', 'big-breasted', 'babysitter', 'quite', 'smartthe', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'little', 'slow', 'movie', 'actually', 'only', '83', 'minutes', 'very', 'short', 'average', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'longer', 'i', 'love', 'movies', 'seem', 'longer', 'then', 'are', 'overall', 'great', 'movie', 'i', 'defaintly', 'recommed']",N/A

At first it is the easiest thing in the world. The fridge is stocked, there are plenty of movies, and the kids are all asleep. But than she starts getting dozens, and I do mean dozens, of calls from just about everyone she knows. But than she gets a call from a deranged sicko who wants to kill her for some reason.

But then she gets a call from the police who tell her the killer is inside the house. That is where the scares begin. Every dark hallway becomes a hiding place for the killer.

Nothing happens that's atypical of the genre to set it apart from anything else. There's even a black cat.

Capogrossi,"[1, 3]","I saw this in the theatres a few months ago....it is scary at points and suspenseful for sure.I would say they did a good job of taking this late 70's film from the ""disco/Jamie Lee Curtis era"" and updating it for the ""One Tree Hill/Hillary Duff"" generation.In fact, the main actress of the film looked/acted a lot like Ashlee Simpson and I think that was intentional to connect with the younger audience. When I saw this in the theatre with my girlfreind it was pretty much packed with teens.The movie starts off very ""One Tree Hill"" with the high school scenes, but then does the slow turn into ""scary territory""...I thought some of the scary music was overdoing it too early in the film, the soundtrack was a little too obvious in it's ominous tones too early in the film. IMO, sometimes you can up the suspense by having scenes with NO music for a while so that when you do bring in the scary music, it enhances the creepiness rather than making itself too obvious... I found it especially funny that scary music was playing during the scene where the dad is driving with the daughter and telling her that he was taking away her Cell phone because she went over her minutes (every teen girls's nightmare? ha ha)Anyways, I wont give away the ending too blatantly but I agreed with some others that I thought there would be some logical connection made between the killer and the house/intended victim...With the villian just being a random psycho who just happens to hang out in the woods, it seemed like an easy out for the writers. But, at the same time, it did add a certain scariness to the story that the killer was randomly stalking that location. ....as the movie gets closer to the end, it does become pretty suspenseful and scary, (if ultimately derivative of past films, especially ""Halloween""... anyways, as a 70's teen horror movie updated for the current 2006 teen generation, it does it's job.",3,"Scary, sometimes lame, teen horror film",1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,1910,"['saw', 'theatres', 'few', 'months', '.it', 'scary', 'points', 'suspenseful', 'sure.I', 'would', 'say', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'taking', 'late', '70', 'film', 'disco/Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'era', 'updating', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill/Hillary', 'Duff', 'generation.In', 'fact', 'main', 'actress', 'film', 'looked/acted', 'lot', 'Ashlee', 'Simpson', 'think', 'was', 'intentional', 'connect', 'younger', 'audience', 'When', 'saw', 'theatre', 'girlfreind', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'packed', 'teens.The', 'movie', 'off', 'very', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'high', 'school', 'scenes', 'then', 'slow', 'turn', 'scary', 'territory', 'thought', 'scary', 'music', 'was', 'overdoing', 'too', 'early', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'ominous', 'tones', 'too', 'early', 'film', 'IMO', 'sometimes', 'can', 'up', 'suspense', 'having', 'scenes', 'NO', 'music', 'while', 'so', 'when', 'do', 'bring', 'scary', 'music', 'creepiness', 'rather', 'making', 'too', 'obvious', 'found', 'especially', 'scary', 'music', 'was', 'playing', 'scene', 'where', 'dad', 'driving', 'daughter', 'telling', 'was', 'taking', 'away', 'Cell', 'phone', 'went', 'minutes', 'teen', 'girls', 'nightmare', 'ha', 'ha', 'Anyways', 'wont', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'too', 'blatantly', 'agreed', 'others', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'logical', 'connection', 'made', 'killer', 'house/intended', 'victim', 'villian', 'just', 'being', 'random', 'psycho', 'who', 'just', 'hang', 'out', 'woods', 'seemed', 'easy', 'out', 'writers', 'same', 'time', 'did', 'add', 'certain', 'scariness', 'story', 'killer', 'was', 'randomly', 'stalking', 'location', 'movie', 'closer', 'end', 'become', 'pretty', 'suspenseful', 'scary', 'ultimately', 'derivative', 'past', 'films', 'especially', 'Halloween', 'anyways', '70', 'teen', 'horror', 'movie', 'updated', 'current', '2006', 'teen', 'generation', 'job']",N/A

983617,A3RY85QM7F3XF6,B000F6IOAM,Josh Brooks,"[1, 3]","There's something about When A Stranger calls that doesn't settle with me. From one perspective, the film was nice visually (the house was amazing and the colors in the film sat right) and had a few good scares (for teen and pre-teens) and was a little creepy (except for the lack of gore that could have been shown in one scene). On the other - which I lean more to - the film lacked. A lot. I think I wanted to like the film because it's a remake of one of those horror classics that has spawned many more classics (Halloween, Scream, etc). But when it was attempted to be redone, it's obvious that it was done by Hollywood's standards and not by the diehard love of a fan filmmaker which is what remakes of classics like When A Stranger Calls really need.One has to live up the its predecessor by being more than it was and at least equaling the quality. Especially in horror movies. The only attempted scares that got me in the film is the line ""Your blood ... all over me"" and the canary scene. Great scenes. Everything else? Flatness.Although I'm not particularly big on the film, Camille Bell carried it very well. There were moments of weakness, but in the end, she pulled through for me. The child actors got on my nerves. I wondered why they weren't in it before the attack scenes, and after they were there, I understood why. The remainder of the characters had really now growth to really care for.The DVD, like the movie, doesn't really hold anything special. Two commentary tracks that I didn't care enough to listen to, although there may be some tidbits about how Simon West's vision could have been skewed or if this really was his vision.

A teen has been grounded for using to many cell phone minutes so when she gets a babysitting gig she is driven by her father.  The house is way out in the middle of nowhere and very elaborate.  The house is almost like another character.  The evening starts okay despite all of her friends being at a highschool version of Burning Man and a betrayal by one of her friends.  But then the calls begin.  At first they are no too bad but they quickly escalate and then tension rises.The creep factor quickly climbs as things seem to begin to get out of control.  Then it becomes obvious that this is not just a prank and that lives are on the line.  Then tension and action quickly mount until the final scenes of the movie.Much like the original Halloween, this movie relies heavily upon atmosphere, suspense and audience expectation.  One has to wonder at the end if there will be any sort of sequel as we wonder what will happen to the teen now that everything is over.  If you like your movies packed with high levels of tension and suspense and not just endless gore and violence, than you will get a real kick out of this one.

There was barely any talking in the first 30 minutes, but that's what it was suppose to be like. What the audience doesn't understand is, it is like that to make the movie more suspensful and when a loud noise occurs, you jump out of your seat. And I understand and I'm only 15.Now for those people who don't know what this movie is about, I'll tell you.A teenage girl who broke up with her boyfriend went over her minutes on her cell phone. 800 minutes to be exact. That was because of her boyfriend.So her father makes her babysitt to pay for those over due minutes. SO she babysitts for this doctor and his wife. And they got this huge, beautiful 3 story home thats on a lake. Now it looks like you can get lost in this houswe because its so big. So she is babysitting a little boy and girl who rest the whole time she's there because they got the flu. This house is built a little creepy. For example, the lights in the house are automatic lights. When you walk into a room, they turn on by themselves. So as she is sitting there, differnent parts of the house lights up and the phone keeps ringing from strange guy. And you see everytime she is in the living room after he starts to call her, he is standing right behind her looking through the living room window. She tries to find out where he's at and eventually the story leads to running away, murders, guessing and terror.This movie is good to watch at night when the lights are out and your watching it in the dark and have it blasting.

Majority of the movie focuses on the house itself and the girl who grows more and more paranoid as the hours are ticking down, it gets dark and she doesn't feel alone in the deserted house.The house is a work of art, with its geometric organic wood slabs and immense glass windows, placed in front of a lake, surrounded by a curvy mountain. When Jill has to baby-sit in order to pay for her huge phone bill, no thanks to her cheating boyfriend who kept on calling to straighten things out, she gets more than she bargained for.The emptiness and the eerie coldness of the house is even more disturbing when lights in the rooms have sensor motion monitors and when strange sounds start setting Jill off. When the calls keep on coming and the house keeper suddenly disappears while leaving her purse and car and the calls grown more frantic and threatening, Jill has to take matters in her own hads, she also has to protect the children she is in charge in as a serious predator lurks in the shadows. He asked for her blood during his last call, and all the momentum the movie sets up for us, all the anticipation climbing up like a branch towards the light, crumbles through and with sound and fury, it unravels as he steps in and goes for Jill's flesh. She first hides but then she learns to fight back, as the movie does a good job of keeping you at the edge of the seat.Fun flick, errie house and a crazy mad man.

It isn't all that good.I loved the original for a number of reasons. It was original, real, immediate, simple sets, great acting, fantastic music.This one goes way overboard by adding new characters and newer technology that has little to do with the story. I'm betting on a sequel, which, in my opinion, they shouldn't even try.The original delved deep into each character and gave us 'real' people faced with a horrible situation... the slaughter of children by some maniac using only his hands! It was and still is quite a disturbing thought. It also followed through time what happened to those involved and the ultimate face-off in the story.This 'rip-off' only gives us a special effect laden cat-and-mouse chase through an ultra-chic house loaded with technology! The person who plays the character of Jill Johnson does an awful job. Not to worry Carol Kane, nobody could take your place there!The new versions drags out the initial terrorizing for almost 1.5 hours. The original handles it very effectively in about fifteen minutes.In the original the gruesome murders of the children actually does happen (although not quite seen, and yet effective). This new version there is just a female being terrorized. (Is it me, or could this young woman pass for Tom Cruise's sister?).This version is definitely geared toward those who just want to sit back and watch technology try to scare us. Alas, it doesn't work.It is obvious to me that hollywood is lacking in truly great horror movie ideas. They are digging back into the vaults to give a fresh life to classics such as 'The Omen', 'King Kong', 'Psycho' and now 'Superman'. Some things are just so well done the first time that they should be left alone... or given to someone who has true talent and play the story straight. After all, the reason why it has become a classic is that it WAS done well the first time.

983624,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000F6IOAM,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 2]","""When A Stranger Calls"" is a slowly-paced, somewhat boring remake of another film from many years ago.  I saw the original, but it's been so long ago that I don't remember how good it was.  In this version, young Jill (Camilla Bell) is grounded for going over on her cellphone minutes.  She's also forced to pay the bill.  How does she do that?  She gets a job babysitting in the middle of the woods and is driven there by her father who has lost all trust in her.  She begins getting prank calls, starts hearing noises, and can't get any help from the police.The movie has quite a few shortcomings.  First, the pacing is just too slow.  The entire film is used to build tension.  That's understandable, but it's executed very slowly and you eventually just want things to either heat up or end.  Secondly, the music is overused in this film.  It's tension building from the opening credits and it gets louder and faster at some of the most inappropriate times, such as when the flames of the fireplace kick on when the young heroine tries to turn on the TV.  Thirdly, why do people need to hire a babysitter when there's a live-in maid on the premises?  I understand that she sometimes leaves to check on her mother, but couldn't she just call her on this particular night?  Finally, when the killer does make his presence known, he's man-handled pretty well by young, teenaged Jill while she's trying to escape with the kids.I don't have any complaints with the casting of this film.  Camilla Belle (Jill) and her two friends (Tessa Thompson and Katie Cassidy) do an excellent job as teeny-boppers.  It also doesn't hurt that they are easy on the eyes.  Lance Henriksen and Tommy Flanagan do a Darth Vader turn as the voice and body respectively of the Stranger.  It probably would have been just fine if Henriksen took on the whole role because he's always been good in creepy flicks.  Flanagan does well, but he has absolutely no lines in this film.  All he has to do is chase Jill and stare at her sinisterly.  The children have minimal lines, reduced to doing nothing but screaming, hiding, and having looks of sheer terror on their faces, but they are pretty good at doing that.  The rest of the cast was pretty decent, but there weren't many people needed for a film which takes place almost entirely inside of a house.The house itself is a sight to see.  It's very big, has auto on/off lighting (which is dandy to build suspense), a bird and fish sanctuary with misting spray (another dandy suspense builder), and a few ghastly statues (yet another convenient suspense builder).  Special effects are sparse (unless you consider the misting spray a special effect), but that's refreshing to see in a film these days.Overall, this flick is a decent one-time viewer.

983625,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000F6IOAM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Another in a long line of remakes, ""When A Stranger Calls"" tells the story of a young baby-sitter and her two charges tormented by a madman. This is your standard omnipresent evildoer--he can be anywhere at anytime with no basis in logic. In fact, one scene involving the guest house--he's practically in two places at once! Apparently he stalks young women (so the film tells us)--however this baby-sitter was hired at the last minute, so I'm not sure how he targeted this house in the middle of nowhere and knew the owners would be going out. Quite frankly, with a live-in maid--I'm not quite sure why they hired a baby-sitter they didn't know to sit their kids who were already fast asleep. Rosa, the maid, seemed nice enough--surely she wouldn't have minded the extra bit of bother. But let's not dwell.In truth, there's nothing wrong with the idea of remaking ""When A Stranger Calls."" While I'm not a huge fan of remakes, the original movie certainly had ample opportunities for improvement. All anyone remembers from the Carol Kane film are the first twenty minutes. But those twenty minutes are classic suspense and hugely effective. Unfortunately, the remainder of the film devolved into a rather routine police procedural. This updating sought to isolate the scenario from the beginning of that movie and expand it to feature length. However, that becomes a little trickier when technology has improved so vastly in the last 25 years. Home phones are almost obsolete these days in the era of cell phones, Internet, text messages, etc.--not to mention features on the phone like Caller ID and Blocking.But anyway, we'll set all that aside for now. The technological improbability is the least of this film's issues. More to the forefront is a complete lack of originality. Seriously this movie is about 30 minutes of one sided telephone conversations, 30 minutes of being frightened in dark rooms by innocuous sounds, 15 minutes of unnecessary and unsuccessful character development, and 15 minutes of confrontation. The telephone interchanges are so tedious--she must answer the phone 40 times and never once does someone just say ""Hi"" right off the bat. The creeping around in the dark is so familiar--the cat scares her on more than one occasion (the most overused thriller cliche in existence). When we get to the big confrontation, it's absolutely routine. No one is required to be ingenious, heroic, or otherwise noteworthy--it's all run and cry. The kids are particularly hysterical--they don't have one line in the film, they just blubber.Absolutely unnecessary in every way, this isn't even the least bit fun. Camilla Belle is an interesting actress (with interesting eyebrows). She has chosen fascinating roles before--I particularly liked ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose."" I only hope she doesn't get caught in the bad horror movie cycle many other young actors seem to be trapped in. Pass this one up.

983626,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000F6IOAM,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[4, 7]","I rented this movie because I loved the original 1979 film starring Carole Kane.  Even though I heard from numerous media sources that this film wasn't as good, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and check it out for myself.  I regret that decision.  This film (and the far superior original) take a page from the urban legends handbook with a teenage girl babysitting who keeps getting crank calls from an unknown person.  The calls come with increasing frequency over the night with a man's voice asking her, ""Have you checked on the children?"" Eventually, the sitter calls the police and learns that the calls are coming from inside the house.In this 2006 version, the girl is Jill Johnson, high school student, runner, and babysitter.  The family she's sitting for lives in a house up on a hill far from civilization; basically, it might as well be shouting, ""No one is going to hear your screams.""  Also in this version, the heroine never even meets the children before the parents leave and just assumes that they are tucked safe away in their beds.  My problem with this movie isn't the inherent stupidity of leaving your teenage daughter to babysit in a house way up on a hill far from any sort of neighbors without a car or a cell phone, but that the movie was so slow that there wasn't even any action until the last 20 minutes.  This isn't to say that the 1979 version was a fast-paced thriller, but the tension built in that one throughout to the point where by the time Carol Kane is trying to escape the caller you're at the edge of your seat hoping that she gets away.  Not so with with mediocre remake, and I assure you that the term mediocre is kind considering the way this film wasted an hour and a half of my time.",2,Don't waste your time,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,1745,"['rented', 'movie', 'loved', 'original', '1979', 'film', 'starring', 'Carole', 'Kane', 'Even', 'heard', 'numerous', 'media', 'sources', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'decided', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'check', 'out', 'regret', 'decision', 'film', 'far', 'superior', 'original', 'take', 'page', 'urban', 'legends', 'handbook', 'teenage', 'girl', 'babysitting', 'who', 'getting', 'crank', 'calls', 'unknown', 'person', 'calls', 'come', 'increasing', 'frequency', 'night', 'man', 'voice', 'asking', 'Have', 'checked', 'children', 'Eventually', 'sitter', 'police', 'calls', 'are', 'coming', 'house.In', '2006', 'version', 'girl', 'Jill', 'Johnson', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'runner', 'babysitter', 'family', 'sitting', 'lives', 'house', 'up', 'hill', 'far', 'civilization', 'basically', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'shouting', 'one', 'going', 'hear', 'screams', 'Also', 'version', 'heroine', 'never', 'even', 'children', 'parents', 'leave', 'just', 'assumes', 'are', 'tucked', 'safe', 'away', 'beds', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'inherent', 'stupidity', 'leaving', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'babysit', 'house', 'way', 'hill', 'far', 'sort', 'neighbors', 'car', 'cell', 'phone', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'slow', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'action', 'last', '20', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'say', '1979', 'version', 'was', 'fast-paced', 'thriller', 'tension', 'built', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'time', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'trying', 'escape', 'caller', ""'re"", 'edge', 'seat', 'hoping', 'away', 'Not', 'so', 'mediocre', 'remake', 'assure', 'term', 'mediocre', 'kind', 'considering', 'way', 'film', 'wasted', 'hour', 'half', 'time']",N/A

Don't get me wrong, I'm aware that you don't watch movies to get a sense of reality, but you still want the story to be a little believable. This was just ridiculous. At the end of the movie nothing was solved period, I felt like that was a huge waste of time. Nothing was solved, not the killer, not the motive, not even who he was had been revealed. I'm thinking that the twist would be that it was the kids father who had a sick obsession with the hot teenage babysitter. Then again, I guess that would've been too cliche'. This movie just lacks luster. There was nothing scary about it, exciting, special, new, or original. We have seen this movie, or this same plot I should say, too many times to care anyways. A stranger keepks calling you, and you don't hang up the phone, and go and get the kids immediately, whether they are sleeping or not, something is wrong with that picture. Somebody should've made this chick attend babysitting 101 classes before giving her the job because if stranger keeps calling you, you should get the kids up and keep calling everybody you can think of until you get some help. I would've called everyone I knew screaming bloody murder. I can't even remember why the cops didn't come out to help her, but they did call her back to tell her that the calls were coming from inside the house.

983630,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000F6IOAM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","The urban legend of the baby sitter and the man upstairs dates back to the early 1960s.  The baby sitter is left alone in charge of some children, who are upstairs sleeping, when she starts getting threatening phone calls.  When she reports the calls to the phone company she is told that the calls are coming from the upstairs extension.  The babysitter flees the house just ahead of the killer, who has already murdered the children.  There are myriad variations of the story: sometimes the man upstairs just laughs crazily instead of making threats, the number of children can be anyone from one to three, and there can be a second babysitter to whom horrible things happen while the first one gets away.  There is also a variation where the babysitter flees only to learn the calls were coming from the kids, who are not really asleep.This is a classic urban legend because it plays with the insecurity of adolescents who are learning to become adults by accepting responsibilities like babysitting.  The baby sitter is always a teenage girl, who cannot simply flee the house because she is responsible for the young children.  Often she is absorbed with watching television, which suggests she has been lax in her duties and therefore responsible for what happens, and you have to love the irony that the threats come from the phone call that is a teenage girl's lifeline to the rest of the world.  The urban legend was the basis for the original version of ""When a Stranger Calls,"" which was made in 1979 (the basic idea has been used in other films, most notably the opening of ""Scream"").  The opening of the film has teenage babysitter Jill Johnson (Carol Kane), getting threatening phone calls.  Then we have Charles Durning and Colleen Dewhurst after an escaped psycho killer, and the final act of the film has Johnson, now married with her own children, getting threatening phone calls again.Knowing about both the legend and the previous film version is of value when watching the 2006 of ""When a Stranger Calls,"" because the chief value of this movie is that it gets back to the basics.  The babysitter, played by Camilla Belle, is still named Jill Johnson, but in terms of being a remake it only does the first third of the 1979 version.  The problem then was that the sequence was too short, being only about 17-20 taunt minutes, while at 87-minutes this one runs too long and it takes way more than an hour to actually get to the action part (I war reminded of ""The Blair Witch"" project in that the film is constantly cuing you that something is about to happen but there is no real payoff until the final part of the film).  To string things out we get a lot of the commonplaces of mistakes made by teenagers in horror movies, which can be considered an homage if you think the glass is half full and a lack of imagination if you think the glass is half empty.  The other thing tossed into the mix is that the house is one of those million dollar jobs where there are giant fish in an indoor pool and an aviary to go along with all of the high tech gadgets that get to come into the play during the deadly end game.I like the way director Simon West (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") and writer Jake Wade Wall try to pull off the whole thing old school (this was Wall's first script, but his next is for ""Halloween: Retribution,"" which also appears to go back to the basics).  There is not a movie with blood, guts and special effects, relying more on suspense.  Basically, ""When a Stranger Calls"" is more of a thriller than it is a horror movie, and as such it probably is better suited for those who can best see themselves in the position that Jill finds herself.

The opening credits gives you a three-minute preview of what to expect in the movie and the movie delivers. We then move to bright scene of a high school gym where we are introduced to our star, Camilla Belle, as Jill Johnson. She is a teenager that gets the perfect babysitting job.  A rich family, a very large beautiful 1970's style house built in glass and wood, a full fridge, and best of all, the children are already asleep. And what could be safer, the house is gated and has a security system.But as the sun starts to set, the shadows start to make the large house look un-inviting and remote. She hears noises and creaks and we wonder what it is; is it someone, a pet, the children or our imagination.  Then the phone call start to come and our baby sitter starts to grew less and less confident as she starts to realize perhaps danger is nearby. She does everything a baby sitter should do when scared; she calls her father, the parents of the children and the police. But at this time there is no reason for anyone to ask. After all it is just phone calls with no threats and she is in no danger. Then she gets the call that asks her, ""Have you checked the children?"" Once again our panicky babysitter phones the police who take her serious this time. They trace the call and find out they are coming from within the house. So of course she goes up to check on the children again and this quiet night of babysitting turns into her worst nightmare.This movie is a classic thriller that is frightening. If you love Hitchcock's films, you will appreciate this. If you are looking for just gore and horror, do not watch this film. This film requires you to take the journey with the babysitter and actually use your imagination as you hear or see things to try and figure out what is transpiring. It is the type of film we use to call a nerve-shattering thriller or suspense film. Since this could really happen anywhere you will experience the suspense. And Camilla has to convey the enter range of motions without dialogue. It is the things you do not see that scare you the most in real life. The film has three stars, Camilla Belle, the House itself and the phone.

983639,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000F6IOAM,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 3]","""What are you going to do tonight?"" a friend of mine asked.""I'm going to watch a movie, an old scary one.When a Stranger Calls.  It's supposed to be good.""""Is that the one with the babysitter?""""I don't know.  I haven't seen it.""""Yeah.  I know that one.  It's famous, right?  It's the one where you find out he's calling -- """"Shut up shut up shut up!  I don't want to know anything about it.  I like to go in fresh.""So I went in fresh, and ten minutes in, I realized that I already knew the creepy twist.  And if you've been told at least three campfire tales in your life, I'd wager odds that you know the twist, too.  Even if you've never seen the movie in question.That's not so bad.  The first twenty minutes of the original manage to be tense without trying the patience.  The elfin Carol Kane stars as a babysitter named Jill who finds her night plagued with strange phone calls.  The caller never says much, but what he does say (voiced with fragile menace by the late Tony Beckley) can melt the nerves.  It's the kind of powerful scene that is usually found at the climax of a movie.And therein lies the problem.WHEN THE STRANGER CALLS (1979) has a neat idea, but nothing to go with it.  After the First Act scare, the movie becomes philosophical and ponderous.  The camera follows two men: Charles Durning as the dispeptic private detective John Clifford and our resident serial killer, Curt Duncan.  ""He's from England.""It's not unheard of for a ""horror"" movie (that's where you'll find this title shelved, but the genre is misapplied) to reveal some of the basic humanity of its villain, but this flick goes a step further and exposes his tenderest vulnerabilities.  He is made more human, brittler, his actual madness becomes a place for pity.  All of this while Clifford pursues him with squinty-eyed persistence and a lock needle in his pocket.  (If you've never heard of a lock needle before, it is a long, pointy thing that you would never, ever want to carry in your pocket.)Trying to reverse the roles like that -- murderer becomes society's whipping boy versus the man trying to get vengence beyond the law -- makes for an interesting social studies lesson.  But it's not hard to get the picture within the first fifteen minutes, and yet there are roughly forty more to go.  After this, the finale is a welcome burst of energy, but it doesn't linger with quite the smack that the intro offers.Certainly a movie that could use some renovation, right?  So thought Simon West, whose directorial debut wasCon Air.  And thus a remake was born.Watching the remake immediately after the original might have been a bad idea, but it did make a few things very clear to me.First of all, West must've been aware of the first film's shortcomings, because he only sticks to what worked for the original: the first twenty minutes.  Granted, the first twenty minutes would make a GREAT episode ofThe Twilight Zone(I could've sworn it already was), but a feature-length movie?  Errrmmmm.And there's the unfortunate part.  West's re-do steals some scene direction and a lot of lines from the original.  But to pad the film out, he has added the tricky maze of a doctor's absurdly large house, along with all of the doctor's weird gadgetry (automatic lights, a greenhouse built in the center of the house, a remote controlled fireplace).  He also gives us a few unnecessary characters (a ridiculous visit from a friend and a live-in maid ... why are these people hiring a babysitter if they have a live-in maid?).  This plus a very fragile sub-plot involving jogging.West moves fast once the movie has finally exhausted it's key line (""He's calling **** ****** *** *****!""), which is wise.  It gets a little awkward when the kids get involved, but only because they are such poor actors that West films them mostly in obscurity and gives them no lines whatsoever.  And whereas the first film shows the killer in a shadowless spotlight, West keeps him as murky as his voice, this time around the over-done gravel of Lance Henriksen.  It's a predictable trade-off, and it has predictably mediocre results.It's a movie that knows what it has going for it.

But then the creepy phone calls begin and she cant contact any of her friends for help because they are all at this bonfire-party on the top a hill somewhere in town.

I had seen the original and was looking forward to seeing what the new director was able to do with ""material"" that was now old and overdone. The ""prank caller"" has been parodied over and over again with the likes of scream and scary movie... but when ""When a Stranger Calls"" originally came out it was ""terrifying""... so what could Simon West possibly have done to make this ""Original""... a lot!!!The opening is awesome and grabs you immediately. Quick, flashy images, loud sound, phones ringing, screams... and fast forward to a police officer at the scene of a crime. He tells the ""wise old investigator"" that 2 kids were killed but no weapon was used. The investigator then walks into the kids bedroom and is levelled by what he sees. You then see about 6 body bags come out of the house, but only 2 kids were killed. You then realise they are in pieces!What I loved about this film was the amount of tension it was able to build up and carry through the film without having to use ""disturbing images"" or ""buckets of blood and guts""... in fact by today's standards it's almost impossible for a movie to get away without at least one gory scene... this movie has none.The true terror and horror comes in the form of a Spectacular Mansion on an isolated road on the banks of a lake. It's state of the art, huge glass windows, open plan to the extreme.The babysitter (Jill Johnson) comes over, meets the Mandrakis's and they leave, and she's all alone with the kids upstairs sleeping. The house is so state of the art, that she's unable to even work out the 4 remote controls and what they turn on!The night turns dark and gloomy, the wind picks up and all of a sudden the weather seems to turn the night alive... branches scrape the windows... doors and floorboards creak...One very clever tool the Director uses is that although the phone rings all the time, you only ever hear ""The Strangers"" voice 3 times... and that adds to the tension... a great deal is left to the imagination in that regard. I think had you heard ""him"" all the time, the tension would have been reduced.Add to this a few other elements, including a cheating boyfriend, a bitchy best friend who cheated with the boyfriend, a dad who's grounded Jill from using the phone, trying to reconcile her relationship and all the elements are in place for a clever story.The director really plays the ""smart card"" with using an unknown yet attractive cast, and uses the ""technology era"" to his advantage... cell-phones, caller ID, rooms that illuminate when you walk into them, alarm systems that ""go-off"" for no reason... and you have 85 minutes of non-stop on the edge of your seat thriller.Camilla Belle is excellent in the roll. An unasuming teenager, naive and sporty, she's very attractive but doesn't flaunt it... she's has a strong character and stong morals... and that adds to highten the terror with what she is about to contend with through the ""4 hours"" the Mandrakis's are at dinner and a movie. You really feel for her and she portrays exactly what the ""average"" teen would go through and how they would react - not what ""dumb teens"" do in the big Blockbuster Horror flick.I loved the fact that this film had as much ""kick"" as the R Rated Slasher films that get churned out every weekend... it's only got a PG-13 rating but I'm glad to see that brains and clever direction outway 20 inch knives hacking away at teenage flesh. The Stranger is spectacularly creepy and his arrival picks up the rev counter... he's just a ""sicko"" who likes to play ""cat and mouse games"" with his unsuspecting prey. He reminded me of a ""Michael Myers"" type... hiding in the shadows.

It strips the idea to its barest (and most effective) essentials, by eliminating the backstory for the bogeyman who terrorizes a hapless babysitter. Like a story told around a campfire, the story is simple, direct, and has an uncluttered agenda that it realizes efficiently, without resorting to graphic gore, rough language, or gratuitous sex. Like Carpenter's ""Halloween"", which is a high standard to set, this version of ""Stranger"" keeps on track, with a streamlined screenplay, a grand setting (love that hi-tech house) and good direction. Suspense is favored over shock, but with delightful results. People may have missed this mini-classic because they expected the kind of overkill common in modern thrillers. Instead, this fine little film delivers a scary, but charmingly simple story, much like the golden age of television films in the seventies, like ""Dying Room Only"", and ""Duel"".

983658,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000F6IOAM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","When a Stranger Calls (Simon West, 2006)I used to think that, while the first twenty minutes of Fred Walton's 1979 flick When a Stranger Calls were some of the best suspense-film work out there, but that the seventy minutes following it were, at best, filler. Then I saw Simon West's remake, and it gave me a whole new appreciation for what those seventy badly-pace filler-filled moments brought to Watson's version: validation of the first twenty.Camilla (The Invisible Circus) Belle reprises Carol Kane's career-making role as Jill Johnson, but that's about as far as similarity goes between the two flicks. There is no Charles Durning here-- but, more importantly, there's no Tony Beckley, either. There's Jill Johnson, and there's events surrounding her. And that's the problem.West makes his first mistake in setting the scene. Walton's first twenty minutes are so suspenseful because they are the first twenty minutes; you have no idea why Jill Johnson is in the predicament she is, other than ""wrong place, wrong time."" You know nothing about the person stalking her, or, for that matter, about her. Here, you find out all sorts of extraneous information about Jill Johnson, and learn enough about the stalker to know that he's a serial killer even before the opening credits have finished rolling. From there, you know what's going to happen. And when the two of them don't begin the game until half an hour into a movie that's less than an hour and a half long, you know that this is a ninety-minute remake of, in essence, a twenty-minute film. West tries to throw in a few extras to keep the suspense going, but they don't work; you know what's going to happen thanks to the conventions of the Hollywood thriller, which this new version of When a Stranger Calls refuses, like most films, to break.I think a lot of people will be looking at Fred Walton's film with new and more appreciative eyes now, after seeing how horribly wrong things could have gone had he tried to stretch his opening scene out to the full film. **",2,Yet another remake that never needed made.,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2031,"['When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'Simon', 'West', '2006', 'used', 'think', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Fred', 'Walton', '1979', 'flick', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'were', 'best', 'suspense-film', 'work', 'there', 'seventy', 'minutes', 'following', 'were', 'best', 'filler', 'Then', 'saw', 'Simon', 'West', 'remake', 'gave', 'whole', 'new', 'appreciation', 'what', 'seventy', 'badly-pace', 'filler-filled', 'moments', 'brought', 'Watson', 'version', 'validation', 'first', 'twenty.Camilla', 'Invisible', 'Circus', 'Belle', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'career-making', 'role', 'Jill', 'Johnson', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'similarity', 'two', 'flicks', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'here', 'more', 'importantly', 'Tony', 'Beckley', 'either', 'Jill', 'Johnson', 'events', 'surrounding', 'problem.West', 'first', 'mistake', 'setting', 'scene', 'Walton', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'so', 'suspenseful', 'are', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Jill', 'Johnson', 'predicament', 'other', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'know', 'nothing', 'person', 'stalking', 'matter', 'Here', 'find', 'out', 'sorts', 'extraneous', 'information', 'Jill', 'Johnson', 'learn', 'enough', 'stalker', 'know', 'serial', 'killer', 'even', 'opening', 'credits', 'have', 'finished', 'rolling', 'there', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'when', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'begin', 'game', 'hour', 'movie', 'less', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'know', 'ninety-minute', 'remake', 'essence', 'twenty-minute', 'film', 'West', 'throw', 'few', 'extras', 'keep', 'suspense', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'thanks', 'conventions', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'new', 'version', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'most', 'films', 'break.I', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'Fred', 'Walton', 'film', 'new', 'more', 'appreciative', 'eyes', 'now', 'seeing', 'how', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'had', 'tried', 'stretch', 'opening', 'scene', 'full', 'film', '**']",N/A

Schultz,"[0, 0]","If you saw the promos for this movie, or if you saw the original 1970's version of ""Stranger,"" then you came to this film already knowing the scary twist. There's that moment of revelation that has joined the pantheon of great movie lines, along with ""I see dead people,"" and ""They're here....""But despite the fact that you probably already know this movie's key secret, you'll still find some chills and thrills here. Although I'm not sure that the updated, modern mansion used as the setting for this film's action really is an improvement over the original film's standard middle-America two-story house. Here we have the elaborate visual appeal of a lakeside house featuring an atrium stocked with birds and fish and using an automatic misting device to add to the atmospherics. But there's almost a clutter of complexity about the place that in the end detracts from the eeriness. And while the gimmick of sensor lights that go on automatically when any living thing enters a room is used to good effect early in the film, the film's director doesn't seem to apply this feature consistently. It inexplicably seems to peter out as the film progresses, so the heroine is left in dimness during her later explorations of the house.There are other lapses in the logic of the place that can be distracting from the build-up of terror. For example, why is there such an elaborate security system for the main house, while the guesthouse is simply left open?Camilla Belle is good in the lead. She doesn't play the role as just another bubble-headed teen, but has the sort of intelligent maturity that makes us care about her.Certain scenes here are raw steals from The Shining and from Dressed to Kill. And this movie doesn't have nearly the emotional richness of the original. The original gave the killer a face, gave him a journey through the world that added to our wrenching identification with all the characters. Here everyone is operating in an emotional vacuum, typical for modern times. Nevertheless, the film overall is worth a watch.There are two commentaries offered on the DVD version of this ""Stranger."" If you only have the time or inclination to listen to one of them, make it the one offered by the film's screenwriter, Jake Wall. He has a lot of interesting things to say, including a surprising contrast between this film and the original. After listening to him, you will probably want to get hold of the original ""Stranger"" for comparison.If you like this genre of thriller though, the movie to watch is ""Black Christmas,"" starring Keir Dullea and Olivia Hussey.

Just turn off the Cell and disconnect your land line. The ambience of the film is very well done although it's a little dark since the movie plays during the evening/night hours (duhhh!), but it's very stylish from the unique house and setting on the lake, etc. The film reminded me on highschool thrillers from and/or set in the 70s, because there are no real special effects and most of the thrill is provoked by scary looks, ambience, doors slamming and other loud noises during silent scenes as well as an excellent sometimes overwhelming score, and then the chase scenes like running through a dark forrest and the stranger almost catching the babysitter -- (I don't want to give away too much although the trailer already has anyway). There are scenes where you may want to close your eyes because you're expecting something horrific to happen -- the tension is there.

983664,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000F6IOAM,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","While not on the same level as 1993's ""When A Stranger Calls Back"", this remake of the original 1979 ""When A Stranger Calls"" is actually a superior remake to what was already a good movie.  Both previous movies had the entire thrust of this new film in their first twenty minutes or so: the young babysitter menaced by sinister phonecalls.  After its first portion, the '79 original developed into more of a police detective story than a horror movie, and did a pretty nice job of it; it dragged a couple of times and had some trouble regaining its suspense element, but overall it was a good show.  It's '93 sequel, after those awesome initial 20 minutes, continued along on more twisted paths and ended up as one of the scariest movies of all time.  This remake expands the opening portion from the earlier entries to fill most of its running time, and does it well enough not to hit the snag you get when you see a too-drawn-out movie and think 'that could have been really great if it had been just a segment in an anthology.'Horror and suspense movies are often set in an envirornment of 'old' - the old cabin in the woods, an old abandoned house now shunned by neighbors, the grand old castle atop one of England's hills.  This kind of setting can take on a good spooky feel very quickly under the right conditions.  In the new When A Stranger Calls the movie heads in the opposite direction: a sleek, ultra-modern, hi-tech home that must cost as much as a small village.  Everything's wired up to a state-of-the-art security system, there's a deluxe 'guest house' on the property (not to mention half a forest), the lights in the rooms turn themselves on and off as sensors detect when someone enters or leaves the room.  If you're like me and have always found something a little disquieting in hi-tech homes that seem to be designed to be smarter than those who live in them, you might agree that they're off to a good start with this type of setting.  Now with a house like this, there are certain things that probably wouldn't be as believable or effective if they tried to do them with a stalker, and other, new, possibilities opened up.  ""When A Stranger Calls"" succeeds in avoiding the former and hitting the latter.With the babysitter, Jill, alone in the house for a long time and things turning more sinister by gradual steps, it's essential to have a great atmosphere to carry the film, and it's essential that the protagonist be interesting and likable.  Great production, a gorgeous setting of the aforementioned forest that surrounds the house, and a nice old-fashioned, spooky windstorm provide the atmosphere, and talented lead player Camille Belle does a fine job making her character a good anchor for the movie.In the 'iffy' department is the initial police response to events in the movie, which doesn't seem realistic.  Another angle of the movie has gotten a lot more flak though, and I'd like to put my two cents in on why I don't think the angle was a bad or unrealistic one.  I don't think this will give anything away, but since some of it does happen in the latter parts of the movie, I'll put my standard disclaimer on now.* WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD *In a nutshell, there seems to be a school of thought that the movie sinks itself because there are a couple of clear instances where Jill could have gooten out of the house and off the property but doesn't.  I think a point is missed in that arguement: it's obvious that she Can leave on at least two separate occasions, yes.  But on both occasions, fleeing the house would have meant leaving the young children she was babysitting alone in the house with a psychopath.  This kind of thing has happened in a couple of other horror movies, and I think it has a great effect when a character is physically able to get out of harm's way but opts to stay for the sake of another character.  Of course, when this kind of thing happens, it's usually perceived as a shortcoming by the professional critics.  The 'she should have just gotten out of the house' arguement is one of a number of reasons frequently brought out to show how supposedly 'stupid'[sic] horror movies are.  I'll resist the urge to address specific points concerning other unjustly maligned movies, but the answer to a supposed shortcoming is often (not always; some horror movies admittedly do have good-sized holes in sense or believability, the same as some movies of any other 'genre' or grouping) readily evident if you just think about how the situation in a given movie would appear to a given character.  ""When A Stranger Calls"" is highly engaging, a lot smarter than critics will ever give it credit for, and genuinely scary (although nowhere near as terrifying as the 1993 movie).  Good performances all around, including the child actors.

Somehow they managed to increasethe intro from 20 minutes to a full lenth film, because this time around the baby sitter pretty much stays in the housethe whole time,unlike the original, which fast-forwarded a number of years. New characters and twists have been thrown into the mix.Aside from the obvious use of modern technology,such as a cell phones, home alarm systems, etc... the house is now 3 floors and far away from the nearest town. Instead of the baby sitter only being with the kids(and the killer), she now has the housekeeper, and an older son who lives in the guest house to call out to; thinking it's just one of them when she hears a strange noise coming from across the hall. Of course expanding the intro into a whole movie does become tiresome,which is why it received a lot of negative reviews. The movie really has nothing more to it than our lead talking on the phone and looking around frantically. In fact, the black cat that appears every now and then gives the audience more action and scares than the killer himself! Next to the non-exisent story, we're forced to endure Camilla Belle's so called acting. The girl obviously only gets these roles for her looks, because it seems she as an incredibly hard time expressing any sort of emotion. When it came down to fearing for her life, she just ran around a lot, while keeping the same dull expression on her face. As I said before,the movie has zero scares except for a few of the  old-school boo-scares, where someone or something pops out of nowhere, hoping to give the audience a quick jump in their seats. Normally in this case I just let out a small sigh, and continue to wonder why they still try to scarethe audience this way. The movie has very little similarties to the original aside from the basic theme, and our lead, much like in the original never checks on the children, despite being a baby sitter. Though I did find that most of the dialogue exchanged between Jill and the police stay basically the same as the original, almost exact in some scenes. sadly this film really tries but is neither tense norsuspenseful, which was a big part of the intro and climax of the first. It's also sad that they still attempt to trick the audience into thinking that it takes a minute to trace a call, where in real life call can be instantly. The killer in this film was also less intresting than its predecessor, especially when Jill would answer the phone and he would 'nt say a word, leading us to wonder what' the point in calling if he's going to tell her to check on those dam kids. Despite the bad acting, slow -pacing, and the story assentially leading nowhere, it still has some ups from the original, but sadly they're few and far-between. Although it was an intresting effort into turning a faulty movie into  something promising, thanks to the dubious lead actress and holes in the script, it fails to cause as much of an impact as the first. Overall the film somehow manages to be almost as dull and slow paced as the original, only not as effective in the intro and climax.",2,When A Stranger Should Hang-Up!!!,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,3165,"['original', 'when', 'stranger', 'had', 'lot', 'room', 'improvement', 'so', 'here', 'remake', 'Somehow', 'managed', 'increasethe', 'intro', '20', 'minutes', 'full', 'lenth', 'film', 'time', 'baby', 'sitter', 'pretty', 'much', 'stays', 'housethe', 'whole', 'time', 'original', 'fast-forwarded', 'number', 'years', 'New', 'characters', 'twists', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'mix.Aside', 'obvious', 'use', 'modern', 'technology', 'such', 'cell', 'phones', 'home', 'alarm', 'systems', 'etc', 'house', 'now', '3', 'floors', 'far', 'away', 'nearest', 'town', 'Instead', 'baby', 'sitter', 'only', 'being', 'kids', 'killer', 'now', 'housekeeper', 'older', 'son', 'who', 'guest', 'house', 'call', 'out', 'thinking', 'just', 'one', 'when', 'strange', 'noise', 'coming', 'hall', 'course', 'expanding', 'intro', 'whole', 'movie', 'become', 'tiresome', 'why', 'received', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'lead', 'talking', 'phone', 'looking', 'around', 'frantically', 'fact', 'black', 'cat', 'now', 'then', 'audience', 'more', 'action', 'scares', 'killer', 'Next', 'non-exisent', 'story', ""'re"", 'forced', 'endure', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'so', 'called', 'acting', 'girl', 'obviously', 'only', 'roles', 'looks', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'time', 'expressing', 'sort', 'emotion', 'When', 'came', 'down', 'fearing', 'life', 'just', 'ran', 'around', 'lot', 'keeping', 'same', 'dull', 'expression', 'face', 'said', 'movie', 'zero', 'scares', 'few', 'old-school', 'boo-scares', 'where', 'someone', 'something', 'pops', 'nowhere', 'hoping', 'give', 'audience', 'quick', 'jump', 'seats', 'Normally', 'case', 'just', 'let', 'out', 'small', 'sigh', 'continue', 'wonder', 'why', 'still', 'try', 'scarethe', 'audience', 'way', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'similarties', 'original', 'aside', 'basic', 'theme', 'lead', 'much', 'original', 'never', 'checks', 'children', 'being', 'baby', 'sitter', 'did', 'find', 'most', 'dialogue', 'exchanged', 'Jill', 'police', 'stay', 'basically', 'same', 'original', 'almost', 'exact', 'scenes', 'sadly', 'film', 'really', 'tries', 'tense', 'norsuspenseful', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'intro', 'climax', 'first', 'also', 'sad', 'still', 'attempt', 'trick', 'audience', 'thinking', 'minute', 'trace', 'call', 'where', 'real', 'life', 'call', 'can', 'be', 'instantly', 'killer', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'less', 'intresting', 'predecessor', 'especially', 'when', 'Jill', 'would', 'answer', 'phone', 'would', ""'nt"", 'say', 'word', 'leading', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'calling', 'going', 'tell', 'check', 'dam', 'kids', 'bad', 'acting', 'slow', '-pacing', 'story', 'assentially', 'leading', 'nowhere', 'still', 'ups', 'original', 'sadly', ""'re"", 'few', 'far-between', 'was', 'intresting', 'effort', 'turning', 'faulty', 'movie', 'something', 'promising', 'thanks', 'dubious', 'lead', 'actress', 'holes', 'script', 'cause', 'much', 'impact', 'first', 'Overall', 'film', 'somehow', 'be', 'almost', 'dull', 'slow', 'paced', 'original', 'only', 'not', 'effective', 'intro', 'climax']",N/A

983670,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000F6IOAM,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[8, 11]","One time Jimmy Carter was speaking at a function that required a translator. He was surprised at the overwhelming reaction that he received for one of his jokes. When he asked the translator about it, the translator admitted that he didn't translate the joke but said ""Mr. Carter is telling a joke. Mr. Carter is done telling the joke. Please laugh."" to the audience.That's the feeling I get out of the music from this movie. I don't usually notice incidental music. You're not supposed to notice incidental music. It's supposed to support the action and keep things movie. In this movie it was doing all the heavy lifting. Even before she gets to the house (lovely house by the way - anyone that watches Merchant Ivory solely for the architecture should check out this movie) the music is blaring away. Example:""You shouldn't call before 8pm"" (DUH DUH DUH DHU DHU DHU!!!!)""I know Daddy but why should I have to be punished"" (CREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!)""You know the rules. No car for a month."" (DUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUUDUDUDU!!!!!!!!)Somewhere there's a cello player whose put his kids through college on trilling the same note in movies like this. Since the director decided to drag out the first half of the original movie to the whole movie, he's got very little too work with in the first hour before the stranger calls. Instead the protagonist walks through the house, looks at the jewelry, turns on the automatic lights, turns off the automatic lights, admires the furniture, turns on the automatic fireplace accidently, plays the stereo too loud -- well you get the point.Did I mention that it's a very pretty house?By the time the evil killer calls, you're so bored out of your skull that you want him to stop wasting his time on the phone and just waste the chick. Then he can sit around the house, eating chitos and running his hand over the pretty furniture. It's very pretty furniture.Instead he has to play out the stalker game. He doesn't even say ""Have you checked the children?"" until the 14th phone call (ok I didn't count but I should have) and when he does she goes and CHECKS THE CHILDREN??!!? Yeah that's real exciting. At least that way we know that there really are children in the house. Most of the time he's not speaking. It's probably not a psyche game. He's probably just waiting for the music to stop playing so he can get a word in edgewise.Not only is this movie dull, it's disappointing. And it's dull and disappointing in the worst way because it takes one of the EASIEST concepts in horror, and ruined it. You can tell the story of this movie on the way home and you'll be checking the closets and turning on all the ligths and securing the windows. But yet, somehow some way, the filmmakers took one of the more primal concepts in horror (the safe place is not safe after all) and ruined it.But at least the house looks beautiful.

But I was wrong. They took a very simplistic approach to the material, making a feature film that runs almost 90 minutes without substantial changes except the interior designs of the mansion where birds are chirping.You know this film is also a remake of the 1979 Carol Kane's original (only the first part of it), but the new one only gives us much less scares and shocks. (Kids are almost non-existent throughout.) Actually, speaking of remakes, Wes Craven did it better with the intense opening section of his first ""Scream"" with Drew Barrymore, which runs only about 20 minutes or less.Not so compact, director Simon West's ""When a Stranger Calls"" is virtually one drawn-out situation familiar to thriller and horror fans. To pad out the thin plot he gives us so many fake scares that we don't know which one is real in the end. I like Camilla Belle, but her weak acting here (not eleswhere) does not help, neither do any other supports including Lance Henriksen's voice as the stranger, which should have been used more effectively.

983675,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B000F6IOAM,William,"[2, 2]","Firstly, the 1979 original is not a classic, and is downright boring in the middle of the film.  This remake ignores the annoying middle part and focusses on the first scene for the entire film.  A girl gets a job babysitting at a huge modern house out in the middle of nowhere and starts receiving calls from a lunatic.  Of course there are plenty of plot-holes. For example, why should this man happen to know she is babysitting in this house on this particular night.  Did he follow her out to this house? The film had some good moments although you had to wait a long time to get them.  Too much focus on building tension and using non creative means of doing so eg. the black cat freaking out.Is it better than the original? In many ways YES. The original had a more solid storyline which explored why the killer did what he did, but made you sit through 60 mins of dullness to learn this. The remake just tries to give the viewer lots of tension and scares.  The remake includes some good scenes such as the friend returning to her car in the driveway - she can feel something is wrong.  The second is when the babysitter sees the killer sitting on the exposed beam in the ceiling.  I also liked the scene when she tries to locate the maid's mobile.  Creepy!Overall, the remake isn't that bad when you compare it to the dull original.  I did not fast forward once through the film, so that says something for it. Give it a go, you may like it.

I see a trend on these reviews to hammer this movie with negative reviews because it wasn't the same as the 1979 version. Things get better with age, and we all want our era to be better, right? Well, the positive reviews seem to be from younger folks who haven't seen the first movie. So...I am reviewing this movie on the only grounds it should be reviewed, and that is: how good was it?The first hour of When a Stranger Calls was wonderful. The buildup was intense, and Camilla Belle made you feel the fear and terror of Jill Johnson quite well. I thought the acting was way above par for a movie of this type.I can't say I recall a movie in the last twenty years that had me checking every background shadow, and studying silhouettes waiting for them to move. When a Stranger Calls did this to me, and I enjoyed every minute of it...or should I say I enjoyed the first 60 minutes of it?Spoilers below...After the first hour the movie collapsed quite fast. Things that were foreshadowed never really came to fruition. Jill Johnson was a runner, and you expected a scene in which she sprinted away from the killer. Never happened. Also, Jill's on-again-off-again boyfriend never made an appearance at the home. Another surprise was that the cat didn't play a creepy role after the first 20 minutes. The only purpose of foreshadowing in this movie was to trick the viewer. I didn't like being tricked.Anyway, the end went by quick. I was disappointed by this. It still was a great flick, any well worth watching, but the end could have help us in suspense for at least 10-15 more minutes. I wanted more scenes after the killer was revealed. Sadly, this didn't happen. Bam. Boom. Bing. Killer, a few small chases, and its over.Also, the ending scene at the hospital screamed ""we don't know how to end this movie without a cheesy cliche"" so we'll just made up something cheesier.I liked When a Stranger Calls, but it could have been much better. Many of the aspects were better than the 1979 version, except for the end.Total Score (out of 100) = 6837 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.8 (out of 10).

To put it bluntly, the remake of ""When A Stranger Calls"" is more or less just the first 20 minutes or so of the original stretched into 87 minutes of screen time.  Don't get me wrong, I think they did a fairly good job with the remake when you consider the acting, suspense factor, etc., which is why I give this remake better than a 1-star rating, but let's face it - 20 minutes worth of story from the original needs to be spread pretty thin to make it a full length feature.The babysitter scene from the original was a lead in to the rest of the movie.  In the remake, the babysitter scene IS the movie.  There was apparently an attempt at a deeper story with the main character (Jill) and some sort of love triangle involving Jill, her boyfriend, and Jill's best friend, but this side-story ends up getting dropped and never mentioned again about mid-way through the film.  In other words, we basically end up with over an hour of disturbing phone calls from the killer and 10 minutes of action at the end, then the movie is over.Given the amount of story that was removed from the original ""When A Stranger Calls"", the remake would have been better suited as a short story in a Creepshow type of movie, but it just didn't really work as a full length film.",2,First 20 minutes of orginal stretched into 87....,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,1343,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'pay-per-view', 'decided', 'give', '2', 'cents', 'worth', 'put', 'bluntly', 'remake', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'more', 'less', 'just', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'original', 'stretched', '87', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'think', 'did', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'remake', 'when', 'consider', 'acting', 'suspense', 'factor', 'etc.', 'why', 'give', 'remake', 'better', '1-star', 'rating', 'let', 'face', '20', 'minutes', 'story', 'original', 'needs', 'be', 'spread', 'pretty', 'thin', 'make', 'full', 'length', 'feature.The', 'babysitter', 'scene', 'original', 'was', 'lead', 'rest', 'movie', 'remake', 'babysitter', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'apparently', 'attempt', 'deeper', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'Jill', 'sort', 'love', 'triangle', 'involving', 'Jill', 'boyfriend', 'Jill', 'best', 'friend', 'side-story', 'up', 'getting', 'dropped', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'mid-way', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'basically', 'end', 'up', 'hour', 'disturbing', 'phone', 'calls', 'killer', '10', 'minutes', 'action', 'end', 'then', 'movie', 'over.Given', 'amount', 'story', 'was', 'removed', 'original', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'remake', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'short', 'story', 'Creepshow', 'type', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'full', 'length', 'film']",N/A
983679,AP3B615GM191G,B000F6IOAM,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","There are some movies that, when you move past a certain age, you really struggle getting into the drama/suspense of the plot and characters.  ""When A Stranger Calls"" is exactly that kind of movie.For a basic plot summary, this film sees babysitter Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) terrorized by a mysterious caller who won't seem to leave her alone.  As the calls keep coming in, Jill gets progressively creeped out and decides to take action.Like I said in the opening, the trouble with this movie is that once you are over about 15-16 years of age, the suspense themes of the film will no longer truly creep you out.  Simply put, this is a ""tween"" flick through and through, as there really isn't enough ""real"" suspense to suck in those who have seen these types of efforts before.The other dramatic problem with ""Stranger"" is how they deal with Jill's antagonist.  Instead of leaving anything to mystery, pretty much the whole scenario of what will happen is laid out in the film's opening scene.  A bit more mystery might have been the way to suck in those viewers who aren't necessarily enraptured by the ""babysitter in peril"" angle.Overall, then, ""When A Stranger Calls"" is a below-average effort in the suspense genre, doing just enough to avoid a dismal rating.  If you want any enjoyment from it at all, watch it with a young or pre-teen.  Otherwise, this one can easily be skipped.",2,Not Enough Real Suspense,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,1388,"['are', 'movies', 'when', 'move', 'certain', 'age', 'really', 'struggle', 'getting', 'drama/suspense', 'plot', 'characters', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'exactly', 'kind', 'movie.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'babysitter', 'Jill', 'Johnson', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'terrorized', 'mysterious', 'caller', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'leave', 'alone', 'calls', 'keep', 'coming', 'Jill', 'progressively', 'creeped', 'out', 'take', 'action.Like', 'said', 'opening', 'trouble', 'movie', 'once', 'are', '15-16', 'years', 'age', 'suspense', 'themes', 'film', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'truly', 'creep', 'out', 'Simply', 'put', 'tween', 'flick', 'through', 'really', ""n't"", 'enough', 'real', 'suspense', 'suck', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'types', 'efforts', 'other', 'dramatic', 'problem', 'Stranger', 'how', 'deal', 'Jill', 'antagonist', 'Instead', 'leaving', 'anything', 'mystery', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'scenario', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'laid', 'out', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'bit', 'more', 'mystery', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'suck', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'enraptured', 'babysitter', 'peril', 'angle.Overall', 'then', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'below-average', 'effort', 'suspense', 'genre', 'doing', 'just', 'enough', 'avoid', 'dismal', 'rating', 'want', 'enjoyment', 'watch', 'young', 'pre-teen', 'Otherwise', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'skipped']",N/A
