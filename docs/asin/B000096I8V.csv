If you've seen the color home movies of Eva Braun, then much of the material here will not be new to you. But the quality of Eva's movies varies, and this program uses high-quality, non-grainy footage, which added to its appeal. There are also some interviews with Hitler intimates through the years. They say nothing new, but their inclusion strengthens the overall effect. There are some questionable recreations here using actors, and they mis-identify Gretl Braun (Eva's sister) as Eva several times. I would have liked to have seen modern footage of the various Munich haunts of Hitler and Eva. But for the price, this is quite a good look at the relationship between the Fuehrer and his mistress.",4,Surprisingly good,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,791,"['admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'color', 'home', 'movies', 'Eva', 'Braun', 'then', 'much', 'material', 'here', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'new', 'quality', 'Eva', 'movies', 'varies', 'program', 'high-quality', 'non-grainy', 'footage', 'added', 'appeal', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'Hitler', 'intimates', 'years', 'say', 'nothing', 'new', 'inclusion', 'overall', 'effect', 'are', 'questionable', 'recreations', 'here', 'using', 'actors', 'mis-identify', 'Gretl', 'Braun', 'Eva', 'sister', 'Eva', 'several', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'modern', 'footage', 'various', 'Munich', 'haunts', 'Hitler', 'Eva', 'price', 'quite', 'good', 'look', 'relationship', 'Fuehrer', 'mistress']",Adolf and Eva

Watching it does help you to understand what Hannah Arendt meant went she spoke of ""the banality of evil"", but it also makes you wonder how the producers could make a film that portrayed Hitler with none of the context of the world he tried to create.

752501,AN51BCGZSQYWY,B000096I8V,"Rudolf Schmid ""nmnori""","[2, 2]","Written and directed by Marion Milne and nicely narrated by Michael Kitchen, who stars in Foyle's war, this 2001 documentary treats the relationship between Adolf Hitler (20 Apr. 1889-30 Apr. 1945) and his mistress Eva Braun (6 Feb. 1912-30 Apr. 1945), who married two days before they committed suicide in their Berlin bunker. The documentary (TT49:10, 4:3 aspect) is excellent and is mostly in color, consisting of color and especially B&W newsreel footage and portraits, Eva Braun's famous color home movies, dramatizations that are occasionally overwrought, and informative interviews. Interviewed are authoress Gitta Sereny (Albert Speer, 1995), Hitler's housekeeper, his SS bodyguard, Braun's housemaid, and her cousin. Not interviewed is Hitler's stenographer, Traudl Junge (1920-2002), who recently appeared in Blind spot (2002) as well as in World at war (1973-74). Adolf & Eva also has readings from Hitler's speeches and writings and from Braun's 1935 diary, The video quality is very good to excellent, including of the newsreel footage and, significantly, of Braun's home movies. This DVD is far superior to another DVD, Eva Braun: Hitler's mistress (2005?), which I reviewed elsewhere.",5,A fine inexpensive documentary on Adolf and Eva,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1199,"['Written', 'directed', 'Marion', 'Milne', 'nicely', 'narrated', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'who', 'Foyle', 'war', '2001', 'documentary', 'treats', 'relationship', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', '20', 'Apr', '1889-30', 'Apr', '1945', 'mistress', 'Eva', 'Braun', '6', 'Feb.', '1912-30', 'Apr', '1945', 'who', 'married', 'two', 'days', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Berlin', 'bunker', 'documentary', 'TT49:10', '4:3', 'aspect', 'excellent', 'mostly', 'color', 'consisting', 'color', 'especially', 'B', 'W', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'portraits', 'Eva', 'Braun', 'famous', 'color', 'home', 'movies', 'dramatizations', 'are', 'occasionally', 'overwrought', 'informative', 'interviews', 'Interviewed', 'are', 'authoress', 'Gitta', 'Sereny', 'Albert', 'Speer', '1995', 'Hitler', 'housekeeper', 'SS', 'bodyguard', 'Braun', 'housemaid', 'cousin', 'Not', 'interviewed', 'Hitler', 'stenographer', 'Traudl', 'Junge', '1920-2002', 'who', 'recently', 'appeared', 'Blind', 'spot', '2002', 'as', 'well', 'World', 'war', '1973-74', 'Adolf', 'Eva', 'also', 'readings', 'Hitler', 'speeches', 'writings', 'Braun', '1935', 'diary', 'video', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'including', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'significantly', 'Braun', 'home', 'movies', 'DVD', 'far', 'superior', 'DVD', 'Eva', 'Braun', 'Hitler', 'mistress', '2005', 'reviewed', 'elsewhere']",Adolf and Eva
