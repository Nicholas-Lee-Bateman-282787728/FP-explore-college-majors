Jones,"[0, 0]","The Jeepers Creepers films have to be the darkest films of the decade, as they flesh out our worst nightmares and modern fears from fear of the dark to child predators. The creature is not explained nor has any real sense of remorse as it picks off its victims one by one taking what it wants and then discarding them.The scene where it is staring at the young kids inside the bus licking the windscreen is truly disturbing. The fighting and human frailty of the teenagers is well presented here too as we know all too well from the first movie their pending fate.I honestly think if the director hadn't been up on sexual charges he would have won many awards for these 2 (thus far) horror classics.

My girl thought it was scary and stupid.  I just thought it was stupid. I had so much faith in this movie however, that this would be a great horror flick, and it failed on so many levels.  I thought it would have been forgotten.  To my surprise, they are making another one.  I guess hollywood can do anything they want nowadays.

The victims this time around are a busload of high-school football players and their cheerleaders returning from a successful game in an appropriately remote part of the country.Having picked out from a burst tyre a sharp object that resembles a Ninja star fashioned from human bones and skin, various members of the party are soon being picked out themselves by the Creeper, who has been lying in wait in a neighbouring cornfield posing as a scarecrow.Better-than-average production values and a decent set of performances (especially from Ray Wise as the farmer whose youngest son is the Creeper's first victim), lift an otherwise standard slasher into another realm.Unfortunately, with the mystery of the Creeper's identity - upon which the first movie traded so successfully - revealed, the only thing left for Salva to do is increase the gore and limb-removal and up the ante on teenage hysterics.All of which he does with some style, providing enough quality shock time to satisfy the target audience with an additional dose of humour (""You were waving pom-poms this morning. Now all of a sudden you're a psychic hotline?"") and a climax that puts an aerial spin on Ahab's encounter with Moby Dick.",2,Same old thing,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,1656,"['YOU', 'could', 'number', 'horror', 'films', 'imprimatur', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'fingers', 'one', 'severely', 'maimed', 'hand', 'having', 'acted', 'executive', 'producer', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'movies', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'revisiting', 'few', 'youthful', 'flirtations', 'genre', 'Dementia', '13', '.Victor', 'Salva', 'saga', 'winged', 'demon', 'Creeper', 'who', '23rd', 'spring', 'feast', 'human', 'beings', '23', 'days', 'retiring', 'once', 'again', 'victims', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'busload', 'high-school', 'football', 'players', 'cheerleaders', 'returning', 'successful', 'game', 'appropriately', 'remote', 'part', 'country.Having', 'picked', 'out', 'burst', 'sharp', 'object', 'Ninja', 'star', 'fashioned', 'human', 'bones', 'skin', 'various', 'members', 'party', 'are', 'soon', 'being', 'picked', 'out', 'Creeper', 'who', 'been', 'lying', 'wait', 'neighbouring', 'cornfield', 'posing', 'scarecrow.Better-than-average', 'production', 'values', 'decent', 'set', 'performances', 'especially', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'farmer', 'youngest', 'son', 'Creeper', 'first', 'victim', 'otherwise', 'standard', 'slasher', 'realm.Unfortunately', 'mystery', 'Creeper', 'identity', 'upon', 'first', 'movie', 'traded', 'so', 'successfully', 'revealed', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'Salva', 'do', 'increase', 'gore', 'limb-removal', 'ante', 'teenage', 'hysterics.All', 'style', 'providing', 'enough', 'quality', 'shock', 'time', 'satisfy', 'target', 'audience', 'additional', 'dose', 'humour', 'were', 'waving', 'pom-poms', 'morning', 'Now', 'sudden', ""'re"", 'psychic', 'hotline', 'climax', 'aerial', 'spin', 'Ahab', 'encounter', 'Moby', 'Dick']",N/A
780742,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0000E2R6O,Alex Udvary,"[6, 10]","&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; when first released did some nice business. The movie opened up to lukewarm reviews and did well at the box-office. I wasn't really a fan of the first movie. I thought it had a brillant opening half hour and then sunk faster than the Titanic. I even wrote a review for it and said it had the elements to make an entertaining horror film but director Victor Salva misused them and I'll await &quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot;, because he might get it right. Boy am I naive!&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; had a very big loop hole in its plot. Every 23 years for 23 days this &quot;creeper&quot; gets to eat. At one point in this movie we hear on the radio someone talk about the events we saw in the first one. It seems these murders have been going on for over 200 years. Now wait a minute. Innocent young children have been dieing for over 200 years and not one parent realized this? Well, here in &quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot; the answer this to question is completely avoided.I want it known I absolutely hate this movie. It is an utter mess with no redeeming value whatsoever. Usually when I watch a movie, even if I don't like it, I can find something good to say about it. Most films have their good sides and their bad sides. Not this one. If there is one big problem with &quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot; and the entire series, and just to let you know there is more than one, but I only want to discuss this particular fault it has to do with the &quot;creeper&quot; character himself. How should I put this? He's just not scary and is a complete bore whenever on screen. In fact &quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot; works best when we don't see him onscreen.The &quot;creeper&quot; looks like a cross between the green goblin and swamp thing. A good horror movie needs an interesting villian. Take the jason or nightmare on elm street series. Even though they have made 98 movies off the series the public doesn't care. They actually want to see more and more. Look how well &quot;Freddy vs Jason&quot; did at the box-office. But do you honestly think people are going to want and see 50 movies about this &quot;creeper&quot; character? I've had my fill after only 2 movies. The character is simply not scary. He looks ridiculous. It seems as if he's wearing a green rubber mask. There are two scenes in this movie that show the weakness of this character. Everyone kind of has an idea of what the plot is right? A group of kids are stuck on a bus as one by one &quot;the creeper&quot; goes after them. Okay, well, there's a moment in this movie when &quot;the creeper&quot; comes into contact with the kids. The camera pans in on his face. We get actually a pretty long close-up of it. One character in the movie says he's picking out his victims. But at this very moment as we get a good look at this character we begin to notice he's a joke. Then there's a scene when he gets a new head!And this leads us to a new problem. What the heck is a &quot;creeper&quot; anyway and why won't it die?! I'm sick of the Halloween and Jason movies already because they are killing the series by continuing to make those movies. Each one gets worst and worst. The characters won't die. As I watch movies like &quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot; I don't sit in my sit scared half to death. I'm full of anger eagerly awaiting the death of the villian. I'm bored and frustrated. And please don't tell me I'm the only one who feels this way.With &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; I thought Victor Salva had some talent. I felt he proved given the right material he could turn this &quot;Jeepers Creeper&quot; series into the mainstream succuss the &quot;Scream&quot; series had. I take it all back.If you want to see a decent teen horror flick I suggest &quot;Wrong Turn&quot;, which was also released in 2003. It is one of the best horror films I've seen in a while. Does it have faults? Yes, but the over-all effect of the movie works, unlike &quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot;.Bottom-line: One of the worst films of 2003! The movie doesn't have one scary scene. A complete mess of a film. A waste of time that has no redeeming value whatsoever.

These are, for the most part, good qualities to have. As for his abilities as a director? He's probably the least creative one working in Hollywood. Jeepers Creepers, the first movie in the series, has the distinction of being the worst movie I have ever seen. And yes, I've seen Plan 9 From Outer Space. Both the original and this sequel, are amongst the worst movies ever made. Not once is the movie scary - the new one or the old one. Not once do we care for the characters. Whether they live or die is pretty much a question of how much longer do we have to sit and watch this thing. You'll want them to die, so the movie will be over.

Its favorite foods are annoying teenagers with overwhelmingly under-developed characters. It can regrow the parts it eats, so if you cut off a leg, it'll just eat one and presto - new leg. Here's the challenge, come up with a better story using only a Magic Eight Ball and Hollywood will make it into a movie... woops, not enough weeks in a year to pay off that debt.

Writer/director Victor Salva gives us too many important characters. The teenage characters are not exactly interchangeable, but there is not enough time for them to truly emerge as individuals.The Creeper character is also disappointing. In the first film, when his true nature (is he an insane human being, or a supernatural creature?) was revealed only slowly, the Creeper was seen whistling a tune while going about his grisly work and jauntily adjusting the angle of his hat. In the sequel, perhaps because he's on the final night of his feeding cycle, he is humorless.There is also no more information about the Creeper's origin or his essence. Like a force of nature, he just is.On the positive side, Salva does some interesting things with the chaacters, especially as they realize that the Creeper has marked some of them for death and not others.

Having grown up with Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street and watching with horror at the proliferation of knock-offs, horrible sequels and descent into graphic violence at the expense of substance of the whole genre, I thought this would be another lame ""scary"" movie.  Boy was I wrong.Granted, it is pretty much a straightforward, formulaic horror film.  But I was amazed at how mesmerizing it was to watch.  The setting and the cinematography were great and added much to an otherwise typical plot.  I have not seen the first one so I don't know what the connection is but it didn't matter.Every 23 years for 23 days, the scarecrow gets to feed.  And it's feeding time.

I'm glad they're making a sequel I just hope it won't become really stupid like A Nightmare On Elm Street.The Creeper reaches the end of it's 23 day hunger strike and decides to finish it off by stranding a high school bus full of cheerleaders and basketball players on the deadly highway 9. The students have no idea what is going on until The Creeper begins killing off everyone onboard.I've seen the trailer for this movie and it looks as good as the first. It may be better? I just don't understand why Justin Long is reprising his role as Darry because well . . . HE WAS KILLED IN THE FIRST MOVIE!!! I think the new cast looks good although I really think Gina Phillips should have come back to play Trish because she survived the first movie and she was really good!

780750,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0000E2R6O,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","The originl ""Jeepers Creepers"" came out and was accepted okay by critics and filmgoers and was a nice little hit. That ultimately meant that it was ""Seqel Time"". And so here it is. Writer/Director Victor Salva returns as both in this thorougly fun and entertaining thill ride that is actually better than the original film, believe it or not. But like most horror sequels, this latest pretty much follows the same formula. The formula that the character Randy explained to us in 1997's ""Scream 2"". The body count is a bit bigger, death scenes a bit more elaborate, and there is more action. This sequel pretty much delivers on all of those things. The film's opening moments are quite good. Farmer Taggart(solidly done by Ray Wise), is crushed when he is dealt a horrible tragedy in his family thanks to The Creeper(Once again played by Jonathan Beck). These opening moments look really good, and Salva displays his keen eye for detail and making the surroundings as much a part of the scene as his actors. After the nice opening minutes, we are introduced to a bus load of football jocks and cheerleadrs traveling down the East 9 highway from the first film. We learn that this is happening just a few days after the first film's happenings, which is a nice way of making this sequel possible because of the mythology Salva created for his monster. The bus gets a flat, courtesy of you know who, and the bus is stranded on the dark, lonely, stretch of road. The Creeper begins picking out who he wants and the intended victims begin to get picked off one by one. The characters on the bus are characters we have seen before in horror films and any other genre of film dealing with teens and high school. There is the hotheaded racist/homophobe Scotty(Eric Nenninger), who becomes one of the central characters on the bus. There's the nerdy kid, the gay kid, the clairvoyant ceerleader, oh wait, that last one might be new. She is Minxie(nice name), and she is played by the adorable Nicki Aycox. She begins having visions of Derry(Justin Long)from the first film, and gets fed information about he Creeper and his motivations and his story. Speaking of The Creeper, he has most definitley become an interesting character. He's nowhere near joining the club of horror heroes like Freddy, Jason, Michael, or any others, but he can be genuinely creepy, as he is in some parts of the film, but that loses steam quickly since we, like in the first film, see too much of him. There are a few new quirks to him this time around. More flying, and more icky metamorphosis', but that's it. No in depth backstory, or anything to really flesh him out more. The same can be said for the group of kids. I'm not a writer, but I do write, and the kids on the bus and their different personalities and conflicts that erupt between them all because of said personalities, is something I would find as juicy to write about as anything else in the film. Salva tried to make each one unique and three dimensional, but it just doesn't fully materialize. After a while, they are all just predictable characters trying to fend off some creature from eating them. I see what he was trying to do, and I like that, but it just got lost in the terror of the situation and was never fleshed out as much as it could have been, which is a shame. Ray Wise was the best of the bunch as Taggart. We've seen a character like him millions of times, but he has a look to his face that just makes you believe in him. The film has a bit more action to it, and it is very welcome. Salva has a nice talent for setting and some of his shots and visuals are strong and frightening. He can definitley create a creepy atmosphere, but the problem with him is that it is quickly over and he can't sustain it for long. I think that this movie, along with the original, are much better films than they are receved here on Amazon. Not a great overall rating here, but they are better than what most people think and what most naysayers say. JC2 is a very fun and entertaining film. It has it's flaws, as I have pointed out, but with a film like this, I am not expecting an Oscar-worthy screenplay. The movie is what it is and it, more or less, gets the job done. It's a real popcorn movie that delivers fun, thrills, and a decent level of excitement. If Salva continues to have ideas that are as shamelessly fun and bombastic like this, then a ""Jeepers Creepers 3"" isn't so much of a bad thing.",3,For 23 Days....,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,4445,"['originl', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'accepted', 'okay', 'critics', 'filmgoers', 'was', 'nice', 'little', 'hit', 'ultimately', 'meant', 'was', 'Seqel', 'Time', 'so', 'here', 'Writer/Director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'thorougly', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'thill', 'ride', 'actually', 'better', 'original', 'film', 'believe', 'not', 'most', 'horror', 'sequels', 'latest', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'formula', 'formula', 'character', 'Randy', 'explained', '1997', 'Scream', '2', 'body', 'count', 'bit', 'bigger', 'death', 'scenes', 'bit', 'more', 'elaborate', 'more', 'action', 'sequel', 'pretty', 'much', 'delivers', 'things', 'film', 'opening', 'moments', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Farmer', 'Taggart', 'solidly', 'done', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'crushed', 'when', 'dealt', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'family', 'thanks', 'Creeper', 'Once', 'again', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Beck', 'opening', 'moments', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'Salva', 'keen', 'eye', 'detail', 'making', 'surroundings', 'much', 'part', 'scene', 'actors', 'nice', 'opening', 'minutes', 'are', 'introduced', 'bus', 'load', 'football', 'jocks', 'cheerleadrs', 'traveling', 'down', 'East', '9', 'highway', 'first', 'film', 'learn', 'happening', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'first', 'film', 'happenings', 'nice', 'way', 'making', 'sequel', 'possible', 'mythology', 'Salva', 'created', 'monster', 'bus', 'flat', 'courtesy', 'know', 'who', 'bus', 'stranded', 'dark', 'lonely', 'stretch', 'road', 'Creeper', 'picking', 'out', 'who', 'intended', 'victims', 'begin', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'characters', 'bus', 'are', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'horror', 'films', 'other', 'genre', 'film', 'dealing', 'teens', 'high', 'school', 'hotheaded', 'racist/homophobe', 'Scotty', 'Eric', 'Nenninger', 'who', 'one', 'central', 'characters', 'bus', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'gay', 'kid', 'clairvoyant', 'ceerleader', 'oh', 'wait', 'last', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'new', 'Minxie', 'nice', 'name', 'played', 'adorable', 'Nicki', 'Aycox', 'having', 'visions', 'Derry', 'Justin', 'Long', 'first', 'film', 'fed', 'information', 'Creeper', 'motivations', 'story', 'Speaking', 'Creeper', 'most', 'definitley', 'become', 'interesting', 'character', 'nowhere', 'joining', 'club', 'horror', 'heroes', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'Michael', 'others', 'can', 'be', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'parts', 'film', 'steam', 'quickly', 'first', 'film', 'see', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'few', 'new', 'quirks', 'time', 'around', 'More', 'flying', 'more', 'icky', 'metamorphosis', 'depth', 'backstory', 'anything', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'more', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'group', 'kids', ""'m"", 'not', 'writer', 'do', 'write', 'kids', 'bus', 'different', 'personalities', 'conflicts', 'erupt', 'said', 'personalities', 'something', 'would', 'find', 'juicy', 'write', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'Salva', 'tried', 'make', 'one', 'unique', 'three', 'dimensional', 'just', ""n't"", 'fully', 'materialize', 'while', 'are', 'just', 'predictable', 'characters', 'trying', 'fend', 'off', 'creature', 'eating', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'like', 'just', 'got', 'lost', 'terror', 'situation', 'was', 'never', 'fleshed', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shame', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'was', 'best', 'bunch', 'Taggart', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'character', 'millions', 'times', 'look', 'face', 'just', 'believe', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'very', 'welcome', 'Salva', 'nice', 'talent', 'setting', 'shots', 'visuals', 'are', 'strong', 'frightening', 'can', 'definitley', 'create', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'problem', 'quickly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'long', 'think', 'movie', 'original', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'are', 'receved', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Not', 'great', 'overall', 'rating', 'here', 'are', 'better', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'what', 'most', 'naysayers', 'say', 'JC2', 'very', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'flaws', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'expecting', 'Oscar-worthy', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'what', 'more', 'less', 'job', 'done', 'real', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'delivers', 'fun', 'thrills', 'decent', 'level', 'excitement', 'Salva', 'have', 'ideas', 'are', 'shamelessly', 'fun', 'bombastic', 'then', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '3', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'thing']",N/A
780751,A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ,B0000E2R6O,"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast""","[2, 4]","I was quite excited to hear that ""Jeepers Creepers"" was getting the sequel treatment. The Creeper is a great character and deserves to get some more screen time, and while the first one certainly had its flaws, it was entertaining throughout, particularly during the first half. I was even more eager when I found out Victor Salva was directing once again, yet none of the original cast (apart from a cameo from Darry) took part this time round. Now that I've seen ""Jeepers Creepers II"" a couple of times, I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. There's no doubt that Victor Salva knows how to shoot some intensely gripping scenes, but he hasn't learnt from any of the mistakes he made the first time round.Once again, the movie starts off well enough. The opening scene is filmed really well and gives us a very good idea why Jack Taggart (played by the ever dependable Ray Wise) dedicates the rest of his life to bringing down The Creeper. From here we move to a bus carrying a gridiron team as they make their way home from the state championships. And that's where we stay for pretty much the next hour and a bit. The football team is filled with clich&eacute;s. Tough guys, bimbo cheerleaders, racial tensions etc. etc.  The movie becomes as much about the real-life bonding of the team for survival as it is about The Creeper's unstoppable killing resolve.The best parts of ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" all involve The Creeper being on screen. He looks fantastically horrific and takes out victims quickly and efficiently. When he's there, things are exciting and unpredictable. But when he's not on screen, things drag out, with the constant bickering between characters and clunky dialogue really testing patience. But my biggest gripes are the same as they were in the first film. While The Creeper doesn't whistle the theme song this time round, the scene where he winks at intended victims and licks his lips just doesn't sit well with me. There's always this underlying sense of humour that I feel this series could do without. And then there's the psychic cheerleader! The psychic woman in Jeepers Creepers pushed the realms of cheap storytelling, but the cheerleader scenario crosses the line. One minute she's a normal, everyday cheerleader and the next she's a psychic that knows everything there is to know about The Creeper, his history and his purpose. Surely the writers could come up with a more realistic device for getting the story across.Flaws aside, ""Jeepers Creepers II"" is an ok sequel. It's not as good as the first film but then not many sequels are, particularly in this genre. Some of the set pieces are enjoyable and worthwhile, but I still feel there's a better movie to be made with the story and The Creeper.

Can the teens outlast the night and force The Creeper back into a forced hibernation? Unfortunately for us, they can, but not before he tears through more than half of their whiny, over-privileged, and utterly annoying friends on the road to nowhere. The main thing this sequel has going for it is the return of Jonathan Breck as the monstrous man-eating Creeper, who adds even more personality and dark comedy to his villainous role. Like in the original, JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 offers a few stylish moments and jolting shocks, but it is riddled with all of the same errors in logic and storytelling as before. Once again, Victor Salva relies on another psychic character to lend some clue as to what is going on, especially to anyone who had missed the first film.

Anyway, the sequel takes place in the farm when the farmer and his two sons do some work. The younger boy puts up the scarecrows (which one of them is the creeper), and the older boy works on the truck. The father walks out to do something and has the younger boy puts up all the scarecrows, he notices something wasn't right. By the time he finds out what's going on, it's too late the creeper grabs him and flys off. The look in the father's eye can tell you that he will come back later to seek revenge. The creeper doesn't show again until a school bus drive down a highway with the football team, coaches, and cheerleaders. As the school bus is driving one of the cheerleaders visually sees and later dreams of the guy who the creeper killed in the last movie trying to warn her and explain all the necessary details about the creeper. Of course, it was too late the creeper ends up capturing the busdriver and the coaches which really put the kids in a bind. During the movie some of the kids turn on each other, trying to find out who's will be next, and how they were going to live to survive this attack. Luckily for some of the kids, the father of the child that were captured in the beginning does come back for revenge, but it was more than he expected as he finds out that the creeper cannot be killed, but when his time is up he will be gone until 23 years later from that date.

A little background...the Creeper is a creature that hibernates in the Earth, and every 23 years it awakens for 23 days to feed on victims, gaining strength to go back into the ground until the next cycle.  What exactly is the Creeper?  I would speculate it's some kind of demon, given its' supernatural abilities and leathery wings, but it's never really determined within the films, at least to my knowledge.The film starts off on a farm, with a boy working to secure scarecrows within a cornfield.  Upon noticing one of the scarecrows is different than the others, namely that it's moving (yes, Dorothy, he's looking for a heart, among other body parts), the boy soon learns that the scarecrow is none other than the Creeper, and both the Creeper and the boy quickly vanish, much to the father and the boy's older brother's dismay.  Cut to a bus full of high school football players, a few cheerleaders, some football staff, and a couple of coaches traveling on a fairly desolate stretch of road (is there any other kind in movies like this?)  After the bus suffers a flat tire from rather peculiar means, the occupants soon find themselves under attack from the devious fiend.  They try to fend off their attacker, but as we know because we've already seen the first movie, it will not be deterred.  It's your flesh it wants, and once it picks you, that's it, buddy boy.  Can nothing stop this vile beast, or are all chosen (it chooses its' victims by smell i.e. if you have the right scent for the particular body part its' looking for, you're in trouble) destined to be blue-plate specials?The film plays up nicely to the first, and the setting of the bus added a real sense of claustrophobia.  This follow up to the first does offer a bit more information about the creature, but less than most probably would have preferred, leaving a sense of wanting.  The scares, for the most part, were pretty genuine, but I did find the 'jump out and scare you' technique a little overused.  We do get to see a lot more of the Creeper in this film than the last, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was for the better.  The effects for the Creeper are really sharp, but I felt as far as his abilities went, there seemed discrepancies.  Given what it seemed to be able to do, like ripping the roof off an automobile, he seemed to have a decent amount of difficulty getting into the bus.  The factor that it used fear to sniff out potential victims was bandied about, so I figure maybe it was just trying to work the kids up.  But still, at some points the creeper seemed vulnerable compared to other points when it seemed unstoppable.  And something else that kind of bothered me...there seemed to be a number of scenes with bare-chested young men and given the director's past (I am not going to go into it here, look it up), I felt a little creeped out.  It seemed like a side of the director was coming out that I really wasn't interested in seeing.  And all the silly tension created within the group based on first racial and sexual stereotypes, and then the mirroring of these stereotypes to those 'chosen' and 'not chosen' by the Creeper seemed so very obvious.  Where's the subtlety?  And I'm no prude, but the excessive use of profanity seemed to get a little out of hand.  Sometimes less is more, and in this case, that would have held true.  The main thing missing from this film compared to the first was a real likeability of the characters.  In the first, we were able to learn about the characters in fairly good detail, spending time with them.  Here, most of the characters are presented in an unfavorable light, with little focus on if and why we should like them, giving us little reason to see them make it to the end of the movie.  Given the copious number of characters in this film, that kind of intimacy would have been difficult, but not impossible.As far as stars, I really only recognized character actor Ray Wise, who played a farmer and the father of the first boy abducted in the film.  His scenes were great, especially as he tries to avenge his son by use of a pneumatic fence post driver mounted on the back of a pick-up truck.  Ahhh, revenge is a plate best served cold, or a six-foot wooden post skewering your enemy's sternum...also, returning from the first film is Justin Long, reprising his role as Darry. Gina Philips, who starred as his sister Trish, declined to come back.The picture looks really good, in wide screen anamorphic format, and there's quite a bit of special features including commentaries by the director, another by the actor who plays the Creeper along with a makeup effects person and a production illustrator, featurettes on the making of the film, special effects, music, photo galleries, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes and more (whew, dat's a lot of schtuff)...despite the films shortcomings (I noticed a definite lack of atmosphere), fans of the first shouldn't be disappointed, as this film doesn't suffer too much from the dreaded 'sequelitis' (no budget, no story, and a persistent feeling that the only reason the film was made was to cash in on the first) that many do...yeah, I'm talking to you, Starship Troopers 2...Cookieman108",3,"He can taste your fear, among other things...",1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,5539,"['Creeper', 'back', 'am', 'not', 'talking',

The acting is adequate and the storyline is interesting, but there seem to be no surprises this time around.  The Creeper has ditched his scary old truck in favor of flying.  Overblown computer effects run rampant in this installment and fail to deliver any good moments.  The starry nighttime sky looks hopelessly fake.  The scariest scene of all, of the Creeper standing in the field, was cut out and can only be seen in the dvd deleted scenes section.  I didn't even have Florida locations to stimulate my interest in this flick, they shot it somewhere in California with mountains, even though it is supposed to be the same general area the Creeper haunted in the original.My advice:  If you watched the original and enjoyed it, don't expect as much of this one.  This installment fails to measure up to the original.  It plays out like an episode of ""Survivor"".  I hope that whenever Victor Salva decides to do Jeepers 3 he goes back to his well-established talent for campfire storytelling demonstrated in the original.

780773,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0000E2R6O,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 14]","I'm afraid I'm going to be rather harsh in my assessment of this extremely needless sequel.  Writer/director Victor Salva obviously does not agree with one of my central tenets of effective horror: once you show us the monster, the monster can no longer frighten us.  The original Jeepers Creepers started out extremely creepy then went downhill midway through - once we saw the true face of the Creeper.  This sequel's opening scene is a good one, featuring the Creeper in his black trench coat and hat posing as a scarecrow, but there is not one remotely unsettling scene that takes place after that.  Salva concentrated on making the monster uglier and slimier, obviously counting on that to scare us - but it doesn't.  We've already seen all this before.Supposedly, there was not going to be a sequel to Jeepers Creepers; admittedly, it's hard to make a follow-up to a film featuring a creature that only appears every 23 years.  Here, though, we are told that events follow immediately those of the first movie - it's the end of the same 23-day period.  Of course, the premise here is very different (and I am still very disappointed that the ultra-gorgeous Gina Philips did not have a part in this film).  You've got a school bus full of  very annoying teenagers returning home from their state basketball championship win (and why there are only three cheerleaders, I have no idea); they break down in the middle of nowhere and soon find themselves harassed and attacked by this terrifying creature with huge wings, sharp claws, and a pretty nasty appetite.  Of course, there's no way they can figure out just what the monster is - unless, of course, some girl falls into a temporary fugue state and learns all about him in a dream.  We see this dream, and it doesn't include half of the information the girl imparts to her classmates.  There's no explanation as to how this girl learns all of this, and that really annoys me.The film quickly becomes an exercise in tedium as the Creeper attacks, pauses, and attacks again while the teenagers try to stay alive, argue whether or not to try and leave the bus, and fight among themselves.  These trivial teenaged arguments are supposed to make these characters seem ""real"" and thereby make us feel connected to them.  Personally, it just made me hate the whole lot of them and yearn desperately for their deaths.  Unfortunately, I really couldn't even pull for the Creeper, as he really just doesn't appeal to me as a monster.  All of the close-up shots of him tend to make me feel as if Salva is trying to force me into really being horrified by him, but the fact is I really have little feeling for the Creeper one way or the other.  To me, the storyline of Jeepers Creepers 2 was really just an excuse for creating tons of special effects - much, much more than we saw in the original film.  The visual effects are pretty good for the most part (except for the one decapitation scene, which Salva managed to turn into something just plain silly), but special effects should serve to augment the story, not take its place.It's true that there are a bunch of special features included on the DVD - some fifteen minutes of deleted or edited scenes, two commentaries, and a whole host of making-of and behind-the-scenes featurettes, but no amount of special features can make up for a weak and disappointing film.",2,"A weak, disappointing, needless sequel",1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,3367,"[""'m"", 'afraid', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'rather', 'harsh', 'assessment', 'extremely', 'needless', 'sequel', 'Writer/director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'obviously', 'not', 'agree', 'one', 'central', 'tenets', 'effective', 'horror', 'once', 'show', 'monster', 'monster', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'frighten', 'original', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'started', 'out', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'then', 'went', 'downhill', 'midway', 'saw', 'true', 'face', 'Creeper', 'sequel', 'opening', 'scene', 'good', 'one', 'featuring', 'Creeper', 'black', 'trench', 'coat', 'hat', 'posing', 'scarecrow', 'not', 'one', 'remotely', 'unsettling', 'scene', 'place', 'Salva', 'concentrated', 'making', 'monster', 'uglier', 'slimier', 'obviously', 'counting', 'scare', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'before.Supposedly', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'sequel', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'admittedly', 'hard', 'make', 'follow-up', 'film', 'featuring', 'creature', 'only', '23', 'years', 'Here', 'though', 'are', 'told', 'events', 'follow', 'immediately', 'first', 'movie', 'end', 'same', '23-day', 'period', 'course', 'premise', 'here', 'very', 'different', 'am', 'still', 'very', 'disappointed', 'ultra-gorgeous', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'part', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'school', 'bus', 'full', 'very', 'annoying', 'teenagers', 'returning', 'home', 'state', 'basketball', 'championship', 'win', 'why', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'cheerleaders', 'have', 'idea', 'break', 'down', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'soon', 'find', 'harassed', 'attacked', 'terrifying', 'creature', 'huge', 'wings', 'sharp', 'claws', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'appetite', 'course', 'way', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'monster', 'course', 'girl', 'temporary', 'fugue', 'state', 'dream', 'see', 'dream', ""n't"", 'include', 'half', 'information', 'girl', 'classmates', 'explanation', 'how', 'girl', 'really', 'me.The', 'film', 'quickly', 'exercise', 'tedium', 'Creeper', 'attacks', 'pauses', 'attacks', 'again', 'teenagers', 'try', 'stay', 'alive', 'argue', 'not', 'try', 'leave', 'bus', 'fight', 'trivial', 'teenaged', 'arguments', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'thereby', 'make', 'feel', 'connected', 'Personally', 'just', 'made', 'hate', 'whole', 'lot', 'yearn', 'desperately', 'deaths', 'Unfortunately', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'pull', 'Creeper', 'really', 'just', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'monster', 'close-up', 'shots', 'tend', 'make', 'feel', 'Salva', 'trying', 'force', 'really', 'being', 'horrified', 'fact', 'really', 'have', 'little', 'feeling', 'Creeper', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'storyline', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'excuse', 'creating', 'tons', 'special', 'effects', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'saw', 'original', 'film', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'one', 'decapitation', 'scene', 'Salva', 'managed', 'turn', 'something', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'special', 'effects', 'should', 'serve', 'augment', 'story', 'not', 'take', 'place.It', 'true', 'are', 'bunch', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'DVD', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'edited', 'scenes', 'two', 'commentaries', 'whole', 'host', 'making-of', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'amount', 'special', 'features', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'weak', 'disappointing', 'film']",N/A

Only problem: The Creeper might be a difficult first date, since he has a few hard to meet needs.Like: flying away with his dreamboat to a great height, tearing him to bloody ribbons, and then dropping the---er, remaining chunks---back to Earth.Listen up: for all who dug on sicky Victor Salva's first opus ""Jeepers Creepers"", Numero Dos in the ongoing saga of a Creeper, a busload of football players, and a hunka-hunka-burning-Love---well, Numero Dos provides more of the same.It's got more of the Creeper: the winged, insectile Killer who provdes Fluoride was a great idea. What a great smile! Anyway, every 23 years, for 23 days, the Creeper gets to eat.Oh, and sniff undies.And let me tell ya, he's got a powerful hankerin' to do both, in vast quantities, so I don't have to dwell on the fact that when a schoolbus full of big, brainless (but meaty! well fed! prime rib, baby!) jocks breaks down on I-6 just about 180 miles down the road from BFE-nowhere---well, I don't have to put to fine a point on it, do I?Mad Killing ensues.Oh, and Jeepers also has a great stock character: the Mad Obsessed Crusader, our modern Ahab, in this case a wild-eyed Ray Wise, playing grieving father with a truck-mounted harpoon Jack Taggart, whose son was---erm, eaten---by the Creeper. You expect him to grab a cheerleader and burst out with ""we MUST dance for LAURA!"" at any moment.Now: it may very well seem that I'm being way too glib about Jeepers, and that might suggest I don't *really* dig it. Not so. Salva has his finger on the pulse of something deeply disturbing, something whose sinister sexuality is not at all veiled. Something monstrous, truly twisted, deliciously warped. Look, for instance, at how the Creeper---more of an insect than anything even dimly related to a warm-blooded serial kiler---plays with his victims before chowing down.Salva has spiked his demented little sideshow with some truly scarifying sequences. Take the one where a crippled victim is crawling away from the dismembered Creeper---now nothing but a torso and a very hungry head---only to see the Creeper propelling its mangled torso through the air after him---in a hop that could easily have been choreagraphed in Hell.At the end of the day, Salva has brewed up a potent, nasty, decidedly lethal little brew of a horror flick, a battle to the bloody end between what amounts to a great white landshark in a duster (with good teeth!) and a schoolbus full of raging hormones.Call it Hell on the Prairie, if you like, or even an Away Game.I'll call it Dinner.JSG",4,Hallelujah it's raining Men!,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,2771,"['Meet', 'Creeper', 'single', 'alone', 'little', 'reserved', 'might', 'call', 'Boy', 'Next', 'Door', 'really', '-listens', 'well', '-ummm', '-knitting', 'Really', 'nice', 'teeth', 'Looking', 'hook', 'up', 'hunky', 'football', 'player', 'type', 'Only', 'problem', 'Creeper', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'first', 'date', 'few', 'hard', 'meet', 'needs.Like', 'flying', 'away', 'dreamboat', 'great', 'height', 'tearing', 'bloody', 'ribbons', 'then', 'dropping', '-er', 'remaining', 'chunks', '-back', 'Earth.Listen', 'up', 'who', 'dug', 'sicky', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'first', 'opus', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'Numero', 'Dos', 'ongoing', 'saga', 'Creeper', 'busload', 'football', 'players', 'hunka-hunka-burning-Love', '-well', 'Numero', 'Dos', 'more', 'same.It', 'got', 'more', 'Creeper', 'winged', 'insectile', 'Killer', 'who', 'provdes', 'Fluoride', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'What', 'great', 'smile', 'Anyway', '23', 'years', '23', 'days', 'Creeper', 'eat.Oh', 'sniff', 'undies.And', 'let', 'tell', 'ya', 'got', 'powerful', 'hankerin', 'do', 'vast', 'quantities', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dwell', 'fact', 'when', 'schoolbus', 'full', 'big', 'brainless', 'meaty', 'well', 'fed', 'prime', 'rib', 'baby', 'breaks', 'down', 'I-6', 'just', '180', 'miles', 'down', 'road', 'BFE-nowhere', '-well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'fine', 'point', 'do', 'Mad', 'Killing', 'ensues.Oh', 'Jeepers', 'also', 'great', 'stock', 'character', 'Mad', 'Obsessed', 'Crusader', 'modern', 'Ahab', 'case', 'wild-eyed', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'playing', 'grieving', 'father', 'truck-mounted', 'harpoon', 'Jack', 'Taggart', 'son', 'was', '-erm', 'eaten', '-by', 'Creeper', 'expect', 'grab', 'cheerleader', 'burst', 'out', 'MUST', 'dance', 'LAURA', 'moment.Now', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'seem', ""'m"", 'being', 'way', 'too', 'glib', 'Jeepers', 'might', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", '*really*', 'dig', 'Not', 'so', 'Salva', 'finger', 'pulse', 'something', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'something', 'sinister', 'sexuality', 'not', 'veiled', 'Something', 'monstrous', 'truly', 'twisted', 'deliciously', 'warped', 'Look', 'instance', 'how', 'Creeper', '-more', 'insect', 'anything', 'even', 'dimly', 'related', 'warm-blooded', 'serial', 'kiler', 'victims', 'chowing', 'down.Salva', 'spiked', 'demented', 'little', 'sideshow', 'truly', 'scarifying', 'sequences', 'Take', 'one', 'where', 'crippled', 'victim', 'crawling', 'away', 'dismembered', 'Creeper', '-now', 'nothing', 'torso', 'very', 'hungry', 'head', '-only', 'see', 'Creeper', 'propelling', 'mangled', 'torso', 'air', '-in', 'hop', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'choreagraphed', 'Hell.At', 'end', 'day', 'Salva', 'brewed', 'up', 'potent', 'nasty', 'decidedly', 'lethal', 'little', 'brew', 'horror', 'flick', 'battle', 'bloody', 'end', 'what', 'amounts', 'great', 'white', 'landshark', 'duster', 'good', 'teeth', 'schoolbus', 'full', 'raging', 'hormones.Call', 'Hell', 'Prairie', 'like', 'even', 'Away', 'Game.I', ""'ll"", 'call', 'Dinner.JSG']",N/A

The second intallment of this seemingly perpetual series is just okay.  The CGI work is respectable but not amazing, as is the cinematography and direction.  As far as horror sequels go, however, this is certainly a notch above par.  But director Victor Salva should move on to something else.  As with the immortal &quot;Freddy&quot; from &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; the sequels turned into second-rate horror camp.  In the original, Freddy was truly terrifying, but later succumbed to poorly written &quot;one-liners&quot; and bad puns.  Thank the heavens the Creeper doesn't speak!!!

It was scary. It was a little funny. It was overall a fun movie. But this movie feels like just an add on in the seris. Just something to make a little extra money. If you read my reviews, you'll see that I rated this the same as ""Freddy vs Jason"" because this, like Freddy, is entertaining, but it lacks a certain feel for a horror movie. Much like ""28 Days Later..."", that movie was more of a drama with a small bit of horror to appeal to young teenagers. This movie was all horror. My ideal horror film would be three quarters scary, and the other quarter as a personal story for the main character. All of the people that I though were main characters died somewhere in this. That's why I loved the first movie. There was only about five characters and the main two go through the personal storyline of being together and they face many challenges to try and survive. In this one all they did was curse and The Creeper killed them and blood was around. The movie had no story, there's no story.It starts with a black screen. We see the words ""Every 23rd spring, for 23 days, it gets to eat,"" We then see an open field and then the words Day 22. A boy is being instructed to put up scarecrows. He then sees one that looks a little odd, because scarecrows don't move their heads. A few minutes later the boy is taken by a large black monster with a hat and wings. The boys father Farmer Taggart and brother Jack Jr. look into the sky where the boy was moments ago.Day 23...A school bus is driving down a road, holding football players and a few cheerleaders returning from a championshio outing, when all of a sudden one of the tires breaks out. The driver Betty goes out and finds a strange thing in the tire with a human tooth. They decide to continue to drive when another one of those things breaks another tire, this time it has the bottom of a belly. They don't know that it's The Creeper, trying to break down the bus, waiting for night to pick out his future victiums. When night comes and no help coming, The Creepers kills the Betty and the two coaches, leaving cheerleaders Minxie and Rhonda, and football players D, Scott, Izzy, Dante, Jake, and the equipment manenger Bucky, alone without adults. But then when The Creepers comes at night and picks out whom he wants to kill, the kids have to be on high alert before they become The Creepers late night snack. Meanwhile in a farm, Faggart and his son prepare to get revenge on The Creeper for taking his son from him.Like I said, writer/director Victor Salvo, does not have the charm and fun of ""Jeepers Creepers,"" in this installment as it did in the first. Although that downfall was present, the film wasn't a total loss and was still very entertaining if not a good movie for it's genre. I liked ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" but it is not a great movie that I would recommedend for the screen. Wait for the video. The same with ""Freddy vs Jason"" although the only reason that got three was because of the weak beginning. This movies the opposite, a nice strong first half hour and then drags a little towards the end. Then a nice twist at the ending. Another highlight is that you get to see The Creepers face multiple timie and there is better special effects, but I like a great storyline more then great special effects.

""Did I see its head move?"" He looks away. The scarecrow is still but the head looks live. It's different. There is only the cry of a crow. The air is eerie, empty, quiet, too quiet, as if the silence offers its own warning of danger. The crows stir, break into flight and scream. The scarecrow definitely moved. ""Run! Run! Run! The father hears his son's scream, a scream that grows fainter from distance. The father cries and is enraged at his own powerlessness to save his youngest. The terror has just begun, but so has the calculated revenge.The father welds and hammers like a man with a vengeance because that is what he has. The clang of steel on steel increases his resolve, his purpose, and it only dissipates his rage. Vengeance can be very cold. His only company is his older son, his tools, and his shortwave radio.The school bus is filled with cheerleaders and the team on their way home from the game. ""Am I dreaming or seeing things?"" as one cheerleader sees a boy at the side of road with part of his head missing. He is screaming what she can't hear but can read on his lips. It's a warning--""Go back!"" as his arms work vigorously toward the opposite direction the bus is traveling. As darkness envelopes the evening dusk, the cheerleader discovers more outside her window, something the others cannot see. Now it's a creature that looks like a man's head on a flying scarecrow, and it is keeping pace with the bus's speed..  Suddenly, our Freddy Krueger imitation hurls something sharp and one tire on the bus goes flat. The terror begins in a new place.There are no huge stars in this movie that has a mediocre script and a strong teenage appeal, but the acting definitely delivers and adds to the fear.  The adults accompanying the team are dispatched fairly early by this toothy goblin and the teenagers are left to fend for themselves, alone on a bus in the middle of nowhere. There are the usual characters who want to throw some off the bus--literally, and there are those whose character prevails for the good of everyone. It's a lifeboat in a yellow school bus.The scarecrow seemed to be a take-off of a silent Freddie Krueger by virtue of the fedora, only the make-up was better, and the scarecrow seemed somewhat original. Naturally, it takes a lot to kill this superhuman figure, as we find out that he has a vampire-like quality.The acting and the theme delivered. It would make my list for October viewing.

The film takes places days after the events in the last film, and details the demonic title character as he enters the final day of his feeding frenzy.As was established in the first film, every 23rd spring for 23 days, a creature emerges to feed and naturally its food of choice is humans and it is very particular about what it eats. The scent of fear drives the creature, as it strives to induce fear in potential victims in order to determine its needs before selecting and consuming a victim.The creature has disabled the bus on a remote section of highway in an effort to graze off the inhabitants on its final night of feeding. It accomplishes this in several hit and run raids as it carries off victims only to return at a moment's notice keeping the inhabitants trapped.Mainly unknown actors comprise the cast, as Ray Wise is the only name of note. The cast does a decent job of conveying fear, and upping the hostility as they soon turn on each other over their various petty issues with one another. Sadly, they are not able to provide any tension, as I was expecting to see a bit of ""10 Little Indians"" where the audience has to guess who is going to be killed next. Instead the film unfolds in a fairly predictable manner, and offers few surprises.The tone of the film is different from the last film as it is largely set in a single locale instead of having the creature follow its prey down the highway and appear in different locales. The characters also do not stand around and watch as the creature attacks; they do react and at times attempt to fight the creature as well.While the film is better than the previous one, it is still largely devoid of any scares, and becomes repetitive after a while as one can only watch a band of teens preyed upon for so long before becoming bored. The lack of any chemistry amongst the cast as well as the lack of character development does not allow for the audience to care much for the fate of the cast thus much of the audience is lost.There is some potential in the series as the title character is an interesting villain, with the right cast and script; this could really have been something. I suspect that audiences have not seen the last of the Creeper and let's hope that the third time will be the charm as part two is a step forward from the first, just not enough to allow the film to take off.2.5 stars out of 5Gareth Von Kallenbach[...]",2,Better than the first but still lacking.,1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,2527,"['bus', 'teens', 'returning', 'championship', 'game', 'make', 'deadly', 'unexpected', 'stop', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'film', 'places', 'days', 'events', 'last', 'film', 'details', 'demonic', 'title', 'character', 'final', 'day', 'feeding', 'frenzy.As', 'was', 'established', 'first', 'film', '23rd', 'spring', '23', 'days', 'creature', 'feed', 'naturally', 'food', 'choice', 'humans', 'very', 'particular', 'what', 'scent', 'fear', 'creature', 'induce', 'fear', 'potential', 'victims', 'order', 'determine', 'needs', 'selecting', 'consuming', 'victim.The', 'creature', 'disabled', 'bus', 'remote', 'section', 'highway', 'effort', 'graze', 'off', 'inhabitants', 'final', 'night', 'feeding', 'several', 'hit', 'run', 'raids', 'victims', 'only', 'return', 'moment', 'notice', 'keeping', 'inhabitants', 'trapped.Mainly', 'unknown', 'actors', 'comprise', 'cast', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'only', 'name', 'note', 'cast', 'decent', 'job', 'conveying', 'fear', 'upping', 'hostility', 'soon', 'turn', 'other', 'various', 'petty', 'issues', 'one', 'Sadly', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'provide', 'tension', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'bit', '10', 'Little', 'Indians', 'where', 'audience', 'guess', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'next', 'Instead', 'film', 'unfolds', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'manner', 'few', 'surprises.The', 'tone', 'film', 'different', 'last', 'film', 'largely', 'set', 'single', 'locale', 'instead', 'having', 'creature', 'follow', 'prey', 'down', 'highway', 'appear', 'different', 'locales', 'characters', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'stand', 'watch', 'creature', 'attacks', 'do', 'react', 'times', 'attempt', 'fight', 'creature', 'film', 'better', 'previous', 'one', 'still', 'largely', 'devoid', 'scares', 'becomes', 'repetitive', 'while', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'band', 'teens', 'preyed', 'so', 'long', 'becoming', 'bored', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'allow', 'audience', 'care', 'much', 'fate', 'cast', 'thus', 'much', 'audience', 'potential', 'series', 'title', 'character', 'interesting', 'villain', 'right', 'cast', 'script', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'suspect', 'audiences', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'last', 'Creeper', 'let', 'hope', 'third', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'charm', 'part', 'two', 'step', 'forward', 'first', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'allow', 'film', 'take', 'off.2.5', 'stars', '5Gareth', 'Von', 'Kallenbach', '[', ']']",N/A

780793,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0000E2R6O,Get What We Give,"[3, 5]","Jeepers Creepers, the original, was a return to horror films of the late 1950's and 1960's of Britain: ghoulish and slightly gory with great sets and acting.  Jeepers Creepers, the original, actually scared me.  There was suspense and intrigue and up until the end, there was horror.Jeepers Creepers 2 had an uphill battle to fight from the onset.  Part of the real horror and frights, in the first film, came from not knowing just what the ""Creeper"" was.  That was revealed at the end of the first film, so that aspect of the scares is gone in this second film.  Further, the first film had these really lonely, desolate places for its setting.  The lead characters moved around from locale to locale realizing they were all but alone.  When they come upon civilization, we are treated to the reality that large numbers of people cannot protect you from the Creeper.In part 2, the primary set is a school bus stuck out in the middle of no where.  That should be sufficiently scary, but it isn't.  With the exception of a few real creepy scenes, this film moves on to give us a much more special effects-laden film of the crash and explosion variety - not the horror film variety.The school bus certainly is intended to be akin to the ubiquitous horror film ""house where the kids get stranded"", but it doesn't make any sense.  The kids are trapped in this bus only because the bus has two flat tires....I got news for you, I'd be driving that bus on its rims - damage or no damage.In fact, the director, who is also the screenwriter - and whom, I personally think is very talented - has chosen to use this film as sort of a prurient masturbatory fantasy for pedophiles.  The director/screenwriter was incarcerated some years ago for molesting a 12 year old boy on the set of his film Clownhouse.  It is apparent that his interest in youthful boys is still alive and well.  His cast in this film is primarily pretty boys (a high school basketball team)who peel their shirts off at the least provocation.  There's even a boy who is supposed to be the team towel/water boy, but is constantly berated because supposedly the scar on his face was acquired when he was thrown out of a gay bar.  He is supposed to be in love with one of the basketball players.  The director seems intent upon pushing the idea that young men who are gay have ""scars"" they must carry as they learn their way through life (don't believe me? - the director also wrote/directed Powder).  None of this makes the film bad in and of itself.  It just seems to be T and A of the icky variety that is very misplaced and unnecessary for this film.  I'm not saying we need to see the few girls in this film  topless, but to reverse the roles for no good reason doesn't make any sense either.All that garbage aside, Jeepers Creepers 2 just isn't as scary as the first film.  Horror sequels rarely are.  In fact, I can only think of one: Aliens.The acting in this film is quite fine for the genre.  In fact, it's above average for the genre.  It just seems to be going a bit over the top (or is that an oxymoron when dealing with a monster film?).If you saw the first film, you should surely see this sequel.  Just go into it knowing that it's not as good as the first.",2,"Jeepers!

780794,A2QZX5RPU8BAGK,B0000E2R6O,Greg Hirst,"[3, 9]","I suppose I could start with a little-known fact about the origins of the story. JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 is a lousy to sequel to a substandard movie that in itself was a rip-off of a book that Stephen King wrote in the 80's while snorting cocaine.If that doesn't drive you away, I don't know what will.So many ways to slam this lemon, so little bandwidth.Perhaps the most depressing thing about this movie is Francis Ford Coppola's producing credit. Oh, how the mighty have fallen! But then again, what did you expect? William ""The Princess Bride"" Goldman wrote the sceenplay for DREAMCATCHER (another King story which should have stayed off the screen and between covers).The original film found a brother and sister hunted by a creature that wakes up every 23 years to eat children. In Stephen King's IT, the monster wakes up every 30 years, and I don't care who you are, the leap from 30 to 23 years just doesn't cut it in terms of originality. The brother's name, by the way, was Derry, which was the name of the town in which IT was set.Still no word on whether there is anything special about the 23rd hour of each day, or the 23rd minute of each hour, or the 23rd second of each minute..... God Willing, these questions will not be answered in JEEPERS CREEPERS 3.The character developement in the first film was what kept above complete mediocrity. It then bogged down in cliches, but THIS clunker is right at the bottom of the Pacific ocean, unsalvagable in a sea of genre devices.First off, everyone is really, really stupid. Example: a monster has just ripped a hole in the top of the bus, and then disappeared. Should you approach the hole? How about stick your head out the top of it?Example 2: You have clearly seen that a scarecrow next to you is quite alive Should you approach it? Hell, the second I even got the FEELING that a scarecrow was looking at me, 2.5 seconds later you could find me safely under the covers of my bed.Say you've rigged a harpoon gun to your truck, and have caught that flying sucker on the end of the line. But the beast is so powerful it can actually drag the truck. Fortunatly, the truck gets pulled into the back of a school bus, so it will not move. Do you yell to driver to GET AWAY FROM THE BUS??! I may only be in Physics 1A, but I'm quite sure the answer is a resounding NO!The creature lies incapacitated on the bus. This would be the perfect opportunity to start hitting it, kicking it, squeezing its blackheads, sticking javelines through its head, or at least chewing on its wings. But no, they just stare.... By the way, I don't care who you are, you can't stick a javeline through the roof of a school bus.Just before the poop hits the fan, one character has a premonition. She insists that they were being warned. If you were going to be warned by past victims, shouldn't it happen BEFORE everyone gets on the bus, when it might do some good? After ANOTHER premonition, she awakes and intones ""Every 23 years, for 23 days, it gets to eat....."" ""Eat what?"" A jock, not unreasonably, asks, to which she responds ""What do YOU think?!?""Well sorry, not everyone gets the privilage of useless information from the dead.Once it is established that ""The Creeper"" picks out certain victims, one character says that they should simply ditch those that have been singled out, in order to save the ""will-not-be-eaten"" HELLO! The Creeper isn't stupid! It's not going to say ""Hey! Those kids are all bunched up together! I can't remember which one's I picked. I guess I'll eat them all!"" Then again, I don't subscribe to Better Homes and Creepers.But this is all trivial, considering I don't give a rat's about any one of these poor high school suckers, who in the face of death decide that this is time to question eachother's sexual-orientation. Except for farmer Brown, who looks and acts like a second-rate Billy Bob Thorton.It's better than the abysmal DARKNESS FALLS (I counted 17 cliches after the first viewing, which is all I will subject myself to). But when was the last time a decent horror flick came out? And no, sorry, I didn't like THE RING. There has to be some ideas floating around out there that are better than this fourth-rate JAWS-on-land.Don't even get me started on the laughability (no, seriously, it was funny) and dialogue.BUT.

But this 'un maintains great suspense and excitement all the way through. Victor Salva's direction is kind of like M. Night Shyamalan gone nasty. This sequel is so much more of an in improvement over the original. Plus is has the benefit of being filmed in widescreen which captures the lonely rural landscape wonderfully.Set a few days after the first, The Creeper (truly a great villain) is still out on his feeding frenzy and this time he's set his sights on a bus full of High School Basketball jocks and cheerleaders. The bulk of the movie takes place on their broken down bus and manages to provoke the maximum amount of tension from this situation as possible. Kind of like what Joel Schumacher did with Phone Booth. In an interesting side story, Ray Wise (who I will always remember as being one of the bad guys in Robocop) plays a farmer out for revenge on the creeper with a truckload of homemade weapons. He makes for a great hero and you'll definitely be rooting for him.Also, The Creeper is so much cooler. The opening scene of him disguised as a scarecrow is wicked bad and gone are the ridiculous acrobatic stunts with him jumping over cars and stuff. Instead now the movie focuses on his impressive wingspan and flying skills. He also gets more screen time to show off his sinister personality, which can only be a good thing.Freddy vs Jason deserved to be knocked off the No. 1 spot only by a good movie. And this is it.

What I particularly liked was how the film delved into the history of the Creeper.  It wasn't a great movie, but it was entertaining enough for a Friday night Horror flick fix.I had heard good things about ""Jeeper Creepers 2,"" so I expected a continuation of the same theme. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. With ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" we get nothing more than a ""Friday the 13th"" pick-off-the-teens-one-by-one storyline. Gone is any further information regarding the Creeper. Instead we get a bunch of snotty teen jocks stuck on a bus stranded in the middle of nowhere, each being carried of to someplace we never get to see. Does the Creeper fly them off to a nest to feed a batch of little creepers?  Is it to build another mosaic of bodies? We never know.If you haven't seen the first movie, you'll be wondering what all this talk about feeding every 23 years is about. It's touched on in the first movie, but in JC2, you never find out why the Creeper feeds at these intervals. What's its motivation?  Where did it come from?  Why does it stay in this little town?  Why does it wear those dark clothes? I had lots of questions that the movie ignored. Had the movie delved into any of these questions, it might have been a better film.

I know that because intelligent people, people much smarter then myself liked the first one and like this.  Why?  That's all I want to know.

Well first off school buses and cars will be the exact same, with the exception of a smaller cheerleading squad, without uniforms (don't get excited, I meant regular street cloths) and people's radios wont work.

Silly me.  Turns out ""the creeper"" can throw deadly starts in the day, which don't connect with the tires until evening, or was that a dream?  No she was awake....my the future holds some strange happenings.  Then there is the matter of the creeper himself.  It seems he needs to regenerate every 23 years so he goes about stalking potential ""donors"" for various organs he has worn out,  Thing is he flies.  When he needs new wings, and surely he does since his old ones have been run over, shot, crushed and harpooned.  What does he do?  Does he find someone with wings and eat there wings?  Do people have wings?  Perhaps in the future they do.  In the end we jump another 23 years in to the future, again not much has changed, nothing ever does it seems, not in creeper land.

780805,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000E2R6O,Jeffrey Leach,"[2, 2]","The first ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a ripping good, but not great, horror movie. It told the story of Trish and Darry Jenner, a brother and sister traveling through the Midwest on the way home from college. The two ran into a supernatural creature, a flying demon in fact, who kept an underground crypt stocked with human corpses gathered on previous excursions. This demon sleeps for a number of years before waking for a couple of weeks to wreak havoc on the surrounding countryside. Trish and Darry got on the beastie's bad side, unfortunately, and spent most of the film trying to stay one step ahead of this grotesque monstrosity. The conclusion of the first film proved disastrous for one of the Jenner kids while providing a lesson to those of us stupid enough to investigate underground crypts full of corpses. ""Jeepers Creepers"" was enough of a success at the box office that director Victor Salva signed on to do a sequel a couple of years later. ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" reintroduces us to the icky creature from the first film even as it fulfills an important prerequisite of any horror sequel: upping the body count and punching up the special effects. Gone is the intimacy of the first film.""Jeepers Creepers 2"" takes place just a few days after the nightmare of the first film unfolded. The hunting period of the demon is just about over, so he's out and about trying to claim a few more victims before going nighty night. We come in to see him posing as a scarecrow in the fields of farmer Taggart (Ray Wise). Sadly, Taggart's youngest child falls prey to the Jeeper Creeper right under the gaze of the farmer and his other son. The farmer vows revenge. Meanwhile, a busload of football players and cheerleaders cruises down the road, oblivious to the danger about to swoop out of the sky. When the bus's tire blows, one of the supervising adults discovers a weird, homemade throwing star lodged in the rubber. When another tire blows an hour or so later due to another of these strange stars, it's obvious something downright dangerous is going on. Sure enough, something swift swoops down and whisks the bus driver away. It doesn't take any time at all for all of the adults to perish in excruciating ways, courtesy of the demon, and the kids are left alone to decide the best way to survive. The Jeeper Creeper ratchets up the tension by peering in through a window and pointing to his future victims in a particularly lascivious manner.The kids try to contact the authorities with the bus's radio to no avail. Then they begin arguing amongst themselves about the best way to escape their fate. Differing ideas about what to do escalate racial tensions between black player Deaundre Davis (Garikayi Mutumbirwa) and a bitter white athlete named Scott Braddock (Eric Nenninger). The Creeper takes advantage of the general dissension to tear up the outside of the bus, punch a hole through the ceiling, and tear one of the kids apart. Just when everything seems hopeless, the kids manage to make radio contact with none other than Taggart and his son, who are out patrolling the back roads looking for the Creeper in a pick up truck armed with a giant homemade harpoon gun. The scenes showing Taggart using the gun on the demon are quite frightening, but the weapon ultimately fails to stop the creature from rampaging amongst the fleeing youths. It's worth watching the film just to see a bunch of teenage kids running across a field while a giant winged CGI creature picks them off with the greatest of ease. We could have used one of these Creepers at my high school. The conclusion to the film leaves the door open for a possible sequel even though Salva says he's not interested in making another one.The second installment lacks a lot of the punch of the first one. By focusing on two characters in the original film, Salva made the movie more personal and therefore more frightening. You came to know these two people and even care a bit about them. It is difficult to have the same feelings about a busload of kids. There are just too many characters to get to know intimately, although Salva does his best to highlight different personality traits so we can at least recognize who is perishing at the hands (talons?) of the Creeper and why. What works in the sequel? I thought the heavier use of CGI effects, particularly when showing the Creeper zipping around in the sky, were nicely done and didn't overwhelm the film as so many special effects tend to do today. Too, Salva's cinematography work looks great. I loved the creamy golden tone he added to the film during the opening scenes on the Taggart farm, a tone that gave that part of the movie a dreamy, peaceful quality which contrasted wonderfully to the shattering horror of the Creeper ""scarecrow"" suddenly coming to life. Finally, the claustrophobic confines of the bus, while hardly original in a horror film, did serve to heighten and maintain the tension throughout the movie.Once again, MGM surprises us with a disc full of extras. Maybe they finally got the idea that DVDs should contain more than the movie and a trailer. We get a couple of commentary tracks, MGM promos, deleted scenes, and many documentaries. There are also trailers for ""Jeremiah,"" ""Bulletproof Monk,"" ""Out of Time,"" ""Shredder,"" and both Jeepers Creepers films. Fans of the first film will definitely want to check this one out. I seem to recall that this particular film made a lot of money at the box office, so expect another sequel sometime in the future even if Salva refuses to helm it.",4,More fun than

For one thing, I wasn't impressed by the original and thought it could have been a lot better. But my older sister, whose taste is identical to mine, told me: ""See this one! You'll love it."" I did. And I watched it twice in one sitting. First of all, Director/writer Victor Salva has done a masterful job in shaping this movie into something so much more than the usual squealing teens doing dumb things. The kids are all believable, likeable and the suspense is outstanding. the photography, settings and performances all elevate this sequel to the level of extraordinary. I wish I knew exactly who was who because there were so many characters. The man who played the tragic father who loses his son to the monster was a knockout--as was his older son who helps him track down the monster. The blonde hunk whose kidded about maybe being ""gay"" was also great. One major factor to this film's triumph is the amazing musical score by Bennett Salvay. This is a major score, on the level of Bernard Herman's score for ""Psycho."" It added mightily to the depth and mature dimensions of this movie. For once, the extras were worth watching. I've seen so many DVD's with lousy, making-of documentaries or hideous movie commentaries where someone's talking about something totally different than the movie you're watching. I'm adding this dark, gleaming gem to my permanent collection and Victor Salva and composer Bennett Salvay both deserve nominations for Academy Awards.",5,Wow!

Okay it's not great but a movie should at least get credit for holding your attention when you are watching it. You still want to see who lives and who dies and how the movie will end. When it's over you can say it was bad but you can't deny that it had you entertained or even scared at times.Roger Ebert was right in his review that it doesn't make sense the creature is called the creeper. He doesn't creep up on people, he flys and grabs whoever he wants. However i don't think Ebert saw the first because him being called that in the first one makes more sense. He was called that because of a song Jeepers Creepers that when played it means he is around or something like that. The sequel doesn't have the song in it at all though. Instead the plot is that he sleeps for 23 years and eats for 23 days when he wakse up. I think the Creeper is an interesting new monster of our time.He eats body parts so he can regenerate parts when ever he is hurt in that area. With other killers it doesn't make sense how they still walk like nothing happend after getting hit by a truck or whatever. The Creeper can't be killed because he can simply grow back whatever part gets stabbed or shot. So unlike those other guys why he can't be killed actually makes sense.The silly thing is that snatches people and carries them off and I guess we're suppose to think he is eating them or taking from them what he needs. From the end of the first one it looks like something that takes him awhile to do. Yet in this one he carries them off and is right back basically. It's clear that no one is a match for the creeper, not the kids on the bus or the guy dumb enough to hunt him down. So instead of making a part 3 they should just throw him in there with Freddy and Jason and see who wins.",3,Scarier than the first,1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,1863,"['expected', 'terrible', 'movie', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'heald', 'attention', 'whole', 'time', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'should', 'least', 'get', 'credit', 'holding', 'attention', 'when', 'are', 'watching', 'still', 'want', 'see', 'who', 'who', 'dies', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'When', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'had', 'entertained', 'even', 'scared', 'times.Roger', 'Ebert', 'was', 'right', 'review', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'creature', 'called', 'creeper', ""n't"", 'creep', 'up', 'people', 'flys', 'grabs', 'However', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ebert', 'saw', 'first', 'being', 'called', 'first', 'one', 'more', 'sense', 'was', 'called', 'song', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'when', 'played', 'around', 'something', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'have', 'song', 'Instead', 'plot', '23', 'years', 'eats', '23', 'days', 'when', 'wakse', 'up', 'think', 'Creeper', 'interesting', 'new', 'monster', 'time.He', 'body', 'parts', 'can', 'regenerate', 'parts', 'when', 'ever', 'hurt', 'area', 'other', 'killers', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'how', 'still', 'walk', 'nothing', 'happend', 'getting', 'hit', 'truck', 'Creeper', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'can', 'simply', 'grow', 'back', 'part', 'stabbed', 'shot', 'So', 'other', 'guys', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'actually', 'sense.The', 'silly', 'thing', 'snatches', 'people', 'off', 'guess', ""'re"", 'suppose', 'think', 'eating', 'taking', 'what', 'end', 'first', 'one', 'something', 'awhile', 'do', 'Yet', 'one', 'off', 'right', 'back', 'basically', 'clear', 'one', 'match', 'creeper', 'not', 'kids', 'bus', 'guy', 'enough', 'hunt', 'down', 'So', 'instead', 'making', 'part', '3', 'should', 'just', 'throw', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'see', 'who']",N/A

I don't mean creepy in a good horror movie fashion, I mean creepy like odd and disconcerting. First of all, ""Jeepers Creepers and the sequel"" are ""okay"" horror films I guess, nothing original. But the thing that bothered me when I first saw these two movies is that there is a weird running theme that goes against normal movie convention. In Part 1, Justin Long plays the male protagonist but assumes the role of the ""female victim"". For some reason the creature becomes obsessed with him, starts stalking him and steals and sniffs his laundry. Isn't this what normally happens to the female protagonist in horror films? Unless of course this creature is gay. In Part 2, a bunch of high school football players and cheerleaders get stranded while traveling in a school bus. For some reason, the football players use this opportunity to take off their clothes and sun bathe on top of the bus. Huh?? How many men would do this? Isn't this what female characters normally do in horror films to achieve the obligatory T&A shots? Why aren't the slutty cheerleaders taking their clothes off? It gives a strange, uncomfortable quality to both movies. Later I found out the director was a convicted child molester who molested boys. NOW IT ALL MADE SENSE!!

780810,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B0000E2R6O,Joe Carugati,"[7, 10]","I totally enjoyed &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; when it was released in 2001.  It was a good scare fest, that didn't have to exactly rely on gore or lots of blood.  I thought the atmosphere was very intimidating and left me shaken.  The ending also was a shocker and I was in disbelief for awhile.  It also introduced to a new menace.  The idea of not knowing where are why this thing was here in the country side was scary.  After watching that movie, I thought that was a great and maybe one of my favorite scary movies.In 2003, &quot;Jeepers Creepers II&quot; was released.  I went into it with little expectations surprisingly.  I felt like the first one could not be surpassed and that was true for the most part.  The first one was a straight out horror movie.  The sequel mixes different things together such as more action, some horror, interesting characters, etc.  And believe me, the sequel is still not as great as the first, but it is a great movie.The movie begins with the words, &quot;Every 23rd Spring, for 23 days, it gets to eat&quot;.  Then the words &quot;Day 22&quot; appear on the screen.  We meet the Taggarts: Jack Taggart, Sr. (Ray Wise), Jack Taggart, Jr. (Luke Edwards), and little Billy Taggart (Shaun Flemming).  Billy is putting up scarecrows on their posts, when he senses that one of them is alive.  He flees, but instead the Creeper drags him through the cornfield and flies away.Somewhere a bit far off, there is a busload of basketball players: Scotty Braddock (Eric Nenninger), who is sort of racist and likes to be left alone.  There is the team's ball manager, Bucky (Billy Aaron Brown).  The cheerleaders are there as well, Minxie (Nicki Lynn Aycox) is one that is having premonitions about this man.  Anyway, there are coming home from a State Championship game and their bus becomes disabled.  Then the coaches are dispatched quickly by the Creeper and the teenagers start to freak.  Not only is there a conflict with the Creeper, but inside the bus angers flare, because of race, ideas, opinions, etc.  Then we learn that the Creeper has chosen people that it wants to eat.  Pretty soon, the body count starts to rise, but maybe the Creeper can be stopped, because it will go into hibernation...  and now Jack Taggart is seeking revenge and wants to put an end to the beast.Plot - The idea of the movie is pretty cool, but the original's beats it.  The idea of teenagers being stuck in a certain place and chased by a creature is a usual idea among horror movies today.  Surprisingly though, I thought they made this plot believable.  We know learn what the Creeper can do (fly, hurl throwing stars, etc).  He is a bit more fleshed out and makes you wanting more and more of the Creeper to appear on the screen.  I also like the side story of the farmer and his oldest son hunting down the Creeper.  It was a cool idea of a revenge plot too.  PLOT - 92Acting - The acting was pretty good for the most part.  Eric Nenninger was good as Scotty.  He gave his character snotty and mean characteristics.  He's one of those guys you love to hate.  Nicki Lynn Aycox did an okay job as Minxie.  She wasn't really fleshed out though.  I feel like I wanted to know more about her.  Billy Aaron Brown does a great job as the scared, but determined Bucky.  The rest of the people on the bus aren't fleshed out that well and halfway into the movie, most of them disappear.  I didn't get it.  The two that stand out though are Ray Wise and the Creeper himself.  Ray Wise doesn't say much, but you know what he is thinking by his actions.  Jonathan Breck is great as the Creeper.  He makes him terrifying in his own way and seems to love playing him.  Breck really becomes the character.  ACTING - 85Special FX/Gore - The special effects in this movie are nearly perfect.  The Creeper looks great when he is flying around and it looks realistic for the most part.  There isn't that much gore in this movie, which is a good thing.  It still mostly relied on atmosphere and entrapment inside the bus.  People do get killed though and sometimes violently.  At other times, people will be swooped away and you can only imagine the worst for them.  I don't think a lot of blood was needed for this movie anyway.  It made up for it with great FX and atmosphere instead.  Special FX - 97 / Gore - 92Pacing - The movie is very fast paced.  I actually think it was &quot;too&quot; fast paced.  There isn't that much time for character development.  Director Victor Salva made a sequel that people would want to see: fast paced, energetic, exciting, and interesting.  He hits the mark here, because it is all of the above and many people will be jolted and nervous while watching this film.  Pacing - 90Overall - 91.5/B+  It's a good sequel that deserves credit.  I never thought a sequel to a great horror movie could be this good.  So, if you are looking for a good, creepy, fun time, take a chance with this film.G.

Milas,"[0, 1]","Victor Salva continues his series of Creeper flicks paying homage to the 70's slasher/horror movies with this little extraveganza featuring a bus-full of teenagers.  When I mean Salva is nodding at 70's slashers by using a bus-load of teens I mean it.  We get every stereotype possible, but it's all good fun and the gore is taken up a notch, so there's still not that much, but that's not a bad thing.  Salva focused more on suspense and the creepyness in the first movie, but in Jeepers Creepers 2 he goes more for a comedy/action element that's a great idea to bring fresh material to a sequel.  As I said there's a bunch of teens runnin' 'round so the body count is a lot higher and of course the language is a little coarser, so expect that.  As with the first ""Special Edition"" DVD this one's got a heapin' helpin of extras that surprises me alot, yet I'm very happy that they're included.

If I have to hold on to that metaphor, then this must be the equivalent of the Titanic.About fifteen minutes into the film, when there were dozens of ""teenage"" males running around without their shirt on (some for absolutely no apparent reason whatsoever), I came to [...] to see if David De Coteau was involved in this. Given that the production values were fairly decent, I was certain that he wouldn't be. For the uninitiated (count yourself lucky) De Coteau makes horror films that barely scratch the bottom of the ""B"" category in filmmaking, as every film that I've ever seen of his involves preposterously underdressed young men with equally preposterously builds doing ""something"" - even if it makes no sense whatsoever.No, De Coteau wasn't involved with this, and I couldn't find any other ties between his movies and Victor Salva's (I didn't look too hard), but it still struck as being odd given that the majority of horror films that make it to the big screen involve lusty, young large bosomed girls having their shirts come off for no apparent reason.What puzzled me was that this wasn't present in Jeepers Creepers. Anyway, enough of that.In Jeepers Creepers there was a standout performance - Justin Long - that gave the movie an ounce of credibility. There was no such performance here, although cult fans of the TV series Popular would be interested to know that chemistry teacher Bobbi Glass was the bus driver.So, the bus. The bus gets a flat on the highway because ""it"" (whatever it is - some kind of morphed locus?) pierces the tire with startling accuracy with what resembles Chinese star - except it's made of bones. They find two such things. One has a tooth in the middle, the other a bellybutton. Eek.The movie is reduced to the kids who want to stay on the bus and the kids who don't. This is where any logic that may have existed falls apart. There's this giant winged creature, capable of ripping open the top of a bus (and car) and snatching people out like we would with a can of sardines. The bus doesn't sound too safe. It isn't. Neither is the open road...but there are people who think being out of the bus is better than being in the bus, and the kids actually have arguments about this that are supposed to be logical.There are a few good cheap thrills, and the ending is more sad than anything else, but aside from that there's nothing to set this apart from any horror movie I've ever seen.",1,I hope they don't make a third...for everyone's sake,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,2746,"['Having', 'watched', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'having', 'been', 'least', 'mildly', 'entertained', 'nothing', 'other', 'Justin', 'Long', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'i.e', 'when', 'acted', 'scared', 'really', 'did', 'appear', 'be', 'genuinely', 'scared', 'thought', 'would', 'catch', 'was', 'free', 'TV.I', 'said', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'was', 'train', 'wreck', 'have', 'hold', 'metaphor', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'equivalent', 'Titanic.About', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'were', 'dozens', 'teenage', 'males', 'running', 'around', 'shirt', 'absolutely', 'apparent', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'came', '[', ']', 'see', 'David', 'De', 'Coteau', 'was', 'involved', 'Given', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'fairly', 'decent', 'was', 'certain', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'uninitiated', 'count', 'lucky', 'De', 'Coteau', 'horror', 'films', 'barely', 'scratch', 'bottom', 'B', 'category', 'filmmaking', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'involves', 'preposterously', 'underdressed', 'young', 'men', 'equally', 'preposterously', 'doing', 'something', 'even', 'sense', 'whatsoever.No', 'De', 'Coteau', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'ties', 'movies', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'hard', 'still', 'struck', 'being', 'odd', 'given', 'majority', 'horror', 'films', 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'involve', 'lusty', 'young', 'large', 'bosomed', 'girls', 'having', 'shirts', 'come', 'off', 'apparent', 'reason.What', 'puzzled', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'Anyway', 'enough', 'that.In', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'was', 'standout', 'performance', 'Justin', 'Long', 'gave', 'movie', 'ounce', 'credibility', 'was', 'such', 'performance', 'here', 'cult', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'Popular', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'Bobbi', 'Glass', 'was', 'bus', 'driver.So', 'bus', 'bus', 'flat', 'highway', 'kind', 'morphed', 'locus', 'tire', 'startling', 'accuracy', 'what', 'Chinese', 'star', 'made', 'bones', 'find', 'two', 'such', 'things', 'One', 'tooth', 'middle', 'other', 'bellybutton', 'Eek.The', 'movie', 'reduced', 'kids', 'who', 'want', 'stay', 'bus', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'where', 'logic', 'may', 'have', 'existed', 'falls', 'apart', 'giant', 'winged', 'creature', 'capable', 'ripping', 'open', 'top', 'bus', 'car', 'snatching', 'people', 'would', 'can', 'sardines', 'bus', ""n't"", 'sound', 'too', 'safe', ""n't"", 'open', 'road', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'being', 'bus', 'better', 'being', 'bus', 'kids', 'actually', 'have', 'arguments', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'ending', 'more', 'sad', 'anything', 'else', 'aside', 'nothing', 'set', 'apart', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

Bernabo,"[0, 2]","What now gets to be referred to as the original &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; had one of the best first half-hours I have ever seen in a horror film.  It was not until I found out what the Creeper was supposed to be that I find myself requesting a respite from sexual intercourse.  I thought the film was working just fine without the whole winged demon from whatever hell bit, and the rest of the film was all down hill.  The film did well enough to warrant a sequel (how many horror films even manage great openings?) and writer director Victor Salva is back to continue the tale.The movie begins with the basic &quot;rules,&quot; by informing us that every 23 years, for 23 days, it gets to eat.  We then find out that we are up to day 22 where the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) snatches his next victim and kicks off the major subplot of the film, which is the quest of farmer Jack Tagger (Ray Wise) to get the thing that took his boy.  We then jump ahead to day 23, at which point we are introduced to a bus full of teenagers and I start counting all the things that bug me about this film.  Ready?(1) The bus has a high school basketball team that has just won the state championship, so where is the trophy?  I was expecting it to be used as a weapon at some point.  Plus, have you ever seen a less unhappy championship team once the signing stops?  (2) The team only has three cheerleaders, although all the cheerleaders at my high school had pom-pons.  (3) This is a team that has just won state and yet none of the parents are caravaning with the team.  Yeah, right.  (4) I understand the bus is on a back road that nobody takes anymore because of the interstate, but I still would like to know the odds that the only car that passes them the entire time they are stuck comes along the first minute.  (5) The equipment manager really left equipment on the bus after the track meet?  Bad equipment manager.  (6) I think having a cheerleader have a vision that provides exposition for the Creeper was awfully convenient.  This was almost as bad as the original version of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; when Faye Dunaway just picks Steve McQueen's photo out of a pile and announces he is the guy.  (7) The same thing applies to the idea that the only times the radio on the bus works is when we get to hear updates on what the Creeper has been doing and when the sub-plot shows up to join the main plot.  (8) In terms of the exposition, what is this nonsense about the Creeper making menu selections?  I find it hard to believe it only kills for food, especially after the first film.  (9) Oh, and if the Creeper is jumping around the county in its feeding frenzy, flying around in broad day light, how come the cops are not criss crossing the area like crazy?  (10) Once the cops find the Creeper's lair and 300 bodies sewed together, would that not up the ante on the situation and triple the number of cops brought into the county?  (11) Without even taking into account the aerodynamics of this thing's wings, how comes the Creeper flies slower when chasing kids in a pick up truck than when it is normally swooping down on its prey?  (12) Who cares if something cannot die if you can slice and dice it?  (13) If the Creeper is supposed to return to the ground ever 23 years, what happens if it does not?Okay, I will stop now.  My explanation for most of the above consists of me holding up my hands and wiggling my fingers, but not my thumbs.  The idea is that I am miming typing and it means that the above things happened because somebody wrote them that way.  The main goal is to have the Creeper terrorize a bus load of teenagers on a lonely stretch of rural highway and that is exactly what we get in this film.  If logic gets in the way of the proceedings, defy logic and keep on filming.  Remember the episode of &quot;South Park&quot; where the kids were stuck on a school bus?  Now that's what I call getting out of a sticky situation.There are some things I like about the film, such as the opening scenes were we are dealing with terror in bright sunlight, a fairly different idea), and the Creeper running through the corn field stalking the bus.  What happens when the sub-plot catches up with the main plot certainly results in some innovative stunts, including a creative war for cutting a bus in half.  A lot of it reminded me of &quot;Jaws&quot; and I was actually thinking Ray Wise was going to comment about the taxidermy man have a heart attack when he sees what our heroic farmer is bringing in (which would have been rather apropos given the final scene of the film).  But even at that point I am still number counting off things that do not make sense.(14) Are pick up trucks really made that well that you can still drive them after taking a beating like that?  (15) Did we ever see the Creeper actually creep in either of these films?Okay, I will stop now.",3,A disappointing sequel that creeps in the wrong direction,1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,4893,"['What', 'now', 'be', 'referred', 'original', 'quot', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'quot', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'first', 'half-hours', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'Creeper', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'find', 'requesting', 'respite', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'working', 'just', 'fine', 'whole', 'winged', 'demon', 'hell', 'bit', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'down', 'hill', 'film', 'did', 'well', 'enough', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'how', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'even', 'manage', 'great', 'openings', 'director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'back', 'continue', 'tale.The', 'movie', 'basic', 'quot', 'rules', 'quot', 'informing', '23', 'years', '23', 'days', 'eat', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'up', 'day', '22', 'where', 'Creeper', 'Jonathan', 'Breck', 'next', 'victim', 'kicks', 'off', 'major', 'subplot', 'film', 'quest', 'farmer', 'Jack', 'Tagger', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'get', 'thing', 'took', 'boy', 'then', 'jump', 'ahead', 'day', '23', 'point', 'are', 'introduced', 'bus', 'full', 'teenagers', 'start', 'counting', 'things', 'bug', 'film', 'Ready', '1', 'bus', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'team', 'just', 'won', 'state', 'championship', 'where', 'trophy', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'used', 'weapon', 'point', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'less', 'unhappy', 'championship', 'team', 'once', 'signing', 'stops', '2', 'team', 'only', 'three', 'cheerleaders', 'cheerleaders', 'high', 'school', 'had', 'pom-pons', '3', 'team', 'just', 'won', 'state', 'yet', 'none', 'parents', 'are', 'caravaning', 'team', 'Yeah', 'right', '4', 'understand', 'bus', 'back', 'road', 'nobody', 'anymore', 'interstate', 'still', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'odds', 'only', 'car', 'entire', 'time', 'are', 'stuck', 'first', 'minute', '5', 'equipment', 'manager', 'really', 'left', 'equipment', 'bus', 'track', 'meet', 'Bad', 'equipment', 'manager', '6', 'think', 'having', 'cheerleader', 'have', 'vision', 'exposition', 'Creeper', 'was', 'awfully', 'convenient', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'original', 'version', 'quot', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'quot', 'when', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'just', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'photo', 'pile', 'announces', 'guy', '7', 'same', 'thing', 'applies', 'idea', 'only', 'radio', 'bus', 'when', 'get', 'hear', 'updates', 'what', 'Creeper', 'been', 'doing', 'when', 'sub-plot', 'up', 'join', 'main', 'plot', '8', 'terms', 'exposition', 'what', 'nonsense', 'Creeper', 'making', 'menu', 'selections', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'only', 'food', 'especially', 'first', 'film', '9', 'Oh', 'Creeper', 'jumping', 'county', 'feeding', 'frenzy', 'flying', 'around', 'broad', 'day', 'light', 'how', 'come', 'cops', 'are', 'not', 'criss', 'crossing', 'area', 'crazy', '10', 'Once', 'cops', 'find', 'Creeper', 'lair', '300', 'bodies', 'sewed', 'together', 'would', 'not', 'ante', 'situation', 'triple', 'number', 'cops', 'brought', 'county', '11', 'even', 'taking', 'account', 'aerodynamics', 'thing', 'wings', 'how', 'Creeper', 'flies', 'slower', 'when', 'chasing', 'kids', 'pick', 'up', 'truck', 'when', 'normally', 'swooping', 'down', 'prey', '12', 'Who', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'can', 'slice', 'dice', '13', 'Creeper', 'supposed', 'return', 'ground', 'ever', '23', 'years', 'what', 'not', 'Okay', 'will', 'stop', 'now', 'explanation', 'most', 'above', 'holding', 'up', 'hands', 'wiggling', 'fingers', 'not', 'thumbs', 'idea', 'am', 'miming', 'typing', 'above', 'things', 'happened', 'somebody', 'wrote', 'way', 'main', 'goal', 'have', 'Creeper', 'terrorize', 'bus', 'load', 'teenagers', 'lonely', 'stretch', 'rural', 'highway', 'exactly', 'what', 'get', 'film', 'logic', 'way', 'proceedings', 'defy', 'logic', 'keep', 'filming', 'Remember', 'episode', 'quot', 'South', 'Park', 'quot', 'where', 'kids', 'were', 'stuck', 'school', 'bus', 'Now', 'what', 'call', 'getting', 'sticky', 'are', 'things', 'like', 'film', 'such', 'opening', 'scenes', 'were', 'are', 'dealing', 'terror', 'bright', 'sunlight', 'fairly', 'different', 'idea', 'Creeper', 'running', 'corn', 'field', 'stalking', 'bus', 'What', 'when', 'sub-plot', 'up', 'main', 'plot', 'certainly', 'results', 'innovative', 'stunts', 'including', 'creative', 'war', 'cutting', 'bus', 'half', 'lot', 'reminded', 'quot', 'Jaws', 'quot', 'was', 'actually', 'thinking', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'was', 'going', 'comment', 'taxidermy', 'man', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'when', 'what', 'heroic', 'farmer', 'bringing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'apropos', 'given', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'even', 'point', 'am', 'still', 'number', 'counting', 'off', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', '14', 'Are', 'pick', 'up', 'trucks', 'really', 'made', 'well', 'can', 'still', 'drive', 'taking', 'beating', '15', 'Did', 'ever', 'see', 'Creeper', 'actually', 'films', 'Okay', 'will', 'stop', 'now']",N/A
780834,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B0000E2R6O,Libretio,"[2, 2]","JEEPERS CREEPERS II(USA - 2002)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTSStranded on a country road in a broken-down bus, a group of high school jocks and cheerleaders are targeted by the monstrous Creeper (Jonathan Breck) who needs their body parts for the purposes of regeneration. But the Creeper hasn't reckoned on the tenacity of one of its earlier victims (Ray Wise), a grieving father seeking revenge for the loss of his youngest son...Though crafted with technical precision and performed with gusto by a strong cast of newcomers and veterans, this disappointing sequel sacrifices the heartfelt emotional undertow of its magnificent predecessor JEEPERS CREEPERS (2000) in favor of bigger and splashier set-pieces. While it's as raucous and entertaining as one could hope for, it's also a surprisingly conventional effort from writer-director Victor Salva, whose best work (POWDER, RITES OF PASSAGE, etc.) has always focused on small groups of characters caught up in extreme situations. Here, his attempts to shoehorn deeper issues into what is essentially a popcorn movie seems forced and inconsequential, and he spreads his narrative concerns too thinly over a broad range of interchangeable characters: The elements of homophobia and racism which initially divide the young heroes - until they're forced to overcome their differences in order to survive the Creeper's onslaught - are rendered increasingly meaningless as the movie progresses, until they no longer have any direct influence on the wider storyline.But Salva is too much of a craftsman for his movie to be a complete washout. The action/horror set-pieces are genuinely spectacular, and Breck camps it up superbly as the hideous Creeper, swooping out of the darkness to carry unsuspecting victims to their doom. Working in scope format for the first time in their respective careers (REAL scope, not that Super 35 rubbish), Salva and cinematographer Don E. FauntLeRoy conjure a series of startling images from the outset, many of them tinged with visual poetry: The golden cornfield in the opening sequence, where the film's first victim suffers an appalling fate (a genuinely horrific set-piece); the point-of-view shots from the Creeper's perspective as it swoops on fleeing prey; and the eerie calm of the closing sequence, which portends sequels to come. Salva's regular composer, Bennett Salvay, delivers a terrific symphonic score, as brassy and frightening as any in recent years, which serves to boost the film's dramatic appeal in no uncertain terms.Wise, a late addition to the cast, dominates the film as an avenging farmer who is every bit the Creeper's equal in terms of strength and persistence, and he's given strong support by veterans Diane Delano and Thom Gossom Jr. The younger cast members are enthusiastic and talented, and it's a fair bet that some of them (Travis Schiffner, Al Santos, Nicki Aycox, etc.) will figure heavily in various Hunkiest/Sexiest lists during the next few years. Look out for a brief - but welcome - cameo appearance by Justin Long from JC1.

780839,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0000E2R6O,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 0]","I was intrigued by the concept of the original ""Jeepers Creepers"" movie. The idea of a new creature with a hitherto unknown mythology and unknown motivations preying on the emotions of select people seemed like a novel idea to me. I enjoyed the movie until the ending, which I thought was a little weak. However, I enjoyed the first movie to give the second movie a try.This movie begins right where the previous movie ends. The creature appears once every twenty-three years, and it eats, which means it kills, for twenty-three days. At the beginning of this movie we learn we are in the twenty third day.Early in this movie we see a father and two sons working on a farm. The youngest son is arranging scarecrows in a cornfield when he notices something strange about one of the scarecrows. Fans of horror movies will immediately recall one of the commandments of horror films: stay away from scarecrows. Apparently young Billy Taggart (Shaun Fleming) is unaware of the limitations provided for residents of horror films, because he approaches the scarecrow. Young Billy's screams bring his father, Jack Taggart, Sr. (Ray Wise), and brother Jack Taggart, Jr. (Luke Edwards), running. However, while they are in time to see a dark figure carrying poor Billy away, they are helpless. We will next see Jack Taggart, Sr., doing mysterious things that will become clear as the movie unfolds.We next move on to a busload of high school football players and three cheerleaders. I was amused at another reviewer who marveled that there were only three cheerleaders. Apparently this reviewer has not been in a very small town where there may only be three cheerleaders. Frequently these towns can barely muster a football team. Anyway, one of the tires on the bus goes flat, which we learn is due to an interesting weapon with claws and a human tooth for a decoration. Clearly something strange is happening. When the bus driver attempts to radio for help and the students attempt to phone home they learn that they are unable to do so for reasons never explained. Finally, the bus driver begins to move slowly down the highway with one flat tire.Things seem to go fine for a while until a second icky looking weapon flattens a second tire. The second weapon is sporting what appears to be a human belly button. Veteran horror film fans are well aware that once the bus is completely disabled the mayhem is about to begin. Soon people, beginning with the bus driver and the coach, begin to disappear. They disappear to disconcertingly fast that you wonder whether you can believe your own eyes. However, the creature that made them disappear is not shy and soon makes an encore appearance. However, these students are willing to fight back, and the creature finds that snacking on these students will be a bit more of a challenge than usual. In one of the best and hopeful scenes one of the students spears the creature, disabling it, if only temporarily.There is a bit of tedium as the students bicker amongst themselves, and I began to vote with the students as to whether any of them should be so foolish as to stand between the creature and its chosen victims. After all, would you stand between a ravenous shark and its prey, or hope it does not see you? The students not identified by the creature as prey (which happens soon after the bus is disabled) try to avoid the creature as much as possible.Things are looking bleak as the creature refuses to be injured by students for long, and keeps picking them off one-by-one. Fortunately for the students the cavalry arrives in the form of Jack Taggart, Jr. and Sr., with a completely unique weapon. Viewers will discover that the unique weapon fits the shark analogy well. The battle rages between the Taggarts and the creature for a heart-stopping length of time, with viewers wondering at the outcome until the screen fades to black.The final scene of this movie was chilling and left questions that may be answered by another sequel.This movie is hardly ground-breaking. However, I enjoyed it and managed to suffer through the tedious portion where we were briefly introduced to the future victims of the creature to get to the ""Old Man and the Sea"" battle between the Taggarts and the creature. This movie does use a number of elements from other movies, but the creature seemed quite unique compared to other monsters I know. After watching hundreds of horror movies it is hard to be frightened or surprised. This movie contained a few surprises for me, so from that viewpoint it was good. This movie was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film, so this movie impressed someone in the industry. While jaded viewers may consider this movie lightweight, I will still recommend this movie as being worth watching at least once, and some fans may find this one valuable for their film

780841,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B0000E2R6O,Martin Asiner,"[0, 0]","JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 continues the same successful route that its predecessor followed, the differences being mostly a higher body count, more specialized special effects, and some truly slam-bang action sequences.  In the original, the Creeper kills and eats his victims, but in this one, he seems content to swoop down on a selected victim and yank him straight up.The plot, of course, is straight out of Urban Film Mythology I.  A creature appears once every generation to seek new victims for a restricted time, only to have to disappear for another generation when he finishes.  Director Victor Salva takes this basic thrust and imparts some truly impressive energy into a moribund genre that has trod this road before, usually with much less success.  In JC2, a bus load of high school jocks and cheerleaders are picked off one by one by the winged Creeper (Jonathan Breck).  Once one gets beyond the frenetic pace set by director Salva, JC2 develops into a series of consecutive set pieces involving differing kids.  The problem with audience identification here is the same as in any other slasher film.  The kids are cardboard cutups whose only purpose is to stand for clearly recognizable types.  There is the gay-bashing jock, the shuckin and jiving inner city black, the clairvoyant female, the pom pom cheerleader, and the wise elder who carries a portable harpoon on his truck.  Still, one really does not expect some well-defined round characters in a fright film although I would like to think that in any life and death situation in a collective us versus a creature scenario, I would expect far more co-operation.  The ending suggests that a JC3 is now in the books, and if so, I would appreciate some needed background on the Creeper.  What is it?  What is its origin?  And how can it fly when its body is so definitely not aerodynamically designed?

780843,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0000E2R6O,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 1]","The thing about the original film, was that for days afterwards, I was constantly going around singing (badly) and humming ""jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers?"" And it was only that line that was noticable during the original. Needless to say, it got on my nerves, not to mention everyone elses' nerves quite quickly. That is missing from this film, and it should have been kept in.The Creeper is shown a lot more in this film, and it makes it all the more scarier. The opening shot (of the Creeper disguised as a scarecrow) is sadly ruined, due to being shown in the trailer - which I saw quite a while before I watched this! With all the action being set on a broken-down school bus, with a bunch of kids, it adds a very claustrophobic feel to the film. There's a few jumpy moments, especially when Justin Long reappears as his character from the original, complete with blood & whatnot. Instantly, it made me think that the lovely long haired Gina Philips featured in the sequel, but sadly she did not, and I probably greatly annoyed my boyfriend, by asking if a similar looking girl was her. :)There's a few more deaths in this film, but I also thought that it was missing the brilliant shots of the underground cave/basement thing from the first, where all the bodies were kept, and it's disappointing that this wasn't in it, as my jaw quite literally dropped!What's confusing about this film, is that it's set only a few days after the original. The original is still on the news, and is still on everyone's minds. How? Victor Salva wrote the whole ""Every 23 years for 23 days it gets to eat"" rule in the first movie so there would be no sequel unless the movie was set in the future, and knew the studio wouldn't want that. However Francis Ford Coppola found an easy loophole in the rule for the sequel: set it during the same 23 days as the first movie. So this film is set on the 23rd day for the purpose of not making another sequel.I think the first film worked better, with only two main characters, played by Justin Long & Gina Philips. In this one, you have a school class, who look all too similar, and it was difficult for me to see the difference between them, or remember their names. Half the class do run off at some point, and get conveniently forgot about, whether intentional or not. The dream sequences that the lead girl has, don't make any sense whatsoever, but I suppose they're in there, so you can see brief bits of the original, and get a bit more of the wee boy in, who featured at the start.I'm quite surprised quite a few people, including my boyfriend, preferred this one to the first one. I didn't see it as much, I liked both equally, although slightly preferring the first, due to being focused on the two characters.

This is why with the psychological horror/unseen mosnters genre, the imagination is soley responsible for sketching that monster..far more effective and terrifying.So while Jeepers Creepers is not bad per se,it is still an average film,the type of which you will forget about as soon as the credits roll(as opposed for instance to The Others,the ending of which stayed with me for weeks after watching it!).I have a feeling that we will not wait another 23 years to witness the Creepers comeback! and I fear it will become a franchise spawning many sequels,but for the time being the two Jeepers Creepers films are worth renting or watching on cable later(and not buying) if you want some old fashioned but average horror films.",3,Good Effort,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,2105,"['am', 'not', 'usually', 'too', 'keen', 'horror', 'film', 'sequels', 'especially', 'gory', 'type.More', 'inclined', 'towards', 'more', 'original', 'intelligent', 'psychological', 'horror', 'genre', 'Others', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Exorcist', 'pea', 'soup', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'like', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'all.But', 'suprisingly', 'fast', 'forward', 'remained', 'untouched', 'film', 'being', 'impressed', 'solid', 'direction', 'excellent', 'editing', 'decent', 'stunts.In', 'addition', 'liked', 'script', 'original', 'Creepers', 'writer/director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'way', 'was', 'well', 'contained', 'also', 'appreciated', 'cheeky', 'humour', 'Creeper', 'facial', 'expressions', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'choosing', 'next', ""'meal"", '..I', 'also', 'liked', 'ending..the', 'elements', 'obsession', 'revenge', 'constant', 'grief', 'not', 'much', 'explored', 'added', 'certain', 'acting', 'mostly', 'newcomers', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'excellent', 'underrated', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'giving', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'invaluable', 'boost', 'did', 'terrific', 'job.So', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'three', 'marks', 'only', 'Well', 'starters', 'Freddy', 'Michael', 'Jason', 'Leatherface', 'Pinhead', 'Candyman', 'monster', 'horror', 'genre', 'stretched', 'style', 'become', 'very', 'much', 'predictable', 'Moreover', 'problem', 'such', 'films', 'monster', 'itself.No', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'makeup', 'digital', 'makeover', 'personally', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'actor', 'wearing', 'mask', 'why', 'psychological', 'horror/unseen', 'mosnters', 'genre', 'imagination', 'soley', 'responsible', 'sketching', 'more', 'effective', 'terrifying.So', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'not', 'bad', 'se', 'still', 'average', 'film', 'type', 'will', 'forget', 'as', 'soon', 'credits', 'roll', 'opposed', 'instance', 'Others', 'ending', 'stayed', 'weeks', 'watching', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'not', 'wait', '23', 'years', 'witness', 'Creepers', 'comeback', 'fear', 'will', 'become', 'franchise', 'spawning', 'many', 'sequels', 'time', 'being', 'two', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'films', 'are', 'worth', 'renting', 'watching', 'cable', 'later', 'not', 'buying', 'want', 'old', 'fashioned', 'average', 'horror', 'films']",N/A

Jeepers Creepers 2 also has quite a few loose ends (setting up for another sequel), and the Creeper isn't as scary as he was in the original film (I had thought that this guy would be the next horror icon like Freddy Kruger or Michael Myers).

Well I finally saw it and I have to say it's better than the origional but not by much....We start out with an opening that is just eerie in itself, a boy putting up black scare-crows in a huge corn field. Turns out one of the scare-crows is the Creeper. It takes the boy, leaving behind a father and another son. Then we meet up with a bus full of football players and cheerleaders heading home from a big game. Fights echo from one end of the bus, rebound and strike the other end. None of it is really of any importance. Then the bus gets a flat tire and a home made throwing knife type thing is found and the bus is stranded and the adults are picked off first and we are left with a bus full over over acting teens and under acting teens and just falt out suck acting teens who want to stay on teh bus and think it's safe. Well people are getting killed and again more fights break out, verbal ones of course. And the people on the bus escape and go running through a corn field. What happens to them?? I dont know, does anyone? There are about 15 people running and at the end we only see 5 survivors...and only 2 or 3 of the 10 we actually see being killed. So this leaves open space for questions of what happened to the rest of the cast.

I watched this movie three times and each time it was still entertaining. This movie can be watched almost entirely on its own (even though it's a sequel), with very little ties to the first one.This movie is unique to me because it has some funny moments and exchanges amongst the students. It was done deliberately so the movie doesn't sink into too serious of a tone. When I watch the villain in this movie, it reminded me a little of Freddy Krueger. There are some of Freddy's DNA in this film throughout, I thought. Of course, the difference is this villain doesn't talk.I thought the acting of all the actors and actresses were great (a rarity for a B-like movie). I like how the writers and the director spent time portraying the main student characters reacted to the sudden morbid situation and how the team divided under the harrowing condition. There was one line in the movie that was my favorite: &#34;There were actually two villains in this movie, one was the Alpha male of the student player name 'Scotty'. In the beginning of the movie, you will see he was the only one not happy after their team won the state championship, later on you will know why he was upset, and still later, you will see his character show when everyone's life was in danger.The ending also was great.

It was much more suspenseful and action-paced then the first one and it had a decent subplot to go along with it.This sequel takes place just days after the original.  The creeper is still on the loose and this time it's set it's sights on a High School basketball team coming back from state.  When the tires blow, thanks to the Creeper, they are stranded on a secluded highway in the middle of nowhere.  The perfect setting for a horror film.  The three adults are picked off one-by-one while the hysterical teens try to figure out what just happened.  The movie continues with the teens being stalked by the Creeper while a man and his teenage son try to track down the Creeper who earlier took the man's youngest son from a corn field.It is suspenseful, but not really scary.  It has pretty good acting from a cast of mostly unknowns, but the characters are pretty thin.  While I like the fact that I could identify the students on the bus, as opposed to a nameless bunch of kids who would eventually die, it would have been nicer to have had more depth there.  Finally the ending is a 100% improvement over the ending of part one.

That's about it, save for a sub-plot about a farmer out for revenge, who eventully arrives to semi-save the day.The cast are totally forgettable, with the marked exception of Nicki Lynn Aycox  as Minxie Hayes, a starlet, who, if her clever and emotional performance here are anything to go by, is a starlet destined for greater things. Where this film succeeds is in blending OTT Shocks with a hefty dash of comedy, but taking itself seriosuly enough so as to avoid a 'Scream'-like feel.The Creeper, by now a fully-fledged demon, looks something like a charred and sweaty Freddy Kruegger with Wings. His special effects, thankfully, are far better in this movie than in the prequel, and the creature comes off as visually credible. Setting this movie almost-entirely aboard a bus may have seemed like a risky venture, but director Salva proves his talent in this regard by not allowing the storyline to plod or become boring. The imagery, although sometimes crude (the Demon's knives look less like supernatural weapons and more like tourist purchases), works well, particularly in Minxie's dream sequences. A nice touch is the reintroduction of Justin Long as Darry Jenner (from the first movie) and the contrast between these dream sequences and the dark nighttime scenes that take up the vast majority of the film.There are one or two cameo references to the prequel like Darry Jenner's appearance, and a radio story about the Creeper's 'Church of Pain', finally discovered by humans - and the whole movie moves at a decent pace. It's not boring, and the shocks, though standard, are indeed shocking.

That said, he has a very good reason to show the monster too much; he's going to play with it. And he does a fantastic job of playing with it.Aside from showing us sides (and heads) of the Creeper we've never seen before, there's a weird, disturbing underside to this movie that has nothing to do with the flick itself. I won't rehash the long and tragic tale of Victor Salva again; check your email when his next flick comes out (Peaceful Warrior, slated for release in 2006 as of this writing) if you're not up on the details, as activist groups love to give Victor Salva [...]. Now, here's the fun part: Jeepers Creepers 2 has a very ""Victor Salva trying to work out his demons"" feel to it that all of his other films touch on, but none explore is this sort of detail. The number of buff, shirtless young men in this picture approaches the level of ludicrous, and the camera certainly loves to linger on them. That's probably going to creep the audience out even if it's not aware of Victor Salva's demons. Add in a millenia-old monster that can't be killed, and has all sorts of nifty properties you don't know anything about yet, and you've got yourself one creepy flick here.The plot is simple. The Creeper (whom you all remember from the first film) comes out every twenty-three years to feed. It's getting towards hibernation time, and the Creeper has to stock up for the next twenty-three years. He starts off by masquerading as a scarecrow in order to abduct a farm boy, whose father (Ray Wise of Twin Peaks fame) vows revenge on the beast. He then heads off to find and devour the inhabitants of a school bus. The bulk of the film focuses on said inhabitants of said bus trying to survive the night, until the Creeper heads back to hibernation.Now, this is a (relatively) low-budget horror flick, so you know you're not going to be getting any big-name actors; Ray Wise is as big as it gets. Wise, however, has always been one of Hollywood's underrated, and he gives his best performance here since Twin Peaks. Nicki Aycox, recently of Slap Her, She's French, looks as if she's going to give a really good performance, then her character suddenly becomes an extra about halfway through the movie. Everyone else is cookie-cutter replaceable, and the plot wends on its predictable way. Still, the Creeper itself, and the weird sublevels of this film's psyche, make it more than your average (lack-of-)scarefest. ***",3,Amusing on many levels.,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,2593,"['Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'Victor', 'Salva', '2003', 'Salva', 'same', 'mistake', 'everyone', 'who', 'horror', 'sequel', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'monster', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'said', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'show', 'monster', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'play', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'it.Aside', 'showing', 'sides', 'heads', 'Creeper', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'weird', 'disturbing', 'underside', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'flick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'long', 'tragic', 'tale', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'again', 'check', 'email', 'when', 'next', 'flick', 'out', 'Peaceful', 'Warrior', 'slated', 'release', '2006', 'writing', ""'re"", 'not', 'up', 'details', 'activist', 'groups', 'love', 'give', 'Victor', 'Salva', '[', ']', 'Now', 'here', 'fun', 'part', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'very', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'demons', 'feel', 'other', 'films', 'touch', 'none', 'explore', 'sort', 'detail', 'number', 'buff', 'shirtless', 'young', 'men', 'picture', 'level', 'ludicrous', 'camera', 'certainly', 'linger', 'probably', 'going', 'creep', 'audience', 'out', 'even', 'not', 'aware', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'demons', 'Add', 'millenia-old', 'monster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'sorts', 'nifty', 'properties', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'creepy', 'flick', 'here.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'Creeper', 'whom', 'remember', 'first', 'film', 'out', 'twenty-three', 'years', 'feed', 'getting', 'towards', 'hibernation', 'time', 'Creeper', 'stock', 'up', 'next', 'twenty-three', 'years', 'masquerading', 'scarecrow', 'order', 'abduct', 'farm', 'boy', 'father', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'fame', 'revenge', 'beast', 'then', 'find', 'devour', 'inhabitants', 'school', 'bus', 'bulk', 'film', 'said', 'inhabitants', 'said', 'bus', 'trying', 'survive', 'night', 'Creeper', 'heads', 'back', 'hibernation.Now', 'relatively', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'getting', 'big-name', 'actors', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'as', 'big', 'Wise', 'however', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'underrated', 'best', 'performance', 'here', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Nicki', 'Aycox', 'recently', 'Slap', 'Her', 'French', 'going', 'give', 'really', 'good', 'performance', 'then', 'character', 'suddenly', 'extra', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'else', 'cookie-cutter', 'replaceable', 'plot', 'predictable', 'way', 'Still', 'Creeper', 'weird', 'sublevels', 'film', 'psyche', 'make', 'more', 'average', 'lack-of-', 'scarefest', '***']",N/A

Though the perversion of what he is never shows better than when he is delighting in the scents of his near-future-victims; snuffling and licking at the air in a way that makes your skin crawl.The pacing is a bit differant in this film; a little brisker, a bit more polished.  The characters are for the most part standard stock teens.  Two characters that stand out effectively are the father of a farm child who is abducted, seeking revenge for the death of his little boy, and the family's faithful dog, who warns them of the creatures presence and helps track it.  The obsessed father, wanting to kill the Creeper, is definately a clever take-off of Moby Dick, and it works well.  Instead of falling into the same dismal plot line of past teen/horror films, where the parents are witless and die for the sake of blood on the screen, this man is a rugged contender for the Creeper.  He forges his tools of destruction from fire and water much like the iron monger in Moby Dick forged his harpoon, and I half expected him to slit his forearms and add his own blood to the steel (though I'm glad he didn't, that would've gone over the line into the area of lampooning).The interaction between the teen football team, cheerleaders, and few adults that are stranded on a very long stretch of highway as the Creeper continually assaults them is filled for the most part with believable tension.  All of these actors did a fine job.  The bus driver is standout as plucky and self-relient, and I found myself wishing she had more screen time.  Everyone of the young actors playing highschoolers were believable, and helped move the terror along.I will say that I am terribly disappointed that Gina Philips did not return as the vengeful sister from the first Jeepers Creepers.  I truly expected some of my frustration at the Creeper winning in the first film to be assuaged by a fierce battle between her and the Creeper in the sequel.  I felt her character was an incredibly strong and likable heroine, and I wanted to see more of her.  But perhaps the producers felt that would not be original enough.  Perhaps in a future sequel.All-in-all, a good summer chiller, with some standout performances.",4,More Fun Than The First,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,2817,"['liked', 'first', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '70s/80s', 'horror', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'sequel', 'even', ""'ve"", 'found', 'falling', 'back', 'same', 'old', 'teenagers', 'getting', 'slaughtered', 'plot', 'line', 'What', 'original', 'creature', 'history', 'flesh', 'eating', 'monster', 'can', 'smell', 'out', 'what', 'eat', 'fear', 'victims', 'time', 'creature', 'effects', 'are', 'lot', 'better', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'claim', 'could', 'see', 'zipper', 'monster', 'suit', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Creeper', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'referred', 'tall', 'lanky', 'dark', 'very', 'monstrous', 'perversion', 'what', 'never', 'better', 'when', 'delighting', 'scents', 'near-future-victims', 'snuffling', 'licking', 'air', 'way', 'skin', 'crawl.The', 'pacing', 'bit', 'differant', 'film', 'little', 'brisker', 'bit', 'more', 'polished', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'standard', 'stock', 'teens', 'Two', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'effectively', 'are', 'father', 'farm', 'child', 'who', 'abducted', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'death', 'little', 'boy', 'family', 'faithful', 'dog', 'who', 'creatures', 'presence', 'track', 'obsessed', 'father', 'wanting', 'kill', 'Creeper', 'definately', 'clever', 'take-off', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'well', 'Instead', 'falling', 'same', 'dismal', 'plot', 'line', 'past', 'teen/horror', 'films', 'where', 'parents', 'are', 'witless', 'die', 'sake', 'blood', 'screen', 'man', 'rugged', 'contender', 'Creeper', 'tools', 'destruction', 'fire', 'water', 'much', 'iron', 'monger', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'forged', 'harpoon', 'half', 'expected', 'slit', 'forearms', 'add', 'own', 'blood', 'steel', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'line', 'area', 'lampooning', '.The', 'interaction', 'teen', 'football', 'team', 'cheerleaders', 'few', 'adults', 'are', 'stranded', 'very', 'long', 'stretch', 'highway', 'Creeper', 'continually', 'assaults', 'filled', 'most', 'part', 'believable', 'tension', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'bus', 'driver', 'standout', 'plucky', 'self-relient', 'found', 'wishing', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Everyone', 'young', 'actors', 'playing', 'highschoolers', 'were', 'believable', 'helped', 'move', 'terror', 'along.I', 'will', 'say', 'am', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'vengeful', 'sister', 'first', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'truly', 'expected', 'frustration', 'Creeper', 'winning', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'assuaged', 'fierce', 'battle', 'Creeper', 'sequel', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'likable', 'heroine', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'perhaps', 'producers', 'felt', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'original', 'enough', 'Perhaps', 'future', 'sequel.All-in-all', 'good', 'summer', 'chiller', 'standout', 'performances']",N/A

Just to back track, I felt that the first movie had about a dozen plot holes that were never quite filled.  For example, in the original, there was the &quot;sorta psychic&quot; who knew something was going to happen, but not what it was.  Why did the Creeper drive around in that truck if it could fly?  What was with that woman who had all of those cats?  Were they supposed to ward off the Creeper?  Why did the Creeper stitch all the corpses back together?  Why would anyone live on East 9 if every 23 years there's a horrible mass murder?  Wouldn't, eventually, everyone get the idea and move?  The sequel doesn't answer any of these, but did succeed in not backing itself into any questions it isn't going to answer either.However, it accomplished this by foregoing the plot and story entirely.  Seems it only got in the way.  In this movie, the Creeper attacks a bus ... the end.  Cool huh?  Boy I'm sure glad that there's none of that stupid ""character development"" thing to get in the way.Also, what did this movie cost to make?  Considering that the set design was limited to about 5 cars from the 40's, the inside of a bus, and someone's backyard, it must have taken all of about fifty dollars to produce this thing.  What did Salva (who, by the way, is a convicted child-molester) spend all of his money on?

This time it's on the open road, the target a bus load of teenagers, kinda like a rolling box lunch.  We get more Creeper on screen this time and therefore more gore.This sequel works by making the monster the star, by showing us all the messed up things it can do up close.  Remember, this monster likes its meat tainted with fear induced adrenaline.I was really surprised by how I didn't get annoyed with the much larger cast, usually with this many speaking parts at least one character will irk me.  I have to say everybody in this film was believable in their parts, so kudos to the casting director.Usually with any potential horror series you get a quickly produced rehashing of the original, probably with a higher body count.  While we do get the increase in corpses we also get a well executed script that stands alone from the original.  You don't have to see Jeepers Creepers 1 to get Jeepers Creepers 2.  That's an awesome thing to my horror-movie addled brain.  Another strong point for this film is the continuation of the very interesting mythology for the creature, I still get the heebie jeebies thinking about the damage the Creeper has done throughout history.If you're still not convinced to give this movie a shot let me just say this: SELF DECAPITATION.  Let that sink in.  This movie gives you that seemingly impossible act in one very memorable scene, reinforcing the uniqueness of the Creeper in the Horror movie Pantheon.  Other things to look out for are a kickass javelin scene, a very unnerving sardine can station wagon,the Post Puncher 500, and the scarecrow.The only thing that kept me from giving this movie 5 stars was this feeling I get that the filmmakers are pulling some punches; yes for all the nastiness in Jeepers Creepers 2 I still can't help thinking that the Creeper isn't being allowed to reach his full potential.  This is a monster that has literally cut swathes through human history, perhaps inspiring the boogeyman concept itself.

This movie did not scare me at all.  The Creeper is back, but this time instead of using that beat up old truck to terrorize his victims, he is flying a lot more in this movie.  A school bus on it's way back from a game is stranded on the road with a flat tire. Upon further inspection, it's realized that the flat tire may not be an accident.  As the adults are the first victim of the Creeper, the kids find they have to fend for themselves.The scenes that were shocking in JC2 would end too quickly because I would find myself laughing next.  The scene that made me laugh the most is when the creeper is making his faces as he picks out his victims.  He is winking, and giving thumbs up, then I remembered, I'm watching a horror flick, not a comedy!  If horror movies make me laugh, it's a flop in my opinion.  If I want to laugh, I will rent a comedy.  There were scenes where the Derry from the first movie is giving Minxy background information she needs to know about the creature.  The main problem I had is you don't learn anything new.  He comes every 23 years, and for 23 days it feeds.  I still don't know where this creature comes from, and why?  Still too many unanswered questions about the Creeper which leaves me dissatisfied.  This is one movie I won't be watching again.

780884,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0000E2R6O,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 4]","As great as the first ""Jeepers Creepers"" was - among the best horror movies of 2001, no forget that: among the best Movies of 2001 - ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" surpasses it, bloody near blows it out of the water in some respects, giving us what has to be among the top ten or so monster movies of all time.Picking up just days after the events of its predecessor, during the same 23-day reign of terror the ghastly, winged Creeper embarks on once every twenty-three years, it captivates from the opening frames right through to the end.  Centering on the Creeper's crippling of a bus full of high school athletes, cheerleaders (putting cheerleaders in a movie is almost never a bad thing) and school staff on a remote stretch of highway and the subsequent reign of horror, the movie is first rate all the way.  Incredible special effects (on par with ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" and the most advanced ""Star Wars"" effects),  solid, believable characterization - often based on the camera angle of a single facial expression as much as on dialogue and actions - and sursprisingly complex inter-character relationships established within a very short time, making maximum use of every minute of screen time; award-worthy cinematography - for example, the Creeper soaring over the moonlit cornfields, a scene that combines the terrifying with the magnificent to perfection.  The acting is top-notch, among the best ensemble casts of 2003 (a year that saw a plethora of great performances hit the big and small screens); I admittedly know little about the other work of the cast members - I saw Ray Wise in ""Dead End"" (a great horror-mystery with Alexandra Holden, one of my personal favorites), but I don't think I've seen any of the others in anything else; Garikayi Mutambirwa, Nicki Aycock and Billy Aaron Brown are especially impressive.  Aycock plays a girl who, as the bus passes through the territory of the Creeper, unexpectedly develops psychic powers, including the ability to communicate with the ghosts of previous victims of the monster.  The fact that it's never explained how this happened but is made clear how it never happened to her before is preferable to an overexplanation; it's like just being in the mere vicinity of the Creeper can mix up the normal flow of reality, resulting in all kinds of strange phenomenon; ones which defy easy, rational explanations.The smallest detail is looked after - the lighting captures the beautiful countryside the bus travels through perfectly; the strange weapons of the Creeper are detailed and dead-on realistic; the musical score hits all the right notes (no pun intended).  The one potential misstep is the conclusion, which may limit the number of paths a sequel could take; then again, maybe the filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing and already have the path planned out for the next chapter.  Personally, I'd like to see the next couple be prequels (I think somebody said something about an actual prequel set in the Old West, which I think could be excellent, but that might have just been rumor) and not have the next actual sequel come out until 2024, 23 years to the day after Jeepers 1 was unleashed.  The surviving characters from the first two, bring back played by the same performers. It'd be a long time to wait (despite a couple of prequels in the meantime) but think of the anticipation!I'd be remiss in not pointing out one last observance: this is one where, like in the ""Dawn Of the Dead"" remake, you see the extreme horrors bringing out the best in some characters and the worst in others.  Not to give anything away (this is another of those ""in the first twenty-five minutes"" disclaimers) but Ray Wise's character, in the very beginning is not very likable at all, but a short while later, in one of those extended facial shots I talked about earlier, you can see every regret he's ever had written across his motionless face.

It can smell something on a person when they're afraid, catching some nameless component that attracts it to certain people and, more importantly, to specific parts of that person that it wants to devour. After that, it keeps on coming and coming until it gets what it wants - period.Before I begin, I have to say that I wasn't really a big fan of the first movie because it lacked quite a few things. It had an interesting monster, sure, and the creature had some interesting habits. I personally liked the fact that it didn't let the bystanders get away simply because it didn't want to eat them, opting instead to kill almost anyone that happened across its path. I also liked the fact that it fed on fear, finding the scent of its prey overly alluring, and that it became unstoppable when it went after its quarry. What I didn't like was a ""Jeepers Creepers"" storyline that consisted of (1) really campy theatrics playing off the old song, (2) the ""beatingu"" truck, (3) and ending on a bad not. So, coming into the second movie, I thought I'd be disappointed. Well, I was wrong.The approach this movie took in addressing the first movie was simple. Not only do it use that as a platform to introduce the beast, but it also use that first portion almost like a prequel to the newest movie. It didn't try to rewrite anything and to sequel it out, nor did it hope to correct something by making it better. Where the last ended on a high note with the killing only beginning, the second is allowed to continue. It has to introduce the entrees, mind you, giving them all names and a little bit of development, but it doesn't have to add in a little jingle as the killing machine comes to collect its dinner. Gone is the psychic, replaced by a theme that provides more frightening bits of movie, and replaced is the brother and sister combo running for their lives. The deeds of the first movie are mentioned and a bodycount is thrown into the fray, but now we pick up with a bus full of football players on their way home from a championship, a farmer and his son, and anyone unlucky enough to stray into the picture. The dying kicks in quickly, too, and the result of that is a far better piece of excitement than the original film.One thing I really liked seeing was the time spent on the beast itself. Gone were all the quick shots and the hidden glances of it, and thrown out were the ""less is more"" approach to making a movie. Now we have a monster showing us what it can do, touting why it has survived this long, and dishing out a lot more than a few kids seem to be ready to handle. Through the combination of CGI, the loss of the vehicle, and prolonged exposure to the tactics of fear, we see the monster as it finds its rabbit, entraps them, and goes to pick them off by way of weaponry and wit. Perhaps the tense times with those teens sometimes get annoying while they are living, but what else can one expect from a bus full of live bait other than some squirming?For anyone that hasn't seen this but that liked the first one, then this should be right up your alley. As I said before, this could be connected to the first as a film and left to make its rounds, allowing you one complete piece. It even has an ending that is mentionable and deleted scenes trying to develop the monster a little more, citing the creature as a timeless terror it would truly be. For people that didn't really like the first, this movie might be something you'd like, too. I was initially hesitant to watch another dose of Jeepers Creepers, thinking that it would be yet another waste of time and energy. Thankfully I gave it a chance, picking it up on its release day, and I've had to watch the carnage a few times because watching it was fun. Seeing the people replaced at the top of the food chain by something with pretty teeth and some perturbing eating habits is something that ""makes bank"" in my book.",5,"Teens, Twinkies and Terror: Buses + Their Bipedal Filling!",1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,3947,"['23', 'years', '23', 'days', 'feed', 'can', 'smell', 'something', 'person', 'when', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'catching', 'nameless', 'component', 'certain', 'people', 'more', 'importantly', 'specific', 'parts', 'person', 'devour', 'coming', 'coming', 'what', 'period.Before', 'begin', 'have', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'first', 'movie', 'lacked', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'had', 'interesting', 'monster', 'sure', 'creature', 'had', 'interesting', 'habits', 'personally', 'liked', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'bystanders', 'get', 'away', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'eat', 'opting', 'instead', 'kill', 'almost', 'anyone', 'happened', 'path', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'fed', 'fear', 'finding', 'scent', 'prey', 'overly', 'alluring', 'became', 'unstoppable', 'when', 'went', 'quarry', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'storyline', 'consisted', '1', 'really', 'campy', 'theatrics', 'playing', 'off', 'old', 'song', '2', 'beatingu', 'truck', '3', 'ending', 'bad', 'not', 'So', 'coming', 'second', 'movie', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Well', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'approach', 'movie', 'took', 'addressing', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'simple', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'use', 'platform', 'introduce', 'beast', 'also', 'use', 'first', 'portion', 'almost', 'prequel', 'newest', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'rewrite', 'anything', 'sequel', 'out', 'did', 'hope', 'correct', 'something', 'making', 'better', 'Where', 'last', 'ended', 'high', 'note', 'killing', 'only', 'beginning', 'second', 'allowed', 'continue', 'introduce', 'entrees', 'mind', 'giving', 'names', 'little', 'bit', 'development', ""n't"", 'have', 'add', 'little', 'jingle', 'killing', 'machine', 'collect', 'dinner', 'Gone', 'psychic', 'replaced', 'theme', 'more', 'frightening', 'bits', 'movie', 'replaced', 'brother', 'sister', 'combo', 'running', 'lives', 'deeds', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'mentioned', 'bodycount', 'thrown', 'fray', 'now', 'pick', 'up', 'bus', 'full', 'football', 'players', 'way', 'home', 'championship', 'farmer', 'son', 'anyone', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'stray', 'picture', 'dying', 'kicks', 'quickly', 'too', 'result', 'far', 'better', 'piece', 'excitement', 'original', 'film.One', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'seeing', 'was', 'time', 'spent', 'beast', 'Gone', 'were', 'quick', 'shots', 'hidden', 'glances', 'thrown', 'out', 'were', 'less', 'more', 'approach', 'making', 'movie', 'Now', 'have', 'monster', 'showing', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'touting', 'why', 'survived', 'long', 'dishing', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'few', 'kids', 'seem', 'be', 'ready', 'handle', 'combination', 'CGI', 'loss', 'vehicle', 'prolonged', 'exposure', 'tactics', 'fear', 'see', 'monster', 'rabbit', 'pick', 'off', 'way', 'weaponry', 'wit', 'Perhaps', 'tense', 'times', 'teens', 'sometimes', 'get', 'annoying', 'are', 'living', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'one', 'expect', 'bus', 'full', 'live', 'bait', 'other', 'squirming', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'seen', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'said', 'before', 'could', 'be', 'connected', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'make', 'rounds', 'allowing', 'one', 'complete', 'piece', 'even', 'ending', 'mentionable', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trying', 'develop', 'monster', 'little', 'more', 'citing', 'creature', 'timeless', 'terror', 'would', 'truly', 'be', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'first', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'something', ""'d"", 'like', 'too', 'was', 'initially', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'dose', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'yet', 'waste', 'time', 'energy', 'Thankfully', 'gave', 'chance', 'picking', 'up', 'release', 'day', ""'ve"", 'had', 'watch', 'carnage', 'few', 'times', 'watching', 'was', 'fun', 'Seeing', 'people', 'replaced', 'top', 'food', 'chain', 'something', 'pretty', 'teeth', 'perturbing', 'eating', 'habits', 'something', 'bank', 'book']",N/A
780901,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0000E2R6O,trebe,"[1, 1]","Writer/director Victor Salva's apparently did not intend for there to be a sequel to his film Jeepers Creepers (2001), but given the success of the film, the situation was certainly ripe, for the Creeper to reappear.  Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003), set four days after the events in the first film, is all about the Creeper, who spends the entire film on a vicious killing spree.  Whereas in the first film, the monster was kept under wraps, here he strikes boldly, grabbing a young boy from a cornfield, after posing as a scarecrow.  Jack Taggart (Ray Wise) the boy's father, and his older son Jack Jr. are traumatized by their loss, but Taggart is determined to get revenge somehow.Played again by Jonathan Breck, the Creeper's next target is a bus carrying a basketball team.  Blowing out its tires with macabre throwing stars, leaves the bus stranded in the middle of nowhere.  The adults in the party are quickly carried away into the night, leaving the team, and three cheerleaders at the mercy of the hungry, scent sensitive creature.  Cheerleader Minxie Hayes (Nicki Aycox) has a dream, where she sees Darry (Justin Long), a victim in the first film.  He warns her of the terror soon to come.  The conflicted group generally lacks leadership, but fights back, gravely injuring the monster.  In need of a replacement head, the Creeper procures one, using his strange regenerative powers to grow a new one.Jack Taggart arrives with a special weapon to take on the beast, as the Creeper continues to harvest his prey.  The idea of using a modified farm tool as a weapon is brilliant, and the special effects are superbly executed, as the film builds to a spectacular and gut satisfying conclusion.  Jeepers Creepers 2 is an Aliens type sequel, where the monster is turned loose, and goes on a furious rampage.  The level of action is elevated from the start, and moves forward briskly, rarely stopping for air.  Salva's script is very tight, emphasizing action, rather than character development, but leaving few loose ends hanging.  The ensemble cast features a number of newcomers, but the performances are mostly good, in this tense, gripping, high-energy thriller.Like the first film, the DVD release is a very solid and comprehensive package, with ample bonus materials.  Victor Salva is joined by many members of the cast for an entertaining and fun commentary track.  Salva apparently has an affinity for working with young people.  Jonathan Breck, illustrator Brad Parker, and Brian Penikas (special effects), contribute a second commentary track.  Playing the fearsome Creeper, Breck has a disarming soft southern drawl, and provides some interesting anecdotes.  There are also several excellent behind the scenes type featurettes, that help contribute to an understanding and appreciation of the sequel.

780902,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000E2R6O,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","So, they made it again, the sequel to the surprise horror hit.  Don't ask me if this is better than the first one, because frankly I don't know,  But several things are certain about this horror about man-eating creature &quot;Creeper&quot; played competently by Jonathan Breck, and they are; A) the story is more coherent, or conventional:  B) more humor is thrown in: and C) the monster is the best thing in the film.The story is aptly simple; the high school basketball players are going home in a school bus (with obligatory cheerleaders in T-shirt), but they all get stranded in the middle of the two-lane road.  The cell phones are dead; there is no help around them; so this means they are in trouble, this time, a real one.  And some flying creature is looking down from up above, waiting for the moment to snatch them one by one.In the meantime, Ray Wise (&quot;Twin Peaks,&quot; remember?) is the father with a hand-made harpoon on a pick-up truck, who is willing to hunt down the nasty creature because of the reason you see in the pretty scary opening scene.  He and his son are heading to the spot where the bus is, and now, you know the rest of the story.Victor Salva has quirky sense of humor, I think.  The non-descriptive kids trapped inside the bus become exactly &quot;the canned food&quot; for Creeper, who can pick up (yes, he does, with a bit of humor) the tasty ones.  Don't try to think about the logics.  The film knows what it is doing when Creeper pretends to be a scarecrow (see the poster), as if playing hide-and-seek.The film may not be scary for this reason -- very sly humors -- but to some audiences like me, it delivers tremendously.  If you are horror film fans, you might detect the exact moment some 'surprising' thing would happen.  Actually, the biggest surprise is that the monster got another trick or two, sometimes acting like ninja.  Well, if you like that kind of surprise....&quot;Jeepers Creepers 2&quot; does not follow the 'anything goes' formula, in which the creature's identity is quite confusing (truck? winged monster?).  Still, I find this sequel is as entertaining, if not scary, as the original one.",3,Entertaining If You Like the &quot;Creeper&quot; and His Sly &quot;Humor&quot;,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,2157,"['So', 'made', 'again', 'sequel', 'surprise', 'horror', 'hit', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'several', 'things', 'are', 'certain', 'horror', 'man-eating', 'creature', 'quot', 'Creeper', 'quot', 'played', 'competently', 'Jonathan', 'Breck', 'are', 'A', 'story', 'more', 'coherent', 'conventional', 'B', 'more', 'humor', 'thrown', 'C', 'monster', 'best', 'thing', 'film.The', 'story', 'aptly', 'simple', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'players', 'are', 'going', 'home', 'school', 'bus', 'obligatory', 'cheerleaders', 'T-shirt', 'get', 'stranded', 'middle', 'two-lane', 'road', 'cell', 'phones', 'are', 'dead', 'help', 'so', 'are', 'trouble', 'time', 'real', 'one', 'flying', 'creature', 'looking', 'down', 'waiting', 'moment', 'snatch', 'one', 'one.In', 'meantime', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'quot', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'quot', 'remember', 'father', 'hand-made', 'harpoon', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'who', 'willing', 'hunt', 'down', 'nasty', 'creature', 'reason', 'see', 'pretty', 'scary', 'opening', 'scene', 'son', 'are', 'heading', 'spot', 'where', 'bus', 'now', 'know', 'rest', 'story.Victor', 'Salva', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'think', 'non-descriptive', 'kids', 'trapped', 'bus', 'become', 'exactly', 'quot', 'canned', 'food', 'quot', 'Creeper', 'who', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'yes', 'bit', 'humor', 'tasty', 'ones', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'think', 'logics', 'film', 'what', 'doing', 'when', 'Creeper', 'be', 'scarecrow', 'see', 'poster', 'playing', 'hide-and-seek.The', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'scary', 'reason', 'very', 'sly', 'humors', 'audiences', 'tremendously', 'are', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'might', 'detect', 'exact', 'moment', ""'surprising"", ""'"", 'thing', 'would', 'happen', 'Actually', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'monster', 'got', 'trick', 'two', 'sometimes', 'acting', 'ninja', 'Well', 'like', 'kind', 'surprise', 'quot', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'quot', 'not', 'follow', ""'anything"", 'formula', 'creature', 'identity', 'quite', 'confusing', 'truck', 'winged', 'monster', 'Still', 'find', 'sequel', 'entertaining', 'not', 'scary', 'original', 'one']",N/A

I must say though that I was disappointed that it wasn't more closely fitted with the first film.  I mean it had Derry in it for a few seconds, but that was it.  I always hoped that the sequel would be Derry's sister after 23 years waiting for the thing and trying to kill it.  This movie took us to something totally different.  The terrorizing of a bus full of kids coming from a game.The movie kinda confused me at first because a boy is attacked in the field and then the father is very upset and then it flashes to the kids on the bus.  So for a while, I thought that the father was one of the boys on the bus that survived the attack 23 years ago, but that was not the case.  I know the man had just lost his son, but he seemed bent on killing this thing that he knew absolutely nothing about and that was kinda weird.  I mean, this thing had a wingspan probably the size of a barn, yet he was going to try to go out and attack it with just his son in his raggedy old truck. Aargh, who knows?Anyways, fortunately some of the kids survive, so it wasn't a total bum out and the end kinda leaves an opening for another movie.I don't know if Victor plans to or not, but it could.Oh yeah, there were several spots where I got quite a laugh.  I don't know if it was suppose to be funny, but it was.Okay, so if the movie came on cable again, I would probably watch it, but in no big rush to see it again.
