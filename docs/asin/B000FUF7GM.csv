L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[0, 0]","I could live with being the least popular member of the Who, and I'm guessing fans of that great band gravitated more to drummer Keith Moon, guitarist Pete Townsend and vocalist Roger Daltrey than they did bassist John Entwistle. Even Entwistle, who died in 2002, deemed himself ""the Quiet One."" Nonetheless, he deserves no less attention than he receives in the fine 2006 documentary AN OX'S TALE: THE JOHN ENTWISTLE STORY.AN OX'S TALE reminds us that John Entwistle, while he certainly earned his share of the credit for the Who's success, was more responsible than anyone for enriching the use of bass guitar.  Musicologists, please correct me if this film and I are wrong, but until Entwistle and the Who hit it big how many records did you note for their bass?  Sure, James Jamerson and Paul McCartney came before the Who and while they may have cracked opened the door for creative bassists, didn't Entwistle then kick it down?It is unfortunate that Who singer Roger Daltrey is not among the AN OX'S TALE interview subjects, which include Chris Squier of Yes, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, and Pete Townshend.  Daltrey's vocals on Entwistle compositions such as ""Trick of the Light,"" ""Had Enough,"" ""It's Your Turn,"" and ""You"" made for contributions that held their own alongside the many great Townshend songs on those Who albums.  But I don't want to assume Daltrey refused to participate, because AN OX'S TALE seems low-budget and the time and money necessary to talk to everyone may not have been available to the filmmakers. I mean, it probably isn't too hard to get an interview with Kenny Jones and Zak Starkey, the Who drummers who followed the late Keith Moon, but they do not appear in the film, either.AN OX'S TALE: THE JOHN ENTWISTLE STORY tells us John Entwistle was nicknamed ""Ox"" not because of his imposing build but rather his durability, being a man who could hold liquor like he held his bass guitar.  See this documentary to learn a little more about this extraordinary artist we lost too soon.While I never picked up another John Entwistle solo album, for three decades and counting I've always caught some grooves listening to his 1981 release TOO LATE THE HERO.  That might have made a better title for this film, though I can understand why they went with AN OX'S TALE.  Other musicians were in the spotlight more and while it's too late for John Entwistle, his talent was heroic.",3,Too late the hero,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,2406,"['could', 'live', 'being', 'least', 'popular', 'member', 'Who', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'fans', 'great', 'band', 'gravitated', 'more', 'drummer', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'guitarist', 'Pete', 'Townsend', 'vocalist', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'did', 'bassist', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'Even', 'Entwistle', 'who', 'died', '2002', 'deemed', 'Quiet', 'One', 'Nonetheless', 'less', 'attention', 'fine', '2006', 'documentary', 'AN', 'OX', 'TALE', 'JOHN', 'ENTWISTLE', 'STORY.AN', 'OX', 'TALE', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'certainly', 'earned', 'share', 'credit', 'Who', 'success', 'was', 'more', 'responsible', 'anyone', 'enriching', 'use', 'bass', 'guitar', 'Musicologists', 'please', 'correct', 'film', 'are', 'wrong', 'Entwistle', 'Who', 'hit', 'big', 'how', 'many', 'records', 'did', 'note', 'bass', 'Sure', 'James', 'Jamerson', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'came', 'Who', 'may', 'have', 'cracked', 'opened', 'door', 'creative', 'bassists', 'did', ""n't"", 'Entwistle', 'then', 'kick', 'down', 'unfortunate', 'Who', 'singer', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'not', 'AN', 'OX', 'TALE', 'interview', 'subjects', 'include', 'Chris', 'Squier', 'Yes', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'Doors', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'Daltrey', 'vocals', 'Entwistle', 'compositions', 'such', 'Trick', 'Light', 'Had', 'Enough', 'Your', 'Turn', 'made', 'contributions', 'held', 'own', 'many', 'great', 'Townshend', 'songs', 'Who', 'albums', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'assume', 'Daltrey', 'refused', 'participate', 'AN', 'OX', 'TALE', 'low-budget', 'time', 'money', 'necessary', 'talk', 'everyone', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'available', 'filmmakers', 'mean', 'probably', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard', 'get', 'interview', 'Kenny', 'Jones', 'Zak', 'Starkey', 'Who', 'drummers', 'who', 'followed', 'late', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'film', 'either.AN', 'OX', 'TALE', 'JOHN', 'ENTWISTLE', 'STORY', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'was', 'nicknamed', 'Ox', 'not', 'imposing', 'build', 'rather', 'durability', 'being', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'hold', 'liquor', 'held', 'bass', 'guitar', 'See', 'documentary', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'artist', 'lost', 'too', 'soon.While', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'solo', 'album', 'three', 'decades', 'counting', ""'ve"", 'always', 'caught', 'grooves', 'listening', '1981', 'release', 'TOO', 'LATE', 'HERO', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'title', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'went', 'AN', 'OX', 'TALE', 'Other', 'musicians', 'were', 'spotlight', 'more', 'too', 'late', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'talent', 'was', 'heroic']",John Entwistle - An Ox Tale

Pearl ""J Pearl""","[5, 5]","This documentary on John Entwistle is paced and presented well,  exploring his early childhood, how he met up with the other members of The Who, and his subsequent career in and out of that band. There have been many documentaries about The Who, but this once benefits from film footage provided by Chris Stamp, the band's former co-manager. Stamp adds insightful commentary, as do Pete Townshend, Roger Glover, Billy Sheehan, Chris Squire, director Steve Luongo, and other friends, family and associates of the late and lamented Ox. The bassist's death is treated somewhat subtly, but it's made clearer that John's lifestyle undermined his health leading up to his death at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas the morning of The Who's planned tour opening gig there. Bonus sequences include home movies, an interview with Entwistle's son, plus hard-blasting concert footage featuring The John Entwistle Band.

Aside from the underlying causes of John's premature death, what scars this fine film and tribute to an extraordinary musician is what was not said and by whom.  The lifestyle of rockstars -- drugs and drink, etc. --leads to bad and foolish behavior; that much is certain.  But bad character is another matter and bad character is what is shown here, not by John or Pete, but by the glaring, conspicuous absence of Roger Daltry.  Whatever personal differences Roger may have had with John pale when compared to the loss of a gifted, humble man who was his fellow band member for decades and one of the greatest bass players in the history of rock.  While the brilliant but hyperneurotic Pete was open and frank, Daltry's total silence went beyond disrespect to sink into the nadir of insensitivity and crassness.

I may not be an authority on The Who but one thing seemed pretty clear: John Entwistle loved to perform and tour. 'He'd play at the opening of an envelope' was the quote if I'm not mistaken. So, if they could have asked him what to do, I'd like to think he'd have said 'Do you even have to ask?' I thought by The who playing they enabled more people to join in and honor his memory by doing what he would have loved to do if he could've himself.
