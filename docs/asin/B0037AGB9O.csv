The story involves a cop chasing after a man who has kidnapped and killed children and may be responsbile for the disappearance of the cop's son.  After nearly losing his life in pursuit of the killer he leaves the force and discovers he's developed the ability to see and hear ghosts, including the ghost of the dead child killer. He becomes a private detective, aided by his old partner who's still on the force and his now ex-wife, an assistand DA.  Without revealing too much more let's just say nothing is as it seems in the cases or the now dead child killer.  Unfortunately, the show was cancelled before the next season and the mysteries of the unanswered questions will remain.

I waited to purchase until it dropped below $9.00 (since there are supposed to be only 11 episodes) - & it was a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!  First, there are NO SUBTITLES, all the episodes are dark (hard to see the action), in that it would have been nice for them to have turned on some lights while filming so you could SEE what's going on (they must have been trying to save some money - or they were attempting badly for ""moody and scary"").  All of the episodes are REALLY SLOW moving and DRAG! BORING!!!A lot of us leave a TV on for ""background noise"" while we do other things, this show doesn't even make good background noise.

1329505,A17KFBGZDAFMZ6,B0037AGB9O,Jason Garrett,"[0, 0]","The cast of this short-lived series is both likable and watchable, having gone on to become better-known after the show ended. Matthew (Lost) Fox, Russell (Grimm) Hornsby, Lynn (John Carter) Collins and Michael (The Unit) Irby are the main players, though the latter two are on a revolving door from episode to episode. Despite its title, the show isn't very chilling or even spooky. The 11 episodes sometimes seem longer than their allotted time, with a few nice surprises in the mix. A pre-NCIS Pauley Perrette is probably the most-recognizable guest star next to a couple of young CSI:NY mainstays. The most frustrating thing about the set, however, is the fact that the major plot is never resolved. The final episode was, apparently, not the final episode of the series, just the last one to air and the last one included on the disc. I say this only because Matthew Fox is credited for 12 episodes and the discs have only 11. A complete season one might have made this a better set, but who's to say for sure? Also, the pilot is (effectively) set in Seattle but the rest of the series is set in Los Angeles without a single mention of the change. It tries to capitalize on the same energy as the series Angel, in that regard, but never quite gets there.Worth seeing for the cast, but the only truly haunting aspect is the lack of an ending.",3,Not 'Haunted' but it may leave you cold...,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,1346,"['cast', 'short-lived', 'series', 'likable', 'watchable', 'having', 'gone', 'become', 'better-known', 'show', 'ended', 'Matthew', 'Lost', 'Fox', 'Russell', 'Grimm', 'Hornsby', 'Lynn', 'John', 'Carter', 'Collins', 'Michael', 'Unit', 'Irby', 'are', 'main', 'players', 'latter', 'two', 'are', 'revolving', 'door', 'episode', 'episode', 'title', 'show', ""n't"", 'very', 'chilling', 'even', 'spooky', '11', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'longer', 'allotted', 'time', 'few', 'nice', 'surprises', 'mix', 'pre-NCIS', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'probably', 'most-recognizable', 'guest', 'star', 'couple', 'young', 'CSI', 'NY', 'mainstays', 'most', 'frustrating', 'thing', 'set', 'however', 'fact', 'major', 'plot', 'never', 'resolved', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'just', 'last', 'one', 'air', 'last', 'one', 'included', 'disc', 'say', 'only', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'credited', '12', 'episodes', 'discs', 'have', 'only', '11', 'complete', 'season', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'set', 'who', 'say', 'sure', 'Also', 'pilot', 'effectively', 'set', 'Seattle', 'rest', 'series', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'single', 'mention', 'change', 'capitalize', 'same', 'energy', 'series', 'Angel', 'regard', 'never', 'quite', 'there.Worth', 'seeing', 'cast', 'only', 'truly', 'haunting', 'aspect', 'lack', 'ending']",N/A

1329516,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0037AGB9O,Tim Janson,"[3, 5]","Before becoming one of the stars of ABC's hit series ""Lost"" Matthew Fox starred in the short-lived 2002 series ""Haunted"".  The show broadcast only seven of the eleven produced episodes on the UPN network before being canceled.  The complete series with all eleven episodes is now out on DVD courtesy of Phase4 Films.  Haunted's biggest mistake was that it arrived too early.  Just two years later in 2005, several similarly themed shows like ""Ghost Whisperer"", ""The Medium"", and ""Supernatural"" would debut and become staples in the primetime TV schedule.Fox is former police detective and current private investigator Frank Taylor.  His life and marriage was shattered a couple of years earlier by the unsolved abduction of his young son.  His ex-wife Jessica (Lynn Collins) is a lawyer with the local District Attorney's office so the two frequently interact over the course of the series.  As the pilot episode opens Frank is on the trailer of a suspected child molester who he thinks may be connected to his son's disappearance.  Taylor chases the suspect, Simon Dunn, to the roof of an apartment building where Dunn stabs Taylor before falling to his death.  As Frank lies on a hospital operating table he has an out of boy experience where he sees his son and other people walking into a light.  Frank is revived but brings a bit of the spirit world back with him.  He can now see and hear spirits although they are not always friendly or helpful.  In fact, the spirit of Simon Dunn haunts him throughout the series run, constantly taunting Frank.Over the next ten episodes Frank investigates a number of murders and encounters spirits who both try to help and hinder his investigations.  Early on the episodes were almost straight cop drama with moderate supernatural elements.  This might partly explain the low ratings for the show as it didn't seem to want to fully embrace its paranormal side.  Later episodes would display more supernatural plots.  The most notable of these was ""Three Hour Tour"" when Frank is injured in an accident along a country road and is taken in by a family living in a cabin in the woods.  Frank becomes friends with the little girl but begins to notice something odd about her reclusive parents.  This episode was one of the highlights of the series and broke out of its murder-of-the-week mold.Another key episode was ""Simon Redux"".  Frank begins to investigate the ghost that continues to haunt him and finds out that Simon Dunn is not the man Frank thought he was.  Simon is not happy with Frank prying into his past, and possesses the body of Jessica's new boyfriend to threaten her life.  This one of the more terrifying episodes of the show as Simon (played by John Mann) was a strong villain who you knew was capable of doing real harm to Jessica.""Haunted"" was somewhat of a breeding ground for future genre TV stars.  Besides Fox, Zachary Quinto, Robert Knepper, Jessalyn Gilsig of ""Heroes"", and Ken Marino of ""Reaper"" all made appearances on the show.  The series didn't have a great deal of special effects.  Early on the ghosts were simply actors in makeup visual effects consisted mainly of objects moving on their own.  As the series progressed the effects got a bit more elaborate with ghosts becoming transparent but there certainly wasn't much in the way of CGI effects.The cancelation axe came suddenly so the show was not able to go out under its own terms.  The last episode, ""Seeking Asylum"" has Frank going undercover in an asylum.  There's nothing special about the last episode and several plot threads are left unresolved.  If ""Haunted"" had come along a few years later there's a chance that it may have been successful or at the very least, made it through one full season.

Reminds me a little of the Ghost Whisperer but with a more dark gritty edge to it.  Frank is a ex-cop turned detective who lost his child and marriage.  While on a case he dies and is then brought back, to the ghosts he's like a human glow stick.  All eleven episodes are excellent with great acting, writing and direction.  Like other great shows this one was canceled too soon.  At least they didn't leave us with a cliff hanger so you won't feel like you were left hanging.  Don't let the title fool you this is top notch television.  For bargain hunters this is available at Walmart for under 20 bucks.",5,He brought the dead back with him,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,681,"['almost', 'passed', 'one', 'cable', 'marathon', 'due', 'generic', 'title', 'little', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'more', 'dark', 'gritty', 'edge', 'Frank', 'ex-cop', 'turned', 'detective', 'who', 'lost', 'child', 'marriage', 'case', 'then', 'brought', 'back', 'ghosts', 'human', 'glow', 'stick', 'eleven', 'episodes', 'are', 'excellent', 'great', 'acting', 'writing', 'direction', 'other', 'great', 'shows', 'one', 'was', 'canceled', 'too', 'soon', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'were', 'left', 'hanging', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'title', 'fool', 'top', 'notch', 'television', 'bargain', 'hunters', 'available', 'Walmart', '20', 'bucks']",N/A
