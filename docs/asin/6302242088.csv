Goodwin,"[2, 10]","It is unfortunate that Hollywood cannnot do a writer justice, they usually change the script so repetively that the author's true genius is lost. If Midnight or Lightning had been made into movies Hollywood would have botch them.This movie comes dangerously close to it. Thank God it is only  fictional or they would have totally castrated it, as they did with Black Hawk Down and We were soldiers once and young. With the exception of Pixar Studios and a few select films Hollywood castrates everthing they touch. My advice read the books, and carefully choose your movies. I mean how many times have you said aloud, whether you have cable or satelite there is nothing on worth watching. My god look at horrible the news is done, no more true hardball reporting, just reporting for couch potatoes to damn lazy to read the news and get an in depth report.",3,Hollywoods misfortunes,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,855,"['unfortunate', 'Hollywood', 'cannnot', 'do', 'writer', 'justice', 'usually', 'change', 'script', 'so', 'repetively', 'author', 'true', 'genius', 'lost', 'Midnight', 'Lightning', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'botch', 'them.This', 'movie', 'dangerously', 'close', 'Thank', 'God', 'only', 'fictional', 'would', 'have', 'totally', 'castrated', 'did', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'were', 'soldiers', 'once', 'young', 'exception', 'Pixar', 'Studios', 'few', 'select', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'castrates', 'everthing', 'touch', 'My', 'advice', 'read', 'books', 'carefully', 'choose', 'movies', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'said', 'aloud', 'have', 'cable', 'satelite', 'nothing', 'worth', 'watching', 'My', 'god', 'look', 'horrible', 'news', 'done', 'more', 'true', 'hardball', 'reporting', 'just', 'reporting', 'couch', 'potatoes', 'damn', 'lazy', 'read', 'news', 'get', 'depth', 'report']",N/A

There was the dismissal chop-shop of Phantoms, the entertaining Watchers, Whispers...and then there was the rarely mentioned but captivating Servants of Twilight.The plot may resemble an Omen rip-off at first glance, but it would be a shame is every story of the antichrist or supposed antichrist was automatically labeled this way. The plot is simple yet entertaining. An eccentric and nutty religious cult is ran by a fanatic who claims to get visions, marks of God, and thinks she has found the antichrist in the body of an adorable little boy. The kid and his single mother first run into the crazed woman in the parking lot where they make their narrow escape. Not realizing the seriousness of the situation until they find the mutilator body of the family dog Brandy, they then hire the help of Charlie Harrison, a private detective who pulls the whole witness protection deal.Followers of the cults are undercover every corner and you never know when an attack will occur. Forced to be constantly on the run, this movie is packed with loads of suspense, thrills and action. You get to know the three main characters pretty well and care what happens to each of them. There are surprises along the way, betrayals...and the thought enters your mind--IS the sweet little boy everyone wants to protect indeed the devil's son? Or is he only a victim of the deranged religious group?The acting is all very realistic. Bruce Greenwood as the private detective is well-placed and really pulls the movie along. Jarrett Lenon as the little boy Joey is not annoying, does his roles surprisingly well, and adds what he should at the right moments. The mother Christine (Belinda Bauer) makes you feel for her character and admire her for the love and protection she offers her child. 'Grace', the religion leader, comes to life as a creepy as hell character performed by  Grace Zabriskie.The body count is good for this type of movie but gore isn't excessive. The ending wraps up with a sense of irony. The only qualms I may have is that the ending could have been built up a bit more, but other than that no great weaknesses stood out.Not really frightening, it's more of an action-adventure form of horror with a good story, character-driven details and some well directed suspense. A tantalizing little thriller that is sadly overlooked and actually a book-to-film creation that turned out pleasing. If you've read the book (I haven't) you may already know what happens already and as a result the movie may be less exciting but give it a chance anyway. I know I wasn't disappointed.",3,Okay,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2669,"['knowledge', 'not', 'many', 'Kootnz', 'novels', 'have', 'ventured', 'electrical', 'side', 'life', 'was', 'dismissal', 'chop-shop', 'Phantoms', 'entertaining', 'Watchers', 'Whispers', 'then', 'was', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'captivating', 'Servants', 'Twilight.The', 'plot', 'may', 'resemble', 'Omen', 'rip-off', 'first', 'glance', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'story', 'antichrist', 'supposed', 'antichrist', 'was', 'automatically', 'labeled', 'way', 'plot', 'simple', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'eccentric', 'nutty', 'religious', 'cult', 'ran', 'fanatic', 'who', 'get', 'visions', 'marks', 'God', 'found', 'antichrist', 'body', 'adorable', 'little', 'boy', 'kid', 'single', 'mother', 'first', 'run', 'crazed', 'woman', 'parking', 'lot', 'where', 'make', 'narrow', 'escape', 'Not', 'realizing', 'seriousness', 'situation', 'find', 'mutilator', 'body', 'family', 'dog', 'Brandy', 'then', 'hire', 'help', 'Charlie', 'Harrison', 'private', 'detective', 'who', 'whole', 'witness', 'protection', 'deal.Followers', 'cults', 'are', 'undercover', 'corner', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'attack', 'will', 'occur', 'Forced', 'be', 'constantly', 'run', 'movie', 'packed', 'loads', 'suspense', 'thrills', 'action', 'get', 'know', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'pretty', 'well', 'care', 'what', 'are', 'surprises', 'way', 'betrayals', 'thought', 'enters', 'mind', 'sweet', 'little', 'boy', 'everyone', 'protect', 'indeed', 'devil', 'son', 'only', 'victim', 'deranged', 'religious', 'group', 'acting', 'very', 'realistic', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'private', 'detective', 'well-placed', 'really', 'movie', 'Jarrett', 'Lenon', 'little', 'boy', 'Joey', 'not', 'annoying', 'roles', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'what', 'should', 'right', 'moments', 'mother', 'Christine', 'Belinda', 'Bauer', 'feel', 'character', 'admire', 'love', 'protection', 'child', ""'Grace"", 'religion', 'leader', 'life', 'creepy', 'hell', 'character', 'performed', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie.The', 'body', 'count', 'good', 'type', 'movie', 'gore', ""n't"", 'excessive', 'ending', 'wraps', 'up', 'sense', 'irony', 'only', 'qualms', 'may', 'have', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'other', 'great', 'weaknesses', 'stood', 'out.Not', 'really', 'frightening', 'more', 'action-adventure', 'form', 'horror', 'good', 'story', 'character-driven', 'details', 'well', 'directed', 'suspense', 'tantalizing', 'little', 'thriller', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'actually', 'book-to-film', 'creation', 'turned', 'out', 'pleasing', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'may', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'already', 'result', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'exciting', 'give', 'chance', 'anyway', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed']",N/A
