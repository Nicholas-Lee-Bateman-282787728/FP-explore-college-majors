Telling of the construction of a great Gothic cathedral in France during the high point of the era of faith, Cathedral interspaces live action shots set at Chartres and other notable Medieval sites, with affectionately drawn animation that lets us become eyewitnesses to the creation of a monumental work of architecture.

It is based on the book by the same name, but the marriage of animation, storyline and it's teaching of the Gothic Structures are amazing.  A very short video, but gives you a sense of the work that went into each cathedral.  I'll probably continue watching it because I never tire of it.My only grunt on this seems to be the transfer of the original to DVD.  It looks as though it was recorded from a projection and not a very good scan.  Perhaps they did not have the original film and this was a 2nd generation copy of video tape.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 5]","It's hard to envision a Gothic cathedral being built -- they are such soaring, exalted, complex buildings that they almost seem unreal.""Cathedral (1985) [Hosted by David Macaulay]"" takes away some of cathedrals' mystery, but it also does a great job explaining the structure, origins and culture behind them. And it's paired with a solid animated story describing a medieval cathedral being brought into existence, despite the odds stacked against it ever being finished.Half of the movie is devoted to David Macaulay touring through cathedrals, and talking about the way they were built, and the world that they were built in. So in other words, if you don't know what flying buttresses are for or how the weight is distributed, Macaulay will explain it to you. We're also told about the place of a cathedral in medieval cities, the artwork included both inside and outside, and even the tools that were required to construct it.It's a good way to learn the basics, especially since small animated depictions of what happened are included for some of the more complex parts of the cathedral. It's laid out in clear, well-spoken language that manages to convey its points without getting bogged down in jargon.There is also a fictional narrative that pops up between mini-lectures. It tells the story of a French town whose Notre Dame de Beaulieu is destroyed in a spectacular fire, and the only consolation is that a young monk is able to save a veil that supposedly belonged to the Blessed Virgin. He records the beginnings of construction on a new, bigger, seemingly impossible cathedral with ""heavy stone ceilings, walls of glass.""But then the local bishop dies, and a new, corrupt bishop insists on using rotten stone from his family's own quarries while pocketing money for himself. Soon a disaster strikes in the half-built cathedral, and the town is facing bankruptcy... and it will take a literal miracle to help them.The cartoon portion is what really keeps this show from being boring -- it's a compelling, low-key narrative with nicely realistic animation and some solid voice acting from Derek Jacobi and Brian Blessed. It also stops occasionally to have the characters explain to each other (usually to the monks chronicling its creation) the details of its making, such as the vaulted ceilings or how they cast church bells.It also has a stark feeling of realism, such as the decades that pass before the cathedral is actually finished. Several of the characters actually die -- by old age and accident -- before the story ends. But it also captures the fierce piety of medieval life, as well as the soaring spiritual uplift created by the cathedrals themselves.""Cathedral"" is an excellent homage to Gothic architecture, and a great way to find out just how these complex structures were created.

Cofield,"[1, 1]","When I was a high school history teacher one of the highlights of the year was always the day or so I set aside for David Macaulay's Cathedral.  A depiction of the construction of an imaginary Gothic Cathedral in 13th century Northern France, this is one of the most beautiful films PBS has ever made available for educational use, which is high praise indeed.David Macaulay's genius lies in his ability, both in words and highly detailed drawings, to clearly explain the process of building highly complex structures like cathedrals.  Accompanying that ability in Cathedral is a beautiful and dramatic story: the tale of Pierre, who chronicles the construction of the cathedral over the course of his long life, witnessing the coming and going of church officials and kings while the cathedral's towers rise slowly.  Pierre's story is told in beautifully drawn animation. Accompanying the animated sequences are some unforgettable segments in which Macaulay shows us around some Gothic cathedrals, explains their construction, and analyzes the symbolism in the stained glass, gargoyles, and statuary to be found in them.  The live action and animation blend together perfectly, assisted by beautiful and soaring music.It can be difficult to hold students' attention when showing a film, but I never had that problem with Cathedral or with any of Macaulay's other productions.",5,Marvelous History,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,1376,"['When', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'one', 'highlights', 'year', 'was', 'always', 'day', 'so', 'set', 'aside', 'David', 'Macaulay', 'Cathedral', 'depiction', 'construction', 'imaginary', 'Gothic', 'Cathedral', '13th', 'century', 'Northern', 'France', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', 'PBS', 'ever', 'made', 'available', 'educational', 'use', 'high', 'praise', 'indeed.David', 'Macaulay', 'genius', 'ability', 'words', 'highly', 'detailed', 'drawings', 'clearly', 'explain', 'process', 'building', 'highly', 'complex', 'structures', 'cathedrals', 'Accompanying', 'ability', 'Cathedral', 'beautiful', 'dramatic', 'story', 'tale', 'Pierre', 'who', 'construction', 'cathedral', 'course', 'long', 'life', 'witnessing', 'coming', 'going', 'church', 'officials', 'kings', 'cathedral', 'towers', 'rise', 'slowly', 'Pierre', 'story', 'told', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'animation', 'Accompanying', 'animated', 'sequences', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'segments', 'Macaulay', 'Gothic', 'cathedrals', 'construction', 'symbolism', 'stained', 'glass', 'gargoyles', 'statuary', 'be', 'found', 'live', 'action', 'animation', 'blend', 'together', 'perfectly', 'assisted', 'beautiful', 'soaring', 'music.It', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'hold', 'students', 'attention', 'when', 'showing', 'film', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'Cathedral', 'Macaulay', 'other', 'productions']",David Macaulay: Cathedral VHS

Firstly, it is a very detailed account of the purpose and development of the cathedral based around the account of a fictional cathedral construction project complete with a very dated (but wonderful) cartoon, interspersed with current (1983) on location examinations of cathedrals. The viewer will certainly gain an understanding of the social, economic and religious contexts of cathedrals in a light-hearted, amiable documentary.Secondly, this film's dated quality appeals greatly to my sense of nostalgia for my childhood. I was only 7 when I first saw ""Cathedral"" and it captivated my imagination with a sense of wonder about the days of old when monks and kings and maidens were not just the stuff of legend. It was the beginning of a lifetime's interest in the subjects of religion and medieval history. Everytime I watch it, I feel like I am reliving two histories- the days of the great cathedrals and my own childhood afternoons in the long and cold winters of Michigan.

To me these cathedrals represent the first stirrings of creative energy in medieval Europe after being shrouded in the Dark Ages for more than 700 years . This same energy and  love of learning and adventure spills over into  the Crusades and culminates in the Rennaissance .Finally I must mention the animations in this video which liven up some of the human interest stories that went into the construction of these cathedrals : they are cute but a bit overdone .
