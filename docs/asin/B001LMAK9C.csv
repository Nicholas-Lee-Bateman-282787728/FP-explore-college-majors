1215098,AER15RIMV8E6D,B001LMAK9C,Pumpkin Man,"[0, 0]","Look Who's Talking- I've loved this movie ever since I was a kid. Bruce Willis was hilarious as the voice of baby Mikey. Kirstie Alley stars as Mollie, an accountant who is pregnant with a married man's baby. While trying to get to the hospital for delivery, she takes James's taxi. James drives like a maniac trying to get her to the hospital. After Mollie gives birth to Mikey, James becomes more of a father-figure to him.  If you like cute baby movies, you'll love LOOK WHO'S TALKING!!!Look Who's Talking, Too- I've loved this movie ever since I was a kid. Bruce Willis and Roseanne Barr were hilarious as the voices of Mikey and Julie. Mollie and James are now married and are expecting a baby girl. Mikey wants to be a good big brother, but he finds Julie annoying. When their parents are out, Mollie's brother Stewart is babysitting and tries to stop a burglar, but the apartment catches on fire, and Mikey must step up and save his sister.

The story is built around small babies and their common sense thoughts about zany adult behavior. These thoughts are verbalized by Bruce Willis in the first movie and accompanied by Roseanne as the ""little sister"" in the second movie, Look Who's Talking, Too.The kids are ""too cute"" and and the situations are hilarious.
