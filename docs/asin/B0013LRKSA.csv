The title spoke to me as a black man though, plus I just thought it sounded interesting. This film has a good all-around cast. Talented and attractive black actors.I didn't think I'd really like it, and certainly didn't think I'd end up watching the entire fim like I ended up doing. To say most black films underwhelm me, would be an understatement. This is an interesting film with an interesting and good message though. Mainly talks about the idea of women marrying down, and where the church places in a spiritual/god-fearing couples marriage. Unfortunately I think the film left too many questions unasked and/or unanswered to truly be great. I think it's heart was in the right place though. Maybe should have been 30 minutes longer.

1143702,A2OKCS5234ZV7S,B0013LRKSA,Flower,"[0, 0]","Wow, this is a wonderful movie...  We loved the plot, we loved the characters and the scenes were awesome.. We watch this movie all the time and are very happy to own this movie..There is a need for more movies like this.. This was a great addition to our movie collection.If you are looking for a positive happy movie with comedy, drama and romance etc all in one this movie is for you. A wonderful love story to us..This is a good movies for couples night, or couples study groups, it shows what couples can go through when one's focus is not totally in the home, and one is being pulled in different ways. It also touches on how when couples begin to go in different directions.This will show you how someone can come in between you when you are not in communication with one another and on different pages with each other. Good men really are hard to find, this movie will also help single ladies and gentlemen to see what goes on in marriages and how marriages can become broken. We think married and singles should view this movie before they marry and after they marry.Now as far as the negative reviews, many children, teens of today look older than their parents.. They don't look as young as the children did who were born before the 80's. I don't know if it is the food we are eating, or the water we drink. We believe the son in this movie, played his role well.As far as the title, well good men are hard to find. Many people are looking for good men, when there is one standing right in front of them. Many people look for better things in other places instead of taking the time to look at home, many don't take the time to look at what they already have.This movie shows that message.. We think this movie delivered that message very well.. That is why so many homes are broken today, looking to greener pastures, only to find out it turns brown and is fake grass. Many people don't understand the dynamics children bring into a marriage.. and what about when people have children when they are young in high school and decide to marry and stay together, yeah they are young, their children may look older then them... There are many women and men who are old and you can't tell their age... They age well.Many people will be able to relate to this movie.. My co worker also viewed the movie and she loves it as well and she is single...As far as the son fighting his father,, no this happens for real.. you have rebellious children that fight there parents and anyone who will step in their way and if this movie can help rebellious children find their way, then yes it is priceless...More men should fight to keep their families together and put their children in their places.. Maybe we would not have so many rebellious children, which is the next generation to take place and run our country.. What is wrong with a father trying to place order in his home. Many marriages go through these types of test every single day... We love the message that this movie delivers.We will continue to share this movie with couples, other family members, friends and as many people as we can. This movie can be used as a teaching tool in so many different ways. Men can have a men's group watch. This is one way they can see how it looks when they neglect their wives.. This is one why for men and women to see that home comes first. etcSee this movie for your self and make your on judgement. We are telling you if you skip this movie, you will miss out..Cry, laugh, and be inspired....Enjoy....",5,Very Very Good Movie!,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,3503,"['Wow', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'loved', 'plot', 'loved', 'characters', 'scenes', 'were', 'awesome..', 'watch', 'movie', 'time', 'are', 'very', 'happy', 'own', 'movie..There', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'this..', 'was', 'great', 'addition', 'movie', 'collection.If', 'are', 'looking', 'positive', 'happy', 'movie', 'comedy', 'drama', 'romance', 'etc', 'one', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'love', 'story', 'us..This', 'good', 'movies', 'couples', 'night', 'couples', 'study', 'groups', 'what', 'couples', 'can', 'go', 'when', 'one', 'focus', 'not', 'totally', 'home', 'one', 'being', 'pulled', 'different', 'ways', 'also', 'how', 'when', 'begin', 'go', 'different', 'directions.This', 'will', 'show', 'how', 'someone', 'can', 'come', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'communication', 'one', 'different', 'pages', 'other', 'Good', 'men', 'really', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'movie', 'will', 'also', 'help', 'single', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'see', 'what', 'marriages', 'how', 'marriages', 'can', 'become', 'broken', 'think', 'married', 'singles', 'should', 'view', 'movie', 'marry', 'marry.Now', 'as', 'far', 'negative', 'reviews', 'many', 'children', 'teens', 'today', 'look', 'older', 'parents..', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'young', 'children', 'did', 'who', 'were', 'born', '80', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'food', 'are', 'eating', 'water', 'drink', 'believe', 'son', 'movie', 'played', 'role', 'well.As', 'far', 'title', 'well', 'good', 'men', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'men', 'when', 'one', 'standing', 'right', 'front', 'Many', 'people', 'look', 'better', 'things', 'other', 'places', 'instead', 'taking', 'time', 'look', 'home', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'look', 'what', 'already', 'have.This', 'movie', 'shows', 'message..', 'think', 'movie', 'delivered', 'message', 'very', 'well..', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'homes', 'are', 'broken', 'today', 'looking', 'greener', 'pastures', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'brown', 'fake', 'grass', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'dynamics', 'children', 'bring', 'marriage..', 'what', 'when', 'people', 'have', 'children', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'decide', 'marry', 'stay', 'together', 'yeah', 'are', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'look', 'older', 'then', 'are', 'many', 'women', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'age', 'age', 'well.Many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'movie..', 'My', 'co', 'worker', 'also', 'viewed', 'movie', 'well', 'single', 'As', 'far', 'son', 'fighting', 'father', 'real..', 'have', 'rebellious', 'children', 'fight', 'parents', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'step', 'way', 'movie', 'can', 'help', 'rebellious', 'children', 'find', 'way', 'then', 'yes', 'priceless', 'More', 'men', 'should', 'fight', 'keep', 'families', 'together', 'put', 'children', 'places..', 'Maybe', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'rebellious', 'children', 'next', 'generation', 'take', 'place', 'run', 'country..', 'What', 'wrong', 'father', 'trying', 'place', 'order', 'home', 'Many', 'marriages', 'go', 'types', 'test', 'single', 'day', 'love', 'message', 'movie', 'delivers.We', 'will', 'continue', 'share', 'movie', 'couples', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'teaching', 'tool', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'Men', 'can', 'have', 'men', 'group', 'watch', 'one', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'when', 'neglect', 'wives..', 'one', 'why', 'men', 'women', 'see', 'home', 'first', 'etcSee', 'movie', 'self', 'make', 'judgement', 'are', 'telling', 'skip', 'movie', 'will', 'miss', 'out..Cry', 'laugh', 'be', 'inspired', '.Enjoy']",A Good Man Is Hard to Find

Also, the title of the movie had nothing to do with its content. It should have been titled ""Boring Movie"" or ""Wasted Talent"".I gave this movie to the friend who suggested it. I hope she makes it a happy home because it would only be in my way and take up space.",1,RENT BEFORE BUYING!,1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,1129,"['made', 'mistake', 'buying', 'movie', ""'d"", 'seen', 'opened', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', 'store', 'Listening', 'friend', 'bought', 'movie', 'thinking', 'was', 'good', 'mean', 'look', 'good', 'actors', 'Good', 'Man', 'Hard', 'Find', '=', 'Good', 'Script', 'Hard', 'Find', 'movie', 'was', 'aimless', 'place', 'had', 'force', 'watch', 'Weak', 'weak', 'weak.First', 'son', 'was', 'older', 'were', 'remember', 'how', 'CubaGooding', 'Jr.', 'looked', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'Laurence', 'Fishbourne', 'son', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'Well', 'son', 'looked', 'was', 'late', '20', 'parents', 'looked', 'were', 'early', '30', 'so', 'obviously', 'had', 'when', 'were', 'six', 'making', 'biological', 'miracle.This', 'movie', 'slow', 'moving', 'had', 'poorly', 'written', 'scenes', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'strings', 'untied', 'there', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'talent', 'wasted', 'film', 'Also', 'title', 'movie', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'content', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'Boring', 'Movie', 'Wasted', 'Talent', '.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'friend', 'who', 'suggested', 'hope', 'happy', 'home', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'way', 'take', 'up', 'space']",A Good Man Is Hard to Find
