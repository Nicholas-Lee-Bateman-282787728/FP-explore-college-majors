1353716,ALK8POATE0HNN,B003LM2KYI,GrumpyGirl,"[1, 1]","The 3 Fast Miles is one of my favorite workouts and Fast Start 1 & 2 Miles are perfect if you need a shorter day or if you've taken time off and need to work back up to longer workouts. This is classic Leslie with a group of walkers, many originals. It loses a star based solely on the fact that at one point in the 3 mile, she asks Mary Kay to lead, but Mary Kay doesn't have a mike!

The 'Fast Start' 1&2 miles has some jogging, and it moves fairly quickly. My favorite is the 3 Fast Miles mile which has more variation; no jogging, but it does have some dancing which gets me moving.  Leslie looks great, and as always, her sincerity comes across to you. I was definitely sweating and felt great afterward. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a great workout that is easy on the joints.",5,"Good music, good variety.

1353719,A2BF2OUBWDGSZK,B003LM2KYI,TamarinaDC,"[4, 4]","So far, I have only done the 3-mile workout- but what a workout this is!  Make no mistake, it's pretty much the same Leslie we're all used to, so don't expect any surprising new moves.  However, one of the things I really like about this DVD is that she jumps right in at the beginning and starts the program without the explanations of what the steps are- it seems as if she expects that by the time you're doing a 3-mile workout, you know what a tap-out or a kickback is.  Also, the pace seems to be elevated in this one- the warm-up is more brisk than I've come to expect in Leslie's videos.  The one, straight-up GOOFY thing in this video comes towards the end when she has Mary Kay lead the exercises for a few minutes, but seemed to have forgotten that MK isn't miked.  And when I say not miked, I mean you cannot hear a word she's saying, and are reduced to lip-reading.  Granted that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what she wants you to do, but it seemed like a really strange thing to leave on the finished DVD.  This aside, I really like this video and plan to put it in regular rotation among my other Leslie favorites.",4,A Leslie Classic,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,1148,"['So', 'far', 'have', 'only', 'done', '3-mile', 'workout-', 'what', 'workout', 'Make', 'mistake', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'Leslie', ""'re"", 'used', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'surprising', 'new', 'moves', 'However', 'one', 'things', 'really', 'like', 'DVD', 'right', 'beginning', 'program', 'explanations', 'what', 'steps', 'are-', 'time', ""'re"", 'doing', '3-mile', 'workout', 'know', 'what', 'tap-out', 'kickback', 'Also', 'pace', 'be', 'elevated', 'one-', 'warm-up', 'more', 'brisk', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Leslie', 'videos', 'one', 'straight-up', 'GOOFY', 'thing', 'video', 'end', 'when', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'lead', 'exercises', 'few', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'have', 'forgotten', 'MK', ""n't"", 'miked', 'when', 'say', 'not', 'miked', 'mean', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'word', 'saying', 'are', 'reduced', 'lip-reading', 'Granted', ""n't"", 'take', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'seemed', 'really', 'strange', 'thing', 'leave', 'finished', 'DVD', 'aside', 'really', 'video', 'plan', 'put', 'regular', 'rotation', 'other', 'Leslie', 'favorites']",N/A
