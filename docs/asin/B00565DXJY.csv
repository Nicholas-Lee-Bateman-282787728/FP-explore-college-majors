Im using this as an intro to digraphs as part of the phonics curriculum ive set up.

We own every one, this being our latest addition.  He loves it so much I can use it as a bribe to come back inside, take a bath, brush his teeth, eat his veggies (do ______ and you can watch Meet the Phonics!).  After only a week or two of watching he is pointing our digraphs he sees in books, on signs, on graffiti, etc.  He prefers this one over the Meet the Phonics: Blends but he does like that one as well.  I kid you not, we will be doing a phonics themed birthday party in October if this keeps up.  My only complaint?

1443937,AE288THHEV7K,B00565DXJY,J. Kingbolin,"[4, 7]","My son recently turned four years old, and I have been a fan of the Meet the Sight Words DVDs and companion books for over a year. ((A little background, I began using Baby Einstein and Baby Bumblebee DVDs at a very early age since my son stays with me at home while I telecommute for work. I then progressed to the LeapFrog videos and have since moved him on to the ""Meet The___"" series))Our son was already reading but was having trouble with words which can not obviously be worked out using letter sounds such as where (which may be appear to sound like 'wuh-here') or phonics (which could be sounded out as 'puh-honics') The Digraphs DVD is perfect for explaining these words where two letters make a single sound. If you haven't watched the series before, the creators makes characters of the letters they are teaching such as a CH appearing as a chef eating chocolate chips. This series does a great job of reinforcing the appearance of the letters with the sounds used in pronouncing the associated word(s). My only issue with this particular DVD was the use of a Gnu (a type of Wildebeest) as an example for the GN sound when I think something such as a Gnat may be more common to most kids. Again, kinda picky and not a deal breaker.This is another great DVD in the ""Meet The ___"" series, and I highly recommend it as well as the other DVDs.",4,"Another great ""Meet The....""
