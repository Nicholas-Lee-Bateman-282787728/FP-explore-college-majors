708884,A1WXO8YNBB6UD7,B00006ADFP,"Andrew Finch ""alwaysnow""","[6, 9]","Given the low-budget ethos of this film, it succeeds in being interesting and deep, in terms of social relationships and social issues. Rather than the heavy musical cues and editing that guide us through a Hollywood movie, this film takes us gently and realistically into the lives of 6 people who try to work out their problems by interacting with others, some of whom just happen to be in the local council Italian class.We get a realistic view of Dutch society in this film, along with the problems that people in that society encounter. This sort of everyday cultural information does not appear in the usual cinema event. As the problems develop into temporary solutions, we get close to the characters, and identify them as normal people, looking for understanding and companionship.The Italian lessons are a link rather than a major part of the film. They are the almost accidental meeting point of the characters, and lead to the visit to Vienna which occurs at the end. In this setting, solutions appear, and we leave the characters in peace.As with many comedies, this film has a deeper social message about the lives and conditions of the participants. It's nice to join them in an investigation of the human condition that is not dictated by heavyweight stars and huge, commercially-financed budgets.",5,Interesting and deep,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,1313,"['Given', 'low-budget', 'ethos', 'film', 'being', 'interesting', 'deep', 'terms', 'social', 'relationships', 'social', 'issues', 'Rather', 'heavy', 'musical', 'cues', 'editing', 'guide', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'film', 'gently', 'realistically', 'lives', '6', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'work', 'out', 'problems', 'interacting', 'others', 'whom', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'local', 'council', 'Italian', 'class.We', 'get', 'realistic', 'view', 'Dutch', 'society', 'film', 'problems', 'people', 'society', 'encounter', 'sort', 'everyday', 'cultural', 'information', 'not', 'appear', 'usual', 'cinema', 'event', 'problems', 'develop', 'temporary', 'solutions', 'get', 'close', 'characters', 'identify', 'normal', 'people', 'looking', 'understanding', 'companionship.The', 'Italian', 'lessons', 'are', 'link', 'rather', 'major', 'part', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'accidental', 'meeting', 'point', 'characters', 'lead', 'visit', 'Vienna', 'end', 'setting', 'solutions', 'appear', 'leave', 'characters', 'peace.As', 'many', 'comedies', 'film', 'deeper', 'social', 'message', 'lives', 'conditions', 'participants', 'nice', 'join', 'investigation', 'human', 'condition', 'not', 'dictated', 'heavyweight', 'stars', 'huge', 'commercially-financed', 'budgets']",Italian for Beginners

The coverbox here - sexy female legs in an exotically supine position - is both misleading and insulting. This movie spends 92%+ of its time in a provincial Danish town. The subjects are death, loneliness, and breaking out of that loneliness via tentatively made connections. It's a brilliantly done movie by Dogme 95 adherent Lone Scherfig. Consider it 'von Trier light,' but that cover box is bound to set up some for disappointment.The Dogme style gives you a freshness you don't see in many Hollywood movies. In fact, 'Italian for Beginners' could almost pass for a home video (albeit one recorded by your Danish relatives).For you Dogme fans:- Pastor 'Andreas' is Anders Berthelsen, who played lead Kresten so memorably in 'Mifune.'- Stadium restaurant manager Halfinn is 'Mifune' star Iben Hjejle's live-in partner.- Ann Eleonora Jorgensen as Karen is - other than this movie - unknown to American audiences.

I am a big fan of foreign films and own a lot of them, so at a cheap price of $5 i picked up this title. I didn't really read up on it (like i should have) but figured it would be good for something. It sadly really wasn't. The back of the case (description) claims this movie to be a ""heart-warming romantic comedy"" and i didn't think it was either of those things. And i know romance or comedy or romantic comedy when i see it - and i just didn't think it excelled in either. I hate to be so negative on a movie (not film, mind you - the ""Dogma 95, shot-on-8mm"" is actually kinda lame) but i was disappointed. As another reviewer said ""I miss REAL cinematography"". The acting was nothing special, and i actually didn't really get into the characters at all - the restaurant owner/second Italian teacher guy was really annoying and a jerk, but i liked the relationship between the Italian girl and Jorgenson(?) - it reminded me of the Portuguese girl's story in ""Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)"" (which is a much better film). Also, if one has read the description, they are led to believe that most of the movie (or at least the parts where they ""discover passion and love"") takes place in Italy, when they are actually only in Italy for about 10 minutes at the end.

Apparently, the movement--with its emphasis on natural lighting, hand held cameras and an avoidance of other cinematic conventions that make for slick cinema--has any number of detractors (and only a few ardent supporters).  After viewing this film, I can see why.ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS has a lot going for it.  The cast is attractive and talented.  The script is solid--the dialog natural, the plot a bit rambling and contrived in spots but certainly plausible.  The film addresses weighty themes (love and death, the weightiest of all) without becoming Nordically depressive.  It has a lightness of touch that is,  from all that I've read about Dogme, pretty unusual for the genre.Called me spoiled, but I miss good cinematography.  Proponents of this apparent Dogme-tic rough, unpolished look will probably justify the movie's primitive quality as &quot;honest&quot; or &quot;authentic.&quot;  I just think it looks like TV, low budget TV at that.  I notice one reviewer here referred to the film as a soap opera, and while he may have been talking plotline (and maybe it is a little on the soapy side, though not egregiously), he might just as well have been talking visuals.Or you might compare it to an old Andy Warhol flick, one of those &quot;artlessness as art&quot; Paul Morrissey vehicles.

They include:* A recently widowed pastor, whose wife had suffered from schizophrenia. He becomes the acting pastor at a local church because the elderly minister has been alienating his parishioners.* A hotel clerk who provides the minister with temporary quarters. Our shy clerk has a massive crush on a lovely young Italian woman who works in the hotel kitchen.* A blunt young man whose bad-tempered attacks on dining room patrons jeopardizes his job in the hotel restaurant.* A loyal young woman who quits the hotel kitchen when her cranky friend is fired.* A clumsy young woman who works in a bakery; her hateful father is housebound, demanding and verbally abusive.* A young hairdresser who cares for her terminally ill mother while running her own modest salon.A small class in Conversational Italian forms at an adult education center; for one reason or another, all of our cast shows up. We get to watch their progress and see their reward.Expect humor, pathos, generosity of spirit, romance, courage and humanity. Can we ask for anything more?",4,A Cliche-Ridden Joy,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,1481,"['Here', 'charming', 'R-rated', 'Danish', 'film', 'year', '2000', 'Italiensk', 'begyndere', 'English', 'captions', 'film', 'was', 'honored', 'film', 'festivals', 'Europe', 'United', 'States', 'adult', 'themes', 'e.g.', 'impotence', 'fetal', 'alcohol', 'syndrome', 'aging', 'abusive', 'parents', 'yet', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'DVD', 'again', 'Amazon', 'huge', 'smile', 'face.We', 'are', 'Danish', 'town', 'where', 'meet', 'small', 'cast', 'characters', 'include', '*', 'recently', 'widowed', 'pastor', 'wife', 'had', 'suffered', 'schizophrenia', 'acting', 'pastor', 'local', 'church', 'elderly', 'minister', 'been', 'alienating', 'parishioners', '*', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'who', 'minister', 'temporary', 'quarters', 'shy', 'clerk', 'massive', 'crush', 'lovely', 'young', 'Italian', 'woman', 'who', 'hotel', 'kitchen', '*', 'blunt', 'young', 'man', 'bad-tempered', 'attacks', 'dining', 'room', 'patrons', 'job', 'hotel', 'restaurant', '*', 'A', 'loyal', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'hotel', 'kitchen', 'when', 'cranky', 'friend', 'fired', '*', 'A', 'clumsy', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'bakery', 'hateful', 'father', 'housebound', 'demanding', 'verbally', 'abusive', '*', 'young', 'hairdresser', 'who', 'terminally', 'ill', 'running', 'own', 'modest', 'salon.A', 'small', 'class', 'Conversational', 'Italian', 'forms', 'adult', 'education', 'center', 'one', 'reason', 'cast', 'up', 'get', 'watch', 'progress', 'see', 'reward.Expect', 'humor', 'pathos', 'generosity', 'spirit', 'romance', 'courage', 'humanity', 'Can', 'ask', 'anything', 'more']",Italian for Beginners

It was apparently shot largely with a hand-held camera, and reminded me of a home movie, albeit one of better image quality.In this film, the audience follows the daily lives of six lonely singles. Olympia is a bakery employee with low self-esteem whose parents die within a short time of each other. Hal-Finn is a testy restaurant manager fired for verbally abusing customers. Giulia, an Italian immigrant speaking little Danish who dreams of finding Mr. Wonderful, is a waitress at Hal-Finn's restaurant. Jorgen is a sexually impotent hotel clerk, who's afraid he'll never again be able to have an intimate relationship with a woman. Jorgen confides in Andreas, the temporary pastor at the local church, who's finding it difficult being accepted by the congregation. Finally, Karen the hairdresser loyally visits her hospitalized mother, who soon dies.During that part of the plot shot in Denmark, we see very little of the outdoors. We don't even know the name of the city or town. Almost all the ""action"" occurs indoors, and eventually is focused in a community adult education class, ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS, to which all of the characters have gravitated (for reasons beyond me). Very soon, the instructor is physically incapacitated and disappears from the storyline. Already knowing more Italian than the others, Hal-Finn takes over the teaching role. In the meantime, attraction between individuals is germinating.This film is not without charm, but most of that occurs in the last 20 minutes or so (of the 112 minute run time) when the location switches to Venice, Italy. Otherwise, it's as if you yourself took a video cam, followed some unmarried buds around with it for a couple of weeks, and then sold the tape to a major studio. It's not a bad or unenjoyable picture, but I'm just amazed that it was made for the Big Screen. All of the characters inspire good feelings, even the prickly Hal-Finn. Indeed, Giulia is pretty darn cute. And there's an unexpected twist involving Olympia and Karen that would make anyone's day interesting.

I didn't mind much expect the person filming couldn't even keep the people upright when they were standing! The space was so limited in one of the character's business that she was always shown at a 45 degree angle.  Likewise, the places where the characters were shot were obviously extremely inexpensive or free.  Usually, if the storyline is good, I can overlook its low budget.However, the film was a bit depressing, most are facing their midlife crisis, while you have to give the characters credit for trying something new to change their life.  The pace of the story was really slow.  I thought that I had seen it before after nearly an hour of watching, I realized I was as unimpressed this time as the first I'd seen it.  At that point, I stopped watching as I remember thinking the first time around, it is going to improve but I felt that it didn't justify anymore of my time so I quit.The characters all have hardships particularly with two women dealing with abusive aging parents that was way to real for me and I found distracting.  This was what tipped me from ""it was okay"" to ""stick a fork in me, I'm done"".  I liked that these were all ordinary individuals, who wanted to work for a better situation.There were a few funny scenes and if you don't mind a slower pace and reading a translation that doesn't always seem to capture the essence of what was said.  I enjoyed the dialogue in the restaurant but it was unrealistic.

You get over it fast enough though because the script and characters really are able to draw you in.  Perhaps this 'home-movie' feel was done on purpose (or mabey all Dutch films ar so low-budget) because it makes the entire movie seem so much more viceral and real; you'll feel almost voyeuristic watching it.  The story centers around seven (ending up with nine) people who take an Italian class together, and all the drama and humor that follow them.  I found this film uproriously funny, not so much at the script, but at the film making (the way they show the final credits is priceless).  The script is, however, quite well done.  The humor is very believeable, but not the kind that makes you cringe like so many American films do (&quot;rushmore&quot; is a perfect example of cringe-humor).It only got four stars from me because it lacked much new insight into relationships.  The characters all found eachother it the same traditional way that most characters in romances do.

The great accomplishment of the film's director, Lone Scherfig, is her ability to transfer very specifically Danish cultural aspects to a broader audience.

Intellectually, it is closer to a dessert than a main course, but all desserts are not equal. You'll fondly remember this one. Like most romantic movies, its plot is rather farfetched. Its characters, though, are down to earth and believable - ordinary people trying to make their way through life's ups and downs with a little dignity.In a small Danish city, six people find their lives in disarray for various reasons - two are caring for aged, ungrateful parents, one has recently lost his wife, another is about to lose his job, etc. They are not so much hopeless as they are desperate for hope. Their lives intersect in unexpected ways in an unlikely setting - a course in Italian at a local school.Compared to its American counterparts, ""Italian for Beginners"" a small, sparse movie.

So the critics said, the advertising and even the reviews in different web pages state it.Well, I disagree.This film is enticing, stirring, endearing... whatever, but comedy?The story is about six people.There is a young pastor stepping into a parish to temporarily substitute an obstinate and aggressive suspended titular; a good looking mid-thirty hairstylist with an intruding alcoholic mother; a pleasant hotel receptionist and his friend, usually angry, in charge of a bar; a lovely Italian kitchen-maid and last but not least a blundering young bakery employee.This six go around with their lives in a little Danish town and will be, little by little, entangled one with the other.All of them bear an internal pain or lose, all of them are in deep need of affection and care, all of them will discover love by strange and tangled paths.There are comic moments in the film but nearly all of them are shadowed by some mishap, including death.Director Lone Scherfig adheres to Dogma95 ascetic principles: no musical score, natural light, hand-held cameras are three of the ten premises; working within this background she manages to deliver a small oeuvre d'art that will leave the viewer deeply moved.The cast, unknown actors and actresses for me, give an above standard performance.

There are no secrets here, just ""unknowns"" that naturally exist between strangers/acquaintances. We learn about the characters as they reveal themselves to each other.

708912,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00006ADFP,Ping Lim,"[6, 9]","I was lukewarm towards this movie in Movie Festival few years back because it's a Danish movie (Danish and Italians are simply mutually exclusive, in my humble opinion) and secondly, it's a Dogme movie: the kind of projects that are stripped to the bare essentials and the movies are to be seen on their artistic merits and not because of ""noises"" such as SFX, sound, clever editing and so forth.  Therefore, excellence was emphasised upon the talent and courage of the actors and actresses.  At times, art movies were not cohesive and that they were there to shock, to challenge, to conjure an experience for the viewers.  After much consideration, I flagged it until few days ago, when I decided to give it a chance.  It's quite surreal to see a movie that's made using cam-cameras and that it felt documentary-ish.  Somehow, it pulled off neatly.  The movie started in fractures: a clumsy baker who tended to an abusive father, a lonely hairdresser that got bothered by her alcoholic mother, a new priest who started a congregation whose wife had just died (of horrible circumstance), a restaurant owner that had a chip on his shoulder, a dull but good-natured hotel manager that was looking for his elusive other half, and Guiliana (the Italian girl).  Whilst their lives were less than fulfilled, they found solace and comfort in their Italian class.  As it progressed, they also found friendship, strength and encouragement from that tight-knit group.  Guiliana, the Italian girl seemed to be a metaphor to have all those characters intertwined and the finale ended appropriately at Italy, at the doorsteps of Venice as they ridded of their demons.  Yes, I got a huge grin on my face with a huge sigh of satisfaction.  It's really that good.  It's been long time coming to have a movie that unfolded slowly and yet, so effective.  There's a short story in the extras, references (CV)of the main actors and actresses, and other standard technical stuff.

It is Danish independent movie and it starts a little bit awkward.  Directing feels as if someone was making a home-made movie, rather than a film.  But if you can get over that, and just keep watching the movie, you will find it to be delightful.  It is a story about people in a small Danish town.  They are all lonely and enduring loss of people close to them (parents, spouses, etc.).  In spite of the fact that the relationships of our main characters with the people they are loosing is far from perfect, they genuinely miss the people they have lost and grieve deeply.  As life goes on, so does their desire to redefine themselves and find a new purpose.  They start taking italian language classes at the local community center.  It is the weekly classes and the comeraderie that helps them create their own sort of support group.  All characters are well defined and their personal story is touching.  What I found a little annoying about the film is the fact that by making the characters not too smart is somehow comedic.  The story is great and i would recommend anyone to watch this film.

708914,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00006ADFP,Reviewer,"[15, 35]","Back in the early `90s, when I was tooling about making home movies as a lark, and NEVER taking any of it seriously, I had NO idea that I had actually stumbled upon a method of filmmaking that very soon would be touted as THE method of the true, bona fide ""auteur"" (or, more accurately according to the tenets of the ""method"" used in this film, the ""ANTI-auteur""), and that one day I would be watching ""Italian for Beginners,"" directed by (well, credit for the directing cannot be given, as it would be against the ""rules,"" which I will get to in a moment) and filmed in much the same-- in fact, the EXACT same-- style that I had employed back in what I now know were MY ""auteur"" (excuse me; my ""ANTI-auteur"") days.  But having watched this film, the evidence is irrefutable; I know, because I've just finished watching the movies I shot back then with my trusty camcorder to get a comparison.  And all I can say now is:  ""STAND ASIDE AND GIVE ME ROOM-- I'M ON MY WAY TO SUNDANCE!""In 1995, Danish filmmakers Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg developed a new (?) filmmaking technique, for which they co-wrote a back-to-basics guide entitled ""Dogma 95,"" a manifesto for filmmakers who, by adhering to the rules set forth in the text, would become a part of the ""newest"" new wave to hit the industry, subsequently referred to as the ""Cinema of Poverty,"" and with good reason.If you're thinking of giving this film a go, before you watch it you MUST know something about Dogma 95 to have a chance in the hot place of making it through to the end.  There are ten ""rules"" set forth in the manifesto, as well as an addendum, a handful of items tacked on (afterthoughts?), such as ""I am no longer an artist"" (which after watching this film I fully understand and agree with).  But the main things (rules) you must know going in are these:  The movie must be filmed on location, with only a hand-held camera and using only whatever light is naturally available.  And ""music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.""  (Somewhat contradictorily, two of Von Trier's subsequent films were musicals; his disclaimer:  ""The rules are not meant to `limit' creativity, but to `spur it on').  Rule #10 states:  ""The director must not be credited.""  In retrospect, the wisdom of THIS rule is beyond reproach.There IS some substance to this story, imbued as it is with elements of classic Bergman as it examines ""loss"" on a number of levels through the lives of a small, diverse group of individuals in various stages of disenfranchisement.  Their common denominator is the class in, well...Italian for beginners, to which they seemingly gravitate, each with their own specific reasons and motivations.  The class becomes a kind of focal point for them; it is here that relationships are formed or honed, and their lives begin to intersect.  Now, had only Bergman been on hand to direct them.These are everyday folks, just going about the business of living; and quite frankly, they aren't all that interesting, nor are their respective stories.  The group includes Hal-Finn (Lars Kaalund), an obnoxious restaurant employee who hasn't as yet caught on to the ""customer/employee"" dynamic-- he's self-absorbed, rude and insufferable; Jorgen (Peter Gantzler) lacks self confidence; Karen (Ann Eleonora Jorgensen) a hairdresser who never seems to be able to finish a client (Hal-Finn is in her chair at least three times, but never gets past the hair-wetting phase before some crisis or other calls Karen away, sending poor Hal-Finn away each time with a wet head and no haircut); Olympia (Anette Stovelbaek) who works in a bakery, where no doubt she sells danish (pun intended; I have nothing to lose at this point); and Andreas (Anders W. Berthelsen), a pastor who has taken a temporary assignment six months after the death of his wife.  But listening to the thoughts (and I intentionally do not use the term ""ideas"" here) of a randomly selected group of postal employees on the dock at 3 a.m. at the post office would be intrinsically more interesting than anything that occurs in this film.  Berthelsen, especially, spends the entire movie looking confused, like he's a contestant on Jeopardy! but can't figure out why Alex keeps giving him the answers instead of the questions.  Or maybe he's just trying to understand what he's doing in this film to begin with.  Where, oh where, is Ingmar when you need him?On a positive note, the performances here are for the most part quite natural, if not engaging.  Kaalund, at least, makes a lasting impression with a character reminiscent of Rutger Hauer's Eric Vonk in ""Turkish Delight"" (aka ""Turk's Fruit""), from 1973; perhaps that's why Hal-Finn is always getting in ""Dutch"" with his boss (again, pun intended).The supporting cast includes Sara Indrio Jensen (Giulia), Jesper Christensen (Olympia's Father), Lene Tiemroth (Karen's Mother) and Carlo Barsotti (Marcello).  There are those who are going to like, even applaud, this film; personally, I'd rather watch paint dry.  To connect with this film one has to be able to embrace, or at least get beyond, the whole Dogma 95 thing.  I couldn't.  Okay, perhaps I just don't ""get"" it; to this day I still don't get the Andy Warhol ""soup can"" deal, either.  Just know that ""Italian for Beginners"" is definitely NOT going to be for everyone.  I do find it interesting that the ""rules"" are also referred to as the filmmakers ""Vows of chastity,"" and that in reviews of Dogma 95 films the terms ""chaste,"" ""austere"" and ""pure"" always seem to surface.  In the great scheme of things I know it means something; what it is, I don't know.  But bear in mind that the manifesto also states, ""Furthermore I swear as a director to refrain from personal taste!""  And with that, I rest my case.",1,Watching Paint Dry for Beginners,1039219200,"12 7, 2002",2002,5780,"['Back', 'early', '90s', 'when', 'was', 'tooling', 'making', 'home', 'movies', 'lark', 'NEVER',

The first thing that surprised me was that the movie was created using handheld cameras and natural light, but it took me not time at all to get used to it, and the excellent story, together with the inspired acting, enthralled me until the ending titles.Andreas (Berthelsen) is a pastor that arrives at a small Danish town to replace an old a stubborn colleague that has been suspended from his chores. Andreas lost his wife a short while ago, and is having a difficult time coping with this; now he is trying to get used to this new life and reconstruct what was shattered in the recent past. In this small town he meets a fascinating set of characters, all of them with personal problems, dreams and fears, and the relationship among all these people is what makes this one of the best movies in the last few years.Finn (Kaalund) is the manager of the restaurant located in the soccer stadium of the town, and he has a ""small"" attitude problem that usually ends up with the customers being mistreated and expelled from the establishment. That is why Jorgen (Gantzler), Finn's best friend, is forced by management to fire him, which is no easy task. Besides the three men, the cast incorporates Karen (Jorgensen), a hairdresser with an alcoholic mother, Olympia, a clumsy woman who works at a bakery, and Giulia, a beautiful waitress that only speaks Italian.All these characters converge, lead by different reasons, in an Italian class. In that place, they can be themselves and as each one of them starts coming out of their shell they learn the value of those things that are important in life. One of the main strengths of this film has to do precisely with how it spends considerable time showing us the feelings each character experiences and the interaction among these people, through precise and insightful dialogues.This is one of those movies that prove that you do not need a huge budget to produce a film of excellent quality. What you do need is a great script, with actors that understand what they are supposed to do; the rest comes naturally. I am very happy to recommend this movie, and I am already trying to find more Danish films so I can verify if they follow the same pattern as this one in terms of excellence.",5,"""I am used to being alone""",1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,2366,"['usually', 'watch', 'lot', 'foreign', 'films', 'recall', 'correctly', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'experienced', 'Danish', 'production', 'first', 'thing', 'surprised', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'using', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'natural', 'light', 'took', 'not', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'excellent', 'story', 'together', 'inspired', 'acting', 'enthralled', 'ending', 'titles.Andreas', 'Berthelsen', 'pastor', 'small', 'Danish', 'town', 'replace', 'old', 'stubborn', 'colleague', 'been', 'suspended', 'chores', 'Andreas', 'lost', 'wife', 'short', 'while', 'ago', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'coping', 'now', 'trying', 'get', 'used', 'new', 'life', 'reconstruct', 'what', 'was', 'shattered', 'recent', 'past', 'small', 'town', 'fascinating', 'set', 'characters', 'personal', 'problems', 'dreams', 'fears', 'relationship', 'people', 'what', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'years.Finn', 'Kaalund', 'manager', 'restaurant', 'located', 'soccer', 'stadium', 'town', 'small', 'attitude', 'problem', 'usually', 'up', 'customers', 'being', 'mistreated', 'expelled', 'establishment', 'why', 'Jorgen', 'Gantzler', 'Finn', 'best', 'friend', 'forced', 'management', 'fire', 'easy', 'task', 'three', 'men', 'cast', 'Karen', 'Jorgensen', 'hairdresser', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Olympia', 'clumsy', 'woman', 'who', 'bakery', 'Giulia', 'beautiful', 'waitress', 'only', 'Italian.All', 'characters', 'converge', 'lead', 'different', 'reasons', 'Italian', 'class', 'place', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'coming', 'shell', 'learn', 'value', 'things', 'are', 'important', 'life', 'One', 'main', 'strengths', 'film', 'do', 'precisely', 'how', 'considerable', 'time', 'showing', 'feelings', 'character', 'experiences', 'interaction', 'people', 'precise', 'insightful', 'dialogues.This', 'one', 'movies', 'prove', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'huge', 'budget', 'produce', 'film', 'excellent', 'quality', 'What', 'do', 'need', 'great', 'script', 'actors', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'rest', 'naturally', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'recommend', 'movie', 'am', 'already', 'trying', 'find', 'more', 'Danish', 'films', 'can', 'verify', 'follow', 'same', 'pattern', 'one', 'terms', 'excellence']",Italian for Beginners
708916,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00006ADFP,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 6]","In spite of the title, &quot;Italian for Beginners&quot; features few Italian scenes, for it is set in a small town in Denmark, where men and women (all thirty-odd-year-old) fall in love through the language course.  The film is the 12th installment of Dogme 95 (its predecessors include &quot;King Is Alive&quot; or &quot;Mifune&quot;), but unlike the usual films coming out of the tradition, &quot;Italian Beginners&quot; is a heart-warming romantic comedy, or at least, it wants to be that.The ensemble characters are all timid or have some trouble with communication (perhaps making a contrast to Italian people).  They include; an angry manager of a small diner (who had once a promising career as football player), and his good-natured friend; a hairdresser whose alcoholic mother always stumbles into her shop in the awkward moment; a Catholic priest who is sent to the town for a thankless position; a female working at bakery store who had to change jobs more than 30 times; and a beautiful Italian waitress who fell for one of them.Even though you like the film's life-affirming attitudes, you must admit that the story itself is nothing but an ordinary melodrama, which in itself is not a big problem.  I am not sure this film works as comedy in your country (I didn't find it as amusing as some people say), but it defenitely works as an intensely emotional drama.  The film has its strong moments (such as ill-treated daughter(s) confronting their parents), because the capable actors succeeded to infuse a lot of energy to the well-written, but slightly cliched characters.I didn't give the film four stars because of the followinf two reasons: one, it lacks charms that should have, the kind of charms which the dogmatic stance of Dogme 95 destroyed.  Dogme basically forbids to use soundtrack songs, or lighting (except one attached to camera), both of which are (few people notice this) the essential part of the romanctic mood.  The actors' fine acting cannot save it totally.The other defect comes from the film's script.  I don't know about Lone Sherfig (writer and director of the film), but it is clear that her roots lie in TV dramas, in which she can let the drama sprawl more freely.  The film runs 112 minutes, but with this thin material, the whole film is often repetitive, longer than it should be by 15 minutes.But all in all &quot;Italian for Beginners&quot; is a good film, by &quot;good&quot; I mean &quot;warm&quot; &quot;engaging&quot; and &quot;charming.&quot;  But I still do not understand why Ms. Sherfig, with these able cast at hand, decided to use the Dogme format, which does not help the film at all.",3,Romance ala Dogme;Overlong Plot Saved by Charming Characters,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,2644,"['spite', 'title', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Beginners', 'quot', 'features', 'few', 'Italian', 'scenes', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'Denmark', 'where', 'men', 'women', 'thirty-odd-year-old', 'fall', 'love', 'language', 'course', 'film', '12th', 'installment', 'Dogme', '95', 'predecessors', 'include', 'quot', 'King', 'Is', 'Alive', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mifune', 'quot', 'usual', 'films', 'coming', 'tradition', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Beginners', 'quot', 'heart-warming', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'least', 'be', 'that.The', 'ensemble', 'characters', 'are', 'timid', 'have', 'trouble', 'communication', 'perhaps', 'making', 'contrast', 'Italian', 'people', 'include', 'angry', 'manager', 'small', 'diner', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'promising', 'career', 'football', 'player', 'good-natured', 'friend', 'hairdresser', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'always', 'shop', 'awkward', 'moment', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'who', 'sent', 'town', 'thankless', 'position', 'female', 'working', 'bakery', 'store', 'who', 'had', 'change', 'jobs', 'more', '30', 'times', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'waitress', 'who', 'fell', 'one', 'them.Even', 'like', 'film', 'life-affirming', 'attitudes', 'must', 'admit', 'story', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'melodrama', 'not', 'big', 'problem', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'comedy', 'country', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'as', 'amusing', 'people', 'say', 'defenitely', 'intensely', 'emotional', 'drama', 'film', 'strong', 'moments', 'such', 'ill-treated', 'daughter', 'confronting', 'parents', 'capable', 'actors', 'succeeded', 'infuse', 'lot', 'energy', 'well-written', 'slightly', 'cliched', 'characters.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'followinf', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'charms', 'should', 'have', 'kind', 'charms', 'dogmatic', 'stance', 'Dogme', '95', 'destroyed', 'Dogme', 'basically', 'use', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'lighting', 'one', 'attached', 'camera', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'notice', 'essential', 'part', 'romanctic', 'mood', 'actors', 'fine', 'acting', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'totally.The', 'other', 'defect', 'film', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Lone', 'Sherfig', 'writer', 'director', 'film', 'clear', 'roots', 'lie', 'TV', 'dramas', 'can', 'let', 'drama', 'sprawl', 'more', 'freely', 'film', '112', 'minutes', 'thin', 'material', 'whole', 'film', 'often', 'repetitive', 'longer', 'should', 'be', '15', 'minutes.But', 'quot', 'Italian', 'Beginners', 'quot', 'good', 'film', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'mean', 'quot', 'warm', 'quot', 'quot', 'engaging', 'quot', 'quot', 'charming.', 'quot', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'Ms.', 'Sherfig', 'able', 'cast', 'hand', 'decided', 'use', 'Dogme', 'format', 'not', 'help', 'film']",Italian for Beginners
