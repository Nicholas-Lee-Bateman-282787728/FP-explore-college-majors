It has some of my favorite actors: Clive Owens and even Gillian Anderson (her tiny part really disappointed me) since she barely appeared.  But aside from that, the movie lacked the right connections for the viewer to make sense of what is the tragic conflict between England and Ireland.  How did the MI5 guys know exactly what door the Irish mole was going to come out of, for example.  We know the year and place of the story's beginnings: Belfast 1963 followed by London 1993, but after that the transition is unexplained.  Where were we?  London or Belfast?  Well, you get my point.

1638064,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BSVSSM2,Grady Harp,"[8, 11]","SHADOW DANCER (definition: a dance presented by casting shadows of dancers on a screen) is another film about the conflicts of the IRA during the 1990s. Despite the fact that the theme is a recurring one in films, the core meaning of the conflict remains a bewildering mystery to those not living in Ireland or in England, and that is what makes this film fall short of being excellent  - there is much significant information that is not shared with the audience as though we all understand fully both sides of the conflict well enough to muddle through the outlines of the plot that are presented. Tom Brady wrote screenplay based on his own novel and even director James Marsh can't seem to iron it out into a comprehensible story.The film opens in 1973 in Belfast when young Collette (Maria Laird) is asked by her father to run an errand but she is far more interested in making bead necklaces so she sends her younger brother Sean (Ben Smyth) who is killed outside their home. Jump to 1993 and Collette (Andrea Riseborough), mother of a young son, has become a mole (`tout') for the IRA, and is arrested in the London tube after leaving a bomb in the facility. MI5 (definition: Military Intelligence section 5 is a British intelligence agency working to protect the UK's national security against threats such as terrorism and espionage) Agent Mac (Clive Owen) offers a deal to Collette to become an informer. She accepts the agreement to protect her son and in return Mac offers a new identity to her after a period working for the MI5. Soon Mac learns that his superior Kate Fletcher (Gillian Anderson) is using Collette to protect her mole inside the Irish organization. Mac tries to find the identity of the informer and protect Collette. In the midst of all of this Collette's brothers Connor (Domhnall Gleeson) and Gerry (Aidan Gillen) and their mother (Brid Brennan) become targets for both sides. In the end the true informer is a surprise to everyone and the film documents the impact of terrorism on family and its human cost.&#8232;Though there are moments of fine acting, the entire movie seems as though it was shot in a fog: the focus is as blurry as the action. If the audience is completely familiar with the IRA vs. MI5 conflicts, then the film will likely appeal. Otherwise, read up about Irish politics before attempting to understand all the nuances in this film.

1638068,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00BSVSSM2,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","""Shadow Dancer"" is based on the novel of the same name by Tom Bradby, who also wrote the movie. James Marsh, best known for his work as a documentary filmmaker, directs. In 1993, Irish Republican Colette McVeigh (Andre Riseborough) is captured by MI5 after she plants a bomb in a London subway station. An MI5 agent whom she knows only as ""Mac"" (Clive Owen) offers Colette a deal she can't refuse. Either she becomes an informant, spying on her IRA activist brothers, or she goes to prison for 25 years, and her young son (Cathal Maguire) will be taken into public care. The decision is made all the more difficult, because, if Colette is discovered as an informant, she will be murdered, also leaving her son motherless. She acquiesces, and Mac sets out to manage his new recruit but begins to suspect that his colleagues at MI5 have a different agenda.Tom Bradby was a journalist in Northern Ireland during the time this film takes place, as ""the Troubles"" were winding down and a peace process was beginning. The film, however, is less about politics than it is about two people facing moral conundrums that are impossible to solve satisfactorily. Both are lonely and isolated, by their dilemmas, from groups of which they are supposed to be an integral part: Colette from her family and Mac from his law enforcement colleagues. Colette comes from an IRA family and is expected to take up her brothers' politics and participate in their violent activities. Mac is a good guy whose sincerity is being exploited by people less principled. The film, courageously, doesn't ask the audience to feel sorry for these people -neither is blameless for his or her predicament- but to consider their plight.Some critics have felt that the emotional distance ""Shadow Dancer"" keeps from its subjects is too great to engage the audience in their dilemma, but I think the film's virtual numbness is one of its most impressive qualities. This isn't a case of a film that is so disengaged from its characters that the audience cannot understand them. It is easy to understand Colette's and Mac's fears and motivations. But it is done without histrionics on the part of the actors or of the camera. They are both very introverted people, and this is an introverted film. The pacing is deliberate and plodding, lulling the audience into the mood. Andrea Riseborough and Clive Owen help us understand their characters with minimal emoting and dialogue. American actress Gillian Anderson is also fantastic in a critical supporting role as Mac's boss. And ""Shadow Dancer"" actually packs a couple of surprises.The DVD (Magnolia 2013): Bonus features include ""Behind the Scenes of Shadow Dancer"" (8  min), a featurette with interviews of director James Marsh, writer Tom Bradby, producer Chris Coen, director of photography Rob Hardy, and the principle cast, addressing how the film came to be made, the inspiration for the story, and the directing style. ""Cast and Crew Interviews"" are 7 brief interviews with 4 members of the cast -Andrea Riseborough, Clive Owen, Gillian Anderson, Brid Brennan- and director James Marsh, writer Tom Bradby, and producer Chris Coen. Most of this interview material also appears in the first featurette. ""AXS TV: A Look at Shadow Dancer"" (3 min) is a promotional piece that uses clips from the above featurettes.

1638071,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B00BSVSSM2,Ron,"[3, 5]","This movie was missing something that handicaps the great cast, acting and somber mood from developing into a great story that is seldom told of the informants for the British Government. Mac (Clive Owen) is a agent for MI-5 (Britians version of the FBI ) working to thwart IRA terrorist attacks in Britian and Ireland. He has been working for 8 months to recruit an informant when he catches a break when a bomb placed in ""The Tube"" (a London subway) doesn't detonate carried by Collette (Andrea Riseborourgh). Collette agrees to Mac's terms to avoid prison and more importantly not to loose her young son. Collette and her son will be be placed in a witness protection program after completing her assignment. There is a background story to Collette's story that I have skipped over that deals with guilt and tragedy. I think that this will give you an idea of what this story is about. Ther is much more to this story, but I don't want to spoil it for you. As I stated earlier the casting and acting are the saving grace to this story, but the direction other than getting very good performances from the cast was lacking. The real culprit from my perspective is the writing and the total lack of background on the IRA (Catholic) and Protestants UVF, LVF, UDA, UFF conflict. Early in the conflict it was more about class than religion with the Catholics representing the poor and the Protestants representing the upper class. Ireland never changed religions after 1000 A.D. like the English did when they switched from Catholicism to Protestant around 1500 A.D. When the English started plantations in Ireland they aquired the land with less than ideal terms for the Irish. This was one of the issues that fueled the animosity towards England. I can't forget that freedom from Englands rule was also an issue.  Now you have a very short history of the conflict. This omitted history is key to helping people from other countries to better understand this story. It was like starting a book halfway through it and not knowing what its really about. Without this critical info we aren't allowed to see the passion that drove these people to do the horrible things they did. The story does not even mention the Protestants UVF etc. or their cause. We only witness a couple of events that tear the families apart from the conflict.  We are shown the extreme measures that the IRA and the British government are willing to take to either get an informant or to kill one.

Shadow Dancer had me thinking I knew what was going to happen at several points, only to take me in another direction. The result was not quite as satisfying as I had hoped, however. This is largely due to the fact that the audience is not permitted to know what the characters are thinking, and often it appears as though they are also uncertain. The result is some spectacular acting from leads Andrea Riseborough and Clive Owen, who are forced to convey much without words beings said, and a coldly distant narrative which never fully allows the audience to care for them.Set in 1990s, Shadow Dancer opens in London with an aborted IRA terrorist attack by our troubled protagonist, Collette (Riseborough). Although Collette intentionally neglects to activate the bomb and seems more entangled in the IRA through family ties than personal belief, the MI5 officers who capture her waste no time manipulating the woman to become an informant. Her handler, who she only knows as Mac (Owen) promises that he will protect her and her son, though this leap of faith asks that Collette also turn her back on her family in Belfast.FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW VISIT [...][...]",4,REAL MOVIE NEWS REVIEW,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,1343,"['am', 'always', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'film', 'take', 'unexpected', 'narrative', 'route', 'especially', 'large', 'number', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'decreasingly', 'brief', 'existence', 'Shadow', 'Dancer', 'had', 'thinking', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'several', 'points', 'only', 'take', 'direction', 'result', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'satisfying', 'had', 'hoped', 'however', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'audience', 'not', 'permitted', 'know', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'thinking', 'often', 'are', 'also', 'uncertain', 'result', 'spectacular', 'acting', 'leads', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'convey', 'much', 'words', 'beings', 'said', 'coldly', 'distant', 'narrative', 'never', 'fully', 'audience', 'care', 'them.Set', '1990s', 'Shadow', 'Dancer', 'London', 'aborted', 'IRA', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'troubled', 'protagonist', 'Collette', 'Riseborough', 'Collette', 'intentionally', 'activate', 'bomb', 'more', 'entangled', 'IRA', 'family', 'ties', 'personal', 'belief', 'MI5', 'officers', 'who', 'capture', 'waste', 'time', 'manipulating', 'woman', 'become', 'informant', 'handler', 'who', 'only', 'Mac', 'Owen', 'will', 'protect', 'son', 'leap', 'faith', 'asks', 'Collette', 'also', 'turn', 'back', 'family', 'Belfast.FOR', 'THE', 'REST', 'THE', 'REVIEW', 'VISIT', '[', ']', '[', ']']",N/A

This is an example of a movie where the idea is great but the execution is lacking. The movie is good but really just a little too slow to be able to stay interested in.

When arrested, she is forced by an MI5 agent Mac (Clive Owen) to choose between life in jail with her son taken away, or life as an MI5 informant.The atmospheric UK-Ireland thriller starts out promisingly with a heroine who finds herself in a terrible dilemma. She is not particularly good at what she is required to do, and she knows it. She knows she would be killed if somebody should know her secret. The film is slow-paced, but is still tense.The film gets less subtle in the second half, when we see more of an MI5 superior Kate Fletcher (Gillian Anderson), whose character is not really needed.
