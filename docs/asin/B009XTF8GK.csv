It presents a wonderful commentary on the evils (and potential for evil) of capitalism and its power to realign our concepts of ""the necessary things in life."" The best sci-fi film of the year is unlike any film before it.  The only reason people judge it is because it is so different at presenting its message, but in reality, its originality and uniqueness is what makes it so special--think Brazil.",5,Just cause you expected different doesn't make it bad.,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,466,"['One', 'most', 'misunderstood', 'underrated', 'films', 'year', 'wonderful', 'commentary', 'evils', 'potential', 'evil', 'capitalism', 'power', 'realign', 'concepts', 'necessary', 'things', 'life', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'year', 'film', 'only', 'reason', 'people', 'judge', 'so', 'different', 'presenting', 'message', 'reality', 'originality', 'uniqueness', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'think', 'Brazil']",N/A

1603115,A30WXSK6N4J0CZ,B009XTF8GK,Christian R. Unger,"[4, 5]","So let's start with what is good: Leelee Sobieski and Jeffrey Tambor are doing a great job. Both are utterly believable in their roles in a world that is ... well ... insane, illogical and stupid. Also, the central message that marketing through branding and advertisement rules our lives and should be stopped is a good point, which runs oddly parallel to what we now have in Australia (and I gather other parts of the world) where cigarettes are no longer displayed and the packaging is ""plain"".... and really, that is it. The movie is ~105 minutes and overall is not too badly paced, though arguably pacing is not an issue because as you are watching there are so many questions on your mind as to what the director was thinking, how this makes sense, or why Tambor and Sobieski aren't in good movies. Still there is enough happening on screen that there is a constant stream of ""what is going on?"" coming at you.So what is this about: well, Stoppard plays Misha who was struck by lightning and thus was foretold to have an interesting life. He has a natural knack for marketing and eventually becomes successful at it. And here is the first thing that doesn't make sense, making me think either I missed something, or it's not explained. Given the rest of the movie, I'm thinking that it was not explained. Misha is winning awards but is getting turned down for pitches even though he is clearly busy working on stuff. I have no idea where that was supposed to go, I don't think it had any impact and maybe it was the biggest red herring ever. Maybe it's a metaphor about misdirection, which would take this movie to a meta level few would attempt and if that's what they did on purpose then well done.Anyway, out of this comes that he produces with Sobieski's character a reality TV show about a girl who will have plastic surgery to become thin and thus popular etc. The entire thing is a plot engineered to result in outrage which eventually is supposed to change the world's body image ideal. Said girl ends up in a coma, whilst around the world a model dies from anorexia. These two events thus cause everyone to want to be fat within six years. Although this marketing stunt is done in Russia (where the movie is set) because it could not work in the first world, it seems to have fairly far reaching effects though ... it isn't made clear if this appearance is just that. There is scene near the end where it is implied that the US were drawn in too, but again it isn't really that clear. The strings in this are pulled by Von Sydow's character, who eventually is revealed as Misha's arch nemesis through their shared bond of lighting, and some other factors. This isn't a spoiler, because he is actually introduced as the villain.Because of girl going into comma and some subtle media manipulation a la ""Yes Prime Minister"" (Which again is not explained) Misha and Abby (Sobieski) are exiled and split up. That doesn't matter though because they eventually meet again after Misha has become a cowboy and incidentally Abby has a son from Misha. Misha does something with a cow (I was tuning out at this point but the narrator indicated it was significant so I remember that there was a special red cow) and when he goes back to civilisation with Abby he starts seeing that brands are feeding (??) of people. This parasitic ... ""relationship"" is visualised with dreadful CG which is so bad that one can only assume the directors thought this would make a statement. (It really is that bad and messy).Meanwhile, Abby thinks Misha is going insane, largely because he is going for the whole violent bipolar thing where he is apologetic right before, during and after slamming Abby into the ground, nevermind that what he's talking about is metaphysical while to him it is reality. From here though (due to the loss) he realises what he must do to right the wrongs of the world, or at least marketing, and thus works towards the destruction of all branding. And to do this he resorts to the exact sales pitch Von Sydow used in his Faustian pitch. At this point there is less than 30 minutes of film left, and this is also where the trailer's make it look really awesome.Remember, how I said that the misdirection about Misha's success was possibly a statement? This is roughly where it syncs up again, because the trick to marketing the movie is making out is that say there is a reality show about becoming thin through surgery, but what that's really about is selling fast food. Or brands are feeding of you but really that's bad for you because ... advertising was used to get you interested in the first place.So, it does make you think, though I really don't think that it is making you think along the right lines: it's not talking about how advertisers work, but rather how they could work if they were completely without morals and on LSD, while the world itself subscribes to the rules of Wonderland from Through the Looking Glass. And that's exactly what's going on, everyone (except Von Sydow who arguably is just evil) is off their medication and causality is suspended. The people follow the logic of ""reality TV about weightloss through plastic surgery is outrageous"" therefore ""I will gorge myself on fast food"". And although there is a little more to it, the causation and logic is still just as absent.Just in closing, the reason I watched the movie is because I saw a review on the Escapist which said it was the worst movie of 2000something, but at the same time the footage being shown (from the trailer) looked pretty good (this is where the ""good"" CG is happening). So I expected bad, and I almost gave up, but I wanted to know where this was going to go, because just past half way I did not foresee where this could possibly go. Now that I've seen it I'm still struggling. Someone mentioned that this this was like ""Idiocracy"". It is not: Idiocracy makes a statement about what an extrapolation of extremes in our current society might mean for the future, and then asks the viewer to consider this further. It takes stupidity from today which anyone can see in our world and amplifies it to a national / global scale, but acknowledges that this is a (d)evolution. Branded is a story of enlightenment where a stupid person in an insane world causes the salvation of the world by using evil techniques (even for marketing) for good. It doesn't ask the audience anything, but rather preaches and ironically does it so badly and unconvincing. It's akin to a religious leader who practices all the things he preaches against, and in his preaching equates good and evil not with action but intention of those involved.And for those who think this might just be art house, and no-one got it: Really, that's not it, the movie is stupid... Arguably so stupid you might have to see it to believe it, I know I didn't think it was going to get quite this bad. Like I said, I kept watching because I wanted to know where they'd go, and I never would have seen that coming (bits of it sure, but ...). That said, this isn't a complete train wreck, it isn't so bad it's good, it remains dreadfully bad. What it is, is this: so stupid it's almost interesting, if the experience wasn't so useless. That said, this is the kind of movie you can probably use to great effect if you got the right assignment question (maybe something along the lines of ""what drug induced reasoning might be comparable to"").Just thinking over this some more, there are two things I wanted to point out: first, this movie makes Plan 9 From Outer Space seem coherent and sensical. Second, there are typos in the forced subtitles for the Russian dialog.",1,There is so much wrong with this film it's hard to choose a point to start,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,7642,"['So', 'let',

1603118,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B009XTF8GK,Doug Park,"[1, 2]","After being struck by lightning as a young boy, Misha (Ed Stoppard) is endowed with the joint blessing/curse of seeing the hidden Pandora's Box of greed, competition, deception, and self-centered agendas behind the marketing world.Note: If you do not like really weird, parabolic stuff, you will probably dislike BRANDED. Nevertheless, after one normally attentive view, my verdict is as follows:BRANDED has a solid though somewhat jerky storyline. There are a number of wtf moments, but if you exercise a little patience, this film explains itself pretty well. The acting and cinematography are both very strong, often excellent. BRANDED deals with some really big ideas, but it is also truly funny, avoids the pretense that mars many films of its sort, and does not take itself too seriously. The view it affords us of what Misha's unique ability allows him to see is both stunning and hilarious. While the general ideas and ""morals"" included herein are nothing terribly new, the way the creators convey them is nothing if not extremely original.The most problematical element here is in deciding just how seriously to take some of the film's ideas and assertions; e.g., according to Misha, the entire concept of marketing was invented by. . .Vladimir Lenin? Oh well, this, like much of BRANDED, is obviously meant to be taken with a dose of salt.

I was in the theatres for some movie (Skyfall maybe?) and saw the previews for this movie.  It looked pretty interesting to me.  It had some intrigue and you know just looked like some Inception type of movie.  So the other day I'm goofing around and happened to ""find"" the movie from a ""source"" and was very excited to see what the movie was all about.  It's probably spoilers in here but I don't care because the movie is horrible in my opinion.The movie was about absolutely nothing.  For one the movie is hard to watch.  There's no flow whatsoever.  I was halfway through the movie and didn't even know what I was watching.  The film is all over the place and the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired.  The movie goes along like a series of commercials but not the good kind.  Apparently the guy is a marketing genius not getting the credit and then falls in love with some girl that's somebody's daughter.  That somebody seems to be the boss but is not really the boss.  Then he pulls the guy out of the car in traffic to beat him up and then the next scene they are at the bar together....then it cuts to the girl driving through a cow pasture and the guy living on a farm.....The movie was so outrageous that I damn near turned it off.  I don't care what movie it is it shouldn't take an hour for it to get interesting or make sense.  But I decided I was already half way through so I might as well finish the deal.  This is not to mention that there is a narrator during the flashbacks talking in a regular voice and not in like an epic Lord of The Rings or God of War voice.So he ends up in the back of the women's car naked and starts seeing stuff for no real reason and finds out he has a son that's like 8 years old.  Apparently the cow meat has some kind of marketing hallucinogen in it causing him to see these ads.  Or maybe it's just his crazy way of dealing with his emotions.  Then a guy gets struck by lightning and disappears.  At that point I'd had enough...figuring this was quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.The movie is trying to make a statement about life in general or maybe about eating meat....or maybe about fast food chains and consumption....or maybe about corporations running the world or...whatever but ends up not really saying anything.  The acting is marginal talent at best, the CGI is terrible.  The movie seems like it could have had a nice premise but the execution is so bad that it's not even worth watching.  The fact that I had high expectations for BRANDED after seeing the previews makes the movie even more disappointing.  This movie makes no sense and really has no reason to exist.

The box art and synopsis leads one to believe they're getting a smart sci-fi alien invasion conspiracy film. What we get in reality is a metaphysical art film delivering heavy-handed social commentary.After a terrible accident caused by one of his advertising schemes, Misha Galkin moves from the big city of Moscow to the country to get away from Russia's newfound obsession with capitalism. After performing an ancient Red Heifer ritual in which he sacrifices a red cow and bathes in its ashes, he starts seeing bizarre creatures feeding off of people's marketing desires. Misha becomes driven in his mission to destroy the monstrous things and free Moscow and the world from their brand obsessions.If nothing else, directors Jamie Bradshaw and Aleksandr Dulerayn have successfully crafted a cerebral journey for those who enjoy that sort of thing. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people. I do respect them for coming up with something different. It still feels like a whole lot of effort just to tell us that we're consumed with commercialism and victims of marketing and branding.""Branded"" might have worked better and felt more threatening had the creatures appeared more realistic. If you didn't know what year the movie was made, you'd think it was from the early 1990s based on the wretched CGI. There's something unsettling about the balloon-like creatures, but you can't shake the feeling you're viewing an eighth grade student's computer art project.I will award ""Branded"" a gold star for an eclectic cast who put forth their best efforts for such a strange film. LeeLee Sobieski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Max Von Sydow somehow wade through this esoteric indie flick maintaining straight faces the entire time. How does a bizarre project like this even catch the attention of someone as legendary as Von Sydow?There's nothing to complain about when it comes to the audio and video transfer for the movie's Blu-ray release. It holds on to its art-house flavor and atmosphere while having beautiful high-definition clarity. The 5.1 surround sound is perfect for spreading out the bizarre sounds of the creatures, musical score, and dialogue.Bonus material for the Blu-ray edition of ""Branded"" is sparse. Audio commentary is provided by the writers and directors Jamie Bradshaw and Aleksandr Dulerayn shed more light on the making of and concept behind the movie. The only other special features include a couple of trailers.Most people who buy or rent this based on how it looks are going to be disappointed. The audience ""Branded"" was made for will never even give it a chance because it's going to appear to be just another ""Independence Day"" knock-off to them.

Yep, they're there. Title? Yes, I remembered the screen menu, which had a sleight parody of how marketing is.Yet that's what the movie seemed to be more focused on, not bizarre creatures attached to people, but the war within marketing. Though set in Russia, it seemed a little too focused on story, so I began wondering if it was really an American movie trying too hard to be what it wasn't? After all, the trailers were focused on the special effects, regardless of which trailer or commercial it was, they all had the monsters. Yet, after 30 minutes I did wonder.45 minutes in, and I was getting tired of the meandering story. Finally, at 1 hour mark, it happened, though too late for me to care much for all that happened. And afterward, the creatures had little relevance on their own, they were more of a gimmick based on the war on marketing tactics and social manipulation, how even news spins can corrupt so much social thought.If it had been even hinted at during the trailers, I would've been okay with it. As it was, I felt let down. Immensely.

Here it is:All the unusual people hear the voicesAll saw what others could not seeAnd each of them will change the worldSounds promising right?And while I appreciated Ed Stoppard's masterful skill at verbalized Russian, an impressive feat by itself, the movie which houses that performance was just awful.There are a host of problems with this flick, but for brevity's sake, I'll limit myself to a couple of points.First, and quite misleadingly, there was no ""all"". The implication of the introduction suggests a host of characters. There was one guy. And in truth, given how somber and sullen the lead character is in the role, he really could've used some backup characters to lighten the load.Second, borrowing heavily from the more entertaining and in a surprising contrast, much deeper film, 'They Live' - this production attempts a surreal approach to the same concept: Global domination via mind control. Ploddingly slow direction with piss poor plot construction and indistinct dramatic threads, 'Branded' finds itself attempting to weave too many disparate ideas; lost because it doesn't know what it wants to be. Honestly, it was an all over the place nonsensical mess.Is it a scifi thriller about global conglomerates utilizing technology to imprint brand identity into the human unconsciousness? A war for humanity taking place on an extrasensory battlefield? An indictment of mass consumerism with introspective insights into the loss of one's individuality? A thriller revealing a new breed of meta-human?Instead of a cohesive plot - a fevered rambling collage of paranoid fantasies is vomited unto us in the audience as a movie.Ever stop and listen to the spittle-filled crazies that talk to themselves in the local park? This is the same thing, only presented on the big screen.Made watchable by the sheer beauty of Leelee Sobieski. Unfortunately, it's my opinion that after such a long career filled with middling performances, she's the modern Jayne Mansfield. Her looks are her only real talent. I've never screened anything in her resum&eacute; that could be construed as noteworthy. Admittedly, she's more eloquent and skilled than her buxom predecessor, but in my opinion, she's in the same sad place - mediocrity. Didn't end well for Mansfield. Suspect it won't end much better for her.Well filmed but deeply unsatisfying flick because the core of this production is delivered thru a convoluted and half-baked screenplay, propped up with the most ridiculous high school CGI creatures this side of freeware animation.This production proves one thing without question: Sometimes two directors are not better than one.Movie Note: Thought it was interesting that the writers included the ancient Taurobolium. Kind of wished that the writers made better use of such a historic ceremony other than as a stage prop. Unfortunate. That particular brutal ritual is the basis for many ancient religions and cults, and the potential for having greater import was a loss to its narrative. One that this film desperately needed. Seriously, how many people even knows what a taurobolium is in the 21st century? An explanation would've helped the plot tremendously, and that in turn, could've been a stronger element to tie the differing aspects of the film together.Personal Note: This next statement is unfair, judgmental and irrelevant - I get that. But I suspect part of the reason I had a difficult time screening Stoppard was the constant distraction of staring at his comb-over.

I expected a low budget Asylum/SyFy film, one I could sit and laugh at the terrible acting and bad special effects. Instead what I obtained was very ingenious film that unfortunately sacrificed entertainment in order to make a statement. The first half of the movie is long in setting up for the second half.It appears a symbolic divine heavenly cow in Taurus (minus the Pleiades) creates people from time to time with great insight to shape the human race. This cow also narrates in voice that sounds like Cate Blanchett talking to Frodo because the writers weren't clever enough to create a good scene to relate what was spoken. Narration as constant filler is substandard writing.Misha (Ed Stoppard), a Russian ad man has been selected as those once in a generation visionaries to lead mankind. As an ad man he meets Abby (Leelee Sobieski) and they produce a show together. However, there are evil forces out there against them: a burger man (Max von Sydow) with a diabolical marketing campaign that will make ""fat women popular."" Kiss me Mama June. Eventually Misha has a divine cow planned epiphany and becomes a Roddy Piper (""They Live"") without the glasses to give us the brief sci-fi moments.The film is an over statement on how the world is shaped by advertising and propaganda campaigns.
