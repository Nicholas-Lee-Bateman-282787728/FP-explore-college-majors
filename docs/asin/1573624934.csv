So are Vincent Spano, Virginia Madsen, Mariel Hemingway, and David Ogden Stiers.What can I say about this story? It's sometimes hard for me to explain it to people who haven't seen it. When some people hear ""a man tries to regrow his dead wife"" they sort of cringe and think it's some sort of weird sci fi or horror movie.It's neither - it's a love story. Actually, it's several love stories. You've got the love Harry has for his late wife, the love between him and Millie, the love between Boris and Barbara, and even the love (non-romantic) between Boris and Harry.Still, Creator is far from a typical ""love story."" It's very unique. I've never seen another movie quite like it.It's got a great cast and great story with a nice mix of humor, drama, and romance.

190388,A31BBNT8C62MLU,1573624934,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[0, 0]","This movie has flaws (BIOLOGISTS calling a chimp a MONKEY (!!), supposedly having ""hospital privileges"" and treating medical patients (!!), obviously written by someone who hadn't a clue about such things) but I'm nitpicking, because its heart is SO in the right place it's worth watching.  One quibble though, without ruining the plot, WHAT happened to the ""science project"" O'Toole had hidden beneath the sheet in his home lab?  No explanation was given as to what became of it.  And, while profanity doesn't bother me, for those it does, there's lots of it, explicit sex and sexual discussions, too, so not suitable for the kids (though ultimately the film is respectful of religion and religious values, e.g., the sanctity of marriage).The casting was inspired, spot on.  I'm a big Peter O'Toole fan (one of my favorite movies ever isDEAN SPANLEY), but even so, in CREATOR I thought a young Vincent Spano (followed closely by Mariel Hemingway) just MADE the movie, its heart and soul.  He's charming, sincere, totally believable- captivating in scene after scene, the ones in the hospital towards the end are something to behold- affecting, moving.  I also liked the relationship between O'Toole and Hemingway, real chemistry there, ditto with O'Toole and Spano, and Spano and Virginia Madsen.  And Lee Kessler shone in a little gem of a performance as Mrs. Pruitt, O'Toole's gal friday.  The film is visually pleasing, beautifully shot, gorgeous scenery.  VERY quirky, schmaltzy, but most definitely a feel-good movie and a fine way to spend a couple hours.",4,"GREAT casting, & Vincent Spano MAKES the movie,*FOR ADULTS ONLY*",1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,1562,"['movie', 'flaws', 'BIOLOGISTS', 'calling', 'chimp', 'MONKEY', 'supposedly', 'having', 'hospital', 'privileges', 'treating', 'medical', 'patients', 'obviously', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'clue', 'such', 'things', ""'m"", 'nitpicking', 'heart', 'SO', 'right', 'place', 'worth', 'watching', 'One', 'quibble', 'ruining', 'plot', 'WHAT', 'happened', 'science', 'project', ""O'Toole"", 'had', 'hidden', 'sheet', 'home', 'lab', 'explanation', 'was', 'given', 'what', 'became', 'profanity', ""n't"", 'bother', 'lots', 'sex', 'sexual', 'discussions', 'too', 'not', 'suitable', 'kids', 'ultimately', 'film', 'respectful', 'religion', 'religious', 'values', 'e.g.', 'sanctity', 'marriage', '.The', 'casting', 'was', 'inspired', 'spot', ""'m"", 'big', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'fan', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'isDEAN', 'SPANLEY', 'even', 'so', 'CREATOR', 'thought', 'young', 'Vincent', 'Spano', 'followed', 'closely', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'just', 'MADE', 'movie', 'heart', 'soul', 'charming', 'sincere', 'totally', 'believable-', 'captivating', 'scene', 'scene', 'ones', 'hospital', 'end', 'are', 'something', 'behold-', 'affecting', 'moving', 'also', 'liked', 'relationship', ""O'Toole"", 'Hemingway', 'real', 'chemistry', 'there', 'ditto', ""O'Toole"", 'Spano', 'Spano', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Lee', 'Kessler', 'shone', 'little', 'gem', 'performance', 'Mrs.', 'Pruitt', ""O'Toole"", 'gal', 'friday', 'film', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'VERY', 'quirky', 'schmaltzy', 'most', 'definitely', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'fine', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours']",N/A
