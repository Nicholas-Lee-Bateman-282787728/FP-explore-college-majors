I'm in the process of retiring my tapes and switching to disc/streaming video. This tape was one that I expected would be one of my last holdouts.The basic storyline is about a retired man facing the onset of Alzheimer's and his adult daughter's growing concern about his increasingly odd and paranoid behavior. Her father tells her that he is a retired spy and ""they are after him."" To protect himself, he has become a shut-in, afraid to go outside his house/yard. He also conducts ""drills"" with his friend, a handyman who plays along to humor him with his game. The movie treats the issue of Alzheimers and dementia respectfully.  It's well acted, with a talented cast, a refreshingly original story skillfully combining drama with balanced portions of suspense, action and humor. The bonus features are limited to essentially a few brief cast/director interviews and filmographies/previews.

His family doesn't believe a word of it, and thinks that Mace is suffering from alheimer's disease.  Mace's doctor, played quite effectively here by Hector Elizondo, agrees.And so we have Mace convinced that the conservative presidential candidate wants him dead, and we're left to observe for ourselves whether that candidate has a good reason for feeling the way he does ... or if Mace really is mentally ill.The ending of this film is truly well-played.  I truly hope I don't give away anything here, but I must say this:  We end up having a great deal of confidence in Mace, even when common sense tells us we shouldn't.A well-written screenplay, effective direction, and very strong performances by both Patrick Steward and Kimberly Williams make this a very enjoyable film.",4,"If you like Patrick Stewart, you'll like this film.

When Patrick Stewart, disguised (so as to be incognito while away from his home) as a construction worker, asked his shrink if he thought the shrink felt Stewart liked leaving his house dressed as one of the Village People, I thought I'd fall over laughing.  Then it got quite serious and I started enjoying it on a totally different level.Patrick Stewart claims, without any supporting evidence, to be a retired government spy who has fatal information regarding a current presidential hopeful.  Fatal to Stewart and fatal to the candidate's future.A housekeeper is hired by Stewart's daughter to avoid having him committed.  After various humorous interviews, a sprightly young woman is hired and the war of nerves begins.  The plot is complicated as Stewart realizes he is sucumbing to Alzheimer's.  I particularly enjoyed where he tries to memorize the standard quizzes asked by shrinks so the level of disease advancement wouldn't be so apparent during his regular shrink visits.The acting by all is superb.  Stewart continues to show why he isn't a one-trick pony.Yes there are a few unexplained occurrences but the movie is quirky enough to not be bothered by these little things.

The plot moves on through the eyes of someone who might not necessarily be seeing reality as clearly as he should; is this man, merely eccentric?  Is he completely insane?  Or is he...well, who and what he says he is?Patrick Stewart is just fantastic.  He's definitely not one to spend his time traveling from one Star Trek convention to another now that his time serving the small screen franchise of Gene Roddenberry's ""generational"" vision is done.  His propensity for bombast and overacting that he brought to ""A Christmas Carol"" isn't found here; he does a fantastic job relaying the problems experienced by a man for whom the borders or reality seem to be in various stages of dissipation.  You don't know whether to laugh or cry at times.And the supporting cast plays off of him brilliantly.  It's obviously Stewart's show, but the interaction with characters whose attitudes range from enabling to pessimistic to completely disbelieving (and questionably sinister) makes for an intense viewing experience.

In reality, it was much, much better than expected.Stewart plays Mace Sowell, a reclusive widower living in the Hollywood Hills inside a house packed with more security systems and personal weaponry - pistols hidden in every room - than were ever aboard the Starship Enterprise. Mace claims to be a retired deep-cover agent for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a fact that has put him in mortal danger for a reason he leaves unspecified. He's also obsessively disturbed by the political progress of a certain presidential candidate, who's apparently on his way to winning the Oval Office by a landslide. His fears are given little credence by his daughter, her husband, or the psychiatrist retained by the former to treat her Old Man's apparent delusions. The daughter has also just hired Andi, a perky young college graduate, to be Mace's live-in cook and housekeeper. Kimberly Wiliams plays Andi, short for Andrea, whose character displays a delicate beauty and charming appeal somewhat reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn.It's been made perfectly clear to Andi that she's not Mace's employee to fire, so the cardinal delight of the film's first third is watching the curmudgeonly Sowell (with a capital ""C"") engage in a battle of wits with Andi for turf rights as she gamely carries out her assignment. Luckily, Andi is made of tough stuff. She cleanly fields the verbal and psychological abuse that Mace throws at her, and sometimes manages to give back as good as she gets. Eventually, they reach a working compromise and a certain friendship, at about which time Mace begins to display the symptoms of advancing Alzheimer's Disease, thus further hindering his ability to ""stay sharp"" and repel any assault made on his home or person.From the beginning, any watcher of SAFE HOUSE will assume the truth of the adage that even paranoids have enemies. So, when will Mace's doomsday materialize? Even Andi begins to wonder as Sowell's convictions begin to draw her in. Stewart gives a performance that is alternately dramatic, witty, and poignant. Williams is positively beguiling. During the scene when she is first alone with Mace and struggling to establish a verbal rapport, her facial expressions as she deals with his silent recalcitrance are priceless. Although some things go unexplained, as to how the neighbors or the LAPD would tolerate Mace's live-fire pistol practice in his back yard, I enjoyed this film very much.",4,Paranoia in the Hollywood Hills with Captain Picard,983318400,"02 28, 2001",2001,2567,"['pulled', 'SAFE', 'HOUSE', 'made-for-cable', 'thriller', 'video', 'rack', 'solely', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'mean', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'reality', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'expected.Stewart', 'plays', 'Mace', 'Sowell', 'reclusive', 'widower', 'living', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'house', 'packed', 'more', 'security', 'systems', 'personal', 'weaponry', 'pistols', 'hidden', 'room', 'were', 'ever', 'Starship', 'Enterprise', 'Mace', 'be', 'retired', 'deep-cover', 'agent', 'Defense', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'DIA', 'fact', 'put', 'mortal', 'danger', 'reason', 'unspecified', 'also', 'obsessively', 'disturbed', 'political', 'progress', 'certain', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'who', 'apparently', 'way', 'winning', 'Oval', 'Office', 'landslide', 'fears', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'credence', 'daughter', 'husband', 'psychiatrist', 'retained', 'former', 'treat', 'Old', 'Man', 'apparent', 'delusions', 'daughter', 'also', 'just', 'hired', 'Andi', 'perky', 'young', 'college', 'graduate', 'be', 'Mace', 'live-in', 'cook', 'housekeeper', 'Kimberly', 'Wiliams', 'Andi', 'short', 'Andrea', 'character', 'delicate', 'beauty', 'charming', 'appeal', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn.It', 'been', 'made', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'Andi', 'not', 'Mace', 'employee', 'fire', 'cardinal', 'delight', 'film', 'first', 'third', 'watching', 'curmudgeonly', 'Sowell', 'capital', 'C', 'engage', 'battle', 'wits', 'Andi', 'turf', 'rights', 'gamely', 'out', 'assignment', 'Luckily', 'Andi', 'made', 'tough', 'stuff', 'cleanly', 'verbal', 'psychological', 'abuse', 'Mace', 'sometimes', 'manages', 'give', 'back', 'as', 'good', 'Eventually', 'reach', 'working', 'compromise', 'certain', 'friendship', 'time', 'Mace', 'display', 'symptoms', 'advancing', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'thus', 'further', 'hindering', 'ability', 'stay', 'sharp', 'repel', 'assault', 'made', 'home', 'person.From', 'beginning', 'watcher', 'SAFE', 'HOUSE', 'will', 'assume', 'truth', 'adage', 'even', 'paranoids', 'have', 'enemies', 'So', 'when', 'will', 'Mace', 'doomsday', 'materialize', 'Even', 'Andi', 'wonder', 'Sowell', 'convictions', 'begin', 'draw', 'Stewart', 'performance', 'alternately', 'dramatic', 'witty', 'poignant', 'Williams', 'positively', 'beguiling', 'scene', 'when', 'first', 'alone', 'Mace', 'struggling', 'establish', 'verbal', 'rapport', 'facial', 'expressions', 'silent', 'recalcitrance', 'are', 'priceless', 'things', 'go', 'unexplained', 'how', 'neighbors', 'LAPD', 'would', 'tolerate', 'Mace', 'live-fire', 'pistol', 'practice', 'back', 'yard', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'very', 'much']",N/A

Hired to take care of him is Kimberly Williams, a young lady who soon falls for Mace's cunning charm. But Williams' character isn't played off as an unintelligent woman. Instead she's always two steps ahead of Mace and sees through his games and shenanigans. Williams does a nice job in the part.

I wish there was a way they could make sequels from it.Patrick Stewart should have won an academy award for his performance in this movie. Excellent acting by all. Excellent story. Excellent directing... I can't think of a single negative in this entire movie. It captures your attention from the beginning to the end.The story is about a former DIA Agent (Defense Intelligence Agency) who, after living a covert life with a ""Cover story"" career... has retired young with an early case of Alzheimer's. He knows a deadly secret about a Presidential candidate which places his life in jeopardy as well as the lives of other fellow agents who also know the truth about this candidate. But his daughter does not believe him. Everyone thinks his paranoia about his life as an Agent and being in mortal jeopardy is part of his Alzheimer's disease. His daughter does not believe her father was ever in any intelligence position. She only knows his cover story career... thus Stewart's paranoid behavior has her considering having him committed.It is a pleasure watching Stewart going through his daily security rituals and his ""deadman's switch"" which is his only life insurance policy keeping him alive while all of his former fellow agents are being bumped off, one at a time.Stewart's character desperately fights the ravages of his disease. His character is much too young, charming, charismatic, talented and handsome to be suffering from such an early onset of this disease as we watch him deteriorating little by little.A well-written story. We don't know where the danger lurks and at times they have us wondering if he really is ""losing it."" The writing was an excellent work of art. There is not a boring moment in the movie. Patrick Stewart is a pleasure to watch... and his costar who portrayed ""Andy"" is also quite surprising in her acting as well. They react well with each other in this movie.The movie is exciting, intriguing and a complete surprise in the twists and turns of the plot.

Patrick Stewart is never less than convincing, either as a retired military intelligence legend obsessed with his own security, or as an old man whose mind is failing long before his body.Suppose Sean Connery's Bond had aged gracefully, settled down somewhere and tried to live a normal life.  Would he still be spending his evenings with lovely ladies and vodka martinis?  Or would he be a prisoner of his own past, constantly fearful that all his old enemies would come back to haunt him?  And what if his friends and family didn't really believe he'd ever had those grand old adventures?The beauty of 'Safe House' is that there's no evidence to support the lead character's paranoid claims of government conspiracy, and it's entirely possible that he's imagining the whole thing.  Yet the film keeps flirting with the possibility that his fears are real, teasing us with suggestions of menace that never entirely come to fruition.  Is there a true danger, or is it all in his mind?Watching 'Safe House', we don't find out...until the very last scene.
