I didn't care for known rappers to be in the movie, because I just don't like famous rappers in movies much, but that doesn't effect my rating of this movie at all.

The women are in jail because they are hardended criminals, yet the film is set up for us to feel compassion for these women.  They are mothers, they have feelings and the are horribly abused by the prison captain.The stand out roles in this film are not the obvious.  Lisa Raye is a very beautiful woman who I support, but her acting is pretty much the same in every film, she pouts, she tries to look tough, i.e., she could have been Diamond from &quot;Players Club.&quot;Da Brat did some pretty good acting as the films narrator Sabrina.  Lark Voorhies shined as little mama and N'Bushe Wright proved that she deserves more film roles.  Monica Calhoun is in this film, Tichina Arnold and several other leading African-American women including MC Lyte who acted really well in her role.  Not to mention Mos Def as a college going prison guard.This film is well written in most parts, there were a few scenes that had me wondering, like why the women were doing sit ups in the hole, but other than that it was a good film.I thought it would be like those cheesy prison movies in the 70's, but it is very thought provoking.  It makes the viewer think about prison as a business and how when abuse takes place behind prison walls it is often hard to get word to the outside.This film made me depressed at times because the women just faced so much tragedy.

I've found a much deeper connection with her work after I viewed the DVD with her commentary... I love both Mc Lyte's & N'Bushe Wright's Dispositions period, so they're my rationale for supporting Civil Brand! Mc Lyte gets slept on as an Actress & Rappers as well! She ominscient at what she does and she speaks & raps eloquently! Mc Lyte, Queen Latifah are 2 of the best that has strucked Rap & Acting (hands down). Thanks to Neema B. for not being raunchy & making Civil Brand out to be a cliche' prison chick flick! Tichina Arnold (Pam) from Martin showed that she's versatile with her skills. I loved when Tichina punched Lisa in the face & snatched her chain, like ''Bitch Ante-Up''. I'll express my Hatred for Clifton Powell's character... He had the balls to think that he & his boss would get away with turning these inmates into Tricks!!!!When Monica Calhoun & the rest of them were beating his ass I got an Adrenalin rush! They took over the prison on some Atticash*t (You Know). Mos Def was feeble at 1st but he found the courage to help with cause, so he was cool. Cervantes/Mc Lytewas on the wrong team, but I'm glad in a way because if she was a convict then she might have been killed also! My biggest complaint is that Neema should've kept most characters aliveso that they could've wreap the benefit of being Emancipatedalong with the narrator Da Brat! As I said before all of these prison movies are an example of how prisoners are slaved (it must be Seen & Heard). It should be Rectified why aren't these Tyrants being brought to Justice as the criminals that they are? It's F***ing sad that a prisoners has to make clothing & be paid little to nothing after completing it!... After that they'll Rape the Consumers by charging 2 arms & 1 leg for those items (A Total conspiracy)! I feel that Neema could've found someone else to play Lisa Raye's role, I wasn't getting anything from her! Jada Pinkett would've been suitable to play L. Raye's role!

The acting ranged from surprisingly good to passable, the characters were decently developed in moist cases, the script fairly tight except for a few small holes. But for some reason, the film doesn't hold together as well as it should. One major problem is the director trying to get way too artistic with the camerawork (flashes, fades to B&W;, repeats, etc) instead of just telling the story. That actually made the film look far more amateurish than it really was. Second, there was too much time spent on several scenes (solitary, for example), when that time would have been better spent on, perhaps, more/additional character development and/or fleshing out. Third, some of the script was a little too melodramatic. Still; NOT your typical women-in-prison flick, but definitely 10 notches above in intelligence.

When I first started watching the movie about women in prison, I cringed at the terrible acting. I don't know why, but Tichina Arnold plays much better comedic roles than she does serious roles. Monica Calhoun and Lisa Raye are great at playing characters with a bunch of attitude (as in ""Player's Club""), but their acting comes across as stiff when they try to play vulnerable roles. I'm still scratching my head over why Lisa Raye keeps getting acting roles. Every single movie/tv sitcom she's been in, it sounds like she's reading directly from the script. I really would love for her to get an acting coach. When she plays crazy, I see potential though. MC Lyte is an okay actress, but not great.  Da Brat was extremely stiff in this role, but somehow that worked for her because she played the boss/masculine role well. I don't think it was acting though; that seems to be her persona regardless.  However, I really enjoyed the performances of N'Bushe Wright, Mos Def, Lark Voorhies, Reed McCants, and Clifton Powell. These five people carried the movie for me where the rest of the actors struggled.  The more I got into the plot and theme of the story about female prisoners being mentally and sexually abused along with terrible working conditions, I understood why this movie was so important and stopped concentrating on the mediocre acting.
