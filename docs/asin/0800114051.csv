161740,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0800114051,Acute Observer,"[5, 11]","This 1938 film was a big hit in the years of the Great Depression. It is terribly dated and unfunny today, given a changed culture. It begins on Wall Street when Mr. Kirby arrives at the building that has his name on it. Kirby & Co. will have the biggest monopoly on war munitions after he has bought all the property surrounding a competitor's factory. An early mechanical calculator is shown. The Vanderhoff family do their own thing at their large home. [This must be attractive to the unemployed of that day.] We meet each of them and their personality. [Only in Hollywood?] The culture of that time provides the background. ""Hello, Mother."" Could the son of a millionaire marry his secretary? Does this drama seem dated?The neighbors are afraid of being forced out as someone is buying up all the land. [No eminent domain then?] Grandpa's house has too many memories for him to leave. What will he get for paying his income tax? ""Not with my money."" Do these activities suggest family insanity or the stress from losing their wealth in the crash? Is ""having fun"" the purpose of life? The scene in the restaurant is interesting and funny. The family's activities are like a circus when the Kirbys arrive. Their dinner will be hot dogs, sauerkraut, and corn! Was there a mistake over dates? The conversation leads nowhere. Then some strange men enter and arrest everyone.These G-men found literature in a candy box. The fireworks go off, they all go to jail. Can anything else go wrong? There are speeches in the jail that discuss philosophical outlooks. [Do they make sense to you?] The trial in the courtroom provides drama. Grandpa decides its time to move on with his family. A. P. Kirby has triumphed. Ramsay has gone bust, but warns Kirby of a future fate. [Does the ending seem tacked on?]Can people's problems be solved by making music? Only in a Hollywood movie. The scene at the dinner table looks like a Norman Rockwell painting. Everything that was broken was put back together for the ending. [The scene where everybody puts up money was repeated in ""It's A Wonderful Life"".]",2,A Parable About the Purpose of Life,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,2091,"['1938', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'years', 'Great', 'Depression', 'terribly', 'dated', 'unfunny', 'today', 'given', 'changed', 'culture', 'Wall', 'Street', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Kirby', 'building', 'name', 'Kirby', 'Co.', 'will', 'have', 'biggest', 'monopoly', 'war', 'munitions', 'bought', 'property', 'surrounding', 'competitor', 'factory', 'early', 'mechanical', 'calculator', 'shown', 'Vanderhoff', 'family', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'large', 'home', '[', 'must', 'be', 'attractive', 'unemployed', 'day', 'meet', 'personality', 'Only', 'Hollywood', 'culture', 'time', 'background', 'Hello', 'Mother', 'son', 'millionaire', 'marry', 'secretary', 'drama', 'seem', 'dated', 'neighbors', 'are', 'afraid', 'being', 'forced', 'out', 'someone', 'buying', 'up', 'land', '[', 'eminent', 'domain', 'then', ']', 'Grandpa', 'house', 'too', 'many', 'memories', 'leave', 'What', 'will', 'get', 'paying', 'income', 'tax', 'Not', 'money', 'Do', 'activities', 'suggest', 'family', 'insanity', 'stress', 'losing', 'wealth', 'crash', 'having', 'fun', 'purpose', 'life', 'scene', 'restaurant', 'interesting', 'funny', 'family', 'activities', 'are', 'circus', 'when', 'Kirbys', 'arrive', 'dinner', 'will', 'be', 'hot', 'dogs', 'sauerkraut', 'corn', 'Was', 'mistake', 'dates', 'conversation', 'nowhere', 'Then', 'strange', 'men', 'enter', 'arrest', 'everyone.These', 'G-men', 'found', 'literature', 'candy', 'box', 'fireworks', 'go', 'off', 'go', 'jail', 'Can', 'anything', 'else', 'go', 'wrong', 'are', 'speeches', 'jail', 'philosophical', 'outlooks', '[', 'Do', 'make', 'sense', ']', 'trial', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'Grandpa', 'time', 'move', 'family', 'A.', 'P.', 'Kirby', 'triumphed', 'Ramsay', 'gone', 'bust', 'Kirby', 'future', 'fate', '[', 'ending', 'seem', 'tacked', ']', 'Can', 'people', 'problems', 'be', 'solved', 'making', 'music', 'Only', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'scene', 'dinner', 'table', 'looks', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'painting', 'Everything', 'was', 'broken', 'was', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'ending', '[', 'scene', 'where', 'everybody', 'up', 'money', 'was', 'repeated', 'Wonderful', 'Life', ']']",You Can't Take It With You VHS

161750,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0800114051,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 5]","I like Capra a lot.  This, for me, was one of his weakest efforts.  While it has its moments, and a few nicely played performances, the overall feel of the film is underwhelming (and a tad forced) and comes off sloppy as apposed to Capra's more polished and effective works.  In fact, if you took some of his best moments (`Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', `It Happened One Night' and `It's a Wonderful Life') and threw them together into one film you'd have `You Can't Take it With You', a film that should (but rarely does) work.The overall plot of the film is rather predictable and familiar.  Alice comes from a poorer family than her boyfriend Tony, who happens to be very, very wealthy.  Tony's family is very apposed to his relationship with Alice, but he doesn't care and wants his family to accept Alice and her family for who they are, which just so happens to be a group of eccentric people who put pleasure before responsibility.Yes, I know that this is a `big business is evil' type film (which is not an uncommon idea for Capra), but it comes off foolish.The whole idea of Grandpa Martin Vanderfof and his `life philosophies' are really hit or miss.  The idea that one should enjoy his life as apposed to ruining it for wealth is a positive and poignant one, especially when you contrast his character with that of Anthony P. Kirby, his nemesis and polar-opposite.  But, realistically, the Vanderfof clan live a really absurd and pointless existence.  He is painted as a wise and sympathetic man, but he is rather foolish and irresponsible.  That, and it's hard to believe that anything that happens in that house would actually take place.  It's far too, silly.The film is really a hodgepodge of clich&eacute;s, both society-wise as well as purely Hollywood-wise (every romantic-comedy clich&eacute; is thrown at the audience).But, there are some highlights here.For me, this film is about a few central performances that elevate the material.  I love Jean Arthur (I would have given her the Oscar, which she wasn't even nominated for, in 1939 for her brilliant work in `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' over Vivian Leigh) and think she is splendid here, even it she isn't given much to really work with.  Lionel Barrymore, despite having a ridiculous character, makes every scene shine brightly.  The best in show award goes to Edward Arnold though, who manages to give us a believable transformation thanks to his ability to add layers of character development in every scene.  I mean, just the small smile he gives when Penny insults his wife's `hobby' is a beautiful way to give a crack at this man's harsh exterior.But with the good comes the bad, and performances like that from that horribly stereotyped Russian guy just serve to knock this film down a peg or two (that performance was just gross).Anyways, like I said, this one is hit or miss.  I liked it in parts, but as a complete package it is not one that I would recommend or care to really watch again.  Loved Arnold though, so see it for that (if you love film and love evaluating performances, I'd recommend you see it just to get a glimpse at a stunning supporting performance).  I give it a C, nothing more, nothing less.",3,A weaker Capra classic...,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,3200,"['like', 'Capra', 'lot', 'was', 'one', 'weakest', 'efforts', 'moments', 'few', 'nicely', 'played', 'performances', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'underwhelming', 'tad', 'forced', 'off', 'sloppy', 'apposed', 'Capra', 'more', 'polished', 'effective', 'works', 'fact', 'took', 'best', 'moments', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'threw', 'together', 'one', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'film', 'should', 'rarely', 'work.The', 'overall', 'plot', 'film', 'rather', 'predictable', 'familiar', 'Alice', 'poorer', 'family', 'boyfriend', 'Tony', 'who', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'wealthy', 'Tony', 'family', 'very', 'apposed', 'relationship', 'Alice', ""n't"", 'care', 'family', 'accept', 'Alice', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'group', 'eccentric', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'pleasure', 'responsibility.Yes', 'know', 'big', 'business', 'evil', 'type', 'film', 'not', 'uncommon', 'idea', 'Capra', 'foolish.The', 'whole', 'idea', 'Grandpa', 'Martin', 'Vanderfof', 'life', 'philosophies', 'are', 'really', 'hit', 'miss', 'idea', 'one', 'should', 'enjoy', 'life', 'apposed', 'ruining', 'wealth', 'positive', 'poignant', 'one', 'especially', 'when', 'contrast', 'character', 'Anthony', 'P.', 'Kirby', 'nemesis', 'polar-opposite', 'realistically', 'Vanderfof', 'clan', 'live', 'really', 'absurd', 'pointless', 'existence', 'painted', 'wise', 'sympathetic', 'man', 'rather', 'foolish', 'irresponsible', 'hard', 'believe', 'anything', 'house', 'would', 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'far', 'too', 'silly.The', 'film', 'really', 'hodgepodge', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'society-wise', 'as', 'well', 'purely', 'Hollywood-wise', 'romantic-comedy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'thrown', 'audience', '.But', 'are', 'highlights', 'here.For', 'film', 'few', 'central', 'performances', 'elevate', 'material', 'love', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Oscar', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', '1939', 'brilliant', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'think', 'splendid', 'here', 'even', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'really', 'work', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'having', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'scene', 'shine', 'brightly', 'best', 'show', 'award', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'who', 'give', 'believable', 'transformation', 'thanks', 'ability', 'add', 'layers', 'character', 'development', 'scene', 'mean', 'just', 'small', 'smile', 'when', 'Penny', 'insults', 'wife', 'hobby', 'beautiful', 'way', 'give', 'crack', 'man', 'harsh', 'exterior.But', 'good', 'bad', 'performances', 'horribly', 'stereotyped', 'Russian', 'guy', 'just', 'serve', 'knock', 'film', 'down', 'peg', 'two', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'gross', 'said', 'one', 'hit', 'miss', 'liked', 'parts', 'complete', 'package', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'care', 'really', 'watch', 'again', 'Loved', 'Arnold', 'see', 'love', 'film', 'love', 'evaluating', 'performances', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'see', 'just', 'get', 'glimpse', 'stunning', 'supporting', 'performance', 'give', 'C', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less']",You Can't Take It With You VHS
161751,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0800114051,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Kaufman & Hart's YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU won the 1937 Best Drama Pulitzer; Frank Capra's screen adaptation was honored with Best Picture and Director Oscars. Robert Riskin's movie script generally follows that of the original production, but diverges on a few plot points:1.) Poppins, the film's toy and mask creator is not in the play. Printer/xylophonist Ed Carmichael was also K&H;'s maskmaker.2.) On stage, the actress G&aacute;y Wellington visits the Kirby home to read one of Penny's plays. She drinks too much and passes out. This character was eliminated from the movie.3.) The play's Grand Duchess Olga Katrina, now a waitress at Childs Restaurant, and her Uncle Sergei (an elevator operator) aren't in the film.This was the screen debut of Dub Taylor, a character actor often seen in westerns whose 56 year film career ended withMAVERICK(1994), the Mel Gibson/Jodie Foster/Jim Garner comedy. Taylor was chosen for Ed Carmichael because he was a skilled xylophonist. In one classic Johnny Carson Show appearance many years later, Dub astounded the audience by playing the xylophone with three mallets in each hand.The two-month shoot was not without some suffering. Fifteen-year-old Ann Miller, looking much older as Taylor's would-be ballerina wife, hid from crew and cast that the numerous dance moves required of her were causing severe pain. Lionel Barrymore as family patriarch Martin Vanderhof, was so disabled by arthritis and a bad hip he needed crutches. Director Capra designed a special foot cast and wrote into the script that Mr. V. had recently injured his leg. Thoughout each workday, Barrymore received injections to ease his suffering.""You Can't Take It With You"" concerns an extended family of kooks and the romance between Alice Sycamore, its most level-headed member and Tony Kirby, troubled son of an even more miserable wealthy land developer. The elder Kirby is a typical Depression Era movie rich guy: selfish, avaricious and without friends or redeeming qualities. His eventual transition into a human being is as assured as the rocky road that Tony Jr. and Alice will face before their own happy-ever-after ending.Comedic highlights are the crazy goings-on at Alice's home: random fireworks testing, a trained raven, music and dance on the spur of the moment, her dad posing for a oil portrait as a Roman discus thrower, Martin playing head games with an officious IRS man-- it's a classic screwball comedy celebrating a simple idea: carefree folks who fully enjoy life.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(8.0) You Can't Take It With You (1938) - Jean Arthur/Lionel Barrymore/James Stewart/Edward Arnold/Mischa Auer/Ann Miller/Spring Byington/Samuel S.

161752,AZTAC5WZ4QDRN,0800114051,Arne W Flones,"[4, 5]","There are two screwball classics of the 1930's which stand out above all the rest, Capra's ""You Can't Take It with You"" and Gregory La Cava's 1936 ""My Man Godfrey"".  Although I love both of them dearly, it's the former 1938 Capra film which has all the magic.There are plenty of plot synopses here, so I'll just comment in general.  First, the cast could not be better.  Every single actor here takes the art of comedy to new highs.  Some of the staged comedic routines are so complex one wonders how Capra could ever keep track of all the goings-on.  These show just that the brilliant magic of the ensemble can outdo individual efforts.  Not that there aren't standouts here, but, other than Barrymore and Byington, one is hard-put to pick one out over the others.  The ensemble work is perfection.However, this is a Capra direction.  The script crackles with social commentary.  This carries things forward in spite of the near total lunacy going on around it.  Capra knew what he wanted here and successfully weaves together the two tapestries into a stand-out of the genre.Forget that Capra changes the Kaufman-Hart play.  That doesn't matter.  If you want to see the play, it's also available on video.  Both stand on their own.

And it also stars Jimmie Stewart, along with Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Spring Byington. It's quite a romp.Jimmie Stewart is the capitalist's son, and set to become the President of a new, bigger than ever monopoly his father is putting together. The only hold-out in his buying up an entire neighborhood to tear it down for a factory is the kooky Sycamore family. Now, the Sycamores have exactly what I've always wanted: a sort of communal home where everyone does what they like to do, and manages to make enough money doing it to get by. Sort of a precursor to the Hippie communes of my youth. Or what we wanted to be, anyway.The complication is that Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) and the boss's son are in love. Alice is his secretary, whom his snooty mother discovers him kissing when she visits his office unexpectedly. Alice takes him home to meet her family, who are basically certifiably crazy by most standards. In fact, she's the only one who seems sane at first, although gradually you may come to realize that only the people in that house are sane, and the rest of the world is crazy.I won't spoil it for you, because you will laugh yourself silly at all the crazy things that happen on the way to humanizing Jimmy Stewart's father, and even give hope to make a human out of his mother (the Russian ballet teacher may be able to loosen her up, it seems).You gotta watch this in the context of 1938, of course. Both the economic times and the sociological ones, including the servant couple played by Rochester (remember Rochester on the Jack Benny Show?) and a pretty black lady who is cook and general housekeeper and who may or may not be his wife. But it has a similar theme of friendship, and the scene you remember from ""It's a Wonderful Life"" where all those friends take up a collection to help Jimmie Stewart are played out here, as well. Except it's Grandpa Sycamore on the receiving end this time, when he is fined $100 for making fireworks without a license.I'll give it five stars, in part because I enjoyed it so much, and in part because I want to make the point that it is even better than the other Stewart/Capra movie reviewed earlier.",5,Hilarious and Imaginative Film by Frank Capra,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2360,"['Ah', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'got', 'ta', 'guy', 'Remember', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'probably', 'saw', 'TV', 'year', 'Christmas', 'Well', 'here', 'least', 'good', 'also', 'Jimmie', 'Stewart', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'quite', 'romp.Jimmie', 'Stewart', 'capitalist', 'son', 'set', 'become', 'President', 'new', 'bigger', 'ever', 'monopoly', 'father', 'putting', 'together', 'only', 'hold-out', 'buying', 'up', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'tear', 'down', 'factory', 'kooky', 'Sycamore', 'family', 'Now', 'Sycamores', 'have', 'exactly', 'what', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'sort', 'communal', 'home', 'where', 'everyone', 'what', 'like', 'do', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'doing', 'get', 'Sort', 'precursor', 'Hippie', 'communes', 'youth', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'anyway.The', 'complication', 'Alice', 'Sycamore', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'boss', 'son', 'are', 'love', 'Alice', 'secretary', 'whom', 'snooty', 'mother', 'kissing', 'when', 'office', 'unexpectedly', 'Alice', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'basically', 'certifiably', 'crazy', 'most', 'standards', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'sane', 'first', 'gradually', 'may', 'come', 'realize', 'only', 'people', 'house', 'are', 'sane', 'rest', 'world', 'crazy.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'will', 'laugh', 'silly', 'crazy', 'things', 'happen', 'way', 'humanizing', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'father', 'even', 'give', 'hope', 'make', 'human', 'mother', 'Russian', 'ballet', 'teacher', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'loosen', 'up', '.You', 'got', 'ta', 'watch', 'context', '1938', 'course', 'economic', 'times', 'sociological', 'ones', 'including', 'servant', 'couple', 'played', 'Rochester', 'remember', 'Rochester', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Show', 'pretty', 'black', 'lady', 'who', 'cook', 'general', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'wife', 'similar', 'theme', 'friendship', 'scene', 'remember', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'where', 'friends', 'take', 'up', 'collection', 'help', 'Jimmie', 'Stewart', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Grandpa', 'Sycamore', 'receiving', 'end', 'time', 'when', 'fined', '100', 'making', 'fireworks', 'license.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'even', 'better', 'other', 'Stewart/Capra', 'movie', 'reviewed', 'earlier']",You Can't Take It With You VHS

Robert Riskin handed the great director another warm and hilarious screenplay, based this time on a play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. A perfect cast, which includes Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore, Jimmy Stewart, Spring Byington, Mischa Auer, Edward Arnold, Donald Meek, Ann Miller, Harry Davenport and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, make this a true film classic.The story centers around the impending marriage of Tony Kirby (Jimmy Stewart) and Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) and the complications that arise due to her very unconventional family, headed by her kind and loving grandfather, portrayed in memorable fashion by Lionel Barrymore. Everyone in her family does pretty much as they please, defying convention and unafraid to enjoy life to its fullest.Alice's mother Penny (Spring Byington) writes plays because a typewriter was once delivered to their house by mistake. Her sister Essie (Ann Miller) can't dance worth beans but takes lessons anyway from a starving and slightly crazy Russian named Kolenkov (Mischa Auer). He knows she can't dance but comes for the food and might as well be one of the family. Alice's dad spends all his time creating fireworks and testing them out inside the house. And grandpa, who refuses to pay taxes, has brought home a Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek), whom he has talked into pursuing his true love, which happens to be the making of monstor masks. All the above is usually going on simultaneously as grandpa plays the harmonica.Tony's family is involved in some strange thing called banking. His father Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) is, in fact, one of the most powerful men in America, and seeking even more power in a deal that hinges on his acquisition of an entire city block. But Alice's family lives in that block and grandpa is quite happy to hold out so everyone in the neighborhood doesn't have to move.There is a warm and charming scene as the young couple talk of their dreams and families on a bench by a moonlit lake. They end up dancing with some kids trying to make a buck, and Arthur somehow winds up with a sign on her back that reads: NUTS! Since Alice and Tony are on their way to meet his parents for the first time, it might just raise some eyebrows!The sweet but nervous Alice finally arranges for the Kirbys to come for dinner. Tony brings them on the wrong night, however, and catches everyone being their normal and whacky selves. Even Alice gets caught in the act, sliding on the bannister! The only thing Anthony P. Kirby has in common with these folks is he once upon a time played the harmonica, just like Alice's grandpa. Both Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold shine, respectively, as man enjoying life, with lots of friends, and a man out to make more money, at any price.A fireworks mishap lands both families in jail, and the press has a field day when they learn Anthony P. Kirby is in the clinck! Harry Davenport is wonderful as the wise judge they are brought before who does his best to straighten the mess out. The results are terrible, however, as Alice is hurt by Tony's family and runs away, refusing to let Tony know where she's at. She comes rushing back when word reaches her that her grandpa has given in to Kirby, and is selling their home.It is Kirby who will set things right in the end as his love for his son and a foreshadowing of his own future causes gradpa's words to sink in. You really can't take it with you, but you sure can play the harmonica! Even Tony's stuffy mom might loosen up a bit, if handled in the right way. The daughter-in-law they didn't want, with the family they didn't like, may just prove to be the best thing that ever happened to the Kirbys.Stewart and Arthur are great together, and Arthur is just magical in a couple of scenes. Eddie Anderson, Jack Benny's long-time sidekick, has a few fun moments also. No director ever straddled the line between the sweet and madcap better than Frank Capra, and this warm and wonderful film is proof of that.

Dixon,"[1, 1]","As apposed to the garbage that is paraded as ""movies"" today.It was made in a time when decency, morals, manners, chivalry, honor, character and righteousness reigned supreme. A time when Christian beliefs and principals was sewn into the very fabric of the most blessed nation that has every existed.Sadly, that is ALL gone now. And one of the reasons is: In THIS movie, the ""bad"" guy played by Lionel Barrymore was brought DOWN from his ""Ivory tower of Babel"" and ""Legend in his own mind"" by his own son (Jimmy Stewart).They don't make movies like that now; because America has sold its soul to satan; so there is NO decency, morals, manners, chivalry, honor, character or righteousness to be found; EXCEPT in a few dwindling places. Thus the arrogant, pompous ""goat"" that a man's son brought down; NOW reigns supreme; including most ""sons"" and ""daughters"" now; across the spectrum of this once mighty bastion of a righteous nation.For those of you that would love to be taken BACK to a time when ""goodness"" was the norm; and the ""bad"" were rebuked and punished; this is a movie for you.To go along with that: the video and sound is excellent; AND they did not mess with the original ""aspect"" ratio ""SD"" (4:3) and call it ""HD"" (16:9).

161775,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,0800114051,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[6, 6]","A fine Frank Capra comedy featuring Jimmy Stewart at his most boyish and gangly, and Jean Arthur as the girl of his dreams. It's a comedy of mismatched lovers: Stewart plays the son of a cold-hearted business tycoon (Edward Arnold) who looks forward to the coming world war as a way to make a killing on the stock market. In the path of Dad's capitalistic machinations lies a family of carefree bohemian kooks, whose open, life-affirming attitude holds together the neighborhood where Arnold hopes to build his next munitions factory. And guess what? Surprise...!! Jean Arthur's character also just happens to be the object of his son's affections. Into this ""Dharma & Greg""-like scenario, add Lionel Barrymore as her saintly, eccentric father, who was once a businessman but then dropped out and now spends his days smiling at life, following his passions, and encouraging others to do the same.In all honesty, although the film is charming, it isn't Capra's best work -- adapted from a stage play by George Kauffman and Moss Hart, it shouts out its kookiness, and has the feel of an off-Broadway production gone awry. The scenes that are meant to show how wacky her family is often play out too broadly, with shouting and grand gestures and a flurry of chaotic action -- dancing, xylophone playing, cooking, painting, newspaper rustling, fireworks going off -- and all of it happening at once.  It's too obvious and dramatically weak... Plus, Stewart really hasn't found his feet yet as a star actor. On the other hand, both Barrymore and Arnold give delightfully strong performances, and Jean Arthur is *always* easy on the eyes.  Even when slightly muddled, Capra is still better than practically anything coming out comedywise from Hollywood today.

This includes a ballet dancing sister and her xylophone playing brother-in-law, a grandfather who isn't more content than when he is playing his harmonica and taking pleasure in simpler things.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[20, 24]","""As near as I can see, the only thing you can take with you is the love of your friends.""The legendarily heartwarming Frank Capra tries out eccentricity for size in the enchanting ""You Can't Take it With You,"" a movie all about doing whatever makes you happy, not rich. While he's not quite in his element here (this is supposed to be really weird? Call Wes Anderson!), the talented cast and heartwarming message make this a truly enchanting, sweet movie.Megamogul Kirby (Edward Arnold) has bought out dozens of buildings for a new factory -- only one eccentric ""lily of the valley"" family refuse to sell their family house. What he doesn't know is that his dissatisfied son Tony (James Stewart) is madly in love with Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), the daughter of the family -- who also happens to be his secretary. And now they're engaged, although he hasn't broken the news to his parents yet.When Tony shows up to meet the future in-laws, he finds ballet in the kitchen, fireworks in the basement, and genial patriarch Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore ) ruling the house. But though he loves the way the Vanderhof clan lives, Tony isn't prepared for how his wealthy parents will react to them -- or how they will all be arrested. Wll the Vanderhofs lose their carefree way of life, or will Kirby start to realize that if you can't take it with you, it isn't any good?Frank Capra tried hard, but he was better at sentimentality than eccentricity. He just doesn't seem to know what a weird family looks like or quite how they'd act, or even HOW weird they should be on a regular daily basis. Capra introduces us to them through a timid clerk who decides ""The die is cast -- I'm a lily!"" and follows Grandpa home so the Vanderhofs can help him explore his ignored creative talents. Before long, he's joined the pack and is happily making fireworks.What makes this movie -- adapted from George S. Kaufman's stage play -- so enchanting is what Grandpa says in the jail cell: ""You can't take it with you, Mr. Kirby. So what good is it? As near as I can see, the only thing you can take with you is the love of your friends."" That warm'n'fuzzy little message rules the story, where the Vanderhofs devote all their available time to art, food, fun and friendship -- unlike the Biblical lilies of the field, they ""toil a little, spin a little, have a barrel of fun,"" in such a way that it makes you want to join them (even the lady who asks everybody ""Were you ever in a monastery?"").The film takes a darker turn in the last quarter, when the Vanderhofs appear to be leaving their beloved old house, Tony has lost Alice and soon quits his job at his father's corporation, and Mr. Kirby begins to wonder if his moneyed, powerful life really is empty -- and if he really doesn't have any friends. But don't expect the free-spirited Vanderhofs to be squashed by a corporate president, no matter how powerful he is.This was the first of Capra's collaborations with James Stewart, and Stewart is a shining bright spot even when he's the most normal one in the house -- albeit not the most eloquent (""Sometimes you're so beautiful it just gags me"").

I have no idea why it won a 1938 Best Picture Oscar, as it would never even be nominated nowadays. Of course, times were different then, but even so, it is simply not that good. It is filled with eye-rolling, oh-brother moments. For instance, Hollywood never used Anne Miller well, and here she is, attempting cringing ballet once again. She is out of place even in this screwball comedy. Here's another - a fancy restaurant scene is totally painful to watch, as it depends on a sign taped to Jean Arthur's back that everyone notices and laughs at, while our hero James Stewart, standing just behind her to a side, NEVER notices.  When he finally notices, does he remove it? No...they walk backwards to their table, knocking all sorts of things down.  Ha ha.  And he still doesn't remove it. He pretends later he is going to scream in the restaurant, so Jean Arthur screams in horror that he might scream and thereby causes the scene she wanted to avoid.  Ha ha.  Near the film's end, everything is solved because Anne Miller dances a ballet routine to...a xylophone and 2 harmonicas performed by the Grandpa character and the ""reformed"" villain of the story. This is just a ridiculous movie from start to finish.  The acting is okay but nothing extraordinary; however, folks who don't like the acting style of the 1930s probably should stay away.  At any rate, if you want to see a truly great James Stewart-Jean Arthur-Frank Capra film, skip this film and see ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" It is FAR superior and is more deserving of an Oscar than this film.I'll give it 3 stars simply for the talent involved, but I think only folks interested in film nostalgia will HONESTLY enjoy this film.

Grandfather Lionel Barrymore leads the family, a man with great respect for God and the ordinary man, as well as a great love for life and all the little joys it has to offer.  Barrymore is being pressured to sell his house to a big businessman, Edward Arnold, who is trying to buy all the surrounding property to build a factory.  Barrymore resists, but the problem is that his granddaughter Jean Arthur has fallen in love with Jimmy Stewart, the son of Arnold.  It all becomes the story of big business vs. the little guy, the rich vs. the ordinary man.  In other words, the typical conflicts of many of director Frank Capra's films.  The film starts off a little slowly, but picks up energy and steam as it goes along.  There are a number of terrific scenes, including Stewart and Arthur in the restaurant, the fireworks explosion, and the courtroom.  Stewart and Arthur give fine performances, but the film really belongs to Barrymore and Arnold, playing men with opposite viewpoints who basically want the same thing out of life.  Both of these great character actors deliver top, moving performances.

Maybe its because it was one of the last Capra classics I saw, or maybe I wasn't having a good day, but I just did not like it hardly at all.I really do like his other movies. Meet John Doe, Mr. Deeds, Wonderful Life, Happened one night, Arsenic, Mr Smith, etc. All really good, watchable, enjoyable movies.Then again, as a born again Christian, my world-view has changed dramatically since getting saved, and that may have something to do with my dislike of this picture. (But I recently watched Happened one night,  and I still liked it a lot.)So I don't know what it is. Maybe its because several of these cast members are more familiar to me in their other Capra movies. Jimmy Stewart is Mr. Smith, or George Baily. Jean Arthur is Clarissa Saunders, and Eddie Arnold is too much like Jim Taylor in Mr. Smith, and D. B. Norton in John Doe. Lionel Barrymore is simply Henry F. Potter, and that's all there is to it!

As funny as it is, the best part is that it is full of heart.""You Can't Take It With You"" is a delightful family film.  I have always felt that good comedy sets up best when the characters, not the lines, are funny.  This movie is a perfect example of this.The story is about two families that are poles apart in wealth and lifestyles.  The Kirbys is an affluent high class family that is never satisfied with what they have.  The Sycamores is an eccentric family that does whatever they want in order to be happy.  The members of this family include a mother who keeps writing a book, a daughter who dances all the time and a father trying out experiments in the basement (with explosive results).  These families come together because of a romance between Tony Kirby and Alice Sycamore.  Even though Tony loves Alice's family and thinks they are wonderful-the two are driven apart.James Stewart, as Tony Kirby, is brilliant.  His comedy timing and mannerisms are perfect.  The interaction between the characters-the situations they find themselves-are so much fun to watch.  Lionel Barrymore as well portrayed the grandfather with heart and passion.Frank Capra, well known for directing ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and others, did a superb job of bringing this story-originally a play-to the screen.  It is fast-paced, with perfect timing and wonderful to watch.A great movie to watch as a family and learn an important message.

Lionel Barrymore is superb as the nominal patriarch of a bunch of eccentric free souls, who, long before the 60s and its ""tune in, turn on, drop out,"" message, basically had the same idea back in 40s era Manhattan in this very funny movie. It's interesting that Barrymore plays the anti-capitalist here when he played the wealthy and greedy Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life, again with Jimmy Stewart. The residents of this looney bin pursue various hobbies including dancing, playing the xylophone, writing plays, making scary rubber masks, and producing spectacular fireworks in the basement--which are always going off--lending various pops, bangs, and whooshes to the already pretty zany ambience of the place.When the son of a stuffy but very wealthy Wall St. financier (played by Edward Arnold who is perfect in this role) falls for Barrymore's granddaughter, the stage is set for a confrontation between the two families and their contrasting lifestyles--money and status vs. being true to yourself and doing your own thing. But despite the father and mother's disapproval, love wins out in the end. I note some of the reviewers here didn't like the movie and preferred the stage play.

161805,A2BHWOS5PUGU78,0800114051,Mercy Bell,"[4, 5]","This is one of my very favorite Capra movies, somewhere along with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""It Happened One Night"", in fact it's a blending of those two films. This film is a real pleasure to watch from top to bottom. It portrays one of the best and most unmanufactured eccentric families ever to exist on screen. Lionel Barrymore steals the show as a grandfather abounding with grace, wisdom, and humor; the patriarch to a crazy clan who've discovered the secret to living a happy life: be yourself and be free, and material things don't matter so much as people do.This film is full of that joy of life that Capra instills in his work. Like almost all his films it portrays a group of idealistic, independent, and good people in an intensely cynical and embittered world. And like almost all his films the idealists gets battered and bruised along the way, but eventually come out on top. Everything about this film is earnest and sincere, from the hopeful life affirming themes to the sweet romance between graceful and strong Alice (Jean Arthur) and free thinking, rebellious brahmin banker's son Tony (a very young and charming Jimmy Stewart).The spirit and conflict of the film comes from the clash between Tony's stuck up and snobby aristocratic family and Alice's completly oblivious but adoring freewheeling lower class bohemian one. Tony's folks hate Alice, but Alice's folks love Tony. And Tony and Alice are crazy for each other, although Alice wants approval from his people, and he would love to run off and live in the woods with her tribe. This provides fertile soil for Capra's great ability to render comedy, a soaring social commentary, and also have time for some of those heartwarming, glowing dramatic moments. What you get on the other end is a natural, flowing, glowing, quirky ensemble romance flick with a higher message free of pretense, arrogance, and ""fakeness"", superbly crafted only the way a true master can.",5,Sweet 'n sassy ode to life as it should be,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,1944,"['one', 'very', 'favorite', 'Capra', 'movies', 'somewhere', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'fact', 'blending', 'two', 'films', 'film', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'top', 'bottom', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'unmanufactured', 'eccentric', 'families', 'ever', 'exist', 'screen', 'Lionel', 'steals', 'show', 'grandfather', 'abounding', 'grace', 'wisdom', 'humor', 'patriarch', 'crazy', 'clan', 'who', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'secret', 'living', 'happy', 'life', 'be', 'be', 'free', 'material', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'people', 'do.This', 'film', 'full', 'joy', 'life', 'Capra', 'instills', 'work', 'almost', 'films', 'group', 'idealistic', 'independent', 'good', 'people', 'intensely', 'cynical', 'embittered', 'world', 'almost', 'films', 'idealists', 'battered', 'bruised', 'way', 'eventually', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'Everything', 'film', 'earnest', 'sincere', 'hopeful', 'life', 'affirming', 'themes', 'sweet', 'romance', 'graceful', 'strong', 'Alice', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'free', 'thinking', 'rebellious', 'brahmin', 'banker', 'son', 'Tony', 'very', 'young', 'charming', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', '.The', 'spirit', 'conflict', 'film', 'clash', 'Tony', 'stuck', 'up', 'snobby', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'Alice', 'completly', 'oblivious', 'adoring', 'freewheeling', 'lower', 'class', 'bohemian', 'one', 'Tony', 'folks', 'hate', 'Alice', 'Alice', 'folks', 'love', 'Tony', 'Tony', 'Alice', 'are', 'crazy', 'other', 'Alice', 'approval', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'run', 'off', 'live', 'woods', 'tribe', 'fertile', 'soil', 'Capra', 'great', 'ability', 'render', 'comedy', 'soaring', 'social', 'commentary', 'also', 'have', 'time', 'heartwarming', 'glowing', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'What', 'get', 'other', 'end', 'natural', 'flowing', 'glowing', 'quirky', 'ensemble', 'romance', 'flick', 'higher', 'message', 'free', 'pretense', 'arrogance', 'fakeness', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'only', 'way', 'true', 'master', 'can']",You Can't Take It With You VHS

161808,A1FG91CM8221X1,0800114051,Miles D. Moore,"[6, 7]","I can just see it now: peppy, confident little Frank Capra, going up to tall, dyspeptic George S. Kaufman with a big smile on his face. ""Well, George,"" Capra says, ""what do you think of my movie version of `You Can't Take It With You?'"" Kaufman slowly removes his glasses and looks at Capra like a side of creamed spinach he hadn't ordered. ""Mr. Capra,"" Kaufman says, ""not much."" Despite what Kaufman and his partner Moss Hart must have thought, however, I love the version of ""You Can't Take It With You"" that Capra and his regular screenwriter Robert Riskin concocted. Certainly Capra and Riskin take enormous liberties with the Kaufman & Hart original; they create new characters and jettison others (goodbye Grand Duchess Olga, hello Mr. Poppins); they introduce the income tax subplot with Grandpa Vanderhof, then abruptly drop it; and, above all, they add all the little-man glorification that was the Capra trademark, and absolutely antithetical to the airy lightness of the Kaufman esthetic. And yet I find I like Capra's conception at least as well as Kaufman's. For one thing, Capra was as masterful in staging gags as Kaufman was, and perhaps even better at telling a story; the Capra movie is totally engrossing throughout its two-hour-plus running time. For another, Capra knew how to direct actors, and to attract the very best actors to his projects. The Capra ""You Can't Take It With You"" has an incredibly brilliant cast, with all the actors working at the top of their game. Lionel Barrymore was superb at playing hateful old curmudgeons, as he proved in ""It's a Wonderful Life;"" he was even better at playing lovable old codgers, and his Grandpa Vanderhof is a marvel. You also have the outstanding romantic chemistry of the great James Stewart and the incomparable Jean Arthur, she of the Noble Roman beauty and endearingly froggy voice; the great Edward Arnold, playing his specialty--a smug fat cat--with conviction and aplomb; and a positive cornucopia of wonderful character actors including Mischa Auer, Spring Byington, the sprightly Ann Miller (was she REALLY only 15 when she made this movie?), the ineffable Dub Taylor (30 years before Bonnie & Clyde), and the aptly named Donald Meek. If Kaufman's version was the precursor of Neil Simon and the better sitcoms (Cheers, The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Capra is more like a prototype John Irving (though merely flirting with tragedy, rather than embracing it). Kaufman won the Pulitzer, Capra the Oscar, and all I can say is that they both deserved them. I have seen two TV versions of the original Kaufman-Hart play: one with Art Carney and Jean Stapleton, the other (a taping of a 1980s Broadway revival) with Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst.

Lionel Barrymore is engaging as the Patriarch of the unconventional family that provides the comic (and moral) clash with the banking family.  After awhile, though, his charm began to pall a little.  The banker and resident stuffed shirt and bad guy is well played by Edward Arnold who does seem to rescue the character from being a complete cliche.  Poor Ann Miller, who really was a good dancer, was forced to play a silly girl who prances around in her toe shoes to the accompaniment of her husband who plays Chopin on the xylophone.  This is supposed to be really ""zany"" fun stuff.  Likewise the other residents of the ""fun"" house.  Perhaps this really was funny in 1938 but I can't think of anyone over the age of 10 who would be amused by all of the ""hilarious hi-jinks"" nowadays.Cliche is piled on cliche, with the good-nicks, who are against paying taxes and working for a living are supposed to be our heroes while the banker and his snobby wife are the ones we are supposed to hate.  All the bankers are old, white haired men and the treatment of the Black couple will really make you cringe.

161819,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,0800114051,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[2, 2]","This is a movie version of another successful play on Broadway performed during 1936-1938 season. Frank Capra received the best director award from the Academy in recognition of his superb work, and the film also won in the best movie category.During the post-depression era, Hollywood was obsessed with making movies that poked at the rich and famous, especially those who lived lavishly through banking and investments in stock market, some of whom were responsible for economic depression, and large scale unemployment that followed. There is a long list of movies casting some of the best from Hollywood, and Jimmy Stewart and Lionel Barrymore are two players who have made such movies. This is a comedy-drama of two families pitted against each other during the post-depression years (1938). One is poor, down to earth eccentric family; and another, a rich family who are concerned about their wealth and social status. Lionel Barrymore offers a brilliant performance as Grandpa Martin Vanderhof, as the head of a poor family, and Jean Arthur offers another splendid performance as his grand daughter Alice Sycamore, who is independent, with her own mind and in love with a rich young man, named Tony Kirby (Jimmy Stewart). Penny does not think much of the differences in their social status, and so is Tony, but when his parents meet Vanderhof's extended family, things turn into a very ugly surprise, and they all end of in jail!The members of Vanderhof family are a strange bunch of characters with peculiar hobbies and interests. Grandpa Vanderhof doesn't believe in paying income taxes to IRS, and his only daughter, Penny Sycamore (Spring Byington), a lovable, down-to-earth character writes unpublished plays, and her husband Paul Sycamore (Samuel Hinds) experiments with fireworks often with mild explosions: All these consequences taken with a smile and humor! Adorable Ann Miller plays the second grand daughter Essie Carmichael who aspires to be a ballerina, and her husband Ed Carmichael (Dub Taylor) plays xylophone.When Anthony Kirby (Edward Arnold) buys out dozens of buildings for a new factory in the Vanderhof's neighborhood, Grandpa refuses to sell his home, but later he decides to leave his home. In the mean time, Tony after losing Alice, who is staying her relatives in Connecticut, quits his job at his father's corporation, and Mr. Kirby begins to wonder if his life is really is empty, and if he really has true friends. In the end all ends well after some fine drama in the court.My favorite scenes in the film are; when Tony proposes to Alice indirectly, when he says, ""Scratch hard enough and you'll find a proposal,"" and when they start dancing with the neighborhood kids and start running when the neighborhood cop shows up. The most hilarious scene is when the house catches fire when fire crackers accidentally ignite, and in the next scene they all will be in jail. George Kaufman and Moss Hart wrote this film, and their fine work was honored with a nod from the Academy during the nominating process in the best writing category. Another interesting story is that during this film, Lionel Barrymore experienced the effects of arthritis and director Capra had his leg put in a cast and made him walk on crutches, which I thought was a nice touch. Screenwriter Robert Riskin also created a new character for the film, Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek), who becomes a permanent house guest of Vanderhof's family after quitting his job at a printing shop, and pursue his dream of making toys and masks. Director Frank Capra is a master of making movies in which a little guy stand up against the big in the society, and eventually win: This is evident in some of his most successful movies. It is also a bit of change in the direction of his cast, because in Capra's wildly successful Christmas classic, It's a wonderful life, Barrymore is the wealthy banker who tries to take advantage of Jimmy Stewart's character during his financial turmoil. It is nice to see Barrymore plays an adorable old man. This film was James Stewart's first and Jean Arthur's second film with Frank Capra. The following year, they would do their second and last film together, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. As all fans know that there is always a powerful message hidden in all Capra movies and the take-home message in this film is that you can't take your wealth with you, but you can always have the love and warmth of a loving family and good friends.1.It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition)2.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington3.Only Angels Have Wings4.Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (Remastered)5.Dinner at Eight6.Holiday7.Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack (Three Smart Girls / Something In the Wind / First Love / It Started with Eve / Can't Help Singing / Lady on a Train)",5,First Frank Capra -

161821,A281NPSIMI1C2R,0800114051,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[33, 38]","Recently, I found this movie at my aunt's home and decided to make a go of watching it even though it is black & white. The truth is, soon you absolutely forget that fact and become quite absorbed watching some of the most colorful free spirits you will ever see in an ""old"" movie.Frank Capra once described a play he saw ""whose witchery was so entrancing, wild horses couldn't have dragged me away from the final curtain.""This was of course ""You Can't Take it With You."" The Kaufman-Hart play. In fact, this movie is a bit like a play in some scenes.The story centers around two families. One rich, one poor. The rich family is of course a threat to the entire community as they want to buy up the poor families homes so they can build a factory.In the middle of this business deal, two people fall in love. Tony is the son of a rich businessman and Alice is the only working member of a rather eccentric family.Alice (Jean Arthur) and Tony (Jimmy Stewart) have a warm chemistry that makes you just fall in love with them both and you want them to be together. Of course Tony's snooty mother is as cold as ice and his father is about to make the deal of his life, yet conflicted.Alice's family is a mismatch of creative energy and is the basis for the humor in this story. When Tony takes his parents to Alice's home on the wrong night for dinner, the real fun begins. Just when you think the story can't get any worse for Tony's parents, it gets even more amusing. I laughed out loud plenty of times and it was so unexpected, but well worth the wait. The start of the movie is a little drab, but make yourself plow through the first bit.In the first few scenes in Alice's home, there is a cat. Oh, look for that cat. It is adorable! It is sitting atop the pile of papers next to the typewriter and just as it is getting comfortable, Alice's mother picks up the cat and uses it as a paperweight of sorts to hold down the pile of papers. Anyway, it is quite cute.During the production, Lionel Barrymore was suffering from arthritis, and needed crutches to move around. They worked this nicely into the movie by claiming the character sprained his ankle sliding down the banister. Lionel will have you rolling on the floor yourself as he deals with a very frustrated IRS man and bring you close to tears as he plays the harmonica with his newest friend.A movie everyone should see because it deals with such very human ideas, and well...it is also just hilarious!A timeless classic!~The Rebecca Review",5,Heartwarming Comedy,1031702400,"09 11, 2002",2002,2500,"['Recently', 'found', 'movie', 'aunt', 'home', 'decided', 'make', 'go', 'watching', 'even', 'black', 'white', 'truth', 'soon', 'absolutely', 'forget', 'fact', 'become', 'quite', 'absorbed', 'watching', 'most', 'colorful', 'free', 'spirits', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'old', 'movie.Frank', 'Capra', 'once', 'described', 'play', 'saw', 'witchery', 'was', 'so', 'entrancing', 'wild', 'horses', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'dragged', 'away', 'final', 'curtain', 'was', 'course', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Kaufman-Hart', 'play', 'fact', 'movie', 'bit', 'play', 'scenes.The', 'story', 'centers', 'two', 'families', 'One', 'rich', 'one', 'poor', 'rich', 'family', 'course', 'threat', 'entire', 'community', 'want', 'buy', 'up', 'poor', 'families', 'homes', 'can', 'build', 'factory.In', 'middle', 'business', 'deal', 'two', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'Tony', 'son', 'rich', 'businessman', 'Alice', 'only', 'working', 'member', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'family.Alice', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Tony', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'have', 'warm', 'chemistry', 'just', 'fall', 'love', 'want', 'be', 'together', 'course', 'Tony', 'snooty', 'mother', 'as', 'cold', 'ice', 'father', 'make', 'deal', 'life', 'conflicted.Alice', 'family', 'mismatch', 'creative', 'energy', 'basis', 'humor', 'story', 'When', 'Tony', 'parents', 'Alice', 'home', 'wrong', 'night', 'dinner', 'real', 'fun', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'Tony', 'parents', 'even', 'more', 'amusing', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'plenty', 'times', 'was', 'so', 'unexpected', 'well', 'wait', 'start', 'movie', 'little', 'drab', 'make', 'plow', 'first', 'bit.In', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'Alice', 'home', 'cat', 'Oh', 'look', 'cat', 'adorable', 'sitting', 'pile', 'papers', 'typewriter', 'just', 'getting', 'comfortable', 'Alice', 'mother', 'up', 'cat', 'paperweight', 'sorts', 'hold', 'down', 'pile', 'papers', 'Anyway', 'quite', 'cute.During', 'production', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'suffering', 'arthritis', 'needed', 'crutches', 'move', 'around', 'worked', 'nicely', 'movie', 'claiming', 'character', 'sprained', 'ankle', 'sliding', 'down', 'banister', 'Lionel', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'floor', 'very', 'frustrated', 'IRS', 'man', 'bring', 'close', 'tears', 'harmonica', 'newest', 'friend.A', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'such', 'very', 'human', 'ideas', 'well', 'also', 'just', 'hilarious', 'timeless', 'classic', '~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",You Can't Take It With You VHS

161825,AEXGGB9P0MOTN,0800114051,"Sarah Hadley ""I'm a graduate student and Engl...","[2, 3]","I've come upon this film so many times on TV, it's nearly ridiculous. Unfortunately, each and every time, I've come in more than halfway through the picture, thus rendering it rather pointless to stop and watch. When I saw the DVD at the library this past weekend, though, I decided it was time to take the plunge and finally watch ""You Can't Take it With You"" for real. I'm glad I did.If I sit back and think of Frank Capra pictures, I usually come up with the image of an ""American experience"" movie: well-intentioned, pleasing, grass-roots common-people patriotic, and sometimes a little overzealous. This film is no exception, but it's rather different from the Capra films most people remember - ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" of course, and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" - in that it's far more comedic. To the modern viewer, that might seem like a strike against it; even I'm a bit skittish with the ""controlled chaos"" aspect of 1930s comedy. However, the bulk of the film is so sweet, so idealistic, and so good-naturedly funny it's impossible to dislike. And underneath it all, there's a message that still applies today: money is the root of all evil. Or, as the characters would be more likely to put it, money's not the point of living.It's a simple setup. There's a wacky family, all engaged in their own hobbies and small moneymaking endeavors, who live in a big house presided over by Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore). Vanderhof is the only guy in town to resist takeover by the monopolizing banker Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold), but little does he know that his granddaughter (Jean Arthur) is seriously involved with Kirby's son (Jimmy Stewart). You can see where this is going, right? Simple American folk bungle their attempts to impress the rich future in-laws, while at the same time holding onto their values? Big businessman's cold heart is slowly but surely melted by honesty and happiness? Right, you've got it. No surprises here. It's all been done before, will all be done again, and in this case, it's a Pulitzer Prize-winning play - which are often moralistic to begin with - adapted and actually made more populist by that most moral of directors, Frank Capra. It feels like a play, sometimes to its detriment, and on occasion it feels like a moral tract. But it's a very entertaining one at that.The joy of the film lies in the great characters. Everyone gets something to do, which is quite rare with a cast of some twenty individually-defined characters. Jimmy Stewart, of course, makes a great impression by sheer screen presence, even though he's one of the simpler, more obvious characters; at the same time, though, Harry Davenport (a very recognizable character actor), is just as memorable in a single scene. The standout performance is by Lionel Barrymore, and if you only know him as Mr Potter of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" you've got a surprise coming. He steals whole scenes with quiet speeches and folksy humor; an early one, with the bank clerk Mr Poppins, is just possibly the highlight of the whole film. If you ever catch the start of the film but can't sit through it all, make sure you experience that scene, at least. It's magical.The film is not without flaws, of course. Capra greatly restructured the second half of the play to fit his own pet themes, and it does feel like a sudden shift in tone. It also makes the film about twenty minutes too long, with what seems like a false ending - and then, oh wait, there's more. And while the family's various hobbies and tricks are all very entertaining, they do wear out the third or fourth time we're trotted through them. But it's a fairly minor quibble...I do heartily recommend the film, because even if it is a bit too long or a bit too moral, there's so much to enjoy it almost doesn't matter. It's nice to occasionally see a movie so irrepressibly idealistic and optimistic, and I challenge you not to finish watching the film without a big ol' happy grin on your face!",5,For when you need a bit of optimism...,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,3975,"[""'ve"", 'come', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'TV', 'nearly', 'ridiculous', 'Unfortunately', 'time', ""'ve"", 'come', 'more', 'halfway', 'picture', 'thus', 'rendering', 'rather', 'pointless', 'stop', 'watch', 'When', 'saw', 'DVD', 'library', 'past', 'weekend', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'take', 'plunge', 'finally', 'watch', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'real', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.If', 'sit', 'back', 'think', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'usually', 'come', 'up', 'image', 'American', 'experience', 'movie', 'well-intentioned', 'pleasing', 'grass-roots', 'common-people', 'patriotic', 'sometimes', 'little', 'overzealous', 'film', 'exception', 'rather', 'different', 'Capra', 'films', 'most', 'people', 'remember', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'course', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'far', 'more', 'comedic', 'modern', 'viewer', 'might', 'seem', 'strike', 'even', ""'m"", 'bit', 'skittish', 'controlled', 'chaos', 'aspect', '1930s', 'comedy', 'However', 'bulk', 'film', 'so', 'sweet', 'so', 'idealistic', 'so', 'good-naturedly', 'funny', 'impossible', 'dislike', 'message', 'still', 'today', 'money', 'root', 'evil', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'put', 'money', 'not', 'point', 'living.It', 'simple', 'setup', 'wacky', 'family', 'engaged', 'own', 'hobbies', 'small', 'moneymaking', 'endeavors', 'who', 'live', 'big', 'house', 'presided', 'Grandpa', 'Vanderhof', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Vanderhof', 'only', 'guy', 'town', 'resist', 'takeover', 'monopolizing', 'banker', 'Anthony', 'P.', 'Kirby', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'little', 'know', 'granddaughter', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'seriously', 'involved', 'Kirby', 'son', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'right', 'Simple', 'American', 'folk', 'bungle', 'attempts', 'impress', 'rich', 'future', 'in-laws', 'same', 'time', 'holding', 'values', 'Big', 'businessman', 'cold', 'heart', 'slowly', 'surely', 'melted', 'honesty', 'happiness', 'Right', ""'ve"", 'got', 'surprises', 'here', 'been', 'done', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'again', 'case', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'play', 'are', 'often', 'moralistic', 'begin', 'adapted', 'actually', 'made', 'more', 'populist', 'most', 'moral', 'directors', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'play', 'sometimes', 'detriment', 'occasion', 'moral', 'tract', 'very', 'entertaining', 'one', 'that.The', 'joy', 'film', 'great', 'characters', 'Everyone', 'something', 'do', 'quite', 'rare', 'cast', 'twenty', 'individually-defined', 'characters', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'course', 'great', 'impression', 'sheer', 'screen', 'presence', 'even', 'one', 'simpler', 'more', 'obvious', 'characters', 'same', 'time', 'though', 'Harry', 'Davenport', 'very', 'recognizable', 'character', 'actor', 'just', 'memorable', 'single', 'scene', 'standout', 'performance', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'only', 'know', 'Mr', 'Potter', 'Wonderful', 'Life', ""'ve"", 'got', 'surprise', 'coming', 'whole', 'scenes', 'quiet', 'speeches', 'folksy', 'humor', 'early', 'one', 'bank', 'clerk', 'Mr', 'Poppins', 'just', 'possibly', 'highlight', 'whole', 'film', 'ever', 'catch', 'start', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'make', 'sure', 'experience', 'scene', 'least', 'magical.The', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'course', 'Capra', 'greatly', 'restructured', 'second', 'half', 'play', 'fit', 'own', 'pet', 'themes', 'feel', 'sudden', 'shift', 'tone', 'also', 'film', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'what', 'false', 'ending', 'then', 'oh', 'wait', 'more', 'family', 'various', 'hobbies', 'tricks', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'do', 'wear', 'out', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', ""'re"", 'trotted', 'fairly', 'minor', 'quibble', 'do', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'film', 'even', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'bit', 'too', 'moral', 'so', 'much', 'enjoy', 'almost', ""n't"", 'matter', 'nice', 'occasionally', 'see', 'movie', 'so', 'irrepressibly', 'idealistic', 'optimistic', 'challenge', 'not', 'finish', 'watching', 'film', 'big', 'ol', 'happy', 'grin', 'face']",You Can't Take It With You VHS

161832,AK61LQI92GTCH,0800114051,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[4, 15]","Winner of two Academy Awards in 1939 (Best Picture, Best Director - Frank Capra), based upon a Pulitzer Prize winning play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, boasting a stellar cast, I was more than a little disappointed that I found myself immune to YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU's charms. I really did much care for this movie.Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur play a pair of young lovebirds related to a pair of bickering elders.  Edward Arnold plays Stewart's father, a heartless industrialist who is building the largest monopoly in history if only he can buy a small lot owned by Arthur's eccentric grandfather Lionel Barrymore.Barrymore plays a man who dropped out of the business world thirty-odd years ago to stop and smell the roses.  Arnold's character is ruthless.The movie busies itself with the Stewart/Arthur romance, the education of Arnold's character, and takes every chance it can to allow Barrymore to dispense some homespun wisdom. For my money, Barrymore's brood is a little too eccentric, Edward Arnold is a little too cutthroat.My favorite scene also contained a bit that drove me to distraction.  An IRS comes to Barrymore's coveted house.  Barrymore hasn't paid his income tax for years.  The agent tries to convince Barrymore that he has to pay, while Barrymore parries with variations on ""What does that money buy me?""  In the meantime, granddaughter Ann Miller pirouettes poorly about the room, Spring Byington works on her play, Dub Taylor plays Mozart on the xylophones, and the boys in the basement are messing around with their home made fireworks.  Arnold and wife and son arrive.  They were supposed to meet Arthur's family tomorrow, so they're a day early.Edward Arnold was an excellent actor, and he played the stuffed shirt as good as anybody.  It's fun to watch his dignity assaulted time after time in this scene.  What isn't so much fun is listening to Barrymore drone on and on with his ostensibly homespun variations on ""Why should I pay taxes?""  It's supposed to be funny, I suppose, but in reality federal marshals would have run him in long before the frustrated IRS agent arrived.  Barrymore is allowed to rant, but the movie doesn't make him pay the consequences for his opposition.  In other words, the Barrymore character seemed phony to me, and that severely affected my entire reaction to this movie.This movie also shifts the point of view fairly frequently.  I think Capra was more effective when he narrow his sights to a single character.  It's a lot easier to get emotionally involved with a George Bailey or a John Doe when the great majority of events is filtered through them.So, with some disappointment, I gave this movie three stars.

Jimmy is the son of a powerful banker, bent on buying up a block of homes in order to a build a factory which will increase his wealth. Jean is his secretary, and as it turns out, lives in the only house on the block that is holding out on the deal. Lionel Barrymore plays her grandfather; a simple man who gave up working years earlier because he did not enjoy it, and completely opposed to selling the house - for the memories he has for it still linger; and that of his dead wife compel him to hold on to it. Values like these are amply expressed in the movie. Among the eccentric people living in this house are Spring Byington, who plays Jean's mother. She writes play after play, after play. Dub Talyor is xylophone player who likes to write things. Ann Miller is his wife. She enjoys tap. Donald Meek joins the family, and his favorite hobby is &quot;making things up&quot;; little monster masks, and wind up musical boxes that pop up.And when all these zany people come together in this eccentric home, the fun and mahem really begins.&quot;You can't Take it With You&quot; is a true delight to come out of the golden age of movies.

Lord, is 'You Can't Take It With You' corny.And dated.I wont argue that many of this Capra classic'ssensibilities haven't slipped from vogue.  But kids,this is an old movie starring a lot of famous oldactors that you might want to check out.  It's abouta family of eccentrics living together in a singlehouse and behaving like a truckload of Looney Tunescharacters let out on loan from the Warner Brothersstudios.  They don't fret money. They don't fretmores. They don't fret the authorities. They don'tgive a hoot about appearances.  In fact, they don'tdo much of anything, other than what they feel likedoing, which is usually nothing that'll help anyone,not even themselves.I'm willing to admit that even as a fable it's not avery practical, pragmatic, or mature message to imparton a child.  But impart it on yours anyway.  Just abouteverything else kids meet in this world will teach themto be pragmatic, sensible, even calculating, quickenough.I think every ten-year old kid should see this movie(and 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington', and 'Meet JohnDoe').  Parents, wrestle those young'uns away fromblowing things up on their video console, or fromwatching things get blown up on television, and forcethem to watch this flick.  If they're too jaded by ageten, then show it to 'em when they're nine, or eight.Heck, beam it at 'em 'in utero'.The collective message of Frank Capra's films isfrequently misidentified by his critics as a belief thathuman beings are all inherently good, and will do goodif given the chance.  Such critics like to point out howdangerously naive that belief is (and they're right),but Capra's message is more subtle than that: that anycommunity--a town, a country, or a family--can andshould be based around an unwavering doctrine ofunconditional compassion.  Once you have that, you'reprotected from this oh-so pragmatic, sensible, andcalculating world.SIDE NOTE: Jean Arthur was the greatest celluloidcombination of knockout sex appeal, smarts, and comicability ever, and young girls looking for better rolemodels than the narcissistic twits personified on filmthese days by the likes of Cameron Diaz and Julie Robertsshould check her out in this and other Capra classics.",4,On My List Of Favorite Overlooked Films.,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,2222,"['May', '2', '2002Corny', 'Lord', ""'You"", 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'corny.And', 'dated.I', 'wont', 'argue', 'many', 'Capra', ""classic'ssensibilities"", 'have', ""n't"", 'slipped', 'vogue', 'kids', 'old', 'movie', 'starring', 'lot', 'famous', 'oldactors', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'abouta', 'family', 'eccentrics', 'living', 'together', 'singlehouse', 'behaving', 'truckload', 'Looney', 'Tunescharacters', 'let', 'out', 'loan', 'Warner', 'Brothersstudios', 'do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'fretmores', 'do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'authorities', ""don'tgive"", 'hoot', 'appearances', 'fact', ""don'tdo"", 'much', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'feel', 'likedoing', 'usually', 'nothing', ""'ll"", 'help', 'anyone', 'not', 'even', 'themselves.I', ""'m"", 'willing', 'admit', 'even', 'fable', 'not', 'avery', 'practical', 'pragmatic', 'mature', 'message', 'imparton', 'child', 'impart', 'yours', 'anyway', 'Just', 'abouteverything', 'else', 'kids', 'meet', 'world', 'will', 'teach', 'themto', 'be', 'pragmatic', 'sensible', 'even', 'calculating', 'quickenough.I', 'think', 'ten-year', 'old', 'kid', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'JohnDoe', 'Parents', 'wrestle', ""young'uns"", 'away', 'fromblowing', 'things', 'up', 'video', 'console', 'fromwatching', 'things', 'get', 'blown', 'up', 'television', 'forcethem', 'watch', 'flick', ""'re"", 'too', 'jaded', 'ageten', 'then', 'show', ""'em"", 'when', ""'re"", 'nine', 'eight.Heck', 'beam', ""'in"", ""utero'.The"", 'collective', 'message', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'films', 'isfrequently', 'misidentified', 'critics', 'belief', 'thathuman', 'beings', 'are', 'inherently', 'good', 'will', 'do', 'goodif', 'given', 'chance', 'Such', 'critics', 'point', 'out', 'howdangerously', 'naive', 'belief', ""'re"", 'right', 'Capra', 'message', 'more', 'subtle', 'anycommunity', 'town', 'country', 'family', 'can', 'andshould', 'be', 'based', 'unwavering', 'doctrine', 'ofunconditional', 'compassion', 'Once', 'have', ""you'reprotected"", 'oh-so', 'pragmatic', 'sensible', 'andcalculating', 'world.SIDE', 'NOTE', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'was', 'greatest', 'celluloidcombination', 'knockout', 'sex', 'appeal', 'smarts', 'comicability', 'ever', 'young', 'girls', 'looking', 'better', 'rolemodels', 'narcissistic', 'twits', 'personified', 'filmthese', 'days', 'likes', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Julie', 'Robertsshould', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'Capra', 'classics']",You Can't Take It With You VHS
