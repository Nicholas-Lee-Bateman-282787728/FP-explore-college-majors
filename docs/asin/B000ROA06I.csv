1083329,A3ENQW5RR9WBDS,B000ROA06I,Anna Bates,"[24, 24]","This is a challenging workout.  Please do not buy this if you are not able to do high impact moves.  This workout is fast, very fast for step aerobics, and all of the moves are propulsion moves.  All of them.  This woman bounces with every step.  Kelly is energetic, very good at what she does, and the workout is a probably great for people who already know how to  kick-box and do advanced step aerobics.  However, I do step aerobics because I have a bad knee, and can not do any high impact moves.  I did this work-out once, working to modify each move.  However, that is a lot of trouble, and it makes more sense to simply buy a DVD with a step routine that I can do.",3,"High impact, not for everyone",1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,671,"['challenging', 'workout', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'do', 'high', 'impact', 'moves', 'workout', 'fast', 'very', 'fast', 'step', 'aerobics', 'moves', 'are', 'propulsion', 'moves', 'woman', 'step', 'Kelly', 'energetic', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'workout', 'probably', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'kick-box', 'do', 'advanced', 'step', 'aerobics', 'However', 'do', 'step', 'aerobics', 'have', 'bad', 'knee', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'high', 'impact', 'moves', 'did', 'work-out', 'once', 'working', 'modify', 'move', 'However', 'lot', 'trouble', 'more', 'sense', 'simply', 'buy', 'DVD', 'step', 'routine', 'can', 'do']",Kelly Coffey-Meyer: Step Boxing Workout

I do this video a lot and will continue it forever! :)  It has high and low impact options.  Anyone can do it because there isn't much in the cheoreography area.  Kelly is not big into that.  You will love it too!,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,285,"['love', 'step', 'love', 'kick-boxing', 'Who', 'knew', 'put', 'two', 'together', 'do', 'video', 'lot', 'will', 'continue', 'forever', 'high', 'low', 'impact', 'options', 'Anyone', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'cheoreography', 'area', 'Kelly', 'not', 'big', 'will', 'love', 'too']",Kelly Coffey-Meyer: Step Boxing Workout
1083331,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000ROA06I,Little Miss Cutey,"[12, 12]","This is my first workout by Kelly.  She's a great instructor, - outgoing and fun and very fit.  She never slows down even to give the cues; she does it pretty effortlessly.This is really a combination of step aerobics and kickboxing and so you can imagine that this is intense.  You burn fat and drip sweat from start to finish.  Within regular step movements, you are doing kickboxing type moves (ie punches and jabs and kicks).  There is an aerobic/toning portion and that is tough because your heart stays elevated because it's done at a fairly fast speed and intensity.  After you've done this workout a couple of times it definately gets a little easier, but I tell you that if you stick to it, it will give you results for sure.Based on this workout, I'll definately buy more dvds of Kellys.  She's good at what she does and she makes this fun even though you're continuously working hard.  I really like this one.",5,Different yet fun and effective :-),1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,920,"['first', 'workout', 'Kelly', 'great', 'instructor', 'outgoing', 'fun', 'very', 'fit', 'never', 'down', 'even', 'give', 'cues', 'pretty', 'effortlessly.This', 'really', 'combination', 'step', 'aerobics', 'kickboxing', 'so', 'can', 'imagine', 'intense', 'burn', 'fat', 'drip', 'sweat', 'start', 'finish', 'regular', 'step', 'movements', 'are', 'doing', 'kickboxing', 'type', 'moves', 'ie', 'punches', 'jabs', 'kicks', 'aerobic/toning', 'portion', 'tough', 'heart', 'elevated', 'done', 'fairly', 'fast', 'speed', 'intensity', ""'ve"", 'done', 'workout', 'couple', 'times', 'definately', 'little', 'easier', 'tell', 'stick', 'will', 'give', 'results', 'sure.Based', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'definately', 'buy', 'more', 'dvds', 'Kellys', 'good', 'what', 'fun', 'even', ""'re"", 'continuously', 'working', 'hard', 'really', 'one']",Kelly Coffey-Meyer: Step Boxing Workout

1083333,A19XC6Z95GK5AB,B000ROA06I,"Nancy Loderick ""Internet strategist""","[1, 1]","I love this workout!  Kelly is the most energetic instructor I've seen (and I have over 100 workout DVDs from the likes of Cathe Friedrich, Amy Bento and Tracey Staehle).This workout is not for the faint of heart though.  The music has a very fast beat and Kelly doesn't spend a lot of time breaking down the moves.  She will show a few steps of the routine and then build from there.  This is exactly how I like to learn new steps.I didn't think this routine was particularly high impact, like some of the other reviewers.  You could always lower your step height to one riser on each side, or even no risers, if you wanted less impact.  One of the background exercisers is showing lower impact modifications as well.I consider this workout was more of a step routine, with a few kickboxing moves thrown in.  It's still fun.  The quick weight routine at the end was a nice way to keep your heart rate up too.  I normally don't like this type of weight work, but it's nice for a change.I would recommend this for advanced exercisers who like to move fast and who don't need a lot of breakdown for the moves.",5,"A fun, fast-paced mix of step and kickboxing",1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,1107,"['love', 'workout', 'Kelly', 'most', 'energetic', 'instructor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'over', '100', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'likes', 'Cathe', 'Friedrich', 'Amy', 'Bento', 'Tracey', 'Staehle', '.This', 'workout', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'music', 'very', 'fast', 'beat', 'Kelly', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'breaking', 'down', 'moves', 'will', 'show', 'few', 'steps', 'routine', 'then', 'build', 'there', 'exactly', 'how', 'like', 'learn', 'new', 'steps.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'routine', 'was', 'particularly', 'high', 'impact', 'other', 'reviewers', 'could', 'always', 'lower', 'step', 'height', 'one', 'riser', 'side', 'even', 'risers', 'wanted', 'less', 'impact', 'One', 'background', 'exercisers', 'showing', 'lower', 'impact', 'modifications', 'well.I', 'consider', 'workout', 'was', 'more', 'step', 'routine', 'few', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'thrown', 'still', 'fun', 'quick', 'weight', 'routine', 'end', 'was', 'nice', 'way', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'too', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'type', 'weight', 'work', 'nice', 'change.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'who', 'like', 'move', 'fast', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lot', 'breakdown', 'moves']",Kelly Coffey-Meyer: Step Boxing Workout
