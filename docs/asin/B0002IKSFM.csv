835342,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0002IKSFM,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[81, 85]","""Love Comes Softly,"" based on a Janette Oke novel, is a heartwarming 19th century tale that will use up several hankies. Marty and her husband travel west, searching for the perfect place to raise a family; when her husband has a fatal accident, Marty finds herself alone, with winter coming, and with no way of getting home. She enters into a marriage of convenience, and faces many trials as she gets used to her new environment and the strangers in her life.Katherine Heigl is lovely as Marty, and Dale Midkiff excellent as Clark, the older, strong Christian man she marries. As his daughter Missie, Skye McCole Bartusian is an exceptional little actress, and in smaller parts, Theresa Russell and Corbin Bensen are terrific as the kind of stalwart people that pioneered this nation. Written and directed by Michael Landon Jr. for Hallmark, this is a way above average film made for the small screen, with endearing characters, and spectacular scenery, shot on location in El Dorado County, California, by cinematographer James Wrenn.A scene that is memorable is when Clark takes Marty to his ""church,"" a bench that faces a beautiful view, and explains his faith to her. It is so well written, and truly the core of this award-winning film. Total running time is 88 minutes, and the DVD gives one the option of full screen or widescreen. A sequel was made to this story, ""Love's Enduring Promise,"" in 2004.""The truth of God's love is not that He allows bad things to happen; it's His promise He'll be there with us, when they do.""",5,God Works in Mysterious Ways,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,1533,"['Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'based', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'novel', 'heartwarming', '19th', 'century', 'tale', 'will', 'use', 'up', 'several', 'hankies', 'Marty', 'husband', 'travel', 'west', 'searching', 'perfect', 'place', 'raise', 'family', 'when', 'husband', 'fatal', 'accident', 'Marty', 'alone', 'winter', 'coming', 'way', 'getting', 'home', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'many', 'trials', 'used', 'new', 'environment', 'strangers', 'life.Katherine', 'Heigl', 'lovely', 'Marty', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'excellent', 'Clark', 'older', 'strong', 'Christian', 'man', 'daughter', 'Missie', 'Skye', 'McCole', 'Bartusian', 'exceptional', 'little', 'actress', 'smaller', 'parts', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'Corbin', 'Bensen', 'are', 'terrific', 'kind', 'stalwart', 'people', 'pioneered', 'nation', 'Written', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'Hallmark', 'way', 'average', 'film', 'made', 'small', 'screen', 'endearing', 'characters', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'shot', 'location', 'El', 'Dorado', 'County', 'California', 'cinematographer', 'James', 'Wrenn.A', 'scene', 'memorable', 'when', 'Clark', 'Marty', 'church', 'bench', 'beautiful', 'view', 'faith', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'truly', 'core', 'award-winning', 'film', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '88', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'one', 'option', 'full', 'screen', 'widescreen', 'sequel', 'was', 'made', 'story', 'Love', 'Enduring', 'Promise', '2004', 'truth', 'God', 'love', 'not', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'promise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'when', 'do']",N/A

Marty, a young pioneer woman, is widowed on the trail soon after she and her husband set out to find themselves a new home. Left poor, alone, and despertely grieving, she accepts the proposal of a near-stranger that she marry him and care for his motherless daughter in return for a roof over her head and passage back to the East when the wagon trains came again. At first, confronted with a rebellious and bitterly resentful girl and crippled by her own terrible grief, Marty can barely funtion. But gradually she settles into this newlife, and just as gradually she, the little girl Missy, and the widower Clark Davis grow to accept each other. This is a worthy adaptation of Janette Oak's bestselling Christian fiction books, and is guaranteed to be loved by any period movie lover. The religious themes add depth to the story but are handled with enough delicacy and restraint that they don't overwhelm or smother it. The love story is really beautiful in itself, and Dale Midkiff, the widower, projects such warmth and feeling into his scenes, particularly the amazing last scene, that it lights up the whole movie. He's an amazing talent. Good performances all around, a well-developed plot, and the story's warmth and purity make this a movie to remember.

I saw it available cheaper here, so I ordered the entire series for myself.To watch the movie a second time, I opened the DVD I bought here at Amazon.  I watched it with my husband, mother-n-law, and three young children.  The movie is so wonderful, full of beautiful life lessons, no swearing or violence.  What strikes me the most is how respectfully people treat each other in the movie.  Something you don't see often in movies or tv shows these days!  I also loved how they portray religion--or God--not shoving it down your throat, but showing the characters' love of God in a respectful and profound way.HERE IS THE PROBLEM!!So last night, we finish watching the movie, the credits role, and then the menu pops up.  I was happy to see a bonus feature.  Basking in the calmness and innocence of just watching this movie, and sitting with my family, including my three young children, I click on this bonus feature, thinking we will get to see an interview with Michael Landon, Jr. or something.  Within seconds we were bombarded with the most horrific, evil (mother-n-law said it seemed satanic) images of contorted bodies hanging from nooses, etc.  In shock I fumbled with the remote to turn it off, but not before my children had seen horrific images.  It appears that the bonus feature is a movie trailer for a satanic horror flick.  I am very, very angry that this is on this DVD.  This is supposed to be a family movie!!!  I would bet that Landon would be horrified to know this has been put with his movie.  I was not informed or warned and had no power over what my children had to see. It upsets me to think how many families have this in their homes, thinking they have a good, clean family film.  What my children saw at the end did more damage than any good they got from the film.  Do you want your five year old to watch someone being tortured and hanged?  Neither did I.  Don't buy this DVD.  I am mortified to think they I gave several copies of this as Christmas gifts.  I purchased those DVD's at a bookstore, and can only hope they do not include that movie trailer.",1,"Wonderful movie--very, very bad version of DVD!!!",1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,2208,"['saw', 'movie', 'month', 'ago', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'several', 'copies', 'give', 'gifts', 'saw', 'available', 'cheaper', 'here', 'ordered', 'entire', 'series', 'myself.To', 'watch', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'opened', 'DVD', 'bought', 'here', 'Amazon', 'watched', 'husband', 'mother-n-law', 'three', 'young', 'children', 'movie', 'so', 'wonderful', 'full', 'beautiful', 'life', 'lessons', 'swearing', 'violence', 'What', 'most', 'how', 'respectfully', 'people', 'treat', 'other', 'movie', 'Something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'days', 'also', 'loved', 'how', 'portray', 'religion', 'God', 'not', 'shoving', 'down', 'throat', 'showing', 'characters', 'love', 'God', 'respectful', 'profound', 'way.HERE', 'PROBLEM', 'So', 'last', 'night', 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', 'credits', 'role', 'then', 'menu', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Basking', 'calmness', 'innocence', 'just', 'watching', 'movie', 'sitting', 'family', 'including', 'three', 'young', 'children', 'click', 'bonus', 'feature', 'thinking', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'interview', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'something', 'Within', 'seconds', 'were', 'bombarded', 'most', 'horrific', 'evil', 'mother-n-law', 'said', 'seemed', 'satanic', 'images', 'contorted', 'bodies', 'hanging', 'nooses', 'etc', 'shock', 'fumbled', 'remote', 'turn', 'off', 'not', 'children', 'had', 'seen', 'horrific', 'images', 'bonus', 'feature', 'movie', 'trailer', 'satanic', 'horror', 'flick', 'am', 'very', 'very', 'angry', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'be', 'family', 'movie', 'would', 'bet', 'Landon', 'would', 'be', 'horrified', 'know', 'been', 'put', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'informed', 'warned', 'had', 'power', 'what', 'children', 'had', 'see', 'think', 'how', 'many', 'families', 'have', 'homes', 'thinking', 'have', 'good', 'clean', 'family', 'film', 'What', 'children', 'saw', 'end', 'did', 'more', 'damage', 'good', 'got', 'film', 'Do', 'want', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'watch', 'someone', 'being', 'tortured', 'hanged', 'did', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'am', 'mortified', 'think', 'gave', 'several', 'copies', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'bookstore', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'movie', 'trailer']",N/A

This warm and wonderful film from Hallmark Entertainment and Faith and Values Media is a huge exception. Based on a book by Janette Oke and adapted to film by Cindy Kelley and Michael Landon Jr., who also directed, this film fills the void left on television now that the aforementioned have passed into TV heaven.Beautifully shot by James Wren in various areas of California, it is warm and touching, and has humor as well. It seems to be nothing special for the first 15 minutes or so, but becomes much more as time goes by. Sometimes love is not fireworks, but something that comes softly, and that exact statement from this Hallmark presentation could be said to apply to the film itself. This is a film the entire family can enjoy, but it also has substance and an important message given in a quiet and unobtrusive manner.Katherine Heigl is terrific as the young bride, Marty, heading west with her new husband to make a life. She has brought her books and dresses to remind her of the culture she is leaving behind. A world of opportunity is in front of the young couple until a tragic accident takes the life of her husband before their dreams together can be realized. Dale Midkiff is also quite good as the young widower, Clark, with a daughter in need of more than her father can provide for her. Clark strikes a bargain with the heartbroken Marty and a marriage of convenience ensues. In the spring, Marty will return to her home back east at Clark's expense. The young loving father Clark will give his daughter what she needs and Marty will have a home and shelter through the winter, as well as passage back home once the blossoms arrive.You have probably guessed the rest, but this story is told with warmth and humor, and is engrossing. Skye McCole Bartusiak gives a memorable performance as Clark's young daughter, Missie, a tomboy who misses her mother more than she lets on. She and Marty clash at first, of course, but one of Marty's dresses will bring them closer and be the bridge to a bond between the two. Numb at first, Marty slowly feels a warmth again, not realizing that love is different every time you feel it. It is Theresa Russell as her kind and wise neighbor who will open her eyes to just what is happening. Russell is excellent in a role that is quite unexpected and far removed from her usual ones. Corbin Bernsen is also good in his brief time as Russell's second husband, whom she loves dearly.There is some wholesome humor, such as Marty attempting to make fried chicken from scratch, and a scene where Clark accidentally walks in on Marty taking a bath. The latter is quite hilarious, Clark ending up out cold on the floor in an attempt to escape! A skunk in the barn will also bring some chuckles.But there is a tenderness here also. Marty's young husband has left her a gift to remember her by. As she is won over by Clark's quiet goodness and his understanding, and spring approaches, she must decide which direction to take her life. A conversation with Clark during ""church"" will help her come to terms with all that has happened and help her to make her decision.

It is a movie that exhibits what most Christians believe and depicts -- without preaching -- true Christian love and compassion.  The message of the gospel is woven within the story intricately and it is a delight to watch.I rented this movie first from Blockbuster quite by accident.  Right after seeing it, I immediately went on-line and bought it and then watched it again, and again and again.  I've only done that with a handful of movies ever.  The only other movies ""worthy"" of my repeated viewing are A&E;'s BBC production of Jane Austin's ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Emma Thompson's screenplay and movie ""Sense and Sensibility,"" and some of the older classics such as ""Now Voyager"" with Bette Davis.I have become so weary of Hollywood continuously using ""Christian"" characters as evil, or doing evil things all by their warped interpretation of how Christians act in the name of God.  Non-Christians attempting to portray Christians in film has almost always come up sorely lacking in authenticity.I recently saw a movie where the only character who even mentions God is a psycho stalker.  The godless are of course, the heroes.  Typical Hollywood fare.This is a story that shows a father as a Christian father and husband should be.  It shows a woman who struggles with a tremendous tragedy in her life but by seeing true Christian charity and compassion through this father and widower who took her in, begins to allow happiness back into her heart and manages to show kindness to his young daughter who misses her dead mother terribly.  The plot is admittedly predictable, however the acting is so well done (even by the child and generally speaking, I do not care for child actors as they always seem to be reading their lines rather than ""becoming"" their character) that you find yourself being swept away willingly into the story regardless.This is a movie you can watch with the entire family not only for the fine story line and the fine directing (by Michael Landon Jr. -- obviously a chip off the ole block), but because the production itself is not (unfortunately) the usual cutting-the-corners cheaply made movie produced by the Christian community.  I hate to say that but it's true with only a few exceptions (Mel Gibson's ""The Passion"" for example).Christians and non-Christians alike will love this story of Matty, Clark and Missy because Christians can see Biblical principles within the story line and non-Christan's can finally witness in a movie the things Christians truly believe while enjoying a heartwarming love story!The sequel to this movie ""Love's Enduring Promise"" (both movies based on Christian novels by Janette Oke BTW) is also a wonderful story and a must see.Rent this movie if you do not wish to yet add it to your collection, but then I predict, when you see it once, you'll want to see it over and over again and return here to buy it!",5,One of the best Christian love stories I've ever seen.,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2953,"['FINALLY', 'movie', 'no', 'less', 'love', 'story', 'Judeo/Christian', 'values', 'movie', 'what', 'most', 'Christians', 'believe', 'depicts', 'preaching', 'true', 'Christian', 'love', 'compassion', 'message', 'gospel', 'woven', 'story', 'intricately', 'delight', 'watch.I', 'rented', 'movie', 'first', 'Blockbuster', 'quite', 'accident', 'Right', 'seeing', 'immediately', 'went', 'on-line', 'bought', 'then', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'again', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'handful', 'movies', 'ever', 'only', 'other', 'movies', 'worthy', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'are', 'A', 'E', 'BBC', 'production', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'older', 'classics', 'such', 'Now', 'Voyager', 'Bette', 'Davis.I', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'weary', 'Hollywood', 'continuously', 'using', 'Christian', 'characters', 'evil', 'doing', 'evil', 'things', 'warped', 'interpretation', 'how', 'Christians', 'act', 'name', 'God', 'Non-Christians', 'attempting', 'portray', 'Christians', 'film', 'almost', 'always', 'come', 'up', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'authenticity.I', 'recently', 'saw', 'movie', 'where', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'even', 'mentions', 'God', 'psycho', 'stalker', 'godless', 'are', 'course', 'heroes', 'Typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare.This', 'story', 'father', 'Christian', 'father', 'husband', 'should', 'be', 'woman', 'who', 'tremendous', 'tragedy', 'life', 'seeing', 'true', 'Christian', 'charity', 'compassion', 'father', 'widower', 'who', 'took', 'allow', 'happiness', 'back', 'heart', 'manages', 'show', 'kindness', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'dead', 'mother', 'terribly', 'plot', 'admittedly', 'predictable', 'however', 'acting', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'child', 'generally', 'speaking', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'child', 'actors', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'reading', 'lines', 'rather', 'becoming', 'character', 'find', 'being', 'swept', 'away', 'willingly', 'story', 'regardless.This', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'entire', 'family', 'not', 'only', 'fine', 'story', 'line', 'fine', 'directing', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'obviously', 'chip', 'ole', 'block', 'production', 'not', 'unfortunately', 'usual', 'cutting-the-corners', 'cheaply', 'made', 'movie', 'produced', 'Christian', 'community', 'hate', 'say', 'true', 'only', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'example', '.Christians', 'non-Christians', 'alike', 'will', 'love', 'story', 'Matty', 'Clark', 'Missy', 'Christians', 'can', 'see', 'Biblical', 'principles', 'story', 'line', 'non-Christan', 'can', 'finally', 'witness', 'movie', 'things', 'Christians', 'truly', 'believe', 'enjoying', 'heartwarming', 'love', 'story', 'sequel', 'movie', 'Love', 'Enduring', 'Promise', 'movies', 'based', 'Christian', 'novels', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'BTW', 'also', 'wonderful', 'story', 'must', 'see.Rent', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'yet', 'add', 'collection', 'then', 'predict', 'when', 'see', 'once', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'return', 'here', 'buy']",N/A

A grieving Marty is left to face the strange land and an oncoming winter alone.  Older widower Clark Davis (Dale Midkiff) offers Marty a platonic marriage of convenience and passage home in the spring if she will temporarily care for his young daughter Missie.  A desperate Marty accepts.Missie Davis (Skye McCole Bartusiak), a willful, unschooled tomboy, immediately resents Marty.  Marty herself struggles with her grief, her lack of frontier skills, and an inability to connect with Missie.  Clark is preternaturally patient but seemingly incapable of casual conversation.Fortunately, Marty has grit.  A turning point comes when she masters her first chicken dinner.  A second comes when she makes Missie her first real dress.  A third is getting Missie to understand the world of adventure hidden in books.  Along the way, Clark, Marty, and Missie face the challenges of an unforgiving frontier life.  Marty's pending departure will trigger one final crisis.""Love Comes Softly"" is Hallmark Entertainment directed by Michael Landon, Jr.  Viewers can expect that every crisis will sort itself out in the Christian-themed tradition of ""Little House on the Prairie"".

835378,A20TD5PADOEGFE,B0002IKSFM,Elyse Wheeler,"[0, 0]","Possibly one of my favorite movies. I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Love Comes Softly was really, really clean.  There was no sex, violence, drugs, or nudity.  The only suspense is at the very beginning where Marty's husband dies, but it is quick and painless. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.I don't like the entire series, several are a little boring and it seems that Janette Oke has a thing with killing off the husbands and having the women remarry.  So I only watch certain ones.  Love Begins first (since is covers how the ""Love Comes Softly"" saga began), second is Love Comes Softly, third is Love's Enduring Promise, fourth is Love's Unending Legacy, and 5th is Love's Unfolding Dream.  They are all amazing, really clean, high morals, family friendly, inspiring, and focuses on the more important things in life.After traveling west with her husband, who dies soon after they arrive, Marty finds herself stranded. Clark Davis, a widower with a daughter, asks Marty to join him in a temporary marriage of convenience. Marty will have a roof over her head until the spring thaw when he will pay for her passage home and his daughter, Missie, will have someone to help her with the chores and therefore have more time to be a child and to teach her things that her mother would have taught her.  As Marty still struggles over the loss of her husband, and as Missie is still struggling over the loss of her mother and therefore resents Marty, the three soon start to feel like a family, especially as Marty discovers that she is pregnant with her first husband's baby.  Marty teaches Missie how to enjoy reading and sewing and Clark teachers Marty about faith and Marty teaches Clark how to love again. But will they tell each other how they feel before Marty leaves on the wagon train in the Spring?One of my favorite thoughts is from this show.  ""Missy could fall down and hurt herself,even if I'm walking right there beside her - that doesn't mean that I allowed it to happen.  But she knows that with a father's unconditional love, I'll pick her up and I'll carry her.  I'll try to heal her.  I'll cry when she cries.  And I'll rejoice when she is well.  In all the moments of my life, God has been right there beside me.  The truth of God's love, is not that he allows bad things to happen.  It's his promise that He'll be there with us, when they do.""Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.

It lacks some depth, but does have several scenes that openly include prayer and Scripture reading. The main plot points follow the book relatively well.

I won't tell you how, exactly, but they definitely tried to rev up the drama.Some of the acting is clunky (Theresa Russell shows ZERO warmth or humor as Ma Graham, and Skye Bartusiak hasn't quite hit her stride here), and the dialog at some points can get a little slow.

835390,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0002IKSFM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Maybe when I'm in a pissy mood I'll talk smack about ONE FOR THE MONEY. But today is official Katherine Heigl day and so we celebrate her good works. Hallmark first aired LOVE COMES SOFTLY in 2003 and launched perhaps the network's most popular franchise, most of which movie installments were adapted from Janette Oke's well loved books. Dale Midkiff is really good in LOVE COMES SOFTLY, with Katherine Heigl matching him in excellence.This film doesn't skimp on illustrating the everyday hardships that constituted life in the American frontier. Fueled by a restless spirit, educated Eastern girl Marty Claridge (Heigl) and her husband, Aaron, have arrived to unsettled prairie land and found their slice of paradise. Marty and Aaron are very much in love, never mind that he grouses that she insists on taking along 200 pounds worth of books and she argues with him over directions. But in one of those tragedies that were common enough back in the pioneer days, he slips off his horse and fatally cracks his skull on a rock. Maybe it's not fair to a traumatised Marty, but no sooner is her husband buried than she gets a proposal from a stranger. Kind-eyed widower Clark Davis (Midkiff) suggests a platonic ""marriage of convenience."" Marty requires shelter from the harsh winter season. Davis feels that his troubled 9-year-old daughter Missie (Skye McCole Bartusiak) is in need of a woman's influence. He also promises that he'll pay for Marty's passage back east once the spring season comes. Marty's heart is broken to bits, but she's pragmatic, and she accepts, reluctantly.Most of the time I'm very leery of message stories because there inevitably is this heavyhanded element. But that's not LOVE COMES SOFTLY, and I was wonderfully surprised and powerfully pleased. There's not much in the way of furious pulpit pounding. Instead we get Midkiff's character who articulates his faith in simple and sincere manner. LOVE COMES SOFTLY lays out a narrative that is restrained yet engrossing. The cast submits performances that are reserved and unpretentious and really good. And while I gush over Midkiff and over Heigl - because, after all, it's Katherine Heigl Day - Skye McCole Bartusiak is just as tremendous as the nine-year-old still grieving for her late mother and who isn't about to accept a surrogate. She gets the film's final say and the word she breathes out is heart-breaking, but in an entirely satisfying way. Someone in the story remarks: ""Sometimes, love isn't fireworks. Sometimes, love comes softly."" A winter passes and eases broken hearts.

The producers/directors did not bother to get anything correct- costumes, cabin props, barn construction, language and role of women/children in the period.

835405,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002IKSFM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","I saw ""Love's Enduring Promise,"" the second in this series of television movies directed by Michael Landon from the novels of Janette Oke, before I saw ""Love Comes Softly.""  However, that scarcely constituted spoiling the first one because the Marty Claridge (Katherine Heigl) and Clark Davis (Dale Midkiff) are clearly preordained to end up together.  Marty and her husband Aaron (Oliver Macready) have traveled west in a wagon to make a home for themselves.  Actually they have been traveling north and Marty wants to head west because the instructions they were given was to head northwest.  This suggests that Aaron might not be the sort who can thrive in the west, but we have similar concerns about Marty, who has insisted they take all of her heavy books and all of her fine dresses on the journey.  They find the Promised Land, in the direction that Marty insisted they go, but before they can even make their dreams begin to come true, Aaron is killed.  A grief stricken Marty can barely force herself to attend the funeral.  She has no where to go and no way to get back home to the East: there will be not be another wagon train heading in that direction until spring.Then everything changes.  Weeping at her husband's grave during a rainstorm a man approaches her.  It is neither the time nor the place, but he has a proposition.  He is a widower with a daughter; she is a widow.  He needs a mother for Missie (Skey McCole Partusiak); she needs a place to live.  The preacher who performed the funeral will be leaving the next day.  If she agrees to marry him, Marty will sleep in the room with Missie, and if she is not happy with the arrangement when the spring comes he will pay for her to return back East.  Without any other prospects or hope, she agrees.Given the living arrangement, there really is no reason for a wedding to be part of the deal.  Clark Davis is a godly man, in the best meaning of the term, and if he took in a widow to help raise his daughter there is nobody who knows him who would think he was doing anything untoward.  If anything, taking a wife in a loveless marriage would seem against his character and if Marty does go back East in the spring I am not sure what a divorce on the frontier actually means.  But part of the point of this story is that even in such extreme circumstances, love can thrive.Marty has to deal with living on the frontier, which means graduating from making pancakes to something actually edible like fried chicken (but first you need a chicken), as well as with forging a relationship with Missy, who makes it clear she does not need a new mother.  But Clark knows that his daughter is missing out on her childhood, and that is simply unacceptable.  ""Love Comes Softly"" is not filled with big moments, but pays attention instead to the smaller ones that make up the relationships that are growing here.  There is a slight misstep at the end in that I like to think permission does not need to be given or granted for love to be expressed, but when you are covering such familiar emotion ground it is perhaps difficult not to indulge in minor melodrama.This 2003 television movie is intended as wholesome entertainment (one of the production companies is Faith & Values Media), and for the most part it avoids preaching either to the choir or to the curious that serve as its audience, although I suspect your judgment on that score will be based entirely on your sensibilities in that regard.  Midkiff does a nice job of making Clark seem earnest rather than pious, which is key to this movie working (his idea of ""church"" should strike a chord).

835406,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0002IKSFM,Lee Armstrong,"[7, 7]","What an absolute delight this film is!  Made for the Hallmark Channel & first aired in 2003, Michael Landon Jr. has directed a very sweet tale that is touching, gripping and compelling on many levels.  The cast for this Janet Oke novel adaptation is excellent.  Katherine Heigl is currently starring in the enormously popular ""Gray's Anatomy"" TV series for ABC & previously starred in one of my favorites, the cult TV classic series ""Roswell.""  Acting since she was 7, her first film was ""That Night"" in 1992 followed by the Steven Soderbaugh directed ""King of the Hill"" a year later.  As Marty Claridge, she hits so many levels: the wildly romantic new bride, the forlorn widow, the uncertain woman living in a rugged country, and of course the companion of Missy and the slow realization of her love for Clark Davis.  Dale Midkiff starred in the ""Time Trax"" TV series from 93-95, as Elvis in the TV movie ""Elvis & Me, & in ""Another Woman's Husband"" for Lifetime Cable.  As Clark Davis, I was particularly touched by his ability to evoke that most subtle combination of feeling & belief, faith -- even in the face of deep grief.  The plot contrivance at the end where he misses Marty's letter seemed a little forced, but then what screenwriter is perfect?  Skye McCole Bartusiak played the young Meg Ryan in ""Against the Ropes"" & in a horror flick I purposely missed, ""Boogeyman.""  As the headstrong daughter Missy she turns in an excellent performance.  L.A. Law's Corbin Bernsen & Theresa Russell do a nice job as the neighbors Ben & Sarah Graham.  ""Love Comes Softly"" is marvelous because it demonstrates that entertainment doesn't have to be sleazy to be excellent.  The DVD didn't offer many extras, but I'm glad that this Hallmark film is available.

835414,A3O9X6AUXHNTHN,B0002IKSFM,"Maxwell Casey ""Max""","[2, 2]","No doubt more than once this story actually played out in the 1800's, marriages arranged for survival and for the sake of the family unit. I'm amazed many people expect a movie to exactly follow the book, in most instances that isn't possible, the only movie I can recall coming close to the book version is BBC's production of Pride and Prejudice (with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth). This movie (Love Comes Softly) easily stands on its own as does the book--view them as equal but separate entities.  Dale Midkiff's performance was outstanding as a man of deep religious values, moral, compassionate, gentle but strong, kind, wise and understanding of Marty's pain and his child's jealousy and inability to accept a new ""mom"". I found the ""age difference"" between Clark and Marty quite believeable, Clark was a man with an established farm (something that wouldn't have been as believeable with a 20-25 year-old widowed man). His character has weathered hard times, loss and sadness in losing his own wife, managing a farm and raising a young child on his own--all making him wiser from these experiences; this increases his compassion toward Marty and his ability to deal with the expected conflict between his young daughter and the newly widowed Marty.  One viewer stated there really wasn't a reason for marriage since Clark wanted Marty there to influence and guide his daughter--totally untrue. In that day and time to have a young, recently widowed woman living in his house would have been a disgrace and a vehicle for gossip, totally out of character for the values expressed by Clark--he would never have had Marty living in his house without the benefit of marriage (regardless of whether he and Marty had any love interest). Clark is all man with a strong but soft, gentle side that is irresistible. The viewer can see the budding love in his eyes for Marty as well as see Marty's appreciation for his strength, wisdom, steadiness and his love for his child. Dale (as Clark) is so convincing in the scene where he finally discovers Marty's note, his puffy eyes, his drawn face certainly look as though he has shed many tears over Marty's departure--a rare emotional scene especially for a male actor.Katherine Heigl is outstanding in the range of emotions her character experiences--from immature, youthful love with her husband Aaron, to the shock and pain of his untimely death, through grief, and finally maturity into a lasting love with Clark.  Also, I don't think I've ever seen a better performance from Corbin Bernsen.This movie is extraordinary, rich in moral values, romance without nudity, expressions of true love without overt sex or explicit bedroom scenes, no swear words--not one single four-letter word so common in movies today--how refreshing. There are lines in this movie that bring you to tears and others that make you laugh out loud.I love this movie, have seen it many times on DVD and no doubt will watch it many more times. There is an overall sense of goodness in the characters and this movie in general. Michael Landon, Jr. has done an outstanding job of providing a movie worth viewing over and over and a credit to the memory of his Dad.

Several times I utilized my fast forward button to get me through some of the more over-the-top preachy dialogue.But putting religion aside, the movie's wholesome focus on love and family is refreshing. So much of our society is sex and violence centric. It is refreshing to take a look back at how life used to be before our society became uncontrollably warped by the crudeness of drugs, greed and lust.

This first one was so uplifting as true to pioneer days of losing a love one and having to either marry the next person that comes along or parish. Kathleen and Clark were perfect for this movie, I was very sad when Ms.Hagel didn't complete the series, just like January Jones didn't go through with the rest of the series as Missey. I would have liked to have seen a little more of the family life of the boys in the family Aaron who Marty had from her first husband and then Arny. I guess the story was more on Love and lifes of the woman and generations to follow more than the life's of the men who shared their lifes. Did Aaron and Arney marry? Did they have struggles as young pioneer young men living on the farm? I was sorry to see Willie die as the Marshall, but then life takes us through many trials in our life's, but for Missy we seemed to follow her through most of her life, until Melinda came along.This is a family movie and if you like this one you will love all the rest.
