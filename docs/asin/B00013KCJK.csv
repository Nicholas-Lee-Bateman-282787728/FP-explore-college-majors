792259,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B00013KCJK,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[7, 7]","I thought the first season was nearly too much, and this season is full of even more raucously funny and shameless moments.  The season begins with Ian and Donna's daughter Holly still missing and their relationship on shaky ground because of it.  Unable to talk to her husband and disappointed in her marriage, Donna turns to Sal for comfort.  Kyle and Chardonnay have taken Jackie's baby and are deliriously happy to have fooled the press and finally be a family.  Little do they know that the baby, Paddy, is going to turn out to be much more trouble than he's worth. Finally, Tanya fully intends to let people believe that Frank attacked her and her cocaine habit is worse than ever.  When she and Jason decide to renew their vows, their ceremony is the highlight of the season leaving this series with a stunning cliffhanger that, as unfortunate Americans, we'll have to wait until September to have resolved.Just when I thought they had done everything they could, I was wrong. This season takes chances that I don't think even the trashiest American television would (including Desperate Housewives and Passions).  There is nothing comparable to Footballers Wives on television right now, and I guess we'll just have to wait anxiously and hope they start releasing the DVDs more quickly.",4,This show will stop at nothing,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,1294,"['thought', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'nearly', 'too', 'much', 'season', 'full', 'even', 'more', 'raucously', 'funny', 'shameless', 'moments', 'season', 'Ian', 'Donna', 'daughter', 'Holly', 'still', 'missing', 'relationship', 'shaky', 'ground', 'Unable', 'talk', 'husband', 'disappointed', 'marriage', 'Donna', 'Sal', 'comfort', 'Kyle', 'Chardonnay', 'have', 'taken', 'Jackie', 'baby', 'are', 'deliriously', 'happy', 'have', 'fooled', 'press', 'finally', 'be', 'family', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'baby', 'Paddy', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'trouble', 'worth', 'Finally', 'Tanya', 'fully', 'let', 'people', 'believe', 'Frank', 'attacked', 'cocaine', 'habit', 'worse', 'ever', 'When', 'Jason', 'decide', 'renew', 'vows', 'ceremony', 'highlight', 'season', 'leaving', 'series', 'stunning', 'cliffhanger', 'unfortunate', 'Americans', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'September', 'have', 'resolved.Just', 'when', 'thought', 'had', 'done', 'everything', 'could', 'was', 'wrong', 'season', 'chances', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'trashiest', 'American', 'television', 'would', 'including', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Passions', 'nothing', 'comparable', 'Footballers', 'Wives', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'anxiously', 'hope', 'start', 'releasing', 'DVDs', 'more', 'quickly']",N/A
