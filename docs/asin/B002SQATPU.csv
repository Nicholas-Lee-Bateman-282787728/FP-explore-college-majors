1287375,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B002SQATPU,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[19, 19]","This is one of the DVDs from fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series. Like the other DVDs in this series, 30 Minutes to Fitness Kickboxing offers two separate workouts; when combined with the warm-up, each of these workouts is around 30 minutes long, perfect if you are short on time. However, Kelly also offers plenty of additional options, including a Bonus Core/Abs segment and premixes which allow you to create a longer workout by performing both workouts together, adding on the abs, etc.Kelly works out with four background exercises, one of whom shows modifications for the higher impact moves. Although with a few exceptions (see my notes below), Kelly mostly keeps the choreography relatively basic, she also includes a 13.5 minute Tutorial that breaks down all of the combinations included in both workouts (be advised, though--even the tutorial moves fairly quickly!). The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up and each workout as separate options as well as the Bonus Core/Abs segment and the Tutorial.Kelly begins the 3 1/2 minute Warm-up with shoulder circles, shrugs, and shuffles. She adds in knees, kicks, and squats and then introduces the four punches used in the workout (jabs, crosses, hooks, uppercuts). The short warm-up finishes with a quick hip flexor stretch. Without the warm-up, Workout #1 is 27 minutes long, and #2 is 24 1/2 minutes long. Both follow the format of repeating a combination for 2 minutes and then moving on (although sometimes Kelly changes it up and does a short drill-like sequence at the end of a combo). I loved that both workouts really worked the legs with A LOT of kicking; a few of the combos were virtually ALL kicks! In the first workout, I had trouble with the choreography for one combination only, which involved a hitch (jump) kick; I just couldn't seem to get to the correct side on that one. For the second workout, I thought that there was some trickier choreography during the first half, but it seemed to get more basic as the workout continued. There is a little preview of the upcoming sequence which appears for a few seconds in the bottom right-half of the screen, but to be honest, this is more of a distraction than a help. Also, I wish that Kelly had cued the combos a bit more--she's very encouraging and obviously having a great time, but there are times when a little reminder from her to ""now hook"" or ""kick left"" would've been extremely helpful. Still, I never got too frustrated with any combination given that none of them lasted longer than two minutes, and for both workouts, the time absolutely FLEW by. Each of the workouts concludes with just a minute or so of brief stretching.The Bonus Core/Abs segment (14 minutes) is a great little addition to this workout. Since the first 4 1/2 minutes of this segment are performed standing, I found that when I added the segment on after the workout, it kept my heart rate up too! The standing portion includes side bends, punches with twists/knees, uppercuts with front crunch, and kicks with twists. Then it's on to the floor for some very different takes on the usual crunches: Kelly starts with a punching sit-up and also performs punches on a decline, twists, leg raises, crunches with leg raises, and explosive scissor sit-ups.The Pre-Mixes on this DVD include the Knockout Mix (both workouts), 53 minutes; Punch Mix, 22 minutes; Kick Mix, 21 minutes; and Punch & Kick Mix, 22 Minutes; the Abs/Core submenu offers additional options. I would note that even though Kelly breaks down the choreography in the Tutorial, she doesn't explain how to do the punches and kicks, so I wouldn't recommend this DVD for those brand new to kickboxing. In conclusion, I'm thrilled to have this workout--I already loved kickboxing, but Kelly has made it even more fun, new, and different here. Highly recommended!",5,"Great fun and great workout, too!",1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,3857,"['one', 'DVDs', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'Kelly', 'Coffey-Meyer', '30', 'Minutes', 'Fitness', 'series', 'other', 'DVDs', 'series', '30', 'Minutes', 'Fitness', 'Kickboxing', 'two', 'separate', 'workouts', 'when', 'combined', 'warm-up', 'workouts', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'perfect', 'are', 'short', 'time', 'However', 'Kelly', 'also', 'plenty', 'additional', 'options', 'including', 'Bonus', 'Core/Abs', 'segment', 'premixes', 'allow', 'create', 'longer', 'workout', 'performing', 'workouts', 'together', 'adding', 'abs', 'etc.Kelly', 'out', 'four', 'background', 'exercises', 'one', 'whom', 'shows', 'modifications', 'higher', 'impact', 'moves', 'few', 'exceptions', 'see', 'notes', 'Kelly', 'mostly', 'choreography', 'relatively', 'basic', 'also', '13.5', 'minute', 'Tutorial', 'down', 'combinations', 'included', 'workouts', 'be', 'advised', 'even', 'tutorial', 'moves', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'Warm-Up', 'workout', 'separate', 'options', 'as', 'well', 'Bonus', 'Core/Abs', 'segment', 'Tutorial.Kelly', '3', '1/2', 'minute', 'Warm-up', 'shoulder', 'circles', 'shrugs', 'shuffles', 'knees', 'kicks', 'squats', 'then', 'four', 'punches', 'used', 'workout', 'jabs', 'crosses', 'hooks', 'uppercuts', 'short', 'warm-up', 'finishes', 'quick', 'hip', 'flexor', 'stretch', 'warm-up', 'Workout', '1', '27', 'minutes', 'long', '2', '24', '1/2', 'minutes', 'long', 'follow', 'format', 'repeating', 'combination', '2', 'minutes', 'then', 'moving', 'sometimes', 'Kelly', 'changes', 'up', 'short', 'drill-like', 'sequence', 'end', 'combo', 'loved', 'workouts', 'really', 'worked', 'legs', 'LOT', 'kicking', 'few', 'combos', 'were', 'virtually', 'ALL', 'first', 'workout', 'had', 'trouble', 'choreography', 'one', 'combination', 'only', 'involved', 'hitch', 'jump', 'kick', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'correct', 'side', 'one', 'second', 'workout', 'thought', 'was', 'trickier', 'choreography', 'first', 'half', 'seemed', 'get', 'more', 'basic', 'workout', 'continued', 'little', 'preview', 'upcoming', 'sequence', 'few', 'seconds', 'bottom', 'right-half', 'screen', 'be', 'honest', 'more', 'distraction', 'help', 'Also', 'wish', 'Kelly', 'had', 'cued', 'combos', 'bit', 'more', 'very', 'encouraging', 'obviously', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'little', 'reminder', 'now', 'hook', 'kick', 'left', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'Still', 'never', 'got', 'too', 'frustrated', 'combination', 'given', 'none', 'lasted', 'longer', 'two', 'minutes', 'workouts', 'time', 'absolutely', 'FLEW', 'workouts', 'just', 'minute', 'so', 'brief', 'stretching.The', 'Bonus', 'Core/Abs', 'segment', '14', 'minutes', 'great', 'little', 'addition', 'workout', 'first', '4', '1/2', 'minutes', 'segment', 'are', 'performed', 'standing', 'found', 'when', 'added', 'segment', 'workout', 'kept', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'too', 'standing', 'portion', 'side', 'bends', 'punches', 'twists/knees', 'uppercuts', 'front', 'crunch', 'kicks', 'twists', 'Then', 'floor', 'very', 'different', 'usual', 'crunches', 'Kelly', 'punching', 'sit-up', 'also', 'performs', 'punches', 'decline', 'twists', 'leg', 'raises', 'crunches', 'leg', 'raises', 'explosive', 'scissor', 'sit-ups.The', 'Pre-Mixes', 'DVD', 'include', 'Knockout', 'Mix', 'workouts', '53', 'minutes', 'Punch', 'Mix', '22', 'minutes', 'Kick', 'Mix', '21', 'minutes', 'Punch', 'Kick', 'Mix', '22', 'Minutes', 'Abs/Core', 'submenu', 'offers', 'additional', 'options', 'would', 'note', 'even', 'Kelly', 'breaks', 'down', 'choreography', 'Tutorial', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'do', 'punches', 'kicks', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'brand', 'new', 'kickboxing', 'conclusion', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'have', 'workout', 'already', 'loved', 'kickboxing', 'Kelly', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'new', 'different', 'here', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Plus she offers various premixes for a variety of workouts.What I really enjoy is that her workouts equally work the upper and lower body and in 30 minutes!I've been looking for some 30 minute workouts so I can get a workout in when I get home from work.

1287377,AI079T7UA2U00,B002SQATPU,Kelsey,"[2, 2]","I am VERY picky when it comes to kickboxing workouts; I've done a lot and have never seemed happy with any of them...until now! This kickboxing DVD is great! It's upbeat, and you sweat like crazy! Some of the steps are a little hard to follow (at first), but after you do them for a while, you get better at it. The instructor is great; she really pushes you. There's also a girl who ""modifies"" the routines if you want to start off a little easier than the rest of them. The ab workout is great too (yes, there's an ab workout!) because she incorporates kickboxing with abs/core, which I never thought about doing. I've noticed you really work every muscle! You have your core, and then of course you work your arms and legs. And you're constantly moving too, which makes for a great workout.The only downside is there are only 2 workout routines, however, there are ""premixes"" that focus on only arms or only legs, which combine steps from both routines.I would recommend this video to anyone who likes kickboxing. If you're just starting out with kickboxing, it may be a little tough at first, but once you get it (and you will!), it's so much fun! You're constantly moving too, which is what I like to see!Update: It's been a couple weeks working out with this DVD, and I still LOVE it! I don't even care anymore that there are only 2 routines; they're both still fun! And now I've gotten even better at following along too. I would STILL recommend this DVD; it's my favorite kickboxing workout by far!!!",5,Great kickboxing DVD!,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,1508,"['am', 'VERY', 'picky', 'when', 'kickboxing', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'done', 'lot', 'have', 'never', 'seemed', 'happy', 'now', 'kickboxing', 'DVD', 'great', 'upbeat', 'sweat', 'crazy', 'steps', 'are', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'first', 'do', 'while', 'get', 'better', 'instructor', 'great', 'really', 'also', 'girl', 'who', 'modifies', 'routines', 'want', 'start', 'off', 'little', 'easier', 'rest', 'ab', 'workout', 'great', 'too', 'yes', 'ab', 'workout', 'kickboxing', 'abs/core', 'never', 'thought', 'doing', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'really', 'work', 'muscle', 'have', 'core', 'then', 'course', 'work', 'arms', 'legs', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'moving', 'too', 'great', 'workout.The', 'only', 'downside', 'are', 'only', '2', 'workout', 'routines', 'however', 'are', 'premixes', 'focus', 'only', 'arms', 'only', 'legs', 'combine', 'steps', 'routines.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'kickboxing', ""'re"", 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'kickboxing', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'tough', 'first', 'once', 'get', 'will', 'so', 'much', 'fun', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'moving', 'too', 'what', 'like', 'see', 'Update', 'been', 'couple', 'weeks', 'working', 'out', 'DVD', 'still', 'LOVE', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'anymore', 'are', 'only', '2', 'routines', ""'re"", 'still', 'fun', 'now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'even', 'better', 'following', 'along', 'too', 'would', 'STILL', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'kickboxing', 'workout', 'far']",N/A

I like a no-nonsense, no frills workout dvd that I can get an effective sweaty workout with the first time I do it. And I like simple kickboxing. For this video, you have to learn some complex choreography in order to do the moves. I believe there IS a training section where they teach the moves. But I don't want to have to prepare BEFORE I do the workout. I attempted to do the workout without the ""Pre"" workout prep and I'm decently coordinated, but I couldn't follow a lot of it, and I barely broke a sweat. I was just frustrated and gave up and popped in a different DVD that I knew would get my heart rate up. Now, bear in mind, if you like the choreographed sort of thing, you may love this.

1287379,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B002SQATPU,Teedums,"[3, 3]","I really like Kelly Coffey-Meyer and have collected most of her 30 Minutes to Fitness series.  I don't have many kickboxing videos so naturally I had to add this one to my library.  I must say it is one of my favorites.I will be honest, it did take me a few tries to get down but once you get it, lots of fun.  She does include a tutorial that goes through all the combinations slowly, which really helped me.There are 2 - 30 minute workouts.  You generally do a combination for 2 minutes, then move on to the next one and repeat.  You see quite a variety in kicking and punching moves, but I found that all the combinations flowed nicely and none of them were too complicated once you get the hang of it.There are a handful of premixes included on this DVD, including a kick mix and punch mix, among others.  There is also a separate ab routine that I see myself getting a lot of use from.Kelly has her regular modifier in Lauren to assist in showing simpler options of some of the moves.  I follow her quite a bit and like the fact that she is in nearly all of Kelly's videos.Overall, I give this 5 stars.  I think Kelly does a fine job of instructing and has given us a fun kickboxing workout here.
