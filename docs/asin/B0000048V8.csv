491608,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B0000048V8,Alric the Red,"[6, 6]","I first saw this on PBS, back when it was new, and I recorded it and watched it many, many times with my son.  It's very soft and tranquilizing, as the landscapes are hushed by snow, and no words are ever spoken.  The rest is all lulling symphony music, with a lovely vocal interlude during the sweeping flying sequence.  It's a gorgeous little piece of work.Now, the version I saw so long ago did in fact have David Bowie as the man introducing it.  But this was an edit for American television.  I bought a different copy of this a few years back (a DVD which included another Christmas cartoon), and it had the original introduction restored to it.  And I know that this is the original opening because it begins with the narrator walking along the edge of an open field in front of the woods, the same woods that in the next instant become the animated landscape, where the story begins.  That's the version that's on this DVD, the original version, and I know this because it arrived today.  But who narrates the introduction doesn't matter.  This is an artfully crafted work to be treasured in any library, and I wouldn't let the fact that Bowie isn't introducing it from a cozy attic discourage my owning it.  Yes, for the sake of nostalgia, I wouldn't mind seeing that one again, but for the sake of collecting, I'll settle for this original edit.Only a grownup can really appreciate the level of artistry that went into this 27-minute confection, but children, too, are enthralled by it for other reasons.  Watch it with them, and have a real moment you'll keep for a lifetime.

Just try to resist the temptation you'll feel to go back to the beginning and start this amazing film all over again.You won't be able to do resist; that much I can promise you.This is by far one of the most amazing short films I have ever seen.  This is film about a mutual exploration; the child-protaganist builds The Snowman, and then through magic, this Snowman comes to life.  The child invites the Snowman indoors, where the child shows the Snowman the inside of the house.  The Snowman explores the child's world, showing the audience how things so familiar to us become things of oddity and wonder to the Snowman.Then, in turn, the Snowman invites the child to explore the Snowman's world.  It is at this point of the film that we are taken on a flying journey into the magical world of the snowman, a world that observes our own, but is still apart from our own.Be prepared for the ending of this film:  It is NOT what you would expect at all.  It says something about what we lose when we cease to be children, and become adults.It is impossible not to be deeply emotionally effected by this amazing short movie.

491610,A1NPROXGAEEPHD,B0000048V8,"Amazon Customer ""Mrs. Snowman""","[1, 1]","At first I didn't recognize this story when I got the book for my nephew recently, but I later realized it was based on a holiday cartoon special I had seen as a child on PBS (But I didn't think I cared for it as a child because of the unsatisfying ending...talk about a CLIFF-HANGER; it totally left me at a loss!). Today, however, it has grown on me and I think it is one of my favorite holiday specials of alltime! I seem to remember PBS introducing it as ""Frosty the Snowman""...Frankly I didn't remember much of the film as a child except the fact that the snowman had a huge impact on me and I was soo touched by his special friendship with the boy...I don't think I watched the movie all the way thru until recently but I totally remember the ending. I knew what was going to happen when James awakens to the sun shining the day after his magical night with his special friend the snowman, and my heart was breaking as I watched him making a beeline outside to find that all that remains of his beloved friend has become a puddle, a hat, a scarf and some pieces of coal...(still makes me weep). When he melted, I felt like I had lost a best friend...I felt/ feel like he had become my friend, as well as James's. The Snowman had totally captured my heart!What is truly interesting is getting other peoples perspectives on what I initially considered a tragic story. My nephew saw the movie with his first grade class and he is just as sensitive as me and he claimed he didn't think it was sad at all, and that nobody else cried. They all loved it...as a child I loved the snowman but couldn't stand to watch the ending.I just watched the Snowman movie again all the way through and it is delightful. I laughed and I cried. It is definately a favorite. I am SO GLAD that James runs back and hugs the snowman when they say goodnight...I think that is soo important. It reminds us to live every moment as though it were our last and not take loved ones for granted...you never know when it will be the last time you will see them.First time I saw the movie, at the end, I misunderstood about the scarf James is holding. I thought he was holding up the snowman's green plaid scarf to remember him by--which is truly sorrowful--when in fact it is the blue snowman scarf Father Christmas gave him on their trip to the North Pole. The significance is that it proved the adventures of the night before were not a dream after all. Love, love, love!! This is one of the BEST movies of all times. It triggers so many different emotions. Check out the bleak godforsaken whiteness surrounding James and the remains of his beloved snowman--you can feel the desolation. It makes your skin crawl. If I could change one thing I'd change the ending. I'd have the snowman go to the North Pole with Frosty.For all you snowman fans, be sure to check out the official website: [...] (they won't let me post the address here but google The Snowman and you should be able to find it)!Also, I watched Father Christmas. James and the Snowman make a second trek to the North Pole to meet up with Santa Claus again!! I was sooo overjoyed!!!

Fairbanks""","[10, 11]","From the moment you hear the tinkling piano keys that play over the opening titles, you know ""The Snowman"" is going to be a heartbreaker. Unfortunately, there may be more heartbreak in store for those who purchase ""The Snowman"" on DVD believing they are getting the version they remember.There are at least three versions of this film: there's one that's introduced by the author, Raymond Briggs, and features an entirely instrumental score (the version I first saw and still prefer.)Still another version retains the Briggs intro but includes a vocal version of ""Walking In the Air"" that, in my opinion, breaks the magic spell that the film so ably casts.And, finally, there's a version introduced by David Bowie. I'm not sure whether that features the boy sorprano on the soundtrack or not.I'm also not sure which of these versions is THE original that earned an Academy Award nomination for 1982.However, this particular DVD is guilty of false advertising. The David Bowie introduction promised on the cover (and in the description at Amazon) is nowhere to be found. Instead, this particular edition is identical to the one released on a disc in tandem with ""Father Christmas."" In other words, you get the Raymond Briggs introduction and the vocal rendition of ""Walking In the Air."" (But, remember, no Bowie.)Although I'll always prefer the purely instrumental version of the film, ""The Snowman"" remains a delightfully sweet and sad story in every incarnation.

The animation is breathtaking as it looks exactly like the original illustrations. Oh, and we should never forget the music.

The lovely vocals blends in perfectly with the entire ""flying"" sequence.How come we never see more films like this one anymore? It's a real shame.

This inspirational film came out in 1982, several years before I was born. The film is scored by Howard Blake with the exception of the nostalgic song ""Walking in The Air"" sung by a choir boy Peter Auty of the St. Paul's Cathedral. The Film was directed by Dianne Jackson and produced by John Coates. May John Coates R.I.P. This film features an introduction by one of my favorite Artists David Bowie in the 1983 release. Some of the animators involved include Arthur Butten, Tony Guy, Hilary Audus, David Baillie, Vicky Emptage, Vanessa Clegg and others. I know that Hilary Audus and Dianne Jackson were the Storyboard artists. John Cary was the film editor. This Film reminds me of my childhood everytime I watch it in which words cannot describe. I would watch it with my Grandmother and Great Grandmother and it would bring comfort through my parents divorce. I also played the song for my daughter the day I brought her home from the hospital after she was born. I laid with her caressing her head listening to this beautiful tune. I have shared it with those special in my life as well. Today at 28, this film still brings tears to my eyes. With it's soothing pastel colors it brings an aura of magic and innocence. This film takes you into a journey of love and hope, but most of all a friendship between James and The Snowman. Full of emotion this film has no speaking and that is where the wonderful music and soft visuals take you on the journey.Such a simple tale yet so heartwarming it gives you comfort in any struggle that you might be having in your life. The joy of your inner child is any remedy known to humanity to those who embrace it. The ending is sad and painful yet a reminder of reality and that the memories that James shared with The Snowman. These memories between this friendship will live on forever. The memory of sneaking The Snowman into his home and of flying through the sky while visiting a faraway land and meeting Santa Claus as well as other Happy Snowmen is priceless.

Mostly zero dialog with just music and imagery carrying the story. Of course the music and imagery have to be top notch in order to do this, which is why The Snowman is an excellent short.And I do mean short. The film runs at under 30 minutes, but don't let that stop you from getting this. It is truly an amazing experience for the children and adults alike. The animation is nice with the drawed in type style. You also get an amazing flying sequenced rotoscoped, so you get fluid flying movement on top of the drawing style animation. The music score is unforgettable (Walking in the Air is a particular favorite). Once you hear it you will know what I'm talking about. The one thing I miss is the original Raymond Briggs&#8217; narration (the author of the book). Still David Bowie does quite a good job.There isn't much in the way of extras aside from an introduction by David Bowie. Still this is more than what was offered in the original DVD release. The Snowman brings out a whole range of emotions for people of all ages.

My almost eight-year-old daughter has become a fan too, watching it since she was a toddler. It has been wonderful to see her changing expressions, from interest and wonder, to poignancy as the story draws to an end.This 1982 London's Channel 4 production has David Bowie providing the introduction to the story which has no dialogue, only background music, a lovely score composed and conducted by Howard Blake. The story tells of an English boy's magical encounter with a snowman who comes to life one night. The boy had built the snowman earlier that day and at the strike of twelve midnight, the snowman comes to life and is invited into the boy's home where the pair proceed to indulge in some hilarious antics. The snowman is captivated by all that he sees and touches - electric switches, the boy's parents' wardrobe, and many more. Though there is no dialogue, anyone can appreciate the story by the expressive facial expressions on the snowman and the boy, and young children especially will delight in the pair's antics.Later that same night, the snowman takes the boy on  a magical ride in the sky, over snow-capped terrain, and into a world filled with beauty and wonder.
