All 13 episodes are presented in their original NBC uncut broadcast entirety, clocking in at just over 24 minutes each.  I'd seen all of these episodes in syndication as early as 1988, and even then they were already missing some footage for more commercial time.  Not here!  If you've only seen the edited versions before, you're in for a treat.  It was kind of funny seeing the extended scene in the episode ""Santa Goes Downtown"" where Dan Fielding told Eddie Simms (played by Michael J. Fox) to ""go and tease Bull about his hair.""  Seeing it again on the DVD reminded me that I had actually seen this episode back in 1984 and had forgotten this part due to it's being deemed less important than the almighty advertiser's dollar.  It really is great to have the complete versions available to see again!At the time of this writing, it's been 10 months since the release of this Season One box set.  It's unlike Warner Bros. to take so much time between releases of it's TV shows, but for some reason they aren't on the ball with this particular show.  However, I still think that they will get around to releasing more seasons.  After all, several of the shows they were working on (""Friends"", ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""Wonder Woman"") have wrapped.  It makes sense that this would free up some resources to get to work on some of their thus-far neglected properties (a la ""Night Court"").

871312,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B0006N2EZK,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[0, 1]","Anyone who is a fan of Cop/Court shows will love this show. Anyone who just want to watch a well written comedy MUST purchase this. I owned this season twice. Once it was a gift back when they released season one originally, then a second time when I had to replace the season after I gave it away. Why did I give it away? Because it was taking way way too long for season two. I was worried they would do the same thing they did with Barney Miller (putting it in complete series packaging by a third party). So I was uncertain of the future of the series and how I may end up buying it. Luckily season one is cheaply priced so it was no big deal purchasing it a second time.First, I want to say this series looks great, and I want to thank them for using dual layered dvds. I hate when they use single layer and condense the show so much that I actually miss watching it on my old 80s 13&#34; black and white tv. This time the compression is fine and the shows are as funny today as they were originally. if not more so. I like watching series in order, and will try (if possible) to watch it continuously over a period of time so I can watch it chronologically and uninterrupted. It does look as if this series is coming out fast enough now. Since I am playing catch up anyway it works out better for me.Like Barney Miller, the writing focuses on the pitfalls of life in the criminal justice system. This is an ensemble piece with a strong central character (Harry Anderson) and equally strong supporting players (John Larroquette and Richard Moll..as well as others). Due to the changing of characters within the first three season it actually had a feel of a job with a high turnaround rate. I have never worked in criminal justice, but in my job I see so many people come and go and there usually is a core group of people who stay for the duration...and this show seems realistic in that sense. Not sure how intentional that was, as part of the reason is due to untimely deaths of key characters. But, instead of crippling the show it actually is made into a strength.Reinhold Weege is at the top of his game. Everyone seems to know their characters and interact perfectly and hit their marks flawlessly.  Sure the first season has t he usual growing pains and moments that seem out of step with the series as a whole, but once they hit their stride, they just kept going. The end result is a timeless classic with jokes that are still as funny today as they were then. The chemistry is unbelievable at times, as it seems like these actors ARE their characters, but that's just the joy of having such a talented ensemble cast.I've always liked Harry Anderson, his character on Cheers never failed to make me laugh and it seems like all of his strenghts in acting/comedy are on display here. And Larroquette (though not as fleshed out as he will in the subsequent seasons) seems to be equally at ease with the nuances of his character. The female characters are great in their parts too, but as they are not permanent I did not wish to go too far into their characters. But, I will say they are great, and add to the overall chemistry.One minor gripe, but this is more aimed at the studio who put it out. The packaging is fine (O-Ring spine holds both cds in a single dvd case. So that works. But, why do companies not track their episodes? I do not need chapters really, but it would be nice to have th e option of watching the opening jokes then skip the theme and go to the next scene. I've noticed this missing on lots of series. AS it's only a sitcom and only about 22 mins it's not a huge thing to concern  yourself with. Just saying my personal preference.But, anyone picking this up will not be disappointed. The writing/directing is top notch and  you couldn't ask for a better cast to deliver the lines and the presentation here looks great (especially considering how old the show is and how it was filmed). They are over the top at times, but in a very disciplined way. You'll find yourself laughing without even realising this is an OLDER show, as it will seem as fresh and energetic as anything out there today. There are a few references here and there that are dated but all shows have that problem. But this is a classic comedy from the classic/golden era of television. The original &#34;Must-See&#34; tv...when executives cared more about content and quality than instant commercial success. This show is one in a million so pick it up and enjoy.",5,A Great Classic show everyone should own,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,4470,"['Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Cop/Court', 'shows', 'will', 'love', 'show', 'Anyone', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'well', 'written', 'comedy', 'MUST', 'purchase', 'owned', 'season', 'twice', 'was', 'gift', 'back', 'when', 'released', 'season', 'one', 'originally', 'then', 'second', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'replace', 'season', 'gave', 'away', 'Why', 'did', 'give', 'away', 'was', 'taking', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'did', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'putting', 'complete', 'series', 'packaging', 'third', 'party', 'was', 'uncertain', 'future', 'series', 'how', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'Luckily', 'season', 'one', 'cheaply', 'priced', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'purchasing', 'second', 'time.First', 'want', 'say', 'series', 'great', 'want', 'thank', 'using', 'dual', 'layered', 'dvds', 'hate', 'when', 'use', 'single', 'layer', 'condense', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'actually', 'miss', 'watching', 'old', '80s', '13', '34', 'black', 'white', 'tv', 'time', 'compression', 'fine', 'shows', 'are', 'funny', 'today', 'were', 'originally', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'watching', 'series', 'order', 'will', 'try', 'possible', 'watch', 'continuously', 'period', 'time', 'can', 'watch', 'chronologically', 'uninterrupted', 'look', 'series', 'coming', 'out', 'fast', 'enough', 'now', 'am', 'playing', 'catch', 'anyway', 'out', 'better', 'me.Like', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'writing', 'pitfalls', 'life', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'strong', 'central', 'character', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'equally', 'strong', 'supporting', 'players', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'Richard', 'Moll..as', 'well', 'others', 'Due', 'changing', 'characters', 'first', 'three', 'season', 'actually', 'had', 'feel', 'job', 'high', 'turnaround', 'rate', 'have', 'never', 'worked', 'criminal', 'justice', 'job', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'come', 'go', 'there', 'usually', 'core', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'stay', 'duration', 'show', 'realistic', 'sense', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'intentional', 'was', 'part', 'reason', 'due', 'untimely', 'deaths', 'key', 'characters', 'instead', 'crippling', 'show', 'actually', 'made', 'strength.Reinhold', 'Weege', 'top', 'game', 'Everyone', 'know', 'characters', 'interact', 'perfectly', 'hit', 'marks', 'flawlessly', 'Sure', 'first', 'season', 't', 'usual', 'growing', 'pains', 'moments', 'seem', 'step', 'series', 'whole', 'once', 'hit', 'stride', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'end', 'result', 'timeless', 'classic', 'jokes', 'are', 'still', 'funny', 'today', 'were', 'then', 'chemistry', 'unbelievable', 'times', 'actors', 'ARE', 'characters', 'just', 'joy', 'having', 'such', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'character', 'Cheers', 'never', 'failed', 'make', 'laugh', 'strenghts', 'acting/comedy', 'are', 'display', 'here', 'Larroquette', 'though', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'will', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'be', 'equally', 'ease', 'nuances', 'character', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'parts', 'too', 'are', 'not', 'permanent', 'did', 'not', 'wish', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'characters', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'great', 'add', 'overall', 'chemistry.One', 'minor', 'gripe', 'more', 'aimed', 'studio', 'who', 'put', 'out', 'packaging', 'fine', 'O-Ring', 'spine', 'cds', 'single', 'dvd', 'case', 'why', 'do', 'companies', 'not', 'track', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'chapters', 'really', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'th', 'e', 'option', 'watching', 'opening', 'jokes', 'then', 'skip', 'theme', 'go', 'next', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'missing', 'lots', 'series', 'only', 'sitcom', 'only', 'about', '22', 'mins', 'not', 'huge', 'thing', 'concern', 'Just', 'saying', 'personal', 'preference.But', 'anyone', 'picking', 'up', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'writing/directing', 'top', 'notch', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'cast', 'deliver', 'lines', 'presentation', 'here', 'great', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'old', 'show', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', 'are', 'top', 'times', 'very', 'disciplined', 'way', ""'ll"", 'find', 'laughing', 'even', 'realising', 'OLDER', 'show', 'will', 'seem', 'fresh', 'energetic', 'anything', 'there', 'today', 'are', 'few', 'references', 'here', 'there', 'are', 'dated', 'shows', 'have', 'problem', 'classic', 'comedy', 'classic/golden', 'era', 'television', 'original', '34', 'Must-See', '34', 'tv', 'when', 'executives', 'cared', 'more', 'content', 'quality', 'instant', 'commercial', 'success', 'show', 'one', 'million', 'so', 'pick', 'up', 'enjoy']",N/A

The characters are interesting to the point where they're almost three-dimensional, and the concept is original enough.

Sometimes the problems are intriguing, such as when a prostitute falls in love with Harry because he's actually nice to her, and sometimes they're not, such as when Bull takes care of an abandoned baby. The same is true for the resolutions to those problems - some good, some curious.There are many notable guest stars for this first season, including appearances by Michael J. Fox, Yakov Smirnoff and the late Barney Martin (the father on ""Seinfeld"").The extras on the disc are minimal. There is a commentary on the pilot episode by the series creator, Reinhold Weege, and a short documentary with interviews with Weege and Harry Anderson. Both pieces skirt around the issue of Karen Austin and Paula Kelly, going so far as to ignore them entirely in the documentary, save for a throw away line by Anderson about ""the girls"" in relation to the cast getting along so well in that first season.

Season one is a refreshing and very funny introduction to a cast of wacky characters that would soon become TV mainstays for a total of NINE seasons!!!The first few episodes do exhibit a bit of overacting as the actors try to find their footing, but that isn't unusual for a sitcom or any TV series for that matter. Fortunately the cast and the writers ""clicked"" after only a few episodes which translates into a very funny first season! You'll find yourself laughing out loud during many of the episodes!The first season consists of 13 episodes on two discs contained in a standard DVD case.

Funny thing about watching the complete first season of ""Night Court"" is that not all of the cast members that we got to know for most of the show's run were part of season one. There was no Christine, no Mac, and no Roz. Season one features the characters Liz, Lana, and Selma in those roles instead. ""Night Court"" went through several different cast changes for the first couple of seasons. It wouldn't be until season four (the 1986-87 season) that the entire cast featured on the show would stay together all the way until the end.""Night Court"" centers around the goingons at a New York courthouse during evening hours. Harry Anderson is judge (and sometimes magician) Harry Stone, John Larroquette is womanizing prosecutor Dan Fielding, and Richard Moll is the male (and very tall) bailiff Bull Shannon. These three actors played these roles from the show's first episode to the very last, and were very funny. Especially in season one. Karen Austin was court clerk Lana Wagner; Paula Kelly was public defender Liz Williams (Gail Strickland played the public defender in the pilot); and Selma Diamond was the female (and very short) bailiff Selma Hacker.""Night Court"" was a very funny show for most of its run, and it's first season (composed of 13 episodes) is a good one. But in my opinion it wouldn't reach total greatness until season four. That's when the show hit its peak, and was at its brightest and funniest.",4,Night Court: Season One,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,1532,"['Night', 'Court', 'first', 'came', 'mid-season', 'replacement', '1983-84', 'season', 'quickly', 'became', 'hit', 'Funny', 'thing', 'watching', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'Night', 'Court', 'not', 'cast', 'members', 'got', 'know', 'most', 'show', 'run', 'were', 'part', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'Christine', 'Mac', 'Roz', 'Season', 'one', 'characters', 'Liz', 'Lana', 'Selma', 'roles', 'instead', 'Night', 'Court', 'went', 'several', 'different', 'cast', 'changes', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'season', 'four', '1986-87', 'season', 'entire', 'cast', 'featured', 'show', 'would', 'stay', 'together', 'way', 'end', 'Night', 'Court', 'centers', 'goingons', 'New', 'York', 'courthouse', 'evening', 'hours', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'judge', 'sometimes', 'magician', 'Harry', 'Stone', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'womanizing', 'prosecutor', 'Dan', 'Fielding', 'Richard', 'Moll', 'male', 'very', 'tall', 'bailiff', 'Bull', 'Shannon', 'three', 'actors', 'played', 'roles', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'very', 'last', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'Especially', 'season', 'one', 'Karen', 'Austin', 'was', 'court', 'clerk', 'Lana', 'Wagner', 'Paula', 'Kelly', 'was', 'public', 'defender', 'Liz', 'Williams', 'Gail', 'Strickland', 'played', 'public', 'defender', 'pilot', 'Selma', 'Diamond', 'was', 'female', 'very', 'short', 'bailiff', 'Selma', 'Hacker', 'Night', 'Court', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'most', 'run', 'first', 'season', 'composed', '13', 'episodes', 'good', 'one', 'opinion', 'would', ""n't"", 'reach', 'total', 'greatness', 'season', 'four', 'when', 'show', 'hit', 'peak', 'was', 'brightest', 'funniest']",N/A

Lewkowicz ""fixxer316""","[5, 5]","Great to see a lot of classic TV being released on DVD, and this is no exception.Night Court was one of my favorite shows of the 80's, mostly because it had the zany feel that anything could happen (and frequently did).  However, despite all the zaniness, the characters were real, managing to break through their stereotypes and become genuine people.Of course, Season One isn't really about that (much).  For the most part, we get the strange quirks of the major characters.  Bull is the intimidating behemoth with the heart of gold, although he wouldn't be as dense as he would be in future seasons.Harry Stone is the wacky judge, managing to impress everyone with his unusual way of doing things, and being a fair judge in the process.Dan Fielding is a bit of a snob, and as the first season rolled on, we would see him become more and more of a lech.  This would really dominate his character in later seasons before they toned him down again in an attempt to ""mature"" his character.And then there is baliff Selma, who manages the crusty role quite nicely, managing to get a quip in that nicely sums up the situation.That was in essence the core of the first two seasons.  Yes, ther was Liz the public defender and Lana the court clerk, but they wouldn't make it to season two.  In fact, Lana didn't even make it to the end of the first season, which was kind of odd, because they never really wrote her out.  How hard would it have been to say that she was rotated out of the court?There are a number of good episodes here although even in the early part of the season there is some repitition (a nut comes into the court clamining to be he/she is something he/she is not, and almost has the gang believing, but even if it isn't true, they still gain something valuable from that person).  Still, we get some delightful interplay among the cast and the various guest stars.  Michael J Fox makes an early appearance here (this was about the same time as Family Ties' first season), and does a decent job as a bitter runaway, quite different from the Alex Keaton role.The extras here are skimpy, but decent.  You get Reinhold on commentary, and a featurrette with Reinhold and Harry Anderson describing the beginnings of the show (much of it covering the same territory).  They praise Larroquette for his physicality, but they never get into the story of why Karen didn't make it past episode 9 or 10.  I would have loved to have seen Markie Post and John Laroquette in on the featurette, or commentary, but perhaps that can come in future seasons.More to come.

871373,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0006N2EZK,Tim Janson,"[3, 5]","Night Court was a part of NBC's all-powerful Thursday Night lineup in the 1980's and early 90's that featured such long time running shows as ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Cheers"".  One could argue that Night Court benefitted from having been surrounded by so many great shows but it did survive for 9 years and remained in the Nielson Top 30 ratings for five straight seasons before beginning it's decline.The show took place almost entirely within the confines of a NY city night court presided over by Judge Harry Stone (Harry Anderson).  He's joined by prosecutor Dan Fielding (John Larroquette) Baliff Bull Shannon (Richard Moll), Court Clerk Mac (Charles Robinson) Baliff Selma (Selma Diamond) and defender Billie Young (Ellen Foley).  Foley was the weakest member of the cast and thankfully lasted only the first season and would be replaced by Markie Post in Season two.Each week a new set of crazies and small-time crooks would be brought before Judge Stone to have their case argued.  The standard penalty always seemed to be a ""$50 fine and time served!""  This was a show not unlike Barney Miller of the 1970's that featured an ensemble cast joined each week by a new group of screwballs, often played by guest stars such as John Astin, Carl Ballantine, and Harold Gould.While the humor in Night Court was decidedly low-brow and often crude, particularly as it related to the lecherous Dan Fielding, there's little doubt that of all NBC's Thursday comedies this was the one that usually had the most belly laughs.  Notable season one episodes:""Santa Goes Downtown"" The season is merry as Harry deals with a man in a red suit charged with trespassing and tries to restore the faith of a pair of cynical teenage runaways.""The Eye of the Beholder"" - The gang tries to pull Bull out of the dumps when he's turned down by a charitable organization because his size and appearance are intimidating to others.""Once in Love with Harry""  Dan Feilding loses in his bid for city council to a dead man!""Hi Honey, I'm Home"" - Harry has to settle the legal status of a woman who remarried after her first husband was mistakenly declared dead, and who wants her back.While Season One was a good kickoff to the series it really would not hit its stride until Post came on board during season two as she seemed to have much better chemistry with the rest of the cast than Foley did.
