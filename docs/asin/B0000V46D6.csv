My review, without spoilers:Scott Lowell's performance as Ted addicted to crystal meth is outstanding.  Peter Paige also does a spectacular job as Emmitt, Ted's boyfriend, trying to deal with the addition.  This saga within the series is one of the best parts of season three.That being said, I could have done without Hunter:  was he added to the show simply to have a twink on hand now that Justin is maturing?  Also, I would love to see just ONE episode where it isn't necessary for the cast to get their freak on at Babylon, the disco.I cringe when I see the illicit, casual sex and casual drug use on the show.  I will respect the writers' decision to include it, as it's part of gay life.  But the writers could be more inclusive of the diversity of opinions in the community by adding a character that is opposed to casual sex and recreational drug use.

784414,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0000V46D6,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 2]","Nominated for 9 Craft Awards (bestowed by the Director's Guild of Canada), Queer As Folk is a groundbreaking drama series that has built itself a large cult following since its inception in 2000. Based on a British TV series of the same name, Queer As Folk is in many ways similar to HBO's Sex And The City, and it's one of the first TV dramas to be completely centered around the lives of homosexual characters, or even have prominent homosexual characters - following on the heels of groundbreaking sitcoms such as Ellen (1994) and Will & Grace (1998). The brainchild of UK-born writer and creator Russell T. Davies, Queer As Folk follows the life and times of a group of gay friends as they live out their respective lives in modern-day America...Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Queer As Folk follows the exploits of a group of gay and lesbian friends who live on or around Liberty Avenue. Most of the scenes take place either in the character's homes, a local diner, or the popular gay nightclub Babylon. Lindsay Peterson (Thea Gill) and Melanie Marcus (Michelle Clunie) comprise the lone lesbian couple to star in the series, while various gay friends and neighbors such as Brian Kinney (Gale Harold), Michael Novotny-Bruckner (Hal Sparks), Justin Taylor (Randy Harrison), Ted Schmidt (Scott Lowell), Emmett Honeycutt (Peter Paige), etc. deal with each other and their own varying relationships. Composed in a drama/soap opera format, Queer As Folk centers wholly on the careers and lives (including sex, drugs, love, friendships, tragedies, etc.) of its diverse characters, maintaining a specific focus on its attempted realistic portrayal and illustration of the American homosexual lifestyle...The Queer As Folk (Season 3) DVD features a number of interesting episodes including the season premiere in which everyone is surprised to learn that Justin has broken up with Brian and is now in a relationship with Ethan. Brian sinks into depression, and Michael confronts Justin about the situation, telling him leave town and never come back. When Brian and Justin end up at Melanie and Lindsay's party, Brian attempts a reconciliation, but is rebuffed. After Michael badmouths Justin, Brian surprises everyone by punching him out... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Episode 305"" in which anti-gay Police Chief Stockwell is running for mayor and his campaign is the focus of everyone's activities on Liberty Avenue, and ""Episode 311"" in which everyone is frustrated by Stockwell's crackdown on Liberty Avenue while Emmett is concerned when a depressed Ted fails to come home one night...The DVD Report",4,A groundbreaking drama series...,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2620,"['Nominated', '9', 'Craft', 'Awards', 'bestowed', 'Director', 'Guild', 'Canada', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'groundbreaking', 'drama', 'series', 'built', 'large', 'cult', 'following', 'inception', '2000', 'Based', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'many', 'ways', 'similar', 'HBO', 'Sex', 'City', 'one', 'first', 'TV', 'dramas', 'be', 'completely', 'centered', 'lives', 'homosexual', 'characters', 'even', 'have', 'prominent', 'homosexual', 'characters', 'following', 'heels', 'groundbreaking', 'sitcoms', 'such', 'Ellen', '1994', 'Will', 'Grace', '1998', 'brainchild', 'UK-born', 'writer', 'creator', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'life', 'times', 'group', 'gay', 'friends', 'live', 'out', 'respective', 'lives', 'modern-day', 'America', 'Set', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pennsylvania', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'exploits', 'group', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'who', 'live', 'Liberty', 'Avenue', 'Most', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'either', 'character', 'homes', 'local', 'diner', 'popular', 'gay', 'nightclub', 'Babylon', 'Lindsay', 'Peterson', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Melanie', 'Marcus', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'comprise', 'lone', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'star', 'series', 'various', 'gay', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'such', 'Brian', 'Kinney', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'Michael', 'Novotny-Bruckner', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Justin', 'Taylor', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'Ted', 'Schmidt', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'Emmett', 'Honeycutt', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'etc', 'deal', 'other', 'own', 'varying', 'relationships', 'Composed', 'drama/soap', 'opera', 'format', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'centers', 'wholly', 'careers', 'lives', 'including', 'sex', 'drugs', 'love', 'friendships', 'tragedies', 'etc', 'diverse', 'characters', 'maintaining', 'specific', 'focus', 'attempted', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'illustration', 'American', 'homosexual', 'lifestyle', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'everyone', 'surprised', 'learn', 'Justin', 'broken', 'up', 'Brian', 'now', 'relationship', 'Ethan', 'Brian', 'sinks', 'depression', 'Michael', 'confronts', 'Justin', 'situation', 'telling', 'leave', 'town', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'When', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'end', 'up', 'Melanie', 'Lindsay', 'party', 'Brian', 'reconciliation', 'rebuffed', 'Michael', 'badmouths', 'Justin', 'Brian', 'everyone', 'punching', 'out', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Episode', '305', 'anti-gay', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Stockwell', 'running', 'mayor', 'campaign', 'focus', 'everyone', 'activities', 'Liberty', 'Avenue', 'Episode', '311', 'everyone', 'frustrated', 'Stockwell', 'crackdown', 'Liberty', 'Avenue', 'Emmett', 'concerned', 'when', 'depressed', 'Ted', 'come', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'DVD', 'Report']",Queer as Folk: Season 3
784415,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B0000V46D6,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[5, 7]","I suppose you could add accusations of pedophila to the list as well.  Season Three featured a mere 14 episodes (disappointing after seasons 1 and 2).  At about 45 minutes per episode, then racks up to only 10 1/2 hours of the brilliant but pompous Brian, the beautiful Justin, the too often pathetic Ted, the delightful Emmett, ""Mel and Linds"" - the token lesbians, the too often winey Michael, professor Ben, the artful Ethan, street hustler Hunter, and of course the outraguous and outspoken Debbie.  Ok, so do I like it or not?  I love it!  Kudos to Showtime, and the performers for bringing what I refer to as ""ground-breaking television"".  Seasons 1 and 2 were riveting. Season 3 missed the mark, but I hold the producers and directors accountable for that.  The season lacked depth, seems as we never really reached deep into the story lines.  The ensemble cast is wonderful, and for the most part, we all know someone who fits each characters role - to some extent.  I've never met Ted in my life.  I was about to write this reveiw after seeing 13 of the 14 epsiodes - but decided to wait until I completed the 14th and final episode of Season 3 (I own the DVD collections and do not get Showtime).  Because, and almost only because of epsiode 14, I give the season 3 FOUR STARS.  Without, 3 at best.  Somehow, we finally got focused again on what this show is all about.  Love and life in the GLBT world.  Debbie's closing words to Emmett are the reason why we NEED Queer As Folk (don't read ahead if you haven't seen the show yet): ""Mourn the losses because they're many; but celebrate the victories because they're few"".  Another reason we need this show is to REMIND us what it is we are supposed to be doing - standing up and speaking out for our rights!  If we don't keep doing, someone WILL come along and take them away.  Support Queer As Folk, and support Showtime.  Though many episodes may not exactly portray your reality of gay life, remember this is only television, and television rarely portrays ""real life"" (especially those reality shows).  But in our culture, there are nightclubs, bathhouses (or back rooms), overbearing Moms, young people on the streets, people living with HIV, politicians who would rather see us dead, and so on.  Queer As Folk is reality and each show is a reminder of our community.  If you don't like the gratutious sex (and I for one could manage to see far less anonymous sex on the show), ask Showtime to produce a non-cable version.  Does all this sex happen in our community?  I don't know because I don't partake in it, but I beleive in many of our larger metro areas it does.  So indeed, it too is reality.

pick him up and swing him around in the air, and then theres times where you wanna slap him, and theres times you want to pat the boy on the back. his character grew up on the show from 17-19, hes

 wether your gay, bi, tg/tv/ts, or just an openminded heterosexual, this show is for you, and yes there are one of two strait stories in this show just they dont tackel onto strait sex, except if you count emmettes sex with a gay chick for God, or the rather cute scene with daphne losing her virnity in season one &lt;ok this is how someone put it and i liked it, alot of girls experiment with there girl-friends before they have sex with boys cause their scared, well daphne didnt have girl-friends, she has justin so there ya go> (daphnes justins best friend, shes this sparky little thing who you cant help but love, even when brians mad he cant help but kiss her on the cheek :) and despite her not seeming to understand people sometimes she obviosly understands the boys on this show more than

784418,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B0000V46D6,Daryl B,"[0, 0]","I was ready to give up on Queer as Folk after Season 2.  I'm tired of seeing how many positions, how many partners, how many ways Brian can have sex.  But this Season, amid Brian's constant need to quench his lust, there were storylines and plots that were interesting.  Emmet and Ted's relationship hits a rather rocky spot, from which there was no turning back.  Debbie's relationship also becomes strained....while Michael and his professor take in an HIV + hustler.  Brian has to deal with the consequences of his terrific work in advertising for a client who is bent on destroying Pittsburg's gay community.  There are plenty of things going on this season with the character's, including Lindsey and Mel, which made this season, though shorter, much more interesting for me.  I'd love to see the writers and directors back of the sexual content (not completely) but enough to focus more on the characters and other facets of the gay community.  It seems anytime they do focus on another part of the gay community (such as a bear/leather bar) it is with comtempt and negativity. Anyone who is gay or has gay friends know that ""Queer as Folk"" certainly doesn't emcompass the complete gay experience.  But for the next season it would be nice to see QAF expand their horizons beyond the pretty boys we see on a regular basis.As far as the extra features, there is plenty there.  Photo galleries, a cool music video, behind the scenes with actors, etc.  Overall, if you are a fan of the show, you'll definitely wan to add this to your dvd library.

784419,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B0000V46D6,David Anderson,"[3, 4]","""Queer As Folk"" continues entertaining audiences as proven in this DVD set.  When the show debuted on Showtime in 2000, many wondered how long it can maintain its surprise and shock value.  Before its debut, only ""Will And Grace"" and ""Ellen"" had expored GLBT issues to such heights.  This offered issues that the community can relate to.  It's since earned numerous nominations from the GLAAD (Gays, Lesbians, and Allies Against Defamination) Awards for Outstanding TV sitcom.  The third season proves that it sustains its great quality while comprising new and interesting ideas.  It expresses many views that many unfortunately consider taboo and places it into their faces in great magnitudes.  Such daring techniques earn the cast and crew tremendous respect for doing what many would never consider.  The third season explores numerous issues for the first time: politics, hustling, drug abuse, and others.  The brilliant plot continues to entertain audiences as it has in the past.Those who have watched the first two seasons will notice some change in events and settings.  An unexpected hero arising to save a town from being led by a homophobic mayor candatite and crystal meth beginning to tumble the life of an unexpected man are only two events that will shock and mesmerize longtime fans.  Justin's break-up, the future of ""Rage"" comic book, and if best friends Ted and Emmitt's relationship blossoms into romance.  Viewers will notice a broader prospective on HIV/ AIDS as Ben suffers a life crisis after his friend/ ex-boyfriend dies of AIDS, leading to steroid use, and helps a 15-year-old hustler, later discovering they can relate to each other more than they planned.  Such chilling chain of events and others lead to a surprising conclusion that leaves audiences anxiously awaiting for season four.The variety of personalities within the characters offer greater viewing entertainment.  Without it, ""Queer As Folk"" wouldn't have as much impact.  The actors express their individual character's traits wonderfully.  Michelle Clunie (Mel), Thea Gill (Lindsay), Robert Gant (Ben), Scott Lowell (Ted), Peter Paige (Emmitt), Gale Howard (Brian), Hal Sparks (Michael), Randy Harrison (Justin), and Sharon Gless (Debbie) star.  Their talents alone greatly express the characters' development throughout the season.After viewing the whole season, those pleased with the DVD set should also watch the bonus features.  Kristine W.'s new music video is great to dance to.  The features and facts about the show's background and the creation are interesting.  Viewers will learn about the creation and the secrets of Babylon, the actors' history before and during the show, and more.  Specials on some actors' activism, participation in gay parades, autograph signing festivals offer more of their background on their acting influences.""Queer As Folk"" third season edition proves that it will remain on the air for a while longer.  This series of episodes is sure to pleases audiences.  Those interested in this should watch the first and the second season first.  Otherwise, the chain of events will be confusing.",5,Queer As Folk Continues To Please,1084579200,"05 15, 2004",2004,3122,"['Queer', 'Folk', 'entertaining', 'audiences', 'proven', 'DVD', 'set', 'When', 'show', 'debuted', 'Showtime', '2000', 'many', 'wondered', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'maintain', 'surprise', 'shock', 'value', 'debut', 'only', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Ellen', 'had', 'expored', 'GLBT', 'issues', 'such', 'heights', 'offered', 'issues', 'community', 'can', 'relate', 'earned', 'numerous', 'nominations', 'GLAAD', 'Gays', 'Lesbians', 'Allies', 'Against', 'Defamination', 'Awards', 'Outstanding', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'third', 'season', 'great', 'quality', 'comprising', 'new', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'many', 'views', 'many', 'unfortunately', 'consider', 'taboo', 'places', 'great', 'magnitudes', 'Such', 'daring', 'techniques', 'earn', 'cast', 'crew', 'tremendous', 'respect', 'doing', 'what', 'many', 'would', 'never', 'consider', 'third', 'season', 'numerous', 'issues', 'first', 'time', 'politics', 'hustling', 'drug', 'abuse', 'others', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'past.Those', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'notice', 'change', 'events', 'settings', 'unexpected', 'hero', 'arising', 'save', 'town', 'being', 'led', 'homophobic', 'mayor', 'candatite', 'crystal', 'meth', 'beginning', 'tumble', 'life', 'unexpected', 'man', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'events', 'will', 'shock', 'mesmerize', 'longtime', 'fans', 'Justin', 'break-up', 'future', 'Rage', 'comic', 'book', 'best', 'friends', 'Ted', 'Emmitt', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'romance', 'Viewers', 'will', 'notice', 'broader', 'prospective', 'HIV/', 'AIDS', 'Ben', 'life', 'crisis', 'friend/', 'ex-boyfriend', 'dies', 'AIDS', 'leading', 'steroid', 'use', '15-year-old', 'hustler', 'later', 'discovering', 'can', 'relate', 'other', 'more', 'planned', 'Such', 'chilling', 'chain', 'events', 'others', 'lead', 'surprising', 'conclusion', 'audiences', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'season', 'four.The', 'variety', 'personalities', 'characters', 'offer', 'greater', 'viewing', 'entertainment', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'impact', 'actors', 'express', 'individual', 'character', 'traits', 'wonderfully', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'Mel', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Lindsay', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'Ben', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'Ted', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'Emmitt', 'Gale', 'Howard', 'Brian', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Michael', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'Justin', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Debbie', 'star', 'talents', 'alone', 'greatly', 'express', 'characters', 'development', 'season.After', 'viewing', 'whole', 'season', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'set', 'should', 'also', 'watch', 'bonus', 'features', 'Kristine', 'W.', 'new', 'music', 'video', 'great', 'dance', 'features', 'facts', 'show', 'background', 'creation', 'are', 'interesting', 'Viewers', 'will', 'learn', 'creation', 'secrets', 'Babylon', 'actors', 'history', 'show', 'more', 'Specials', 'actors', 'activism', 'participation', 'gay', 'parades', 'autograph', 'signing', 'festivals', 'offer', 'more', 'background', 'acting', 'influences', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'third', 'season', 'edition', 'will', 'remain', 'air', 'while', 'longer', 'series', 'episodes', 'sure', 'pleases', 'audiences', 'interested', 'should', 'watch', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'Otherwise', 'chain', 'events', 'will', 'be', 'confusing']",Queer as Folk: Season 3

I loved the conflict between Brian and Stockwell and the Michael/Ben/Hunter dynamic. And I also enjoyed the focus on the drama instead of the sex but it wasn't as captivating.I hated that they had broken-up Ethan and Justin. It didn't fit how they broke them up. Ethan had way too much passion and love for Justin just to go out and cheat on him. It was all to get the ""golden couple"" Brian and Justin back together. I am not big fan of that couple to begin with. So I didn't like that. I also wasn't a big fan of the Ted's addiction to meth storyline. It made no sense.

I have read the reviews and I see people are upset by the ""dullness"" of the season when in reality it is the most exciting.Season three shows every character growing and rounding out their characteristics and behaviors.The character Brian begins to take a stand on what is important and though most people do not like him, I admit he and Melanie are my favorites.Justin also takes a stand and this time he stands up to someone who hurts him. And as he says, ""Brian never made me promises, you did."" I think people have been forgetting that broken promises can be as heartbreaking as anything else.Melanie and Lindsay this season take a very interesting turn. Lindsay becomes much more dominant and Melanie seems to have a new respect for her partner that shows in her decision making.Onto Ted and Emmit. I adore Ted's character (he is most like the gay men I know, insecure but wonderful.) His dark fall into the world of drugs should be seen as acting gold. And Emmit's support of a lover and his own heartbreak (and career moves) are thrilling. Though he does seem to play the abused housewife.Michael and Ben. Oh, what to say. This relationship grows the most this season. We see a loving couple grapple with issues from work to home and overcome them all. I adore both characters and this season shows their personalities in sync.One thing I miss and of course thank you womever for mentioning it... Michael and Brian's friendship has been pushed to just three or four scenes out of the entire season.

784423,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B0000V46D6,James Hiller,"[2, 6]","A long time QAF fan, who is not priviledged enough to have premium channels, eagerly await the release of the latest season on DVD to find out what happens with some of the most cutting edge characters on television.It's hard to not find out tidbits of that season's developments, from reading messages boards to friend's gossip. Finally, after viewing all episodes of season three, I must admit to be both stunned and somewhat disappointed in this season.First, the disappointments. Without going into specifics, season three starts out very strong with the amazing ending of season two, yet the promises made at the end weren't necessarily fulfilled in this season. There is somewhat of a let down with two major stories, and another one, involving Ben and Michael, that seemed very out of place with the series.Also, both season one and two had &quot;big episodes&quot; where everything seemed to soar above the series, for example Michael's birthday party, season two's wedding and Rage party. Season three offered nothing of that caliber, which was sorely missed.But, that is also part of the brilliance of season three. First, the direction of the episodes is nothing short of brilliant. I suppose you aren't supposed to notice the directing if you are involved with the story, but I simply couldn't resist seeing these episodes as mini-movies. The direction is cutting edge and astounding. Each episode seemed tailored to match the directing with the plot, and the effect mesmerized me.Based on the plot of the story, many of the actors soared in their performances too. Scott Lowell as Ted should be recongized ans awarded for his amazing turn as Ted's decends into darkness this season. It wasn't easy to watch, but Lowell nailed it.  His compatriot, Peter Paige plays Emmett both with strength and compassion, giving his character a new and much needed edge than we've ever seen before. And add new character &quot;Hunter&quot;, newcomer Harris Allen gives an edge to the show, who is extremely convincing.In watching this season, I was mixed on my feelings about it, up until the amazing final episode where it finally seems that the gang on Liberty Avenue seems to be back. I suggest giving season three a chance, watch it, let the great directing and acting wash over you, and spend some time with some amazing characters played by equally amazing actors.",3,Season Three - Both Brilliant and Mundane,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,2368,"['long', 'time', 'QAF', 'fan', 'who', 'not', 'priviledged', 'enough', 'have', 'premium', 'channels', 'eagerly', 'await', 'release', 'latest', 'season', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'most', 'cutting', 'edge', 'characters', 'television.It', 'hard', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'tidbits', 'season', 'developments', 'reading', 'messages', 'boards', 'friend', 'gossip', 'Finally', 'viewing', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'must', 'admit', 'be', 'stunned', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'season.First', 'disappointments', 'going', 'specifics', 'season', 'three', 'out', 'very', 'strong', 'amazing', 'ending', 'season', 'two', 'promises', 'made', 'end', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'fulfilled', 'season', 'somewhat', 'let', 'down', 'two', 'major', 'stories', 'one', 'involving', 'Ben', 'Michael', 'seemed', 'very', 'place', 'series.Also', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'had', 'quot', 'big', 'episodes', 'quot', 'where', 'everything', 'seemed', 'soar', 'series', 'example', 'Michael', 'birthday', 'party', 'season', 'two', 'wedding', 'Rage', 'party', 'Season', 'three', 'offered', 'nothing', 'caliber', 'was', 'sorely', 'missed.But', 'also', 'part', 'brilliance', 'season', 'three', 'First', 'direction', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'suppose', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'notice', 'directing', 'are', 'involved', 'story', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'mini-movies', 'direction', 'cutting', 'edge', 'astounding', 'episode', 'seemed', 'tailored', 'match', 'directing', 'plot', 'effect', 'mesmerized', 'me.Based', 'plot', 'story', 'many', 'actors', 'soared', 'performances', 'too', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'Ted', 'should', 'be', 'recongized', 'ans', 'awarded', 'amazing', 'turn', 'Ted', 'decends', 'darkness', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'watch', 'Lowell', 'nailed', 'compatriot', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'Emmett', 'strength', 'compassion', 'giving', 'character', 'new', 'much', 'needed', 'edge', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'add', 'new', 'character', 'quot', 'Hunter', 'quot', 'newcomer', 'Harris', 'Allen', 'edge', 'show', 'who', 'extremely', 'convincing.In', 'watching', 'season', 'was', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'up', 'amazing', 'final', 'episode', 'where', 'finally', 'gang', 'Liberty', 'Avenue', 'be', 'back', 'suggest', 'giving', 'season', 'three', 'chance', 'watch', 'let', 'great', 'directing', 'acting', 'wash', 'spend', 'time', 'amazing', 'characters', 'played', 'equally', 'amazing', 'actors']",Queer as Folk: Season 3

Season 3 even though it was shorter, did alot of things with the lives of the characters & storylines. Justin deals with making a decision only to have it blow up in his face (Ethan) & then decides that he wants Brian. Justin also realises that Brian does love him, but Brian doesn't have to say it. Because Brian always showed him that. Actions speak louder than words. I feel like Justin matured even more in this season. Ted turns into Blake pretty much & gets addicted to crystal which obviously devestates Emmett. We watch Ted's actions tear apart his and Emmett's relationship as well as his relationship with his friends. The whole season will have you in suspense with the whole Stockwell case. Brian is helping Stockwell, the biggest homophobic candidate for mayor of Pittsburgh, get elected. But in the end, well I won't give it away. But from episode one to fourteen, there are no fillers, just lots and lots of great episodes that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. The cast is as amazing as ever, they all have such amazing chemistry together. Plus season 3 is where Brian & Justin reunite for one of the best Queer As Folk episodes ever. There's just alot of big AND little things that happened in this season that make it just as solid as seasons one and two even though it was alot shorter. Season 3 is definetly a bridge between being boys and becoming men. Alot happens here, alot of drama, alot of humor, alot of heartache, alot of fabulous music...something you can expect from a great show like QAF. It definetly has earned its rightful place in gay and television history. Season 3 is a musthave for QAF fans. I reccomend it for everyone. You'll love it!

A brush with the law brings Ted's world crashing down, leading to a rift in his romance with Emmett, while Michael and Ben take responsibility for young street hustler Hunter, who complicates their lives. Mel and Lindsay decide to have another child, and Debbie struggles to gain justice for a gay teenager whose murder wasn't properly investigated or resolved.Still potent and sexy, and still fired by a nice line in sarcastic wit, the third season of ""Queer as Folk"" is a marked improvement over the rudderless Season Two, with a greater emphasis on drama and social issues than ever before. There's still plenty of comedy (Hunter's first encounter with Brian is as funny as it is profane), and the raunch factor is as strong as always, but the stories are no longer dependent on mere shock value, and are linked by the machinations of a corrupt former cop whose political ambitions have a direct bearing on the lives of the central characters.With only 14 episodes this time out (as opposed to 22 in Season One and 20 in Season Two), the narrative turns darker as it progresses, as various characters reach a crossroads in their relationships, and an unsolved murder leads to a series of dramatic revelations. Gale Harold still dominates proceedings as Brian, an ambiguous character whose contempt for the world is matched only by his love for the friends with whom he shares it, but the entire cast is given room to shine, and they seize the opportunity with a vengeance. In such a strong ensemble, Harris Allan (Hunter) stands out as the hardened hustler whose abrasive personality masks a profound desire for companionship and acceptance, while ultra-sexy Fabrizio Filippo - whose character (Ethan) demonstrated the greatest potential for recurrent storylines - is sadly wasted in a minor role which concludes rather too abruptly (still, you get to see him naked in Episode One!!). Elsewhere, Jack Wetherall (Vic), Makyla Smith (Daphne) and Sherry Miller (Justin's mom) make strong but fleeting appearances, and there are brief cameos from several other QAF alumni, including Dean Armstrong (Blake) and John Furey (Justin's dad). The scripts are stronger, tighter, and more focused than ever before, and the whole thing culminates in a glorious finale that's VERY different from previous seasons. A triumph.",4,As potent and sexy as ever!!,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,2655,"['QUEER', 'AS', 'FOLK', 'Season', 'Three', 'USA', '2003', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1Soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'DigitalJustin', 'relationship', 'Ethan', 'compromised', 'continued', 'feelings', 'Brian', 'fact', 'Brian', 'now', 'working', 'right-wing', 'mayoral', 'candidate', ""'family-friendly"", 'policies', 'have', 'begun', 'affect', 'lives', 'everyone', 'Liberty', 'Avenue', 'brush', 'law', 'Ted', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'leading', 'rift', 'romance', 'Emmett', 'Michael', 'Ben', 'take', 'responsibility', 'young', 'street', 'hustler', 'Hunter', 'who', 'lives', 'Mel', 'Lindsay', 'decide', 'have', 'child', 'Debbie', 'struggles', 'gain', 'justice', 'gay', 'teenager', 'murder', 'was', ""n't"", 'properly', 'investigated', 'resolved.Still', 'potent', 'sexy', 'still', 'fired', 'nice', 'line', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'third', 'season', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'marked', 'improvement', 'rudderless', 'Season', 'Two', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'drama', 'social', 'issues', 'ever', 'before', 'still', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'Hunter', 'first', 'encounter', 'Brian', 'as', 'funny', 'profane', 'raunch', 'factor', 'as', 'strong', 'always', 'stories', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'dependent', 'mere', 'shock', 'value', 'are', 'linked', 'machinations', 'corrupt', 'former', 'cop', 'political', 'ambitions', 'have', 'direct', 'bearing', 'lives', 'central', 'characters.With', 'only', '14', 'episodes', 'time', 'out', 'opposed', '22', 'Season', 'One', '20', 'Season', 'Two', 'narrative', 'darker', 'various', 'characters', 'reach', 'crossroads', 'relationships', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'series', 'dramatic', 'revelations', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'still', 'proceedings', 'Brian', 'ambiguous', 'character', 'contempt', 'world', 'matched', 'only', 'love', 'friends', 'whom', 'shares', 'entire', 'cast', 'given', 'room', 'shine', 'seize', 'opportunity', 'vengeance', 'such', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'Harris', 'Allan', 'Hunter', 'out', 'hardened', 'hustler', 'abrasive', 'personality', 'profound', 'desire', 'companionship', 'acceptance', 'ultra-sexy', 'Fabrizio', 'Filippo', 'character', 'Ethan', 'demonstrated', 'greatest', 'potential', 'recurrent', 'storylines', 'sadly', 'wasted', 'minor', 'role', 'rather', 'too', 'abruptly', 'still', 'get', 'see', 'naked', 'Episode', 'One', 'Elsewhere', 'Jack', 'Wetherall', 'Vic', 'Makyla', 'Smith', 'Daphne', 'Sherry', 'Miller', 'Justin', 'mom', 'make', 'strong', 'fleeting', 'appearances', 'are', 'brief', 'cameos', 'several', 'other', 'QAF', 'alumni', 'including', 'Dean', 'Armstrong', 'Blake', 'John', 'Furey', 'Justin', 'dad', 'scripts', 'are', 'stronger', 'tighter', 'more', 'focused', 'ever', 'whole', 'thing', 'culminates', 'glorious', 'finale', 'VERY', 'different', 'previous', 'seasons', 'triumph']",Queer as Folk: Season 3

This show makes it seem like being a gay male in America is just as easy as being straight. They're only usually portrayed in the midst of the gay culture. I would like to see more honesty. Because in this patriarchal, homophobic racist culture being the ""other"" is not easy like this show would have it seem. They don't ever touch on the fact that in most states in America one could get fired for being homosexual. There are no laws that protect against it. Brian, who is a fairly affluent business man would always have to live a double life. He couldn't really be that openly gay in a business world, where hyper masculinity reigns. I would like to see how the characters deal with this prejudice in their everyday lives. They only touch it briefly in the first episode. Also all of the characters are white males ( and women).

Our beloved friends and characters have moved on in their lives, and this season is a turning point for many of them. I do not want to spoil the plot for those still waiting to see this, but be prepared to see a changed Brian, a fun-loving but tougher Justin, Emmett and Ted's turmoil and a new life for the lesbian duo. Of course, this show would be incomplete without Debbie, dinner-diva. There is also a new character on the scene, young Hunter, who brings about a much-needed improvement to Michael's worrying wallflower attitude.The season spans over the duration of a political campaign for a new mayor of Pittsburg, and the lives of all characters are directly and indirectly affected by the ex-police chief and running candidate Stockwell. Interspersed with serious themes and events are charming scenes, nightclubs, sex, drugs, love, work, school and all the other things that form part of daily life. Of course, the sex is what stands out for a lot of people, but after the first two episodes, this becomes more like background music and the camera hones in on the characters.Certainly, the sheer abundance and exposure of sex and drugs is what makes this show edge and ""out there"". The producers are careful, however, to show the unglamorous aspects as well as the glamorous ones and don't view the world through rose-tinted glasses. It's realistic, it's in-your-face and it's powerful.It's really too bad that there isn't more of it. Season 1 and 2 had at least 20 episodes, this one has only 14 - so you're getting less for your money, although the quality remains high (and the music fantastic). The box set does come with lots of extras, both for the DVD and computer.

784435,AIRHRV3D8X4J1,B0000V46D6,"Porfie Medina ""Porfie Jr. Medina""","[169, 188]","QUEER AS FOLK is still one of the most amazing TV Shows ever and is a landmark as the show for the new millennium. This New Queer As Folk Season 3 DVD Box Set has all 14 episodes of the third season of one of the most controversial and bravest series on television today. The BOX SET includes Bonus features such as: Behind-the-camera, Hot Summer Days, Wrap Party Reel, Enter Babylon LA, Meet the Folks, Animated Photo Gallery, Season Four Sneak Preview, Weblink, Music Videos, and a few other surprises.  I have seen all 14 episodes of Season 3 and it is another great season with some major twists. I am a little upset that this season is very short when compared to season 1 and 2, which both had about 7 or 8 more episodes, but either way it is still a good season. I am still amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Not every gay person lives a life like these guys, and I sure don't but that&#65533;s not what this show is about. Queer As Folk ia about the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic sex scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the balls to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show is as close as it gets to real life. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something that we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between.

Aside from Michael's delightful angst regarding fathering the girls' next baby, there's a pretty dark shadow that prevails. My favorite character, Ted, makes his most irresponsible decision; Michael has to deal with other drug problems affecting him; Brian shows more apathy than usual; Justin's new love goes awry; and lots of other stuff that I don't wanna give away. What keeps this amazing series alive is the unflinching and seamless consistancy of the actors/characters. Nothing is compromised, and it's Brian, of all people, who ends up smelling like a rose (at least to those close to him). I think in this 3rd series, Ted (Scott Lowell) carries the acting honors, though Justin (Randy Harrison) comes very close.

784438,A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1,B0000V46D6,"Savant11 ""Savant11""","[14, 55]","Everything that made QAF  unique and special during the first 2 seasons was ruined in Season 3.  For me QAF gave us a no holds barred look at (Gen-X) life, was true to life and was politically in-correct.  But that all changed this season. It  was all over the place, it lacked pacing, a coherent plot, the stories were forced, contrived and it was politically correct.First of all it was boring,  For some of the episodes I found myself forward fasting through  scenes of characters I didn't care for.  I never did this in Season 1& 2 (with the exception of the graphic sex scenes).I wasn't certain how the Stockwell story was going to play out at first. I found it really neat that Brian was bonding with this politician who was on the other end of the political spectrum on him. I wasn't quite certain whether Brian was falling for Stockwell or maybe just saw in him the father he never had. Whatever it was I just thought that it was neat that for once Brian was bonding with a guy on his level without the usual wall of arrogance he hides behind.  Then the writers got what I call ""politically correct"" by having Brian and the rest of the gang turn on Stockwell. Yes the guy was a conservative. But the term ""fascist"" was a bit extreme and un called for.  The characters in the story wanted tolerance however they had absolutely none for anyone who did not think the way that they did. I found the whole thing rather hypocritical.  It also added to the inconsistency of the whole plot. First of all Brian is the one who approached Stockwell to work for him, despite knowing that Stockwell was a conservative politician. He even went back to Stockwell to try to help his campaign after, Stockwell fired him.  Something I never thought that a proud and arrogant man like Brian would do.  THEN he tries to bring down tries to bring Stockwell down.  Going so far as to torpedo his career (which he went to great lengths to salvage last season) and why does Brian do all this? Because he can't have sex in a public place.  How lame is that? It looked as if the creators thought that it was a pretty lame excuse as well. Which is why they seemed to turn to bringing  down Stockwell on the basis of his covering up a murder. Which again adds to the inconsistency from last season since I distinctly remember Brian's reaction last year at seeing ""Dumpster Boy's"" dead body. He smirks and flippantly says ""Let's go eat"" (or something to that effect). He obviously didn't care about the dead boy before, he does now?I also hated the abrupt ending of the relationship between Justin and Ethan. It was as if the creators simply wanted Ethan out of the picture, so they had him cheat on Justin.  Which I found strange considering the amount of love and affection he showed Justin in the first place. I guess I am probably the only person who doesn't like Brian and Justin together. As much as I respect Randy Harrisson as an actor. He is not exactly the most virile man around. I would have really preferred for Brian to be with a guy more on his level (like David from season 1). Randy and Fabio (Ethan) had way much more chemistry.Surprisingly what saved me this season were  my least favorite characters. Ben and Ted.I never liked Robert Gant. I found his performances wooden and unispiring. He looks as if he should be acting on a day time soap.  However I really enjoyed him reaching out to Hunter and trying to help him.  It was done in a very realistic and non-sappy way.  The same for Ted's issue with drugs.  This was probably the best anti-drug storyline I've ever seen. Since it actually showed us why Ted turned to them-to hide from the loathing he feels for himself.  Ted is not my favorite character on this show, but if I had to say who had the best and most realistic storyline this season it had to be him.And it was too bad that Lindsey and Melanie weren't used much more.If the creators can't think of anything more original to come up with then perhaps it is time to just cancel the show after season 4. I don't know if QAF is back for a 4th season but I truly hope they clear up the mess from this year.",1,What Happened??????,1067990400,"11 5, 2003",2003,4116,"['Everything', 'made', 'QAF', 'unique', 'special', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'was', 'ruined', 'Season', '3', 'QAF', 'gave', 'barred', 'look', 'Gen-X', 'life', 'was', 'true', 'life', 'was', 'politically', 'in-correct', 'changed', 'season', 'was', 'place', 'lacked', 'pacing', 'coherent', 'plot', 'stories', 'were', 'forced', 'contrived', 'was', 'politically', 'correct.First', 'was', 'boring', 'episodes', 'found', 'forward', 'fasting', 'scenes', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'never', 'did', 'Season', '1', '2', 'exception', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', '.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'certain', 'how', 'Stockwell', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'first', 'found', 'really', 'Brian', 'was', 'bonding', 'politician', 'who', 'was', 'other', 'end', 'political', 'spectrum', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'certain', 'Brian', 'was', 'falling', 'Stockwell', 'maybe', 'just', 'saw', 'father', 'never', 'had', 'was', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'neat', 'once', 'Brian', 'was', 'bonding', 'guy', 'level', 'usual', 'wall', 'arrogance', 'Then', 'writers', 'got', 'what', 'call', 'politically', 'correct', 'having', 'Brian', 'rest', 'gang', 'turn', 'Stockwell', 'Yes', 'guy', 'was', 'conservative', 'term', 'fascist', 'was', 'bit', 'extreme', 'un', 'called', 'characters', 'story', 'wanted', 'tolerance', 'however', 'had', 'absolutely', 'none', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'way', 'did', 'found', 'whole', 'thing', 'rather', 'hypocritical', 'also', 'added', 'inconsistency', 'whole', 'plot', 'First', 'Brian', 'one', 'who', 'approached', 'Stockwell', 'work', 'knowing', 'Stockwell', 'was', 'conservative', 'politician', 'even', 'went', 'back', 'Stockwell', 'try', 'help', 'campaign', 'Stockwell', 'fired', 'Something', 'never', 'thought', 'proud', 'arrogant', 'man', 'Brian', 'would', 'do', 'THEN', 'bring', 'down', 'tries', 'bring', 'Stockwell', 'down', 'Going', 'so', 'far', 'torpedo', 'career', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'salvage', 'last', 'season', 'why', 'Brian', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'sex', 'public', 'place', 'How', 'lame', 'looked', 'creators', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'excuse', 'well', 'Which', 'why', 'seemed', 'turn', 'bringing', 'down', 'Stockwell', 'basis', 'covering', 'up', 'murder', 'Which', 'again', 'inconsistency', 'last', 'season', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'Brian', 'reaction', 'last', 'year', 'seeing', 'Dumpster', 'Boy', 'dead', 'body', 'flippantly', 'Let', 'go', 'eat', 'something', 'effect', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'dead', 'boy', 'before', 'now', 'also', 'hated', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'relationship', 'Justin', 'Ethan', 'was', 'creators', 'simply', 'wanted', 'Ethan', 'picture', 'had', 'cheat', 'Justin', 'Which', 'found', 'strange', 'considering', 'amount', 'love', 'affection', 'showed', 'Justin', 'first', 'place', 'guess', 'am', 'probably', 'only', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'together', 'As', 'much', 'respect', 'Randy', 'Harrisson', 'actor', 'not', 'exactly', 'most', 'virile', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'preferred', 'Brian', 'be', 'guy', 'more', 'level', 'David', 'season', '1', 'Randy', 'Fabio', 'Ethan', 'had', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'chemistry.Surprisingly', 'what', 'saved', 'season', 'were', 'least', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Ben', 'Ted.I', 'never', 'liked', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'found', 'performances', 'wooden', 'unispiring', 'should', 'be', 'acting', 'day', 'time', 'soap', 'However', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'reaching', 'out', 'Hunter', 'trying', 'help', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'realistic', 'non-sappy', 'way', 'same', 'Ted', 'issue', 'drugs', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'anti-drug', 'storyline', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'actually', 'showed', 'why', 'Ted', 'turned', 'them-to', 'hide', 'loathing', 'Ted', 'not', 'favorite', 'character', 'show', 'had', 'say', 'who', 'had', 'best', 'most', 'realistic', 'storyline', 'season', 'had', 'be', 'him.And', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'Lindsey', 'Melanie', 'were', ""n't"", 'used', 'much', 'more.If', 'creators', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'more', 'original', 'come', 'up', 'then', 'perhaps', 'time', 'just', 'cancel', 'show', 'season', '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'QAF', 'back', '4th', 'season', 'truly', 'hope', 'clear', 'up', 'mess', 'year']",Queer as Folk: Season 3

Enough crystal drama for the newly coupled Ted and Emmett, and definitely a big enough mouth for enough fabulous mama Debbie. Season Three also tend to consolate the gay activists by creating a win-win result over a election campaign, and add one more new member to the Diner's family, a teenage street hustler named Hunter, who came around a little rather imaginative for the storyline. However, not enough has been explored on a few members of this family.I personally feel Melanie and Emmett are actually two potentially very explorable characters among the gang that would give the directors a good run of scripts. Melanie's coming strong in-your-face dyke attitude should be treated with a little extra indepth focus and Emmett's flamboyant outshell may as well worth a closer look.
