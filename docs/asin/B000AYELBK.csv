These are a little more difficult for my 2 year old but I'm still happy with them because I know that she'll eventually get more into them. Right now her favorite is the first one. We have watched these too;but, she keeps going back to the first in the series. I'm sure as she grows, we'll move up to the more difficult poses. I'm happy because I can really see her doing this for years to come and it gets me up and moving too. I can see it really helping for anger management and stress release when we get to those issues too. :)",5,A little more challenging for my 2 year old but still good,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,609,"['bought', 'go', 'first', 'DVD', 'release', 'so', ""'d"", 'have', 'full', 'set', '3', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'difficult', '2', 'year', 'old', ""'m"", 'still', 'happy', 'know', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'get', 'more', 'Right', 'now', 'favorite', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'watched', 'too', 'going', 'back', 'first', 'series', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'move', 'up', 'more', 'difficult', 'poses', ""'m"", 'happy', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'doing', 'years', 'come', 'moving', 'too', 'can', 'see', 'really', 'helping', 'anger', 'management', 'stress', 'release', 'when', 'get', 'issues', 'too']",Gaiam Kids: Yogakids Fun Collection
935118,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B000AYELBK,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[2, 2]","My kids, ages 5 and 3, absolutely love these videos and ask for them over and over. They are a great deal for the price too. The children in the videos range from preschool to early elementary, and that is really the age range these are targeted to. The workouts are a bit long, my kids rarely do an entire DVD in one showing, but that is OK with me. Frankly, they love watching these as much as doing them, so I do use them in the car too for long drives. They find these videos entertaining because the instructor is very silly, and encourages the kids in the video to be that way too.Per some of the complaints, it's true that many of the poses are not orthodox yoga asanas, and that the workouts do not flow in the way that a good adult class would. I think that is fine, and actually a plus, because these are specifically designed for the attention spans and bodies of young children. So if you are looking for a DVD to do alongside your child, these probably aren't it. But if you just want something entertaining that will whet their whistle for yoga, you can't beat these.",5,Excellent for Young Kids - Not Meant for Adults,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,1081,"['kids', '5', '3', 'absolutely', 'videos', 'ask', 'over', 'are', 'great', 'deal', 'price', 'too', 'children', 'videos', 'range', 'preschool', 'early', 'elementary', 'really', 'age', 'range', 'are', 'targeted', 'workouts', 'are', 'bit', 'long', 'kids', 'rarely', 'do', 'entire', 'DVD', 'one', 'showing', 'OK', 'Frankly', 'love', 'watching', 'as', 'much', 'doing', 'so', 'do', 'use', 'car', 'too', 'long', 'drives', 'find', 'videos', 'entertaining', 'instructor', 'very', 'silly', 'kids', 'video', 'be', 'way', 'too.Per', 'complaints', 'true', 'many', 'poses', 'are', 'not', 'orthodox', 'yoga', 'asanas', 'workouts', 'do', 'not', 'flow', 'way', 'good', 'adult', 'class', 'would', 'think', 'fine', 'actually', 'plus', 'are', 'specifically', 'designed', 'attention', 'spans', 'bodies', 'young', 'children', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'DVD', 'do', 'alongside', 'child', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'want', 'something', 'entertaining', 'will', 'whet', 'whistle', 'yoga', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat']",Gaiam Kids: Yogakids Fun Collection

He tries to follow along & do the yoga (it's so funny). There are some ""classic"" yoga poses modified for little ones and some exercizes that are mostly movement and using imagination rather than poses. The teacher is very fun (looks like she's having fun) and warm and has a kind voice.",5,Fun for active little ones,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,406,"['had', 'Yoga', 'Kids', 'video', 'tape', 'older', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'got', 'one', 'toddler', 'follow', 'along', 'do', 'yoga', 'so', 'funny', 'are', 'classic', 'yoga', 'poses', 'modified', 'little', 'ones', 'exercizes', 'are', 'mostly', 'movement', 'using', 'imagination', 'rather', 'poses', 'teacher', 'very', 'fun', 'having', 'fun', 'warm', 'kind', 'voice']",Gaiam Kids: Yogakids Fun Collection

They are learning the names of the poses, and actually correct me when I make a mistake on the names! We have been doing yoga for several months now. The boys are ridiculously bendy. They watch me and attempt to 'help' me go into a move more deeply. I cannot do half the stretching those kids do. The dvds are not condescending, they are fun, and they hold my kids interest. I branched out and bought them 'Animal Yoga'. It is horrible. I could never recommend that video. It is cheaper, but it is not worth it.I look forward to trying Yoga kids 1.
