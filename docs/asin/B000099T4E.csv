It shouldn't, at least on some levels, but it manages to come through on all. I blame the acting. A pretty believeable ensomble even though a couple of the sceans are over the top. Great cast. Excessive praise for Jeremy Sumpter, who plays the easily likeable Skeeter & who was also quite likeable, despite his evil crazed beliefs, in Frailty. I look forward to future endevors by this very talented young actor. His acting ability was crucial to this film, as his character should have (would have) been unbelieveable if not for his talents. & if there's an occassional flaw in the acting or the script, you can easily forgive him due to his likeability. The entire cast comes off as quite likeable, (except of course for the evil surfers) a group you wouldn't mind hanging out with. This is a movie that makes you happy you watched it. It's got some very good surfing footage, a little bit of everything (humor, action, conflict, romance, storyline, etc.) & just the right amount of exactly what it needs. I like this movie all the better because I'd never heard of it before I accidently stumbled upon it as a rental one day. Now I own it. I reccomend that you see it. Surf setting aside, it's just a great movie, you don't have to like surfing to enjoy this film. BTW: Some swearing, but not overmuch of that. Also a bit of dope smoking, but this isn't presented in a positive way, so it remains family friendly. Nothing offensive beyond that.

752982,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B000099T4E,James D. Leverton,"[36, 37]","&quot;Local Boys&quot; is a perfect example of what DVD does best:  providing a showcase for a minor-league delight that had no chance at a big-screen release but deserves more than to be dumped on cable TV for just a few lucky insomniacs to catch on the late show.  In short, it is a small gem of a film with a fine cast and promising director that tells a familiar, though moving and involving story.  It also showcases a pair of promising young actors who appear on the brink of stardom and gives a couple of solid pros (and former &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; costars) a chance to stretch their acting chops and exhibit their own undeniable chemistry.  And it may be the first surfing movie I have ever seen that actually deals with the teen surfing crowd in a realistic and non-exploitative manner by making its kids more than just brain-dead stoners obsessed with riding waves that would kill the world's best surfers.Eric Christian Olsen and Jeremy Sumpter star as Randy and Skeet, brothers whose policeman father &quot;died a hero&quot; (as Randy likes to say) in the line of duty.  Skeet wants to learn to surf, so Randy buys him a surfboard for his twelfth birthday. But like so many other well-meaning though self-centered older brothers, he buys one that is too big (that way he'll have a spare) and then leaves Skeet to learn on his own.  When legendary surfer Jim Wesley (Mark Harmon) sees Skeet's pitiful attempts at riding a wave, he befriends the boy, buys him a suitable board, and offers to teach him the proper way to surf.  Skeet and Jim become fast friends and Jim even begins a tentative relationship with the boys' mother (Stacey Edwards), much to Randy's displeasure.  (Randy loathes Jim, sees him as a threat to his status as &quot;man of the house&quot; and refuses to cut him any slack.)  But Jim has issues of his own to deal with, since his own wife and daughter were killed in a car crash a couple of years before.  And then there's Skeet's unresolved emotional problems surrounding the death of his father to deal with as well--&quot;Local Boys&quot; isn't exactly loaded with surprises since you can tell where everything is headed almost before the film starts. But it is done with taste and restraint and a refreshing lack of melodrama, except for a ridiculous suicide attempt late in the film by one of Randy's surfer buds (Guiseppe Andrews), whose father thinks is a lazy, pothead loser (which, incidentally, he is) and is forcing to join the Marines.As for the brothers' relationship, it is tender and sweetly rendered, yet combative and utterly believable, thanks to the terrific performances of Olsen and Sumpter.  Olsen, who bombed badly in the &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; sequel &quot;When Harry Met Lloyd,&quot; makes Randy likeable even when he's acting like a spoiled jerk, mainly because he never lets the audience lose sight of how much he loves his brother and mother.  He's convinced he's trying to protect them from being hurt by Jim, but in reality, he's protecting himself.  As for Sumpter, he is simply amazing as Skeet, creating a character who is not a mini-adult but a believable, emotionally fragile pre-teen who idolizes his older brother, yet occasionally finds him a major league pain in the you-know-where.  Couple this with his fine performance in Bill Paxton's &quot;Frailty,&quot; and the result is a young actor of exceptional promise.In addition, Harmon and Edwards, who co-starred as lovers on TV's &quot;Chicago Hope,&quot; also score solidly and once again make a believable couple.  Harmon, in fact, has developed into a reliable and solid character actor who manages to elevate every scene he's in, no matter how pedestrian.  And he's 100% believable as a surfing legend.  Unfortunately, Edwards, who was magnificent as the deaf &quot;victim&quot; in Neal LaBute's &quot;In the Company of Men,&quot; is given little to do as the mother, but what she is given she does extremely well.  And Andrews offers amusing support as the pothead friend.Give credit to director Ron Moler, who does a creditable job on both the character-driven scenes and the surfing sequences, which are refreshingly believable in that they concentrate on surfers riding real waves instead of the ridiculous tidal waves of &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; and other recent surfing films.  How refreshing that the director doesn't feel the need to thrill the audience with laughable computer-generated surfing sequences in which normal surfers become superhuman thrill-seekers.  Moler also successfully captures the &quot;look&quot; of the Southern California beach scene and it's surrounding neighborhoods.  As for the DVD itself, the presentation is crisp, the sound excellent and is presented in the original aspect ratio of 1:85:1.In all, this one's a winner.  Surfers can watch it without groaning, and non-surfers will find the story touching and the performances refreshingly good for a direct-to-video release.Congratulations to one and all.",4,What DVD

752985,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000099T4E,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 8]","This film could have benefited from judicious editing. I'll use one example rather than list all. Randy is on the beach at night, by a fire, kissing his very new girlfriend. His friend (I don't remember his friend's name) rushes up spurting sand all around exclaiming his need to talk to Randy right away - ""it's important"". He tells Randy that his mother found his ""stash"", told his Dad, and he would probably have to go into the Marines when his Dad came home. Then he gets up and leaves. ?? That scene made no sense. Why interrupt Randy's ""fun"" with a dire emergency that isn't dire, only to leave fifteen seconds later? It doesn't make sense. That's something I harp on: if something doesn't make sense, either excise it or find a more appropriate place for it where it will make sense. There was a scene further in the film where Randy and his friend were discussing this same topic. Given that, I say the firelight interruption should have been excised.Another problem was that nobody seemed to care about Jim Wesley (Mark Harmon's much older character) buddying up with 12-year old Skeet for the right reasons. We live in a rather unfortunate age where people cannot leave their children with people they don't know - we all know what I mean. Randy protested Skeet hanging out with Jim, but only for the wrong reasons.Even with judicious editing, however, I don't feel that this film would have risen to great heights.

Simple surfing moves but still nice to see.  Mark Harmon was handsome as ever and it was fun to see him in the water.  Olsen was awesome.  He looked more buff as a teen than he does now as an adult!  The script is OK, somewhat predictable and simple.

But this movie combines an easy to follow plot with exceptional Southern California surfing.  For the hard core surfers there won't be enough surf scenes.  But for movie viewers who want surf action, you'll be quite pleased.  A vast improvement over Big Wednesday IMO but not up to Blue Crush which I think has the greatest scenes from a nondocumentary.But this is a movie with quality actors that is story driven and reminded me of growing up near the ocean with my brother that is the real treat here.  Yes, they have more problems with tragic deaths in two families but they also have plenty of attractive people to fill the screen.  In particular, the love interest of Randy adds quite a bit to the scenery.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie even though the plot is predictable.

752993,A21RKJX4TBNWDF,B000099T4E,Sf Shook,"[0, 0]","Local Boys was a simple movie with a well written script. The actors (especially the young kids) were very good and presented their characters in a very realistic, natural manner (unlike other &#34;surfer-based&#34; movies where Keaneau Reeves runs around saying &#34;duuuuude&#34; all day). The subject matter is somewhat heavy but very important to the message of the film. Simply put, you have a mother and her 2 young sons (they being the main focus) who are dealing with the loss (death) of their father, and an older ex-surf pro who is dealing with the loss of his wife and daughter. Surfing brings them all together and thus the movie begins to unfold.I think this would make a good family movie as it teaches a few life lessons and shows, in a realistic way, how difficult relationships and allowing oneself to get close to other people can be.

This movie isn't profound, and that's why I enjoyed it. The plot is generic, the dramatic events by-the-numbers, but the details are perfect. In a movie like this, you either get the chracters right or the film sinks into melodramatic contrivances that carry the emotional weight of a gulp of diet cola. This movie has a motherlode of engaging characters who add clout to a basic script. Mark Harmon's tormented widower is remote and unwilling to commit, the desire to care struggling to break through his pall of uncertainty. The older sibling conveys anger over the men who enter his mother's life, leave a trail of [stuff], and then disappear like last night's hangover. His performance is an endearing mixture of love, control, and insecurity. Skeeter, as played by Jeremy Sumpter, does an excellent job portraying a boy who wrestles with damaging feelings, desperately hungering for a father figure. He's the type of kid everyone would want as a son, thoughtful, perky, and good-humored. Sumpter is a natural here, outplaying even the veterans. The circle of friends manage to become distinct entities, caring for each other but making mistakes that we can relate to. There are no vulgar jokes or cruelty to others that seem to dominate idiot teen movies, yet I found myself laughing at humor that arises from the chracter's personalities. The dramatic parts work because I liked the people in the movie. They make great company. The script is subtle and sneaks up on you emotionally. Even though issues of depression, abusive adults, and paternal death are addressed, I never felt manipulated. The dialogue is well-handled abd enlightened. And the surfing scenes are intense, showing tricks I didn't think possible. Overall I would recommend this movie based on its sincerity and the good example is sets for human beings who are unsure about how decent humans should act and communicate with one another.",4,It's in the details,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,2083,"['Surfing', 'metaphor', 'conflict', 'life', 'wrestling', 'nature', 'trying', 'control', 'one', 'destiny', 'ebb', 'flow', 'turbulence', 'Okay', 'heavy-handed', 'hogwash', 'movie', ""n't"", 'profound', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'plot', 'generic', 'dramatic', 'events', 'by-the-numbers', 'details', 'are', 'perfect', 'movie', 'either', 'get', 'chracters', 'right', 'film', 'sinks', 'melodramatic', 'contrivances', 'carry', 'emotional', 'weight', 'gulp', 'diet', 'cola', 'movie', 'motherlode', 'engaging', 'characters', 'who', 'add', 'clout', 'basic', 'script', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'tormented', 'widower', 'remote', 'unwilling', 'commit', 'desire', 'care', 'struggling', 'break', 'pall', 'uncertainty', 'older', 'sibling', 'conveys', 'anger', 'men', 'who', 'enter', 'mother', 'life', 'leave', 'trail', '[', 'stuff', ']', 'then', 'disappear', 'last', 'night', 'hangover', 'performance', 'endearing', 'mixture', 'love', 'control', 'insecurity', 'Skeeter', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'boy', 'who', 'damaging', 'feelings', 'desperately', 'hungering', 'father', 'figure', 'type', 'kid', 'everyone', 'would', 'want', 'son', 'thoughtful', 'perky', 'good-humored', 'Sumpter', 'natural', 'here', 'outplaying', 'even', 'veterans', 'circle', 'friends', 'manage', 'become', 'distinct', 'entities', 'caring', 'other', 'making', 'mistakes', 'can', 'relate', 'are', 'vulgar', 'jokes', 'cruelty', 'others', 'seem', 'dominate', 'idiot', 'teen', 'movies', 'yet', 'found', 'laughing', 'humor', 'chracter', 'personalities', 'dramatic', 'parts', 'work', 'liked', 'people', 'movie', 'make', 'great', 'company', 'script', 'subtle', 'up', 'emotionally', 'Even', 'issues', 'depression', 'abusive', 'adults', 'paternal', 'death', 'are', 'addressed', 'never', 'felt', 'manipulated', 'dialogue', 'well-handled', 'abd', 'enlightened', 'surfing', 'scenes', 'are', 'intense', 'showing', 'tricks', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'based', 'sincerity', 'good', 'example', 'sets', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'unsure', 'how', 'decent', 'humans', 'should', 'act', 'communicate', 'one']",Local Boys
