1344772,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,B003FSU6YO,Brian,"[2, 4]","I suppose in the budding subgenre of revenge/torture-porn, '7 Days' distinguishes itself as a superficially polished production that pointedly takes little glee in its subject matter (as echoed in a scene where the killer-cum-victim taunts his victim-cum-torturer for not enjoying his newfound depravity very much). But once the good doctor-- father of the central plot's raped-and-murdered girl-- snaps, the show is all but over: he knows how it's going to end, the cops know how it's going to end, and unfortunately for us the dead-end script makes no attempt to dissuade the viewer from this static sense of fatalism. And so, for the 70-some intervening minutes of the film, we can expect no emotional nuance, no psychological insight, no dramatic tension; we are left simply to watch the doctor mope about (for he has already unraveled), venting his unhappiness on everything from pressboard furniture to the mother of another murder victim (okay, that I didn't see coming, but its unpredictability is nullified by its contrived arbitrariness) to, of course, the pedophiliac-killer himself. The whole exercise is nothing short of mind-numbing. In fact, aside from its impressive cinematography, the only redeeming element in the movie is a sparse, solid performance by the lead detective on the case, grief-stricken from having recently lost his wife in a convenience-store robbery-gone-wrong, who acts convincingly as a human foil to the protagonist's feral persona. Too bad his appearances are few and far between.",2,"Hits one note, over and over... and over...",1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,1520,"['suppose', 'budding', 'subgenre', 'revenge/torture-porn', '7', 'Days', 'distinguishes', 'superficially', 'polished', 'production', 'pointedly', 'little', 'glee', 'subject', 'matter', 'echoed', 'scene', 'where', 'killer-cum-victim', 'taunts', 'victim-cum-torturer', 'not', 'enjoying', 'newfound', 'depravity', 'very', 'much', 'once', 'good', 'doctor', 'father', 'central', 'plot', 'raped-and-murdered', 'girl', 'snaps', 'show', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'cops', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'unfortunately', 'dead-end', 'script', 'attempt', 'dissuade', 'viewer', 'static', 'sense', 'fatalism', 'so', '70-some', 'intervening', 'minutes', 'film', 'can', 'expect', 'emotional', 'nuance', 'psychological', 'insight', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'are', 'left', 'simply', 'watch', 'doctor', 'mope', 'already', 'unraveled', 'venting', 'unhappiness', 'everything', 'pressboard', 'furniture', 'mother', 'murder', 'victim', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'unpredictability', 'nullified', 'contrived', 'arbitrariness', 'course', 'pedophiliac-killer', 'whole', 'exercise', 'nothing', 'short', 'mind-numbing', 'fact', 'aside', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'only', 'redeeming', 'element', 'movie', 'sparse', 'solid', 'performance', 'lead', 'detective', 'case', 'grief-stricken', 'having', 'recently', 'lost', 'wife', 'convenience-store', 'robbery-gone-wrong', 'who', 'convincingly', 'human', 'foil', 'protagonist', 'feral', 'persona', 'Too', 'bad', 'appearances', 'are', 'few', 'far']",N/A

This is NOT a horror film in the style of ""Last House on the Left."" It has absolutely nothing to do with that particular original or remake. And to even think about comparing this to SAW or HOSTEL is beyond insulting to the integrity and intelligence of this film. ""7 Days"" is a dark, disturbing and very sad glimpse into the depths of hell that one grieving man will sink in order to get even with the murderer / rapist of his child. Without any background score whatsoever, zero punches pulled and performances from the entire cast that border on 'perfect', ""7 Days"" manages to effortlessly and smoothly take you in from the opening frames. And when it's over, it's really not over. Most audiences will not be able to shake the impact of this film for days, if that soon.""7 Days"" is simply one of the most provocative and gut-wrenching films I have ever seen; terrifyingly detailed without sinking to traditional over-the-top horror with the purpose of trying to shock jaded audiences. At about the ninety minute point, I thought the film might be running out of ideas, but the filmmaker is far too good for that. For the final half-hour or so, ""7 Days"" shifts into startlingly unexpected territory, with one sequence near the end that produces more chills than any twenty Stephen King novels.As far as content, this is extremely violent and gruesome in a clinical sense, the language is raw at times and there is an abundance of nudity.

1344775,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003FSU6YO,Eric Sanberg,"[4, 8]","Some reviewers have commented that this isn't just a torture, revenge movie. They say it transcends into deeper areas of the situation concerning redemption and such, but if this is true, I didn't see it.A wealthy doctor's daughter is kidnapped, beaten, raped and killed partly due to the fact that dad was too tired to accompany her while she delivered her birthday invitations and mom wanted a quickie from dad before she headed off to work at the gallery. The culprit is apprehended in, what will be, a pretty open and shut case. Dad devises a way to kidnap said culprit prior to trial, deliver him to a remote cottage and get barbaric all over him.The doctor knows his stuff and can keep the degenerate alive while he does all manner of unseemly things to his person. But there isn't much more to it than that. The entire process is to take 7 days and, if this were really a sincere effort, there would be much more interaction between the two, and the doctor, who isn't really a bad guy, would come to realize that this whole thing is wrong. That arc doesn't happen. There is some exchange between the two but nothing of any real substance and nothing that changes the situation. There is also the whole issue of guilt on the heads of the parents. They both feel it and there is some discussion of it between them but, again, it's brief and barely breaks the surface of the issue. Much of the movie is the doctor doing his thing all over the perp. You DO see him degenerate, through near constant drinking, into a puddle of incoherent self pity and bouts of hallucination but, again, there is no arc, only a downward spiral. His final words underscore this fact.The acting, directing and all the other production values are top shelf. The problem lies in the script. After day four, I found myself becoming impatient and started looking at my watch. This is not a good thing. In the Saw movies, much of the focus is on the cleverness of the kill methods. There is little clever in this movie and, since it lacks any real depth, there is little reason to watch it.Unless you're a die hard fan of this sort of thing, I wouldn't bother.

At first it is a satisfying revenge film. Then the question arises is loosing his humanity by becoming as sadistic  worth the price to avenge the last pain and terror of his daughter.? This question was very compelling. More so because I was agreeing with him and the film never sold itself out by moralising The cashier supported him so he could do what he intended to do in the first place. And yet two chance finds by the father kept the heart element alive during the film so it never devolved into negative pointlessness; it kept its perspectiveIs revenge right? No . Does he regret it? No. These two questions are the crux of the film and pulls the viewer into its maelstrom.An unusual film. It fully explores the grey areas when most other films dealing with the same subject would say revenge is not Christian etc...or use it as an excuse for a gore film.

WARNING: this movie is VERY graphic and not for the easily offended or people with a weak stomach. ""7 Days"" deals with a very difficult subject matter and does not hold back.Claude Legault (Bruno) and R&eacute;my Girard (Herv&eacute;) did an incredible job with the acting.  Fanny Mallette (Sylvia) also did wonderfully, though I would have liked to have seen more of her throughout the movie.  I found myself wondering why the director did not feature more of the mother's struggle.  There is one scene in particular that showcases the raw talent Legault and Mallette have.  It was a tour de force of brilliant acting.However, the movie is not without its faults.  One of the more interesting decisions made by the director was to not include a musical soundtrack.  This worked I think in favor of the atmosphere but there could have been some fill in music at times. It also seemed like the director was trying to fill holes in the story a bit too hard.  There were a couple of things that didn't make much sense to do and the ending left a little to be desired.""7 Days"" may not be the cream of the crop of revenge flicks, but it does succeed where others fail.  It is such a harrowing subject matter and is shot in such a realistic way that you are forced to have an emotional response, whether you like it or not.

1344779,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B003FSU6YO,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[2, 2]","This is a very grim and pretty disturbing film. I agree with other members on that. Its not as disturbing and brutally bloody as many movies I have seen, like Hostel or Cannibal Holocaust for example. What it is though is a solidly crafted film that tells the story of what some people are capable of when they have had thier lives turned upside down by a horrific tragedy. In the case of this film a young child is raped and then bruatally murdered. The question this film posses is What if you had the chance to torture the man who killed your own kid? Would you do it? And if you did how far would you go? Would it make you feel any better you think? Or would it make you feel worse? Would you feel like a hero, or would it ruin your life? The film examins all of these puzzling questions. Some are answered and others are not. But the film is a dark journey into that world of uncertainty. I think this movie might be an important film to watch for some of those who have lost a child or family member to a sadistic killer and never got the revenge they so longed for. This movie could help exorcize some of those demons of anger and hatred. Its done so believably and realistically that it might help some people visualize the senario and maybe they might feel relieved they never had to chance to find out what they might be capable of. The movie illustrates how simply lost a person can become if they give way to their hatred and anger and get the revenge they so dreamed of. The film seems to say something like this could in reality drive you to madness and destroy you, and maybe vengence is not as sweet as it might seem. For others who have lost a loved one in such a horrible way the film could open up old wounds and maybe in the end its best if these individuals skip the film altogether. But yea, this movie was pretty disturbing, heartless and brutal.
