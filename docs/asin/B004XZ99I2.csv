We need more foreign and indie releases.""Heartbeats (Les Amours Imaginaires)"" (101 min.) is a 2010 Canadian movie centering around the friendship of Marie and Francis, who both take a love interest in Nicolas, a free-going kinda fella. Marie and Francis both compete for Nicolas' interest, threatening their own friendship. I don't want to say much more of the storyline, as I don't want to spoil the plot. While there were some nice moments, and the acting was fine, I have to admit that I really didn't get into the movie at all. I couldn't connect with the characters that much, for whatever reason. Maybe others will, and I hope you do.As a final aside, again I want to applaud IFC Films, and others like it such as the on-going foreign and indie releases by Film Movement for bringing these movies to us. No, I may not like every single movie (such as this one) but the overall track record of these releases is great (in my book anyway), and I am sick and tired of the mainstream Hollywood movies (Iron Man 3? no thanks).",3,"Not bad, but couldn't get into this",1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,1111,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'thank', 'IFC', 'Films', 'picking', 'up', 'movie', 'US', 'release', 'need', 'more', 'foreign', 'indie', 'releases', 'Heartbeats', 'Les', 'Amours', 'Imaginaires', '101', 'min', '2010', 'Canadian', 'movie', 'centering', 'friendship', 'Marie', 'Francis', 'who', 'take', 'love', 'interest', 'Nicolas', 'free-going', 'kinda', 'fella', 'Marie', 'Francis', 'compete', 'Nicolas', 'interest', 'threatening', 'own', 'friendship', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'storyline', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'plot', 'were', 'nice', 'moments', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'have', 'admit', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'connect', 'characters', 'much', 'reason', 'Maybe', 'others', 'will', 'hope', 'do.As', 'final', 'aside', 'again', 'want', 'applaud', 'IFC', 'Films', 'others', 'such', 'on-going', 'foreign', 'indie', 'releases', 'Film', 'Movement', 'bringing', 'movies', 'No', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'single', 'movie', 'such', 'one', 'overall', 'track', 'record', 'releases', 'great', 'book', 'anyway', 'am', 'sick', 'tired', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'thanks']",Heartbeats

Salcedo,"[1, 3]","Although the cinematography is something to salivate for, the overall plot was weak and offensively derivative of other ""threesome"" films made in the past. Can we also talk about the pretentious audience to whom this film is clearly trying to appease? Everything about ""Les Amous Imaginaires"" was superficial--the clothing, the scenery, the dialogue. There's not one significant exchange between the characters, and there isn't much substance in the relationships either. Let's face it, the only good thing that came out of this film is Louis Garrel's cameo at the end.Pro-tip: save your money for another indie film.

The cast was alright, although true, while nobody exactly sizzled, they did show glimmers of hotness here and there. The camera work was technically passable--except when it tried to get tricky or artsy. The script appeared the biggest obstacle to turning out a decent film. The intention apparently was something about mutability of affection and genders, but other than to observe that people occasionally find these aspects of life befuddling, if not downright painful, there was little enough this film had to say, and certainly nothing we hadn't already seen others address better. Louis Garrell has a micro-cameo at the closing (So who had to do him to convince him to drop by? That's the only interesting question here.) but regrettably, the reminder of Garrell's work served solely to magnify the mediocrity of everything that had come before. Still . . . one wishes the director well and that he perhaps try to think through his next project a tad more thoroughly before he rolls camera.

1432955,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B004XZ99I2,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[5, 6]","This is a film from French Canadian Xavier Dolan, he writes, directs and stars as Francis.  He is a young guy who has a friend Marie (Monia Chokri) and they both meet a newbie to the Montreal social scene in the shape of the Adonis like Nicolas (Niels Schneider). Francis is gay and Marie is gagging for it, so they both start acting like lovelorn puppies and show as much maturity as a bootleg whisky.The effect he has on them is barely suppressed as they all pretend to get on and care for each other whilst in actual fact Marie is in open hostilities with Francis to garner young Nikki's affections. He seems oblivious but also a tad over tactile, which of course only adds fuel to the fire burning in everyone else's loins.There are a lot of monologues to camera almost in an interview stylie, and the camera pans in and out like an amateur news man. This is obviously done for stylistic reasons, but some may find it acts more like an alienation device and tends to slow down the narrative.Everyone smokes, which is great, all the acting is well above average and it oozes style. With lots of references and homage's to Katherine Hepburn and angora jumpers for good measure. The musical score is rather good too and the whole film has a sensuality that I normally associate with Italian cinema. As things come to a head (forgive the pun) the bitchiness is ramped up to levels where even high school girls would find challenging.  You may also pick up some tips on the proper sensual way of eating a marshmallow too - if that is your thing.This is a sensual, languorous tale of infatuation, jealousy and redemption and I really liked it. There are not too many bedroom scenes in case you were wondering, so for that sort of gentleman's diversion, you would be better off looking else where. It is in French with very good sub titles, it is 105 minutes  long and could probably have been shorter but still it is very recommended and I think Mousier Dolan has shown he has a lot to offer.",4,M&eacute;nage a trois - Well sort of,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,1990,"['film', 'French', 'Canadian', 'Xavier', 'Dolan', 'directs', 'stars', 'Francis', 'young', 'guy', 'who', 'friend', 'Marie', 'Monia', 'Chokri', 'meet', 'newbie', 'Montreal', 'social', 'scene', 'shape', 'Adonis', 'Nicolas', 'Niels', 'Schneider', 'Francis', 'gay', 'Marie', 'gagging', 'start', 'acting', 'lovelorn', 'puppies', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'maturity', 'bootleg', 'whisky.The', 'effect', 'barely', 'suppressed', 'pretend', 'get', 'care', 'other', 'whilst', 'actual', 'fact', 'Marie', 'open', 'hostilities', 'Francis', 'garner', 'young', 'Nikki', 'affections', 'oblivious', 'also', 'tad', 'tactile', 'course', 'only', 'fuel', 'fire', 'burning', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'lot', 'monologues', 'camera', 'almost', 'interview', 'stylie', 'camera', 'amateur', 'news', 'man', 'obviously', 'done', 'stylistic', 'reasons', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'alienation', 'device', 'slow', 'down', 'narrative.Everyone', 'smokes', 'great', 'acting', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'style', 'lots', 'references', 'homage', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'angora', 'jumpers', 'good', 'measure', 'musical', 'score', 'rather', 'good', 'too', 'whole', 'film', 'sensuality', 'normally', 'associate', 'Italian', 'cinema', 'things', 'come', 'head', 'forgive', 'pun', 'bitchiness', 'ramped', 'up', 'levels', 'where', 'even', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'would', 'find', 'challenging', 'may', 'also', 'pick', 'up', 'tips', 'proper', 'sensual', 'way', 'eating', 'marshmallow', 'too', 'thing.This', 'sensual', 'languorous', 'tale', 'infatuation', 'jealousy', 'redemption', 'really', 'liked', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'case', 'were', 'wondering', 'so', 'sort', 'gentleman', 'diversion', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'looking', 'else', 'where', 'French', 'very', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', '105', 'minutes', 'long', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'shorter', 'still', 'very', 'recommended', 'think', 'Mousier', 'Dolan', 'shown', 'lot', 'offer']",Heartbeats

The three persons&#8217; initially sweet relationship takes a turn for the worse when the rivalry between Francis and Marie escalates without knowing.Acting is excellent.
