1348952,A1YSDK1ZEVMT7U,B003L20IEW,Aaron M.,"[0, 0]","The Last Exorcism is a mock documentary (ala The Blair Witch Project). It hits many of the same beats that Blair Witch does, the scenes where they stop to interview random citizens being especially reminiscent.This time it's a film crew investigating exorcisms along with a reformed minister/exorcist that is out to debunk the phenomenon. They follow the minister along as he goes through the motions of his usual procedure during a case, while he shows them the behind the scenes tricks of his trade. The family they are out to help being oblivious of the true nature of their documentary.This particular exorcism does not go as planned though. The girl who is the focus of the exorcism turns out to be truly disturbed and seemingly beyond the psychological shock tactics meant to jar her out of her delusions. This leads to an ambiguity as the minister and the film crew try to discover what trauma may be causing her mental problems while an underlying sense that this may just be the real deal lurks beneath the surface.For most of its running time the film is fairly good...until the last 8 minutes or so when events take such a ridiculous turn that whatever suspense or unease the film had generated dissipates in gales of laughter. I won't spoil it, but it's truly hysterical in a ""I can't believe what they are trying to pull here"" sort of way. It's basically a big joke, and almost a middle finger to the audience.The film seems a little too polished to be passed off as raw footage. It is supposed to feel like it's been through some post-production, as real documentaries are, complete with score. Somehow though it feels more like a film based on found footage, rather than found footage itself. However, the events of the film make such a discovery of source material highly implausible.One interesting thing about the film was how it portrayed religious fanaticism as a fringe element, while treating most of the religious community the filmmakers came into contact with as more or less practical, reasonable people. Sort of refreshing. They sort of ruin all that with the ending though.",2,Unfortunate.,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,2101,"['Last', 'Exorcism', 'mock', 'documentary', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'many', 'same', 'beats', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'scenes', 'where', 'stop', 'interview', 'random', 'citizens', 'being', 'especially', 'reminiscent.This', 'time', 'film', 'crew', 'investigating', 'exorcisms', 'reformed', 'minister/exorcist', 'out', 'debunk', 'phenomenon', 'follow', 'minister', 'along', 'motions', 'usual', 'procedure', 'case', 'scenes', 'tricks', 'trade', 'family', 'are', 'help', 'being', 'oblivious', 'true', 'nature', 'documentary.This', 'particular', 'exorcism', 'not', 'go', 'planned', 'girl', 'who', 'focus', 'exorcism', 'out', 'be', 'truly', 'disturbed', 'seemingly', 'psychological', 'shock', 'tactics', 'meant', 'jar', 'delusions', 'ambiguity', 'minister', 'film', 'crew', 'try', 'discover', 'what', 'trauma', 'may', 'be', 'causing', 'mental', 'problems', 'underlying', 'sense', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'real', 'deal', 'surface.For', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'fairly', 'good', 'last', '8', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'events', 'take', 'ridiculous', 'turn', 'suspense', 'unease', 'film', 'had', 'generated', 'dissipates', 'gales', 'laughter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'truly', 'hysterical', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'pull', 'here', 'sort', 'way', 'basically', 'big', 'joke', 'almost', 'middle', 'finger', 'audience.The', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'polished', 'be', 'passed', 'off', 'raw', 'footage', 'supposed', 'feel', 'been', 'post-production', 'real', 'documentaries', 'are', 'complete', 'score', 'Somehow', 'more', 'film', 'based', 'found', 'footage', 'rather', 'found', 'footage', 'However', 'events', 'film', 'make', 'discovery', 'source', 'material', 'highly', 'implausible.One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'portrayed', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'fringe', 'element', 'treating', 'most', 'religious', 'community', 'filmmakers', 'came', 'contact', 'more', 'less', 'practical', 'reasonable', 'people', 'Sort', 'refreshing', 'sort', 'ruin', 'ending']",N/A
1348953,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B003L20IEW,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[1, 3]","Mental illness is a scary thing to witness, be it medical or otherwise. In the dark ages, everything not normal was attributed to evil spiritual influences; namely, the devil. I see possession as a moot point, disbelieving most accounts I hear of, but what of those select few, where you just don't know?""The Last Exorcism"" is a work of fiction, one I originally didn't feel I would like. It has the all-too-common hand-held ""shaky-cam"" look to it, a film within a film, the trend of the past twelve years or so. And the ""Iris"" character, though portrayed competently by Iris Bahr, lingered in my memory as Larry's assistant from ""Larry The Cable Guy - Health Inspector."" I normally don't do this. I can compartmentalize people so they aren't typecast to me, but I backslid a little here. In this case she is in the role of someone assisting in the filming of a documentary about a religious sham which goes terribly wrong, but I kept remembering ""Health Inspector."" And that isn't fair to her. She did a good job.The Movie (contains some spoilers):""Reverend"" Cotton Marcus is a self-admitted charlatain, a scam artist. He's in it for the money, but he also realizes people are willing to do awful things in the name of faith. He thanks God (does he really? hmmm...) that his son is relatively healthy, born after a very risky pregnancy, while a boy the son's age was recently suffocated during an exorcism - the people involved tied a plastic bag around his head, asphyxiating him to death; is this REALLY ""God's Work?"" So, in the name of preventing such tragedies in the future, Rev Cotton is displaying, on film, all the little secrets he uses to fool people in his documentary; in this case, the family of a nice girl named ""Nell,"" a very pleasant girl, with the wrinkly-nosed smile and so forth, but she sleepwalks, and her somnambulism includes some extremely violent behavior. He says he'll do an exorcism, and one quickly happens. WRONG!!! This doesn't happen - there is supposed to be a thorough church investigation; this takes time, and the ritual probably won't be authorized. (Don't I sound like Karras from ""The Exorcist?) This guy dives right in, with all his smoke and mirrors, poor, gullible suckers, and a large wad of cash subsequently trades hands. Why again do less and less people trust their clergy? I'll take greed for $500, Alex. Reverend Marcus needs to pay for his son's new hearing aid, and God isn't going to foot the bill... it's sickening.But when it becomes apparent that Nell's condition is more serious than previously assumed, Cotton realizes he is in over his head. Not only is he dealing with what's probably a real demonic invasion, the situation is worsened by suspicions of sexual abuse, including incest. The girl wakes up while ""drowning"" a porcelain doll, and the limbless family tree is assumed. After another exorcism, the blame for the pregnancy is placed on a boy named ""Logan,"" but his Justin Bieber hair-do gives him away; Nell's a nice girl, but not his thing (puke).I have appeared to give a lot away, but not really. More twists and turns ensue, and the ending is kind of a surprise, though sudden.It's not a bad film at all, just not a classic; hopefully, they won't sequel it.P.S.As for the account of a real possession in the features, I don't believe it. Believe it if you want to, but I don't; it's only propaganda.",4,I was originally going to rate this as a 2 star...,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,3372,"['Mental', 'illness', 'scary', 'thing', 'witness', 'be', 'medical', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'everything', 'not', 'normal', 'was', 'attributed', 'evil', 'spiritual', 'influences', 'namely', 'devil', 'see', 'possession', 'moot', 'point', 'disbelieving', 'most', 'accounts', 'hear', 'what', 'select', 'few', 'where', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'work', 'fiction', 'one', 'originally', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'would', 'like', 'all-too-common', 'hand-held', 'shaky-cam', 'look', 'film', 'film', 'trend', 'past', 'twelve', 'years', 'so', 'Iris', 'character', 'portrayed', 'competently', 'Iris', 'Bahr', 'lingered', 'memory', 'Larry', 'assistant', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Health', 'Inspector', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'can', 'compartmentalize', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'typecast', 'backslid', 'little', 'here', 'case', 'role', 'someone', 'assisting', 'filming', 'documentary', 'religious', 'sham', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'kept', 'remembering', 'Health', 'Inspector', ""n't"", 'fair', 'did', 'good', 'job.The', 'Movie', 'spoilers', 'Reverend', 'Cotton', 'Marcus', 'self-admitted', 'charlatain', 'scam', 'artist', 'money', 'also', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'awful', 'things', 'name', 'faith', 'God', 'really', 'hmmm', 'son', 'relatively', 'healthy', 'born', 'very', 'risky', 'pregnancy', 'boy', 'son', 'age', 'was', 'recently', 'suffocated', 'exorcism', 'people', 'involved', 'tied', 'plastic', 'bag', 'head', 'asphyxiating', 'death', 'REALLY', 'God', 'Work', 'So', 'name', 'preventing', 'such', 'tragedies', 'future', 'Rev', 'Cotton', 'displaying', 'film', 'little', 'secrets', 'fool', 'people', 'documentary', 'case', 'family', 'nice', 'girl', 'named', 'Nell', 'very', 'pleasant', 'girl', 'wrinkly-nosed', 'smile', 'so', 'forth', 'somnambulism', 'extremely', 'violent', 'behavior', ""'ll"", 'do', 'exorcism', 'one', 'quickly', 'WRONG', ""n't"", 'happen', 'supposed', 'be', 'thorough', 'church', 'investigation', 'time', 'ritual', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'authorized', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'Karras', 'Exorcist', 'guy', 'right', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'poor', 'gullible', 'suckers', 'large', 'wad', 'cash', 'subsequently', 'hands', 'Why', 'again', 'do', 'less', 'less', 'people', 'trust', 'clergy', ""'ll"", 'take', 'greed', '500', 'Alex', 'Reverend', 'Marcus', 'pay', 'son', 'new', 'hearing', 'aid', 'God', ""n't"", 'going', 'foot', 'bill', 'sickening.But', 'when', 'apparent', 'Nell', 'condition', 'more', 'serious', 'previously', 'assumed', 'Cotton', 'head', 'Not', 'only', 'dealing', 'what', 'probably', 'real', 'demonic', 'invasion', 'situation', 'worsened', 'suspicions', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'including', 'incest', 'girl', 'up', 'drowning', 'porcelain', 'doll', 'limbless', 'family', 'tree', 'assumed', 'exorcism', 'blame', 'pregnancy', 'placed', 'boy', 'named', 'Logan', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'hair-do', 'away', 'Nell', 'nice', 'girl', 'not', 'thing', 'puke', 'have', 'appeared', 'give', 'lot', 'away', 'not', 'really', 'More', 'twists', 'turns', 'ensue', 'ending', 'kind', 'surprise', 'sudden.It', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'classic', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'it.P.S.As', 'account', 'real', 'possession', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Believe', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'propaganda']",N/A

For the Blu Ray version, its an outstanding product, ultra crisp, high quality video, and every bit as impressive as you'd expect from a Blu Ray disc.  If you are inclined to buy this movie, I'd highly encourage you to buy the Blu Ray, its worth the upgrade.As for the film itself, the reviews more than sufficiently identify this film's shortcoming.  And that shortcoming, i.e., the ending, is vast.  However, I'm a firm believer that a movie can be fully enjoyed for the quality of a few scenes, independent of the entirety of a film.  This movie falls into that category.  IMHO, there are a few possession scenes that are so well done and creepy, this movie can be enjoyed for those scenes alone.

1348957,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B003L20IEW,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[17, 24]","Thar be spoilers hereBased on its average 5/10 rating on IMDB, I expected a lame movie.  What I got was a lame movie, with an extra heap of bad, and a twist ending so off-the-wall and incoherent, it's comical.The movie plays itself like a documentary, featuring Cotton Marcus, a charismatic young reverend and family man who is perfectly performed with great subtlty and realism by Patrick Fabian.  The level of sleaze you get from the way he preaches and what he says to the documentary crew is perfectly balanced by innocence and/or well-meaning.  It's not exactly disrespectful or offensive that, daring the interviewer he could preach his mother's banana bread recipe and people wouldn't notice, in mid-preaching he ends up doing it, and receives the same exultations he received preaching scripture.Another thing which struck me was how he claims he does not believe in demons or exorcisms, yet still does (and charges) for exorcisms anyway, not because he's a conman or a crook, but because he believes he is helping the person with their psychological delusion of posession, and of course is doing a job and needs to be paid; he has a family.So for the documentary crew, he responds to a call for an exorcism to show them on camera.  The amount of time the film actually takes just for the introduction and the prelude is rather long, and would be a waste of time if Fabian weren't so deeply involved in his role.  When they come to the area, they stop a young man to ask where the farm is.  He says they're going the wrong way, they need to make a U-turn, go past where they saw everything already, and go back where they came, which was a pretty elaborate way of telling them to go EFF themselves or to please leave.  Then he throws mud clods or rocks at their car when they go to the farm anyway.Awkwardness abounds as it turns out the man is the son of Louis Sweetzer, the guy who called about the posession.  We then go about introductions to the various people, Caleb being the son, Nell being the daughter who was posessed, supposedly, and brief insight into the family history.  Then we get an interesting few scenes as Cotton Marcus unfolds that bit of conman out, showing how he sets everything up like a magician or a carnie, dropping something into a bowl of water Nell's feet are in so the water bubbles, a sign that something is wrong with her, to making sure her bed is slightly wobbly, tying fishing wire around it, hiding small speakers to play various types of sounds, screams, 'demonic' voices, etcetera, with some of it interspersed with the actual exorcism itself.  While Caleb has him figured out, he wants to watch anyway because it's funny.The exorcism comes off rather comedic without any background music or atmosphere, and with Cotton Marcus hamming it up to a boisterous degree, concluding with him supposedly pulling the demon out, and clutching a crucifix, which a cutaway shows us is modified with an engine of some sort inside to blow smoke out, as though it were burning him.Of course by the end of it, he goes to the hotel, the father is grateful, and the story isn't over at all, as you know, and Nell ends up coming to their hotel in the middle of the night, some five miles away from the house, kissing and grinding against the woman leading the documentary, and suddenly throwing up, and they take her to the hospital.To their credit, the film makes it seem as though she's lying about this in order to hide a secret pregnancy or something of the sort, which the documentary woman initially suspects might be the result of her father raping her.More and more horror-type stuff happens, such as Nell walking around at night, acting scary and quiet, to the cameraman shutting off the camera, only for the camera to come back on, obviously stolen by Nell as it films her feet, then films her wandering about crazily, and then using the camera to beat a cat to death, which SHOCK! she drew a picture of a cat with bloodspots and holes in it the day earlier!  She also drew a picture of a man standing before a big fire with a crucifix, and of the cameraguy stabbed dead and the documentary woman beheaded.Because the local pastor Joseph Manley had a falling out with Louis, they can't convince him to take the girl to a psychiatrist or a mental help specialist.  She starts acting crazy again, including slicing Caleb's face with a knife, and after enough craziness and with Louis threatening them with a gun, Cotton Marcus agrees to do another exorcism.  This time, Nell does crazier things, like arching her back sharply, screaming and claiming she's a demon, rather realistic without special effects loony-ness, but also rather convincing.However, he figures out she's faking it (somehow) because she taunts him by asking if he wanted her to give him a ""blowing job"" which he figures a 16-year old girl homeschooled for several years wouldn't know what it's properly called.  He calls out her, and she breaks down and confesses that she had sex with a boy named Logan who worked at a cafe.  Her speaking in the third person seems maybe to imply that she's ""pretending"" to still be a demon or something.  Pastor Manley and his assistant Becky Davis then come to provide religious comforting and counseling for them while Marcus and the others leave.At this point, the movie is almost completely over, and thus far seems to not really have a coherent plot.  What is shown is that Nell was apparently lying and pretending to be posessed in order to hide a pregnancy, but this isn't ever really made clear, and is further muddled by Nell apparently still ""pretending"" to be posessed even while describing the events leading to her having sex and getting pregnant.Then, Cotton Marcus decides to stop by the cafe and find Logan.  Logan claims he never had sex with Nell and barely knew her, that they just met at a party or gathering thrown by Pastor Manley, and implies he isn't interested in Nell, while the camera focuses on his vaguely feminine mannerisms.  In the car, they just outright claim he's gay, and head back to the farm to find out what's happening.SPOILERWhen they get there, the house is empty, with satanic imagery painted all over the walls, and they head out into the woods, hearing chanting, and they find... Nell laying on a table in an open field, with a bonfire burning, and Pastor Manley dressed in red robes chanting stuff with people around him, and Louis tied up and blindfolded nearby.This is apparently the twist ending; the Pastor is a satanist, and they're having some satanic ceremony in which they pull the baby out of Nell, and it's ""not human"" because it's small and making weird squealy noises.  They then throw it into the bonfire for some reason.  Then, REMEMBER THE PICTURES!  The ones Nell drew.  Cotton Marcus runs up to the bonfire as it grows comically larger, holding up a crucifix, and someone attacks the documentary woman and decapitates her with a shovel, leaving the cameraman to run off on his own when suddenly OH NOESZ he runs into Caleb, with a bandage over his sliced face!  And Caleb kills the cameraguy.  And then it just ends.SPOILER ENDA movie with a twist ending usually (if it's a decent movie) has that twist ending occur as it a driving force behind the movie's plot, with blatant hints left for people to pick up, and completely misinterpret (like The Sixth Sense).  Some twist endings seemingly come out of nowhere, but have a firm basis in the plot, some bit of foreshadowing, and ultimately make sense when you think about it in retrospect (like Saw, Saw IV, Fight Club).What this movie's twist ending instead displays is a complete and utter arse-pull; it comes out of nowhere, with no foreshadowing, no buildup, no hints or clues, nothing whatsoever.  And the level of surrealism to it makes it absurd, to the point where where I should have been shocked or terrified, I was completely withdrawn from the immersion of the film, asking ""What the hell is this?""",1,What was this?,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,7966,"['Thar', 'be', 'spoilers', 'hereBased', 'average', '5/10', 'rating', 'IMDB', 'expected', 'lame', 'movie', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'lame',

When they're done well, they can be remarkably involving and tense. THE LAST EXORCISM tries to throw viewers headfirst into the world of exorcism, and does all it can to make you constantly question whether or not the main characters have found the real deal, or just another hoaxer.The setup is actually very interesting. We meet Reverend Cotton Marcus, a man who has become disillusioned with his faith to the point of likening it to ""going on autopilot."" It's interesting because the actor (Patrick Fabian) does an extraordinary job of letting you see his conflict, and it's hard not to sympathize with him. At some point, he picked up a film crew of two, and the three of them set off to capture an exorcism on film. Though Cotton is actually fully expecting to catch gullibility on tape, rather than anything demon-related.They drive through back roads aplenty to find their destination, where they meet Louis Sweetzer, a man claiming that his daughter, Nell, has been possessed by the devil. Cotton goes to work ""exorcising"" the girl, but quickly finds out that he may have bitten off more than he can chew.There are several twists and turns, but at this point: I thought the movie was pretty engaging in how it handled the story. All of the actors give top notch performances, the location is set up nicely, and there are a lot of backstories that get tossed around to give everyone (save the camera crew) a surprising amount of depth. I was amazed how much I was liking the movie, and equally amazed by how much I hated it when the ending came around.I could not imagine a worse conclusion to such a good film. It was almost heartbreaking how terrible it was. All of the build-up, character depth, and subplots are tossed out the window in favor of some cliche' and ridiculous...thing. I just couldn't believe it.So, I must disappointingly file THE LAST EXORCISM away under ""Rent It.""

It looked truly scary, and I fell for it hook, line, and sinker.  The writer and director of this film made little, if any, effort to research the subject of their film and it shows glaringly throughout.  The self-styled preacher is laughable, the characters are poorly written and act and react in ways that inexplicably go against common sense, and the moronic story fails to deliver on practically every level.  It takes a lot to make me consider walking out of the theater after paying too much at the box office, but two-thirds of the way through this turd burger I wanted to leave so bad that I could barely sit still.And then there's the ending.  I can't spoil it for you, but it can be best described as a laughable WTF cliche' that the writer simply pulled out of his @$$ as a way to end this train-wreck to nowhere and score a ""twist"" ending.  People in the audience where I saw this movie laughed out loud or audibly groaned an incredulous, ""Oh come ON!""

Scripters Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland and director Daniel Stamm create a very engaging and solid old-school horror film that utilizes all the mockumentary background of all three men very effectively in the first two acts. The performances of the two leads are solid in Patrick Fabian as faithless minister Cotton Marcus and Ashley Bell as the possibly-possessed Nell Sweetzer. The tension builds nicely for about an hour, effective without resorting to cheap jump scares or gratuitous blood and gore. Unfortunately, the final act is goes completely off the rails and the sublime becomes silly and overblown in the extreme to the point that it seems as if a much inferior film's ending got tacked on to pad the running time. In many cases this would not completely ruin the experience, but unfortunately for The Last Exorcism this amounts to a full one-third of the film.

1348969,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B003L20IEW,Carl Manes,"[2, 4]","Cotton is excellent at what he does, and what he does is perform. Exorcisms, mostly. Ironically, Cotton is also an atheist, but there is a lot of money to be made in 'faith' healing. He finally quits the practice after a news story surfaces about a young boy who was suffocated to death during a failed attempt at ridding him of his demons. Now, Cotton has hired a film crew to follow him and document one final case of exorcism, where he hopes to disprove its very existence by exposing himself as a fraud in order to prevent others from suffering a similar fate. What he doesn't know is that the devil has other plans for him...THE LAST EXORCISM is a clever and ambitious attempt on the subject of demonic possession that is sure to leave audiences divided. It takes the same Mockumentary approach as Scott Glosserman's brilliantly scripted BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON, presenting itself as fact but with more than a hint of sardonic humor. Unlike so many other low-budget features that use the 'found-footage' approach as a cover-up for poor filmmaking, the stylistic choice here is, in every way, essential to the plot. Patrick Fabian comes off as being a bit eccentric at first, but as the film progresses, Cotton drops his preacher 'persona' and allows Fabian to become increasingly believable. The young victim, Nell, is played by Ashley Bell, who is deathly terrifying in the role. Her subtle smiles and cold, dark stares are equally chilling, but what may be most disturbing about her possession is that each of her contorted movements and frenzied attacks are strictly grounded within Bell's physical range. There is no projectile vomit, levitation, or head spinning here, just wild-eyed insanity and bestial rage.Plenty of ambiguity can be found all throughout the film. Cotton is at least upfront about his deception, but from the second he steps onto the Sweetzer farm, it seems like he is the one being lured into an elaborate hoax. Even the controversial ending must be taken with extreme prejudice, since it is opens itself up to countless interpretations. On top of the obvious battle between good and evil, THE LAST EXORCISM touches on several other powerful themes, including the restoration of faith and the fearsome effects of religious fanaticism. Two points of contention do act against the film, hoever. The filmmakers cheat by enhancing the audio and injecting frightening sound effects over several of the scenes, which directly counts against the authenticity of the footage. Also, Nell's violent and bloody outbursts are never again examined after Cotton and his team make their shocking discovery before the closing scenes.Like THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE (and quite unlike the recent EXORCIST prequels), THE LAST EXORCISM presents something that is truly unique and original to the genre, making it a welcome addition to the long line of exorcism films from the past several decades.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,The Last Exorcism,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2958,"['Cotton', 'excellent', 'what', 'what', 'perform', 'Exorcisms', 'mostly', 'Ironically', 'Cotton', 'also', 'atheist', 'lot', 'money', 'be', 'made', ""'faith"", 'healing', 'finally', 'practice', 'news', 'story', 'surfaces', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'suffocated', 'death', 'failed', 'attempt', 'ridding', 'demons', 'Now', 'Cotton', 'hired', 'film', 'crew', 'follow', 'document', 'one', 'final', 'case', 'exorcism', 'where', 'disprove', 'very', 'existence', 'exposing', 'fraud', 'order', 'prevent', 'others', 'suffering', 'similar', 'fate', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'devil', 'other', 'plans', 'LAST', 'EXORCISM', 'clever', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'subject', 'demonic', 'possession', 'sure', 'leave', 'audiences', 'divided', 'same', 'Mockumentary', 'approach', 'Scott', 'Glosserman', 'brilliantly', 'scripted', 'THE', 'MASK', 'RISE', 'OF', 'LESLIE', 'VERNON', 'presenting', 'fact', 'more', 'hint', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'low-budget', 'features', 'use', ""'found-footage"", 'approach', 'cover-up', 'poor', 'filmmaking', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'here', 'way', 'essential', 'plot', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'off', 'being', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'first', 'film', 'Cotton', 'preacher', 'Fabian', 'become', 'increasingly', 'believable', 'young', 'victim', 'Nell', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'who', 'deathly', 'terrifying', 'role', 'subtle', 'smiles', 'cold', 'dark', 'stares', 'are', 'equally', 'chilling', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'disturbing', 'possession', 'contorted', 'movements', 'frenzied', 'attacks', 'are', 'strictly', 'grounded', 'Bell', 'physical', 'range', 'projectile', 'vomit', 'levitation', 'head', 'spinning', 'here', 'just', 'wild-eyed', 'insanity', 'bestial', 'rage.Plenty', 'ambiguity', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'Cotton', 'least', 'upfront', 'deception', 'second', 'Sweetzer', 'farm', 'one', 'being', 'lured', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'Even', 'controversial', 'ending', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'up', 'countless', 'interpretations', 'top', 'obvious', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'LAST', 'EXORCISM', 'touches', 'several', 'other', 'powerful', 'themes', 'including', 'restoration', 'faith', 'fearsome', 'effects', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'Two', 'points', 'contention', 'do', 'act', 'film', 'hoever', 'filmmakers', 'cheat', 'enhancing', 'audio', 'injecting', 'frightening', 'sound', 'effects', 'several', 'scenes', 'directly', 'authenticity', 'footage', 'Also', 'Nell', 'violent', 'bloody', 'outbursts', 'are', 'never', 'again', 'examined', 'Cotton', 'team', 'make', 'shocking', 'discovery', 'closing', 'EXORCISM', 'OF', 'EMILY', 'ROSE', 'quite', 'recent', 'EXORCIST', 'prequels', 'LAST', 'EXORCISM', 'something', 'truly', 'unique', 'original', 'genre', 'making', 'welcome', 'addition', 'long', 'line', 'exorcism', 'films', 'past', 'several', 'decades.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[3, 6]","""If you believe in God, then you must believe in the Devil.""The Last Exorcism is a well-acted and directed mockumentary that might stray too far from the disturbing subject matter one might expect.  I mean c'mon, this is a story about demonic possesion!  But instead of getting viciously subdued in a devilish chokehold it allows the viewer to smile and slurp vigorously on their sodas while easily sustaining all urinary fluids.  Dang it, I had my heart set on peeing my pants.But that's not to say the story isn't compelling.  Reverend Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian) is an evangelical minister who doesn't exactly practice what he preaches.  He has made a nice profit performing bogus exorcisms on people thought to be possessed.  Now Cotton has decided to expose his own fraudulent schemes by making a documentary of these little scams.  In a roundabout way he'll actually be doing God's good work by revealing the truth.Demons probably don't appreciate being made into a mockery.  Sleight-of-hand and other little tricks don't put an end to the hellacious problems a farmer is experiencing with his daughter.  Faith, or lack their of, is challenged in a real, sinister fashion.Don't be expecting too much in the way of bone-fracturing, spider-crawling, supernatural psychedelic insanity covered in gallons of vomiting spewage.

The movie predicts the ending for you anyways.  Now the basic background is that an ""exorcist"" (if we can call him that, he's also the reverend as well) gets a letter from a farmer worried about his daughter who is believed to be possessed by the most powerful demon (according to a book the reverend brought with him that describes a number of powerful demons, Abalam being the most powerful and the one that ""coils"" around young girls/women and impregnates them).  After the reverend performs a so called exorcism, he finds the farmer's daughter in his motel/hotel room where she is taken to a hospital.

1348976,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003L20IEW,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","""If you believe in God,"" says Reverend Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian), ""then you must believe in the Devil."" This eternal clash between good and evil is the backbone of Christian faith, and Marcus understands that. Growing up in Baton Rouge as the son of a preacher, he was groomed to become one himself at a very early age; looking back on his life, he admits to the camera that, while he learned plenty about behaving like a preacher, he never really learned about what he was preaching. He plays the part of the pious evangelical beautifully - boisterous, flashy, always with the loud, slick talk about Jesus and God the Father Almighty and crying, ""Amen!"" But what does he really believe? He isn't sure when the film starts, but when the film ends ... let's just say that, at that point, a crisis of faith is the least of his problems.Of one thing, he has become certain: Demons don't exist. Having performed many exorcisms, he candidly explains that, although he has never been a doctor, he has served as a healer for those who believed they needed healing. All he had to do was put on a performance and maybe sneak in a few special effects. But then came news of a supposedly possessed autistic boy that was suffocated to death during an exorcism; for Marcus, a line had been crossed. What if that had been his own son, who survived after being born prematurely? How could he continue pretending to cast out demons knowing that medicine and not Jesus Christ saved his son? His new mission in life has been to expose the phoniness of exorcisms as well as to rescue victimized children. Hence this documentary.The first ten minutes of ""The Last Exorcism"" develop the Cotton Marcus character so well, he effectively draws the audience into a plot that, when viewed from a distance, is relentlessly absurd. This is the newest in a long line of faux documentaries compiled from ""recovered footage,"" which is to say that it's by no means a groundbreaking horror film. Nevertheless, it's thoroughly entertaining, and at times, it's quite frightening. I only take issue with the film's final five minutes, a scene so visually and structurally unoriginal that it surpasses routine and becomes an anticlimax. If there's anything we've learned from the good horror movies, it's that certain things are better left to the imagination - to explain everything is to ruin the suspense. Had I been one of the producers, I would have fought tooth and nail for a reshoot of the ending.But I'm getting way ahead of the story. Marcus, who's constantly sent exorcism requests, responds to a letter from a man claiming that his teenage daughter is possessed. He travels to a remote farmhouse with his producer and cameraman, where they meet the Sweetzer family. The teenage son, Caleb (Caleb Landry Jones), always seems to know more than he lets on, and is often highly intimidating. The father, Louis (Louis Herthum), is devoutly religious, deeply troubled since the death of his wife, and alarmingly overprotective of his daughter, Nell (Ashley Bell), who he believes is afflicted with a demon. How else to explain his slaughtered livestock and the blood that always appears on Nell's clothing in the morning? How else to explain the nights of endless screaming?Marcus has seen and heard all this before. The sleepless nights, the dead animals, the blood - it's a textbook case as far as he's concerned. After meeting the nervous but nonetheless good natured Nell, he reveals to the camera his tricks for creating a convincing exorcism, including rigging a bedroom with fishing wire, hiding speakers in strategic places, and playing spooky sound effects at the push of a button. He then puts on a show, Nell and her father none the wiser. Marcus tells them that the demon has been exorcised. Father and daughter are relieved. Marcus and his crew leave, believing it to be another open and shut case. Things start going wrong, however, when Nell suddenly appears the crew's motel room, her eyes glazed over, her actions highly provocative. How did she get there? The motel is miles away from her home. Upon taking her to the hospital, Marcus stresses that what she really needs is a psychological examination, not more religious rhetoric.And from here, the film gets increasingly more conventional. Conventional and nauseating, the ever reliable Queasy Cam put to full use. Marcus and his team return to the farmhouse. Nell has periods of erratic, violent behavior, only to emerge from them unaware of what she had done. Disturbing drawings prove to have been prophetic, such as that of a white cat coated in blood and with X's for eyes. Suspicions are aroused. Marcus finds it harder to play the part of an evangelical minister, for his real goal is to get Nell out of the house and into a psychiatric ward. Although shaken by the night's unsettling events, he remains unconvinced Nell is genuinely possessed. I dare not reveal whether or not this is the case. ""The Last Exorcism"" would have been a much better film if it had done the same thing. Given the wonderful development of the Marcus character, given how frighteningly enjoyable most of the film is, it's unfortunate that director Daniel Stamm opted for an ending that unsuccessfully goes for the obvious.",4,Possession is a Lot Scarier without an Explanation,1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,5250,"['believe', 'God', 'Reverend', 'Cotton', 'Marcus', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'then', 'must',

It was written by Huck Botko & Andrew Garland and directed by Daniel Stamm. The Last Exorcism stars Patrick Fabian, Ashley Bell and Louise Herthram.Cotton Marcus, played by Fabian, was raised in the church by a 'fire and brimstone' preacher. At a very early age, Cotton began to follow in his father's footsteps and preach the gospel. At the tender age of ten, Cotton performed his first exorcism. Years later with a wife and son, Cotton has spent his life developing elaborate hoaxes and effects to keep the money rolling in for him and his family. Having lost his faith many years ago, Cotton has decided to end his career as a phony by bringing in a documentary crew and sharing all the insider tricks to performing exorcisms so that people believe, and then shell out the cash. When he and his camera crew show up at the home of Louis Sweetzer, a man who says he is suffering from cattle loss and unexplainable deaths of his farm animals; what they find is much more than any of them have bargained for.The Last Exorcism is filmed in a documentary style much like The Blair Witch Project and will appeal to fans of this brand of movie. I laughed hysterically throughout the entire first half of the movie as Cotton Marcus takes the film crew through the tricks of the trade.The characters in The Last Exorcism were wonderfully placed together and draw the viewer in with the realness and intensity of their lives. Patrick Fabian was fantastic as the money hungry, unbelieving but sympathetic preacher, Cotton Marcus. Ashley Bell's performance as the possessed Nell Sweetzer is shocking when you consider that no special effects were used for her part...NONE!The movie did begin to slip about halfway through and was not at all what I would consider a 'scary' movie.

1348979,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B003L20IEW,Craig Whittle,"[2, 11]","THE LAST EXORCISMSTARRING: Patrick Fabian, Ashley Bell, Iris Bahr, Louis Herthum and Caleb Landry JonesWRITTEN BY: Huck Botko and Andrew GurlandDIRECTED BY: Daniel StammRated: PG - 13Genre: HorrorRelease Date: 27 August 2010Review Date: 22 October 2010I find it hilarious that the two worst movies of the year have `last' in their title. Hopefully it's not a coincidence so much as a premonition; God willing The Last Airbender and The Last Exorcism will be the LAST installments in their pitiful franchises.This movie was beyond terrible. The only redeeming quality it has is the performances of the two lead actors. Patrick Fabian plays a priest, and Ashley Bell is a girl who is supposedly possessed. No, wait a second - that's not entirely accurate because the guy isn't really a priest. He's pretending to be a priest; this is how he makes his living. He's actually a lot closer to a comedian. See how ridiculous this is?Everyone in the film that falls for his phony parlor tricks he labels `exorcism' is a complete moron. I won't discuss these situations in detail; it will be more fun for you to witness them on your own - if after reading this you still have the time and energy to waste on this movie.I don't understand what the film was trying to accomplish. Did it want to be scary or humorous or both? It was funny and comes close to being scary, but not at all in the entertaining mix that movies such as Army of Darkness and Idle Hands have done in the past. We were laughing AT this movie; not with it.Ashley Bell is a terrific actress and has a very unique quality to her: She is both beautiful and eerie simultaneously - almost like Sissy Spacek in Carrie. There's something to Bell's eyes; I can't explain it. Up until the point where we begin to realize that this film isn't going anywhere and is certainly not going to get better, we are cringing in our seats, waiting to see her deliver an amazing possessed performance.It never comes. She does some really cool acrobatic work, of which I'm baffled she was able to pull off. And she smashes a cat to pieces with a video camera. But soon enough, we begin to wonder if she too is `pretending' to be possessed.How this film made it to theaters to begin with, let alone gained the attention of Eli Roth, so much in fact that he felt a need to produce it, and put his name on it as an `Eli Roth Presents', is beyond my comprehension. The ending was bizarre and creepy and had it been in a different film, I may have enjoyed it. Then again... maybe not.",1,The Last Exorcism Review,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,2518,"['LAST', 'EXORCISMSTARRING', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'Iris', 'Bahr', 'Louis', 'Herthum', 'Caleb', 'Landry', 'JonesWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Huck', 'Botko', 'Andrew', 'GurlandDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Daniel', 'StammRated', 'PG', '13Genre', 'HorrorRelease', 'Date', '27', 'August', '2010Review', 'Date', '22', 'October', '2010I', 'hilarious', 'two', 'worst', 'movies', 'year', 'have', 'last', 'title', 'Hopefully', 'not', 'coincidence', 'so', 'much', 'premonition', 'God', 'willing', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'will', 'be', 'LAST', 'installments', 'pitiful', 'franchises.This', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'priest', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'girl', 'who', 'supposedly', 'possessed', 'No', 'wait', 'second', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'guy', ""n't"", 'really', 'priest', 'pretending', 'be', 'priest', 'how', 'living', 'actually', 'lot', 'closer', 'comedian', 'See', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'Everyone', 'film', 'phony', 'parlor', 'tricks', 'exorcism', 'complete', 'moron', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'situations', 'detail', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'witness', 'own', 'reading', 'still', 'have', 'time', 'energy', 'waste', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'Did', 'want', 'be', 'scary', 'humorous', 'was', 'funny', 'close', 'being', 'scary', 'not', 'entertaining', 'mix', 'movies', 'such', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'Idle', 'Hands', 'have', 'done', 'past', 'were', 'laughing', 'AT', 'movie', 'not', 'it.Ashley', 'Bell', 'terrific', 'actress', 'very', 'unique', 'quality', 'beautiful', 'simultaneously', 'almost', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Carrie', 'something', 'Bell', 'eyes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'point', 'where', 'begin', 'realize', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'are', 'cringing', 'seats', 'waiting', 'see', 'deliver', 'amazing', 'possessed', 'performance.It', 'never', 'really', 'cool', 'acrobatic', 'work', ""'m"", 'baffled', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'cat', 'pieces', 'video', 'camera', 'soon', 'enough', 'begin', 'wonder', 'too', 'pretending', 'be', 'possessed.How', 'film', 'made', 'theaters', 'begin', 'let', 'alone', 'gained', 'attention', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'felt', 'need', 'produce', 'put', 'name', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Presents', 'comprehension', 'ending', 'was', 'bizarre', 'creepy', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not']",N/A

When people gripe about the end of The Last Exorcism, I wonder if it's because they don't know that it is, in part,  an homage to the old satanic cult movies of the '70s.  The ending may seem like it comes out of left field, but, in my opinion, it makes the movie.  What would you rather have seen?  Would you rather have seen Cotton debunk the entire possession and ride away into the sunset?  That completely negates what every scene in the script is deliberately building to.  And if that would have happened, IT WOULD NOT BE A HORROR FILM.  And why do people keep comparing this film to The Exorcist?  Do you compare every vampire movie you see to Dracula (30s version)?  It seems ludicrous to me.  The movie stands alone as a movie about exorcism, faith (I absolutely love the idea that Cotton has lost his faith almost voluntarily and regains it almost by accident), and the supernatural.  I admit the whole fake documentary thing is getting old fast, but I thought it worked for this film.  I've definitely seen a lot of movies that take this approach that were A LOT worse (Invasion, Paranormal Entity, etc.)  I actually got chills when I saw Cotton charging towards the demon-fire (?) force of evil whatever-it-was at the end of the movie.  It was as if his faith had been furiously rekindled in an instant and it said a lot about his character. Being a person of absolutely no faith, I found the moment inspiring.  Anyway, I thought it was a good character study with a fun ending and good performances.  Naysayers can pick it apart if they like, I'll kick back and enjoy myself anyway.",4,A Lot of Unjustified Hate for this Flick,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,1741,"['**', 'review', 'spoiler', 'know', 'anything', 'horror', 'movies', 'especially', 'horror', 'movies', 'yesteryear', 'should', 'like', 'movie', 'When', 'people', 'gripe', 'end', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'wonder', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'part', 'homage', 'old', 'satanic', 'cult', 'movies', ""'70s"", 'ending', 'may', 'seem', 'left', 'field', 'opinion', 'movie', 'What', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'Would', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'Cotton', 'entire', 'possession', 'ride', 'away', 'sunset', 'completely', 'what', 'scene', 'script', 'deliberately', 'building', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'IT', 'WOULD', 'NOT', 'BE', 'A', 'HORROR', 'FILM', 'why', 'do', 'people', 'keep', 'comparing', 'film', 'Exorcist', 'Do', 'compare', 'vampire', 'movie', 'see', 'Dracula', '30s', 'version', 'ludicrous', 'movie', 'alone', 'movie', 'exorcism', 'faith', 'absolutely', 'love', 'idea', 'Cotton', 'lost', 'faith', 'almost', 'voluntarily', 'almost', 'accident', 'supernatural', 'admit', 'whole', 'fake', 'documentary', 'thing', 'getting', 'old', 'fast', 'thought', 'worked', 'film', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'take', 'approach', 'were', 'LOT', 'worse', 'Invasion', 'Paranormal', 'Entity', 'etc', 'actually', 'got', 'chills', 'when', 'saw', 'Cotton', 'charging', 'demon-fire', 'force', 'evil', 'whatever-it-was', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'faith', 'had', 'been', 'furiously', 'rekindled', 'instant', 'said', 'lot', 'character', 'Being', 'person', 'absolutely', 'faith', 'found', 'moment', 'inspiring', 'Anyway', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'fun', 'ending', 'good', 'performances', 'Naysayers', 'can', 'pick', 'apart', 'like', ""'ll"", 'kick', 'back', 'enjoy', 'anyway']",N/A

1348982,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003L20IEW,C. Sawin,"[8, 13]","I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a big fan of films about exorcism. I watched The Exorcist years ago and while it's probably due for a re-watch now that I'm older and a bit more experienced in movie watching, it still felt like ""one of the scariest films of all time"" was fantastically overrated. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy [REC] 2 which is more possession based than its predecessor and at least hinted at exorcism. Despite all of that, The Last Exorcism still looked intriguing and it managed to mostly deliver before falling victim to its own momentum.The first person, handheld camera, documentary filming style is used here and while most can argue that the technique has been done to death, it was probably one of the film's greatest strengths. While this filming style has felt like certain directors cashing in on a current trend in the past, it's at least utilized to its full potential in this film. It actually gave The Last Exorcism a bit of a realistic quality to it. Not that you actually believed this was actually happening, but it was easier to put yourself in the shoes of these characters than if it had been filmed the traditional way. It's worth noting that there's at least one scene involving the camera and Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) that is pretty creative and memorable.The Last Exorcism is certainly a slow burn kind of film. It starts off a bit sluggish and begins to snowball into a tense, nail biting thriller. The first half of the film is filled with bits of humor and the life of Cotton Marcus. We're introduced to what his sermons are like in church and he begins to explain these faux exorcisms he performs in order for these families to continue on with their lives. Things are a little slow at first and it may put off some people, but it pays off and really adds weight to Cotton's character. Character development is never a bad thing and it's almost nonexistent in many horror films these days. It was nice having the little bits of comedy actually be funny, too. The one downside is that if somebody religious goes to see this movie; they may view it as blasphemous. To tell the truth, that's one of the reasons I was enjoying it. Films that make you think or make you question your religious beliefs can be pretty extraordinary.The film shines brightest during the scenes directly leading up to or taking place during Cotton's exorcisms or pretty much anything involving Nell Sweetzer. The things this little girl is actually capable of on camera is insane. Once Abalam shows up, the film has already established itself as a suspenseful and high tension building horror film. Things seem to be going so well until we get to the closing minutes of the film. That's what will make or break your opinion of The Last Exorcism. On one hand, what transpires is connected to something else earlier on in the film and is pretty amazing. On the other hand, it's kind of lame and the last few moments seem to channel The Blair Witch or an updated version of Rosemary's Baby.The Last Exorcism has a wonderful concept and its documentary style only adds to the terror taking place on film while it firmly establishes itself as an edge of your seat, bone-shaking supernatural thriller, but it really seems to collapse under everything it has going for it in its conclusion. It's certainly still recommendable if you're a fan of horror or exorcism films, but just be aware that The Last Exorcism may drop the ball before the credits roll.",3,A bone-shaking supernatural thriller that falls flat in its final minutes.,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,3480,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'films', 'exorcism', 'watched', 'Exorcist', 'years', 'ago', 'probably', 'due', 're-watch', 'now', ""'m"", 'older', 'bit', 'more', 'experienced', 'movie', 'watching', 'still', 'felt', 'one', 'scariest', 'films', 'time', 'was', 'fantastically', 'overrated', 'did', 'however', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', '[', 'REC', ']', '2', 'more', 'possession', 'based', 'predecessor', 'least', 'hinted', 'exorcism', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'still', 'looked', 'intriguing', 'managed', 'mostly', 'deliver', 'falling', 'victim', 'own', 'momentum.The', 'first', 'person', 'handheld', 'camera', 'documentary', 'filming', 'style', 'used', 'here', 'most', 'can', 'argue', 'technique', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'film', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'filming', 'style', 'felt', 'certain', 'directors', 'cashing', 'current', 'trend', 'past', 'least', 'utilized', 'full', 'potential', 'film', 'actually', 'gave', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'bit', 'realistic', 'quality', 'Not', 'actually', 'believed', 'was', 'actually', 'happening', 'was', 'easier', 'put', 'shoes', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'traditional', 'way', 'worth', 'noting', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'camera', 'Nell', 'Sweetzer', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'pretty', 'creative', 'memorable.The', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'certainly', 'slow', 'burn', 'kind', 'film', 'bit', 'sluggish', 'snowball', 'tense', 'nail', 'biting', 'thriller', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'filled', 'bits', 'humor', 'life', 'Cotton', 'Marcus', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'what', 'sermons', 'are', 'church', 'explain', 'faux', 'exorcisms', 'order', 'families', 'continue', 'lives', 'Things', 'are', 'little', 'slow', 'first', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'people', 'really', 'weight', 'Cotton', 'character', 'Character', 'development', 'never', 'bad', 'thing', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'days', 'was', 'nice', 'having', 'little', 'bits', 'comedy', 'actually', 'be', 'funny', 'too', 'one', 'downside', 'somebody', 'religious', 'see', 'movie', 'may', 'view', 'blasphemous', 'tell', 'truth', 'one', 'reasons', 'was', 'enjoying', 'Films', 'make', 'think', 'make', 'question', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'extraordinary.The', 'film', 'shines', 'brightest', 'scenes', 'directly', 'leading', 'up', 'taking', 'place', 'Cotton', 'exorcisms', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'involving', 'Nell', 'Sweetzer', 'things', 'little', 'girl', 'actually', 'capable', 'camera', 'insane', 'Once', 'Abalam', 'up', 'film', 'already', 'established', 'suspenseful', 'high', 'tension', 'building', 'horror', 'film', 'Things', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'get', 'closing', 'minutes', 'film', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'break', 'opinion', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'one', 'hand', 'what', 'connected', 'something', 'else', 'earlier', 'film', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'other', 'hand', 'kind', 'lame', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'seem', 'channel', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'updated', 'version', 'Rosemary', 'Baby.The', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'wonderful', 'concept', 'documentary', 'style', 'only', 'terror', 'taking', 'place', 'film', 'firmly', 'edge', 'seat', 'bone-shaking', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'really', 'collapse', 'everything', 'going', 'conclusion', 'certainly', 'still', 'recommendable', ""'re"", 'fan', 'horror', 'exorcism', 'films', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'may', 'drop', 'ball', 'credits', 'roll']",N/A

I think it was a lack of intensity and a lack of horror. The movie takes a long time before starting and when it does, it remains very simple and ordinary. The possession  scenes are very short and not very effective, lots  of them are also in the dark..which makes it very difficult to see whats  going on....is she there?....where is she?.....what is she doing?.....is she vomiting like crazy?...is her back curved like on the cover?.....is she crawling on the ceiling?......am i suppose to be scared?.......Cinematography was also a huge let down, i have no clue why they decided to do that, i think they were trying to make it look old or something.....if im right then they did a good job but they lost me with this picture quality, way to light and way to simple and a huge lack of colors. The ending is also very bad, i would have give it 3 stars if it wasn't because of the ending...I would've also gave it 3 star if i would've reviewed it from a ""regular movie fan"" point of view. Possession  is still a very interesting concept but im mostly a horror fan, and those topics needs to be done in a very effective way for me to fully appreciate the movie, i don't wanna see those subject  half-ass done, i wanna be scared and shock to the fullest. If i wanna laugh then i'll go for a cheesy horror film that wont disappoint my expectations.Overall this is a good movie from a regular movie point of view if we put horror aside.

He admits that the only reason he wants to preach and entertain his congregation is so they keep coming back and filling up the offering plate. The same reason his father was a preacher.The movie is shot in a documentary style because what we are watching is a documentary being filmed of Cotton Marcus explaining his angle on religion, belief, and deception. He claims that on some level he is actually offering a service that helps people, even though he is fooling them.To prove how easy it is to cure people of the tormenting evil in their lives, he plans to respond to a request for an exorcism. It will be his last, and it will be filmed so that he can show how he sets up his gadgets and uses slight of hand to fool people that what they believe is real.On the way to their destination Marcus and his two-person film crew encounter the locals of Louisiana, and he wryly plays into their beliefs and superstitions by asking directions to scenes of cult activity or UFO landing sights. Many are happy to oblige, and know of it all, even though the places or events are contrived.Once they arrive at the location of the exorcism things get strange, and stranger. This is when the film starts getting good. The slow pace is countered by little scares, moments of excitement, and the hand-held camera lends to the realism. The film actually creeped me out. It is really spooky at times. Downright brutal at other times too.They meet a father, his son and his daughter, the latter who is the alleged possessed. Marcus figures this will be an easy one, and proceeds with his usual game to earn their trust and faith. Then he sets up to perform an exorcism on the girl. His effects work perfectly and the family, except for the boy (watch it), fall for it hoof, horn and demon. Sorry.In cheesy Exorcist-copy-cat fashion, of course, the Reverend falls to the floor after uttering to the demon ""Take me!"" or something to that effect. But it's okay, he's faking it. He pretends to be possessed, convulses a bit, then ends his charade with the smoking crucifix effect. Brilliant! Everyone is relieved that the demon is out of the girl.Not so fast. Things get really screwed up now. The girl shows up at the Reverend's motel room and appears to be possessed for real. Now Marcus must reevaluate. Is there something supernatural at hand, or is this girl just a mixed up kid who's mind was tweaked by some unfortunate incident?Ultimately, Marcus and his crew find themselves knee-deep in some Louisiana muck. And it's not what you think.That's all I can say or I'll give away the whole plot. Let me end by saying that his is a clever, well made film with a lot of spirit. Enjoy it.

The premise: a pastor's son grows up in the family business, distilling spiritual pablum with ease and fervor. On the side, as part of his cash crop, he does exorcisms, but he doesn't actually believe that demons possess these clients. He believes it's all psychosomatic, superstitious stuff, wherein he can at least set them ""free"" from their fears.Told in a mock-umentary style, ""The Last Exorcism"" follows the reverend as he heads into the back bayous of Louisiana to ""deliver"" his last client, to once and for all prove that this exorcism stuff is a hoax and should stop being used to badger and injure innocent people. But is this particular case real? Is there actually something demonic happening here? Or is it a case of family secrets and lies coming out through the behavior of the beleaguered teenage girl?The acting and filming sucked me into this story, and I started caring not only about the girl, but about the reverend's own struggle between science and faith, logic and supernatural. Even up to the last ten minutes, I thought this still had a chance to explore some deep issues in an intriguing way. If you've already seen the film, imagine the boy Logan saying: ""Well, Reverend, what do YOU believe? And WHO do you believe?"" From there, our fearless but also faithless minister could've been confronted with his own theology where it ran headlong into the realities of this troubled family. Instead, we watch the movie take a sudden, disappointing turn into the territory of ""The Blair Witch Project.""I only wish I'd earlier noticed Eli Roth's (""Hostel"" and ""Piranha"") name attached to this. What felt fresh and promising turned stale and schlocky, wasting some good performances.

I understand human beings are stupid -- I work with the public and by and large, they're all idiots. While this is realistic, in horror movies, that point of no return for intelligence is, for lack of a better word, retarded. The Last Exorcism is a good movie up until this point. Everything clicks, the acting, the pace, the plot, until the characters start behaving like they just lost their minds.The Bad -- See above.The Ugly -- This movie is presented as a documentary; a finished documentary complete with a soundtrack and captions explaining the people and places profiled. However, none of the film crew survive the end and while the fate of the footage is ambiguous . . . wait, no it can't be because in the world of the movie, the documentary is polished and ready for viewing.

1348996,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B003L20IEW,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[5, 7]","THE LAST EXORCISMI will admit that when I first heard about this I was actually interested in it unlike another handheld style flick that was coming out. I have always been into these exorcism movies and it also had Eli Roth and the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake producers on board so I was into it. After finally seeing it I had to say I was impressed with some things and not so much on others. I will say that it is a good movie but it could have been a classic.The film follows Reverend Cotton Marcus on his quest to prove that demons are not real and neither are the exorcisms. You see Cotton is a preacher with no faith and believes he is basically a showman who can basically sell anything. You will see him make his point during a very humorous early scene at his church. So he just picks a letter and in front of the camera crew he has hired and is off to fix this family in need, or should I say prove there are no real exorcisms. When he gets there he meets the family in need, father Louis Sweetzer, son Caleb, and the daughter with the demon in her Nell. So he sets up his fake exorcism and is off and running, but something is wrong. It seems that Nell has real problems that may or may not be paranormal. In fact it seems that she is actually the victim of an abusive father and she is loosing it, or is she?I have to say that I actually really did enjoy this movie and while it did not reach classic status it was still good. It felt real for most of the film and that is both a good and bad thing. Up until the end this was really one film but the end of the film switched it around, while it was good for some I can see how this could confuse them. But I must say that the thing I really did like about this movie was the performances. Patrick Fabian as Rev. Cotton was excellent; I thought he did a perfect job on this film. He felt like a real guy in a very real situation and while he was just playing along with the family at first you can tell he is a good guy. In fact his reason for wanting to prove that exorcisms are fake is a noble one. Also it you get the sense that if he would have had faith from the beginning he may have been able to really help this family.Of course an exorcism movie is really leaning on the performance of the demon infested girl, and Ashley Bell was perfect in the role of Nell. She really did a good job as both a sweet innocent girl and as a demon possessed girl. She delivers some actual creepy moments; two in particular are really good. Louis Herthum as her father and Caleb Landry Jones as her brother are both excellent, as well as every one else in the film. The acting here is very well done so the casting was perfect. The script by Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland is very good as the film and the dialogue seem very real, so well done to director Daniel Stamm as well. It really is up to the viewer, if you like exorcism movies or are not thrown off by the ending you may really like this.I found this to be a good film but the real goodies here are the commentaries on the DVD/Blu-Ray release. Both are very good with one being the director and the actors and the other being the producers. Both are good with the director/actors one being more fun and lively and the producer being one of the absolute best learning commentaries I have ever heard. If you are interested in behind the scenes stuff and how films are made this is the commentary for you. The other bonus features are good as well but the commentaries are where it is at. I do recommend this film at least for a rental, I liked it.",5,COMMENTARY ELEVATES THIS TO 5 STARS,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,3555,"['LAST', 'EXORCISMI', 'will', 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'actually', 'interested', 'handheld', 'style', 'flick', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'exorcism', 'movies', 'also', 'had', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', 'producers', 'board', 'was', 'finally', 'seeing', 'had', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'things', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'others', 'will', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic.The', 'film', 'Reverend', 'Cotton', 'Marcus', 'quest', 'prove', 'demons', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'are', 'exorcisms', 'see', 'Cotton', 'preacher', 'faith', 'basically', 'showman', 'who', 'can', 'basically', 'sell', 'anything', 'will', 'see', 'make', 'point', 'very', 'humorous', 'early', 'scene', 'church', 'just', 'letter', 'front', 'camera', 'crew', 'hired', 'off', 'fix', 'family', 'need', 'should', 'say', 'are', 'real', 'exorcisms', 'When', 'there', 'family', 'need', 'father', 'Louis', 'Sweetzer', 'son', 'Caleb', 'daughter', 'demon', 'Nell', 'up', 'fake', 'exorcism', 'off', 'running', 'something', 'wrong', 'Nell', 'real', 'problems', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'paranormal', 'fact', 'actually', 'victim', 'abusive', 'father', 'loosing', 'have', 'say', 'actually', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'reach', 'classic', 'status', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'felt', 'real', 'most', 'film', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'end', 'was', 'really', 'one', 'film', 'end', 'film', 'switched', 'around', 'was', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'confuse', 'must', 'say', 'thing', 'really', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'performances', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'Rev', 'Cotton', 'was', 'excellent', 'thought', 'did', 'perfect', 'job', 'film', 'felt', 'real', 'guy', 'very', 'real', 'situation', 'was', 'just', 'playing', 'along', 'family', 'first', 'can', 'tell', 'good', 'guy', 'fact', 'reason', 'wanting', 'prove', 'exorcisms', 'are', 'fake', 'noble', 'one', 'Also', 'get', 'sense', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'faith', 'beginning', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'really', 'help', 'family.Of', 'course', 'exorcism', 'movie', 'really', 'leaning', 'performance', 'demon', 'infested', 'girl', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'Nell', 'really', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'girl', 'demon', 'possessed', 'girl', 'actual', 'creepy', 'moments', 'two', 'particular', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'Louis', 'Herthum', 'father', 'Caleb', 'Landry', 'Jones', 'brother', 'are', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'else', 'film', 'acting', 'here', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'script', 'Huck', 'Botko', 'Andrew', 'Gurland', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'director', 'Daniel', 'Stamm', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'viewer', 'like', 'exorcism', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'thrown', 'off', 'ending', 'may', 'really', 'like', 'this.I', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'real', 'goodies', 'here', 'are', 'commentaries', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'release', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'being', 'director', 'actors', 'other', 'being', 'producers', 'are', 'good', 'director/actors', 'one', 'being', 'more', 'fun', 'lively', 'producer', 'being', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', 'learning', 'commentaries', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'are', 'interested', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'how', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'commentary', 'other', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'commentaries', 'are', 'where', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'least', 'rental', 'liked']",N/A

The exorcism movies all bore me, but my boyfriend picked this movie out so I chose to suffer through it for him.  We both ended up glued to the screen, loving every minute of this movie.  The preacher has basically given up on his religion, so it starts with him taking everything as one big joke.  He's turned his craft into a pun, and he's allowed a documentary crew to follow him to see just how ridiculous exorcisms - and the customers requesting them - are.  This carries throughout the entire movie, until we're given one twist ending: okay, no demons, just some mental junk.  Pretty good.  But watch out, here comes yet ANOTHER twist ending - and this one is A LOT juicier!  I was in shock at how good this movie was...and also shocked at how many people did not like it.  I thought the Exorcism of Emily Rose was horrible: every second was soooo boring and incredibly predictable.

The film crew rides along with him as he journeys to the backwoods of Louisiana to ""exorcise"" a teenage girl who's been victimized by demonic possession, which has led to the nightly slaughter of much of her family's livestock. Upon arrival, the exorcist finds a distraught father, a surly, skeptical brother, and Nell--the sweet, innocent possessed. After performing a staged exorcism (complete with a smoke-emitting crucifix and prerecorded demonic voices), the minister and his crew leave the farm--only to find themselves drawn back by a series of inexplicable and troubling events. The mounting tension is handled deftly--allegations of alcoholism, an unexpected pregnancy and insinuations of incest complicate the plot.

I believe Rec. did this and the blair witch project also. The Last Exorcism looks like it is filmed with a high-res camcorder. All throughout the movie, even scenes of relative calm, are epileptically filmed. I wanted to scream out to the camera-man ""FOCUS""! I had a major headache midway through this movie, and felt sick to my stomach. But let's say you have a stronger stomach than I do, is this still a movie worth watching? Because of a weak script, moderate scariness, and seemingly no direction, I would have to say no.You meet a stageman-like young priest, with a family to feed, who has a problem with exorcism's. He believes that they are dangerous, and archaic. He deals with the phychology of exocism, and believes that he can treat it safely, and on his own, by doing a fake exocism that leads the family and person effected to believe the demon has been cast away. He is confident, and even arrogant in his abilities and of his assuredness of the world as he knows it.He invites people to mail him their cases and from out of his mailbox, he choses the one on top and sets off with a documentary maker. They drive to a rural, folksy part of Louisiana, and describe it as ancient, and as a place that many different cultures rub each other. As they come closer to their destination and ask for directions from the spooked people who live there, they listen to their warnings, and of old wives-tales about something unholy in the area that they travel to. But it does not seem to alarm the priest.They come to a good, simple, 16 yr old girl, who lives with her old fashioned, pious, father and perhaps dangerous brother in a place little traveled. There may be something wrong indeed with this girl, even if you do not believe in devils. The priest goes on with his fake exorcism, and it seems it may have worked. But it soon becomes clear that this may be different, and more dangerous than the young priest ever thought.The Last Excorcism deals with age-old fears that we carry within us, like our fears of the dark. But even with an effective set-up, and a spooky location, these fears are never fully utilized. There are moments of terror here, but they are too few and I felt that the house never seemed it could come to life with evil like the original. But as the ending comes, and you have long abandoned any notion of comparisons to the original Exocism, you feel like you are watching a differnt franchise. It feels more like the modern urban legend movie with an ending that left me unafraid, and without shock. This was a boring movie, with little effects, small scares, and not enough shockes to merit watching in the theater.

Now that the dizziness is starting to wear off, I definitely want to review this piece of trash.I hope everyone is having (and had) a safe and happy Labor Day Weekend 2010 (for those of you who are U.S. citizens).If you want to be happy and safe, it helps if you don't see this movie.  If you see it, you might be so dizzy that you can't drive home.  This movie is yet another ""shakey camcorder movie"" that is more distracting than it is good.  If you like horrible, I mean HORRIBLE camerawork from an AMATEUR cameraman and like feeling dizzy, having a headache, and want to strive for epilepsy, then see this garbage.  What, I mean WHAT is so hard about keeping a steady camera? I had the same complaint when it comes to The Blair Witch Project.  These camcorder movies are UNWATCHABLE because they are filmed by cameramen/women who give new meaning to the words AMATEUR CAMERAMAN.  I kept looking away every five seconds so I would keep my dizziness to a minimum.  I know that this movie is filmed from the perspective of the cameraman, but come on, the camera should NOT be shaking nonstop throughout the movie.  That is INEXCUSABLE.  A movie like this can be filmed with the camcorder feel to it WITHOUT having excessively shakey footage.  A person can use a camcorder, keep a STEADY CAMERA, and the audience will obviously still know the footage was taken with a camcorder because of how the movie is filmed.  The camera doesn't have to shake CONSTANTLY to remind the audience that it's a camcorder movie.  Whoever the cameraman was in this movie would shake the camera even while sitting down, stationary, and showing somebody's face who is sitting three feet in front of him.  HUH?????  How can anybody be  so incompetent?  This cameraman is somebody who was hired by the priest to film the documentary they were making.  I know I wouldn't want this cameraman filming anything for ME that's as important as a documentary!!!!!!  One thing about this ""reality"" movie, it definitely is a reflection of what is so rampant in today's society - people who can't keep a steady camera!!!!!  Everyone knows somebody who's a terrible cameraman.  I know I do.  This is a classic case of art imitating life, that's for sure.One of the people I was with (a friend of mine) got up and walked out of the theater about two-thirds of the way through the movie.  I thought he was heading for the restroom or the snack counter.  He came back a few minutes later and said he was feeling sick because of the shakey camcorder footage and he almost threw up.  All of us decided to walk out, and we did (SMART MOVE).  We got in the car and were driving through the theater parking lot and about two minutes later my friend rolled down the window and threw up all over the pavement.Have you noticed I haven't even talked about the plot and story in this review?  It's not even worth doing.  I feel the most important information you should know about this movie is the quality of the camerawork.  Seriously.  I'm not kidding.Folks, DO NOT see this movie.  The movie itself, even if the cameraman would have kept a steady camera, is nothing great.  Just some demonically possessed 16-year-old girl who kills farm animals, her own cat, and stabs her brother.

1349016,A2AVD56NK41OPE,B003L20IEW,Jonathan Stover,"[0, 1]","The current mini-trend of low-budget, faux horror 'documentaries' has its roots as much in the current plethora of TV shows that include Ghost Hunters and its various ilk as it does in the 1999 out-of-nowhere hit The Blair Witch Project. And many of these movies are quite good -- Paranormal Activity, especially, crafted its scares with care, and remained true to the internal logic of its 'documentary made from found footage' conceit.Alas, The Last Exorcism buggers things up in the last ten minutes, as its story of an American fundamentalist Christian exorcist who's lost his faith (or never really had any) suddenly goes off the tracks of both its conceit and basic logic in order to deliver a twist ending that's frankly kinda dumb. Oh, the ending is foreshadowed...foreshadowed to the extreme!...but it still makes very little narrative sense. More importantly, it makes the 'documentary' impossible, especially a documentary that's clearly been edited and even scored with spooky music at points. Apparently, the Devil enjoys doing post-production work.The film might have actually worked better had it completely abandoned the attempt to emulate The Blair Witch Project and instead been a narrative film involving a documentary crew following the priest around on his ""last exorcism."" That last exorcism, essentially picked out of a hat by the pastor, allows the pastor to show off the gimmicks he uses to make people believe they're being exorcised, including a smoke-emitting cross, pre-recorded ""demon"" howls, and carefully hidden strings attached to pictures and other moveable objects in a room. I'll say this for the movie -- the gimmicks look ""real"", and they also look like they might really be used by unscrupulous exorcists to convince people that the supernatural is afoot.The film also suffers from a problem that it shares with The Blair Witch Project -- and I'm not talking about the latter film's absurd, suspension-of-disbelief-destroying scene in which two old codgers are clearly fishing in about 1/2 an inch of water for, I don't know, waterbugs, I guess. No, the filmmakers don't choose a sufficiently overgrown portion of Louisiana for key parts of the movie, thus mirroring the daytime scenes in TBWP in which the three film students appear to be lost in some of the less woodsy areas of my backyard. Do people from cities notice these things?Another problem lies in the film bringing up real, serious issues about exorcisms and the tendency of people to accidentally die during them (the pastor has a documentary crew following him around so that he can debunk exorcism on his last case for exactly this reason -- he's realized that what he does can be dangerous when done by other people), and then throwing such issues under the bus with the last ten minutes of the film. I don't think this is irresponsible -- only an idiot would take his or her real-world cues from a fictional film about exorcisms. It's just bad writing.Still, the performances -- especially by Patrick Fabian as the fallen pastor and Ashley Bell as the ""possessed"" 16-year-old girl -- are quite good, and the film engaged me up until the last ten minutes. So I'll say Recommended, but only if you turn off the movie at the point at which the pastor says, ""Say, what was the name of that cafe the boy was supposed to work at?"" After this point, the movie turns into a bad remake of the South Park episode ""Christmas Critters"", only without Santa Claus or abortion-performing mountain-lion cubs. Say what you will about Eric Cartman, but he does understand narrative consistency.",3,Fire Walk With Me,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,3583,"['current', 'mini-trend', 'low-budget', 'faux', 'horror', ""'documentaries"", 'roots', 'much', 'current', 'plethora', 'TV', 'shows', 'include', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'various', 'ilk', '1999', 'out-of-nowhere', 'hit', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'especially', 'crafted', 'scares', 'care', 'remained', 'true', 'internal', 'logic', ""'documentary"", 'made', 'found', 'footage', 'conceit.Alas', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'buggers', 'things', 'up', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'story', 'American', 'fundamentalist', 'Christian', 'exorcist', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'suddenly', 'tracks', 'conceit', 'basic', 'logic', 'order', 'deliver', 'twist', 'ending', 'frankly', 'kinda', 'dumb', 'Oh', 'ending', 'foreshadowed', 'foreshadowed', 'extreme', 'still', 'very', 'little', 'narrative', 'sense', 'More', 'importantly', ""'documentary"", 'impossible', 'especially', 'documentary', 'clearly', 'been', 'edited', 'even', 'scored', 'spooky', 'music', 'points', 'Apparently', 'Devil', 'doing', 'post-production', 'work.The', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'completely', 'abandoned', 'attempt', 'emulate', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'instead', 'been', 'narrative', 'film', 'involving', 'documentary', 'crew', 'following', 'priest', 'last', 'exorcism', 'last', 'exorcism', 'essentially', 'picked', 'hat', 'pastor', 'pastor', 'show', 'off', 'gimmicks', 'make', 'people', 'believe', ""'re"", 'being', 'exorcised', 'including', 'smoke-emitting', 'cross', 'pre-recorded', 'demon', 'howls', 'carefully', 'hidden', 'strings', 'attached', 'pictures', 'other', 'moveable', 'objects', 'room', ""'ll"", 'say', 'movie', 'gimmicks', 'look', 'real', 'also', 'look', 'might', 'really', 'be', 'used', 'unscrupulous', 'exorcists', 'convince', 'people', 'supernatural', 'afoot.The', 'film', 'also', 'problem', 'shares', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'latter', 'film', 'absurd', 'suspension-of-disbelief-destroying', 'scene', 'two', 'old', 'codgers', 'are', 'clearly', 'fishing', 'about', '1/2', 'inch', 'water', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'waterbugs', 'guess', 'No', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'choose', 'sufficiently', 'overgrown', 'portion', 'Louisiana', 'key', 'parts', 'movie', 'thus', 'mirroring', 'daytime', 'scenes', 'TBWP', 'three', 'film', 'students', 'appear', 'be', 'lost', 'less', 'woodsy', 'areas', 'backyard', 'Do', 'people', 'cities', 'things', 'problem', 'film', 'bringing', 'up', 'real', 'serious', 'issues', 'exorcisms', 'tendency', 'people', 'accidentally', 'die', 'pastor', 'documentary', 'crew', 'following', 'around', 'so', 'can', 'debunk', 'exorcism', 'last', 'case', 'exactly', 'reason', 'realized', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'when', 'done', 'other', 'people', 'then', 'throwing', 'such', 'issues', 'bus', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'irresponsible', 'only', 'idiot', 'would', 'take', 'real-world', 'cues', 'fictional', 'film', 'exorcisms', 'just', 'bad', 'writing.Still', 'performances', 'especially', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'fallen', 'pastor', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'possessed', '16-year-old', 'girl', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'engaged', 'up', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'So', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Recommended', 'only', 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'point', 'pastor', 'Say', 'what', 'was', 'name', 'boy', 'was', 'supposed', 'work', 'point', 'movie', 'bad', 'remake', 'South', 'Park', 'episode', 'Christmas', 'Critters', 'only', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'abortion-performing', 'mountain-lion', 'cubs', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'about', 'Eric', 'Cartman', 'understand', 'narrative', 'consistency']",N/A
1349017,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B003L20IEW,Jordan David,"[0, 0]","Horror films hardly ever end well, and that applies to the genre in more ways than one.  Barring some pretty revolutionary stuff to arrive during the 70's and 80's, it's been the 21st century that introduced us to the nihilistic torture porn; an offbeat resurgence of snuff, but still characteristically modern.  Well, to no one's surprise, with this kind of source material came some truly bleak concepts and franchises that still influence horror to this day, and likely will for at least another decade.The point is, with this bleakness arose an abrupt halt to those feel-good horror films that give the protagonists a free ride home, and even exhilarate the audiences with a fleeting glimpse of a sequel.  Nope.  Here, things hardly ever end well and, if you can guess what the other side of the coin may entail, both are something that Stamm's Exorcism struggles with.I feel obligated to let you know that things end abruptly and in undramatic fashion.  Don't ever forget this, and you will thank yourself by the time the credits start rolling.  Like any carnival of terror, it's not the departing that's worth remembering, but the arrival and experience; every jump and chill shouldn't be forgotten.  To hell with the sudden (bittersweet?) revelation that it was all an illusion as you walk into the bristling sunlight.Okay, well...keep that in mind because, unfortunately, The Last Exorcism needs to come to a close and while the results feel shockingly brief and uninspired, this is a thriller - in a horror's guise, no less - that knows where it's going for 95% of the time, and does so with grace.So, it is scary?  Definitely.  It's restrained, to be sure and, although that may have been used as a barometer in the past to separate the good horror from the bad, it doesn't always apply here.  Nonetheless, the imagery here is memorable enough, in no small part to a terrific setting and some particularly clever elements in association with the docu-style that's seldom exploited, so those who fear motion sickness can feel relieved.Hardly a faux documentary in the strictest sense of the word, Stamm's exorcism feels, nonetheless, like one of the more personal thrillers to emerge in years, very much due to some strikingly intriguing and powerful performances by Patrick Fabian and Ashley Bell.  Really, no matter how much of a bitter taste may be left in my mouth from its close, each and every recollection of one of Bells' show-stopping scenes brings me back down to reality, and assures me that this is something quite special.The other, Fabian, solely embodies all of the elements of the film that make it feel so unique, even if it really isn't.  There's an air of surreal horror at work here that few other films have captured on the nature of exorcism and, indeed, religion itself.  It embeds a true sense of intrigue and skepticism within all of us that's been missing in other iterations of the premise.  So many forget that Satan is understood as the father of lies and deceit.Being agnostic, it resonated with me, this analysis of his Unholy, putting the sheer might of religious belief into perspective, and the results are quite disturbing.  Needless to say, it sticks with you, this film. , and you'll be asking yourself questions that took quite some time to emerge in the first place.",3,The Last Exorcism,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3314,"['Horror', 'films', 'hardly', 'ever', 'end', 'well', 'applies', 'genre', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Barring', 'pretty', 'revolutionary', 'stuff', 'arrive', '70', '80', 'been', '21st', 'century', 'introduced', 'nihilistic', 'torture', 'porn', 'offbeat', 'resurgence', 'snuff', 'still', 'characteristically', 'modern', 'Well', 'one', 'surprise', 'kind', 'source', 'material', 'came', 'truly', 'bleak', 'concepts', 'still', 'influence', 'horror', 'day', 'likely', 'will', 'least', 'decade.The', 'point', 'bleakness', 'arose', 'abrupt', 'halt', 'feel-good', 'horror', 'films', 'give', 'protagonists', 'free', 'ride', 'home', 'even', 'exhilarate', 'audiences', 'fleeting', 'glimpse', 'sequel', 'Nope', 'Here', 'things', 'hardly', 'ever', 'end', 'well', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'may', 'entail', 'are', 'something', 'Stamm', 'Exorcism', 'with.I', 'feel', 'obligated', 'let', 'know', 'things', 'end', 'abruptly', 'undramatic', 'fashion', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'forget', 'will', 'thank', 'time', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', 'carnival', 'terror', 'not', 'departing', 'worth', 'remembering', 'arrival', 'experience', 'jump', 'chill', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'forgotten', 'hell', 'sudden', 'bittersweet', 'revelation', 'was', 'illusion', 'walk', 'bristling', 'sunlight.Okay', 'well', 'keep', 'mind', 'unfortunately', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'come', 'close', 'results', 'feel', 'shockingly', 'brief', 'uninspired', 'thriller', 'horror', 'guise', 'less', 'where', 'going', '95', '%', 'time', 'so', 'grace.So', 'scary', 'Definitely', 'restrained', 'be', 'sure', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'barometer', 'past', 'separate', 'good', 'horror', 'bad', ""n't"", 'always', 'apply', 'here', 'Nonetheless', 'imagery', 'here', 'memorable', 'enough', 'small', 'part', 'terrific', 'setting', 'particularly', 'clever', 'elements', 'association', 'docu-style', 'seldom', 'exploited', 'who', 'fear', 'motion', 'sickness', 'can', 'feel', 'relieved.Hardly', 'faux', 'documentary', 'strictest', 'sense', 'word', 'Stamm', 'exorcism', 'feels', 'nonetheless', 'one', 'more', 'personal', 'thrillers', 'emerge', 'years', 'very', 'much', 'due', 'strikingly', 'intriguing', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'Really', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'bitter', 'taste', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'mouth', 'close', 'recollection', 'one', 'Bells', 'show-stopping', 'scenes', 'back', 'down', 'reality', 'something', 'quite', 'special.The', 'other', 'Fabian', 'solely', 'elements', 'film', 'make', 'feel', 'so', 'unique', 'even', 'really', ""n't"", 'air', 'surreal', 'horror', 'work', 'here', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'captured', 'nature', 'exorcism', 'indeed', 'religion', 'true', 'sense', 'intrigue', 'skepticism', 'been', 'missing', 'other', 'iterations', 'premise', 'So', 'many', 'forget', 'Satan', 'understood', 'father', 'lies', 'deceit.Being', 'agnostic', 'resonated', 'analysis', 'Unholy', 'putting', 'sheer', 'might', 'religious', 'belief', 'perspective', 'results', 'are', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'asking', 'questions', 'took', 'quite', 'time', 'emerge', 'first', 'place']",N/A

Being a huge fan of horror movies, I knew that this was on my must-see list.The story follows a reverend as he attempts to prove that things like possession don't actually occur (yeah, you know where this is headed).  It is another fake-documentary movie that resembles ones likeThe Blair Witch Project(in more ways than one...such as running through the forest, with the camera bouncing all over the place.  I half expected to see the Blair Witch symbol appear in the trees, as they run past) andRosemary's Baby.  So, the reverend gets called to this house where animals are being killed by the young daughter (who doesn't remember anything in between going to sleep and waking up with a blood-stained outfit).  So begins the task of being paid to ""get the demon out of this girl"".It would've been a fine movie...if it was scary.  There was one part that had the whole theater screaming, but in shocked horror more than actually being terrified (I didn't see that part because I could see what was going to happen and had my head buried in my jacket).  It also would've been a fine movie if it wasn't for the completely random and bizarre ending that they stuck on it.  The movie was just starting to get good when they do a ""Rosemary's Blair Witch Baby"" (to quote Entertainment Weekly) on it and leave you with this diappointed and confused feeling.At the very end, when the screen went black, no body in my theater moved, obviously hoping and expecting something else.

I know they didn't spend any money on dollies to support the camera while shooting since just about every shot was of the extremely-shaky hand-held variety (and besides, I'm not sure they make camera dollies for video-capturing cellphones held by someone exhibiting severe signs of delirium tremens). Did the shaky and out-of-focus hand-held shots make it look more dramatically real to me as perhaps was the intended effect dictated by the director's esoteric visions of artistic grandeur? No, they made it look like the cinematographer had just turned five years old and had hired his younger brother to be the cameraboy. Did the supposedly scary religious superstition about demonic possession fill the essence of my movie-addicted soul with the exotic thrill of a mind-altering mood-modifying fear-intoxication diabolically drenched in the metaphoric mud puddles of dread and doom? No, but it did make me regret placing this flick at the top of my Queue. But with a worldwide Box Office gross of $62,456,444, I suppose no one can justifiably accuse the producers of being commercially stupid. The history of Hollywood continues to prove that if something works once, it will usually keep working again and again until movie-going audiences learn to become a little bit more discriminating about how much they will pay and what their minimal entertainment expectations will be in return for parting with a small slice of their discretionary-income pie.

1349026,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B003L20IEW,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[23, 26]","THE LAST EXORCISM is a ""mockumentary"" in the style of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, chronicling the last exorcism performed by Preacher Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian), a televangelist who has made himself famous by performing psychosuggestive exorcisms on credulous subjects. After reading of the death of a child by exorcism, the Preacher renounces his stage-managed performances and embraces medical science. During the course of the film he demonstrates his ""demonic"" sound-producing equipment and a battery operated smoking crucifix.Marcus brings a camera along to the home of his last ""possessed"" adherent, a young girl named Nell, who lives on an isolated farm with her hostile brother and gun-toting father. Farm animals have been found mutilated on the premises. The father is convinced that Nell has killed them. He wants to shoot Nell in order to stop any more evil from occurring, but Preacher Marcus convinces him to allow the exorcism. Although it initially seems to work, soon increasingly bizarre things begin occurring. Marcus is convinced that mental illness is to blame, but the Bible-intoxicated father insists on another round of exorcism.As the story progresses,the viewer is left to wonder if the father, the brother or the daughter is the perpetrator. The family seems severely dysfunctional, and Nell appears to be a victim. For the first half of the film, it isn't even clear whether this IS a documentary or not. As most of the cast is little-known, the film's director maintains this fiction for a long while. It is only near the end that the question is answered.I did not expect to enjoy this film, but it was oddly compelling and quite convincing.

1349028,A387HWHHYFIA92,B003L20IEW,Kyle Johnson,"[4, 7]","The Last Exorcism is an inspiring and unique example of quality horror cinema.  It does things exceptionally well that so many others do not.  First and foremost, one has to look at characters and characterization.  The inherent benefit of mockumentary style is that it gives the viewer a more intimate look at a film's subjects.  However, the general problem with these films is that the characters are useless.  Take Paranormal Activity for example: while the film is very well made and does a wonderful job in creating an overwhelming sense of dread by creating the feeling that something terrible is going to happen to the main characters at any moment, it takes far too much effort to empathize with or pity them, particularly Micah.  Micah, like the three primaries in The Blair Witch Project, comes across more annoying than anything else, to the point where the audience isn't sure whether they'd like to see him survive or be spoonfed to his grisly fate.  Not so in The Last Exorcism.  Patrick Fabian's Cotton Marcus is an exceptional character, and a very realistic one at that.  He comes across as altogether endearing and human, and that's a rare thing in a genre so rafter-packed with cliches and stock.The character of the pastor mid-crisis of faith is a delicate one, and those who created Marcus handled him with extreme care.  While most are content to club the idea of a character losing touch with God over the audience's heads (see Signs for a sterling example of this), The Last Exorcism presents it rationally and without bias.  What's brilliant about this turn, aside from it never really being explicitly stated, is that it doesn't come on the heels of the typical devastating loss, ala Signs.  Cotton Marcus does not curse God for the son he lost, or even for the hardship that he, his wife, and his son must bear with his son's disability.  No, he instead feels gratitude toward humanity in delivering him his son before he feels gratitude to God.  It isn't a falling out, and it isn't a huge topic that is prodded at length over the course of the film.  It is simply a man reaching a stage in his life where he questions some things.Where the film also excels is the handling of religious topics, particularly the titular exorcism.  Marcus acknowledges that exorcisms do not truly exorcise demons and concedes the tricks of the trade as the movie progresses, but he never devalues it as a service, defending it as a means to assuage people of a certain disposition into feeling at peace.  In actuality, the film manages to touch upon a number of topics with careful subtlety when it would be easy to brandish them like the Mj&ouml;llnir, and never really chooses to take a stance for the audience, perhaps having enough trust in the viewer to draw their own conclusions.  The exorcism and its use is played as something of a microcosm of religion in general, leaving the viewer to decide whether it should be taken at face value or as something of a placebo for those who need the feeling of divinity before they can help themselves.  Handled gracefully, too, is the relationship between religion and psychiatric care, and deciding where, in a case such as the one portrayed in the film, one should end and the other should take hold.The film succeeds in never being strictly black and white, but it's never vague to the point of confusion.  The question of whether or not the girl, Nell (played smartly and with conviction by Ashley Bell), is truly possessed is up in the air through almost the entirety of the film.  And that is how it is best played in this case.  Things happen that seem very supernatural, but not enough to where the viewer doesn't wonder whether or not Cotton Marcus is being led through his own spookhouse presentation of a fictionalized exorcism.  In The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, there is no question as to what is happening.  Here, played a bit straighter, it is meant to be a point of contention.  And it is refreshing that this gray scale way of thinking is applied to so much of the film: cinema involving demonic possession loves the idea of ultimate good and ultimate evil.  The villain (ostensibly, the devil himself) is the original archetype for all things evil, dastardly shacking up in and desecrating the embodiment of innocence (in each case, the body of a young girl).  The hero is the man of God, righteous and holy, Christ-like in his willingness to sacrifice himself for the victim (Merrin and Karras in The Exorcist).  Every character here is gray.  There is no good, no evil.  Everyone's motive is questionable, even Nell's.  While leaving things so open to interpretation and very much without concrete shades of light and dark may come off to some as a cop out, it is rather a very realistic and, again, human way of telling a story.For all of this, The Last Exorcism is very much one of the finest films in the horror genre in the last decade, if not the last twenty years.  It doesn't go for shocks, the characters seldom (if ever) act irrationally outside of what they are, and there is little or no reliance on jump scares, all of which have, for some reason, become the bread and butter of making a modern day horror film.  What it does is tell a very good story about flawed people while allowing the audience to decide if what they are watching is psychological or supernatural.  It has confidence in the story, the characters, and those who are watching it, and that is something quite refreshing in horror.That is, until the last ten minutes.The Last Exorcism, for all the good work it does toward presenting a smart, subtle movie, sabotages itself in the grandest of fashions with the ending.  And while a bad ending tacked onto a bad film still makes a bad film, an equally bad ending fixed to very above average, smarter-than-it-has-any-right-to-be fare makes that bad ending quite a lot worse while turning what should have been an excellent film into something absolutely disappointing.  The problem is that the film ends (assuming the film ended about where it should have) on a note that leans toward a direction without entirely tipping the scales and still manages to have a pretty happy ending, which is apparently a no-no in contemporary horror cinema.  If I may be perscriptive for a moment, I feel the film would have been much better served with an ending where Cotton is reunited with his family, resuming the life he left for the uneasy period of time he spent performing the exorcism.  It would have been an ending keeping in tone with the rest of the film: realistic and human.  But one cannot be so dense as to assume that it is logical to have a horror film end on an up note.  No, instead, contemporary films in the genre must almost unanimously end with either a shock twist or sequel pandering.  And The Last Exorcism spectacularly mucks it up with the former.Every shred of confidence the filmmakers seem to find in their audience is obliterated, every tone of gray is bled into stygian black, and every bit of subtlety is smashed to bits in the loudest manner possible.  The ending of The Last Exorcism is particularly bad because it squanders every ounce of good faith the film spent about seventy minutes masterfully building.  It isn't so much like watching someone carefully craft an elegant house of cards only to knock it down with a quick swipe as it is watching that same house of cards built to be doused with gasoline and burned down to ash, which is then spat upon by the one who made it.The ending the filmmakers provide us with is no better than a simplistic ""it was all a dream"" reveal, straight from the Shyamalan School of Filmmaking.  It's entirely unnecessary and seems to show a great deal about what the folks involved think of the modern horror movie crowd.  It is as if they feared their film would isolate the audience by not having enough gratuitous violence and things jumping out at the camera, and that people who watch these films can't handle uncertainty and need that stark black and white contrast, even if it only manages to do so for the ten minute denouement.  It takes out any trace of left over ambiguity in favor of wrapping it up in a tidy little package, the gift tag addressed to the most dunderheaded of filmgoers.  Director Daniel Stamm said in an interview that the intention was to jar the viewer by throwing them a last second curveball and change their perception of the kind of movie they'd been watching for the last hour.  And to that end, The Last Exorcism succeeds: its ending is most certainly jarring for quite the wrong reasons, and manages to turn something intelligent and unique into something tawdry and stupefying.There are those who say that without the ending as it is, The Last Exorcism is not truly a horror movie.  These are people who do not understand or appreciate horror for what it truly is and can be.  These are people whose only basic understanding of horror is what they have learned from films today, which largely fail to miss the point.  Horror does not necessarily need to deal with the extremes of true good and true evil, nor does it always require supernatural elements or a superfluous amount of gore.  Quite often, horror is best derived from the human condition, and that is what eighty percent of this film seems to understand.  The horror comes from the circumstances and the people involved in them, not from the ancient demon supposedly occupying the girl's body.  The horror is the situation that Nell, a young girl, finds herself in, regardless of whether it is the work of a demon or a product of her environment.  And the movie gets that right.  Well, until the ending, where, again, the filmmakers must have feared they would lose the jaded horror fan whose only understanding of the concept is that it isn't scary unless people die and things jump out at the camera.  The ending is much like a screamer video someone's friend would trick them into watching: sure, it may provide a jolt (though I feel the ending here fails to do even that as it manages to be more predictable than anything in the film to that point), but it provides nothing to the narrative.  Not even that.  It diminishes and cheapens everything that came before it.  And it leaves one wondering whether this is an act of the filmmakers dumbing it way down to meet their audience's expectations, or if they simply managed to overachieve for seventy-odd minutes before showing their true colors.I must recommend The Last Exorcism, but I qualify that by saying I can only recommend the movie through about the 75-minute mark.  I feel that it is a film that will benefit from home video release, if only because the film can be stopped before Marcus and the documentary crew reach the diner.  To that point, it is pretty exceptional, and might be one of the best horror films in a long time.  It just happens to go downhill at such a breakneck pace thereafter that it seems to be a willful engagement in the destruction of the film's credibility.  And by not knowing where to stop and call it a day, The Last Exorcism hamstrings itself just short of being something wonderful.",3,Nine-Tenths Brilliant Does Not a Masterpiece Make *May Contain

It was carefully, sneakily alluded too several times. And it was straight out of Lovecraft.Secondly complaining about the quality of the film is another useless criticism. It is supposed to be a fake documentary. And in that it succeeds brilliantly. In the first couple of moments of the film I found myself reacting with a little skepticism, until I realized that the Cotton character was pitch perfect for a contemporary fraud. Likewise Ashley Bell does a perfect job. She was just off enough, unlike a movie actress, to make me believe in her. The other actors likewise all felt more like real folks than actors.Thirdly this was not pastiche. This was not a crude slapping together of Rosemary's Baby, Marjoe and the Exorcist. (And when have you seen these things put together before???) Yes it had elements linking those films, but it was hardly culled from them. And the imitation documentary angle really threw it into another zone.And most importantly the film actually had some intellectual muscles on it. It was a bit of a treatise on the loss of faith in a deeply ironic time. Eli Roth and the other producers say as much in their commentary. Having Cotton pick up his plastic cross to try to find faith again was at the heart of the whole film.Now the people who hate this film seem to be the kind of folks who like a horror film to run on predictable tracks. I have a friend who just told me she thought it was stupid. No further explanation. She's hated some other films that seemed to have a point to them as well. Well for some people things just suck or are stupid. The cure for such simplistic criticisms might be to watch a few films with subtitles: fat chance of that.But for my money...

1349039,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003L20IEW,Mark Turner,"[1, 3]","Over the past decade or so there have been a number of films that have gone the fake documentary route. The first film to do this effectively was THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT which when coupled with a fantastic online viral campaign stirred up enough interest to make it a hugely successful independent film. It had people wondering if this were really a lost documentary that was found or a feature film. With the exception of the fact it stars actors, the same could be said of the just released THE LAST EXORCISM.All the hints were there. The ""based on a true story"" line that got around when the film was released. The film is shot like a documentary. But the question of did it really happen or not will stick with viewers once the film ends.The story revolves around Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian), a Holy Roller revivalist style preacher who's been at it since he was a child. His father groomed him to take over the family business one day and he's done well with it. He preaches to a receiving crowd and gets them on their feet with amen's and halleluiahs. But Cotton not only deals with a regular Sunday service, he also performs exorcisms.Having done so for years, he read about a young boy who was killed during one such exorcism and now, with a son of his own, he fears that people might be taking advantage of situations where a psychological problem is going on to make money. Not wanting to be responsible for such an act, he has a consented to a film crew following him in the hopes that this film will prevent people from what he feels are un-needed exorcisms.Cotton doesn't believe in demons. One is left not being certain that he believes in the Devil himself. But he does know how to get a crowd on their feet and how to convince someone that possession does take place.Opening the first letter on his desk, Cotton and his film crew go to a remote Louisiana farmhouse where the owner says his daughter is possessed and has killed some of his livestock. After the owner's son Caleb (Caleb Landry Jones) tries to scare them off, they end up at the farmhouse and visit Louis Sweetzer (Louis Herthum) and his daughter Nell (Ashley Bell). While everything seems fine, Cotton pretends that the girl is indeed possessed and suggests and exorcism.From here we witness Cotton setting the stage with fishing line attached to paintings, speakers with eerie recordings placed in the room and even a smoking cross he uses batteries for. Cotton lays the girl down and performs the exorcism to his ""satisfaction"" and once paid heads to town to stay in the local motel.But during the night the girl shows up in his room. They take her to a hospital and she is treated and then released to her father. But her behavior doesn't improve and he insists that Cotton do another exorcism.Arriving at the farm they find Caleb's face slashed by Nell. Convincing Louis to take him to the hospital, they try and calm down Nell and stay with her. And it is at this point that the strange things begin to happen. Is Nell truly possessed? Or is she simply suffering from severe psychological problems that began when her mother died of cancer two years earlier?A few other mysterious plot twists are played out (though I won't spoil them by revealing them here) and eventually a final revelation is brought about that offers some truly skin crawling moments. While there isn't a lot of gore involved in the film, it is definitely something not for the kids to see.The true story throughout this film is less about exorcism and more about the journey Cotton Marcus goes through in restoring his faith. He's all about trickery and deceit to make a buck in God's name and he denies that demons even exist. But before this exorcism is through Cotton will have to decide if his beliefs are based on the almighty dollar or in his belief in God.The acting here is great with everyone performing as if these are not film roles but the emotions, actions and thoughts of real people witnessed as things happen. Not one can be singled out with perhaps the exception of Fabian as Cotton. His slick con man act gets turned topsy turvy as he performs only to find himself questioning the reality of the situation.While I found BLAIR WITCH to be too drawn out and boring getting to the final scene (which to this day gives me the creeps) this film isn't that way.

He preached, healed... even performed EXORCISMS. Now it seems he's had a change of heart and says that he's never witnessed a REAL demon and that his exorcisms are all fake. The preacher is going around with a film crew to debunk exorcisms.We follow the preacher around until he picks up his mail and then sees someone needing his help. Travel down the road in Louisiana and into the woods... where we are WARMLY greeted by a young man who throws rocks at and tells to ""head back the way you came"". So the preacher goes onward towards the house to meet a man who is very devout in his CHRISTIAN beliefs. His cattle are dying... and it seems to be his DAUGHTER who is causing all this.Well, this leads the preacher and the film crew down a path that is hard to turn away from. I won't give it all away because this is a MUST SEE FOR YOURSELF... but I will say the road is a hell of a journey and the ending is awesomely shocking.What makes THE LAST EXORCISM work is the believability.

(I wonder how much longer we're going to get movies like that)The Last Exorcism tells the story of an exorcist who has decided to come clean. For his last exorcism, he wants to document how he ""tricks"" the people into believing the rite has been performed.Patrick Fabian plays Cotton Marcus, the exorcist who receives a letter to deliver a Nell (Ashley Bell) from a demon. Nell's father is worried for his home schooled daughter. His livestock are being slaughtered and it seems as if Nell is to blame.Marcus and his documentary crew of two arrive to perform the ""exorcism"". After getting paid and providing Nell's father some peace of mind, the crew spend the night at a local motel.In the middle of the night, Nell shows up in one of their motel rooms seeming sleep walking.And the terror begins.This movie wasn't as scary as I figured it would be. I'm usually a push-over for scary movies but this one really didn't have too many scare moments. (There was a scene involving a poor farm cat...)Unlike most Found Footage films, The Last Exorcism has been edited and background music has been added. Who would have found the camera and decided to produce it with the kind of serious material found inside?Ashley Bell does a good job of giving the camera creepy stares and how in the world can she go so long without blinking?Like most horror films, this has an intriguing storyline with a few twists to keep things interesting. But sadly, the ending almost ruins the film. It takes one twist too many and ends in an almost different place.

The ending just tied the rest of it together and gave you the answer. I thought the skepticism inherent in the main characters added a lot.

1349054,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B003L20IEW,Monkdude,"[1, 3]","Here we go again. Another fake documentary like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. The Last Exorcism was made for less than 2 million dollars and without some very good acting performances, this thing would have fell flat on it's rotating, vomit spewing head. Most of the movie did have a feeling of authenticity, due to the raw camera footage and realistic work from Patrick Fabian, Ashely Bell and Louis Herthum. I liked how Fabian's priest character, Cotton, was really nothing more than a fraud. He had all these devices (demonic voices coming out of speakers, fishing string pulled to make pictures on the wall movie, and a cross that releases smoke to prove the demon has been vanquished) to create the illusion of an exorcism, in hopes of making the family believe the evil is gone, so they can move on with their lives. Ashley Bell plays the possessed girl, Nell, as subtle as you can possibly play a role like this and I bought it. She seemed so sweet and innocent, but had a weird Manson girl vibe going on. Nell's father, played by Louis Herthum, was believable as well, so I have no problems with the cast.Without giving too much away, the film has you guessing most of the time about whether or not Nell is actually in need of an exorcism or is she just mentally disturbed. You get the answer by end, but I expected some more chills along the way. The poster even shows her crawling on the ceiling, but that's nowhere to be found. Most of the stuff you see in the trailers are the scares, so don't expect any pea soup spitting or mutilations to the body with a cross. There are one or two scenes that were done well, but The Exorcist this is not. In fact, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is even a little better. The MPAA rating almost kept me away from the start, but this is a hard PG-13. Nothing too gruesome, but it also didn't feel like anything was chopped just to avoid the dreaded rated R.Most people just sat in their seats when the movie ended. One guy even shouted ""That's stupid"" as I left. The ending felt rushed and out of place with everything that preceded it. I don't think it's as horrible as most say, and to be honest, I don't know a good way to end a movie such as this. They picked a route and went down it.As a whole, The Last Exorcism isn't the fright fest I was hoping for, but the lead actors are engaging enough and there are a couple of genuinely creepy moments, so make this one a future rental.",3,Regan's demon would wipe the floor with Nell's,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2446,"['Here', 'go', 'again', 'fake', 'documentary', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'was', 'made', 'less', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'performances', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'fell', 'flat', 'rotating', 'vomit', 'spewing', 'head', 'Most', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'feeling', 'authenticity', 'due', 'raw', 'camera', 'footage', 'realistic', 'work', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'Ashely', 'Bell', 'Louis', 'Herthum', 'liked', 'how', 'Fabian', 'priest', 'character', 'Cotton', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'fraud', 'had', 'devices', 'demonic', 'voices', 'coming', 'speakers', 'fishing', 'string', 'pulled', 'make', 'pictures', 'wall', 'movie', 'cross', 'smoke', 'prove', 'demon', 'been', 'vanquished', 'create', 'illusion', 'exorcism', 'hopes', 'making', 'family', 'believe', 'evil', 'gone', 'can', 'move', 'lives', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'possessed', 'girl', 'Nell', 'as', 'subtle', 'can', 'possibly', 'play', 'role', 'bought', 'seemed', 'so', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'had', 'weird', 'Manson', 'girl', 'vibe', 'going', 'Nell', 'father', 'played', 'Louis', 'Herthum', 'was', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'problems', 'cast.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'film', 'guessing', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'Nell', 'actually', 'need', 'exorcism', 'just', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'get', 'answer', 'end', 'expected', 'more', 'chills', 'way', 'poster', 'even', 'crawling', 'ceiling', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Most', 'stuff', 'see', 'trailers', 'are', 'scares', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'pea', 'soup', 'spitting', 'mutilations', 'body', 'cross', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'Exorcist', 'not', 'fact', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'even', 'little', 'better', 'MPAA', 'rating', 'almost', 'kept', 'away', 'start', 'hard', 'PG-13', 'Nothing', 'too', 'gruesome', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'was', 'chopped', 'just', 'avoid', 'dreaded', 'rated', 'R.Most', 'people', 'just', 'sat', 'seats', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'One', 'guy', 'even', 'shouted', 'stupid', 'left', 'ending', 'felt', 'rushed', 'place', 'everything', 'preceded', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'horrible', 'most', 'say', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'such', 'picked', 'route', 'went', 'down', 'it.As', 'whole', 'Last', 'Exorcism', ""n't"", 'fright', 'fest', 'was', 'hoping', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'engaging', 'enough', 'are', 'couple', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'moments', 'so', 'make', 'one', 'future', 'rental']",N/A

I know its gotta be good."" Indeed kudos to the super slick creators of the theatrical poster. The image of that broken and tormented girl bent over backwards against a grimly gray dirty wall makes it one of the greatest movie posters I have ever seen. What the poster says is ""You are going to see something so horrific you wont believe your eyes. Yep, we plan to scare the living crap out of you."" As it turns out sadly and has been echoed by 90% of the membership here thus far, this movie simply doesnt deliver remotely anything you had hoped for. Yes the acting is good, there are some scares here and there, and a few suprises, but the film is honestly a total flop. I should have known better. I didn't care for Roth's movies except Hostel. I hated Cabin Fever in particular. Then considering members here felt 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' was far better? Well again I should have known better because that film was just ok. Oh well, live and learn. As I keep looking back at the movie poster art I'm imagining a really horrifying film in my mind.

That's what our protagonist, Cotton Marcus, is faced with the challenge to decide. Marcus has a good reputation for making Church almost a party atmosphere in his town, as our documentary crew shows. However, he doesn't believe in exorcism. When he is called down to do an exorcism in New Orleans, he takes us there and performs one of his ""exorcisms"" on her.In addition to the fact that he doesn't think Exocrism is logical/plausible, he fakes the exorcism (as per usual), and there's a funny scene where he shows us how he does this. However, at the hotel, it turns out this so called ""exorcism"" didn't really work, and so he is faced with the challenge- he must observe Nell's weird behavior with his documentary crew and bring himself to give her a real exorcism.When it comes to this film, you either love it or hate it. I liked it a lot, despite feeling like I was the only one in the theater who liked the film. The audience booed, shouted ""I want my free ticket back"" (this was at a pre-screening) and things of that nature, but I really liked the film.

1349079,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003L20IEW,RMurray847,"[3, 5]","THE LAST EXORCISM is yet another horror movie told through the use of ""captured by someone who just happens to be filming for some other reason"" device.  Examples include THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (which started it all, for better or worse), PARANORMAL ACTIVITY (captured by a home camcorder), DIARY OF THE DEAD (captured by the camcorder of a college student, plus other video from the web), CLOVERFIELD (camcorder), QUARANTINE (local news cameraman with an endless battery), etc.  In this current film, the events are captured through the raw footage taken by a low-budget documentary filmmaking team.But I must give credit once again to a device that continues to work effectively, at least in the realm of the horror movie.  I have trouble imagining a successful romantic comedy, for example, or a courtroom drama (but then again, no one has tried, so maybe I'm wrong).  I know a lot of people literally get sick at all the jerky camera motion...but I find it all quite compelling.  There's something about the dread that builds because it seems like you never know what the guy wielding the camera is going to capture...and more importantly, what he ISN'T going to capture.  Often, we hear screams or unsettling noises off screen, and the camera man never catches the visuals to go with it.  Or sometimes the camera swings past something and we catch only a brief, terrifying glimpse.  It's all becoming somewhat hokey...but if it's done with some care, it still works.  It works in THE LAST EXORCISM.In the opening section, we meet Rev. Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian), a revival-tent style preacher from Baton Rouge.  He's been preaching and healing since he was a child, and he's also made a good living performing exorcisms all around the south.  Turns out, however, that he has long since lost his faith...and he's become a cynical performer...effective in his use of vocal cadences, bible-thumping, scripture quoting and in having the general demeanor of a fire-and-brimstone kind of guy.  But he claims the exorcisms are done to help people who really need psychological help...but often fall prey to folks who really believe in demon possession.  He uses tricks to convince folks the demons in them have been driven out...because he believes they are simply delusional and that he can break the delusion without actually performing dangerous rituals on them.Do you see where this is going?  A film crew is going to follow him on one of his cynical exorcisms...in fact, his last one, because the film will expose him.  So he's drawn to a rundown farm house somewhere in Louisiana, where the Sweetzer family's teenage daughter Nell (Ashley Bell) seems to be possessed.  Her family is just her grief-stricken father, who after the death of his wife has withdrawn his children from the dangers of the world and her enormously creepy brother Caleb.The movie takes quite awhile building everything up, from introducing the characters to exposing all the little tricks Rev. Marcus uses in his fake exorcism.  At first, all seems to go just as Marcus expected, and Nell is cured.  But circumstance draws him back...and he is forced to reevaluate his dismissal of demon possession.  Lots of screaming, cutting, running, swearing and more screaming occur...all captured in jerky style by the ever-present camera.The ending of the film is more over-the-top than the events leading up to it earn.  And many in the theater were clearly disappointed by the abrupt conclusion...so be warned, this isn't a perfectly satisfying movie with a great dramatic arc and an artful resolution.  But while not quite as on-the-edge-of-your seat nerve-wracking as PARANORMAL ACTIVITY...the creepiness factor is quite high.This convincingly tense atmosphere is helped by better than usual performances for a low-budget movie of this ilk.  No performers are well known here (they can't be for such a filming style to work), but they are a cut above folks like the stars of PARANORMAL or OPEN WATER or BLAIR WITCH.  Fabian is quite commanding and convincing as a charlatan with good intentions.  He's our de facto guide through the turmoil, and he gives us just the right amount of oily insincerity mixed with genuine concern.  And when the you-know-what hits the fan, he finds reserves of bravery.  But just as compelling is Ashley Bell as the victim, Nell.  She is utterly convincing as a sweet, nave girl who has been homeschooled and sheltered for years.  There's a touching scene early on when she acquires the shoes from the sound engineer...it's simple but says a lot.  And later, when the you-know-what hits the fan...she can scream and slash and snarl with the best of them.  I would also point out Caleb Landry Jones as Caleb, Nell's brother...who has a mysterious agenda of his own.  In his first scene, he gives Marcus a smile that gave me goosebumps up my arm.THE LAST EXORCISM is not a classic like THE EXORCIST.  Likely, it will fade from memory in fairly short order.  But sitting there in the dark, packed theater, popcorn and Dr. Pepper at the ready...I had myself a very enjoyable 99 minutes of being creeped out.  If that sounds like fun to you...then I suspect you'll enjoy the film.",4,"Despite unsatisfying ending, there's plenty here to give you the creeps.",1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,5183,"['LAST',

1349080,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003L20IEW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 8]","The Last Exorcism (Daniel Stamm, 2010)Seventy-five minutes into the eighty-three minute The Last Exorcism, I was ready to pronounce it one of my favorite movies of 2010. It's the first of the handheld films I've seen that really gets the faux-documentary thing down; I hadn't realized how even the ""amateur"" movies in the genre like The Blair Witch Project had so many polished-and-professional things about them.And then came the last eight minutes, which [censored for Amazon consumption]. And I do realize that were I to mull this over for a few days and be a little more objective about it, as I normally do, I might not give it nearly as bad a rating as I am, because those first seventy-five minutes are really, really solid. But if anything, that makes me even madder about the final eight.Plot: Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian, currently appearing in the TV series Gigantic) is a preacher who's lost his faith in the evangelical church of his upbringing. Specifically, he's terrified of the abuse being carried out in the name of exorcisms, and because of this he agrees to allow a film crew to come along with him to film the final exorcism he will perform before retiring, to expose the charlatanism. He opens a letter at random and finds himself face-to-face with the case of Nell Sweetzer (The United States of Tara's Ashley Bell), a 16-year-old girl whose father, Louis (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's Louis Herthum), believes her to be possessed by the Devil himself (as he writes in the letter Cotton reads to us at the beginning of the film). Immediately upon the crew's arrival at the Sweetzer house, Nell's brother Caleb (The Social Network's Caleb Landry Jones) sets himself up as the antagonist, calling Cotton out at every juncture as a charlatan (not realizing, of course, that he's simply feeding into Cotton's attempt to expose the fraud of exorcism). As time goes on, however, Cotton begins to believe that maybe Nell actually is possessed by something.You will hear a lot of people grumbling about how awful this movie is, and you will hear that because it was marketed just like The Exorcism of Emily Rose, when in fact it has much more in common (for those first seventy-five minutes) with Emily Rose's German companion piece, Requiem. This is not a horror film in any traditional sense, and that's why the faux-documentary feel works so well for most of this movie; it actually plays out like a documentary. It is slow-paced, it seems to be showing you exactly what it originally stated it was going to set out to show you. Yes, they throw in a ""twist"" about an hour into the movie, but it's exactly the one you half-expect. It all works exactly as a faux-documentary should, and as none of them actually have so far. For those first seventy-five minutes, it is entirely possible to suspend your disbelief and feel like you're actually watching a documentary, and better yet a no-budget amateur documentary. Every aspect I've seen people complain about is not a weakness in this regard, it's a strength.But then they blow it when you are shown that the whole thing has been an elaborate shaggy-dog joke. (And let's not forget the final frame of the movie, which by default makes no sense; I can't reveal why without spoilers, but in order to get logically from ""here's the final frame of this movie"" to ""here's the product you're watching"", the producers would have had to do some Blair Witch-style faux-documentarizing in the marketing campaign, and to the best of my knowledge they never did.) All the sudden it goes from something that could have been a true indie gem to just another horror movie so incredibly stupid that you sit there for those last eight minutes counting up all the plot holes Stamm (A Necessary Death) and screenwriters Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland (Mail Order Wife) had to willfully ignore in order to shoehorn on that ending (and ""shoehorn"" is the proper word; it feels like an afterthought tacked on after lukewarm reviews from a focus group who, like most moviegoers who've panned it, seem to have been expecting a standard shock flick). You'll have a better time than you would watching the mess they make of the movie, anyway. Or you could exercise a modicum of willpower and simply turn the movie off after the scene in the diner, at which point you can judge it by what it should have been, rather than the mess it actually is. *",1,"So close, and yet so far.",1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,4397,"['Last', 'Exorcism', 'Daniel', 'Stamm', '2010', 'Seventy-five', 'minutes', 'eighty-three', 'minute', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'was', 'ready', 'pronounce', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', '2010', 'first', 'handheld', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'faux-documentary', 'thing', 'down', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'how', 'even', 'amateur', 'movies', 'genre', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'polished-and-professional', 'things', 'them.And', 'then', 'came', 'last', 'eight', 'minutes', '[', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'do', 'realize', 'were', 'mull', 'over', 'few', 'days', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'objective', 'normally', 'do', 'might', 'not', 'give', 'nearly', 'bad', 'rating', 'am', 'first', 'seventy-five', 'minutes', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'solid', 'anything', 'even', 'madder', 'final', 'eight.Plot', 'Cotton', 'Marcus', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'currently', 'appearing', 'TV', 'series', 'Gigantic', 'preacher', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'evangelical', 'church', 'upbringing', 'Specifically', 'terrified', 'abuse', 'being', 'carried', 'out', 'name', 'exorcisms', 'allow', 'film', 'crew', 'come', 'along', 'film', 'final', 'exorcism', 'will', 'perform', 'retiring', 'expose', 'charlatanism', 'letter', 'random', 'face-to-face', 'case', 'Nell', 'Sweetzer', 'United', 'States', 'Tara', 'Ashley', 'Bell', '16-year-old', 'girl', 'father', 'Louis', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'Louis', 'Herthum', 'be', 'possessed', 'Devil', 'letter', 'Cotton', 'beginning', 'film', 'Immediately', 'crew', 'arrival', 'Sweetzer', 'house', 'Nell', 'brother', 'Caleb', 'Social', 'Network', 'Caleb', 'Landry', 'Jones', 'up', 'antagonist', 'calling', 'Cotton', 'out', 'juncture', 'charlatan', 'not', 'realizing', 'course', 'simply', 'feeding', 'Cotton', 'attempt', 'expose', 'fraud', 'exorcism', 'time', 'however', 'Cotton', 'believe', 'maybe', 'Nell', 'actually', 'possessed', 'something.You', 'will', 'hear', 'lot', 'people', 'grumbling', 'how', 'awful', 'movie', 'will', 'hear', 'was', 'marketed', 'just', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'when', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'first', 'seventy-five', 'minutes', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'German', 'companion', 'piece', 'Requiem', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'traditional', 'sense', 'why', 'faux-documentary', 'feel', 'works', 'so', 'well', 'most', 'movie', 'actually', 'out', 'documentary', 'slow-paced', 'be', 'showing', 'exactly', 'what', 'originally', 'stated', 'was', 'going', 'set', 'out', 'show', 'Yes', 'throw', 'twist', 'hour', 'movie', 'exactly', 'one', 'half-expect', 'exactly', 'faux-documentary', 'should', 'none', 'actually', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'first', 'seventy-five', 'minutes', 'entirely', 'possible', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'feel', ""'re"", 'actually', 'watching', 'documentary', 'better', 'yet', 'no-budget', 'amateur', 'documentary', 'aspect', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'complain', 'not', 'weakness', 'regard', 'strength.But', 'then', 'blow', 'when', 'are', 'shown', 'whole', 'thing', 'been', 'elaborate', 'shaggy-dog', 'joke', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'final', 'frame', 'movie', 'default', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'why', 'spoilers', 'order', 'get', 'logically', 'here', 'final', 'frame', 'movie', 'here', 'product', ""'re"", 'watching', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'Blair', 'Witch-style', 'faux-documentarizing', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'best', 'knowledge', 'never', 'did', 'sudden', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'indie', 'gem', 'just', 'horror', 'movie', 'so', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'sit', 'last', 'eight', 'minutes', 'counting', 'up', 'plot', 'holes', 'Stamm', 'A', 'Necessary', 'Death', 'screenwriters', 'Huck', 'Botko', 'Andrew', 'Gurland', 'Mail', 'Order', 'Wife', 'had', 'willfully', 'ignore', 'order', 'shoehorn', 'ending', 'shoehorn', 'proper', 'word', 'afterthought', 'tacked', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'focus', 'group', 'who', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'panned', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'expecting', 'standard', 'shock', 'flick', ""'ll"", 'have', 'better', 'time', 'would', 'watching', 'mess', 'make', 'movie', 'anyway', 'could', 'exercise', 'modicum', 'willpower', 'simply', 'turn', 'movie', 'scene', 'diner', 'point', 'can', 'judge', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'mess', 'actually', '*']",N/A

First let me start by telling you that I loved over 90% of this movie. It wasn't what I expected at all! for your ""average"" horror movie the plot was complex and sophisticated. Reverend Cotton Marcus is a man of god who although doesn't believe in demons or hell, preaches the word of god into peoples lives. After his son is born premature and only survives thanks to a skilled doctor, Cotton slowly begins losing his faith after coming to the conclusion that God did not save his child but that a Doctor did. A few months later Cotton sees a news article about a little boy who is killed during an Exorcism having the life literally choked out of him in the process. Cotton is disgusted by this act and sets to expose (via a documentary) the fraudulence behind the whole concept of an Exorcism. Cotton proclaims he wont have another child die because someone mistakes a mental illness for a ""demon"".From this point everything is set into motion and the film delves into the Exorcism of farm girl Nell who you constantly find yourself asking, Is she really possessed of just crazy!?The movie has a few jumps but it is just so much more than your average horror flick. You find yourself anticipating what will happen next and are stunned every so often to see the plot thicken as more evidence begins to point to the fact that Nell might just be disturbed. I still could not get over how well put together this movie was...That was until the last 10 minutes.Just when you think you know everything you are presented with a ""twist"" ending. A twist ending that you would NEVER see coming, and quite frankly you NEVER would want to see coming! This psychological horror drama quickly turns itself into a B grade teenage horror movie in a matter of 10 minutes! The entire credibility of the past 85 minutes that you have just watched are just completely thrown out the window. Its not so much that the ending is ""Horrible"" but it is a complete let down considering the direction they decided to take it. Trust me, upon watching the movie you will understandThe Last Exorcism was a GREAT movie and I didn't understand why it had such negative press. This movie would have been one of my favorite horror movies if not for that piece of trash ending that it had. For that reason alone it lowered this movie from 5 stars to 3.75 (which I averaged to 4 on Amazon).I would definitely recommend renting this movie as you will enjoy yourself for the majority of it.

Did you see how he treats his own Bible by throwing it on the floor of the barn?I had expected a lot more more this movie after watching the overrated movie trailer. Protestant ""Reverend"" Cotton Marcus turns out to be just a showman, a con artist whose faith in Jesus had him doubting the existence of God to the point of him considering becoming a ""real estate"" salesman instead of a pastor. Like the modern roving ""ghost busters"" and ""psychic investigators"" with fancy gadgets, Protestant ""Reverend"" Cotton Marcus doesn't really believe in the existence of the evil one, dismisses pleas for help as nut cases, cons victims of their money (it's always about the money when it comes to these ""pastors""!), uses tricks (eg. sound recordings, etc.) to scam the victims' families - till he meets the possessed Nell (the lead actress in this movie). Is he and his crew in for a surprise when the gentle-looking girl turns freaky.This movie tries to mimic ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" which is a superior movie:(1) girl in white dress(2) the scene at the barn(3) back bending special effectsScenes are shot from the eyes of a camera man with a camera that can't remain still.Watching this movie could make you dizzy! Hold the camera steady, Mr. Director!This movie could also remind you a little of ""Blair Witch"" which is much scarier than this ""Last Exorcism"".Victims in this movie are the possessed girl and her father.The rest of the other characters are just a bunch of jokers who are unbelieverstrying to find themselves rather than helping the victim Nell.The ""Reverend"" got a change of heart in the end and confronted the being in the tower of flames. I'm sure you can guess how this movie ends: the film crew gets snuffed and evil wins again.I had hoped for a better ending or something based on a true story.I was disappointed.The marketing department must have spent a lot of time and effort in creating that movie trailer and nice poster, but the movie itself turns out to be disappointing.What a waste.....If you or anyone you know faces what the victim faces in this modern world, go consult a Traditional Catholic priest who knows more about these things.

While the trailer gives the impression that the movie will be entirely about a demon-possessed young lady on a rampage (I think there's a pretty famous movie like that out there already), it is equally about the final exploits of one of those hoaxy healing ministers who after years of performing (fake) exorcisms starts feeling guilty and decides to expose himself and the trade for what it is through a documentary.While the movie clocks in at under 90 minutes, it's still a little long and could have been done in a half hour episode ofTales from the Crypt. That format unfortunately is not available for filmmakers anymore (and certainly wouldn't have been as profitable). So little known Director Daniel Stamm found a cast of little known actors and created a full length feature that for the most part was pretty entertaining.The gist of the story is that this fraudulent healing minister shows up with his TV crew at a farmer's house who claims that his daughter is possessed. The healer aims to document and to disprove the idea of possession while at the same time going through the exorcism motions to simultaneously expose his whole racket. But our minister may have found not only his first real case of possession on this particular farm but also his faith.To all the critics of this movie, and there seems to be a lot of them....What were you expecting? AnExorcistremake? Go watch The Exorcist again. The Last Exorcism puts a pretty cool spin on a story of possession, and the B cast does an excellent job of leading the viewer through this creepy tale.

1349095,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B003L20IEW,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 3]","Reverend Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian) is a fraud.  For years he's enriched himself performing phony exorcisms on people, often people suffering from mental illnesses.  He's justified his deceptions to himself by thinking of it as performing a service that people want and that may, if they believe in it even though he doesn't, it may actually do some good, somehow.  But after hearing of an exorcism gone horribly wrong in which a young child dies, doubts begin to creep in on him.  And some time later, Cotton, feeling guilty and jaded, no longer believing in his justifications and not even sure if he believes in God anymore, decides to 'debunk' himself, going on one last exorcism and film the whole thing (starting with his whole relating of the above backstory to the camera), showing how he pulls off various 'magic tricks' and convinces people they're possessed; then go public with his footage.  Unfortunately for the Reverend and his camera operator, they encounter something on this final outing that Cotton's never seen before: a person who may actually Be possessed by a demon.At this point, the film successfully walks a fine line.  You don't see any phenomena like levitation or fire projection that pretty much seal the case as supernatural; you do see symptoms that the Reverend's seen before and can be explained away - violent contortions, apparantly having knowledge that the possessed would appear to have no way to have - but amped up to a level that's beyond what he's already seen.  The contortions are more severe and so twisted that they seemingly should be bone-breaking, the information the girl seems to have about the Reverend personally when she speaks in 'possessed' voice seems a lot more specfic than the knowledge the subjects usually have, and so on.  So at this stage the viewer is in the same place as the characters: events are leaning in the direction that this Could actually be a real possession, but it's not definitive yet.More complications arise - some possibly supernatural, others more earth-based but still disturbing.  I hesitate to say too much about some of the plot twists that happen when we get past the halfway point.  I'll just say that the film opens up multiple avenues of possibility to explain what's happening.  Some of these issues get resolved toward the end, but other questions arise at the same time.  The last five minutes is just incredibly freaky.  People who like a clear resolution at the ending of a movie may be disappointed, but those who like to be jolted and weirded out will find it hugely rewarding.  Ambitious, disturbing, and very well acted right across the board (with Patrick Fabian as Cotton and Ashley Bell - who plays the possessed girl - getting especially high marks), this is one of the high points in the genre of 'found footage' horror movies.",5,A Fraud Exorcist Encounters An Apparantly Genuine Possession - Truly Scary,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,2838,"['Reverend', 'Cotton', 'Marcus', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'fraud', 'years', 'enriched', 'performing', 'phony', 'exorcisms', 'people', 'often', 'people', 'suffering', 'mental', 'illnesses', 'justified', 'deceptions', 'thinking', 'performing', 'service', 'people', 'want', 'may', 'believe', 'even', ""n't"", 'may', 'actually', 'do', 'good', 'somehow', 'hearing', 'exorcism', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'young', 'child', 'dies', 'doubts', 'begin', 'creep', 'time', 'later', 'Cotton', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'jaded', 'no', 'longer', 'believing', 'justifications', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'God', 'anymore', 'decides', ""'debunk"", 'going', 'one', 'last', 'exorcism', 'film', 'whole', 'thing', 'starting', 'whole', 'relating', 'above', 'backstory', 'camera', 'showing', 'how', 'various', ""'magic"", 'tricks', 'convinces', 'people', ""'re"", 'possessed', 'then', 'go', 'public', 'footage', 'Unfortunately', 'Reverend', 'camera', 'operator', 'encounter', 'something', 'final', 'outing', 'Cotton', 'never', 'seen', 'person', 'who', 'may', 'actually', 'Be', 'possessed', 'demon.At', 'point', 'film', 'successfully', 'fine', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'phenomena', 'levitation', 'fire', 'projection', 'pretty', 'much', 'seal', 'case', 'supernatural', 'do', 'see', 'symptoms', 'Reverend', 'seen', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'away', 'violent', 'contortions', 'apparantly', 'having', 'knowledge', 'possessed', 'would', 'appear', 'have', 'way', 'have', 'amped', 'up', 'level', 'what', 'already', 'seen', 'contortions', 'are', 'more', 'severe', 'so', 'twisted', 'seemingly', 'should', 'be', 'bone-breaking', 'information', 'girl', 'have', 'Reverend', 'personally', 'when', ""'possessed"", 'voice', 'lot', 'more', 'specfic', 'knowledge', 'subjects', 'usually', 'have', 'so', 'So', 'stage', 'viewer', 'same', 'place', 'characters', 'events', 'are', 'leaning', 'direction', 'Could', 'actually', 'be', 'real', 'possession', 'not', 'definitive', 'yet.More', 'complications', 'arise', 'possibly', 'supernatural', 'others', 'more', 'earth-based', 'still', 'disturbing', 'hesitate', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'happen', 'when', 'get', 'halfway', 'point', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'film', 'up', 'multiple', 'avenues', 'possibility', 'explain', 'what', 'happening', 'issues', 'get', 'resolved', 'end', 'other', 'questions', 'arise', 'same', 'time', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'just', 'incredibly', 'freaky', 'People', 'who', 'clear', 'resolution', 'ending', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'who', 'like', 'be', 'jolted', 'weirded', 'out', 'will', 'find', 'hugely', 'rewarding', 'Ambitious', 'disturbing', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'right', 'board', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'Cotton', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'who', 'possessed', 'girl', 'getting', 'especially', 'high', 'marks', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'genre', ""'found"", 'footage', 'horror', 'movies']",N/A

Those false documentaries of horrible events sometimes make for great viewing entertainment, plus it gives a creepy realistic feeling. The movie starts off slowly but steadily and we get to know the characters and the important aspects that set the tone for The Last Exorcism. Reverend Cotton Marcus receives a letter from Louis Sweetzer urges the reverend to come to his farm and perform an exorcism on his daughter whom he believes is possessed by the devil. The reverend doesn't believe in exorcism as far as we know, and even though he performed some himself he says that often those who claim to be possessed really aren't, it's all in their heads. Cotton has some issues with his beliefs which make it all more interesting. As you can expect Cotton and his crew are in for a surprise when they arrive the Sweetzer's farm. The reverend meets Louis `daughter Nell, at first she's a very normal and charming girl and doesn't show aspects that would make you believe she's possessed.Patrick Fabian does a good acting job as the reverend and for the most part the acting in the movie was good, no problems there. The movie itself is nothing that's really new but the topic is interesting enough to warrant making a new movie on it. There isn't anything that's really terrifying about The Last Exorcism; I wasn't scared like I expected to be so if you're expecting to be scared you probably shouldn't. The big problem with film however, is the ending. Whatever decency the movie actually had was thrown out the window in the last few minutes of the movie. I read comments prior to watching The Last Exorcism that criticized the ending; I must now agree with them say they're right. Anyone who says else is lying. The ending totally ruins TLE, almost to the point where it's simply not worth watching anymore. I wanted to see the movie despite what I read of it and I don't regret watching it because after all, it's what I wanted but its near impossible to explain how the final minutes ruined the movie without giving important stuff away. I don't understand why they ended the film like this, what were they thinking? Besides the ending the movie was ok, it wasn't amazing neither was it awful, at least it was interesting. I wanted to like The Last Exorcism a lot more but it's a mediocre exorcism film. I'm not sure I would believe the ""Last Exorcism"" thing, last or final is a relative word in the world of entertainment and many countless horror series has used such titles only to later return. I'm sure there will be more movies on Exorcism in the future but for now the original 1976 movie remains the best of its kind. 2/5 stars for this one.",2,The Ending Ruins It,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2786,"['Last', 'Exorcism', 'one', 'latest', 'faux-documentary', 'movies', 'la', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'style', 'more', 'recently', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'false', 'documentaries', 'horrible', 'events', 'sometimes', 'make', 'great', 'viewing', 'entertainment', 'creepy', 'realistic', 'feeling', 'movie', 'slowly', 'steadily', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'important', 'aspects', 'set', 'tone', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'Reverend', 'Cotton', 'Marcus', 'letter', 'Louis', 'Sweetzer', 'reverend', 'come', 'farm', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'daughter', 'whom', 'possessed', 'devil', 'reverend', ""n't"", 'believe', 'exorcism', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'even', 'performed', 'often', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'possessed', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'heads', 'Cotton', 'issues', 'beliefs', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'can', 'expect', 'Cotton', 'crew', 'are', 'surprise', 'when', 'arrive', 'Sweetzer', 'farm', 'reverend', 'meets', 'Louis', 'daughter', 'Nell', 'first', 'very', 'normal', 'charming', 'girl', ""n't"", 'show', 'aspects', 'would', 'make', 'believe', 'possessed.Patrick', 'Fabian', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'reverend', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'problems', 'there', 'movie', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'topic', 'interesting', 'enough', 'warrant', 'making', 'new', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anything', 'really', 'terrifying', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'was', ""n't"", 'scared', 'expected', 'be', 'so', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'be', 'scared', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'big', 'problem', 'film', 'however', 'ending', 'decency', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'was', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'read', 'comments', 'prior', 'watching', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'criticized', 'ending', 'must', 'now', 'agree', 'say', ""'re"", 'right', 'Anyone', 'who', 'else', 'lying', 'ending', 'totally', 'TLE', 'almost', 'point', 'where', 'simply', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'anymore', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'what', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'what', 'wanted', 'near', 'impossible', 'explain', 'how', 'final', 'minutes', 'ruined', 'movie', 'giving', 'important', 'stuff', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'ended', 'film', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'ok', 'was', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'was', 'awful', 'least', 'was', 'interesting', 'wanted', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'lot', 'more', 'mediocre', 'exorcism', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'believe', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'thing', 'last', 'final', 'relative', 'word', 'world', 'entertainment', 'many', 'countless', 'horror', 'series', 'used', 'such', 'titles', 'only', 'later', 'return', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'movies', 'Exorcism', 'future', 'now', 'original', '1976', 'movie', 'best', 'kind', '2/5', 'stars', 'one']",N/A

It begins with a preacher talking to two other people as they begin to film him and his ministry in action, and the preacher being filmed is doing it because he wants to expose something. In some ways he seems to want to help and in others he seems to want to get away with some rigging and purely devious stuff. From the beginning of it you could see what the man was going to do, and that ""doing"" amounted to him really pulling the wool over some true believer's eyes. The problem with a scam like that is the notion of running into something terrible and what that terrible might do.If only the movie would have stuck with that.While The Last Exorcism would have made a great B-movie, the hype behind this thing really threw me for a loop. I liked the way the characters were designed and I liked the idea of what was going on, but I really didn't get some things. The preacher, for example, was a fake. He had told us that and he even mocked the people he was supposed to help because they thought their could be a way out. Then the preacher begins to stay and, well, i wondered why that would happen now. Even worse, I wondered why the preacher would do what he did at the end (no spilers), and why the people would go along with him.There were a lot of things like this playing through the storyline, and the acting was subpar. I really think the notions hurt the people as they tried to give it their all and that seemed like it was caused by the shortsightedness of others.

Marcus has agreed to let a documentary crew to film him so he can debunk exorcisms. He uses props to make his ""audience"" believe he has cured them. His latest case puzzles him as none of his techniques work and he is afraid that the possession of Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) may be the real deal.Fabian gives an excellent performance as Marcus and the documentary style of the film adds a sense of believability to the film. Actress Ashley Bell (who does all of her own contortions without the aid of any special effects)also brings added credibility to the film.

Edwards,"[1, 6]","The first 97% of the movie was all right, but when they wrapped it up real quick at the end with ""a satanic cult did it all"" that ruined it for me. I imagine that real and true demonic possession occurs more often than ""satanic cults"" do.

1349116,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,B003L20IEW,Zoe Paris,"[3, 12]","This movie is a trainwreck! It starts out as a ""reality"" style documentary about a phony preacher who basically cons people into believing and handing over their money. The movie is filmed partially like ""Blair Witch Project"" with the shaky camera and other parts are filmed like a somewhat normal movie. This makes for a really annoying combination. One minute it seems like a student film, the next it has eerie music like a real movie. The same goes for the acting, parts of it seem natural and parts of it seem like acting.The Blair Witch Project was cool because it seemed real when people saw it for the first time. This movie on the other hand, doesn't seem real. It was almost like someone had a partial script and decided to just make it ""reality"" style and fill in the blanks with pointless dialogue. The plot is a mishmash of various unoriginal ideas. It moves too slow, it's too predictable and it isn't scary. I am glad I didn't pay full price to see this. I probably would not watch it again.
