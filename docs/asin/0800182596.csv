Something like that.  Well, Errol Morris uses four men's biographies here, all waving at us and jagged and interwoven, so the viewer is pretty perplexed by four moving points as well.

Ultimately, however, the film makes broad and deep connections between these very different endeavors.Fast, Cheap and Out of Control is often reviewed -- and marketed -- as an examination of eccentrics.

Dave Hoover (a lion tamer), George Mendona (a topiary gardener), Ray Mendez (a mole-rate expert), and Rodney Brooks (a robot scientist), are oddballs so driven by their respective passions that they totally tune out the world around them.Taken separately, each man is, himself, an interesting story. Hoover is barbarous to his beautiful lions but totally devoted to them as well. He is like a husband who beats his wife in the belief she will love him the more for it. Mendona is a charming relic, Brooks a cyber-dweeb. By far the strangest among them is Mendez, the mole-rat afficionado. He delights in engineering an environment most suitable for their naked, twitching bodies. He animatedly describes how they, as the only mammals without sweatglands, use the odor of their feces as a species signature. One guesses that, if he could, he'd like nothing more than to crawl inside those plastic tubes with his beloved mole-rats.It is a puzzling documentary to watch; I was constantly trying to figure out the commonality Morris wanted me to see. What is the thread that can be sewn through all their lives? They all work in fields involving animals. A couple of them work in dying professions, while a couple others see mankind as the breed on its way out. Ultimately, the only commonality I found amongst them was their uncompromising commitment to live on the fringes of society and their total disinterest in the rest of us.Morris, though, is clearly at the top of his game. From seeing The Thin Blue Line, we trust that Morris knows how to tell a story. Here, he explores the technical side of his craft in a rather cut-and-loose fashion. Working with cinematographer Robert Richardson, Morris utilizes numerous film resolutions to create a singularly impressionistic collage of images. He splices black and white footage with different film formats to create a jagged and eerie mood that is pervasive throughout the film. The music by Caleb Sampson at times enhances the awe we feel in observing these unique men, and provokes wonder.

It is a documentary but it interweaves four different stories with some old ""B"" movie clips, scenes from the circus, and a few other odds and ends.  In the hands of a less talented director than Errol Morris this could be a cluttered mish mash of confusion.  However, with a brilliant display of film editing, we find ourselves engrossed with four individuals talking about their craft.  What engrosses us is the way we get just enough information in each segment to make us want more.  Thus, when we discover that naked mole rats are a unique animal, we suddenly switch to a lion-tamer discuss one of the lessons he learned the hard way.  As we want more from the lion-tamer, we switch to the hedge sculptor who tells how long it took him to create a large giraffe.  As we consider how this could help us with our own back yard hedges, we switch to a man tell us about how robots relate to one another.  With segments just long enough to whet our appetite and just short enough to leave us wanting more, ""Fast, Cheap and Out of Control"" entertains us from beginning to end.I was unsure why the scenes were inter-spersed with the old  adventure movie clips.  I got the impression that this was to imply that these four men were sharing their own adventures with us.  I'm not sure it worked all that well but I don't think it worked all that bad.  It helped to keep us wondering what was coming next.  Oddly, the weak link for me was the man who built robots.

166265,AFYLH06U69HKY,0800182596,"R. G. Villalobos ""Luminarrative""","[4, 6]","Fast, Cheap & Out of Control is a thoughtfully composed look at the work of four men and how their lives are poured into what they do.  In the beginning, the audience would be hard pressed to imagine how these men and what they do could have anything to do with one another.  We start seeing the passion that directs them and the discipline that maintains them.  Each man begins speaking, in specific terms, about his interests and how those interests relate to what he does professionally.It didn't take long before the editing delicately overlapped imagery and narration.  As this happened, the connections between seemingly unrelated words and images surfaced and began dominating my experience of this film.  As the men examined their own respective roles in society, much of what they say of themselves can be said of us all.  Their stories become one.  The big story is the story of life on Earth right now.I would also like to make special mention of the soundtrack.  The music really straddles the line between playful and haunting.  It seems to drive the film in a lot of ways and perfectly frames the subjects and their work.The men that are the subject of this documentary are endearing characters that aren't selling us anything.  They only want to share with us some aspect of the world that has captured them.  I saw this film in the theater and was unprepared; I was moved.  This piece is not for everyone.  Maybe I'm just easily inspired, maybe this is solid gold.  If I'm easily inspired then good for me, if this is solid gold then you really ought to watch it.",5,Inspired,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,1579,"['Fast', 'Cheap', 'Out', 'Control', 'thoughtfully', 'composed', 'look', 'work', 'four', 'men', 'how', 'lives', 'are', 'poured', 'what', 'do', 'beginning', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'imagine', 'how', 'men', 'what', 'do', 'could', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'one', 'start', 'seeing', 'passion', 'discipline', 'man', 'speaking', 'specific', 'terms', 'interests', 'how', 'interests', 'relate', 'what', 'professionally.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'editing', 'delicately', 'overlapped', 'imagery', 'narration', 'happened', 'connections', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'words', 'images', 'surfaced', 'began', 'dominating', 'experience', 'film', 'men', 'examined', 'own', 'respective', 'roles', 'society', 'much', 'what', 'say', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'stories', 'become', 'one', 'big', 'story', 'story', 'life', 'Earth', 'right', 'now.I', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'make', 'special', 'mention', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'really', 'line', 'playful', 'haunting', 'drive', 'film', 'lot', 'ways', 'perfectly', 'subjects', 'work.The', 'men', 'are', 'subject', 'documentary', 'are', 'endearing', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'selling', 'anything', 'only', 'want', 'share', 'aspect', 'world', 'captured', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'was', 'unprepared', 'was', 'moved', 'piece', 'not', 'everyone', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'easily', 'inspired', 'maybe', 'solid', 'gold', ""'m"", 'easily', 'inspired', 'then', 'good', 'solid', 'gold', 'then', 'really', 'ought', 'watch']",N/A
166266,A16QODENBJVUI1,0800182596,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","Acclaimed documentarian Errol Morris in this film juxtaposes four men who in reality have little in common with one another, but who through editing are used to bring out superficial commonalities between their very different projects and used as inadvertent (on their part, not Morris's) commentators on the others.  Let me make something clear:  Errol Morris is, in my opinion, the finest film documentarian of his generation.  But more than in some of his other films, his juxtaposition of these four men creates a narrative that might not otherwise be there.  This is reinforced by the fact that it isn't at all clear what that narrative is.  If you look at a wide spectrum of reviews either here on Amazon or on the Internet, you will not find a lot of agreement about what this film is about.The four people selected for this documentary - Robot Scientist Rodney Brooks, Wild Animal Trainer Dave Hoover, Topiary Gardener George Mendona, and and Mole-Rat Specialist Ray Mendez - really have very little in common with one another, except perhaps that they work on the fringe, on the interface with The Other.  Brooks creates robots that are completely other than human, Hoover dominates and controls nonhuman animals for circuses, Mendona forces plants to appear to be something other than what they are, and Mendez deals with a social world that has little in common with humans.  By editing Morris is able to make it seem as if the various individuals have more in common, that their separate obsessions, have more in common than they in fact they do.  British moralist Rev. Joseph Butler famously stated that everything is what it is and not another thing, but in the hands of Morris that is not necessarily the case.The only person in the group that I knew much about before watching the film was Rodney Brooks.  In fact, one reason that I decided to watch the film is that I'm currently reading his FLESH AND MACHINES: HOW ROBOTS WILL CHANGE US.  Brooks actually gives the film its title.  In supposing that he had been given the task of exploring another world by robot, he indicated that instead of building one big robot, he would build hundreds of smaller ones.  The risk to the mission if one failed would be enormous, but the redundancy built into a horde of robots would minimize the risk.  His approach would be, he says, to build robots that are ""Cheap, fast, and out of control.""  There is a lot of really weird stuff rumored about Brooks on the Internet and frankly I'm doubtful that a tenth of it is true.  Reading his book I can attest that he is far from one of the more extreme writers about human-robot interaction.  He is light years away from a genuine nutcase like Ray Kurzweil, for instance.  I'm not sure why we feel the need to make people stranger than they are.  Brooks strikes me as eccentric but hardly a mad scientist.In short, I think this is a highly dishonest film.  I've not felt that after watching Morris's other films.  In FOG OF WAR, about Robert McNamara, what the latter said was so stunning that there was no need to create a narrative.  Morris need only get the heck out of the way.  But here through creative editing the words of the four subjects end up telling a tale that none of the participants intended.At the same time, I do recommend the film.  Yes, I'm saying that people ought to see a film that is inherent dishonest.  Why?  Because it is brilliantly made.  One of the most brilliant films ever made was Reinfenstahl's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL, a film filled with one outrageous untruth after another, from the first moment when Hitler's plan descends from the heavens to the masses below, to the brilliant photography throughout that portrays Hitler and his cohorts as gods come to earth.  Now, Morris's film isn't even remotely that dishonest nor is his intent evil or immoral.  He merely is guilty of imposing a narrative on his subjects that their words alone do not generate.  But his skill in doing so is extraordinary.  Like with his other films this is beautifully photographed, brilliantly edited, and wonderfully scored.  Morris brings aesthetic beauty to his films to a degree unmatched by any other documentarian.  There is one moment after another when as a viewer I was simply enthralled.  He is a wonderfully illusionist.  It was only afterwards, upon reflection, that I was forced to acknowledge that the story he was telling wasn't true, that in fact it wasn't even a story told by the film's participants.  I don't agree with Plato, but it should be recalled that his main charge against poets is that they are liars.

The gardener is another creator, sculpting menageries from living plants. The lion tamer is likewise intent on understanding and shaping the living beings with which he interacts.
