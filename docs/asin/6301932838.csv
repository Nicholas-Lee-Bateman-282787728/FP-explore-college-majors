Hanks, even early in his career is good, but it is obvious that at this point he still can't pick up the best scripts available, Candy was funny in just about everything he did and his role in this movie is very funny.This is one of those old movies that isn't by any means great, hardly a 5 star movie, but if you enjoy Hanks, it is worth seeing everything he did and as for Candy, his part in his movie is short, but you will laugh at what he does.

273418,A1CYOHNGQ1WED1,6301932838,Christopher Hivner,"[3, 5]","""Volunteers"" was a comedy that has some laughs but should have had more considering the talent involved. Tom Hanks, John Candy, Rita Wilson, and Tim Thomerson star and do their best with the material. Hanks plays a rich Yale graduate who is in trouble with gambling debts. When his father refuses to pay, he escapes by getting on a Peace Corp plane. Wilson and Candy play people who actually volunteered for the Peace Corp and Thomerson is the government representative in Thailand. The movie's biggest problem is too many plotlines and not enough time to work them all out properly. But John Candy is funny as he always is as ""Tom Tuttle from Tacoma"" and Thomerson turns out to be CIA and nuts (his knife is named Mike and he holds conversations with it). The volunteers build a bridge that it turns out is wanted by the US government, the communists and a local drug lord. John Candy gets brainwashed by the commies, Rita and Tom fall in love and eventually the bridge gets blown up.Volunteers isn't a great movie, but it has some laughs and is better the second time you watch it.",3,John Candy is always funny,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,1083,"['Volunteers', 'was', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'considering', 'talent', 'involved', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'John', 'Candy', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Tim', 'Thomerson', 'star', 'do', 'best', 'material', 'Hanks', 'rich', 'Yale', 'graduate', 'who', 'trouble', 'gambling', 'debts', 'When', 'father', 'pay', 'getting', 'Peace', 'Corp', 'plane', 'Wilson', 'Candy', 'play', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'volunteered', 'Peace', 'Corp', 'Thomerson', 'government', 'representative', 'Thailand', 'movie', 'biggest', 'problem', 'too', 'many', 'plotlines', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'properly', 'John', 'Candy', 'funny', 'always', 'Tom', 'Tuttle', 'Tacoma', 'Thomerson', 'out', 'be', 'CIA', 'nuts', 'knife', 'named', 'Mike', 'conversations', 'volunteers', 'build', 'bridge', 'out', 'wanted', 'US', 'government', 'communists', 'local', 'drug', 'lord', 'John', 'Candy', 'brainwashed', 'commies', 'Rita', 'Tom', 'fall', 'love', 'eventually', 'bridge', 'blown', 'up.Volunteers', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'laughs', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'watch']",Volunteers VHS

Both play wacky charicatures - Hanks as a snooty Connecticut socialite in the wrong place, Candy a naive simpleton with two left feet - and that extra dash of color ultimately saves the picture from sliding into the deepest dregs. Though the plot revolves around the construction of a massive wooden bridge to benefit the natives, we spend most of the picture watching Hanks's Kennedy wannabe struggle to emerge from his loathsome, self-absorbed shell, largely inspired by the unrequited affections of fellow missionary Rita Wilson. The pair would actually spark a lifelong romance during filming (they're still together today, bucking the Hollywood norm) but the on-set chemistry doesn't translate to anything special on the screen.

273424,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,6301932838,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[39, 39]","Back in 1984, Tom Hanks was on a roll.  After making it big on the small screen in the popular comedy, Bosom Buddies, and making an even bigger &quot;Splash&quot; in the 1983 film directed by Ron Howard, Hanks started gaining prominance as an actor.  His next film, 1984s Bachelor Party, brought his persona to a much different audience which did not stop the film from becoming a success.  1985s Volunteers, however, would be a different story.  Although this film is about Ivy Leager, Lawrence Bourne III (Hanks) who joins the Peace Corp to get out of a gambling dept, it is not for a huge audience.  However, there are a couple of important reasons to own it.1.  This was the 2nd and final teaming of Hanks with fellow &quot;Splash&quot; costar, John Candy, who's performance in this film as the goodnatured Tom Tuttle can be hard not to laugh at (the brainwashing scene is a killer).2.  Volunteers is the movie where Hanks met his wife, Rita Wilson, who costars with him as Beth Wexler.  It's just a lot of fun to watch the chemestry between these two and also quite touching since they are still together today.  One of my favorite scenes is when Beth is unsuccessfully trying to get the natives to move a log, so Lawrence tells her to repeat something he says in their language, and after she does, the natives scurry the log away.  &quot;What did I just say?&quot;, she asks him.  He replies, &quot;Move this log and I'll sleep with each one of you&quot;.  A silly but intimate exchange between the two of them.This DVD is not bad as far as price is concerned and it's even shown in the Widescreen Format (1.85:1), but you may not know that since the back of the case is a bit unclear (the only indication is &quot;Aspect 16:9&quot;, which some people may not understand).  Even the original theatrical trailer is here in Widescreen.  Plus you even get some nice Cast &amp; Crew Bios.So if you really enjoy Tom Hanks and/or John Candy, check this film out.&quot;It's not that I can't help these people, it's just that...I don't want to&quot;.-Tom Hanks as Lawrence Bourne III",4,&quot;Move This Log And I'll Sleep With Each One Of You&quot;.,994809600,"07 11, 2001",2001,2082,"['Back', '1984', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'roll', 'making', 'big', 'small', 'screen', 'popular', 'comedy', 'Bosom', 'Buddies', 'making', 'even', 'bigger', 'quot', 'Splash', 'quot', '1983', 'film', 'directed', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Hanks', 'started', 'gaining', 'prominance', 'actor', 'next', 'film', '1984s', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'brought', 'persona', 'much', 'different', 'audience', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'film', 'becoming', 'success', '1985s', 'Volunteers', 'however', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'story', 'film', 'Ivy', 'Leager', 'Lawrence', 'Bourne', 'III', 'Hanks', 'who', 'Peace', 'Corp', 'get', 'gambling', 'dept', 'not', 'huge', 'audience', 'However', 'are', 'couple', 'important', 'reasons', 'own', 'it.1', 'was', '2nd', 'final', 'teaming', 'Hanks', 'fellow', 'quot', 'Splash', 'quot', 'costar', 'John', 'Candy', 'who', 'performance', 'film', 'goodnatured', 'Tom', 'Tuttle', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'not', 'laugh', 'brainwashing', 'scene', 'killer', '.2', 'Volunteers', 'movie', 'where', 'Hanks', 'met', 'wife', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'who', 'Beth', 'Wexler', 'just', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'chemestry', 'two', 'also', 'quite', 'touching', 'are', 'still', 'together', 'today', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'when', 'Beth', 'unsuccessfully', 'trying', 'get', 'natives', 'move', 'log', 'so', 'Lawrence', 'repeat', 'something', 'language', 'natives', 'scurry', 'log', 'away', 'quot', 'What', 'did', 'just', 'say', 'quot', 'quot', 'Move', 'log', ""'ll"", 'sleep', 'one', 'quot', 'silly', 'intimate', 'exchange', 'two', 'them.This', 'DVD', 'not', 'bad', 'as', 'far', 'price', 'concerned', 'even', 'shown', 'Widescreen', 'Format', '1.85:1', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'back', 'case', 'bit', 'unclear', 'only', 'indication', 'quot', 'Aspect', '16:9', 'quot', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'Even', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'here', 'Widescreen', 'even', 'get', 'nice', 'Cast', 'amp', 'Crew', 'Bios.So', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'and/or', 'John', 'Candy', 'check', 'film', 'out.', 'quot', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'quot', '.-Tom', 'Hanks', 'Lawrence', 'Bourne', 'III']",Volunteers VHS
