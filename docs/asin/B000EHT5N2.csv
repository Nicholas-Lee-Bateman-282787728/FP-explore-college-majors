Murray ""javierw""","[3, 4]","I watched Sex is Zero again last night and remember how good it was,with all the awful comedies coming out of Hollywood right now, this isa breath of fresh air. I remember the first thing I heard from thismovie was that it was the Korea's American Pie, but for my taste Sexis Zero is much better. You get all gags a sex comedy should have plusmore. If you are a fan of Asian Cinema you know they like to throwdramatic twists even in comedies and Sex is Zero is not the exception.For example, let's say the do an Action comedy in Hong Kong like RushHour, near the end one of the 2 main characters is going to die, thatthrows a punch to the viewer out of nowhere, some people hate that andothers like me love it, enough of Hollywood endings. Not that I'msaying anybody dies in this movie, this one is a Sex Comedy, not andAction movie.Ha Ji Won plays the lead female character, she is a sweetheart, beforewatching this I saw her in a Horror movie called Nightmare, she is myfavorite Korean actress, last movie I saw her in is Duelist, youshould look for that movie too, is one of the best pieces ofcinematography I've ever seen.Im Chang Jung plays the lead male character and he does a great job,the guy is really funny and also shows he can act when he has to.I got both the Korean DVD and the US DVD, both are great, but I gotthe US DVD because the extra material comes also with subtitles, onething that the Korean release doesn't have, plus it also has a veryentertaining commentary track by mrskin, he had a lot to comment sincethey didn't went shy on the nudity factor. Hope they keep releasingKorean movies with this quality in the US.So don't wait until Sex is Zero is remake by some money hungry studio,do yourself a favor and watch it now, you wont be disappointed.",5,Finally a great Sex Comedy!,1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,1773,"['watched', 'Sex', 'Zero', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'remember', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'awful', 'comedies', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'right', 'now', 'isa', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'remember', 'first', 'thing', 'heard', 'thismovie', 'was', 'was', 'Korea', 'American', 'Pie', 'taste', 'Sexis', 'Zero', 'much', 'better', 'get', 'gags', 'sex', 'comedy', 'should', 'have', 'plusmore', 'are', 'fan', 'Asian', 'Cinema', 'know', 'throwdramatic', 'twists', 'even', 'comedies', 'Sex', 'Zero', 'not', 'exception.For', 'example', 'let', 'say', 'do', 'Action', 'comedy', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'RushHour', 'end', 'one', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'going', 'die', 'punch', 'viewer', 'nowhere', 'people', 'hate', 'andothers', 'love', 'enough', 'Hollywood', 'endings', 'Not', ""I'msaying"", 'anybody', 'movie', 'one', 'Sex', 'Comedy', 'not', 'andAction', 'movie.Ha', 'Ji', 'Won', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'sweetheart', 'beforewatching', 'saw', 'Horror', 'movie', 'called', 'Nightmare', 'myfavorite', 'Korean', 'actress', 'last', 'movie', 'saw', 'Duelist', 'youshould', 'look', 'movie', 'too', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'ofcinematography', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Im', 'Chang', 'Jung', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'great', 'job', 'guy', 'really', 'funny', 'also', 'can', 'act', 'when', 'to.I', 'got', 'Korean', 'DVD', 'US', 'DVD', 'are', 'great', 'gotthe', 'DVD', 'extra', 'material', 'also', 'subtitles', 'onething', 'Korean', 'release', ""n't"", 'have', 'also', 'veryentertaining', 'commentary', 'track', 'mrskin', 'had', 'lot', 'comment', 'sincethey', 'did', ""n't"", 'went', 'shy', 'nudity', 'factor', 'Hope', 'keep', 'releasingKorean', 'movies', 'quality', 'US.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Sex', 'Zero', 'remake', 'money', 'hungry', 'studio', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'now', 'wont', 'be', 'disappointed']",Sex Is Zero
973873,AT9BKXNH1DL00,B000EHT5N2,Conan I. Whalen Mckain,"[0, 0]","This is brasher than American Pie by quite a ways.  It makes no apologies for offending you and likely will offend you in some way.  The kicker is that it does show the aftermath of easy sex and in a fairly human way.  Lim Chang-jung plays perhaps the single most addled brain person I have ever seen.  The mere fact that the character got into college is nearly beyond the suspension of disbelief. He then runs around treating himself like a loony toons cartoon character who will not die despite his lack of a single wit of common sense.To reveal almost anything is to spoil the humor.  Several friends and I were watching this and loudly laugh and asking each other if we had seen that right.The movie does shift to consequences.  The humor is still present but it does not shy away from the results of bad decisions.Definitely, worth seeing once.",4,Hardcore Sex Comedy,1349308800,"10 4, 2012",2012,850,"['brasher', 'American', 'Pie', 'quite', 'ways', 'apologies', 'offending', 'likely', 'will', 'offend', 'way', 'kicker', 'show', 'aftermath', 'easy', 'sex', 'fairly', 'human', 'way', 'Lim', 'Chang-jung', 'perhaps', 'single', 'most', 'addled', 'brain', 'person', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'mere', 'fact', 'character', 'got', 'college', 'nearly', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'then', 'treating', 'loony', 'toons', 'cartoon', 'character', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'die', 'lack', 'single', 'wit', 'common', 'sense.To', 'reveal', 'almost', 'anything', 'spoil', 'humor', 'Several', 'friends', 'were', 'watching', 'loudly', 'laugh', 'asking', 'other', 'had', 'seen', 'right.The', 'movie', 'shift', 'consequences', 'humor', 'still', 'present', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'results', 'bad', 'decisions.Definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once']",Sex Is Zero
973874,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000EHT5N2,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 6]","I grew up watching teen films like Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's, and those are two reference points of partying, raunchy teen flicks.  American Pie throw in male bodily fluids in the formula.  Now, from South Korea, comes Saekjeuk Shigong, which combines elements of those movies, and it's quite enjoyable.One can see the influence of Fast Times from the opening sequence using the Go-Go's ""We Got The Beat,"" albeit in an abbreviated version; it features a host of hotties doing an aerobics workout, while the first year college students are undergoing a gnarly initation ceremony.One of them is inept Jang Eun-shik, recently having finished his military service, who's often at the receiving end of an accident that lands him in the hospital or leads him to jump out of windows.  He's also in Songgchuk's martial arts club involved in spiritual concentration, which amounts to basically bashing each other on the heads with phony wooden sticks or doing silly stuff like doing a headstand in a bowl of water.  His three roommates are the goofy Changsu, an unnamed nerdy bushy-haired guy--these two seem to do nothing but watch porn on their computer--and a sissy boy, Taehak, who's not too athletic.  When he sees a mouse, what does he do like a girl? Yup, you guessed it!As for male bodily fluids, there's a funny one involving said fluid, some rat poison, a sandwich, and Eun-shik accidentally eating it.  That leads to a hilarious chase scene where his roommates try to catch him so he can spit it out.Eun-shik falls head over heels with Lee Eun-hyo, a willowy beauty who's an aerobics star and sub on the national team.  When he casually tries to steal looks at her, she twigs on, and suddenly, spreads and opens her legs quickly, causing him to spit rice.  Her girlfriends are a funny lot, too, including the short-haired Kyoungiu, self-conscious about her breasts who is told, ""if someone put two raisins on your back, no one would know the deifference between your chest and your back--but eager to score.  After a night at a club, Eun-hyo's friends end up with each of Eun-shik's roommates, with hilarious results.  For a grossout scene, one of them who has drunken a lot makes some really horrendous barfing noises, spewing Linda Blair-like at one point, then gives bushy-hair a sloppy barf-laden kiss.  Charming, huh?  Poor Kyoungiu ends up with the unassertive Taehak with hilarious results.There's the aerobics prima donna, a pretty but stuck-up girl named Ji-Won, who's dating the hunk Han Sangwook; there are some steamy scenes between them.  Things heat up when Sangwook dumps her in favour of Eun-hyo.  However, he's quite a cad and when he gets Eun-hyo pregnant, leaves her high and dry, kind of like Mike Damone and Stacy Hamilton in Ridgemont High.  While the topic was superficially done in RH, Eun-Hyo angrily tells Han when he seems casual about it, ""You and I both have birthdays, but this baby is never going to have one!  It's just waiting to die!""  It veers into drama at this point, when Eun-shik nurses Eun-hyo, trying to cheer her up with his exercise routines.  Although a goofball, he proves to be actually very caring and devoted, with Bread's ""If"" used as the love theme in this scene.Then there are two thieves, one with a Moe Howard-like haircut, who end up trying to hard to avoid discovery and end up becoming voyeurs, playing uno, and I DON'T mean the card game.Yes, the intense drama part is quite a change from the earlier silly raunchiness, but it's a comedy with some heart in it, saved by the aerobics competition set to some snazzy techno music, really well choreographed.  And yes, the two thieves are right there doing that crazy hand jive at one point.  Heck, all the hot actresses in there are enough to make anyone do that!",5,Korea's answer to Fast Times and American Pie,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,3784,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'teen', 'films', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Porky', 'are', 'two', 'reference', 'points', 'partying', 'raunchy', 'teen', 'flicks', 'American', 'Pie', 'throw', 'male', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'formula', 'Now', 'South', 'Korea', 'Saekjeuk', 'Shigong', 'elements', 'movies', 'quite', 'enjoyable.One', 'can', 'see', 'influence', 'Fast', 'Times', 'opening', 'sequence', 'using', 'Go-Go', 'Got', 'Beat', 'albeit', 'abbreviated', 'version', 'host', 'hotties', 'doing', 'aerobics', 'workout', 'first', 'year', 'college', 'students', 'are', 'undergoing', 'gnarly', 'initation', 'ceremony.One', 'inept', 'Jang', 'Eun-shik', 'recently', 'having', 'finished', 'military', 'service', 'who', 'often', 'receiving', 'end', 'accident', 'hospital', 'jump', 'windows', 'also', 'Songgchuk', 'martial', 'arts', 'club', 'involved', 'spiritual', 'concentration', 'basically', 'bashing', 'other', 'heads', 'phony', 'wooden', 'sticks', 'doing', 'silly', 'stuff', 'doing', 'headstand', 'bowl', 'water', 'three', 'roommates', 'are', 'goofy', 'Changsu', 'unnamed', 'nerdy', 'bushy-haired', 'guy', 'two', 'seem', 'do', 'nothing', 'watch', 'porn', 'computer', 'sissy', 'boy', 'Taehak', 'who', 'not', 'too', 'athletic', 'When', 'mouse', 'what', 'do', 'girl', 'Yup', 'guessed', 'male', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'funny', 'one', 'involving', 'said', 'fluid', 'rat', 'poison', 'sandwich', 'Eun-shik', 'accidentally', 'eating', 'hilarious', 'chase', 'scene', 'where', 'roommates', 'try', 'catch', 'so', 'can', 'spit', 'out.Eun-shik', 'falls', 'head', 'heels', 'Lee', 'Eun-hyo', 'willowy', 'beauty', 'who', 'aerobics', 'star', 'sub', 'national', 'team', 'When', 'casually', 'steal', 'looks', 'twigs', 'suddenly', 'spreads', 'legs', 'quickly', 'causing', 'spit', 'rice', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'funny', 'lot', 'too', 'including', 'short-haired', 'Kyoungiu', 'self-conscious', 'breasts', 'who', 'told', 'someone', 'put', 'two', 'raisins', 'back', 'one', 'would', 'know', 'deifference', 'chest', 'back', 'eager', 'score', 'night', 'club', 'Eun-hyo', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'Eun-shik', 'roommates', 'hilarious', 'results', 'grossout', 'scene', 'one', 'who', 'drunken', 'lot', 'really', 'horrendous', 'barfing', 'noises', 'spewing', 'Linda', 'Blair-like', 'one', 'point', 'then', 'bushy-hair', 'sloppy', 'barf-laden', 'kiss', 'Charming', 'huh', 'Poor', 'Kyoungiu', 'up', 'unassertive', 'Taehak', 'hilarious', 'aerobics', 'prima', 'donna', 'pretty', 'stuck-up', 'girl', 'named', 'Ji-Won', 'who', 'dating', 'hunk', 'Han', 'Sangwook', 'are', 'steamy', 'scenes', 'Things', 'heat', 'up', 'when', 'Sangwook', 'favour', 'Eun-hyo', 'However', 'quite', 'cad', 'when', 'Eun-hyo', 'pregnant', 'high', 'dry', 'kind', 'Mike', 'Damone', 'Stacy', 'Hamilton', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'topic', 'was', 'superficially', 'done', 'RH', 'Eun-Hyo', 'angrily', 'Han', 'when', 'casual', 'have', 'birthdays', 'baby', 'never', 'going', 'have', 'one', 'just', 'waiting', 'die', 'drama', 'point', 'when', 'Eun-shik', 'nurses', 'Eun-hyo', 'trying', 'cheer', 'up', 'exercise', 'routines', 'goofball', 'be', 'actually', 'very', 'caring', 'devoted', 'Bread', 'used', 'love', 'theme', 'scene.Then', 'are', 'two', 'thieves', 'one', 'Moe', 'Howard-like', 'haircut', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'trying', 'hard', 'avoid', 'discovery', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'voyeurs', 'playing', 'uno', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'mean', 'card', 'game.Yes', 'intense', 'drama', 'part', 'quite', 'change', 'earlier', 'silly', 'raunchiness', 'comedy', 'heart', 'saved', 'aerobics', 'competition', 'set', 'snazzy', 'techno', 'music', 'really', 'well', 'choreographed', 'yes', 'two', 'thieves', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'doing', 'crazy', 'hand', 'jive', 'one', 'point', 'Heck', 'hot', 'actresses', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'anyone', 'do']",Sex Is Zero
