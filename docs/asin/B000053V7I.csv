565261,AO4Z70I4WWMUZ,B000053V7I,A. B. Weaver,"[0, 0]",I'm a fan of weird movies with cruel or unusual characters. I loved Cruel Intentions because I know people like those characters. The same can be said for this movie. I know people that remind me of the characers so I like the movie. It is an interesting movie overall because the story the movie is based on is easily related to high school. Don't bash this movie because it's &quot;another teen&quot; movie. Check it out because the story relates to everyone.,4,An interesting movie,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",2001,461,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'weird', 'movies', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'characters', 'loved', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'know', 'people', 'characters', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'know', 'people', 'remind', 'characers', 'so', 'like', 'movie', 'interesting', 'movie', 'overall', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'easily', 'related', 'high', 'school', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bash', 'movie', 'quot', 'teen', 'quot', 'movie', 'Check', 'out', 'story', 'everyone']",Crime + Punishment in Suburbia
565262,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B000053V7I,Crazy Jim,"[1, 2]","Rob Schmidt's modern day take on Dostoyevsky is a promising film that is so drowned in glossy imagery and bleak characters that it never seems to generate the type of interest in story-telling that it should. Monica Keena is the beautiful head cheerleader who seems to have the perfect life but in reality is trapped in a suburban nightmare. Vincent Kartheiser (&quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot;) is the token bright but misunderstood outcast who lusts for Keena but can't find a way to her heart. When she murders her abusive stepfather with the help of her jock boyfriend, the evidence ends up pointing to her mother. This leads to a cycle of events that never seem to be captured with the level of drama or intesity that you'd expect. &quot;Crime + Punishment&quot; is as dark and devoid of energy as Larry Clark's &quot;Kids&quot; or Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requeim For A Dream&quot; but it doesn't stand out the way they did. There are some solid perfomances from Keena and the always-dependable Michael Ironside as her drunken stepdad but none of the characters ever seem to stand out. While the story bares a passing resemblance to &quot;American Beauty&quot; in some areas, Schmidt never seems to move past his love for visual flare and give us any type of intriguing character moments. Keena's closing narrative makes for a good way to end the film but it seems like a case of &quot;too little, too late&quot; in my opinion.",2,&quot;Crime + Punishment&quot; DVD Review,1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,1436,"['Rob', 'Schmidt', 'modern', 'day', 'take', 'Dostoyevsky', 'promising', 'film', 'so', 'drowned', 'glossy', 'imagery', 'bleak', 'characters', 'never', 'generate', 'type', 'interest', 'story-telling', 'should', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'beautiful', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'have', 'perfect', 'life', 'reality', 'trapped', 'suburban', 'nightmare', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'quot', 'Day', 'Paradise', 'quot', 'token', 'bright', 'misunderstood', 'outcast', 'who', 'Keena', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'heart', 'When', 'abusive', 'stepfather', 'help', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'evidence', 'up', 'pointing', 'mother', 'cycle', 'events', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'captured', 'level', 'drama', 'intesity', ""'d"", 'expect', 'quot', 'Crime', '+', 'Punishment', 'quot', 'dark', 'devoid', 'energy', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'quot', 'Kids', 'quot', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'quot', 'Requeim', 'A', 'Dream', 'quot', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'way', 'did', 'are', 'solid', 'perfomances', 'Keena', 'always-dependable', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'drunken', 'stepdad', 'none', 'characters', 'ever', 'seem', 'stand', 'out', 'story', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'areas', 'Schmidt', 'never', 'move', 'love', 'visual', 'flare', 'give', 'type', 'intriguing', 'character', 'moments', 'Keena', 'closing', 'narrative', 'good', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'case', 'quot', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'quot', 'opinion']",Crime + Punishment in Suburbia

I expected more of a _gee lets get naked and show our lusty teen bodies then kill people and listen to MTV friendly music!_ kind of film but that's not quite what I got. Instead I got a rather pleasant viewing experience, Monica Keena, an actress I had never seen, nor heard of before watching this movie, really got to me with this weighted eyes and a crying in the shower scene that looked to be straight out of Leaving Las Vegas. Also this film had the dumb jock boyfriend but a new take on the dumb jock boyfriend that most teen movies seem to have. The dumb jock boyfriend was more or less pretty sensitive, he loved Keena's character enough to kill for her. And of course, this movie featured your typical teen film, freaky, dressed in black, messed up haricutted (yeah double negative, so what?) outsider kid, with, yes, a camera. This all jumbled together some how made a nice film that I enjoyed a lot.I give this film a 4 because I had a big problem believing that Rosanna (Keena) wouldn't have just let her mother go to jail. Her mother, played by Ellen Barkin, left with her new boyfriend and left poor Rosanna alone in a house with an obviously abusive, alcoholic, stepfather that was clearly disturbed. Then she calls and gets the guy all set off, leading to the eventual... well, watch the movie and find out what the little call from mom did to help out Rosanna's day. If it were me I would have let mom go to jail and I would have gotten away with the perfect crime.

The plot follows a teenage girl who is tormented by her family situation, and she commits a rather brutal crime and she eventually can't live with whats happened as a result of it, and she gives in.  That's a rather generic plot outline, but I don't like giving away plot-lines in my review.  I think a general outline should suffice.  Rob Schmidt, the director, has decided to let his presence be known at every place he can, from the ridiculous chapter slides at the beginning of each section of the film, to the style of the film itself.  It is so self-consciously arty, its like he can't let the story simply unfold.  The voiceovers from the angelic faced stalker are the most troubling aspect, I hate voiceovers in general, but these are the most pretentious ones I have heard in a long time.  Note to future filmmakers: NO PHILOSOPHY IN VOICEOVERS.  The reason I give it three stars, is basically because of the acting.  Monica Keena gives a very convincing performance, and shows that talent lurks underneath the very enticing exterior.  Michael Ironside gives an outstanding performance as the abusive father, his spontaneous explosions of fury are very convincing.  Ellen Barkin and others all flourish in supporting roles.  This movie could have been great, very very easily.  The story was there, but the Director had to become an artist at the expense of the film, which I think will turn a lot of people off.",3,"A solid cast and story, destroyed by the pretentious styling",982195200,"02 15, 2001",2001,1549,"['movie', 'example', 'how', 'badly', 'interesting', 'solid', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'squandered', 'due', 'directors', 'ridiculous', 'excesses', 'plot', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'tormented', 'family', 'situation', 'rather', 'brutal', 'crime', 'eventually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'whats', 'happened', 'result', 'rather', 'generic', 'plot', 'outline', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'giving', 'away', 'plot-lines', 'review', 'think', 'general', 'outline', 'should', 'suffice', 'Rob', 'Schmidt', 'director', 'decided', 'let', 'presence', 'be', 'known', 'place', 'can', 'ridiculous', 'chapter', 'slides', 'beginning', 'section', 'film', 'style', 'film', 'so', 'self-consciously', 'arty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'story', 'simply', 'unfold', 'voiceovers', 'angelic', 'faced', 'stalker', 'are', 'most', 'troubling', 'aspect', 'hate', 'voiceovers', 'general', 'are', 'most', 'pretentious', 'ones', 'have', 'heard', 'long', 'time', 'Note', 'future', 'filmmakers', 'PHILOSOPHY', 'IN', 'VOICEOVERS', 'reason', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'basically', 'acting', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'talent', 'very', 'enticing', 'exterior', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'abusive', 'father', 'spontaneous', 'explosions', 'fury', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'others', 'flourish', 'supporting', 'roles', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'very', 'very', 'easily', 'story', 'was', 'there', 'Director', 'had', 'become', 'artist', 'expense', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'turn', 'lot', 'people']",Crime + Punishment in Suburbia

565268,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000053V7I,Jeffrey Leach,"[14, 15]","Like other people who have seen this film, I must admit that I rented it once and then bought a copy immediately afterwards. Supposedly based on Dostoyevsky's novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; with a modern, suburban American setting, this film from director Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn) is an enormously entertaining look at the plight of alienated youth. I know, I know; the idea of &quot;alienated youth&quot; is so ridiculous and so overdone these days that just referring to the phrase ought to elicit snorts of derision from the viewing public. What elevates &quot;Crime + Punishment in Suburbia&quot; above the usual fare in this genre is the great cast, how Schmidt organizes his film, and the grand soundtrack. Of course, the gorgeous Monica Keena in the lead role of Roseanne Skolnik certainly made my heart thump a few times. Yes, this movie is a teen drama, but it appeals even to an old fogy like me. There are a few flaws, especially the extremely loose association made with Dostoyevsky's novel, but they are few in number overall.Roseanne Skolnik, on the surface, seems to have everything a young bubblehead could want in this world. She is beautiful, lives in a huge house, is extremely popular in school, and even dates a star member of the football team. Behind the face she presents to the public, however, Roseanne aches inside. Her alcoholic salesman stepfather, played with incredible range by the versatile Michael Ironsides, torments Roseanne and her mother every chance he gets. Skolnik's mother Maggie (Ellen Barkin) can barely contain her increasing sense of frustration as she attempts to navigate around her drunken husband. We learn about Roseanne's tortured private life through the eyes of social misfit Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser), a Goth type guy who has a major crush on Roseanne. Vincent follows her around wherever she goes taking dozens of photographs of his love, and he quickly realizes she is a fellow sufferer in desperate need of assistance.Vincent stands back for the most part, though, because he recognizes that he must wait for Roseanne to freefall before he can help. Skolnik's destruction isn't long in coming after her stepfather commits an appalling act and Roseanne enlists the assistance of her boyfriend Jimmy (James DeBello) in order to seek bloody revenge against her tormentor. Horrible crimes, however justified they may be, often lead to unforeseen circumstances. This is exactly what happens when the police pin a murder charge on Maggie Skolnik, a prime suspect in the death of patriarch Skolnik because she had left her husband for another man shortly before the crime took place. Roseanne must confront her guilt and soon finds herself gravitating to the soothing influence of Vincent in order to assuage her conscience. A terrible choice must be made, and ultimately is, and the conclusion of the film deals with the aftermath of Roseanne's actions.I simply adored the cast of this film. Monica Keena, who deserves as many accolades as possible, plays Roseanne quite well. It is interesting to see her physically change as the public humiliation caused by several family incidents turns her into a social pariah. Vincent Kartheiser plays his role a little too smoothly perhaps, as it is difficult to imagine a teenager having his life this together, but he also gets you to root for his character and hope that this odd looking kid wins over Roseanne in the end. Ellen Barkin really needs no description; she is always good in any role no matter how major or minor. Is it just me or is Barkin one of those women who get better looking the older they get? The real standout performance in &quot;Crime + Punishment in Suburbia&quot; is Michael Ironsides as the rapidly disintegrating Fred Skolnik. We usually see this actor playing the heavy in movies like &quot;Scanners&quot; and &quot;Total Recall,&quot; but here he plays a different type of bad guy, one who Schmidt invests with enough contradictions to make the viewer sort of feel for the man. What he does to Roseanne is obviously beyond the pale, but the problems he faces in life and the difficulties he has with his wife should invoke some sympathy on the part of the audience. It helps that Ironsides possesses the chops to pull the role off. The only character I disliked was James DeBello's turn as the thickheaded Jimmy.&quot;Crime + Punishment in Suburbia&quot; is a visually interesting film, centered as it is on several noticeable book like chapter breaks. There could have been less MTV style editing, a technique I think has been done to death over the past few years, although even I have to admit it works well here. A few scenes left me scratching my head, such as the  &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; type football pep rally; perhaps subsequent viewings will allow me to decipher what the significance of scenes like this mean. Fortunately, most difficulties in the film disappear due to the excellent characters and marvelous soundtrack. The DVD version of the movie offers a commentary with director Rob Schmidt and Michael Ironsides (no Monica Keena, regrettably) and both widescreen and fullscreen picture transfers. A final note: ignore the over the top box cover and just watch the movie. If you like fine performances, you will enjoy this movie.",5,A great cast and soundtrack equals a great movie,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,5292,"['other', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film',

I am so glad I was wrong.While Dostoyevsky made his point with words, Rob Schmidt did the same with the films imagery which truly was both narcotic and haunting. He would make you feel as if you were in some drug induced dream/nightmare. You felt as if you were trapped between Heaven and Hell, happiness and sorrow, love and loss.As the story progresses you watch the ghosts of Rosanne (Monica Keena) slowly absorb her. She goes from this glowing image of beauty to a shadow of a human being. It's stark and disturbing. While Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser) the seemingly gloomy one, who loves her from the begining of the film is the sole voice of reason, hope, and beauty in her slowly cascading world of tragedies.The film epitomizes the continious hopelessness that many today feel but refuse to acknowledge. Although, I think what the film does best is that it shows us these sadnesses while reinforcing us with the concepts that we can make anything happen if we want to badly enough.

She's  the head cheerleader who dates a popular football player named Jimmy (James DeBello).  Her family lives in a huge mansion in the wealthy part of town. However Roseann lives a far darker existence that comes complete with a drunk step dad who is verbally abusive to his wife.  Fred (Michael Ironside) is a bitter drunk whose only satisfaction in life comes from making his wife Maggie (Ellen Barkin) feel miserable. He tortures her every night at the dinner table while a helpless Roseann watches.  Maggie wishes he would die and dreams of escaping Fred for good. Outside Roseann's window hides a creepy voyeur named Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser) who snaps roll after roll of film documenting his crush's unhappiness. Vincent longs to be her white knight and when the time is right he plans on rescuing Roseann. At her breaking point Maggie begins an affair with a young man named Chris (Jeffrey Wright) who she meets one night at a club. She sets off a horrible chain of events that begins with rape and ends in a murder that lands Maggie on Death Row. Her entire family is affected by her choices and their lives will be altered forever. The film does a very good job of showing the horrors that take place behind closed doors of seemingly perfect, affluent families. The actors really excel at making these characters believable and sympathetic. Ironside, a veteran of many horror/sci-fi films, is certainly creepy, but his Fred is  a man desperate to connect with his stepdaughter. He clearly loves her and her mother but he doesn't know how to express it. Barkin, in a very reserved performance, is heartbreaking as the long suffering wife who saw her chance for escape and took it and who pays the ultimate price. DeBello, a familiar face in many a teen film, is his usual obnoxious and rude self but he actually turns in one of his best performances. He is an extremely supportive, and protective boyfriend to Roseann who is willing to do anything to keep her safe from harm. Unfortunately he's  easily manipulated by her and he pays the price for it. My  favorite performance is that of Kartheiser. He's  terrific as the  oddball outsider who shows up to school wearing garlands of garlic to ward off evil spirits. All the teens think they can label him a weirdo and pay him no attention but he is very perceptive of their plight and is the only one offering them any solutions. It's a well made film that raises good points and makes everyone responsible for their actions.",3,Solid acting highlights this intelligent drama,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,2587,"['outside', 'world', 'Roseann', 'Skolnick', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'typical', 'privileged', 'teen', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'popular', 'football', 'player', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'James', 'DeBello', 'family', 'huge', 'mansion', 'wealthy', 'part', 'town', 'However', 'Roseann', 'far', 'darker', 'existence', 'complete', 'drunk', 'step', 'dad', 'who', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'wife', 'Fred', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'bitter', 'drunk', 'only', 'satisfaction', 'life', 'making', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'feel', 'miserable', 'night', 'dinner', 'table', 'helpless', 'Roseann', 'watches', 'Maggie', 'would', 'die', 'dreams', 'escaping', 'Fred', 'good', 'Roseann', 'window', 'creepy', 'voyeur', 'named', 'Vincent', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'who', 'snaps', 'roll', 'roll', 'film', 'documenting', 'crush', 'unhappiness', 'Vincent', 'longs', 'be', 'white', 'knight', 'when', 'time', 'right', 'rescuing', 'Roseann', 'breaking', 'point', 'Maggie', 'affair', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Chris', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'who', 'one', 'night', 'club', 'horrible', 'chain', 'events', 'rape', 'murder', 'Maggie', 'Death', 'Row', 'entire', 'family', 'affected', 'choices', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'altered', 'forever', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'horrors', 'take', 'place', 'closed', 'doors', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'affluent', 'families', 'actors', 'really', 'excel', 'making', 'characters', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'Ironside', 'veteran', 'many', 'horror/sci-fi', 'films', 'certainly', 'creepy', 'Fred', 'man', 'desperate', 'connect', 'stepdaughter', 'clearly', 'mother', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'express', 'Barkin', 'very', 'reserved', 'performance', 'heartbreaking', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'who', 'saw', 'chance', 'escape', 'took', 'who', 'ultimate', 'price', 'DeBello', 'familiar', 'face', 'many', 'teen', 'film', 'usual', 'obnoxious', 'rude', 'self', 'actually', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'extremely', 'supportive', 'protective', 'boyfriend', 'Roseann', 'who', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'keep', 'safe', 'harm', 'Unfortunately', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'price', 'My', 'favorite', 'performance', 'Kartheiser', 'terrific', 'oddball', 'outsider', 'who', 'up', 'school', 'wearing', 'garlands', 'garlic', 'ward', 'off', 'evil', 'spirits', 'teens', 'think', 'can', 'label', 'weirdo', 'pay', 'attention', 'very', 'perceptive', 'plight', 'only', 'one', 'offering', 'solutions', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'good', 'points', 'everyone', 'responsible', 'actions']",Crime + Punishment in Suburbia
