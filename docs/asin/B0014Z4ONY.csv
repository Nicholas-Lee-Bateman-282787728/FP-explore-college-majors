I watch a lot of anime, but had not seen this particular anime series before watching the film adaptation.  Going into it blindly may have been for the better.The film is a little long, and I understand that it does cut out quite a bit of content that the manga and the anime contained... but that is a sacrifice many manga and anime adaptations must make.  The story involves five friends in University.  They are a mix of art and design students that have interesting personalities.  I found the characters very likable in their own way.The story does revolve around the whole 'boy likes girl' and 'girl likes boy' themes, but it still manages to bring some new life into this tried and true film formula.  There is a bit of light comedy, mostly in the first half of the film.  The second half is a bit more dramatic, but all the ends tie up well.I really do enjoy Japanese film, and one of the delights of modern Japanese film is getting a feel for the country and lifestyle.  Though these could be University students anywhere, the settings do have a good Japanese feel.I would definitely recommend this film for those who enjoy pretty straightforward, yet enjoyable young adult films.  Though I am a few years past this age, I still had a nostalgic feeling.I understand that if you read the manga or saw the anime first, you might be let down by the loss of a lot of content... but if you are a newbie to Honey and Clover, as I was, prepare for a very good film experience.",4,"Love, heartbreak, perseverance, and truth ~",1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,1560,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'anything', 'fantastic', 'due', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'film', 'watch', 'lot', 'anime', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'particular', 'anime', 'series', 'watching', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Going', 'blindly', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better.The', 'film', 'little', 'long', 'understand', 'cut', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'content', 'manga', 'anime', 'contained', 'sacrifice', 'many', 'manga', 'anime', 'adaptations', 'must', 'make', 'story', 'five', 'friends', 'University', 'are', 'mix', 'art', 'design', 'students', 'have', 'interesting', 'personalities', 'found', 'characters', 'very', 'likable', 'own', 'way.The', 'story', 'revolve', 'whole', 'likes', 'girl', 'likes', 'boy', 'themes', 'still', 'bring', 'new', 'life', 'tried', 'true', 'film', 'formula', 'bit', 'light', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'more', 'dramatic', 'ends', 'tie', 'up', 'well.I', 'really', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Japanese', 'film', 'one', 'delights', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'film', 'getting', 'feel', 'country', 'lifestyle', 'could', 'be', 'University', 'students', 'anywhere', 'settings', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'Japanese', 'feel.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'enjoy', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'yet', 'enjoyable', 'young', 'adult', 'films', 'am', 'few', 'years', 'age', 'still', 'had', 'nostalgic', 'feeling.I', 'understand', 'read', 'manga', 'saw', 'anime', 'first', 'might', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'loss', 'lot', 'content', 'are', 'newbie', 'Honey', 'Clover', 'was', 'prepare', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'experience']",Honey and Clover

1147681,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B0014Z4ONY,RavenRing,"[3, 3]","Takemoto is a struggling student at an art college, with no goals or ambitions. One day he sees a girl painting and it is love at first sight (on his part). Unluckily for him, his friend Morita also falls in love with her, and unluckily for both of them, Hagumi is totally oblivious to both of their affections. A story of the crazy antics of art and love, and the purity of art and love.I got this film because I enjoyed the Honey & Clover manga, so I already knew the characters and story. I've watched several live action adaptions of various anime/manga series, and this one was one of the better adaptions I've seen. As with all live action adaptions, this one tries to cram to much into too little, but even someone who is unfamiliar with Honey & Clover could catch on quickly. Yes, they will miss those tiny details and obscure references, but it won't take away from their overall viewing experience. I watched this with several friends and my sisters. The friends hadn't seen/read Honey & Clover, the sisters had. Everyone enjoyed it and thought it was a cute film, but one friend (a guy no less! and not an anime fan), really liked it. No one thought it was confusing, or incomplete. It actually wraps up the story pretty well while leaving room for a sequel (not that they will do one).The actors fit their roles quite well. It is always hard to take an anime/manga character, with their weird hair, huge eyes, and extreme hight differences (Hagumi is really short), and have them come to life in real people. I still vastly prefer the anime versions of the characters, but I came to accept their live action counterparts during the course of the movie. Other than the characters, there are no other elements in Honey & Clover that have trouble translating to live action. It was nice to see the college and dorms made real.Overall, this is a good movie for fans of Honey & Clover, and people who had never heard of it, good for anime fans, and people who don't care about anime. It costs a little more than I would like to pay for a movie, but it isn't wildly exorbitant. I think it is a good rental movie, fun with friends or family.
