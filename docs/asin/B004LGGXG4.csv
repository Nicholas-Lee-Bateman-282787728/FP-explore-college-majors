On the positive, the production values are quite high.  You will not be annoyed by the image quality, sound or other production issues.  Where it lacks painfully is in any coherent plot; completely non-existent.  Also, the film attempts a few dramatic scenes of emotions that just fails pathetically.  However, if you can overlook those things, just sit back and enjoy a few kinda cool low-intensity battle scenes and Billy Zane.

The loss of Tom Berenger from the series is evident; his presence sorely missed.Still, newcomer Chad Michael Collins was decent as the son of Gunny Beckett. Again, not producing a performance of note - but not completely dropping the ball either. But 'eh' isn't exactly a quality one looks for when they're screening for leading men. Hopefully he works on his craft. I like the cut of his jib - perhaps he has a shot at something better. Maybe.Opens as Marine buck sergeant Brandon Beckett is deployed with his unit as part of a UN peacekeeping mission to the African Congo. Assigned the role of protectors, they're ordered to cull all remaining civilians out of a rebel infested area. Despite repeated attempts, there's one hold out. The mixed platoon of marines and local government forces is given the mission of getting that stubborn man into the safe zone. Tragically, only two out of the dozen men of that mission will escape with their lives. Ambushed upon their arrival, they're killed by a single sniper of superior skill. The only survivor from the marine element, and just barely, Sgt. Beckett.He's rescued by a local hunting guide who discovered the massacre. Despite what honor tells the sergeant, to help the hunter who saved his life, his responsibility lies with his orders and seeing to safety the daughter of the murdered victim.Once his charge is safely delivered out of the combat zone, he files his after-action report expecting something to be done. Not just for payback, but to prevent further deaths against peacekeeper forces. But to his shock and dismay, the blood-soaked intelligence is essentially round-filed and he's dismissed. Stunned, he realizes that the bureaucracy will move too slowly, if at all. And despite the dangers to his person and career, goes against direct orders. He's going AWOL, determined to hunt down the shooter who murdered his fellow marines and nearly sent him to the pearly gates. But not before a mysterious friend steps in to advise and counsel the brash young warrior.Was never a fan of Billy Zane. There's something about his efforts that, for some reason, has always rang false for me. Which is odd, since, I think he's a decent actor.So I'm very pleased to say that I thought he did exceedingly well in his return to the franchise. Better than I could've or would've hoped for given my previous statement. The years seems to have given him a tempered humility and grounded humanity that I always felt he lacked. Having avoided him for the past decade or so, I'm now going to reinvestigate the man and his works. I'm intrigued with the remote possibility that he might have actually found a way to extract a performance without being completely asinine and phoney.Overall, a decent flick made watchable by Zane's surprisingly excellent performance. A decent addition to the series. And for fans of snipers/sniping - an okay addition to the genre.Movie Note:- Would willingly pay extra for any military-inspired film to have at least one veteran as an advisor. The small details are the ones that sometimes irritate the most. The very last scene, which should have been a 'yahoo' moment, turned sour as a Navy Commander introduces himself as an Army Major. C'mon!There has got to be thousands of vets who would *volunteer* to assist filmmakers for no pay. Three hots and a cot for a week or two - and these flagrant mistakes can be so easily addressed.One can only hope.",3,Billy Zane's Surprising Excellence,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,3493,"['things', 'considered', 'low-budget', 'action', 'flick', 'not', 'bad', 'loss', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'series', 'evident', 'presence', 'sorely', 'missed.Still', 'newcomer', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Collins', 'was', 'decent', 'son', 'Gunny', 'Beckett', 'Again', 'not', 'producing', 'performance', 'note', 'not', 'completely', 'dropping', 'ball', 'either', ""'eh"", ""n't"", 'exactly', 'quality', 'one', 'when', ""'re"", 'screening', 'leading', 'men', 'Hopefully', 'craft', 'like', 'cut', 'jib', 'perhaps', 'shot', 'something', 'better', 'Maybe.Opens', 'Marine', 'buck', 'sergeant', 'Brandon', 'Beckett', 'deployed', 'unit', 'part', 'UN', 'peacekeeping', 'mission', 'African', 'Congo', 'Assigned', 'role', 'protectors', ""'re"", 'ordered', 'cull', 'remaining', 'civilians', 'rebel', 'infested', 'area', 'repeated', 'attempts', 'one', 'hold', 'out', 'mixed', 'platoon', 'marines', 'local', 'government', 'forces', 'given', 'mission', 'getting', 'stubborn', 'man', 'safe', 'zone', 'Tragically', 'only', 'two', 'dozen', 'men', 'mission', 'will', 'escape', 'lives', 'Ambushed', 'arrival', ""'re"", 'killed', 'single', 'sniper', 'superior', 'skill', 'only', 'survivor', 'marine', 'element', 'just', 'barely', 'Sgt', 'Beckett.He', 'rescued', 'local', 'hunting', 'guide', 'who', 'discovered', 'massacre', 'what', 'honor', 'sergeant', 'help', 'hunter', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'responsibility', 'orders', 'seeing', 'safety', 'daughter', 'murdered', 'victim.Once', 'charge', 'safely', 'delivered', 'combat', 'zone', 'after-action', 'report', 'expecting', 'something', 'be', 'done', 'Not', 'just', 'payback', 'prevent', 'further', 'deaths', 'peacekeeper', 'forces', 'shock', 'dismay', 'blood-soaked', 'intelligence', 'essentially', 'round-filed', 'dismissed', 'Stunned', 'bureaucracy', 'will', 'move', 'too', 'slowly', 'dangers', 'person', 'career', 'direct', 'orders', 'going', 'AWOL', 'determined', 'hunt', 'down', 'shooter', 'who', 'murdered', 'fellow', 'marines', 'nearly', 'sent', 'pearly', 'gates', 'not', 'mysterious', 'friend', 'steps', 'advise', 'counsel', 'brash', 'young', 'warrior.Was', 'never', 'fan', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'something', 'efforts', 'reason', 'always', 'rang', 'false', 'Which', 'odd', 'think', 'decent', 'actor.So', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'say', 'thought', 'did', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'return', 'franchise', 'Better', 'could', ""'ve"", 'would', ""'ve"", 'hoped', 'given', 'previous', 'statement', 'years', 'have', 'given', 'tempered', 'humility', 'grounded', 'humanity', 'always', 'felt', 'lacked', 'Having', 'avoided', 'past', 'decade', 'so', ""'m"", 'now', 'going', 'reinvestigate', 'man', 'works', ""'m"", 'intrigued', 'remote', 'possibility', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'found', 'way', 'extract', 'performance', 'being', 'completely', 'asinine', 'phoney.Overall', 'decent', 'flick', 'made', 'watchable', 'Zane', 'surprisingly', 'excellent', 'performance', 'decent', 'addition', 'series', 'fans', 'snipers/sniping', 'okay', 'addition', 'genre.Movie', 'Note', 'Would', 'willingly', 'pay', 'extra', 'military-inspired', 'film', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'veteran', 'advisor', 'small', 'details', 'are', 'ones', 'sometimes', 'irritate', 'most', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', ""'yahoo"", 'moment', 'turned', 'sour', 'Navy', 'Commander', 'Army', 'Major', ""C'mon"", 'got', 'be', 'thousands', 'vets', 'who', 'would', '*volunteer*', 'assist', 'filmmakers', 'pay', 'Three', 'hots', 'cot', 'week', 'two', 'flagrant', 'mistakes', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'easily', 'addressed.One', 'can', 'only', 'hope']",Sniper: Reloaded

Co-starring rising star Chad Michael Collins as Brandon Beckett, along with action stalwart Richard Sammel (Casino Royale, Inglourious Basterds), SNIPER: RELOADED offers next generation thrills and a kill-or-be-killed intensity Sniper fans won't want to miss.While working with the UN Forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Marine Sgt. Brandon Beckett (Chad Michael Collins), son of renowned sniper Thomas Beckett, receives orders to rescue a European farmer trapped in the middle of hostile rebel territory. When he and his men arrive at the farm, a mysterious sniper ambushes them, wounding Beckett and killing everyone else. With the help of his father's former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, sniper instructor Richard Miller (Billy Zane), Beckett must learn to think like a sniper to track down the assassin before the sniper returns to finish the job.What I Can Tell You: I have never seen Sniper from 1993 starring Tom Berenger but my husband had. He originally thought this was that movie until we sat down to watch and he wondered were Billy Zane was. Billy doesn't show up until almost 40 minutes in.Ok, so here is what I know. Berenger played a Marine sniper Thomas Beckett. In this movie Chad Michael Collins plays Brandon Beckett, the son of Thomas Beckett who is following in his fathers foot steps although there was some obvious ""daddy anger issues"" and he is not yet a sniper. (added note: Check out Chad Michael's blog for an interesting diary of the making of this movie.)Brandon's troop was ambushed while on a peacekeeping mission by a sniper and he is left as the only survivor. While they prepare for their next mission of finding the sniper assassin. Billy Zane's Character, Richard Miller, who was trained by Thomas Beckett back in the day, returns to aid Brandon on learning how to be a sniper. Brandon is not interested until Richard suddenly appears in Congo much to Brandon's chagrin.I am not at all familiar with Chad Michael Collins but his face looked very familiar. Maybe that is because he looks like Berenger. I would have liked to see more gunfire and a sex scene that lasted over 3 minutes however for a straight to DVD movie, this wasn't half bad.

1413109,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B004LGGXG4,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 0]","First off I was confused as to if this belongs in the Sniper series which starred Tom Berenger. I know Billy Zane was in one of the Sniper films as well but since I hadn't caught that one, I wasn't sure if this is a standalone are part of that series.This film wasn't as bad as I assumed it would be. I try to stay away from anything that has Billy Zane in it seeing how he's been in B-movie hell for the last fifteen years. I decided to check this out after seeing the trailer on On Demand. I was surprised at how good it was (for a B-movie) and found it entertaining.I don't care for military movies much but Chad Collins had me intrigued. He's not only very good-looking but has true star quality that keeps you watching. He's a good actor and portrays Brandon very realistically. It's a shame this wasn't a major picture so more people could see his work.Unfortunately the plot is something I've seen a million times. A soldier Brandon(Chad Collins)is sent on a mission and his men are all killed by a mysterious sniper. Brandon is determined to found out who was behind the ambush and of course it leads to someone connected to him. I won't add more for fear of spoiling but the plot and the ending could've been more imaginable.You'll be able to guess who the culprit is in twenty minutes.The actors are all good and even Zane is a pleasure to watch in this probably because he didn't show up until halfway through the movie. There's an unnecessary romance between Brandon and Ellen his superior which makes no sense because there was no development towards it. At the beginning of the film Brandon tries to pick up Ellen after a bet (not knowing she's a Lieutenant) and she shoots him down. Then they meet up again about an hour into the film, go on one date and make love. It seemed obvious that this so-called romance was just thrown in so the move could have a sex scene. Why I don't know because it was completely pointless.The movie is fast-paced which is always a good thing. It's no Platoon but it stands on its own as a decent military flick.

I must say the special effects on the blood and bullets were good. The plot is another story. It made me go to Google. First off there is no United Nations code of Military Justice, nor is there a United Nation Military Code of Criminal Justice. In fact it is just the opposite. There is no military code of conduct in the UN which has caused problems in recent times and the UN is in the early stages of looking into such a code. The movie attempts to make a statement about strong patriotic military men vs. weak politicians who play both sides of the coin.Chad Michael Collins plays ""son of sniper""  (I don't recall seeing the other movies) in this weak plot, no character developing saga of UN gone awry in the Congo. Billy Zane had the best lines in the whole movie, unfortunately he wasn't in the movie enough to make it work. One sex scene, no nudity, don't recall any f-bombs. Collins as an actor was about a C- if Zane is an ""A"". If you have a choice between this and a Steven Seagal or Steve Austin movie, choose this one. 3 stars plus a half star for the guy's head getting blown off.",4,I SEE YOU,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,1216,"['was', 'line', 'spoken', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'prior', 'blowing', 'off', 'head', 'UN', 'Congo', 'soldier', '50', 'caliber', 'bullet', 'must', 'say', 'special', 'effects', 'blood', 'bullets', 'were', 'good', 'plot', 'story', 'made', 'go', 'Google', 'First', 'United', 'Nations', 'code', 'Military', 'Justice', 'United', 'Nation', 'Military', 'Code', 'Criminal', 'Justice', 'fact', 'just', 'opposite', 'military', 'code', 'conduct', 'UN', 'caused', 'problems', 'recent', 'times', 'UN', 'early', 'stages', 'looking', 'code', 'movie', 'make', 'statement', 'strong', 'patriotic', 'military', 'men', 'vs.', 'weak', 'politicians', 'who', 'play', 'sides', 'coin.Chad', 'Michael', 'Collins', 'son', 'sniper', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'other', 'movies', 'weak', 'plot', 'character', 'developing', 'saga', 'UN', 'gone', 'awry', 'Congo', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'had', 'best', 'lines', 'whole', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'enough', 'make', 'work', 'One', 'sex', 'scene', 'nudity', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'f-bombs', 'Collins', 'actor', 'was', 'C-', 'Zane', 'A', 'have', 'choice', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'movie', 'choose', 'one', '3', 'stars', 'half', 'star', 'guy', 'head', 'getting', 'blown', 'off']",Sniper: Reloaded

Although it helps to know the back story of his father and why Miller (Zane) is helping, but it's not necessary.  This movie is very much like the other three, action is very good and exciting to watch.  When there is no action or shooting, which is about 80% of the movie it slows way down and is hard to stay focused on it.  If you like the other ones you will probebly like this one.  I did not.
