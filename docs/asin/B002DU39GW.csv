1264010,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B002DU39GW,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","State of Play, 2009 filmThere is a man running in the street at night. A man shoots two people with a silenced pistol. In the morning a car drives on a street; Cal is a reporter and questions a detective. A congressman learns of a death of an employee in the subway. The reporter tells about one victim. Congressman Stephen Collins learns of the death of a researcher in the subway. Collins is looking into a Defense Dept. contractor's operations. Collins is questioned, he is advised to ""lay low"" for now. The `Washington Globe' has new owners who want to turn a profit. Was the death of Sonya a suicide? Cal visits his old college roommate. Collins says it wasn't a suicide! (He had a phone call from her.) Cal McCaffrey calls a reporter and offers a tip about the subway security cameras. No luck! But the research goes on.Cal talks to Ann Collins. Then he goes to a morgue to check out one of the shot victims. He checks the numbers on this victim's cell phone - there is a link to Sonya! A woman offers to sell Cal something stolen by her boyfriend Deshawn, another victim. He had photos of Collins! Who wanted Sonya dead? Those bullets left a clue to the killer. One of the shooting victims may be coming out of a coma. Shots through a window kill a patient. The police question Cal about those photos. The newspaper investigation will go on. So does the Congressional investigation into Point Corp. Doors slam in a reporter's face. They look for Sonya's former roommate. The subway camera has a photo of a man. Was he at the hospital? Cal meets an inside source. Point Corp wants to take over domestic security. Collins explains how.Cal interviews Collins' wife about a possible deal; he didn't have the cash. A source talks to Cal about the man in the photo. Cal looks for the man at that address. Is he in danger in the parking garage? The police arrive. Cal learns about Deshawn's girlfriend; she won't talk to the police. Do corporations use scandals to destroy political opponents? [Yes.] They investigate the lobbyist for Point Corp. Can they get him on tape? They talk in a motel room. The more Dominic talks, the more he is protected. He tells about Sonya, she was planted on Collins! We learn more about Sonya's history. There is an unexpected event! Collins is angry and upset over this story. Can questions Congressman Ferguson, he tells his story and threatens Cal. Can this story be published? Collins tells his story and provides corroboration. Cal wonders how Ann Collins knew what Sonya earned? Collins tells about Bingham following Sonya. This is a shocking surprise! ""I lied."" The police arrive as Cal leaves the building, just in time. The typed headlines tells what happened next.The pacing of this story could be better, and, the ending detracts from the main story due to its corrupt character. The best fiction is based on true events (if you can recognize it). This story seems based on the disappearance and death of a young woman who was an intern for a Congressman some years ago. He was investigating the actions of a Defense contractor at the time. The investigation of her disappearance revealed their personal relationship. Some wondered at the time if this was an attempt to end his career by her disappearance.

1264013,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B002DU39GW,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 3]",".STATE OF PLAY is a good sound thriller of the conspiracy type that will remind many viewers of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.  The plot concerns an evil corporation that has, for all intents and purposes, been hiring worn-out soldiers and employing them directly, running on the government's money.  (The corp's name is changed in the movie but look for its logo, which is similar to the real thing.)  So well-backstopped is this menacing entity that it has effectively squelched the news media from using the term ""mercenaries,"" which of course is exactly what privately-employed soldiers are.The cast boasts Russell Crowe as the crusading reporter who gets in over his head, a last-minute sub for Brad Pitt.  The investigation becomes so convoluted and complicated that he needs a rookie reporter (Rachel McAdams) to help.  Along the way the pair have to deal with a bottom-line-oriented editor (Helen Mirren, somewhat reminiscent of the Glenn Close character in THE PAPER), an idealistic young congressman conducting an investigation into the company (Ben Affleck) and his mentor, a fellow congressman who turns out to have more sides than we first thought (well underplayed by Jeff Daniels).  The plot blooms nicely with the emphasis on gathering paranoia -- not only who knew what when, but what was their motive in doing what they did?  The reporters have to deal with the spectre of electronic eavesdropping and physical danger (I'd rather not spoil that part.)This is a good evening's entertainment.  The movie is solid and the plot will keep you guessing.  It has a minimum of the kind of sudden-attack violence to which this film genre seems increasingly addicted.  Russell Crowe's character is well portrayed but disheveled to a fault; nonetheless I feel if Brad Pitt had played a clean-cut version of this role as originally cast, the overall movie would not be vastly different.  STATE OF PLAY is not an outstanding flick like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN but it has its moments and holds interest. It also takes some interestng looks at the non-federal part of the District of Columbia, the parts tourists don't see but locals know well.For the sake of home viewers I should note that we saw the first DVD release and it is surprisingly skimpy on bells-and-whistles, just two brief deleted scenes and a fairly standard making-of documentary with director, screenwriter and actors.

1264018,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B002DU39GW,Andrew Desmond,"[3, 3]","""State of Play"" is a complex whodunnit set against a backdrop of political intrigue in Washington DC.  There are crosses and double crosses that keep the viewer interested until the very end.  This is a good sign for a film of this genre.Yet, for all its virtues, ""State of Play"" manages to fall short of the mark.  My suspicion is that it was simply trying to cram too much detail into a two hour film.  Perhaps it would have been better in its previous incarnation as a mini-series.  In this way, the various threads could have been tied together more carefully.  In the film, the viewer is compelled to play close attention.  One missed detail could easily create confusion.As to the acting, Russell Crowe again steals the show.  Crowe is the complete actor.  No matter what the role, he always manages to rise to the occasion.  Here, he plays the role of an old fashioned, crumpled newspaper man.  He is overweight, unkempt and so very plausible.  He is supported by some fine acting by Ben Affleck as a congressman of questionable motives, Rachel McAdams as the young newspaper blogger and Helen Mirren as the paper's editor.  Mirren seems to get better with age.  Yet, it is Crowe who is truly larger than life.While I enjoyed this film, I am unable to recommend it with anything more than four stars.

1264020,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002DU39GW,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Take an excellent cast, a smart director and an accomplished screen writer, throw them into a room and let them go at it and you'd swear you'll walk away with a masterpiece, right.  Well, a masterpiece `State of Play' is not, but what it is is a very, very good movie; a great movie even.  With noteworthy performances, a tightly woven plot and engaging camera work that keeps us glued throughout, `State of Play' did more than just hold my attention; it grabbed it and flung it across the room.I knew I was going to see this movie before I knew anything about it; I am that devoted to Russell Crowe.  Then I read that it was a remake of a BBC min-series.  I still have as of yet to see that, but I will now that I've seen this film.I don't want to spoil too much of the movie, since Tony Gilroy worked real hard to make this an engaging and exciting thrill ride with twists and turns that are not predictable (even if you think they are).  All I'll say is that it starts with a murder, and then a presumed suicide.  Reporter Cal McAffrey is working on the murders, while blog reporter Della Frye is working on the suicide.  The suicide happens to be of a woman who worked for Congressman Stephen Collins, an old college buddy of Cal's.  When Cal starts to look into the young woman's death he unveils that the murder he is working on and this `suicide' seem to be related; but it goes much deeper than that.Like I said, I really don't want to give too much away.The acting here is spot on across the board.  Crowe is always a reliable source for quality entertainment, and he doesn't disappoint here.  He also doesn't out act his co-stars (which wouldn't be hard for him to do when matched with McAdams or Affleck), so the film never seems uneven.  This isn't to say that he drops the ball, for he is always in character and acting his tail off (just watch the way he processes information, that look on his face), but he knows the type of film he's in and the type of performance needed to sell this.A pleasant surprise is the fact that some actors who are less than brilliant really up their game here and deliver wonderfully.Ben Affleck shocked me with his ability to really `act', something I've rarely, if ever, seen him do.  Rachel McAdams is one of the most beautiful women on the planet (seriously) and she has shown much potential in her career.  She doesn't blow anything out of the box here, but she is consistent and believable.  Helen Mirren is a firecracker and steals her every scene.  Robin Wright Penn is touching and moving, yet forgettable.  Jeff Daniels was a nice touch, and his final confrontation with Crowe was stellar (""SON!"").  For me though, this movie belongs to Jason Bateman, an actor I am not very familiar with who just blazes the screen in his few short scenes.  He is witty, charming (in a very creepy sort of way) and wholly believable.  I just wish they had written him into a few more scenes.Like I said, this is not a masterpiece, but it is an enthralling and captivating political thriller that makes good use of its cast and its timeframe, injecting a rapid fire pace that keeps us glued to the screen, never wavering for a second or losing our interest long enough for us to get confused or give up.",5,I just wish all summer blockbusters were this smart...,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,3241,"['Take', 'excellent', 'cast', 'smart', 'director', 'accomplished', 'screen', 'writer', 'throw', 'room', 'let', 'go', ""'d"", 'swear', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'away', 'masterpiece', 'right', 'Well', 'masterpiece', 'State', 'Play', 'not', 'what', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'tightly', 'woven', 'plot', 'engaging', 'camera', 'work', 'glued', 'State', 'Play', 'did', 'more', 'just', 'hold', 'attention', 'grabbed', 'flung', 'room.I', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'knew', 'anything', 'am', 'that', 'devoted', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Then', 'read', 'was', 'remake', 'BBC', 'min-series', 'still', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'will', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'worked', 'real', 'hard', 'make', 'engaging', 'exciting', 'thrill', 'ride', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'not', 'predictable', 'even', 'think', 'are', ""'ll"", 'say', 'murder', 'then', 'presumed', 'suicide', 'Reporter', 'Cal', 'McAffrey', 'working', 'murders', 'blog', 'reporter', 'Della', 'Frye', 'working', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'be', 'woman', 'who', 'worked', 'Congressman', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'old', 'college', 'buddy', 'Cal', 'When', 'Cal', 'look', 'young', 'woman', 'death', 'murder', 'working', 'suicide', 'seem', 'be', 'related', 'much', 'deeper', 'that.Like', 'said', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'here', 'spot', 'board', 'Crowe', 'always', 'reliable', 'source', 'quality', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'also', ""n't"", 'out', 'act', 'co-stars', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hard', 'do', 'when', 'matched', 'McAdams', 'Affleck', 'film', 'never', 'uneven', ""n't"", 'say', 'ball', 'always', 'character', 'acting', 'tail', 'just', 'watch', 'way', 'information', 'look', 'face', 'type', 'film', 'type', 'performance', 'needed', 'sell', 'this.A', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'fact', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'brilliant', 'really', 'up', 'game', 'here', 'deliver', 'wonderfully.Ben', 'Affleck', 'shocked', 'ability', 'really', 'act', 'something', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'planet', 'seriously', 'shown', 'much', 'potential', 'career', ""n't"", 'blow', 'anything', 'box', 'here', 'consistent', 'believable', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'firecracker', 'steals', 'scene', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'touching', 'moving', 'yet', 'forgettable', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Crowe', 'was', 'stellar', 'SON', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'actor', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'familiar', 'who', 'just', 'screen', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'witty', 'charming', 'very', 'creepy', 'sort', 'way', 'wholly', 'believable', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'written', 'few', 'more', 'scenes.Like', 'said', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'enthralling', 'captivating', 'political', 'thriller', 'good', 'use', 'cast', 'timeframe', 'injecting', 'rapid', 'fire', 'pace', 'glued', 'screen', 'never', 'wavering', 'second', 'losing', 'interest', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'confused', 'give', 'up']",N/A
1264021,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B002DU39GW,Andy Orrock,"[2, 2]","'State of Play' is a nice, little movie in its own right.  Problem is, it's not a movie in its own right: it owes its heritage - and closely hews - (with some Americanization and some updating for the times) to the original BBC mini-series envisioned and written by Paul Abbott and directed by David Yates.  And THAT -State of Play (BBC Miniseries)- was epic television. Running for six consecutive weekends on Sunday nights here in the States, I felt adrift and bereft once the series was over.Now, think about condensing 350 minutes of never-flagging material into a traditional two-hour film and you realize how much of the richness of the tale had to have been cast over the side.  One example:  James McAvoy - almost an unknown as the original aired - has a big, meaty part as a cub newspaper reporter.  In the mini-series, this character is the one who helps break the part of the story involving 'Dominic'.  In the US version McAvoy's character is a dude in a baseball cap who sits around the newsroom and gets a couple of lines.Still, there are things to like about this movie: Russell Crowe is very believable as an investigative reporter; Rachel McAdams always picks and excels in quality projects (and that holds true here); Ben Affleck does good work as a Congressman; Helen Mirren is good (and good to look at - radiant here as always); and Robin Wright Penn is winning in her role as the scorned political spouse (lots of recent role models to choose from).But in almost all those cases, the original British actor rocked the house with the role, mostly because they had so much darn material to work with.  In order, from the list I provided above, the originals were John Simm, Kelly Macdonald, David Morrissey, the great Bill Nighy, and Polly Walker.  Is the career of John Simm going to measure up to Russell Crowe's?  Probably not.  But John Simm is Cal McCaffery - he owns the role, as does Bill Nighy that of the newspaper editor in a way that Helen Mirren cannot...not because of any shortcoming on her part (she's the great Helen Mirren), but because she's simply not given enough to work with over two hours.

The references certainly don't hurt the film, although I wish he'd captured the mounting suspense as effectively! While well-crafted, ""State of Play"" never achieves 'edge-of-your-seat' tension, despite a first-rate cast, and clever script.When a rising politician (Ben Affleck), heading a Senate subcommitte investigating a shady military subcontractor, discovers his mistress has died, he loses his composure in front of a national TV audience, and his political future is endangered. Was it an accident, a suicide...or murder? He asks his ex-college roommate, veteran reporter Russell Crowe (who looks about a decade older than Affleck!), to look into it. Hounded by young, up-and-coming reporter Rachel McAdams, Crowe half-heartedly begins to investigate the death...and a much, much larger plot emerges, involving the corporation under investigation, the Senate Majority Leader (Jeff Daniels), possibly Affleck's unhappy wife (and ex-Crowe girlfriend), Robin Wright Penn, and even Affleck, himself. While Crowe's exasperated editor (Helen Mirren) fights him, demanding to go to press with what he has, Crowe refuses to stop, until he knows the truth...making him a target...Washington, D.C. has never been seen to better advantage, and the press room is so accurate, it's difficult to believe it's actually a movie set. Russell Crowe is magnificent, certainly giving the best performance of the film (Affleck, McAdams, and Mirren are also very good). The climactic plot twist, while not entirely a surprise, is satisfying...but without the 'mounting suspense' element, there are moments when the story drags a bit.

The Congressman is in the middle of taking on the defense department's largest contractor (a fictional subsititute for the Blackwater Corporation) and their increasingly lucrative contracts.  This confrontation mirrors the current and real concerns about these expanding contracts and potentially illegal actions of these contractors.Rachel McAdams overdoes her role a bit at first, as she plays the Washington Post's political blogger (and represents the new online media).  She is cocky and confident, and willing to post blogs with serious conclusions and repercussions based on relatively flimsy reporting.  Crowe, on the other hand, is old school and covers every nook and cranny and follows every lead before publishing a piece. As Crowe and McAdams join forces to tackle the ever more complicated intersection of Affleck's character and his investigation of the defense contractor, Crowe becomes McAdams' mentor and guide, showing her how to properly conduct investigative journalism.  At the end, old and new media triumph as they work cohesively together.  Who knows how much this reflects current or future reality.The stereotypes come in the traits and behavior of Crowe as the old media rep (messy apartment; messy, long-haired look); McAdams as the new media rep (cocky and  overconfident);  Helen Mirren's character as the head of the Washington Post (stern yet compassionate, with her English accent thrown in to provide a sense of aristrocacy); Domininc Foy as the deranged killer/hitman (psychotic with no nuances).  In fact, Foy's character was more of a caricature than a stereotype.Having said all that, State of Play is sufficiently sophisticated and subtle to succesfully carry the sense of mystery and suspense that makes the movie work on a larger scale.",4,"Good Thriller, Too Many Stereotypes, Interesting Old Media vs. New Media Sub-theme",1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,2310,"['State', 'Play', 'good', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'big', 'credible', 'surprise', 'end', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'old', 'school', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'former', 'roommate', 'best', 'friend', 'now', 'Congressman', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'deep', 'trouble', 'series', 'negative', 'events', 'involving', 'one', 'staff', 'Crowe', 'Affleck', 'are', 'excellent', 'respective', 'roles', 'former', 'providing', 'strong', 'performance', 'latter', 'continuing', 'revive', 'career', 'disastrous', 'relationship', 'J-Lo', 'Congressman', 'middle', 'taking', 'defense', 'department', 'largest', 'contractor', 'fictional', 'subsititute', 'Blackwater', 'Corporation', 'increasingly', 'lucrative', 'contracts', 'confrontation', 'current', 'real', 'concerns', 'expanding', 'contracts', 'potentially', 'illegal', 'actions', 'contractors.Rachel', 'McAdams', 'role', 'bit', 'first', 'Washington', 'Post', 'political', 'blogger', 'new', 'online', 'media', 'cocky', 'confident', 'willing', 'post', 'blogs', 'serious', 'conclusions', 'repercussions', 'based', 'relatively', 'flimsy', 'reporting', 'Crowe', 'other', 'hand', 'old', 'school', 'covers', 'nook', 'cranny', 'lead', 'publishing', 'piece', 'Crowe', 'McAdams', 'join', 'forces', 'tackle', 'ever', 'more', 'complicated', 'intersection', 'Affleck', 'character', 'investigation', 'defense', 'contractor', 'Crowe', 'McAdams', 'mentor', 'guide', 'showing', 'how', 'properly', 'conduct', 'investigative', 'journalism', 'end', 'old', 'new', 'media', 'triumph', 'work', 'cohesively', 'together', 'Who', 'how', 'much', 'current', 'future', 'reality.The', 'stereotypes', 'come', 'traits', 'behavior', 'Crowe', 'old', 'media', 'rep', 'messy', 'apartment', 'long-haired', 'look', 'McAdams', 'new', 'media', 'rep', 'cocky', 'overconfident', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'character', 'head', 'Washington', 'Post', 'stern', 'yet', 'compassionate', 'English', 'accent', 'thrown', 'provide', 'sense', 'aristrocacy', 'Domininc', 'Foy', 'deranged', 'killer/hitman', 'psychotic', 'nuances', 'fact', 'Foy', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'caricature', 'stereotype.Having', 'said', 'State', 'Play', 'sufficiently', 'sophisticated', 'subtle', 'succesfully', 'carry', 'sense', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'movie', 'work', 'larger', 'scale']",N/A

He tried here but he single handedly could not save this film.  It has way too many characters for him to be able to dominate this movie (like a stage play) and cudgel everyone else into submission.  First big problem: this is based on a UK miniseries for tv.  I saw the UK series and it was excellent.  So this film tries to shoehorn an entire television series into a feature film length.  This was managed with TRAFFIC but not here.  Second big problem: the other major character is played by Ben Affleck.  Supposedly his character and Crowe's roomed together way back when in their salad days.  It must have been like ODD COUPLE'S Oscar (Crowe) and Felix (Affleck) judging by their personal hygiene habits in the movie.  I cannot picture these two as buddies in any circumstances.  Crowe is a journalist and Affleck is a politician.  Affleck's assistant is murdered and Crowe uncovers an affair between Affleck and the victim.  Affleck's career is now in great jeopardy and he is also a suspect.  We could care less since Affleck adds nothing to this movie other than smarminess. Crowe has a journalist sidekick, a female.  She is cute and ok but they do NOT become like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in HIS GIRL FRIDAY, an excellent, earlier journalism-murder movie.  No, romantic chemistry and sparkle are missing here. Worse, this is aiming to be like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and it doesn't even come close to achieving the suspense and taut energy and crystal clear plot line of that film.

What it did do successfully was provide some food for thought on the relationships between corporations, media and the government. Given the situation the film portrayed, what hopes do we have for containing  corruption and keeping citizens informed? It also explores the relationships of three former college buddies--and how their chosen occupations impact their friendship.Although the cast is a good one, none of the main characters were likable or interesting.Perhaps it was the lack of chemistry between (Cal) Russell Crowe and (Della)Rachel McAdams (both actors I have liked in other movies.) Their characters seemed flat. The defining characters of Cal were his bad hair, love of the Steelers (in Redskin territory no less) and his sloppiness. He is driven by his goal to uncover the truth, but that alone did not make him interesting. I could handle unlikable characters, but uninteresting characters present a problem because it makes it more difficult to care about their outcome. The humiliated wife (Robin Wright) showed some  depth and complexity, but unfortunately has limited screen time--and very little of that showed the dynamics of her marriage.The movie also lacked the quick pacing and suspense that drives successful thrillers. It starts with an exciting sequence, but then slows down with the majority of the suspense were predictable.Overall, the movie explores a worthy topic and has a good cast, but it falls short of expectations. I'd give it 2.5 stars if that were an option. Since so many people liked this, it may be worthwhile for you to rent.

1264047,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B002DU39GW,Davewise,"[5, 7]","Take a story about the failing newspaper industry and the government's use of private security firms here and abroad (forgetting to include any big moments of action or intense drama), and add in a cast of great stars and character actors doing mediocre performances, and you get ""State of Play"". I enjoy thrillers and based on the cast, I expected a lot more in this movie. There were a couple of plot twists that kept it from being completely predictable and perhaps one or two thrilling scenes, but that was it. This is a movie which doesn't succeed in saying much and doesn't make you feel much at all. I never saw the BBC series it was based on, so I cannot make comparisons. There were times it felt like the movie itself was a TV show of only so-so quality; the original might've been much better.Russell Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, an old school reporter working at the Washington Globe, a newspaper recently bought by a new media conglomerate and fighting to stay afloat. Rachel McAdams is Della Frye, the upstart blogger working at the paper who begins with very different ideas on reporting. A story starts to unfold where Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is at the center of a standard political scandal. He's on a panel investigating PointCorp, a private firm hired by the government for security overseas and at home, when Sonia, a researcher on the case whom he was having an affair with, is killed. McAffrey forms a theory about a conspiracy and partners with Frye to investigate. To complicate matters, Collins is an old friend of McAffrey, and in the past McAffrey had an affair with Collins's wife.Thus the standard plot of an evil security firm doing anything to make money is laid out, along with a politician having an affair. Several times the movie demonstrates how newspapers are being pushed aside in favor of online news; however, it never seems to make a strong case for print media. The only case made is that reporters regardless of their media need to follow leads and be diligent in researching. I couldn't help but think when they were submitting a story to be printed that many people probably would've already read the news online by then or seen it on TV.Part of my problem with the movie is that it never made me care strongly about any of the characters. Crowe is a wonderful actor but he showed little emotion here. Helen Mirren demonstrated more emotion as the newspaper editor, but the only emotion seemed to be anger.

Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is a veteran reporter whose college buddy, Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck), admits to having an affair with one of his staffers--a staffer who just happens to be dead.  Was it suicide?  Or was it murder?  Or is there something even more sinister going on?State of play is your basic political thriller.  Government corruption; military conspiracies; and the dogged determination of the press in pursuing a story.  It also has a couple of plot twists that keep the watcher guessing.  The acting is serviceable all around, though not particularly Oscar-worthy.The Blu-ray transfer is good--what one would expect from a recent release.  The visuals and audio are both crisp.  It does not matter all that much, however, because this movie does not have much in the way of special effects or scenic vistas.  It is mostly talking heads.  You watch this movie for the plot--to see how it turns out in the end.Parental Advisory: The movie is rated PG-13 for scenes of violence and some language, including sex-related dialogue, mostly stemming from a plotline involving adultery (not shown).  One character is apparently portrayed as a Christian, but it becomes clear that he is a hypocrite.  Since there are no positive portrayals of Christians to offset this character, the movie subtly implies that Christians (or at least Christian politicians) are hypocrites.Apart from that, I found State of Play to be an interesting movie that kept me guessing.  The ending was not quite as satisfying as the build up promises.  But I would still recommend it if you like this kind of movie.

Collins' principal researcher, Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), with whom he has been having an affair, is killed in a metro `accident'. Questions arise immediately as to whether Sonia's death was truly an accident, or suicide, or as emergent facts seem to suggest, murder. The newspaper's editor is Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) and she appoints a young staff reporter, Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) to assist McAffrey. In a seemingly unrelated incident a petty thief and pizza delivery man are shot dead, but it emerges that the thief stole a briefcase containing pictures of the Congressman with his mistress. It emerges that Sonia was in fact working undercover for PointCorp to monitor the congressional committee's investigation.

1264059,A8WZ4YFQB77HC,B002DU39GW,"EddieLove ""EddieLove""","[2, 3]","When this big screen American version of the addictive and celebrated BBC mini-series sank without a sound at the box office, despite a stellar cast, people began writing off the whole notion of the grown-up movie as popular entertainment. Hope the rumors of its death are greatly exaggerated, and by all means catch up with this terrific film.The story, inspired by the Gary Condit episode, revolves around the apparent suicide of a congressional researcher in the D.C. metro, and how her death is interconnected with her boss (Ben Affleck), the Blackwater-like military outsourcer he's investigating, and two seemingly motiveless street shootings. These crimes are being covered by a reporter for the Post-like Washington Globe, a paunchy and bedraggled throwback played by Russell Crowe. The editor at his newly conglomerate owned paper eventually pairs him up with a blogger from their online arm (Rachel McAdams). These two form an unlikely partnership and their journey from wary colleagues to a cohesive, mutually respectful team, is just one way this film pays tribute to the classic ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.Crowe is low-key, yet sensational. His lines touting the power of the press, might be hokey coming from a less compelling actor, but I bought it all from him. He's simply great in what's an old-fashioned star turn. And he builds a wonderful dynamic with McAdams, who deftly shows us her path from smug newbie to resourceful reporter. As usual, she's also completely adorable, with a ravishing smile and a beautiful voice.The relationship between these two characters, and what they represent in terms of today's media landscape, are the heart of the story, and the issues addressed are really interesting. The film is more a high-tension drama than a thriller. The one kind of suspense set-piece is that old standby, our hero being menaced in an underground garage, another allusion to ATPM. It's well done, if fairly standard, but Crowe does have a pretty novel escape.The reporter's investigation is complicated by Crowe's friendship with the Congressman under suspicion as well as the congressman's wife, played by Robin Wright-Penn. She's a bit underused compared to her counterpart in the mini-series, but she has some biting and effectively played scenes with Crowe.I'm not a Ben Affleck hater, but if there's a weak link in the cast, he's it. He's a good seven years too young to be a contemporary of both Crowe and Wright-Penn; their characters all went to college together. And he doesn't convince as a congressman who's going places. More importantly, as the stakes in the story increase, we don't get a sense of his responses escalating with the crisis. He's good, but frankly, everyone else is better. That includes Helen Mirren as the paper's editor, in a role that was originally owned by an in-the-zone Bill Nighy. Jason Bateman brings his serio-comic perfect pitch to the part of a sleazy source, but as in UP IN THE AIR, he's almost too strong a presence to keep playing these cameos.This is a great D.C. movie, and vividly captures the feel of the city. The production design is also terrific, though it's amusing to note that character's apartments and offices are comically crowded with tchotkis that tell us where they're from. The film also has a really good musical score.This is a sophisticated entertainment delivered with filmmaking style and well-played scenes that have real dramatic heft. Perhaps it makes a somewhat sentimental case for the press by bringing back the muckraking newspaper picture. But, at the same time the movie doesn't shy away from the fact that the reporter's actions have consequences. They're clearly imperfect and they make mistakes. And despite his lofty justifications, the Crowe character is really pretty anti-heroic in some of his actions. And the underlying conspiracy here is pretty bold in it's real-world implications as well, and pulls fewer punches than more explicitly Iraq War themed films like THE GREEN ZONE.Crowe's understated magnetism and McAdams high-wattage charm ensure that I'll re-visit this picture again from time-to-time.",5,Five Star Final,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,4117,"['When', 'big', 'screen', 'American', 'version', 'addictive', 'celebrated', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'sank', 'sound', 'box', 'office', 'stellar', 'cast', 'people', 'began', 'writing', 'off', 'whole', 'notion', 'grown-up', 'movie', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'Hope', 'rumors', 'death', 'are', 'greatly', 'exaggerated', 'means', 'catch', 'up', 'terrific', 'story', 'inspired', 'Gary', 'Condit', 'episode', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'congressional', 'researcher', 'D.C.', 'metro', 'how', 'death', 'interconnected', 'boss', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Blackwater-like', 'military', 'outsourcer', 'investigating', 'two', 'seemingly', 'motiveless', 'street', 'shootings', 'crimes', 'are', 'being', 'covered', 'reporter', 'Post-like', 'Washington', 'Globe', 'paunchy', 'bedraggled', 'throwback', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'editor', 'newly', 'conglomerate', 'owned', 'paper', 'eventually', 'up', 'blogger', 'online', 'arm', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'two', 'form', 'unlikely', 'partnership', 'journey', 'wary', 'colleagues', 'cohesive', 'mutually', 'respectful', 'team', 'just', 'one', 'way', 'film', 'tribute', 'classic', 'THE', 'PRESIDENT', 'MEN.Crowe', 'low-key', 'yet', 'sensational', 'lines', 'touting', 'power', 'press', 'might', 'be', 'hokey', 'coming', 'less', 'compelling', 'actor', 'bought', 'simply', 'great', 'what', 'old-fashioned', 'star', 'turn', 'wonderful', 'dynamic', 'McAdams', 'who', 'deftly', 'path', 'smug', 'newbie', 'resourceful', 'reporter', 'usual', 'also', 'completely', 'adorable', 'ravishing', 'smile', 'beautiful', 'voice.The', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'what', 'represent', 'terms', 'today', 'media', 'landscape', 'are', 'heart', 'story', 'issues', 'addressed', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'film', 'more', 'high-tension', 'drama', 'thriller', 'one', 'kind', 'suspense', 'set-piece', 'old', 'standby', 'hero', 'being', 'menaced', 'underground', 'garage', 'allusion', 'ATPM', 'well', 'done', 'fairly', 'standard', 'Crowe', 'have', 'pretty', 'novel', 'escape.The', 'reporter', 'investigation', 'complicated', 'Crowe', 'friendship', 'Congressman', 'suspicion', 'as', 'well', 'congressman', 'wife', 'played', 'Robin', 'Wright-Penn', 'bit', 'underused', 'compared', 'counterpart', 'mini-series', 'biting', 'effectively', 'played', 'scenes', 'Crowe.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'hater', 'weak', 'link', 'cast', 'good', 'seven', 'years', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'contemporary', 'Crowe', 'Wright-Penn', 'characters', 'went', 'college', 'together', ""n't"", 'convince', 'congressman', 'who', 'going', 'places', 'More', 'importantly', 'stakes', 'story', 'increase', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'responses', 'escalating', 'crisis', 'good', 'frankly', 'everyone', 'else', 'better', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'paper', 'editor', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'owned', 'in-the-zone', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'serio-comic', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'part', 'sleazy', 'source', 'UP', 'IN', 'THE', 'AIR', 'almost', 'too', 'strong', 'presence', 'keep', 'playing', 'cameos.This', 'great', 'D.C.', 'movie', 'vividly', 'feel', 'city', 'production', 'design', 'also', 'terrific', 'amusing', 'note', 'character', 'apartments', 'offices', 'are', 'comically', 'crowded', 'tchotkis', 'tell', 'where', ""'re"", 'film', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'musical', 'score.This', 'sophisticated', 'entertainment', 'delivered', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'well-played', 'scenes', 'have', 'real', 'dramatic', 'heft', 'Perhaps', 'somewhat', 'sentimental', 'case', 'press', 'bringing', 'back', 'muckraking', 'newspaper', 'picture', 'same', 'time', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'fact', 'reporter', 'actions', 'have', 'consequences', ""'re"", 'clearly', 'imperfect', 'make', 'mistakes', 'lofty', 'justifications', 'Crowe', 'character', 'really', 'pretty', 'anti-heroic', 'actions', 'underlying', 'conspiracy', 'here', 'pretty', 'bold', 'real-world', 'implications', 'well', 'fewer', 'punches', 'more', 'explicitly', 'Iraq', 'War', 'themed', 'films', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'ZONE.Crowe', 'understated', 'magnetism', 'McAdams', 'high-wattage', 'charm', 'ensure', ""'ll"", 're-visit', 'picture', 'again', 'time-to-time']",N/A

Here are just three:1) How did the assassin manipulate the young woman into standing right on the edge of the subway loading area which just happened to be one of only three ""blind spots"" in the passenger loading area?  If the Metro officials have security cameras monitoring the area why would there be a ""blind spot"" where passengers get on and off the train?2) A closeup of the Gulf War army buddies group photo is onscreen at 37:55 into the movie.  The camera cuts away for a few seconds and then we see the closeup of the photo again.  This time the photo has obviously been altered from just a few seconds ago.  The smiling face of the soldier at the far right (Bingham) has been changed to the unsmiling face of the actor playing the assassin and both his and Affleck's character's face have very obviously been superimposed on the corresponding men in the photo.  It's instantly noticeable, so obvious and amateurishly done that I did a double take, immediately paused the dvd, and scrolled back and forth between the two closeups of the photo several times to confirm the significant differences.  I'm really surprised that someone didn't catch this glaring error before the movie was released.3) During the scene where Collins ""comes clean"" at the newspaper office, the scene cuts back and forth between the Collins monologue and the assassin Bingham in his room alone solemnly and somewhat ritualistically dressing in his fatigues and assembling his assault rifle much like a matador dressing in preparation for going into the ring.  He phones someone (who is he calling?!) with his cell and ominously leaves a message saying, in part, ""I want to assure you that I am ready to finish what we started"".  I guess the director is trying to  throw one more twist`into the plot by misleading the audience into believing that Bingham, who we have been led to believe has been working for the ""bad corporate mercenary defense contractor"", is preparing to kill Collins.  However, after it is revealed in the big, climactic confrontation between Cal and Collins that Bingham has actually been working for Collins the whole time, that means that, logically, the only person he could have been leaving that message for is Collins.  So why is he on the sidewalk with his assault rifle across the street from Collins office when Cal comes out?  Where are the several police officers who were loitering in front as Collins is shown entering his office building?  What was the finishing action Bingham intended to accomplish when he left the message for Collins that he was ready to finish what they had started?Bonus) How did a young woman whose only notable job experience was ""waitressing"" become the lead researcher for a congressional committee that was investigating a multi-billion dollar defense contractor?  And with that job history how did she get a credit card that would allow her to run up a $40,0000 debt?Oh yeah, if you have an old cell phone you're no longer using and a garbage disposal you don't mind breaking, turn it on and toss that old cell phone into it, taking care to run a little water at the same time as Bingham does.  It'll make a lot of racket but it won't destroy the phone.  Is this a common practice when people want to get rid of a cell phone?  It seems like a 10 second scene showing him removing the battery and SIM card from the phone and throwing the three items into different dumpsters or garbage cans would have made a lot more sense, or just throwing it out the window of his moving car.  Where did this ""lost grunt"" get his covert agent training and why is he willing to murder 4 strangers?",1,Tons Of Holes,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,4022,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Multiple', 'Spoilers', 'Alert', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'lot', 'detail', ""'ve"", 'already', 'wasted', 'enough', 'time', 'movie', 'just', 'think', 'one', 'going', 'go', 'trouble', 'expense', 'producing', 'life', 'death', 'thriller', 'layered', 'conspiracies', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'casual', 'viewing', 'numerous', 'plot', 'holes', 'goofs', 'being', 'noticeable', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'three:1', 'How', 'did', 'assassin', 'manipulate', 'young', 'woman', 'standing', 'right', 'edge', 'subway', 'loading', 'area', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'one', 'only', 'three', 'blind', 'spots', 'passenger', 'loading', 'area', 'Metro', 'officials', 'have', 'security', 'cameras', 'monitoring', 'area', 'why', 'would', 'there', 'be', 'blind', 'spot', 'where', 'passengers', 'get', 'train', '2', 'closeup', 'Gulf', 'War', 'army', 'buddies', 'group', 'photo', 'onscreen', '37:55', 'movie', 'camera', 'away', 'few', 'seconds', 'then', 'see', 'closeup', 'photo', 'again', 'time', 'photo', 'obviously', 'been', 'altered', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'ago', 'smiling', 'face', 'soldier', 'far', 'right', 'Bingham', 'been', 'changed', 'unsmiling', 'face', 'actor', 'playing', 'assassin', 'Affleck', 'character', 'face', 'have', 'very', 'obviously', 'been', 'superimposed', 'corresponding', 'men', 'photo', 'instantly', 'noticeable', 'so', 'obvious', 'amateurishly', 'done', 'did', 'double', 'take', 'immediately', 'paused', 'dvd', 'scrolled', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'closeups', 'photo', 'several', 'times', 'confirm', 'significant', 'differences', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'glaring', 'error', 'movie', 'was', 'released.3', 'scene', 'where', 'Collins', 'clean', 'newspaper', 'office', 'scene', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', 'Collins', 'monologue', 'assassin', 'Bingham', 'room', 'alone', 'solemnly', 'somewhat', 'ritualistically', 'dressing', 'fatigues', 'assembling', 'assault', 'rifle', 'much', 'matador', 'dressing', 'preparation', 'going', 'ring', 'someone', 'who', 'calling', 'cell', 'ominously', 'message', 'saying', 'part', 'want', 'assure', 'am', 'ready', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'guess', 'director', 'trying', 'throw', 'one', 'more', 'twist', 'plot', 'misleading', 'audience', 'believing', 'Bingham', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'been', 'working', 'bad', 'corporate', 'mercenary', 'defense', 'contractor', 'preparing', 'kill', 'Collins', 'However', 'revealed', 'big', 'climactic', 'confrontation', 'Cal', 'Collins', 'Bingham', 'actually', 'been', 'working', 'Collins', 'whole', 'time', 'logically', 'only', 'person', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'leaving', 'message', 'Collins', 'So', 'why', 'sidewalk', 'assault', 'rifle', 'street', 'Collins', 'office', 'when', 'Cal', 'out', 'Where', 'are', 'several', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'were', 'loitering', 'front', 'Collins', 'shown', 'entering', 'office', 'building', 'What', 'was', 'finishing', 'action', 'Bingham', 'intended', 'accomplish', 'when', 'left', 'message', 'Collins', 'was', 'ready', 'finish', 'what', 'had', 'started', 'Bonus', 'How', 'did', 'young', 'woman', 'only', 'notable', 'job', 'experience', 'was', 'waitressing', 'become', 'lead', 'researcher', 'congressional', 'committee', 'was', 'investigating', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'defense', 'contractor', 'job', 'history', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'credit', 'card', 'would', 'allow', 'run', 'up', '40,0000', 'debt', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'have', 'old', 'cell', 'phone', ""'re"", 'longer', 'using', 'garbage', 'disposal', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'breaking', 'turn', 'old', 'cell', 'phone', 'taking', 'care', 'run', 'little', 'water', 'same', 'time', 'Bingham', ""'ll"", 'make', 'lot', 'racket', 'wo', ""n't"", 'destroy', 'phone', 'common', 'practice', 'when', 'people', 'want', 'get', 'rid', 'cell', 'phone', '10', 'second', 'scene', 'showing', 'removing', 'battery', 'SIM', 'card', 'phone', 'throwing', 'three', 'items', 'different', 'dumpsters', 'garbage', 'cans', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'just', 'throwing', 'out', 'window', 'moving', 'car', 'Where', 'did', 'lost', 'grunt', 'get', 'covert', 'agent', 'training', 'why', 'willing', 'murder', '4', 'strangers']",N/A

Going in, it seemed to have a lot of what I really enjoy in a movie -- political thriller-type intrigue, contemporary plot, and excellent cast. Even though I was disappointed after watching it, based upon my affinity for this genre I tried to convince myself that I liked it. But the truth is I have seen so many far superior political thrillers that this one bordered on boring. The plot was decent enough (with a few holes, as always), but I thought the filming technique, pace of the film, screenwriting and acting were definitely sub-par. I didn't really like anybody's acting in this except perhaps Jason Bateman's. Russell Crowe looked bad and was unconvincing, Ben Affleck was miserably unconvincing, Rachel McAdams was entirely miscast, Robin Wright Penn was her usual morose self, and even Helen Mirren's lines were delivered as if she felt uncomfortable saying them and knew she was in a mediocre film. All in all, the cast and script didn't get me interested--let alone excited--as to how it would turn out. The ""twist"" ending didn't leave me with a ""wow, that was unexpected!"" feeling; rather I found myself kind of yawning at the reveal. Compared to ""The Sum of All Fears,"" based on Tom Clancy's thriller in which Ben Affleck does at least a respectable acting job as Jack Ryan (but not nearly as good as Harrison Ford's portrayal of the Ryan character in, say, ""Patriot Games,"" etc.), this movie was yet another that made Ben Affleck look like he should have stuck to writing instead of acting.

He has a big believability factor no matter what the time period of the role he is playing, and his performance in State of Play is no different.The story in State of Play is a mostly smart well written story with good suspense that unfortunately dies off into a political diatribe by the end. The story makes bad guys out of the ""Military Contractor Industry ""Ben Affleck's character says ""We (the USA govt.) pay to train them and you get them killed"" or something like that. Politically, that was a big hot button last year, due to the fact that the ""contractors"" were making high pay to do the things that our relatively small Volunteer Military are logistically prevented from doing. But consider this on that argument, our former fighter pilots, make a lot more money to fly commercial planes that they do to fight dog fights, and I always want to be on a plane with a former fighter pilot at the helm. So if we hire a former Navy Seal to train a fighting force shouldn't that be worth a high value? Think of what we pay a typical college football coach to lead young men into sports battle where no one should ever get killed, and compare that to the ""outrageous"" money that these ""mercenaries"" are being paid to risk their lives, and it doesn't sound ridiculous to me, and it is a much better option than returning to the draft to fill those positions.

The plot is well outlined by others but it would be unfair to go without commenting on the excellence of the cameos by Viola Davis as a pathologist, David Harbour as an informer, Henry Lennix as the detective, and Michael Berresse (best known as a Broadway musical comedy star) as the terrifying hit man.  Without depending on CGI effects, this is simply a stunning drama where the terror and thrills come from the performances by the actors (this may be Russell Crowe's finest role to date!).  A film for thinking adults.

Many feel, including some staff of this movie, to be one of the best TV thrillers ever produced.(2.) A well conceived Americanized version in which the governments use of private ex-military personnel and lobbyists, ostensibly to promote the American concept of freedom, but more accurately it's an exercise in economics or how to get rich quick.Negatives:(1.) Miscasting both in terms of the skill of the actors to become believable journalists, politicians and other professionals,  and stereocasting as exemplified by an aggressive novice female reporter; an unkempt lead reporter; a couple of blacks playing unfortunately stereotypic roles; an obligatory ex-Bond British female matriarch boss; dumb police; sly politicians.(2.) Stereotypic both for the newspaper and background, e.g. reporter strolls through newsroom with harried staff jumping up for attention; unkempt respected lead reporter with unkempt apartment with unkempt office; scenes with helicopters (served no purpose in the story) underground public garages and hotel rooms - all crutches used too many times in movies of this type.(3.) Poor directing with scene jumping and disjointed transitions that left you feeling deprived of connection with the story and it's people. No flow and too superficial. Notice I didn't say characters because there was plenty of, and all too apparent, artificial characterization.(4.) Poor script writing in this Americanized dumbed down version best illustrated by the fact that they had to over rely on music to create suspense and tension;  as well as trying to be contemporary American chic with iPhones, blogs, Blackwater (XE) and  contemporary TV newscasters.

I'm a big Helen Mirren fan, and I usually like everything that I've seen her in. This piece is no exception, but I am giving it three stars because of the slow start, and even up until the end I still didn't find it ""thrilling"". What I do appreciate, however, is the plot twists and turns and general tension between characters. This movie was much more than who shot whom production. I don't want to spoil it, but on the whole this movie considers politics, the consequences of war, and the consequences of leaders in power - all still relevant topics for today.Shout out to Helen Mirren - I love her playing the strong, older, polished, female head of newspaper role.

1264081,A25E01HTNT53KL,B002DU39GW,James M. Rawley,"[2, 5]","Lots of people say the BBC series this movie is based on is better than the Hollywood remake. It's a good series and has an amiable scruffiness, to match its hero -- but in the Hollywood rewrite, its plotting has been cleaned up by pros, and it needed some cleaning up.The original series (see Wikipedia) was made up as it went along, and the writer changed villains in the middle. There are not just loose ends, which several of the critics here have discussed, but loose ends that stick out and hit the viewer in the eye. I can't give away the plot, but the loose ends are LIKE a killer planning to hide his activities who writes letters to the papers about them.The Hollywood rewrite improves or gets rid of these clumsinesses.The love affair between the lead and the congressman's wife was a big problem in the tv series, and can be more fully discussed here because it doesn't give away any of the mystery plot points. In the tv series, the wife is upset her husband was having an affair, so she comes on to the husband's best friend. The husband freaks, but continues to see the best friend because he needs his help -- then every once in a while insults the best friend because, hey, the guy is sleeping with his wife. The wife plans to go back with the husband as soon as she finds out he was framed, even in the very first super hot days of her passion for the other guy. Finally she gets mad at both of them because they're not considering her ... instead of being grateful that neither of them is mad at her! In the end she walks off hurt, though she's gotten sex, love and apologies from both and could stay with either man if she chose.In the movie, by contrast, the affair between the wife and the best friend is long in the past, and the husband has gotten over resenting it, though he sniffs about it at one point. The wife kind of wants to start up again with the hero but he tells her no, so she is almost forced back to her husband. All very mature and quite understandable. Hollywood seldom passes up the chance for heated sex play, but Hollywood was smart enough to see it didn't quite work in the BBC series and wouldn't work in the Hollywood rewrite either. Both Hollywood lovers looked middle-aged and sensible; the BBC wife looked like 40-year-old sex goddess and her lover looked like a helpless child when she came after him. Score: Hollywood 1, BBC 0 on understanding of adult sex.I watched both shows in the evening. It took three days, two one-hour episodes a day, to get through the BBC series. It took one evening to get through the Hollywood remake. Shorter is better. The political issue everyone was getting all excited about was a Maguffin, and changed between London and Hollywood, as if to prove it didn't matter what it was. The BBC series had muddy exposition and didn't start to move until its third hour, getting truly fast-paced only in its last third. The Hollywood version was crisp and fast-paced throughout.All these improvements are only to be expected from a professional rewrite on a high-budget production. Hollywood has the resources to do this stuff right, and this is the kind of thing Hollywood specializes in.",4,"Better than BBC Series, Of Course",1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,3165,"['Lots', 'people', 'say', 'BBC', 'series', 'movie', 'based', 'better', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'good', 'series', 'amiable', 'scruffiness', 'match', 'hero', 'Hollywood', 'rewrite', 'plotting', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'pros', 'needed', 'cleaning', 'up.The', 'original', 'series', 'see', 'Wikipedia', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'went', 'along', 'writer', 'changed', 'villains', 'middle', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'loose', 'ends', 'several', 'critics', 'here', 'have', 'discussed', 'loose', 'ends', 'stick', 'out', 'hit', 'viewer', 'eye', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'killer', 'planning', 'hide', 'activities', 'who', 'letters', 'papers', 'them.The', 'Hollywood', 'rewrite', 'rid', 'clumsinesses.The', 'love', 'affair', 'lead', 'congressman', 'wife', 'was', 'big', 'problem', 'tv', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'fully', 'discussed', 'here', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'mystery', 'plot', 'points', 'tv', 'series', 'wife', 'upset', 'husband', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'husband', 'freaks', 'see', 'best', 'friend', 'help', 'then', 'once', 'while', 'best', 'friend', 'hey', 'guy', 'sleeping', 'wife', 'wife', 'plans', 'go', 'back', 'husband', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'framed', 'even', 'very', 'first', 'super', 'hot', 'days', 'passion', 'other', 'guy', 'Finally', 'mad', ""'re"", 'not', 'considering', 'instead', 'being', 'grateful', 'mad', 'end', 'walks', 'off', 'hurt', 'gotten', 'sex', 'love', 'apologies', 'could', 'stay', 'man', 'chose.In', 'movie', 'contrast', 'affair', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'long', 'past', 'husband', 'gotten', 'over', 'resenting', 'one', 'point', 'wife', 'kind', 'start', 'up', 'again', 'hero', 'no', 'almost', 'forced', 'back', 'husband', 'very', 'mature', 'quite', 'understandable', 'Hollywood', 'seldom', 'up', 'chance', 'heated', 'sex', 'play', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'BBC', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'Hollywood', 'rewrite', 'either', 'Hollywood', 'lovers', 'looked', 'middle-aged', 'sensible', 'BBC', 'wife', 'looked', '40-year-old', 'sex', 'goddess', 'lover', 'looked', 'helpless', 'child', 'when', 'came', 'Score', 'Hollywood', '1', 'BBC', '0', 'understanding', 'adult', 'sex.I', 'watched', 'shows', 'evening', 'took', 'three', 'days', 'two', 'one-hour', 'episodes', 'day', 'get', 'BBC', 'series', 'took', 'one', 'evening', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'Shorter', 'better', 'political', 'issue', 'everyone', 'was', 'getting', 'all', 'excited', 'was', 'Maguffin', 'changed', 'London', 'Hollywood', 'prove', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'was', 'BBC', 'series', 'had', 'muddy', 'exposition', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'move', 'third', 'hour', 'getting', 'truly', 'fast-paced', 'only', 'last', 'third', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'was', 'crisp', 'fast-paced', 'throughout.All', 'improvements', 'are', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'professional', 'rewrite', 'high-budget', 'production', 'Hollywood', 'resources', 'do', 'stuff', 'right', 'kind', 'thing', 'Hollywood']",N/A

1264087,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B002DU39GW,Jiang Xueqin,"[0, 0]","""State of Play"" is an intelligent thriller in which a journalist (Russell Crowe) must investigate a military-industrial complex conspiracy to destroy the reputation of his best friend, crusading Congressman (Ben Stiller).  The movie manages to interplay social commentary (the corporate villain Northpoint is modeled on Blackwater) with dramatic suspense, and finds a balance between the two that draws in the viewer so that the finale is powerful and memorable.Behind all the politics and the drama is a simple familiar dynamic:  two college classmates, and the women torn between them.  Anne Collins (Robin Wright Penn) is in love with Cal McAffrey, but ends up marrying the more reliable and brave Stephen Collins.  It is this overwhelming constant conflict within this married woman that lets her slip into bed with the journalist, destroying the best friends' friendship and establishing the backdrop for the story.""State of Play"" begins with the apparent random shooting of two men, and the apparent suicide of one woman, an aide and lover to Congressman Stephen Collins.  The shooting of the two men causes journalist Cal McAffrey to rush to the scene of the crime.  The aide's death causes a scandal:  during the Congressional inquiry into Northpoint's contracts with the government Congressman Collins breaks down in tears, and the media are relentless in their speculations and accusations.  It is the Congressman's late-night visit to his ex-best friend's apartment that connects two strands, and sets into motion a series of events that reveal a vast conspiracy at the heart of government.The Hollywood hypocrisy of criticizing corporate hegemony (what is Hollywood except part of the corporate hegemony) that combines the arms of mercenaries, the power of politicians, and the influence of newsmen can be painful to watch - but ""State of Play"" is accurate and devastating in its portrayal of both the characters and the tense dynamic between them.  The journalist's boss Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) is cynical and tough but intelligent and loyal - she's torn between her superiors who pursue profit, and her journalists who pursue the truth.  The young journalist Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) is chirpy and annoying, but is redeemed by the sense of goodness still in her because of her youth and inexperience.Ultimately, it's the dynamic between the two best friends that is the heart of the story, and here Russell Crowe shines again (playing the cynical and outraged hero is too easy for him) but even the stilted Ben Stiller delivers a good performance.I understand that the BBC mini-series from which this movie was based is better, and I look forward to watching the mini-series as well.",5,Intelligent Thriller,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,2705,"['State', 'Play', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'journalist', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'must', 'investigate', 'military-industrial', 'complex', 'conspiracy', 'destroy', 'reputation', 'best', 'friend', 'crusading', 'Congressman', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'movie', 'interplay', 'social', 'commentary', 'corporate', 'villain', 'Northpoint', 'modeled', 'Blackwater', 'dramatic', 'suspense', 'balance', 'two', 'viewer', 'finale', 'powerful', 'memorable.Behind', 'politics', 'drama', 'simple', 'familiar', 'dynamic', 'two', 'college', 'classmates', 'women', 'torn', 'Anne', 'Collins', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'love', 'Cal', 'McAffrey', 'up', 'marrying', 'more', 'reliable', 'brave', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'overwhelming', 'constant', 'conflict', 'married', 'woman', 'slip', 'bed', 'journalist', 'destroying', 'best', 'friends', 'friendship', 'establishing', 'backdrop', 'story', 'State', 'Play', 'apparent', 'random', 'shooting', 'two', 'men', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'one', 'woman', 'aide', 'lover', 'Congressman', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'shooting', 'two', 'men', 'causes', 'journalist', 'Cal', 'McAffrey', 'rush', 'scene', 'crime', 'aide', 'death', 'scandal', 'Congressional', 'inquiry', 'Northpoint', 'contracts', 'government', 'Congressman', 'Collins', 'down', 'tears', 'media', 'are', 'relentless', 'speculations', 'accusations', 'Congressman', 'late-night', 'visit', 'ex-best', 'friend', 'apartment', 'two', 'strands', 'sets', 'motion', 'series', 'events', 'reveal', 'vast', 'conspiracy', 'heart', 'government.The', 'Hollywood', 'hypocrisy', 'criticizing', 'corporate', 'hegemony', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'part', 'corporate', 'hegemony', 'arms', 'mercenaries', 'power', 'politicians', 'influence', 'newsmen', 'can', 'be', 'painful', 'watch', 'State', 'Play', 'accurate', 'devastating', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'tense', 'dynamic', 'journalist', 'boss', 'Cameron', 'Lynne', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'cynical', 'tough', 'intelligent', 'loyal', 'torn', 'superiors', 'who', 'pursue', 'profit', 'journalists', 'who', 'pursue', 'truth', 'young', 'journalist', 'Della', 'Frye', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'chirpy', 'annoying', 'redeemed', 'sense', 'goodness', 'still', 'because', 'youth', 'inexperience.Ultimately', 'dynamic', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'heart', 'story', 'here', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'shines', 'again', 'playing', 'cynical', 'outraged', 'hero', 'too', 'easy', 'even', 'stilted', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'good', 'performance.I', 'understand', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'better', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'mini-series', 'well']",N/A

As good as the movie is, it is limited by the medium and could only provide broad hints of the subplots that made the BBC series so rich and suspenseful.  However, this movie is a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours.The cast is outstanding.  Russell Crowe is superb as the driven reporter who is personally involved in a story that threatens to destroy his Congressman friend, played by Ben Affleck.  Affleck is underrated as an actor; his portrayal of Stephen Collins is finely nuanced and convincing. Rachel McAdams is brave and naive as the ambitious cub reporter who longs to be taken seriously and Robin Wright Penn is nicely sympathtic as Collins' wronged and wronging wife.  Helen Mirren is forceful and profane as Cal's editor, though sometimes it seemed she didn't quite understand what an editor actually does.  Still, though it's possible to nit-pick--why would the writers have Collins openly weep at a Congressional hearing, for example--all these things are necessary to the plot, which is necessarily limited by time.

His editor, who is attempting to squeeze every dollar out of the paper gets more and more delirious about McAffrey (Crow) as he tries to track down the truth behind a scandal involving congressman Collins (Affleck).There are a few twists and you get a feel of the issues that the News Media faces with balancing getting the story, versus getting the truth.  (See the Book  'Losing the News').  Then you have a congressman who is overseeing the committee for reviewing a new national security consulting firm.  The plot thickens as McAffrey pulls back the layers of information using all of the sources he can dig up.  Great bit on investigative journalism.  I think it gives a little of a sense of what went on in the Watergate era with Deep Throat and Woodward and Burnstein.The junior reporter/blogger Della Frye, played by Rachel McAdams, is vying for getting noticed in her career giving us a sense of play between Generation X and the quickly getting behind the times Baby Boom Generation.You have a couple of interesting threads blending marvelously into one, issues of Government and corruption, Journalistic excellence and the current state of the News Print medium and internal generational differences.This really makes for keeping you on the edge of your seat and having to really stay in tune with what is going on.

Tagging along with Crowe is neophyte cub reporter Rachel McAdams who Jimmy Olsens it up despite the fact she is a lead blogger at a major national newspaper. Robin Wright Penn plays Affleck's cuckolded wife and seems to be in a different movie than the rest of the cast.Mirren is the newspapers publisher and gets the films best lines, which she dishes, with aplomb. Everyone else seems to be playing along at half speed. For a thriller there is a strange lack of action or tension. The twists seemed preordained and the characters behave exactly as they are programmed.The film certainly has star power and a big budget but it simply does not seem to know what to do with it. Part of the problem is that it is condensed from a 2003 British mini-series of the same name. Condensing the 300 minutes of plot into 120 or so minutes leaves little room for character development or nuance. The players seem to be quickly checking of plot boxes.The films other big problem is that it is a overwrought love letter to the newspaper business, including groan worthy dialogue about the magnanimous printed fourth estate and an end title sequence that can only be described as porn for publishers.Somewhat entertaining and yet eminently forgettable State of Play is worth a look.

Until his research assistant/mistress is brutally murdered and buried secrets come tumbling out.D.C. reporter Cal McCaffrey has the dubious fortune of both an old friendship with Collins and a ruthless editor, Cameron, who has assigned him to investigate.

Somehow  it never got the publicity or the buzz that it deserves and the only reward it received was one for Russell Crowe for best actor at some Australian film festival. This surprised me because this is a really fine film, full of suspense and intrigue.  It kept me wide awake with my eyes glued to the screen as I followed the rather dense but yet easy to follow plot.The story is set in Washington DC in a newspaper office.  Russell Crowe is a veteran reporter and the film depicts all the modern problems that newspapers have.  For example, there is initial conflict between Crowe and young bright blogger Rachel McAdams who winds up partnering with him in investigating the seemingly accidental death of a mistress of a congressmen played by Ben Affleck.  Helen Mirren is cast as the newspaper editor who is looking for the headline that will sell papers. That's just the basic storyline but the plot is much more complicated than that.  Political in nature it brings out the abuses of a security firm in Iraq which employs mercenary soldiers and corruption at many levels of government.I found the story fast paced, believable and as fresh as today's headlines.

Stephen Collins, an ambitious congressman (Ben Affleck) is in a hearing on PointCorp, and when he announces that Sonia Baker, his lead researcher just died, he seems distraught.  The scandal papers say he is having an affair with the victim.  Later, Collins confirms this is true.Cal finds evidence this is not true, and the plot thickens.  Many more discoveries ensue, but when Cal finds that PointCorp, a defense contractor is set to win a $30-$40 billion contract he links key people to the plot.  Somehow after many twists and turns there is a surprise ending.  It is worth the wait.

The story pairs up a veteran journalist (Cal McAfferey, played by Russell Crowe with an odd accent) with a newbie blogger (Della Frye, played by Rachel McAdams).  The plot is technically about the death of Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer) who just happens to be working for Rep. Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) who just happens to be a former roommate of Cal.  It seems there's something rotten in the state department, or in this case the private military company they hire: PointCorp, an analog for Blackwater.State of Play has two different agendas, one more overt than the other.  At its heart, the movie postulates what would happen if the U.S. military had largely surrendered its operations to freelance military operations that are not accountable to the American people. This is no theory. In fact, Blackwater received so much negative publicity that it changed its name to Xe. The supposed hue and cry that would be raised by this revelation didn't amount to much, deflating the entire premise of State of Play.The other main theme is the tension between supposed cub reporters who only blog on the web and real journalists who aren't afraid to pick up the phone or make a deal.  Frye is a foil to make Cal look smart.  At no point do we see Frye actually blog or the consequences of her blogging, besides reporting on something Cal felt was private.  Or to put it another way: bloggers are self-serving, unethical morons who don't know how to report the facts.  The movie feels decidedly lopsided in favor of beat reporters. Oh sure, there's tension and drama and a few surprises along the way.  But Frye is completely unnecessary.In the background is the looming threat of the newspaper being closed, but these occasional reminders (falling from the foul mouth of Helen Mirren, no less) feel forced. To assume one breaking story would save the newspaper is to fundamentally misunderstand the downfall of the newspaper industry.State of Play was based on a 2003 BBC serial of the same name.

1264130,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B002DU39GW,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","""State of Play"" is a product of Hollywood's quest to meld timely political commentary with edge-of-your-seat entertainment. It succeeds with some qualifications. In Washington, DC, newspaperman Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) investigates a double shooting that left one man dead and another comatose, both struck by customized bullets, executioner style. Meanwhile, Congressman Steven Collins (Ben Affleck) is leading a highly-publicized investigation of Pointcorp, a private military contractor, when he learns that his mistress and chief researcher, Sonia Baker, has been killed. The deaths begin to look suspicious to McAffrey, and when he finds a connection between Baker and the dead man, he reluctantly teams up with gossip columnist Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), a colleague at The Washington Globe, to track down both stories.This film is based on a 6-hour BBC series, which I have not seen. But compressing it into 2 hours inevitably leaves ""State of Play"" scant on character development and political intrigue and a little too short to support a couple of sudden changes in direction. It alludes to a swirl of current events, though, such as the investigation into Blackwater, Chandra Levy's 2001 murder, and oily lobbies, PR firms, and politicians. Its ambition to portray Pointcorp's private army as a threat to democratic processes and criminal justice falls short, as too many other plot points distract us from it, but Rep. Collins does take a few sharp stabs at the risks of putting private armies on the public's payroll.The film's strongest point may be the abrasive competition between hardworking investigative reporter McAffrey and the younger new-copy-every-hour Frye. It's the old media against the new media, as the newspaper tries to save itself from extinction by jumping on the blogging bandwagon and giving good old-fashioned journalism short shrift. In ""State of Play""'s idealistic world, those pavement-pounding investigative journalists are brave guardians of journalism's integrity who will track down the truth and print it for all to see, as opposed to the print-what-sells-and-print-it-fast crowd. But here the ambitious, if not quite ethical, young reporter is really quite capable and wants to be like the more complicated and righteous McAffrey. So they team up, and it's all for the good.That makes ""State of Play"" a journalism movie more than a political one in my mind. The crisis in journalism seems greater than the one on Capital Hill that the movie is about. But this is a well-paced thriller, thinly drawn, but with plenty of tension and a strong cast. Whatever one may say about Russell Crowe, he is not vain, and he plays a scruffy, self-righteous, pot-bellied reporter convincingly. Helen Mirren plays his boss, The Washington Globe's hard-nosed editor-in-chief who is put upon to turn a profit under new corporate management. She doesn't have a lot to do, but she gives the role the necessary weight. ""State of Play"" tries to do a lot of things without doing any in much depth. The plot is too improbable to be convincing. But it entertains, and some of the parts are better than the whole.",3,"Improbable Plot that Just Gets Moreso, but a Tension-Filled Homage to Journalism.",1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,3137,"['State', 'Play', 'product', 'Hollywood', 'quest', 'meld', 'timely', 'political', 'commentary', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'entertainment', 'qualifications', 'Washington', 'DC', 'newspaperman', 'Cal', 'McAffrey', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'double', 'shooting', 'left', 'one', 'man', 'dead', 'comatose', 'struck', 'customized', 'bullets', 'executioner', 'style', 'Meanwhile', 'Congressman', 'Steven', 'Collins', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'leading', 'highly-publicized', 'investigation', 'Pointcorp', 'private', 'military', 'contractor', 'when', 'mistress', 'chief', 'researcher', 'Sonia', 'Baker', 'been', 'killed', 'deaths', 'begin', 'look', 'suspicious', 'McAffrey', 'when', 'connection', 'Baker', 'dead', 'man', 'reluctantly', 'up', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'Della', 'Frye', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'colleague', 'Washington', 'Globe', 'track', 'down', 'stories.This', 'film', 'based', '6-hour', 'BBC', 'series', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'compressing', '2', 'hours', 'inevitably', 'State', 'Play', 'scant', 'character', 'development', 'political', 'intrigue', 'little', 'too', 'short', 'support', 'couple', 'sudden', 'changes', 'direction', 'swirl', 'current', 'events', 'though', 'such', 'investigation', 'Blackwater', 'Chandra', 'Levy', '2001', 'murder', 'oily', 'lobbies', 'PR', 'firms', 'politicians', 'ambition', 'portray', 'Pointcorp', 'private', 'army', 'threat', 'democratic', 'processes', 'criminal', 'justice', 'short', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'plot', 'points', 'distract', 'Rep.', 'Collins', 'take', 'few', 'sharp', 'stabs', 'risks', 'putting', 'private', 'armies', 'public', 'payroll.The', 'film', 'strongest', 'point', 'may', 'be', 'abrasive', 'competition', 'hardworking', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'McAffrey', 'younger', 'new-copy-every-hour', 'Frye', 'old', 'media', 'new', 'media', 'newspaper', 'save', 'extinction', 'jumping', 'blogging', 'bandwagon', 'giving', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'journalism', 'short', 'shrift', 'State', 'Play', 'idealistic', 'world', 'pavement-pounding', 'investigative', 'journalists', 'are', 'brave', 'guardians', 'journalism', 'integrity', 'who', 'will', 'track', 'down', 'truth', 'print', 'see', 'opposed', 'print-what-sells-and-print-it-fast', 'crowd', 'here', 'ambitious', 'not', 'quite', 'ethical', 'young', 'reporter', 'really', 'quite', 'capable', 'be', 'more', 'complicated', 'righteous', 'McAffrey', 'team', 'up', 'good.That', 'State', 'Play', 'journalism', 'movie', 'more', 'political', 'one', 'mind', 'crisis', 'journalism', 'greater', 'one', 'Capital', 'Hill', 'movie', 'about', 'well-paced', 'thriller', 'thinly', 'drawn', 'plenty', 'tension', 'strong', 'cast', 'one', 'may', 'say', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'not', 'vain', 'scruffy', 'self-righteous', 'pot-bellied', 'reporter', 'convincingly', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'boss', 'Washington', 'Globe', 'hard-nosed', 'editor-in-chief', 'who', 'put', 'turn', 'profit', 'new', 'corporate', 'management', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'role', 'necessary', 'weight', 'State', 'Play', 'tries', 'do', 'lot', 'things', 'doing', 'much', 'depth', 'plot', 'too', 'improbable', 'be', 'convincing', 'parts', 'are', 'better', 'whole']",N/A
1264131,A3UVGHUDOY77YR,B002DU39GW,MissPammy,"[1, 3]","This movie is rife with suspense and textured with the intertwining worlds of Washington politics, crime journalism, and murder.  It is splendidly cast with Russell Crowe as the rumpled maverick reporter cum detective, whose cluttered cubicle and slovenly appearance suggest a genius at work, one who cares little about what anyone thinks of him and never takes his eyes off the ball.  Rachel McAdams is excellent as a cub reporter who learns the ropes under his tutelage, and Helen Mirren is the brash editor who roars commandingly at her staff as the deadline approaches and then passes.The movie starts out with the murder of a politician's (played by Ben Affleck) mistress, and as it twists and turns, the real story behind the murder gradually emerges as pieces of evidence provided by first one and then another source begin to fit together like pieces of a puzzle.  The viewer guessing who murdered Sonia and why may have a change of mind more than once during the course of the movie as new facts keep coming out and altering the viewer's assumptions.  The sets and shooting locations are quite realistic, and this adds an extra element of verisimilitude.Affleck does a creditable job in his role, but I did not find him compelling, possibly because of the way his role was written; I believe the writers were attempting to show many sides of his character to keep the viewer guessing, and this diluted the power and focus that his role might otherwise have had.  Jason Bateman in his brief appearance, though, was very convincing and capably evoked both humor and pathos.The movie approaches a can't-take-my-eyes-off-it fascination as it evolves, with the gripping suspense and action that go with that.  Most of the characters show at least glimpses of their human side, relieving them of the risk of becoming caricatures.  There's good chemistry between Crowe and McAdams which thankfully never takes them to the inevitable bedroom scene.  Despite escaping that cliche, though, it does have a bit more violence than I would expect in a PG-13 movie.  Although the viewer is spared the sight of Sonia being murdered, other murders take place right before his eyes, and quite graphically.  I agree that it is not as graphic as many R-rated movies and the volume of violent scenes is lowe, but it isn't a typical PG-13 movie either, so I would not consider it suitable for children or young teens at all.  It should be in an in-between category of its own.In the last analysis, it's clear that a lot of work and artistry went into the movie to create mood and suspense, and Crowe's performance is stellar.  Even so, it's a movie that I probably won't watch again. The violence is more than I want to see, and while we see enough of Crowe's genius to find him mesmerizing, we don't see into his character enough to find out who he really is.  Yes, the character is brilliant, but he is still an enigma at the end.  I gave the movie 4 stars, and it solidly earned about four and a half.

1264136,A3ZMC6NFTXEKO,B002DU39GW,"M. R. Griffin ""griffinfinity""","[3, 3]","`State of Play' is based on a BBC Television production of the same name. It is a political thriller set in Washington D.C. with the frantic edginess of `All The President's Men'. There is even a suspense filled scene set in an underground parking garage. The Watergate Complex also makes a brief appearance. Perhaps, homage to Alan J. Pakula. Much of the film is shot in a vast, open newsroom. One simply cannot watch the film without thinking of the changes going on in real newsrooms. This is a credit to Director Kevin MacDonald, who paced the action well and made full use of the set.The plot revolves around the collision of two reporters, one old media, and the other new. Russell Crowe is the grizzled veteran, Cal. His style is hitting the streets and sniffing out the leads and sources that will break the story. Rachel McAdams is Della Frye, Internet savvy and on the rise. When she enters Cal's world to assist with a big story, she is reminded that her status is that of a Cub Reporter. The source of it, the Ben Bradlee-ish publisher, Helen Mirren. Ms. Mirren adds a nice, whiskey in the morning bent to the cast.Crowe is superb. His portrayal of `Cal McAffrey' is intense, methodical, and steady. When the action kicks into high gear, Crowe's pace does as well. At times, he reminds me a bit of the immortal `Aqualung' depicted on the cover of the Jethro Tull LP. It may be an obscure reference, but I insisted it remain. He is secure enough in his talent, to allow the other actor's, mainly McAdams, Ben Affleck and Robin Wright Penn to, on occasion, talk down to his character while he painfully winces, almost in acknowledgment. Lesser actors would never allow this to make the final script. It's another reason why Crowe is among the very best.Affleck gives a strong portrayal of a Congressman who gets caught up in the scandals that can easily be lifted from the headlines of many a Washington Post morning edition. The reminder that the plot is plausible makes a statement unto itself. Robin Wright Penn is effective as Affleck's weary wife. While her part was more complex than most involving `the wife', it could have been a bit healthier.Rounding out the cast is a nice mix of talent. Jason Bateman in a superbly played role as a source in the investigation, Jeff Daniels, as the Congressional majority whip, Michael Berresse as the loner ex-soldier , Harry Lennex, great as usual, this time as the vexed police detective. Josh Mostel and Michael Weston also deliver nice chemistry as Crowe's in the field tech specialists.I also liked the appearance of Sarah Lord as `Mandi Brokaw', the street hustling addict who has a break to offer Crowe in his investigation. She speaks volumes in her initial non-verbal scene, with her expression. Her style is intriguing, and I'd enjoy seeing her in a larger role, perhaps in the future.The newspaper industry may be the last sign of an era that is phasing out. Papers are ubiquitous. They occupy a place on every corner of every major city in the world. Sadly, this is ending. But not before being documented in solid movies like this. Make sure to watch the end credits, as it takes a final look at the process of putting out a newspaper edition. `State of Play' is one of the movies that will be remembered, in part, for portraying a much-loved industry.The disc was viewed on a highly rated brand name, 40"", 120Hz, 1080P set.

1264143,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B002DU39GW,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 8]","Based on the 2003 BBC series, the Americanized State of Play is an engaging, intelligent, and above all else impeccably acted thriller that delivers the goods.  Russell Crowe stars as veteran reporter Cal McAffrey, who uncovers a hidden plot involving his old college pal and current congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) upon the murder of his mistress.  Working alonside Cal is junior reporter Della (Rachel McAdams), and the two of which end up making some huge discoveries that could put both their lives in jeopardy.  Thanks to the sharp direction from Last King of Scotland director Andrew Macdonald and a twisting and intelligent screenplay, State of Play ends up being a satisfying thriller and drama on its own merits, and nicely condences the entire BBC series into one two hour film.

Others feature ""amateur"" detectives, like lawyers (""The Pelican Brief"") or journalists, and this one features journalists.  The Washington Globe (standing in for the Post) is losing market share to tabloids and is under new management.  Trying to adapt, it has added an on-line division, including bloggers.  The traditional journalistic types (like the editor, played by Helen Mirren, and the rumpled journalist Cal McCaffrey [Russell Crowe]), tend to look down on the online folks.  However McCaffrey and a young blogger he initially despises, played by Rachel McAdams, eventually team up to sort out a DC political scandal, get the story out before the tabloids, and earn one another's respect.The scandal has to do with a congressman, played by Ben Affleck, who was a college roommate of McCaffrey's and who is married to a woman with whom McCaffrey had been in love and had had an affair.  Now it seems that the congressman has been having an affair of his own with a staffer, and the staffer has ended up under the wheels of a DC Metro train.  Did she jump . . .?  Complicating matters is the fact that the congressman is chairing a committee that is looking into the employment of private security forces (""mercenaries""?) in Iraq, and his relations to his staffer complicate, in a variety of ways, his investigation into these private forces (modeled, I would guess, on Blackwater).  I don't want to spoil the plot, so I'll just say that a lot of the action comes down to the kind of tension generated by both not knowing whom you can trust AND not knowing if you are being observed or tailed (yes, there is an obligatory parking garage scene!).  All of that is handled well, though the very ending is maybe a bit hastily wrapped up.  There is one of these moments when you think everything is wrapped and the presses are ready to roll when someone says,""Wait a minute! How did X know Y?""  That's followed by a mad dash and a final twist -- THEN the presses roll.What makes the movie work are good performances by good performers -- Crowe, Mirren, McAdams, Affleck, Robin Wright, Jeff Daniels, and, in fine cameos,  Viola Davis and, especially, Jason Bateman.  That's a strong cast.  Add to that a good feel for Washington and its halls and streets, and a nicely textured newspaper floor, where the parlous financial state of the paper is disguised by a sense of busy-ness and corporate gloss.

The original release on Standard Definition video wasn't bad, on blu ray it is simply better.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the low twenties which is certainly not the highest I have seen for blu rays but is significantly greater than the 5mbps rate for standard definition meaning that more video information is getting through at a faster rate upping both color resolution and detail.  The color grading of this film lacked the popping of colors that you often see on heavily CGI type films like 'the Transformers' and colors are clean and natural.  Dark and shadow scenes have a inky blackness to them, slightly crushed blacks in some scenes but are still nicely detailed.  Shots of hair are not blurred masses.  There was no noticeable grain throughout the film and artifacts or stairstepping of images was no where to be found.  The transfer was really very clean and deserves 5 stars.AUDIO...The audio is a lossless DTS HD 5.1 and I was pleasantly surprised at how much good editing went into it.  Often for films, it is the audio that gets the short end of the bargain.  For 'State of Play' you will be surprised at how much the surrounds are used for directional foley fx and even for dialogue come from off screen left or right.  Even the LFE channel gets a strong yet subtle work out which is rare for this type of movie bereft of car chases and explosions.  Normally I usually reserve 5 stars for audio in a movie that really makes full use of the surround system but sometimes subtlety pays off as it does in this film.  I usually set my surround processors audio level to 61 but found that the audio levels for this film, while being well balanced relative to each other in terms of soundtrack, dialogue and foley fx, were still a bit lower than most.  The initial dialogue was difficult to hear at my preset levels so I raised the volume control 3db to 64, which is not much of a raise,  and all was well.  5 Stars for the audio.EXTRAS...The extras were no different than that found on the Standard Def release.  There were two deleted scenes, neither which would have made much of a difference, and the same commentary on 'The Making of'.If you already have this movie on Standard Def than the blu ray is not an absolute necessity.  However, the improved contrast and transparent audio that the lossless codec of the DTS HD offers, might make it tempting. For me, I am glad I have it now on Blu Ray and have no regrets, especially now that getting the Blu Ray is so inexpensive.Every one of my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray and I do hope that this short review had been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

This timeline excuses (explained below), to a certain degree, the leftist paranoia on display in this film. Nevertheless, this film should offend level-headed viewers on many points:First, Crowe plays a reporter in the Woodward and Bernstein mold for the Washington Globe, a fictional representation of the Washington Post. He and his editor are presented to the viewer as embodiments of street-savvy, truth-seekers, when of course, in reality, the truth about reporters and the Post is quite different.Second, a sharp attack is leveled in this film against bloggers - they are people who ""up-chuck"" on the Internet -; bloggers are juxtaposed as fact-less mudslingers undermining the teetering-bastions of truth which are America's largest and most liberal newspapers. In the world I occupy, most of the truth I find is most definitely not in the mainstream media, but instead in alternate media, such as on blogs. Why do mainstream news publishers think they are losing readers like rats leaving a sinking ship if their readers actually think those publishers are their most reliable sources of truth?  This is left-wing paranoia/fantasy.Third, hopefully it is evident to the filmmakers now, with President Obama now in control of General Motors, Chrysler, and numerous major financial institutions; with him and fellow Democrats trying to take over 1/6th of the U.S. economy (health-care), and hold 100% of the economy by the throat (cap and trade) that Americans have far more to fear from leftists, regarding government overreach, than they do from right-wingers, fantastically portrayed in this film as trying to establish a reign by Brownshirt's through contracting with organizations like Blackwater.As another reviewer here put it - this is a film overburdened with leftist tropes.",2,"Leftist fantasy, or, Where can I get my money back?",1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1911,"['film', 'was', 'released', 'April', '2009', 'therefore', 'was', 'presumably', 'filmed', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'assumed', 'office', 'president', 'timeline', 'explained', 'certain', 'degree', 'leftist', 'paranoia', 'display', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'should', 'offend', 'level-headed', 'viewers', 'many', 'points', 'First', 'Crowe', 'reporter', 'Woodward', 'Bernstein', 'mold', 'Washington', 'Globe', 'fictional', 'representation', 'Washington', 'Post', 'editor', 'are', 'presented', 'viewer', 'embodiments', 'street-savvy', 'truth-seekers', 'when', 'course', 'reality', 'truth', 'reporters', 'Post', 'quite', 'different.Second', 'sharp', 'attack', 'leveled', 'film', 'bloggers', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'up-chuck', 'Internet', 'bloggers', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'fact-less', 'mudslingers', 'undermining', 'teetering-bastions', 'truth', 'are', 'America', 'largest', 'most', 'liberal', 'newspapers', 'world', 'occupy', 'most', 'truth', 'find', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'mainstream', 'media', 'instead', 'alternate', 'media', 'such', 'blogs', 'Why', 'do', 'mainstream', 'news', 'publishers', 'think', 'are', 'losing', 'readers', 'rats', 'leaving', 'sinking', 'ship', 'readers', 'actually', 'think', 'publishers', 'are', 'most', 'reliable', 'sources', 'truth', 'left-wing', 'paranoia/fantasy.Third', 'hopefully', 'evident', 'filmmakers', 'now', 'President', 'Obama', 'now', 'control', 'General', 'Motors', 'Chrysler', 'numerous', 'major', 'financial', 'institutions', 'fellow', 'Democrats', 'trying', 'take', 'over', '1/6th', 'U.S.', 'economy', 'health-care', 'hold', '100', '%', 'economy', 'throat', 'cap', 'trade', 'Americans', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'fear', 'leftists', 'regarding', 'government', 'overreach', 'do', 'right-wingers', 'fantastically', 'portrayed', 'film', 'trying', 'establish', 'reign', 'Brownshirt', 'contracting', 'organizations', 'Blackwater.As', 'reviewer', 'here', 'put', 'film', 'overburdened', 'leftist', 'tropes']",N/A

1264195,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002DU39GW,Turfseer,"[4, 8]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I haven't seen the 2003 British mini-series the American version is based on, but I understand the screenwriters pared down the story considerably to the point where 'State of Play' is virtually all plot with little character development. Take the Russell Crowe Cal McAffrey protagonist--he's a bit of a scruffy Luddite whose cubicle at work is a mess and he drives an old beat up Saab. He's pitted against the Rachel McAdams Della Frye blogger and they're supposed to have some chemistry together with the old style reporter going toe to toe with the gossip driven online maven. I wanted to see more of McAffrey's idiosyncrasies but he along with Della get so caught up in the machinations of the plot, that there's no time to find out anything about their personalities. Yes, McAffrey has an affair with Anne Collins ( Robin Penn Wright), the wife of his old friend Representative Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) but it's all pretty standard stuff and by the time the film is over, we wonder if any of the characters have any kind of inner life.As a plot driven movie, 'State of Play' has enough plot holes to seriously question the entire enterprise. Take for example, the murder of Collin's attractive assistant, Sonia Baker. We never see how she meets her end in the train station and how can the news media immediately assume it was a suicide? We do find out later that she was murdered but in a crowded train station, weren't there any witnesses? Nor is the police investigation ever shown. In real life, the news media would not at all be so quick to assume that Baker took her own life. No one is seen questioning this view which would be the opposite of what would occur in reality. I did read on Wikipedia that the producers were not allowed to show any scenes of violence in the train station as its owners strictly prohibited any association of the station with violent behavior.Now Cal manages to obtain photos of Sonia from some homeless woman whose fellow addict was shot dead by the psycho soldier who used to work for military contractors in Iraq. I refuse to believe that a couple of bumbling crack-heads could so easily boost a briefcase from a soldier who is supposed to be some sort of professional assassin. Do we ever see that scene where the briefcase is stolen? Of course not! It's just too easy and convenient a way for Cal to obtain his next lead--Sonia's phone number is on the crack-head's cell phone!As for Representative Collin's assertion that PointCorp, the military contractor he's been investigating in his congressional hearings, has taken over the nation's security both overseas and DOMESTICALLY, where is the proof of that? It sounds like that the films' scenarists approve of the assumption they place in the mouth of Ben Affleck's mercurial Congressman. 'State of Play' is now reduced to another one of those silly Oliver Stone-like conspiracy flicks, where shady quasi-governmental agencies are linked to the nastiest of intentions!What about this PointCorp insider who so easily points Cal in the direction of Sonia's assassin? If PointCorp's tentacles reach so far and wide, wouldn't this insider have been under surveillance? Wouldn't they have had Cal under surveillance and realized that their security was being compromised by one of their own? The screenwriters pull the insider out of a hat which ultimately gives the filmmakers an excuse to stage the Cal-Army Psycho stalking scene in the parking garage.Through Della's side of the investigation, she figures out by exploring the purloined photos, that oily PR executive Dominic Foy (well played by Jason Bateman), worked for a PointCorp subsidiary and can connect Sonia to PointCorp. Cal's unethical side is exposed when he blackmails Foy into spilling the beans.State of Play's ending just failed to pay off. Collins finally admits to his old buddy Cal that he had suspicions that Sonia was working for PointCorp. He hires an old Army buddy who used to work for PointCorp but now hates them (not exactly sure why). The buddy, Army Corporal Bingham, turns out to be the psycho assassin. Collins insists that he had no idea that Bingham would kill Sonia. So if that's the case, why is Collins arrested at the end of the film? Where is the proof that he actually intended to murder Sonia? If Bingham was acting on his own, then can Collins really be considered liable for Sonia's death? Finally, there's the ludicrous finale where Bingham attempts to shoot Cal on an open street as the police close in. He could have finished Cal off at any point before the final scene but chooses to let himself be trapped and ultimately gunned down by the police (how about taking Cal out from a distance in a high-rise, just as he killed the pizza deliveryman who was just waking up from the coma in the hospital?).If you're willing to suspend your disbelief about the implausible scenes in 'State of Play', you might enjoy the film for the capable acting and numerous twists and turns in the plot. Those 'twists and turns' are for the most part not particularly believable at all, but 'Play' will indeed hold your interest--in a run-of-the-mill sort of way!",2,Run-of-the-mill thriller further

1264206,A14WCM5XDC1UT3,B002DU39GW,William Capodanno,"[0, 0]","First, I must confess that I haven't seen the BBC mini-series of the same name.  I'm pretty confident from what I've heard and previous BBC to US film adaptations (Traffik) that the results would favor the quality of the BBC version.  Without a comparison to draw, I thought this movie was quite good and a well done suspense film.On the positive side, I thought the performances by Russell Crowe, Rachel McAdams and Helen Miren were all really solid.  My favorite perfomance was the 15 minutes of Jason Bateman as the slick, arrogant, empty suite PR guy.  The screenplay did a strong job of integrating the tension between old-media and new media, both the pressures facing the editorial side from the corporate owners along with the challenges faced by journalists in the quest for less depth pieces and more real time sound bites to compete with the 24 hour nature of the web.  Throughout the movie the tension between Crowe and Miren was palpable in their scenes together and permeated the feeling that existed in the newsroom.  Crowe and McAdams had very good chemistry -- Crowe, the wise and experienced journalist who hopelessly clings to an outdated and idealistic view of his ""calling"" while McAdams is the new breed of journalist, more opinionated and provocative to compete with the reality of 24 hour news cycles, blogs and talk radio.On the negative side, Ben Affleck was mediocre and seemed to be going through the motions during much of his screen time.  I didn't find him credible as the former soldier turned up-and-coming Congressman.  Additionally, I found the relationship between Crowe and Robin Wright forced and not very additive to the plot.  When the news is breaks after the death of Sonia Parker and her relationship with Stephen Collins (Affleck) is revealed, how was it possible that his wife (Wright) could have made it out to a hotspot bar in DC without being hounded by the press -- especially after they were camped outside her home earlier that day.Overall, I enjoyed ""State of Play"" for what it was.  It wasn't nearly as good as ""Michael Clayton"", ""Breach"" or ""The Insider"".  However, it provided for two solid hours of entertainment with a plausible plot line, some good star acting power and fast-paced action.",4,Solid Suspense Film,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,2247,"['First', 'must', 'confess', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'same', 'name', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'confident', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'previous', 'BBC', 'US', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Traffik', 'results', 'would', 'favor', 'quality', 'BBC', 'version', 'comparison', 'draw', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'well', 'done', 'suspense', 'positive', 'side', 'thought', 'performances', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Helen', 'Miren', 'were', 'really', 'solid', 'favorite', 'perfomance', 'was', '15', 'minutes', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'slick', 'arrogant', 'empty', 'suite', 'PR', 'guy', 'screenplay', 'did', 'strong', 'job', 'integrating', 'tension', 'old-media', 'new', 'media', 'pressures', 'facing', 'editorial', 'side', 'corporate', 'owners', 'challenges', 'faced', 'journalists', 'quest', 'less', 'depth', 'pieces', 'more', 'real', 'time', 'sound', 'compete', '24', 'hour', 'nature', 'web', 'movie', 'tension', 'Crowe', 'Miren', 'was', 'palpable', 'scenes', 'together', 'permeated', 'feeling', 'existed', 'newsroom', 'Crowe', 'McAdams', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Crowe', 'wise', 'experienced', 'journalist', 'who', 'hopelessly', 'clings', 'outdated', 'idealistic', 'view', 'calling', 'McAdams', 'new', 'breed', 'journalist', 'more', 'opinionated', 'provocative', 'compete', 'reality', '24', 'hour', 'news', 'cycles', 'blogs', 'talk', 'radio.On', 'negative', 'side', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'was', 'mediocre', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'credible', 'former', 'soldier', 'turned', 'up-and-coming', 'Congressman', 'Additionally', 'found', 'relationship', 'Crowe', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'forced', 'not', 'very', 'additive', 'plot', 'When', 'news', 'breaks', 'death', 'Sonia', 'Parker', 'relationship', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'Affleck', 'revealed', 'how', 'was', 'possible', 'wife', 'Wright', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'hotspot', 'bar', 'DC', 'being', 'hounded', 'press', 'especially', 'were', 'camped', 'home', 'earlier', 'day.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'State', 'Play', 'what', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Breach', 'Insider', 'However', 'provided', 'two', 'solid', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'plausible', 'plot', 'line', 'good', 'star', 'acting', 'power', 'fast-paced', 'action']",N/A
1264207,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B002DU39GW,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[47, 56]","Based on the BBC mini-series, director Kevin McDonald's ""STATE OF PLAY"" blends the two most reliable, favorite ingredients of an effective thriller; a political-conspiracy thriller mixed in with a journalism drama with a touch of a murder mystery mixed in. The film's direction can be taut, clean and energetic that plays on the moralities of politics and the responsibility of credible reporting. Kevin McDonald maneuvers the film's script in a meaty web of intrigue and suspense that is nicely acted and honest in its execution.Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is a seasoned reporter working at a struggling newspaper called ""The Washington Globe"". When the research assistant (played by Maria Thayer) and lover to a congressman named Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is killed, her mysterious death provokes a lot of speculation for a high-profile story. Cal has a history with Collins and his wife Anne (Robin Wright Penn), so he is the natural pick to tackle this story. But Cal becomes conflicted with what story he wants to tell the longer he digs for the truth; which leads him to team up with a young inexperienced reporter named Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) to sort out the mystery full of political intrigue to avoid further bloodshed and uncover the real story behind all the rumors and deceptions. Cal now finds himself face to face with his own `crisis of conscience' as his own proven investigative skills may not coincide with the needs for profit and that the real story may alienate his own friends.""State of Play"" is a thriller that tries to keep its toes by mixing in elements of a political thriller that touches on some real world events after the tragedy of 9/11 and the responsibilities of credible fact-finding. The script by Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton), Matthew Carnahan (The Kingdom) and Billy Ray has its share of good dialogue delivered by characters that has some layers and dimensions that proved interesting. Cal represents the old-school style of reporting; he checks his facts, looks for credible sources and ignores the unnecessary hidden stories. His dislike on young inexperienced blogger Della comes absolutely natural. Cal sees her as the spoiled reporter who may write appealing articles who happen to have a better computer and a better office. The two are representations of the signs of the times and the internet phenomenon. It was also nice to see the script avoid the trappings of a perfunctory romance between the two reporters but instead director McDonald uses a sort of a mentor-student type of relationship between the two after they realize that they are both after the same thing.The film's political side comes from the character of Stephen Collins who may have the best interests of the country at heart, although he made some mistakes on some decisions such as bedding his own research assistant. The screenplay is a little cautious, but it does point an accusing finger at certain corporations who make huge profit from a war. Apparently the privatization of soldiers in the war against terror is one profitable industry, and these soldiers are just mercenaries answerable to no one. The moral responsibilities of fighting a war are touched upon as well as maintaining the image of a clean public figure. Smear campaigns, damaging rumors and speculations are used to manipulate Congress to satisfy the needs of big corporate America.Director McDonald does get the atmosphere and the fast-paced feel of a newspaper right. I liked the old-school `press room' with the editor looking above the reporters. McDonald is to be commended that he remembered to bring such late night hurdles into exposition; although frankly, the stereotypical character of Cal's editor in the person of Helen Mirren should've been abandoned. Mirren does a good performance as Cal's impatient and overly cautious editor, but her character has been overused in other films in this genre. The shady, corrupt politician in the person of Jeff Daniels has also been done to death. I also have issues with the age factor between Cal and Collins; Affleck and Crowe just don't fit as former college buddies. Affleck is decent as the congressman but Crowe just looked so much older than him, I couldn't really buy into the idea that they're the same age. The relationship between Cal and Anne isn't really brought into fruition; quite frankly, it felt a little forced to add some spice to the screenplay.The manner of which the plot unravels is full of various storylines that come to a satisfying ending but some elements feel unnecessary. The script should have been more compact and some scenes dragged a little bit. It doesn't really hurt the film but Jason Bateman's scenes should have been more efficiently played out. It also seemed to try too hard on satisfying its audience in both the cerebral conspiracy thriller fan base and the action junkies; it does work on some levels but I thought the script may have had the fear of becoming too talkie that it needed to bring some gunplay into the mix. Some of the scenes just didn't match the film's tone at times.""State of Play"" does have some nice touches such as an old-fashioned workhorse in the face of ""blogger-space"", it explores the morals of profit gain and the responsibilities of public officials; the problem is, sometimes, it just felt that the film didn't have confidence enough to stay within the realms of a journalistic drama. It tries to be too complex just for the sake of becoming complex, that it felt like it threw too many ideas that slowed the film's pace. It does feel predictable in the middle of the film, but I did appreciate the effort in delivering a credible thriller. It does deliver the goods and the effective revelations do hit the right spots.Recommended! [3  Stars]Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen.

1264210,AP3B615GM191G,B002DU39GW,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","As a fan of the ""political thriller"" genre, I had been very disappointed in the recent fare from that category that I had viewed.  It seemed as if either all the answers were given up front (rendering the rest of the film rather boring), or the filmmakers tried to cram every revelation into the last few minutes.  Fortunately, ""State of Play"" does neither, instead relying on terrific pacing that will keep you into the plots and guessing all the way to the end.The basic plot of the film centers on two reporters, played by Russell Crowe and Rachel McAdams, for a dying (aren't they all these days?) newspaper.  As they begin work on a seemingly simple story involving a murder, they come to find that its threads are much deeper than what some in the government would want them to believe.Though this seems like the standard fare for the political thriller genre, the pacing (an under-used criterion in filmmaking these days) is so excellent that it never feels old or stale.  With seemingly each passing minute, a new element is introduced into the lives of either the characters or the unfolding mystery plot.  Never once did I find myself glancing at the VCR timer to see how much was left...I was enthralled by the entire story.In the acting department, Crowe turns in another stellar performance as a hard-nosed journalist who doesn't mind doing some dirty work to feed the journalistic machine.  McAdams also shows how versatile she can be (how many actresses could pull off Mean Girls, Nicholas Sparks fare, and this sort of thriller in a career?) as Crowe's sidekick who slowly becomes so much more.  About the only disappointment is Ben Affleck as a U.S. Congressman...it seems as if he is just kind of sleep-walking through his screen time.The final aspect that pushes this film somewhere between ""above-average"" and ""excellent"" is the plot's grounding in real-life issues.  While working for a large newspaper run by an editor (Helen Mirren) who knows what needs to be done for the business to survive in these times, Crowe and McAdams' characters are constantly challenged by how far they should go to uncover their story.  The angle isn't overly preachy, which is always a plus, instead trying to show the reality of the situation.Thus, if able, I would give this film a 4.5 star rating.  Though it doesn't have quite enough rememberable ""oomph"" to be truly a classic (I watched it two weeks ago and already the details are beginning to fade), it delivers a very entertaining two hours filled with twists, turns, and interesting characters.",4,A Well-Paced Thriller,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,2556,"['fan', 'political', 'thriller', 'genre', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'disappointed', 'recent', 'fare', 'category', 'had', 'viewed', 'seemed', 'answers', 'were', 'given', 'up', 'front', 'rendering', 'rest', 'film', 'rather', 'boring', 'filmmakers', 'tried', 'cram', 'revelation', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'Fortunately', 'State', 'Play', 'instead', 'relying', 'terrific', 'pacing', 'will', 'keep', 'plots', 'guessing', 'way', 'end.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'reporters', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'dying', 'are', ""n't"", 'days', 'newspaper', 'begin', 'work', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'story', 'involving', 'murder', 'come', 'find', 'threads', 'are', 'much', 'deeper', 'what', 'government', 'would', 'want', 'believe.Though', 'standard', 'fare', 'political', 'thriller', 'genre', 'pacing', 'under-used', 'criterion', 'filmmaking', 'days', 'so', 'excellent', 'never', 'old', 'stale', 'seemingly', 'passing', 'minute', 'new', 'element', 'introduced', 'lives', 'characters', 'unfolding', 'mystery', 'plot', 'once', 'did', 'find', 'glancing', 'VCR', 'timer', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'was', 'enthralled', 'entire', 'story.In', 'acting', 'department', 'Crowe', 'stellar', 'performance', 'hard-nosed', 'journalist', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'doing', 'dirty', 'work', 'feed', 'journalistic', 'machine', 'McAdams', 'also', 'how', 'versatile', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'many', 'actresses', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'fare', 'sort', 'thriller', 'career', 'Crowe', 'sidekick', 'who', 'slowly', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'only', 'disappointment', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'U.S', 'Congressman', 'just', 'kind', 'sleep-walking', 'screen', 'final', 'aspect', 'film', 'somewhere', 'above-average', 'excellent', 'plot', 'grounding', 'real-life', 'issues', 'working', 'large', 'newspaper', 'run', 'editor', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'business', 'survive', 'times', 'Crowe', 'McAdams', 'characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'challenged', 'how', 'far', 'should', 'go', 'uncover', 'story', 'angle', ""n't"", 'overly', 'preachy', 'always', 'plus', 'instead', 'trying', 'show', 'reality', 'situation.Thus', 'able', 'would', 'give', 'film', '4.5', 'star', 'rating', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'enough', 'rememberable', 'oomph', 'be', 'truly', 'classic', 'watched', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'already', 'details', 'are', 'beginning', 'fade', 'very', 'entertaining', 'two', 'hours', 'filled', 'twists', 'turns', 'interesting', 'characters']",N/A

A sort of conspiracy/political thriller, State of Play stars the talented Russell Crowe, Helen Mirren, Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright Penn, and Jeff Bridges. Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, a veteran long-haired, rather chubby [but still looks great!] journalist with The Washington Globe, working under hard-nosed boss Cameron Lynne [Helen Mirren]. He is obviously really good at his job, but does have to contend with advances in technology and in particular, an eager beaver cub reporter/blogger Della Frye [Rachel McAdams]. When Cal is assigned to investigate a murder that seems to be drug motivated, he finds another case landing on his plate - the apparent suicide of a political aide, who also happened to be the mistress of his ex-college roommate, Congressman Stephen Collins [Ben Affleck] who is married to Anne Collins [Robin Wright Penn].Soon, Cal and Della find themselves embroiled in a conspiracy that has to do with a private security corporation, and the pair's investigations uncover some very startling revelations. The story moves along at a quick pace, and just as I thought I had it all figured out, a couple of twists in the plot had me rethinking the story arcs.
