First off, how does this movie keep the watcher entertained?  It doesn't, all that happens is (in  black and white at that) people dancing around to very hard to hear music  with an occasional voice over.  Then near the end comes the violence.  The  viewer from Chicago didn't say anything about being &quot;disturbed&quot;  by death and violence as any thinking person would be, these Manson people  always bring up this argument.  What the Chicago viewer said was that this  was not the T.V. movie that is most famous and I'll bet what people are  actually looking for.  But as far as the violence issue that DA brought up  most people are interested in it, it shocks us and there is absolutely  curiosity about this case and any idiot that acts like there's hypocracy  involved obviously is not listening and hearing only what they WAnt to.  But viewers, trust me this is not the film you are thinking about.  That is  called Helter Skelter and is based on the infamous book of the same name.  By the way Manson is so over.

431614,A1PRYHJTXFXEL5,6304680899,Ike Amandju,"[66, 72]","I rented this recently thinking I was going to see a film from my childhood called Helter Skelter.  I wasn't even allowed to watch it when it was on but years later saw it on very late night T.V.  It was a two-parter  which started with the murders and concentrated on the trial which was more  of a circus than O.J.'s ever could have been.  Now to get back to this  particular film.  It is not the movie I am thinking of.  It is too weird  for words.  This had barely any dialogue for over an hour, poorly shot and  it took forever to find any info on it.  Apparently this was some student  film made in 1971 or 72' after the trial was completed.  I felt compelled  to write this so no one buys this by mistake.  The real movie was based on  the excellent book by Vincent Bugliosi which was very researched and lived  through by the author.",1,Beware of this title.,953769600,"03 23, 2000",2000,841,"['rented', 'recently', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'film', 'childhood', 'called', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'allowed', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'years', 'later', 'saw', 'very', 'late', 'night', 'T.V', 'was', 'two-parter', 'started', 'murders', 'concentrated', 'trial', 'was', 'more', 'circus', 'O.J', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Now', 'get', 'back', 'particular', 'film', 'not', 'movie', 'am', 'thinking', 'too', 'weird', 'words', 'had', 'barely', 'dialogue', 'hour', 'poorly', 'shot', 'took', 'forever', 'find', 'info', 'Apparently', 'was', 'student', 'film', 'made', '1971', '72', 'trial', 'was', 'completed', 'felt', 'compelled', 'write', 'so', 'one', 'mistake', 'real', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'excellent', 'book', 'Vincent', 'Bugliosi', 'was', 'very', 'researched', 'lived', 'author']",Helter Skelter Murders VHS
431615,A38KB4FUP2MQX5,6304680899,John,"[10, 12]","The interest of this film is that it was made at the time of the Manson trial, so all the (interminable) footage of contemporary hippy events is totally authentic.  Unfortunately, as it announces at the start, it was entirely derived from newspaper reports about the Tate/LaBianca murders, not from court transcripts or (because it hadn't yet been written) Bugliosi's book Helter Skelter, so the court scenes are minimal and sketchy, and the bulk of the film's running time is taken up with hippy concerts and dream-like re-enactments of Sharon Tate (not that she - or any other characters - are referred to by name) in Louis XV period dress which feel like filler in a very short (80-odd minute) film.  What is there is often wrong.  For instance Susan Atkins (Sadie Mae Glutz) is shown doing no more than holding Sharon Tate while 'Tex' Watson stabs her. This was Sadie Mae's original story, but by the time of the trial she had confessed to various cell-mates that she had stabbed Tate herself &amp; got a sexual thrill from it.  I get the feeling this film was hacked together very fast so as to make an exploitative buck at the time.  There doesn't seem much reason to watch it now.  Plusses are the grainy black &amp; white style &amp; morbid atmosphere, and the fact that it was made basically as the trial was going on.  Oh, it says on the box two Manson songs will be heard.  And then at the start of the film it says only one will - Mechanical Man (very weird and not especially good, by the way) - but that's Exploitation!",2,a period curiosity... ultimately irritating,1007337600,"12 3, 2001",2001,1533,"['interest', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'Manson', 'trial', 'interminable', 'footage', 'contemporary', 'hippy', 'events', 'totally', 'authentic', 'Unfortunately', 'start', 'was', 'entirely', 'derived', 'newspaper', 'reports', 'Tate/LaBianca', 'murders', 'not', 'court', 'transcripts', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'been', 'written', 'Bugliosi', 'book', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'court', 'scenes', 'are', 'minimal', 'sketchy', 'bulk', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'taken', 'up', 'hippy', 'concerts', 'dream-like', 're-enactments', 'Sharon', 'Tate', 'not', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'referred', 'name', 'Louis', 'XV', 'period', 'dress', 'feel', 'filler', 'very', 'short', '80-odd', 'minute', 'film', 'What', 'often', 'wrong', 'instance', 'Susan', 'Atkins', 'Sadie', 'Mae', 'Glutz', 'shown', 'doing', 'more', 'holding', 'Sharon', 'Tate', ""'Tex"", 'Watson', 'stabs', 'was', 'Sadie', 'Mae', 'original', 'story', 'time', 'trial', 'had', 'confessed', 'various', 'cell-mates', 'had', 'stabbed', 'Tate', 'amp', 'got', 'sexual', 'thrill', 'get', 'feeling', 'film', 'was', 'hacked', 'together', 'very', 'fast', 'so', 'make', 'exploitative', 'buck', 'time', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'reason', 'watch', 'now', 'Plusses', 'are', 'grainy', 'black', 'amp', 'white', 'style', 'amp', 'atmosphere', 'fact', 'was', 'made', 'basically', 'trial', 'was', 'going', 'Oh', 'box', 'two', 'Manson', 'songs', 'will', 'be', 'heard', 'then', 'start', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'will', 'Mechanical', 'Man', 'very', 'weird', 'not', 'especially', 'good', 'way', 'Exploitation']",Helter Skelter Murders VHS

This stark realism of B/W is especially true in the murders scenes. It also gives a feeling past-tense which is how the script is set up.  As for dialogue -- can you say Noir Film?  Atmosphere folks, body language, reviewing minds and time-periods through narrative/scenery/cinemaphotograpy, all done well.  The lighting could have been better in the beginning but gets better towards the middle. This movie is very dark and moody and quite frankly more than I expected.  I think this is the rub with some of the other reviewers on here, they wanted the Docudrama - Helter Skelter - and got another film instead.  That isn't a valid reason to low rate a flick.
