I am a nondenominational, born again, Christian.  It was one of the best Christmas specials I have ever seen in my life, and at age 64, I've seen quite a few of them.Glenn's story about the gift of the picture of Jesus was ""spiritual"" to say the least !!  The music was beautiful ... I especially loved The First Noel with Michelle Moyer ... and my favorite was Joy to the World by David Osmond.  I would buy the dvd just for his rendition of Joy to the World !!I didn't see this special last year, but I am so glad I got to see it now.",5,A beautiful Christmas special,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,670,"['just', 'watched', 'special', 'November', '11', '2013', 'little', 'early', 'Christmas', 'was', 'wonderful', 'First', 'am', 'NOT', 'Mormon', 'am', 'nondenominational', 'born', 'again', 'Christian', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'age', '64', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'them.Glenn', 'story', 'gift', 'picture', 'Jesus', 'was', 'spiritual', 'say', 'least', 'music', 'was', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'loved', 'First', 'Noel', 'Michelle', 'Moyer', 'favorite', 'was', 'Joy', 'World', 'David', 'Osmond', 'would', 'buy', 'dvd', 'just', 'rendition', 'Joy', 'World', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'special', 'last', 'year', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'got', 'see', 'now']",Glenn Beck's Family Christmas
