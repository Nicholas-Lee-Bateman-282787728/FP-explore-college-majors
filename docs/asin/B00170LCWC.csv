The efforts by the actors elevated the stories to interesting and I was, at first, absorbed and interested.  There were some distorted views of Christianity that I did not care for.  But, after all, that was sort of the premise of the Witchblade itself.  Saying any more would be a spoiler.  I'll recommend to shoppers and viewers - don't watch it if your beliefs are easily offended.

I enjoy Sci-Fi and mystery both, so this looked like an excellent storyline, a good combination.A woman detective comes into possession of an ancient artifact of power and uses it to preserve her life as she fights crime and the forces opposed to her possession of the artifact. So far so good, it could have had the potential to be extremely long running, but then sadly fell from its potential as it failed to focus on character development. Even the little human interaction that did take place when the principle slowly lost many of those nearest and dearest to her as the episodes progressed, and one actually began to be drawn into the elements of the main character dealing with grief, loss, love, hate, and our lesser daily challenges, along comes an episode that neatly rewinds time, effectively eliminating the bonds built up around the human aspect and effectively takes the viewer back to episode 1 as it continues a different themed storyline from ~ episode 10 with the same original group of characters / actors.That's when it became a bit too far fetched even for my somewhat esoteric tastes.The recommendation - worth watching if you're a sci-fi buff, or just enjoy magic based shows, but if you want a believable ongoing storyline with developing characters that progress in a way you can easily relate to and identify with, then we'd have to say it's better to spend your money elsewhere.",3,So close to not being an also ran,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,1498,"['Firstly', 'entertainment', 'reviews', 'are', 'subjective', 'here', 'impression', 'Witchblade', 'enjoy', 'Sci-Fi', 'mystery', 'looked', 'excellent', 'storyline', 'good', 'combination.A', 'woman', 'detective', 'possession', 'ancient', 'artifact', 'power', 'preserve', 'life', 'crime', 'forces', 'opposed', 'possession', 'artifact', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'extremely', 'long', 'running', 'then', 'sadly', 'fell', 'potential', 'failed', 'focus', 'character', 'development', 'Even', 'little', 'human', 'interaction', 'did', 'take', 'place', 'when', 'principle', 'slowly', 'lost', 'many', 'nearest', 'dearest', 'episodes', 'progressed', 'one', 'actually', 'began', 'be', 'drawn', 'elements', 'main', 'character', 'dealing', 'grief', 'loss', 'love', 'hate', 'lesser', 'daily', 'challenges', 'episode', 'neatly', 'time', 'effectively', 'eliminating', 'bonds', 'built', 'up', 'human', 'aspect', 'effectively', 'viewer', 'back', 'episode', '1', 'different', 'themed', 'storyline', '~', 'episode', '10', 'same', 'original', 'group', 'characters', '/', 'when', 'became', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'even', 'somewhat', 'esoteric', 'tastes.The', 'recommendation', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'sci-fi', 'buff', 'just', 'enjoy', 'magic', 'based', 'shows', 'want', 'believable', 'ongoing', 'storyline', 'developing', 'characters', 'progress', 'way', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', 'identify', 'then', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'better', 'spend', 'money', 'elsewhere']",Witchblade:CS (DVD)

Witchblade debuted in a full-length television pilot on TNT and then after its initial success became a full-fledged series in 2001. In many ways the show was ahead of its time. It managed to be both science-fiction (when the genre was suffering from unoriginal sequels and poorly made remakes), fantasy (before the genre was validated byThe Lord of the RingsandPan's Labyrinth) and added a healthy dose of cop drama. The intricate plotlines featured such esoteric subject matter as psychic visions, cloning, abnormal psychology, time travel, reincarnation, demonic possession, mythological motifs, multiple conspiracies, occult philosophical ideologies, and also benefited from clever pop-culture in-jokes.The series was brought to life by strong acting from a diverse, if not at times dysfunctional cast. Witchblade also featured a greatly varying soundtrack (this DVD does not include all of the artists I've named here; see my comment for further explanation) that included everyone from The Crystal Method to Peter Gabriel, from Rob Zombie to Enya, from Three Dog Night to U2. The series burst off the small screen with great visual flare, the special effects were almost on a par with the firstMatrixfilm, and the camerawork was equally impressive.There have been some fans of the comics who have complained about the many differences between the show and the comics. But as I was at the time unfamiliar with the comics, I enjoyed the show from a fresh, purely objective perspective. I also think that most fans of the source material understood that this was not an adaptation in the strictest sense but more of a loosely inspired series that dealt with some of the same themes.And now fans of this cult classic can enjoy their favorite comic book-inspired heroine on DVD... at last.The characters include:Sara Pezzini- A New York homicide cop and the ""Blade-wielder""Danny Woo- Sara's partner and close friend.Jake McCartey- Sara's rookie partner in training.Gabriel Bowman- A young occult/novelty shop owner and close friend of Sara's.Kenneth Irons- A billionaire who may be more than he seems.Ian Nottingham- A mysterious bodyguard/assassin in Iron's employ.Black Dragons- A group of assassins who underwent experimental training.White Bulls- A secretive fraternity of corrupt vigilante cops.Here is the entire listing of episodes, including the pilot film (which is also included):Season One0.

Moher,"[2, 2]","Well I am going to stick my neck out and say I think the above is quite possibly a real gem - I have just finished watching it on DVD and was really impressed with the story and character development, and was also surprised with the picture quality too! The DVD Box-Set has all 2 seasons compiled in one set.PQ (Picture Quality)The DVD is presented in matted widescreen conversion form its original 4:3 format - surprisingly many of the scenes are of very good quality and it appears to have been well done in most cases. The panoramic scene setting views seem to have suffered, the quality was poorer with some pixilation, artefacts, and similar, and the occasional close up shots of statues and buildings looked to have been stretched to 16:9 so looked distorted. However all shots of actual cast and action scenes and so on were clear and almost always very good quality. I played the discs on my New Zealand purchased PS3 (despite them officially being coded R1 - so they are Region Free) and used the PS3's upsampling to 1080p for my Samsung 50"" HD Plasma DP getting a very tidy image, especially close ups of people & faces, etc. For a remastered 2001 TV series I was pleasantly surprised with the Picture Quality result, and with the quality of the actual writing/material/acting it was well worth the few imperfections. Displaying SD material up onto a full HD display normally highlights issues in the quality of the SD material and this set came through very well..SQ (Sound Quality)Although sound quality was not super-fantastic, it was still very good and I generally found it very satisfactory and there were sufficient ambience and surround effects in the remastering to immerse you in most scenes - although I think overall this is the weakest area of the DVD production. The Series on the DVD itself has a very good score of music (IMO) from a variety of artists and genres and they set both mood and pace very well and have a unique distinctness similar in ways to the early Buffy episodes & Firefly for example.... However other fans of the original TV broadcast version of the show have noted a change to the musical score.CONTENTI originally only saw 2-3 odd random episodes of Witchblade when it screened here in New Zealand many years ago and found it disjointed and difficult to follow - but now I have seen the full content of both seasons in sequence I understand, especially with the major event at the end of Season 1 - it really has a very rich and complex story with a couple of distinct twists or unexpected events that as a result make it important to view the episodes in sequence and missing a few breaks the continuity. I had always been a bit ambivalent to this series because of the above experience with the original broadcast but having taken the punt to order a copy of the box set from Amazon I have certainly not regretted it and would rate this one of the most enjoyable sci-fi/occult/fantasy type TV shows produced to date that I have viewed. The DVD set has all 24 episodes (including the 90 minute premiere) providing almost 19 hours of the show plus some special features. The special effects in many cases are fantastic quality for a TV Series that screened in 2001 (& 2002) and compare very favourably, if not better, to much of the similar effects used in The Matrix (released in 2000), as another reviewer has noted. My only less than 100% positive comments would be regarding the erratic character of Ian Nottingham, which seems disjointed and as other reviewers here have said seems to suffer from a mix of bad acting and/or inconsistent writing; a similar (but much lesser) issue with Jake McCartey in the later part of the second season; and a minor issue with the last 2-3 episodes of the second season, which while they are still a high quality in general there is a subtle but noticeable change in the scripting, which just takes a bit of the Oomph out of the pace of the show - up until those episodes both seasons move reasonably fast and are intense, full of action, building intrigue & suspense, and more - the last 2-3 episodes just seem a bit slower, and a bit slower and more self-contained than the previous 21-22 episodes, so one wonders if there was a change of writers or if perhaps the writer(s) knew the show wasn't to be renewed and lost focus (although there is clearly no attempt to 'close off' the story or have a dramatic finale - so it is just left hanging with a bit of a non-descript ending).Overall I also enjoyed the little subtleties too, like the pop-culturish jokes (e.g. one about subjecting people to reruns of South Park made in the context of someone being crazy/insane), and other references to the world as it was in 2001-2002, and as others have mentioned the quality of the acting is surprisingly good overall...Overall this is an excellent high quality series from a content perspective, and the production of the DVD set appears to be very good overall too (barring the comments above). A must have if you are a fan of this series or a fan of these type of shows - if you liked Heroes (at least Season 1 anyway) you will probably like this, as much of the time in both seasons it has that same fast paced 'save the world' feel present in Heroes S1, with also a very strong conspiracy 'alone against the world' desperation in season 1.P.S. It has been commented that some of the music is changed from the original - as I did not see the full broadcast of the show on TV originally I cannot comment on that. Personally I found the musical score generally very good.",5,Witchblade on DVD - Perhaps a hidden gem?,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,5556,"['Well', 'am', 'going', 'stick', 'neck', 'say', 'think',

1155449,A26X2TG93OTXVU,B00170LCWC,Justin Heath,"[75, 78]","I saw the series when it initially aired on TNT, and I found it fresh, exciting and captivating. The combination of pure escapist fantasy and cop drama worked well in this incarnation. Yes, it was strange, but strange doesn't mean that it wasn't entertaining. By juxtaposition of an ages-old metaphysical history against Sara Pezzini's attempts to cope with that in the framework of her contemporary physical world, it created a whole new universe for the writers to dabble in. I believe that people who enjoyed ""Sliders"" ""Farscape"" and ""Quantum Leap"" would have enjoyed this show, as well.All good drama contains conflict, and in this case the conflict was manifest in Sara's efforts to reconcile the mundane and the metaphysical. At first a hard-bitten cynic, we see Sara slowly and begrudgingly grow spiritually and emotionally as she begins to accept and embrace her destiny as the current bearer of the Witchblade.I was introduced first to the TV series, and then I want back to check out the comic: yet I found the series more accessible. At points during the series you were left wondering along with Sara if she was hallucinating or having visions of events that actually happened--which helped build tension in the storyline.The important thing is that within the context of that story, it made sense, and helped move the plot forward effectively. It makes no sense to attempt to bring comic-book characters to the big screen, if all you're going to do is regurgitate the comic-book legend exactly as it appeared in print. An effective re-imagining actually takes old characters and makes them fresh and relevant again, as in the re-imagining of the Superboy legend in the Smallville TV series. I've read the Superman and Superboy comics growing up, which were mostly kind of corny. Smallville has taken the development of young Kal-el and made him contemporary and interesting again.If a film or TV adaptation of a story originally told in graphic novel or comic book format stays true to the spirit and intent of the character, and changes are made to improve the dramatic flow in that direction, then those changes should be embraced as a welcome improvement, and not dismissed offhandedly from the dogmatic perspective of it straying from the comic, or being too different.",5,Excellent Escapist Fantasy Rooted in Contemporary Reality,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,2286,"['saw', 'series', 'when', 'initially', 'aired', 'TNT', 'found', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'captivating', 'combination', 'pure', 'escapist', 'fantasy', 'cop', 'drama', 'worked', 'well', 'incarnation', 'Yes', 'was', 'strange', 'strange', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'juxtaposition', 'ages-old', 'metaphysical', 'history', 'Sara', 'Pezzini', 'attempts', 'cope', 'framework', 'contemporary', 'physical', 'world', 'created', 'whole', 'new', 'universe', 'writers', 'dabble', 'believe', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Sliders', 'Farscape', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'well.All', 'good', 'drama', 'conflict', 'case', 'conflict', 'was', 'manifest', 'Sara', 'efforts', 'reconcile', 'mundane', 'metaphysical', 'first', 'hard-bitten', 'cynic', 'see', 'Sara', 'slowly', 'begrudgingly', 'grow', 'spiritually', 'emotionally', 'accept', 'embrace', 'destiny', 'current', 'bearer', 'Witchblade.I', 'was', 'introduced', 'first', 'TV', 'series', 'then', 'want', 'back', 'check', 'out', 'comic', 'yet', 'found', 'series', 'more', 'accessible', 'points', 'series', 'were', 'left', 'wondering', 'Sara', 'was', 'hallucinating', 'having', 'visions', 'events', 'actually', 'happened', 'helped', 'build', 'tension', 'storyline.The', 'important', 'thing', 'context', 'story', 'made', 'sense', 'helped', 'move', 'plot', 'forward', 'effectively', 'sense', 'attempt', 'bring', 'comic-book', 'characters', 'big', 'screen', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'regurgitate', 'comic-book', 'legend', 'exactly', 'appeared', 'print', 'effective', 're-imagining', 'actually', 'old', 'characters', 'fresh', 'relevant', 'again', 're-imagining', 'Superboy', 'legend', 'Smallville', 'TV', 'series', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Superman', 'Superboy', 'comics', 'growing', 'up', 'were', 'mostly', 'kind', 'corny', 'Smallville', 'taken', 'development', 'young', 'Kal-el', 'made', 'contemporary', 'interesting', 'again.If', 'film', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'story', 'originally', 'told', 'graphic', 'novel', 'comic', 'book', 'format', 'true', 'spirit', 'intent', 'character', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'improve', 'dramatic', 'flow', 'direction', 'then', 'changes', 'should', 'be', 'embraced', 'welcome', 'improvement', 'not', 'dismissed', 'offhandedly', 'dogmatic', 'perspective', 'straying', 'comic', 'being', 'too', 'different']",Witchblade:CS (DVD)

McLaughlin,"[22, 26]","I'm probably gonna get reamed by not-helpfuls from fans of this show, but I felt so misled by the existing reviews that I felt compelled to write one of my own to try and help others like me avoid making the same mistake I did.For context, I was not familiar with the comic, so came to the show with fresh eyes as someone who is a huge fan of SF and fantasy. (Some of my all time favorite TV shows are Babylon 5, Buffy, and Xena.) The majority of the negative comments here deal with the music being changed for the DVD eps, not being true to the comic, and not making good use of the witchblade, along with issues over the season two redo. But only a small number of the negative comments deal with the things I thought were wrong with the show.Before I go into why I think the show was a disaster I will say that I very much enjoyed Yancy Butler as Sara and I think it's a shame that the show was not up to her talents because she had what it takes to carry a TV series. Some of the other casting was pretty good too. I especially liked the characters of Gabriel and the medical examiner (can't remember her name) who was funny. Since I didn't see the show on TV I wasn't disappointed by the music on the DVD set and I actually thought that the songs part of the soundtrack was a strongpoint. I looked up info on the web about several of the songs used.But a strong lead and good music doesn't a successful TV show make. It depends on so many elements that all have to come together in just the right way and this didn't happen with Witchblade. It's a bit difficult for me to put my finger on *exactly* what was wrong in the big picture sense. It seemed to have all the right elements, but the elements were not crafted into a finished, polished piece. A major drawback was just plain crummy writing and poor choices made about story arcs and plot development. The plots never managed to be compelling. And has been mentioned, the time reset for season two didn't come across as anything other than a cheap, tired, overdone gimmick.One of my major specific complaints about Witchblade is the incredibly awful job they did of making it a cop show. I love the idea of blending cop show with urban fantasy. But wow, you need to at least attempt to make the cop part realistic in order to carry off making the fantasy part believable. I don't mean it needs to be an NYPD Blue, but come on. Episodes had Sara shooting people and leaving the bodies without it ever coming back to haunt her, contaminating crime scenes, and basically ignoring every basic procedure and protocol for a homicide detective. This was all compounded by the medical examiner (as much as I enjoyed the character) doing the same ignoring of all procedures and protocols. Anyone who has ever watched one decent cop/crime/mystery/thriller show could have done a better job.Another major drawback, and this has been mentioned by others, was the character of Nottingham. Half of the problem can be laid at the actor's feet and the other half at the writers'.

The mood is dark, the plots are about multi-generational mystical you-name-it, and even in the practical supposedly everyday world of NYC crime, it falls into the level of weird conspiracies and whom-can-you-trust mode.  But this series is also lit dark, to remind you of some permanent netherworld, I guess, cause there are few daylight scenes and even when people go home at night or work in their office, they seem to be underlit at all times.  Most people walk into a room and turn on a light!  But not these guys.  Like they are all mole-people.  As a viewer, it can be hard on the eyes.There are cliches abundance, though the bodice-ripping attire of the female lead is spared us.  The lead actress is good, there's no fault with her, but I couldn't imagine wanting to spend any personal time with her character.  For some reason, though, her new partner falls for her, which is part of that cliche world.  The lead who holds the witchblade in this generation is a one-woman crime force that obeys the rules that suit her, ignores those that don't, and did so even before she was supernaturally equipped.  Oh, yeah, we've even got a ghost hanging around to advise her, like she didn't have enough problems already.The other characters are over-the-top, including a pale blond villain who seems to be an outcast from a James Bond thriller.  And his henchman is an extreme psycho, but generally under control of the master.  The acting isn't too great on this front.  The lead male, the woman's cop partner, has the weird and unbelievable background of having been midwest born and raised but is also a Miami beach legendary surfer turned NYPD cop whom everyone has heard of (he's a legend) even though there's not many people who really follow surfing.  I mean, this whole surfer-turned cop scenario deserved an entire hour of explanation but this background just seems to sit there as if waiting for another series called SURFER COP.Unfortunately, this series would have been best-served as a miniseries.  The first season has both individual and carryover plot lines that reach a summation, a literal one with everyone dead at the end.  And that would have been fine as is.  Not at all fun, but fine.  Instead the second season is a total revamp - like first season was an entire dream sequence - and in making that revamp they commit career and audience support suicide.  Even the male lead of the series, now due to new circumstance, has to become a supporting character despite his billing.  The plot lines, for those who like the continuing, tend to be self-contained.  Most fans judge the second season to have been a huge mistake, that the first season contained all they were looking for.",3,"Miniseries, anyone?",1239667200,"04 14, 2009",2009,2904,"['Not', 'familiar', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'offer', 'review', 'independent', 'off', 'darkest', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'mean', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'mood', 'dark', 'plots', 'are', 'multi-generational', 'mystical', 'you-name-it', 'even', 'practical', 'supposedly', 'everyday', 'world', 'NYC', 'crime', 'level', 'weird', 'conspiracies', 'whom-can-you-trust', 'mode', 'series', 'also', 'lit', 'dark', 'remind', 'permanent', 'netherworld', 'guess', 'cause', 'are', 'few', 'daylight', 'scenes', 'even', 'when', 'people', 'go', 'home', 'night', 'work', 'office', 'seem', 'be', 'underlit', 'times', 'Most', 'people', 'walk', 'room', 'turn', 'light', 'not', 'guys', 'are', 'mole-people', 'viewer', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'are', 'cliches', 'abundance', 'bodice-ripping', 'attire', 'female', 'lead', 'spared', 'lead', 'actress', 'good', 'fault', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'wanting', 'spend', 'personal', 'time', 'character', 'reason', 'though', 'new', 'partner', 'part', 'cliche', 'world', 'lead', 'who', 'witchblade', 'generation', 'one-woman', 'crime', 'force', 'rules', 'suit', 'do', ""n't"", 'did', 'so', 'even', 'was', 'supernaturally', 'equipped', 'Oh', 'yeah', ""'ve"", 'even', 'got', 'ghost', 'hanging', 'around', 'advise', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'problems', 'already.The', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'including', 'pale', 'blond', 'villain', 'who', 'be', 'outcast', 'James', 'Bond', 'thriller', 'henchman', 'extreme', 'psycho', 'generally', 'control', 'master', 'acting', ""n't"", 'too', 'great', 'front', 'lead', 'male', 'woman', 'cop', 'partner', 'weird', 'unbelievable', 'background', 'having', 'been', 'midwest', 'born', 'raised', 'also', 'Miami', 'beach', 'legendary', 'surfer', 'turned', 'NYPD', 'cop', 'whom', 'everyone', 'heard', 'legend', 'even', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'follow', 'surfing', 'mean', 'whole', 'surfer-turned', 'cop', 'scenario', 'deserved', 'entire', 'hour', 'explanation', 'background', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'waiting', 'series', 'called', 'SURFER', 'COP.Unfortunately', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best-served', 'miniseries', 'first', 'season', 'individual', 'carryover', 'plot', 'lines', 'reach', 'summation', 'literal', 'one', 'everyone', 'dead', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'Not', 'fun', 'fine', 'Instead', 'second', 'season', 'total', 'revamp', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'entire', 'dream', 'sequence', 'making', 'revamp', 'commit', 'career', 'audience', 'support', 'suicide', 'Even', 'male', 'lead', 'series', 'now', 'due', 'new', 'circumstance', 'become', 'supporting', 'character', 'billing', 'plot', 'lines', 'who', 'like', 'continuing', 'tend', 'be', 'self-contained', 'Most', 'fans', 'judge', 'second', 'season', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'mistake', 'first', 'season', 'contained', 'were', 'looking']",Witchblade:CS (DVD)
1155486,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00170LCWC,Tim Janson,"[7, 7]","The most amazing thing about the Witchblade TV series was that there WAS a Witchblade TV series.  The show premiered before the influx of genre shows that we've seen over the past few years and the fact that the character is not exactly a household name made it even more incredible.  As in the Top Cow comic it is based upon (created by Marc Silvestri) it centers on New York Detective Sara Pezzini who comes into possession of the powerful artifact known as the Witchblade and wielded by only women down through the centuries.  The gauntlet literally falls right on her hand in the series pilot film as Sara engages in a shootout with a mob gang member in a museum.The pilot films throws a lot at the viewer.  Sara's partner, Danny, is murdered by Tommy Gallo, a notorious hit man, but soon after Sara begins to see Danny's ghost.  She is followed by the mysterious Ian Nottingham who works for the wealthy Kenneth Irons.  Irons seems to have intimate knowledge of the Witchblade yet teases Sara with only bits and pieces as you begin to suspect his motives are more sinister.  With Danny's death, Sara is paired with rookie detective Jake McCartey as her new partner.The show ran for two seasons and a total of 24 episodes (including the pilot) and did reasonably well in the ratings for TNT.  Its cancellation had less to do with ratings and more to the difficulties of star Yancy Butler.  An admitted alcoholic, Butler's problems with the bottle forced production to shut down for several weeks during the second season.  In 2003, she was arrested for disorderly intoxication and ordered into rehab.Throughout the first season, Sara began to learn more and more about the powers of the Witchblade and her own mysterious lineage while coping with everything from common crooks to demonic priests.  One of the key episodes of the first season is ""Periculum"".  The Witchblade traps Sara on her bed as she is put through a test to see if she is worthy of carrying weapon.  In a dreamlike state, Sara encounters previous blade wielder Joan of Arc as well as Emily Bronte, Sara's earlier incarnation.  This episode is very important as it reveals a great deal about Sara's background, the Witchblade's history, as well as Irons' connection to it.The strangest episode of season one is ""Transcendence"" in which Sara uses the Blade to reverse time...all the way back to the show's beginning, bringing Danny back to life and forcing Sara to reacquaint herself with Irons, Nottingham, and her friend, Gabriel.  Planned or not, it seemed as if the producers either didn't like, or wanted to change the direction of the show to make it darker and more confrontational and the episode ends up re-booting the entire show going into season two.The show's cast all played their parts extremely well for the most part, especially Etebari as Nottingham and Cistaro as Irons.  Irons was like a better-mannered and more enigmatic Lex Luthor in terms of being an arch-rival.  He almost made you believe he really was interested in helping Sara early on in the show.  At the risk of sounding sexist, Yancy Butler isn't the most attractive actress around.  I certainly wasn't expecting a Marc Silvestri picture-perfect comic version of the character onscreen but a choice of an actress who exuded a bit more femininity would have been nice.  Butler certainly had the ""tough"" side down cold but it almost made you wince when she had to do romantic scenes (although they are fairly few and far between). Witchblade was generally well-written although it does tend to move very methodically when it comes to revealing the Witchblade and Sara's secrets.The seven disc set feature an all-new soundtrack chosen by the Executive Producer that includes an assortment of hard, grunge, and alternative rock selections.  Take that for what it is because how many people really remember the original soundtrack from eight years ago?  Witchblade was a complex and ambitious show.  Until shows like ""Lost"" and ""Heroes"" came along, there really were not genre shows that spread so many diverse plotlines.  Who knows where the show might have gone if Butler had not been battling alcoholism.A solid group of extra including three featurettes and original casting sessions rounds out the set.",4,Witchblade deserved a Better Fate,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,4257,"['most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'Witchblade', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'WAS', 'Witchblade', 'TV', 'series', 'show', 'premiered', 'influx', 'genre', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'fact', 'character', 'not', 'exactly', 'household', 'name', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'incredible', 'Top', 'Cow', 'comic', 'based', 'created', 'Marc', 'Silvestri', 'New', 'York', 'Detective', 'Sara', 'Pezzini', 'who', 'possession', 'powerful', 'artifact', 'known', 'Witchblade', 'wielded', 'only', 'women', 'down', 'centuries', 'gauntlet', 'literally', 'right', 'hand', 'series', 'pilot', 'film', 'Sara', 'shootout', 'mob', 'gang', 'member', 'museum.The', 'pilot', 'films', 'lot', 'viewer', 'Sara', 'partner', 'Danny', 'murdered', 'Tommy', 'Gallo', 'notorious', 'hit', 'man', 'soon', 'Sara', 'see', 'Danny', 'ghost', 'followed', 'mysterious', 'Ian', 'Nottingham', 'who', 'wealthy', 'Kenneth', 'Irons', 'Irons', 'have', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'Witchblade', 'teases', 'Sara', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'begin', 'suspect', 'motives', 'are', 'more', 'sinister', 'Danny', 'death', 'Sara', 'paired', 'rookie', 'detective', 'Jake', 'McCartey', 'new', 'partner.The', 'show', 'ran', 'two', 'seasons', 'total', '24', 'episodes', 'including', 'pilot', 'did', 'reasonably', 'well', 'ratings', 'TNT', 'cancellation', 'had', 'less', 'do', 'ratings', 'more', 'difficulties', 'star', 'Yancy', 'Butler', 'admitted', 'alcoholic', 'Butler', 'problems', 'bottle', 'forced', 'production', 'shut', 'down', 'several', 'weeks', 'second', 'season', '2003', 'was', 'arrested', 'disorderly', 'intoxication', 'ordered', 'first', 'season', 'Sara', 'began', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'powers', 'Witchblade', 'own', 'mysterious', 'lineage', 'coping', 'everything', 'common', 'crooks', 'demonic', 'priests', 'One', 'key', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'Periculum', 'Witchblade', 'traps', 'Sara', 'bed', 'put', 'test', 'see', 'worthy', 'carrying', 'weapon', 'dreamlike', 'state', 'Sara', 'previous', 'blade', 'wielder', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'as', 'well', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'Sara', 'earlier', 'incarnation', 'episode', 'very', 'important', 'great', 'deal', 'Sara', 'background', 'Witchblade', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'Irons', 'connection', 'it.The', 'strangest', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'Transcendence', 'Sara', 'Blade', 'reverse', 'time', 'way', 'back', 'show', 'beginning', 'bringing', 'Danny', 'back', 'life', 'forcing', 'Sara', 'reacquaint', 'Irons', 'Nottingham', 'friend', 'Gabriel', 'Planned', 'not', 'seemed', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'wanted', 'change', 'direction', 'show', 'make', 'darker', 'more', 'confrontational', 'episode', 'up', 're-booting', 'entire', 'show', 'going', 'season', 'two.The', 'show', 'cast', 'played', 'parts', 'extremely', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'especially', 'Etebari', 'Nottingham', 'Cistaro', 'Irons', 'Irons', 'was', 'better-mannered', 'more', 'enigmatic', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'terms', 'being', 'arch-rival', 'almost', 'made', 'believe', 'really', 'was', 'interested', 'helping', 'Sara', 'early', 'show', 'risk', 'sounding', 'sexist', 'Yancy', 'Butler', ""n't"", 'most', 'attractive', 'actress', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Marc', 'Silvestri', 'picture-perfect', 'comic', 'version', 'character', 'onscreen', 'choice', 'actress', 'who', 'exuded', 'bit', 'more', 'femininity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Butler', 'certainly', 'had', 'tough', 'side', 'cold', 'almost', 'made', 'wince', 'when', 'had', 'do', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'few', 'far', 'Witchblade', 'was', 'generally', 'well-written', 'tend', 'move', 'very', 'methodically', 'when', 'revealing', 'Witchblade', 'Sara', 'secrets.The', 'seven', 'disc', 'set', 'feature', 'all-new', 'soundtrack', 'chosen', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'assortment', 'hard', 'grunge', 'alternative', 'rock', 'selections', 'Take', 'what', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'really', 'remember', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'Witchblade', 'was', 'complex', 'ambitious', 'show', 'shows', 'Lost', 'Heroes', 'came', 'along', 'really', 'were', 'not', 'genre', 'shows', 'spread', 'so', 'many', 'diverse', 'plotlines', 'Who', 'where', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'Butler', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'battling', 'alcoholism.A', 'solid', 'group', 'extra', 'including', 'three', 'featurettes', 'original', 'casting', 'sessions', 'out', 'set']",Witchblade:CS (DVD)
