It is in a way. The thing about Chasing Amy is that it doesn't feel like a Kevin Smith movie. Not like his others. It's a little more sophisticated, and even though the characters are comic book artists, and Kevin Smith characters, it doesn't feel as juvenile as his other work (and don't get me wrong, I love his work).Basically it's a love story. It's really a sweet story. Holden falls in love with lesbian Alyssa. It goes from there. It has the snappy dialogue Smith is known for. It deals with the issues of sexuality, friendship, relationships, obsession, and self-doubt. Jason Lee gives an outstanding performance. Joey Lauren Adams plays the role perfectly. And we get just a touch of Jay and Silent Bob. Really, it is Smith's best work, and his most mature.That being said, Ben Affleck almost ruins the movie. Affleck has never really been known for his great acting skill, but I've seen him do a better job than in this film. He's wooden, unbelievable, and just all around bad. (luckily he had Kevin Smith's dialogue, and the great performances by Jason Lee, Joey Lauren Adams, Dwight Ewell and to carry him.) Another weak point of the movie is it still has that slightly amatuerish feel to it. It's Smith's third movie, so you would've thought he could get rid of that film school feel. Maybe it helps add to the charm, and despite Affleck, it's a great movie.Like usual, Kevin Smith creates a great dvd. There's an introduction to the dvd (apologizing for his comments about dvd on the laser disk commentary track). There's commentary with Smith, Scott Mosier (who produces like everything of Smith's), Ben Affleck (and this man should be banned from commentary. all he does is try to hog as much of the spotlight as he can and says the most inane things--jason mewes' drunken snoring on the Clerks commentary was more insightful), Jason Mewes (who didn't have much to say, but then his part was only ten minutes long), Robert Hawk (assoc producer), Vincent Pereira (View Askew historian) and Miramax executive Jon Gordon. They also have a brief epilogue to the commentary, which is basically Affleck making an ... of himself (I dont' hate the guy, just here on Chasing Amy). There are ten delted scenes and outtakes. There's the trailer and an introduction to the color bars (which come at the end of laser disk), which is quite funny. The booklet that comes with the dvd has a View Askewniverse Legend, which can help clear up the who's who in Smith's first three films.Just to make sure there is no confusion. This is a great movie. Despite it's flaws, it is great. The best of Kevin Smith, even though it doesn't feel much like a Kevin Smith movie. Buy it. Watch.

431919,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6304681526,A. Estes,"[1, 3]","Kevin Smith's third film in the View Askewniverse series follows the pursuit of lesbian-comic artist, Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), by fellow comic artist Holden Mcneil (Ben Affleck). The film mainly focuses on their progressing relationship and it's effects on everyone around them, including Holden's best friend and co-artist (Or inker, or tracer, whatever you want to call him) Banky (Jason Lee). Throughout the film, many twists are presented and many shocking revelations are made. If you haven't been told the whole story of the movie, you won't read it here, because I will not ruin it for you. This is my favorite Kevin Smith film for one reason: It's REAL. It hits so close to home because I (as well as many other people) have had a relationship similar to the one between Holden and Alyssa. This movie is for anyone who has every felt insignificant or insecure in a relationship. The movie is honest and is not afraid to face defeat. Many people call it a romantic comedy, which it is not. Also, this is not a film about homosexuality. Alyssa's sexuality is merely a plot-point, which is proved by the fact that so many people can relate to this movie without dating a lesbian. This movie is basically a Kevin Smith drama. It has it's funny moments (and when they come around, they are hilarious, especially a conversation about Archie & Jughead's sexuality). Aside from it's light moments, its a very heavy film, and anyone who has ever experienced anything remotely similar will be glued to the screen. Kevin Smith is a master at dialogue. It's been said before that he is a lousy director and he can only set up the simplest of shots, but that's not the point. He knows his characters, he gets inside, and this is definetly his best movie to date. The DVD is excellent as well. It contains over a half-hour of deleted scenes and a very light-hearted, unconventional commentary. I recommend all Kevin Smith fans who have not seen it go out and buy this movie.

I started with Dogma (which was ok), then saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike back (which I didn't like).  So, not knowing Chasing Amy was a Kevin Smith movie helped.  I went in with no expectations.It's a story about a guy named Holden (Ben Affleck). He lives with his buddy, Banky (Jason Lee), and they write comic books together. Holden meets Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams) and basically falls head over heels for her.  Soon, however, he finds out she's a lesbian. At first, he's crushed and disappointed. But she sees something in him, and convinces him that they can be friends.  Somewhere in the middle of being friends, he falls in love with her.  The rest of the story was kind of a surprise for me, so I won't go any further.  (You have to watch this.)Writer/director Kevin Smith is definitely a talented writer: his dialogue, for the most part, is very realistic and often hilarious. I think he really knows how to effectively capture this generation in words and actions. However, I felt he could've done a better job in directing. With such great actors at his disposal, most of his scenes sort of come out amateurish. Although dialogue is a big part of this film, I felt the actors could've done more to draw the attention away from the fact that some passages are long, winded and preachy.  That, I believe, is the responsibility of the director to find and fix.This is not to say the actors couldn't have done a better job. Sometimes, they're not as convincing as they can be. Affleck was decent, but he just looked to me like a guy who was acting (reading from a script). It wasn't bad, but it just didn't convince me. Adams was better, but her voice sounded strange when she was upset, and I was mostly caught up in the hoarseness of her voice instead of what she was saying. I can tell these are good actors though. They just need some more work.The film is really funny.  I find myself rewinding and viewing scenes over and over again. Then some parts get pretty serious towards the end, and then the laughs are few and far between. I was kind of disappointed with the ending though. I don't want to give it away, so I'll keep it at that.Having said all that, I'm sure the reader will find it a blast to watch this funny and poignant film.",5,I loved this film!,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,2341,"['3rd', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'films', 'odd', 'order', 'started', 'Dogma', 'was', 'ok', 'then', 'saw', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Strike', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'So', 'not', 'knowing', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movie', 'helped', 'went', 'expectations.It', 'story', 'guy', 'named', 'Holden', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'buddy', 'Banky', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'write', 'comic', 'books', 'together', 'Holden', 'meets', 'Alyssa', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'basically', 'falls', 'head', 'heels', 'Soon', 'however', 'out', 'lesbian', 'first', 'crushed', 'disappointed', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'friends', 'Somewhere', 'middle', 'being', 'friends', 'love', 'rest', 'story', 'was', 'kind', 'surprise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'have', 'watch', 'Writer/director', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'definitely', 'talented', 'writer', 'dialogue', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'realistic', 'often', 'hilarious', 'think', 'really', 'how', 'effectively', 'capture', 'generation', 'words', 'actions', 'However', 'felt', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'job', 'directing', 'such', 'great', 'actors', 'disposal', 'most', 'scenes', 'sort', 'come', 'out', 'amateurish', 'dialogue', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'felt', 'actors', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'fact', 'passages', 'are', 'long', 'winded', 'preachy', 'believe', 'responsibility', 'director', 'find', 'fix.This', 'not', 'say', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'Sometimes', ""'re"", 'not', 'as', 'convincing', 'can', 'be', 'Affleck', 'was', 'decent', 'just', 'looked', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'acting', 'reading', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'convince', 'Adams', 'was', 'better', 'voice', 'sounded', 'strange', 'when', 'was', 'upset', 'was', 'mostly', 'caught', 'up', 'hoarseness', 'voice', 'instead', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'just', 'need', 'more', 'work.The', 'film', 'really', 'funny', 'find', 'rewinding', 'viewing', 'scenes', 'over', 'again', 'Then', 'parts', 'get', 'pretty', 'serious', 'end', 'then', 'laughs', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'that.Having', 'said', ""'m"", 'sure', 'reader', 'will', 'find', 'blast', 'watch', 'funny', 'poignant', 'film']",Chasing Amy VHS

431928,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304681526,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Much smarter than I thought it would be, `Chasing Amy' truly has a lot going for it; not the least of which happens to be its attractive star couple.  The film is no where near the low-brow comedy it could have been, but it actually transcends its very own abrasive subject to tap into something very substantial and very honest about human relationships, whether it be male/female, male/male or female/female.`Chasing Amy' is actually a really good movie.Holden and Banky are comic book artists.  At a convention they happen to run into Alyssa Jones, a fellow comic book artist who happens to catch Holden's eye.  Convinced they shared a moment and that she is in love with him, Holden pursues Alyssa only to uncover that she is playing for the `other team'.  Despite slim chances that they would ever `hook up', Holden and Alyssa become great friends and soon fall in love.  Their new relationship proves to be a difficult transition for the two of them, surprisingly more difficult for Holden than he expected.  As he starts hearing twisted stories from her past, of her past relationships and past `experiences' he begins to feel as if maybe, just maybe, this relationship won't work.And soon he finds himself `chasing Amy'.While the film follows a similar romantic comedy formula (boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy gets with girl, boy loses girl) it has a few aces up its sleeve that make it a little more than that.First of all, the performances for the most part are really good, at times even superb.  Joey Lauren Adams is a complete revelation as Alyssa, a gem of an actress who is so charming and so sincere and so genuine.  I'm ashamed that she didn't receive an Oscar nomination for this, but then again this is the type of film and or performances that rarely gets more than a Golden Globe nomination (which she did receive).  Ben Affleck works some of the time, but at times the films dialog can trip him up.  When he's not being witty he loses himself in the syrupy parts of the film.  Jason Lee is playing the same character he plays quite often, but he's hysterical so why complain.  I also thought that Dwight Ewell was very, very funny here.Second, the film is much smarter than one would generally think.  Yes, the film has some frank dialog that can come off as rather offensive, but it is not without purpose.  This is a serious and smart look at relationships from the young adult perspective.  There is lots of language and lots of off-color references, but none of it seems out of place because this is the audience it is reaching for.  It all seems very, very real.  The insight into love is remarkably handled here, especially when the subject of virginity is broached.  There is a tenderness that permeates the conversation despite the blunt way of speaking.The film has a few issues with the script, or should I say some of the dialog, but it's minor.  Like I said, Affleck tends to get tripped up when he's trying to be sincere, but those moments are not predominant enough to really take away from the film.  Adams is usually there moving him along and keeping us entirely devoted to her.She keeps us `chasing Alyssa'.",5,A much smarter approach to the world of relationships than I expected...,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,3155,"['Much', 'smarter', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'truly', 'lot', 'going', 'not', 'least', 'be', 'attractive', 'star', 'couple', 'film', 'where', 'low-brow', 'comedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'actually', 'very', 'own', 'abrasive', 'subject', 'tap', 'something', 'very', 'substantial', 'very', 'honest', 'human', 'relationships', 'be', 'male/female', 'male/male', 'female/female.', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'movie.Holden', 'Banky', 'are', 'comic', 'book', 'artists', 'convention', 'happen', 'run', 'Alyssa', 'Jones', 'fellow', 'comic', 'book', 'artist', 'who', 'catch', 'Holden', 'eye', 'Convinced', 'shared', 'moment', 'love', 'Holden', 'Alyssa', 'only', 'uncover', 'playing', 'other', 'team', 'slim', 'chances', 'would', 'ever', 'hook', 'up', 'Holden', 'Alyssa', 'become', 'great', 'friends', 'soon', 'fall', 'love', 'new', 'relationship', 'be', 'difficult', 'transition', 'two', 'surprisingly', 'more', 'difficult', 'Holden', 'expected', 'hearing', 'twisted', 'stories', 'past', 'past', 'relationships', 'past', 'experiences', 'feel', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'relationship', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work.And', 'soon', 'chasing', 'film', 'similar', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formula', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'falls', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'loses', 'girl', 'few', 'up', 'sleeve', 'make', 'little', 'more', 'that.First', 'performances', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'times', 'even', 'superb', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'complete', 'revelation', 'Alyssa', 'gem', 'actress', 'who', 'so', 'charming', 'so', 'sincere', 'so', 'genuine', ""'m"", 'ashamed', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'then', 'again', 'type', 'film', 'performances', 'rarely', 'more', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'did', 'receive', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'time', 'times', 'films', 'dialog', 'can', 'trip', 'up', 'When', 'not', 'being', 'syrupy', 'parts', 'film', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'quite', 'often', 'hysterical', 'so', 'why', 'complain', 'also', 'thought', 'Dwight', 'Ewell', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'here.Second', 'film', 'much', 'smarter', 'one', 'would', 'generally', 'think', 'Yes', 'film', 'frank', 'dialog', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'rather', 'offensive', 'not', 'purpose', 'serious', 'smart', 'look', 'relationships', 'young', 'adult', 'perspective', 'lots', 'language', 'lots', 'off-color', 'references', 'none', 'place', 'audience', 'reaching', 'very', 'very', 'real', 'insight', 'love', 'remarkably', 'handled', 'here', 'especially', 'when', 'subject', 'virginity', 'broached', 'tenderness', 'conversation', 'blunt', 'way', 'speaking.The', 'film', 'few', 'issues', 'script', 'should', 'say', 'dialog', 'minor', 'said', 'Affleck', 'get', 'tripped', 'up', 'when', 'trying', 'be', 'sincere', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'predominant', 'enough', 'really', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'Adams', 'usually', 'moving', 'along', 'keeping', 'entirely', 'devoted', 'her.She', 'keeps', 'chasing', 'Alyssa']",Chasing Amy VHS

Affleck's intelligence, earnestness, and romanticism make Armageddon look like a bad dream, while Joey's the feisty heroine we girls wish we were, and Jason Lee takes a relatively thankless role and turns Banky into a wholly sympathetic, understandable, confused, and lovable loner who's desperate in the face if being displaced by his best friend's first real love affair.  (Prediction: One of these days Lee will leave Affleck in the dust.)It's a great film -- wonderfully written and acted, and the characters' declarations of love are surprisingly sweet and literate, and worth going back  a track or to on that DVD button for a second viewing.But the ""special edition DVD"" is a rank disappointment.  Sure, it's loaded with stuff (most of it from the previous Criterion laser release from years ago -- ironically, the commentary opens with a loud diss by Smith & co. on the 'fad' of DVD's and how they will quickly fade), but too bad most of it bites.The Director's Commentary is the biggest surprise -- it's awful.While I drooled at the idea of listening to someone as smart and funny as Smith is commenting on his film, what I got was a barely coherent mumblefest from Smith, Mewes, Affleck, and buddies.  (I mean, come on, this from the Smith who once beautifully analyzed ""A Man for All Seasons"" for the New York Times?)  The guys instead spend most of the two hours making noises at one another, and are evidently not even watching the movie they're supposed to be commenting on.  The group sounds blitzed, most of the commentary has nothing to do with the film (and Mewes especially is in ""Jay"" mode, embarrassingly unaware of what's going on onscreen in front of them, a fact Smith and Affleck exploit throughout the commentary).I love the movie, and don't think anyone should miss it.  But I spent the extra bucks on the ""special edition"" and felt robbed.  Don't make the same mistake, and spend the extra bucks on a ""special"" edition that's frankly not so special.

But how many movies have started with a great ten minutes, only to fall  into a memory hole and never be heard from again?  Remember DOCTOR DETROIT?  It's almost as if the Hollywood moguls read the first few pages and make  their decision.  After the opening sequence, the problem in CHASING AMY  was: &quot;what kind of a movie is this?&quot;  Previous reviewers call it  a comedy, a romance, a psychological exploration of relationships, a  comment on lesbianism, etc.  It appears unfortunately that the author never  figured out what it was.  The movie contains one of the best acting jobs  I've seen in a long time--Joey Lauren Adams' portrayal of the  &quot;Amy&quot; prototype.  She portrayed, in a series of dazzling  changes, the gamut of emotions, the highs and lows of great comedic  performances reminding us of Carole Lombard.  In a way she is the whole  movie--she has all the contradictions that the script has.  But what goes  seriously wrong is the characterization of her boy friend.  The author was  obviously torn between a &quot;straight man&quot; approach -- I mean this  in the vaudevillian sense, as someone who sets up Ms. Adams so that she can  shine -- and a &quot;straight guy,&quot; meaning a bourgeois nebbish who  happens to be handsome and happens to have a cool job and happens to wear  trendy clothes.  You just can't get into his character at all.  I felt like  shouting at the DVD, &quot;Go read a couple of books, you dum-dum; maybe  that will help you get over your annoying, cloying bourgeois  mentality.&quot;  The guy really doesn't have a clue, and &quot;Amy&quot;  has to teach him everything.  But on the positive side, we were not given a  sappy ending.  &quot;Amy&quot; and this nerd were really not meant for each  other, and I cheered when they didn't get together in the end.  She really  deserved someone with at least half her intelligence.  Bottom line: you're  probably going to like this movie, but start out with a high tolerance for  the script.

431938,AE0E6UII0VSZA,6304681526,Blake Kleiner,"[3, 4]","Being in love is not a funny business. Far from it, there's absolutely nothing funny about being in love. Kevin Smith knows that, and demonstrates it with &quot;Chasing Amy,&quot; a film of insightfulness and hilarity rolled up like one of Jay and Silent Bob's joints. This is a film of unparalleled comedic high, getting back to the simplicity of &quot;Clerks,&quot; abandoning the studio element that brought down &quot;Mallrats&quot; from true greatness. It's a wonderful film that really shows Kevin Smith at his best; he knows people, dialogue, and more importantly, he knows what it's like to be a guy with all the stupid insecurities we have.Ben Affleck plays Holden McNeil in what will probably be his best performance until the next Kevin Smith movie puts him in a role like this. It's a tricky part because he goes through the biggest changes in the movie, but we always believe him. And when Holden falls head over heels for a pretty woman with the voice of a little girl begging for a pony named Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), things get really heated up between him and his best friend of 20 years, Banky (Jason Lee, in what I believed to be the best supporting performance of 1997). But things between this triangle aren't normal by any stretch because of a few simple but huge facts: Alyssa is a lesbian, through and through, and Banky could possibly be a self-loathing gay himself (a question never truly answered or directly addressed). This is all tense enough between them all, but it's when news of a possible 2 on 1 guy to girl group grope that Alyssa partook in surfaces that the movie takes on its true meaning. Holden isn't bothered by Alyssa being a lesbian turned hetero by any means, but the thought of her with men, having tons of experience makes him feel small, insecure, and downright weird. Why? All is revealed in the film, mostly during a scene with Jay and Silent Bob; yes, the scene everyone waits for is the second most pivotal scene in the film as Silent Bob finally opens up and we get a glimpse of the life so shrouded in muteness. Kevin Smith is perfect in his speech to Affleck, delivering every line like a memory recalled instead of dialogue written. If the message of the movie wasn't apparent before, it becomes obvious then, and it's perfect.Yeah, I make all of this sound serious, but the movie is as funny as any I've ever seen, ranking right up next to &quot;Clerks,&quot; only surpassed by &quot;Dogma.&quot; There are the usual &quot;Star Wars&quot; gags, most of which delivered in a hysterical speech from a wonderful character named Hooper (another homage to Steven Spielberg's brilliant &quot;Jaws&quot;), who we learn is a &quot;reviled gay man, and to top that off he's a gay black man.&quot; The scene comes second in a series of relentlessly funny sequences that only take a halt for that incredibly touching scene in the stopped vehicle. Throughout the rest of the film, Smith's characters argue the sexuality of the Archie comics, compare injuries gained in assortedly hilarious shenanigans, ask questions with the tact of an SAT booklet, and discover skeeball. From start to finish funny, and constantly sprinkled with wonderful bits of emotion, &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; is a comedy in a class of its own: The Kevin Smith Class, which to date has only five films in it.

It's not pretty. There's a lot of comedy in it, but some scenes are just hard to watch, they're so raw.  If you don't like that kind of thing, pass this by.  It makes no apologies for its subject matter. (I have difficulty imagining many people buy the high-end DVD of a movie sight unseen, though, so the rest of this review assumes you've seen the film.)If you liked the movie somewhat, you might find the DVD worthwhile. Some of the scenes that were cut showed character development that might enrich your experience.If you liked the movie a lot, this DVD is indispensible. The cut-scenes, the trailers, the info, all adds to the experience.If you're looking at this DVD in terms of what you can learn about the film-making process from the commentary track, well, you could probably do better. The commentary track is great fun--six guys in a room who talk constantly about whatever's on their mind, occasionally referencing some part of the film--but there's not exactly a wealth of information about things like camera angles (a lot of running gags about how the director never moves the camera, though), set-ups, staging, whatever. There is some good stuff about cameras and quite a bit of good material on the acting. But it's not exactly, say, Mel Gibson's commentary on &quot;Braveheart&quot;.All-in-all, I was personally pleased enough with this to put the DVDs for &quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;Dogma&quot; and &quot;Mallrats&quot; on my wish-list.",4,Excellent presentation of a difficult movie.,988848000,"05 3, 2001",2001,1641,"['old', 'laserdisc', 'stuff', 'moved', 'DVD', 'format', 'packed', 'great', 'stuff.First', 'movie', 'one', 'man', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'lover', 'sexual', 'history', 'not', 'pretty', 'lot', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'hard', 'watch', ""'re"", 'so', 'raw', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'kind', 'thing', 'pass', 'apologies', 'subject', 'matter', 'have', 'difficulty', 'imagining', 'many', 'people', 'buy', 'high-end', 'DVD', 'movie', 'sight', 'unseen', 'though', 'rest', 'review', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'liked', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'might', 'find', 'DVD', 'worthwhile', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'showed', 'character', 'development', 'might', 'enrich', 'experience.If', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'DVD', 'indispensible', 'cut-scenes', 'trailers', 'info', 'experience.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'DVD', 'terms', 'what', 'can', 'learn', 'film-making', 'process', 'commentary', 'track', 'well', 'could', 'probably', 'do', 'better', 'commentary', 'track', 'great', 'fun', 'six', 'guys', 'room', 'who', 'talk', 'constantly', 'mind', 'occasionally', 'referencing', 'part', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'wealth', 'information', 'things', 'camera', 'angles', 'lot', 'running', 'gags', 'how', 'director', 'never', 'camera', 'though', 'set-ups', 'staging', 'good', 'stuff', 'cameras', 'quite', 'bit', 'good', 'material', 'acting', 'not', 'exactly', 'say', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'commentary', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', '.All-in-all', 'was', 'personally', 'pleased', 'enough', 'put', 'DVDs', 'quot', 'Clerks', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dogma', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mallrats', 'quot', 'wish-list']",Chasing Amy VHS

431946,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304681526,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","Let's Be FriendsLet's be friends. Don't you hate to hear those two words and one contraction? Ouch. You have been placed firmly in the 'friend' bag and there is no way out. I bet you that auteur Kevin Smith has been there, many times, but he found a way out! Yes, behind-the-scenes gossip says that he was dating Joey Lauren Adams while directing this little indy romcom. Why wasn't she with her co-star, the handsome Ben Affleck? Or even Jason Lee, long before he was the star of My Name is Earl or even the remake of Alvin and the Chipmonks? It boggles the mind! Plus Kevin Smith is fat. He even made a bet with Ethan Suplee, who plays a fanboy in Chasing Amy, and is now also on My Name is Earl with Jason Lee, where Ethan plays Earl's fat and not-too-bright brother, Randy. The bet was who could lose the most weight over a ten year period. And Kevin Smith lost that bet. To fat Randy? Yet he still managed to date Joey Lauren Adams? Dude. That is all. Just, dude. What more can you say?I will say that Kevin Smith loves New Jersey, Star Wars, Jaws, comic books (he has even written scripts for Marvel), Quick Stops, Malls, and he must love Catcher in the Rye, since he named Affleck's character (a comic artist from New Jersey, naturally) Holden. He appears in his own movies as Silent Bob, where his sidekick Jay does most of the talking. But when Silent Bob does speak, people listen. I was wondering why the movie was called Chasing Amy when Joey Lauren Adams' character was named Allysa Jones? But as Silent Bob explains, Amy is the perfect woman with a past that causes you to turn away, but you regret it, and wind up chasing Amy.In spite of the comic book aspect of Chasing Amy, it is actually a very sophisticated romantic comedy with penetrating character analysis, witty dialogue, and it takes the standard romcom boy-meets-girl plot and twists it in a most unusual fashion.Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) combines astute psychological assessments with a crude manner of expression that is refreshing in its candor. One can't help thinking of auteur Smith, also fathoming the depths of his demographic, and analyzing his audience, i.e. you and I, as we watch his film. Holden's banter with cute female comic artist Allysa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) is some of the sharpest thrust-and-parry we've seen on a romcom turf in quite some time. My only quibble is that he tried a bit too hard to be cool, and as a result, mumbled what I assume were some great lines that I couldn't understand, even after multiple rewinds. E-nun-ci-ate, please, while still making it seem natural and spontaneous. Talk to your pal, Matt Damon, about it (who by the way makes a cameo appearance as a media mogul interested in making Holden's underground comic Bluntman and Chronic into an animated series).Also a delight is Hooper (Dwight Ewell), a Black comic artist who trades in Black Rage, but is actually a Black Gay man who delights in tweaking Holden's partner, inker Banky Edwards, with his theory that Archie and Jughead are gay, not to mention that old queen Mr. Weatherbee. How else to explain his conflicted emotions, which is why Archie could never make up his mind between Betty or Veronica? Hooper is also good for the occasional withering comment, but Banky and Holden give as good as they get, masters as they are of the single entendre.Joey Lauren Adams is cute, hot, and very believable. She has a strange voice but like Jennifer Tilly, it grows on you, and is an integral part of her charm package. She sings well, too, and in a pivotal scene in Meow Mix, an underground nightclub, she sings a love song that she herself wrote. It is a good song, and is also the moment where Holden first realizes that she isn't addressing him, but rather, the blonde girl to his side.BoundBoys on the SideBeing John MalkovichMona LisaGigliAlmost FamousClerks (Collector's Series)Mallrats (Collector's Edition)Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (Dimension Collector's Series)Alyssa: Why are we stopping?Holden: 'Cause I can't take this.Alyssa: Can't take what?Holden: I love you.Alyssa: You love me?Holden: I love you.

I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. I can't-I can't look into your eyes without feeling that-that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are.

And if bringing this to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me. But God, I just, I couldn't allow another day to go by without just getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot-down. And, you know, I'll accept that. But I know, I know that some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there's a moment of hesitation, then that means you feel something too. And all I ask, please, is that you just - you just not dismiss that, and try to dwell in it for just ten seconds. Alyssa, there isn't another soul on this ******* planet who has ever made me half the person I am when I'm with you, and I would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau. Because it is there between you and me. You can't deny that. Even if, you know, even if we never talk again after tonight, please know that I am forever changed because of who you are and what you've meant to me, which - while I do appreciate it - I'd never

Which they actually doing the same thing in the world of comic books, they love doing. Holden starts to be really into her, ... When Holden begin his relationship with her. Holden's best friend and inker of his comic book-Banky (Jason Lee) before distant to him and Banky becomes jealous and possesive for more than platonic reasons. Love/Hate/Relationship between Holden and Alyssa become something more than that.Written and Directed by Kevin Smith (Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back, Jersey Girl) made a Clever, Original, Comedy/Drama with a Dynamite story between Friendship, Relationship and Love.Affleck & Adams are Perfect in this. Lee is also great as Holden's long time buddy. This independent film ended up being a Box Office Hit. It's a winning film all around and it's offers something different for a change. DVD's has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and with an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD Extras:There's a entertaining commentary track by Director:Smith, Producer:Scott Moiser (Clerks, Mallrats), Actors:Affleck (Changing Lanes) and Jason Mewes, Associate Producer:Robert Hawk, Miramax Executive:Jon Gordon and View Askew:Vincent Pereria. Ten Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and More. This is Smith's best work as a film director and it shows you how Smith could and can be good as a filmmaker. An Excellent Job well done.

However, you need to believe Kevin Smith when he tells you that the  Criterion Collection Chasing Amy is worth the extra couple of bucks.  I  have been a fan of this movis for a long time, and I was blown away by the  deleted scenes (of which there were atleast ten) and the commentary by the  young, funny cast.

431949,AS558SNWF1DXG,6304681526,Clare Quilty,"[19, 27]","but I really hated this movie.I think it's full of promise that quite simply goes unfulfilled, and I am astonished that so many people feel as passionately positive as they do about it.And don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people that loves to dislike stuff just to be contrary; i'm not one of those [people] who writes negative reviews just for the ""pleasure"" of raining on the parade... Too many people have told me how wrong I am, how I missed the point, how this little gem somehow escaped me. I've watched it six times. I've listened to the commentary track on the DVD. I even had the pleasure of hearing Kevin Smith give an informal chat a couple years ago, and he had some great, interesting things to say about the film.But the movie just doesn't work for me for several distinct reasons.First of all, these are some really interesting characters. They're artists who have made some success for themselves. And yet most of what they talk about boils down to: ""wow, a straight guy is in love with a lesbian, what DOES this mean?"" During the course of the movie, they discuss little else.Banky and Holden view homosexuality on about a fifth grade level. It's like neither one of them have ever been out of the house before. With so little knowledge of the world, how did they ever find such a cool place to live? The extent of their ignorance is pretty ridiculous and unconvincing.Yes, I know, their limitations serve the story so that Holden can see the light and learn something at the end... but what he learns is the kind of pat lesson that's usually followed by the expression, ""Duh...""And, yes, I know there are people like Banky and Holden all over the place. That doesn't mean I want to see a movie about idiots.On the flip side, the ideas the movie puts forward about homosexuality are smug, simplistic and self-serving. And the movie doesn't play straight with the issues, either, because in the end the thing that comes between Holden and Alyssa isn't the fact that she's a lesbian; what really comes between them is the fact that Alyssa used to have wild sex with guys Holden didn't like. So, basically, the whole homosexuality subtext gets the ""bait-and-switch"" treatment and that makes the whole movie ring false.Like I said, these are interesting characters. It's a shame they aren't given something real to talk about. Instead, they mug, they ACT up a storm in the parking lot, they do schtick, they do the montage thing, they throw darts at a target that appears to be three feet off the floor....But I've argued my points with fans of the movie across so many tables, I've seen Janet Maslin congratulate Quentin Tarantino on TV for having the good sense to like ""Chasing Amy,"" and I've been subjected to the shaking heads of people who mutter, ""It's a great movie, man, you just don't get it.""I do get it.

431950,A231ZCJGWZA38A,6304681526,"Claude Bouchard ""Eurodancemix""","[31, 35]","It's no surprise that this movie was never the box officesuccess that it should have been: this film is much too deep and truthful for average audiences.  Kevin Smith provides some incredible insights about people and relationships, but most folks don't want to think when they go to the movies and would much prefer to see pulpy schmaltz about characters overcoming their idiotic superficial differences and living happily ever after.I won't sum up the movie as other reviewers have done a great job of that here.  Two things that I wish to comment on, however: 1) The &quot;F&quot; word is used extensively here, some will say overused, as is explicit sexual dialog.  If you're watching with children (despite the R rating), you are hereby warned.  2) This film has two of the most touching and emotional moments I've seen in a contemporary movie: Holden's declaration of love to Alyssa in the car (Affleck's delivery is so honest and true and impassioned that you will practically feel his nervous relief when he finally tells her) and Alyssa's tearful speech when she realizes that she must leave him (this portion of the script is brilliant and Alyssa's deep hard-hitting dialog could only have been written by someone who's been there).On to the technical aspects of the disc -- The audio is absolutely perfect: not too loud, not too soft, the dialog/music/sound effects are all perfectly balanced.  This is one of a small handful of DVD's where you can set the volume once and you don't need to constantly adjust it.  (DVD producers should take note of this!  There's nothing more annoying than having to crank up the volume because the dialog is too soft, only to have the house rattle once the music or sound effects kick in.)  The video is a bit grainy at times, something I find very surprising coming from a contemporary Criterion release.  This is minor, considering the excellence of the story itself.The deleted scenes are interesting and funny.  The commentary is good, but because it's a group effort, it can get annoying when everyone's trying to speak at once or when they don't stick to the on-screen action.  Small doses are recommended for this one.  Finally, the outtakes are funny, but too few.In all, it's rare to see such an intelligent contemporary movie.  This is a DVD worth owning.",5,CAN IT BE?

431951,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6304681526,"Cloud ""...""","[5, 7]","In the liner notes, Kevin Smith mentions that Clerks got overpraised(which I agree with) while his follow-up Mallrats was outright bashed so really Chasing Amy is in a perfect position: it won't be massively critically acclaimed and thus named overrated and it won't be worse than what people thought of Mallrats. Well it's a good thing it worked out that way since it's sharply-written with good performances that also deals with an odd-but-present subject matter.Holden and Banky are comic-book artists in charge of the successful Bluntman and Chronic series, inspired by Kevin Smith film mascots Jay and Silent Bob. At a comic convention, Holden meets Alyssa, a cute quirky girl that he gets instantly smitten with. However he finds out a crushing truth: she's a lesbian. And worst of all: she has a bit more of a sexually active past than he thought which he isn't dealing with that well.There's this girl that I used to be in love with(but unfortunately it was unrequited but nevermind) who had more of an active past than I did, although not as bad as Alyssa's. So in that way I can identify with Holden since while I don't have a Marco Polo complex like a character in the film mentions, I do get a bit jealous when one has more experience than I have. The film was based around Kevin Smith's real-life relationship with star Joey Lauren Adams and the film has a better impact when you see it played out.Now for a film based primarily around 2 people's obsession with all things sex, there's actually barely any. Instead of a few quick shots during flashbacks and a girl partially naked only from the back it's relatively sex-free. But the language? It's overloaded. There's frank talk about oral sex, mainly to women(including a scene obviously inspired by Jaws) so this is obviously not going to be a film for kids. Clerks/Mallrats fans might be disappointed at the lack of raunchyness but the film works better because of it.Where the film slightly falters is its extra features.

I had to drive over an hour away from home to see this film in the only theater it was playing in Atlanta. And I was not disappointed. At least not at first.I trust everyone knows the synopsis and characters by now, so I will skip it. I've read many of the reviews and have found none that point to the best scene of the film. Immediately after finding out Alyssa's sexuality, there is a scene between Banky and Alyssa primarily where they discuss sexual wounds. The scene is a clear homage to Spielberg's ""Jaws;"" the scene in which Hooper and Quint share sea-faring injuries. I remember laughing hysterically as I watched it, because I had seen Jaws only a few nights earlier.Unfortunately, Smith's obvious love of film has not enabled him to develop a plot sense. As with ""Dogma,"" this film captures you early with its sharp dialogue and intriguing characters, only to fall apart when conflict resolution arises. I would have been much happier with an even more depressing ending, if the theme of the movie was developed through the plot first and the characters second. But alas, Smith's writing is still not quite sophisticated enough to always tie up all the loose ends.(Hooper X just disappears)On the positive side, Smith has become a much better actor since ""Clerks"" and that makes his scene much more enjoyable to watch.

431956,AODDKGNNV7AG2,6304681526,"Cult DVD Hunter ""Rico""","[4, 7]","This movie is hands down my favorite movie of all time because I have never been able to find a movie that made me laugh, cry, and call my ex-girlfriend and tell her how much I miss her all in the same 90 minutes.  To others it may not seem like that significant a film, but sometimes a movie just touches you, and in its own graphic content kind of way this movie did just that.Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) had it all: he had a successful comic book, he had a nice apartment in Red Bank, he had a hefty paycheck coming in, and his best friend Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) was his partner and roommate.  The only thing Holden didn't have was a girlfriend...and then he met Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams).  She was everything Holden wanted: young, cute, sexual, a comic book artist; but she was also something he never expected.  The hardest part about getting over your biggest crush, is when she turns you down because she's a lesbian.  A long friendship occurs as a result with Banky getting jealous that he's now on the back burner.  To make matters worse, Banky comes home one day to find Holden and Alyssa naked on his couch.  How do you bring your life together when your best friends hates the girl you love and the girl you love isn't into your kind?The storyline is quite original and when it first came out, completely blew me away in concept.  The hard part is to tackle the subject without being stereotypical (we all know Kevin Smith is strait and even if he was gay, he'd never be a lesbian), however Kevin Smith does a pretty decent job capturing what it would be like being good friends with a lesbian.  It was a little shocking when Alyssa eventually goes for Holden, but once they bring up her past and come to terms with her ideal partner (good character development on Kevin Smith's part) it gets safely explained away.  The performances by Joey Lauren Adams and Ben Affleck are truely a little overplayed (Ben, this hangs more on you) however the chemistry between them seems strong and sincere (which is pretty impressive considering Kevin Smith was dating Joey Lauren Adams during this movie).  The scene stealer for this film is Jason Lee, hands down, who takes center stage as the quirky and possibly gay best friend with a witty comeback for any situation.  Other noteable supporting roles was the incredible talent of Dwight Ewell as the black queen Hooper X (who cracks any first time watcher up within the first five minutes of the movie) and the minor presence of Ethan Suplee again playing a Smith banter character.  Smith's classic comedy co-stars such as Scott Mosier (producer) playing the guy who points out too much in a situation (you're a tracer!) and of course Smith himself along with Jason Mewes playing as the dynamic duo Jay and Silent Bob.  For once in his series, however, Jay and Silent Bob don't steal the stage and I feel the romance and conflict of the movie keep focus in a very controlled manner.  For the budget he had and the subject of the script I have to admit that Kevin Smith made a masterpiece to those hopeless romantics out there.As for the DVD, it was a really nice in both quality and chock full of extras (which is nothing unique or new for a Kevin Smith movie or a Criterion Collection).  I have read other people's reviews concerning the grainy quality of the movie for a DVD and I would like to retort explaining that the movie looks like that for only one reason.  I heard a really stupid explanation that said it was because the master was from the Laserdisc copy, however that isn't true it's just the commentary that was taken from the Laserdisc, if it had been the movie would look BLURRY and not GRAINY.  The reason for the grain is simple: they had to use a cheaper filmstock, if not for budget reasons then for aesthetic reasons, either way anyone who has used film before will tell you that the result is a grain over the film.  You'll notice that Clerks looks even worse because he was using cheap black & white 16mm filmstock and the reason Mallrats as well as Dogma and JASBSB looks clean and crisp are because they were big budget feature films not funded by Miramax and using crisp clean 35mm filmstock.  The sound is crisp and clean, everything you want from a DVD and there are plenty of great moments in the commentary as well as deleted scenes and featurettes that make this truly a complete package.  Any fan of cult, independent, romantic comedies, and dirty humor should at least see this film and given the large price drop (original MSRP was $32.99) this is a must have!",5,"It May Not Be Perfect, But Kevin Smith Got It",1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,4558,"['movie', 'hands', 'down', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'movie', 'made', 'cry', 'call', 'ex-girlfriend', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'miss', 'same', '90', 'minutes', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'significant', 'film', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'just', 'touches', 'own', 'graphic', 'content', 'kind', 'way', 'movie', 'did', 'just', 'that.Holden', 'McNeil', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'had', 'had', 'successful', 'comic', 'book', 'had', 'nice', 'apartment', 'Red', 'Bank', 'had', 'hefty', 'paycheck', 'coming', 'best', 'friend', 'Banky', 'Edwards', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'was', 'partner', 'roommate', 'only', 'thing', 'Holden', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'was', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'met', 'Alyssa', 'Jones', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'was', 'everything', 'Holden', 'wanted', 'young', 'cute', 'sexual', 'comic', 'book', 'artist', 'was', 'also', 'something', 'never', 'expected', 'hardest', 'part', 'getting', 'biggest', 'crush', 'when', 'down', 'lesbian', 'long', 'friendship', 'result', 'Banky', 'getting', 'jealous', 'now', 'back', 'burner', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Banky', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'Holden', 'Alyssa', 'naked', 'couch', 'How', 'do', 'bring', 'life', 'together', 'when', 'best', 'friends', 'girl', 'love', 'girl', 'love', ""n't"", 'kind', 'storyline', 'quite', 'original', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'completely', 'away', 'concept', 'hard', 'part', 'tackle', 'subject', 'being', 'stereotypical', 'know', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'strait', 'even', 'was', 'gay', ""'d"", 'never', 'be', 'lesbian', 'however', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'capturing', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'being', 'good', 'friends', 'lesbian', 'was', 'little', 'shocking', 'when', 'Alyssa', 'eventually', 'Holden', 'once', 'bring', 'up', 'past', 'come', 'terms', 'ideal', 'partner', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'part', 'safely', 'explained', 'away', 'performances', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'are', 'truely', 'little', 'overplayed', 'Ben', 'more', 'however', 'chemistry', 'strong', 'sincere', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'considering', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'dating', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'movie', 'scene', 'stealer', 'film', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'down', 'who', 'center', 'stage', 'quirky', 'possibly', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'witty', 'comeback', 'situation', 'Other', 'noteable', 'supporting', 'roles', 'was', 'incredible', 'talent', 'Dwight', 'Ewell', 'black', 'queen', 'Hooper', 'X', 'who', 'first', 'time', 'up', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'minor', 'presence', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'again', 'playing', 'Smith', 'banter', 'character', 'Smith', 'classic', 'comedy', 'co-stars', 'such', 'Scott', 'Mosier', 'producer', 'playing', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'situation', ""'re"", 'tracer', 'course', 'Smith', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'playing', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'once', 'series', 'however', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'stage', 'feel', 'romance', 'conflict', 'movie', 'keep', 'focus', 'very', 'controlled', 'manner', 'budget', 'had', 'subject', 'script', 'have', 'admit', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'made', 'masterpiece', 'hopeless', 'romantics', 'out', 'there.As', 'DVD', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'quality', 'chock', 'full', 'extras', 'nothing', 'unique', 'new', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movie', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'people', 'reviews', 'concerning', 'grainy', 'quality', 'movie', 'DVD', 'would', 'like', 'retort', 'explaining', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'heard', 'really', 'stupid', 'explanation', 'said', 'was', 'master', 'was', 'Laserdisc', 'copy', 'however', ""n't"", 'true', 'just', 'commentary', 'was', 'taken', 'Laserdisc', 'had', 'been', 'movie', 'would', 'look', 'BLURRY', 'not', 'GRAINY', 'reason', 'grain', 'simple', 'had', 'use', 'cheaper', 'filmstock', 'not', 'budget', 'reasons', 'then', 'aesthetic', 'reasons', 'way', 'anyone', 'who', 'used', 'film', 'before', 'will', 'tell', 'result', 'grain', 'film', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'Clerks', 'even', 'worse', 'was', 'using', 'cheap', 'black', 'white', '16mm', 'filmstock', 'reason', 'Mallrats', 'as', 'well', 'Dogma', 'JASBSB', 'clean', 'crisp', 'are', 'were', 'big', 'budget', 'feature', 'not', 'funded', 'Miramax', 'using', 'crisp', 'clean', '35mm', 'filmstock', 'sound', 'crisp', 'clean', 'everything', 'want', 'DVD', 'are', 'plenty', 'great', 'moments', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'make', 'complete', 'package', 'fan', 'cult', 'independent', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'dirty', 'humor', 'should', 'least', 'see', 'film', 'given', 'large', 'price', 'drop', 'original', 'MSRP', 'was', '32.99', 'must', 'have']",Chasing Amy VHS

However, Holden falls in love with her, and by some miracle of fate, ends up getting her as his girlfriend.

But after watching his fourth  movie, &quot;DOGMA&quot;, I had to check out the other movies he has done  and his third movie, &quot;CHASING AMY&quot; is quite intriguing.I must  admit that at first I didn't know what to expect from Kevin Smith in this  movie but after seeing the performances between Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren  Adams, all I can say is powerful.I've read that this movie was  low-budget ($200,000) to make, I think Kevin Smith and crew did a great  job!  I was impressed they had a digital 5.1 soundtrack and the video had  certain spots especially during the end of the rain scene and afterwards  but again, this is a low-budget movie and I'm not going to hold them on  that.  This is a very awesome movie and I have more respect for Smith and  his work now.  Awesome!As for the extras on this DVD, this is a  CRITERION COLLECTION and it has a lot of extras.  But the extras are from  the Laserdisc version.  In fact, the introduction included on this DVD is  Smith addressing a certain quote on the beginning commentary of the movie  regarding DVD on the LD commentary.  So, since I don't own the LD, I'm not  disappointed, although others maybe.  What I enjoyed about this movie  aside from the deleted scenes and the powerful acting is the commentary.

When Holden falls for Alyssa Jones it therants their realtionship. This storyline is played out excellent by the cast and each cast memeber has a scene stealing line.

Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;,"[0, 0]","This is simply one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking, but still funny (with Kevin Smith's insight and vulgarity all rolled together) films I've ever seen!  Ben Affleck plays Holden, a comic book artist who falls for fellow comic book artist, a lesbian named Alyssa...played brilliantly by Joey Lauren Adams.  Jason Lee plays Holden's business partner, Banky, who seems to have more trouble with his friend's relationship than you would expect if Banky was straight.  The scene where Holden proclaims his feelings for Alyssa is great, because she ""lets it slip"" that she feels the same way by flipping out, even though she professes to be gay.  Their short-lived affair is constantly landmined by Banky.  And the best scene in the movie is where Holden confronts Alyssa about her very experienced past, and they have a real screaming argument in the parking lot of a hockey game.  Dwight Ewell does a wonderful job in the role of Hooper, the gay friend who has to act like a militant Black Panther in order to sell his super hero comic book.  And the only scene that brings Jay and Silent Bob into the plot ties the whole movie together.  Though it is a love story, it is by no means just a chick flick.  The frank discussions of sex, relationships and life makes this movie very accessible to men.......and it is not for general audiences.  Very insightful writing.....the acting and directing are wonderful!  Great job by Kevin Smith......it's moving, but also hilarious.

In &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; he becomes his own man.This is a story about  real love--unconditional love -- the only kind of love there is. You don't  love someone because he or she does what you want them to do, you just love  them.  Unfortunately, some guys never figure this out.Although critics  persist in describing Amy as &quot;gay&quot; I don't think that's an  accurate characterization. I hate typing people.  Amy probably wouldn't  check the &quot;sex box&quot; on a questionnaire as homosexual, and neither  should the viewer. I think this is the main point of the film.Amy's  philosophy is you that you love whomever you love, and gender has nothing  to do with it. You love an individual, not a sex. Gee, it's so simple a  child could figure it out and most children do.

431967,A1VKT6RZ1T91I1,6304681526,Doug Hillman,"[3, 3]","Invariably, every movie reviewed here is claimed to be &quot;THE BEST MOVIE EVER&quot; by someone.  While that's an entirely subjective view, I can state that this is MY favorite nmovie.  This DVD version only enhances  my appreciation of this film.Even before it opened, this flick generated  controversy due to the overlying plot.  It garnered diametric reviews.  Very few people felt lukewarm about this movie (as seems to be the case  with all of Kevin Smith's films.)  You either loved it or hated it.  While  there's no accounting for taste, I'd venture to guess that most people who  hated it simply didn't &quot;get&quot; it.This movie is NOT, at its  heart, about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian.  It's about the  (usually male) insecurities that are brought into a relationship, and the  damage that they cause.  It's about the destruction of (again usually male)  friendships that a new relationship often brings.  It's about how lessons  are learned, usually too late.  Just about everyone I've watched this film  with is able to say, &quot;Yeah, I've done that.&quot;  Or, &quot;Yep,  that's happened to me.&quot;  Or, &quot;Ha!  I know exactly how he  feels.&quot;  Chaing Amy is the most realistic look at relationships that  I've ever seen.  I'd be willing to bet that most of the folks who didn't  &quot;get&quot; it, have never had a bad relationship or more likely never  had a relationship at all.The acting job by the leads is great.  Ben  Affleck is every guy.  A little overconfident, totally in love, willing to  do anything, and a complete and utter idiot because of it.  Joey Lauren  Adams shows that she's so much more than a disctinctive voice.  She has the  most powerful performances of the film, and it's obvious how much emotion  she put into them.The DVD is spectacular.  It's basically everything  from the previous laserdisk release, with a new intro in which Kevin Smith  explains his &quot;F@#% DVD&quot; comment on the commentary track.  The  commentary track alone is worth the price of the DVD.  It's easily the best  View Askew commentary so far.  The  banter between Smith &amp; Affleck is  hilarious.  Along the way they also explain some of the concepts behind the  film &amp; its meaning.  If the Chasing Amy detractors would watch this  commentary, it's likely that alot of them would see the movie in a new  light and change their tune.  Along with the commentary are 10 deleted  scenes.  Most are funny, but it's obvious why they were removed.  The  unused intro though, is classic and something that every Kevin Smith fan  needs to see.This is a comedic character/dialog driven movie.  If you  want an extremely intelligent witty human look at relationships, you'll  LOVE this movie.

It follows the story of a man named Holden McNeil as he enters a relationship with a woman named Alyssa who self identifies as a lesbian. Through the course of the film their relationship develops and he suffers through bouts of unrequited love that begins to take a toll on their ever growing relationship. Eventually, it comes to a head when the emotional attachment he feels can no longer go without being dealt with and things start to get pretty complex from there.I'm sure most of the reviews have already spoiled the film but there's a lot of layers to the conflicts present and despite the immature dialogue that peppers the script there is a wealth of mature themes that underlie the entire film. If you've ever been in love, you can understand the one scene where there is a heart wrenching profession of it and if you've ever felt like you've been out of your league then you'll understand when the film deals with those emotions in an honest and true way, as well.Holden McNeil feels real as a character and though his reactions might seem unrealistic to some, I've seen it played out a million times in a million different ways.

I mean, come on, how many movies have you seen where the basic plot is a lesiban becoming stright when she meets the right man, only to become a lesiban once again when asked by that man to be apart of a threesome with his bestfriend, who is possibly a homosexual.

What really makes this movie work is the romantic, yet comedic, plot.  Smith does not try to force a laugh down your throat every 2 seconds as he did in Mallrats.  Ben Affleck and Adams make a great couple in this movie.

431976,A2KACA2XFCGS8S,6304681526,Eric N. Gross,"[3, 4]","This one was Kevin Smith's personal gem.  He wanted to tell his story of poor judgment.  The conflict in this movie centers around a man being unable to accept his lover's sexual history.  The man is Holden McNeil (Affleck) who falls in love with a lesbian only to find out that she has a rather complicated past.  He is unable to deal with being sexually less experienced than she is, and this condition of the two being at different places on the road of sex eventually drives them apart.  Not a very funny or uplifting plot.But the dialogue is hilarious where it can be; just like Shakespeare fit humor into his tragedies, Smith can tactfully add comedy to keep people's spirits up.Anyone who has ever felt the pain of feeling sexually inadequate for their partner will resonate with this movie.  So too will those who have regretted judging others for their histories.The idea that a lesbian can fall in love with a man could be viewed as offensive to some homosexuals, but it has happened.  While I consider myself gay there is no guarantee that tomorrow I won't awaken and fall in love with a woman.

431978,AP18F4HV5L3BG,6304681526,face02,"[1, 3]","This is a film that I can watch over, and over (and do) and still get the same enjoyment out of.  I love all of Kevin Smith's movies, but this one is easily his best.  While all of the films (Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) have an amazing sense of humor, witty dialogue, and a touch of heart this one best showcases Kevin's heart.  In the other films, you have a sense that it is a comic fantasy - due to the ridiculously funny occurrences.  This film stays away from the slapstick humor, and stays real.Kevin Smith has a way with words.  That was proven in his very first film.  In all the other films, there was a hint of sweetness but not much more.  He outdoes himself in this film by providing the best dialogue of any of his films - giving the audience his trademark sense of humor in an emotionally thought provoking film.The film is basically about three people - Banky Edwards (Jason Lee), Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck), and Allysa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams).  Banky and Holden work together on a comic book hit, Bluntman and Chronic - which is based loosely on the lives of Smith's eccentric Jay and Silent Bob characters.  They have a good time hanging out, and working on the book together.... until they meet Allysa at a comic book convention.  Holden takes an immediate interest in Allysa - which is complicated by Allysa's homosexuality.  The rest of the movie deals with the &quot;love triangle&quot; between two good friends and a sexually experienced woman, ending with an amazing confrontation between the three with Holden making a very odd request to settle the troubles.  I have left out quite a bit, so as not to ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of viewing it.The film does feature the three career best performances from the main actors.  In just his second film, Jason Lee turns in a perfect performance with his unique style of delivering lines, and giving his character just the right amount of emotional depth.  Ben Affleck is amazing as well, and gives the viewer quite a bit to think about throughout the film.  He delivers perhaps the best speech I have seen in a film in to Allysa in a jeep in the rain.  Joey Lauren Adams, while not appearing in quite as many features as the other two actors, was also incredible.  Her skills were best displayed in the scene outside of the hockey rink, which Smith mentions in the commentary took quite a few takes and a lot of emotion to get correct.The dvd features some great extras.  While most Smith fans would recommend Mallrats as his best dvd, I would argue that this beats it hands down.  Not only because of the film itself, but because of the great bonus material.  Smith's dvds are known for their insightful, and extremely humorous, commentaries.  I have enjoyed the others, but I always felt as though there were too many people trying to talk at once.  This problem is solved here, because there are only a few people on the track, and most of the talking is done by Smith and Affleck.  They offer some great insight as to the making of the film, and as always offer quite a bit of humor along the way.The dvd also contains quite a few deleted scenes.  I usually feel as though deleted scenes are worth one watch, maybe two tops.  On this dvd, I keep going back to them.  Each scene has a little intro from Smith/Affleck, and is quite humorous on it's own.  A few of the scenes are as good as the film itself, and I am still puzzled as to why they were left out (even though Smith explains it in the intros).  The best example is &quot;Mata**Hari&quot;, where Affleck and Lee really let loose on each other, and give powerful performances.  It is probably my favorite scene in the film, and sadly it was left out.To sum it all up, if you are a Smith fan and you haven't seen this film yet - shame on you.  Buy two to make up for it.  For those who may have been turned off by the slapstick humor from Smith's other films, or those who are just looking for a great film with an amazing amount of humor and emotion, you won't find any better than this.",5,Kevin Smith's best work!,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,4081,"['film', 'can', 'watch', 'do', 'still', 'get', 'same', 'enjoyment', 'love', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movies', 'one', 'easily', 'best', 'films', 'Clerks', 'Mallrats', 'Dogma', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Strike', 'Back', 'have', 'amazing', 'sense', 'humor', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'touch', 'heart', 'one', 'best', 'Kevin', 'heart', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'sense', 'comic', 'fantasy', 'due', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'occurrences', 'film', 'away', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'real.Kevin', 'Smith', 'way', 'words', 'was', 'proven', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'other', 'films', 'was', 'hint', 'sweetness', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'providing', 'best', 'dialogue', 'films', 'giving', 'audience', 'trademark', 'sense', 'humor', 'emotionally', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film.The', 'film', 'basically', 'three', 'people', 'Banky', 'Edwards', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Holden', 'McNeil', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Allysa', 'Jones', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Banky', 'Holden', 'work', 'together', 'comic', 'book', 'hit', 'Bluntman', 'Chronic', 'based', 'loosely', 'lives', 'Smith', 'eccentric', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'characters', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'hanging', 'out', 'working', 'book', 'together', 'meet', 'Allysa', 'comic', 'book', 'convention', 'Holden', 'immediate', 'interest', 'Allysa', 'complicated', 'Allysa', 'homosexuality', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'quot', 'triangle', 'quot', 'two', 'good', 'friends', 'sexually', 'experienced', 'woman', 'ending', 'amazing', 'confrontation', 'three', 'Holden', 'making', 'very', 'odd', 'request', 'settle', 'troubles', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'so', 'not', 'ruin', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'it.The', 'film', 'feature', 'three', 'career', 'best', 'performances', 'main', 'actors', 'just', 'second', 'film', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'perfect', 'performance', 'unique', 'style', 'delivering', 'lines', 'giving', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'quite', 'bit', 'think', 'film', 'perhaps', 'best', 'speech', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Allysa', 'jeep', 'rain', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'not', 'appearing', 'quite', 'many', 'features', 'other', 'two', 'actors', 'was', 'also', 'incredible', 'skills', 'were', 'best', 'displayed', 'scene', 'hockey', 'rink', 'Smith', 'mentions', 'commentary', 'took', 'quite', 'few', 'lot', 'emotion', 'get', 'correct.The', 'dvd', 'great', 'extras', 'most', 'Smith', 'fans', 'would', 'recommend', 'Mallrats', 'best', 'dvd', 'would', 'argue', 'down', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'great', 'bonus', 'material', 'Smith', 'dvds', 'are', 'known', 'insightful', 'extremely', 'humorous', 'commentaries', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'others', 'always', 'felt', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'trying', 'talk', 'once', 'problem', 'solved', 'here', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'people', 'track', 'most', 'talking', 'done', 'Smith', 'Affleck', 'offer', 'great', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'always', 'offer', 'quite', 'bit', 'humor', 'way.The', 'dvd', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'usually', 'feel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'worth', 'one', 'watch', 'maybe', 'two', 'tops', 'dvd', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'scene', 'little', 'intro', 'Smith/Affleck', 'quite', 'humorous', 'own', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'am', 'still', 'puzzled', 'why', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'even', 'Smith', 'intros', 'best', 'example', 'quot', 'Mata**Hari', 'quot', 'where', 'Affleck', 'Lee', 'really', 'let', 'loose', 'other', 'give', 'powerful', 'performances', 'probably', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'sadly', 'was', 'left', 'out.To', 'sum', 'up', 'are', 'Smith', 'fan', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'shame', 'Buy', 'two', 'make', 'up', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'off', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'Smith', 'other', 'films', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'great', 'film', 'amazing', 'amount', 'humor', 'emotion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'better']",Chasing Amy VHS

I think I must have watched this movie 20 times and am looking forward to it on DVD. Its one of the most brutally honest films about relationships I've ever seen.  Its also hilarious. No matter how often I've seen this film, I never quit  laughing.I also think this is a very misunderstood film by some of the  reviewers at Amazon who perceived it negatively.  Its a great depiction of  friendships, biases against homosexuality and the ability for two very  different people to fall in love. Alyssa was a very promiscuous girl who  had experienced a different lifestyle than Holden.  She did lie about  herself in a way I thought was very wrong, claiming virginity when she  wasn't.  I think she was confused and had very negative views on dating men  until she met him and he changed her perception on the opposite sex. It  wasn't meant to offend the gay community, it was a story about confusion.  To an extent, I think Alyssa became a lesbian due to her past. It shows how  the past always comes back to haunt you and how it can destroy the good  things in your life.

The story is very well written with everything out in the open, there is nothing in this film that is cheapened or held back in this movie.

If not, you may then enjoy what may be one of the best romantic comedies to come out on cinemas/DVDs.The extras that came with this dvd is absolutely funny...especially the commentary as well as the quirky intros to the deleted scenes and some amusing outtakes.",5,fabulous Amy,1023062400,"06 3, 2002",2002,981,"['so', 'many', 'great', 'reviews', 'will', 'just', 'make', 'short', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'character', 'study', 'human', 'sexuality', 'great', 'job', 'kevin', 'Smith', 'gang', 'Wonderful', 'cast', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Joey', 'Adam', 'Dwight', 'Ewell', 'all.Chasing', 'Amy', 'movie', 'very', 'smart', 'witty', 'funny', 'story', 'also', 'basically', 'lots', 'subjects', 'male', 'ego', 'insecurities', 'homosexuality', 'sexual', 'conflicts', 'dialogue', 'straight', 'very', 'very', 'frank', 'honest', 'especially', 'sexual', 'topics', 'discussion.So', 'advice', 'see', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'very', 'open', 'mindIf', 'frank', 'honest', 'vivid', 'discussion', 'sexual', 'topics', 'homosexualiy', 'offends', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'not', 'may', 'then', 'enjoy', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'come', 'out', 'cinemas/DVDs.The', 'extras', 'came', 'dvd', 'absolutely', 'funny', 'especially', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'quirky', 'intros', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'amusing', 'outtakes']",Chasing Amy VHS

The ideia of a heterosexual guy (Ben Affleck) falling in love with a lesbian (Joey Lauren Adams) is interesting and quirky enough, yet director Kevin Smith offers an uneven and flawed movie.The premise is offbeat, but the execution isn`t as smart or clever as Smith thinks (like in most of his movies, by the way), in fact it`s really rather pedestrian, delivering a message with some moralism and preachiness. The overall result is unsurprising and predictable, even if the actors do their best and the dialogue is witty and credible. It has its moments, still the main message about sexual conflicts, although relevant, isn't told in a particular subtle or original way, since the approach could have gone further.Smith tries to analyse this relationship with a mature perspective, but it doesn`t really convince and turns into an average chick flick.At least ""Chasing Amy"" is better than ""Dogma"", given that it manages to deliver a couple of poignant and interesting scenes.A decent rental, worth watching once.",2,Indie Romantic Comedy,1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,1138,"['Chasing', 'Amy', 'strongly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'unfortunately', 't', 'seem', 'know', 'where', 'go', 'afterwards', 'ideia', 'heterosexual', 'guy', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'falling', 'love', 'lesbian', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'interesting', 'quirky', 'enough', 'yet', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'uneven', 'flawed', 'movie.The', 'premise', 'offbeat', 'execution', 'isn', 't', 'smart', 'clever', 'Smith', 'most', 'movies', 'way', 'fact', 's', 'really', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'delivering', 'message', 'moralism', 'preachiness', 'overall', 'result', 'unsurprising', 'predictable', 'even', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'credible', 'moments', 'still', 'main', 'message', 'sexual', 'conflicts', 'relevant', ""n't"", 'told', 'particular', 'subtle', 'original', 'way', 'approach', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'further.Smith', 'tries', 'analyse', 'relationship', 'mature', 'perspective', 't', 'really', 'convince', 'turns', 'average', 'chick', 'flick.At', 'least', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'better', 'Dogma', 'given', 'deliver', 'couple', 'poignant', 'interesting', 'scenes.A', 'decent', 'rental', 'worth', 'watching', 'once']",Chasing Amy VHS

Joey Lauren Adams has the female lead role, and while some find her voice a tad annoying, I found her to be quite adept as a dramatic/comedic actress.  Both her and Affleck exhibit chemistry, which is the lynchpin of the film.Like him or despise him these days, Ben Affleck gets top marks for this (his best) dramatic part.  He's essentially playing the straight man, but we sympathize and empathize with him up until the very end.The DVD is jam-packed with extras, including more than a few scenes that could have (and should have, in my opinion) stayed in the original release with no discernable difference in quality.

431990,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,6304681526,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[4, 7]","This is Kevin Smith's best film.  It isn't perfect, but it has a lot of real emotion in it, even though Smith nearly ruins it with his usual oversexed, Generation X schtick.  I think the reason this film works well for the most part is that it's really quite sincere in its best moments.  Kevin Smith was dating Joey Lauren Adams (the lead actress here) at the time, and had problems dealing with her past.  So he made this film as a cathartic experience, and maybe that was good for him to do so (even though him and Joey broke up, so it kind of all was for naught...oops).  Anyway, you really believe Ben Affleck falls in love with Joey here, and his scene where he declares his love feels very real and sincere (something Gen X types like Smith are NOT known for).  But when Joey just gives up being a lesbian right away for Affleck, it doesn't really feel authentic.  Her character was a bit of a whore when she was young, she found lesbianism, now Affleck brings her back to straightdom?  It's not entirely believable, but Affleck (in probably his only decent performance before he became a celebrity) is rather believable in this scene.  And in the scenes immediately following it, Joey's character seems to be really in love with Affleck.  Unfortunately, Smith throws in too many over the top sexual references (the scene where Joey Adams and Jason Lee talk about oral sex injuries is ridiculous and just there to be ""in your face""), and the scene where Ben Affleck proposes a menage a trois between Jason Lee and Joey is ridiculous.  Affleck somehow gets the idea in his head that Jason Lee has been in love with him his whole life (despite Lee talking about his oral sex injuries with women earlier on), which is completely out of place with his character.  Affleck proposes this in front of a TV playing ""video aquarium"" for some reason.  But I really like the ending of this film.  It's left totally open, and Smith should be commended for ending the film like that.  The film is a bit of a mess, with some questionable character motivations, but it has its good moments, and it's Smith's best film in my opinion.",3,An almost mature film from Kevin Smith...,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2124,"['Kevin', 'Smith', 'best', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'lot', 'real', 'emotion', 'even', 'Smith', 'nearly', 'usual', 'oversexed', 'Generation', 'X', 'schtick', 'think', 'reason', 'film', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'quite', 'sincere', 'best', 'moments', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'dating', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'lead', 'actress', 'here', 'time', 'had', 'problems', 'dealing', 'past', 'made', 'film', 'cathartic', 'experience', 'maybe', 'was', 'good', 'do', 'so', 'even', 'Joey', 'broke', 'up', 'kind', 'was', 'naught', 'oops', 'Anyway', 'really', 'believe', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'love', 'Joey', 'here', 'scene', 'where', 'love', 'feels', 'very', 'real', 'sincere', 'something', 'Gen', 'X', 'types', 'Smith', 'are', 'NOT', 'known', 'when', 'Joey', 'just', 'up', 'being', 'lesbian', 'right', 'away', 'Affleck', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'authentic', 'character', 'was', 'bit', 'whore', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'found', 'lesbianism', 'now', 'Affleck', 'back', 'straightdom', 'not', 'entirely', 'believable', 'Affleck', 'probably', 'only', 'decent', 'performance', 'became', 'celebrity', 'rather', 'believable', 'scene', 'scenes', 'immediately', 'following', 'Joey', 'character', 'be', 'really', 'love', 'Affleck', 'Unfortunately', 'Smith', 'too', 'many', 'top', 'sexual', 'references', 'scene', 'where', 'Joey', 'Adams', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'talk', 'oral', 'sex', 'injuries', 'ridiculous', 'just', 'be', 'face', 'scene', 'where', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'menage', 'trois', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Joey', 'ridiculous', 'Affleck', 'somehow', 'idea', 'head', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'been', 'love', 'whole', 'life', 'Lee', 'talking', 'oral', 'sex', 'injuries', 'women', 'earlier', 'completely', 'place', 'character', 'Affleck', 'front', 'TV', 'playing', 'video', 'aquarium', 'reason', 'really', 'ending', 'film', 'left', 'totally', 'open', 'Smith', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'ending', 'film', 'film', 'bit', 'mess', 'questionable', 'character', 'motivations', 'good', 'moments', 'Smith', 'best', 'film', 'opinion']",Chasing Amy VHS

Smith attacks his subject matter head on without pulling any punches. If Spike had made this film, you better believe he would have had a different third act!

In contrast to Nola Darling in SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT, Allysa (played by Joey Lauren Adams) is more than just a &quot;type.&quot; You really get a sense of her as a character. In CHASING AMY, you also get the sense that Smith has taken the time to understand something about the gay and lesbian community.One minor criticism about Adams's performance is her odd sounding voice. It really starts to wear on you at times, particularly in the most emotional scenes. That aside, Adams is very attractive in the role and gives a winning performance.Ben Affleck and Jason Lee are great as best friends who also produce a comic strip together.

I was wrong.  I must have forgot that it was directed by Kevin Smith, the hilarious man behind Clerks.  Chasing Amy is a raw, harsh, and occasionally side-splitting movie with additude and a severe potty-mouth.  What else would you expect from the creator of Jay and Silent Bob?Well, I've come to expect entertaining sight gags and beautifully tasteless humor from Mr.Smith.  When I watch a Kevin Smith movie I want to laugh until I pass out.  This movie does deliver the comical punches...but not often enough for my tastes.  The space between scenes with a &quot;giggle factor&quot; is sometimes enormous, and by the end of the movie you say outloud, &quot;Ha?&quot;  This isn't your average comedy...mainly because it's not a comedy.  When Smith focuses on the drama the film gets bogged down, dramatic dialogue just isn't his strong point.  So, if by the mid-way point you become tired of the movie, hold on for a little longer, or you'll miss the much needed Jay and Silent Bob cameos.

Mckinley,"[5, 8]","In Chasing Amy, Kevin Smith finds a delicate balance between the raw vulgarity and toilet humor of his other four movies while delivering his best dialogue yet. I found myself watching the final ten minutes over and over as subtle facial expressions and the brilliant detachedness of the three characters closed off any doubts as to the outcome of their relationships. Minor flaws in the dialogue reminded me of the choppiness of Clerks. I found Chasing Amy to be a stunning window into the today's generation dealing with some of its own issues. There were strong performances &amp; sharp, smart dialogue rather than the all-too-common dumb schtick. It had urban reality and it had heart.  Some sheltered people may find this film crude, and they may be right. However, this is how people in real life talk. If your tender ears can't handle words then don't rent it. For everyone else this is a great movie. Smith made this film with a low 6 figures and it looks better than many that get churned out these days. The Criterion Edition especially is amazing with great sound and a crisp picture.

Well, let's just say her nickname is &quot;Finger Cuffs&quot; and that &quot;girlfriends&quot; take on a whole different meaning.  Jason Lee's character is the best friend and fellow comic book writer of Holden.  Banky is the conscience and the reality of the movie, which basically means he tells it how it is.  Also, the fact that Holden and Banky's friendship is falling apart as Holden gets closer to Alyssa (Joey Adams) is all too familiar to me.  I can remember times that friendships ended because of friends who gave all their precious spare time to their girlfriend and cannot understand why when it's over that those ex-friends want nothing to with them.  Perhaps watching this movie they will realize it.  Anyway, Banky finds damaging information about Alyssa and confronts Holden with it. Holden goes to another friend and comic book writer, HooperX (Ewell), who is basically counseling Holden on the matter of Banky's jealousy and indispensible objection to him dating Alyssa,  tells him to just ask Alyssa about her past.  Holden does just that but in a coniving way and in an unprecedented place, at a hockey game.Kevin Smith (who reprises his role as Silent Bob, alongside Jason Mewes as Jay) refuses to take the easy way out, which is what Hollywood usually does, you know, the unreal happy ending.Kevin Smith is definitely a writer/director who will be around for a long time.  Despite the fact that his movies' camara movements are not anything to get excited about, it is the story line and the characters that he excels which more than makes up for the generic camara work.

The fact that Kevin Smith wrote the film about fairly true events, I decided to do the same. I just thought this movie was perfect. Ben Affleck is very good in this film, and has convinced me that he's a fairly good actor. A man named Dwight Ewell plays Hooper, the gay black guy who acts like Malcolm X to promote his comic book. There's a hilarious scene where he describes Star Wars as a rascist movie that had me falling out of my chair. Joey Adams played Alyssa, who the movie is about. I thought she was a good actress, but it's a shame that she dropped Kevin like a bad habit. But the real star of the show is Jason Lee. I can't get enough of that guy. He is the best young actor hollywood has, and they don't use him enough. He needs his own movie. He just has countless funny lines and actions that really bring the character of Banky to life.

432010,A3GTH1VXNRYZS5,6304681526,"""j_james""","[0, 0]","The ultimate brilliance of this feature is that it is a hybrid of comedy and drama. From Smith's customary rant about Star Wars, to a debate about the Archie comics, to an unnerving scene involving pornography, to a Jaws tribute, to plays on both racism and homosexuality this film is strikingly hilarious. But it also ranges the full spectrum of emotions, covers much of human experience and leaves the viewer feeling disgusted, angry, euphoric, and many other sensations. The dialogue is true (yes, as one reviewer said, it does sound like each character is Kevin Smith talking to Kevin Smith--but that isn't a detraction since these characters all come from the same background as Kevin Smith; they all have the same life experiences and are at the same point in life; it is only reasonable, then, that their dialect sound similiar), the acting is (especially for a Kevin Smith film) exceptional, the characters are all real and deep.But I don't feel the need to ramble on about this feature's merits; they've all been discussed many times. Instead I'd like to talk about its supposed faults. Much has been made about the treatment of lesbians--that not only does a heterosexual male confess his love to a lesbian, he winds converting that lesbian. Smith himself preemptively countered this objection twice. The first time was by having Jason Lee deliver this exact critique in the film. Banky, of course, is the primary comic relief; he's also the dufus; by having Banky explicity say that all any lesbian needs is some serious deep ----(fill in the blank) Smith is making us see that he too thinks its stupid to think that all lesbians will in fact love a man. That he in fact believes lesbianism is real and genuine and can't be dismissed by the magic male. Thus, the viewer is left to figure out why this particular lesbian falls in love with this particular man. The second time Smith counters this objection is by having Alyssa explain to Holden why she's with him. Pay attention to the scene; they're on a bed and it's lit in blue. You won't miss it. I'd also like to note that Holden confesses his love to Alyssa after a long deliberation and in a very dramatic moment; he didn't plan to do it, he probably didn't want to do it. He wanted to avoid the moment, but we've been in love; we know what it's like. After a while, you can't hold it in anymore.Much has also been made about the cinematography--that Smith isn't a great visual artist. That he doesn't frame shots well and doesn't make the picture vicerally appealing. This is true; it's the fault of all Kevin Smith movies. But any viewer should know this going into the film, and therefore shouldn't be disappointed by it. If you don't know it, let me tell you. Kevin Smith doesn't paint a pretty scene.

Perhaps the funniest is delivered in a rant about the lack of black figures in comic books that includes Smith's obligatory Star Wars reference, and the most touching a solioquoy spoken by the normally demure Silent Bob (played by Smith).The performances are superb from Ben Affleck as Holden, the comic artist who falls for Joey Lauren Adams' lesbian character to Jason Lee as Affleck's angry comic ""tracer"" friend to Smith and friend Jason Mewes as the drug-dealing duo of Silent Bob and Jay.Don't overlook this film as did so many in theaters.

Most recently, I saw Chasing Amy, and I was even more impressed by his work!  With Chasing Amy, I think you get a more personal and mature view of what Kevin Smith's writing is all about.  And the common link I've enjoyed in each film is the absolute fearless attitude he has about every aspect of modern film-making.  He works on a low-budget, and it works just as good if he had millions of dollars to work with.

It feels so personal, there is no barrier between the audience and the characters, which is what I think makes his films so successful.  And you have to feel special when you understand whats going on when they are referring to an incident at the YMCA in each of his films.

This movie is also even better than quirky love stories like Sleepless in Seattle. This is an honest and superbly acted film about love and friendships, jealousy, obsession, self denial and the experiences we choose to have or not to have.And while playing around a touchy subject, this movie hits all the right spots with its fresh and honest look at the power of relationships.The dialogue is simply wonderful and witty and hilarious at times. I have to agree with Caroline Hampton about the car/rain scene being the best love speech dialogues in movie history.It's not all sugar coated with the usual yucky love stuff but Ben Affleck's tortured expression and hesitated delivered words makes it all the more appealing.All acting in this movie is just perfect. Jay and Silent Bob share a scene in which Silent Bob opens up with words of wisdom.Jason Lee is great as the jealous friend and homophobic comic book tracer.But Joey Lauren Adams steals the show. Even with her usually annoying mousy voice, she manages to come across as sweet and cute, an obvious guy's crush.Her portrayal of Alyssa was a big step into something much more familiar than just lesbianism. It was a look into all people, and all relationships alike, for the times we want to know or fear to know all the things that could haunt our minds and torment our bonds with the ones we love.It is simply an intimate look into all the limits and boundaries of love and all the matters that often skew our views of reality.What this movie shows in all its beauty is what most of us long to attain...a normal kind of relationship...to which we may never really find.",5,"The Case for Chasing Love, Friendships, and Life.",1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,1682,"['doubt', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'finest', 'movie', 'also', 'even', 'better', 'quirky', 'love', 'stories', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'honest', 'superbly', 'acted', 'film', 'love', 'friendships', 'jealousy', 'obsession', 'denial', 'experiences', 'choose', 'have', 'not', 'have.And', 'playing', 'touchy', 'subject', 'movie', 'right', 'spots', 'fresh', 'honest', 'look', 'power', 'relationships.The', 'dialogue', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'witty', 'hilarious', 'times', 'have', 'agree', 'Caroline', 'Hampton', 'car/rain', 'scene', 'being', 'best', 'love', 'speech', 'dialogues', 'movie', 'history.It', 'not', 'sugar', 'coated', 'usual', 'yucky', 'love', 'stuff', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'tortured', 'expression', 'hesitated', 'delivered', 'words', 'more', 'appealing.All', 'acting', 'movie', 'just', 'perfect', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'share', 'scene', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'up', 'words', 'wisdom.Jason', 'Lee', 'great', 'jealous', 'friend', 'homophobic', 'comic', 'book', 'tracer.But', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'show', 'Even', 'usually', 'annoying', 'mousy', 'voice', 'come', 'sweet', 'cute', 'obvious', 'guy', 'crush.Her', 'portrayal', 'Alyssa', 'was', 'big', 'step', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'familiar', 'just', 'lesbianism', 'was', 'look', 'people', 'relationships', 'alike', 'times', 'want', 'know', 'fear', 'know', 'things', 'could', 'haunt', 'minds', 'torment', 'bonds', 'ones', 'love.It', 'simply', 'intimate', 'look', 'limits', 'boundaries', 'love', 'matters', 'often', 'views', 'reality.What', 'movie', 'beauty', 'what', 'most', 'long', 'attain', 'normal', 'kind', 'relationship', 'may', 'never', 'really', 'find']",Chasing Amy VHS

This is another great film by this director-writer who has turned his sights on romantic comedy, scripting an intelligent, funny, and edgy film and deftly directing it.The plot focuses on Holden Mc McNeil (Ben Affleck), a successful comic book artist who has yet to fall really and truly in love. While at a comic book show with his friend of twenty years and collaborator, Banky Edwards (Jason Lee), with whom he lives, Holden ends up meeting a struggling, spunky, independent female comic book artist, the gorgeous and sexy Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams). The only problem is that she claims to like women. This self-styled lesbian and Holden begin a friendship, however,  that eventually deepens into something else.Unfortunately, a strange love triangle of sorts seems to develop among Alyssa, Holden, and  Banky, as Banky takes a strong dislike to Alyssa when she and Holden manage to take their relationship to the next level. The seemingly jealous Banky does his best to try to erode the bonds between the two, but it is Holden himself who does the most to erode what he and Alyssa have, with a little inadvertent help from Alyssa. It seems that the concept of unconditional love is one with which Holden has a problem.This is a gender bender sort of film, with wonderful performances by the entire cast. Ben Affleck is well cast as Holden, giving a winning performance. Jason Lee is terrific as the erstwhile best friend with issues. Joey Lauren Adams lights up the screen every time she is in a scene. She does a terrific job with the role of the conflicted Alyssa. Dwight Ewell is sensational as Hooper LaMont, the ostensibly racist comic book artist, who has his own issues and is quite funny. Look also for a cameo by Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). It is Silent Bob who lets the viewer in on the meaning of the film's title.All in all, this is a highly enjoyable, off-beat and edgy, romantic comedy that fans of Kevin Smith will enjoy, as will all those film lovers who simply enjoy a great film.

Despite that, the movie somehow gets lost in the middle and doesn't quite reemerge in the end. In places the film seems to drag along, but  mostly it wanders aimlessly through the second half in which Affleck's  character has to figure out... well, nothing.The confusion of the  characters is understandable but unfortunately it carries over into the  plot. Overall the film has sort of a &quot;Boy meets girl, boy gets girl,  now what?&quot; feel. Unlike Clerks which illustrates the attitudes and  emotions of its main characters through the little events of their day,  managing in the end a real connection with them, Chasing Amy just drifts  through the last hour.Worthy moments of the film include the two comic  artists heckling their friend's propaganda piece (&quot;What's a  Nubian?&quot;) and their double-takes when they first realize they're in a  gay bar. The first fifteen or twenty minutes set a good tone, but the tone  takes a dive quickly after that.Overall I found this one to be somewhat  less appealing than some of the director's other work.

Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[4, 9]","As I put this movie into my player, I had no real conception of what it would be about except for the blurb that I read on the back of the box, so I didn't know what to expect, I just hoped to be entertained for two hours, to lose myself in a somewhat different romantic comedy.  Unfortunately, that is not what I got, instead I got this movie, Chasing Amy.Of the cast, I can say mainly only this, Joey Lauren Adams is the only possible reason for anyone to pick this movie up.  Her performance was great, she just wasn't given anyone to really work with.  Ben Affleck has to be one of the most wooden actors I've seen in quite some time.  He dims every scene he is in, and brings absolutely nothing to this movie, which hurts it a lot.  The only movie I've seen with him in it, where he does a somewhat decent job was in Good Will Hunting.  Other than that, he needs to go back to acting school and learn how to show some emotion in his scenes.In almost all romance type movies, there always comes the inevitable break up scene.  One or both of the principle characters does something to the other, or there's some misunderstanding that they won't talk about, and they split up for a time.  This movie, unfortunately, has the honor of having one of the dumbest reasons for a break up that I have seen in quite a long time, and then it drags it on and on.  Then, when you think the hero(a loose term there) has seen the light after talking to two other characters, he makes the dumbest move I've ever seen in a movie.  He makes a proposition to this girl he loves that I could never make to any girl with a straight face, and he's serious.  A slap across the face was much less than what this jerk deserved.The ending of this movie is a bit of a puzzler.  That she could have forgiven this jerk enough to get back together with him seemed impossible, and it doesn't happen, but it might have at least pushed my review up one star.  To give up two hours of my time to see two people break up and stay broken up seems like a bit much, but it would have been hard to bring the two back together after what a collosal jerk he was.

432040,ABOTQXNUBA1MM,6304681526,Mark F. Braun,"[9, 11]","There are forty-plus reviews of the film, but few hit the culture that it is seeped in: there's a point when people change tracks in their lives and become someone else. Call it maturing (ugh) or moving on (better); you can't find a better example of a small, intimate film that pulls you apart like AMY.The new DVD release of the original laserdisc of AMY is great, though I'd recommend turning on the captioning to hear everything comfortably; this is a dialogue movie and an excellent starting point of any potential Kevin Smith fans (but blow off VULGAR). There's plenty of profanity here, but it all works into the storyline and helps guide us through the transformations of the characters as we get a good look at who is a social zero and who has evolved past their past.Comic book fanboys will identify Mike Allred's work a mile away, and the usual cast will include a glance at Marvel honcho Joe Quesada (interviewed by this once-active comic book player a decade ago) and others. You'll get a really, truly, acuate look at the comic book culture, and even marginally, when the immature good guy can't get past the problems of releasing childish things to find true happiness with a girl who has put aside her past for him, you get the point.In real life, Smith, like his comic book contemporaries like Quesada, Alex Ross, Steve Darnall, Linda Thompson and others that we've known moved into the real world of marriage, mortgages, and finding a quality of life outside of perennially fat or skinny Peter Pans. Comics will break your heart, sooner or later. Comics draw in a diverse and fascinating universe of characters; when they grow up, they -we- get a lot more interesting.  But until those real-world characters get their acts together completely, the transitions can sometimes be scary and damned unsavory: AMY hits that mark when girl asks boy if he's ready to move past an imperfect, childish world and commit to a new one; he won't although it isn't that he can't.Bone-headed relationships, immature habits and addictions are personal demons needed to be broken or they consume us.

432041,A36EW68H08UOCS,6304681526,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[75, 86]","I have a ""love-hate"" relationship with Romantic Comedies.  I really enjoy a decent one - and a couple of examples I'd consider ""decent"" areWhen Harry Met SallyandWhile You Were Sleeping. I also recognize that there is probably no other movie genre that is as suitable for ""date night"": It's where men and women's interests overlap.Bad Romantic Comedies can be really tedious things, and many of my pet peeves about movies come from this genre.  For example, my LEAST favorite romantic comedy cliche is the moment 10 minutes before the end of the movie where our loving couple has THE ""big fight"" (often over nothing or something completely stupid or forgettable), followed by one of the characters tearing off to the airport just so that the OTHER partner will have the sudden revelation that they've *made a big mistake* and go tearing off for the airport as well - usually arriving only moments late. (With an equally cliche-filled smooching reunion that follows minutes later, before the end credits roll.)But I digress.  NONE of these horrid cliche's fill this movie, which is full of almost believable characters and completely believable heartache.Kevin Smith has now created a half-dozen films, and while I would classify all of them somewhere between ""watchable"" and ""excellent"", ""Chasing Amy"" remains his masterpiece to date.Holden (Ben Affleck) and Banky (Jason Lee) are 30ish buds-since-High-School who have grown into the guy fantasy job of writing a hit comic book.  They get to alternate working on ""Bluntman and Chronic"" with making personal appearances at fan conventions where they get paid to sign autographs.At one of these conventions they hook up with another ""graphic novelist"", Dwight Ewell's Hooper X - who is constantly educating Holden and Banky about being black and being gay.  Ewell steals all of his scenes because Hooper is a perfect mix of bravado and angst which sufficiently masks his inner conflict for being black and gay.Hooper introduces our heroes to Alyssa Jones, portrayed in a career-making performance by Joey Lauren Adams.  Alyssa is cute, funny, talented, witty and Affleck's Holden falls for her in a big way.  He interrupts his usual routine with Banky just to meet up with Alyssa before finding out at the end of the first act that Alyssa is a lesbian.A moment to discuss the language, themes and realism of the movie.  Like the Kevin Smith films that preceded it, Chasing Amy uses language that is frank and honest and uses raw street vernacular to describe many things, in particular sex.  I have heard many criticisms about the story contained in Chasing Amy.  Joey Lauren Adams doesn't fit lesbian stereotypes, and among those who seem to know, it is ridiculous to consider that a lesbian might be interested in a man - even if (perhaps especially if) the man is Ben Affleck.  These things must be accepted to follow the movie.  Smith makes it easy.  In truth, the language and the issue of homosexuality are side issues in what is essentially a truly unique Romantic Comedy.Like Smith's first featureClerks (Collector's Series)the central conflict in ""Amy"" concerns one character's difficulties accepting the ""history"" of the other romantic interest.  To say more would spoil the pleasure you would derive from enjoying the flick yourself, but it has to be stated that Smith's resolution involves heartbreak, plenty of humor, no cliches and no airports.If you think you might enjoy an honest romantic comedy that includes street language, frank discussions about sex and gay characters, ""Chasing Amy"" fills the bill exactly.",5,Kevin Smith Turns Romantic Comedies on their ear!,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,3577,"['have', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'really', 'enjoy', 'decent', 'one', 'couple', 'examples', ""'d"", 'consider', 'decent', 'areWhen', 'Harry', 'Met', 'SallyandWhile', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'also', 'recognize', 'probably', 'other', 'movie', 'genre', 'suitable', 'date', 'night', 'where', 'men', 'women', 'interests', 'overlap.Bad', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'tedious', 'things', 'many', 'pet', 'peeves', 'movies', 'come', 'genre', 'example', 'LEAST', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'cliche', 'moment', '10', 'minutes', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'loving', 'couple', 'THE', 'big', 'fight', 'often', 'nothing', 'something', 'completely', 'stupid', 'forgettable', 'followed', 'one', 'characters', 'tearing', 'off', 'airport', 'just', 'so', 'OTHER', 'partner', 'will', 'have', 'sudden', 'revelation', ""'ve"", '*made', 'big', 'mistake*', 'go', 'tearing', 'off', 'airport', 'as', 'well', 'usually', 'arriving', 'only', 'moments', 'late', 'equally', 'cliche-filled', 'smooching', 'reunion', 'minutes', 'later', 'end', 'roll', 'digress', 'NONE', 'horrid', 'cliche', 'fill', 'movie', 'full', 'almost', 'believable', 'characters', 'completely', 'believable', 'heartache.Kevin', 'Smith', 'now', 'created', 'half-dozen', 'films', 'would', 'classify', 'somewhere', 'watchable', 'excellent', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'masterpiece', 'date.Holden', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Banky', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'are', '30ish', 'buds-since-High-School', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'guy', 'fantasy', 'job', 'writing', 'hit', 'comic', 'book', 'get', 'alternate', 'working', 'Bluntman', 'Chronic', 'making', 'personal', 'appearances', 'fan', 'conventions', 'where', 'get', 'paid', 'sign', 'autographs.At', 'one', 'conventions', 'hook', 'up', 'graphic', 'novelist', 'Dwight', 'Ewell', 'Hooper', 'X', 'who', 'constantly', 'educating', 'Holden', 'Banky', 'being', 'black', 'being', 'gay', 'Ewell', 'scenes', 'Hooper', 'perfect', 'mix', 'bravado', 'angst', 'sufficiently', 'inner', 'conflict', 'being', 'black', 'gay.Hooper', 'introduces', 'heroes', 'Alyssa', 'Jones', 'portrayed', 'career-making', 'performance', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Alyssa', 'cute', 'funny', 'talented', 'witty', 'Affleck', 'Holden', 'big', 'way', 'usual', 'routine', 'Banky', 'just', 'meet', 'up', 'Alyssa', 'finding', 'out', 'end', 'first', 'act', 'Alyssa', 'lesbian.A', 'moment', 'discuss', 'language', 'themes', 'realism', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'films', 'preceded', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'language', 'frank', 'honest', 'raw', 'street', 'vernacular', 'describe', 'many', 'things', 'particular', 'sex', 'have', 'heard', 'many', 'criticisms', 'story', 'contained', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', ""n't"", 'fit', 'lesbian', 'stereotypes', 'who', 'seem', 'know', 'ridiculous', 'consider', 'lesbian', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'man', 'even', 'perhaps', 'especially', 'man', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'accepted', 'follow', 'movie', 'Smith', 'easy', 'truth', 'language', 'issue', 'homosexuality', 'are', 'side', 'issues', 'what', 'essentially', 'truly', 'unique', 'Romantic', 'Comedy.Like', 'Smith', 'first', 'featureClerks', 'Collector', 'Series', 'central', 'conflict', 'Amy', 'one', 'character', 'difficulties', 'accepting', 'history', 'other', 'romantic', 'interest', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'pleasure', 'would', 'derive', 'enjoying', 'flick', 'be', 'stated', 'Smith', 'resolution', 'heartbreak', 'plenty', 'humor', 'cliches', 'airports.If', 'think', 'might', 'enjoy', 'honest', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'street', 'language', 'frank', 'discussions', 'sex', 'gay', 'characters', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'bill', 'exactly']",Chasing Amy VHS

432044,A7ERVYXIGHH7E,6304681526,Matt Stevens,"[9, 10]","Blu-Ray, done right, will show all the warts of a film. In this case, CHASING AMY was shot on a larger 16mm format called Super16 and then blown up to 35mm. The natural grain of Super16 will be even larger blown up to 35mm and no doubt that some of that natural grain is apparent on this new Blu-Ray. However, Miramax has seen fit to noise reduce the image a bit in an effort to please people who have no clue what grain is and why it is important. The result is a slightly softened look, but one that is noticeably superior to the older DVD releases. I think Miramax would have served this film better had they stayed away from filtering the grain, but at least they didn't overdue it (examples of that are releases such as PATTON, ZULU, PAN'S LABYRINTH, HAIRSPRAY).That being said, the Canadian release is grainy and looks sharper, but the compression methods are inferior, so grain is reduced to mpeg artifacting and that results in an artificially sharper image. In the end, the Miramax release is the one to buy and we know it won't have a re-release any time soon as this is from a new 2k master supervised by the cinematographer (who admits he has not seen the actual Blu-Ray release. Directors and cinematographers typically approve a transfer, but that transfer can then have the grain reduced or filtered for BD without their knowledge and that happens a lot).Fans of the film who already own the DVD should upgrade if they have the spare cash and they can get it at the 35%+ discounted price. If money is tight, hold off until the price comes back down. Waiting pays off. Sometimes staying away from a favorite film for a few years and then going back to it results in a wonderful viewing experience. I stopped viewing HIGHLANDER on DVD years ago, knowing it would hit Blu-Ray at some point. It did (in England) and when I sat down to watch it in HD on a 71 inch screen I was blown away. What a revelation. It was like coming home again.In the case of CHASING AMY, it had been five or more years for me.

And now I like a third one! If you've only seen one, then I suggest you look out for the others, as there's loads of references, in-jokes and characters appearing in all the movies. I still have to get Clerks &amp; Mallrats.I did feel that Jay &amp; Silent Bob didn't have big roles in this. They appeared regularly throughout in Dogma, and Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back - well, that film was all about them! I'm totally after Clerks &amp; Mallrats now. I'm ashamed to say I'm actually beginning to like Jay and Silent Bob - I have to say that I prefer Silent Bob, his facial expressions are hilarious.For some reason, I was not keen on Joey Lauren Adams character. Her voice totally got on my nerves, and she generally bugged the hell out of me during the whole film.The extras were fantastic, THE best extras I've seen yet on a DVD. There's a very long DVD intro from Kevin Smith, Ben Affleck, Jason Mews, and some other guy, and these guys feature in some hilarious scenes when they're trying to introduce the outtakes/deleted scenes, and the colour bars.

432050,A2BON03VAFS1SZ,6304681526,Michael Fishman,"[10, 13]","Is there anything more boring than watching pampered 20-somethings struggling with life issues while trying to make sense of their seemingly overly angst ridden life? After watching Chasing Amy, the answer to that question for me is a loud ""No"". My guess is I'm way too old for this movie and my belief is that anyone over the age of 25 who's been living life will find nothing new, exciting or eye-opening in Chasing Amy.This is basically the age old story of boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy loses girl. The only difference between this version and any other version I've ever seen, is that the two main characters here are so self-absorbed - Holden far more so than Alyssa - that I really didn't care at all what happened to either of them. I didn't feel anything they felt during the ups and downs of their relationship. I'd like to think that a love story makes the viewer feel just a little something for the two characters in love, but I had none of that here.As in Clerks, once again Kevin Smith saves the best lines for himself. In Clerks it was Silent Bob's one line definition of love that was brilliant. In Chasing Amy, it's more than a few lines, it's the definition of chasing Amy and life's lost opportunities at love. Good stuff from Silent Bob there, but the truth is that this is life and this isn't a huge secret. Men (and I suppose this is also true for women) are chasing Amy not only at age 25, but also at age 50. If we're lucky enough to live that long, we'll still be chasing Amy at 80.Also, it's not so much that anyone's chasing Amy through life that's so important here. It's what we do when we're lucky enough to find ourselves with opportunity in life and Smith didn't really do anything with this at all, so Chasing Amy, for me, boils down to what's the point here? What's the message? It's not that the subject of the movie, or Silent Bob's message, was so bad, it's what Kevin Smith didn't do with the subject that causes the movie to ultimately fail for me. Finally, I didn't like how Smith trivialized the subject of the movie, as well as Alyssa's sexuality choices, and the covert homosexual subplot was, in a way, insulting.Ultimately, this movie doesn't tell us anything about being in love with someone else, it just shows us what it's like to be in love with oneself.I'm not a Ben Affleck fan at all so it's not surprising that he didn't bring anything to his role for me. I thought he was his usual wooden self. I also didn't care too much for Joey Lauren Adams who played Alyssa. When she wasn't being overly cutesy, she was being overly whiny and that wore thin after awhile. I liked Jason Lee and he, Jason Mewes (Jay) and Dwight Ewell (Hooper) were the only highlights of the movie for me.Kevin Smith does write some funny dialogue and there was some of that here, but this movie was nowhere near as good as what he wrote in Clerks.It's difficult for me to recommend this movie without telling someone to watch Annie Hall first.",2,I think I'm probably too old for this movie,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2980,"['anything', 'more', 'boring', 'watching', 'pampered', '20-somethings', 'struggling', 'life', 'issues', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'seemingly', 'overly', 'angst', 'ridden', 'life', 'watching', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'answer', 'question', 'loud', 'guess', ""'m"", 'way', 'too', 'old', 'movie', 'belief', 'anyone', 'age', '25', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'life', 'will', 'find', 'nothing', 'new', 'exciting', 'eye-opening', 'Chasing', 'Amy.This', 'basically', 'age', 'old', 'story', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'falls', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'only', 'difference', 'version', 'other', 'version', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'self-absorbed', 'Holden', 'far', 'more', 'so', 'Alyssa', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'felt', 'ups', 'downs', 'relationship', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'love', 'story', 'viewer', 'feel', 'just', 'little', 'something', 'two', 'characters', 'love', 'had', 'none', 'here.As', 'Clerks', 'once', 'again', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'best', 'lines', 'Clerks', 'was', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'one', 'line', 'definition', 'love', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'more', 'few', 'lines', 'definition', 'chasing', 'Amy', 'life', 'lost', 'opportunities', 'love', 'Good', 'stuff', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'there', 'truth', 'life', ""n't"", 'huge', 'secret', 'Men', 'suppose', 'also', 'true', 'women', 'are', 'chasing', 'Amy', 'not', 'only', 'age', '25', 'also', 'age', '50', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'live', 'long', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'chasing', 'Amy', '80.Also', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'anyone', 'chasing', 'Amy', 'life', 'so', 'important', 'here', 'what', 'do', 'when', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'opportunity', 'life', 'Smith', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'down', 'what', 'point', 'here', 'What', 'message', 'not', 'subject', 'movie', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'message', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'what', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'subject', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'fail', 'Finally', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'Smith', 'trivialized', 'subject', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Alyssa', 'sexuality', 'choices', 'covert', 'homosexual', 'subplot', 'was', 'way', 'insulting.Ultimately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'being', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'just', 'what', 'be', 'love', 'oneself.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'fan', 'not', 'surprising', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'role', 'thought', 'was', 'usual', 'wooden', 'self', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'who', 'played', 'Alyssa', 'When', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'overly', 'cutesy', 'was', 'being', 'overly', 'whiny', 'wore', 'thin', 'awhile', 'liked', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Jay', 'Dwight', 'Ewell', 'Hooper', 'were', 'only', 'highlights', 'movie', 'me.Kevin', 'Smith', 'write', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'was', 'here', 'movie', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'what', 'wrote', 'Clerks.It', 'difficult', 'recommend', 'movie', 'telling', 'someone', 'watch', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'first']",Chasing Amy VHS

432055,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6304681526,Mike Stone,"[9, 11]","The best thing about Kevin Smith is that he tries to make movies that consciously walk the path *not* of least resistance. He always runs the risk of having the whole endeavor blow up in his face (as happened with the flawed by still worthwhile &quot;Mallrats&quot;). But when things go right, and thankfully Smith is such a talent that can pull this off more often than not, it's like getting diamonds from coal.In &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; Smith is still prone to moments of misstep. An emotional scene near its middle, where one character professes their love for another, takes place during a rainstorm. It's a tired movie cliche that's made worse by well-placed thunder claps. The scene didn't need any meteorology commentary; it had enough weight in the writing. And Smith, in a weakness he has admitted to, tends to fall in love with twenty-cent words. At times this tendency gets in the way of the reality of his dialogue. But those times are few and far between, and really, nitpicking about the smartness of Kevin Smith's dialogue is like admonishing God for making giraffes too tall.There. By pointing out the above inconsequential mistakes, I now have free reign to gush over the rest of the movie.This is one of my three favourite contemporary romantic comedies (that holy trinity also includes &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Say Anything'&quot;), not because I find either of the leads particularly appealing, but because it asks so many valuable questions about the nature of romance itself. Is sexuality a choice? Can we decide whom we love? How fine is the line between platonic and romantic love? Smith wraps these tough questions up in loads of humourous pop culture references, to make them go down easier. &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, and, bless Kevin's heart, legendary Canadian teen-com &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; are all included. Fans of Kevin's previous works will also revel in his moments of self-referentiality, as many aspects of his View Askewniverse are brought back to bring life to the film's background.Ben Affleck, as the cynical hipster comic book dude who's in touch with his emotions and his passions, had a tough task here. His wasn't as outrageous a character as those around him. He had to be real, to provide the film with some firm ground to take off from. And even though it's one of the (relatively) weakest performances in the film, Affleck has enough movie-star charisma about him (this is not post-&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; revisionist history I'm indulging in; I felt this way the first time I saw the film in '97, when he was a relative unknown) to make Holden a character you don't mind spending two hours with. (Note to Kevin: given the accessibility of modern CGI technology, can you *please* fill in the left side of Ben's hastily grown goatee? It's lopsided, and quite distracting!)Joey Lauren Adams also had a tough task. Her character, Alyssa Jones, is essentially based on her (Smith has admitted that his relationship with Adams provided an autobiographical framework for the story he tells here). She is an earnest pixie, full of energy and spunk and adventure. It sounds like it would be an easy role to play, the lesbian who falls in love with a man, in the hand of a less thoughtful screenwriter. But Smith furnishes Alyssa with an armload of prudence and passion, a level head, and a complicated past. Adams plays all of these angles with perfect precision.These two prospective lovers are ably supported by a duo of wonderful characters. Dwight Ewell plays Hooper X, a comic book artist with a schizophrenic persona (he &quot;talks like Louis Farrakhan on stage, and the King of Pop off&quot;). Ewell manages both sides of his character beautifully. There's a great scene in a record store, where he runs into a young fan, and must turn on the black militant rage in an instant. When the kid's gone, he gets this goofy grin on his face, incredulous at the act he must put on just to sell comics. Jason Lee, as Holden's best friend and &quot;inker&quot; Banky, has an army of scatological lines to deliver, which he does with deadpan precision. Banky is a loyal trooper, a man whose passions are worn on his sleeve and is unapologetic about them. His shining moment comes when he gives a young boy a quick education on skin mags. But Lee is also good when not in full-blown Banky mode. If not for this restraint he gives to the character, the friendship between Banky and Holden (their comic book is published under the name &quot;Bank Holdup&quot;' ha!) would be implausible.Of course any Kevin Smith movie would be incomplete without an appearance by those pot-dealing knuckleheads Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself). They only appear in a brief scene at the end, which is probably just enough screentime. The one thing I'll say about this scene is that I get a kick out of the fact that Smith delivers the first line of his vital monologue (it happens to be the movie's title) while he's got his fingers in his mouth biting his nails. Hee-hee.I've always found the ending problematic. It's a bold step to go out on that just barely works; I just can't buy the fact that one of the characters would make such a stupid decision. It's a necessary plot point, but one that falters slightly. Still, it's only a minor quibble in what is mostly a flawless movie.",5,A romantic comedy not afraid to use its big brain,998006400,"08 17, 2001",2001,5363,"['best', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'make',

Kevin Smith does a fantastic job telling us this story of an average guy who falls in love with a lesbian. I've seen this kind of thing happen several times in movies, but this movie takes it a step further and really shows how these two people deal with it instead of just brushing it off.This is Ben Affleck's best performance ever! He deals with his eagerness to fall in love with this woman in a very sophisticated and sometimes emotional way. He tries to adapt to the idea of being just friends, but of course he can't take it any more and sits down with the girl and acts out one of the best monologues I've seen in a movie. Just watching him pour his heart out to this girl is beyond fantastic!Joey Lauren Adams as the girl of Ben Affleck's dreams shines tremendously. She is a very powerful actress in this film and plays this lesbian role with such great energy.Kevin Smith can tell a raw, yet emotional story about the tough things of love like not many other actors. Just watching the leading man and lady work off of each other is terrific.The one thing I truly learned from this film is that gays and lesbians are people.

The Criterion Edition of this DVD is packed with extras which include trailers, commentary, deleted scenes &amp; outtakes, an introduction by Kevin Smith, etc.Ones of my favourite scenes is the emotional blowout between Holden (Affleck) and Amy (Adams) in the arena parking lot.  Joey Laura Adams is simply exceptional.  In the commentary Kevin Smith can't stop blabbing over Joey Lauren Adams' performance being a &quot;tour-de-force&quot; and it definitely is.

Anyway, what made Chasing Amy standout more than Smith's other movies to me was the serious edge combined with the trademark vulgarity and toilet humor that make Smith's films great.  Ben Affleck plays Holden McNeil and Jason Lee plays Banky Edwards, both of whom are life long friends who write and illustrate their own cult underground comicbook called Bluntman & Chronic which is inspired by good 'ol Jay & Silent Bob.  At a comic convention Holden meets another comic writer named Alyssa Jones (played by the beautifil Joey Lauren Adams), and as they talk to each other more and more they become close friends, and Holden begins to fall in love with her, the only catch is that she is a lesbian.

I wouldn't say there was anything I didn't expect in this film, but I give kudos to director Kevin Smith because he ventures to pursue every reality (while stirring lots of commotion) without compromising his integrity or giving into his critics. It's a true rarity in filmmaking today.Smith's directing style is static yet every frame is so effective. I think the fact that most of his backdrops are an apartment room, a hockey rink and a CD store really solidify the down-to-earthness that help the characters relate to each other, and help viewers relate to the film. Everything in Smith's world, in fact, is approachable: the characters (Holden, Banky, Amy, Jay and SB) all have their idiosyncratic traits that make them lovable, the soundtrack (nothing original, but everything perfect for the film), and the script (filled with great dialogue moments).Chasing Amy is an exploration of a different reality towards love that completely overturns the romantic comedy genre, yet still has something intelligent to say to gays, lesbians and straights alike.

432081,A3MRONM9HTUYNT,6304681526,Pie,"[4, 6]","Now this is Kevin Smith's most intelligent movie of his ""Jersey Trilogy"" of four other movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Dogma could be seen as another intelligent movie, but more religious throughout. Chasing Amy is about love and gender issues, namely homosexuality. The way that Kevin Smith made this movie is terrific in the way that the script and lines are extremly relevant to reality. Ben Affleck plays a guy (a comic book drawer) who falls in love with a woman (played by Joey Lauren Adams, Kevin Smith's then girlfriend) who turns out to be a lesbian. And they find that the other had exactly what the other was looking for, and they fall in love eventually. However, I did feel that we were suddenly thrown into Ben's love for her without a real background or any real structure like in other movies, I dare say. So we see Ben, he sees Alyssa (Lauren Adams), he falls in love and breaks it to her during a rainy night in the car. That scene was the best of all, with a long line that Ben had to say to her. But as I said, I didn't feel any real weight for this to suddenly happen. But, things go well for a while and then when Ben hears that she had had sex with other men before (she IS a lesbian as he understands), things start to tremble down from there on. What Ben proposes in the end makes sense, which I won't reveal for those who have not yet seen the movie. Then of course we see Jay and Silent Bob, and in this movie Silent Bob actually speaks MORE that loud/foul mouthed Jay! And what he says, is wise like always. Jason Lee plays as Ben's comic book partner and he is against Ben's love for Alyssa and he does it well in the movie. Joey Lauren Adams is a good actress for this movie and her relation with Ben in the movie fits in well. This is not the best romantic comedy, but a good all-round choice for everyone, for this is his most intelligent and ""serious"" movie he's made so far.

In a world where everyone has problems, we're all only human, and we all make mistakes, it seems that Alyssa has made far too many to justify her reasons.. which you'll discover within this 50% brilliant, 50% cliche of a movie.  Yes, they use ''bad words'' and are all so sophisticated and sexually driven and experienced, but the characters portrayed in Chasing Amy are all pretty hard to tolerate, let alone buy into, other than Bankie (Jason Lee's realistic, charming, and truthful addition to the cast).  Joey Lauren Adams' Alyssa, .... is shockingly flamboyant in her .......... ways, but is even more of a.. well.. disappointment in casting, as Rene Zellwegger's clone is just not a prime choice for this type of role.Yes, the movie is funny.  Yes, the movie does have a good point behind it.  Yes, I love, adore, and damn near worship Kevin Smith as the best of us movie lovers adamantly do.  However, I am not so blinded by his popularity that I will succumb to what is, at best, a mediocre movie, and give it nothing but positive feedback.  When, well, IF, you watch Chasing Amy, forget any reviews you have read or heard, and just go into it with no expectations, and you'll probably shrug it off as an average movie.  You may even like it.  Unfortunately, I was so pumped up about this movie, that I expected it to be everything that I had heard.

McNally ""Author, 'CLASS DISMISSED: 75 Outr...","[2, 2]","Chasing Amy, the third film in Kevin Smith's classic New Jersey trilogy (along with Clerks and Mallrats), just might be the best of the bunch. It packs Smith's usual envelope-pushing dialogue about sex, relationships, etc. and showcases some great comic performances. If you're feeling tired of boring Hollywood fare, Chasing Amy provides a refreshing slap in the face.Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting, Bounce) plays Holden McNeil, a comic book artist who's still looking for the right woman. While attending a comic-book convention with his roommate and Bluntman & Chronic co-creator Banky (Jason Lee, Almost Famous), he meets Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), and they quickly hit it off. Holden is convinced that he's met future girlfriend material. However, there is one minor problem: She's lesbian, a fact that's conveyed in a hilarious bar scene.After he gets over his initial shock concerning her lesbian preferences, Holden enters into a fast frienship with Alyssa. Their close bond is a source of tension between Holden and Banky, who believes that she's bad news (and perhaps is a bit jealous). As Holden and Alyssa's relationship becomes more intimate, he must also come to grips with her wild past. Whether or not you buy into the film's surprising resolution, there's no denying that it's a ballsy one.Smith's writing is so sharp that almost any actor (or non-actor) can come off looking good. That said, Jason Lee gives a classic comic performance, spouting off numerous un-PC lines, whether introducing a young toddler to his collection of porn magazines or asking Alyssa about her lesbian habits: ""Since you like chicks, do you just look at yourself naked in the mirror all the time?"" Affleck delivers solid work in a gutsy role. How much you like or hate Joey Lauren Adams will depend heavily on how you cope with her nasal, high-pitched voice.Of course, a Kevin Smith film wouldn't be complete without the presence of Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself), and their scene is a keeper. While dining with Holden at a restaurant, the two offer relationship advice that's alternately poignant and hilarious.With a writer/director as daring as Kevin Smith, odds are there will be some scenes in his films that you won't like. However, that's a small price to pay for the many hilarious scenes you do get, and it's also part of the reason that Chasing Amy rewards repeat viewings.",5,Kevin Smith's best film...,1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,2397,"['Chasing', 'Amy', 'third', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'classic', 'New', 'Jersey', 'trilogy', 'Clerks', 'Mallrats', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'bunch', 'Smith', 'usual', 'envelope-pushing', 'dialogue', 'sex', 'relationships', 'etc', 'great', 'comic', 'performances', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'tired', 'boring', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'refreshing', 'slap', 'face.Ben', 'Affleck', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Bounce', 'Holden', 'McNeil', 'comic', 'book', 'artist', 'who', 'still', 'looking', 'right', 'woman', 'attending', 'comic-book', 'convention', 'roommate', 'Bluntman', 'Chronic', 'co-creator', 'Banky', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Alyssa', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'quickly', 'hit', 'off', 'Holden', 'convinced', 'met', 'future', 'girlfriend', 'material', 'However', 'one', 'minor', 'problem', 'lesbian', 'fact', 'conveyed', 'hilarious', 'bar', 'scene.After', 'initial', 'shock', 'concerning', 'lesbian', 'preferences', 'Holden', 'fast', 'frienship', 'Alyssa', 'close', 'bond', 'source', 'tension', 'Holden', 'Banky', 'who', 'bad', 'news', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'jealous', 'Holden', 'Alyssa', 'relationship', 'more', 'intimate', 'must', 'also', 'come', 'grips', 'wild', 'past', 'not', 'buy', 'film', 'surprising', 'resolution', 'denying', 'ballsy', 'one.Smith', 'writing', 'so', 'sharp', 'almost', 'actor', 'non-actor', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'looking', 'good', 'said', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'classic', 'comic', 'performance', 'spouting', 'off', 'numerous', 'un-PC', 'lines', 'introducing', 'young', 'toddler', 'collection', 'porn', 'magazines', 'asking', 'Alyssa', 'lesbian', 'habits', 'chicks', 'do', 'just', 'look', 'naked', 'mirror', 'time', 'Affleck', 'delivers', 'solid', 'work', 'gutsy', 'role', 'How', 'much', 'like', 'hate', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'will', 'depend', 'heavily', 'how', 'cope', 'nasal', 'high-pitched', 'voice.Of', 'course', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complete', 'presence', 'Jay', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Smith', 'scene', 'keeper', 'dining', 'Holden', 'restaurant', 'two', 'offer', 'relationship', 'advice', 'alternately', 'poignant', 'writer/director', 'as', 'daring', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'odds', 'are', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'scenes', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'However', 'small', 'price', 'pay', 'many', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'do', 'get', 'also', 'part', 'reason', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'rewards', 'repeat', 'viewings']",Chasing Amy VHS

No Kevin you hadn't. Chasing Amy was showered with praise and accolades, and for a good reason. Chasing Amy is funny, but it is also very dramatic [anyone who doesn't think so should watch the scene at the hockey rink towards the end] and although Clerks and Mallrats are both undeniably hilarious, Chasing Amy is such a better movie. And it may be because it is a romantic comedy. Now, I hate about 95% of romantic comedies, usually because they are so unrealistic in displaying romance. Not Chasing Amy. It shows that you  can't always win in the game of love, and it displays the ups and downs of every relationship.The story surrounds Holden McNeil, a comic book artist who falls in love with fellow artist, only to discover that she's a lesbian. But at one point he gets his wish that she loves him back. This greatly angers Holden's best friend and fellow artist Banky, a slightly homophobic person who's dealing with being an inker, and having his best friend slowly growing further apart from him. Chasing Amy deals with the issues of love, friendship, growing up, and non pc gay jokes. This is the funniest, and best movie in the New Jersey ""trilogy"". With his trademark dialogue, Kevin Smith delivers again, whether his characters are talking about oral sex scars, or why you shouldn't push love away. The only bad thing about the movie is that Jay and Silent Bob are barely in it at all! But Smith makes up for this by having Silent Bob deliver one of his greatest speeches ever.

432094,AZ6JSCT8F1M7X,6304681526,"""rocksteady969""","[1, 1]","Kevin Smith has quite a list of movies: ""Clerks,"" his first (and funniest) which follows a day in the life of two underachieving convienience store slackers; ""Mallrats,"" not quite as funny but still an entertaining movie (due in large part to the addition of Jason Lee) focusing on the lives of two dumped guys trying to get their girlfriends back; ""Dogma,"" a hilarious satire on religion where two angels have found a loophole in God's handiwork; and of course ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" in which the two Jersey stoners must save their good names from the clutches of Hollywood, which is making a movie based on the comic book versions of themselves.This is no easy list to top. So how does ""Chasing Amy"" do it?First and foremost, it has fantastic characters. Holden, the main character, is a smart, witty, loyal, and persevering individual (and also the best role Ben Affleck has ever played). Banky (Jason Lee) is Holden's cynical, manipulative, but always loyal and protective partner. Alyssa Jones (played wonderfully by Joey Lauren Adams) is a smart, adventurous, unapologetic, and very conflicted woman whom Holden falls in love with. In a more minor role, Hooper LaMont (played hilariously by Dwight Ewell) offers quirky insight as the gay black guy who acts like a black panther whenever confronted by strangers. And let's not forget the dynamic duo, Jay and Silent Bob, who are on long enough for Silent Bob to give his best speech ever.Secondly, it offers plenty of nods to Smith's previous films.  The best is a snippet of conversation between Holden and Jay (Holden: So, what are you guys doing, going to the mall?  Jay: Dude, we gave that ... up years ago).Finally, the plot is flawless. Holden meets Alyssa, is immediately smitten, even after finding out she's a lesbian, and after a while she finally falls in love with him as well. This does not go well with Banky, and partly out of jealousy, partly out of loyalty, he finds information that suggests Holden may not be the first man Alyssa has been with.

This is a more dramatic and less slapstick movie when compared to the other two.  It starts strong with Clerks humor, but evolves into a much deeper story than the other films.  This movie is a perfect date movie, if and only if, both the guy and the girl can deal with the strong homosexual aspect.  It is easy to imagine how people can get caught up in the gay part of the film.  THIS FILM IS NOT ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY.  It is about friendship, love and how dumb us guys can be.  It reminds me of Shawshank Redemption with the friendship between Holden (Affleck) and Banky (Jason Lee).  The love story between Alyssa (Adams) and Holden is captivating and tragic.  Jay and Silent Bob show up as usual for a VA film, but this time Bob gives some depth to his character and really gets to the point of the movie.

Many movie buffs may remember that quote from Kevin Smith's first movie, Clerks, when the two clerks were discussing the difference between the endings of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. In a way, Chasing Amy is much like that in comparison to the endings of Smith's earlier films, Clerks and Mallrats. While this movie still gives the great laughs of the earlier movies, it also has a great amount of seriousness in it. These elements fuel the charm and feeling of Chasing Amy.Holden McNeil(Affleck)and Banky Edwards(Lee)are two comic book artists who work on the comic book, Bluntman and Chronic(based on two rather familiar characters). Life seemed to be going good for them. Then Holden meets Alyssa Jones, a fellow comic book artist and he becomes smitten with her, even after finding out she's a lesbian. Tensions soon stir between Holden and Banky overtheir friendship and Holden soon learns more about Alyssa than he can handle.Chasing Amy is a pure five-star flick. I'm surprised this movie didn't win any major awards. Affleck and Adams are great as the main characters, but Lee gives the best performance. Also check out Dwight Ewell as Hooper X. His confrontations with Lee give the movie it's most hilarious moments, especially with the Archie and Jughead discussion...

432105,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,6304681526,S. Schell,"[21, 24]","So far in Kevin Smith's film career, &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; is his &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; of movie achievements. He went from sardonic, sophomoric comedy to earthly, emotional realism, putting forth an  intensely magnified story of sexuality and the fragile boundaries of love.  His writing maturated into a tale well told involving common debate ground  for customary issues, the ongoing battle of the sexes and the dire  consequences of traversing to the other side of our ironclad gender  coalitions.The ill-fated tale begins with two twenty-somethings  working together on their well-renowned comic book &quot;Bluntman and  Chronic&quot;. Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) and Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck)  are lifelong friends, and what better way to spoil their friendship than to  bring a woman into the picture. Enter Hooper X, the author of a pro-black  comic with a pronounced hedonistic and riotous reputation that belies his  true nature: he's as flamboyantly gay as they come. Hooper X is  stereotypically but nonetheless hilariously portrayed by talented beau  Dwight Ewell. He garners most of the laughs in this film to keep Smith's  deeply emotive content from getting too serious. He acquaints a fellow  comrade from the gay community to Banky and Holden at a comic book  convention, unbeknownst to three of them that this mere introduction is the  beginning of a whirlwind of emotional conflict.The name of the  whirlwind is Alyssa Jones, and upon their first meeting, Holden is on a  mission to claim her. It's not until he and his wisecracking companion are  invited to an outing at a gay bar does Holden realize Alyssa is a bona fide  lesbian and his conquest for a breathless fling is shattered. Unfettered by  her conspicuous sexual agenda, Alyssa pursues a warm and trusting  friendship with Holden, spending time with him over the months, generally  palling around and having a good time. After a stretch, Holden recognizes  that his feelings for Alyssa are beyond platonic, and this is the point in  the movie when everything straight becomes askew (no pun intended).Banky consistently intercedes, knowledgeable of Holden's threshold of  tolerance for relationships. He advises him that his newfound adoration  will not have a pretty ending, but Holden and Alyssa are bull-headedly  driven by their honest affections and defy the odds, including the coarse  rebuff from her once-loyal lesbian clique. Eventually, provided the  complicated circumstances and Banky's mistrust for Alyssa's sordid past,  their relationship unravels and abruptly ends over a heated argument and a  woeful awareness of the impossibility of their happiness.Smith's  writing and direction is in top form in his third installment of young  adult films, reprising his references to notorious characters of the past,  including Alyssa Jones herself, Brandy Spenning, and the unintended  necrophiliac Caitlin Bree. He ties all of his stories together closely,  showing us what a small world it really is, especially in New Jersey. It  also comes as no surprise that Joey Lauren Adams was entitled to the lead  role, being Kevin's girl and all (at the time). She actually proved to be a  greater actress than I thought, admidst her nasal screaming and profane  dialogue. Jason Lee has gotten better over the years, but it's like he's  revisiting his Brody routine with all the endless diatribes he goes on. His  character is witty, but Smith is stereotyping his acting ability every step  of the way by always making him the sideman. Jason Mewes is much improved  here, abating his hyperactive methodology for a more subdued and genuine  disposition. Smith even poked fun at his own work by mocking the ridiculous  &quot;Snootchy Bootchie&quot; dialect that Mewes popularized. A lot of the  actor's lines are Smith's self-effacing humor at work, and they clash  perfectly amongst the love and heartbreak of the movie.Lastly, we have  Ben Affleck as the sensitive chap, a warm and welcome presence after the  total slimeball he played in Smith's horror of a screenplay  &quot;Mallrats&quot;. That material was well beneath him, and thank God  Smith made it up to him by offering him the part of Holden. Ben is  obviously the diamond in the rough here, fine-tuning the level of interest  in the audience with his natural-born charisma. Let's face it: this man is  gorgeous, a headturner. There's no way you can take your eyes off him, nor  ignore that beautiful smile. He was perfect for this part and made a  significant connection with male and female viewers. Women will watch this  film and wonder, &quot;Where the hell can I find a man like  THAT? &quot;To sum all the parts, this is a very worthwhile film and  can touch a lot of people, especially if they've loved and lost for  whatever reason at some point in their lives. This is far from cinematic  genius and I don't think Smith will ever be capable of creating a  masterpiece, but his raw sincerity and whole-hearted approach is meaningful  and direct. That alone is enough to help one gain a new or amended  perspective of life, love and art.",4,Smith Goes Soft For a Favorable Change,964569600,"07 26, 2000",2000,5101,"['So', 'far', 'Kevin', 'Smith',

If you're thinking that's not a recipe for a happy end, you're right -- but the reason it's not a happy end may be a surprise.One of the film's best features is its use and examination of some straight and gay stereotypes to look at the actual emotional content of human sexual relationships. It doesn't necessarily do this in an incredibly sophisticated way, but it's still insightful and entertaining.I was pretty impressed overall with the story, the dialogue, the acting, as well as the fact that this movie was made for just a quarter of a million dollars. In all, it is a good example of a cheap, story-driven, Miramax-style film that has something to say, combined with Kevin-Smith-style (i.e. sometimes pretty crude) comic relief.The DVD extras are practically all taken from an earlier Criterion Laserdisc issue. They include a commentary by about six people involved in making the film, including Smith, Affleck, and Jason Mewes (who played ""Jay"").

In ""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats"" he gave us pure comedy, but in this third installment, he brings a more serious side to the making of ""Chasing Amy"", and what he has created is an excellent movie all around.This is the story of Banke and Holden, the creators of the underground comic book ""Bluntman and Chronic"" (based on the characters of Jay and Silent Bob). Holden falls in love with another comic book writer, Alyssa Jones, who happens to be a lesbian and happens to have a long and infamous sexual history. This is a love story, more than anything, about coming to terms with who you are, who your partner is, and their past. And Smith does this really well. We care and love all of the characters, and there is still plenty of comedy here. The bar scene where Banke and Alyssa are comparing scars from previous sexual episodes is absolutely hilarious.The movie is stolen here by Banke, played by Smith constant Jason Lee. He spews his dialogue with such ferocity and fun, that we cannot help but love his conflicted and overly-aggressive character.There is a big plot twist at the end here, but like Holden says, it seems so inevitable that they all get to this point. This is a great movie, because it is a love story, and a powerful and different one at that, as well as a hilarious comedy. There are plenty of comic book references here, as well as plenty of swearing and sexual dialogue, which makes Smith's writing that much more authentic and believable.Maybe ""Chasing Amy"" isn't the funniest movie Smith has done, but it is definitely the best all-around movie he has made.

It's nearly physically impossible not to love Kevin Smith. The critics and detractors are lying to themselves. How do you not love a director who actually takes to the internet to outflame the web trolls talking smack about him? You can't do it. He's the very image of the self-made man and as much as critics may dog his films, they know as well as I do that behind all of the scatological humor and donkey shows his films run on pure brains and heart. And most of them will readily admit to enjoying this film. Many say it's his best work. I disagree, but it's still a film I believe any person considering ever entering into a romantic relationship should view at least once. Smith takes his Askewniverse cast to a whole different place on this one. And I don't just mean New York.""Chasing Amy"" is what a romantic comedy would be if they were written for intelligent adults and didn't present a ridiculous, unrealistic, sanitized, idealistic, and somewhat insulting view of love. It's the story of a comic book writer whose artistic dreams aren't being fulfilled by the populist ""d!ck and fart jokes"" that make up his commercial success so far. Trying to tell us something about yourself, Mr. Smith? He meets a charming girl from his hometown, falls for her, and gets all ready and set for his happily ever after. Then she starts making out with some chick at a bar. For a long time. Well, at least his friend gets to see what he usually pays to watch for free and in person. But sexuality is a funny and -with some people- fluid thing. Maybe he's got a shot. After all, aren't all lesbians just spinning their wheels until a big strong man comes along to protect them? Not bloody likely. And even if he could snag such a goddess, could he really deal with the sordid past of a former wild child? Would it be worth his friendship with his a-hole of a co-writer? These are all versions of the basic questions you need to ask yourself before entering into a serious relationship. Diving in headfirst is the #1 cause of heartbreak. Hindsight is always 20/20, isn' it?If there is one thing Kevin Smith knows it is people. No film writer or director has the psychology of interpersonal dynamics down like that man does. He understands both the value and pitfalls of friendship and romance in a way that other directors and most people in general simply will never consciously grasp. This is a big part of what makes his films so poignant even in the midst of juvenile gross-out humor and shocking sex-talk and allows him to outclass everyone else who touches the genre, Judd Appatow included. In that sense, I can see why this film is a bit of a critical darling. It does away with much of the childish antics (Jay and Silent bob are only in one scene) and really focuses on the relationship between the leads. But while this may ingratiate ""Chasing Amy"" to the critics, I found a lot not to like.First off: Ben Affleck. It actually shocks me that Affleck ever got another leading role after this film. And it's not all his fault, either. Sure his acting was beyond unlikable, but honestly his character was written as a complete idiot to begin with. A true-to-life idiot, but I still found both Holden and his partner-in-crime Banky (played by Jason Lee) to be completely unrelatable malcontent characters. On the other hand, I'm surprised that Joey Lauren Adams hasn't had more mainstream success after such a smashing performance as the lovable Alyssa. Then again, her voice makes the screaming scenes almost unbearable to listen too. Another gaffe I'd attribute to Smith. While Smith does have great taste in music, the soundtrack becomes a bit distracting at times in this one and his preferences have become too uninspired and predictable. I love Run DMC and Soul Asylum as well, but I wouldn't put their music in every film I made because then they'd all sound the same. He needs to mix it up a little more and get out of the late-80's early-90's alternative stuff once in a while. The film's climax comes off as really half-baked and I actually had my head in my hands out of embarrassment for parts of it. Any love you may have had for Holden will just simply evaporate when you hear how he's going to fix all of their problems. A major, major WTF moment.Yeah, so there's lots of bad. But there are so many more reasons to see this film. To offset the damage done by Affleck's cringe-inducing performance in the climax, the film ends with an extremely convincing relationship coda that thankfully veers away from the sap you believe is about to burst forth and produces a truly touching finale thanks to Adams. Well played, all around. And there are some sick laughs as well, including a character introducing a young child to bestiality porn. So wrong, you have to laugh. Frank discussions about lesbian sex and homosexuality in general also deliver some funny-awkward moments. Seeing Holden get uncomfortable while Alyssa and Banky compare scars they got while performing cunnilingus is just too funny. The best has got to be Dwight Ewell as a gay black man who has to pretend to be militant to sell his afrocentric comics. His staged altercation with Holden and Banky over racism in Star Wars is classic.I remember the first time I saw this I was floored by a scene where Alyssa's gay friends all shun her for considering dating a man. At that point in my life, it never occurred to me that an oppressed minority could have deep-seeded bigotries of their own. In fact, the hypocrisy of insisting that gay people are born the way they are and then using their sexuality as a political statement to the point where a gay woman who experiments with dating a man would be outcast contradicts the entire premise of the gay rights movement. Political statements are choices, biology is not; pick a side. I love that this film made me think about things like that. Also, who could ever forget Fingercuffs? If you don't get that reference, you must see this now.""Chasing Amy"" is a film that shows what love really is and can be. It hurts, it scars, it makes you act like an idiot and self-destruct; but in the end it's what we all crave more then anything else. But as human beings to actually get exactly what we want and feel there's nothing left to attain is to risk indulging those subconscious self-destructive urges. Even with a character like Holden as the lead, I still find the story itself to be extremely relatable. Early in our relationship I had fights with my wife similar in theme to the ones in this film; so similar it makes me physically uncomfortable and self-conscious to watch them. In hindsight, I was an idiot. Like Holden. Okay, not nearly as bad, but I didn't have any pearls of wisdom from Silent Bob to guide me either. The all-or-nothing approach we expect due to the idealized, fictionalized versions of love we are bombarded with in music, television, literature, and film is and will never be a model for a healthy relationship. Only unconditional acceptance of who your partner is and what they've done can provide that. It's too often that we only realize that after people have driven off the ones they love with thoughtless self-indulgent pride.While it is my least favorite film in Smith's Askewniverse so far, ""Chasing Amy"" is still must-see material. It's another very hard film for me to rate because there are so many pros and cons and there isn't really another film like it that I've seen. That alone should make it worth a look. It's not often you're going to hear a Kevin Smith movie described as ""bittersweet"", but that's what this is. It's got all the charm of an indie flick, the shocking humor of a sex comedy, the heart and soul of the most authentic romances, and all the relationship advice you will ever need rolled into a single film. Too bad it also has Ben Affleck.3 1/2 stars rounded up for putting every mainstream romantic comedy to shame. """,4,"""Sure, it's crazy, it's rude, it's self-absorbed, but, uh, you know, it's love.

That type of summation while in some ways correct actually does a great disservice to the movie by distracting people from its most impressive accomplishments.In Chasing Amy, Kevin Smith has created a modern day love story that accepts certain realities. One of them is not everyone knows exactly what they are in terms of their sexuality and some people choose to explore that great unknown while many choose to hide from it for what it may reveal.In Holden and Banky, Smith creates two ""straight"" male characters who have formed a strong friendship that sees them live, work and essentially spend their lives together. Holden seems like a confidently straight male, which allows him to blend easily with gay friends. Banky, however, is revealed to be straight possibly because of how he was raised as his character raises a little too much of a fuss by Holden's new relationship with Alyssa Jones.  Previous to her relationship with Holden, Alyssa lived as a lesbian, but as the story moves forward we realize that she is really someone just open with her sexuality that found the lifestyle that worked for her through a courageous journey of self-discovery. She is a new type of personality that film has not embraced as wholly as Smith does here. Chasing Amy does not judge the Alyssa character; instead it takes her sexual past and lifts her to a higher level of maturity and self-awareness that leaves both Banky and Holden in awe. As their personal lifestyles seem limited compared to what Alyssa has allowed herself to become.As the story reveals itself you learn that the lesbian angle is really just the icing on the cake and that at the core of Chasing Amy lies a story about two men whose friendship goes down the tubes when confronted with an outside element that challenges their previous perceptions of themselves. As a result, Chasing Amy challenges its viewers idea of romantic relationships as titles such as ""gay"" or ""straight"" eventually lose their importance in a movie about three people trying to deal with their feelings for others.Ben Affleck has yet to accomplish what he does in Chasing Amy again in his career, as he plays Holden with a laid back charm that does not hint at the now over exposed A-list actor he is. Joey Lauren Adams plays Alyssa Jones as someone who wears her past proudly, but not ridiculously over-the-top, making her completely believable as a love interest for Holden. But the real star turn is Jason Lee as he allows Banky to be the jerk the story needs while allowing the character's insecurities be made plainly visible, making him less of an idiot and more like someone just being honest about who he is.The end result is a movie which all young people dealing with their own personal lifestyle decisions, in my opinion, should watch as the road Holden chooses to go down at the end of the movie reveals just how much his seemingly enlightened character has in common with Banky. The revelation that some people may not be as open and evolved as they think is the real accomplishment of Chasing Amy.",5,A Relationship Movie Young People Should See,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,3153,"['misconception', 'out', 'movie', 'land', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'guy', 'who', 'lesbian', 'type', 'summation', 'ways', 'correct', 'actually', 'great', 'disservice', 'movie', 'distracting', 'people', 'most', 'impressive', 'accomplishments.In', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'created', 'modern', 'day', 'love', 'story', 'certain', 'realities', 'One', 'not', 'everyone', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'people', 'choose', 'explore', 'great', 'unknown', 'many', 'choose', 'hide', 'what', 'may', 'reveal.In', 'Holden', 'Banky', 'Smith', 'two', 'straight', 'male', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'formed', 'strong', 'friendship', 'live', 'work', 'essentially', 'spend', 'lives', 'together', 'Holden', 'confidently', 'straight', 'male', 'blend', 'easily', 'gay', 'friends', 'Banky', 'however', 'revealed', 'be', 'straight', 'possibly', 'how', 'was', 'raised', 'character', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'fuss', 'Holden', 'new', 'relationship', 'Alyssa', 'Jones', 'Previous', 'relationship', 'Holden', 'Alyssa', 'lived', 'lesbian', 'story', 'forward', 'realize', 'really', 'someone', 'just', 'open', 'sexuality', 'found', 'lifestyle', 'worked', 'courageous', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'new', 'type', 'personality', 'film', 'not', 'embraced', 'as', 'wholly', 'Smith', 'here', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'not', 'judge', 'Alyssa', 'character', 'instead', 'sexual', 'past', 'higher', 'level', 'maturity', 'self-awareness', 'Banky', 'Holden', 'awe', 'personal', 'lifestyles', 'seem', 'limited', 'compared', 'what', 'Alyssa', 'allowed', 'become.As', 'story', 'learn', 'lesbian', 'angle', 'really', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'core', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'friendship', 'down', 'tubes', 'when', 'confronted', 'outside', 'element', 'previous', 'perceptions', 'result', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'viewers', 'idea', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'titles', 'such', 'gay', 'straight', 'eventually', 'lose', 'importance', 'movie', 'three', 'people', 'trying', 'deal', 'feelings', 'others.Ben', 'Affleck', 'yet', 'accomplish', 'what', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'again', 'career', 'Holden', 'laid', 'back', 'charm', 'not', 'hint', 'now', 'exposed', 'A-list', 'actor', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Alyssa', 'Jones', 'someone', 'who', 'past', 'proudly', 'not', 'ridiculously', 'over-the-top', 'making', 'completely', 'believable', 'love', 'interest', 'Holden', 'real', 'star', 'turn', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Banky', 'be', 'jerk', 'story', 'needs', 'allowing', 'character', 'insecurities', 'be', 'made', 'plainly', 'visible', 'making', 'less', 'idiot', 'more', 'someone', 'just', 'being', 'honest', 'who', 'end', 'result', 'movie', 'young', 'people', 'dealing', 'own', 'personal', 'lifestyle', 'decisions', 'opinion', 'should', 'watch', 'road', 'Holden', 'go', 'down', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'seemingly', 'enlightened', 'character', 'common', 'Banky', 'revelation', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'open', 'evolved', 'think', 'real', 'accomplishment', 'Chasing', 'Amy']",Chasing Amy VHS

432127,A38JKOT65RLZ9Q,6304681526,Wayne Rossi,"[0, 2]","After Clerks and Mallrats, one a more genuine, lifelike comedy and the other a funny slapstick piece, I don't know that anybody expected Kevin Smith to something like Chasing Amy.It should be made pretty clear:  this is romantic drama movie that has funny parts in it.  All the romantic comedies that Hollywood throws at the screen don't have what Chasing Amy has.  Most of the humor here is allowed to come from the characters themselves, instead of situation (hence sit-coms as staple bad comedy).  And it's all accomplished by Kevin Smith dialogue.  It's not exactly what people say in real life, at times, but there is a definite ring of truth to what characters say in Smith's films, which just makes it all work.One thing that will be noteworthy in Chasing Amy is the urge to smack Holden (Ben Affleck) around at times.  That's okay--his character is very, very human.  Banky (Jason Lee) has some elements in common with Brody (Lee's character in Mallrats), but here there are sub-surface layers that run a lot deeper.  Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams) is also a very good, multi-layered character, and the interaction between Adams and Affleck is one of the things that drives the movie in a lot of respects.  There doesn't seem to be too much contrivance in the things that the characters go through--it's a film about the mistakes imperfect people make in their lives.As a film, Chasing Amy is Kevin Smith's best piece by a fairly big margin.  Since it's not really a comedy, by any measure, it can't be judged as a comedy--and as a film about people (with funny parts--even outright comedic ones like the first scene with Hooper X) it succeeds by quite a big margin.  Touching as it does on indie comics, as well, was a great move on Smith's part--it may be a relatively minor factor, but that also helps establish the characters on a particular fringe and give the film a bit of a life of its own on that direction.One issue that turns up--and is not always batted away by Smith in comedic fashion--is sexuality.  Particularly, the attitude Holden has and the one Banky has are seen as shallow and must be accounted for in the course of the film.  (Where the change is more lasting is up for debate, but there is definitely a confrontation with the values held.)  Meanwhile, Alyssa comes to terms with her own issues, though Holden coming to terms with them is considerably harder.  It is this element that could have easily ruined a perfectly good film, but instead simply contributes to the depth of the characters and their development.  I'm not writing this to say that the movie will change anyone's sexuality, but simply that it does ask the viewer at times to reconsider the light he or she views the issue in...which is pretty daring for a film from someone who preceded it with two comedies.This film belongs in the DVD library of anyone who likes Smith's work, or just likes honest, character-driven films.  The DVD extras--particularly deleted scenes that add some more to character or humor (particularly the extended opening)--make buying this on DVD the only option.  The only problem is that the DVD cover features an overly prettyboyish Ben Affleck, sans goatee and general attitude that he carried so well in the film.",5,And from out in left field...,1001462400,"09 26, 2001",2001,3240,"['Clerks', 'Mallrats', 'one', 'more', 'genuine', 'lifelike', 'comedy', 'other', 'funny', 'slapstick', 'piece', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anybody', 'expected', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'something', 'Chasing', 'Amy.It', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'pretty', 'clear', 'romantic', 'drama', 'movie', 'funny', 'parts', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Hollywood', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Most', 'humor', 'here', 'allowed', 'come', 'characters', 'instead', 'situation', 'hence', 'sit-coms', 'staple', 'bad', 'comedy', 'accomplished', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'dialogue', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'real', 'life', 'times', 'definite', 'ring', 'truth', 'what', 'characters', 'say', 'Smith', 'films', 'just', 'work.One', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'urge', 'smack', 'Holden', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'around', 'times', 'okay', 'character', 'very', 'very', 'human', 'Banky', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'elements', 'common', 'Brody', 'Lee', 'character', 'Mallrats', 'here', 'are', 'sub-surface', 'layers', 'run', 'lot', 'deeper', 'Alyssa', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'multi-layered', 'character', 'interaction', 'Adams', 'Affleck', 'one', 'things', 'movie', 'lot', 'respects', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'contrivance', 'things', 'characters', 'go', 'film', 'mistakes', 'imperfect', 'people', 'make', 'lives.As', 'film', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'best', 'piece', 'fairly', 'big', 'margin', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'measure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'judged', 'comedy', 'film', 'people', 'funny', 'parts', 'even', 'outright', 'comedic', 'ones', 'first', 'scene', 'Hooper', 'X', 'quite', 'big', 'margin', 'Touching', 'indie', 'comics', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'great', 'move', 'Smith', 'part', 'may', 'be', 'relatively', 'minor', 'factor', 'also', 'establish', 'characters', 'particular', 'fringe', 'give', 'film', 'bit', 'life', 'own', 'direction.One', 'issue', 'up', 'not', 'always', 'batted', 'away', 'Smith', 'comedic', 'fashion', 'sexuality', 'Particularly', 'attitude', 'Holden', 'one', 'Banky', 'are', 'seen', 'shallow', 'must', 'be', 'accounted', 'course', 'film', 'Where', 'change', 'more', 'lasting', 'up', 'debate', 'definitely', 'confrontation', 'values', 'held', 'Meanwhile', 'Alyssa', 'terms', 'own', 'issues', 'Holden', 'coming', 'terms', 'considerably', 'harder', 'element', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'ruined', 'perfectly', 'good', 'film', 'instead', 'simply', 'depth', 'characters', 'development', ""'m"", 'not', 'writing', 'say', 'movie', 'will', 'change', 'anyone', 'sexuality', 'simply', 'ask', 'viewer', 'times', 'reconsider', 'light', 'issue', 'pretty', 'daring', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'preceded', 'two', 'comedies.This', 'film', 'belongs', 'DVD', 'library', 'anyone', 'who', 'Smith', 'work', 'just', 'likes', 'honest', 'character-driven', 'films', 'DVD', 'extras', 'particularly', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'add', 'more', 'character', 'humor', 'particularly', 'extended', 'opening', 'make', 'buying', 'DVD', 'only', 'option', 'only', 'problem', 'DVD', 'cover', 'overly', 'prettyboyish', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'goatee', 'general', 'attitude', 'carried', 'so', 'well', 'film']",Chasing Amy VHS
432128,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,6304681526,wellwellwell,"[1, 1]","In certainly Kevin Smith's most dramatic film, the brilliant acting is spread to more than just one individual (in `Clerks' it was O`Halloran; in `Mallrats' it was Jason Lee).  Some will cite the use of the f-word and sexist themes to be unnecessary; however, they are what make `Chasing Amy' a Kevin Smith movie.  But the acting, the real story, and the unlimited comedy are what make this such an awe-inspiring movie.  The duos here -- of Ben Affleck and Lee; then Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams -- easily make this movie one that anyone can enjoy; even if they're not a huge Kevin Smith admirer.  Yet in the end, it's Smith himself who makes this movie so astounding and worthwhile.As many of the other reviewers have done a superb job in reviewing the plot of `Chasing Amy', there is really no need for me to go into great detail.  We all know it's about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian.  But it's the way this happens that makes it so entertaining.  Affleck (as Holden McNeil) does a perfect job with the role; as you can gradually see how he is affected by Alyssa.  We all know that Holden and Alyssa do eventually fall ""in love"".  But it's not just like that.  There's much that leads up to it; including efforts by the character of Banky Edwards (played by Jason Lee) to warn Holden of the consequences.  I completely agree with another reviewer in stating Lee deserved the best supporting role of `97 for his part here.  Not only for his drama-like scenes, but also for the many bits of comedy he brings to the film.  He is, in all probability, my favorite actor because of this movie.  We also know that Jay and Silent Bob are only featured for about 10 minutes.  And for you ""snootchie bootchies!"" fanatics out there: you may be slightly dissatisfied with that fact, yet you should realize that `Amy' is only the warm-up for `Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back' (many of these lines and actions between Affleck and Jay are reused in the 2001 classic).  This film acts as an introduction to the Bluntman & Chronic comic; even though the comic itself has no real influence on the story's outcome.  As I've said, it's Kevin who makes the movie.  I won't spoil anything for you as you probably already know anyway.  But midway through the film you'll [most likely] be wondering what the title has to do with the movie.There is almost nothing wrong with `Chasing Amy' (I'd give it 4.75 stars, not just four), but some of the characters are almost too down-to-earth for us to handle.  For example, the character of Hooper-X (Dwight Ewell) as a gay, black man may make it awkward for the layperson.  And the same goes for the appearance of Carmen Lee (as Kim, Alyssa`s quote-unquote: fxck buddy).  But overall there's little, if anything, that makes this movie imperfect.  On a brighter note, the cast list for this movie is almost exactly the same as `Mallrats'.  But two newbies do appear.  I.e. Matt Damon (with a cameo) and Casey Affleck (Ben's little brother).  And even though both have small appearances, both add prominence to the film's brilliance.In ranking Kevin Smith's five movies, I would put `Amy' at number four (1. Mallrats | 2. J&SBSB; | 3. Dogma).  But don't let my rank fool you; this is an excellent movie that everyone should view at least once (except for children).  That rank is my opinion.  And remember, opinions work like suggestions; and they can be argued and/or changed.  There's many aspects of this that could make it your favorite Smith film.  In contrast, there's definitely aspects that may allow you to find any of his other movies more enjoyable.  I'm sort of in between.  There's great comedy present here, but maybe not enough for some Smith fans.  There's great drama present here, but maybe a bit too much; again, for some Smith fans.  I look forward with great anticipation to Kevin`s next movie: `Jersey Girl'.  It comes out towards the end of summer and has been said to be better than this one.  But for now we should still embrace `Chasing Amy'.  Whatever the case may be; and whatever your views on Kevin Smith and his movies, I highly recommend `Chasing Amy' to anyone and everyone out there.",4,A smarter side of Kevin Smith (4.75 stars),1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,4147,"['certainly', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'most', 'dramatic', 'film', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'spread', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'individual', 'Clerks', 'was', 'O', 'Halloran', 'Mallrats', 'was', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'will', 'cite', 'use', 'f-word', 'sexist', 'themes', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'however', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movie', 'acting', 'real', 'story', 'unlimited', 'comedy', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'such', 'awe-inspiring', 'movie', 'duos', 'here', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Lee', 'then', 'Affleck', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'easily', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'huge', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'admirer', 'end', 'Smith', 'who', 'movie', 'so', 'astounding', 'worthwhile.As', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'reviewing', 'plot', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'really', 'need', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'know', 'guy', 'who', 'love', 'lesbian', 'way', 'so', 'entertaining', 'Affleck', 'Holden', 'McNeil', 'perfect', 'job', 'role', 'can', 'gradually', 'see', 'how', 'affected', 'Alyssa', 'know', 'Holden', 'Alyssa', 'do', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'just', 'much', 'up', 'including', 'efforts', 'character', 'Banky', 'Edwards', 'played', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'warn', 'Holden', 'consequences', 'completely', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'stating', 'Lee', 'deserved', 'best', 'supporting', 'role', '97', 'part', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'drama-like', 'scenes', 'also', 'many', 'bits', 'comedy', 'film', 'probability', 'favorite', 'actor', 'movie', 'also', 'know', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'are', 'only', 'featured', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'snootchie', 'bootchies', 'out', 'there', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'dissatisfied', 'fact', 'yet', 'should', 'realize', 'Amy', 'only', 'warm-up', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Strike', 'Back', 'many', 'lines', 'actions', 'Affleck', 'Jay', 'are', 'reused', '2001', 'classic', 'film', 'introduction', 'Bluntman', 'Chronic', 'comic', 'even', 'comic', 'real', 'influence', 'story', 'outcome', ""'ve"", 'said', 'Kevin', 'who', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'anyway', 'midway', 'film', ""'ll"", '[', 'most', 'likely', ']', 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'title', 'do', 'movie.There', 'almost', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Chasing', 'Amy', ""'d"", 'give', '4.75', 'stars', 'not', 'just', 'four', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'down-to-earth', 'handle', 'example', 'character', 'Hooper-X', 'Dwight', 'Ewell', 'gay', 'black', 'man', 'may', 'make', 'awkward', 'layperson', 'same', 'appearance', 'Carmen', 'Lee', 'Kim', 'Alyssa', 's', 'quote-unquote', 'fxck', 'buddy', 'overall', 'little', 'anything', 'movie', 'imperfect', 'brighter', 'note', 'cast', 'list', 'movie', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'Mallrats', 'two', 'newbies', 'do', 'appear', 'I.e', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'cameo', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Ben', 'little', 'brother', 'even', 'have', 'small', 'appearances', 'add', 'prominence', 'film', 'brilliance.In', 'ranking', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'five', 'movies', 'would', 'put', 'Amy', 'number', 'four', '1', 'Mallrats', '|', '2', 'J', 'SBSB', '3', 'Dogma', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'rank', 'fool', 'excellent', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'view', 'least', 'once', 'children', 'rank', 'opinion', 'remember', 'opinions', 'work', 'suggestions', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'and/or', 'changed', 'many', 'aspects', 'could', 'make', 'favorite', 'Smith', 'film', 'contrast', 'definitely', 'aspects', 'may', 'allow', 'find', 'other', 'movies', 'more', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'sort', 'great', 'comedy', 'present', 'here', 'maybe', 'not', 'enough', 'Smith', 'fans', 'great', 'drama', 'present', 'here', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'again', 'Smith', 'fans', 'look', 'forward', 'great', 'anticipation', 'Kevin', 's', 'next', 'movie', 'Jersey', 'Girl', 'out', 'end', 'summer', 'been', 'said', 'be', 'better', 'one', 'now', 'should', 'still', 'embrace', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'views', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movies', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'there']",Chasing Amy VHS

432132,A3OI841P5R6FCH,6304681526,Zagnorch,"[0, 0]","I finally have to admit it... Kevin Smith's a genius in the indie film scene. Although I saw a spark of that wizardry in CLERKS &amp; MALLRATS, it wasn't `til my first look at the third chapter in the four-part (soon to be five) ""New Jersey Trilogy"". Yes, CHASING AMY was proof positive to me that the guy who plays `Quiet Robert' is one of the greatest creative talents in film. Why? One reason...With CHASING AMY, he became one of a small handful writer/directors to produce a romantic comedy that was successful in appealing mainly to guys (the rest of that handful is reserved for the makers of the much-bigger-budgeter ""There's Something About Mary""). He knew just the right formula, too: first, get a romantic relationship going between a big, fairly macho guy and a lesbian- you know, a match you'd never figure could never happen in a million years. Then, have the guys' best friend &amp; co-worker try to sabotage the relationship at every opportunity. Add a few sexual &amp; scatological yuks ( I consider Banky &amp; Alyssa's swapping stories about their sexual encounter `war wounds' to be the funniest scene in all of the Smith flicks) here &amp; there, a reference or two that ties into the previous chapters of the NJT, several references to comic books and the Star Wars Trilogy (gotta appeal to the geeks, you know), and voila!Oh, all right, there's more to it than that. There's also the obligatory scene featuring Jay &amp; Silent Bob where the latter member of the pair is at his least silent (he seems to ramble on forever here), getting down to the basic message of the whole movie. After taking a look at this scene, you'll discover who the REAL man is in the Jay &amp; Silent Bob relationship. Mr. Bob is to Smith flicks what those ""Dummies"" books are for layman computer users. Kind of a ""Movie Plots for Dummies"" guide, you know? Anyway, our hero Holden, the one on the receiving end of Bob's advice, gets it a little too late in the game to help matters any. Pretty unfortunate, but that's life for you.Like many of its other DVD presentations, Criterion really went all-out to include as many extras as possible in their release of CHASING AMY.  There's a second audio track featuring commentary by Smith, Ben Affleck, &amp; several others, trailers, deleted scenes &amp; outtakes, and a lot more. In most cases, I prefer having the cut scenes from a film restored to the flick. But in this instance (at least in my opinion), many of the cut scenes wouldn't have worked out as well if they were put back in. However, most of `em were rather hilarious in their own right.
