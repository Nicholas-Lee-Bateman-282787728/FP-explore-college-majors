974080,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000EMG90O,andy8047,"[5, 5]","The 1983-84 season,the sixth of CBS's The Dukes Of Hazzard,turned out to be exactly the same as it was when the Emmy-winning comedy adventure premiered on January 26,1979. The series' stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider triumphantly returned shortly before the end of the fifth season,after an agreement was reached between them and Warner Bros.,DOH's production company. Wopat and Schneider have not received a penny for Dukes games,toys and other memorabilia that sold all over America and other countries as well. So that led to their temporary departure from DOH. During their departure,the DOH ratings were at an all-time low and skyrocketed again upon their return. I thought Coy and Vance,portrayed respectively by Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer,were excellent but many DOH fans believe they didn't have the ""star power"" that Wopat and Schneider carried. Hazzard County again has only one deputy,that being Enos Strate(Sonny Shroyer) who still worshipps Daisy(Catherine Bach) as if she's a goddess. J.D. ""Boss"" Hogg's cousin Cletus was gone by the end of season 5,and there was no mention of what happened to him. Boss(the late Sorrell Booke) and Hazzard County sheriff Roscoe Coltrane(James Best) are still hoping and praying for Bo(Schneider) and Luke(Wopat) to wind up behind bars. The Dukes' Uncle Jesse(the late Denver Pyle),service station attendant Cooter Davenport(Ben Jones) and Roscoe's ""velvet ears"" basset hound Flash are still here also.

They should have done of the here is what it looked like back then and then a shot of what it is like now. It would have been cool to see Tom and John driving around the town square in a General Lee. They done it with the Boars Nest shot why not with other places. The feature on the 69 charger was a joke. The should have showed the cars being built for the show, how they looked when the crashes were over,  and showed the actors driving the General Lee from a behind the scene standpoint.

If you are a long time fan of the show you will remember that during the shows fifth season Bo and Luke had left Hazzard county to pursue their Nascar dreams. The main characters during that season were their cousins Coy and Vance and Bo and Luke returned to town toward the end of the season. Well season six is all Bo and Luke.The 1983/84 season began with the episode ""Lulu's Gone Away."" In this season premiere Lulu leaves Boss Hogg and moves out. When she is kidnapped by three bad guys it's up to Bo and Luke to save the day. It's a pretty exciting Dukes episode.The season six episodes are your standard Dukes of Hazzard fare. Another stand out episode of the season is the episode ""Two Many Roscoes."" In this episode Roscoe is replaced by an imposter who is really a criminal. At one time ""Two Many Roscoe's"" and ""Lulu's Gone Away,"" were both packaged together and released on VHS. The Dukes also got to have a little NASCAR fun when they go undercover in the two part episode ""Undercover Dukes Part 1 & 2.""The box set is very colorful and Warner did a great job with the set.

974087,A21Z70H87S8XJ1,B000EMG90O,DukesFan01,"[46, 49]","When John Schneider and Tom Wopat walked off ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" at the start of the show's fifth season over a dispute with Warner Brothers, many thought the show would never recover. Schneider and Wopat were replaced by two actors (Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer) who were forced to basically imitate the characters of Bo and Luke Duke, without making their own mark. The show marched on, and though it appeared to lose some of its luster, all that changed when Schneider and Wopat returned late in the fifth season for a royal Hazzard homecoming.One of the disputes Schneider and Wopat were having with Warner was the lack of innovative or fresh scripts, and it appears that the writers took this into consideration when creating this, the sixth season, of ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" Several of the episodes deal with more mature topics (well, as mature as the ""Dukes"" show goes!), like 'A Boy's Best Friend,' which centers around the Duke boys coming to the aid of an orphan boy; 'Brotherly Love,' which chronicles the return of Luke's long lost baby brother; 'Cooter's Girl,' where the character played by Ben Jones meets his estranged daughter; or 'The Boar's Nest Bears,' where a boy who just lost his father is comforted by the Duke family through a good old fashion basketball tournament, albeit with the interference of Boss Hogg.I dare say that a few of the episodes are downright suspenseful and edgier, most notably 'Enos's Last Chance,' where Sonny Shroyer's character is chased down by a hit man bent on revenge on the Hazzard deputy. (This is one of my most favorite episodes of the entire run of ""The Dukes of Hazzard."") This season also produces one of those classic '80s 2-part episodes built around a big storyline in 'Undercover Dukes,' which is surely one of the most creative and intriguing episodes of the entire series run, most likely due to the tension that is played out within the Duke family during this episode.  Then there is 'Play It Again, Luke,"" where Luke's former girlfriend, now a rising singer, returns to Hazzard as her manager tries to cash in on her life-insurance policy.A discussion on season six of this series wouldn't be complete without mentioning the classic episode 'Two Many Rosco's,' where James Best plays a dual role and shows off some of his old dramatic acting skills. And longtime cast member Peggy Rea returns as Lulu Hogg in 'Lulu's Gone Away,' where Sorrel Booke's character of Boss Hogg continues to shine in an episode that shows both Boss Hogg's softer side and grittier side while trying to catch the kidnappers who abducted her.All these shows still contain all of the lighthearted antics of Boss Hogg and Rosco (who are funnier and cleverer than ever in this season), the warm and down-home charm of Uncle Jesse (played by Denver Pyle) and the sultry sexiness of Catherine Bach, who is still wearing her 'Daisy Duke' shorts during these late-era ""Dukes"" seasons.It is amazing to see how well the show continued into its sixth season (not to mention rebounding from the overhauled fifth season), and a lot of the episodes found here are incredibly fresher and better written than some of the episodes found in earlier seasons. This season of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" ranks up there with the best of them all, and is highly recommended. A big thanks to Warner Brothers for releasing this series in a timely fashion and treating it with the respect it deserves. They don't make good, wholesome family fun shows like this anymore!Bonus features for this season release feature Ben Jones (Cooter) and Sonny Shroyer (Enos) in a tour of the original Hazzard County, which was actually Covington, Georgia, where the first episodes of the series were originally filmed, and a special documentary on the Dukes' famous car, the General Lee.",5,A late series resurgence,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,3797,"['When', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Tom', 'Wopat', 'walked', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'start', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'dispute', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'many', 'thought', 'show', 'would', 'never', 'recover', 'Schneider', 'Wopat', 'were', 'replaced', 'two', 'actors', 'Byron', 'Cherry', 'Christopher', 'Mayer', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'basically', 'imitate', 'characters', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'Duke', 'making', 'own', 'mark', 'show', 'marched', 'appeared', 'lose', 'luster', 'changed', 'when', 'Schneider', 'Wopat', 'returned', 'late', 'fifth', 'season', 'royal', 'Hazzard', 'homecoming.One', 'disputes', 'Schneider', 'Wopat', 'were', 'having', 'Warner', 'was', 'lack', 'innovative', 'fresh', 'scripts', 'writers', 'took', 'consideration', 'when', 'creating', 'sixth', 'season', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Several', 'episodes', 'deal', 'more', 'mature', 'topics', 'well', 'as', 'mature', 'Dukes', 'show', 'A', 'Boy', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Duke', 'coming', 'aid', 'orphan', 'boy', ""'Brotherly"", 'Love', 'return', 'Luke', 'long', 'lost', 'baby', 'brother', 'Girl', 'where', 'character', 'played', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'estranged', 'daughter', ""'The"", 'Boar', 'Nest', 'Bears', 'where', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'father', 'comforted', 'Duke', 'family', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'basketball', 'tournament', 'interference', 'Boss', 'Hogg.I', 'dare', 'say', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'downright', 'suspenseful', 'edgier', 'most', 'notably', 'Last', 'Chance', 'where', 'Sonny', 'Shroyer', 'character', 'chased', 'down', 'hit', 'man', 'bent', 'revenge', 'Hazzard', 'deputy', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'entire', 'run', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'season', 'also', 'one', 'classic', '2-part', 'episodes', 'built', 'big', 'storyline', ""'Undercover"", 'Dukes', 'surely', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'intriguing', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'run', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'tension', 'played', 'out', 'Duke', 'family', 'episode', 'Then', ""'Play"", 'Again', 'Luke', 'where', 'Luke', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'now', 'rising', 'singer', 'returns', 'Hazzard', 'manager', 'tries', 'cash', 'life-insurance', 'policy.A', 'discussion', 'season', 'six', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'classic', 'episode', 'Many', 'Rosco', 'where', 'James', 'Best', 'dual', 'role', 'off', 'old', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'skills', 'longtime', 'cast', 'member', 'Peggy', 'Rea', 'Lulu', 'Hogg', ""'Lulu"", 'Gone', 'Away', 'where', 'Sorrel', 'Booke', 'character', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'shine', 'episode', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'softer', 'side', 'grittier', 'side', 'trying', 'catch', 'kidnappers', 'who', 'abducted', 'her.All', 'shows', 'still', 'contain', 'lighthearted', 'antics', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'Rosco', 'who', 'are', 'funnier', 'cleverer', 'ever', 'season', 'warm', 'down-home', 'charm', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'played', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'sultry', 'sexiness', 'Catherine', 'Bach', 'who', 'still', 'wearing', ""'Daisy"", 'Duke', 'shorts', 'late-era', 'Dukes', 'seasons.It', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'show', 'continued', 'sixth', 'season', 'not', 'mention', 'rebounding', 'overhauled', 'fifth', 'season', 'lot', 'episodes', 'found', 'here', 'are', 'incredibly', 'fresher', 'better', 'written', 'episodes', 'found', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'season', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'highly', 'recommended', 'big', 'thanks', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'releasing', 'series', 'timely', 'fashion', 'treating', 'respect', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'wholesome', 'family', 'fun', 'anymore', 'Bonus', 'season', 'release', 'feature', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'Cooter', 'Sonny', 'Shroyer', 'Enos', 'tour', 'original', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'was', 'actually', 'Covington', 'Georgia', 'where', 'first', 'episodes', 'series', 'were', 'originally', 'filmed', 'special', 'documentary', 'Dukes', 'famous', 'car', 'General', 'Lee']",The Dukes of Hazzard: Season 6

And also, like many of you, I agree that The Dukes of Hazzard sixth season is among the best, if not the best, of the series entire run. For me personally, the Dukes sixth season is in a tie with thier second season, for my most favorite of the entire series. I also agree that the episodes featured this season are more suspensful, sometimes ""edgy"", and intriuging. But don't let that turn some of you away....the show still retains it's trademark humor, there's still plenty of the usual car chases, classic General Lee jumps, and the amusing banter between Boss Hogg and the Duke family. My personal favorite episode for the sixth season is ""Undercover Dukes."" It's a two-part episode, that was probably made for sweeps week that season. The episode centers around Bo and Luke going ""under cover"" for Uncle Sam, by going back to the NASCAR circuit, to get the goods on a mob boss. This is one of those more suspensful episodes, but also still has the Dukes humor, car chases, etc. The acting (from all the players) is in top-notch form in this episode.

Many will not like what I have to say, but the Dukes of Hazzard should have ended when Coy and Vance we're even thought about replacing Luke and Bo.First off, I'm a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard. Season 1 and Season 2 that is. My biggest pet peave is that the ""realism"" died clearly after Season 2 was over. Season 1, filmed directly in beautiful Covington Georiga, not on a Hollywood backlot, simply has a better feeling at being at a real-time locale. The storylines, the writing, the realism of the show simply died. And I am still annoyed by the projector screen backdrops when the actors are driving their vehicles. It looked so much better when they were actually in the car with the camera on the hood of the car. It's those teeny added touches from Season 1 and 2 that are sorely missed.Season 6 improved on the mark by having a little more serious storylines but it's still not the original Dukes of Hazzard that I love from the '79 episodes. Rosco ruined it for me as his character basically turned into a bumbling baffoon and his stupidity got worse from season to season. Season 6 is certainly no expection.  Season 1 and 2 his believablity as being a dramatical actor was present and was certainly a believeable lawman. Now he just looks dumb on screen. I know they went for the ""comedic"" route as the seasons progressed, but why not stick with what made the original series so great.Sorrell Booke (Boss Hogg) basically got dumber too as the series has progressed. No longer a intelligent criminal politican, he's just another idiot by Rosco's side. I was pleased to see Enos, Luke and Bo return at the end of Season 5, but the storylines of 6 still far short. Storylines, and good script writing is very difficult to do. Think about it, this series has a whopping 140+ episodes in all, so I don't blame the writers totally, it's simply all the good stuff was used up. You'll see it really coming to a abrupt end in season 6 when you watch the episode with the little green men from Mars coming down to Hazzard.However, fans of the series should probably own every episode. Even though I'll probably watch this collection one last time, I always find myself going back to Season 1 where it all got started. The first 7 episodes are 7 hours of pure fresh fun from Hazzard and defintely shows how the show became so darn popular.",3,After season 2 I just never got back into Hazzard County.,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,2392,"['Let', 'cut', 'out', 'CB', 'Shuck', 'Jive', 'once', 'Many', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'when', 'Coy', 'Vance', ""'re"", 'even', 'thought', 'replacing', 'Luke', 'Bo.First', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '2', 'biggest', 'pet', 'peave', 'realism', 'died', 'clearly', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'over', 'Season', '1', 'filmed', 'directly', 'beautiful', 'Covington', 'Georiga', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'backlot', 'simply', 'better', 'feeling', 'being', 'real-time', 'locale', 'storylines', 'writing', 'realism', 'show', 'simply', 'died', 'am', 'still', 'annoyed', 'projector', 'screen', 'backdrops', 'when', 'actors', 'are', 'driving', 'vehicles', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'were', 'actually', 'car', 'camera', 'hood', 'car', 'teeny', 'added', 'touches', 'Season', '1', '2', 'are', 'sorely', 'missed.Season', '6', 'improved', 'mark', 'having', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'storylines', 'still', 'not', 'original', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'love', ""'79"", 'episodes', 'Rosco', 'ruined', 'character', 'basically', 'turned', 'bumbling', 'baffoon', 'stupidity', 'got', 'worse', 'season', 'season', 'Season', '6', 'certainly', 'expection', 'Season', '1', '2', 'believablity', 'being', 'dramatical', 'actor', 'was', 'present', 'was', 'certainly', 'believeable', 'lawman', 'Now', 'just', 'dumb', 'screen', 'know', 'went', 'comedic', 'route', 'seasons', 'progressed', 'why', 'not', 'stick', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'series', 'so', 'great.Sorrell', 'Booke', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'basically', 'got', 'dumber', 'too', 'series', 'progressed', 'No', 'longer', 'intelligent', 'criminal', 'politican', 'just', 'idiot', 'Rosco', 'side', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'Enos', 'Luke', 'Bo', 'return', 'end', 'Season', '5', 'storylines', '6', 'still', 'far', 'short', 'Storylines', 'good', 'script', 'writing', 'very', 'difficult', 'do', 'Think', 'series', 'whopping', '140+', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'writers', 'totally', 'simply', 'good', 'stuff', 'was', 'used', 'up', ""'ll"", 'see', 'really', 'coming', 'abrupt', 'end', 'season', '6', 'when', 'watch', 'episode', 'little', 'green', 'men', 'Mars', 'coming', 'down', 'Hazzard.However', 'fans', 'series', 'should', 'probably', 'own', 'episode', 'Even', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'collection', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'always', 'find', 'going', 'back', 'Season', '1', 'where', 'got', 'started', 'first', '7', 'episodes', 'are', '7', 'hours', 'pure', 'fresh', 'fun', 'Hazzard', 'defintely', 'how', 'show', 'became', 'so', 'darn', 'popular']",The Dukes of Hazzard: Season 6
974092,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000EMG90O,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[2, 2]","As a kid, Dukes of Hazzard was my favorite show and through the years I have enjoyed watching reruns, but nothing beats owning the DVD sets and watching the episodes back-to-back. It brings back great memories.In the previous season (season five) actors Tom Wopat (Luke) and John Schneider (Bo) walked out in a contract dispute, missing most of the season and leaving the show scrambling for replacements. The boys returned at the end of season five and in season six, the Hazzard County action takes off again.Cousins Bo and Luke live with their other cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach, in the shorts that made her famous) on the farm that belongs to their Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle) in rural Hazzard County, Georgia. They are good folks, but the they have a way of getting under the skin of the thing that passes for the law in Hazzard County. Sheriff Rosco Coltrane (James Best) and County Commissioner J.D. ""Boss"" Hogg (Sorrell Booke) are about as crooked as anyone can get and they like to pin their various wrongdoings on the Duke family. Along with friend Cooter Davenport (Ben Jones), it is  usually up to the Dukes to take matters in their own hands to get to the bottom of things.In season six we see a lot of new story lines that reveal new sides to the characters. We get to see a soft side of Boss Hogg when his darling wife Lulu (guest star Peggy Rea) is kidnapped and held for ransom. It's funny to see Boss and Rosco dress in drag to try and catch jewel thieves who are after Lulu and Daisy. Bo and Luke help out an orphan boy by getting him a dog, only to find that the dog was kidnapped and has a reward for his return, which everyone knows Boss Hogg will want. The Dukes also take over a rag-tag basketball team and help build it into a winner with the help of a young boy who recently lost his father. Luke's ex-girlfriend, an up and coming country singer returns to Hazzard and the Dukes have to help her escape her manager, who is trying to cash in her life insurance policy. The Duke family also helped Cooter connect with his long-lost daughter when she shows up in Hazzard. All told, it was a busy year for the Duke boys.Perhaps the highlight episode of the season was the two-part episode where Bo and Luke went undercover on the NASCAR circuit to help bust a crime ring that spread all across the country. This episode showed a lot of family dynamic within the Duke family and also got to show some good racing scenes as well.Another highlight is the episode where deputy Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer), the only honest law man in Hazzard, is being chased by a fugitive he helped put in jail while he was in California. This was a great episode for Enos' character, who had failed in spin-off land a few years earlier.The extras on the set include a tour of the original set for Hazzard, Covington, Georgia, with Ben Jones and Sonny Shroyer. This is interesting, as you get to see many of the places that were used in the very beginning of the show and were still shown in the opening credits, over possibly one of the best theme songs ever, Walon Jennings' Good Ole' Boys. There is also a feature on the most famous cast member of the Dukes of Hazzard, Bo and Luke's orange 1969 Dodge Charger, The General Lee.All told this was a nice season, a great change from the tough season five. This was also the penultimate season for the Dukes. I am sure I will enjoy the final season as well, though as a kid, I remember crying when the Dukes went off the air.",4,"Possum on a gumbush, it's almost the last season!",1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,3473,"['kid', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'was', 'favorite', 'show', 'years', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'reruns', 'nothing', 'beats', 'owning', 'DVD', 'sets', 'watching', 'episodes', 'back-to-back', 'back', 'great', 'memories.In', 'previous', 'season', 'season', 'five', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Wopat', 'Luke', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Bo', 'walked', 'out', 'contract', 'dispute', 'missing', 'most', 'season', 'leaving', 'show', 'scrambling', 'replacements', 'boys', 'returned', 'end', 'season', 'five', 'season', 'six', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'action', 'off', 'again.Cousins', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'live', 'other', 'cousin', 'Daisy', 'Catherine', 'Bach', 'shorts', 'made', 'famous', 'farm', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'rural', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'Georgia', 'are', 'good', 'folks', 'have', 'way', 'getting', 'skin', 'thing', 'law', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'Sheriff', 'Rosco', 'Coltrane', 'James', 'Best', 'County', 'Commissioner', 'J.D', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'Sorrell', 'Booke', 'are', 'as', 'crooked', 'anyone', 'can', 'get', 'like', 'pin', 'various', 'wrongdoings', 'Duke', 'family', 'friend', 'Cooter', 'Davenport', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'usually', 'up', 'Dukes', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'get', 'bottom', 'things.In', 'season', 'six', 'see', 'lot', 'new', 'story', 'lines', 'reveal', 'new', 'sides', 'characters', 'get', 'see', 'soft', 'side', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'when', 'darling', 'wife', 'Lulu', 'guest', 'star', 'Peggy', 'Rea', 'kidnapped', 'held', 'ransom', 'funny', 'see', 'Boss', 'Rosco', 'dress', 'drag', 'try', 'catch', 'jewel', 'thieves', 'who', 'are', 'Lulu', 'Daisy', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'help', 'out', 'orphan', 'boy', 'getting', 'dog', 'only', 'find', 'dog', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'reward', 'return', 'everyone', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'will', 'want', 'Dukes', 'also', 'take', 'over', 'rag-tag', 'basketball', 'team', 'help', 'build', 'winner', 'help', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'father', 'Luke', 'ex-girlfriend', 'up', 'coming', 'country', 'singer', 'returns', 'Hazzard', 'Dukes', 'have', 'help', 'escape', 'manager', 'who', 'trying', 'cash', 'life', 'insurance', 'policy', 'Duke', 'family', 'also', 'helped', 'Cooter', 'connect', 'long-lost', 'daughter', 'when', 'up', 'Hazzard', 'told', 'was', 'busy', 'year', 'Duke', 'highlight', 'episode', 'season', 'was', 'two-part', 'episode', 'where', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'went', 'undercover', 'NASCAR', 'circuit', 'help', 'bust', 'crime', 'ring', 'spread', 'country', 'episode', 'showed', 'lot', 'family', 'dynamic', 'Duke', 'family', 'also', 'got', 'show', 'good', 'racing', 'scenes', 'well.Another', 'highlight', 'episode', 'where', 'deputy', 'Enos', 'Strate', 'Sonny', 'Shroyer', 'only', 'honest', 'law', 'man', 'Hazzard', 'being', 'chased', 'fugitive', 'helped', 'put', 'jail', 'was', 'California', 'was', 'great', 'episode', 'Enos', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'failed', 'spin-off', 'land', 'few', 'years', 'earlier.The', 'extras', 'set', 'include', 'tour', 'original', 'set', 'Hazzard', 'Covington', 'Georgia', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'Sonny', 'Shroyer', 'interesting', 'get', 'see', 'many', 'places', 'were', 'used', 'very', 'beginning', 'show', 'were', 'still', 'shown', 'opening', 'credits', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'theme', 'songs', 'ever', 'Walon', 'Jennings', 'Good', 'Ole', 'Boys', 'also', 'feature', 'most', 'famous', 'cast', 'member', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'orange', '1969', 'Dodge', 'Charger', 'General', 'Lee.All', 'told', 'was', 'nice', 'season', 'great', 'change', 'tough', 'season', 'five', 'was', 'also', 'penultimate', 'season', 'Dukes', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'final', 'season', 'well', 'though', 'kid', 'remember', 'crying', 'when', 'Dukes', 'went', 'air']",The Dukes of Hazzard: Season 6

But for some shows they either stand the test of time, or they don't. This sadly was one that doesn't really stand the test of time. It comes off as kind of cheesy now, but what they lack in that sense, they definitely make up for in laughs, and in good family fun. There's not many shows today that the whole family can watch. What ever happened to good family shows like Step By Step, Full House, Family Matters, etc? I wish they would come out with more shows that the whole family can watch.However, I've recently started getting my daughter into this show, and in that sense it is timeless. I have the first 6 seasons, and thus far, this one is the best of the 6. I plan on getting Season 7 whenever I can, but out of the 6, this one hands down is the best storywise. The humour is still there, but they added a more serious element to the show, and kind of washed away the CHEESE factor of previous seasons. What immediately comes to mind is episodes like LuLu is Gone Away, where LuLu gets kidnapped, and it really adds some suspense to the show. I remember one of the best things about the show, wasn't the cheesiness, but the suspenseful episodes, and you would be on the edge of your seat wondering if the Dukes would save the day.So if you want a more serious dukes season, this is the season for you. It still has all the car chases, as well as the Boss and Rosco goofiness.The only thing they added is better writing to the episodes themselves. They really create a good conflict in the plot, and make you really want to see the Dukes come out on top, rather than just knowing they will, and not caring.So I can say without a doubt, this is by far the best season of Dukes yet.I give this one a 5 star rating.",5,Best Season Of Dukes!,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,1810,"['used', 'be', 'obsessed', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'lot', 'ways', 'still', 'am', 'shows', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'sadly', 'was', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'off', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'now', 'what', 'lack', 'sense', 'definitely', 'make', 'up', 'laughs', 'good', 'family', 'fun', 'not', 'many', 'shows', 'today', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'What', 'ever', 'happened', 'good', 'family', 'shows', 'Step', 'Step', 'Full', 'House', 'Family', 'Matters', 'etc', 'wish', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'more', 'shows', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch.However', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'started', 'getting', 'daughter', 'show', 'sense', 'timeless', 'have', 'first', '6', 'seasons', 'thus', 'far', 'one', 'best', '6', 'plan', 'getting', 'Season', '7', 'whenever', 'can', '6', 'one', 'down', 'best', 'storywise', 'humour', 'still', 'there', 'added', 'more', 'serious', 'element', 'show', 'kind', 'washed', 'away', 'CHEESE', 'factor', 'previous', 'seasons', 'What', 'immediately', 'mind', 'episodes', 'LuLu', 'Gone', 'Away', 'where', 'LuLu', 'kidnapped', 'really', 'suspense', 'show', 'remember', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'cheesiness', 'suspenseful', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'edge', 'seat', 'wondering', 'Dukes', 'would', 'save', 'day.So', 'want', 'more', 'serious', 'dukes', 'season', 'season', 'still', 'car', 'chases', 'as', 'well', 'Boss', 'Rosco', 'goofiness.The', 'only', 'thing', 'added', 'better', 'writing', 'episodes', 'really', 'create', 'good', 'conflict', 'plot', 'make', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Dukes', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'rather', 'just', 'knowing', 'will', 'not', 'caring.So', 'can', 'say', 'doubt', 'far', 'best', 'season', 'Dukes', 'yet.I', 'give', 'one', '5', 'star', 'rating']",The Dukes of Hazzard: Season 6

974107,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000EMG90O,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 2]","This 1983-84 Season of the DUKES OF HAZZARD was the first full season with Bo and Luke, since Bo & Luke returned in the 2nd half of the Dukes 5th Season when the ratings toppled and the new Dukes Coy & Vance Duke(Byron Cherry, Chris Mayer)were ousted from the show along with the fact that the Dukes 6th Season was also Deputy Enos's(Sonny Shroyer) second season back on this show as well as the first full season without Deputy Cletus Hogg(Rick Hurst), since Cletus's departure in the 1982-83 Season.This was also the season when the DUKES OF HAZZARD was able to just start getting back on track more since KNIGHT RIDER was no longer interferring with the Dukes time slot on CBS every Friday night, since KNIGHT RIDER wasn't on NBC's Friday night line-up anymore during the Dukes Sixth Season since NBC had moved KNIGHT RIDER to Sunday nights in August of 1983 which helped save the show along with Coy & Vance's departure in the Spring of 1983, but on the other hand the ratings on this show were never as strong or as outstanding as they were in the DUKES OF HAZZARD's first 4 seasons since it was already going kind of stale since KNIGHT RIDER had already stole the Dukes thunder wiping everything out in the Nielsen ratings.Therefore even though the Dukes were already losing their touch, more people were able to enjoy both the DUKES OF HAZZARD and KNIGHT RIDER on the same weekends, since KNIGHT RIDER was moved to NBC's Sunday night line-up during KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season while the DUKES OF HAZZARD was still on CBS's Friday night line-up during the DUKES OF HAZZARD'S 6th Season, which gave people the opportunity to enjoy the General Lee on Friday nights and KITT on Sundays, which helped people pay attention to the General Lee again, since KNIGHT RIDER was no longer the hottest car on Friday nights anymore during KNIGHT RIDER's Second Season, since KNIGHT RIDER was on it's Second Season on CBS's rival network NBC at the same time the DUKES OF HAZZARD was in it's Sixth Season on NBC's rival network CBS.Therefore, you could say that the General Lee got to become the hottest car on Friday nights again, since that made KITT the hottest car on Sundays instead even though the DUKES OF HAZZARD was still getting kind of weak in the ratings since the Dukes were still continuing to lose their edge through newer more popular TV shows like KNIGHT RIDER since the DUKES OF HAZZARD was still especially losing a lot of viewers through KNIGHT RIDER and the Dukes were already way passed their honeymoon phase of the show while KNIGHT RIDER was still in its honeymoon phase of the show, especially since KITT had outclassed the General along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER had K.O.'d the DUKES OF HAZZARD with the ratings since KITT was able to do 10 times as much of what the General Lee could ever do.Therefore you could say that that in this season that Bo, Luke, and the General Lee were all creaking while Michael(David Hasselhoff) & KITT were still peaking since KNIGHT RIDER was still skyrocketting in the ratings to an all-time high, but I'm sure CBS more than likely would've ended up cancelling the DUKES OF HAZZARD by the Summer of 1984 if NBC would've ended up moving KNIGHT RIDER to 8PM on Fridays instead of Sundays, since it would've interferred with THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's 8PM time slot on CBS, especially since KNIGHT RIDER's debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 nearly led CBS to cancel the DUKES OF HAZZARD in 1983, especially before Bo and Luke returned to the show.Unfortunately the General Lee was already getting kind of sluggish, the Dukes were obviously getting tired and this show was running out of steam in the last 2 seasons of this show and finally cancelled in the 7th Season in February of 1985 after the Dukes 1979-85 run on CBS cutting the Dukes last season short after completing 6 full successful previous seasons, but the Dukes just couldn't get their thunder back in the last 3 seasons after KNIGHT RIDER's premiere on NBC back in September of 1982 when KNIGHT RIDER was just starting its honeymoon phase when KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on Sunday September 26th, 1982 which was also on the same night that MATT HOUSTON made its debut on ABC.It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1983-1984 Season like*Stepfanie Kramer in the ""Undercover Dukes"" episode before her co-starring days as the brassy street-savvy homicide detective Sgt. Rick Hunter's partner(Sgt. D.D. McCall) on HUNTER*Roberta Leighton after her co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS in the ""Play It Again Luke"" episode*Lydia Cornell in the ""Undercover Dukes"" episode during her co-starring days on TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT*Shanna Reed in the ""Lulu's Gone Away"" episode before her co-starring days on MAJOR DAD*Jeff Osterhage in the ""Play It Again Luke"" episode before his days as LAPD detective Sgt. Vic Daniels in THE NEWDRAGNET watching Jeffrey Osterhage(Eddie Lee) getting beat up by Luke in the ""Play It Again, Luke"" episode*Richard Moll before his days as baliff(Bull Shannon) on NIGHT COURT*Hal Williams in the ""Cooters Confession"" episode before his co-starring days on the sitcom 227 and after his co-starring days on PRIVATE BENJAMINThe only thing that really sucked about this DVD and the Dukes 7th Season DVD was it didn't have Closed Captioning in English provided by the DVD in DVD mode, but only provided Closed Captioning in TV mode, unlike Warner Bros. did with the first 5 Seasons of The Dukes Of Hazzard DVD's.Therefore, it seemed like Warner Bros. got kinda lazy all of the sudden by no longer providing subtitles for DVD mode anymore, which really sucked along with the fact that Universal has always provided Closed Captioning in English for all their DVD's, including every single season of THE ROCKFORD FILES, MIAMI VICE, KNIGHT RIDER, MAGNUM, THE A-TEAM, AIRWOLF, etc., but perhaps that may be due to the fact that Universal is a bigger and better movie corporation than Warner Bros. ever was.However, since Warner Bros. had provided Closed Captioning in English in both DVD mode and Television mode, I had expected Warner Bros. to provide English subtitles in DVD mode on this DVD and the following Dukes season DVD, but was disappointed when I discovered that Warner Bros. didn't provide English Closed Captioning in DVD mode on the Dukes 6th and 7th Season DVD's, but I do know for a fact that if THE DUKES OF HAZZARD had been a Universal distribution instead of a Warner Bros. distribution, Universal would've more than likely provided Closed Captioning in English for every single DUKES OF HAZZARD season DVD box set, just like Universal did for all 4 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER, all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I.; all 5 seasons of MIAMI VICE, all 5 seasons of THE A-TEAM; all of the first 3 seasons of AIRWOLF; all 6 seasons of THE ROCKFORD FILES; etc.I also noticed that in the ""Lulu's Gone Away"" episode towards the end that they had filmed the Duke boys at the ""Six Flags Magic Mountain"" amusement park in Valencia, since ""Magic Mountain"" is owned by Warner Bros., since THE DUKES OF HAZZARD was a Warner Bros. distribution, which is why they had to use ""Magic Mountain"" for a theme park setting instead of ""Universal Studios"" in Hollywood.This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to my childhood days of living in the Imperial Valley since I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time since I was an Imperial County resident throughout the Dukes whole 6-year run on CBS.",4,The Dukes Rule!,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,7445,"['1983-84', 'Season', 'DUKES', 'OF', 'HAZZARD', 'was', 'first',
