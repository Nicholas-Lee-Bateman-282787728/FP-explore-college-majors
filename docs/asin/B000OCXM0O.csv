1063148,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B000OCXM0O,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[6, 7]","This is the unedited version of the program shown on VH1 Classic. The only material omitted from the version aired on TV was a more in-depth discussion on ""Dinah Moe Hum,"" for obvious reasons, but it is the same program, nonetheless.It would be, one would expect, a track-by-track discussion of these two pivotal LPs in Zappa's career, and where there is some discussion of them, it is more a cast of characters telling the viewer what a cut-up Frank was. His wife Gail speaks briefly on his work habits and the burden of doing certain songs he didn't prefer doing over and over and over... while Moon Unit speaks briefly on being embarassed by a lot of his music's toilet humor. But Dweezil, it seems can never tire of talking about, or listening to, his late father's music. He really loved the man, without a doubt. Steve Vai talks about Frank's sensibilities as a composer and performer, Elliot Ingber, guitarist with the original Mothers Of Invention, talks about the music of his time in the band not just being another guitar jam band, and Warren Cucurullo just says what it was like to live in that world.As for the sessions themselves, several band members from the time give their own thoughts about what it was like making these records, but the final product is far from complete. A lot of the material isn't even mentioned, but as a saving grace, Ruth Underwood (phenomenal percussionist, by the way) uses her marimba to give a brief tutorial about chord structure, and Zappa's approach to it, as well as an impromptu performance of the percussion solo from Apostrophe's ""Father Oblivion."" She claims afterward to have made a mistake playing it, but it isn't apparent. It's an amazing thing to see, such a complicated line, done with what looks like very little effort, but that's the kind of talent Frank demanded from his musicians.But, apart from Dweezil toying with the sound board showing how the various arrangements in certain pieces change the piece when accentuated or deleted, there is very little in the way of the music itself. As I said earlier, it's just a bunch of people waxing about how much they liked playing Frank Zappa's music. I'm not sure why, but these interviews include Billy Bob Thornton's thoughts. While what he says is true and obviously heartfelt, I just can't figure why he's even in there. He wasn't on the record, nor was he in the band. Whatever, I just don't get it. At least Alice Cooper, also on this video, got his start because of Frank's efforts.But, for the real gems, go to ""Features,"" and look for his 1976 appearance on ""Saturday Night Live,"" when the show was worth something, to see him play ""I'm The Slime."" Also, watch the clip of ""Montana,"" from the show recorded for ""Roxy And Elsewhere."" It wasn't on the record for some reason, but it couldn't be for lack of good performance. Excellent band. But I got a little sad watching Dweezil's band playing ""Camarillo Brillo."" They played it well, but something seemed to be missing. Of course, Frank is missing, but it just felt like something was wrong. I can't really explain it, it was like something needed to happen. Whatever it was, they played it well, so maybe it's just me.The whole thing has some good stuff, it's just not essential.",3,A lot seems to be missing,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,3251,"['unedited', 'version', 'program', 'shown', 'VH1', 'Classic', 'only', 'material', 'omitted', 'version', 'aired', 'TV', 'was', 'more', 'in-depth', 'discussion', 'Dinah', 'Moe', 'Hum', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'same', 'program', 'nonetheless.It', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'track-by-track', 'discussion', 'two', 'pivotal', 'LPs', 'Zappa', 'career', 'where', 'discussion', 'more', 'cast', 'characters', 'telling', 'viewer', 'what', 'cut-up', 'Frank', 'was', 'wife', 'Gail', 'briefly', 'work', 'habits', 'burden', 'doing', 'certain', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'prefer', 'doing', 'Moon', 'Unit', 'briefly', 'being', 'embarassed', 'lot', 'music', 'toilet', 'humor', 'Dweezil', 'can', 'never', 'tire', 'talking', 'listening', 'late', 'father', 'music', 'really', 'loved', 'man', 'doubt', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'talks', 'Frank', 'sensibilities', 'composer', 'performer', 'Elliot', 'Ingber', 'guitarist', 'original', 'Mothers', 'Invention', 'music', 'time', 'band', 'not', 'just', 'being', 'guitar', 'jam', 'band', 'Warren', 'Cucurullo', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'world.As', 'sessions', 'several', 'band', 'members', 'time', 'give', 'own', 'thoughts', 'what', 'was', 'making', 'records', 'final', 'product', 'far', 'complete', 'lot', 'material', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'saving', 'grace', 'Ruth', 'Underwood', 'phenomenal', 'percussionist', 'way', 'marimba', 'give', 'brief', 'tutorial', 'chord', 'structure', 'Zappa', 'approach', 'as', 'well', 'impromptu', 'performance', 'percussion', 'solo', 'Apostrophe', 'Father', 'Oblivion', 'afterward', 'have', 'made', 'mistake', 'playing', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'amazing', 'thing', 'see', 'complicated', 'line', 'done', 'what', 'like', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'kind', 'talent', 'Frank', 'demanded', 'musicians.But', 'apart', 'Dweezil', 'toying', 'sound', 'board', 'showing', 'how', 'various', 'arrangements', 'certain', 'pieces', 'change', 'piece', 'when', 'accentuated', 'deleted', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'music', 'said', 'earlier', 'just', 'bunch', 'people', 'waxing', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'playing', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'music', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'interviews', 'include', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'thoughts', 'what', 'true', 'obviously', 'heartfelt', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'why', 'even', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'record', 'was', 'band', 'Whatever', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'least', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'also', 'video', 'got', 'start', 'Frank', 'efforts.But', 'real', 'gems', 'go', 'Features', 'look', '1976', 'appearance', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'worth', 'something', 'see', 'play', ""'m"", 'Slime', 'Also', 'watch', 'clip', 'Montana', 'show', 'recorded', 'Roxy', 'Elsewhere', 'was', ""n't"", 'record', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'lack', 'good', 'performance', 'Excellent', 'band', 'got', 'little', 'sad', 'watching', 'Dweezil', 'band', 'playing', 'Camarillo', 'Brillo', 'played', 'well', 'something', 'seemed', 'be', 'missing', 'course', 'Frank', 'missing', 'just', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'was', 'something', 'needed', 'happen', 'was', 'played', 'well', 'maybe', 'just', 'me.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'good', 'stuff', 'just', 'not', 'essential']",N/A

The documentary is fabulous, lots of studio footage, road movies, still photos.

But as a child, this wasbasically interesting background noise which myfather would sometimes try to get me and my brotherslisten to and we would look at each other quizzicallyand shrug our shoulders as if to say""I dunno WHAT they hear in this Zappa character!"" (-:Of course, by the time I began to play musical instrumentsand gain an adult ear and sensibility towards music ofall genres, Frank Zappa's music appealed to me on somany levels because of it's richness and complexityamazingly without pretense!He was a renegade, a self-contained true original,and had a knowledge and understanding of musicalcomposition, arrangement, sound textures, lyrical ideas,conceptual ideas, and instrumental and vocal voicings/phrasingsthat came just from the planet of ZAPPA and nowhere else! (-:It was very much like Hendrix's wide approach to guitar,but even more broad in it's scope!Anywayz, this DVD has plenty of behind the scenes footageof Zappa interviews, Zappa on various concert tours fromthis era (1973-74) with his astounding ensembleof  band members like George Duke, Steve Vai, and manyothers, and his forays into experimental visual mediawhich were still almost 20 yrs away!The music is broken down song by song and track by trackin the studio by his son Dweezil and the engineers whoworked on the sessions for these two albums, which havebecome Zappa's most commercially successful.You get to see and hear the intricate processes thatZappa used when he was recording. Many great ideas endedup on the cutting room floor, muted out in the track,or pulled down deep in the mix, because it clashed withwhat he envisioned for the final product.It's great to hear all the ideas that he tried outbefore deciding on what worked.Other interviews are with son Ahmed, daughter Moon,his wife Gail, and others who either worked with oradmired being in the presence of one of the mostoriginal and innovative musical minds of the 20th Century!I've watched this DVD probably 25 times to date and Inever get tired of it. You also see Zappa performing alotof the songs live from these two albums as well as songsfrom earlier albums.

It was 1974 and it took me a while to realize how amazing the rest of the record was, but Frank had his way with my brain from moment one, and I've been Zappafied ever since. It's interesting to hear the perspectives of those who were part of that killer line-up from '73 and '74, still my favorite period for live tapes of FZ, and while this isn't the best show in the Classic Album series, it's certainly well worth watching for any fan of Frank, or intelligent rock music in general.Ruth seems as fun as ever, as do Napoleon (he was the highlight of the Zappa Milks Zappa show I saw in 2007, before the Evil Queen declared him unfit) and Duke...which brings up my main gripe here: no mention of my absolute favorite Zappa tune, Uncle Remus! Say what?! One of Frank's best guitar solos, crisp and concise, and one of the best vocals and lyrics on any tune he ever wrote, and they ignore it completely. Sigh. Oh well, can't win 'em all.Most of the other tunes from ' and OS are covered, but this is mainly about FZ hisself, which is fair enough. They show us the much-coveted Roxy footage (but no Penguins, despite the footage's constant bondage), and the Non-Talent who decrees who is allowed to play Frank's music rears her ugly head from the Den of Decision to add very little to the proceedings. I can only imagine that she was kept on the payroll because she let Frank shag all the groupies he desired. Now she has her revenge on all of Frank's fans by making sure Ike and the boys can't play the music they helped make so special. Sigh.In any case, this is a treat for any Zappaphile, though I'd much rather hear more from Ruth or George or Brock or Little Stevie the Spanker than from the Z folks, who really don't add much of value except the keys to the vault.While nowhere near the sheer joy that is the '74 live footage from the Dub Room Special, this dvd does have some fine moments, and a few choice words from the man himself, so check it out.And sign some online petitions so that Ike and everyone who wants to can play Frank's music, just like Beethoven or any other composer's works can be played at will.

Watching Dweezil at the mixing board going through certain songs and explaining them was informative and enlightening. Watching ""Camarillo Brillo"" being performed by Dweezil and NAPOLEON MURPHY BROCK was astounding. What made it astounding was the energy and pure musicianship that Napoleon put into it. This guy is as good as he was 30 years ago.The interviews with GEORGE DUKE were the best on the disc. He came across as much of a fan as he was a member. You could tell he respected Zappa as well as everyone esle involved with these projects. Mr Duke is a true icon in his own rite. He came across so genuine that it leaves no doubt to the viewer just how important Zappa was and is to the world of music.My only regret to this film is that they should have played the entire ""Peaches En Regalia"" by STEVE VAI, Napoleon and Dweezil. That had a great sound to it. You get to watch about 30 seconds and then it is gone. Why not include that in the bonus's?All in all fantastic documentary.

Only a handful of songs from Overnite Sensation and Apostrophe are covered here, and only fleetingly in most cases. There are plenty of people interviewed, but it ranges from the half sentence blurbs of the shortest Alice Cooper interview ever done and the chuckling ""I don't really have anything to say about that"" style of George Duke to the episode stealing interviews with Ruth Underwood and Billy Bob Thornton. Steve Via and Dweezil are insightful and gracious, but few seem to know how to talk about this complicated guy. Though Moon Unit's basic comment that he was a ""musical monk...who liked groupies"" gives another angle, it reeks a bit of her personal issues more than something helpful to understanding the guy's music. When you've finished the Machine Head Classic Albums DVD, you feel you've learned something new about every song and the circumstance of the recording (hell, they even go further in depth with the Zappa origins of the Smoke On The Water story than most anything here). Never Mind The Bollocks Classic Album is chock full of info and depth. The Fleetwood Mac episode of this series goes so far, for so long it's overwhelming! But this one just doesn't feel complete. It's undoubtedly worth getting for the rare footage (including Halloween Zappa on SNL), but if you own these albums you'll get more about the songs from putting on your headphones than watching this. The ""Vaultmeister"" as he's introduced, seems to have just gotten the keys to the vault, as all he knows is the location of said album, and the history of the format it's recorded on. Both he and Dweezil seem genuinely surprised when they encounter an interesting bit on the master tapes, as if they'd never thought of sitting down and examining what was there. At least they could've done a dry run before the cameras got there, so they'd appear to know SOMETHING! There's plenty of talk about Tina, but she's not on here. At least Gail gets some camera time and knows how to use it. Maybe it's because Frank is so very different and dead, that they were unable to completely capture the essence of what these recording sessions were all about. But it seems like they didn't do enough research into the original studio, or engineer or enough of the musicians involved to give a concise statement about these truly Classic Albums.

1063160,A25JHXYK10F0A6,B000OCXM0O,"Thomas D. Ryan ""American Hit Network""","[33, 36]","Throughout his career, Frank Zappa thumbed his nose at commercialism. He never let the marketplace dictate his direction, and his instincts (and taste) almost always ran contrary to whatever was `popular'. In fact, if Frank liked what you were doing, it was a sure sign that you would suffer commercially; just ask Captain Beefheart, or Wild Man Fisher, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, or Alice Cooper in his early days. The name `Frank Zappa' may now be copyrighted and a household name, but few people really ever knew his music. His albums were tailored to appeal to those who were outside of society, so what went wrong with ""Apostrophe (`)"" and ""Over-Nite Sensation"" that allowed them to become hugely famous?For a short period of time in the early seventies, Frank Zappa and the counterculture experienced something akin to acceptance by the media. Perhaps this was due to the huge success of FM radio, or maybe it was the zeitgeist that enveloped the globe after the late-sixties meltdown of hippie culture. Either way, Zappa's music was at a creative peak, and the world was willing to pay attention. ""Apostrophe"" and ""Over-Nite Sensation"" followed one another within a year's time, and each of them featured pretty much the same line-up of musicians. They represent his most accessible work, and this `album documentary' tells the story of how they got made.If you are familiar with Frank Zappa's work, then I highly recommend this DVD. If you are not familiar with Zappa's work, buy each of these albums and then buy this DVD. The information contained herein is invaluable to any fan. I've seen many, many of these `album documentaries', but none come close to the authoritative entertainment of this package. The fun facts alone are outstanding. Did you know that Zappa rehearsed his band six hours a day, five days a week? Show me another band with that type of work ethic. Did you know that the backup vocals were by the Ikettes (with Tina Turner)? Did you know that Zappa has a library of recordings that could rival the Grateful Dead in its breadth?The editing between live performance (including a killer version of ""Montana"") and studio analysis is brilliant. Son Dweezil takes us deep into recording analysis, sitting at a mixing board and moving the faders while making insightful observations. The documentary is relatively short - only one hour - but there's another hour of extras that convey just as much information, while focusing on all aspects of Zappa's music, including its topicality, its technique, and its humor. Frank Zappa was a thoroughly unique character, incapable of being categorized or lumped into a box. If you know these albums, you may think you already understand how his mind worked. See this documentary and you'll understand why. In a word, it's astounding.A Tom Ryan",5,A Great Album Documentary,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,2809,"['career', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'thumbed', 'nose', 'commercialism', 'never', 'let', 'marketplace', 'dictate', 'direction', 'instincts', 'taste', 'almost', 'always', 'ran', 'contrary', 'was', 'popular', 'fact', 'Frank', 'liked', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'was', 'sure', 'sign', 'would', 'suffer', 'commercially', 'just', 'ask', 'Captain', 'Beefheart', 'Wild', 'Man', 'Fisher', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'early', 'days', 'name', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'may', 'now', 'be', 'copyrighted', 'household', 'name', 'few', 'people', 'really', 'ever', 'knew', 'music', 'albums', 'were', 'tailored', 'appeal', 'who', 'were', 'outside', 'society', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Apostrophe', 'Over-Nite', 'Sensation', 'allowed', 'become', 'hugely', 'famous', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'early', 'seventies', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'counterculture', 'experienced', 'something', 'akin', 'acceptance', 'media', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'huge', 'success', 'FM', 'radio', 'maybe', 'was', 'zeitgeist', 'enveloped', 'globe', 'late-sixties', 'meltdown', 'hippie', 'culture', 'way', 'Zappa', 'music', 'was', 'creative', 'peak', 'world', 'was', 'willing', 'pay', 'attention', 'Apostrophe', 'Over-Nite', 'Sensation', 'followed', 'one', 'year', 'time', 'featured', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'line-up', 'musicians', 'represent', 'most', 'accessible', 'work', 'album', 'documentary', 'story', 'how', 'got', 'made.If', 'are', 'familiar', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'work', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Zappa', 'work', 'buy', 'albums', 'then', 'buy', 'DVD', 'information', 'contained', 'herein', 'invaluable', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'album', 'documentaries', 'none', 'come', 'close', 'authoritative', 'entertainment', 'package', 'fun', 'facts', 'alone', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Did', 'know', 'Zappa', 'rehearsed', 'band', 'six', 'hours', 'day', 'five', 'days', 'week', 'Show', 'band', 'type', 'work', 'ethic', 'Did', 'know', 'backup', 'vocals', 'were', 'Ikettes', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Did', 'know', 'Zappa', 'library', 'recordings', 'could', 'rival', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'breadth', 'editing', 'live', 'performance', 'including', 'killer', 'version', 'Montana', 'studio', 'analysis', 'brilliant', 'Son', 'Dweezil', 'deep', 'recording', 'analysis', 'sitting', 'mixing', 'board', 'moving', 'faders', 'making', 'insightful', 'observations', 'documentary', 'relatively', 'short', 'only', 'one', 'hour', 'hour', 'extras', 'convey', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'focusing', 'aspects', 'Zappa', 'music', 'including', 'topicality', 'technique', 'humor', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'unique', 'character', 'incapable', 'being', 'categorized', 'lumped', 'box', 'know', 'albums', 'may', 'think', 'already', 'understand', 'how', 'mind', 'worked', 'See', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'word', 'astounding.A', 'Tom', 'Ryan']",N/A
