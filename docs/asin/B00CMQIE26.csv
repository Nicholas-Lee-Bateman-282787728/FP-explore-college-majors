In case you are not familiar with the show it is centered on two skydivers for hire, fresh from the military who set up business in it is believed to be Southern California.  The shows get rather samey after a while, but it will give you a chance to see Gunsmoke's Festus (Ken Curtis) before he went to Gunsmoke.  Also see a constantly snarling Burt Reynolds in one of his first TV appearances.

1648834,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,B00CMQIE26,Love Our Military Men,"[15, 15]","I remember well this series ""RIPCORD"" - a two season television show that starred Larry Pennell and Ken Curtis as ""Ted McKeever"" and ""Jim Buckley"" who operate an outfit called Ripcord Inc., a skydiving school, but also spend a lot of time rescuing people out of untoward circumstances, and other recovery efforts which occasionally included some crime-fighting. The series ran for a total of 76 episodes in black and white from 1961-1963 in a 30 minute time slot. Each episode aired approximately 25 minutes. The sport of freefall skydiving was in it's infancy at that time and this show really helped bring visibility and increased interest. I also remember the action figure doll (with parachute attached) that was sold that could be tossed into the air and 'usually' would float to the ground.One successful aspect of this show was the fact that in spite of it's 30 minute time slot, the scriptwriters were really able to build some meaningful character development and some measure of relationship in the short time allotted. This is very difficult to do for half hour episodes generally. A good  example of this is the episode (in this season) called ""The Final Jump"" where Tim Matheson plays a young boy ""David"" out on a camping trip with his friends who expose and make fun of the fact that his father is a gangster and a criminal and not the war hero he was led to believe. Because of the public shame and embarrassment, he runs away and subsequently sequesters himself with a rifle in a cabin (owned by his mother) at a location called ""Boulder Point"" threatening to shoot anyone who comes near. Ted and Jim volunteer to parachute in and help the young man. (Ken Curtis's character is outstanding in this episode in his dealings with boy.)If you'd like to take a trip back in time and revisit this obscure and almost forgotten series, season two had some great episodes as well as a nice roster of guest stars which included:Joanna Moore, Karl Swenson, Charles Bronson, Ted Knight, Harry Carey Jr., Paul Birch, Joan Granville, Al Ruscio, Joe Turkel, Lurene Tuttle, Paul Fix, Dick Sargent, Barbara Luna, Arthur Peterson, Lindon Chiles, Denver Pyle, Dawn Wells, and more!This will be released on July 23, 2013.",4,RIPCORD SEASON TWO  - ANOTHER OBSCURE TV SERIES GETTING A RELEASE TO DVD,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,2217,"['remember', 'well', 'series', 'RIPCORD', 'two', 'season', 'television', 'show', 'starred', 'Larry', 'Pennell', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'Ted', 'McKeever', 'Jim', 'Buckley', 'who', 'operate', 'outfit', 'called', 'Ripcord', 'Inc.', 'skydiving', 'school', 'also', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'rescuing', 'people', 'untoward', 'circumstances', 'other', 'recovery', 'efforts', 'occasionally', 'included', 'crime-fighting', 'series', 'ran', 'total', '76', 'episodes', 'black', 'white', '1961-1963', '30', 'minute', 'time', 'slot', 'episode', 'aired', 'approximately', '25', 'minutes', 'sport', 'freefall', 'skydiving', 'was', 'infancy', 'time', 'show', 'really', 'helped', 'bring', 'visibility', 'increased', 'interest', 'also', 'remember', 'action', 'figure', 'doll', 'parachute', 'attached', 'was', 'sold', 'could', 'be', 'tossed', 'air', ""'usually"", 'would', 'float', 'ground.One', 'successful', 'aspect', 'show', 'was', 'fact', 'spite', '30', 'minute', 'time', 'slot', 'scriptwriters', 'were', 'really', 'able', 'build', 'meaningful', 'character', 'development', 'measure', 'relationship', 'short', 'time', 'allotted', 'very', 'difficult', 'do', 'hour', 'generally', 'good', 'example', 'episode', 'season', 'called', 'Final', 'Jump', 'where', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'young', 'boy', 'David', 'out', 'camping', 'trip', 'friends', 'who', 'expose', 'make', 'fun', 'fact', 'father', 'gangster', 'criminal', 'not', 'war', 'hero', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'public', 'shame', 'embarrassment', 'away', 'subsequently', 'sequesters', 'rifle', 'cabin', 'owned', 'mother', 'location', 'called', 'Boulder', 'Point', 'threatening', 'shoot', 'anyone', 'who', 'near', 'Ted', 'Jim', 'volunteer', 'parachute', 'help', 'young', 'man', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'character', 'outstanding', 'episode', 'dealings', 'boy', ""'d"", 'like', 'take', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'revisit', 'obscure', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'series', 'season', 'two', 'had', 'great', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'roster', 'guest', 'stars', 'included', 'Joanna', 'Moore', 'Karl', 'Swenson', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'Paul', 'Birch', 'Joan', 'Granville', 'Al', 'Ruscio', 'Joe', 'Turkel', 'Lurene', 'Tuttle', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'Barbara', 'Luna', 'Arthur', 'Peterson', 'Lindon', 'Chiles', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'Dawn', 'Wells', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'July', '23', '2013']",Ripcord TV Series: Complete Season 2

1648838,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B00CMQIE26,Terry Sunday,"[7, 7]","Buyers of the ""Ripcord Complete Season 1"" DVD set will also want to pick up Season 2 of the exciting 1961-63 television series that featured the thrilling aerial adventures of skydivers-for-hire Ted McKeever (played by Larry Pennell) and Jim Buckley (played by Ken Curtiss, who gained fame as ""Festus"" on ""Gunsmoke"").The ""Ripcord Complete Season 2"" DVD set contains 38 episodes on five disks housed in two traditional DVD cases (three disks in one case, two in the other) which are packaged in a nice-but-superfluous cardboard box that features the same front-cover artwork as the individual cases. Unlike the first case of Season 1, in which all of the disks are mounted on a single spindle and from which they tend to fall off and rattle around inside, the Season 2 first case has individual hinged plastic ""pages"" to keep the disks separate. It's a much better packaging technique, with less likelihood of scratching the disks.Each episode runs about 23 minutes or so, in full-screen format, of course. I didn't see it mentioned in the Product Description, but the Season 2 episodes are in full color, as opposed to the black-and-white ones of Season 1. I actually prefer B&W; for old TV shows--early color shows are way too saturated and unnatural to my eye. Anyway, although I've just sampled a few of them to make sure the disks work in my DVD player, they're great fun to see again after so many years. They're definitely corny compared to modern (but not necessarily better) standards. The actors' performances are restrained but competent. Of course, the real stars of the show are the sensational skydiving stunts, which were filmed as they happened without tricks or special effects. As in Season 1, some of the plot twists are a little strained as the writers tried to convincingly feature skydiving as the way to resolve the most unlikely situations. The episodes are fairly sharp and crisp, given the characteristics of early television color processes, and seem a bit too contrasty, but they're definitely up to the standards of the time. The dialog in most cases is clear and comprehensible, a relative rarity these days.If you're a fan of the good old days of television, you can't go wrong with ""Ripcord.""
