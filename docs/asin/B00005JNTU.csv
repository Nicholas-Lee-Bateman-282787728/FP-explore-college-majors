It seems to me that there is something which I'm beginning to refer to as the ""Marvel Curse"" going on -- where the 'debut' motion picture feature of a ""Marvel Comics"" superhero/superteam is just the most poorly handled/executed rubbish only to be followed by a remarkably better sequel; whereas the ""curse"" operates in just the opposite fashion where it concerns the ""DC Comics"" line of movie adaptations, where the 'debut' films are nothing short of exceptional only to degrade into mindless mush down the chain of sequels.HOPEFULLY ""DC's"" worries will be over ""IF"" they can manage to keep the latest revamping of the ""BATMAN"" movie franchise (""BATMAN BEGINS"") from degenerating into the kind of juvenile puke that became of the '80s franchise.""Marvel,"" on the other hand, is consistantly batting a 1,000 -- and that's not good. That old ""curse"" continues to haunt them with this lame (mis)handling of ""The Fantastic Four.""Two words really sum up this movie: ""LOUD"" and ""UNINTERESTING.""No doubt, much of the blame for that can be laid at the feet of director Tim Story -- but to hold him solely accountable is really quite unfair. This whole film stinks from all areas... from the screenplay all the way to the weak & unconvincing special effects. But even with all these faults going for it, the main culprit, in my opinion, who was responsible for preventing this picture from becoming what it MIGHT have been was the ""Casting Director"" who placed these severely MISCAST ""actors"" in the main character roles.There was also little to no flavor of the original comic book source material present in this movie, which I'm quite certain gave many FF 'purists' near-upchuck episodes. (Maybe now you'll understand why so many of us get so upset over the mishandling of popular ""Asian Horror"" movies that ""Hollywood"" decides to [*ahem*] ""remake."")Being at the helm of ""Fantastic Four"" undoubtedly gave Tim Story a chance to earn a few needed ""experience"" points for his resume in the Action/Adventure category, but his unfamiliarity with the genre coupled with the almost useless material he was given to work with may have hurt his credibility just a little bit. Maybe if they can pass the ""writing/screenplay"" torch over to someone else and give Tim Story another crack at directing the sequel (since ""Marvel"" movie sequels are consistantly better than their originals), then maybe he can regain the little respect this dog of a movie caused him to lose.",2,"""FANTASTIC FLOP""",1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,2589,"['*Is', 'just', 'anyone', 'else', 'honestly', 'noticed', 'strange', 'pattern', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'adaptations', 'big', 'screen', 'something', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'refer', 'Marvel', 'Curse', 'going', 'where', ""'debut"", 'motion', 'picture', 'feature', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'superhero/superteam', 'just', 'most', 'poorly', 'handled/executed', 'rubbish', 'only', 'be', 'followed', 'remarkably', 'better', 'sequel', 'curse', 'just', 'opposite', 'fashion', 'where', 'DC', 'Comics', 'line', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'where', ""'debut"", 'films', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'exceptional', 'only', 'degrade', 'mindless', 'mush', 'down', 'chain', 'sequels.HOPEFULLY', 'DC', 'worries', 'will', 'be', 'IF', 'can', 'manage', 'keep', 'latest', 'revamping', 'BATMAN', 'movie', 'franchise', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'degenerating', 'kind', 'juvenile', 'puke', 'became', ""'80s"", 'franchise', 'Marvel', 'other', 'hand', 'consistantly', 'batting', '1,000', 'not', 'good', 'old', 'curse', 'haunt', 'lame', 'mis', 'handling', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Two', 'words', 'really', 'sum', 'up', 'movie', 'LOUD', 'UNINTERESTING', 'doubt', 'much', 'blame', 'can', 'be', 'laid', 'feet', 'director', 'Tim', 'Story', 'hold', 'solely', 'accountable', 'really', 'quite', 'unfair', 'whole', 'film', 'stinks', 'areas', 'screenplay', 'way', 'weak', 'unconvincing', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'faults', 'going', 'main', 'culprit', 'opinion', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'preventing', 'picture', 'becoming', 'what', 'MIGHT', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'Casting', 'Director', 'who', 'placed', 'severely', 'MISCAST', 'actors', 'main', 'character', 'roles.There', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'flavor', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'source', 'material', 'present', 'movie', ""'m"", 'quite', 'certain', 'gave', 'many', 'FF', ""'purists"", 'near-upchuck', 'episodes', 'Maybe', 'now', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'get', 'so', 'upset', 'mishandling', 'popular', 'Asian', 'Horror', 'movies', 'Hollywood', '[', '*ahem*', ']', 'remake', 'Being', 'helm', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'undoubtedly', 'gave', 'Tim', 'Story', 'chance', 'earn', 'few', 'needed', 'experience', 'points', 'resume', 'Action/Adventure', 'category', 'unfamiliarity', 'genre', 'coupled', 'almost', 'useless', 'material', 'was', 'given', 'work', 'may', 'have', 'hurt', 'credibility', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'Maybe', 'can', 'pass', 'writing/screenplay', 'torch', 'someone', 'else', 'give', 'Tim', 'Story', 'crack', 'directing', 'sequel', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'sequels', 'are', 'consistantly', 'better', 'originals', 'then', 'maybe', 'can', 'regain', 'little', 'respect', 'dog', 'movie', 'caused', 'lose']",Fantastic Four

I bought the movie, without having seen in in the theater (bad word-of-mouth, you know), and I enjoyed it.  But it wasn't anywhere near as good as other Marvel superhero films like the Spider-man or X-Men series.So what do you get with this new vesion?  Twenty extra minutes of footage edited back into the film.  And it's mostly minor stuff, but most of the scenes do help develop the characters further.  [Spoilers Ahead] An extended scene between Susan Storm and Victor Von Doom is among the best, as it helps to further define Victor's feelings of jealousy toward Reed Richards.  And for longtime fans, there's a subtle cameo from the FIFTH member of the Fantastic Four (from the somewhat lamentable 80's cartoon series).  And if you haven't already heard about the Wolverine gag...well, that one could have stayed on the cutting room floor.And for everyone complaining about buying another version of a film they already own, you'll be happy to know that the studio is getting it right the first time withGhost Rider - Extended Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition).",4,"You know, this movie NEEDS some additional scenes",1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,1161,"['might', 'be', 'minority', 'opinion', 'think', 'extended', 'cut', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'fine', 'idea', 'bought', 'movie', 'having', 'seen', 'theater', 'bad', 'word-of-mouth', 'know', 'enjoyed', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'films', 'Spider-man', 'X-Men', 'series.So', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'new', 'vesion', 'Twenty', 'extra', 'minutes', 'footage', 'edited', 'back', 'film', 'mostly', 'minor', 'stuff', 'most', 'scenes', 'do', 'help', 'develop', 'characters', 'further', '[', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', ']', 'extended', 'scene', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'best', 'further', 'define', 'Victor', 'feelings', 'jealousy', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'longtime', 'fans', 'subtle', 'cameo', 'FIFTH', 'member', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'somewhat', 'lamentable', '80', 'cartoon', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'heard', 'Wolverine', 'gag', 'well', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'stayed', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.And', 'everyone', 'complaining', 'buying', 'version', 'film', 'already', 'own', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'know', 'studio', 'getting', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'withGhost', 'Rider', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition']",Fantastic Four
635651,A1DGAYHCDXE7FU,B00005JNTU,AH-1Z,"[5, 7]","Doing a Superhero movie is always risky.  You've got to get the audience to suspend disbelief to an even greater extent than is normal for a move for the magic to work.  It's vital that the actors and director convey the vitality of the comic they're depicting, without crossing the line to silliness.  Most importantly, the characters have to get you to care about them and have to not act embarassed by the ""fantastic"" parts of the story.  It's OK for Christopher Reeve to acknowledge and smile at the audience at the end of the Superman movies, becuase it's Superman smiling at the audince, not the actor saying, ""I'm not really like this, we're all in on the joke"".  Look at the difference between the first two Batman movies (along with Batman Begins) and the awful pair directed by Joel Schumacher.  Spider-Man and X-Men worked because everyone involved took it seriously and said, ""Give us that these characters could exist, and we'll tell you a good story"".Fantastic Four doesn't work.  Yes, there has to be the obligatory origin and discovery of powers section, but this takes almost 75% of the movie.  The big climax showed little originality  except to get the science wrong, as everyone walked through their scenes.  Mostly the characters just sit around and emote and say, ""We've got to be careful until we figure this out"".  Ioan Gruffudd's depiction of Reed Richards can best be described  as wooden.  Jessica Alba is basically given nothing to do except look conflicted.  Chris Evans gives some animation to his role, especially during the comic moments when he's teasing the Thing, but his character is mostly superficial.  Only Michael Chiklis brings any depth to his role, and he's really the only one you believe or care about.  Julian McMahon does a creditable job as Victor von Doom, but the chracter has been rewritten into a standard villian straight from Central Casting.It was said by some that this movie didn't do that well because ""The Incredibles"" stole its thunder.  That's not true.

Ilike the Fantastic Four and grew up avidly reading their comics. This ""film"" is pure crap. The story of four astronauts and their nemesis who are blasted by cosmic rays in space and develope unique superpowers each does not transfer to film(at least the way this was done). This had to be directed at 10 to 13 year olds. First the acting. It is beyond horrendous. Julian McMahon's acting reminded me of sissy soap opera star. The makeup crew needs to be examined. Could they have made Reed Richards temple grey look any faker. Michael Chiklis, c'mon. Most of the Thing scenes were infantile. Chris Evans had Johnny Storms personality pretty good, but they went way overboard with it. Jessica Alba did what she could, and her powers turned out to be the most interesting to view.The storyline is not even worth commenting on, because their is none. I dont recall even hearing the name ""Doc Doom"" or Doctor Doom mentioned which was strongly used in the comics.

Richards is on the brink of bankruptcy, and has to return on bended knee and ask the now billionaire Doom for funding for a new space project, who gladly obliges for a more than healthy cut of any future profits.Chris Evans as Johnny Storm (aka Human Torch) and the very sexy Jessica Alba as Susan Storm go along for the ride, with anchor man Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm in tow. If you know the story (which this is fairly faithful too), the team all get exposed to a funky solar storm in space, and return to Earth unharmed, except that they all, in turn begin to develop side effects to the space debacle, in the form of weird and amazing powers. Richards, leads his team of four, and decides to utilize their new skills for the good of all mankind, whilst Von Doom sees the opportunity to run amok with World domination on his mind. So the story is set up, and all this said would be great, if you now didn't have about only 15 minutes of the picture left. All the characters are played well, Evans has some great injections of humor, and Chiklis does his best to battle with a fairly lame sideline story about the cost of his new powers, on his former life. There is good screen sizzle between Richards, and Susan but all in all the picture leaves too much wanting.As soon as the end credits rolled, I was ready for the sequel, having just felt like I'd been teased with a great story half done.

I was disappointed in the extended cut though. Most of the added scenes were OK. More character development, more story, a reference to the Puppet Master and that Herbie robot, but in the end, it felt as though they just Frankensteined this thing together from leftover parts. The scenes with Reed and Sue in the planetarium then again on the bridge being the exact same scene was the worst offender. And the part where Alicia gives Thing a spongebath just felt wrong on so many levels.

At first I thought it was gonna be a let down after seeing those pathetic excuses for X-Men movies. But after I saw the preview in which we see Johnny Storm ""flame on"" with the missile chasing him, I decided to see it afterall. I was definitly not let down and was releaved to see Marvel didn't choke again like they did with X-Men.(Spider-man was awesome!) This movie was sooo much fun and nothing was cheesy or lame. My only complaint was Dr. Doom was at first not very incriminating like he is in the comics. But he slowly got better towards the end. My sisters loved it too. And comments about the rip-off Incredibles being better are complete BS! I was bored with that movie and barely ever laughed. This movie: FF had me on the edge of my seat during the fight scenes and whenever they used their powers. The graphics I thought were good, maybe not the best out there but good enough that there shouldn't be complaints. The actors were well chosen(Jessica Alba not so much, but she did a pretty good job) and did wonderful. Anyways I highly recommend this movie, and it's the second best Marvel comic-based movie to come out so far(Spider-man is #1 of course). And I think it's pathetic that people say this movie is terrible and then recommend a piece of junk like X-Men, which is so butchered how can you even call it X-Men?

Fantastic Four is the latest in a saturated market, and it fails in almost every aspect except excellent special effects. The characters are cliche, as is the bad guy. The dialogue is repetitive (usually about either loving or hating their powers). The action is sparse and over way to quick, and the ending itself was cheap. And the ending is both predictable and clipped, with the super heroes coming together for one final blast of an attack to defeat their foe. Then, of course, there was the ""monster egg"" ending, that left you wanting more. Only in the case of this movie, it really didn't leave you wanting much. In fact, it solidified my personal want to quickly eject the DVD from my DVD player and return.I can't recommend this to any kind of movie lover.

Although this film did have its good aspects- great acting, Tim Story proving to be a very competent director, and the AMAZING special effects, It was the shallow story and lack of action in the movie. There were only 2 action sequences and only one of them involved Dr. Doom. Not only that, but the final battle with Doom was like only 2 minutes long.The plot start off with a financially troubled Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd)and his friend Ben Grimm(Mike Chicklis) visiting an old friend Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). Victor apparently has become very successful business man owning his own corporation. After some speculation, Victor decides he will fund Reeds new experiment. Apparently Reed plans are for a space expedition to study a cosmic storm, hoping it will teach them more about planetary life. His crew consists of himself, Ben, ex-girlfriend Susan Storm(Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny(Chris Evans) and Doom. However as they are up in space, something unexpected happens. Apparently the cosmic storm travelled faster than they anticipated. They all come into contact with the storm and had some very drastic results. That storm had somehow altered their DNA and given each of them different abilities. Reed can stretch far, Susan can become invisible, Johnny can turn into fire and Ben's body has become rock. As Reed tires hard to figure out a way to cure themselves, Ben must cope with the fact that he looks like a monster and Johnny becomes a show-off with his abilities. Soon, they all become celebrities known as the Fantastic Four, each of them with their own name- Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing. However, Doom too also gone through changes. HIs body is slowly transforming into a metallic compound and he can generate electricity through his body. At first he is hesitant about his changing, but soon he realizes that he can use this power for his own advantage. For his own evil doings. But he must first do one thing-take out the fantastic four.Basically I think this movie was headed in the right direction but ended up falling short. Usually superhero film deal with the heroes trying to stop the bad guy from fulfilling an evil plan or something like that. This film really did not follow that kind of story. Perhaps it was because Dr. Doom did not really BECOME ""Doom"" until near the end of the film. That made the story and the action lack. Now that Doom is fully developed, there will be more fighting in the sequel.However, I just watched an UNOFFICIAL FANTASTIC FOUR FILM made in 1994. Apparently the back story with this was that the movie company that had the rights to F4 but did not have much money and were eventually gonna lose the F4 rights. Other big money producers were gonna take interest into F4, all they had to do was wait for the studio to lose the rights. Before they could do that, the movie company decided to make a very cheap, low budget F4 film. Once they did that, no way was anybody going to produce an F4 film (atleast not for a while) since there was one already made. However, that film was never released in theaters or offically on video. I just watched that version on youtube.com, and I must say that has to be one of the biggest piece of trash I have seen. I know it was low budget but it was just terrible. Everything about it was bad-acting, script, lackluster character and ESPECIALLY the special fx. I would like to forget I ever saw that movie. Believe me when I say that if you do not like this film, go to youtube.com and watch the 1994 movie. I think you'll def appreciate this film after that.",3,"Not so fantastic, but a good way to pass some time",1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,3709,"['remember', 'seeing', 'theaters', 'back', 'summer', '2005', 'When', 'ended', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'so', 'fantastic', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'aspects-', 'great', 'acting', 'Tim', 'Story', 'proving', 'be', 'very', 'competent', 'director', 'AMAZING', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'shallow', 'story', 'lack', 'action', 'movie', 'were', 'only', '2', 'action', 'sequences', 'only', 'one', 'involved', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'Not', 'only', 'final', 'battle', 'Doom', 'was', 'only', '2', 'minutes', 'long.The', 'plot', 'start', 'off', 'financially', 'troubled', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'friend', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Mike', 'Chicklis', 'visiting', 'old', 'friend', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'Victor', 'apparently', 'become', 'very', 'successful', 'business', 'man', 'owning', 'own', 'corporation', 'speculation', 'Victor', 'will', 'fund', 'Reeds', 'new', 'experiment', 'Apparently', 'Reed', 'plans', 'are', 'space', 'expedition', 'study', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'hoping', 'will', 'teach', 'more', 'planetary', 'life', 'crew', 'Ben', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Doom', 'However', 'are', 'up', 'space', 'something', 'unexpected', 'happens', 'Apparently', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'travelled', 'faster', 'anticipated', 'come', 'contact', 'storm', 'had', 'very', 'drastic', 'results', 'storm', 'had', 'somehow', 'altered', 'DNA', 'given', 'different', 'abilities', 'Reed', 'can', 'stretch', 'far', 'Susan', 'can', 'become', 'invisible', 'Johnny', 'can', 'turn', 'fire', 'Ben', 'body', 'become', 'rock', 'Reed', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'cure', 'Ben', 'must', 'cope', 'fact', 'monster', 'Johnny', 'show-off', 'abilities', 'Soon', 'become', 'celebrities', 'known', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'own', 'name-', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Thing', 'However', 'Doom', 'too', 'also', 'gone', 'changes', 'HIs', 'body', 'slowly', 'transforming', 'metallic', 'compound', 'can', 'generate', 'electricity', 'body', 'first', 'hesitant', 'changing', 'soon', 'can', 'use', 'power', 'own', 'advantage', 'own', 'evil', 'doings', 'must', 'first', 'do', 'one', 'thing-take', 'fantastic', 'four.Basically', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'headed', 'right', 'direction', 'ended', 'up', 'falling', 'short', 'Usually', 'superhero', 'film', 'deal', 'heroes', 'trying', 'stop', 'bad', 'guy', 'fulfilling', 'evil', 'plan', 'something', 'film', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'kind', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'because', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'BECOME', 'Doom', 'end', 'film', 'made', 'story', 'action', 'lack', 'Now', 'Doom', 'fully', 'developed', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'fighting', 'sequel.However', 'just', 'watched', 'UNOFFICIAL', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'FILM', 'made', '1994', 'Apparently', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'movie', 'company', 'had', 'rights', 'F4', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'money', 'were', 'eventually', 'gon', 'lose', 'F4', 'rights', 'Other', 'big', 'money', 'producers', 'were', 'gon', 'na', 'take', 'interest', 'F4', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'wait', 'studio', 'lose', 'rights', 'could', 'do', 'movie', 'company', 'decided', 'make', 'very', 'cheap', 'low', 'budget', 'F4', 'film', 'did', 'way', 'was', 'anybody', 'going', 'produce', 'F4', 'film', 'not', 'while', 'was', 'one', 'already', 'made', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'theaters', 'offically', 'video', 'just', 'watched', 'version', 'youtube.com', 'must', 'say', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'piece', 'trash', 'have', 'seen', 'know', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'was', 'just', 'terrible', 'Everything', 'was', 'bad-acting', 'script', 'lackluster', 'character', 'ESPECIALLY', 'special', 'fx', 'would', 'like', 'forget', 'ever', 'saw', 'movie', 'Believe', 'when', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'film', 'go', 'youtube.com', 'watch', '1994', 'movie', 'think', ""'ll"", 'def', 'appreciate', 'film']",Fantastic Four
635672,AWQDIP5LPT8KT,B00005JNTU,Bat185,"[0, 1]","As summer movies go, Fantastic Four is your typical ""popcorn flick"".  This movie is not the excellent superhero movie it could have been. While I agree with Tim Story's decision to turn Fantastic Four into a ""family-oriented"" movie, I feel he missed the mark by appealing to the adult crowd with the adult humor.  Fantastic Four could have been a far better movie if it had been rated PG and geared strictly towards the younger crowd.  The actors, with a few exceptions (Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans), were miscast as well.The love triangle-between Reed, Sue, and Victor seemed forced and just out of place.  Sue Storm (played by Jessica Alba) was shown MANY times showcasing her body.  From running down the street stripping out of her clothes so she wouldn't be spotted when she turned invisible to Reed walking in on her in the bathroom as she wraps herself in a towel was gratuitous and an obvious attempt at just displaying Jessica's ""talents"".  While I enjoy Jessica as an actress, as well as a beautiful woman, she was completely wrong for the role of Sue Storm.  Johnny had always been Sue's YOUNGER brother while here they looked to be almost the same age.Ioan Gruffuld as Reed Richards was just plain HORRIBLE.  How did this guy ever get the role?  He can't act.  I can see why someone like Jessica Alba would dump him.  I would have much rather liked to see George Clooney (who I believe WAS considered) as Reed Richards.Julian McMahon, while a great actor, was just wrong for Dr. Doom.  Dr. Doom is supposed to be from the foreign country Latveria.  Here he was just as much an American as the rest of the cast.  Known for his roles on Charmed and Nip/Tuck, I feel he was brought in for the TV fanbase.  I think someone more like Clive Owen could have been a good Dr. Victor Von Doom.Next we come to my two favorite casting choices, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis.  Chris played the hot-headed, carefree, goofiness of Johnny to perfection.  I can't think of anyone else who I would have liked as Johnny Storm.  Same goes for Michael as Ben Grimm.  Just downright perfect casting.  I truly believed when I first saw him on screen that he would be The Thing.  Hearing ""It's clobberin' Time"" was so cool.In the end Fantastic Four, while not fantastic, is a guilty pleasure for some great scenes but overall the movie just wasn't up to par with some other wonderful Marvel movies.  I would only recommend this movie for the die-hard FF fan, but even then I would warn them not to be too impressed.

But other than that, I'm sorry, you can't get any better than what this movie did, showing them get hit by the cosmic rays in space, this rendition of Dr. Doom is the best I've seen period.

I've seen people who have said it's not faithful, how so, I guess they enjoyed the movie that came out in the 90's.

On the DVD, when you see Mr. Fantastic shove his hand under the door and stretch it up to the door latch, it looks kind of fake, but with these glasses it looked real! It was wonderful. The glasses enhance CGI effects, so all the special effects look better.Fantastic 4 is the best all-around superhero movie yet. They managed to translate the team from the comics to the movies without losing any of it's charm, yet still make it accessable to people who have never heard of them before.The relationships worked very well. Especially the way Johnny kept pulling pranks on Ben Grimm, the Thing. That made the whole movie worth watching right there. The dynamic between each pairing of the characters, be it old friends Ben and Reed, or brother and sister, Johnny and Sue, or clueless young lovers Reed and Sue were all portrayed beautifully, but without feeling at all forced.The special effects for the superpowers were Fantastic. Watching Johnny ""flame on"" for the first time was awesome (especially in 3-D) and his flying scenes were totally gorgeous, managing to bring in the reality of the movie media while also reminding us of the best of the comic book art (which can be very good, trust me.)The design of the costume for the Thing was inspired. You can really suspend your disbelief and enjoy this gruff, loud, ornery, yet soft hearted guy who just happens to be made out of stone. And Sue Storm is wonderfully snarky as she tries to handle both her new powers, and a brilliant but completely dense boyfriend.If you ever liked comic books then you have to see this movie. Even if you never see another superhero movie. Fantastic 4 manages to be the best of both worlds, without ever losing it's freshness and charm.And watch it in 3-D if you can.

It's kind of bad.The Fantastic Four was the first real superhero team when it came out as a comic over 40 years past.  Prior to this movie there were some attempts to put it to the big screen.  But the technology was not up to the task.Now the technology is up to the task and the poor script sinks it.  In the comics the FF were just as much a part of New York as Spiderman.  The Spiderman movies had him as a living part of New York.  However, the FF feels like they are a passing bunch of tourists who do some vandalism and move on.  The Fantastic Four are not really a part of the city.John Storm is passed as some sort of bad boy extreme skier and thrill junky.  Sue Storm is presented as a sex pot.  Reed Richards is the smart team leader.  Last, Ben Grimm, as the Thing, is the strong man of the team.The plot is this team flies into a space storm that is changed with cosmic rays and they turn into mutants.  (normal people merely get radiation sickness and die)  Victor Von Doom is on the space ship and he turns into some sort of robot guy, this reviewer was never quite able to figure out what he was.This Von Doom has the powers of Magneto from the movie X-men.  There is a final fight where the Fantastic Four fights Von Doom and the Fantastic Four wins.  Well, if Von Doom had won would the world be worse?  Would we have universal health insurance?  We don't know and after this movie we may only care that this movie endsThis movie feels like they took pieces from other hero movies and glued it together.  One part Spiderman, two parts X-men, some light science-fiction thrown in and -poof - you have the Fantastic Four.  Please give me $13.95 for this clone, thank you very much.X-men III comes out in May of 2006 and you will see a real team in action.

Marold""","[1, 2]","`Fantastic Four', `Daredevil', and `Spiderman' make a very interesting trio of superhero movies, especially as they are, all three of them, based on a Marvel Comics character. To my mind, they exemplify the three levels of quality of `watchable' superhero movies, as opposed to those that are derivative and lacking any spark of imagination.Although many have rated it fairly well, I would put the newest, `Fantastic Four' at the bottom of the list, along with `Hellboy', which I happened to like, but which shares with `Fantastic Four' some serious difficulties to our suspending disbelief. These movies are simply made for fun. You can almost sense the tongue in cheek attitude of the writer and director, let alone the actors. The situation which creates the superpowers is simply too improbable to accept. How is it that a single physical phenomenon would have five totally different effects on five normal, healthy humans? I know just enough about genetics to know how this may be explained, but the film narrative touches on none of this. We are just meant to swallow this story whole. In contrast, the transformation of Matt Murdock is totally plausible. Enhanced senses following loosing one sense are very real. They just posited a bit more than normal ability in that direction. The genesis of Peter Parker's superpowers is a bit more sci fi, but totally believable, given the chance to believe a genetically enhanced spider species.`Daredevil' is probably the least popular of these three movies, and the first time I watched it, it didn't do much for me. On second watching, especially with the extras on the DVD, I appreciated that the moviemakers really accomplished something here. The premise behind both hero and villains is totally plausible and the director, special effects crew, and actors increase this verisimilitude by using very few CGI effects and stunt doubles. Most of what you see on the screen is really Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Colin Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics. The filmmakers also enhance the picture by doing a lot of the key scenes at night. This is totally logical, as the sightless Daredevil would have the advantage when his sighted rivals would be almost as visually handicapped as he is. `Daredevil' also has the added value of at least three very human relationships. Along with some of the `Batman' and `Superman' flicks, this holds the penultimate spot in superhero quality films.`Spiderman' is easily on the top tier of superhero movies, based not only on the believability of the premise and the humanity of the actors, but also on the relatively effortless special effects, lightly applied to great effect. I also think the actors contribute much to the quality of this film, where with Toby McGuire, there seems to have been just a bit of casting against type, the way Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in the first Tim Burton `Batman'. While I never read `DareDevil' or `Hellboy' comic books, I am familiar with the original `Fantastic Four' and `Spiderman' comics, so I think the relative merit of the films has a lot to do with the relative merit of the comics, since `Spiderman' is the traditional champion among strong comic book fans. I should add a plug for performances by Michael Chiklis in `Fantastic Four' for his comic relief and by Ben Affleck in `DareDevil' for taking the role so seriously, possibly through the influence of his good buddy, Kevin Smith, who appears in a cameo role as the medical examiner.",3,"Great Fun, but only in third place among its peers.",1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,3540,"['Fantastic', 'Four', 'Daredevil', 'Spiderman', 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'trio', 'superhero', 'movies', 'especially', 'are', 'three', 'based', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'character', 'mind', 'exemplify', 'three', 'levels', 'quality', 'watchable', 'superhero', 'movies', 'opposed', 'are', 'derivative', 'lacking', 'spark', 'imagination.Although', 'many', 'have', 'rated', 'fairly', 'well', 'would', 'put', 'newest', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'bottom', 'list', 'Hellboy', 'happened', 'like', 'shares', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'serious', 'difficulties', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'movies', 'are', 'simply', 'made', 'fun', 'can', 'almost', 'sense', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'attitude', 'writer', 'director', 'let', 'alone', 'actors', 'situation', 'superpowers', 'simply', 'too', 'improbable', 'accept', 'How', 'single', 'physical', 'phenomenon', 'would', 'have', 'five', 'totally', 'different', 'effects', 'five', 'normal', 'healthy', 'humans', 'know', 'just', 'enough', 'genetics', 'know', 'how', 'may', 'be', 'explained', 'film', 'narrative', 'touches', 'none', 'are', 'just', 'meant', 'swallow', 'story', 'whole', 'contrast', 'transformation', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'totally', 'plausible', 'Enhanced', 'senses', 'following', 'loosing', 'one', 'sense', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'just', 'posited', 'bit', 'more', 'normal', 'ability', 'direction', 'genesis', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'superpowers', 'bit', 'more', 'sci', 'fi', 'totally', 'believable', 'given', 'chance', 'believe', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'spider', 'species.', 'Daredevil', 'probably', 'least', 'popular', 'three', 'movies', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'second', 'watching', 'especially', 'extras', 'DVD', 'appreciated', 'moviemakers', 'really', 'accomplished', 'something', 'here', 'premise', 'hero', 'villains', 'totally', 'plausible', 'director', 'special', 'effects', 'crew', 'actors', 'increase', 'verisimilitude', 'using', 'very', 'few', 'CGI', 'effects', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'Most', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'really', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'enhanced', 'few', 'wires', 'accomplish', 'more', 'adventuresome', 'gymnastics', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'enhance', 'picture', 'doing', 'lot', 'key', 'scenes', 'night', 'totally', 'logical', 'sightless', 'Daredevil', 'would', 'have', 'advantage', 'when', 'sighted', 'rivals', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'visually', 'handicapped', 'Daredevil', 'also', 'added', 'value', 'least', 'three', 'very', 'human', 'relationships', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'flicks', 'penultimate', 'spot', 'superhero', 'quality', 'films.', 'Spiderman', 'easily', 'top', 'tier', 'superhero', 'movies', 'based', 'not', 'only', 'believability', 'premise', 'humanity', 'actors', 'also', 'relatively', 'effortless', 'special', 'effects', 'lightly', 'applied', 'great', 'effect', 'also', 'think', 'actors', 'contribute', 'much', 'quality', 'film', 'where', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'bit', 'casting', 'type', 'way', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'was', 'cast', 'Batman', 'first', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'never', 'read', 'DareDevil', 'Hellboy', 'comic', 'books', 'am', 'familiar', 'original', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Spiderman', 'comics', 'think', 'relative', 'merit', 'films', 'lot', 'do', 'relative', 'merit', 'comics', 'Spiderman', 'traditional', 'champion', 'strong', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'should', 'add', 'plug', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'comic', 'relief', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'DareDevil', 'taking', 'role', 'so', 'seriously', 'possibly', 'influence', 'good', 'buddy', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'who', 'cameo', 'role', 'medical', 'examiner']",Fantastic Four
635681,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JNTU,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 1]","There are serious SF films then there are entertaining SF films and, as of late, the film industry has seen fit to adapt several comic book SF characters onto the silver screen. Whether or not these are serious or entertaining is often left up to the viewer's discretion. Some have been great (Spiderman) and some not-so-great (Catwoman). Then we have this movie, the FANTASTIC FOUR.Debuting in 1961 (Marvel Comics), the Fantastic Four hit on new ground: a dysfunctional family of sorts who fight amongst themselves as much as they do against the forces of evil. Unable to decide on costumes, they really had none for several episodes. All of them gained their superpowers from exposure to cosmic rays while visiting a space-station.Jump to 2005 and we get the entire dysfunctional dynamic rolled into a 105 minute film; not an easy task. But director Tim Story does an admirable job with writers Mark Frost and Michael France's screenplay. The space-station, the problems with costumes, the infighting, it's all there (thus my postive rating).The beautiful Jessica Alba stars as the sexy, kick-a$$ Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Her powers include the ability to manipulate matter and light. Chris Evans (whom I'd personally give top billing) brings to life the role of  Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, Sue's immature younger brother who can spark up any room with his powers and his wit. And Mr. Evans instills some much needed comedy into the flick by playing pranks on the other three as well as having some great dialogue. Ioan Gruffudd bends the silver screen as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the flexible rubberman who is the defacto leader of the Fantastic Four (and who's also in love with Sue Storm).  Then we have Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who's increased mass and stone-like structure have given him incredible strength ...and some problems at home. He's uneffectually called The Thing and his wife leaves him posthaste when she discovers his altered physical structure.The great thing about the film is that it really looks at the issues surrounding being a newly developed superhero and how people might respond to such a thing. For one thing, when Ben Grimm's wife leaves him, she pulls off her wedding ring and Ben/The Thing tries to pick it up but can't because of his bulky hands. It's actually a fairly touching scene and we can feel Ben's frustration. Also there's the lost love between Sue Storm and Reed Richards which is always in the background and causes flare-ups and fights constantly. Then there's Johnny Storm's discovery of his flaming superpowers and his difficulty in controlling them (or lack of wanting to control them). He's a cocky upstart who brings an entirely new dynamic to the group ...which is why I'd give him top billing.The film's faults are easily seen as we're rushed through certain aspects (how they plan to get back to normal using a machine created by Richard) and several convenient plot twists (not uncommon, though, for comic books).This is a fun film. It's not at the level of Spiderman, but it's way, way above Catwoman.",4,Comic-Book-To-Film Goes Fantastic,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,3075,"['are', 'serious', 'SF', 'films', 'then', 'are', 'entertaining', 'SF', 'films', 'late', 'film', 'industry', 'seen', 'fit', 'adapt', 'several', 'comic', 'book', 'SF', 'characters', 'silver', 'screen', 'not', 'are', 'serious', 'entertaining', 'often', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'discretion', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Spiderman', 'not-so-great', 'Catwoman', 'Then', 'have', 'movie', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR.Debuting', '1961', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'hit', 'new', 'ground', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'sorts', 'who', 'fight', 'amongst', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'forces', 'evil', 'Unable', 'decide', 'costumes', 'really', 'had', 'none', 'several', 'episodes', 'gained', 'superpowers', 'exposure', 'cosmic', 'rays', 'visiting', 'space-station.Jump', '2005', 'get', 'entire', 'dysfunctional', 'dynamic', 'rolled', '105', 'minute', 'film', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'director', 'Tim', 'Story', 'admirable', 'job', 'writers', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'Michael', 'France', 'screenplay', 'space-station', 'problems', 'costumes', 'infighting', 'there', 'thus', 'postive', 'rating', 'beautiful', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'sexy', 'kick-a', 'Sue', 'Storm/The', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'powers', 'include', 'ability', 'manipulate', 'matter', 'light', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'whom', ""'d"", 'personally', 'give', 'top', 'billing', 'life', 'role', 'Johnny', 'Storm/The', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Sue', 'immature', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'can', 'spark', 'up', 'room', 'powers', 'wit', 'Mr.', 'Evans', 'much', 'needed', 'comedy', 'flick', 'playing', 'pranks', 'other', 'three', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'great', 'dialogue', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'silver', 'screen', 'Reed', 'Richards/Mr', 'Fantastic', 'flexible', 'rubberman', 'who', 'defacto', 'leader', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'who', 'also', 'love', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Then', 'have', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'who', 'increased', 'mass', 'stone-like', 'structure', 'have', 'given', 'incredible', 'strength', 'problems', 'home', 'uneffectually', 'called', 'Thing', 'wife', 'posthaste', 'when', 'altered', 'physical', 'structure.The', 'great', 'thing', 'film', 'really', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'being', 'newly', 'developed', 'superhero', 'how', 'people', 'might', 'respond', 'thing', 'one', 'thing', 'when', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'wife', 'wedding', 'ring', 'Ben/The', 'Thing', 'pick', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bulky', 'hands', 'actually', 'fairly', 'touching', 'scene', 'can', 'feel', 'Ben', 'frustration', 'Also', 'lost', 'love', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'always', 'background', 'flare-ups', 'fights', 'constantly', 'Then', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'discovery', 'flaming', 'superpowers', 'difficulty', 'controlling', 'lack', 'wanting', 'control', 'cocky', 'upstart', 'who', 'entirely', 'new', 'dynamic', 'group', 'why', ""'d"", 'give', 'top', 'billing.The', 'film', 'faults', 'are', 'easily', 'seen', ""'re"", 'rushed', 'certain', 'aspects', 'how', 'plan', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'using', 'machine', 'created', 'Richard', 'several', 'convenient', 'plot', 'twists', 'not', 'uncommon', 'though', 'comic', 'books', '.This', 'fun', 'film', 'not', 'level', 'Spiderman', 'way', 'way', 'Catwoman']",Fantastic Four

If I had watched it in the theatres, I would have walked out (which would have been a first).  And quite frankly, I'm surprised I watched the whole thing at home.  I think I was just hypnotized at how truly terrible this movie was.As an example of just how bad it was, I will summarize a particular moment that I just found completely absurd.  After just obtaining his ""super powers"" The Thing gets depressed (since now he looks like a rock, or would if the costume didn't make him look like an actor in a crappy costume) and The Thing decides to hide from his wife (who freaks out when she sees him, who wouldn't?) and stare at the ocean while sitting atop a large bridge.  Then, he sees a young man about to jump off the bridge to kill himself.  The Thing attempts to rescue him, a noble enough effort, but in so doing he destroys a semi, nearly killing the driver inside, destroys half the bridge and causes a massive traffic collision, endangering the lives of hundreds of people.  Everyone no doubt saw this, but yet when he ""saved"" this man, everyone claps, apparently forgetting that he nearly killed several people and endangered the lives of hundreds more, along with destroying half the bridge in the process.  Ridiculous.If that is not bad enough, when the ""Human Torch"" gains his ""super powers"" which literally sets himself on fire, he is not in the least bit frightened, or even surprised it seems.  He's in a hospital and a nurse takes his tempurature, which is over 200 degrees.  Her reaction?  She says ""wow, you're hot."" And his responce?  ""Yeah, so are you.""  Ha. Ha. Ha.  That is not a human response.  No one in this movie is human, and are all the result of insultingly lazy writing, terrible acting, and painfully corny dialogue that feels like it was written by a two year old.There was about five minutes of action that was pretty cool watching, but the rest of this movie was complete trash.  There were a lot of great movies in 2005.  Just look at the Oscar nominees.  I wholeheartedly guarentee ALL of them are better than The ""Fantastic"" Four.

I tried very hard to go in with an open mind.  I knew that they had changed things from the comic book and I was trying to accept this.  I wanted to accept the movie on its own terms.Without talking anymore about the changes from the comic book (which are grievous and plentiful,) I want to review it solely as a movie.  First, the characters are cardboard cutouts of real people.  They each have one, and only one, characteristic.  Reed is smart and this intelligence hampers his social interaction.  Sue is also apparently smart, though she doesn't have the wits to know she's dating the bad guy at the beginning of the movie.  She also does not display this intelligence in the movie in any capacity.  She only complains and strips.  That's it.  Johnny is a wild teenager.  At any and all costs he must be a wild teenager, no matter what happens in the movie.  Ben is strong and supposedly very loyal to his friends, though he inexplicably turns on Reed at one point in the movie for no reason.  Each of these bland characters has bland dialogue to match.There is very little action in the movie, except for the silly bridge scene and the end fight with Dr. Doom.  Now, with Doom, it is very difficult for me to separate this portrayal from the comics.  Dr. Doom is my favorite comic book character of all time.  The Doom in the movie is one of my least favorite movie characters of all time.  Everything about Doom they get wrong.  Everything.  Even loooking at it just in the movie, his character is silly.  Completely silly.The only reasons this movie gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that, at times, Johnny was almost good and also, at times, Ben was almost good and the effects weren't really that bad.  Everything else (like: characterization, dialogue, soundtrack, plot, most of the acting, directing, etc.) was just a waste of time.

The graphics were pretty good, but at times it looked too fake, such as when Mr. Fantastic catches the fireman and we have a view from below of him.  The storyline itself is decent, although a bit forced.  And the acting was merely okay.Some parts of the plot are of need of improvement as well.  For example, Mr. Fantastic says that he ran out of things to test the electrical storm on and would have to use himself.  Yet, the suits they were all wearing have the same molecular structure as whoever was wearing it at the time, so why not use them before sacrificing yourself?  Perhaps for dramatic effect, but stuff like this pokes holes in the plot and leaves more to be desired.I wouldn't recommend to run out and rent it over other movies, but if there is nothing else than give it a go.

635698,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JNTU,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[10, 16]","""Fantastic Four"" is a science fiction/fantasy flick based on the comic strip of the same name. When I first heard about this film last summer, I was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't heard anything about the Fantastic Four in more than twenty years and I assumed everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere had forgotten about this comic strip decades ago.I was never a huge fan of the Fantastic Four comics but I did read them on occasion so I have a good idea what the strip was all about. When I watched this movie, I immediately began to make comparisons between the comics and the film, looking for accuracies, similarities, and things to criticize. From what I saw in the movie, it is mostly an accurate duplication of the comic strip as far as the characters go and the general plot. You have the same basic ""superheroes"" and the same transformation problem/concern. Most of it matches the comic strip, with a few minor differences. This should satisfy those who were old fans of the comic strip since the movie seems to follow the same general path.I appreciate the director's attention to the comic strip's original premise, but there are several things about Fantastic Four that prevent it from being the entertaining movie it was meant to be. Chief among these is the flat story and even flatter characters. The story is pretty much lifeless and dull, with the Fantastic Four trying to find a way to reverse the effects of the cosmic rays so they can return to normal while Dr. Doom continues his increasingly evil plot. There isn't much more to it than that, and much of it moves along at a slow pace- far less exciting than some of the other comic strip inspired films of late, like Spiderman.With the characters, Ioan Gruffuth's is boring and forgettable. Jessica Alba seems miscast in this role, but it is easy to understand why she was chosen for the part (to give the film some sex appeal). Chris Evans' character is idiotic and continuously tosses out lame one- liners in an attempt to be funny. The only character that is memorable is that of Ben Grimm, who is played by actor Michael Chiklis. He plays ""The Thing""- the big, super- strong character with a body made of rocks. His character is the only one among the four with even a minimal amount of depth. He is also the only one who cannot transform himself back to his original human form (The others can turn their super power on and off) and he hates the predicament he is in. His bitter, grumpy attitude stands out among the four characters and he is the only one among them that will solicit any type of feeling from the viewer. His girlfriend Debbie- who is played by Laurie Holden- has dumped him all because of his gruesome appearance. A heartbroken Ben is naturally upset, but he does find comfort in another woman named Alicia- who is played by Kerrie Washington. She accepts Ben for what he is, making his life a little more tolerable.Chiklis' ""The Thing"" character is great for one other reason: The excellent make-up. The people in charge of this part of the film deserve praise for transforming this ordinary actor into a man with a body of stone. He seems just like the character from the comic strip and the attention to detail is amazing. If there is one reason to recommend this film, this would be it. The resemblance to the Thing from the comics is almost creepy.Another thing this film lacks is sufficient action. There are a few scenes where the Fantastic Four get to flex their muscles, but they are few and far between. For example, the Thing has a scene where he saves a man from getting killed by stopping a truck on a bridge with his bare hands. This is one of a handful of action scenes that are decently made and memorable. But they are not nearly enough, and most of the film drags along.Overall, this film will appeal most to those who were huge fans of the comic strip who will appreciate the fact that the director kept true to the majority of the comic's premise. Doom is different from the comic strip and other things are slightly different too.

It didn't work. The Fantastic Four starring all B list actors and a couple of C listers was a serious stinker.  I love comics, and the movies lately based on these comics (x-men, superman, batman begins, Spiderman) have been super-delish, unfortunately there is always a couple that try to latch onto the capes of the successful and wind up being an hour and a half long ode to clich&eacute;s and horrible acting. Poor Jessica Alba, with her Bratz doll look-alike face could not hold this movie up by herself, nor could her mediocre skills at trying to be a scientist. Mr. Fantastic? Who the heck is this guy, I looked him up on IMDB and he was Horatio Hornblower, could they not get someone else! He might have looked like the comic character, but to me he looked more like the lovechild of James Woods and Jeff Goldblum.  The others like Thing, and Torch guy, and Dr Nip and Tuck were so bland and one dimensional it seemed like during the whole film I was waiting for the cardboard cutouts to flipping leave and the real people actors to step in. The storyline, basically a soap opera with sparks. Tim Story who directed this has as far as I can see one major film under his belt ""Barbershop"", and he is slated to direct the next Fantastic Four movie, which has the foursome adding a fifth the Silver Surfer being played by Doug Adams who was the fish guy in Hell boy.

635704,A1N00127IDBHD6,B00005JNTU,CConn,"[5, 8]","Though, originally, I wasn't a terribly large fan of the Fantastic Four, as the film's release grew more eminent, I began to follow the production, and even became rather big fan of the characters themselves. So when the film was finally release, I not only had a fair knowledge of the film, and the characters that would inhabit it, I also had quite a high level of excitement for the film. My expectations however, were low. Since I followed the film, I pretty much already knew all of its strength, and all of its flaws. Sadly, upon viewing the film, I was proven correct in my assessment, and expectation.First let me start with the things, or aptly, the thing I didn't like about the movie; the direction. It is, to put it kindly, dreadful. Going into the production, I had mixed feelings out Story. While his former film, Taxi was quite horrible, Barbershop was an excellent film, and I had at least some hope that he could do something special with FF. And I suppose, he did do that, in regards to characterization (apparently the reason why Fox chose to hire him). But any accomplishments Story makes in that department are easily overshadowed by his disappointments in nearly every other area of direction. Despite a 100 million-plus dollar budget, the film looks downright cheap. ""Sitcom-like"" to quote several fans explanation of it. It's poorly shot as well, I found myself disappointed time and time again with Story's shot selection, pacing, and various other little particulars in many moments, and multiple scenes. Story just seems to fail overall in bringing the story to the screen. You could blame poor editing (and FF IS poorly edited), but it's more than just that; everything feels just a bit off, just a bit...wrong. And it's the director's job to fix that. I hate to pretend I'm some grade-school teacher and hand out a report card for Story's effort, but I can't help but say, if I were to grade it, Story would barely manage a D. Extremely disappointing.Now moving on to the things that weren't...quite so bad. The story for one. It's not the best in the world. You've got plenty of improbable happenings, corny dialogue, and rather loose plot, it still watchable and enjoyable. Our heroes, at least, are all done quite well, and act, pretty much, like they do in the comics. Brainiac Reed, Motherly Sue, Gentle Ben, and Jerk Off Johnny are all there (some more than others), and the tone and comradery between them is much like the comics. And that's really semblance of ""specialness"" comes from. The humor in the script is also done well, and would definitely be the bright spot for people whom are not familiar with the comic origins of the characters.That brings us to Doom. Much like the villains from the Burton Batman movies, Doom is yet another comic book movie character drastically altered from its source. Say what you will about that debatable practice, but I usually don't mind it, if its done well. In any case, instead of being a magic-welding foreign ruler, Doom, or Von Doom as he is called before his mutation to villain, is now the egotistical head of a multi-billion dollar company. I must admit, this style character is a real favorite of mine, but, sadly, its done poorly. Doom suffers both from a lack of screen time, and a lacking of understanding of the character. Doom is never really fleshed out. We never really know why he ticks. We never really seen his egotistical psychopathy. Thusly this declines the quality and meaning of Doom's ""evil plot"" and final showdown with the 4.I wouldn't quite say, overall, the acting is good or great, but rather everyone embodies their character well, and brings them to life quite perfectly (if given the opportunity). Nothing is extremely memorable, Chris Even's portrayal as Johnny may leave quite an indentation, Michael Chiklis as The Thing is heartfelt, and Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon all make due with what they're given. Though this may not sound like a glowing endorsement of the cast, they deliver just about as much as I'd think possible, given their either none-existent, or highly television-based resumes.There's been several complaints, both from critic and fan alike, that the special effects in the film were disappointed. I honestly, didn't notice this at all. While FF certainly doesn't introduce anything revolutionary into film in terms of CGI, it's solid, and any fake-looking effect it might have is more derived from the nature of the characters and actions rather than the effects themselves. It's harder than you think to make a guy with a 25 foot arm look real.The one last flaw of the film would have to be the extremely large amount of footage cut from the film. While this isn't apparent to people who didn't follow the production, the poor pacing the hack-kneed editing creates IS a apparent, and is damaging. I can only hope, like Daredevil before it, a Director's Cut of FF will be commissioned in the coming months.Overall, FF is hardly more than an ""okay"" movie, but's a fun ""okay"" movie, and that more than worth the hour and a half of your time. However, at the end of the day, I can't help but wonder just how enjoyable, just how fun this script would have been if it were placed in more capable hands. It may sound crazy, but I could almost imagine Spider-Man-level quality from this if Chris Colombus or some other talented family-oriented director was given the reigns.6/10",3,Not Fantastic...But Not

Someone said that, and that sums up the Fantastic Four pretty well. 2 + 2 = 4. Or does it?Fantastic Four was one of the original Marvel Comics, and it ran the longest. The film version stayed pretty true to the spirit of the original by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, but it was a pretty old fashioned story to begin with. Sure there were little updates here and there, topical references to Dr. Phil, Donald Trump, X-Games, Larry King---wait, Larry King was probably around before the Fantastic Four even began? Anyway, I think that they did a good job, and there were great special effects, but in this day and age, it just doesn't thrill us, because people have become much more cynical and jaded. But let's take a closer look:First of all, Jessica Alba is a major star. She hasn't been in that many films yet, but somehow she has just arrived on the scene, and you know that she was made to be a movie star. She also seems like she is a down-to-earth and likeable person. In this film, though, her super power as Sue Storm is that she turns invisible, and also has an invisible force field that she throws around. OK, now let's think for a moment. You have someone who looks like Jessica Alba, and she is invisible? That seems like a huge waste.-----------------------Susan Storm: [invisible] Look at me!Reed Richards: I can't.===================They play around a bit with having her take her clothes off, because her clothes aren't invisible, and then sometimes she can't control her power so well at first, so she reappears in embarassing situations.-----------------------Susan Storm: [stripping off her clothes while trying to escape the mob] I can't believe I'm doing this again!==================='Nuff said! Now we have her brother, Johnny Storm. He is kind of a show off, so his power of bursting into flames really suits him. Chris Evans made a great Johnny Storm. Check him out in The Losers, too. He really steals every scene he's in, both in The Losers and in Fantastic Four. Word on the street is that he is also going to be Captain America when that is made into a movie. Johnny and Ben Grimm have a real rapport going. Actually, they don't get along at all.-----------------------Ben Grimm: Hey, no more wise cracks about the way I look.Johnny Storm: Hey, call me Mr. Sensitivity.Johnny Storm: [walking through the crowd] Okay, wide load coming through! Everybody move! He's huge!Ben Grimm: Hey! Come here, Mr. Sensitive.Johnny Storm: Flame on!Ben Grimm: Show-off![Johnny flies into the sky to make a fiery 4]===================Johnny is a player, anxious to use his fame and flame to get women, money, and good times. He walks into a bar, walks up to a group of beautiful women, and says ""I need names... and shots. Bartender!"" Wish I could display that kind of bravado. Ben Grimm, on the other hand, feels like no one could ever love him, that he is a hideous monster. Ben Grimm is played by Michael Chiklis, and therein lies his problem: Chiklis = Chick Less. No wonder he's lonely. I guess that Michael Chiklis could really relate to the Ben Grimm character, and that is why he did such an outstanding job.-----------------------Susan Storm: We're all in this together, Ben.Ben Grimm: Together? Susie, look at me. You got no idea what I'd - what I'd give to be invisible.===================Against all odds he does hook up, though. Hey, if Bukowski could get women, there's hope for the rest of us. Even Benjamin Grimm. He encounters a black, blind woman in a bar, who is really beautiful. She is played by Kerry Washington.-----------------------Alicia Masters: You know, being different isn't always a bad thing.Ben Grimm: Trust me, this ain't one of them times.Alicia Masters: Not if you don't want it to be.===================They share a moment together, but you wish they would have delved into this relationship a little deeper. Where is this going? Does Alicia Masters appear in the sequel? Stay tuned, same Grimm time, same Grimm channel.-----------------------Ben Grimm: You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.Alicia Masters: Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.Ben Grimm: [sounding more hopeful than realistic] This ain't permanent. My friend Reed is working on a cure... I think.Alicia Masters: Bennie... you feel good 'as is'.===================Speaking of relationships, there is a kind of triangle between Reed Richards, Sue Storm, and Victor von Doom. Reed was with Sue, but they broke up.-----------------------Susan Storm: [to Reed] You're such a dork.===================Now Reed, the cerebral sort that he is, thinks that Sue is better off with her boss, the rich and powerful von Doom. She is waiting for Reed to react, to fight for her love, but while he is super intelligent when it comes to physics, he is a wash out with chemistry, namely, he can't see that he and Sue have lots of chemistry together. The actor who plays Reed is all right, but with a name like Ioan Gruffudd he has to be good. It's Welsh, by the way. Now Reed Richards can stretch and bend his body into any shape. You wonder when they are going to get to the question: Any body part? Would they go there? They go there.-----------------------X Games Reporter: [about Reed] Is it true what they say about him? That he can expand *any* part of his anatomy?===================Not only could he do that, he could also be his own prophylactic. Bada bing bada boom. In spite of his unlimited potential, he gallantly steps aside, until Victor comes out of the closet in full on Dr. Doom drag:-----------------------Victor Von Doom: Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts?Susan Storm: Victor, you *always* thought you were a god. Now back off.Victor Von Doom: Susan, let's not fight.Susan Storm: No, let's!===================Yes, let's! The Bottom Line is that Fantastic Four is more than adequate, but the story, even with the contemporary updates, is still pretty old fashioned. Jessica Alba is lovely, but we'd like to see more of her. But you can't, because she's invisible. Flame on. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis had a handle on their characters, and both of them really stood out. It's clobberin' time! Ioan Gruffudd and Julian McMahon held down the fort as Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom, respectively. The sultry and sensual Kerry Washington showed a lot of potential--let's hope she returns in the sequel. Great special effects. Pow! Bang! Ker-blooey! To recap: Better than Daredevil, but not as fantastic as either of the X-men movies.-----------------------X Games Reporter: [referring to Ben] What is that? What do you call that thing?Johnny Storm: That's it - the Thing. Yeah, you think this is bad, you should have seen him before!Ben Grimm: Okay.

635707,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00005JNTU,Chrijeff,"[0, 1]","I was never a fan of the FF comic, so I only know the basic facts about the team, and if I could enjoy this film, so can anyone else who isn't terribly familiar with them.  I found it far better than DaredevilDaredevil (Full Screen Edition), definitely equal to X-MenX-Men (Widescreen Edition), and almost as good as Spider-ManSpider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition).  Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist but a terrible businessman (and not too good at relationships either), and his lifelong friend and boyhood bodyguard Ben Grimm are in search of funding with which to prove Reed's hypothesis that a long-ago cosmic storm was responsible for the development of humanity.  To do this, they need to get into space, and NASA has refused them.  But billionaire Victor Von Doom, who has his own space station, doesn't--on condition that they sign over to him 75% of all profits and patents resulting from the experiment, let him go along (and take his science-projects director, Sue Storm, who is Reed's former girlfriend), and pick the pilot (Sue's brother Johnny, who washed out of NASA for his hotdogging and prankstering).  (Interestingly, we see on board the station that the Marvel Universe is definitely scientifically ahead of our own: the facility seems to have artificial gravity.)  While Ben is on a spacewalk, the cosmic storm Reed knew was coming speeds up, and everyone gets a whopping dose of radiation before Doom can close the shields.  At first, back on Earth, it seems they've come through unharmed.  Then Johnny, helicopter-skiing with a nurse he's met, literally starts to burst into flames, and Ben undergoes a transformation into a creature only superficially human.  Soon afterward, Reed realizes that he can extend any portion of his body, and Sue that she can turn invisible when under emotional stress.  (Last to transform is Doom, who slowly turns into a being made of some kind of organic metal.)  Reed wants to try to reverse the process, and Ben, who's dismayed by his new form, is happy to let him.  Even Sue is ambivalent about her new power.  Only Johnny seems to understand that there's more to being the self-named Human Torch than being an idol of millions; ""What if this happened for a reason?"" he insists.  Meanwhile Doom, whose company has tanked from the unfavorable publicity, has resolved to destroy Reed...With typical Marvel angst, wonderful special effects, and an attractive cast, this is definitely one of the best of the recent crop of Marvel-based films.  One of the most visually stunning sequences is a wild multi-car accident on a New York bridge (begun when Ben tries to save a would-be suicide), climaxing with an ovation for the quartet from drivers, cops, and firefighters alike: unlike Spider-Man, the Fantastic-Four-to-be are obviously accepted from the start by officialdom.  (There's also an almost equally splendid battle with Doom in the midst of the New York street.)  Each of the Four is a clearly marked individual of whom the script makes the most that time will allow, and Doom is a wonderfully smooth and sinister presence even before his ultimate villainy comes into play.  Nothing in the movie seems especially frightening, either, so it can be recommended for all ages--and I do.

635708,A25TDEGIPHZTZS,B00005JNTU,"chris banez lim ""Crutchead""","[3, 6]","Exposed to outer space radiation- including 1 to-be super-villain, four space explorers garnered super human characteristics this side of the XMEN, altering their human DNA that entitled em to possess such qualities of super powers, that back in the earlier years of moviedom one can only wonder how the heck can they manufacture such characters live action on screen, such as a stretching person that'd be more flexible than a bar of Tootsie Roll, or a girl that could turn partially/impartially invisble (not to mention make her appear titally naked on a PG-13 movie.. invisibly that is), or a guy who consists completely of Fire, and a hulking mastadon figure completely consisting of bricks and stone. Although sci-fi fx dept.s have done quite well at times in the history of motion pictures since the days of Harryhousen's Dynamation (later labelled as Stop-motion animation)'s effects, to film the FANTASTIC FOUR comes quite unthinkable even just as far back in the '80's.However, ever since the dawning of computer/Digital animation effects are incorporated in the movie making industry (initiated by the 1984 flick THE LAST STARFIGHTER), nothing seemed to be impossible nowadays as far as special effects are concerned. Thus, its no longer a concern whether movie makers could make such and such certain scenes filmed out- but how well they have executed it well with em CGI effects comes as the matter to consider now. Unfortunately, not a lot of movies did well in executing them cgi special fx, even though the capabilities of the computer effects are quite impressive- they just hadn't handled it well enough to the point that the effects went quite lazy and even totally boring and out of context with the scenes (just look at that balony sci-fi movie called the MATRIX). Thus when I heard that they would finally come up with a flick highlighting MARVEL's first ever title the FANTASTIC FOUR, i kinda scoffed 'big deal', but then again they've done it quite well enough in the proportion of a little notch higher than their decent execution of the uncanny XMEN into the celluloid genre, it turned out.Now I'm glad that they've finally made it possible to pitt these comic book characters into the screen.It seems to be that MARVEL is quite having a ball in the movie industry these days. Whence they started out with them stiff comic cut-out animations from a handful of their titles (CAPT AMERICA; IRON MAN; SUBMARINER; THOR; HULK; then later on SPIDERMAN; AVENGERS; and a dull adaptation of FANTASTIC FOUR with Torch being replaced by a Robbie the Robot prototype, man i remember the theme songs for these cartoon series's), its not until back in the late seventies when they come up with live action adaptations for their titles - basically series' made in Canada, for TV: CAPTAIN AMERICA, INCREDIBLE HULK (Starring the late Bill Bixby, who'd turned to Lou Ferrigno, whenever Mr. McGee would make him angry - shacking Hulk into PrimeTime soap), and the short lived SPIDERMAN, plus (the only quite decent Marvel tv title then) DOCTOR STRANGE, which levels on a more adult oriented plotline (kinda like the british flick HARLEQUIN starring Jesus of Nazaretth himself- Robert Powell), which to my knowledge only went so far as a couple/pair of TV Movie episodes - made for a tv special back in those days. Whilst during in those days the other older rival comic book company have long scored a lot with its titles in cartoon, and in live-action tv series, that then ultimately instated a sort of prominence in the late seventies when they came up with the Alexander Salkind produced SUPERMAN THe Movie, and went on for some more in the suceeding years, while MARVEL on the other hand just went on to settle with animated series's including two live action titles for live-action movie feature: 1989's The PUNISHER, and CAPTAIN AMERICA.With what MARVEL have come up with its major movie titles these days - it seemed they could even come around with adapting particular cross-overs and plotlines that went in with their characters' universe as for what took place from the very pages of their respective comic book titles, such as: the team up between SPIDEY and DAREDEVIL battling an enigmatic villain from the realm of the undead for the very soul of the latter mentioned character; Pitting THE HULK to clobber with FANTASTIC FOUR's very own THE THING (yeah, just like in the comic books - it's just that (along with the DAREDEVIL flick) it's THE HULK movie that don't seem to've turned out so well for me); on another note for THE XMEN plotline its coming to the Pheonix saga quite obviously... and in all the possiblities of the prospective following movie adaptations for GHOST RIDER, another rehash of THE PUNISHER; THOR... perhaps in turn MARVEL could finally come up with a movie for their equivalent to the other comic book company's JLA -- The AVENGERS (with Scarlet Witch and her impossibly inhuman hubby The Vision).This movie depiction for FANTASTIC FOUR went swell in its overall composure, only that it could've used a little more spice then it would've been a real blast though.I only thought that they could have had someone else than Jessica Alba (star of that other comic book title tv series DARK ANGEL) to portray Invisible Gurl, but then again that one particular scene in the climax when she blew out some force wave in their battle against Doom til her nose bleeds puts her in a really pretty impressive sexy screen shot, NO PUN. Love it. She's looks so pretty cool its hot! Btw, Thing's girlfriend Alicia's depicted as a black woman in this flick which serves as one of the major alterations from the comic book basis.Had Doom evolved in his powers? Oh well...Eventually Stan ""The Man"" Lee had to appear on cameo as a mail man, as with every MARVEL flick these days; check it out. As for DR. DOOM, well, DR. DOOM could've used a Vader-like voice though, say couldn't they have incorporated David Prowse and the respectable actor who played Vader's voice, Mr. James Earl Jones?.. but then again Lucas mite sew (or rather sue) their hides.For the meantime, looks like MARVEL's doing well to make the other rival company make a run for their money - thus they've revamped the latest movie franchise that had gone bonkers due to Schumacher's gaity, whilst the prospecting ""Nicholas Cage""s prospect to star as SUPERMAN V folded (that it should), and hence they have to do a lot of catching up with their line for the movies.Hell! until them two competing major comic book companies find the nerve to clash SUPERMAN vs. SPIDERMAN like in the comic books waaay before FREDDIE vs. JASON (kinda like tis in the days of GODZILLA vs. KING KONG), then that'll be the day to say ITS CLOBBERING TIME!Say, howzabout the ELEMENTALS?MARVEL Not, I say unto thee all.

635709,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00005JNTU,Chris Kennison,"[1, 5]","Why do all of these superhero movies have to spend so much time establishing CHARACTER!!!  These comics have been around for years!!  Get to the action already!!That, in my opinion, is what is inheritantly wrong with Fantastic Four. The sequence early on, where the 5 characters are given their powers is fantastic, but then the movie spends the next hour and ten minutes exploring what they can do.GET TO THE MEAT ALREADY! Get to the action!! Yawn... show us ONCE what they can do... and get on with it!! We know anyway! We knew coming into the theatre.And if you disagree with my view, consider that EVEN ONE OF THE STARS was disappointed that they didn't get to do all that much because they were setting up the characters the entire time. He was hoping there was a sequel so they could actually get to do some things... so??  Am I wrong?I hope there's a sequel too! At least they won't have to establish character again... I don't think?  Or maybe they will, thinking that people missed the first movie... dear lord, it's a vicious circle.Okay, so Reed Richards is really stretchy and they demonstrate that by having him catch a falling glass, unlock a door and looky really droopy in a mirror. Exciting stuff. Sue Storm can make herself invisible and they find equally exciting ways to demonstrate this. Ben Grimm becomes the Thing, a human rock, and he runs around accidentally knocking stuff over, accidentally breaking doors and crushing buttons. Johnny Storm becomes the human torch and until the end of the movie... he only used his powers to fight... well... no... to fly around a motorcross event and to fight... no... he flies more... well... I guess he has a little 'tiff' with his good buddy, the Thing. Does that count as a fight?FANTASTIC FOUR lacks emotions and you never really feel any REAL DANGER in this movie. Dr. Doom is a VERY VERY small part. Toward the end of the movie... he just decides that he wants to destroy the Fantastic Four and the battle is on.... a very short battle I might add.I'm not saying you shouldn't set up these characters and say how they came about.... but dear lord... don't spend 2/3 of the movie doing that!The effects were good, but the screenplay was a complete disaster. Many of the special effects scenes were basically just showing off what they could do with their f/x computers in scenes that weren't all that important anyway.The biggest scene of the movie, was a chain-reaction disaster on a bridge that is caused by... well... the Thing. THE BIGGEST SCENE OF THE MOVIE and it involved NO VILLAINS. The Thing sets the chain reaction in place and then saves the day to become a hero? ""Sorry... I caused a huge chain reaction car crash where numbers of people could have and should have been killed, but I did save this one guy.""A successful movie needs many things to make it memorable and make it good... first of all, you need to establish good characters, which this movie does so in OVERKILL.  Secondly, you need a strong nemesis (DOOM IS OVERSHADOWED), Thirdly, you need a script that allows your audience to play along and feel urgency and fear (SWING AND A MISS) and Finally, you need a reason for the audience TO BE CONCERNED and not have to work to root for the outcome. FANTASTIC FOUR doesn't do this at all.The movie isn't horrible, I'm only saying that it was a disappointment, not at all challenging, run of the mill and needed to give DR. DOOM more to do in order to fix it.I just thought this movie was very weak and wasted too much time GETTING TO THE POINT... which wasn't much of one...I think it was... OOH COOL, lOOK WHAT I CAN DO... FIGHT... DESTROY FANTASTIC FOUR... that was about it.",2,Not So FANTASTIC 4,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,3667,"['Why', 'do', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'establishing', 'CHARACTER', 'comics', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'Get', 'action', 'already', 'opinion', 'what', 'inheritantly', 'wrong', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'sequence', 'early', 'where', '5', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'powers', 'fantastic', 'then', 'movie', 'next', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'exploring', 'what', 'can', 'do.GET', 'TO', 'THE', 'MEAT', 'ALREADY', 'Get', 'action', 'Yawn', 'show', 'ONCE', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'anyway', 'knew', 'coming', 'theatre.And', 'disagree', 'view', 'consider', 'EVEN', 'ONE', 'THE', 'STARS', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'that', 'much', 'were', 'setting', 'up', 'characters', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'hoping', 'there', 'was', 'sequel', 'could', 'actually', 'get', 'do', 'things', 'so', 'Am', 'wrong', 'hope', 'sequel', 'too', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'establish', 'character', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'maybe', 'will', 'thinking', 'people', 'missed', 'first', 'movie', 'dear', 'lord', 'vicious', 'circle.Okay', 'so', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'really', 'stretchy', 'demonstrate', 'having', 'catch', 'falling', 'glass', 'unlock', 'door', 'looky', 'really', 'mirror', 'Exciting', 'stuff', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'can', 'make', 'invisible', 'find', 'equally', 'exciting', 'ways', 'demonstrate', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Thing', 'human', 'rock', 'accidentally', 'knocking', 'stuff', 'accidentally', 'breaking', 'doors', 'crushing', 'buttons', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'human', 'torch', 'end', 'movie', 'only', 'used', 'powers', 'fight', 'well', 'fly', 'motorcross', 'event', 'fight', 'more', 'well', 'guess', 'little', ""'tiff"", 'good', 'buddy', 'Thing', 'count', 'fight', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'emotions', 'never', 'really', 'feel', 'REAL', 'DANGER', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'small', 'part', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'destroy', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'battle', 'very', 'short', 'battle', 'might', 'add.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'characters', 'say', 'how', 'came', 'dear', 'lord', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', '2/3', 'movie', 'doing', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'screenplay', 'was', 'complete', 'disaster', 'Many', 'special', 'effects', 'scenes', 'were', 'basically', 'just', 'showing', 'off', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'f/x', 'computers', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'important', 'anyway.The', 'biggest', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'chain-reaction', 'disaster', 'bridge', 'caused', 'well', 'Thing', 'THE', 'BIGGEST', 'SCENE', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'involved', 'NO', 'VILLAINS', 'Thing', 'chain', 'reaction', 'place', 'then', 'day', 'become', 'hero', 'Sorry', 'caused', 'huge', 'chain', 'reaction', 'car', 'crash', 'where', 'numbers', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'did', 'save', 'one', 'guy', 'successful', 'movie', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'memorable', 'make', 'good', 'first', 'need', 'establish', 'good', 'characters', 'movie', 'so', 'OVERKILL', 'Secondly', 'need', 'strong', 'nemesis', 'DOOM', 'IS', 'OVERSHADOWED', 'Thirdly', 'need', 'script', 'audience', 'play', 'along', 'feel', 'urgency', 'fear', 'SWING', 'A', 'MISS', 'Finally', 'need', 'reason', 'audience', 'TO', 'BE', 'CONCERNED', 'not', 'have', 'work', 'root', 'outcome', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', ""n't"", 'do', 'all.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'horrible', ""'m"", 'only', 'saying', 'was', 'disappointment', 'not', 'challenging', 'run', 'mill', 'needed', 'give', 'DR.', 'DOOM', 'more', 'do', 'order', 'fix', 'it.I', 'just', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'wasted', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'GETTING', 'TO', 'THE', 'POINT', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'one', 'think', 'was', 'OOH', 'COOL', 'lOOK', 'WHAT', 'CAN', 'DO', 'FIGHT', 'DESTROY', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'was']",Fantastic Four
635710,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B00005JNTU,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[9, 28]","As part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that I have missed over the past few years I came across this clunker. I understand, of course, that I am not the target demographic here. Most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity; unfortunately I was looking for an actual cinematic experience. Four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named Dr. Von Doom (who wins the award for the Most Obvious Name for a Villain Ever); they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers (now we're talking) thanks to some chemical filled cloud. What follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history. Special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show. We get The Thing caving in the front of a semi-truck with his shoulder as the money shot, but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified. An entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers. But since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered, and succeed. Destruction for the fans, no consequences for the characters. But why would director Tim Story try anyways? He knows the people are just showing up to ogle at Jessica Alba as she pretends to act. So instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame. He should have just directed a Pepsi commercial with Jessica Alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess.The plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining. Instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble. They aren't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie. They go out, show off their powers (in things like extreme sports, you know, for the kids), and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough. There is also a lackluster love triangle between Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Dr. Von Doom (Julian McMahon). I'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like Jessica Alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful, all wealthy Dr. Von Doom. But chances are if you're chasing someone that looks like her she's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career. So why is my rating so high above the zero I've been talking it up to be? Well it is what it is. It didn't put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly. It was fun watching TV actors such as Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon try their luck at a Hollywood blockbuster. And at least it wasn't ""Catwoman."" But what it was was insulting. Beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe Jessica Alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid Story thinks we are. At a newsstand, on the cover of People magazine there is a picture of Sue Storm. Now if Stephen Hawkings can't make it to the cover of People then what chance does this two-bit scientist have? **1/4",2,For Frat Boys and the Officially Brain Dead,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,3220,"['part', 'ongoing', 'quest', 'catch', 'up', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'have', 'missed', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'came', 'clunker', 'understand', 'course', 'am', 'not', 'target', 'demographic', 'here', 'Most', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'movies', 'authenticity', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'looking', 'actual', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Four', 'scientists', 'go', 'gallivanting', 'around', 'space', 'chump', 'named', 'Dr', 'Von', 'Doom', 'who', 'award', 'Most', 'Obvious', 'Name', 'Villain', 'Ever', 'run', 'trouble', 'are', 'recipients', 'super', 'powers', 'now', ""'re"", 'talking', 'thanks', 'chemical', 'filled', 'cloud', 'What', 'one', 'most', 'shameless', 'attempts', 'buy', 'box', 'office', 'victory', 'history', 'Special', 'effects', 'pile', 'top', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'quickly', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'more', 'dull', 'fireworks', 'show', 'get', 'Thing', 'caving', 'front', 'semi-truck', 'shoulder', 'money', 'shot', 'middle', 'scene', 'left', 'mystified', 'entire', 'bridge', 'just', 'about', 'car', 'are', 'destroyed', 'four', 'farting', 'around', 'found', 'powers', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'have', 'watch', 'scramble', 'save', 'everybody', 'endangered', 'succeed', 'Destruction', 'fans', 'consequences', 'characters', 'why', 'would', 'director', 'Tim', 'Story', 'try', 'anyways', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'ogle', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'act', 'So', 'instead', 'focusing', 'story', 'making', 'sure', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'product', 'placements', 'make', 'frame', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'directed', 'Pepsi', 'commercial', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'saved', 'trouble', 'watching', 'mess.The', 'plot', 'also', 'outwardly', 'defiant', 'interest', 'being', 'even', 'little', 'entertaining', 'Instead', 'watching', 'good', 'fight', 'are', 'stuck', 'watching', 'superheroes', 'squabble', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'bad', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'go', 'out', 'show', 'off', 'powers', 'things', 'extreme', 'sports', 'know', 'kids', 'then', 'yell', 'other', 'not', 'being', 'discreet', 'enough', 'also', 'lackluster', 'love', 'triangle', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Dr', 'Von', 'Doom', 'Julian', 'McMahon', ""'m"", 'sure', 'real', 'nice', 'believe', 'someone', 'who', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'would', 'rather', 'go', 'out', 'lowly', 'scientist', 'opposed', 'powerful', 'wealthy', 'Dr', 'Von', 'Doom', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'chasing', 'someone', 'not', 'interested', 'kind', 'demeanor', 'meaningful', 'career', 'So', 'why', 'rating', 'so', 'high', 'zero', ""'ve"", 'been', 'talking', 'be', 'Well', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'sleep', 'fairly', 'harmlessly', 'quickly', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'TV', 'actors', 'such', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'try', 'luck', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'Catwoman', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'insulting', 'obvious', 'point', 'nobody', 'would', 'believe', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'scientist', 'just', 'how', 'stupid', 'Story', 'thinks', 'are', 'newsstand', 'cover', 'People', 'magazine', 'picture', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Now', 'Stephen', 'Hawkings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'cover', 'People', 'then', 'what', 'chance', 'two-bit', 'scientist', 'have', '**1/4']",Fantastic Four

It was like a live action Jack Kirby and Stan Lee experience - pure fun and just classic.  One of the hardest things to do in making this movie, it seems, was to develop the characters.  They are all so interelated b/c in the long run they are all family.  I've enjoyed other comic book movies in the past - especially Batman Begins, but within the genre its better to rate each movie on there own or with there sequel.  In the end FF is a family of super heroes trying to deal with their power in the general public, which is a refreshing change to having to worry about your identity being uncovered or someone discovering the batcave.

I wanted to get the DVD, but I could not do it.  I got the BD because I got it at a decent rice.  After watching it, I walked away with a bad feeling...My rule on movies is simple.  If it is 90 minutes, it is bound to suck.  It means that no one took the time to write a deep and detailed story, let alone do anything else.  9 times out of 10 this holds to be true.  If a film is an hour and 45 minutes, it is usually decent with a little more time for a complete story and thought out scenes.  Again, this holds true 9 times out of ten.  If a film is 1 hour and 50 minutes or better, it is usually a masterpiece as you can tell that time was given to tell a story and everything else involved.  It shows that it has substance.  I don't have to tell you that the beloved films of all time are at least 2 hours long and the worst are 1 and a half hours or less!This one is on the level of Elektra and Cat Woman - maybe a little better.  The look was ok, but Sue, Doom and Reed were wrongly cast and I still cannot understand how Alba is playing a white character!  Johnny and Ben were cast well enough.  The story should have been deeper, but maybe before filming began they knew that it was going to be short.  I believe that some directors who never read comicbooks don't take the approach to these films seriously.Now, the special effects were cheesy and unbelievable in most cases.  Alba looked like a child and not white as Sue is in the comics.  Reed looked like a C list actor and I believe he is the same guy who played in the prototype FF4 movie.  The actor who played Doom was horrible and had no type of feeling.The writing and/or budget caused a problem with the story.  They get powers, discover them and then they already have them mastered?  Doom starts to change and then for NO REASON at all, he dons a clasic Dr. Doom mask and uniform without any reason given for the mask to exist and for him to have put it on other than the fact that the character wheres it!  He just gets the uniform out of no where and puts it on for what reason?  His face did not even come close to the hideous looks of the comic for him to even think about covering it up.The writing is EVERYTHING is a movie.  When that is bad, NOTHING can save a movie - NOTHING.  This is only good if you are a Marvel fan.  Now I am off to watch part two.  If that is more fo the same, then maybe The Punisher and The Hulk are not the only other films who need a complete overhaul...",2,One of the worst Marvel films!,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,2596,"['clearly', 'reason', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'watch', 'wanted', 'see', 'theater', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'go', 'wanted', 'get', 'DVD', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'got', 'BD', 'got', 'decent', 'rice', 'watching', 'walked', 'away', 'bad', 'feeling', 'rule', 'movies', 'simple', '90', 'minutes', 'bound', 'suck', 'one', 'took', 'time', 'write', 'deep', 'detailed', 'story', 'let', 'alone', 'do', 'anything', 'else', '9', 'times', '10', 'be', 'true', 'film', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'usually', 'decent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'complete', 'story', 'thought', 'out', 'scenes', 'Again', 'true', '9', 'times', 'ten', 'film', '1', 'hour', '50', 'minutes', 'better', 'usually', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'tell', 'time', 'was', 'given', 'tell', 'story', 'everything', 'else', 'involved', 'substance', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tell', 'beloved', 'films', 'time', 'are', 'least', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'worst', 'are', '1', 'half', 'hours', 'less', 'one', 'level', 'Elektra', 'Cat', 'Woman', 'maybe', 'little', 'better', 'look', 'was', 'ok', 'Sue', 'Doom', 'Reed', 'were', 'wrongly', 'cast', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'Alba', 'playing', 'white', 'character', 'Johnny', 'Ben', 'were', 'cast', 'well', 'enough', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'deeper', 'maybe', 'filming', 'began', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'short', 'believe', 'directors', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'comicbooks', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'approach', 'films', 'seriously.Now', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'cheesy', 'unbelievable', 'most', 'cases', 'Alba', 'looked', 'child', 'not', 'white', 'Sue', 'comics', 'Reed', 'looked', 'C', 'list', 'actor', 'believe', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'prototype', 'FF4', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Doom', 'was', 'horrible', 'had', 'type', 'feeling.The', 'writing', 'and/or', 'budget', 'caused', 'problem', 'story', 'get', 'powers', 'discover', 'then', 'already', 'have', 'mastered', 'Doom', 'change', 'then', 'NO', 'REASON', 'clasic', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'mask', 'uniform', 'reason', 'given', 'mask', 'exist', 'have', 'put', 'other', 'fact', 'character', 'just', 'uniform', 'where', 'what', 'reason', 'face', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'hideous', 'looks', 'comic', 'even', 'think', 'covering', 'up.The', 'writing', 'EVERYTHING', 'movie', 'When', 'bad', 'NOTHING', 'can', 'save', 'movie', 'NOTHING', 'only', 'good', 'are', 'Marvel', 'fan', 'Now', 'am', 'off', 'watch', 'part', 'two', 'more', 'fo', 'same', 'then', 'maybe', 'Punisher', 'Hulk', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'other', 'films', 'who', 'need', 'complete', 'overhaul']",Fantastic Four

It's dumb. It's fun. It's ""Fantastic Four,"" an adaptation of the Marvel Comics series about a quartet of humans transformed into superheroes.Scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and pilots Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), rocket into space, catch a blast of a cosmic wave and return to Earth with strange new abilities: Reed can stretch his limbs like elastic; Sue can become invisible and project force fields; Johnny can generate and control flames; and Ben is transformed into a hulking, stone-skinned behemoth.Naturally, they have no choice but to use their powers for the greater good.On comic book pages, the Fantastic Four were always heavier ""advanced placement"" heroes: They were independently wealthy and most of their adventures involved space travel and quantum physics; secure in their fancy high-rise, the Four didn't even bother with secret identities.But director Tim Story, and writers Michael France and Mark Frost, have adapted the saga into something infinitely less serious and enjoyably goofy. Here, the science, and most of the drama, is strictly on the level of ""Gilligan's Island,"" though with a little more irony and funnier jokes.Onscreen, Gruffudd's Reed Richards, for example, is no longer the grim intellect of the comic book but a bankrupt, absent-minded egghead whom another character aptly calls, ""the world's dumbest smart guy.""The filmmakers focus most of the movie on the Four's attempts to understand and deal with their new powers, with occasional asides as the camera ogles Alba in her skintight supersuit. Gigantic plot holes abound and a big showdown at the end almost feels like an afterthought.But this is one of those movies in which plot holes and bad lines are beside the point, and the movie's giddy tone is set by Evans' Human Torch, a kid who's simply ecstatic to discover he's got superpowers. Though Michael Chiklis, as the deformed Ben Grimm, stands out as the movie's sulking heart.Longtime comic book fans, and viewers who can't relax and go with the flow, may absolutely hate this movie, and honestly I sometimes couldn't tell if I was laughing with it or at it. But considering this is a story that involves rubber-faced heroes, cosmic waves and bad guys with names like ""Victor Von Doom,"" it's probably best spun as a comedy.

As soon as one popular genre film comes out that makes everyone notice, pretty soon legions of imitators come out. Scream comes out, we get I Know What You Did..., Urban Legend and many others. Well after the success of Spiderman and the X-Men movies, pretty soon others followed: Daredevil, Elektra, The Punisher and of course this film. While it's not that bad of a film, there's certainly a wasted idea here.Reed is a scientist who wants to study an odd cloud that'll pass by the Earth. It did once and possibly started life on the planet. Only he needs money so he enlists Victor Von Doom, head of a major corporation. Along for the ride are Reed's old flame Susan, her brother Johnny and Reed's friend Ben. During the mission, the cloud appears earlier than scheduled and everyone gets a blast of radiation.Reed finds that he's quite stretchy, elongating parts of his body(woman fans would love this) Susan can go invisible and create force fields, Johnny the hothead can turn or bend flame while Ben is a big...Thing, hence his name, with superhuman strength. Saving the day on a bridge, media attention typically goes overboard making reluctant starts of the mutant.Victor also underwent a transformation too, and not just powers-wise. Since his company is going under more than over, he blames our heroes. His plot is to destroy his enemies, namely the titular team. That I like since most enemies want to rule the world, destroy the city or something. Here it's just ""kill those guys"".This is probably some of the worst case of CGI in a superhero movie I've ever seen. Mr. Fantastic's stretchyness looks seriously bad, while some other effects kinda bad. But then again Johnny in Human Torch-mode looks great and Sue's force field, especially at the end looks cool. That odd cloud at the beginning was well done as well.Casting is ever-so-important in a movie, especially when it deals with superheroes. Some work well such as Justin McMahon as our villain, Ioan Gruffudd(his name pronounciation is Yo-Han Griff-ud) is good as Reed but like I said, his stretchyness is bad. And typically miscast Jessica Alba looks great of course but not that much believable. Michael Chiklis is good too despite being under heavy makeup.Now, I'm most likely going to be right but I say wait for the 2-disc super edition most likely around spring of 2006.

635720,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JNTU,Craig Matteson,"[2, 3]","Ah, comic book movies always have a hard time of it.  How do you strike the balance of nostalgia for the older audience and still update the story enough to involve the young people.  Another aspect is deciding whether you want the film to feel to the older audience the way it felt to them as a kid (so you would have to step up the intensity of the story quite a bit) or do you recreate the story as it was (to put on film the stories we loved as kids).  Well, this movie tries to have it all ways and ends up a bit confusing.  It updates the story of how the Fantastic Four came to be and their emotional struggles, but keeps the struggle with Dr. Doom much like the way it was done decades ago; lots of flying around, banging around, but not much real threat or damage except to property.Still, I am glad to have seen the story and hope they do another, better, edition of this group.  Each of the actors is good for his or her role, including and especially Alicia (Kerry Washington) for Ben Grimm.  She can be developed and integrated into the story much more than she was in this film.BUT, please, stop with the comic book stupidities like the Human Torch risking igniting the atmosphere because he went to 4,000 degrees Kelvin (which is only 6,740 degrees Farenheit).  Nuclear reactions are magnitudes hotter and controllable.  Puh-leeze.  And calling that temperature Super Nova is dumber than dumb.  A Super Nova is an exploding star, not a temperature.

635721,A2BT578J4IZOK6,B00005JNTU,"Craobh Rua ""Craobh Rua""","[0, 0]","""Fantastic Four"" hit the big screens in 2005, and is based on the Marvel comic book.Reed Richards is, quite possibly, the most gifted scientist to ever have graduated from MIT. Currently researching the human genome, he believes the evolutionary process on Earth may have been triggered a cosmic storm. Luckily, precisely the type of cloud Richards has factored into his work will soon pass close to Earth's orbit. However, to continue his work, he needs help - specifically financial aid and a trip into space. Together with his sidekick, astronaut Ben Grimm, Richards pays a visit to Dr. Victor von Doom - not only an ex-classmate, but also a well-heeled native of Latveria. Where Richards is struggling financially, things are going a little better for von Doom - he is now the head of his own business and has his own very well-shielded space station.Von Doom agrees to fund the experiment and grants the pair access to the space station - however, the deal is not without its conditions. Victor will take the lion's share of any future profits and his Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm will also be brought on-board. (Ms. Storm also happens to be Reed's ex-girlfriend, though exactly what she ever saw in him is never made clear). Ben had hoped to pilot the shuttle to the space station. Unfortunately, Sue's brother, Johnny, is the company's resident pilot and will be commanding the flight. (Johnny is something of a loose cannon who was thrown out of NASA).The five travel to the space station together - only to be caught out by the cosmic storm, which arrives ahead of schedule. Ben takes the biggest hit the storm can offer, having been on a spacewalk at the time. Reed, Susan and Johnny were inside, though they had been trying to rescue Ben and weren't protected by the station's strongest shielding. Victor, like a true villain, made sure that he was in the safest part of the station. All five survive - though Reed seems to have been right about the storm's effect on the evolutionary process. Everyone on-board develops new abilities - Reed becomes able to bend and stretch like rubber, Susan can become invisible while Johnny can become a human of living fire, rather than flesh and blood. However, all three can switch their powers on and off and there's no change to their outward appearance. Ben, on the other hand, can't : he has evolved into a creature made of rock. Despite the superhuman strength, it's not something he's terribly pleased about. (Neither is his fianc&eacute;e - who doesn't take long in returning the ring). However, there are bigger problems ahead - specifically Doom and his newly acquired powers.I found the movie pretty ordinary overall - there wasn't much of a storyline beyond 'this is how we got our powers'. (The point of the film, I'm guessing, was solely to set things up for the planned sequels). I can't say I was too fond of either Reed (limp, dreary and let's face it : he has the world's worst super-power) or Johnny (irritating brat). If it had been the Fantastic Two, I'd have been cheering for Doctor Doom - Julian McMahon does a pretty good job with that role. However, Ben Grimm proves to be a likeable character and - since there's a shot of Jessica Alba in her underwear - I'll give the film my unreserved recommendation.",3,It's Clobbering Time !,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,3293,"['Fantastic', 'Four', 'hit', 'big', 'screens', '2005', 'based', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book.Reed', 'Richards', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'gifted', 'scientist', 'ever', 'have', 'graduated', 'MIT', 'Currently', 'researching', 'human', 'genome', 'evolutionary', 'process', 'Earth', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'triggered', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'Luckily', 'precisely', 'type', 'cloud', 'Richards', 'factored', 'work', 'will', 'soon', 'pass', 'close', 'Earth', 'orbit', 'However', 'continue', 'work', 'help', 'specifically', 'financial', 'aid', 'trip', 'space', 'Together', 'sidekick', 'astronaut', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Richards', 'visit', 'Dr.', 'Victor', 'von', 'Doom', 'not', 'only', 'ex-classmate', 'also', 'well-heeled', 'native', 'Latveria', 'Where', 'Richards', 'struggling', 'financially', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'little', 'better', 'von', 'Doom', 'now', 'head', 'own', 'business', 'own', 'very', 'well-shielded', 'space', 'station.Von', 'Doom', 'fund', 'experiment', 'grants', 'pair', 'access', 'space', 'station', 'however', 'deal', 'not', 'conditions', 'Victor', 'will', 'take', 'lion', 'share', 'future', 'profits', 'Director', 'Genetic', 'Research', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'brought', 'on-board', 'Ms.', 'Storm', 'also', 'be', 'Reed', 'ex-girlfriend', 'though', 'exactly', 'what', 'ever', 'saw', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'Ben', 'had', 'hoped', 'pilot', 'shuttle', 'space', 'station', 'Unfortunately', 'Sue', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'company', 'resident', 'pilot', 'will', 'be', 'commanding', 'flight', 'Johnny', 'something', 'loose', 'cannon', 'who', 'was', 'thrown', 'NASA', '.The', 'five', 'travel', 'space', 'station', 'together', 'only', 'be', 'caught', 'out', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'ahead', 'schedule', 'Ben', 'biggest', 'hit', 'storm', 'can', 'offer', 'having', 'been', 'spacewalk', 'time', 'Reed', 'Susan', 'Johnny', 'were', 'inside', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'rescue', 'Ben', 'were', ""n't"", 'protected', 'station', 'strongest', 'shielding', 'Victor', 'true', 'villain', 'made', 'sure', 'was', 'safest', 'part', 'station', 'five', 'survive', 'Reed', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'storm', 'effect', 'evolutionary', 'process', 'Everyone', 'on-board', 'develops', 'new', 'abilities', 'Reed', 'able', 'bend', 'stretch', 'rubber', 'Susan', 'can', 'become', 'invisible', 'Johnny', 'can', 'become', 'human', 'living', 'fire', 'rather', 'flesh', 'blood', 'However', 'three', 'can', 'switch', 'powers', 'change', 'outward', 'appearance', 'Ben', 'other', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'evolved', 'creature', 'made', 'rock', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'not', 'something', 'terribly', 'pleased', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'returning', 'ring', 'However', 'are', 'bigger', 'problems', 'ahead', 'specifically', 'Doom', 'newly', 'acquired', 'powers.I', 'found', 'movie', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'storyline', ""'this"", 'how', 'got', 'powers', 'point', 'film', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'solely', 'set', 'things', 'up', 'planned', 'sequels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'too', 'fond', 'Reed', 'limp', 'dreary', 'let', 'face', 'world', 'worst', 'super-power', 'Johnny', 'irritating', 'brat', 'had', 'been', 'Fantastic', 'Two', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'cheering', 'Doctor', 'Doom', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'However', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'be', 'likeable', 'character', 'shot', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'underwear', ""'ll"", 'give', 'film', 'unreserved', 'recommendation']",Fantastic Four

635726,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B00005JNTU,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[7, 10]","I read the professional reviews by people like Roger Ebert.  I ignored their negative attacks and went to go see this film.  I am very glad I did.  I found this movie to have a little bit of everything and a whole lot of action.Let's start off with an explanation of why Ebert didn't like this film: Roger Ebert is an extreme LIBERAL and a politically correct junkie; unless a film has some ""leftist message"" or has a ""leftist actor"" in it, he probably is going to knock it.  This film is NOT politically correct, has no jokes bashing the current president, doesn't support abortion or euthanasia, and doesn't take a stand on gay rights.  Of course Ebert is going to hate the film!  Ebert has taken that whole ""liberal arts"" thing completely out of context.Oh, one more thing, had this film sprinkled the ""F"" word in every thirty or forty seconds, had some severe love scenes, and showed the cast helping little old bag ladies across the street in between real emergencies, Ebert would have put his useless thumbs up!I have read some reviews about how this was just a comic book made into a film. DUH!  That's exactly what it is, and exactly what I expected to see when I sat down with my garbage bag full of popcorn and gallon of Coca-Cola in a crowded theater.Fantastic 4 is an action-packed film with a lot of laughs and a lot of action.  Also, this film did a lot more to build up the audience's disdain for the bad guy, Victor Von Doom.  Spider-Man 2 failed to do that, and in my opinion, if a movie fails to make the audience want to see the bad guy get smashed then it's failed to do its job.On to the cast:Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards is a perfect fit.  He catches the personality perfect, and it was fun to watch him try and keep the other members of the Fantastic 4 inline.Jessica Alba as Sue Storm worked for me.  Yeah, I've read the reviews here at Amazon.  I know she's a cutie and all that.  But I'm a happily married man, and besides, my wife might see this review.  So I'll just tell ya that I think she is the best Sue Storm ever!  Seriously, she can act, and I really enjoyed her work on screen with Ioan (does anyone even know how to pronounce that) and the rest of the cast.Chris Evans turns in his best performance to date as Johnny Storm.  He really made the film fun to watch.  Of course some of the credit has to go to Michael France and Mark Frost for writing such an excellent script / screenplay.Michael Chiklis is the perfect Ben Grimm.  My thirteen-year-old daughter was balling her eyes out when he was trying to pick up his wife's wedding ring on the bridge.  Never has any person so nailed a super-hero character the way Chiklis does in this film.  I used to read the Fantastic 4 comic books as a kid, and I would have never dreamed the Thing could have ever made it to the big screen in such a convincing manner.  Great job Chiklis!  I think you should put the suit back on and pay Roger Ebert a visit!Julian McMahon, I just want to let you know that I hated you from the opening scenes on!  You make me sick; exactly what a bad guy is supposed to do.  Great job as Victor Von Doom.  I hope there is a sequel.  I'd like to see if you could pull it off two times in a row.I liked everything about this movie: the writing, casting, special effects, music, and even the movie posters.  I think the professional movie critics who panned this movie need to find new careers.  Fantastic 4 rocks!  I will buy this DVD the second it is released.  No, I don't buy illegal DVDs, so yes, I do have to wait!Go see this film!  Buy this DVD!See ya next review!",5,Roger Ebert Is Wrong!  This Movie Is Great!

635727,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005JNTU,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[48, 72]","As the current wave of digital special effects superhero movies go, the Fantastic Four doesn't match to others in the genre like Spiderman 2, the first X-Men movie, or the recent Batman Begins.  Like the X-Men, the F4 are a team, but what's central to the film is the personality dynamics and clashes that occur between its four members, Reed Richards, Susan Storm, her brother Johnny, and Ben Grimm, whose alter egos are respectively the elastic Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, who can also generate force field, the Human Torch whose temperature can go up to a supernova, and the Thing.  In the movie, it's the bratty, arrogant, smart-aleck Johnny who comes up with their names.As the film begins, the four are working for Victor Von Doom of Von Doom Industries.  An outer space experiment goes awry as the team and their boss are caught up in a cosmic storm appearing earlier than predicted.  Back on Earth, everything seems fine, until they discover their special powers.  However, for Ben Grimm, who's transformed into the yellow, rocky behemoth, is less than thrilled, as he stays the way he is, coupled by his wife's leaving him.  He is thus the one most eager for Richards to find a cure to their condition, an eagerness than turns to impatience and frustration.Part of that is due to Johnny, who's carefree, insulting, bratty attitude grates on his nerves.  I know-it sure did mine, as I've never seen anyone as obnoxious since Tom Cruise's character in A Few Good Men.  In a scene where the Thing crumples Johnny's expensive red Porsche into a compact ball, I mentally raised a fist in the air.  ""Well done, Thing!""  Johnny's the only one for the four who celebrates his condition, and the special effects of him as the Torch are actually laudable.  His flaunting attitude causes trouble for the other members, who want to be discrete so they can be left alone to find a cure, and for Doom, for whom the publicity causes his company's decline.Much of the film focuses on Richards' attempts to reverse their condition, meaning to recreate the cosmic storm in the Baxter building.  However, there's also a subplot involving Reed and Susan, who were exes, but Reed was too focused on his work, so Susan drifted off to Victor, who was more a take-charge kind of guy.  Their predicament unites them together, as they try to sort out why their relationship ended.Given Victor's last name, it's clear as to who he eventually becomes, but he too is affected by the aftereffects of the storm, and he turns darker as his stockholders decide to jump ships following the catastrophe.There is a feeling that too much was being attempted in F4, the romantic subplot, scientific experiment subplot, conflicts within the members, which I found the most interesting thing in the movie, and later with Doom, and the two major action sequences.  But at least the Thing's clich&eacute;d line ""It's clobbering time"" is used only once.  The ones to watch are Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm/the Thing), Jessica Alba (Susan Storm/Invisible Girl) for obvious reasons, and despite what I said before, Chris Evans (Johnny Storm), with Julian McMahon (Victor von Doom) being a pale corporate head turned villain.At least it's better than Daredevil, and hey, in terms of action movies, I've seen worse.",3,"Fantastic powers, maybe, but film is merely okay",1123891200,"08 13, 2005",2005,3282,"['current', 'wave', 'digital', 'special', 'effects', 'superhero', 'movies', 'go', 'Fantastic', 'Four', ""n't"", 'match', 'others', 'genre', 'Spiderman', '2', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'recent', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'X-Men', 'F4', 'are', 'team', 'what', 'central', 'film', 'personality', 'dynamics', 'clashes', 'occur', 'four', 'members', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'alter', 'egos', 'are', 'respectively', 'elastic', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Invisible', 'Girl', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'generate', 'force', 'field', 'Human', 'Torch', 'temperature', 'can', 'go', 'up', 'supernova', 'Thing', 'movie', 'bratty', 'arrogant', 'smart-aleck', 'Johnny', 'who', 'up', 'names.As', 'film', 'four', 'are', 'working', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'Von', 'Doom', 'Industries', 'outer', 'space', 'experiment', 'awry', 'team', 'boss', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'appearing', 'earlier', 'predicted', 'Back', 'Earth', 'everything', 'fine', 'discover', 'special', 'powers', 'However', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'who', 'transformed', 'yellow', 'rocky', 'behemoth', 'less', 'thrilled', 'way', 'coupled', 'wife', 'leaving', 'thus', 'one', 'most', 'eager', 'Richards', 'find', 'cure', 'condition', 'eagerness', 'impatience', 'frustration.Part', 'due', 'Johnny', 'who', 'carefree', 'insulting', 'bratty', 'attitude', 'grates', 'nerves', 'know-it', 'sure', 'did', 'mine', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'obnoxious', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'scene', 'where', 'Thing', 'Johnny', 'expensive', 'red', 'Porsche', 'compact', 'ball', 'mentally', 'raised', 'fist', 'air', 'Well', 'done', 'Thing', 'Johnny', 'only', 'one', 'four', 'who', 'condition', 'special', 'effects', 'Torch', 'are', 'actually', 'laudable', 'flaunting', 'attitude', 'causes', 'trouble', 'other', 'members', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'discrete', 'can', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'find', 'cure', 'Doom', 'whom', 'publicity', 'company', 'decline.Much', 'film', 'Richards', 'attempts', 'reverse', 'condition', 'meaning', 'recreate', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'Baxter', 'building', 'However', 'also', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Reed', 'Susan', 'who', 'were', 'exes', 'Reed', 'was', 'too', 'focused', 'work', 'so', 'Susan', 'drifted', 'off', 'Victor', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'take-charge', 'kind', 'guy', 'predicament', 'together', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'why', 'relationship', 'Victor', 'last', 'name', 'clear', 'who', 'eventually', 'too', 'affected', 'aftereffects', 'storm', 'darker', 'stockholders', 'decide', 'jump', 'ships', 'following', 'catastrophe.There', 'feeling', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'being', 'attempted', 'F4', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'subplot', 'conflicts', 'members', 'found', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'later', 'Doom', 'two', 'major', 'action', 'sequences', 'least', 'Thing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'line', 'clobbering', 'time', 'used', 'only', 'once', 'ones', 'watch', 'are', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Ben', 'Grimm/the', 'Thing', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Susan', 'Storm/Invisible', 'Girl', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'what', 'said', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'Victor', 'von', 'Doom', 'being', 'pale', 'corporate', 'head', 'turned', 'villain.At', 'better', 'Daredevil', 'hey', 'terms', 'action', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse']",Fantastic Four

I'm not sure why, in the world of Marvel comics they're one of the top super-hero groups. When Spider-Man developed his powers, the Fantastic Four was one of the first teams he sought out. When something goes wrong, the intellect of Mr. Fantastic can be guaranteed to help, which means a lot of super-heroes turn to the FF for help. Heck, they've saved the Earth numerous times against threats from outer space and other dimensions. Yet something about the team just never connected with me. I enjoyed reading summaries of their adventures, or seeing them appear in other titles, but super-hero teams have never been my forte, always preferring the lone hero types. Because of that, the idea of a Fantastic Four movie didn't really excite me, and as the trailers poured in, my lack of excitement never grew, since what I saw looked pretty horrible compared to what I did know about the team.Fantastic Four is not a bad movie, but it is a film likely to alienate the fan base of the comic book on which it is based. In a way, maybe that's worse than sucking. After all, the creator of the Fantastic Four, Stan Lee, always called Marvel Comic fans ""true believers"".

635730,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B00005JNTU,Danno,"[1, 6]","In no way is this movie true to the spirit and characterizations of the original Marvel Comics series. Nor does it come close to either the 'Spiderman' or the 'X-Men' adaptations. That isn't to damn it as worthless, however, and I enjoyed parts of this film quite a lot. If you're a Jessica Alba fanatic, you'll probably disagree with everything I wrote here, however.In 'Fantastic Four's favor is a definite tongue-in-cheek feel. This will probably offend anyone who seriously followed the comic book, but I found it a refreshing change from all the dark, angst-ridden overly serious comic book adaptations from recent years. This isn't really a spoof, but it's closer in feel to the old Christopher Reeves 'Superman' movies and the Adam West version of 'Batman' than it is to, say, 'Blade' or 'Hulk.'Actually, 'Fantastic Four' is probably closest to guilty 1980s pleasures like 'Flash Gordon' or 'Masters of the Universe' in that it looks slick at a distance but cheezier at closer quarters.The movie's main problems are that it lacks a well-polished script and that it suffers by comparison to films like 'The Incredibles' and 'Batman Begins.' We're given absolutely no reason to care about either Sue Storm or Reed Richards, and Victor Von Doom is a vague cipher throughout; it's the supporting characters of Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm who really carry the bulk of the picture. Von Doom is particularly disappointing - one of the most important and dangerous characters in Silver Age comic books is reduced to a generic Evil White Capitalist. The effects are servicable but never truly allow you to believe that the Human Torch is really on fire or that Mr Fantastic can truly stretch his body.Still, I laughed a lot - even if many of the laughs weren't intended by the filmmakers.

Once the foursome begin to realize what their powers are, as well as the villain, Dr. Doom, coming to terms with his own powers, the fight between good and evil kicks into gear.Ioan Gruffold does a nice job as Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), a scientist who has a better relationship with numbers and his science than with the woman he truely loves, Sue Storm (Invisible Girl).  Sue's cocky brother (Human Torch) and friend Ben Grimm (The Thing) provide a lot of the comic relief for the film.  Of the four, the Human Torch and the Thing seemed to be the best developed.  Hopefully we will see more character development for Reed and Sue in the inevitable sequel.The special effects were really good, especially the Human Torch.  I was afraid the Torch's look, as well as that of Mr. Fantastic's stretchy skin wouldn't translate well to the big screen.  This film, however, made it look good.  Michael Chiklis is probably the standout of the four, becoming the monsterous looking Thing, dealing with his new appearance and the amazing strength he has acquired.Probably the weakest link in the film is Dr. Doom played by Julian McMahon of television's Nip/Tuck.  Once he became Dr. Doom, it would have been nice to have heard a darker, more sinister voice coming from the mask.  Overall, though, I think he did a fair job.  I hope they make him even darker in the next film, should he return as the villainAs with any hero story, the first film deals with the origin of its hero or heroes.  With the sequel, the director can start out with action without taking out time to explain the beginnings of the character.  With a little fine tuning, the Fantastic Four will become a very good film franchise for Marvel Comics like Spiderman and X-Men.If you are a fan of the comic books or a good action film, this is movie is for you.

This film succeeds to prove the concept that films can be made without a plot and without caring about the characters.  Unfortunately this film does both.  Of all the actors, only Michael Chiklis manages to create a character.  The rest are terrible but then again there's no script to support them.  The effects are horrible mainly because the scenes offer no energy to support them.  I know it's amazing considering we have a person that catches fire, a person who's stone, a person who creates invisible force fields and a person who's human play dough.  Dr. Doom is entirely butchered.  When he appears in the comic costume I felt like I was watching a Mel Brooks film.  It was that bad.  They made a live action FF film years ago with a $10,000 budget or so.  That was miles about this junk.I also complain about the DVD.

635738,A1KISYZSUGHL5P,B00005JNTU,David Romano,"[6, 8]","OK, when doing a comic movie you have two options.  You can play it straight to the comic, or you can take some liberties.  Either way, you have to be very careful to avoid the cheese factor.The flaw with this film, aside from the casting, is the fact that it decided to ignore 50 years of comic history to make a really bad film. I wonder how much they even tried to make this work.First, you have the nitpicks:  Reed did not work for Doom.  Doom did not get his powers from a cosmic storm (he got caught in an explosion, got his face scarred, went back home to his native country, and continued working on his technological skills in addition to learning the mystic arts after his gypsy mother was killed).  Sue was not a scientist (putting pretty blondes in glasses and calling them ""Doctor"" doesn't make them smarter if the actress in question or the script in question is awful).  Johnny wasn't the pilot, Ben was.  Oh, yeah, and there's that small matter of Reed and Sue being married shortly after getting their powers and Doom not being even remotely involved with Sue.Do I really need to continue?  It's little things like this which detract from the characters and makes you question why they do the things they do.  What drives them in the comics is replaced by practically nothing, giving us no real insight into why these people do what they do in the film.Which brings me to the second major flaw.  Or 5 flaws, actually.  Ioan, Jessica, Chris, Michael, and Julian.  Some of them did the best they could with what they had, but there wasn't much there to work with.  No way can I see these characters developing into much of anything; saying they ""only scratched the surface"" is being kind.  Rumour mill has it that Jessica Alba has already bailed on any sequels.  Hopefully the rest of the cast takes the hint.They had decades of material to come up with, and the best they could do was this.  ""Spiderman"" stayed true to the comics, and both films were hits.  Singer was able to bring a different life to the ""X-Men"" that worked, even though he tweaked a lot (by the way, there is the perfect example of how to create sexual tension among comic book characters: Hugh Jackman/Wolvie-Famke Jannsen/Jean-James Mardsen/Cyclops.  THAT was believable).  ""Sin City"" was an excellent production.  It is possible to make a good comic film.Then there are the bad ones.  ""Catwoman"", aka ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" with fur and a whip.  ""The Hulk"", which even Ang Lee admits was probably not his best film and had he not found ""Brokeback Mountain"", he may not have ever come back to the big screen.  ""Daredevil"" was just sadly done, and ""Elektra"" was a fun guilty pleasure, but still only mediocre.  The ""Fantastic Four"" will fall into this category.This film franchise has got to be cursed.  The first one is floating around only as a bootleg because it was so bad.  This one should have been ripped apart and put back together before hitting the screen.So, why two stars?  CGI and Chris Evans.

From owning a large collection of the comic books to toy hunting for the hard-to-get Invisible Woman action figures.But I kept myself away from any coverage, hype regarding the film, so I can enjoy it to the nth degree.I have to admit that I felt a bit cautious because although the Fantastic Four have been a staple of Marvel Comics history, it's not the in your face action such as X-Men and even Spider-Man.It's one of those series that has to grow on you and you learn to enjoy the characters.So,  I imagined that like the first X-Men movie where they had to go through an introduction, the same would have to be done with the first Fantastic Four movie.Sure, there will be a lot of action but at the same time, you need to know how the characters are.Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) is not your typical lead man.  He's highly intelligent, detached from society somewhat and can be a cold fish.Johnny Storm (Human Torch) is the hothead.  Playboy and always seems to get himself into something dangerous.Ben Grimm, the man who deals with being the rocky behemoth known as the Thing.And Sue Storm, the woman who loves Reed but somehow tries to find ways to get close to him (despite him being a cold and dull fish at times).So, needless to say...our heroes have their problems and for some who are looking for the charismatic action hero, they are superheroes but they aren't perfect.I happened to enjoy the film.  The pacing was a bit off at times but nevertheless, I enjoyed it and optomistic that the second movie can now be fast-paced and hard hitting.The DVD for Fantastic Four was very enjoyable with really cool.  The DVD is offered in two versions (widescreen and fullscreen) and audio quality is offered in 5.1 DTS (which sounds really awesome on my home theater).The special features for this DVD doesn't disappoint either as it feature full length audio commentary by the stars of the film, a video diary featuring the stars on their media tour for the film - which was very exciting by the way.  Deleted scenes, making of featurette, casting session, making a scene, music videos, theatrical teaser and trailer and also an inside look for the third X-Men film (which unusually got the top listing for the special features).Not everyone is going to enjoy the Fantastic Four film.  Even the comic book is not for everyone but those who stick with it learn to enjoy the characters for what they are.If I had any problem, many of us who are faithful to FF, knows that Dr. Doom doesn't go down that easily.  Otherwise Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon do a great job portraying the characters.Again, this is just the introductory film.  Hopefully with the second film, things get even better.

635751,A2TWIZ33KJCQ54,B00005JNTU,"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP""","[0, 1]","WOTHWHILE FOR FANS OF THE FANTASTIC FOUR: BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTERFIRST THOUGHTS: IT WASN'T THE X-MEN BUT IT WAS A FUN FILM TO WATCHAs a youngster during the 60s when the Marvel comic and TV animated series were running [Fantastic 4] I found this franchise to be the most interesting and compelling. When the X-Men were produced into two great feature films I was very hopeful as to the disposition of the promised Fantastic Four feature.IN A NUTSHELL: A FILM ABOUT COPING WITH CHANGE - STRESS & ESTRANGEMENTThe ""Fantastic Four"" feature film took the 'origins of the fantastic four' as the movie's theme. To this extent the film was competent, but nothing out of the ordinary, when compared to the recent X-Men and Spider Man releases. Nevertheless, this film is entertaining and does make sense, although it is not beneath pandering to young men via Jessica Alba's implicit nudity. It is mostly a film about people facing the stress and the estrangement that comes with major unexpected changes in themselves, and how others see and relate to them. This is most coherently portrayed by Ben Grim/'THE THING' [Michael Chiklis] who brings some much needed humanity to this piece in the form a small measure of a 'beauty and the beast' subplot. In essence, Ben Grim has turned into 'The Thing' and unlike the others he can not turn back - he is stuck in his superhero mode and basically feels apart from everything that was in his world, before the accident in Space. Only a blind woman can see that he is not a monster, and this could have been enlarged within the plot to good effect.THINGS TO MARVEL AT:The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge is easily the most amazing scene in the film. Ben Grim is on center stage as he confronts a would-be jumper as he ponders the same thoughts [jumping off the bridge]. With a little comedy and special effects, Ben Grim stops a huge truck cold, saves the jumper and creates a debacle on the bridge that ends with the recognition of the 'Fantastic 4' as group of superheros as a breaking headline story on the news.- * MAJOR ACTORS -

635762,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B00005JNTU,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[7, 11]","It's all Spider-Man's fault.  Ever since 2002, when ""Spider-Man"" debuted the week before the then-latest ""Star Wars"" film and proved to be a powerful contender in its own right against the intergalactic juggernaut, movie studios have been dragging out every Marvel or DC Comics license they can get their hands on and turning them into feature films.  Some are bombs (""The Hulk""), others do moderately well (""X-Men""), and some are even wildly successful (""Spider-Man 2"").  But all are generally the same:  The origin of classic comic book characters as they take down one of the fans' favorite villains.The latest offering in the comic book superhero department is ""The Fantastic Four"", about a quartet of colleagues with some very strange powers.  While on a space station monitoring a cloud of cosmic radiation, the cloud comes too close for comfort and exposes the scientists to the radiation, altering their DNA.  It is a comic book movie after all, its gotta be a little implausible.The ""leader"" of this new band of heroes is Reed Richards, a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd), who can stretch and bend his body at will.  A methodical, scientific man, Richards is glacial when it comes to making decisions, especially romantic ones, such as how to proceed with his relationship with Susan Storm, The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), who is able to project forcefields and (obviously) become invisible.  Susan's brother Johnny, now The Human Torch (Chris Evans) is a wise-cracking daredevil who can spontaneously combust at will and can, for some reason, fly.  Finally, there's poor Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who was the most exposed to the radiation, who becomes the orange rock-like The Thing.What makes this film stand out from other superhero movies is that rather than having the ""lone wolf"" superhero like Spider-Man or Batman, there's a whole group of them, which leads to interesting character dynamics.  Similar to Disney's ""The Incredibles"" in many ways, even down to most of the superpowers, ""The Fantastic Four"" capitalizes on its characters' relationships.This film has been criticized for having not enough action and too much character development, ironic considering that the problem with most comic book movies is actually the opposite.  ""Fantastic Four"" was entertaining for me because it's different.  Oh sure, there's the bad guy (getting the award for the cheesiest Bad Guy Name in history: Victor Von Doom, played by Julian McMahon) who must be stopped, but that takes a backseat to the larger problem of how these people must learn to deal with their newfound abilities and fame.  This is more then ""good guy-bad guy-fight"": and in fact, that particular aspect has been toned down to let the character struggles between the heroes take center stage.""The Fantastic Four"" is at heart, just another comic book superhero movie, but it is one that is done with honest care for good characters, good humor, and actual drama, as opposed to gratuitous violence and awesome special effects.",5,"Five-Star ""Four""",1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,3010,"['Spider-Man', 'fault', 'Ever', '2002', 'when', 'Spider-Man', 'debuted', 'week', 'then-latest', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', 'proved', 'be', 'powerful', 'contender', 'own', 'right', 'intergalactic', 'juggernaut', 'movie', 'studios', 'have', 'been', 'dragging', 'out', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'Comics', 'license', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'turning', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'bombs', 'Hulk', 'others', 'do', 'moderately', 'well', 'X-Men', 'are', 'even', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'are', 'generally', 'same', 'origin', 'classic', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'take', 'down', 'one', 'fans', 'favorite', 'villains.The', 'latest', 'offering', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'department', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'quartet', 'colleagues', 'very', 'strange', 'powers', 'space', 'station', 'monitoring', 'cloud', 'cosmic', 'radiation', 'cloud', 'too', 'close', 'comfort', 'scientists', 'radiation', 'altering', 'DNA', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'little', 'implausible.The', 'leader', 'new', 'band', 'heroes', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'a.k.a', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'who', 'can', 'stretch', 'bend', 'body', 'will', 'methodical', 'scientific', 'man', 'Richards', 'glacial', 'when', 'making', 'decisions', 'especially', 'romantic', 'ones', 'such', 'how', 'proceed', 'relationship', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'who', 'able', 'project', 'forcefields', 'obviously', 'become', 'invisible', 'Susan', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'now', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'wise-cracking', 'daredevil', 'who', 'can', 'spontaneously', 'combust', 'will', 'can', 'reason', 'fly', 'Finally', 'poor', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'who', 'was', 'most', 'exposed', 'radiation', 'who', 'orange', 'rock-like', 'Thing.What', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'rather', 'having', 'lone', 'wolf', 'superhero', 'Spider-Man', 'Batman', 'whole', 'group', 'interesting', 'character', 'dynamics', 'Similar', 'Disney', 'Incredibles', 'many', 'ways', 'even', 'down', 'most', 'superpowers', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'characters', 'relationships.This', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'having', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'ironic', 'considering', 'problem', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'actually', 'opposite', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'was', 'entertaining', 'different', 'Oh', 'sure', 'bad', 'guy', 'getting', 'award', 'cheesiest', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Name', 'history', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'played', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'backseat', 'larger', 'problem', 'how', 'people', 'must', 'learn', 'deal', 'newfound', 'abilities', 'fame', 'more', 'then', 'good', 'guy-bad', 'guy-fight', 'fact', 'particular', 'aspect', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'let', 'character', 'heroes', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'heart', 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'movie', 'one', 'done', 'honest', 'care', 'good', 'characters', 'good', 'humor', 'actual', 'drama', 'opposed', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects']",Fantastic Four
635763,A313FHXGRZNB68,B00005JNTU,"FateJacketX ""FJX""","[87, 122]","I can't remember the film, but I'd seen an old movie once about a screenwriter who was complaining about the way the studio treated his little script about kids playing ball in the park. Once it was written and sold, the piece was later turned into a war film, ruing any care, attention or real labor that the writer had put into an otherwise fetching story. To say that this is what could have happened to the Fantastic Four is just an assumption. But, somewhere along the line, between writing the script and casting the film, somebody who didn't know a damn thing about Marvel's finest hero group took control and warped it into one of the stupidest pieces of cinema this side of SuperGirl. Either they didn't know or they didn't care. Take your pick.When I heard who was cast as Ben Grimm, the Thing, I was really excited. I had never even once thought of Michael Chiklis, but there could not have been anyone better for the role. Hyped up, I learned about who would take the role of the Human Torch. Whatever, I'd never even heard of this kid. Then, Jessica Alba, and I said, ""Oh no."" Not as the....Invisible Woman??? How can it be worse!?! Then, it got worse with some guy who's name I couldn't even pronounce as Mr. Fantastic, with gray dye on his temples. Not even looking anywhere near the real age of Reed Richards, this guy meant doom. But not all by himself. No, the real doom would come from the smug actor, Something Whatisname, who would destroy the character of Dr. Doom forever. Not only did this guy look like he couldn't play Doom but he played him in a really stupid plot device. Here...Reed and his ilk want to go out into space for a science mission. I halfway believed him as a smart guy, but never are we made to believe that he is a genius. Victor Von Doom is the billionaire who finances the project and tags along - with Sue Storm as his girlfriend (!) and Johnny and Ben to tag along as pilots. Now, what is wrong with this story?FIRST: Reed and Doom were friends in college until Doom blew up his own face in a science mistake and blamed it on Reed, hating him forever. This was waaaaay before Reed even knew the Storms.SECOND: Johnny Storm was much younger in the comic book, at least by three or four years. AT LEAST. How he unbelievably managed to take the trip into space at that age, I will never know, so it's good that they fixed that part.THIRD: I don't think Sue was a scientist in the book - in fact, I'm positive of it. Either way, Jessica Alba, being a major hottie, gets away with her hotness when being in ANY movie. But she will never get away with playing a scientist.FOURTH: Doom never went into space with Reed and his ilk and he sure as heck wasn't dating Sue.FIFTH: Ben Grimm ROCKS! Can't diss that part.So, there. Before the film even starts, not only do they manage to smartly create a timely story about their origin which manages to incorporate Doom, but they DO IT BADLY AND STUPIDLY! Trying to crunch in the important themes was a good idea but it was left in the hands of bad, bad, bad storytellers. Doom ends up getting zapped in space with the rest of them and that's why he has armor? BECAUSE IT'S HIS SKIN? LAME!!!!I won't go into much more of my personal hatreds, but I will tell you that I despise the director, Tim Story of ""Barbershop"" fame. Not only is he not competent enough to take on a story like this one, but he doesn't know enough about it to care. With a name like his, I half expected at least a good visual ""story."" Instead, we seemed to get just a pile of smoking junk, as if he didn't know a good story if it bit him in the butt. Now, some directors just do what they do because it's payday or because they don't have the clout to flex any muscles. If he were Spielberg, he would probably have said, ""NO! TAKE THIS GARBAGE BACK AND LET WHEN KNOW WHEN YOU HIRE SOME REAL SCREENWRITERS!"" (this from the guy who made ""Jurassic Park"" - which only floated thanks to CGI. But CLOUT reigns supreme) But, Story is not Spielberg, he's the guy from ""Barbershop."" But the film just reeks of not even trying. If he was powerless and had to succumb to the studio's demands, I take it all back. The studio should have backed off, not him.Ben's latext skin was good, but it really should have been better with a little CGI touch-ups. There were times when I cringed at how obviously fake his orange suit was. Still, Chiklis handled the job really well, but the scene where Ben's wife leaves him was totally laughable. Still, not his fault. Furthermore, not that I'm hating, but I could have sworn that Ben's blind girlfriend in the comic book was white.Sue Storm and Reed Richards sucked almost as bad as Doctor Doom. Doom is a super-intimidating figure and it did not play out here well enough. He said some mean things, smacked some people around, but he was by no means the insane mastermind from paper pictures. Sue's powers looked super-cool but Reed's seemed a bit silly at times. But during the BIG FIGHT SCENE, I forgave a lot and just enjoyed myself. For a few minutes there, it was totally FANTASTIC FOUR material.The Human Torch could not have been better. Not how I imagined him, but he surpassed all my expectations and actually proved me wrong in some places. He is cocky and arrogant and, like Dash from THE INCREDIBLES, seemed to be the only one to relish the idea of having super powers. Nice change of pace, differing from Batman, Blade and Spiderman, who do what they have to do like it's a curse or a reason to be bummed out all the time.If I were to rate it from one to ten, I would give it a four. One because it's a superhero movie. Two, because Alba is hot. Three, because I loved Grimm and Johnny and their constant bickering. And four, because some of the effects, like the Human Torch's fire, were top notch. Keep one thing in mind though, after the ""Incredibles"" came out and everyone saw how cool a person with stretch powers could be, rumor has it that the FANTASTIC FOUR went back and shot ""better"" scenes of Reed stretching around. Still....no competition. Not even enough competition for a cartoon.",2,DEBACLE!,1120780800,"07 8, 2005",2005,6093,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'film', ""'d"", 'seen', 'old', 'movie', 'once', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'was',

Reed and Susan have no chemistry at all. Michael Chiklis comes close to bringing the Thing to life, but he is so bitter that it is not worth watching.

635767,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00005JNTU,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 0]","FANTASTIC 4When this film first came out there was a lot of high hopes for the film, and why not it is one of the most beloved comics of all time. There has been a lot said about this movie some being positive some negative, I think for the most part that both sides are right. This movie is flawed especially if you are a fan of the comic series but if you a casual viewer I see no reason why you would not like this film. I have been a fan of Marvel Comics since I was a little kid, and while this series was not my favorite I still read it. That is why I have mixed feelings about this movie, on one hand I am upset with how it turned out while on the other I enjoyed it.The story is all about five unlucky people who take a little trip into space to conduct an experiment, of course since this film is based on a comic you know that something goes wrong. After being hit with all kinds of nasty stuff [cosmic rays] the team wakes up a little later back on earth and everything seems fine, at first. But after a while Reed Richards starts to feel a little stretched, Suzanne Storm feels a little invisible, Johnny Storm begins to feel a little hot, Victor Von Doom feels electrified, and poor Ben Grimm feels a little solid. Of course all of you know what I am talking about with each character; four become fantastic while Doom becomes just that, doomed. It is these events that start to set in motion what should be one of the greatest show downs of all time, more on that later. Reluctantly Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch [not so reluctantly] and of course very reluctantly The Thing except who they have become and join up to become the Fantastic Four. That is really what the movie is all about, all of them coming to terms with what they have become. Torch and Doom are really the only ones that like what has happened to them, strangely for similar reasons.A lot of the fans of the comic have spoken out about this movie saying a whole lot of different things, different reasons why they dislike this movie. One reason and justly so is the fact that the film is not really true to the comic all that much, such as the character story lines like Doom was never with Sue that I can remember. Also weren't Reed and Doom friends in college and became enemies once an experiment went wrong and messed up Victor. There are also some other points to be made about storylines and such but you get the idea of what I am trying to say. Something else that is discussed a lot is the casting of the film, from what I can tell most people disagree with most of it. Ioan Gruffudd is cast as Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic and a lot of people disagree with this casting decision. It is true that Reed was a genius that was full of confidence and never really self doubting like he is in this film, that is true I can't really argue that point. Also Jessica Alba as Sue Storm aka Invisible Woman has had a lot of critics about her being cast in that role, once again rightful criticism since Sue was never that prissy and stuck up and love sick. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm aka Human Torch has had mixed reactions, people say that Torch was never that cocky but I disagree. He may not have been that cocky originally but I do remember this Torch from his guest appearances in the Spiderman comics, maybe not that cocky but pretty close and has far as entertainment purposes I think they went the right way. Michael Chiklis is really the only one that has had the most praise as Ben Grimm aka The Thing, and rightfully so as he portrays his character perfectly and fulfils a childhood dream by being in this film as The Thing. And of course our villain is played by Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom aka Dr. Doom, he has been plagued with criticism as well but I liked him as Doom.I really believe that all of the actors did great jobs for what they were given, I mean think about it they portrayed characters that were written for them and acted as directed. If there ever was any one to blame it would be director Tim Story and writers Mark Frost and Michael France. They seem to have wanted to make this film more about the characters and drama between them more important then a film about the action. I can understand that decision but they could have balanced both much better just look at the Spiderman films. Also people complain about how they changed the origins and story around, but like Stan Lee said the big screen is much different from the pages, and some times the film needs to be made different to reach a new audience. As a fan I can both understand this and except it but at the same time be upset by it. Still I don't like that the final battle between the Four and Doom is way to short and not as epic as it could have been. Still though Tim and the writers obviously had a certain vision they wanted to go with for the film and they followed through with it. And what you get is what you get take it or leave, am I overly excited by the finished product, no. But I do think that the film is worth a watch, maybe even a purchase.All the actors did great jobs with what they had written for them, Chris Evans really did a good job adding to his character. His fights with Michael Chiklis  are great entertainment and remind me of the comics, and I think Doom looked cool and Julian McMahon did a great job regardless of whether his character was written for the screen right. Michael Chiklis steals the show in my eyes; his portrayal is great and really heartfelt, that is how I would react if I was turned into that and lost my wife. Ioan Gruffudd is in the same vein as Julian McMahon in that he does a great job with a character that was not written right; same can be said for Alba who does a good job with her character [she is also super hot, really a beautiful woman]. The only thing is that she at times like in the action scenes kinda looks out of place, but that suit fits so right on her so I'll forgive that [sorry but that is the guy in me coming out].Tim, Mark, and Michael although they did not really stick to what the comic was did an ok job with this new version of the team. Sure I would prefer it a different way but the finished product is still kind of a fun movie, perfect for a lazy Saturday or something. Maybe it is because I am a fan of Marvel [Stan Lee cameos] and that they Ok'd it makes me forgive its short comings, or maybe it is just mindless fun that I think this film is ok. This film will never be my favorite movie or even favorite super hero movie but still it is not unwatchable. Whether you hate this film or not as a fan you should still support what you grew up loving, this is not a film just for the people who came to love the comics. This film at least what I think they were going for is a film that has enough of the old to please the old fans and enough new to reach a new audience. I think it worked kinda because the film made money, and as long as these films make money the more we will get to see them. Even if they are not done correctly I would still rather see these characters being created for new generations, which is really the only way the characters will live on.The DVD comes with a nice cast commentary with Chiklis, Gruffudd, and Alba; also included are a lot of great behind the scenes extras including a great documentary. Also on a side note, I actually like the first movie from the 90's that was produced by Roger Corman. I wish that would get a real release on DVD or something, the bootleg quality is not to great.",3,GOOD FOR WHAT IT IS,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,7517,"['FANTASTIC', '4When', 'film', 'first', 'came',

I have been a fan of Marvel comics for many years so I was looking forward to seeing this finally, but I have always heard the mixed reviews. Well, I wasn't disappointed and the Fantastic Four, even though the story was different from the comic, was still very fun to watch.Many jokes were really funny and the characters matched very well to their actors, even thought I think Mr. Fantastic looked like a Jeff Goldblum clone. The story was exciting and kept my attention the entire time. The special effects were excellent, and the costumes were as equally impressive. My only problem with the movie was that the stories weren't the same and I would have prefered if nothing was changed in the story line. By far, this isn't the worst comic book movie to be made, believe me, I have seen some stinkers. Overall, I would really recommend this mvoie to Marvel fans.

635770,A36JXQDWV08MSY,B00005JNTU,"Gary Gil ""Gary Gil""","[3, 5]","Stan Lee is a master storyteller. I attribute the current success of the Spider-Man franchise to the film's fidelity to ""Stan The Man's"" original story line. Spider-Man IS a great character because of the guilt over his uncle's death and the fact that he could have prevented that death. The special effects, great acting, and media-hype are just window dressing to the gem that is the story.I was thrilled at the prospect of The Fantastic Four getting the same treatment and sharing similar success. Unfortunately, the movie fell way flat of my expectations. The special effects were good, though not great. The acting is also good and Jessica Alba is as sexy as Chris Evans is hot. The plot is what made this film a stinker. Some Hollywood dope(s) came along and tried to improve upon Stan Lee's original story. First, it did not work. Second, it did not need improving.The heart of the Fantastic Four is family. Maybe they were trying to distance the film from The Incredibles, but The Fantastic Four did come first. Doctor Doom is the Fantastic Four's arch-rival. Doom hates Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) because Doom blames him for the college accident that disfigured him. Doom could not accept responsibility for his own mistake, and this defines the drama and conflict that makes the original story a classic. The problem is, this never happens in the movie. Five minutes devoted to this part of the original plot could have raised this film from 2 to 5 stars. The Fantastic Four never save anyone but themselves and Doom is evil only because he is a businessman with a bad attitude.In addition to these flaws, the DVD begins with mandatory trailers and the preview of X-3, advertised on the cover is less then three minutes long.The movie does have some redeeming moments. Michael Chiklis has the gloomy mood of the The Thing down pat. Chris Evans as The Human Torch, has some great one-liners, but most of them can be scene in the movies trailer.To all you Hollywood writers out there who sign on to work with these classics in the future, READ THE COMICS FIRST!!! You will find that most of your work is already done for you. The Fantastic Four is a comic tradition with amazing characters and well crafted plots and stories. It deserves better treatment then what this film provides. There is a sequel planned and I hope that the writers can deliver a better script then this.",2,Mediocre Four,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,2388,"['Stan', 'Lee', 'master', 'storyteller', 'attribute', 'current', 'success', 'Spider-Man', 'franchise', 'film', 'fidelity', 'Stan', 'Man', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'Spider-Man', 'great', 'character', 'guilt', 'uncle', 'death', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'death', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'acting', 'media-hype', 'are', 'just', 'window', 'dressing', 'gem', 'story.I', 'was', 'thrilled', 'prospect', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'getting', 'same', 'treatment', 'sharing', 'similar', 'success', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'fell', 'way', 'flat', 'expectations', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'acting', 'also', 'good', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'as', 'sexy', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'hot', 'plot', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'stinker', 'Hollywood', 'dope', 'came', 'along', 'tried', 'improve', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'original', 'story', 'First', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'Second', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'improving.The', 'heart', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'family', 'Maybe', 'were', 'trying', 'distance', 'film', 'Incredibles', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'did', 'come', 'first', 'Doctor', 'Doom', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'arch-rival', 'Doom', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Doom', 'college', 'accident', 'disfigured', 'Doom', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'own', 'mistake', 'drama', 'conflict', 'original', 'story', 'classic', 'problem', 'never', 'movie', 'Five', 'minutes', 'devoted', 'part', 'original', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'raised', 'film', '2', '5', 'stars', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'never', 'save', 'anyone', 'Doom', 'evil', 'only', 'businessman', 'bad', 'attitude.In', 'addition', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'mandatory', 'trailers', 'preview', 'X-3', 'advertised', 'cover', 'less', 'then', 'three', 'minutes', 'long.The', 'movie', 'have', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'gloomy', 'mood', 'Thing', 'down', 'pat', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Human', 'Torch', 'great', 'one-liners', 'most', 'can', 'be', 'scene', 'movies', 'trailer.To', 'Hollywood', 'writers', 'out', 'there', 'who', 'sign', 'work', 'classics', 'future', 'READ', 'THE', 'COMICS', 'FIRST', 'will', 'find', 'most', 'work', 'already', 'done', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'comic', 'tradition', 'amazing', 'characters', 'well', 'crafted', 'plots', 'stories', 'better', 'treatment', 'then', 'what', 'film', 'sequel', 'planned', 'hope', 'writers', 'can', 'deliver', 'better', 'script', 'then']",Fantastic Four

I don't know if it was their wonderful teamwork, or the fact that their individual flaws and personal conflicts made them seem more real, but whatever it was, I truly loved reading their comic books.When ""The Lord of the Rings"" were so vividly brought to the big screen by Peter Jackson, this was a childhood dream come true. Now, under the direction of Tim Story, the Fantastic Four movie has fulfilled another dream of mine.Clearly neither the Fantastic Four story, or the movie version, is anywhere in the league of The Lord of the Rings. And I must also say that the greatest of the recent stream of Marvel Comics-based movies that's been made so far is Spiderman 2. However, the Fantastic Four is a film that gives just the right take on these characters, giving us much fun and adventure without taking itself too seriously.The casting seems perfect. Coming in, I didn't know much about either Ioan Gruffudd (who plays Mr. Fantastic), or Chris Evans (who plays The Human Torch), but both expertly captured the nature of their characters. Chris Evans, in fact, with his daredevil playboy portrayal of Johnny Storm, is a major factor in the success of this movie. Michael Chiklis, of the Fox Network show ""The Shield"" is a wonderful Ben Grimm (The Thing), and Jessica Alba (Dark Angel, Sin City, Into the Blue), is just great to see in anything, but does an exceptional turn as Sue Storm. Casting Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck) as the arch-nemesis Victor von Doom was a stroke of genius, and I've been a huge fan of his since his days on the tv show ""Charmed"" as the conflicted half demon Cole. No one does the smoldering, ""evil-lurking-just-beneath-the-surface"" type better.As Michael Chiklis says in Jessica Alba's behind the scenes Video Diary (one of the extras on the DVD), it's hard when doing the first, or ""origin"" movie because you have to cover all of the backstory of the characters in an hour and a half film. And although I thought they pulled it off very well in this first movie in what I'm sure will result in at least one to two more, I'm very anxious for the sequel.

635774,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00005JNTU,Get What We Give,"[4, 5]","Say Fantastic Four to most people on the planet and they'll say, ""What? Who?""Say Batman and everyone nods.The Fantastic Four was the first comic that Marvel Comics produced in the early 1960's. It preceded Spiderman and the XMen. Even so, it has remained largely a comic fan's comic book, considered somewhat unaccessible by the public at large. Why? Well, I have my own thoughts, but I'm sure they're just my own. Suffice it to say, that the Fantastic Four (the comic of which has never been one I've been interested in) film stands up quite well when placed side by side against other comics to films.As with any such film, the absolute intent is for there to be more than one film. Why? Well, you've got to do a lot of suspension of disbelief as well as introduction of characters and their intentions and their psyche. If those aren't incorporated, you end up with a hollow film with no emotional center (remember Batman and Robin?).Marvel and their film production partners have wisely made the decision to ground all their comic films in modern reality. This means New York is New York and not Gotham City - some bizarro world alternate reality. To do so, means that the comic to film characters must become flesh and blood believable. In this film, Marvel has scored.Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic is sincere and extremely believable as a man on a mission but who tries to push his own feelings away. Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman is certainly sexy, but more importantly, Ms. Alba brings a nuanced confidence to the role that it needed. Michal Chiklas as The Thing could not be any finer. Thank heaven technology caught up to comics so that the Thing could be ""real"" and not CGI, so that Chiklas' acting comes through far more intensely than the costume he wears. Dr. Doom's backstory has been tweeked to make it more accessible and ""believable"" to the audience. Is it effective? You bet. I keep finding that Marvel's film developments often surpass the ""realities"" of their comic counterparts, making them more believable and reality based, while maintaining the fantasy aspects so necessary to the stories. And finally, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, the Human Torch. Wow! This could have really been screwed up. The Human Torch's popularity has surpassed that of the Fantastic Four, garnering him his own series of comics from time to time.  He's a smart alec and a cocky SOB. Initially, I understand, the producers were just going to have the character be able to shoot flames from his hands, thus making him truly a ""human torch"", but somewhere along the line, they kept the character as in the comics and he is fully ""on fire"". Evans and Chiklas steal the show with their character portrayals, and the script still lets their humanity come through.As with any introductory film, the script is forced to be overtly heavy in exposition and backstory. However, seeing that this film was a success, doubtless there will be a sequel, which should mean that it will be able to be nothing but a non-stop thrill ride.Even so, while often burdened with too much expostional material, in the long run this film needed it and it suceeds because of it.No, it's certainly not perfect, but I'll not fault the producers too much. The casting was perfect and the special effects were just dynamite. I'm looking forward to the next installment.",4,"As a Comic to Screen, This Film Is Worthy of Four Stars",1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3344,"['Say', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'most', 'people', 'planet', ""'ll"", 'say', 'What', 'Who', 'Say', 'Batman', 'everyone', 'nods.The', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'was', 'first', 'comic', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'produced', 'early', '1960', 'preceded', 'Spiderman', 'XMen', 'Even', 'so', 'remained', 'largely', 'comic', 'fan', 'comic', 'book', 'considered', 'somewhat', 'unaccessible', 'public', 'large', 'Why', 'Well', 'have', 'own', 'thoughts', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'re"", 'just', 'own', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'comic', 'never', 'been', 'one', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interested', 'film', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'when', 'placed', 'side', 'side', 'other', 'comics', 'films.As', 'such', 'film', 'absolute', 'intent', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'film', 'Why', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'got', 'do', 'lot', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'as', 'well', 'introduction', 'characters', 'intentions', 'psyche', 'are', ""n't"", 'incorporated', 'end', 'up', 'hollow', 'film', 'emotional', 'center', 'remember', 'Batman', 'Robin', '.Marvel', 'film', 'production', 'partners', 'have', 'wisely', 'made', 'decision', 'ground', 'comic', 'films', 'modern', 'reality', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'not', 'Gotham', 'City', 'bizarro', 'world', 'alternate', 'reality', 'do', 'so', 'comic', 'film', 'characters', 'must', 'become', 'flesh', 'blood', 'believable', 'film', 'Marvel', 'scored.Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'sincere', 'extremely', 'believable', 'man', 'mission', 'who', 'push', 'own', 'feelings', 'away', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'certainly', 'sexy', 'more', 'importantly', 'Ms.', 'Alba', 'nuanced', 'confidence', 'role', 'needed', 'Michal', 'Chiklas', 'Thing', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'finer', 'Thank', 'heaven', 'technology', 'caught', 'up', 'comics', 'Thing', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'not', 'CGI', 'Chiklas', 'acting', 'far', 'more', 'intensely', 'costume', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'backstory', 'been', 'tweeked', 'make', 'more', 'accessible', 'believable', 'audience', 'effective', 'bet', 'keep', 'finding', 'Marvel', 'film', 'developments', 'often', 'surpass', 'realities', 'comic', 'counterparts', 'making', 'more', 'believable', 'reality', 'based', 'maintaining', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'so', 'necessary', 'stories', 'finally', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Wow', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'screwed', 'up', 'Human', 'Torch', 'popularity', 'surpassed', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'garnering', 'own', 'series', 'comics', 'time', 'time', 'smart', 'alec', 'cocky', 'SOB', 'Initially', 'understand', 'producers', 'were', 'just', 'going', 'have', 'character', 'be', 'able', 'shoot', 'flames', 'hands', 'thus', 'making', 'truly', 'human', 'torch', 'somewhere', 'line', 'kept', 'character', 'comics', 'fully', 'fire', 'Evans', 'Chiklas', 'steal', 'show', 'character', 'portrayals', 'script', 'still', 'humanity', 'come', 'through.As', 'introductory', 'film', 'script', 'forced', 'be', 'overtly', 'heavy', 'exposition', 'backstory', 'However', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'success', 'doubtless', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'should', 'mean', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'nothing', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'ride.Even', 'so', 'often', 'burdened', 'too', 'much', 'expostional', 'material', 'long', 'run', 'film', 'needed', 'it.No', 'certainly', 'not', 'perfect', ""'ll"", 'not', 'fault', 'producers', 'too', 'much', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'just', 'dynamite', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'installment']",Fantastic Four

YEO ""gyeo""","[6, 6]","I missed the Fantastic Four, aka FF in the theatres and as any self-respecting Marvel comic fan, had to watch the DVD in spite of the mixed reviews I'd heard.The good news is: the movie is watchable.  It's not perfect, and I still rate the X-men and the Incredibles ahead of this.  The effects are well crafted, and much thought has been put into the visual approach.What else is good about this: Great casting of Von Doom (Julian McMahon of Nip/Tuck) and Chris Evans as the Human Torch.  Jessica Alba looks great too.What could have been better:  This entire film was more like an introduction to the Four rather than a complete movie experience.  Sometimes feels like a TV show.  Since a sequel is in the works, we'll just have to wait.Weak Chink for me: Mr Fantastic is pretty average.  And Dr Doom's origins are less compelling than the real comic book Dr Doom.As some reviews say above, the Fantastic Four isn't about characterisations, and yet, one feels that the chemistry of the four could've been tweaked up a notch instead of falling back purely on the comic book landscape / approach of simple characters.  After all, the Fantastic Four became ""the world's greatest comic"" simply BECAUSE the characterisations were complex and unique, and the characters each had strong identities.  This is ignored a bit in favour of an Irwin Allen ""Land of the Giants"" TV feel.  Meaning: these are not epic characters on the level of the X-men.Dr Doom's development was somewhat of a disappointment.  While I enjoyed how the new scriptwriters have incorporated him in a more contemporary and intelligent way - I wish that the original character could've been respected.  The mystery and dark foreboding of the original Dr Doom was on a level that inspired characters like Darth Vader.  Doom's comic book legacy deserved better.The Human Torch however, is excellent.  Never my favourite character, he nonetheless comes alive in every way in the film.

Turning invisible is a cool trick, but her super-power is clearly being smoking hot. I'd like to have seen alot more, and not less.

In many ways, this one moment sums up this film adaptation of the Marvel comic book...telling the audience that it is meant to be a simple popcorn flick and we might as well enjoy the ride.  Despite a couple rather questionable plot holes and uneven acting from its leads, the film for the most part succeeds in its rather unambitious mission.The film tells the story of how, with the help of the egotistical tycoon Victor Von Doom, scientist Reed Richards undergoes a mission of studying the effects of a cosmic storm cloud using one of Doom's space stations.  Along for the ride are pilot buddy Ben Grimm, lovely genetics expert Sue Storm (who is Doom's girlfriend and Reed's ex), and her hotshot brother Johnny.  Needless to say, in true comic book fashion, the storm overwhelms the space station and bathes all five passengers with radiation.  When they return to Earth, all five gain superhuman powers; one will become the villainous Dr. Doom, with the rest becoming the film's title super team.Directed by Tim Story, the film moves at good clip, and while there's not much in the ""slam-bang brawl"" or character development categories, it more than makes up for it in charming bits of humor especially with the fun by-play between Chris Evans' Johnny Storm/Human Torch and Michael Chiklis' grouchy Ben Grimm, who turns into the rocklike Thing.  Evans clearly is having a blast up there on the screen, while Chiklis does some solid work in portraying Grimm's frustration. Both actors make the most of their roles and easily are the standouts here.  Ioan Gruffudd is saddled with the thankless role of the rubbery Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic).  The character is pretty dry personality-wise, but Gruffudd does what he can.  The lovely Jessica Alba is no more believable as a genetic scientist than I am, but as ""Invisible Woman"" Sue Storm, she turns in a fair performance for the most part.  Julian McMahon's Dr. Doom doesn't get to do a whole lot but smirk and threaten a lot before appearing in the all-too-brief final battle.If the movie suffers from anything, it comes from the inevitable comparisons that it got next to such recently character-driven and critically acclaimed super hero films like BATMAN BEGINS, X-2, and SPIDER-MAN 2.  In the end, FANTASTIC FOUR is a charming film that might disappoint super hero fans who are looking for something deeper or heartfelt in their films.  But, if you're looking for a nice couple hours to waste....I would recommend that you be like the Human Torch; pop some popcorn and just enjoy the show.",3,FOUR not so FANTASTIC as filled with goofy charm,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,2710,"['one', 'point', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Human', 'Torch', 'down', 'front', 'TV', 'popping', 'pan', 'Jiffy', 'Pop', 'popcorn', 'one', 'hand', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'moment', 'up', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'telling', 'audience', 'meant', 'be', 'simple', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'couple', 'rather', 'questionable', 'plot', 'holes', 'uneven', 'acting', 'leads', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'rather', 'unambitious', 'mission.The', 'film', 'story', 'how', 'help', 'egotistical', 'tycoon', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'scientist', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'mission', 'studying', 'effects', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'cloud', 'using', 'one', 'Doom', 'space', 'stations', 'ride', 'are', 'pilot', 'buddy', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'lovely', 'genetics', 'expert', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'who', 'Doom', 'girlfriend', 'Reed', 'ex', 'hotshot', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Needless', 'say', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'fashion', 'storm', 'space', 'station', 'bathes', 'five', 'passengers', 'radiation', 'When', 'return', 'Earth', 'five', 'gain', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'one', 'will', 'become', 'villainous', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'rest', 'becoming', 'film', 'title', 'super', 'team.Directed', 'Tim', 'Story', 'film', 'moves', 'good', 'clip', 'not', 'much', 'slam-bang', 'brawl', 'character', 'development', 'categories', 'more', 'up', 'charming', 'bits', 'humor', 'especially', 'fun', 'by-play', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Johnny', 'Storm/Human', 'Torch', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'grouchy', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'who', 'rocklike', 'Thing', 'Evans', 'clearly', 'having', 'blast', 'up', 'there', 'screen', 'Chiklis', 'solid', 'work', 'portraying', 'Grimm', 'frustration', 'actors', 'make', 'most', 'roles', 'easily', 'are', 'standouts', 'here', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'saddled', 'thankless', 'role', 'rubbery', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'aka', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'character', 'pretty', 'dry', 'personality-wise', 'Gruffudd', 'what', 'can', 'lovely', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'more', 'believable', 'genetic', 'scientist', 'am', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'fair', 'performance', 'most', 'part', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'Dr.', 'Doom', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'smirk', 'threaten', 'lot', 'appearing', 'all-too-brief', 'final', 'battle.If', 'movie', 'suffers', 'anything', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'got', 'next', 'such', 'recently', 'character-driven', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'X-2', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'end', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'charming', 'film', 'might', 'disappoint', 'super', 'hero', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'deeper', 'heartfelt', 'films', ""'re"", 'looking', 'nice', 'couple', 'hours', 'waste', 'would', 'recommend', 'be', 'Human', 'Torch', 'popcorn', 'just', 'enjoy', 'show']",Fantastic Four

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[1, 1]","FIRST THOUGHTS: IT WASN'T THE X-MEN BUT IT WAS A FUN FILM TO WATCHAs a youngster during the 60s when the Marvel comic and TV animated series were running [Fantastic 4] I found this franchise to be the most interesting and compelling. When the X-Men were produced into two great feature films I was very hopeful as to the disposition of the promised Fantastic Four feature.IN A NUTSHELL: A FILM ABOUT COPING WITH CHANGE - STRESS & ESTRANGEMENTThe ""Fantastic Four"" feature film took the 'origins of the fantastic four' as the movie's theme. To this extent the film was competent, but nothing out of the ordinary, when compared to the recent X-Men and Spider Man releases. Nevertheless, this film is entertaining and does make sense, although it is not beneath pandering to young men via Jessica Alba's implicit nudity. It is mostly a film about people facing the stress and the estrangement that comes with major unexpected changes in themselves, and how others see and relate to them. This is most coherently portrayed by Ben Grim/'THE THING' [Michael Chiklis] who brings some much needed humanity to this piece in the form a small measure of a 'beauty and the beast' subplot. In essence, Ben Grim has turned into 'The Thing' and unlike the others he can not turn back - he is stuck in his superhero mode and basically feels apart from everything that was in his world, before the accident in Space. Only a blind woman can see that he is not a monster, and this could have been enlarged within the plot to good effect.THINGS TO MARVEL AT:The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge is easily the most amazing scene in the film. Ben Grim is on center stage as he confronts a would-be jumper as he ponders the same thoughts [jumping off the bridge]. With a little comedy and special effects, Ben Grim stops a huge truck cold, saves the jumper and creates a debacle on the bridge that ends with the recognition of the 'Fantastic 4' as group of superheros as a breaking headline story on the news.- * MAJOR ACTORS -

So i will split the review to  2 parts.Fantastic Four - Rise of the Silver Surfer [Blu-Ray].1) The moviei ended up watching this spectacle via .... (hey i don't ....... but in this case i had to since the BD+ situation caused me grief!)I was very much impressed to an extent about the silver surfer. I recall him being not too elaborate around the comics but i always enjoyed the character since SS strikes me as mysterious amongst all the classical characters in the series.  F4 historically had several interactions with other delights from Marvel over the decades such as Spidy, Hulk, and others.  So it was a nice choosing of having SS fly in.Now the movie carried nicely over to its 2nd installment. The characters seem more confident and sort of grew in this. The plot seemed more human than fantastic powers driven; which is very different from the usual.  Spiderman did well in 2 and messed it up in 3. Lets hope Fan4 does more sensible writing if they do extend the series.2) The Bluray medium:i was very much disappointed the handling of this format. Studios and manufactures need to fix this! Adoption rates of HD content is low as it is regardless of formats.  Bad publicity and news travel faster than anything and the consortium who built this standard better have learned from this experience. (please read this months PerfectVision article on [...]The studios should learn a few things from Apple when it comes to expanding market share. Apple does not penalize and lock-in the user to one license agreement to expand their 10% global market share from MS.

635792,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B00005JNTU,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[1, 1]","Warning- SPOILERS contained--Fantastic Four:  in the summer of 2005, Marvel Comics ""first family"" superhero team hit the silver screen, and despite mixed reviews (leaning toward the negative) it had a sizably profitable run at the box-office.  Just before its 2007 sequel, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" hits theaters, Fox Home Video has released a two-disc Extended Edition of the first film.  With a running time of approximately 110 minutes, previously excised footage has been spliced into the previous cut, effectively expanding the narrative.The film focuses on four astronaut protagonists:  brilliant (but absent-minded) physicist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd); the beautiful (and also brilliant) Susan Storm (Jessica Alba); Reed's former college roommate and Air Force pilot Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis); and Susan's younger, sarcastic pilot brother Johnny (Chris Evans).  As the movie opens, Richards has a proposition for an outer-space-based research project (something involving cosmic radiation's effect on living tissue), but so far all his pitches have been turned down.  His only remaining prospect is with Von Doom Industries, run by his former college rival, Victor Von Doom (who, aside from being a business magnate is something of a physicist himself).  Von Doom has a rep for being ethically dubious, but Reed's colleagues convince him it's worth a try.  Surprisingly, Victor accepts Reed's proposal--but only if he gets to go along for the space trip, and his company gets the patents for whatever useful gets discovered.In true comic book fashion, as the experiment begins to take place, something goes terribly wrong.  A literal storm of cosmic radiation comes bearing down on the quintet, and though in the aftermath, nothing seems to be wrong with them at first, fans of the comics will know that a metamorphosis is about to take place.  After setting down on terra firma, each member of the group begins to change in seemingly random ways:  the brainy Reed is now enabled to stretch and bend his body like rubber (Mr. Fantastic); the impulsive Johnny can set his body on fire with no ill-effect (the Human Torch); shy Susan turns invisible when she gets frustrated (Invisible Woman); burly Ben finds himself changed into a man of stone (the Thing).For his part, the calculating Victor finds his body slowly being infected with a `techno-organic' virus, effectively changing him to a cyborg, with energy-manipulating powers.  While all parties are duly alarmed at this change of fortune, Reed reluctantly galvanizes his quartet as celebrity superheroes; but Victor broods and casually commits murder in the name of finding a cure for his condition.  This sets in motion a series of events leading to the climax, in which Reed creates a device that can cure the morose Ben of his powers, but Doom sets his sights on using it to basically destroy the team.Pros:The actors all bear a good resemblance to their comic book counterparts, with the possible exception of Chiklis' Thing, who in the comics has oversized proportions comparable to the Incredible Hulk.  Here the Thing is much more human-sized, though the film does an impressive job with the makeup to simulate his rocky exterior.  The powers of all the characters are handled well with respect to their four-color origins (Mr. Fantastic can squeeze under doors; the Torch can fly; Invisible Woman can create force-fields; the Thing can uproot street lamps with ease).  The bickering-family interaction featured in the comics gets to be seen often as well.  The comic strip's co-creator Stan Lee cameos as a letter carrier.  The extended cut provides welcome character moments involving all of the primary characters; they include a dinner date with Susan and Victor, Ben having a night on the town with Alicia, and Johnny flaming out while showing off at a nightclub.Cons:The film is essentially an extended origin story.  Arguably the biggest plot hurdle to overcome in super-hero films, some of the genre have used abbreviated origins or simply bypassed them entirely, with varying results.  Here, the full origin tale barely works, if only because of the engaging actors, the capable special effects and stunt sequences.  McMahon as Dr. Doom is suitably creepy, but his motivations as a villain are given the short-shrift (comics purists reviled the updated origin, though in fairness it hewed close to the strip's sister publication Ultimate Fantastic Four).  The Internet-heavy complaints about the casting of African-American Kerry Washington in a bit role as the Thing's future girlfriend (and to an extent the multiethnic Alba's casting as WASP-ish Susan) can be chalked up to racial nitpicking.ExtrasThe three main documentaries are about the making of the film, about the history of the comic book, and about the career of Jack Kirby are very good additions.  Each of them is substantial in length.  The movie documentary interviews each core cast member as well as select members of the production crew, giving excellent insight on how the film was made.  The comic book documentary offers a decade-by-decade examination of the history of the Fantastic Four comics, interviewing various artists, writers and editors who worked on the series over the years.  It suffers from no interview footage of the late Jack Kirby--and strangely, there are no interviews with 1980's writer/artist John Byrne, whose work is only acknowledged with a dialogue-less montage.  Similarly, the Kirby bio has no archival interviews with `the King'.  The extras also include still photos and production drawings.",4,Great Revised Version of the Hit Action/Sci-Fi Film!,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,5580,"['Warning-', 'SPOILERS', 'contained',

635793,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B00005JNTU,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[2, 3]","Let me start with a brief review of the movie before I give my personal thoughts.  I realize those thoughts may or may not be helpful as far as reviewing this project, and if they aren't, they then aren't meant for you.  They're meant for those who are interested in what I'm thinking.If you like comic book movies with plenty of action and some thought (not unlike the X-Men series, though not as deep), you will enjoy this movie as I did.  It may lack in plot originality, but it makes up for that with enjoyable and likable protagonists.This movie is one that lives and dies with heroes you enjoy rooting for, a villain (or more) who you love to detest, and special effects that help you believe the unbelievable.  This movie succeeds on all three counts.  Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba are engaging in their roles, and Chris Evans' Tiggerish Johnny Storm plays great with Michael Chiklis as The Thing a.k.a. Eeyore.  Julian McMahon is chilling as Doctor Doom.  (I think it helps that the actors are not household names.)  And the special effects are fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, and fantastic (note my little attempt at humor here?).Kerry Washington's casting as Alicia Masters is ingenious.  True, she does not resemble the comic book character physically, but neither do the rest of the cast (e.g. the original Johnny Storm is blonde, unlike Evans; the original Ben Grimm has hair, unlike Chiklis).  Having a black Alicia dating a white (okay, orange) Ben Grimm/Thing points out that what matters is not appearance but what is inside the person.Finally, what about the kiddos?  I didn't notice any bad language (which the latter X-Men movies slipped into), and the violence was comic bookish.  There was no sex, though they managed to show some of Jessica Alba's skin in a couple of scenes.  As I say with all movies and TV shows, parents need to accompany their children if seeing this, but I think children past the age of, let's say seven, can handle this with parental presence and feedback.This concludes my review of the movie per se.  Allow me to give some thoughts.  If you want to vote on whether this is helpful, please base it on the above, not on the below.  Also, if you don't want to spoil the movie, please stop reading the review at this point, because I will be spoiling some of the story from this point on.As stated, this movie lacks some originality.  It may be that it borrowed from other sources, or it could be that the similarities between other movies are unintentional.  One example is the similarity between the villainization of Victor Von Doom here and Norman Osborn in the Spiderman movie (though from what I know, the Fantastic Four is more original, without borrowing from the comic books for the climax as Spiderman did).  Also, for those who can remember 24 years back to Superman II, the humanization and back of Ben Grimm may remind you of Superman becoming human and regaining his powers.  Other movie similarities include the pigeon leaving his mark on Ben Grimm and the dog leaving his mark on Dan Ackroyd's Winthrop in ""Trading Places"" or Johnny Storm taking out the heatseeking missles with similar strategies in ""X2"" and ""Blue Thunder"".  This may be laziness and quasi-plagarism (though to plagarize from many sources can also be called research), or this may be either an unconscious copying or thinking of something not knowing it's been done before.It's obvious there will be a sequel -- in fact, I saw the preview today on a program I taped earlier this week.  I was trying to guess which villain would be next, or if they would bring back Doom.  My guesses of possible new villains were the Puppet Master, the Sub-Mariner, the Frightful Four (introducing the Inhumans, including Johnny's girlfriend Crystal) and the shape changing Skrull.  I forgot all about Galactacus and the Silver Surfer.Let me now move to lessons learned from this movie.  This movie focuses on related subjects of teamwork and friendship.  Also, as a preacher, I can see the devilish side of Dr. Doom.  I'm speaking specifically of how he deceives Ben Grimm and makes a rift between him and Reed Richards.  The devil does the same thing to divide Christians, for the purpose of achieving his goal, which includes the destruction of the individual Christian, easier to do when they are isolated from their fellow believers.",5,"Yes, It Has Weaknesses, But Not Enough To Prevent This From Being Thoroughly Enjoyable",1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,4353,"['Let', 'start', 'brief', 'review', 'movie', 'give', 'personal', 'thoughts', 'realize', 'thoughts', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'helpful', 'as', 'far', 'reviewing', 'project', 'are', ""n't"", 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', ""'re"", 'meant', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'what', ""'m"", 'thinking.If', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'plenty', 'action', 'thought', 'not', 'X-Men', 'series', 'though', 'not', 'deep', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did', 'may', 'lack', 'plot', 'originality', 'up', 'enjoyable', 'likable', 'protagonists.This', 'movie', 'one', 'heroes', 'enjoy', 'rooting', 'villain', 'more', 'who', 'love', 'detest', 'special', 'effects', 'help', 'believe', 'unbelievable', 'movie', 'three', 'counts', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'are', 'engaging', 'roles', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Tiggerish', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'great', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Thing', 'a.k.a', 'Eeyore', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'chilling', 'Doctor', 'Doom', 'think', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'household', 'names', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'fantastic', 'fantastic', 'fantastic', 'note', 'little', 'attempt', 'humor', 'here', '.Kerry', 'Washington', 'casting', 'Alicia', 'Masters', 'ingenious', 'True', 'not', 'resemble', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'physically', 'do', 'rest', 'cast', 'e.g', 'original', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'blonde', 'Evans', 'original', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'hair', 'Chiklis', 'Having', 'black', 'Alicia', 'dating', 'white', 'okay', 'orange', 'Ben', 'Grimm/Thing', 'out', 'what', 'matters', 'not', 'appearance', 'what', 'person.Finally', 'what', 'kiddos', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'bad', 'language', 'latter', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'slipped', 'violence', 'was', 'comic', 'bookish', 'was', 'sex', 'managed', 'show', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'skin', 'couple', 'scenes', 'say', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'parents', 'need', 'accompany', 'children', 'seeing', 'think', 'children', 'age', 'let', 'say', 'seven', 'can', 'handle', 'parental', 'presence', 'feedback.This', 'concludes', 'review', 'movie', 'se', 'Allow', 'give', 'thoughts', 'want', 'vote', 'helpful', 'please', 'base', 'above', 'not', 'below', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'movie', 'please', 'stop', 'reading', 'review', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'spoiling', 'story', 'point', 'on.As', 'stated', 'movie', 'originality', 'may', 'be', 'borrowed', 'other', 'sources', 'could', 'be', 'similarities', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'unintentional', 'One', 'example', 'similarity', 'villainization', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'here', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'Spiderman', 'movie', 'what', 'know', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'more', 'original', 'borrowing', 'comic', 'books', 'climax', 'Spiderman', 'did', 'Also', 'who', 'can', 'remember', '24', 'years', 'back', 'Superman', 'II', 'humanization', 'back', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'may', 'remind', 'Superman', 'becoming', 'human', 'regaining', 'powers', 'Other', 'movie', 'similarities', 'include', 'pigeon', 'leaving', 'mark', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'dog', 'leaving', 'mark', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'Winthrop', 'Trading', 'Places', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'taking', 'out', 'heatseeking', 'missles', 'similar', 'strategies', 'X2', 'Blue', 'Thunder', 'may', 'be', 'laziness', 'quasi-plagarism', 'plagarize', 'many', 'sources', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'called', 'research', 'may', 'be', 'unconscious', 'copying', 'thinking', 'something', 'not', 'knowing', 'been', 'done', 'before.It', 'obvious', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'fact', 'saw', 'preview', 'today', 'program', 'taped', 'earlier', 'week', 'was', 'trying', 'guess', 'villain', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'would', 'bring', 'back', 'Doom', 'guesses', 'possible', 'new', 'villains', 'were', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'Sub-Mariner', 'Frightful', 'Four', 'introducing', 'Inhumans', 'including', 'Johnny', 'girlfriend', 'Crystal', 'shape', 'changing', 'Skrull', 'forgot', 'Galactacus', 'Silver', 'Surfer.Let', 'now', 'move', 'lessons', 'learned', 'movie', 'movie', 'related', 'subjects', 'teamwork', 'friendship', 'Also', 'preacher', 'can', 'see', 'devilish', 'side', 'Dr.', 'Doom', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'specifically', 'how', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'rift', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'devil', 'same', 'thing', 'divide', 'Christians', 'purpose', 'achieving', 'goal', 'destruction', 'individual', 'Christian', 'easier', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'isolated', 'fellow', 'believers']",Fantastic Four
635794,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B00005JNTU,Isaac,"[1, 2]","""Holy anal leakage, Batman!"" -- what Robin would say about ""Fantastic Four""That may be a reference to the wrong movie in question, but after seeing this pukebucket excuse of a movie, a shot-by-shot remake of the 1966 ""Batman"" doesn't sound like that bad of an idea. Nearly fifty years after the Fatastic...sorry...Fantastic Four made their debut on the Marvel comics, filmmakers have stapled together what has to be the lamest and most pathetic superhero movie in history. Come to think of it, you can't really call ""Fantastic Four"" a superhero movie. The movie has failed to convince me that these four are superheroes.Something you need to consider is the exaggeration by the MPAA with the word ""intense"" right in the middle of the organization's reasoning. I can understand that they are probably rating this movie with the awareness that little kids can only take so much, but get a load of this. According to the MPAA web site, ""Spider-Man 2"" is rated PG-13 for ""stylized action violence."" If this movie is by any means more intense than ""Spider-Man 2,"" then Bugs Bunny should run for president. ""Fantastic Four"" is about as intense as its own lunchbox marketing advertisements.I should be ashamed for even mentioning ""Spider-Man 2"" while discussing this movie. With Spider-Man and Batman you at least have heroes with semi-serious origins. Peter Parker was bitten by a genetically mutated spider. Exaggeration, but you can buy it. Bruce Wayne witnessed the murder of his parents. Arguably the most plausible superhero origin ever. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), siblings Sue (Jessica Alba) and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), and Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) receive their superpowers when they are sent into space to investigate a mysterious star storm that is lingering near Earth. You would think that NASA would be more concerned as to whether or not the storm is heading towards us.Study the last names of the film's main charcters and I'll give you fifty points if you guess who the villain is. Reed Richards is Mr. Fantastic, able to stretch his body to immeasurable lengths; Sue Storm is Invisible Woman, who is, well, invisible but is inexplicably able to generate force fields; Johnny Storm is The Human Torch, able to ignite his body at will and also fly at the same time; Ben Grimm is The Thing, a massive, hulking piece of granite that appears to have been vandalized with orange paint.While his associates dwell in celebrety status, Victor Von Doom, who funded the space mission with billions of dollars, wades in misery. His company is crumbling and his four best friends are sucking up all of the positive attention from the media. Due to the star storm's effects, Doom's entire biophysical structure is in the process of being replaced with titanium alloy, and he becomes able to generate electricity. Also, the internal transformation leads to facial disfigurement, and he resorts to wearing an iron mask. He officially ""becomes"" Dr. Doom with fifteen minutes left in the movie when he finally stops moaning about the success of the Fantastic Four and gets on with destroying them. He even lets us know how many of the four he has taken care of and how many there are left.Before the climax there is only one small part that can qualify as an action sequence, and that is a rescue mission by the Fantastic Four on a bridge. This gives them their fame and their names. Wow, and are we supposed to care if a fire truck is about to fall over the bridge and The Thing is trying to pull it to safety?That the first and final showdown between the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom is exciting doesn't mean that the film has an ounce of value. We all know that superheroes struggle with balancing their everyday lives with their alter egos, but why would you waste your time with a movie in which the superheroes are intent on getting rid of their powers? At least Spider-Man realized that ""with great power comes great responsibility."" The Fantastic Four are a bunch of whiners. They argue and come close to destroying each other before Dr. Doom can actually become a threat.There are no acceptable performances in Tim Story's film. There are only cardboard cut-outs of wise-cracking superheroes engulfed in cheesy special effects.

The characters are easy to relate to: I'm most like Reed, who likes to thouroghly research anything before taking a chance and gets so caught up in work that you push people away, Some people love change and love to show it off and bask in it like Johnny, There are a lot of people who find that their strength is brought on by emotions and they have to act on them, like Sue, and most people go through what Ben went through with changing, you lose somebody you love, or you hate the way you look and just want to disappear, you're misunderstood and judged by what's on the outside. Then you've got a rare few that go crazy and exact revenge like Dr. Doom, but to me he just seemed like a megalomaniac who couldn't take being rejected.  Oh well, that made for some exciting action scenes though.  So it's not Oscar material, big deal!  Rent this on a date night, it's perfect!

635799,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B00005JNTU,James Duckett,"[0, 0]","By far, the most impressive thing about the Fantastic Four is the special effects. This is a movie that could not look this good a decade ago. The Fantastic Four has always been placed on hold for being made of a movie because any attempt to make The Thing or Flame would have been laughable. The Flame, I thought, needed a bit more work but The Thing was awesome and totally realistic.The Thing, played by Michael Chiklis, also carried the heart of the movie. You see through his eyes how gaining superpowers isn't always the easiest thing in life. You can easily understand the problems he has adapting to his new abilities as he is chosen to decide living a life being different to help other or living the old life he had before where he was basically like everybody else. His motivations throughout the movie were the easiest to follow.His best friend, Reed Richards (played by Ioan Gruffudd), I wish had more screentime. There were really only a couple of scenes where you saw his new-found power put to work. But the stretching looked realistic whenever he got to do it.The real entertainment of the show came from Johnny Storm (Chris Evans). He was just a real fun and charismatic character to watch on screen and is the only person who really provided any comedy relief.My biggest disappointment in the show was Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon). I just did not get his character. I didn't understand his motivation at all except that he apparently just wanted to do bad things. Why? Well, that is never fully explained. Or explained at all. He just seems upset with some of the things life handed him and decides he needs to start killing people. He gains nothing from it, but insists on doing it anyways. Marvel has done such a great job with the likes of Spiderman and X-Men in showing the motivation of ""bad evil doers"", I'm surprised to see them make Dr. Doom.I also loved the uniforms of the Fantastic Four. They weren't really that far away from the comic book, except the four on their uniforms was updated (and shrunk a little bit). It gave them a more modern, less baseball jersey look. I was a big fan of the comic but I didn't complain about the costume changes.I found the movie entertaining and well worth watching. I hope a sequel is in the works!The DVD extra features were okay, including the standard couple of deleted scenes and behind the scene look at things.

Britton ""Defilord""","[6, 9]","At first,I didn't have high expectations going in (Tim Story is known for comedies like the amusing Barbershop and the god awful Taxi Movies)But as one who was raised on Marvel comics and more importantly a huge admirer of Jack ""King"" Kirby's incredible artwork and designs, i just had to see this latest incarnation of Marvel's very first comic.First off,I loathed the 1994 Roger Corman adaptation which was so bad that it never even made it straight to video. (But the Punisher and Captain  America did?!?) This recent take on the Ff was much better with four completley different personas and dilemnas,most notably the tragic Ben Grimm portrayed by Shiled's Micheal Chicklis who struggles to adapt to his life post transformation,while hoping for a cure.On the other hand, Chris Evans was on point as the Cocky hot headed Johnny Storm who more than accepts his abilities and superpowers while trying to achieve instant stardom.I didn't particularly care for Ian Grofford's Reed Richards, in the comics Reed was a little more stoic while still retaining that super intellect. Instead we have an insecure egghead who relied on Victor Von Doom's financing for this cosmic exploration project.Jessica Alba wasn't as bad as many have seem to think, her performance was OK, nothing more. Now this new Dr. Doom comes off a bit like some arrogant enterpenuer like Donald Trump, hence the cheesy line; :Sue, your'e fired""! It's a good flick which couldv'e been a lil' better.to compare it to other comic flicks like X2 or Spiderman 2 would be very unfair. the FF stood on it's own merit and the comedy relief worked well for what it was.Pros:""Convincing"" movie counterparts accompanied by fun performances courtesy of Chiklis and Evans,who IMO carried the movie.Decent FX especially the Human Torch that pays homage to Kirby's comic counterpart.The Thing makeup wasn't as bad as i thought either there was no need for CGI copouts as Chiklis mananged to portray Ben Grimm pefectly.The posthumous Jack Kirby finally gets acknowledged!!(see the Movie's ending credits)Funny dialogue(When asked if Mr. Fantrastic can stretch any part of his anatomy,Johnny replies; ""i wouldn't know, but i think he may be limp"") and good direction.well Timmy, you didn't really let me down as i have thought.Cons: Dr. Doom's powers and looks..Is he  Electro or even the silver surfer's distant cousin?!?Not enough battle scenes during the movie, where's Doom's security force or even his robots?predictible ending..does this mean an upcoming sequel?Maybe so, because as of this writting, The Fantastic Four has helped to recover the Box Office slump with a $53 Million take. Note to Hollywood: stop the chessy remakes like bewitched and thesilly  Dukes of Hazzard.instead Make yours Marvel!Marvel has saved hollywood's @$$ more than once and it all started with the first Blade movie, the first Marvel movie that has achieved success. ergo inspired Marvel/Arad to greenlight the Xmen Movie and afterwards Spiderman and so forth.

635802,A1JN0XW2EH4JQY,B00005JNTU,J. Corsi,"[2, 4]","I was thinking real hard before writing this review. Honestly I've only read a few comics that have the Fantastic Four in them and besides knowing the basics, I knew very little about them. I mean I knew thier names and powers, but never really knew thier origin, which i'm told that this movie screws that up. Then again, most movies change origins all the time, take Batman for example, i think every movie had a different origin of Batman which is so simple, how can anyone elaborate so much into it and make it so different? U watched this movie and honestly, its a good movie and all, the problem i see its a rushed movie. You can tell by watching it that they develop on thier powers and how to use them but it wraps up too quick at the end. I agree with the one reviewer who says that the bridge wreck scene is longer than the actual final battle with Doom. I mean was the battle with Doom more than 5 minutes? If this movie was say, half and hour to an hour longer, it would be perfect. It would have the origins and be perfectly set up for experts of FF and for the novice who know little about them as I do. It was just rushed at the end as yes Von Doom wants to get revenge on Reed for taking the girl and losing his fortune, but it came along too quickly and the end battle was just that, way too fast. Hopefully if a sequal is made, they will have more action in it (can't be a comic book movie without action in it) since now they won't have to worry about chatacter development as it will already be there.

635803,A3C94LV082BV2T,B00005JNTU,"J. Davis ""Just a guy.""","[4, 5]","This is an extended e-mail that I sent to a friend who was considering purchasing the DVD...When the movie was released a couple of years ago, I went to go see it on opening weekend. Despite the film's weak plot and misinterpretations of the characters that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created so long ago, it was fun and action-packed.I bought the DVD when it was released, and later found an earlier draft of the script online.When I heard that it was getting an extended cut (after being surprised by findingSpider-Man 2.1at a local Wal-Mart), I considered buying it, and eventually did.I haven't watched the movie with the deleted scenes back in, but I did see the new scenes on the ""Deleted/Extended Scenes"" special feature.The disc has both the original theatrical version (as released in the US, it says) and the extended version. Judging from disc space required, how they pulled it off (no double-sided disc), is that the only full cut of the movie that is really on there is the theatrical version. When you play the extended version, it will automatically jump in between the movie and the deleted scenes. This is fine, except sometimes the music gets messed up (though I didn't note any problems here) and, on some, you can't use subtitles, which doesn't help when you can't have surround sound so as not to offend the neighbors. Also, the branching causes a three-second pause each time it jumps inbetween the two bits of footage on the player I use, and will likely do so on some other players, too.One problem is is that it looks they put back ALL of the deleted scenes! Cool? Yes, except for that scene where Sue makes Reed take a break and they go to a bridge? In an earlier version of the script, it was going to be in a planetarium, and this scene is put into the movie... HOWEVER, so is another scene that is an alternate version of the bridge scene, where instead of elongating his chin when he says, ""I figured that's what you always wanted... a stronger man,"" he does a weird morph into Wolverine! (Both of these were among the few deleted scenes on the DVD's original release.)I was glad to see more footage building the characters of Ben and Johnny after they get their powers. (These scenes were in the earlier draft of the script that I read.) I especially like the scene in Alicia's sculptor's shop where Ben notices the puppets and asks about them. She tells him they were made by her step father. In the comics (44 Years of the Fantastic Four Collector's Edition Win/Mac [DVD]), Alicia's father is the Puppet Master. However, considering that the movies are having the Fantastic Four battle cosmic-powered beings, I'm not expecting him to pop up soon.The extended cut, I guess, is an overall improvement over the theatrical version.Other than audio commentaries, only one of which is available for the extended version, the first disc only has an ""Inside Look"" feature about the sequel, which also contains the teaser trailer, instead of the full trailer.Disc 2 has three documentaries about the comics. (Woot!) Except for ""From Comic Book to Film,"" they are all interesting. ""From Comic Book toFilm"" only shows panels from the comics matched up to clips from the movie, which sometimes only barely resemble each other.""The World's Greatest Comic Magazine"" is an informative documentary about the comic book series, covering the creation and how the series has progressed over the years.There is also a documentary about Jack Kirby, the original ""Fantastic Four"" artist, that seems to be well-researched and documented, but I haven't finished watching it.There are stills and galleries, and two features about the movie, one of which I'd seen before and already had on DVD: ""Heroes are Born: The Making of...,"" Wal-Mart sold it as an exclusive special disc in a two-pack with the original DVD.""Heroes Are Born"" is not an extreme in-depth documentary. Rather, it covers the leading five actors and the special effects used to create their characters.""The Baxter Building: Declassified"" doesn't let you know very much. It practically tells you what the Baxter Building is and some of it's design for the film.If you, to some extent, liked the movie, you should like the extended edition.And, since I'm reviewing a Fantastic Four product, allow me to reccomend the alternate dramatic Fantastic Four series:Fantastic Four - The Complete Animated Seriesfrom 1994. For some reason, people say these '90s animated series got the characters better than the new movies.There was also a 1994 ashcan film, and a 1960s cartoon series, but these are not officially on DVD.This extended DVD is worth the buy, especially as it has a $8.50 gift certificate for a ticket to see the sequel, coming out exactly one week from now!",4,Somewhat More Fantastic Than

Pouliot,"[5, 6]","For once, we are given a comic book adaptation that doesn't ruin the superheroes to make a quick buck.""The Fantastic Four"" is smart, funny and has terrific effects. The plot is plausible enough to move the story along. An unlikely group fids itself in space to study a mysterious solar phenomenon and finds itself irradiated and physically altered. The group's scientist becomes elastic. His friend and bodyguard turns into a hideous man of stone. A brother and sister duo respectively become human fireball and invisible. The billionaire who sent them into space is turning into an electro-metallic madman.Sounds farfetched, but the cast keeps the tone light with wisecracks and visual humor. The film also does a nice job of dealing with the group's various reactions to their new powers - embarrassment, wonder, horror and amusement. The effects are terrific. Chris Evans (as human torch Johnny Storm) goes snowboarding with a girlfriend, catches on fire inadvertently, goes careening and melts a tunnel through the snow that he turns into a hot tub for his date. The Thing (Michal Chiklis) alternates between ripping off truck doors (to save a trapped trucker) and apologizing for scaring people. He is the true emotional center of the movie, which is saying something, as he was covered many inches thick in foam and makeup to pay the role.The DVD extras are few, with a handful of deleted scenes showing alternatives to the sentimental denouement between two characters.

Victor, who owns a billion-dollar company, agrees to finance the mission and accompany Reed and his crew on their journey.  Their destination is a space station, where they will conduct their experiments.  However, a strange gaseous cloud is moving toward the station.  Originally given hours to conduct their experiment, the cloud suddenly increases its speed and is on top of the station in a matter of minutes.  All five members are exposed to cosmic radiation from the cloud.Upon returning to earth, everything seems normal for a while.  However, each person begins to notice physical changes; Johnny begins finding that he can make a flame by snapping his thumb, Sue realizes that she can disappear, Reed finds that his body can now stretch in ways it never could before, but Ben's new ""ability"" is most noticable.  He now looks like a giant orange rock-like figure.  He even frightens his beloved wife Debbie away.  Victor, who's company stock has went into free-fall due to the failed mission, has been given one week to turn his company around by his investors.  He also begins to show signs of change.The group's first public exposure occurs on the Brooklyn Bridge.  Ben is sitting on its railing when a would-be suicide jumper approaches.  Ben tries to talk to the man, but it only frustrates the jumper more.  Soon, the man is hanging onto a cable above the roadway, but eventually loses his grip and falls into oncoming traffic.  This starts a chain-reaction collision.  Ben, meanwhile, is trying to get through the mess of wrecked vehicles when a fire truck slams on its brakes and sends its rear section flying over the edge of the bridge.  Using his now incredible strength, he manages to pull the truck back to safety, while Reed uses his elactic arms to rescue a falling firefighter.  After this show of bravery, the local media give the group the name ""Fantastic 4"".Meanwhile, Victor is still seething over the loss of his company.  He blames Reed for messing up the mission.  Even Sue, Victor's girlfriend and Reed's ex, has apparently went back to Reed. As time passes, Victor becomes obsessed with gaining revenge against the Fantastic 4 and his former investors who have betrayed him.  His powers continue to get stronger, and his body is beginning to turn metallic in color.Reed has begun work on a machine that will reverse the effects of the cosmic cloud and restore everyone's DNA back to normal.  However, he is encountering problems, and Ben is losing his patience.  Using Ben's weakness as a possible way to get back at the Fantastic 4, Victor tells Ben that he has already completed his own machine.  Intrigued, Ben allows Victor to try to reverse his effects. Will Victor's machine work?  Will Victor destroy the Fantastic 4?I thought this was a great movie.  The story is well conceived and the plot is great.  Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Julian McMahon are terrific in their roles, and the special effects are out of this world.

Not only is it a good cast but one filled with fresh faces. Each person also brings an impressive resume to the movie. Jessica Alba is really coming into her own with this movie as well as having a starring role in this year's earlier hit, ""Sin City"". Chris Evans is also an up and comer having appeared in last year's flick, ""Cellular"" Ioan Gruffudd from ""Titanic"" and the ""Horatio Hornblower"" series and Julian McMahon from TV's ""Nip/Tuck."" Michael Chiklis is also a seasoned actor and has gained exposure as well as an Emmy for his work on ""The Shield"". The character development is wonderful you get to see these people move from ordinary people into excepting their role as superheros. Everyone did a great job with this they actually struggle with it unlike most superhero movies. Its really the part that saved the movie for me.The pace and the plot in general are also good. The plot is not overly technical or complicated and carries a nice blend of action and comedy, especially a shaving cr&egrave;me incident between Johnny Storm and the Thing. The pace of the movie rarely allows for a dull moment. It keeps your attention from the moment it begins till the credits roll up.Longtime comic book fans, and viewers who can't relax and go with the flow, may absolutely hate this movie, and honestly I sometimes couldn't tell if I was laughing with it or at it. But considering this is a story that involves rubber-faced heroes, cosmic waves and bad guys with names such as ""Victor Von Doom,"" it's probably best spun as a comedy.

See Penguin in Batman Returns for an awesome example of reinvention. As for changing a character's history just to cop out to a plot by plot Hollywood formula? Now we're talking stink. Next, I have no problem with trying something different and lightening the tone of a superhero movie. But please don't do it to such a point that it reaches the level of a sub-standard TV sitcom.

Sure, the plot has at least one gaping logic hole, they screwed up Dr. Doom, and the $100 million must have recirculated right back into the Fox execs pockets since it sure didn't go into the visuals, which were not much above television level, but the film had a good heart and was fairly true to the spirit of the comic. For whatever reason the makers just weren't bold enough to go all the way and chose a baby step, like they did with the first X-Men movie. We can validly criticize the choice of actors (Johnny Storm too old and too ""hunky,"" Sue Storm too young and not ""pretty"" like Naomi Watts) all we want, but I think they did their best to fill the roles they were assigned, and now they are part of the iconography. I'll buy the DVD when it comes out. For the most part this did look like a FF comic come to life. And it had a good heart. There was a lot more of Stretcho than I expected, though not enough of Reed the whiz inventor. The invisibility/force and Torch effects were spot-on. And the Thing performance was heart-rending, though the Thing costume did look like a grade-school science project.

635815,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00005JNTU,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[4, 5]","I was gonna listen to the bad reviews and not see this movie. That would've been a big mistake though. Ebert gave it one star and called the 5 main characters idiots for what they attempt in outta space. Well scientists are always  planning on doing something far fetched in movies that don't make sense. Here it just sets up for them to get their powers. Plus Ebert loved Batman Begins and just way way too hard on this movie because he thinks people should see that instead. Well Batman already made a lot of money. Now is Fantastic Four's turn. I've known people who said Batman Begins was boring. I loved it but this movie is more fun and has a lot more humor. I don't think people will be disapointed in it after seeing Batman at all. Yes that is what a Batman  movie should be like and Fanastic Four is...what a Fantastic Four movie should be like.I've seen cartoon shows and this is exactly what it was like. So yes the whole lets go in space and do this and that is a flat idea. From what I know though, it came straight from the comics. It doesn't hold the movie back though. It's still a great comic adaption and a stronger one than Eleckra, Daredevil, Punisher and The Hulk. It has it's silly moments but still they don't take away from how enjoyable this movie is. I thought the cast does a fine job making their characters work.Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur) fairs well as Reed Richards who gets stretching powers. Each power they get fits their personality. He's a dreamer and always reaching for the stars so that's why he got that ability. Jessica Alba (SinCity) as Susan Storm does ok too as Richards' former g/f who feels invisable compared to his love for science. So she gets invisable powers. Chris Evans (Cellular) as Johny Storm is hilarious as a young pilot hotshot with a flaming ego. So he gets powers where he literly goes on fire. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) steals the show as well as Ben Grimm. He's Reed's bestfriend and protector. So since he's seen as being like a rock, he turns into a big rock guy. He loses his wife due to how he looks now. Plus the whole world stares at him. So he has the most trouble accepting his new powers since unlike the others he can't turn them on and off.Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck, Charmed) plays Victor Von Doom who funded their mission to space. He also is on the ship and gets some powes as well. His start turning him steal and give him powers to shoot electric bolts. Like Johny Storm, he embraces his powers the most. Storm though just wants to show them off. Victor though wants to use them to kill whoever pisses him off and to rule. McMahon plays him well too and does a fine job  crossing over from tv to film. Although Doom is supposed to have an accent. Oh well, not McMahon's fault he was mis-casted.  Still he makes the best of the part.When I saw that the movie was getting bad reviews I figured it was due to Tim Story's direction. He also did that dud Taxi. However I think he handles the action and everything fine. So I think one star is very very hard on this film. It's tons of fun with funny one-liners, especially from Chris Evans. Plus when the four of them don't get along and usee their powers against each other, it's just great fun. Especially when Grimm gets mad at Johny Storm for nick naming him the Thing in front of millions of people. When those two exchange words or get ready to fight, it's just good stuff. Chiklis really is the Thing and pulls off the part fantastic!Should this movie be dismissed with one star ? Hell no! I think it's just as entertaining as the Spiderman movies.  So take a chance like me and go see it. Expect something awful and you're gonna have a blast. I like it because it has it's own style. Who says a comic movie has to be overly serious like DareDevil the Hulk or the Punisher . This movie has more of a cartoonish style and what is so terrible about that. I think that is what makes it a good adaption to the comic. So what if it's aimed for kids, aren't they the ones who read comics ? Plus the effects are not that bad like Ebert & Roeper said. When Reed stretches around The Thing to calm him down, I think that  looked great and just how it should look.  Don't listen to Ebert & Roeper, they think people should just rush to see documentaries about migrating birds.

Some reviewers approach this movie seriously as if it is a metaphor for something important. It's a good (not great) action movie with a sense of humor. Lighten up & be entertained.Briefly, something goes wrong in space. The five principals are over exposed to radiation causing them to mutate. Each aquires a super power. The villian, Victor von Doom (really) is turning into metal & aquiring magnetic powers. Jessica Alba, is Susan Storm can become invisible & create a force field. Reed, is the leader, a genius & has aquired extreme flexibility, i.e. ""rubber man"". He's in love with Susan & is basically a dork. Michael Chiklis is Ben, ""the thing"" is really built, has super-human strength & a wry sense of humor. Johnny Storm is Susan's younger brother & enjoys being the  ""human torch"" & learning how to fly. He is horny & juvenile. On that note, I don't agree with the PG-13 rating. This is a kid movie. Jessica strips down to her skivvies once but that is actually funny not erotic. She has to take her clothes off because they do not become invisible. You don't see anything else because she is ah... invisible. Reed works in a lab to return them back to normal. Von Doom doesn't cooperate, as he enjoys his power & being a freak. So the good guys fight him & have adventures in New York City. They defeat him but don't kill him. He is merely neutralized to reappear, in the sequel of course.

635822,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00005JNTU,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 1]","***This review may contain spoilers.***Although I am a reasonably avid Fantastic Four fan, I continually procrastinated in attending a theater viewing because of the negatively vehement disappointment ""professional"" critics and mere mortals have been heaping on it. However,  I finally plucked up enough resolve to go see it. The verdict? My trepidation was basically groundless.The ""Fantastic Four"" (hereafter FF) possesses and displays most of the ingredients for an engrossing ""superhero"" motion picture: involving story, appealing and sympathetic characters, lavish and largely convincing special effects and set-pieces, an appropriately sinister and amoral antagonist, a complex but nimble plot, and refreshing humor. No, it is not a brooding, tortured, haunted movie in the overwrought ""Batman"" mode.  The FF doesn't roll that way. Apparently Tim Story decided to adhere to the spirit and tone of the original 60's manifestation of the comic book: an exploration of the ultimate nuclear family. The FF's predominant theme is not the power/responsibility inter-dynamic(like Spiderman), or a psychotic obsession with vengeful crimefighting (like Batman). Instead, FF engagingly unites ""Lilo and Stitch""'s and Sister Sledge's themes of ""We are family, where nobody gets left behind.""Furthermore, despite its light approach, FF is actually a sensible movie. If cosmic storm energy reconfigured your DNA, you wouldn't (or shouldn't) go running off immediately to fight crime. As our colorful quartet, and even Victor von Doom (aka Dr. Doom) wisely do, they medically analyze their new conditions and powers to see if any potentially harmful side effects may occur. For example, even the brash and impulsive Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) observes, and I paraphrase, ""Ben seems to be the only one who can't turn his power on and off. What if that happens to us?"" Of course, such introspection can be taken to an extreme, as the pensive Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic) (Ioan Gruffudd) fully demonstrates in the movie, as he quarantines his partners and himself in a desperate attempt to reverse the storm's effects. But such cerebral caution characterizes Reed. Anyway, the FF movie provides counterpoint to the foursome's seclusion with Johnny's impetuous and successful desire to ""bust out"" and enjoy his incendiary new powers.The FF movie also plausibly and poignantly details the anguish, frustration, and shocked despair Benjamin Jacob Grimm (aka Thing)(Michael Chiklis) endures. If you found yourself imprisoned in a granite exoskeleton, wouldn't you do what Ben does - literally break out of the hospital facility, conceal your identity, and cautiously attempt to reconnect with your fianc&eacute;e? Wouldn't you swim in sullen self-pity? Ben does these things, but unlike most of us, who would probably go on an insane rampage or attempt to commit suicide, he possesses enough resiliency (Mr. Fantastic isn't the only one) and nobility to try to come to grips with his grotesque fate, even using a little grim (no pun intended) humor to cope. The saving of the bridge jumper's, the trucker's and the New York fire department's lives help illuminate this ""brute""'s soul of gold. Victor's unhinged horror at his own parallel titanium transformation further reflects positively on Ben's tenacity and courage. Chiklis embraces the Thing's character and owns it. A movie with him alone would still definitely be the price of admission.Admittedly, the FF does deviate from realistic behavior. For example, I would agree that Susan Storm (aka the Invisible Woman) (Jessica Alba) is not a conventional idea of a genetic scientist, but she is no flighty bimbo either. She is an alluring but sweet, shy, and caring individual. As another example, the New York public warm up to the super-powered quartet a little too rapidly and unambiguously. After all, shouldn't they be a bit disturbed at the Brooklyn bridge accident, even if it was accidental? Maybe Ben's rescue of the FDNY firefighters (symbols of 9/11 heroism) helped sway public opinion. Finally, Ben's erstwhile fianc&eacute;, I don't think, would be so callous as to unceremoniously leave his engagement ring on the bridge after his heroic act. If she really cared for Ben, wouldn't she more discreetly mail it back to him. Finally (spoiler here), how did Ben Grimm, after requiring Victor's electrical boost in the simulation chamber to revert to normal, find the same power in Victor's absence to transform back to the Thing in a -yes- self-sacrificing act to help his friends? It seems a bit too abrupt.Yet, as my summary indicates, abruptness, as I see it, is the FF movie's only true weakness. The movie is a bit too breezy at times. For example, Ben's encounter with the blind but discerning Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) could have been developed more at length. Ditto with Reed and Sue's reconciliation. Victor's Anankin-like descent to brooding, Darth Vader-like evil needed a bit more room to grow. Both the bridge sequence and the climactic battle against Doom were a bit truncated. Nevertheless, these are minor criticisms.The FF is solidly rousing, accessible, uplifting entertainment.  In some ways, the movie compares to the original 1978 movie ""Superman"", which, as you recall, also had its share of adapting to stark social and superpower changes, goofy action sequences, wholesome humor, and broad, cartoonish villains. FF remains faithful to its origins while simultaneously blazing its own comic cinema trail. It has successfully introduced its inimitable clan to the movie world.Now, in the comic, the FF is not only concerned with family, but also with galactic cosmic concerns, a la Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Watchers, the Skrulls, et al. The FF sequels, and I hope there are a few, should address some of these universal themes. ""The Trial of Galactus"" storyline would be ideal, and perhaps satisfy the pretentiously persnickety critics who complain that comic themes are too superficial. If FF can correct its ""shortness"" problem in subsequent films, it should dramatically prove those critics wrong.As Stan Lee (mailman Willie Lumpkin in the movie) would say:Excelsior!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S.:  I guess somebody listened to my suggestion.  The FF sequel introduces the Silver Surfer and Galactus.  However, to me the sequel was a precipitous disappointment.  But that is for another review.",4,"""Fantastic Four""'s Only True Shortcoming is - Shortness",1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,6384,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'am',

Because there are so many, they have the extra burden of putting something original out there for us.

That takes time and grace. The problem here is that there were five people who were changed (including the villain), so that's five psyches that we need to get into. We're only allowed entry into one: Ben Grim. And the only reason he's upset is because he looks like, well, a ""thing"".We do get a glimpse at Johnny Storm, The Human Torch. He's deeeee-lighted by the changes, and a bit too happy-go-lucky.I was impressed by some of the minute attention to detail.

The characters are nothing like their comic book forebearers and were updated simply for modern action fan appeal.  In the original Reed had confidence in all he did (not so in the current movie) likewise, Johnny was, in the otiginal, a  typical post high school ""kid"", not a pleasure seeking smartass (as in the current), Sue, originally, was the ""innocent little girl"" type instead of the current, confident businesswoman.

635827,A25CQTB313XDWO,B00005JNTU,"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland""","[128, 181]","It is amazing the level of sarcasm that has been generated among critics concerning Marvel's latest action hero movie Fantastic Four. Among the comments are ""more like mediocre"" or ""cheesy enough to clog one's arteries"". After seeing the movie, myself, I have to say that these annotations are childish, unfounded, and rather aloof.Fantastic Four was a great movie that centered around a development storyline of the beloved Marvel Comics superheroes Mr. Fantastic, The Thing, The Invisible Woman, and The Human Torch, as well as that of the noted adversary Victor von Doom, aka Dr. Doom. There were those who might have been looking for more fighting scenes, but again, the characters were those who obtained powers that were by and large in their unprocessed stages.I will not get into all the details about how those powers were gained from radiation exposure, because I feel that in terms of this vein of discourse, they are not necessary. What I think is important are the series of transitions that inflected the lives of the main players. As newfound abilities were acquired, so were additional, interpersonal dynamics that revolved around the characters. Among the conflicting subject matters throughout were individuality versus team reliability, beauty within versus beauty without, and impersonal logic versus passion.Though the Fantastic Four is a superhero teamup, the movie script nicely picked apart the traits and personalities that separated one member from the other. A careful introspection makes the viewer realize that just as those individualities were strengthened, so was the need to combine them for the purpose of dealing with societal threats. In other words, for the audience to better know the Fantastic Four as a whole, they had to look at the sum of its important parts and beyond.If a person contemplates the themes of the movie just at the surface level and does not explore what treasures might lie within, he or she, at best, might regard it as merely all-around fun, which I think is well-intended but amiss.To seriously compare Fantastic Four with Batman Begins or Spider-Man in terms of intensity or excitability is really a futile waste of time. What does separate Fantastic Four from those other movies is not that the attainment of extraordinary powers can change a person's mode of existence but that four separate personalities, albeit egos, had to find ways to adjust and fuse together those attitudes and unique, advanced capabilities to form the right stuff known as The Fantastic Four.Though there are negatives along with the positives that arise in virtually every situation, Fantastic Four, nonetheless, did manage to end on a good, high note. If there is an underlying message from this movie, it is that if people are not content with the constants in their lives, then there is always that glimmer of hope that meaningful change will occur so long as one wants it badly enough.",4,TRIPPING THE  LASERLIGHTS FANTASTIC,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,2930,"['amazing', 'level', 'sarcasm', 'been', 'generated', 'critics', 'concerning', 'Marvel', 'latest', 'action', 'hero', 'movie', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'comments', 'are', 'more', 'mediocre', 'cheesy', 'enough', 'clog', 'one', 'arteries', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'annotations', 'are', 'childish', 'unfounded', 'rather', 'aloof.Fantastic', 'Four', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'centered', 'development', 'storyline', 'beloved', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Thing', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'Human', 'Torch', 'as', 'well', 'noted', 'adversary', 'Victor', 'von', 'Doom', 'aka', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'were', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'more', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'again', 'characters', 'were', 'who', 'obtained', 'powers', 'were', 'large', 'unprocessed', 'stages.I', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'details', 'how', 'powers', 'were', 'gained', 'radiation', 'exposure', 'feel', 'terms', 'vein', 'discourse', 'are', 'not', 'necessary', 'What', 'think', 'important', 'are', 'series', 'transitions', 'inflected', 'lives', 'main', 'players', 'newfound', 'abilities', 'were', 'acquired', 'so', 'were', 'additional', 'interpersonal', 'dynamics', 'revolved', 'characters', 'conflicting', 'subject', 'matters', 'were', 'individuality', 'versus', 'team', 'reliability', 'beauty', 'versus', 'beauty', 'impersonal', 'logic', 'versus', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'superhero', 'teamup', 'movie', 'script', 'nicely', 'picked', 'traits', 'personalities', 'separated', 'one', 'member', 'other', 'careful', 'introspection', 'viewer', 'realize', 'just', 'individualities', 'were', 'strengthened', 'so', 'was', 'need', 'combine', 'purpose', 'dealing', 'societal', 'threats', 'other', 'words', 'audience', 'better', 'know', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'whole', 'had', 'look', 'sum', 'important', 'parts', 'beyond.If', 'person', 'themes', 'movie', 'just', 'surface', 'level', 'not', 'explore', 'what', 'treasures', 'might', 'lie', 'best', 'might', 'regard', 'merely', 'all-around', 'fun', 'think', 'well-intended', 'seriously', 'compare', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Spider-Man', 'terms', 'intensity', 'excitability', 'really', 'futile', 'waste', 'time', 'What', 'separate', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'attainment', 'extraordinary', 'powers', 'can', 'change', 'person', 'mode', 'existence', 'four', 'separate', 'personalities', 'egos', 'had', 'find', 'ways', 'adjust', 'fuse', 'together', 'attitudes', 'unique', 'advanced', 'capabilities', 'form', 'right', 'stuff', 'known', 'Fantastic', 'Four.Though', 'are', 'negatives', 'positives', 'arise', 'virtually', 'situation', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'nonetheless', 'did', 'manage', 'end', 'good', 'high', 'note', 'underlying', 'message', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'content', 'constants', 'lives', 'then', 'always', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'meaningful', 'change', 'will', 'occur', 'so', 'long', 'one', 'badly', 'enough']",Fantastic Four

Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) turns into this stone thing that is only called The Thing, he has the ability to smash through things. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) all the sudden can stretch out all of his body parts. The last friend Victor Von Doom(Julian Mcmahon) is slowly turning into metal and is also slowly turning evil. After word gets out that there are a bunch of people with superpowers walking around New York City, The Press instantly jumps on them and wants to know more about them. Von Doom is getting angry that The Fantastic Four is taking away attention from his company and he goes out of his way to become Dr. Doom and end The Fantastic Four. another motivation behind that is that Sue had pitched nerdy Reed over him. So, he becomes mor and more intent to end all of the Fantastic Four's lives. at first, The Fantastic Four don't gel together. There is a constant grudge match between The Thing and Johnny. Also, there is some serious tension between Sue and Reed. Also, The Thing is hating being the the Thing because his wife left him and people stare at him and call him a monster. The Fantastic Four then fights Doom because he had become more powerful after taking all the power away from the Thing, and They have to do something about it or Doom will rule the city!This film was seriously mediocre. They could've found a better director than Tim Story. He directed Taxi, for god's sake. Also, this film had the cheesiness of a B movie, and some of the effects were horrid. They did stay faithful to the comic books but I felt that some parts were skewered by Tim Story and the writers.I recommend this movie if you can handle cheesiness or semi-cool effects. I don't recommend this to any fans because I feel that they will be angry at what has been done, and I was sure angry too.

They're just interesting and fun to see.Technically, this new cut looks and plays fine.  If seamless branching is employed to add the extra scenes when the extended cut option is selected (both the theatrical cut and the extended cut are offered here), the result is indeed seamless.

First our heroes have to come to grips with their powers as they try to find a way to return to normal.

Was I entertained?Answer is 'bearly', there where times while watching the DVD that i wanted to turn it off... the reason I didnt turn it off was because i wanted to see if it would get much worse or any better (my curiosity got the best of me).Overall I can watch numerous pictures for special effects, however i do expect some kind of corherent story that's not bombarded with blantent advertising.The characters where one dementional, bland (or over zealous) and predictible.The story was forced (understandibly to fit it all in, if that was the case) but the main story was side tracked by lot's of sub-plots which didnt really add to picture as a whole and could have been left out or replaced. Not of mention the TONS of holes in the story that i usually over look if the action film is good enough.The special effects - pretty good they seemed to take there time using the effects however some effects looked 'cartoony' and some looked more natural. I understand that this film came from a comic so the 'cartoony' effets like (Mr. Fantastic's streatching arm under the door) seem to fit, its just gets me when they try to jump back and forth between the 'realistic' ones and the 'cartoony' ones.Sound - probably the saving grace of this movie and which allows me to even give it one star.

While a blind guy wearing a cherry red leather outfit might work on the panels of a comic book it looks silly on screen. (Not that this excuses the horrible Daredevil movie mind you) Mr. Fantastic (The stretching guy) of the Fantastic Four suffers this same fate. When he stretches it looks either disgusting (hand squeezing under the crack beneath a door) or quite silly (every other time he stretches.) Not that the character is helped by Ioan Gruffud's somnolent performance. He makes up one third of the most sleep inducing love triangle ever filmed.The lady in question is the Jessica Alba who looks fantastic in and out of her costume (She turns invisible when naked sorry guys. But some dutiful frame by frame DVD action will surprise the patient) but she expresses no emotion about either man (Or for that matter having superpowers. But I guess looking like Jessica Alba is kind of a superpower in itself).The third part is our pseudo villain Dr. Doom. (I say pseudo because he turns villain sometime around the closing credits in the most truncated villain performance in the history of superhero films) Dr. Doom as written for the comics is the perfect screen super villain. Which begs the question why he is barely in this movie and more importantly why he is a metrosexual evil businessman (Forced to be evil because his IPO went down in price and the bank is pulling out? This shows a remarkable lack of knowledge how IPO's work) When Alba tells Gruffud she never slept with Doom we have to believe her. I have a hard time believing these saccharine characters go the bathroom let alone have sex.The other two members of the four (Evans and Chiklis) give competent if one note performances.

635835,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JNTU,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[7, 9]","When the comic book movie craze officially hit with the release of blockbusters such as, ""Spiderman"", ""X-Men"", and their hugely successful sequels, many comic book fans were left wondering when will Marvel's first superhero team, the Fantastic 4, make it to the big screen.  Since at the time DC Comics had not released ""Batman Begins"", Marvel Comics was the only comics' distributor releasing movies, so of course their characters were the primary focus of fans.  Many began to worry with the poor performance (in movie critic's minds, that is) of ""Hulk"", ""Daredevil"", and ""Elektra"", would comic book movies continue to be made or would the superhero genre die out once again.  Luckily, the genre has not died, despite movie critic's most desperate wishes, and in 2005 Marvel's 'First Family of Heroes' were given the big screen treatment they deserved, and audiences were treated to a more tongue-in-cheek comic book movie, that still delivered the goods in terms of storytelling and quality.""Fantastic 4"" is essentially the origins for this team of reluctant heroes.  Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his best friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) are attempting to persuade the extremely rich industrialist, Victor Von Doom, to fund an expedition into space to study a cosmic anomaly that is nearing Earth's orbit.  Von Doom agrees with the proviso that he and his lovely assistant/girlfriend, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), along with her hot-headed brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) are allowed to join them on their voyage into space.  Though the expedition begins pleasantly enough, except for Johnny's practical jokes on Ben, things quickly turn awry as the cosmic anomaly reaches Von Doom's space station sooner than expected and all 5 members of the expedition are bombarded with cosmic rays.  Upon their return to Earth everything appears to be normal, but then everyone begins experiencing changes in their bodies, and new powers developing.  Each member exhibits different powers, Reed has the power of elasticity, Sue gains invisibility, Johnny can control fire, and Ben becomes hard as rock.  These four out of the five member team try to learn more about the source of their new powers and possibly find a cure for them.  Meanwhile, Victor Von Doom, whose skin is slowly becoming a metallic alloy, and also has the ability to shoot electricity from his hands, is becoming increasingly distrubed and blames Reed for causing his current condition.  However, instead of finding a cure, he embraces his anger along with his power and turns on the society that has begun to shun him.  Now Reed, Ben, Sue, and Johnny must decide whether to rid themselves of their powers or join forces to battle their onetime comrade and protect humanity from his evil.Though not nearly as serious as ""Spiderman"" or ""X-Men"" or any of the other Marvel Comics' movies for that matter, ""Fantastic 4"" still gives an engaging story that can be both serious and humorous.  The casting is terrific, all of the actors perfectly embody their comic book counterparts, especially Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis.  These two actors excellently capture the constant bickering/bullying between the Human Torch and the Thing, while at the same time showing their underlying loyalty and willingness to sacrifice for one another if the need arose.  The special effects work is terrific, and it was nice to see the Thing not be computer generated like the Hulk was.  Though critics tore this movie apart and tried to convince the public it was not and could never be a big success, the box office numbers provided by fans and general movie audiences proved otherwise.If you enjoyed ""Spiderman"" or ""X-Men"" or any of the other comic book movies, or are just a fan of sci-fi/action movies with good storytelling, then ""Fantastic 4"" is a movie you should see.  However, do not watch this movie expecting to see the same level of drama as ""Spiderman"" and ""X-Men"" had, this movie is much lighter in tone, while still delivering a good story with plenty of drama mixed in.""Fantastic 4"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.",4,Prepare For the Fantastic...,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,4116,"['When', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'craze', 'officially', 'hit', 'release', 'blockbusters', 'such', 'Spiderman', 'X-Men', 'hugely', 'successful', 'sequels', 'many', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'were', 'left', 'wondering', 'when', 'will', 'Marvel', 'first', 'superhero', 'team', 'Fantastic', '4', 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'time', 'DC', 'Comics', 'had', 'not', 'released', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'was', 'only', 'comics', 'distributor', 'releasing', 'movies', 'course', 'characters', 'were', 'primary', 'focus', 'fans', 'Many', 'began', 'worry', 'poor', 'performance', 'movie', 'critic', 'minds', 'Hulk', 'Daredevil', 'Elektra', 'would', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'continue', 'be', 'made', 'would', 'superhero', 'genre', 'out', 'once', 'again', 'Luckily', 'genre', 'not', 'died', 'movie', 'critic', 'most', 'desperate', 'wishes', '2005', 'Marvel', ""'First"", 'Family', 'Heroes', 'were', 'given', 'big', 'screen', 'treatment', 'deserved', 'audiences', 'were', 'treated', 'more', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'still', 'delivered', 'goods', 'terms', 'storytelling', 'quality', 'Fantastic', '4', 'essentially', 'origins', 'team', 'reluctant', 'heroes', 'Dr.', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'best', 'friend', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'are', 'attempting', 'persuade', 'extremely', 'rich', 'industrialist', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'fund', 'expedition', 'space', 'study', 'cosmic', 'anomaly', 'nearing', 'Earth', 'orbit', 'Von', 'Doom', 'proviso', 'lovely', 'assistant/girlfriend', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'hot-headed', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'are', 'allowed', 'join', 'voyage', 'space', 'expedition', 'pleasantly', 'enough', 'Johnny', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Ben', 'things', 'quickly', 'turn', 'awry', 'cosmic', 'anomaly', 'Von', 'Doom', 'space', 'station', 'sooner', 'expected', '5', 'members', 'expedition', 'are', 'bombarded', 'cosmic', 'rays', 'return', 'Earth', 'everything', 'be', 'normal', 'then', 'everyone', 'experiencing', 'changes', 'bodies', 'new', 'powers', 'developing', 'member', 'different', 'powers', 'Reed', 'power', 'elasticity', 'Sue', 'gains', 'invisibility', 'Johnny', 'can', 'control', 'fire', 'Ben', 'becomes', 'hard', 'rock', 'four', 'five', 'member', 'team', 'try', 'learn', 'more', 'source', 'new', 'powers', 'possibly', 'find', 'cure', 'Meanwhile', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'skin', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'metallic', 'alloy', 'also', 'ability', 'shoot', 'electricity', 'hands', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'distrubed', 'blames', 'Reed', 'causing', 'current', 'condition', 'However', 'instead', 'finding', 'cure', 'anger', 'power', 'society', 'begun', 'shun', 'Now', 'Reed', 'Ben', 'Sue', 'Johnny', 'must', 'decide', 'rid', 'powers', 'join', 'forces', 'battle', 'onetime', 'comrade', 'protect', 'humanity', 'evil.Though', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'serious', 'Spiderman', 'X-Men', 'other', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'movies', 'matter', 'Fantastic', '4', 'still', 'engaging', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'serious', 'humorous', 'casting', 'terrific', 'actors', 'perfectly', 'embody', 'comic', 'book', 'counterparts', 'especially', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'two', 'actors', 'excellently', 'capture', 'constant', 'bickering/bullying', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Thing', 'same', 'time', 'showing', 'underlying', 'loyalty', 'willingness', 'sacrifice', 'one', 'need', 'arose', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'terrific', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Thing', 'not', 'be', 'computer', 'generated', 'Hulk', 'was', 'critics', 'tore', 'movie', 'apart', 'tried', 'convince', 'public', 'was', 'not', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'big', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'numbers', 'provided', 'fans', 'general', 'movie', 'audiences', 'proved', 'enjoyed', 'Spiderman', 'X-Men', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'fan', 'sci-fi/action', 'movies', 'good', 'storytelling', 'then', 'Fantastic', '4', 'movie', 'should', 'see', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'expecting', 'see', 'same', 'level', 'drama', 'Spiderman', 'X-Men', 'had', 'movie', 'much', 'lighter', 'tone', 'still', 'delivering', 'good', 'story', 'plenty', 'drama', 'mixed', 'Fantastic', '4', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'language', 'brief', 'sensuality']",Fantastic Four

However, I found this to be an enjoyable, entertaining little film - quite a surprise actually.  Most comic-book heroes brought to cinema tend to have an extremely dark side - requiring a secret identity and so forth.  Not so here - no secret identities, no traumatic events as children or any of that stuff.  (I suppose you *could* call the event that made them into the Fantastic Four 'traumatic' but I didn't see it as such.)A well-cast film - I especially enjoyed Chris Evans as the irrepressible Johnny Storm/Human Torch (girls call him ""Torch"") who is totally in his element at almost 4,000 degrees (not to mention the fact that even without the flames, the man is HOT)!  Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/the Thing brings both pathos and humor to the role - I especially enjoyed his rapport with the teasing Johnny Storm.  Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd - rounded out the Four perfectly.  And Von Doom was played with the right amount of ruthlessness, cunning, and greed by Julian McMahon - although I was surprised that they didn't melt him into little horseshoes at the end of the film.

You can semi-forgive the retconning of Dr. Doom as Ultimate Doom.  Moreover, the scriptwriters made him another run-of-the Hollywood-Script-Mill evil businessman (OsCorp, LexCorp, now DoomCorp), instead of the satanic genius and materialist magician that C. S. Lewis Spoke about (Screwtape Letters).  And you almost cannot forgive the lack of the over-the-top action and suspense that makes a movie worth seeing.This films main problem is that the plot is one of destruction, specifically the self-destruction of the Fantastic Four.  We spend 106 minutes watching the Fantastic For try and figure out a way to undo the miracle that gave them powers.Essentially, this is a snuff film-the FF want to commit suicide!As Campbell points out, each hero goes through a ""Refusal of the Call,"" and eventually snaps out of it and follows through with the quest.  The FF spend the entire film refusing the Call, and finally cross the threshold in the last 15 minutes.  This worked for Unbreakable, but the film is more psychological, serous, and minimalist.We expect Ben Grimm (marvelously played by Chiklis) to refuse the call, since he is so hideous, and Johnny Storm is the only one who finds the powers empowering, but he is such an airhead, it is meaningless.  Reed and Sue mainly focus on their relationship, and odd posing for the camera.What makes Ben Grimm so likeable is that he is the only one who comes to really comes to terms with his powers, and fully accepts the calling as a hero.So how to improve for FF2? First, get in touch with Dooms' Satanic side. Have him undergo some jackball Latvarian-Transylvanian rite that restores him to life.Second-the heroes have come to terms with their powers.  Now explore their powers.  The Thing and Alicia Masters need to be taken to the next level; Johnny should get fed up with being  a flaming gigolo, and begin with Reed and Sue's wedding.Keep the lighthearted humor (the plastic surgeon joke was classic), and the inside jokes (Franklin Richards is Reed's firstborn).

635843,A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,B00005JNTU,Kenneth V. Cockrel,"[4, 6]","Don't believe a lot of the negative hype about this movie.  While some longtime comic book fans are griping that this is not the Fantastic Four they know and love, the movie skillfully captures the essence of the characters who launched the current generation of Marvel superheroes back in the 1960s.Granted the FF may not be the household names that the X-Men or Spiderman have become but those characters wouldn't be what they are today if Reed Richards and company hadn't paved the way.Most of the criticism I've heard from longtime fans of the comic centers on the tweaking of the characters' origins.  Yes, the film does take major liberties with the origins of the FF and particularly their nemesis, Doctor Doom.  But given the huge amount of time that has passed since the first issue of Fantastic Four hit newstands in the early 1960s and today the changes make sense.After all, as originally presented way back in Fantastic Four #1 Reed Richards, Sue and Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm were desperate to get into space(where they would face the cosmic ray bombardment that gave them their powers) in order to beat a competing Russian space launch.  This may have played well during the Cold-War era 60s.  But in 2005, more than a decade after the Berlin Wall has fallen and when Space Shuttle launches are commonplace, such a premise now sounds about as fresh as 50-year-old bread.The other complaint I've heard is about the major revisions to the origin of Doctor Doom.  Here Victor Von Doom isn't the armored monarch of fictional Eastern-European nation, Latveria.  He's actually the owner of the mega corporation that funds Richards' launch to an orbiting platform where the cosmic ray storm will be studied.  Furthermore, he actually accompanies the four on the mission later gaining powers of his own.Changes aside what's most important to me is the question of whether or not this movie captures the spirit of the Fantastic Four.  The answer is a resounding ""yes!""  The key to the appeal of the FF has always been that unlike say the Justice League or the Avengers, they were truly a family.  Sue and Johnny were siblings and Reed Richards later married Sue.  Ben Grimm was always the sort of surly but lovable unofficial uncle to the clan.The actors here capture this perfectly.  Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans ARE the Thing and the Human Torch and the light-hearted bickering between the two that fans of the comic know and love is on full display here.  Ioan Gruffud nails the brainy Mr. Fantastic and Jessica Alba is smart, sexy, and looks about as good as you could expect in the Invisible Woman's tights.The action sequences, though not ground-breaking play well and are a joy to watch.  The script is perhaps a bit too talky but that's not a surprise.  After all, this is the first FF film and it is therefore, mostly set up for future movies.This is to be expected for a film that not only launches the FF but also introduces the villain who will come to be known as the team's arch-enemy.  Spoiler alert:  Comic fans may be pleased to know that despite the changes to the cinematic version of Doom, the film's ending suggests this character's future will be closer to what they've seen in the comic books.The overall tone of the film is one that's far more light-hearted than most recent Marvel movies.  While this may offend some, I consider it as a refreshing change of pace.  The X Men movies, ""Daredevil"", and certainly ""Hulk"" were all grim affairs to some extent.  ""Fantastic Four"" director Tim Story  never forgets that, above all, a good superhero movie should be fun.  He keeps the film moving at a brisk pace and balances the laughs with more serious moments.All in all you could do far worse than invest two hours of your life watching this movie.  This is definitely one case where a movie lives up to its title.

Loria,"[6, 8]","When you make a movie based on the Fantastic Four comic, this is what you have working against you:-The Fantastic Four is a beloved Comic Book.-The definative superhero group characters created by Stan Lee in the 60's along with his other ultra-icon Marvel heroes are introduced (later followed by the X-Men).-These characters have been archetypes in not only the comic book industry, but in comic book movies, making these heroes seem tired and cliched, before even the movie trailer begins.-Some of the these movies used Marvel concepts so close that concepts accident ran together, most recently the Incredibles: which had a team with strongman, a super-stretcher, an invisible girl with forcefields, and a baby who has flame-power along with multiple other powers. Infact, a scene was cut from the F.F. Movie, with the Thing rescuing a cat from a tree by ripping the tree from the ground and shaking it, because the Incredibles ""beat them to the punch!""-No amount of ""Re-inventing"" without completely losing the original concept can alter the ""retro-ness"" even the {forgive me} cheesyness of the superhero group. So anyone making a F.F. movie, even someone who wasn't Roger Corman, would have to struggle with this. This extends to the special effects, no amount of SFX will alter the fact that a guy wrapping his body around a rock-man is not going to be real believable!On the plus side:-This F.F. filmmaker would still have Stan Lee's words, written during a time of extreme civil-strife and change, still ring true, urging us to ""judge, not on appearances, but actions"" I believe that that message, is still apparent in this 2005 film version.-Good casting is an factor working in this films favor, especially (Michael C.'s)the Thing, who like the comic is the most interesting, the most ""human"" character. This was the sledge-hammer irony Stan Lee was going for in the comic and it remains in the film. The Johnny Storm / Ben Grim dynamic is fun, if forced, this is perhaps the single across-the-board flaw of the film. Everything is a little forced, to the altering of the origin to include Dr. Doom, down to the need to untransform the Thing. I would rather have seen the Galactus/ Silver Surfer storyline intergrated into an origin story (while we're forcing things here.)Even in the world of post-Spider-Man movies, Fantastic Four is still a comic book movie, not a Graphic Novel movie or an art house film.

635846,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JNTU,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[9, 14]","I've seen plenty of comic book flicks, and I'm not just talking about the recent ones like the Spiderman films and the latest ""Batman Begins.""  I've seen all of the old Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" flicks, the Adam West ""Batman"" movies, and even some duds like the Dolph Lundgren version of ""The Punisher"" and both ""Swamp Thing"" films.  Hopefully that establishes my credit on reviewing ""Fantastic Four"" and giving it such a high rating.The story is, much like all comic first films in what will inevitably be at least followed by one sequel, an origin story.  Tim Story(Barbershop) handles the direction quite well.  Much like in ""Barbershop,"" Story develops the background of each character with depth and simplicity at the same time.  His comic-timing, especially with Human Torch and Thing, is perfect.  That duo alone is worth watching together.  I read in an issue of ""Starlog"" that Story was a little nervous about the special effects in this film because he wasn't used to using them.  He was told not to worry about the effects, that would be handled by Kurt Williams and his team of pros.  That fact comes through in this film, because the characters are developed perfectly and the special effects, while brilliant, honestly take a step back from the story.  This film is perhaps more character driven than any other comic flick out there.  You really get a sense of family between the characters on the screen.All of the actors captured the wonder of each of the heroes(or villain) that they portrayed.  Michael Chiklis might be running around in an orange rock suit for the majority of this film, but you can honestly see how big Thing's heart really is.  He could have smashed anything in his path, but instead, we learn he cares more for others than himself.  His struggle to become Ben Grimm again throughout the film is played out perfectly.  Jessica Alba does a wonderful job as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman.  Much like in the comic, she tries very hard to keep the boys from killing each other, all the while managing to blend into the background.  Thing might be made of rock, but Alba's character is the solid foundation for this group of characters.  Her brother, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, is the wild card in this bunch.  He embraces his newfound fame as a superhero, and reacts probably like any normal human being thrown into the situation would.  He loves his popularity, but he, much like Thing, cares deeply for the others in this family of heroes.  Chris Evans handles the role of Torch with youthful abandon, and it bleeds through the screen.  Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is portrayed by Ioann Gruffudd.  I don't know much about this guy, other than that he was in the recent ""King Arthur.""  Other reviewers have said he was too geeky in this role, but guess what folks, Reed Richards is a geek.  Gruffudd has a flawless performance as the leader of the Fantastic Four.  He's goofy, a little bit too enveloped with his work, and even a little unsure of himself at times, but in the end, he really does know the answer to everything.  In other words, Richards is a little bit father-figure, a little bit big brother, and a lot of fun in a geeky, awkward sense of the word.  Julian McMahon plays Dr. Doom, and manages to do it with cold and calculated flair.  Unlike many other bad guys, Doom's voice remains the same before and after he dons his metal mask, which goes to show that this dude was evil even before he became a metal megalomaniac.As stated before, the effects are brilliant.  They enhance the performances of the actors instead of draw your attention away from them.  There is some heavy CGI, but it rarely looks fake.  In fact, only Mr. Fantastic's stretching maneuvers seem to come across a little fake.  Chiklis' bodysuit blends in perfectly with the rest of the effects.  It allows him to show emotion that we weren't able to see in CGI creations like Hulk, and he wasn't fake-looking in his battle sequences like some of the other heroes from the page as of late.Overall, this is actually a very good family film.  There is a little bit of language, but nothing you won't hear at the local Wal-Mart or in the mall.  There is one particularly violent scene involving Dr. Doom and someone who crosses him, but other than that, damage is rather minimal.  There's plenty of comedy, mostly provided by Thing and Human Torch, but Mr. Fantasic's awkwardness is also fun to watch.If you want an excellent, action-packed, comedic, and, most importantly, plot-driven film, ""Fantastic Four"" is perfect.  It is well deserving of its five stars, and I hope you check it out.",5,"I Know It Sounds Cliche, But.....Fantastic!",1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,4606,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'comic', 'book', 'flicks', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'recent', 'ones', 'Spiderman', 'films', 'latest', 'Batman', 'Begins', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'old', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'flicks', 'Adam', 'West', 'Batman', 'movies', 'even', 'duds', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'version', 'Punisher', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'films', 'Hopefully', 'credit', 'reviewing', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'giving', 'high', 'rating.The', 'story', 'much', 'comic', 'first', 'films', 'what', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'least', 'followed', 'one', 'sequel', 'origin', 'story', 'Tim', 'Story', 'Barbershop', 'direction', 'quite', 'well', 'Much', 'Barbershop', 'Story', 'background', 'character', 'depth', 'simplicity', 'same', 'time', 'comic-timing', 'especially', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Thing', 'perfect', 'duo', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'together', 'read', 'issue', 'Starlog', 'Story', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'using', 'was', 'told', 'not', 'worry', 'effects', 'would', 'be', 'handled', 'Kurt', 'Williams', 'team', 'pros', 'fact', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'perfectly', 'special', 'effects', 'brilliant', 'honestly', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'story', 'film', 'perhaps', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'other', 'comic', 'flick', 'there', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'family', 'characters', 'screen.All', 'actors', 'captured', 'wonder', 'heroes', 'villain', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'might', 'be', 'running', 'around', 'orange', 'rock', 'suit', 'majority', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'see', 'how', 'big', 'Thing', 'heart', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'smashed', 'anything', 'path', 'instead', 'learn', 'more', 'others', 'struggle', 'become', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'again', 'film', 'played', 'out', 'perfectly', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Sue', 'Storm/Invisible', 'Woman', 'Much', 'comic', 'very', 'hard', 'keep', 'boys', 'killing', 'other', 'while', 'managing', 'blend', 'background', 'Thing', 'might', 'be', 'made', 'rock', 'Alba', 'character', 'solid', 'foundation', 'group', 'characters', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Storm/Human', 'Torch', 'wild', 'card', 'bunch', 'newfound', 'fame', 'superhero', 'probably', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'thrown', 'situation', 'would', 'popularity', 'much', 'Thing', 'deeply', 'others', 'family', 'heroes', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'role', 'Torch', 'youthful', 'abandon', 'screen', 'Reed', 'Richards/Mr', 'Fantastic', 'portrayed', 'Ioann', 'Gruffudd', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'guy', 'other', 'was', 'recent', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'too', 'geeky', 'role', 'guess', 'what', 'folks', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'geek', 'Gruffudd', 'flawless', 'performance', 'leader', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'goofy', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'enveloped', 'work', 'even', 'little', 'unsure', 'times', 'end', 'really', 'know', 'answer', 'everything', 'other', 'words', 'Richards', 'little', 'bit', 'father-figure', 'little', 'bit', 'big', 'brother', 'lot', 'fun', 'geeky', 'awkward', 'sense', 'word', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'plays', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'manages', 'do', 'cold', 'calculated', 'flair', 'many', 'other', 'bad', 'guys', 'Doom', 'voice', 'same', 'metal', 'mask', 'show', 'dude', 'was', 'evil', 'even', 'became', 'metal', 'megalomaniac.As', 'stated', 'effects', 'are', 'brilliant', 'enhance', 'performances', 'actors', 'instead', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'heavy', 'CGI', 'rarely', 'fake', 'fact', 'only', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'stretching', 'maneuvers', 'seem', 'come', 'little', 'fake', 'Chiklis', 'bodysuit', 'blends', 'perfectly', 'rest', 'effects', 'show', 'emotion', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'see', 'CGI', 'creations', 'Hulk', 'was', ""n't"", 'fake-looking', 'battle', 'sequences', 'other', 'heroes', 'page', 'late.Overall', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'language', 'nothing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'local', 'Wal-Mart', 'mall', 'one', 'particularly', 'violent', 'scene', 'involving', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'someone', 'who', 'other', 'damage', 'rather', 'minimal', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'provided', 'Thing', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Mr.', 'Fantasic', 'awkwardness', 'also', 'fun', 'watch.If', 'want', 'excellent', 'action-packed', 'comedic', 'most', 'importantly', 'plot-driven', 'film', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'perfect', 'well', 'deserving', 'five', 'stars', 'hope', 'check', 'out']",Fantastic Four
635847,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JNTU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[19, 26]","Films based on comic books are a bit of a mixed bag.  While never my favorite genre, the stakes have been raised in recent years.  With sophisticated outings such as ""Batman Begins"", ""X-Men 2"", and ""Spiderman 2"" and ""Superman Returns"", it seems that we've ushered in an age of comic book adaptations as art.  These films surprised me and entertained me (as any movie should), but also utilized real drama, intelligence and adult sensibilities--often with great performances and smart, logical scripts.  Even graphic novels have become a popular source for serious minded films.So ""The Fantastic Four"" is a throwback.  Far from sophisticated, it plays as a live action cartoon.  That might be OK, but the more pressing problem is that it's not particularly fun either.  I know a lot of people feel that ""The Incredibles"" borrowed heavily from ""The Fantastic Four"" concept, and maybe so.  But at least on film ""The Incredibles"" was rousing entertainment.  Maybe the film ""Fantastic Four"" should have taken that cue.I won't blame the actors.  I actually like many of them (in other roles).  It's a lackluster, sloppy script.  The filmmakers never really cared about this subject and it shows.  First and foremost, they wanted a commercial film to play to a mass audience--kiddies included.  And I can imagine small children getting a few chuckles from The Human Torch and The Thing.  Their interactions, after all, are the equivalent of junior high taunting.  But it's just not funny enough, the effects aren't original enough, and it sure lacks a brain.  Put the small kids in front of it--it's harmless enough, but you probably don't want to invest your time with ""The Fantastic Four"".

635848,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNTU,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 6]","In recent years, comic books have become one of the sources for blockbuster movies, which have released several genuinely good adventures such as X-Men, Spider-Man, Sin City, and Batman.  Several mediocre attempts have tried to follow the bandwagon through Daredevil and Electra that did not come through even though they both showed some promise.  One of my personal favorite comic books, Fantastic Four, has now also received a Hollywood treatment, and it has left me with strong feelings of anticipation, as the struggle between good and evil continues.The film opens with a fascinating shot of Victor von Doom's extravagant statue outside the offices of Doom Enterprises where Richard Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) point out his need to control others.  Reed intends to convince Doom to invest in his research in regards to solar winds.  However, the shrewd executive Doom (Julian McMahon) has already made up his mind, as he is aware of the projects possible profits and how it could increase his power and wealth.  To complicate the situation, Reed's old girlfriend Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) works for Doom, as does her brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans).  It is a beginning packed with intrigues and possible scenarios, but viewers with knowledge of the Fantastic Four already knows the next series of events.  Nonetheless, it is to be expected, as it is the foundation of the Fantastic Four's adventures.Reed's research brings Grim, Sue, Johnny, and Doom to Doom's space station, as its walls have the capability to protect them from the solar wind's radiation.  However, a miscalculation of the solar storm's arrival suggests that a catastrophe is imminent.  Somehow, they all survive and they have returned to Earth (in some peculiar way which causes some awkwardness.)  Safe back on Earth, they find themselves in quarantine (now I thought quarantine prevented people from coming in contact with the general population, but maybe I am wrong.)  Shortly after, changes begin to emerge in their physique, drastic changes, as their genetic structure has undergone a fundamental transformation.  The most evident change appears within Grimm, as his skin turns to rock.  The others also discover major changes in their physical capabilities, but it does not alter their physical presence as it does Grimm.  Some parts of the film deal with Grimm's feelings about his mutation, which comes across with awkwardness.  This part had strong potential, but should have been rewritten before the project got a green light.The film continues to deal with their personalities and how the newly acquired metamorphosis changes their lives.  The funniest transformation is Johnny's transmutation to the Human Torch, as he uses it to impress girls while increasing his bank account.  The others are more serious about the change, and worry about the possible outcomes of the alteration.  Simultaneously, Doom fights to keep his business, as investors want to pull out due to the catastrophe at the space station.  Doom also suffers from some side effects from the space station accident, but does not share his discovery with anyone.  Some intriguing notions are touched upon through the mutations, but sorry to say, it shows a very one-dimensional perspective of the psychological and social scar of the characters.The story is basically established on the idea that they got their mutations, but no real conflict arises.  This is besides the obvious conflict with Doom, which all readers of Fantastic Four already know about.  However, the film never explains why Doom wants to destroy the Fantastic Four, it merely suggests that they are powerful and stand in his way to accomplish something (oh, yes, I know that he wants world domination from the comic books and the few lines when he says it in the movie.)  It is within the conflict where the audience usually finds a plot, but since there is no conflict then there is not plot.  The film simply builds on the suggestion that the Fantastic Four will fight with Doom, but never really why this battle would exist.  Some of the weakness in the plot creation rests within the poor character development, which as mentioned is far too one-dimensional and unenthusiastic.  The characters appear extremely stereotypical in regards to the individual characteristic such as Reed who is a nerd, Grimm, the super loyal war companion, Johnny, the adolescent renegade, and Sue, the benevolent female hero who is in love with Reed.Being an avid reader of the Marvel comic books has left me with a very disappointing cinematic experience in regards to the world of the Fantastic Four.  It did not meet the expectations, as Sam Raimi did with Spider-Man (2002) and the silver screen version of Sin City's ominously cynical world.  The film's lacking of a plot made it difficult to watch while the stereotypical characters feel uninteresting.  Nonetheless, the film offers some extravagantly flashy CGI action, but it lacks the insightfulness of many recently released superhero films.  The moral of the story emerges, but does so with childish ease.  Fantastic Four's cinematic journey culminates in a clash between good and evil that compares to a vain daydream wishing for something better.",2,Hollow CGI Feast Does Not Meet

Ross ""Kristy""","[7, 10]","While an obvious improvement over the infamous (and excremental) 1994 version, this take on the story of the FANTASTIC FOUR just isn't all that fantastic. This movie is a suitable summer superhero flick, but after the recent and truly fantastic BATMAN, SPIDER-MAN, and X-MEN offerings, FF comes off as a merely adequate film that would have been more satisfying prior to the year 2000, before the bar had been raised. The action and the top-notch SFX are the film's selling points, and while this affable summer blockbuster dishes of plenty of bangs, it doesn't quite click the way previous MARVEL offerings did. Of course, you should see it on the big screen for the stunning big-scale visuals and kinetic zest, but these days you need to put everything you have on the screen, or they'll just walk out and watch the Adam Sandler movie playing in the next cinema.Each actor brings just enough life into each role and not an ounce more. There's more personality retread than human exposition, and character development is left to a loop of traits. Johnny Storm/The Human Torch is a cocky thrill seeker and impatient daredevil, Ben Grimm/The Thing is grumpy over Johnny's antics and his physical transformation, and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is a hopeless nerd who keeps snuffing the flame between himself and Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Together, the Fantastic Four face off against Dr. Victor Von Doom, a power-hungry millionaire with convenient menace. Don't worry about short-term memory loss; the film doesn't miss an opportunity to remind the audience how one-note each character.After a bridge accident that quickly and conveniently escalates in order to give each of the Four a chance to showcase their talents, the plot meanders around with the group dynamic before climaxing in a showdown with Von Doom that once again provides the opportunity for each hero to shine once more. Thankfully, the plot keeps moving, but director Tim Story (BARBERSHOP, TAXI) is a strange choice for helming FF. His lack of experience shows here, and that's the film's biggest flaw. Nevertheless, who cares really? Go see it on a Friday night with a big box of popcorn and some good friends and you'll be guaranteed an entertaining comic book flick.

I do this mainly for the directing and not necessarily the story and content. I realize it is a remake of a comic book. Look at Spiderman, that could've been corny but it was directed well and you took it seriously. You couldn't take fantastic 4 seriously.This movie relies on the audience knowing who the Fantastic 4 are. I bet money that 90% of the audience hasn't a clue who they are and/or read the comic book. It's not even a popular comic.The directing should have been a lot better. Anytime you have a movie with a big rock-thing and a guy that can turn into Gumby you must make sure it doesn't become cheesy. And God, the ending was HORRIBLE and pure cheese.

The previews that I saw were not all that impressive but I figured that hey, it's the Fantastic 4, go see it.  But I was more than pleasantly suurprised.  I was blown away.This movie was great in that it did not appear to take itself so serious that they thought they were really saving the world.  Actually, in this movie, they were pretty much just saving themselves.They did not act as though world peace or the cure for cancer hinged on them.  They wre just regular folks caught up in a meteor storm who developed special powers.  They still acted like regular people and the movie showed them coming to terms with the changes. They did not just go from nobody to superhero overnight.It was funny and entertaining and the actors were believeable in the roles or rather as believeable as can be playing comic book characters.  The story line did not make me roll my eyes repeatedly (although I did some).  One complaint-  I thought the backstory was a little skimpy; second, the movie should have stuck to the comics' reason of why Victor had animosity toward Reed rather than making a love triangle the issue;  third,  the scenes regarding the mission were skimpy.  It is a good thing that I knew enough of the story myself to fill in the blanks.  But overall, the movie was well written and the facts here were pretty close to those in the comics and cartoons with some exceptions that did not take away from the movie (unless you are a picky comics fan).I was not that crazy about the guy who played Reed because he was a little wimpy but Jessica Alba made an awesome Sue.  And the guy who played Johnny was fabulous.  He played Johnny as a risk taking rebel rather than the ""good boy"" he was on the cartoon.  I also liked Michael Chiklis as the Thing.  He was as great here as he is on the Shield.  One complaint though-- he and Reed were supposed to have gone to school together.  Michael Chiklis as Ben is clearly alot older than the guy who played Reed.  Also, in the movie they mentioned that all of them had attended MIT.  Ben Grimm as played here was clearly Reed's enforcer and was definitely not a rocket scientist.  This made me ask ""Since when did MIT get a football team?""I am giving this movie 5 stars even with the flaws I mentioned because it was well worth the money I spent to see it and the time flew by as I enjoyed the show.  I went to be entertained.  I was entertained beyond my expectations.Ignore any critics and naysayers and remember that this is a movie based on comic book characters.

635862,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNTU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 14]","Apparently we are living in the golden age of comic book movies.  Last summer we had ""Spiderman 2"" and this summer we had ""Batman Begins"" and now ""Fantastic Four.""  As a result, memories of ""Hulk"" and ""Elektra"" are quickly receding into the background.  The worst of times are over and let us enjoy the best of times while we can, hoping that Hollywood gets the point regarding the importance of fidelity to the spirit, if not the letter, of the original comic books they are bringing to the big screen.The Fantastic Four, who will be confused with ""The Incredibles"" even though they should not be, are Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm/The Invisible Girl (Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Chris Evans), and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Michael Chiklis).  The genesis for ""The World's Greatest Comic Book"" was Stan Lee and Jack Kirby taking the idea of a superhero group (to wit, the Justice League of America) and giving it a twist by having the members always at each other's throat.  The screenplay by Mark Frost (""Hill Street Blues,"" ""Twin Peaks"") and Michael France (""Hulk,"" ""Punisher"") ups the ante on that dysfunctionality.  Of course you have the Thing mad at everybody, but primarily at Reed, whom he blames for the transformation, and Johnny, who is always adding insult to the aforementioned injury along with a bevy of practical jokes.  But now we also have Reed and Sue being an ex-couple with unresolved issues from their breakup and Sue constantly telling Johnny to grow up (especially when he publicly lays the ""Invisible Girl"" label on her).There are a lot of things that I think this movie has working in its favor.  First, the humor, of which there is a lot, is mostly character driven and rarely overplayed, without taking away from the seriousness of the storyline.  Second, when there are fight sequences you can actually see what is going on because Tim Story is not relying on rapid editing of shots to simply convey an effect.  Third, there is an effort to deal realistically with these powers, from what happens to their clothes to asking the big question that has been on the minds of everyone regarding Mr. Fantastic since issue #1 of the comic book (okay, the question goes back to Plastic Man, but nod your head and play along).  Fourth, when we get to the big finale the F.F. actually work as a team.  True, if you are four against one that makes sense, but the contrast to the X-Men movies where everybody teams up for fights or takes turns fighting Magneto was good to see.  Finally, for the first time, in his cameo Stan Lee actually plays a recognizable and beloved character from the original comic book and for that matter I liked the casting with Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington), and hope there is a scene or two between her and Ben that will appear in the deleted scenes on the DVD (which I expect to see out for Christmas).For me the problematic parts of the story line have to do with the new and improved Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon).  On the hand I understand the problem when you have a quartet of superheroes going up against a guy wearing armor and a cloak.  After all, Doom is not as smart as Reed and not as strong as the Thing, so being the FF's greatest villain given the inherent one-to-four odds had to rely on other things, which was usually the element of surprise and the fact Doom was the king of Latveria.  Having diplomatic immunity is a nice roadblock for superheroes to have to deal with in repeat encounters.  What they go for here is to have Victor along for the ride so when dem cosmic rays hit he gets some powers too and has his own dermatological concerns.  The Marvel universe reference would be Electro, but I was going for the irony of Dr. Doom being like the Emperor in ""Star Wars,"" because I think the shadow of Darth Vader effects Doom's characterization.  Because the weakest part of this whole movie is Doom's ""normal"" speaking voice once he dons his armor because I have always thought of him as being to the right of Magneto on the megalomaniac scale.  I want Dr. Doom to sound like the king of a European postage stamp nation bringing down his wrath on those who dare oppose him (yes, I think the voice makes that much of a difference, a point amply proven by Darth Vader).I still end up rounding up on this one at the end even though I am not enamored of the Thing wearing long pants, being married, or looking like he did in issue #1 rather than developing the ridged forehead.  I am glad that they explained at one point that Victor's company was out to ruin Reed because I found the idea that Mr. Fantastic is not as smart as we think that he is rather unsettling.  Sue Storm is certainly a modern woman and we refer to this film as ""the new Jessica Alba movie"" around our house, but it is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm who keeps trying to steal this movie.  Johnny is no longer a teenager, but he has that mentality and Evans milks the role for all it is worth.  Clearly Marvel is always looking for a franchise with any and all of their comic book movies and given that long-range view I also would have liked them to have twisted the knife a bit more with Ben Grimm (e.g., only hint at Alicia at this point), because I think they were a bit too quick to throw away one of the more tragic comic book figures in the Marvel universe.  I was going to say you cannot go back and revisit that initial ground again, but we already learned this summer that you can.",5,The World's Greatest Comic Book ends up a pretty good

635863,A19RAJY6R7USN0,B00005JNTU,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[8, 10]","I so expected this movie to suck. I mean the Fantastic Four are not my favorite Marvel heroes, and past attempts to bring them to the screen has proved unsuccessful.Still, I enjoyed this one. The movie may be considered a little slow since quite a bit of time is spent on the origin story. Of course that's what I'd expect since this is supposedly the first in a potential franchise. It's also interesting to see them all finally come together with their powers, in a scene (around the middle of the film) quite reminiscent of the first time Superman saves Lois Lane in the 1978 Superman movie. In regards to pacing, Dr Doom (once he discovers his powers) is dealt with in one battle at the end of the film pretty swiftly. Unlike for example Spider-Man 2 where Doc Ock made a few evil appearances before the final battle, in Fantastic Four Dr Doom discovers his powers during the extended origin and then our heroes get straight to it and that's the end of the movie.This may unsettle some audiences but I consider it to simply be a change to the formula we've expected in recent years.

635868,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B00005JNTU,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[5, 7]","Super hero movies are a category unto themselves, and often prove difficult to review objectively. Some fans of the original comics will just be glad to see their favorite characters portrayed on the big screen. Other fans want strict adherence to the original source material. Those unfamiliar with the source material probably wont care one way or the other, but will criticize aspects of the movie they see as silly. What takes place in the pages of a comic or within the world of animation doesn't always translate well to live action. It's especially hard to judge such a movie correctly, in the face of all these compounding factors.For me, I didn't care much for this film adaptation of Stan Lee's famous super-hero team. But I'll do more than tell you it sucks, I'll tell you why I think it sucks so you can decide for yourself if it's worth seeing.First of all, there were numerous changes to original storyline. This almost always takes place, whether adapting a book or a comic to Hollywood, but I really resent the way Hollywood can take a popular comic series and shamelessly alter it to better-appeal to their target audience. In the comic Mr. Fantastic is married to the Invisible Woman, and they (at least to me) appear considerably older than they do in the movie. It seems as if Hollywood saw fit to reduce the ages of the characters, probably in an effort to appeal to younger audiences, and had the main characters unwed so they could throw in a sad attempt at a romantic angle. I'm sorry, but I hate the fact that they felt the need to throw in a love triangle where one previously did not exist. And the invisible woman looked nothing like Jessica Alba. This is just an example of Hollywood saying ""well wouldn't it be better if the characters were all hot young people with some kind of unresolved relationship issue?""Furthermore the source material is further betrayed by the complete rewriting of Dr. Doom, the arch nemesis of the 4. In the comics he is a super-genius, who is usually only outsmarted by Mr. Fantastic due to his arrogance and ego; and he is also a sorcerer. I see how the latter of these was omitted, as it would complicate the plot mechanics and also be somewhat harder for audiences to take seriously, but to have a Dr. Doom that isn't a genius defeats the purpose. Doom is now portrayed as a business man, and although it's suggested he has above average intelligence, this has no place in the plot, and Reed is depicted as being of far superior intellect. His character is also very shallow, with a very flimsy explanation for his transition to evil, and practically no character depth at all. The character was so flat, it's really sad.The other characters were also fairly flat, and the storytelling dimension of the movie was very poor. The exception to this is with The Thing, who has a good subplot over his hideous transformation. Michael Chiklis is also the only decent case of acting in this whole movie. The rest of the acting is sup par and unengaging, not that there was much plot or depth for the actors to really work with. Poor dialogue plagues the film, and some of the original lines from the comics that were kept ""it's clobberin' time"" and ""flame on"" are difficult to watch real actors say without chuckling.That's not to say that this movie has no redeeming qualities. The special effects are cool, and there are a number of comical moments in the movie that were done well. Indeed one thing that the movie has going for it is that it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, which makes some of the aforementioned points more forgivable to the right viewer. However one big problem is how FAKE The Thing looks! They used a prosthetic body suit instead of CGI effects here, and unfortunately, it comes off looking quite unrealistic and silly. This was a major blow for me, as every time I saw his character I felt like I was watching a comedy as opposed to a serious action film.The only thing really worth seeing here are the special effects. Which might make you assume there'd be plenty of action in this movie! But you'd be wrong. There wasn't much action at all. There's really only one major fight scene, that being the climactic battle with Dr. Doom, which was pretty unimpressive. This movie was not intense at all, and had more laughs than it did wows. And the one really saving grace of this movie is they manage to have a number of very humorous scenarios relating to the heroes' respective powers. Unfortunately not all the laughter was intended.But a few laughs and some cool effects doesn't cut it enough for me to take my attention away from the major problems of this movie. But to be fair, I tend to be critical of this genre anyway, so fans of the genre should see this movie for themselves as make up their own minds. Let me put it this way, Spiderman was better. Those who aren't big super-hero movie fans, be cautioned. And obviously, if you aren't a fan of super-heroes at all, you should think twice and try to watch with a very light heart. But as far as I'm concerned this movie was just mindless crapola targeted at teen and preteen audiences, albeit amusing crapola.",2,Fantastic 4 gets a terrible 2,1136764800,"01 9,

At the core is the story of 4 individuals who have to put aside egos and/or personal histories in order to come together and become a team.  Each actor played his and/or her role perfectly and the result is a rousingly fun movie that keeps you cheering for the heroes all to way to the end.  Julian McMahon was a maniacal, power-hungry Dr. Doom, Ioan Gruffudd plays the part of the &#34;dumbest smart person&#34; extremely well, Michael Chiklis makes you feel for his character and the burden he must bare, Jessica Alba's Invisible Woman is easily the heart and soul of the team, and Chris Evans plays the human torch to perfection.  I was so upset to find out that Chris would be playing Captain America, because that meant that there would be no more Fantastic 4 movies (although, I do have to admit, he is also brilliant as Steve Rogers).

To do that, he swallows his pride and turns to his old rival, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).  Victor agrees, and soon five people are traveling to a space station, hoping to get their experiment set up before a cosmic storm arrives.Unfortunately, they don't make it, and the five of them are caught in the storm.  At first, there don't appear to be any effects.  But then they begin to change.  First, it's Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who becomes a rock creature.  But then Reed discovers he can flex his body into any shape desired.  Siblings Sue and Johnny Storm (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans) also find they have powers.  Sue can turn invisible and create force fields while Johnny can turn his body into fire and use that to fly.Johnny is the only one of the four who is excited about their new found powers.  He wants to use them for good, sure, but also exploit them for profit.  Ben is the most reluctant to embrace their new found powers since he's a giant rock.  Reed tries to find a way to reverse the process while all of them attempt to deal with the powers.Meanwhile, Dr. Doom is also undergoing a change.  But he wants to use his powers to satisfy his own greed and take over the world.  Now, the Fantastic Four will need to accept their powers in order to stop him.I had heard of the Fantastic Four, but didn't know what to expect going into this movie.  The things I did expect were good special effects and lots of action.  I got one of the two.  The special effects were incredible, especially for Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch and Reed as Mr. Fantastic.Instead of being an action movie, this was more a character drama giving the origins and background on the characters.  There were some action scenes, but they were few and far between and mostly came at the end.  Frankly, I left the theater disappointed because it wasn't what I expected.That's not to say that the story wasn't interesting or entertaining.  Four ordinary people suddenly having these powers thrust on them will turn their lives upside down, and I enjoyed how it was handled.  I especially felt sorriest for Ben who had his entire life changed forever by his new form.This movie gives good background on the characters and sets things up for the inevitable sequel.

Usually these films are sequels that just play off of old jokes or old themes (Scary Movie 3 for instance).  However, the Fantastic Four is not a sequel, but it does suck the life away from the superhero genre.  Everything in this movie feels so tired and so overdone that I could not be entertained by this movie.  The acting is bad, the special effects are cheesey, and I agree with Richard Roeper: who the hell's idea was it to make Jessica Alba the Invisible Girl?  I want to see her at all times.  That's the point of sex appeal.  Put Tilda Swinton (not to dog her acting talent) in this role.  The characters seem like they have already been done (for instance the Thing looks quite a bit like the Incredible Hulk, except a little less green).  After movies like Batman Begins and Spiderman 2, you really should read the script and cast better actors before making a film as bad as this.  This is one of the worst superhero movies ever made, and definitely one of the worst movies of the year.  Chris Evans was showing so much potential when he did Cellular, and this movie just sets him back thirty years.

After the film I was feeling a little heroic. Now I'm not going to match wits with a bully, so I put it in terms he understood--- I went upside his fat, greasy head with the back of my hand, and demanded he apologize, and mean it, or he was going to be sorrier than ever. His so-called friends shrank from his side and with no way around me he apologized and started making excuses for his behavior. ""I get so mad when people don't know what they're talking about."" I went upside his head again just on principle. When I come here and read bad reviews of a good movie like this... this particular situation made me wonder about the people writing them.I don't have to rehash for you what a million people before me have already said about The Fantastic 4. It's a pretty good movie, worth my dollars if not yours. The ""reviews"" here that bash it... it's pathetic.Find a bad review here, and then click on ""see all my reviews"", and you'll learn as I did; these angry plankton hate everything they see. Some of them I suspect hate their lives more than any film, and they have to spew their venom somewhere. Welcome to the Internet.Others, like the meatball who recieved a harsh lesson in manners, are probably just angry that their tiny, insulated, comic book nichce has had a spotlight shone on it, and what they believe was once a sub-cultured, members-only club for outcasts like themselves is now part of the mainstream.It's a disaster for these people that well adjusted folks, who have better things to do than read comic books and better people to do it with, in other words people with lives, can enjoy these stories as well, and don't give much notice to the so-called ""true history"" of comic books such as The Fantastic 4.I personally couldn't care less. Stan Lee did a cameo in the movie. He wrote the damn comic. He's okay with it, then what's the problem? It must cost them sleep that one of their Gods doesn't take much notice that he's alienating their little fandom of his comic. I guess he'd rather count money or something. But why wouldn't Stan Lee, or anyone with a brain, sell punks like this out? Makes sense to me. Click on how this didn't help, dorks. I care about as much as Stan Lee cares.

Afterall, Patrick Stewart, Ian McCellan, and Hugh Jackman are tough acts to follow.There are changes to the film.  For example Victor Von Doom was with them in space.  But overall they did make an effort to stay loyal.Of all the actors I have to give Michael Chiklis a special mention.  The guy was right on.  He has defined the role and I doubt any could have done it better.  You felt for him.The others?  Well Chris Evens did a good job and presented the annoying factor really well.Jessica Alba?

635882,A16X7GKCK83WUE,B00005JNTU,"Matthew Bratkowski ""mattster""","[3, 5]","Fantastic Four begins with five brillant scientists embarking into outer space to study the properties of DNA in the midst of an inter-galatic storm. Unfortunately, miscalculations cause the crew to be exposed to the storm.  When they arrive back on Earth, they soon discover that the storm has altered their DNA and given them super powers.  Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) is able to stretch his body into over-extension, Susan Storm (Invisible Woman) can become invisible, Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) can lite himself on fire, and Ben Grimm's (The Thing) skin has been replaced with a layer of orange brick.  Together, the group forms the fantastic four.  The fifth member of the shuttle crew is Victor von Doom, the benefactor of the mission.  He also is discovering that he acquired powers of his own and is not too happy that the failure of the mission caused the end of his career.  Dr. Doom wants retribution.As promising as I thought this movie would be, I wasn't really too impressed with the plot.  One personal grudge was that many aspects of the plot were explained by mentioning DNA.  I work with DNA and don't see any reason why anyone would need to study it in space or why it would give people superpowers, but that is besides the point.  The point is that too much of the movie was spent on the origin of the group--much of which was contrary to the comic--and there was little other storyline or big action scences.  Reed Richards treats their superpowers like a ""disease"" and builds a machine to try to ""cure"" them, but I thought this was kind of stupid.  It was a little interesting that Ben Grimm had an ""existential"" dilema with being The Thing, but mainly I thought that the movie needed more villianous plots created by Dr. Doom and foiled by the Fantastic Four, rather than a single, simple battle scene at the end of the movie.Besides the plot, I thought that the casting for the movie was pretty good.  Ioan Gruddle (spelling?) looked and acted just like Mr. Fantastic would be expected to.  Michael Chucklis was the best choice for the role of The Thing because he has a perfect stature for it.  Chris Evans did a good job of capturing the hubris of The Human Torch.  I originally thought that Jessica Alba was a little of a dark horse for the role of the blond, debutante Invisible Women but I have to give her credit because she pulled it off.  I think that the actor that played Dr. Doom was good for the role too, but I did not like what the movie did with the character.  Instead of being a man in a mask and a costume like in the comic, the movie made it out to be that his skin was actually made of metal, which was dumb.  It made him seem like the T9000 from Terminator 2 or Iron Man from the Black Sabbath song (not the Iron Man from the Marvel comic book).  And if he was supposed to be from Latvaria, why didn't he have a sinister accent?  That would have been great.Overall, the movie wasn't bad for an action movie, but too scarce on plot to be too engaging.  In terms of other Marvel Comics movies, it isn't as good as the Spiderman movies, but much better than The Hulk.  Basically, it is about the quality of the X-Man movies.  It is enjoyable enough, but didn't have the direction or depth that I was hoping for.",3,Could be better.

I'd heard a lot of the rumblings that it wasn't ""epic"" enough and that they'd made too many changes, etc. However, when I sat down to watch this, it really won me over. Sure it's not the big action/effects blockbuster that it could have been, but that is really where it succeeds. If it had been made in that way, it would've been a lesser film. Allow me to explain. This film really captures the characters (their personalities, quirks and tensions) remarkably well. The emphasis IS on the characters. Not the effects or the action or the spectacle. THE CHARACTERS. The casting here is near-perfect. Jessica Alba probably isn't the right choice for the role, however, that said, she really does radiate a definite charm that won me over. Plus, Reed may not have noticed it (or at least he wasn't admitting it), she does look HOT in that outfit! Julian McMahon makes Doom his own, which more than makes up for the changes they made to his character. Michael Chiklis is perfect as Ben. But the real casting coup here, in my opinion, is Ioan Gruffudd. He is nothing short of perfect as Reed. Intelligent without being boring, confident enough to really convince as team leader. Tim Story really deserves way more credit than he received for making such a fine film. Pure entertainment from start to finish. And you can't ask for more than that.And to all those who dismiss this DVD version of FF, both the JACK KIRBY: STORYTELLER and THE WORLD'S GREATEST COMIC MAGAZINE documentaries are worth it alone to buy this version.

Given the recent crop of actually good superhero movies (""Batman Begins"" being at the top of the list, followed by ""The Incredibles,"" ""Spider-Man 2"" and a few others), I had high hopes for this film. I confess, I know nothing about the comic-book history of the Fantastic Four, so I relied on the film to give me all the information I needed.The film turns out to have done too thorough a job at this. There is suprisingly little action in the movie; at least the first hour is seemingly devoted to nothing but listing names and occupations and nick-names and special powers and responsibilities and theories and...well, you get the idea. I have nothing against a little backstory (""Batman Begins"" is almost nothing but backstory and yet is one of the best movies I've seen in a long while) but ""Fantastic Four"" takes so long setting up the story that it fails to interest me in the protagonists. Additionally, their superhero names all-too-frequently are so similar to others that I had difficulty establishing them as unique entities.The acting, for the most part, is lacklustre at best, though how much of this is the high-school-play-style script's fault and how much responsibility lies with the actors is an open question. I've been a fan of Ioan Gruffudd's since his Horatio Hornblower days, and he's acquitted himself well in many things, but here his Mr. Fantastic (could there BE a less inventive name for the guy?) is ramrod-stiff and unengaging as a dreary goody-two-shoes who couldn't be less believeable as a superhero if he tried. Jessica Alba is a pretty face but very little else as the Invisible Girl, and her smarmy yet surprisingly vapid delivery doesn't help me believe that she's a scientist or astronaut or whatever she's supposed to be. Julian McMahon is not quite as bad as Dr. Victor Von Doom, but really...why does that surname not make anyone in this movie uncomfortable? Isn't it rather a tip-off to his character? The only people who are at all engaging or entertaining to watch in this film are Michael Chiklis, who brings a certain pathos to his role as The Thing (though one really never gets to see much of his face beneath the foam latex, which is a shame), and Chris Evans as the Human Torch, who doesn't seem to be taking anything seriously and is the only one to nail the vapid light-heartedness that this film sorely needs.The special-effects are sorely underwhelming, even cartoonish, which may or may not be intentional but look morbidly out of place on a large screen. This movie may be the only one this summer to have a chance of being improved by watching it on DVD. The Thing is very, very obviously Michael Chiklis in a foam latex suit. Mr. Fantastic is really, really NOT fantastic, and it's rather gruesome to watch him stretch and bend quite as much as he does, particularly as he gets grainier with every, ahem, stretch of the imagination. The plot does not suffer from the constraints of logical plausibility, nor does it appear to have given the screen-writers and story consultants much of a headache in terms of plotting or continuity as there clearly wasn't much effort put into it. I left the theatre more perplexed than I was when the movie began, never a pleasant way to leave a film experience.I suppose I was most disappointed by the fact that it could have been a Good Dumb Movie, along the lines of the first two ""Mummy"" films, but fails spectacularly. The potential ramifications of being thrust into superhero-dom are not explored at all, nor are the complicated relationships that would inevitably arise from their situations. The only time the film really touches on this is when Ben Grimm/The Thing is unceremoniously (and embarassingly publicly) dumped by his wife because she cannot stand what he has become, but even this problem is handily dispatched by giving him a blind girlfriend. The potentially destructive powers of these people are never examined - the Human Torch can burn at supernova temperatures, which would destroy the earth, we are told, but it is all done rather flippantly, as though the thought of someone as irresponsible as Johnny Storm having the power to incinerate our planet wasn't something extraordinary and dangerous.Even the roles that these characters would play in saving the world from disaster are not really defined, though their powers are explained and demonstrated at length. For instance, in the Four's first outing, the Human Torch (my, this naming thing gets repetitive) saves a girl from a fiery explosion by setting himself ablaze and holding her tightly to form a shield around her...but since he can burn at supernova temperatures and is ON FIRE while he's holding her, I cannot see where this wouldn't have been just as deadly to the poor little girl. Wreaking havoc on innocent bystanders is hardly a good thing for superheroes to do, yet the rescues by the Four are usually required by their own incompetence. Inconsistencies like this are everywhere, pointing to a sloppy storytelling job that is simply inexcusable.Ultimately, if you've already seen ""Batman Begins,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" and, well, everything else playing at your local multiplex, ""Fantastic Four"" isn't a completely horrid way to spend $6. There are a few good laughs and, as utter popcorn movies go, it's not the dumbest I've ever seen. If you have no other option and desperately really need to see something one lazy summer afternoon, this will do. And it is still better than ""Herbie: Fully Loaded.""",2,NOT so Fantastic,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,5529,"['Where', 'start', 'Given', 'recent', 'crop', 'actually', 'good', 'superhero', 'movies',

635893,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JNTU,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[0, 2]","The 2005 film ""Fantastic Four"", directed by Tim Story (who directed ""Barbershop"" in 2002), was based upon a group of superhero characters of the same name that were created in 1961 for Marvel Comics by Jack Kirby (1917-1994) and Stan Lee. The film's plot, written by Michael France and Mark Frost, is about how five individuals survive a horrific radiation exposure in space.  The scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his friend/assistant Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis, who won a Golden Globe in 2003 for his work in the TV series ""The Shield"", and has been nominated again twice in 2004 & 2005 for the same) approach the very wealthy billionaire Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, who has received a 2005 Golden Globe nomination for his work in the TV series ""Nip/Tuck"") for funding to explore Reed's theory of stellar radiation clouds affecting DNA and causing it to evolve.  Victor is initially reluctant, but decides to fund the project as long as he receives a very large portion of any profits resulting from the work.  The woman that Victor loves, who is also one of his employees, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba, who received a Golden Globe nomination in 2001 for her work in the short-lived TV series ""Dark Angel""), becomes involved in the project.  She and Reed had previously been romantically involved with one another.  Her brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), is an experienced pilot that will pilot the shuttle from Earth to Victor's space station in orbit above the Earth where Reed's experiment will be conducted.  On board the space station and preparing for the arrival of highly-charged cloud of stellar gases, Ben is carries out a space walk to install plant specimens outside of the radiation-proof space station; but Reed discovers that the cloud of stellar material will arrive in a matter of minutes, not hours as had previously been projected. Ben attempts to get back into the safety of the space station, but is exposed to the intense radiation of the cloud, as are Reed, Sue, Johnny and Victor (who also went on the trip).  The five return to Earth.  Victor doesn't believe that he was exposed, but the others clearly were and are kept in quarantine for a while. It is during their quarantine that Reed, Sue and Johnny discover that they have acquired some amazing powers: Sue can become invisible, Reed can stretch like a rubber band and Johnny has become a human torch.  Ben, who received the greatest exposure, transforms into a monstrous-sized super-human, but no longer looks particularly human.  Upset, Ben leaves Victor's quarantine facility to speak with his girlfriend, but when she sees what he has become, she no longer wants anything to do with him.  Seeing Ben so upset, Reed comes up with a plan to artificially recreate the conditions of their accident in an effort to reverse the effects of the radiation.  In the meantime, Victor's finances are not doing well as his board of directors is ready to shut down his company, which is rapidly losing value.  Also, Victor, who thought he was protected on board the space station, is instead also starting to transform into something less than human; but unlike the other four, his motivations are far more egocentric.  Thus, the Fantastic Four comes into being, as does their main nemesis, who decides to go after the Fantastic Four whom he in part blames for his current financial downturn.With its special effects, ""Fantastic Four"" is visually impressive, but Tim Story's lack of directorial experience, as well as lackluster writing (writer Michael France received a Razzie nomination for Worst Screenplay for his work in the 1993 film ""Cliffhanger""), made for wooden & one-dimensional characters that failed to capture the interest of many people in the audience.  Thus, I can only rate the 2005 film ""Fantastic Four"" with 3 out of 5 stars.

635898,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JNTU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","As franchises go, Fantastic Four is relatively unexplored territory. There are probably good reasons for this: one of the characters is a cigar-chomping piece of rock, three members of the team are related to each other, and one of character's claim to fame is his amazing intellect combined with...wait for it...the power of STRETCHING.  Which was pretty funny in the 70s when it was portrayed in cartoons (I can still hear the ""stretching"" sound like a vacuum played backwards) and is a little creepy today.Given that comics are the new hot property for movies, it was inevitable that the good 'ole FF have their own film.  And thus we have Ioan Gruffud (a less charismatic Jeff Goldblum) as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the delectable Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, gruff Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and Chris Evans as the wisecracking pretty boy Johnny Storm/The Human Torch. Our heroic crew assembles in privately funded mission into space to explore...cosmic space gas. Only something goes terribly awry and the mutagenic mist transforms the four astronauts into super powered freaks.The inherent silliness of the plot and characters has been spoofed so many times that it's difficult for the actual Fantastic Four to keep up.  We've all seen the family squabbles of the Incredibles. But perhaps the most caustic send-up is The Venture Bros., who deftly skewers the FF by casting Reed as an outdated 50s stereotype, Sue as a liberated housewife, and The Thing as a mentally deficient monster.Perhaps FF can be forgiven for its lack of focus as it tries to walk the tightrope between being superhero silly and deadly serious.  Reed's romance with Sue is in its early stages here, complicated by a rival, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon)...You!  You in the back with the funny haircut!  Stop laughing!  That's the man's name, all right?  It has nothing to do with his tendency for evil!  Or fancy alliteration.  Or that he happens to be a native of some country you've never heard of...that happens to send him a mask...that he just happens to wear...Fine.  Fine, yes, this is all a little ridiculous.  But there's angst!  Poor Grimm suffers as he struggles with his identity and his hot wife dumps him (while wearing a negligee in the middle of the street, of course). Will Reed propose to Sue, or will she stick with Doom? Will Johnny ever stop being such a card?  Will Sue ever discover how to turn invisible without taking off her clothes? (!)And so FF stumbles over itself in an attempt to be both true to the comic book's origins and cram in a plot that's really five stories into one film. Ben Grimm's angst as the unpleasant-looking Thing is diminished by a device that ""cures"" him. A device that didn't work without Doom's special powers, but mysteriously works in reverse without explanation. Alba is too sexy for the role; it's hard to believe the wooden Richards could romance her or that she'd find the stilted Von Doom any more attractive. And Richards' serious scientific efforts are undermined that he's basically a big inflatable balloon.  In fact, much of the fight scenes in this movie involve members of the FF battling each other.The special effects do a good job of displaying the heroes' powers, but The Thing simply looks like a guy in rubber foam.  Chiklis is big, but he's not a huge man, and the film sometimes remember he's heavy and cumbersome (complete with thudding footfalls and exploding chairs) and then forgets when it's inconvenient (because a wooden bench can surely handle his massive weight, right?).I think a lot of fans are just happy this film isn't the first attempt (that never saw the light of day but lives on in bootlegs).  For my FF fix, I prefer theanimated version, which manages to be both hilarious and action-packed while poking fun at the utter ridiculousness of a super-science team consisting of a talking rock, a rubber band man, an invisible woman, and a real flamer.",3,Not So Fantastic,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,3957,"['franchises', 'go', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'relatively', 'unexplored', 'territory', 'are', 'probably', 'good', 'reasons', 'one', 'characters', 'cigar-chomping', 'piece', 'rock', 'three', 'members', 'team', 'are', 'related', 'other', 'one', 'character', 'claim', 'fame', 'amazing', 'intellect', 'combined', 'wait', 'power', 'STRETCHING', 'Which', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', '70s', 'when', 'was', 'portrayed', 'cartoons', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'stretching', 'sound', 'vacuum', 'played', 'backwards', 'little', 'creepy', 'today.Given', 'comics', 'are', 'new', 'hot', 'property', 'movies', 'was', 'inevitable', 'good', ""'ole"", 'FF', 'have', 'own', 'film', 'thus', 'have', 'Ioan', 'Gruffud', 'less', 'charismatic', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Reed', 'Richards/Mr', 'Fantastic', 'delectable', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Sue', 'Storm/The', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'gruff', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Ben', 'Grimm/The', 'Thing', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'wisecracking', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Johnny', 'Storm/The', 'Human', 'Torch', 'heroic', 'crew', 'assembles', 'privately', 'funded', 'mission', 'space', 'explore', 'cosmic', 'space', 'gas', 'Only', 'something', 'terribly', 'awry', 'mutagenic', 'mist', 'four', 'astronauts', 'super', 'powered', 'freaks.The', 'inherent', 'silliness', 'plot', 'characters', 'been', 'spoofed', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'difficult', 'actual', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'keep', 'up', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'family', 'squabbles', 'Incredibles', 'perhaps', 'most', 'caustic', 'send-up', 'Venture', 'Bros.', 'who', 'deftly', 'FF', 'casting', 'Reed', 'outdated', '50s', 'stereotype', 'Sue', 'liberated', 'housewife', 'Thing', 'mentally', 'deficient', 'monster.Perhaps', 'FF', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'lack', 'focus', 'walk', 'tightrope', 'being', 'superhero', 'silly', 'deadly', 'serious', 'Reed', 'romance', 'Sue', 'early', 'stages', 'here', 'complicated', 'rival', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'back', 'funny', 'haircut', 'Stop', 'laughing', 'man', 'name', 'right', 'nothing', 'do', 'tendency', 'evil', 'fancy', 'alliteration', 'be', 'native', 'country', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'send', 'mask', 'just', 'wear', 'Fine', 'Fine', 'yes', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'angst', 'Poor', 'Grimm', 'suffers', 'identity', 'hot', 'wife', 'dumps', 'wearing', 'negligee', 'middle', 'street', 'course', 'Will', 'Reed', 'propose', 'Sue', 'will', 'stick', 'Doom', 'Will', 'Johnny', 'ever', 'stop', 'being', 'such', 'card', 'Will', 'Sue', 'ever', 'how', 'turn', 'invisible', 'taking', 'off', 'clothes', 'so', 'FF', 'over', 'attempt', 'be', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'origins', 'cram', 'plot', 'really', 'five', 'stories', 'one', 'film', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'angst', 'unpleasant-looking', 'Thing', 'diminished', 'device', 'cures', 'device', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Doom', 'special', 'powers', 'mysteriously', 'reverse', 'explanation', 'Alba', 'too', 'sexy', 'role', 'hard', 'believe', 'wooden', 'Richards', 'could', 'romance', ""'d"", 'find', 'stilted', 'Von', 'Doom', 'more', 'attractive', 'Richards', 'serious', 'scientific', 'efforts', 'are', 'undermined', 'basically', 'big', 'inflatable', 'balloon', 'fact', 'much', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'involve', 'members', 'FF', 'battling', 'other.The', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'displaying', 'heroes', 'powers', 'Thing', 'simply', 'guy', 'rubber', 'foam', 'Chiklis', 'big', 'not', 'huge', 'man', 'film', 'sometimes', 'remember', 'heavy', 'cumbersome', 'complete', 'thudding', 'footfalls', 'exploding', 'chairs', 'then', 'forgets', 'when', 'inconvenient', 'wooden', 'bench', 'can', 'surely', 'handle', 'massive', 'weight', 'right', 'think', 'lot', 'fans', 'are', 'just', 'happy', 'film', ""n't"", 'first', 'attempt', 'never', 'saw', 'light', 'day', 'bootlegs', 'FF', 'fix', 'prefer', 'theanimated', 'version', 'be', 'hilarious', 'action-packed', 'poking', 'fun', 'utter', 'ridiculousness', 'super-science', 'team', 'consisting', 'talking', 'rock', 'rubber', 'band', 'man', 'invisible', 'woman', 'real', 'flamer']",Fantastic Four

Reed's motives are the good of humanity, Victor's are profit, and he already has squeezed out 75% of the proceeds for himself.  They are supposed to be protected by the space station, but when things goe wrong, they are all exposed to the radiation.  Their DNA is significantly altered, and they soon find themselves with super powers.Reed, Mr. Fantastic, becomes elastic.  Sue, the Invisible Woman, can turn invisible and manipulate force fields.  Ben, the Thing, becomes rock-like with immense strength.  Johnny, the Human Torch, can ignite himself at will and even fly.  Victor, Dr. Doom, goes to the dark side with his ability to manipulate electricity and his development of a metal skin.  They must all deal with this adjustment, contemplate changing themselves back, and facing off against each other four vs. one.The greatest weakness of ""FF"" is that it is an origin story.  Most viewers will want to see some action right away.  Die hard fans of the comic will be dismayed at the alteration of Dr. Doom's origins.  In fact, the origin IS the story, culminating in the big battle to end the film.While no where as good as ""Batman Begins"" or ""Spider-Man 2"", ""FF"" carves out its own niche in the superhero movie world.  True to the comics, the story is mostly lighter in tone with the inter-character humor that fans will expect.  It is an enjoyable popcorn film that does not strive to be more than it is.Acting wise, the cast is pretty good.  Michael Chiklis steals every scene as Ben, weather he is human looking or rocky looking.  He also provides the most moving of stories.  After all, his world is turned upside down by his transformation, and not in a good way.  Ioan Gruffudd is capable as the somewhat boring Reed Richards.

635904,AUSATFDSU2INS,B00005JNTU,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[2, 5]","The Fantastic Four are the latest addition from Marvel heroes to hit the screen. Starring Ioan Gruduff, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Julian McMahon and Michael Chikis, this is just another big, loud, special effects-packed movie with a bland story. Even admitting it is a fun movie to watch, I have to say is just as forgettable as a bad hair day. When compared to Pixar's The Incredibles, a truly magnificent movie, I can't help but realize the Fantastic Four turned their characters into a silly cartoon, while The Incredibles did just the opposite.The Four gain their powers during an accident in space. Mr Fantastic, alias Dr Reed Richards, possesses the properties of an infinitely stretchy rubber band. Sue Storm, his ex girlfriend (not for long) is the Invisible Woman, capable of creating field forces. Her brother, Johnny, is the Human Torch, who has with the ability to combust and turn his body into a heat missile without doing himself the slightest bit of damage and Ben Grimm becomes the Thing, a moving rock pile with a gravel voice, a heart of gold and the strength of Hercules, who is also the group's tragic figure, because unlike the others, he cannot turn his powers on and off.The first half of the movie is pure fun scenes, with the Four learning about their powers, Chris Evans tormenting the Thing, and their whiny complaints about their new changes.The director works very well the moments when the fantastic collides with the everyday. But character is incidental. The film's real business lies in bigness. Blowing things up, driving them off roads and bridges, watching them crumble, freeze and burn.The acting is standard, only because the script doesn't give these actors much to do. The only exception is Michael Chiklis as The Thing, who although covered in that afwful rubber suit is the character best exploited, physically and emotionally. And Julian Mc Mahon, who gets to be the evil Dr Doom, very well casted but they could have get much more from him.Conclusion: This is a fun movie but a very shallow one.

I just saw the DVD last night, expecting the worst (big-time, long-time comic book fan here...) and was pleasantly surprised.Not that some of the vitriol directed toward this film has no basis. It does. As much as I love ""Nip/Tuck"", Julian McMahon has nothing good to do here. I don't like the way they re-imagined Doctor Doom. Actually, I think he would have been great as some regal, European monarch with issues, but all we got was some cliched corporate baddie.Jessica Alba isn't as bad here as say, Sofia Coppola in ""Godfather III"", and she's sure nice to look at...but in terms of character development, she's given the short end of the stick. Yes she looks hot, but she doesn't ""look"" like a Sue Storm...Speaking of, Mr. Fantastic is also malformed, pun intended. His character is also not as interesting as it could have been. He needed more chances to be intelligently heroic...to show off the ""brain"" that Ben Grimm keeps harping about...Enough of the bad mouthing for now...the rest of the film was a blast!Michael Chilis is sublime as The Thing. He's a wonder in that Thing suit. He manages to convey pathos, rage, humor...he's perfect.Chris Evans as the Torch simply rocks. His over-the-top performance served as a nice contrast to the others, and the shenanigans between he and The Thing were right out of the comics. I can understand how he might be irrititating to some viewers, but I kinda think that's the point.Most of the special effects were great as well! I don't know why there's so much venom directed towards the effects. Only the stretching business looks dopey, but the whole Brooklyn Bridge scene is spectacular, the Torch flying is breath-taking and the finale is terrific!The dealing with the public, the coping with the new powers...it was all handled well, with great visuals. Yes, the script isn't as polished or cynical/witty as some may like, but in some cases, simpler is better, and maybe this movie isn't only for us comic geeks...Take a chance on this movie, and I think you're gonna be pleasantly surprised...and if you already think this is going to be a piece of trash, you'll probably be blown away!",4,Hey!

Certainly, young viewers can enjoy it, but so can adults.  I've never understood how everything must be classified.  If there's not a lot of swearing, violence, and nudity then a film must not be adult.  Phooey, I say.  I enjoy swearing, violence, and nudity, but their inclusion in a film doesn't automatically mean it's worthwhile.  Check out SIN CITY for an example.  And if you loved SIN CITY, then you probably won't like this film.  Different strokes for different folks.But Fantastic Four is a good film.  It has well-defined characters, cool special effects, and a fun story.  I've seen it twice so far and both times I enjoyed it.  Nor was I bored the second time at all.  A worthy superhero film that dares to be a little old fashioned but still engaging.There are some flaws however.  There's not enough action.  I'd have loved to seen the FF mixing it up a little more.  The Thing and the Human Torch both look amazing.  And Mr. Fantastic's stretchiness, while always a bit goofy as a power, is presented very well.And Doctor Doom, one of my favorite comic book badguys, gets the short end of the stick.

Jessica Alba is one of the hottest women on the planet and is a nice visual treat that makes up for her decent acting skills. The Human Torch and The Thing were both great in the acting department (loved the back and forth trash talk) and were the best characters in my opinion.

Rent a pizza, have some friends over, watch it with your wife/grilfriend (she owes you one for watching all of her chick flicks) shut down your brain and have a great time.  It's funny, the story is centered around getting to know the characters and their powers and the last fight is short, but really awesome when they stand side by side to confront Dr. Doom.The special effects are pretty good, Human Torch is the best.  The Thing's costume is great, Mr. Fantastic's effects could of been a little better, but they work.  A large portion of the film takes place primarily in Reed's lab while they learn the jest of their powers.The casting could of been a little bit better.  Human Torch/Chris Evans is the best.  The Thing should of been CGI.  Thing is short and stocky, but here he's the smallest out of the four.  He just didn't look big enough in comparison to the comic book Thing.  Julian McMahon is a great choice for Dr. Doom.  I really hated his Doom character so I guess he did his job.  Ioan and Jessica did a good job, not great.  There casting was a bit off.  They don't mesh well onscreen as Reed and Sue.  I just couldn't believe Jessica falling for a guy like Ioan.  Their chemistry just was not there.  If Jessica was cast as Invisible Woman for eye candy and to put some male butts in the seats then it work.  She looks really good in this movie.Any fan of the comic book, or superhero movies in general will enjoy this film.  It gets better everytime I watch it.  It's not one of Marvel's best films, but is better than Elektra and Daredevil PG-13 version.  All cast members seem to understand the comic book film genre and have signed on to return in the sequel.  To me, that is awesome and because of this Fantastic Four is a favorite movie of mine.

635913,AB7W3IO5V7CT0,B00005JNTU,moviewatcher,"[8, 11]","This year's ""Fantastic Four"" has been one of the most anticipated ""comic book to film"" movies.  While the movie isn't always faithful to the comic book and cartoon, it's still an action packed, fact paced thrill ride.The movie starts off with Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) trying to get Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) and his company to finance a space experiment.  The three, along with Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), Reed's former girlfriend, and her brother, Johnny (Chris Evans) all go to the space station together.  Things, of course, go horribly wrong.The result of the botched mission wreaks havoc on everyone's DNA.  Reed, a.k.a., Mr. Fantastic, now has the ability to stretch to extraordinary lengths and contort his body into any shape; Susan, a.k.a. the Invisible Woman, can disappear (with heightened frustration or anger) as well as form and throw force fields; Johnny, a.k.a. the Human Torch, bursts into flame, flies and can throw fireballs; and Ben, a.k.a. The Thing, is transformed into an indestructible, ""Hulk-ish"" figure who is externally and internally solid rock.After an incident on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, the group is thrust into the spotlight and dubbed the ""Fantastic Four"".  However, while trying to work on a remedy to their conditions, a nemesis raises his head in the form of Victor Von Doom who was also affected in space.  The shielding that was protecting him on the space station is slowly becoming part of his skeleton and allowing him to conduct massive amounts of energy.  It's up to the group to stop Doom, who is now bent on revenge against them.One of the pluses of this movie is the cast.  Not only is it a good cast but one filled with fresh faces.  Each person also brings an impressive resume to the movie.  Jessica Alba is really coming into her own with this movie as well as having a starring role in this year's earlier hit, ""Sin City"".  Chris Evans is also an up and comer having appeared in last year's flick, ""Cellular""  Ioan Gruffudd from ""Titanic"" and the ""Horatio Hornblower"" series and Julian McMahon from TV's ""Nip/Tuck"" not only shine in this movie but are also supposedly two of the top contenders to inherit the James Bond role.  Michael Chiklis is also a seasoned actor and has gained exposure as well as an Emmy for his work on ""The Shield"".The pace and the plot in general are also good.  The plot is not overly technical or complicated and carries a nice blend of action and comedy, especially a shaving cr&egrave;me incident between Johnny Storm and the Thing.  The pace of the movie rarely allows for a dull moment.  It keeps your attention from the moment it begins and doesn't let it go until the credits are rolling.What could the movie have worked on? The emotional aspects of the characters could have been drawn out more.  Chiklis, as the Thing, did this well.  However, most people would be a little freaked out if they suddenly burst into flames unexpectedly.  The characters seemed to take these changes as if they were an everyday, normal occurrence.The movie could have shown more and explained the personal relationships between some of the characters.  Was there some sort of relationship between Doom and Susan?  At the beginning there appeared to be but later she said there wasn't.  Was there a particular reason Doom didn't like Reed Richards?  Some background information on that would have been interesting.  It also would have been nice to see more of the friendship between the Thing and his new girlfriend.Supposedly the cast has signed on to film a total of three movies so maybe some of these questions will be answered in time.  However, the ""Fantastic Four"" is a good starting point.  Is it going to be winning a Best Picture Oscar?  No.  But for a fun movie for the entire family, it doesn't get any better than this.",4,Worth the price of admission,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,3851,"['year', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'movies', 'movie', ""n't"", 'always', 'faithful', 'comic', 'book', 'cartoon', 'still', 'action', 'packed', 'fact', 'paced', 'ride.The', 'movie', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'trying', 'get', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'company', 'finance', 'space', 'experiment', 'three', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Reed', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'go', 'space', 'station', 'together', 'Things', 'course', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong.The', 'result', 'botched', 'mission', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'everyone', 'DNA', 'Reed', 'a.k.a.', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'now', 'ability', 'stretch', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'contort', 'body', 'shape', 'Susan', 'a.k.a', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'can', 'disappear', 'heightened', 'frustration', 'anger', 'as', 'well', 'form', 'throw', 'force', 'fields', 'Johnny', 'a.k.a', 'Human', 'Torch', 'flame', 'flies', 'can', 'throw', 'fireballs', 'Ben', 'a.k.a', 'Thing', 'transformed', 'indestructible', 'Hulk-ish', 'figure', 'who', 'externally', 'internally', 'solid', 'rock.After', 'incident', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'New', 'York', 'group', 'thrust', 'spotlight', 'dubbed', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'However', 'trying', 'work', 'remedy', 'conditions', 'nemesis', 'head', 'form', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'affected', 'space', 'shielding', 'was', 'protecting', 'space', 'station', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'part', 'skeleton', 'allowing', 'conduct', 'massive', 'amounts', 'energy', 'up', 'group', 'stop', 'Doom', 'who', 'now', 'bent', 'revenge', 'them.One', 'pluses', 'movie', 'cast', 'Not', 'only', 'good', 'cast', 'one', 'filled', 'fresh', 'person', 'also', 'impressive', 'resume', 'movie', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'really', 'coming', 'own', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'starring', 'role', 'year', 'earlier', 'hit', 'Sin', 'City', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'also', 'up', 'comer', 'having', 'appeared', 'last', 'year', 'flick', 'Cellular', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Titanic', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'series', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'TV', 'Nip/Tuck', 'not', 'only', 'shine', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'supposedly', 'two', 'top', 'contenders', 'inherit', 'James', 'Bond', 'role', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'also', 'seasoned', 'actor', 'gained', 'exposure', 'as', 'well', 'Emmy', 'work', 'Shield', '.The', 'pace', 'plot', 'general', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'plot', 'not', 'overly', 'technical', 'complicated', 'nice', 'blend', 'action', 'comedy', 'especially', 'shaving', 'cr', 'egrave', 'incident', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Thing', 'pace', 'movie', 'rarely', 'dull', 'moment', 'attention', 'moment', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'credits', 'are', 'rolling.What', 'could', 'movie', 'have', 'worked', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'out', 'more', 'Chiklis', 'Thing', 'did', 'well', 'However', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'freaked', 'out', 'suddenly', 'burst', 'flames', 'unexpectedly', 'characters', 'seemed', 'take', 'changes', 'were', 'everyday', 'normal', 'occurrence.The', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'more', 'explained', 'personal', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Was', 'sort', 'relationship', 'Doom', 'Susan', 'beginning', 'there', 'appeared', 'be', 'later', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'Was', 'particular', 'reason', 'Doom', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'background', 'information', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'friendship', 'Thing', 'new', 'girlfriend.Supposedly', 'cast', 'signed', 'film', 'total', 'three', 'movies', 'so', 'maybe', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'answered', 'time', 'However', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'going', 'be', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'No', 'fun', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', ""n't"", 'get', 'better']",Fantastic Four

After the wonderful treatment they did with Spiderman, I thought this has got to be great!...right?... Wrong! Let me start off by saying I did like this movie, but it could have been better. After seeing the film, I went home and dug out an old FF comic and was surprised how close they came to capturing the essence of the comic.Jessica Alba who is great to look is the weakest of the foursome and her chemistry with Reed is not truly believable. The Thing and Torch were spot on, with the exception to the Thing missing his signature rock uni-eyebrow! Mr. Fantastic is played well by Ioan Gruffudd, but I was not too impressed with Doctor Doom's look and story change. I guess, like in the ""Spiderman"" films, some characters don't translate well into a live action movie(Green Goblin).The extended edition is an improvement even though there are a few awkward scenes added with the same dialogue.

635915,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B00005JNTU,mrliteral,"[3, 4]","Among the first comic books I ever bought, nearly 30 years ago, was a Fantastic Four, somewhere around issue 180.  Since then, I have read the comic book off and on for years at a stretch and seen both highs and lows in the series.  In other words, I'm a long-time fan, and when before I saw this movie, I had mixed expectations.  Marvel adaptations have been all over the quality map, from the great Spiderman and X-Men movies, through the so-so Punisher and Hulk, to the wholly forgettable Elektra.This film falls squarely in the middle of this spectrum.  For those unfamiliar with the story, it deals with four people - scientist Reed Richards, his buddy Ben Grimm, Reed's ex-girlfriend Sue Storm and her brother Johnny - who are exposed to cosmic rays and get super powers.  As Mr. Fantastic, Reed can reshape and stretch his body as if it were rubber; Sue becomes the Invisible Girl, who also can create force fields; Johnny is the Human Torch, a living man of flame; and Ben, in a way tragically, becomes the monstrous but superstrong Thing.  Together, they are the Fantastic Four, and unlike most superheroes, they have no secret identities but instead are all well-known to the public.Opposing them is Victor von Doom, who sadly is one of the principal flaws in the movie.  In the comics, Dr. Doom is one of the best all-time villains (probably only behind Lex Luthor and the Joker in comic book villaindom), a genius who uses technology and a touch of the supernatural to commit his crimes.  Dr. Doom was probably a partial inspiration for that great screen villain, Darth Vader.  In this movie, he is superpowered and actually a rather routine villain, a technocrat who seems little more than a retread of the Green Goblin from Spiderman.Michael Chiklis, as always, does a good acting job.  Jessica Alba looks pretty but like most of the rest of the cast, is not all that great at acting.  While reasonably faithful to the comic book concepts of the characters (for example, Reed's intellectualism or Johnny's rashness), the story itself is just so-so.  I suppose a good deal of the problem is so much time is spent on the origin of the FF that we don't get much of the four acting as an actual team.  Perhaps a sequel would work better, as often happens in other comic adaptations; without wasting so much time on the origin story, we can get a better plot.But things aren't all bad.  The effects are good and there are some reasonably amusing or touching moments.  I credit Chiklis with a lot of these, as he makes the Thing the most interesting character (and sometimes the only one) in the movie.  If I seem harsh on this film, I guess it's because I've seen how good the comic could be and see a lot of wasted potential in the movie.  If you're unfamiliar with the comic book, this will probably be a likeable movie, but fans of the comic may be disappointed.",3,Semi-fantastic,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,2874,"['first', 'comic', 'books', 'ever', 'bought', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'somewhere', 'issue', '180', 'then', 'have', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'years', 'stretch', 'seen', 'highs', 'lows', 'series', 'other', 'words', ""'m"", 'long-time', 'fan', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'mixed', 'expectations', 'Marvel', 'adaptations', 'have', 'been', 'quality', 'map', 'great', 'Spiderman', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'so-so', 'Punisher', 'Hulk', 'wholly', 'forgettable', 'Elektra.This', 'film', 'squarely', 'middle', 'spectrum', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'four', 'people', 'scientist', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'buddy', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Reed', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'who', 'are', 'exposed', 'cosmic', 'rays', 'get', 'super', 'powers', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Reed', 'can', 'reshape', 'stretch', 'body', 'were', 'rubber', 'Sue', 'Invisible', 'Girl', 'who', 'also', 'can', 'create', 'force', 'fields', 'Johnny', 'Human', 'Torch', 'living', 'man', 'flame', 'Ben', 'way', 'tragically', 'monstrous', 'superstrong', 'Thing', 'Together', 'are', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'most', 'superheroes', 'have', 'secret', 'identities', 'instead', 'are', 'well-known', 'public.Opposing', 'Victor', 'von', 'Doom', 'who', 'sadly', 'one', 'principal', 'flaws', 'movie', 'comics', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'one', 'best', 'all-time', 'villains', 'probably', 'only', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Joker', 'comic', 'book', 'villaindom', 'genius', 'who', 'technology', 'touch', 'supernatural', 'commit', 'crimes', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'was', 'probably', 'partial', 'inspiration', 'great', 'screen', 'villain', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'movie', 'superpowered', 'actually', 'rather', 'routine', 'villain', 'technocrat', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'retread', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Spiderman.Michael', 'Chiklis', 'always', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'pretty', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'not', 'great', 'acting', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'comic', 'book', 'concepts', 'characters', 'example', 'Reed', 'intellectualism', 'Johnny', 'rashness', 'story', 'just', 'so-so', 'suppose', 'good', 'deal', 'problem', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'origin', 'FF', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'four', 'acting', 'actual', 'team', 'Perhaps', 'sequel', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'often', 'other', 'comic', 'adaptations', 'wasting', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'origin', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'plot.But', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'reasonably', 'amusing', 'touching', 'moments', 'credit', 'Chiklis', 'lot', 'Thing', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'sometimes', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'seem', 'harsh', 'film', 'guess', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'how', 'good', 'comic', 'could', 'be', 'see', 'lot', 'wasted', 'potential', 'movie', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'comic', 'book', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'likeable', 'movie', 'fans', 'comic', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed']",Fantastic Four

There are some great effects here, but that is almost no compliment to make these days.  The characterization was rather flat, pretty predictable, as were the turn-outs of events, but don't think that this is me saying what's wrong with the movie.  As I said, I came in with low expectations, and so it's hard to say that I would have really wanted more.One thing I WAS disappointed in, however, was a bit of a waste of one of my favorite comic books villains--Dr. Doom.  This movie spends so much time setting up the legend of the Fantastic Four that any kind of meaty conflict ends up getting on the back-burner until the last twenty minutes of the movie, and that felt like a little too long to wait.  Many comic book films have made the mistake of taking a huge amount of time to get to any action and instead wallow in a lot of pale, flat character study (ahem...Hulk?).  Maybe it's to set up sequels and keep the movie machine going, but it tends to make the first installment rather pale, and this one is no exception.",2,"ah, hell, let's face it...",1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,1140,"['watched', 'movie', 'low', 'expectations', 'wanting', 'clear', 'backlog', 'movies', 'wanted', 'watch', 'are', 'great', 'effects', 'here', 'almost', 'compliment', 'make', 'days', 'characterization', 'was', 'rather', 'flat', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'were', 'turn-outs', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'saying', 'what', 'wrong', 'movie', 'said', 'came', 'low', 'expectations', 'hard', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'wanted', 'more.One', 'thing', 'WAS', 'disappointed', 'however', 'was', 'bit', 'waste', 'one', 'favorite', 'comic', 'books', 'villains', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'legend', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'kind', 'meaty', 'conflict', 'up', 'getting', 'back-burner', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'wait', 'Many', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'have', 'made', 'mistake', 'taking', 'huge', 'amount', 'time', 'get', 'action', 'instead', 'wallow', 'lot', 'pale', 'flat', 'character', 'study', 'ahem', 'Hulk', 'Maybe', 'set', 'up', 'sequels', 'keep', 'movie', 'machine', 'going', 'make', 'first', 'installment', 'rather', 'pale', 'one', 'exception']",Fantastic Four

I like to think ""Fantastic Four"" is a combination of the two.  While not as impressive plot or effects wise as the near perfect, ""Spiderman 2,"" ""Fantastic Four""  does a very nice job of actively trying to be an entertaining film.  The origin story of the Fantastic Four and their arch-nemesis, Dr. Doom, has been ""dumbed down"" for new-comers to the series, but the basic gist of each character remains enough that true comic fans should at least crack a smile or two for each individual character at some point in this film.  While the portrayal of Reed Richards and Sue Storm are both gag-worthy at times, the Thing and the Human Torch both present more than ample levels of fun to make this film worth watching.  At times it feels as though it should be titled, ""The Fantastic 2 and their cry-baby companions,"" but director Tim Story does such a fast job of story development and action that any mood issues created by the Reed/Sue drama is easily overlooked and the fun of the story can again take center stage.My biggest problem with this film is Dr. Doom.  He looked cool, he looked scary, but Story and company barely provided Doom with any movitation to hate the Fantastic Four as much as he did.  Dr. Doom came across as more of a spoiled 4 year old screaming at his mother in Toys 'R Us because he wanted more Lego's than he came across as a true villain.  He was whiney, foolish, and definitely did not come across as the ""genius"" he was supposed to be.  But again, the movie moves at such a frantic pace that Doom's inability to act like an adult is near forgiveable because of the amount of other ""stuff"" taking place on the screen.This is a fun movie if you're not looking for a movie with a well developed plot or exceptional acting/directing.  It's a perfect ""popcorn"" movie for a boring Friday night, but it's not going to be one that stays in anyone's memory for an overly long period of time.

It was black with white block letters and the apostrophe was in the wrong place like it is in this headline. I felt kind of bad for the kid, because he was obviously oblivious to the error and that made him all the sadder. It wasn't a licensed shirt or anything just something he'd probably thought was cool and went to a t-shirt shop to have done. But whose fault was it, did he transpose it or did the t-shirt shop? And if it was the t-shirt shop did they charge him full price? Did they even realize their error? Are they responsible for proof-reading or did they give him a discount for the mistake and the kid just figured he'd wear it and no one would notice the difference?

However, with so many of the comic to film adaptations trying to be serious and move beyond their source material (i.e. Superman Returns), sometimes it's better to have a comic book movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and just sets out to be something that many films of this type aren't: fun.  And Fantastic Four is certainly mindless fun all the way.  Scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), his ex-girlfriend Sue Storm (a blonde haired and blue contact lens wearing Jessica Alba), her daredevil brother Johnny (Chris Evans), and Reed's longtime friend Ben Grimm (The Shield's Michael Chiklis) are all transformed into the super powered team, who find their hands full with instant celebrity and their evil, super powered nemesis Victor Von Doom (Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon).  The CGI effects are in full effect, the action is campy, and the cast is game (Chris Evans is a nice pick as the hotshot Human Torch), while the makeup and costume effects for the Thing are very well done.  It's loaded with leaps in logic and plot points which are laughable, but that's part of the film's appeal, and that's always been part of the comic's sense of appeal as well.  It works to a point, and Fantastic Four is a fun trip as long as you don't take it seriously or expect anything such as the lofty heights set by X2: X-Men United or Spider-Man 2.

When he sees that Reed Richards has created a machine that hopefully will ""cure"" them all, he tricks Ben into using to become  normal while his powers increase. Then with the Thing out the way, Doom goes after the other three in a big way.

What we have here is human beings (that aren't common to begin with) transformed into super-heroes (and a super-villain that was exactly that before he got his own powers). The plot gives those powers only one important function: to allow or disallow one (men) to get a girl. When Ben is converted into ""The Thing"" his beautiful wife abandons him in a micro-second (now he's ""ugly""). ""The Human Torch"" is all about being hot. ""The Invisible Girl"" is a convenient way of suggesting a naked Jessica Alba more than once (without showing it, because showing nakedness in America means a rating far away from profitability). And the only public or media question about ""Mister Fantastic"" seems to be if all of his body can be flexible (now that I think about it, he could do wonders). The most important motive for the bad guy to be bad is that he wants a girl and another guy gets a shot with her. This guy had the girl at the start because is ""more rich than God"". Disgusting... Like the target public of super-hero comics (pre-teenagers) all what this four men want is to get a date. And for that you need coolnes far from what the human kind has to offer (like a.. oh my.. a personality!).Why not to slowly explore the interesting ramifications of being a super-hero? Why not to explode in an incredible show of super-action? Wait a sec., I saw that movie. Oh, yes, Pixar did it a year ago, I think. Oh, well, doesn't matter.

Anyways, for the review.  I knew when I saw this movie's previews that it was just going to be another dumb action ""blockbuster"" (read: absolute waste of the last 75 million spent). But, since I worked at a movie theatre, I figured I may as well see it for free and simply set my expectations very very low.Well, somehow this movie did not even meet those.  If there had been even a trace of a cast that interacted well, or plot that was more than threadbare, or maybe even if it was just lots of great special effects and good action I would have been happy. Instead I saw plenty of effects, but for what? As we all found out with the star wars prequels, cgi doesnt ensure a great movie.  And this one was no different. F4 made an attempt to latch on to a few sub-plots (who wins the girl wonder, how their super powers affected their loved ones, and who the bigger science genius is) all of them were quite boring and unconvincing as the rest of the flick.  At one point, on a big action scene on a bridge, there is a giant car wreck and only our heros can save them! Oh... but wait, it seems that a group of cop cars have teleported themselves IN FRONT of all the congested traffic. Man, I wish my car could skip mile long traffic jams! Suspension of disbelief falls apart when I am forced to use it so long there is nothing TO believe. Well, my favorite character is the flame. He is the only one who actually had a balance of humor, some conflicts (how to use the new powers) and a change by the end of the movie.

I subjected myself to this punishment because, like a lot of people who grew up with the comic book, I really, really wanted this movie to be top flight.I'm coming to the conclusion that the Fantastic Four, twice turned into a major critical dud (first by Roger Corman), maybe just can't make the leap from comic book into film.I wouldn't expect a Fantastic Four II unless they junk the whole cast, and start anew.  Nobody is impressive in this movie.  Michael Chiklis seems a bit undersized as the Thing (maybe they should have gone the CGI route with this character ?), Ioan Gruffud is just terrible as Mr. Fantastic, and Julian McMahon is far too dapper to portray a believable villain, let alone inhabit the evil Dr. Doom.  People go to superhero movies to be overwhelmed by mythically huge battles between good and evil.

635940,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B00005JNTU,P. Hardy,"[2, 2]","I had some serious misgivings about this film the moment I became aware of its presence. Aside from the fact that the Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four is just as popular this side of Spider-man to the older comic book fanbase and the ULTIMATE fanbase, I seriously doubted that this comic book foursome would adapt into good movie like Blade, X-Men, and Spider-Man had managed to be during the span of the 20th and 21st century. My brother had bought the movie for my father on Christmas and I watched it during dinner. Once again my opinion was rebuked, replaced with Giddiness. Though still retained its misgivings for I had only watched it once. The film throws the characters at you and into their life defying moment without much time for development: They introduce you to Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, Victor Doom, Sue Storm, and Johnny Storm, as though you're supposed to recognize them right off, not really caring about their pasts.This is a small glitch in the system you can jump over . . . slight developments are made later on in the movie (besides you can read the comic books). The plot of the movie manages to stick to formula without straying away with the celebrity moments and humor. In this movie Sue and Richard aren't a happy married couple. More like estranged ex-boyfriend/girlfriend and Sue's an assistant to Victor Von Doom, to mention a major change. The foursome are thrown into media's eyes when an accident on the Brooklyn bridge occurs and they save several people from death in the form of fire and falling over the bridge. Their name --""the fantastic four""-- is given to them by the news and their codenames are beseeched to them by Johnny Storm himself. Throughout all of this newfound chaos, Reed Richards tries to find out how to reverse their Genetic changes to their body, particularly for Ben Grimm who's taking his change and his wife's abandonment hard. Elsewhere, Von Doom tries to come to terms with his changes as well and perhaps use his new found power it to his advantage.I have to commend the choice of actors chosen to be the F4. The chemistry between all five main characters played nicely throughout the movie, never feeling strained or unconvincing for a moment. At first, there were only two actors by which I didn't know by reputation or seen a movie until I remembered the movies ""Cellular"" and ""King Author."" I could hardly recognize Chris Evans with most of his hair shaven off his head or Ioan Gruffudd without curly hair and a beard. While on the subject these two, Gruffudd seemed comfortable in the shoes of down on his luck scientist (or ""Dork"" to Sue) Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, who hasn't ever been my favorite character out of the four, and portrays him awfully well without the over seriousness that comes with maturity and husband mentality persona of the comic books. Christ Evans as my favorite character Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, reminds me more of Ultimate Johnny Storm by perfectly capturing the childish antics and slackish, carefree attitude Storm carries about him. Alba plays a convincing Sue Storm/Invisible Girl upon the aftermath in space, as opposed to her character at the beginning of the movie when she was simply looking to burn Reed Richards while at the same time trying to gain attention from him in her tight outfit. Michael Chiklis -- who usually plays a dirty cop in FX's ""The Shield""-- does Ben Grimm/The Thing justice with an excellent movie portrayal that I think sometimes was riddled with a little too much humor that indeed made me laugh (""Don't do drugs!""). This actor managed to make you feel his anguish of his condition without making you feel like you were watching a soap opera which goes without saying. And lastly Julian McMahon, an actor I dread due to his association with the FX series ""Nip/Tuck"" (shudders), is convincing as a Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom (without the accent) who is literally cut from the corporate ladder and is diagnosed with an incurable ""disease"" (as Reed puts it metaphorically) directly in tie with the other's venture into space. I actually liked him in this role as the F4's greatest adversary and no complaints about his costume change.The CGI graphics for this movie are well done though it cannot be ignored that sometimes they painfully look like just what they are . . . computer generated. This was mainly noticed with Mr. Fantastic's stretching body, which was probably the coolest thing about the movie character wise. The suit for The Thing looked less bulky and bolderish more smooth chiseled, more realistic on Chicklis (whom they say is the actor wearing the Thing Suit if I remember correctly) though I had a problem with the long pants. The graphics used for the Invisible Girl and the Human torch, were fantastic. Alba's body missing from the clothing never looked as though her clothes were hanging on a wire or suffered from clunky frame rate issues. The Human Torch's ""flame on"" graphics were nicely presented on screen though I did have a gripe about Evans mouth which looked a little restrained when he yelps ""Woo-hoo!"" Another problem with movie I had was the short lived Dr. Doom vs. Mr. Fantastic scene. It felt as though something was cut out and not shown in the deleted scenes section. The Score for the movie, done my John Ottman (X2: X-Men United) is 3 star quality at best. While its not supposed to be anything fantastic or award winning in anyway, I think it does a good job with defining moments in the film, though I have to day the vocalist are as bad as they were in X2.Lastly, the DVD's special features are plentiful and should make any special feature-junkie happy, with making of's, casting, audio commentary, video dairy and trailers. The deleted scenes weren't much, they mostly centered around Reed or Sue and Reed's night on the town. The Making of the Fantastic Four movie, really lacked something all the other ""making of""'s I've seen. It was REALLY SHORT, and only hinted at the technical aspects of the film's CGI and so on. The Making a scene section a bit better than the making of. It sorta reminded me of The Matrix Relaoded DVD segment on how they constructed the highway scene. The casting section segment was nothing like I thought it would be. It gave short interviews with the main cast (and Stan Lee, speaking on his cameo) and etc. At the time I had a sneaking suspcion that the MAKING OF section had be divided from it's original format. The Trailers (usually my favorite part of special features) were riddled with expected fantastic four related puns that were really annoying. The video diary - showcasing the cast's trip around the world to promote the movie was pretty interesting.And lastly, the music videos were tiresome and uninspired (though the song ""Come on, come in"" was probably the best song on the FF4 soundtrack, where as ""Everything Burns"" is painfully dull and uninspired. It doesn't beat ""Hero"" by a LONG SHOT). All in all ""FANTASTIC FOUR"" is a good time movie, with charm and balance. Never to be taken to seriously like Elektra, Daredevil, The Punisher (which was good) and The Hulk. -----[4 out of 5]",4,The Fantastic Four is a excellent adaption (with dings in the

Well, mainly character development moments.  Usually I'm not a big fan of non-action character development moments, but in this case, they worked pretty well.  They helped flesh out the characters' lives better with their transition to being ""superheros"".  Some ""finding themselves"" moments really.  Basically the ""should I go out on my own and be a media superstar"" or ""shall I stay part of the team"" type questions, at least for Johnny Storm.  With Ben Grimm it's more of a ""do I want to get back to normal to deal with regular life wants (like girlfriends)?"" or ""do I stay a rock creature and carry out 'clobberin' times'?""  With Reed and Sue, it's relationship stuff.  There's even more Victor von Doom moments, which are also cool.In any case, like I said, the extended cut really doesn't add much action back into the film, but the new character moments do help the film breath a bit more, which was the main flaw of the original theatrical cut.I haven't looked at the second disc yet, but from what I gather just it alone makes this release worth getting.  Also, there's a director's commentary for the film too, so that's always a plus, even though I tend to never listen to them.So if you liked the original theatrical cut enough, and wouldn't mind seeing more stuff that fleshed out the movie a bit more, and are anticipating the sequel, then don't hesitate and pick up this 2-disc extended cut.",5,Correction on runtime from 111 minutes to 126 minutes.,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,1716,"['Always', 'wondered', 'how', 'claimed', 'added', '20', 'minutes', 'back', 'movie', 'original', 'runtime', '106', 'minutes', 'only', 'came', 'up', '111', 'minutes', 'Well', 'wonder', 'more', 'actual', 'runtime', '126', 'mintues', 'well', '125:59', 'so', 'indeed', 'are', '20', 'minutes', 'new', 'material.So', 'what', 'new', 'footage', 'Well', 'mainly', 'character', 'development', 'moments', 'Usually', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'non-action', 'character', 'development', 'moments', 'case', 'worked', 'pretty', 'well', 'helped', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'lives', 'better', 'transition', 'being', 'superheros', 'finding', 'moments', 'really', 'Basically', 'should', 'go', 'out', 'own', 'be', 'media', 'superstar', 'shall', 'stay', 'part', 'team', 'type', 'questions', 'least', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'more', 'do', 'want', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'deal', 'regular', 'life', 'girlfriends', 'do', 'stay', 'rock', 'creature', 'carry', 'out', ""'clobberin"", 'times', 'Reed', 'Sue', 'relationship', 'stuff', 'even', 'more', 'Victor', 'von', 'Doom', 'moments', 'are', 'also', 'cool.In', 'case', 'said', 'extended', 'cut', 'really', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'action', 'back', 'film', 'new', 'character', 'moments', 'do', 'help', 'film', 'breath', 'bit', 'more', 'was', 'main', 'flaw', 'original', 'theatrical', 'cut.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'second', 'disc', 'yet', 'what', 'gather', 'just', 'alone', 'release', 'getting', 'Also', 'director', 'commentary', 'film', 'too', 'always', 'plus', 'even', 'tend', 'never', 'listen', 'them.So', 'liked', 'original', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'enough', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'more', 'stuff', 'fleshed', 'out', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'are', 'anticipating', 'sequel', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'pick', 'up', '2-disc', 'extended', 'cut']",Fantastic Four

They give the origin so you can understand and enjoy the film just as well if you've never read the comic.  The Four are exposed to DNA altering radiation in space, and each exhibits different symptoms manifested as superpowers.  Ben, The Thing, is super strong and tough, appearing as though he's made of rock.  Johnny (Torch) can start fire at will and turn himself into a blazing, flying fireball.  Reed (Stretch) can stretch his body like tough, flexible rubber to indefinite proportions.  Sue, the Invisible Girl, is the invisible girl.  Unfortunately a fifth was exposed, becoming supervillain Doc Doom.  The Thing wants to be changed back to Ben, but Torch wants to exploit their new abilities for fame and fortune.  Reed works to reverse the process, but Von Doom starts interfering for his own motives.

All he has to do is convince billionaire (and nemesis) Victor Van Doom, to help him reach a cosmic storm in order to observe it.  While Victor agrees to the use of his private space station, the price is almost all profit made from this research.  On the space station, Reed and the rest of his team: best friend, Ben Grimm; ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm; her hotshot brother, Johnny Storm; as well as Doom himself, are shocked when something goes amiss and everyone is exposed to the cosmic storm.Back on Earth, they discover that the cloud has altered their DNA, giving each a type of super power.  Reed, Susan, Ben, and Johnny band together in an effort to analyze what has happened to them and find a way to reverse the effects.  Mr. Fantastic: Reed has the ability to stretch and contort his body.  The Invisible Woman: Susan can make herself invisible and create an energy shield.  The Human Torch: Johnny is able to go up in flames- literally- and fly.  The Thing: Ben is now rock-hard and has superhuman strength.  Unfortunately, Van Doom has also been given powers, and unlike the others, decided to use them for evil.  Now he is bent on revenge for the loss of power the cosmic storm fiasco caused and will do anything to destroy Reed and the rest of the `Fantastic Four'.While the Fantastic Four may not be up to the same level as Spider-man was, I still enjoyed seeing it.  The movie itself focused on how the FF got their powers and why they became a team more than anything else.  The villain- Doom- didn't even become really evil until the end.  As with all movie adaptations of comic book heroes, some things were changed, taken, and added to the story, but the effect was the characters seeming more real, which I liked.  The story was a little hurried which made it seem somewhat unbelievable, but then again, the movie is supposed to be `fantastic'.  Overall, Fantastic Four was a good movie, even if it isn't as great as Spider-man, X-men, ect.",5,"5 people changed: 1 became evil, 4 became- fantastic!",1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2028,"['Dr.', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'sure', 'found', 'scientific', 'breakthrough', 'do', 'convince', 'billionaire', 'nemesis', 'Victor', 'Van', 'Doom', 'help', 'reach', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'order', 'observe', 'Victor', 'use', 'private', 'space', 'station', 'price', 'almost', 'profit', 'made', 'research', 'space', 'station', 'Reed', 'rest', 'team', 'best', 'friend', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'hotshot', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'as', 'well', 'Doom', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', 'something', 'amiss', 'everyone', 'exposed', 'cosmic', 'storm.Back', 'Earth', 'discover', 'cloud', 'altered', 'DNA', 'giving', 'type', 'super', 'power', 'Reed', 'Susan', 'Ben', 'Johnny', 'band', 'together', 'effort', 'analyze', 'what', 'happened', 'find', 'way', 'reverse', 'effects', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Reed', 'ability', 'stretch', 'contort', 'body', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'Susan', 'can', 'make', 'invisible', 'create', 'energy', 'shield', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Johnny', 'able', 'go', 'up', 'flames-', 'literally-', 'fly', 'Thing', 'Ben', 'now', 'rock-hard', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'Unfortunately', 'Van', 'Doom', 'also', 'been', 'given', 'powers', 'others', 'decided', 'use', 'evil', 'Now', 'bent', 'revenge', 'loss', 'power', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'fiasco', 'caused', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'destroy', 'Reed', 'rest', 'Fantastic', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'same', 'level', 'Spider-man', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'movie', 'focused', 'how', 'FF', 'got', 'powers', 'why', 'became', 'team', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'villain-', 'Doom-', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'become', 'really', 'evil', 'end', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'things', 'were', 'changed', 'taken', 'added', 'story', 'effect', 'was', 'characters', 'seeming', 'more', 'real', 'liked', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'hurried', 'made', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'fantastic', 'Overall', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'even', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'Spider-man', 'X-men', 'ect']",Fantastic Four

Garrard ""the G-man""","[3, 5]","Considering that in the Marvel history, ""The Fantastic Four"" was the company's first major comic success, this film adaptation is justified; however, following on the heals of the far superior ""Spiderman"" and ""X-men"" films, the movie falls short.  Like those, it spends a great deal of time ""introducing"" the quartet, along with the group's longtime foe, Dr. Doom.  Understandably, some liberties are taken and changes are made to satisfy the movie audience.One of the major changes comes as a result of the respective ages of cast members.  Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Ben Grimm, and Victor Von Doom are supposed to be college classmates; but, the actors playing them fall in three different age brackets: Ioan Grufford (""Reed"") is 32, Michael Chiklis (""Ben"") is 42, Julian McMahon is 37, and Jessica Alba (""Sue"") is a mere 24.  ""Johnny Storm"" is Sue's YOUNGER brother but the actor playing him (Chris Evans) is the same age as Alba.  Perhaps, the actors were the best ones for the respective roles but the age discrepencies contradict the original story line.SPOILER ALERT!The action scenes are too familiar.  The group's first introduction to the New York population on a heavily-trafficked bridge seems as though it was lifted from the first ""Superman"" flick.  The one major battle with Dr. Doom is eerily too similar to ""Superman II"".The Torch's attempt to evade a heat-seeking missile is a bit derivative of all those similar situations in movies that preceded this one.McMahon's ""Dr. Doom"" pales in its villainy to Ian McKellan's ""Magneto"" or even Alfred Molino's ""Doctor Octopus"".  McMahon seems to be trying too hard at the ""evil thing"".Chiklis is believable as ""The Thing"" and Evans possesses enough bravado to bring the hot-headed and immature ""Torch"" to life.The characters, for the most part, are likeable and engaging enough that a sequel is inevitable.Let's just hope that they (the producers) get it a bit more MARVELous the next time.",3,"Well, it has to start somewhere...",1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1949,"['Considering', 'Marvel', 'history', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'was', 'company', 'first', 'major', 'comic', 'success', 'film', 'adaptation', 'justified', 'however', 'following', 'heals', 'far', 'superior', 'Spiderman', 'X-men', 'films', 'movie', 'short', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'introducing', 'quartet', 'group', 'longtime', 'foe', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'Understandably', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'satisfy', 'movie', 'audience.One', 'major', 'changes', 'result', 'respective', 'ages', 'cast', 'members', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'college', 'classmates', 'actors', 'playing', 'fall', 'three', 'different', 'age', 'brackets', 'Ioan', 'Grufford', 'Reed', '32', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Ben', '42', 'Julian', 'McMahon', '37', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Sue', 'mere', '24', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Sue', 'YOUNGER', 'brother', 'actor', 'playing', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'same', 'age', 'Alba', 'Perhaps', 'actors', 'were', 'best', 'ones', 'respective', 'roles', 'age', 'contradict', 'original', 'story', 'line.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'group', 'first', 'introduction', 'New', 'York', 'population', 'heavily-trafficked', 'bridge', 'was', 'lifted', 'first', 'Superman', 'flick', 'one', 'major', 'battle', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'eerily', 'too', 'similar', 'Superman', 'II', '.The', 'Torch', 'attempt', 'evade', 'heat-seeking', 'missile', 'bit', 'derivative', 'similar', 'situations', 'movies', 'preceded', 'one.McMahon', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'villainy', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Magneto', 'even', 'Alfred', 'Molino', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'McMahon', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'evil', 'thing', '.Chiklis', 'believable', 'Thing', 'Evans', 'enough', 'bravado', 'bring', 'hot-headed', 'immature', 'Torch', 'life.The', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'likeable', 'engaging', 'enough', 'sequel', 'inevitable.Let', 'just', 'hope', 'producers', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'MARVELous', 'next', 'time']",Fantastic Four

I was a huge fan of John Byrne's Fantastic Four run, and have enjoyed some of the recent Ultimate Fantastic Four, and there was obvious homage in the script to the characters of old, although I felt it fell just short of nailing them.The cast was good; I originally had doubts about many of them and was surprised to find Jessica Alba, while not the Sue Storm I would have envisioned, did a good job, with the others ranging from also good to a great casting choice in the Thing. Only Doctor Doom disappointed and neither the character nor presence he needed. An Eastern European with some FX on his voice after he donned the infamous mask would have made all the difference.The FX in general were great, especially the Thing make-up and Human Torch imaging, really pushing the boundaries (sometimes straining them with the Mister Fantastic shots). The music did not annoy, but did not stand out either.Not the best of the Marvel adaptations by any stretch (X-Men and Spiderman still hold that distinction), but an enjoyable couple of hours, and something on which a sequel will hopefully improve.

BUT, I've come to anticipate that these studios love to make you buy the disks over and over. Well, I usually get the first version and ignore the rest. Spider-man 2.1? Sorry, not getting my money a second time for a few extra minutes.But F.F. 1? That's a special case. Fearing that people might think that they're ripping off the Incredibles, they cut some footage out of the Fantastic Four. Unfortunate, considering the F.F. predate the Incredibles by over four decades. Be that as it may, I've waited two years for this extra material, including the Kirby doc, etc.This movie was very good and they treated the characters of the F.F. very true to form. the only problem lies with those of us comic fans who know so much about the F.F., that we have trouble accepting the changes in Doc Doom for one thing. The fans get ticked about the total change in Doom's origin and powers. The non-fans don't care and enjoyed him. Tells you something, doesn't it? The hardcore fans usually don't like Sue here because she's not portrayed as the professional hostage or the soccer mom as she is now in the comics. As usual, some of these folks have to open up their mind a bit. This is a younger, single Sue and Alba does a great job. They all do. In fact, I don't think I've ever enjoyed Johnny Storm as much in any incarnation as I did in this film. The interplay between him and Ben is excellent.Speaking of Ben, there's also been a lot of complaints about Ben's 'lack of rockiness'. Well, again, this is in the beginning of their careers when Ben WASn'T as rocky. In the trailer for the second film, they've actually made him rockier and he looks even better. As a die hard F.F. fan for the last 30+ years, I initially had to get around some elements that conflicted with the comic book past as well but I did and after seeing it with more of an open mind on HBO awhile back, I enjoyed Doom a lot more, letting this version stand on it's own merits. Once again, they chan ged his origin so he didn't seem like Darth Vader--a man in a suit of armor--while in reality, Lucas (biggest hack of them all) based Vader on Doom in the first place. Not that any star Wars fan would accept that.In any case, can't recommend this movie highly enough and especially can't wait for F.F. 2.",5,it's about time!,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2357,"['Usually', ""'m"", 'Mr', 'Instant', 'Gratification', 'buying', 'DVD', 'movies', 'like', 'asap', 'BUT', ""'ve"", 'come', 'anticipate', 'studios', 'love', 'make', 'buy', 'disks', 'Well', 'usually', 'get', 'first', 'version', 'ignore', 'rest', 'Spider-man', '2.1', 'Sorry', 'not', 'getting', 'money', 'second', 'time', 'few', 'extra', 'minutes.But', 'F.F', '1', 'special', 'case', 'Fearing', 'people', 'might', 'think', ""'re"", 'ripping', 'off', 'Incredibles', 'cut', 'footage', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Unfortunate', 'considering', 'F.F', 'predate', 'Incredibles', 'four', 'decades', 'Be', 'may', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'two', 'years', 'extra', 'material', 'including', 'Kirby', 'doc', 'etc.This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'treated', 'characters', 'F.F', 'very', 'true', 'form', 'only', 'problem', 'comic', 'fans', 'who', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'F.F.', 'have', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'changes', 'Doc', 'Doom', 'one', 'thing', 'fans', 'get', 'ticked', 'total', 'change', 'Doom', 'origin', 'powers', 'non-fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'enjoyed', 'Tells', 'something', ""n't"", 'hardcore', 'fans', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Sue', 'here', 'not', 'portrayed', 'professional', 'hostage', 'soccer', 'mom', 'now', 'comics', 'usual', 'folks', 'have', 'open', 'up', 'mind', 'bit', 'younger', 'single', 'Sue', 'Alba', 'great', 'job', 'do', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'much', 'incarnation', 'did', 'film', 'interplay', 'Ben', 'excellent.Speaking', 'Ben', 'also', 'been', 'lot', 'complaints', 'Ben', ""'lack"", 'rockiness', 'Well', 'again', 'beginning', 'careers', 'when', 'Ben', ""WASn'T"", 'rocky', 'trailer', 'second', 'film', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'made', 'rockier', 'even', 'better', 'die', 'hard', 'F.F', 'fan', 'last', '30+', 'years', 'initially', 'had', 'get', 'elements', 'conflicted', 'comic', 'book', 'past', 'well', 'did', 'seeing', 'more', 'open', 'mind', 'HBO', 'awhile', 'back', 'enjoyed', 'Doom', 'lot', 'more', 'letting', 'version', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'Once', 'again', 'chan', 'ged', 'origin', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'man', 'suit', 'armor', 'reality', 'Lucas', 'biggest', 'hack', 'based', 'Vader', 'Doom', 'first', 'place', 'Not', 'star', 'Wars', 'fan', 'would', 'accept', 'that.In', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough', 'especially', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'F.F', '2']",Fantastic Four

635957,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JNTU,Robert Moore,"[2, 3]","OK, it is kinda odd to give a movie two-stars and then state that it wasn't as bad as anticipated, but that is the case here.  Friends on the online TV/movie board I post on had universally panned this as one of the worst movies ever and the critics were equally unkind when it came out.  So, I was expecting something utterly awful.  I only decided to see it after finishing rewatching both seasons of DARK ANGEL for a project I'm involved in and wanting to see how Jessica Alba of last summer compares to the Jessica Alba of four years ago.The basic problem is that nothing much really happens.  If a super hero movie involving not one but four super heroes and one super villain isn't an action film, I don't know what is.  But the truth is, this is a pretty boring movie.  Much of the story feels rushed, especially the first fifteen, where the leads are all rushed unceremoniously into space to meet the radiation wave that will transform them all into genetically altered creatures.  All of this happens way too quickly and we don't get any real feel for the way their individual transformations affect them.  A lot of the problem is that the run time is just over a hundred minutes, which is simply too little time to stretch out the narrative properly.  I can understand why they didn't properly introduce us to the characters and develop the story about how they became the Fantastic Four:  they wanted to keep the film short enough to guarantee more showings per day per screen in order to maximize profit.  The film needed at least another forty minutes or so, but that would have meant eliminating one or two showings per day.On various fan boards the remake that is supposed to start filming later this summer is receiving some serious criticism, but I think there is actually a chance that a sequel could be much better than the original.  The group is set up and there is actually a chance now of focusing on a story.  The question is whether they have a decent script.  The Spiderman films, especially the second one, have shown what a good script can mean to a super hero movie.  But Sam Raimi has grasped something that few others working in the genre has:  not special effects but the story is the main thing.  Raimi went out of his way to recruit novelist Michael Chabon (author of THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY, a novel about two comic book writers in the early forties, which won Chabon a Pulitzer Prize) to write the stories for the second and third movies.  Has a similarly strong story been written for the Fantastic Four sequel?  One can hope, but Mark Frost, who wrote the script for this one--and the script was the biggest problem with this film--is writing the sequel.  Frost does not have a good track record.  His lone claim to fame was being co-creator of TWIN PEAKS, but one suspects that the brilliance of that show had more to do with David Lynch than Frost.In an obvious cost-saving move the producers went with TV actors, who usually command far smaller salaries than established film actors.  I love Jessica Alba, who is not only one of the most perfect looking human beings on planet earth, but who seems to be a genuinely nice person, but she isn't the most capable actress in the world.  I am hoping with her winning personality that she can craft a nice movie career.  On a completely superficial level I'd love to see her go back to her natural hair color.  She actually looks better with very dark hair.  She just looks . . . well, odd, with light hair.  It doesn't fit her skin tone or her huge dark eyes.  On a nonsuperficial level, I think she was an asset to the film and since she has enjoyed a surprising amount of success post-FANTASTIC FOUR she is actually the major star in the film.  Still, when she was signed she had almost no film work behind her and was known almost exclusively for having starred in DARK ANGEL and for being one of the world's most beautiful human beings.  Michael Chiklis has established a reputation for being one of the finest actors in television, but has yet to achieve any kind of success in film.  Still, like Alba his price was low compared to others.  Chris Evans was and is an unknown, while Ioan Gruffudd is known primarily for playing Horatio Hornblower on TV.  Julian McMahon, of course, is another television actor, playing the morally challenged plastic surgeon on NIP/TUCK.  My point is that the producers did a great deal to minimize expenses on the film, both keeping salaries low and keeping per day screenings high.There were, of course, a vast number of special effects in the movie, but we are way past the point where special effects can carry a film.  Special effects are only (no pun intended) effective when in the service of the story; a story cannot be used as a clothesline upon which you string special effects.Still, I never found the film impossible or painful to watch.  Mainly I just found myself waiting for the moving to start even as it was coming to an end.  Hopefully they will learn from their mistakes and strive to come up with an interesting story for the sequel.",2,Not nearly as bad as I had expected,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,5097,"['OK', 'kinda',

The biggest reason that this movie was not the success it could have been was a slow plot. The main villain does not really ""come to power"" until about 15 minutes to go. The battle with him is short and boring. Second reason for the mediocrity is the random sequences and sub-plots. What was with the whole motorcycle/X-Games deal? It was a pointless scene, that could have been easily replaced with more plot development. Also, the director looked like he was heading for a sub-plot with Ben Grimm and his wife when she gives him back the wedding ring. I was hoping for a resolution to that, but it never came. Third, this movie followed the whole ""superhero movie"" craze a little to closely. It seemed like the director just took different shots from The Hulk, Spider-Man, etc. and incorporated them into this film.

Part of the fun of seeing a comic book made into a movie is seeing how close the filmmakers can get to the original material. But when they get arrogant and think they can do better than the creators ( STAN ""THE MAN"" LEE & JACK ""KING"" KIRBY), that's when comic book movies fall flat on their over-produced asses. Seriously, all the prints of this movie should be tracked down and destroyed. The only things saving it are the very hot, Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and Michael Chiklis (as the THING). The real weak points here are: the story and the acting.First, there's Doctor Doom. Since when did Doom go into space with the others and get super powers? His power is a combination of science & sorcery. Not cosmic rays. And since when does he have an American accent? Or have a big corporation? He's the tyrannical leader of Latveria. Duh! Most of the acting here is also really bad. As I said, Michael Chiklis is pretty much the only good thing this movie has going for it. This piece of junk ""adaptation"" is just a bunch FX and not much else. They should have learned from Sam Raimi and his two (and counting) SPIDER-MAN films. That's how you do it.

I thought that the casting was quite good.  Ioan Gruffudd was very good as Reed Richards, and Jessica Alba is stunning as Susan Storm.

The real problem with the film is that the heroes spend more time talking about their powers than doing anything very interesting with them.  There's a fairly nifty little fight scene at the end, but it takes way too long to get there for it to be really worth the trip.  On the other hand, there's a breezy quality to some of the writing, particularly in the put-down exchanges between Ben and Johnny, which helps to compensate for the rather sappy conversations between the former lovers, Reed and Sue.

They went through a multitude of changes in those decades. They've gone through even more changes in the decades since. In fact, the entire Marvel Universe was totally changed at least once, from what I hear.I think they did a good job with this movie.

635969,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JNTU,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 5]","This is it, the version of ""Fantastic Four"" that was made with the boat-loads of money the subject deserved, and that the producers actually intended to see the light of day.  So was it worth the wait?  Not quite.In many respects, ""Fantastic Four"" patterns itself on the far superior and more successful ""Spiderman"" - still the standout among superhero movies and especially Marvel Superhero movies.  In this version, the Four are in space doing experiments for the wealthy Viktor Von Doom.  A vain and narrow-minded megalomaniac in the comic, this Doom is a Doom for the 21st century - he's a vain and narrow-minded CEO and (unlike the comic) he's in space with The Four when those crazy cosmic rays attack.  Back on Earth, it doesn't take long for everybody to realize that they've undergone some major life-change.  Hotheaded Johnny Storm becomes ""The Human Torch"".  The somewhat shy Sue becomes ""Invisible Girl"" (""girl?!"" she asks indignantly when first hearing the name).  Ben Grim morphs into ""The Thing"" while Reed Richards becomes the oddly-named ""Mr. Fantastic"".  Of course, nothing in this movie takes long to happen - before you know it, we've got enough dirt on the characters to see where things are going (Reed & Sue's past romance; Ben's rivalry with Johnny) though little in the story explains why the characters act the way they do.  Before you know it, the final battle's been fought, and we get the obligatory sequel-teaser scene.

I was surprised to find it to be really quite decent. The effects are much better than I had heard and the film has no pretensions of being especially deep or meaningful (or at least I hope it doesn't). As with most superhero movies, it sets up this particular franchise for potential sequels by telling the origins, throwing in a love story and having the heroes fight their primary nemesis (in this case, Dr. Doom). It jumps right in without providing much unnecessary background, though some of this does come out over the course of the movie since three of the main characters have shared a love triangle history. I find the Thing's story rather touching without being maudlin. His wife is introduced only to show her rejection of him in this new form, though that is all that is needed. None of the background of Johnny and Sue Storm is provided, aside from a brief mention the two are brother and sister. Would showing anything more of them together add anything to the story? In other words, I consider the movie tight and concise, which is positive. Furthermore, the casting is pretty accurate and it was a wise decision to not cast a big name celebrity, which is the norm for superhero movies, as the enemy. It was also an absolutely brilliant decision to cast Jessica Alba as Sue Storm because she is so gorgeous that I could not take my eyes off her. She certainly adds to my enjoyment of the movie.

Now that that's out of the way....""Fantastic Four"" was better than what the critics gave it credit for.  That is to say that it wasn't criticized justly.  I grew up on the comics of the Marvel Universe, and I know that certain adjustments have to be made in order to adapt it to the big screen (like any other transferred media), but it was an enjoyable watch.  We got the heart of the story and the heart of the team justly played by great actors (I've always been a HUGE Ioin Griffudd fan).  The special effects were done on the relatively cheap side, yet they were good enough to not be snickered at.  I especially loved the Human Torch.  Even good ol' Ben, the ever-lovin', blue-eyed Thing, came off believable, and comic-origin friendly.  After all, Jack Kirby didn't make him ""classic"" until much later.  Until that time, he was as lumpy as he was here.  By the way, it was a marvelous (sorry) casting choice in giving Ben to Michael Chiklis.  Be's been such a great heavy in ""The Sheild"" that everyone's forgotten how gruff-but-good he can be (doesn anyone but me remember ""The Commish?"").Where it was week?  I dunno, maybe this is where I'm too much a stickler for comics continuity, but while Doctor doom was well-played by the deliciously slippery Julian McMahon (see him also in ""Nip/Tuck), would it have KILLED the director to give him a believable Mittel-Eurropean accent?  He was as egomaniacal as in the comic book, and wonderfully smarmy for the 21st century, but it would've been great to see him address himself (like the real-life Donald Trump) in the third person (""blast it!  Every time Doom is in the can!"").Overall, not great when measured with the new classics of the cinematic comic book era, but ""Fantastic Four"" is a great old-fashioned fun time-killer.

Reed Richards is a science geek and a dork and Victor is a wise guy who thinks he owns the world, both out to get the love of Sue Storm (played deliciously by Jessica Alba).With origin stories in comics there is a pretty fast few pages and panels that explain what's going on and it's done.  For a movie though they need to flesh out the characters which I feel they did here.The space scene where Ben is outside and about to get fried and Victor wants to keep him out there shows who we're dealing with in Victor.  All five get powers from the storm (a deviation from the original comics story but that's fine).The action scenes include fights with Von Doom and a lot of falling, water, fire and even guided missles in the works.What works for me in this film are the character development, including the tension of relationships not only between themselves but between themselves and the media.  The media and fans and fads are put into a pretty bright spotlight here.  Not only a comic book  movie but one that relates a message about people as social beings.Not your usual shoot-em-up sci-fi film.""Silver Surfer"" was in a lot of ways the better film but we needed Fantastic Four to lay the groundwork.

635981,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B00005JNTU,Sean Pasek,"[3, 3]","Fantastic Four received a lot of criticism for being to campy, corny, not enough action, etc.  Well, guess what?  Fantastic Four is NOT Batman, Superman, or Spider-Man.  I think those who were expecting it to be were the ones who ended up being disappointed.The Fantastic Four is one of Marvel's oldest comic books.  Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, it was intended to not only be a storyline about superheroes, but a storyline about family.  And that is what much of the Fantastic Four has always been about: family.  This, obviously, largely includes how they interact with each other.In my opinion, the film actually does a pretty good job bringing these popular characters to life.  Part of the success is in the story.  It's a simple story, and sometimes the simple stories are the most successful.The Fantastic Four does not have the complexity of Spider-Man's inner battle with his guilt and shame, nor the psychological complexities of Batman.  Perhaps this is one of the main reasons why the Fantastic Four's fan base is among the most diverse.  Not only is it collected by young boys and men, but also women like it for its relationship values.First of all, the casting is pretty darn good.  They nailed every single one of the characters.  Ioan Gruffud does a good job of playing the highly intellectual, Reed Richards.  Even in the comics, you wonder where Reed's love really lies...with Sue, or science.Jessica Alba was great as Sue Storm.  I had my reservations, at first, but then she loves to play comic-book icons, and she more than nails this role, bringing out Sue's emotional and maternal instincts as well as her toughness when she has to be.Chris Evans was a good choice to play the somewhat reckless Johnny Storm.  He brings a lot of energy to the part, which is necessary to play Johnny.Michael Chiklis is a perfect Ben Grimm.  Apparently, the character was Michael's favorite as a boy.  It's obvious by how accurate he plays the gentle, wounded soul of the Thing who is constantly afflicted his appearance which already robs him of his girlfriend.The interactions between these four characters is really what make the film work.  The banter between Johnny and Ben is fun, which is also true to the comic book as these two characters are always needling each other, even though it's obvious that they love and care about each other.  There is something sweet and touching in the relationship between Sue and Reed as she tries to break through that intellectual shell that he's always behind. They really do feel like a family.The only question of casting I have is Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom.  He just doesn't have that presence that Doctor Doom should have.  Doctor Doom without question is one of Marvel's most feared and iconic ""bad guys,"" and you need something more than what Julian is able to bring to play him.The origin is slightly altered for the film, but it works well.  The only origin that was drastically changed was that of Victor.  In the comic, he wears armor.  He doesn't change into some kind of metallic man.There are action scenes in the film, but again, it's not along the same lines as what you may be used to seeing in comic book film.  The final showdown with Doom in the streets of New York is well done, and not over-the-top like it could have been.I think a lot of fans were duped in by the PG-13 rating, thinking that it was going to be more action-packed and grittier than it is.  If they had gotten a PG rating instead (which it should have if a couple of elements were changed) then expectations may not have gotten so badly out of proportioned.I found this to be a fun and enjoyable film.  I won't lie to you though.  If you're looking for action and grittiness, then the Fantastic Four probably isn't for you, and you might be better off to try something else.But for Marvel's first family comic book, this movie does them pretty well.",4,"Believe it or not, this light fanfare film is fun!",1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,3903,"['Fantastic', 'Four', 'received', 'lot', 'criticism', 'being', 'campy', 'corny', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'etc', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'NOT', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Spider-Man', 'think', 'who', 'were', 'expecting', 'be', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'disappointed.The', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'one', 'Marvel', 'oldest', 'comic', 'books', 'Created', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'was', 'intended', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'storyline', 'superheroes', 'storyline', 'family', 'what', 'much', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'always', 'been', 'family', 'obviously', 'largely', 'how', 'interact', 'other.In', 'opinion', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'popular', 'characters', 'life', 'Part', 'success', 'story', 'simple', 'story', 'sometimes', 'simple', 'stories', 'are', 'most', 'successful.The', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'not', 'have', 'complexity', 'Spider-Man', 'inner', 'battle', 'guilt', 'shame', 'psychological', 'complexities', 'Batman', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'fan', 'base', 'most', 'diverse', 'Not', 'only', 'collected', 'young', 'boys', 'men', 'also', 'women', 'relationship', 'values.First', 'casting', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'nailed', 'single', 'one', 'characters', 'Ioan', 'Gruffud', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'Even', 'comics', 'wonder', 'where', 'Reed', 'love', 'really', 'Sue', 'science.Jessica', 'Alba', 'was', 'great', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'had', 'reservations', 'first', 'then', 'play', 'comic-book', 'icons', 'more', 'nails', 'role', 'bringing', 'out', 'Sue', 'emotional', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'as', 'well', 'toughness', 'when', 'be.Chris', 'Evans', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'play', 'somewhat', 'reckless', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'lot', 'energy', 'part', 'necessary', 'play', 'Johnny.Michael', 'Chiklis', 'perfect', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Apparently', 'character', 'was', 'Michael', 'favorite', 'boy', 'obvious', 'how', 'accurate', 'gentle', 'wounded', 'soul', 'Thing', 'who', 'constantly', 'afflicted', 'appearance', 'already', 'girlfriend.The', 'interactions', 'four', 'characters', 'really', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'banter', 'Johnny', 'Ben', 'fun', 'also', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'needling', 'other', 'even', 'obvious', 'love', 'care', 'other', 'something', 'sweet', 'touching', 'relationship', 'Sue', 'Reed', 'break', 'intellectual', 'shell', 'always', 'behind', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'family.The', 'only', 'question', 'casting', 'have', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'presence', 'Doctor', 'Doom', 'should', 'have', 'Doctor', 'Doom', 'question', 'one', 'Marvel', 'most', 'feared', 'iconic', 'bad', 'guys', 'need', 'something', 'more', 'what', 'Julian', 'able', 'bring', 'play', 'him.The', 'origin', 'slightly', 'altered', 'film', 'well', 'only', 'origin', 'was', 'drastically', 'changed', 'was', 'Victor', 'comic', 'armor', ""n't"", 'change', 'kind', 'metallic', 'are', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'again', 'not', 'same', 'lines', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'used', 'seeing', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'final', 'showdown', 'Doom', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'could', 'have', 'been.I', 'think', 'lot', 'fans', 'were', 'duped', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'action-packed', 'grittier', 'had', 'gotten', 'PG', 'rating', 'instead', 'should', 'have', 'couple', 'elements', 'were', 'changed', 'then', 'expectations', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'badly', 'proportioned.I', 'found', 'be', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'action', 'grittiness', 'then', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'probably', ""n't"", 'might', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'try', 'something', 'else.But', 'Marvel', 'first', 'family', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well']",Fantastic Four

With plenty better movies out this one has no chance. First of all, this movie doesn't even feel like a superhero movie. There's one fight scene in the whole movie! These are supposed to be superheroes. However, movies like Spiderman have proven that you don't need non-stop action to be a good superhero movie. Well, the non-action parts of this movie (99% of it) weren't that great either. A plot is non-existent besides studying a storm, the acting is not convincing, only a couple of the lines that were supposed to be funny are funny, and the characters themselves are boring. The Fantastic Four are not happy with what has happened to them, besides Johnny Storm, and spend most of the movie complaining and blaming each other for it while half-heartedly trying to undo the ""symptoms of their disease."" Johnny Storm spends his time trying to get girls and showing off, but also happens to be the deepest character in the movie. Sorry, but that's just sad. His bickering with The Thing is probably the best part about the movie. Incidentally, without him i would give this movie an F. Dr. Doom is a great villian. His plans go as far as killing the Fantastic Four without ever knowing why. The Fantastic Four themselves become celebreties and there is always a crowd following them outside which ruins the movie. The only fight scene of the movie is poorly done and happens to have minimum contact. I believe the only physical damage was The Thing's punch. Mr. Fantastic and Sue Storm needlessly flirt throughout the movie and everything else seems to be borrowed from Spiderman. The buildings look eerily familiar and I swear I've heard a bad guy get kicked out of his company by the council somewhere else...Oh, and for all those that criticized Jessica Alba's performance, you suck.

I loved comic books when little and really wanted to see the film.Overall it's a great movie if you just want fun that's pretty simple and not too violent and I would recommend this for kids with utmost sincerity. It really is simply a fun film that is really great for kids. There are a variety of super powers and fun special effects, a somewhat touching and kind storyline and good action that's not too violent. If you don't mind just a tiny bit more violence I (not much at all), I would really recommend X2, outstanding movie!!!! And Spiderman 2 is phenomenal as well. However, this review is for this movie, and it's a good movie and worth buying for a gift for people you know.Note: being someone that read comics when I was little and even read more obscure titles like Dr. Strange, Power Pack, Rocket Raccoon, etc... and played the Marvel Universe role playing game and so on, I would not say this is such a great movie for hard-core fans of the original comic. I could write pages why, but other reviewers already have, so please don't hold that against me, this review is to encourage people looking for a fun nice movie for their kids or as a present and think this movie is great in that capacity.Finally, I hope you vote ""Yes"" that my review was helpful, and I hope it was!Take care and good luck shopping!

It's cliched entertainment only past superheroes such as Superman, Batman, and Spiderman used the cliches to make up unique characters that inspired the audience, not bored them to death.The Fantastic Four are four scientists who, after facing an enormous flow of radiation, gain special powers: turning into a ball of fire, going invisible, extending limbs, and becoming a safeguarded body of heavy rock. The film focuses on the scientists trying to return to their normal selves, especially The Thing, whose wife literally divorces him because of his new condition, and suffers social isolation, instead of focusing on the foursome saving the world and fascinating us, the viewers, with demonstrations of their super abilities. Then there's the nemesis Doom, a scientist who was also exposed to the same radiation, whose power is to suck up energy and turn to solid metal.Don't be fooled by the events as I mention them, The Fantastic Four is a silly movie. The plot and the subplots are not coordinated correctly. The Thing's wife never returns to him and there's not a care of trying to win her back either, and the entire love story between The Invisible Girl and Mr. Fantastic is pointless.

Since the, several attempts have been made at adapting this amazing world, rarely with much luck.  I'm sad to say that, in this long-time comic fan's mind, this version doesn't approach meeting my minimum expectations.The plot is relatively close to the comic book origin of the characters.  In this incarnation, Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist, and his lifeling friend and pilot Ben Grimm are trying to fund a space mission during which they hope to harness some sort of cosmic energy.  They go to Reed's old rival Victor von Doom for financial backing.  Victor controls a vast company, and he employs Reed's ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm, also a brilliant scientist.  Victor agrees to the mission, provided he can go as well.  Susan's younger brother Johnny, a hyperactive frat-boy, goes along as well.  As the energy storm passes through the ship, all are changed at a molecular level, each in different ways.  Susan can become invisible, Reed can stretch, Ben has turned into a 'gruesome' rock creature, Johnny can 'flame,' and Victor is evil and magnetic.  Action (supposedly) ensues.The problem that I have with this movie is that the characters are flat, with the exception of Ben Grimm, who would be better is his makeup effects weren't horrible.  Johnnny Storm strikes the right note, as played by Chris Evans, but Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba are sorely miscast.  Alba is vey hot, but I can't buy her as a 'brilliant scientist.'  Julian McMahon doesn't have much to do with Dr. Doom, so he hams it up.  What else could he do?  The character wasn't even supposed to be on the ship in the first place!  The dialogue is mostly mundane, and the effects are hit and miss.  I look forward to someone getting this right as a movie.  This isn't it.

They deliver their lines with so much cheese that the humor and romance seem silly and the drama, action and science-fiction elements seen hokey.

Needless to say I was thrilled when I heard that Marvel decided to make a film of it. Was the movie the best comic adaptation? No. The film was a little too flippant at times, using so much comic relief that it was sort of distracting. And I didn't like Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. He was pretty good before he went evil, but once he was in full Dr. Doom mode, his acting was annoying (the scene when Doom is looking for the Invisible Woman saying ""Marco Polo"" is obnoxious-maybe that kind of acting worked on ""Charmed"" but it shouldn't be happening here Nip/Tuck boy). And why do they have Jessica Alba in those obviously fake blue contact lenses? Perhaps I'm just being picky, but these things were a distraction to me.However, does this mean that this is a bad comic book movie? Not at all. I found it was fun to watch. The story was all right and the action was great. If they make sequels to it, the set up portion is now out of the way. There is real potential now to focus on a stronger story and sharper character developments that would further enhance the franchise.

So are you."" - Johnny Storm still gets the chicks even if he is a flamer & a member of ""The Fantastic Four""Another ""Marvel"" property is taken from the pages of its comic book & transferred to the big screen. But, this time it's the grandaddy of ""Marvel"" characters, ""The Fantastic Four"".A group of scientists rocket into space to study the effects of a cosmic storm, but, due to a miscalculation the team is sent thru the storm, instead of near it.The group survives to find themselves back on Earth in quarintine by their employer, Von Doom Industries. The group seems o.k., but, it isn't soon after that their bodies start to mutate.For Ben Grimm, the co-pilot & space walker of the mission, his body starts to harden into rock while his molecular body structure, & organs change to compensate for the mutation. In otherwords he's completely made of rock inside & out.For lead scientist, Reed Richards, his body has the ability to elongate & stretch to any length or size at any thought or impulse.Richards' colleague, & former fiance, Sue Storm has the power to manipulate invisible shields of energy as well as becoming completely invisible herself.Sue's brother, & pilot of the ship, Johnny Storm has the power of heat & flame & has the ability to place his entire body on fire and fly.But, for Victor Von Doom things aren't so fantastic. The businessman behind this little science experiment has slowly lost his humanity, as his flesh slowly regenerates into solid steel and with this new power can conduct massive amounts of raw energy, dispensing it through his fingertips.Reed trys to find a cure for their mutation (Ben being the most eager for him to find one, since he lost his wife), but, as the movie goes along everyone comes to accept their new selves. Von Doom uses his power to exact revenge on Richards (since he lost his girlfriend who went back to Reed, as well as his empire) by destroying The FF. It's up to Reed, Sue, Johnny, & Ben to stop Victor before he kills them, as well as, destroying the city.""F4"" is an okay film, that can't be compared to the ""Spider-Man"" & ""X Men"" films. Its more in the league between ""Daredevil"" & ""The Shadow"".The film starts off good, but, once everyone gets their powers the film starts to bog down on whether Reed can find a cure to change them back & whether each person really wants to make that change. Von Doom is threatening to a point, until he starts the formulaic kidnapping of one member to lure the others into the trap (lame).The good points of the film are early on when each of the lead characters starts to discover their powers.

Hitchcock raised the bar so high, even he had trouble meeting the public's expectations of his films late in his career. With the phenomenal success of ""Spiderman 2"" and ""X-2"", and the critical success of ""Batman Begins"", we now realize what a `superhero' film can be. They can be dark, filled with believable characters, have interesting and intelligent stories. They can be excellent examples of filmmaking.""Fantastic Four"" isn't any of these things. It has some fun moments, but overall, why bother? There are far better examples out there.Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis, TV's ""The Shield"") visit Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, TV's ""Nip/ Tuck"") at his headquarters. This is a last ditch effort for Reed and Ben to get the funding they need for their studies. Von Doom agrees to let them travel to his space station provided they take Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), Von Doom's current and Richard's ex-girlfriend with them. Susan announces that her brother, Johnny (Chris Evans, ""Cellular"") will be the captain, to the chagrin of Ben, his former Air Force commander. Faster than you can say ""space station"", the five of them arrive. (Yes, Victor has traveled along as well). Almost immediately, the solar storm they traveled to study hits the space stations, zapping them all with it's radioactive waves. Upon their return to Earth, they realize their bodies are changing; Richards, Mr. Fantastic, can stretch his body into any shape, Susan, Invisble Woman, can become invisible at will, Johnny, the Human Torch, can set his body on fire and Ben's, The Thing, body becomes solid stone and he gains incredible strength. Thus, the Fantastic Four are born.""Four"", directed by Tim Story (""Barbershop"", ""Taxi"") has the same tongue-in-cheek attitude that used to be the standard for superhero films. Johnny becomes a publicity hound after they perform their first heroic act as a group. A fireman tells them ""You better get out there and talk to the reporters."" He then asks ""Who's the leader here?"" Johnny responds ""I am"". Fireman: ""No, really."" and he looks at Richards. Think ""Superman"", but not as good. It isn't as good, because nothing is taken very seriously in this film. And there are huge plot holes.Because the serious side of the story is so light, the film is unbalanced. The filmmakers almost seem unconcerned with exposition. One minute, the five of them... First of all, why would Von Doom, the head of a major corporation travel to the space station with them? I don't know. Not explained. As the five of them arrive at the station, the solar storm hits and they seem to be in great danger. Then they are waking up, on Earth, under observation, at Von Doom's facility. How did they end up back on Earth? No explanation is sought or even attempted by anyone. Later, Reed admits that he doesn't understand why the storm affected them, yet he is able to make a machine to counteract the effects. Still later, Ben climbs into the machine, alone, and manages to operate it, when the controls are outside. Because of these holes in the logic and story, the film fails to entirely create a believable universe.There are also many recent examples of using special effects to enhance the story (""Batman Begins"" and ""War Of The Worlds""). ""Four"" has an inherent problem. Three of the four characters could only be created by special effects, and the effects are kind of cheesy. There is simply no other way to show someone stretching their limbs underneath a door, or becoming invisible, or setting themselves on fire. In the case of the Human Torch, the character is completely animated as Chris Evan's features are transformed into flames. These effects are never entirely believable.""Fantastic Four"" is simply an exercise in bringing a comic book to life. Unfortunately, it never transcends above this. It never makes the film worthy of paying full price at a theater.

636018,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00005JNTU,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","When it comes to their characters being adapted for film it seems as if Marvels fortunes have been either hit (Spiderman, X-Men, Blade) or miss (Hulk, Punisher, Daredevil).  The Fantastic Four is a bit of an oddity then...it is squarely in the middle.  A three to four star film with a lot of good and some fair amount of bad.  Directory Tim story and the writers remain pretty faithful to the characters and origins of the characters.  Brilliant Reed Richards leads a team of astronauts into space to study the effects of a cosmic wave.  He's accompanied by his former girl friend Sue Storm, her pilot brother Johnny, and Reeds friend Ben Grimm.  The biggest change to the original origin would be including Victor Von Doom, a wealthy industrialist who is financing the operation as Richards is broke.  The experiment goes awry...the reason for which is never explained...and the group is bombarded by cosmic radiation, which causes each to undergo serious genetic changes.Of course I'm sure you know what powers each has but for the sake of it...Reed becomes Mr. Fantastic who has the ability to stretch his body to incredible lengths, Sue becomes the Invisible Girl who can become...umm...invisible but also make invisible force fields, Johnny becomes the Human Torch who can turn to flame and fly, and Ben becomes the Thing, with a rock like body and superhuman strength.  Of course the fact that Doom gains powers is the biggest difference from the comics and one that was totally unneeded.  Doom is a genius in his own write and didn't need super powers beyond what his own technology could produce.  Doom (Julian McMahon) basically sets out to get revenge on the Fantastic Four who have become media stars, for ruining his company.  The movie unfortunately builds a bit too slow to its climax and the final showdown with Doom.Character wise, the group does a great job of capturing the essence of the early comic series.  The brilliant Richards (Ioan Gruffudd)spends his time tinkering away, trying to find a way to reverse the effects of the cosmic rays, and ignoring Sue, his true love.  Johnny (Chris Evans) is the arrogant, young hotshot, basking in the limelight of his new powers, pulling pranks on the thing, and making deals to produce action figures.  Ben (Michael Chiklis) sulks away lamenting how deformed he's become, hiding himself under a hat and large raincoat.  Anyone who read those early adventures in the 1960's will surely remember a lot of these themes.  Only Jessica Alba as Sue seems a bit out of place and it seems she was merely chosen to be eye candy and yet the blond hair just doesn't look right on her and she looks too young.  The Doom character is the weak link in the film.  They simply did not give him the time to develop and his inclusion in the original space accident comes off as pretentious.The effects are quite well done and don't try and over shadow the picture they way they do in many of these Summer action films.  They were comicly real without being over the top.  Kudos to Story for creating The Thing merely with makeup and appliances and not CGI as they did with the Hulk.  Chiklis brought the kind of humanism to the role of The Thing that always came across so strongly in the stories by Stan Lee (who makes a cameo as Willie Lumpkin, the mailman).  This would not have worked as well if the character had been generated by CGI.I will also say I was somewhat disappointed by the DVD set.  With the great 2 disc sets we got for Spiderman and X-men, I would have like to have seen Marvel's original group of heroes get better treatment on the DVD.  The extras are fine but not nearly enough.Reviewed by Tim Janson",4,FAITHFUL TO THE COMIC...MOSTLY,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,3670,"['When', 'characters', 'being', 'adapted', 'film', 'Marvels', 'fortunes', 'have', 'been', 'hit', 'Spiderman', 'X-Men', 'Blade', 'Hulk', 'Punisher', 'Daredevil', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'bit', 'oddity', 'then', 'squarely', 'middle', 'three', 'four', 'star', 'film', 'lot', 'good', 'fair', 'amount', 'bad', 'Directory', 'Tim', 'story', 'writers', 'remain', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'characters', 'origins', 'characters', 'Brilliant', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'team', 'astronauts', 'space', 'study', 'effects', 'cosmic', 'wave', 'accompanied', 'former', 'girl', 'friend', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'pilot', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Reeds', 'friend', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'biggest', 'change', 'original', 'origin', 'would', 'be', 'including', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'who', 'financing', 'operation', 'Richards', 'broke', 'experiment', 'awry', 'reason', 'never', 'explained', 'group', 'bombarded', 'cosmic', 'radiation', 'undergo', 'serious', 'genetic', 'changes.Of', 'course', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'sake', 'Reed', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'who', 'ability', 'stretch', 'body', 'incredible', 'lengths', 'Sue', 'Invisible', 'Girl', 'who', 'can', 'become', 'umm', 'invisible', 'also', 'make', 'invisible', 'force', 'fields', 'Johnny', 'Human', 'Torch', 'who', 'can', 'turn', 'flame', 'fly', 'Ben', 'Thing', 'rock', 'body', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'course', 'fact', 'Doom', 'gains', 'powers', 'biggest', 'difference', 'comics', 'one', 'was', 'totally', 'unneeded', 'Doom', 'genius', 'own', 'write', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'super', 'powers', 'what', 'own', 'technology', 'could', 'produce', 'Doom', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'basically', 'out', 'get', 'revenge', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'media', 'stars', 'ruining', 'company', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'climax', 'final', 'showdown', 'Doom.Character', 'wise', 'group', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'essence', 'early', 'comic', 'series', 'brilliant', 'Richards', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'time', 'tinkering', 'away', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'reverse', 'effects', 'cosmic', 'rays', 'ignoring', 'Sue', 'true', 'love', 'Johnny', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'arrogant', 'young', 'hotshot', 'basking', 'limelight', 'new', 'powers', 'pulling', 'pranks', 'thing', 'making', 'deals', 'produce', 'action', 'figures', 'Ben', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'away', 'lamenting', 'how', 'deformed', 'become', 'hiding', 'hat', 'large', 'raincoat', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'early', 'adventures', '1960', 'will', 'surely', 'remember', 'lot', 'themes', 'Only', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Sue', 'bit', 'place', 'was', 'merely', 'chosen', 'be', 'eye', 'candy', 'yet', 'blond', 'hair', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'too', 'young', 'Doom', 'character', 'weak', 'link', 'film', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'time', 'develop', 'inclusion', 'original', 'space', 'accident', 'off', 'pretentious.The', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'shadow', 'picture', 'way', 'do', 'many', 'Summer', 'action', 'films', 'were', 'comicly', 'real', 'being', 'top', 'Kudos', 'Story', 'creating', 'Thing', 'merely', 'makeup', 'appliances', 'not', 'CGI', 'did', 'Hulk', 'Chiklis', 'brought', 'kind', 'humanism', 'role', 'Thing', 'always', 'came', 'so', 'strongly', 'stories', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'who', 'cameo', 'Willie', 'Lumpkin', 'mailman', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'generated', 'CGI.I', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', '2', 'disc', 'sets', 'got', 'Spiderman', 'X-men', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'Marvel', 'original', 'group', 'heroes', 'get', 'better', 'treatment', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'fine', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough.Reviewed', 'Tim', 'Janson']",Fantastic Four

636020,AA78TCLHXPJOK,B00005JNTU,Timothy G. Berntsen,"[1, 2]","Of all the superhero movie adaptations released in the last several years, there is one in particular that stands out to me simply because it is so unremarkable. That film is 2005's adaptation of ""The Fantastic 4."" The characters are one dimensional, and the plot is paper thin. I can sum it up as this: 5 scientists go into space and come back with super powers. Four of them decide to become superheroes, and one decides to become a super villain. And then, they fight. That's it. It doesn't even attempt to understand why four people, upon receiving these powers decide they should be super heroes. They do it because that's what people with super powers do, and of course they have a closet full of pre-made superhero costumes that were conveniently written into the plot as being ""next generation astronaut suits."" Yeah, ruddy brilliant guys.There is a sub plot in there about Ben Grim being unhappy with his monstrous new appearance as ""The Thing,"" but the way the writers chose to resolve it ultimately feels ridiculous. Also, Dr. Doom, who is one of the most prolific recurring villains in the entire Marvel universe, is completely neutered in this movie. Comparing this Dr. Doom to his comic book counterpart is like comparing Chad Vader to his big brother Darth. The movie was obviously made in a boardroom of Fox executives trying to figure out how to get as many teenage boys into the theater as possible, because it is also chock full of frivilous extreme sports footage, special effects shots, and meticulously airbrushed women.The only good thing I can say about this movie was that it looked good on Blu-Ray, at a time when I barely had anything to watch in HD. If you're looking for a movie to demo your new home theater with though, there are dozens of movies that look just as good if not better in HD, that aren't textbook examples of what happens when movies get made in by business men.",2,Soulless and generic superhero romp,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,1908,"['superhero', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'released', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'one', 'particular', 'out', 'simply', 'so', 'unremarkable', 'film', '2005', 'adaptation', 'Fantastic', '4', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'plot', 'paper', 'thin', 'can', 'sum', 'up', '5', 'scientists', 'go', 'space', 'come', 'back', 'super', 'powers', 'Four', 'decide', 'become', 'superheroes', 'one', 'become', 'super', 'villain', 'then', 'fight', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'understand', 'why', 'four', 'people', 'receiving', 'powers', 'decide', 'should', 'be', 'super', 'heroes', 'do', 'what', 'people', 'super', 'powers', 'do', 'course', 'have', 'closet', 'full', 'pre-made', 'superhero', 'costumes', 'were', 'conveniently', 'written', 'plot', 'being', 'next', 'generation', 'astronaut', 'suits', 'Yeah', 'ruddy', 'brilliant', 'sub', 'plot', 'Ben', 'Grim', 'being', 'unhappy', 'monstrous', 'new', 'appearance', 'Thing', 'way', 'writers', 'chose', 'resolve', 'ultimately', 'ridiculous', 'Also', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'recurring', 'villains', 'entire', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'completely', 'neutered', 'movie', 'Comparing', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'comic', 'book', 'counterpart', 'comparing', 'Chad', 'Vader', 'big', 'brother', 'Darth', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'boardroom', 'Fox', 'executives', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'many', 'teenage', 'boys', 'theater', 'possible', 'also', 'chock', 'full', 'frivilous', 'extreme', 'sports', 'footage', 'special', 'effects', 'shots', 'meticulously', 'airbrushed', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'looked', 'good', 'Blu-Ray', 'time', 'when', 'barely', 'had', 'anything', 'watch', 'HD', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'demo', 'new', 'home', 'theater', 'though', 'are', 'dozens', 'movies', 'look', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'HD', 'are', ""n't"", 'textbook', 'examples', 'what', 'when', 'movies', 'get', 'made', 'business', 'men']",Fantastic Four

After Spiderman and Batman Begins and The Hulk and...Not that there's anything wrong with these per se. I thought Batman Begins was a great flick and Spiderman, and especially Spiderman 2, had some great character depth. But it seems like the superhero stories invariably either end up camp and crappy, or they're all about the dark and conflicted side of the hero in question. Fantastic Four had great potential here to fall into the `camp' camp and be truly terrible; not quite as bad as the bad old Batman incarnations, but terminally trivial anyway.In the event it wasn't like that at all. It was light fare, all right, and the conflicts, such as there were, weren't in the same class of `darkness' as those in the other movies mentioned. But somewhere along the line FF accomplished something none of the others did: it was unmitigated fun, without becoming camp. I found myself chuckling and actually genuinely liking it. Something about its unpretentious simplicity was incredibly appealing. The relationships of the characters worked. A lot of it-well, almost all-was utterly predictable, but in this instance that was a nice thing. Maybe that's the word here: `nice'. Of all the comic adaptations this one here's the only one qualifying as `nice'.Does it matter? Maybe not. It did for me. Just sit back and enjoy, and don't ask for anything more than it can give.

636024,A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ,B00005JNTU,"Tom Knapp ""Rambles.NET editor""","[7, 13]","I went to see Fantastic Four with low expectations, which allowed me to be pleasantly surprised. While FF was nowhere near the quality of recent Spider-Man and X-Men movies (let's just ignore Daredevil and Hulk), it certainly allows me to believe the Marvel Comics franchise is in good hands.The Fantastic Four is often considered the flagship title for Marvel. In short, a group of friends blast into space for scientific research when they are caught in a cosmic storm that changes their DNA and gives them remarkable powers: invisibility, fire, stony strength and, um, stretchiness.There isn't as much action in the movie as one might expect, but the steady pacing gives characters time to develop and come to grips with their abilities before matching them against their first arch-foe. The movie doesn't have the best dialogue I've heard in a while, but when the cosmic storm hits, the special effects get wickedly cool.Let's look at the team. The brilliant scientist Reed ""Mr. Fantastic"" Richards is neatly played with heavy doses of idealism and social awkwardness by Ioan Gruffudd. Jessica Alba is reserved, even chilly, as the Invisible Woman/Sue Storm, until circumstances force her back into the pliable arms of ex-beau Reed. Chris Evans, as the hotshot Human Torch/Johnny Storm, is flashy and arrogant, having way too much fun with his powers and sudden celebrity. As the mighty, rock-faced Thing/Ben Grimm, Michael Chiklis is a gruff and loyal mook with big muscles, sad eyes and some serious need for a pick-me-up.As for the the villainous Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), he's been reinvented as a handsome and charismatic industrialist. The movie plops Doom in the middle of the action, and his own exposure to cosmic rays soon has him developing super-hard metal skin and tricky new electrical powers. (Still, for all his icy calm and unsatiable ambition, the love triangle set up to create additional tension between him and Reed is cliched and unnecessary.)There's also a fascinating glimpse of those tricky little ""unstable molecule"" outfits the superteam wears. The way my wife elbowed me in the ribs when Sue displayed them, you'd think there was something else to see. (On one of her early attempts to go invisible, Sue flashes a bridge full of bystanders in a lacy bra and panties? Of course, the lingerie was of the ""stable molecule"" variety.)The cast is good all around, and the special effects are expertly applied. So why, when the FF makes its first public appearance -- at a rather spectacular traffic pile-up initially caused by the Thing -- does the public seem completely unsurprised? Have New Yorkers become so jaded by Spider-Man and the X-Men that a rock man, a flame man, a putty man and a beautiful woman in her underwear don't warrant a raised eyebrow?Fantastic Four has garnered plenty of mixed reviews, but I hope the studio doesn't give up on it just yet. Now, with the characters in place and their powers revealed, the team is poised for a more action-packed sequel, and I hope to see this cast return to do the job.",4,Marvel franchise is back in good hands,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,3061,"['went', 'see', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'low', 'expectations', 'allowed', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'FF', 'was', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'recent', 'Spider-Man', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'let', 'just', 'ignore', 'Daredevil', 'Hulk', 'certainly', 'believe', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'franchise', 'good', 'hands.The', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'often', 'considered', 'flagship', 'title', 'Marvel', 'short', 'group', 'friends', 'blast', 'space', 'scientific', 'research', 'when', 'are', 'caught', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'DNA', 'remarkable', 'powers', 'invisibility', 'fire', 'stony', 'strength', 'um', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'steady', 'pacing', 'characters', 'time', 'develop', 'come', 'grips', 'abilities', 'matching', 'first', 'arch-foe', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'while', 'when', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'hits', 'special', 'effects', 'get', 'wickedly', 'cool.Let', 'look', 'team', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'Reed', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Richards', 'neatly', 'played', 'heavy', 'doses', 'idealism', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'reserved', 'even', 'chilly', 'Invisible', 'Woman/Sue', 'Storm', 'circumstances', 'force', 'back', 'pliable', 'arms', 'ex-beau', 'Reed', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'hotshot', 'Human', 'Torch/Johnny', 'Storm', 'flashy', 'arrogant', 'having', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'powers', 'sudden', 'celebrity', 'mighty', 'rock-faced', 'Thing/Ben', 'Grimm', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'gruff', 'loyal', 'mook', 'big', 'muscles', 'sad', 'eyes', 'serious', 'need', 'pick-me-up.As', 'villainous', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'been', 'reinvented', 'handsome', 'charismatic', 'industrialist', 'movie', 'Doom', 'middle', 'action', 'own', 'exposure', 'cosmic', 'rays', 'soon', 'developing', 'super-hard', 'metal', 'skin', 'tricky', 'new', 'electrical', 'powers', 'Still', 'icy', 'calm', 'unsatiable', 'ambition', 'love', 'triangle', 'set', 'up', 'create', 'additional', 'tension', 'Reed', 'cliched', 'unnecessary', 'also', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'tricky', 'little', 'unstable', 'molecule', 'superteam', 'way', 'wife', 'elbowed', 'ribs', 'when', 'Sue', 'displayed', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'see', 'one', 'early', 'attempts', 'go', 'invisible', 'Sue', 'bridge', 'full', 'bystanders', 'lacy', 'bra', 'panties', 'course', 'lingerie', 'was', 'stable', 'molecule', 'variety', 'cast', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'expertly', 'applied', 'So', 'why', 'when', 'FF', 'first', 'public', 'appearance', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'traffic', 'pile-up', 'initially', 'caused', 'Thing', 'public', 'seem', 'completely', 'unsurprised', 'Have', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'become', 'so', 'jaded', 'Spider-Man', 'X-Men', 'rock', 'man', 'flame', 'man', 'putty', 'man', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'underwear', 'do', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'raised', 'eyebrow', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'garnered', 'plenty', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'hope', 'studio', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'just', 'yet', 'Now', 'characters', 'place', 'powers', 'revealed', 'team', 'poised', 'more', 'action-packed', 'sequel', 'hope', 'see', 'cast', 'return', 'do', 'job']",Fantastic Four

Then when the movie comes out, the bad reviews began to come flying out from the critics!!! I got nervous, but then I saw a lot of good reviews from the audience!!! So today, I finally went to see the movie and I was very impressed and shocked to ask myself, ""How the HELL WAS THIS MOVIE HORRILBE!!!"" It was GREAT!!! The cast had great chemistry and the movie flowed well!!! The writing wasn't poor, the acting was good, the special effects were great, the comedy was just right, and everything seemed to fit at the end......SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM!!! Seeing them using their powers was great!!! Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic was very fitting, he portrayed the character like it should have been, Jessica Alba got a lot of flack when people found out she was going to play Susan Strom/Invisible Woman, but she really did a good job and impressed me!!! Chris Evans as Johnny Strom/Human Torch was hilarious as you can tell he really enjoyed playing the role!!! He stole almost every scene he was in!!! Micheal Chicklis, I agree, was born to play Ben Grimm/The Thing!!! His portrayl really made you feel for the character, more than you should have!!! Then lastly, we have The Fantastic 4's infamous nemisis, Victor von Doom aka Dr. Doom played by Julian Mcklain!!! I'm very familar with Julian as he was on The Pratice and Charmed(my favorite show)!! Some critics say that he didn't pull off the role!! But I think he did great as I know for a fact that Julian can play the villian roles very well!!! The movie did kind of rush how they got there powers, but everything after that was just great!!!I don't understand how this movie wasn't as good as Spider-Man or The X-Men like people are saying!!! It had a great balance of drama/humor/action that the other marvel movies had!!! What people don't understand is the Fantastic Four is one of the most unqie superhero stories as it tells a story of a family with super powers!!! They have to deal with trusting each other, understanding each other, and knowing the meaning of maturing and standing up for yourself!!! Peter Parker had to learn this so he could fully become Spider-man remember, just like The Fantastic 4 had too!!! But Spider-man learned it faster because he didn't have 3 other people in his position, he had to work alone!!! The Fantastic 4 had to understand each other as people before they could understand their powers before they could stop Doom, and the film did that very well!!! So to all the people who hated this movie, WATCH IT AGAIN!!! Because it makes me sick seeing all these bad reviews for no reason, it's ridiculous!!! Watch the movie and understand it's true message, don't compare it to other films like Spider-man because that's why you hate it in the first place!!!

636031,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNTU,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","Now there are so many films based on comic books or graphic novels, and Marvel has been playing important role in this trend, with the varies results.  And another one has arrived.  OK, now I've seen it, and I can tell you there are two good news about the live-action filmed version of 'Fantastic Four'1) The film doesn't take itself seriously.  Though the film starts from the ""Episode I"" of FF, Mr. Fantastic, Human Torch, The Thing, and Invisible Woman, the film's tone remains very light-hearted, making a good contrast with 'Batman Begins' or to some extent the same Marvel's film 'Daredevil.'  'FF' does not reach the lofty height of 'Batman' rightly knowing that's not where it should go, but it is at least much better than seeing how Halle Berry became Catwoman and received a golden Razzie award personally.In 'Fantastic Four' we see one failed experiment in outer space turn the five people into rubberball, fireball, rock, invisible woman, and iron man, and they worry so much about their changed bodies, but wait a while.  They soon discover what they can do with their newly acquired ability, and then actions start in the good, old fashion, that is, the good vs the evil.The story is weak, and sometimes 'disasters' happen because of our heroes' own carelessness (which undermines the plot), but the characters are interesting, and Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are all good, especially Evans as Johnny Storm.2) Other good news is that the CGI enhansed actions are reasonable if not perfect.  One of the best effects is huge body of Ben Grimm and his craggy skins, which are much more convincing than those of 'Hulk.'  Equally good is the effects of Human Torch, and added humor (mostly goofy kind) is helpful especially when we see these two characters exchanging some dialogues during their frequent squabble.Less successful is the romance part.  It only slows down the story, and Gruffudd and Alba has no chemistry between them that would make us care their love story.  And some CGIs, those of Mr. Fantastic in particular, need better technique for sometimes the live-action background and CGI created hands or legs, of which movement looks often awkward, just don't merge together.Light-hearted 'Fantastic Four,' often silly and goofy, intentionally goes against the grain, the trend of the comic hero with darker side like 'Spider-man' (another Marvel creation).  I am afraid that 'FF' is too light-hearted, but still enjoyable if you don't expect too high standards.  If you need to see better version of film about four characters with superpower and one bad guy, see 'The Incredibles.'",3,"So-so, Entertaining, Light-Hearted, and Goofy Version of Marvel Comic Adaptaion",1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,2642,"['Now', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'based', 'comic', 'books', 'graphic', 'novels', 'Marvel', 'been', 'playing', 'important', 'role', 'trend', 'varies', 'results', 'one', 'arrived', 'OK', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'two', 'good', 'news', 'live-action', 'filmed', 'version', ""'Fantastic"", 'Four', '1', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'film', 'Episode', 'FF', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Thing', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'film', 'tone', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'making', 'good', 'contrast', ""'Batman"", 'Begins', 'extent', 'same', 'Marvel', 'film', ""'Daredevil"", 'not', 'reach', 'lofty', 'height', ""'Batman"", 'rightly', 'knowing', 'not', 'where', 'should', 'go', 'least', 'much', 'better', 'seeing', 'how', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'became', 'Catwoman', 'received', 'golden', 'Razzie', 'award', 'personally.In', ""'Fantastic"", 'Four', 'see', 'one', 'failed', 'experiment', 'outer', 'space', 'turn', 'five', 'people', 'rubberball', 'fireball', 'rock', 'invisible', 'woman', 'iron', 'man', 'worry', 'so', 'much', 'changed', 'bodies', 'wait', 'while', 'soon', 'discover', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'newly', 'acquired', 'ability', 'then', 'actions', 'start', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'good', 'vs', 'evil.The', 'story', 'weak', 'sometimes', ""'disasters"", 'happen', 'heroes', 'own', 'carelessness', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'Evans', 'Johnny', 'Storm.2', 'Other', 'good', 'news', 'CGI', 'enhansed', 'actions', 'are', 'reasonable', 'not', 'perfect', 'One', 'best', 'effects', 'huge', 'body', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'craggy', 'skins', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', ""'Hulk"", 'Equally', 'good', 'effects', 'Human', 'Torch', 'added', 'humor', 'mostly', 'goofy', 'kind', 'helpful', 'especially', 'when', 'see', 'two', 'characters', 'exchanging', 'dialogues', 'frequent', 'squabble.Less', 'successful', 'romance', 'part', 'only', 'down', 'story', 'Gruffudd', 'Alba', 'chemistry', 'would', 'make', 'care', 'love', 'story', 'CGIs', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'particular', 'need', 'better', 'technique', 'sometimes', 'live-action', 'background', 'CGI', 'created', 'hands', 'legs', 'movement', 'often', 'awkward', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'merge', 'together.Light-hearted', ""'Fantastic"", 'Four', 'often', 'silly', 'goofy', 'intentionally', 'grain', 'trend', 'comic', 'hero', 'darker', 'side', ""'Spider-man"", 'Marvel', 'creation', 'am', 'afraid', ""'FF"", 'too', 'light-hearted', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'high', 'standards', 'need', 'see', 'better', 'version', 'film', 'four', 'characters', 'superpower', 'one', 'bad', 'guy', 'see', ""'The"", 'Incredibles']",Fantastic Four
636032,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JNTU,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 5]","Based upon the comic book series of the same name, FANTASTIC FOUR is a sci-fi action movie about a group of scientists who gain superpowers from a powerful cosmic ray while aboard a laboratory and observation space station above Earth.  Their powers aren't apparent immediately and are dormant upon re-entry.  However, towards the end of their quarantine upon re-entry the five individuals become aware of changes in their bodies:  Dr. Richard Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) has the ability to stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes and takes on the name of Mr. Fantastic; Susan Storm (Jennifer Alba) is Reed's love interest and brother of Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) finds that she is able to become invisible at will and create force fields and is known as the Invisible Woman; Johnny Storm finds he is capable of turning himself into a living human ball of fire and that he can fly and thus calls himself The Human Torch; Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) becomes the most changed of the group having gained superhuman strength and endurance, but through a growth spurt that not only increased his sized but covered his body in giant orange scales that look like rocks.  Also aboard the station at the time of the accident was the man who financed the project, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).  Doom doesn't outwardly acknowledge the changes occurring within him, which basically has to do with his body turning metal and some other secret skills, and blames Reed for allowing the accident to happen, even though Doom was the man at fault.  Of course, Doom was courting Sue Storm, so it doesn't help that Reed is the one who ends up winning her heart.  After revealing to the world their powers, the team tries to find a way to reverse the effects of the cosmic ray while Doom secretly plans to take over the world.FANTASTIC FOUR has some incredible special effects.  Apparently one of the scenes of The Human Torch flying over New York was completely computer generated and took four months to create.  Despite this, the movie is relatively low on action.  There's a major fight sequence at the end, but other than that there's not much.  The reason for this is that the studio behind the film plans on making FANTASTIC FOUR into at least a trilogy and as the first part of the trilogy, this film is intended to set up things that are to come later.I usually don't mention this, but FANTASTIC FOUR has some amazing makeup.  The Thing was not created using CGI, but instead was brought to life the old-fashioned way, through makeup and costuming.  In a day and age when many films completing ignore traditional ways of doing things, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't do that, especially in one that had so many other CGI created effects to begin with.I didn't read very many FANTASTIC FOUR comics, but I had read enough to know the general origins and premise.  The movie stays fairly accurate to the original series (some of the action sequences were taken directly from the original comic books), though some things have been altered to make the film more modern and dramatic (e.g. Doom's presence on Shield at the time of the ""collision).  I was a little disappointed by the lack of action, but overall thought the movie was a good adaptation and a fairly exciting comic book action movie.  FANTASTIC FOUR might not quite be on par with SPIDERMAN, but it's a good opening film about a historic comic book fighting team.",4,Beginnings.,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,3426,"['Based', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'movie', 'group', 'scientists', 'who', 'gain', 'superpowers', 'powerful', 'cosmic', 'ray', 'laboratory', 'observation', 'space', 'station', 'Earth', 'powers', 'are', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'immediately', 'are', 'dormant', 're-entry', 'However', 'end', 'quarantine', 're-entry', 'five', 'individuals', 'become', 'aware', 'changes', 'bodies', 'Dr.', 'Richard', 'Reed', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'ability', 'stretch', 'body', 'incredible', 'lengths', 'shapes', 'name', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Susan', 'Storm', 'Jennifer', 'Alba', 'Reed', 'love', 'interest', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'able', 'become', 'invisible', 'will', 'create', 'force', 'fields', 'known', 'Invisible', 'Woman', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'capable', 'turning', 'living', 'human', 'ball', 'fire', 'can', 'fly', 'thus', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'most', 'changed', 'group', 'having', 'gained', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'endurance', 'growth', 'spurt', 'not', 'only', 'increased', 'sized', 'covered', 'body', 'giant', 'orange', 'scales', 'look', 'rocks', 'Also', 'station', 'time', 'accident', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'financed', 'project', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'Doom', ""n't"", 'outwardly', 'acknowledge', 'changes', 'occurring', 'basically', 'do', 'body', 'turning', 'metal', 'other', 'secret', 'skills', 'blames', 'Reed', 'allowing', 'accident', 'happen', 'even', 'Doom', 'was', 'man', 'fault', 'course', 'Doom', 'was', 'courting', 'Sue', 'Storm', ""n't"", 'help', 'Reed', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'winning', 'heart', 'revealing', 'world', 'powers', 'team', 'find', 'way', 'reverse', 'effects', 'cosmic', 'ray', 'Doom', 'secretly', 'take', 'over', 'world.FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'Apparently', 'one', 'scenes', 'Human', 'Torch', 'flying', 'over', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'completely', 'computer', 'generated', 'took', 'four', 'months', 'create', 'movie', 'relatively', 'low', 'action', 'major', 'fight', 'sequence', 'end', 'other', 'not', 'much', 'reason', 'studio', 'film', 'plans', 'making', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'least', 'trilogy', 'first', 'part', 'trilogy', 'film', 'intended', 'set', 'up', 'things', 'are', 'come', 'later.I', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'amazing', 'makeup', 'Thing', 'was', 'not', 'created', 'using', 'CGI', 'instead', 'was', 'brought', 'life', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'makeup', 'costuming', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'many', 'films', 'completing', 'ignore', 'traditional', 'ways', 'doing', 'things', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'especially', 'one', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'CGI', 'created', 'effects', 'begin', 'with.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'very', 'many', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'comics', 'had', 'read', 'enough', 'know', 'general', 'origins', 'premise', 'movie', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'original', 'series', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'taken', 'directly', 'original', 'comic', 'books', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'modern', 'dramatic', 'e.g', 'Doom', 'presence', 'Shield', 'time', 'collision', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'action', 'overall', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'adaptation', 'fairly', 'exciting', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'movie', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'might', 'not', 'quite', 'be', 'par', 'SPIDERMAN', 'good', 'opening', 'film', 'historic', 'comic', 'book', 'fighting', 'team']",Fantastic Four

My suspicions became true when Fantastic Four released and critics bullied the film.  It's really not good.  The special effects don't even make up for its flaws.  I'm suprised to see that it warranted a sequel, even though it disappointed fans as well as general public.  FF2 was better, but the origin is a poor film, that I keep in my library for the sake of collecting comic book movies.What went wrong: It's mainly targeted for kids.  This = Bad Idea.  Kids didn't really connect with it, because it's older source material that applies to teenagers and adults.  It should have been targeted towards an older audience.Jessica Alba? No, you are not fooling anyone with that blonde hair.  This idea became a large distraction throughout the film.All other supporting cast- Ioan Gruffudd was a quiet Mr. Fantastic with no connection to the character.  He felt as if his accent was troubling his performance, therefore he could not feel the shoes he was in.  Julian McMahon was a cheesy Doom.  That villain deserves so much better.What I happened to like: Humor was spot on.  If you're going to make a F4 film, you have to have the humor between The Thing and Johnny Storm.  None of it felt out of place, they got it right here.Michael Chiklis as The Thing.  Can you really think of someone who could play it better?Broad usage of powers.  I liked that they kept layering the powers throughout most of the scenes, because we can't digress from the point of superhero movies.So it's not good, and you'll only get me to watch it once every 10 blue moons.  I like the sequel much more, even though both of the films are low on the list of good comic book movies.  Hopefully Fox will give the rights back to Marvel, so they can get this film right.  Furthermore, Fox shortchanged us on the Blu-ray release.  Why not put the extended version on blu instead?  The extended cut was much better in my opinion.  All we get on this disc is the theatrical film with one commentary.  If you're planning on getting this for your comic book movie blu-ray collection, get it at a real discount price.

636034,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B00005JNTU,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[2, 2]","A resonable start to the fantastic 4 franchise. The movie is directed well but not as good as the Xmen series . The worst thing about this movie is the soundtrack. The theme music is awful for lack of a better word. The direction by Tim Story is not as good as other super hero movie directors Sam Riami (Spiderman1,2,3), Bryan Singer (Xmen1,2) and Brett Ratner (Xmen3). The problem with 4 unlike xmen and spiderman is that this is one marvel series which stretches things quite a bit and requires a lot of tolerant imagination if you want to move it from a comic book to film. Although the idea of a rubber like stretchy man, a rock man (the thing), a human torch man who can go up in flames/travel at mach3 and a woman who becomes invisible lends itself well to the comic book universe, doing this on a movie screen is very tricky. To do so the director must employ a kind of real world seriousness to the movie like done in xmen and spiderman. The movie must take itself very seriously . These super heros are intrinsically slighly tougher for movie medium to be taken seriously and this gets in the way of the film. This one was atleast ok but the next one : rise of the silver surfer was a complete joke. This series is loosing out because the screenplay has to adapt a certain practicality, logic and plausibility when converting it from comic book to movie and that is not happening. You can't lift the comic book as it is without making changes and hope to make it work as a piece of film where you are going to have the non die hard fantastic 4 and the non die hard comic book fans also viewing the movie.regards, Vikram",3,The movie does not take itself seriously,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1629,"['resonable', 'start', 'fantastic', '4', 'franchise', 'movie', 'directed', 'well', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Xmen', 'series', 'worst', 'thing', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'theme', 'music', 'awful', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'direction', 'Tim', 'Story', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'directors', 'Sam', 'Riami', 'Spiderman1,2,3', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Xmen1,2', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Xmen3', 'problem', '4', 'xmen', 'spiderman', 'one', 'marvel', 'series', 'things', 'quite', 'bit', 'lot', 'tolerant', 'imagination', 'want', 'move', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'idea', 'rubber', 'stretchy', 'man', 'rock', 'man', 'thing', 'human', 'torch', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'up', 'flames/travel', 'mach3', 'woman', 'who', 'invisible', 'lends', 'well', 'comic', 'book', 'universe', 'doing', 'movie', 'screen', 'very', 'tricky', 'do', 'so', 'director', 'must', 'employ', 'kind', 'real', 'world', 'seriousness', 'movie', 'done', 'xmen', 'spiderman', 'movie', 'must', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'super', 'heros', 'are', 'intrinsically', 'slighly', 'tougher', 'movie', 'medium', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'way', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'atleast', 'ok', 'next', 'one', 'rise', 'silver', 'surfer', 'was', 'complete', 'joke', 'series', 'loosing', 'out', 'screenplay', 'adapt', 'certain', 'practicality', 'logic', 'plausibility', 'when', 'converting', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'not', 'happening', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lift', 'comic', 'book', 'making', 'changes', 'hope', 'make', 'work', 'piece', 'film', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'non', 'hard', 'fantastic', '4', 'non', 'hard', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'also', 'viewing', 'movie.regards', 'Vikram']",Fantastic Four
636035,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JNTU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 7]","While ""Four"" wasn't exactly ""Fantastic"" it was an entertaining diversion. I really wanted to like ""Fantastic Four"". I grew up reading the comic book as a kid and enjoyed Jack Kirby's unique artwork and Stan Lee's campy scripts. The film directed by Tim Story tries to recapture the essence of ""Fantastic Four"" and although it doesn't quite measure up to expectations, Story does a better job than I expected. Although ""Fantastic Four"" isn't a classic on the par of ""X-2"", ""Spider-Man 2"" or ""Batman Begins"", it doesn't pretend to be. ""Fantastic Four"" tries to recapture what made ""Spider-Man"" so successful with its mix of comedy, drama and superheroics. It's an enjoyable romp that is as disposable as ""Daredevil"" was. Avoiding the camp of truly bad comic book inspired movies like ""Batman & Robin"", ""Fantastic Four"" works best when the screen is given over to the conflict between Johnny Storm (""The Human Torch"") and Ben Grimm (""The Thing""). Their bickering recalls the formula that worked so well in the comics during their heyday.When NASA turns down his proposal for an experiment in space scientist Reed Richards approachs classmate/ scientist/venture capitalist Victor Von Doom to finance it. Richards wants to go up to Doom's privately funded space station to test the effects of a cosmic storm on living plants. Richards believes that this cosmic storm may have contributed to life evolving on Earth and wants to see what properties the storm has on DNA. Unfortunately, things go wrong when the storm approaches the space station hours ahead of schedule exposing Richards, his friend astronatu Ben Grimm, pilot Johnny Storm, his sister Sue Storm and Von Doom to the effects of the storm.The storm changes them all in ways they could never imagine: Richards becomes elastic able to stretch into any shape; Grimm literally is turned into a superhuman monster with huge rock like scales that protect him and with unnatural strength; Johnny can change into a pillar of fire that can fly; Sue has the ability to generate force fields and turn invisible. This motley crew of dynsfunctional bickering superheroes join forces to become the Fantastic Four. They must face Von Doom who has mutated a form of organic metal that's able to control electricity.While the film quickly jumps right into the action, it does take a while for the plot to move along to the conflict between Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four. Ioan Gruffudd's Richards needed to be better developed as a character and Jessica Biel just wasn't up to the task of playing the underwritten role of Sue Storm. Still, Story manages to come up with a number of strong set pieces making the film memorable if not an outright classic like ""Spider-Man"" or ""Batman Begins"". The humor of the film takes center stage quite often and it does work to the film's advantage. The best visual effects sequeneces are pretty much put on display in the trailer and the CGI seems a bit unfinished at times (such as some of Richards' stretching scenes much as the early CGI Spidey sequences weren't completely convincing in ""Spider-Man"" but there the script and performances were so good you could forgive the shortcomings of the visual effects)where the textures look far too cartoony to be completely convincing. The scenes with The Torch look much more convincing. It's evident that much was cut from the film and it appears choppy at times. If this had been released at the same time as ""Spider-Man"" (or shortly before), it would have been seen as a much more important movie. Following so closely in the wake of ""Batman Begins"" and Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"", ""Fantastic Four"" lacks the truly commanding scope or character development that were so critical to those films. The script credited to Mark Frost (co-creator/writer/producer of ""Twin Peaks"" and Michael France (writer on Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" and tepid ""The Punisher"") runs, pardon the pun, hot and cold. The casting seems dead on (with a few notable exceptions). Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon are perfectly cast (although without enough to do). Gruffudd seems right for the part but, again, character development would have helped his role a bit more.If the film does well at the box office expect a sequel. The good news that, perhaps, they'll bring in a strong writer and perhaps deal with the Galactus/Silver Surfer story line that was so memorable in the 60's. Give the next film to someone with an edgier take on the story, focus on character development a bit more and have a narrative that has the slam-bang action approach of ""X-2"". One of the difficulties with a feature like this is the fact that there are so many characters that need screen time. It can be a challenge to balance that with the action.",3,Trying to recapture the fun of comic book,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,4746,"['Four', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Fantastic', 'was', 'entertaining', 'diversion', 'really', 'wanted', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'comic', 'book', 'kid', 'enjoyed', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'unique', 'artwork', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'campy', 'scripts', 'film', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Story', 'recapture', 'essence', 'Fantastic', 'Four', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'expectations', 'Story', 'better', 'job', 'expected', 'Fantastic', 'Four', ""n't"", 'classic', 'par', 'X-2', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Batman', 'Begins', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'tries', 'recapture', 'what', 'made', 'Spider-Man', 'so', 'successful', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'superheroics', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'as', 'disposable', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'Avoiding', 'camp', 'truly', 'bad', 'comic', 'book', 'inspired', 'movies', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'best', 'when', 'screen', 'given', 'conflict', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'Thing', 'bickering', 'formula', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'comics', 'heyday.When', 'NASA', 'down', 'proposal', 'experiment', 'space', 'scientist', 'Reed', 'Richards', 'classmate/', 'scientist/venture', 'capitalist', 'Victor', 'Von', 'Doom', 'finance', 'Richards', 'go', 'up', 'Doom', 'privately', 'funded', 'space', 'station', 'test', 'effects', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'living', 'plants', 'Richards', 'cosmic', 'storm', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', 'life', 'evolving', 'Earth', 'see', 'what', 'properties', 'storm', 'DNA', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'storm', 'space', 'station', 'hours', 'ahead', 'schedule', 'exposing', 'Richards', 'friend', 'astronatu', 'Ben', 'Grimm', 'pilot', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'sister', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Von', 'Doom', 'effects', 'storm.The', 'storm', 'ways', 'could', 'never', 'imagine', 'Richards', 'elastic', 'able', 'stretch', 'shape', 'Grimm', 'literally', 'turned', 'superhuman', 'monster', 'huge', 'rock', 'scales', 'protect', 'unnatural', 'strength', 'Johnny', 'can', 'change', 'pillar', 'fire', 'can', 'fly', 'Sue', 'ability', 'generate', 'force', 'fields', 'turn', 'invisible', 'motley', 'crew', 'dynsfunctional', 'bickering', 'superheroes', 'join', 'forces', 'become', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'must', 'face', 'Von', 'Doom', 'who', 'mutated', 'form', 'organic', 'metal', 'able', 'control', 'film', 'quickly', 'jumps', 'right', 'action', 'take', 'while', 'plot', 'move', 'along', 'conflict', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Richards', 'needed', 'be', 'better', 'developed', 'character', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'task', 'playing', 'underwritten', 'role', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Still', 'Story', 'come', 'up', 'number', 'strong', 'set', 'pieces', 'making', 'film', 'memorable', 'not', 'outright', 'classic', 'Spider-Man', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'humor', 'film', 'center', 'stage', 'quite', 'often', 'work', 'film', 'advantage', 'best', 'visual', 'effects', 'sequeneces', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'put', 'display', 'trailer', 'CGI', 'bit', 'unfinished', 'times', 'such', 'Richards', 'stretching', 'scenes', 'much', 'early', 'CGI', 'Spidey', 'sequences', 'were', ""n't"", 'completely', 'convincing', 'Spider-Man', 'script', 'performances', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'forgive', 'shortcomings', 'visual', 'effects', 'where', 'textures', 'look', 'far', 'too', 'cartoony', 'be', 'completely', 'convincing', 'scenes', 'Torch', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'evident', 'much', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'choppy', 'times', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'Spider-Man', 'shortly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'movie', 'Following', 'so', 'closely', 'wake', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'truly', 'commanding', 'scope', 'character', 'development', 'were', 'so', 'critical', 'films', 'script', 'credited', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'co-creator/writer/producer', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Michael', 'France', 'writer', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Hulk', 'tepid', 'Punisher', 'pardon', 'pun', 'hot', 'cold', 'casting', 'dead', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'enough', 'do', 'Gruffudd', 'right', 'part', 'again', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'role', 'bit', 'film', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'expect', 'sequel', 'good', 'news', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'strong', 'writer', 'perhaps', 'deal', 'Galactus/Silver', 'Surfer', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'so', 'memorable', '60', 'Give', 'next', 'film', 'someone', 'edgier', 'take', 'story', 'focus', 'character', 'development', 'bit', 'more', 'have', 'narrative', 'slam-bang', 'action', 'approach', 'X-2', 'One', 'difficulties', 'feature', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'need', 'screen', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'challenge', 'balance', 'action']",Fantastic Four

A movie about a superhero TEAM is a different animal.  It's an ensemble film.  Recently the X-men films have gone into that territory, and now we have the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four is more successful than the X-men films because the characters are more fun.  Particularly, the characters of the Human Torch, The Invisible Woman, and The Thing.The Torch, or Johnny Storm, defies the rule that superheroes have to see their powers as a curse.  The Torch WANTS media attention.  He's living out his rock-star dreams of fame and picking up girls.  The other three heroes cringe at his comments to the press, but he knows how to joke with the public and enjoy his newfound hero status.  You go, Torch.The Invisible Woman, Sue Storm, wants Mr. Fantastic, Reed Richards, to just be assertive and commit to her, be a man of action.  I laugh when she calls him a dork early in the film.  He IS a dork because what man in his right mind would let Jessica Alba (Sue Storm) get away when she's clearly waiting for him to wake up and just say he still likes her?The Thing, Ben Grim, is the tragic figure of the group.  He's transformed into a monster while his friends can turn their powers on and off at will.  His girlfriend rejects him when she sees the new Ben Grim.  But even his situation is played for laughs somewhat.  He trades quips with the Human Torch and crumbles Torch's sports car into a big metal beach ball to get even at one point.  He causes a major accident when trying to talk a suicide from jumping from a bridge.  That scene, where the Fantastic Four accidentally goes public with their powers, is where the movie starts to get good.The other two characters, Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom, were less interesting to me.  Mr. Fantastic, Reed Richards, is a thirty-(almost forty?)-something science nerd who still can't talk to girls without talking of therems and astronomy.  Doom is the stereotypical corporate millionare only interested in power (and in marrying Sue Storm).This movie isn't campy but it doesn't take itself too seriously either, another way it proves itself better than X-men.  If it sacrifices something by being an ensemble film instead of following one hero, it's of little concern.  It might even be seen as a nice change of pace from the loner heroes (Spider-man and Batman).

636040,A3HP9JNRHOA5CW,B00005JNTU,William James Taylor IV,"[4, 8]","Not all comic books translate well to the big screen, whether because the material is too complex or too offbeat or because the people handling it just don't know what to do with it or because the powers that be want something that isn't what the source material is at all. And sometimes a comic book movie franchise can start off well but end terribly - see the Superman and Batman films made circa 1978-1987 and 1989-1997 respectively. Meanwhile, ""Spawn"", ""Steel"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" h ave not done too well.So far the X-Men and Spider-Man films, while not without their flaws and weak points, have been very successful and popular with both fans and critics, but other Marvel properties such as Captain America, Daredevil, Elektra, the Incredible Hulk and the Punisher, have only run the gamut from noble failure to complete steaming pile of dog crap. But surely the Fantastic Four should have been one of the more dud proof Marvel properties in the hit or miss summer business, and in a way, they were, for this 2005 film did well enough to be considered a hit and garner a sequel despite poor acting, poor plot, and poor direction from Tim Story. Exactly how this extremely bad adaptation of the superhero quartet that not only single handedly saved Marvel in the 1960s but pave the way for a string of heroes who, for better or worse, would go on to outshine and overshadow them in terms of sales and popularity became a hit is a mystery to me. While not as bad as ""Elektra"" or ""Catwoman"" (oh it hurts to even mention that one), the 2005 Fantastic Four is a failure on most levels (I can only imagine how bad the 1994 version was).Things that are wrong with the film? Well, first of all, the film's biggest weak link is Jessica Alba as Susan 'Sue' Storm, AKA: The Invisible Girl/Woman. Sue Storm is not an ugly, pasty looking Hispanic girl, she is a nice looking Caucasian woman who is at least 30 years old. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Alba is a very bad actress; she couldn't emote to save her life. Whenever she tries to sound tough or passionate or authoritative, she comes across as bland, hollow, dispassionate, and uninspired (it's like watching Natalie Portman in the Star Wars prequel trilogy). When Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) is told he could have any woman in the world but indicates that Sue is very special, it's hard to understand exactly what it is about Sue that he finds so compelling or intriguing or worthy of his evil, twisted lust, since there isn't really much at the core of Sue in this uninspired film translation. And if you think I'm being mean, the British press described Alba's miscasting and poor characterization of Sue as a cross between a whiny, pushy bitch and a hollow lust object - but who in their right mind would find Alba even remotely attractive is beyond me. If they had to go under 30 to cast the Invisible Woman, with the intention of having the Invisible Woman be caught repeatedly with her clothes off, they could have at least hired an actress who was actually good looking, like Amy Smart, Ali Larter or Julia Stiles - Julia Stiles at least projects an Earthiness not seen in most actresses her age. One of the great leading ladies of comic books (alongside Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, Jean Grey and Storm), Sue Storm-Richards deserved better, and so did Ioan Gruffud's Mr. Fantastic.Alba's male co-stars, the aforementioned Ioan Gruffud as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Chris Evans as her younger brother Johnny Storm/Human Torch and Michael Chikilis as Ben Grimm/the Thing, fair much better than she does. Gruffud is an affable, absent minded Reed, but as with Dr. Doom, it's hard to imagine exactly what it is Reed sees in Alba's Sue. Evans does the cocky yet likable young guy thing as well as any other actor his age can. Michael Chikilis is easily the strongest of the four as the cranky, crotchety Thing. If only he'd have clobbered Tim Story...Julian McMahon, meanwhile, is a very poor Dr. Doom. McMahon's Doom is very hollow and empty, lacking the powerful presence, malice, charm and evil incarnate necessary to make Doom register as a threat. And this is Dr. Doom for crying out loud, one of the most famous Marvel villains out there! This guy is to the Fantastic Four what Magneto is to the X-Men, and also a rumored inspiration for Darth Vader of the Star Wars films!A few decent action sequences and a few genuinely funny moments aren't enough to elevate this thing above the garbage that it is. Tim Story, chosen with only the urban comedy ""Barbershop"" as his standout credit, because the Marvel folk wanted to take a change of pace from the gritty, brooding superhero films that dominate so much of today's market, which I can appreciate, but it failed miserably because Story has no knack for subtlety or action sequences. The violence is mildly engaging but hardly exciting, especially since Story failed to properly flesh out the characters enough to make you care as to whether or not they'll survive and save humanity.Just skip it and stick with the comic books.

Um, Jessica Alba was cute. And, um, Jess -- wait, I said that already.The first 3/4 of the movie is mostly nothing. Nothing much happens, then they go to a space station. There's a cosmic storm, and nothing much happens and they go home. Then everyone start turning weird, but nothing much happens. Then there's a big fight and the bad guy loses but he doesn't completely lose so we can have a sequel. The end.Johnny Storm is an insufferable egotist with a forethought horizon measured in milliseconds. Testosterone driven teenaged boys will relate. Sue Storm (Jessica) is the director of bio-something at a billion dollar corporation and fitting mate for gray haired Reed Richards, despite her pouty seventeenish demeanor. Ben Grimm was true to the F4 I remember from years ago, but his lovely romantic interest seemed to be tacked on at the end.

I was excited to see how the technological advances of hollywood would potray the ""WORLD'S GREATEST COMIC MAGAZINE"" which it has been called ever since Marvel has released this comic.This movie I would say was based on, not adapted from the Marvel comic BECAUSE it lacks the spirit, characteristics, and humanity of the comic series, which is why this comic has outsold any comic title by DC for almost 25 years. This movie has Hollywood written all over it.The fabulous foursome behaves like a family. Johnny Storm was never that cocky, Sue didn't behave like a spoiled lovesick woman, Reed was a genius full of confidence and Ben Grimm was the toughest but had more human characteristic of them all. Even DOC DOOM wasn't done right. There was no chemistry between the actors.This movie focuses on character developments, wish they'd have shown more action, it MAY have been a better movie instead of making a mess of each character. THE FANTASTIC FOUR ISN'T ALL ABOUT THE THING, same as the X-men is not all about Wolverine. Hollywood needs to realize this if they intend to make movies true to their  comic book counterparts.I hope they do a better job with the sequel, X2:X-MEN UNITED was a lot better than the first but it still needed work. I hope they make the 2nd Fantastic Four movie better but here's wishing they just stop making movies they think would make money,AND START making movies with quality like SPIDERMAN 2, SIN CITY, THE CROW and BATMAN BEGINS.(movies based on comic books)The bottom line is, if you're A COMIC BOOK FAN, skip this movie.

636044,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JNTU,Wuchak,"[3, 4]","I own FF comics from the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. My first favorite comic as a kid was Fantastic Four; my favorite superhero was The Thing and my favorite villain was Doctor Doom. I was naturally looking foward to this film version.The casting is one of the highlights. I admit that I had my doubts regarding Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and especially Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, but Alba does a fine job and Gruffudd was very much on the mark as ""Mr. Fantastic"" (giggle).  As for the Human Torch and The Thing, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are truly outstanding in their respective roles.What we have to understand is that the film is the ORIGIN story, so the characters are all relatively young here. Reed & Ben are probably only about thirty years old at this time (or slightly older), Sue is in her mid-twenties and Johnny is in his early twenties. Needless to say, don't expect to see a depiction of the Fantastic Four from issue #555!Some have also complained that The Thing is missing his notable rocky eyebrow but, once again, the story takes place when they first get their powers. Those of us who know our FF history know very well that he had no defining eyebrow back then. Only as he mutated over time did the eyebrow appear.What has always separated the Fantastic Four from other comic heros is that they're a FAMILY; and all the character hallmarks of this family are wonderfully depicted in this film: Johnny & Ben's fighting, Hothead's likable show off-ness and arrogance, Reed's great intellect yet total lack of common-sense social skills, The Thing's grumbling struggle over being a monster and outcast, Reed's obsessive attempts to give The Thing back his humanity, as well as his attempts to restrain Ben when he has an understandable temper tantrum, Sue & Johnny's sister/brother bickering, etc.Other notable FF hallmarks are present as well: The Baxter Building, Victor Von Doom, Latveria and Ben's blind girlfriend Alicia Masters. Heck, even mailman Willie Lupkin is here, naturally played by FF creator Stan Lee. Also, Sue Storm's original hero moniker ""the Invisible GIRL"" is even poked fun at.Doctor Doom is perhaps the greatest comics villain of all-time and they picked a very fitting actor for the role, Julian McMahon. As for the idea of linking Doom's origin with the FF members, I don't personally mind this, minor changes are naturally to be expected when changing mediums. Where they went wrong, however, was to fail to show Victor become truly scarred and hideous -- the very reason he came to create and wear the mask and armor. Yes, there was a little scarring but it wasn't enough.Doom's costume is hit-and-miss: the hood and mask look great but the rest of it deviates too far from his great costume in the comics. Still, this was an acceptable alteration.In the comics Doctor Doom had a definite diabolical charismatic presence that would give you goosebumps. There's a little bit of this feeling in the film but it's swept away when the good Doctor SPEAKS. Yes, when Doom talks his dialogue and voice are so wimpy and unthreatening that it pretty much ruins the part. These missteps with the character of Doctor Doom are the sole reasons I give the film 4 Stars instead of 5.Some criticize that the material isn't serious enough, and maybe the creators did go a little overboard here and there with a bit of zaniness, but the overall tone is serious. Make no mistake, although there is a lot of humor (which is an essential part of life), this is not a campy jokefest. People must understand that the FF are a very colorful, fun group of superheroes; they're not dark like Daredevil or Batman. Hence, ""Fantastic Four"" is a fittingly fun, colorful and brisk film, yet it remains an essentially serious story.One thing I fail to comprehend is the ridiculous bashing this film has received. ""Fantastic Four"" is every bit as good as ""X-Men"" which came out in 2000; both films are about the origin of a superhero team. Have we been so spoiled by the great superhero films since then (e.g. Spider-Man 1 & 2, X-Men 2, Daredevil Director's cut, Batman Begins, etc.) that we can no longer recognize or appreciate what is truly a fine comic film? If ""Fantastic Four"" came out in 2000 before ""X-Men"" it would have been deemed a superhero masterpiece.So many people rave about how great ""Spider-Man 2"" is, and it is a very well-done superhero film, but what about that stupid subplot regarding Peter losing his spider-powers because of his lack of confidence? Since when did Peter's spider-powers depend on his confidence? His powers were derived from a radioactive spider bite; hence, his powers would not come-and-go depending on his confidence level! I'm just pointing out that, as good as ""Spider-Man 2"" is, it is not without its flaws.BOTTOM LINE: This is a good and fun film verion of the Fantastic Four. The missteps with Doctor Doom are its only real shortcomings. If you like or love the Fantastic four, or just have a casual interest in them, you'll likely enjoy this flick. If not, why are you reading this?",4,Good Film Depiction of the Fantastic Four,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,5055,"['own', 'FF', 'comics', '60', '70', '80', '90', 'first', 'favorite', 'comic', 'kid',

636045,A1Q15TP2FXYYMF,B00005JNTU,"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo""","[7, 8]","After a succession of dark and/or self-important comic book adaptations, such as batman, sin city, spiderman and the like, fantastic four makes a very refreshing change. It is very bright, lots of colour, and a fun, light-hearted tone, with a plethora of puns and gags which will have you giggling and groaning at the same time.It also makes a refreshing change to see them (eventually) embracing their powers as gifts, and using them and not being shy about remaining anonymous, as most other superheroes will do. This perhaps makes the four seem more human - the public know exactly who they really are. Anyway, this also gives a touch of grounding in realism - guys that looked like that, with powers like that - we'd know all about them surely? It's not like a pair of glasses each would make them Joe (or Josephine) regular, a la Clark Kent (how did Lois buy that for so many years anyway?)But I digress. Ioan Gruffudd manages a competent if rather textbook American accent, and Jessica Alba fulfils her assigned role by being as hot as ever (though why are female scientists always knockouts? They never were in my school!). The stars of the piece though are Michael Chiklis' heartfelt portrayal of the thing, and Julian McMahon camping it up superbly as the villain. Chris Evans (no, not that one!) rounds out the heroic quartet as the arrogant guy who takes full advantage of his fame, cut straight from the template.The special effects are superb (although that comes almost as standard nowadays), and all of our heroes get chance to fully show off their powers, even if some of them have been amplified from the original comics.One criticism of the film is that although running at 1 hour 45 minutes the story was too short in itself, and that most of the film seemed to be all about setting up a series of sequels - as if this was merely the first chapter of the full film. Be that as it may, as a franchise launcher, it has certainly whetted the appetite.

636046,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,B00005JNTU,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[3, 5]","Another ill-conceived superhero movie.  THE FANTASTIC FOUR fails on many levels but mainly it is cheesy in its main parts in terms of script, characters, and special effects. Contributing screenwriter Michael France gets the proverbial ""three-strikes-your-out"" for doing anymore screenwriting for superhero movies. He also wrote HULK and THE PUNISHER (which were critical and financial failures). Now France wrote F4.  Jessica Alba is eye candy and many hard-core comic afficionados and critics felt her ""ethnicity"" (masked by her dyed blond hair) along with her cheesecake looks made her all wrong for the Invisible Girl. However, in this reviewer's opinion, she was just too young to play Sue Storm. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch was cited as having the most to do out of a mediocre script, but is annoyingly juvenile throughout the whole film. Ioan Gruffudd plays Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic as an absent-minded professor and his stretching powers were done awful in the film. The only standout character is that of Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing who plays the orange rocky monstrosity with pathos and heart. However, the designers of The  Thing completely left out the trademark ""big brow"" that goes over his eyes so Grimm/Thing wasn't completely faithful to the comics. Couldn't they add it digitally? Lastly, Dr. Doom played by Julian McMahon is a typical no frills comic book villain. The lame scenes in the film are when the four are thrown into New York City crowds and walk around like they are not supposed to get noticed. Then the heroes get annoyed when they are treated as celebrities or approached by the paparazzi and news media. Overall, a lackluster film that isn't fantastic because of a weak script, questionable casting, weak special effects and terrible characterizations.  At least Marvel has the X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN films to compensate for this lackluster showing. Also, if anyone wants to see a better ""Fantastic Four"" film, just watch Pixar's THE INCREDIBLES, which has more heart, story, action, adventure and characterization than this film.",2,The Mediocre Four,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,2095,"['ill-conceived', 'superhero', 'movie', 'THE', 'FANTASTIC', 'FOUR', 'many', 'levels', 'mainly', 'cheesy', 'main', 'parts', 'terms', 'script', 'characters', 'special', 'effects', 'Contributing', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'France', 'proverbial', 'three-strikes-your-out', 'doing', 'anymore', 'screenwriting', 'superhero', 'movies', 'also', 'wrote', 'HULK', 'THE', 'PUNISHER', 'were', 'critical', 'financial', 'failures', 'Now', 'France', 'wrote', 'F4', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'eye', 'candy', 'many', 'hard-core', 'comic', 'afficionados', 'critics', 'felt', 'ethnicity', 'masked', 'dyed', 'blond', 'hair', 'cheesecake', 'looks', 'made', 'wrong', 'Invisible', 'Girl', 'However', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'young', 'play', 'Sue', 'Storm', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Johnny', 'Storm/The', 'Human', 'Torch', 'was', 'cited', 'having', 'most', 'do', 'out', 'mediocre', 'script', 'annoyingly', 'juvenile', 'whole', 'film', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Reed', 'Richards/Mister', 'Fantastic', 'absent-minded', 'professor', 'stretching', 'powers', 'were', 'done', 'awful', 'film', 'only', 'standout', 'character', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Ben', 'Grimm/The', 'Thing', 'who', 'orange', 'rocky', 'monstrosity', 'pathos', 'heart', 'However', 'designers', 'Thing', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'trademark', 'big', 'brow', 'eyes', 'so', 'Grimm/Thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'faithful', 'comics', 'Could', ""n't"", 'add', 'digitally', 'Lastly', 'Dr.', 'Doom', 'played', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'typical', 'frills', 'comic', 'book', 'villain', 'lame', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'four', 'are', 'thrown', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'crowds', 'walk', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'get', 'noticed', 'Then', 'heroes', 'get', 'annoyed', 'when', 'are', 'treated', 'celebrities', 'approached', 'paparazzi', 'news', 'media', 'Overall', 'lackluster', 'film', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'weak', 'script', 'questionable', 'casting', 'weak', 'special', 'effects', 'terrible', 'characterizations', 'least', 'Marvel', 'X-MEN', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'films', 'compensate', 'lackluster', 'showing', 'Also', 'anyone', 'see', 'better', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'film', 'just', 'watch', 'Pixar', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', 'more', 'heart', 'story', 'action', 'adventure', 'characterization', 'film']",Fantastic Four
