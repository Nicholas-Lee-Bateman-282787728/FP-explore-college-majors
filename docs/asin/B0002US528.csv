845424,A22POV1P58C7HT,B0002US528,J. Johnson,"[13, 14]","After years of reading Lewis' literature, I was pleased to watch this movie about his relationship with Joy Gresham.  (How thrilling she had the same name as I do!)  I have always felt that because I read Lewis throughout my growing up years, his ideology and viewpoint have shaped the very way I think.  I felt that this depiction of Lewis was true to the person he was, the way he thought, and the way he lived.  For much of the movie he continually denies his love for Joy, not so much to others as to himself.  Not being one to let emotions rule him, he had trouble recognizing the depth of his feeling for Joy.  However, when he finally let himself see it, his love for her added depth and dimension to life that he hadn't known was missing, like suddenly seeing a picture in 3-D.  Although that depth brings pain as well as pleasure, he comes to realize that not to have opened himself up to the pain of love is in some way not to have lived.  The depiction of Lewis' loss made me weep, not just for him as for all of us who lose the ones we have let ourselves love.  This movie was both an enjoyable experience and a challenge to accept the fullness that life offers.

LewisThis movie was made before the Anthony Hopkins/Debra Winger version of ""Shadowlands"".  It's pacing and presentation are clearly more British, more BBC.  I appreciated that even though the movies are similar in length, follow the same plot, similar scene progressions, and use identical dialogue at times - this version acted the same dialogue differently.  It's wonderful to see the same material interpreted in good ways. And this movie adds different dialogue.  Including the following:C.S. Lewis:  ""I never knew what I was supposed to say.  What do you say when your mother is dying?""Joy:  ""There's nothing like dying to make you realize you're not in charge.""C.S. Lewis:  ""Yes there is.  Loving someone does that too.""The story is about facing mortality.  Or said another way, facing the loss of life, where the loss is losing the interactive life force of another person you love.C.S. Lewis is speaking with a professor colleague when C.S. Lewis is doing all he can to fight Joy's cancer.  C.S. Lewis, using all his tangible & intangible efforts (the best doctors, the best hospitals, prayer, becoming learned on the medical conditions, etc.), is powerless to effect positive health restoring change for Joy.  And the professor says, ""I've never seen you really want something before.  I was wondering what you'd say if you didn't get it.""In Joy Gresham, C.S. Lewis found someone who had not only considered atheism, religions, & diverse politics intelligently and independently, but he also found someone who understood & interpretted him uncommonly well.  C.S. Lewis had encountered thousands of students, fellow intellectuals, literary critics, and learned fans.  Yet he understood how rare Joy was in interaction with him.In the Debra Winger film, Joy is extremely challenging & critical.  C.S. Lewis eventually appreciates that Joy speaks on the topics everyone else in his circle of friends and family agrees to not challenge him on.  Joy shows him his unspoken cultural, social, & literary boundaries and he slowly and grudgingly admires her loving, yet sometimes uncomfortable honesty.  ""Americans don't understand about inhibitions.""In this BBC version, Joy is portrayed as smart, but she holds her tongue far more.  She is less demanding & challenging.  She still has genuinely rare perspectives and a willingness to spar with him.  Her portrayal seems more consistent with general expectations of women of that generation.I don't know whether Joy was more consistent with either actress' interpretation.  I would guess that for as much as C.S. Lewis appeared to love her and be disarmed by her, she was probably capable of alternating between both ""roles"" for him, adapting with his feedback.  Whoever Joy actually was, he knew the combination of Joy's talents & their genuinely enlightening conversations would be lost forever in her absence.  And while he had a keen mind, great education, and exceptional intelligent social circles, replacing her loss would in the end be impossible.  He could focus on all the other positives available to him and create similar chemistries with others.  He could encourage and grow all those things in her absence, but her absence would always be a unique loss to him intellectually and socially.The movie capably frames the question of:  What do you do when you lose a rare human being you love?  What do you do when you realize that loss will be for the rest of your life?  What are humans to do with that reality, from either religious or atheistic perspectives?  These issues are important because, regardless of religious perspective, they face everyone who has been loved well.While Joy is still aside him, C.S. Lewis says in a radio address, ""Most people know that they want something that cannot be had in this world.  One has a glimpse of a country where everyone there is filled with something we should call goodness, as a mirror is filled with light.  They do not call it goodness.  They do not call it anything.  They are too busy looking at the source from which it comes.  But this is near the stage where the road passes over the rim of our world.  No one's eyes can see very beyond that.""When C.S. Lewis faced losing someone he really wanted to stay in communication with (the loss of his mother, the loss of Joy, the loss of his wife), he wrote.  He found words to say.  Why did he write?  To tell everyone his ideas?  Maybe.  But I give him more credit, intellect, and good intent.  I think he wrote in part to attempt to have a similar effect on the world that those women had on him.  Through his writing, the positive lifeforces of the women in his life and their uncommonly good interchange of oppositions, were possibly shared with others.

In this BBC television special, we find American poet Joy Gresham (Claire Bloom) writing to C.S. Lewis in England. As they discuss ideas about mythical doors and poetry, her letters bring about an intellectual friendship. I love the part where Joy talks about wandering into the wrong houses as she is looking for a home.When C.S. Lewis asks her if she thinks she has found a home, she says she thinks she has. It is very cute and sentimental. The story progresses from a winter of Joy's marriage dying to the full blossoming of her love with C.S. Lewis. The focus of this movie is on the relationship and nothing much is said about any of the books, except there are a few conversations where Joy shows she has a complete knowledge of the books he has written.If you have read ""A Grief Observed"" or if you have an interest in finding out more about C.S. Lewis' personal life, then this will introduce you to the warmth of Joy and the caring nature of C.S. Lewis.If you are looking for information on the life and work of C.S.

Reinert""","[31, 35]","In nearly every way, this television adaptation is more satisfying & certainly better acted than the better known movie of the same name.  As C.S. Lewis, Joss Ackland is far more heartbreaking & believable than Anthony Hopkins.  In the movie, Hopkins does his put-upon somnambulist act that he has used so often before (e.g., ""The Remains of the Day""); Ackland, by contrast, presents a wrenching portrait of a man who awakens to the possibility of love just as that love is snatched away from him.  And it's hard to imagine a finer performance than Claire Bloom's.  She must be the most overlooked actress in the world.  She seems incapable of giving a bad performance.But this television production is marred by the excruciating music throughout.  I wonder what author Wm. Nicholson thought of it when he first heard that ghastly music polluting his beautiful screenplay?  The dreadful score makes the television production very nearly unwatchable.

845436,A15GSO9VNWIF2X,B0002US528,"Truckle ""Fritz""","[4, 4]","I love the film with Anthony Hopkins, but this version seems more real to me.Anthony Hopkins still seems rather good-looking even as an older man.  C.S. Lewis was not good looking, brown teeth through years of smoking.  Joss Ackland looks more nearer the man he's playing, like a pair of well worn slippers.  Claire Bloom, looked like a mature woman whose bloom of youth had faded.  Debra Winger was far too sexy looking.  This version also included both of her boys, Douglas and David.  The boys seemed like normal boys too - not so meek and mild as the boy in the Hollywood film.I liked the format also.  It had that rainy-day Sunday feel about it.  Two old batchelors would have that kind of feel.  Joy Davidman may have swept Lewis off his feet, but he'd still be Lewis and Warnie would still be Warnie - two old batchelors - one just in love.  Anthony Hopkins quacking like Donald Duck to Douglas in one scene of the film, doesn't seem quite right.  I don't think Lewis really knew how to relate to a real child.  Reading Douglas Greshams book, I don't think Lewis or Joy really had much time for the kids - they were just swept up with themselves.This version won't be for everyone.  I liked both for different reasons.",5,C.S.
