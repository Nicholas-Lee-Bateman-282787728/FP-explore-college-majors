1436201,A26FPHC71C5IX3,B00511N7B2,Aryael de Kaprii,"[0, 3]","Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!When there were only whispers about a new show to be created about a woman dealing with multiple personality issues, I was the first voice in my social circle to announce that this would be a great show. When the first advertisments for the show hit magazines and newspapers I grabbed them and pinned them up on my bullentin board as a reminder to watch.  As a huge fan of Toni Collette I was thrilled to see that she would be the star of this new original series and thus I was all the more excited about its premier. Season 1 did not disappoint.  The show was funny, it discussed a serious issue but it stayed upbeat and hilarious all the way through.  I purchased Season 1 and threw a party at my house so that all of my crew could see it and EVERYONE loved it.  A few of my friends and family members went as far as to purchase a Showtime package, just to catch the show when its new seasons premiered. Season 2 was just barely a complete disappointment. Suddenly the show got too serious, it became a drama about a woman suffering from this ailment.  Her homosexual son was falling apart because of his mother's condition and so there just wasnt much to laugh at anymore. I was happy to see Marshall in Season 2 enter into a serious relationship and then I was disappointed to see that relationship fall apart in Season 3.  Is a gay teenage boy in love such a problem that not only did they have to break Marshall and Lionel up, but they had to kill Lionel as well? That sooo did not work for me.Season 3, wow. I laughed, but overall I was still just as disappointed as when I finished Season 2. The ""Alters"" are funny, Eddie Izzard is funny and yet somehow the show managed to dampen all the hilarity.  It is a shame that such a good idea went awire. Tara was a great character and again her Alters are funny, but they were not utilized to their full potential. I love John Corbett, he is great in everything he does, and his character never failed to entertain. I never did get with Brie Larson's character -it always seemed as if she was reaching for her place in the show and never quite getting there. Rosemarie Dewitt's character was weak as well, not as weak as Brie, but still she too was a character reaching and never quite grasping.Marshall -played by Keir Gilchrist -was another character that was interesting, unique and intriging but not used to full capacity.  There was so much going on in Marshall's world and in Marshall's mind his story along side his mother's could have made for a great long lasting series.

1436205,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B00511N7B2,Douglas King,"[2, 2]","Season Three of ""The United States of Tara"" takes a hard, dark turn. The show, one of my favorite cable shows in recent years, has always been unpredictable, and towing a fine line between quirky comedy and dark drama. With Season three, it definitely veers further into dark drama territory.At the end of Season Two, Tara discovered the cause of her DID (horrific early childhood abuse by an older half-brother), and at the beginning of the season, it seems like Tara is ready to move on by returning to college to finish her degree. In the process, she meets an arrogant psychology professor (Eddie Izzard, in one of the show's best guest spots). Tara's relationship with the professor is the season's best storyline, since he starts off a non-believer in Tara's DID, then seeks to use it to advance his own career via an academic paper, and then, eventually, comes to feel genuine concern for Tara as her condition worsens and threatens her very life.In each season, Tara has encountered new alters, and although all add a measure of chaos in her life, this season Tara's latest alter is her abuser, Bryce Crane, the psychopathic teenage half-brother who destroyed her life in the first place. For the first time, Tara has an alter who is more than just chaotic and inconvenient: Bryce, when he appears, seems hell-bent on not only destroying Tara's life, but the lives of everyone around her as well. In this way, the show makes a hugely risky creative leap, by making Tara herself the villain of the show. Bryce is so evil, sadistic, and without conscience that he may as well be a character out of a horror film.Obviously, Tara's danger to herself and others affects her family, who, for the most part, are moving on with their lives more successfully than Tara. Charmaine is now settling down with Neil and her new baby, and although navigating life as a new Mom isn't easy, she seems to be showing new-found maturity. So is Kate, who finds a suitable job as a flight attendant, and falls for a single father. Marshall, now in his late teens, is probably less sympathetic this season than before, because as he starts to bloom as a filmmaker, he also starts becoming more judgmental and obnoxious. (When Tara's condition and a personal tragedy strike, Marshall comes down to earth and his inherent sensitivity seems to return.) Max's main struggle this season seems to be the burden of continuing to be the emotional rock for everyone around him, as well as caretaker for an increasingly destructive and ill wife. Although even his own Mother (Francis Conroy in a good but somewhat wasted cameo) advises him to let Tara go, Max is committed to staying with his wife and children.As the Bryce alter wreaks havoc on everyone's lives, it becomes increasingly unclear what's really going on psychologically. Is Bryce's murder of Tara's other alters a way of cleaning the slate so that Tara can finally live a life on her own? Or is Bryce Tara's way of truly, completely self-destructing? One thing the show has never offered were clear, easy answers when it came to Tara. She's always been a complicated, messy, unpredictable, chaotic character, and Toni Collette's performance has always anchored and elevated the show. Every single outrageous plotline written for her, she's pulled off brilliantly.Since Showtime decided not to renew the series, the third season also serves as the final season, with the last episode serving as not only the season finale, but the series finale as well. Although when the season finale was conceived it was probably up in the air whether or not the show would be back, kudos to the writers for giving the viewers and fans enough closure with the last episode be able to gracefully close the book on this series' somewhat brief, yet entertaining and adventurous, run.",4,Bold,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,3805,"['Season', 'Three', 'United', 'States', 'Tara', 'hard', 'dark', 'turn', 'show', 'one', 'favorite', 'cable', 'shows', 'recent', 'years', 'always', 'been', 'unpredictable', 'towing', 'fine', 'line', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'dark', 'drama', 'Season', 'three', 'definitely', 'further', 'dark', 'drama', 'territory.At', 'end', 'Season', 'Two', 'Tara', 'discovered', 'cause', 'DID', 'horrific', 'early', 'childhood', 'abuse', 'older', 'half-brother', 'beginning', 'season', 'Tara', 'ready', 'move', 'returning', 'college', 'finish', 'degree', 'process', 'arrogant', 'psychology', 'professor', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'one', 'show', 'best', 'guest', 'spots', 'Tara', 'relationship', 'professor', 'season', 'best', 'storyline', 'non-believer', 'Tara', 'DID', 'then', 'use', 'advance', 'own', 'career', 'academic', 'paper', 'then', 'eventually', 'feel', 'genuine', 'concern', 'Tara', 'condition', 'worsens', 'very', 'life.In', 'season', 'Tara', 'encountered', 'new', 'alters', 'add', 'measure', 'chaos', 'life', 'season', 'Tara', 'latest', 'alter', 'abuser', 'Bryce', 'Crane', 'psychopathic', 'teenage', 'half-brother', 'who', 'destroyed', 'life', 'first', 'place', 'first', 'time', 'Tara', 'alter', 'who', 'more', 'just', 'chaotic', 'inconvenient', 'Bryce', 'when', 'hell-bent', 'not', 'only', 'destroying', 'Tara', 'life', 'lives', 'everyone', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'show', 'hugely', 'risky', 'creative', 'leap', 'making', 'Tara', 'villain', 'show', 'Bryce', 'so', 'evil', 'sadistic', 'conscience', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'character', 'horror', 'film.Obviously', 'Tara', 'danger', 'herself', 'others', 'family', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'moving', 'lives', 'more', 'successfully', 'Tara', 'Charmaine', 'now', 'settling', 'down', 'Neil', 'new', 'baby', 'navigating', 'life', 'new', 'Mom', ""n't"", 'easy', 'be', 'showing', 'new-found', 'maturity', 'Kate', 'who', 'suitable', 'job', 'flight', 'attendant', 'single', 'father', 'Marshall', 'now', 'late', 'teens', 'probably', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'season', 'before', 'bloom', 'filmmaker', 'also', 'becoming', 'more', 'judgmental', 'obnoxious', 'When', 'Tara', 'condition', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'strike', 'Marshall', 'down', 'earth', 'inherent', 'sensitivity', 'return', 'Max', 'main', 'struggle', 'season', 'be', 'burden', 'continuing', 'be', 'emotional', 'rock', 'everyone', 'as', 'well', 'caretaker', 'increasingly', 'destructive', 'ill', 'wife', 'even', 'own', 'Mother', 'Francis', 'Conroy', 'good', 'somewhat', 'wasted', 'cameo', 'let', 'Tara', 'go', 'Max', 'committed', 'staying', 'wife', 'children.As', 'Bryce', 'alter', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'everyone', 'lives', 'increasingly', 'unclear', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'psychologically', 'Bryce', 'murder', 'Tara', 'other', 'alters', 'way', 'cleaning', 'slate', 'Tara', 'can', 'finally', 'live', 'life', 'own', 'Bryce', 'Tara', 'way', 'truly', 'completely', 'self-destructing', 'One', 'thing', 'show', 'never', 'offered', 'were', 'clear', 'easy', 'answers', 'when', 'came', 'Tara', 'always', 'been', 'complicated', 'messy', 'unpredictable', 'chaotic', 'character', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'performance', 'always', 'anchored', 'elevated', 'show', 'single', 'outrageous', 'plotline', 'written', 'pulled', 'off', 'brilliantly.Since', 'Showtime', 'decided', 'not', 'renew', 'series', 'third', 'season', 'also', 'final', 'season', 'last', 'episode', 'serving', 'not', 'only', 'season', 'finale', 'series', 'finale', 'well', 'when', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'conceived', 'was', 'probably', 'up', 'air', 'not', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'back', 'kudos', 'writers', 'giving', 'viewers', 'fans', 'enough', 'closure', 'last', 'episode', 'be', 'able', 'gracefully', 'close', 'book', 'series', 'somewhat', 'brief', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'adventurous', 'run']",United States Of Tara: Season 3
1436206,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00511N7B2,DVD Verdict,"[7, 8]","Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- Well, United States of Tara, it was a good run. Alas, after three increasingly ambitious seasons of entertaining television, Showtime has pulled the plug on the program that had quietly turned into its best show (though this is largely due to the fact that Dexter's wheel-spinning has become frustrating and Weeds has wandered off into shark-jumping territory). Those of you who have been watching the program on DVD (as I have) undoubtedly have an important question to ask: ""How well does it end?""Without digging into spoilers, permit me to say that United States of Tara ends rather well under the circumstances. Yes, there is one significant unresolved plot thread and one is made rather curious about where a fourth season would have gone, but the finale works quite well given the unexpected nature of the cancellation. It's a touching, cathartic capper to a most intriguing season. The show's third go-round frequently swings for the fences, whiffing in a silly manner on occasion but knocking it out of the park just as often.The DVD transfer is a typically sturdy TV-show release, boasting strong detail, bright colors, acceptably deep blacks and natural flesh tones. Audio is similarly sturdy, spotlighting dialogue and an appreciably understated soundtrack (speaking of which, I miss the show's inventive theme song--who decided to kill that offbeat charmer?).

1436213,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00511N7B2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[23, 25]","When ""United States of Tara"" premiered on Showtime in 2009, its creator Diablo Cody was still riding high from her Oscar win as the writer of ""Juno.""  It's clear that she wanted to establish an eccentric and complicated comedy that spoke to serious issues in an outrageous way.  I mean the idea of tackling a multiple personality disorder within a robust family sitcom is certainly an unconventional notion.  And her muse seemed to be the energetic Toni Collette who brought numerous dimensions to the multifaceted lead character.  As a suburban wife and mother in Overland Park, Kansas--Tara, with her built in plethora of alters, provided Collette with endless acting possibilities.  And who doesn't love showy performances?  Winning both an Emmy and a Golden Globe, Collette embraced the show's lunacy while finding true heart and pain when appropriate.  For me, she has always been the primary reason to watch this chaotic program and the show excelled in the quieter, more realistic, moments showcasing the family dynamic.I have watched ""Tara"" for its entire three season run and have not always embraced the over-the-top antics of the supporting cast.  Tara's daughter and sister, in particular, have struggled to find an easy balance as real characters.  Their wackiness has somehow always felt false and distracted me from the genuineness of the central theme.  Rosemarie DeWitt, a fine actress in every respect, could be undeniably grating as sister Charmaine while Brie Larson has been saddled with some of the series' most unfortunate plot lines (an awkward harassment case at work in Season One, a ludicrous Internet story in Season Two) as a daughter moving into adulthood.  I mention this at length because the show could have too much eccentricity for its own good.  Thankfully Collette and a understated John Corbett (as Tara's husband) kept things grounded.Season Three (Tara's final), for me, began as one of the strongest.  Suddenly the show became much more focused with a central story line involving Tara returning to school.  With an invaluable assist from Eddie Izzard as a psychology professor that helps Tara finally deal with her emotional issues--many of the more contrived subplots concerning the peripheral characters fell away.  Everyone seemed to have purpose again and the attention returned to our heroine.  As secrets were revealed, deals were struck, and calm was devastated by the emergence of a new and dangerous alter--the show had a renewed vigor.  But at its best, the program pushed too far for my taste.  For the second half of the season, Tara becomes a clear and obvious danger to herself and her loved ones (setting fire in the truck of a car, cutting her flesh, poisoning someone, ransacking the house, threatening).  At any one of these signs, hospitalization would have been indicated--but the family acted as if it were no big deal for weeks!  Eventually, hard decisions had to be made, but I never believed that Tara's loved ones would have left her at risk for such a long period.  And make no mistake, this is some serious stuff regardless of it being played irreverently.

But it goes out with a bang, and is all-in-all worth it.This season focuses on Tara returning to college to finish off the degree she never completed years ago.  At the same time, a violent new ""alter"" arrives that threatens not only Tara's stability, but also the lives of her other ""alters"", and even the lives of her friends and family.This season is exquisite.  It's a huge step up from the slightly under-whelming second season, and ends the show on a strong note.

There are barely any features.  Which sucks, because the quality of the show is so high, you'd think they'd have some interesting featurettes, interviews and commentaries.  I know the previous DVD's didn't have much, but they had some special features at least.  But I guess because the show was canceled, Showtime just skipped out on features to save time and money.  Oh, well.  Maybe someday we can get a boxed set that has some features...Picture and sound quality is good.
