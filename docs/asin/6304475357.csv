The accident and the causes are well covered and lots of information about what happened and how they changed aviation we know today to be safer.If you are worried about flying, don't watch these before a flight. If you are keen to know how aviation got to where it is today and enjoy flying then this is definitely worth a watch.",4,"Good series, hope they release the others on Amazon Instant Videos",1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,503,"['investigations', 'disasters', 'are', 'well', 'covered', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Air', 'Crash', 'Investigation', 'Seconds', 'From', 'Disaster', 'still', 'good', 'series', 'accident', 'causes', 'are', 'well', 'covered', 'lots', 'information', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'changed', 'aviation', 'know', 'today', 'be', 'safer.If', 'are', 'worried', 'flying', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'flight', 'are', 'keen', 'know', 'how', 'aviation', 'got', 'where', 'today', 'enjoy', 'flying', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch']",Air Disasters Volume 1: The Facts VHS

Endured the garage being used to rebuilt a star duster II by-wing airplane, endured years of hobby RCA remote control planes being built on the family ping pong table and endured being one of the kids who had to wash their dads planes at the airport.  These were intriguing to watch.  Sad part is how accidents had to happen for changes to be made to make flying safer.

424452,A215DQ7IMZ8N3G,6304475357,juan,"[0, 0]",I really enjoyed this series.  Each episode brings something new.  The historical matter is important for prevention of future accident.  Some of these disasters involve human error.  Like the cockpit crew that were discussing their problem as if they were in their home living room and they forgot that they were flying a new plane.  This accident was very costly to Eastern Airlines.  The airline went down tool.Great series.SincerelyJuan,5,AIR DISASTER EPISODES,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,440,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'episode', 'something', 'new', 'historical', 'matter', 'important', 'prevention', 'future', 'accident', 'disasters', 'involve', 'human', 'error', 'cockpit', 'crew', 'were', 'discussing', 'problem', 'were', 'home', 'living', 'room', 'forgot', 'were', 'flying', 'new', 'plane', 'accident', 'was', 'very', 'costly', 'Eastern', 'Airlines', 'airline', 'went', 'down', 'tool.Great', 'series.SincerelyJuan']",Air Disasters Volume 1: The Facts VHS

424454,A1FGABIJLQHY22,6304475357,TKT,"[0, 0]","There are very few shows like ""Air Disasters"" on TV, which is why I really appreciate that the Smithsonian Channel chose to make this series.I've always found the subject of plane crashes fascinating. What's nice about how the Smithsonian Channel covers each case is that they give very thorough explanation and analysis of not only how planes fly, but why they crash. I love the very detailed technical explanations of what exactly happens to an airplane to cause it to crash(each episode of the series is about a specific crash). It's fascinating from a technical and scientific standpoint.I also like that the show doesn't forget to show us how human life is affected by each disaster. Each episode discusses the experiences of a few passengers or family members of passengers from each flight. The show also focuses on what the flight crew and pilots may have been thinking and feeling in the moments leading up to the disasters.Each episode makes sure to also include the accident investigation findings as well as how aircraft may have been updated, or in some cases even discontinued, after investigations. The re-creations of the crashes (including the inside and outsides of the planes) are really realistic looking and make the viewer feel like they are seeing it happen first hand. The very high-tech simulations are interesting to watch.A good show overall.",5,Air Disasters,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,1369,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'Air', 'Disasters', 'TV', 'why', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Smithsonian', 'Channel', 'chose', 'make', 'series.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'subject', 'plane', 'crashes', 'fascinating', 'What', 'nice', 'how', 'Smithsonian', 'Channel', 'case', 'give', 'very', 'thorough', 'explanation', 'analysis', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'planes', 'fly', 'why', 'crash', 'love', 'very', 'detailed', 'technical', 'explanations', 'what', 'exactly', 'airplane', 'cause', 'crash', 'episode', 'series', 'specific', 'crash', 'fascinating', 'technical', 'scientific', 'standpoint.I', 'also', 'show', ""n't"", 'forget', 'show', 'how', 'human', 'life', 'affected', 'disaster', 'episode', 'experiences', 'few', 'passengers', 'family', 'members', 'passengers', 'flight', 'show', 'also', 'what', 'flight', 'crew', 'pilots', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'moments', 'leading', 'up', 'disasters.Each', 'episode', 'sure', 'also', 'include', 'accident', 'investigation', 'findings', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'aircraft', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'updated', 'cases', 'even', 'discontinued', 'investigations', 're-creations', 'crashes', 'including', 'inside', 'outsides', 'planes', 'are', 'really', 'realistic', 'looking', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'are', 'seeing', 'happen', 'first', 'hand', 'very', 'high-tech', 'simulations', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch.A', 'good', 'show', 'overall']",Air Disasters Volume 1: The Facts VHS
