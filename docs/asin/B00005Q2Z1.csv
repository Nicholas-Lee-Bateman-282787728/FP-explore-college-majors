Some drastic portrayals of romance, comedy, drama, and violence have been colorfully represented in the anime world, far more so than live action filming.  So it follows that when a romantic story is set to japanese cultural philosophy and artistic presentation, you get a lovely story like this one.Poor Belldandy loses her loving memory and is forced to re-learn much of her blessed belonning to Keiichi and his world.  All the cast returns as well as the lovely Peorth.What makes this movie worth owning is the subtle &quot;heart-string tugging&quot; that occurs regularly through the movie.  The script is beautifully crafted, the struggle is understandable, and the conclusion is...For you to have left this title out of your collection until now is unthinkable.

The story and characters created by Kosuke Fujishima are amazing, and I love them terribly.  Because I so love the original manga and OVAs, I was disappointed by this movie.The animation was beautiful, and the voice acting was wonderful.  I was very pleased to find that all of the original seiyuu (voice actors) were employed to make the film.  I also liked the parallels to the manga that were missing in the OVAs, such as the &quot;goddess spirits&quot; within Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld.  But beyond these things, I was disappointed.The movie had little to do with the original series.  All of the same characters were used, but it didn't seem like a continuation so much as...something else entirely.  The story just kind of comes out of nowhere, and it doesn't have the light romantic-comedy feeling that the OVAs had.

And the music is soft and glorious.When Belldandy's old mentor, Celestine, escapes captivity for a sin he committed long ago, he erases his former pupil's memory as part of a cunning scheme to overthrow Heaven once and for all.Belldandy's love, Keiichi, and her sisters, Urd and Skuld, set out to try to recover her memory, using Belldandy's love for Keiichi to try to reawaken her sleeping memories. But what they don't know, is that that was precisely what Celestine was counting on.And we learn, as events progress, that Celestine's war against Heaven grew, not out of a desire for personal power, but instead, from a need to protect the innocence of Belldandy from the harsh cruelty in the world.A moving story with colorful characters, and a great date film.And then there's the delicious bonus of the Adventures of the Mini-Goddess! Watch as Goddess of Love, Urd, tries to play matchmaker to a hapless rat named Gan.The English dub for this one is actually pretty good.

673522,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,B00005Q2Z1,C.W. Fitch,"[4, 4]","""Ah! My Goddess: The Movie"" is a fine piece of work, directed by the same genius (Hiroaki Gooda) who brought us the original OAV series.The movie is set after the events of the OAV's, and involves a ""low-class"" deity named Celestine who rebels against Heaven.  His ultimate plan is to create a new ""system"" for the world to run on, in which everyone experiences happiness without suffering.  It seems to be a good enough idea, except changing destiny and Heaven's plan for the people of Earth doesn't exactly find favor with the gods.  Not only that, but he is actually using his top student, Belldandy, as his catalyst, which threatens her relationship with Keiichi, the love of her life.  The story basically goes from there, combining deep elements of romance with intense action sequences in a splendid, heart-rending ballet as Bell's sisters, Keiichi, and Heaven itself try to put a stop to Celestine's plan.It pays to know a little about the ""Ah! My Goddess"" universe before watching the movie, as elements from not just the OAV's, but the comics as well, make appearances in it.  It doesn't take away from very much not to be familiar with them, but it does help with the enjoyment factor.  Belldandy's third sister, Peorth, and the goddesses' angelic ""helpers"" make their animated debuts here, both of which first appeared in the comics.  There's also an in-depth look at how Heaven operates in the ""Goddess-verse""; I thought the idea of it being like a giant computer program was pretty neat, especially as Celestine's ""system"" infects it and the ""virus"" spreads.  The story moves along at a fast enough pace to hold attention, and the action and intensity as everyone races against time and the system gives the heart rate a little boost.  The most prolific moments in the movie, though, are the tender ones, as the power of love makes itself known.  We're talking gushing, drippy, sappy kinds of moments rarely seen at this level in anime; they were prolific in the OAV's as well, and that kind of sentiment is basically the mainstay of this series.  Yes, I'll admit, they even moved a guy like me.  (But just a little!)The animation is spectacular; I expected nothing less, and I wasn't a bit disappointed.  The computer animation blends flawlessly with the hand-drawn, which can be tricky.  The English dub is superb, drawing on veteran voice talents as well as Pioneer's own pool of vocal radiance.  Bell's voice in English is as liquid-honey as the original Japanese, and the rest of the cast's voices matched the characters' personalities to a 'T'.All told, this flick is an awesome visual and emotional feast that will likely satisfy anime, romance, and ""Ah! My Goddess"" fans for a while to come.  (Although if you're turned off by ""mushy stuff"", this flick may not be for you.)  The extras on the DVD are few, but treasures indeed; you get a free mini pencil board with the Special Edition, and ""The Adventures of the Mini-Goddesses"" sneak peek is hilarious and a hundred times cuter than the original series, but I think more kids than adults will enjoy that.

The art of this movie is stunning to say the least.  I was surprised to find that it was all right to see the movie without any prior knowledge of what has happened before this.  This movie was a good love story that drew me to the characters and made me feel their emotions.  The english Dub was done rather well.  I prefer Dubs because it does not interfere with the viewing enjoyment.  The Japanese voices were good but I really enjoyed the Dub.  The movie really looks good on the technical aspect of things. Top of the line.  Pioneer really does a good job with their releases and this disc is no exemption with the sheer quality of the Video.  The keepcase is clear with an almost holographic cardboard slipcase cover that goes over it and shimmers with diferent colors.  This really goes well with the imagery and idea that the people in the show are special.  The cover is of the main Goddess Beldandy with the inside cover being reversible in a way.  The inside has a nice plastic card that I thought was a nice bonus that added to the quality of this release The liner notes/ inside jacket is really well done with some character bios.  The whole release is just stunning....  My hats off and many thanks to Pioneer for such a great release.  For other discs with a love story in a fashion like this would be Tenchi Forever and Kimagure Orange Road: Summer's Begining.

It features beautiful artwork and a story that can teach us all a few lessons.  Why didn't I give it 5 stars then?  Because in my personal opinion, it kind of violates the whole feel of Oh! My Goddess.  It starts out great, there is still the romantic overtones as well as plenty of humor to be found (the scene where Tamiya is in the muscle suit trying to convince people to join the auto club was hilarious!) but that soon stops as Celestine arrives on the scene.  After the first half hour there is scarcely a humorous moment to be found, which is different from the oav's where they mixed humor and romance very nicely.

Normally I find Anime movies unsatisfying, but this one was truly beautiful.  It had everything I wanted: all of the above already mentioned.  I really fell in love with the characters.  They're just so, pure (well most of them anyway), and they're people you can really admire because they're so unselfish and loving.  Belldandy's such a great character, and I like how she's so innocent and no one can corrupt her, even if they try.  Though she really has a lot of wisdom too.  The movie does a good job of giving equal time to the characters, and allows them to reveal their true selves.The animation is of highest quality, and really does equal the manga in detail and style.  And it's in glorious color.  The characters are all so cool!  Keichii is such a decent guy, Belldandy is truly a goddess, Urd oozes sex appeal, Skuld is innocently funny, and you even feel sorry for the ""bad"" guys.  This is really a feel-good movie.  Everybody cares about each other and love is a real big theme.  I love it.  It's my only Anime movie DVD, actually - because it deserves to be bought and watched on DVD.

673530,A26O0T192IBKY1,B00005Q2Z1,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Where as alot of anime movies are connected to a TV series, Ah My Goddess is signifigant as it was a direct sequal to the original OVA series from the 90s, which in America was called Oh My Goddess. Although the film included a few elements from the manga as well, this actually came out a few years before the TV remake.Set around sometime after the end of the 5-episode OVA, Keichi is still living with the goddess Belldandy, and her sisters Urd and Skuld. Belldandy is visited by her old teacher Celestin, who was unknown to her imprisioned on the moon for rebelling against the gods when she was young. Celestin was released by the fairy princess Morgan Le Fay(from the Arthurian legend)to try and gain access to the Yggdrasil system that Heaven uses to control Earth. Celestin infects Belldandy with a virus that makes her forget everything that happened to her from when she first came to Earth and met Keichi. Urd and Skuld try using a vaccine to cure her and give back her memories, but this causes the Yggdrasil system to crash, and Celestin takes over Keichi's body. With Morgan, Celestin nearly succeeds, but Belldandy regains her memories and frees Keichi of his control. The three goddesses then bring their powers together to heal Yggdrasil, and set everything right again.This film was very well executed. It had a solid story, a decent plot, and unlike alot of anime movies that spinoff from a series, it actually tied into the original in an exceptional way. It was directed by Hiroaki Godha, who went on to do the Ah My Goddess TV series which retold most of the story from OVA. You can enjoy this movie even if you're only briefly familar with the characters. Weirdly enough, you can see this as sequal to both the TV and OVA series. The astounding digital animation that was used(for in 2000)is still remarkable by today's standards. Even though there's a little less of the comedic factor that usually follows an AMG title, its a very entertaining shojo comedy.",4,Divine Comedy,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,1982,"['Where', 'alot', 'anime', 'movies', 'are', 'connected', 'TV', 'series', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'signifigant', 'was', 'direct', 'sequal', 'original', 'OVA', 'series', '90s', 'America', 'was', 'called', 'Oh', 'My', 'Goddess', 'film', 'included', 'few', 'elements', 'manga', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'TV', 'remake.Set', 'sometime', 'end', '5-episode', 'OVA', 'Keichi', 'still', 'living', 'goddess', 'Belldandy', 'sisters', 'Urd', 'Skuld', 'Belldandy', 'visited', 'old', 'teacher', 'Celestin', 'who', 'was', 'unknown', 'imprisioned', 'moon', 'rebelling', 'gods', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Celestin', 'was', 'released', 'fairy', 'princess', 'Morgan', 'Le', 'Fay', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'try', 'gain', 'access', 'Yggdrasil', 'system', 'control', 'Earth', 'Celestin', 'Belldandy', 'virus', 'forget', 'everything', 'happened', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'Earth', 'met', 'Keichi', 'Urd', 'Skuld', 'try', 'using', 'vaccine', 'cure', 'give', 'back', 'memories', 'Yggdrasil', 'system', 'crash', 'Celestin', 'Keichi', 'body', 'Morgan', 'Celestin', 'nearly', 'Belldandy', 'memories', 'frees', 'Keichi', 'control', 'three', 'goddesses', 'then', 'bring', 'powers', 'together', 'heal', 'Yggdrasil', 'set', 'everything', 'right', 'again.This', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'had', 'solid', 'story', 'decent', 'plot', 'alot', 'anime', 'movies', 'spinoff', 'series', 'actually', 'tied', 'original', 'exceptional', 'way', 'was', 'directed', 'Hiroaki', 'Godha', 'who', 'went', 'do', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'TV', 'series', 'retold', 'most', 'story', 'OVA', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'even', ""'re"", 'only', 'briefly', 'familar', 'characters', 'Weirdly', 'enough', 'can', 'see', 'sequal', 'TV', 'OVA', 'series', 'astounding', 'digital', 'animation', 'was', 'used', '2000', 'still', 'remarkable', 'today', 'standards', 'Even', 'little', 'less', 'comedic', 'factor', 'usually', 'AMG', 'title', 'very', 'entertaining', 'shojo', 'comedy']",Ah!

673534,ASHS3J6EWUVUD,B00005Q2Z1,K.M. Viglione,"[3, 4]","I had purchased this movie without any worthwhile familiarity with Ah My Goddess in general, so I took a gamble in buying it (especially as I got it on VHS and ended with a DVD player for Christmas). However, it was worth the risk because the movie is wonderfully entertaining, has a deep, moving story, wonderful animation, and two of the new characters introduced are my favorites. There is also a lovely soundtrack, which I also recommend buying.As a warning, this review may contain spoilers.While knowing the basic premise of Ah My Goddess and knowing about a few important events in the series (manga at the point this moview was made), it's necessary to appreciate this movie. At this point, Belldandy and Keiichi have been living together in a restored temple for about 3 years, and all seems to be going swell. Urd and Skuld are still around, and life at Nekomi Tech is as usual. The motor club even has a new female member, Morgan. Yet one evening, Belldandy's mentor and teacher, the god Celestin, appears after having vanished for years. Yet during the encounter, Celestin erases Belldandy's memories of being with Keiichi. So sets events in motion of the movie.While there is still comedy and romance, staples in Ah My Goddess, there is also action and drama. Soon Earth itself will be in grave danger, and even Yggdrasil may not be able to save it.Other previously manga-only characters make their first animated appearances, including Peorth and Banpei. Yet my favorite characters are Celestin and Morgan. Celestin is a determined individual, bent on achieving his goals for what he believes is a greater good. Morgan is a woman who has been scorned by life and believes that some good will come of what Celestin does. Belldandy and Keiichi are simply pawns for a much larger event.While normally I get rather bored with sappy romance, that doesn't bulk up the movie. If you ARE a fan of sappy romance, then this movie is good for you. This movie, in the end, doesn't result in large character development. We see new sides to all the characters, see how they'd react in new situations, but they tend to stay the same in the end. You can appreciate this in the characters, but don't look for any deepening of Belldandy and Keiichi's relationship, as I don't think it can get any deeper, but only re-affirmed to be as strong as ever.As a treat, viewers will get to see the goddesses Angels, see many symbols of Norse mythology, which beforehand was only common in the manga, and hardly mentioned in the OVA. There's even a little Latin! The fight scenes are excellent, and you really see characters like Urd give it everything they've got.Both the dub and the Japanese dialogue are excellent. I think that the voice actor for Celestin in particular did an excellent job. The character was great, and it's a shame the movie is his only real appearence so far.But I highly recommend the movie, even if you never look into anything else of the Ah(Oh My Goddess canon.",4,Definately an anime to add to anyone's collection,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,2978,"['had', 'purchased', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'familiarity', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'general', 'took', 'gamble', 'buying', 'especially', 'got', 'VHS', 'ended', 'DVD', 'player', 'Christmas', 'However', 'was', 'worth', 'risk', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'deep', 'moving', 'story', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'are', 'favorites', 'also', 'lovely', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'recommend', 'warning', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers.While', 'knowing', 'basic', 'premise', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'knowing', 'few', 'important', 'events', 'series', 'manga', 'point', 'moview', 'was', 'made', 'necessary', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'point', 'Belldandy', 'Keiichi', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'together', 'restored', 'temple', '3', 'years', 'be', 'going', 'swell', 'Urd', 'Skuld', 'are', 'still', 'life', 'Nekomi', 'Tech', 'as', 'usual', 'motor', 'club', 'even', 'new', 'female', 'member', 'Morgan', 'one', 'evening', 'Belldandy', 'mentor', 'teacher', 'god', 'Celestin', 'having', 'vanished', 'years', 'encounter', 'Celestin', 'Belldandy', 'memories', 'being', 'Keiichi', 'So', 'sets', 'events', 'motion', 'movie.While', 'still', 'comedy', 'romance', 'staples', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'also', 'action', 'drama', 'Soon', 'Earth', 'will', 'be', 'grave', 'danger', 'even', 'Yggdrasil', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'it.Other', 'previously', 'manga-only', 'characters', 'make', 'first', 'animated', 'appearances', 'including', 'Peorth', 'Banpei', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'Celestin', 'Morgan', 'Celestin', 'determined', 'individual', 'bent', 'achieving', 'goals', 'what', 'greater', 'good', 'Morgan', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'scorned', 'life', 'good', 'will', 'come', 'what', 'Celestin', 'Belldandy', 'Keiichi', 'are', 'simply', 'pawns', 'much', 'larger', 'normally', 'get', 'rather', 'bored', 'sappy', 'romance', ""n't"", 'bulk', 'up', 'movie', 'ARE', 'fan', 'sappy', 'romance', 'then', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'end', ""n't"", 'result', 'large', 'character', 'development', 'see', 'new', 'sides', 'characters', 'see', 'how', ""'d"", 'react', 'new', 'situations', 'tend', 'stay', 'same', 'end', 'can', 'appreciate', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'deepening', 'Belldandy', 'Keiichi', 'relationship', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'get', 'deeper', 'only', 're-affirmed', 'be', 'as', 'strong', 'ever.As', 'treat', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'goddesses', 'Angels', 'see', 'many', 'symbols', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'beforehand', 'was', 'only', 'common', 'manga', 'hardly', 'mentioned', 'OVA', 'even', 'little', 'Latin', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'really', 'see', 'characters', 'Urd', 'give', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'dub', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'are', 'excellent', 'think', 'voice', 'actor', 'Celestin', 'particular', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'character', 'was', 'great', 'shame', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'appearence', 'so', 'far.But', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'even', 'never', 'look', 'anything', 'else', 'Ah', 'Oh', 'My', 'Goddess', 'canon']",Ah!

My Goddess the Movie will excite fans of the too-short TV series about a beautiful goddess named Belldandy who lives with an Earthling college student named Keichi.The movie takes place about two years after the TV anime series ended.  The Amazon editorial review for this movie said Keichi looks more attractive and poised.  But nah - he's still the same old Keichi.  Skuld looks a little more grown-up, though.The gorgeous Celestin comes to Earth to get Belldandy to help him implement his grand plan. Like Buddha, Celestin has lofty, noble goals of ending suffering on Earth.  Unlike Buddha, his methods involve evolving Earth's life forms thousands of years into the future.  Belldandy does not remember the terrible truths of her and Celestin's past.  Celestin has an ally, the butterfly-like fairy, Morgan, who has been greatly wronged by the Celestial Goddess System.  Morgan poses as a college student in order to get close to Keichi and Belldandy.The animation in this movie is incredible.  The backgrounds are perfect.  It is just like reality.  One shot of Morgan hovering over a bay I had to pause and just gaze, amazed.  I felt I was there with her.  The whole movie is so realistic I cannot emphasize it enough.The ending is touching and may make you tear up.  It is highly Disneyfied, however.  Any anime fans who prefer darker or Goth-type fare would not be impressed.  But if you are a believer in positive thinking and true love, this is your cup of anime.I was very disappointed that we did not even get to see Belldandy and Keichi kiss!!!! It has been TWO YEARS since she has been living with him, and it is implied that their relationship has not been consummated.  What is up with that?  It is like watching a priest and a nun.Extras include an art gallery with some stunning art, some of which I would love to have as posters on my wall.

Belldandy's old mentor, Celestin (who had been imprisoned for trying to overthrow the Goddess System) is responsible. Belldandy has to get her memories back in time to stop Celestin. There's also a character, Morgan, who seems to want to steal Keiichi away from Belldandy.My thoughts: I wouldn't recommend watching the movie unless you've seen the OVA (or read the manga). The Goddess System is a little strange, some things happen that are predictable, but the idea of Belldandy's mentor was nice, and we get to see her angel.

That should be reserved for all time classics like Neon Genesis Evangelion.The main problem with Ah! My Goddess is the main character, Belldandy, is hard to like (besides having a silly name).  She's absolutely perfect and subservient in every possible way.  She's too syrupy sweet and meek to build a show around.  I'm just not a big fan of romance anime -- with its ankle-length ponytails, 3 foot-long bangs that defy gravity and poofy gowns.And I'm unfamiliar of the Japanese concept of Heaven, but this show mixes witchcraft, magic, Norse mythology, computer technology and the tradtional Christian belief of Angels.  It's never explained why/how each &quot;goddess&quot; has an Angel alter-ego growing out of her back.  However, the concept of a technologically driven Heaven is rather interesting (it looks like the White Room from Matrix Reloaded).  But this movie is also loaded with a lot of Star Trek Voyager type technobabble. &quot;The LMT is down to 12%!!!&quot;The last third of the movie is where the real action is and it's stunning to watch -- a real end-of-the-world battle.

My Goddess: The Movie is the answer to every true-blooded Ah! My Goddess fan's prayer.Life has been smooth sailing for lovebirds Keiichi and Belldandy, but here they are confronted with their greatest trial yet. A few new characters are introduced -- the main antagonist Celestin, who used to be Bel's teacher; Morgan, a butterfly-like girl who's bent on helping Celestin achieve his goals; and Peorth, a first-class goddess who seems to have a lot of control up in heaven. The main conflict arises within Belldandy, as she is torn between her beloved teacher and her human lover.Ah! My Goddess: The Movie takes on a more serious tone, and the few comical moments it has are restricted to the first part. It also gives us a glimpse of Bel's childhood... subsequently revealing what had caused the present situation. Audiences will also be treated to a more in-depth look at the goddesses' home -- heaven. Ah! My Goddess's depiction of heaven is rather interesting. It takes your idea of heaven (clouds, majestic palaces, and all) and merges it with cutting-edge technology. They use complex computer systems to run things, and become helpless when Celestin plants a virus that takes the network down. The goddesses also get to show off their great powers in spectacular fight scenes, proving that they are more than just pretty faces.The art and animation are magnificently done. I thought the OAV series looked exquisite, but this movie takes the cake. The characters look even more refined (which I didn't think was possible), and they move about as fluidly as running water.

673550,A5JRIJHB2AQ0J,B00005Q2Z1,"Steve Miller ""Writer of Stuff""","[1, 1]","In 'Ah! My Goddess: The Movie,' the world is threatened by a god who wishes to create a reality where no mortals have to suffer. He forces an unwitting Belldandy--a goddess who has been bound through love to Japanese college student Keiichi--to serve as the main vehicle of his plot.The movie features all the characters from the long-running comic book and graphic novel series (published in America by Dark Horse Comics and translated as ""Oh My Goddess!""), including recent additions to the cast such as Belldandy's rival, the goddess Peorth and the various angels tied to Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld. In many cases, the film assumes that the viewer knows who these characters are, which in my mind is its main flaw. While readers of the graphic novels and comic books can be somewhat up-to-date--as of this writing, ""The Fourth Goddess"" where Peorth first appears has been released, but the Whirlwind motor company that's referred in the film to will still be an unknown if one only reads them and not the monthly issues--and there are a host of characters that will remain mysterious to those who may be coming to this film from the other animated episodes alone. If the filmmakers had weeded down the cast a bit, there would have been time to provide brief introductions to everyone and the film would have been better for it.The animation quality is very good, taking advantage of both traditional and computer animation to convey the strange power of the film's supernatural beings who live by the addage ""sufficiently advanced technology is equal to magic""; in the ""Ah! My Goddess"" universe, reality is maintained by a super-computer running incredibly advanced programs, and  all supernatural beings are, basically, ""remote terminals."" The animators have remained true to creator Kosuke Fujishima's character designs and mix of cartoony and hyper-realistic art, and the characters of the film seem very much grounded in a world not far removed from our own. The result is a very attractive-looking film that captures the look of Fujishima's comic art very nicely.The English-language dubbing is better than average, but I think the casting could have been better. Belldandy is entirely too whiny and Urd isn't husky/assertive enough from how they should sound based on their portrayals in the comic.Story-wise, the film also captures the feel of the comic quite nicely, with the real plot revolving around Belldandy and Keiichi's love once again surviving supernatural challenges and emerging reconfirmed and even stronger than before. (No, that's not really a spoiler; anyone who has even passing familiarity with ""Oh My Goddess"" and romantic films of this nature go in expecting a happy ending.) Unfortunately, the story fails to successfully revolve all of its subplots and themes by the time the film is over. The chief of these is the race that the NIT Motorclub is preparing for during the film. It's there to underscore the fact that Keiichi and Belldandy are the perfect couple, and it should have been returned to at the end. (Eliminating some of the characters who don't play any role in the story but who are just there because they're part of the graphic novels might have given the tme needed to properly wrap up the film's loose elements.)The flaws of this film balance its good parts, hence the Three Stars (an average rating). I recommend it highly to fans of romantic comedies and the ""Oh My Goddess!"" series... but I do so warning you that it is far from a perfect work.",3,A pretty film and nice boil-down of the manga's themes,1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,3495,"[""'Ah"", 'Goddess', 'Movie', 'world', 'threatened', 'god', 'who', 'create', 'reality', 'where', 'mortals', 'have', 'suffer', 'unwitting', 'Belldandy', 'goddess', 'who', 'been', 'bound', 'love', 'Japanese', 'college', 'student', 'Keiichi', 'serve', 'main', 'vehicle', 'plot.The', 'movie', 'characters', 'long-running', 'comic', 'book', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'published', 'America', 'Dark', 'Horse', 'Comics', 'translated', 'Oh', 'My', 'Goddess', 'including', 'recent', 'additions', 'cast', 'such', 'Belldandy', 'rival', 'goddess', 'Peorth', 'various', 'angels', 'tied', 'Belldandy', 'Urd', 'Skuld', 'many', 'cases', 'film', 'viewer', 'knows', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'mind', 'main', 'flaw', 'readers', 'graphic', 'novels', 'comic', 'books', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'up-to-date', 'writing', 'Fourth', 'Goddess', 'where', 'Peorth', 'first', 'been', 'released', 'Whirlwind', 'motor', 'company', 'referred', 'film', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'unknown', 'one', 'only', 'not', 'monthly', 'issues', 'are', 'host', 'characters', 'will', 'remain', 'mysterious', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'film', 'other', 'animated', 'episodes', 'alone', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'weeded', 'down', 'cast', 'bit', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'time', 'provide', 'brief', 'introductions', 'everyone', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'it.The', 'animation', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'taking', 'advantage', 'traditional', 'computer', 'animation', 'convey', 'strange', 'power', 'film', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'who', 'live', 'addage', 'sufficiently', 'advanced', 'technology', 'equal', 'magic', 'Ah', 'Goddess', 'universe', 'reality', 'maintained', 'super-computer', 'running', 'incredibly', 'advanced', 'programs', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'are', 'basically', 'remote', 'terminals', 'animators', 'have', 'remained', 'true', 'creator', 'Kosuke', 'Fujishima', 'character', 'designs', 'mix', 'cartoony', 'hyper-realistic', 'art', 'characters', 'film', 'seem', 'very', 'much', 'grounded', 'world', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'own', 'result', 'very', 'attractive-looking', 'film', 'look', 'Fujishima', 'comic', 'art', 'very', 'nicely.The', 'English-language', 'dubbing', 'better', 'average', 'think', 'casting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Belldandy', 'entirely', 'too', 'whiny', 'Urd', ""n't"", 'husky/assertive', 'enough', 'how', 'should', 'sound', 'based', 'portrayals', 'comic.Story-wise', 'film', 'also', 'feel', 'comic', 'quite', 'nicely', 'real', 'plot', 'revolving', 'Belldandy', 'Keiichi', 'love', 'once', 'again', 'surviving', 'supernatural', 'challenges', 'emerging', 'reconfirmed', 'even', 'stronger', 'before', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'spoiler', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'passing', 'familiarity', 'Oh', 'My', 'Goddess', 'romantic', 'films', 'nature', 'go', 'expecting', 'happy', 'ending', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'successfully', 'revolve', 'subplots', 'themes', 'time', 'film', 'chief', 'race', 'NIT', 'Motorclub', 'preparing', 'film', 'there', 'underscore', 'fact', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy', 'are', 'perfect', 'couple', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'returned', 'end', 'Eliminating', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'role', 'story', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'there', ""'re"", 'part', 'graphic', 'novels', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'tme', 'needed', 'properly', 'wrap', 'up', 'film', 'loose', 'elements', 'flaws', 'film', 'balance', 'good', 'parts', 'hence', 'Three', 'Stars', 'average', 'rating', 'recommend', 'highly', 'fans', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Oh', 'My', 'Goddess', 'series', 'do', 'so', 'warning', 'far', 'perfect', 'work']",Ah!

673551,A2ARY4EGL32OAA,B00005Q2Z1,"SWC ""sung_amazon""","[6, 7]","Most important things about this theater version of Ah! My Goddess looks already covered by other fans. Although TV series version was actually produced after this movie version, this episode is most likely to be the last episode of all Goddess series in terms of time sequence, because the time frame of the episode is 2 years after Belldandy and Keiichi first met. They first met when Keiichi was a sophomore and now he is a senior. I am personally wondering to death what kind of life will likely to be after keiichi graduates the college.... But anyway, one thing I want to add for review is that Belldandy is now a bit possessive than before. In other episodes, she was nice to everybody, not just to keiichi, and did not show any jealous behavior, even when another girl hookks up Keiichi. She is quite different here. When Hasegawa got drunken and made fun of Keiichi with her breasts, Belldandy unconscientiously used her power to stop them. When Celestin, Belldandy's most trusted mentor, erased her all memory with Keiichi, she returned back to the nice-to-everyone mode. Although she is still extremely nice to keiichi despite the memory loss, her indifferent niceness sheds the sad gloom on entire movie until she finally gets aware of her ""one ugliness.""  Belldandy called her emotion toward to keiichi ugly, because she wants Keiichi just for herself and to share with no one, despite the fact that she, as a goddess, has to equally love and share everybody and everything. Well... I think she showed the possible limit of being innocent. At this level, innocence is almost a disease...  Anyway, if you are familiar with Ah My Goddess series, this movie version is like a perfumy drop of essence extracted from all Goddess series. I can't forget to mention the music. Actually, I listened to the OST music before I watched the DVD. I was first quite doubtful how such grandiose full-symphony music can fit in with Goddess stories. My experience later for DVD was... just ""Wow."" I regretted to death that I don't have 5+1 channel audio and 50-inch monitor. Somebody below mentioned about the English dubs. Yes, original Japanese voice certainly carries something that English version cannot offer. But they are not too bad after all, especially when you compare it with OVA version English dubs. In OVA version of Oh My Goddess (NOT Ah My Goddess), English dubs almost ruined the delicacy and finesse of the original film by unforgivably putting things in joke-like manner. I don't know who must to be blamed, translator, producer, voice crews, or even cultural difference, but clearly, the OVA version dubbing lacks appreciation. Fortunately, this DVD of Ah My Goddess is far better than the oVA version in terms of English dubs. But, the best is surely the original sounds. I never thought that Japanese language can this be enchanting.",5,Don't hesitate to watch!,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,2851,"['Most', 'important', 'things', 'theater', 'version', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'already', 'covered', 'other', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'version', 'was', 'actually', 'produced', 'movie', 'version', 'episode', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'last', 'episode', 'Goddess', 'series', 'terms', 'time', 'sequence', 'time', 'frame', 'episode', '2', 'years', 'Belldandy', 'Keiichi', 'first', 'met', 'first', 'met', 'when', 'Keiichi', 'was', 'sophomore', 'now', 'senior', 'am', 'personally', 'wondering', 'death', 'what', 'kind', 'life', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'keiichi', 'college', 'anyway', 'one', 'thing', 'want', 'add', 'review', 'Belldandy', 'now', 'bit', 'possessive', 'before', 'other', 'episodes', 'was', 'nice', 'everybody', 'not', 'just', 'keiichi', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'jealous', 'behavior', 'even', 'when', 'girl', 'up', 'Keiichi', 'quite', 'different', 'here', 'When', 'Hasegawa', 'got', 'drunken', 'made', 'fun', 'Keiichi', 'breasts', 'Belldandy', 'unconscientiously', 'used', 'power', 'stop', 'When', 'Celestin', 'Belldandy', 'most', 'trusted', 'mentor', 'erased', 'memory', 'Keiichi', 'returned', 'back', 'nice-to-everyone', 'mode', 'still', 'extremely', 'nice', 'keiichi', 'memory', 'loss', 'indifferent', 'niceness', 'sad', 'gloom', 'entire', 'movie', 'finally', 'aware', 'one', 'ugliness', 'Belldandy', 'called', 'emotion', 'keiichi', 'ugly', 'Keiichi', 'just', 'share', 'one', 'fact', 'goddess', 'equally', 'love', 'share', 'everybody', 'everything', 'Well', 'think', 'showed', 'possible', 'limit', 'being', 'innocent', 'level', 'innocence', 'almost', 'disease', 'Anyway', 'are', 'familiar', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'series', 'movie', 'version', 'perfumy', 'drop', 'essence', 'extracted', 'Goddess', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'mention', 'music', 'Actually', 'listened', 'OST', 'music', 'watched', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'quite', 'doubtful', 'how', 'such', 'grandiose', 'full-symphony', 'music', 'can', 'fit', 'Goddess', 'stories', 'experience', 'later', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'Wow', 'regretted', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '5+1', 'channel', 'audio', '50-inch', 'monitor', 'Somebody', 'mentioned', 'English', 'dubs', 'Yes', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'certainly', 'something', 'English', 'version', 'can', 'not', 'offer', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'especially', 'when', 'compare', 'OVA', 'version', 'English', 'dubs', 'OVA', 'version', 'Oh', 'My', 'Goddess', 'NOT', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'English', 'dubs', 'almost', 'ruined', 'delicacy', 'finesse', 'original', 'film', 'unforgivably', 'putting', 'things', 'joke-like', 'manner', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'blamed', 'translator', 'producer', 'voice', 'crews', 'even', 'cultural', 'difference', 'clearly', 'OVA', 'version', 'dubbing', 'lacks', 'appreciation', 'Fortunately', 'DVD', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'far', 'better', 'oVA', 'version', 'terms', 'English', 'dubs', 'best', 'surely', 'original', 'sounds', 'never', 'thought', 'Japanese', 'language', 'can', 'be', 'enchanting']",Ah!

The integration of computer graphics and hand-drawn art is amazing.  Everything was very detailed and I'm really glad this is the first movie played on my computer's DVD player.The storyline is basic cut and dry material; Good vs. Evil, Love and War, etc.  I think the 13 and up suggestion on the box is a little steep.  There is no real reason for the 13-year-old age limit, because there is no nudity or language that would cause it.  And the BASIC story line can be followed easily, and I have not seen the TV series.  But as good as this movie was, I probably will be very soon.If you like anime, your collection isn't complete until you get this movie.
