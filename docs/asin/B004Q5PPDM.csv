I just love the &#34;old-timey&#34; black and white mysteries but I was totally surprised that there had ever been a television series.  I do like it but the transfer is not the best which is noted at the beginning of the discs but they are certainly watchable half hour mysteries.

Nash's version of Chan may take a little getting used to, but he does a very good job considering the handicap of a 30 minute programs and the cheap productions.  James Hong - still with us - plays #1 son, but for some reason he is named &#34;Berry.&#34;  If you are a true Chan enthusiast, you should add this set to your collection (Don't waste your time with the Peter Ustinov insult to Chan even though he did a pleasing interpretation of Poirot in several features)J Carrol Nash could have successfully continued the Chan franchise on the theater screen if he were allowed to grow into the character as he'd done in other roles, from General Sheridan for John Ford, to his many bad-guy roles, and would have been at least as good as Sidney Toler and better than Roland Winters.",5,Got my reviews turned around,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,1247,"[""'d"", 'written', 'review', 'set', 'mistakenly', 'submitted', 'Roland', 'Winters', 'Chan', 'film', 'Golden', 'Eye', 'not', 'bad', 'can', 'accept', 'Winters', 'Chan', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'played', 'Elvis', 'father', 'Blue', 'Hawaii', 'appeared', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'will', 'now', 'be', 'known', '3rd', 'Chan', '.In', 'brief', 'J', 'Carrol', 'Nash', 'boxed', 'set', '30minute', 'TV', 'shows', 'mid', 'late', '50s', 'was', 'very', 'pleasing', 'surprise', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'Nash', 'version', 'Chan', 'may', 'take', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'considering', 'handicap', '30', 'minute', 'programs', 'cheap', 'productions', 'James', 'Hong', 'still', 'plays', '1', 'son', 'reason', 'named', '34', 'Berry.', '34', 'are', 'true', 'Chan', 'enthusiast', 'should', 'add', 'set', 'collection', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'insult', 'Chan', 'even', 'did', 'pleasing', 'interpretation', 'Poirot', 'several', 'features', 'J', 'Carrol', 'Nash', 'could', 'have', 'successfully', 'continued', 'Chan', 'franchise', 'theater', 'screen', 'were', 'allowed', 'grow', 'character', ""'d"", 'done', 'other', 'roles', 'General', 'Sheridan', 'John', 'Ford', 'many', 'bad-guy', 'roles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'Sidney', 'Toler', 'better', 'Roland', 'Winters']",N/A
