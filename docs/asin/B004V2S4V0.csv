In particular, the pivotal explanations between two of our principal characters - the virtual world programmer with her minion. All this was made even more difficult by no subtitles. That aside, the movie starts out slowly indulgent like someone who's taken too many English writing courses, but in time enough thought provoking sub-stories emerge to make it in an engaging 90 minutes. It wasn't clear to me if the movie was written from the first person omniscient view because one of the characters is in the background observing and writing a narrative on everything that takes place in the cafe and yet another character claims to have created/programmed everyone in the cafe. Still another character has the free will to alter outcomes in the cafe irrespective of what the previous two have written.

Coffee house regulars patron the cafe and do their regular things, but the twist is that their daily courses are already determined, or are they, and to what extent?This movie dapples with the concept of God in a sci- fi sort of construct and examines themes such as goodwill vs. selfishness, and destiny vs. free will. Another component I found interesting was that answers were closer than you might expect. This movie is mellow drama and probably will not appeal to a large audience. I caught it on a premium channel.There are two elements from Cafe that I keep thinking about. One is the visual of the dolls in birdcages that is part of the decor at the cafe. The other is the Firefly song that plays over and over consecutively during the credits. The lyrics describe the firefly as being in the hand, lights up, and takes flight. The music is akin to that of a music box which is opened and closed, controlled, at the will of its owner. People will read into this movie what they want and it does contend with the idea of a sovereign, which may not appeal to some, but I think there are other compelling concepts to consider as well and the alternate dimension gives a sci-fi flair.",3,"Fly on the Wall, or Firefly in the Hand",1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,1288,"['Cafe', 'success', 'coffee', 'house', 'social', 'meeting', 'place', 'community', 'Coffee', 'house', 'cafe', 'do', 'regular', 'things', 'twist', 'daily', 'courses', 'are', 'already', 'determined', 'are', 'what', 'extent', 'movie', 'concept', 'God', 'sci-', 'fi', 'sort', 'construct', 'examines', 'themes', 'such', 'goodwill', 'vs.', 'selfishness', 'destiny', 'vs.', 'free', 'will', 'component', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'answers', 'were', 'closer', 'might', 'expect', 'movie', 'mellow', 'drama', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'large', 'audience', 'caught', 'premium', 'are', 'two', 'elements', 'Cafe', 'keep', 'thinking', 'about', 'One', 'visual', 'dolls', 'birdcages', 'part', 'decor', 'cafe', 'other', 'Firefly', 'song', 'consecutively', 'credits', 'lyrics', 'describe', 'firefly', 'being', 'hand', 'up', 'flight', 'music', 'akin', 'music', 'box', 'opened', 'closed', 'controlled', 'will', 'owner', 'People', 'will', 'read', 'movie', 'what', 'want', 'contend', 'idea', 'sovereign', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'think', 'are', 'other', 'compelling', 'concepts', 'consider', 'as', 'well', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'sci-fi', 'flair']",Café

Among the regulars there is a man who spends his days in the window's light scribbling in his paper notebook, there is a woman who finds the shop's causal atmosphere perfect to interview job applicants, and then there is a man sitting in the windowless corner - it is well-lighted: it's just his heart that is dark ... he is the dealer.If you are Tommy, you are drowning in your cravings, desperate to dampen your pain in a fog of numbness ... you would do anything for drugs;  the dealer is about to throw you an anchor of dangerous demands.  There are those who care about you; they are trying to pull you out, but the currents are strong;  they are Officer Duncan, Miss J. and Claire . . . .If you are Claire, you and Todd split the day serving up the Cafe's percolating javas, pastries and whatnots.  Todd has a crush on you;  if only you had met Todd before you met Dave.  He had been a dream, but now you realize he is a nightmare.  You feel trapped, his daily drip-drip of cruelty is draining your self respect, grinding you down.  And then, on one particularly bruising day, you unexpectedly get perked up by one of your regulars; his name is Craig . . . .If you are Craig, your life is pretty humdrum.  You idle away the hours browsing the internet on your notebook computer and sipping coffee.  But then one day your session is hijacked by a programmer who makes the extraordinary claim that you are a virtual character living in a virtual cafe!

It never occurs to you, that you may be no more real than the other characters at the Cafe . . . .Comment:  Unfortunately, there are two things that drag this movie down.

1429844,A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,B004V2S4V0,Ronald L. Russell,"[3, 4]","Cafe is an independent film starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, with a lot of different things going on at the same time. There is a romance between Hewitt's character and the other employee at the coffee shop where she works, but she doesn't know about it yet. There is a seedy drug dealer who uses the coffee shop as his base of operations. A social worker is conducting interviews for a job helping kids in the bad part of town. A beautiful woman comes to the shop on a coffee date with a man she just met at the movies. A lonely man gets a message on his laptop from a 12 year old girl who tells him that he doesn't really exist, but that he is just an avatar. And a mysterious writer sits in the corner and makes notes concerning all that he observes. And all of these people's lives are intertwined in ways they haven't yet come to appreciate.Cafe spends a bit of time asking some really big questions: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Why is there evil in the world? These questions have been asked for millenia, and many answers have been suggested by religion, philosophers, scientists, etc. Cafe also answers these questions, in modern terms which should appeal to viewers of the 21st century. I don't agree with all of the answers as given, but I still enjoyed the movie, and felt good after having watched it.Christians especially will find something to like, as some of the answers can be interpreted to fit the Christian worldview. The film does have instances of implied violence (one character has a black eye from a beating, and a character is killed at one point), and implied drug use (customers of the dealer) but these are presented as negative things to be avoided, not as positive role models.I thought the acting and production values were quite good in Cafe, everyone involved seemed to truly be the character they were trying to represent and good use was made of color, costume, and set design. This is actually the first time I've ever watched Jennifer Love Hewitt on screen, and she does a fine job, but no more so than the rest of the cast. I did like her character and could see why her co-worker would have been smitten. The overall atmosphere of the film was that of a light drama, which became uplifting at times.

I might have interesting conversations. If I am engaged, I will raise my voice, talk with my hands, swear while there's someone's kid in the next table listening. Every so often, I'm seated next to a woman who tells me her life story. At other times, I am just there to chill and read.Regardless of my experiences, I do find that I rarely find myself mumbling sad boring dialogue in a monotone. Yet, that's all that anyone does in this movie. They talk speak as if they are important. The tinkling new age music is always in the background and no one seems terribly interested in their words. The couple that keep meeting at movies and may or may not be initiating an affair might as well be meeting for insurance quotes. The Jennifer Love Hewitt 'avatar' smiles sometimes but mostly she takes dramatic pauses while the other coffee worker says ""uh"" a lot as if that makes him seem serious. There's a kindly black woman who tells the white volunteer community organizer that she's wrong (and then bugs the heroin addict).Not only is the acting dull, the camera work is boring. The Red Letter Media guys pointed out that the Star Wars prequels were so boring because almost every shot in which the characters were talking was either a close-up, an over the shoulder shot or a shot in which they were sitting on couches. Even when people are walking around, they seem to be on a particular trajectory that has no natural ability. When you are going to film an entire movie in a cafe, you NEED to have some originality in your blocking and staging.Before the dumb story about avatars kicks in, this movie has failed to be compelling or entertaining in any meaningful way.
