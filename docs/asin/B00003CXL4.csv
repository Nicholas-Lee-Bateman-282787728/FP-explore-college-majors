She is unlike any other person God put here on this earth.  She is compassionate, lively, and has one heck of a sense of humor.  Granted the movie was pure classic camp, but what about Tammy isn't?  The movie is very similar to Madonna's &quot;Truth Or Dare&quot;, except it doesn't try to be more than it is.  &quot;The Eyes Of Tammy Faye&quot; doesn't take itself too seriously(any movie with sock puppets and drag queens is pure fabulousness).  And the movie doesn't attempt to make Tammy Faye into something she is not.  She is fierce and strong-just a like a lioness.  Some parts are hilarious and some parts of devastingly somber.

It became a part of me.I had always assumed the &quot;facts&quot; about  the fall of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker were true and simple.  This film at  least raises questions about the consistantly unchristian treatment of the  Bakker's by their tele-evangelist cohorts.For me, any film that further  demonstrates that Jerry Falwell will burn in hell is sufficently  entertaining to justify the purchase, but this film has much more.  Seeing  inside Tammy Faye, one discovers that she is a good woman with a good  heart, but little if any self esteem.  She was way ahead of her time (ahead  of where most of her former cohorts are now) on social issues.  Her fragile  self-esteem was trampled upon again and again.  (The clip of Tammy Faye on  the PTL Club television set stoned on Ativan and trying to wade in the  water, which has been painted on canvas, is precious.)  I ALMOST feel bad  laughing at it all, but Tammy Faye has herself done what she suggests  others do with the lemons dealt her in life: .. yeah, make lemonade..  &lt;eyes roll&gt;The film's irony is poignant throughout... RuPaul, who  wears less makeup than Tammy Faye, provides an even narration of the film.  A look at the Bakker's son shows exactly what one would not expect.  Jim  Bakker's &quot;victim's&quot; comments about the depravation of her  innocence are spliced together with tasteless, raunchy scenes from her  Playboy video.Tammy Faye should be admired-- probably not for her  fashion and makeup prowess-- but because, in spite of getting knocked down  again and again and again, she always gets back up and remains true to  herself.If you are not convinced to buy this film already, then do so  for the answer to the question of the ages: What do roaches, Tammy Faye,  and Cher have in common?",5,Remarkably entertaining documentary about tele-evagelism,966124800,"08 13, 2000",2000,1844,"['just', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'laughed', 'cried', 'became', 'part', 'me.I', 'had', 'always', 'assumed', 'quot', 'quot', 'fall', 'Jim', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'Bakker', 'were', 'true', 'simple', 'film', 'least', 'raises', 'questions', 'consistantly', 'unchristian', 'treatment', 'Bakker', 'tele-evangelist', 'cohorts.For', 'film', 'further', 'demonstrates', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'will', 'burn', 'hell', 'sufficently', 'entertaining', 'justify', 'purchase', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'Seeing', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'one', 'discovers', 'good', 'woman', 'good', 'heart', 'little', 'self', 'esteem', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'ahead', 'where', 'most', 'former', 'cohorts', 'are', 'now', 'social', 'issues', 'fragile', 'self-esteem', 'was', 'trampled', 'upon', 'again', 'again', 'clip', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'PTL', 'Club', 'television', 'set', 'stoned', 'Ativan', 'trying', 'wade', 'water', 'been', 'painted', 'canvas', 'precious', 'ALMOST', 'feel', 'bad', 'laughing', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'done', 'what', 'others', 'do', 'lemons', 'dealt', 'life', '..', 'yeah', 'make', 'lemonade..', 'lt', 'roll', 'gt', 'film', 'irony', 'poignant', 'RuPaul', 'who', 'less', 'makeup', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'even', 'narration', 'film', 'look', 'Bakker', 'son', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'Jim', 'Bakker', 'quot', 'victim', 'quot', 'comments', 'depravation', 'innocence', 'are', 'spliced', 'together', 'tasteless', 'raunchy', 'scenes', 'Playboy', 'video.Tammy', 'Faye', 'should', 'be', 'admired', 'probably', 'not', 'fashion', 'makeup', 'prowess', 'spite', 'getting', 'knocked', 'down', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'always', 'back', 'up', 'true', 'herself.If', 'are', 'not', 'convinced', 'buy', 'film', 'already', 'then', 'do', 'so', 'answer', 'question', 'ages', 'What', 'do', 'roaches', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'Cher', 'have', 'common']",The Eyes of Tammy Faye

Narrated by the fierce RuPaul himself, it's understandable how Tammy, like Cher, Britney, and GaGa- has become an icon in the LGBT community. Tammy Faye Bakker goes from a poor Midwestern upbringing to being a charismatic preacher's wife, starting radio stations, and Heritage USA. She survives despite infidelity, two jailed husbands, and cancer. In a sad twist of irony, Tammy Faye passed away in 2007, within a few months of her nemesis, Jerry Falwell (Dr. Jerry Falwell teaches Bible creation (Creation series)) Neither Tammy nor Jerry come out smelling like a rose- but Jerry strikes one as more cunning&cruel.;Tammy Faye was one of the few evangelical preachers who reached out to homosexuals. She reached out to AIDS sufferers on her shows, and co-hosted a secular TV show with an openly gay man. She taught compassion, unlike Falwell and his ilk. One can only wonder what she'd make of the DOMA and Prop.8 battles if she were still alive.Tammy looks to her faith for guidance&strength.; She manages to keep her faith in God, despite numerous trials. It's a testament to her character.

528431,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00003CXL4,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 8]","Tammy Faye Bakker does a good job convincing most people in this documentary that she is a very real and warm person, who was mainly misunderstood by most of her and her husband's Christian followers in the long run.  There are a lot of people who obviously are quite taken with her in this documentary and I can even see why.  She is a very pleasing, warm, &quot;hands on&quot; kind of person throughout.  I have some doubts about her though and I think the film makers needed to be a lot more hard hitting than they were in probing their subject. For one, I can understand finding yourself married to one man who goes to prison but try evaluating someone who marries two such men.  Yes, after being divorced from Jim Bakker, Tammy Faye marries another man who promptly ends up in prison serving a sentence for several years too.  This tells us that she is attracted to this kind of guy and likes the wrong side of the law more than she will admit. Much better than the examination of how culpable or not Tammy Faye may be in defrauding her and Jim Bakker's followers, however, is the examination of Christian television. I was absolutely open mouthed as I saw how absolutely awful Christian television is in terms of performing arts quality.  Tammy Faye cannot sing or act, or even speak well in public, yet she was a major star of Christian television.  This is not a huge surprise though when the film makers show you segment upon segment of Christian television.  To a person, these are the most dreadful performing artists I've ever had the misfortune to see.  I generally watch little to no television because the quality level is so low.  After seeing Christian television as used by the Bakkers, Jerry Falwell, et al, I now think that regular television should be awarded the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes!

When she appeared on the ""Surreal Life"", she charmed me with her sincerity and graciousness, and it made me curious enough to watch this film.I found Tammy Faye Bakker to be a fascinating character. Full of contradictions, like all interesting people are, she seems to radiate an innocent, maternal charisma and down-to-earth charm, which contrasts wildly with her gaudy image and history of opulent living. She's a natural performer who seems completely comfortable in front of the camera; however her greatest talent seems to be her ability to reach out and touch the people around her. Her life is certainly fascinating and full of extremes: fortune, fame, addiction, betrayal, and all the stuff that entertainment legends are made of.To some, it might seem strange that a documentary about Tammy Faye, a devout Christian and televangelist, would be narrated by the world's most famous drag queen. But as the film progresses, you realize that it actually makes perfect sense, because Tammy Faye IS a drag queen: Larger-than-life, over-the-top, magnificent, melodramatic, gaudy, and ultimately triumphant.",4,Gracious,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,1223,"['Growing', 'up', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'Bakker', 'was', 'tacky', 'televangelist', 'wore', 'too', 'much', 'makeup', 'was', 'knew', 'When', 'appeared', 'Surreal', 'Life', 'charmed', 'sincerity', 'graciousness', 'made', 'curious', 'enough', 'watch', 'film.I', 'found', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'Bakker', 'be', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Full', 'contradictions', 'interesting', 'people', 'are', 'radiate', 'innocent', 'maternal', 'charisma', 'down-to-earth', 'charm', 'wildly', 'gaudy', 'image', 'history', 'opulent', 'living', 'natural', 'performer', 'who', 'completely', 'comfortable', 'front', 'camera', 'however', 'greatest', 'talent', 'be', 'ability', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'people', 'life', 'certainly', 'fascinating', 'full', 'extremes', 'fortune', 'fame', 'addiction', 'betrayal', 'stuff', 'entertainment', 'legends', 'are', 'made', 'might', 'seem', 'strange', 'documentary', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'devout', 'Christian', 'televangelist', 'would', 'be', 'narrated', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'drag', 'queen', 'film', 'realize', 'actually', 'perfect', 'sense', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'drag', 'queen', 'Larger-than-life', 'over-the-top', 'magnificent', 'melodramatic', 'gaudy', 'ultimately', 'triumphant']",The Eyes of Tammy Faye

528441,A1BYDMYY2EDVRF,B00003CXL4,Franklin Howell,"[14, 17]","Browsing through Rotten Tomatoes one uneventful evening, I was jolted momentarily when I stumbled upon this movie.  ""An 88 percent approval rating?"", I pinched.  ""Were Jim and Tammy Bakker perhaps judged too quickly during the collapse of their massive empire?  Is it possible that Tammy Faye actually has some cognitive activity working upstairs after all?""Nah.I soon realized that the quality of this flick lay in the production of the documentary itself, not the human product involved.  Barbato and company paint a cute and somewhat naive televangelist caught up in a host of scandals, none of which she ever saw coming.  True to its title, the movie is based on Tammy Faye's side of the story from beginning to end with little or no options for other possibilities.There is a fundamental problem with Tammy Faye and those of her ilk.  The woman reveals no knowledge or even a faint curiosity of the ancient ancestors, culture, or documents of her own proclaimed faith.  Scripture is something to exploit as needed, not research as necessary.  She's not a minister but a celebrity.  The Bakkers never revealed anything otherwise.  That whole crowd, commonly known as ""televangelists,"" practice a kind of top-40 version of Christianity.  It's as plastic as their imaginations, and their TV circus performances are an embarrassment to humankind.Tammy Faye certainly has nice qualities about her as a person and is clearly quite likeable in her own way.  The movie delivers that trait well.  But many people throughout the world possess wonderful qualities without ever getting a crack at the big screen.  The movie impressively unfolds the horrors and tragedies Tammy endured during her career, and certainly no one deserves such torment.  But there are many good people who have been through much worse.  Hollywood has not brought them to the cinema so that we might share in their grief as well.  No one even knows who they are.  They are in fact you and me, and others we all know in our personal lives.So what exactly is it that makes Tammy Faye worthy of the special attention?  The movie is silent on this point.  It's quite a privilege to casually rake in millions for singing rudimentary ditties and shedding superficial tears.  Ministers?  How realistic is it to identify the Bakkers as some sort of link between human consciousness and sacred deity?  The movie focuses too much on the trees and forgets the forest.The documentary highlights some of the details of the PTL exploitation by Jerry Falwell.  But anyone familiar with this man will find no surprises here.  Anytime this guy enters a scene, nearly anyone else looks better by default.  According to the report, the Bakkers were blackmailed into turning the empire over to Falwell's rat pack because he got word of Jim's sideline fling with what's-her-name.  This is some crowd we have here.  In his predictable manner, Falwell inserted a dagger into the Bakkers' empty skulls and thanked God for the opportunity.  Isn't he the suave one?  Falwell never fails to leave the kind of sick feeling one gets from a dead-baby joke.  I soon realized that this flick has no protagonist.One important point in favor of the movie is noteworthy.  The Bakkers' ministry was active during the outbreak of the HIV virus.  With the exception of Billy Graham, most conservative televangelists responded with bitter judgments of condemnation toward the gay community.  Some are well known today for the massive hatred they drilled into the minds of their congregations.  Tammy Faye was one of the very few to insist on reaching out to AIDS victims with genuine compassion.  She stressed that believers needed to embrace and love the gay community rather than condemn them.  But more to the point, Tammy Faye practiced this sermon.  She visited AIDS victims and spent valuable time with them.  For this reason many in the gay community have grown to respect Tammy Faye.  This is perhaps the one quality that makes her different from others of her ilk, and it is a quality worthy of both recognition and respect.The movie is well made.  It succeeded in gripping my emotion, but not with any earth-shattering revelations of the woman.  Tammy Faye simply is what she is.  The movie suggests that Tammy Faye deserves another chance at fame.  This viewer does not agree that she does.  Nonetheless, The Eyes of Tammy Faye is just possibly her best achievement in the entertainment industry to date.  Believe it or not, there's a real woman underneath all that makeup.",3,"Surprisingly Good Documentary, But. . .",1070409600,"12 3, 2003",2003,4515,"['Browsing', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'one', 'uneventful', 'evening', 'was', 'jolted', 'momentarily', 'when', 'stumbled', 'movie', '88', 'percent', 'approval', 'rating', 'pinched', 'Were', 'Jim', 'Tammy', 'Bakker', 'perhaps', 'judged', 'too', 'quickly', 'collapse', 'massive', 'empire', 'possible', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'actually', 'cognitive', 'activity', 'working', 'upstairs', 'Nah.I', 'soon', 'realized', 'quality', 'flick', 'lay', 'production', 'documentary', 'not', 'human', 'product', 'involved', 'Barbato', 'company', 'paint', 'cute', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'televangelist', 'caught', 'up', 'host', 'scandals', 'none', 'ever', 'saw', 'coming', 'True', 'title', 'movie', 'based', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'side', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'little', 'options', 'other', 'possibilities.There', 'fundamental', 'problem', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'ilk', 'woman', 'knowledge', 'even', 'faint', 'curiosity', 'ancient', 'ancestors', 'culture', 'documents', 'own', 'proclaimed', 'faith', 'Scripture', 'something', 'exploit', 'needed', 'not', 'research', 'necessary', 'not', 'minister', 'celebrity', 'Bakkers', 'never', 'revealed', 'anything', 'otherwise', 'whole', 'crowd', 'commonly', 'known', 'televangelists', 'practice', 'kind', 'top-40', 'version', 'Christianity', 'as', 'plastic', 'imaginations', 'TV', 'circus', 'performances', 'are', 'embarrassment', 'humankind.Tammy', 'Faye', 'certainly', 'nice', 'qualities', 'person', 'clearly', 'quite', 'likeable', 'own', 'way', 'movie', 'delivers', 'trait', 'well', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'possess', 'wonderful', 'qualities', 'ever', 'getting', 'crack', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'impressively', 'horrors', 'tragedies', 'Tammy', 'endured', 'career', 'certainly', 'one', 'such', 'torment', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'brought', 'cinema', 'so', 'might', 'share', 'grief', 'well', 'one', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'fact', 'others', 'know', 'personal', 'lives.So', 'what', 'exactly', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'worthy', 'special', 'attention', 'movie', 'silent', 'point', 'quite', 'privilege', 'casually', 'rake', 'millions', 'singing', 'rudimentary', 'ditties', 'shedding', 'superficial', 'tears', 'Ministers', 'How', 'realistic', 'identify', 'Bakkers', 'sort', 'link', 'human', 'consciousness', 'sacred', 'deity', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'trees', 'forest.The', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'details', 'PTL', 'exploitation', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'man', 'will', 'find', 'surprises', 'here', 'Anytime', 'guy', 'scene', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'else', 'better', 'default', 'According', 'report', 'Bakkers', 'were', 'blackmailed', 'turning', 'empire', 'Falwell', 'rat', 'pack', 'got', 'word', 'Jim', 'sideline', 'fling', ""what's-her-name"", 'crowd', 'have', 'here', 'predictable', 'manner', 'Falwell', 'inserted', 'dagger', 'Bakkers', 'empty', 'skulls', 'thanked', 'God', 'opportunity', ""n't"", 'suave', 'one', 'Falwell', 'never', 'leave', 'kind', 'sick', 'feeling', 'one', 'dead-baby', 'joke', 'soon', 'realized', 'flick', 'protagonist.One', 'important', 'point', 'favor', 'movie', 'noteworthy', 'Bakkers', 'ministry', 'was', 'active', 'outbreak', 'HIV', 'virus', 'exception', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'most', 'conservative', 'televangelists', 'responded', 'bitter', 'judgments', 'condemnation', 'gay', 'community', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'today', 'massive', 'hatred', 'drilled', 'minds', 'congregations', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'insist', 'reaching', 'out', 'AIDS', 'victims', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'stressed', 'believers', 'needed', 'embrace', 'love', 'gay', 'community', 'rather', 'condemn', 'more', 'point', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'practiced', 'sermon', 'visited', 'AIDS', 'victims', 'spent', 'valuable', 'time', 'reason', 'many', 'gay', 'community', 'have', 'grown', 'respect', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'perhaps', 'one', 'quality', 'different', 'others', 'ilk', 'quality', 'worthy', 'recognition', 'respect.The', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'succeeded', 'gripping', 'emotion', 'not', 'earth-shattering', 'revelations', 'woman', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'simply', 'what', 'movie', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'chance', 'fame', 'viewer', 'not', 'agree', 'Nonetheless', 'Eyes', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'just', 'possibly', 'best', 'achievement', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'date', 'Believe', 'not', 'real', 'woman', 'makeup']",The Eyes of Tammy Faye

She was never afraid of looking like a fool or of confronting her own and other people's flaws; and she never wallowed in resentment or self-pity - after her whole world imploded she got up and she got out and she DID.I thank the producers of this movie for showing her exactly as she was. The Christians who despise gays are no more hypocritical and evil than the secular people who despise Tammy Faye because she's different.She fits no stereotype, any more than I fit any stereotype of what a gay man should be.

Brown ""El Rudo Lucky Pierre!""","[26, 27]","Since the PTL Club scandal in the 1980s, Tammy Faye Bakker has become one of the all time greats of the eccentric pop-culture icons. The PTL financial scandal and Jim Bakker's affair with Jessica Hahn have faded from front page news stories and into a tiny dot on the historical map. Tammy Faye, however, still pops up in pop media frequently enough to be more recognizable than ex-hubby Jim, not to mention the almost forgotten Hahn.""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" delivers a well documented history of Jim and Tammy Faye's rise to fame on the TV Evangelist circuit, their fall from grace, and where the dice landed for Tammy Faye. If this were a film exclusively about the PTL scandal, this docu would come up short; but the main focus here is on Tammy Faye the individual. In doing so, the film makers did an excellent job of presenting the most important aspects of the scandal in a nutshell, and giving us a three-dimensional view of Tammy Faye.Early on, this documentary shows a genuinely sweet side of Tammy Faye, telling of her unhappy childhood, and how the religion she grew up with was just one big monolithic intimidator, threatening the believers with eternal damnation. Instead of Tammy Faye taking this fear into adulthood, she instead turns it upside down, and preaches Christianity to the TV public with compassion. Particularly moving is a clip from a PTL Club episode where she has an AIDS activist on the show; wherein you would often see TV preachers brag that they will cure AIDS victims of their lifestyle and illness, Tammy Faye brings the activist on the show with compassion. They discuss the battle against AIDS, never bagging on the gay lifestyle.Another reason to check out this documentary is to catch the disturbing info on Jerry Falwell taking command of The PTL Network. Dislike Falwell and his Moral Majority? You will despise both after seeing this account of his betrayal.Much of the film is presented with snipets of old Praise The Lord Television footage, narration by Ru Paul, lots of funky hand puppets (an explanation for that comes early on in the film) and through the lips of Tammy Faye herself. While the documentary is sympathetic to Tammy Faye, she shows through her own words that she is still in denial about the misappropriation of funds husband Jim tolled.

528448,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,B00003CXL4,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[6, 8]","We rented this mainly because we like documentaries and this was supposed to be a good one. I was very impressed, and also moved. I remember not being able to stand the sight of this woman back in the 80's, and being extremely satisfied when the Bakker's empire crumbled very publicly. Maybe I just got sick of hearing about them, and the media did not exactly paint a flattering portrait. I started out this movie feeling pity for Tammy Faye, but began to admire her as it went on. I had no idea she was gay-friendly way before it was fashionable to do so(and even now, I don't think there are too many gay-friendly televangelists), and had no clue that she had a TV talk show with an openly gay co-host. Not to make media headlines for being 'daring', either. With many other celebrities, you get the feeling they figured out, &quot;Hmmm, gay men seem to really love me, I think I'll use this and cash in on it&quot;. With Tammy it's clear that she is not calculating at all but just a very friendly person with no prejudice. The movie, narrated by RuPaul, chronicles her life, and gives her side of the story of the scandals. There are interviews with her current and ex-husband, and many of her friends, people she worked with, and biographers. The film includes great archival footage of her early television shows (if you think she has big hair *now*, just wait) to her later ones. The movie is divided up into chapters that are introduced with sock-puppets (this is not as ridiculous as it sounds, though the movie has plenty of humor). In one scene Tammy confronts a reporter who wrote a very unflattering, and Tammy says untrue, book about the PTL Empire. This and several other scenes are hard to watch (though it's fun to see the reporter stammer when Tammy asks him point blank why he printed lies about her). In another scene I felt like watching through my hands over my eyes, during a point in her life when she was addicted to prescription drugs, we see Tammy sort of wandering off in the middle of a broadcast to remark on the backdrop, pretty whacked out. When I found out the circumstances that led to her doctor prescribing something to calm her down, I wasn't disgusted but more surprised that she wasn't taking every narcotic she could get her hands on at the time. I remember thinking back in the 80's that anyone who walked around looking like Tammy and carrying herself confidently was out of their mind, or at best, delusional. At some point during the movie- probably a scene where she cheerfully pitches ideas for TV shows to someone probably 20 years younger than her at the USA Network (you get the feeling maybe he won't make fun of her as soon as she's out the door, but it's easy to imagine him having a good laugh with someone he knows later as he tells them about his encounter)- I realized she is just, well, being herself. She knows that her heavy eye makeup is &quot;her trademark&quot;, and is proud of it. Let's face it, it takes real guts for this woman just to walk down the street when most people consider her a punchline, a cartoon, a freak, or all three. She is not a stupid woman and knows this, but holds her head up high anyway, and carries herself proudly. How many people would be brave enough to do that? I never thought I'd say this, but after seeing this, I have a newfound respect for Tammy Faye. If the film-makers intentions were to have people view the subject of their documentary in a different light, then they did an excellent job, and I don't have any complaints about it at all. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about Tammy (even if only out of morbid curiousity, like I did at first) and loves a fascinating, touching documentary. Be sure to wear waterproof mascara when watching it, though. A note on the DVD-not much in the way of extras, though it does include the theatrical trailer. However, I'd still recommend it wholeheartedly.

The complete history of Tammy is resurrected from her childhood to first meeting with Jim Bakker to her current limbo status. The most fascinating aspect of this woman is her resilience. Starting from a scrappy beginning as TV evangelists, Tammy and Jim rose quickly and famously to the top of the religious networks. The PTL recreational park is second to Disneyland!It's not an intentional site gag to watch her makeup grow more intense with the years. She has survived failure after failure and still keeps on going, running on her fuel from God. Her attitude is nearly obnoxiously upbeat and her refusal to be vindictive is impressive (or is denial a big part of her survival)? Note that the ""Reverend"" Jerry Falwall is shown as more than a villain here, which makes Tammy all the more precious. Regardless, she proves to be a remarkable study and a compassionate person as well. It's difficult to not be impressed by her stamina, but her cheerfulness can be near manic. The directors have introduced a nice spin by having high-voiced hand puppets introduce each segment. The pitch of their voices is not far from Tammy's.

528451,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00003CXL4,mirasreviews,"[8, 8]","In ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"", documentarians Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato explore the life and tribulations of televangelism's biggest star of the 1980s, the ""first lady of religious broadcasting"", Tammy Faye Bakker. Narrator RuPaul Charles takes us back to Tammy Faye's Minnesota childhood as the eldest of 8 children in a fundamentalist Assemblies of God household, through her marriage to Jim Bakker and their many successes, to her life in near isolation in Palm Desert, California, 12 years after scandal and financial troubles brought a dramatic end to Jim and Tammy Faye's broadcasting empire and their marriage. (This film was made in 1999. Tammy Faye now lives in North Carolina and suffers from lung cancer.) Through clips of the Bakkers' television shows and interviews with Tammy Faye, Jim Bakker, their children, Tammy Faye's 2nd husband and Heritage USA contractor Roe Messner, law professor James A. Albert, and ""Charlotte Observer"" journalist  Charles Shepard, among others, ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" presents an intriguing portrait of Tammy Faye's personality and values, as well as some insight into the PTL organization that the scandal-mongering media didn't often provide back when everything came tumbling down.""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" is sympathetic to Tammy Faye -and her maquillage- which is a nice respite from the often cruel and disproportionate attacks she has undergone in the press. The filmmakers present Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker as more ingenuous than ruthless or greedy -a view shared even by their critics. Their ingenuousness and simple, optimistic nature was a large part of their appeal. And it was a large part of their undoing. Jim Bakker didn't have the sophistication to competently manage PTL's finances, which became increasingly apparent as he tried to construct and maintain the ambitious ""Heritage USA"" Christian resort in Fort Mill, SC. ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" comes down hard on the Machiavellian tactics of the far more fanatic Jerry Falwell. Non-Christian observers (of which I am one) tend to lump televangelists in the same category, but the contrast between the ruthless ambition and fire-and-brimstone sermons of Falwell or Pat Robertson and the naive over-the-top enthusiasm and inclusiveness of the Bakkers is stark. ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye"" provides a valuable second look at Tammy Faye for those of us who only knew the scandal. No, she's not clever or tasteful, but she isn't what the secular press or Jerry Falwell made her out to be either.

What's crystal clear is the impact it had on me.I suppose like most who are as outside of the secular, fundamentalist strong hold Tammy Faye was little more than a cartoon to me, someone to be laughed at for a moment and quickly forgotten.But the joke, if there was one, was most definitely on me.The documentary succeeds in stripping away the cruelty of the media hype surrounding her - and at the end of the day and certainly by the end of the film you see her as the fearless and forgiving person of both strength an faith that she was in truth and in life.She was uniq ue to say the least and a survivor to say the most.The film is accurate in the portrayal of how Falwell robbed the Bakers of PTL and shed new light with painfully accurate detail of how Tammy was manipulated and abused by the heavy, greed based hierarchy of Evangelical Christians. Tammy never succumbed - not entirely to their hate driven mantra, instead she remained true to herself and her core beliefs that God didn't create garbage and dirt. We were all, even us LGBT folk children of God. And at that time this was an awfully brave position to take.The first person to physically hug someone with AIDS publicly. She was fearless and in her own quiet way fighting  against the tainted ideology of Fanatical Fundamentalist Christians by refusing to be bullied -  as a woman and a person of faith.The documentary has it's light hearted moments and I would imagine even the most critical curmudgeon would find themselves cheering her on while falling victim, and happily so to her endearing charm.Sold out by the men in her life - and towards the end abandoned by Messner himself. Her core beliefs were never shaken. Not her belief in the human condition, her love of people, her fierce individuality and of course her faith.

Due to its award recognition, I decided to give it a shot; I am pleased that I did. Tammy probably wanted to be a performer, more than anything else. Her innate Christian faith was something that was inside her from early years. She was not a phony. Enter Jim Bakker, and she found the opportunity to perform and join her husband (to whom she was very devoted) on a quest of unbelievable proportions. Her admission that she wasn't sophistocated enough for all this attention was from the heart. She wasn't stupid; that label was appropriate for Jimmy Bakker, however, since he allowed himself to be taken down, so mean-spiritedly, by the snake, Jerry Falwell, a truly evil man. There's a lot to be said, and this film says a lot. I'm left with the impression that Tammy Faye was as sincere as can be about everything she did, with or without PTL, and I have new-found admiration for this relatively simple woman who  was nave enough to fall victim to the corporate empire of televangelists. So much for good intentions, but I like the person and I especially like the film for changing my mind about a sweet woman who was a victim of her own circumstances. The film-makers should be commended for not making a circus of Jimmy's indiscretions, though gold-digger Jessica Hahn is presented for exactly what she is. Tammy's pioneering efforts for gay rights is legendary, and I thought that the inclusion of RuPaul's narration might've made Tammy a campy carricature. Again, I was wrong.

Penola,"[9, 10]","Tammy Faye Baker, who took up more than her fifteen minutes of fame throughout the excesses of her then-husband Jim's PTL digressions, always  struck me as pathetic and possibly manipulative; her mascara-stained eyes  seemed to become water-works like an actress who is able to cry on cue.  This affectionate, albeit skewed-in-her-favor documentary paints a portrait  of the woman that surprised and charmed me.  With a campy sensibility, and  obvious gay humor, this film exposes facts about Tammy's human fraility,  her early embrace of homosexuals (particularly the scourge of AIDS in its  earliest days), her naivete and ignorance of much of the politics of her  husband's empire, and her &quot;simple country girl&quot; heart.  Her  present-day tears created a true hush in the packed house, and stirred more  than a few hearts.  Tammy Faye may be seeking the limelight because that it  is a place where she feels at home -- but in the final moments of this  riveting, entertaining and engagingly fresh documentary, I believe her  testaments of faith and her renewed sense of priorities as never before.  All great documentaries should illuminate their subjects in ways that  inform, entertain, and challenge -- even with its heart on its sleeve, this  one does precisely that, and provides key glimpses into the telegenic power  and real talent that propelled a nation of Bible-thumpers to love Tammy  Faye in the first place.",5,REVELATION!,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,1432,"['Tammy', 'Faye', 'Baker', 'who', 'took', 'up', 'more', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'fame', 'excesses', 'then-husband', 'Jim', 'PTL', 'digressions', 'always', 'struck', 'pathetic', 'possibly', 'manipulative', 'mascara-stained', 'eyes', 'seemed', 'become', 'water-works', 'actress', 'who', 'able', 'cry', 'cue', 'affectionate', 'skewed-in-her-favor', 'documentary', 'paints', 'portrait', 'woman', 'surprised', 'charmed', 'campy', 'sensibility', 'obvious', 'gay', 'humor', 'film', 'facts', 'Tammy', 'human', 'fraility', 'early', 'embrace', 'homosexuals', 'particularly', 'scourge', 'AIDS', 'earliest', 'days', 'naivete', 'ignorance', 'much', 'politics', 'husband', 'empire', 'quot', 'simple', 'country', 'girl', 'quot', 'heart', 'present-day', 'tears', 'created', 'true', 'hush', 'packed', 'house', 'stirred', 'more', 'few', 'hearts', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'may', 'be', 'seeking', 'limelight', 'place', 'where', 'home', 'final', 'moments', 'riveting', 'entertaining', 'engagingly', 'fresh', 'documentary', 'believe', 'testaments', 'faith', 'renewed', 'sense', 'priorities', 'never', 'great', 'documentaries', 'should', 'illuminate', 'subjects', 'ways', 'inform', 'entertain', 'challenge', 'even', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'one', 'precisely', 'key', 'glimpses', 'telegenic', 'power', 'real', 'talent', 'propelled', 'nation', 'Bible-thumpers', 'love', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'first', 'place']",The Eyes of Tammy Faye

The jovial tone of the documentary is really the key to the film for a couple of reasons.  First, it allows us to have fun at Tammy Faye's expense (and besides her make-up, there is still much about her that is worth poking fun at -- the archival footage of the Bakkers hosting a show while Tammy Faye was hooked on prescription drugs is the film's highlight), and her participation in the fun makes it easier for the audience to laugh along.  Secondly, to allow us to look back on her past hardships with so much humour, instead of bitterness, does give the impression that she is one hell of a survivor.  My impression of Tammy Faye before seeing the documentary had been cemented by the mainstream media, which has made her out to be a rich, spoiled and corrupt witch.  So you can imagine my shock as I realized that Tammy Faye had completely won me over by the end of the film.  My immediate reaction to this was that I had been manipulated and I complained that the directors must have felt too much affection for Tammy Faye since the audience was never exposed to the evil side of her character.  However, after considering the film a little more, I realized that Tammy Faye is likely to be too self-unaware and too much of an exhibitionist to actually hide the less pleasant aspects of her personality.  This is what makes her the perfect documentary subject.  Whether the camera is there or not, Tammy Faye's personality is as constant as her permanent eyelashes.",4,Tammy Faye is just as fascinating as her life!,991958400,"06 8, 2001",2001,1649,"['knew', 'nothing', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'Bakker', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'fascinating', 'life', 'been', 'also', 'just', 'how', 'fascinating', 'period', 'jovial', 'tone', 'documentary', 'really', 'key', 'film', 'couple', 'reasons', 'First', 'have', 'fun', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'expense', 'make-up', 'still', 'much', 'worth', 'poking', 'fun', 'archival', 'footage', 'Bakkers', 'hosting', 'show', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'was', 'hooked', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'film', 'highlight', 'participation', 'fun', 'easier', 'audience', 'laugh', 'along', 'Secondly', 'allow', 'look', 'back', 'past', 'hardships', 'so', 'much', 'humour', 'instead', 'bitterness', 'give', 'impression', 'one', 'hell', 'survivor', 'impression', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'had', 'been', 'cemented', 'mainstream', 'media', 'made', 'be', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'corrupt', 'witch', 'can', 'imagine', 'shock', 'realized', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'had', 'completely', 'won', 'end', 'film', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'was', 'had', 'been', 'manipulated', 'complained', 'directors', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'affection', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'audience', 'was', 'never', 'exposed', 'evil', 'side', 'character', 'However', 'considering', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'realized', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'likely', 'be', 'too', 'self-unaware', 'too', 'much', 'exhibitionist', 'actually', 'hide', 'less', 'pleasant', 'aspects', 'personality', 'what', 'perfect', 'documentary', 'subject', 'camera', 'there', 'not', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'personality', 'as', 'constant', 'permanent', 'eyelashes']",The Eyes of Tammy Faye

Its amazing but it can happen, I always thought had the impression of her that wasn't so kind, honestly it was down right mean.  I can say that after watching this, my impression of Tammy Faye is every different.Yes, she loves to wear crazy wigs, and uses more mascara in a month than I will use in my lifetime.  What I found surprising was that she and her ex husband created so much of the current televangalism movement that we have.  The 700 club, and the TBN, were projects that they helped to create.  Yes, they did run into some financial problems, was it over ambition on their part?  Most likely.Some good points were brought out about the scandal was that they didn't intentionally deceive, and secondly that was a heck of a lot of work to do for so little financial gain on their part.  One thing that rings clear through the movie is that she is definately filled with love for people, and harbors no ill feelings towards her ex husband.I walked away from this movie with empathy for her, she has been truly villified, and she continues onward.

Tammy Faye was an awful singer and she loved performing schmaltzy puppet shows. Bad music and bad puppetry take up a lot of this movie. Tammy Faye was interesting only because she got caught stealing from the faithful. Once you got past that, she was shallow.The Eyes of Tammy Faye is bad. Tammy Faye was old news when she appeared in this film. The viewer watches her dreary attempts at a comeback as she visits a photographer for headshots and unsuccessfully pitches ideas for TV shows. The final impression is that she could not believe that her 15 minutes of fame were over.The film should focus more on the PTL scandal. Tammy Faye accepts no responsibility for PTL's collapse. One Bakker apologist says that Jim would not have stolen only [...] million when he raised [...] million. Why not? [...] million is a lot of money; perhaps Jim didn't think that he could get away with stealing more; perhaps he had planned to steal the rest of it.There are interesting scenes in The Eyes of Tammy Faye. Tammy Faye had many setbacks and showed courage in persevering. An AIDS patient appeared on Jim and Tammy Faye's show; it is commendable that they were not homophobes. The film, however, makes too much of this appearance, portraying Tammy Faye as a great champion of gays.

Additionally, I had read Jim Bakker's book, &quot;I Was Wrong,&quot; and Richard Dortch's, &quot;Integrity.&quot;  Yet, this film showed me, as never before, how people can cling so tenaciously to faith in the midst of adversity--and even in the midst of personal sin.  It also showed that Tammy has lived up to the byline of their shows, &quot;You can make it!&quot;Another amazing aspect is that Jim Bakker participated in the production.  My guess would have been that he would still be too hurt that his wife divorced him.  Yet, he demonstrated true admiration for his former spouse--showing an ability to forgive even what is often treated as the unpardonable sin.The producers also dramatized the Falwell take over of PTL in a manner that was clear, objective, and yet rather humorous.  I had never understood exactly how that all happened, even after reading Bakker and Dortch's separate accounts.My one complaint is that the puppets lent a flippant, almost sarcastic tone to a film, that, while light-hearted, also deals with serious issues of human nature and spirituality.
