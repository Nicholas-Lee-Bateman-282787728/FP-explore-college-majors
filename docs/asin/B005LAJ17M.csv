The idea is great, you just have to have a tolerance for the slow pace and the sometimes downright mundane approach to spy craft and the lives of spies.  It reminds me of ""Tinker, Tailor,..."" except that was far more depressing - probably because it took over two hours and this show sets you free from the torture in less than 60 minutes.

The lead actress is especially good during the later part of the season when she has to go through a major personal transition.  It shows good acting ability.  (I am being vague here so that those who have not seen the season would not have the ending spoiled.)

Fine acting, sure, but the last thing I want to see after another depressing day at work is a series that reminds us of all the religious hate in this world.Not one moment in this series did I ever smile, let alone laugh.Dark and depressing.I couldn't help but feel like the show was trying to brainwash me into understanding why extremist muslims do what they do.This series, as well as it is acted, is anything but entertaining.It's DEPRESSING.And incredibly contrived to try to sway non-muslims into understanding why muslims murder innocent people. Civilians. Not soldiers.Wouldn't it be refreshing if the producers of this would make a series that tried to explain to the world why muslims want to kill americans so much? They seem to kill their own kind even more than anyone else. 9-11 killed how many americans? How many muslims did america kill in retaliation?

Unfortunately, it wasn't.Episodes move at a snails pace and there seems too little of interest to create any desire to continue and watch the next episode.The writing is weak and the program appears to have been created on a shoe-string budget. I gave up about half-way through the first season as I just did not want to waste any more time watching this program.The writers take an incredible leap from reality in order to fit each episode into a slot that appears to lead to a desired conclusion. Nothing that takes place in any of these episodes is believable and everything appears disjointed. Examples: If you are going to tail someone, certainly you are going to follow them so closely that they could not miss seeing you in their rear-view mirrors and, if you know a subject is going to be polygraphed, by all means tell them what the examiner is going to be asking them about so they can avoid registering an emotional response during the examination.These writers appear far too inexperienced to be able to write convincingly about this subject matter and there is nothing intellectual or clever about this ""Homeland"" series.A major problem with this series is that it is just too boring to complete. The characters are thin to the point of being transparent and it is impossible to care about any of the characters.  You will not care if one or all the characters are eliminated as there is just nothing likeable about any of them.

1492123,A1P0FB2NTOHGVF,B005LAJ17M,Dave Bridge,"[12, 25]","I've now struggled, gritting and/or gnashing my teeth the whole time, through the first three episodes of this Showtime cable series and I'm forced to say that, in my evidently lonely view, it's the worst, most aggravatingly offensive piece of tasteless trash I've seen since I watched the first episode of a show called Breaking Bad about a chemistry professor who discovers he has terminal lung cancer and turns to making crystal meth to lay up a nest egg for his family. What grand entertainment! As with that dreadful vehicle, there are no - repeat, no - even remotely likeable characters in Homeland, especially Carrie Mathison, the hyper-obsessive, bipolar psycho on an obviously self-redeeming witch hunt based on the thinnest of evidence - a whispered comment by a dying agent with zero specifics. She is either sitting around watching Brody have sex with his wife or, much worse, masturbate in front of her (which almost made me vomit) on TV monitors fed by spy cameras implausibly and illegally implanted in every room of the Brody house except, of course, the garage so we can get a tantalizing peek at Brody doing his suspicious Muslim prayers. This goes brobdingnagian leagues beyond any simple wiretapping. Then we get to see her wiping her vagina while brushing her teeth (a very edifying and important addition to the story, although perhaps it does say something revealing about the character), not to mention getting her ""assets"" killed in dark alleys after swearing to protect them. Have I missed something? What is there to like about this suppurating rubbish? A 16 year-old girl describing the game of Hearts as ""c--t hunt"" at the family breakfast table, or telling her mother about the fact she knows she's been busy ""f-----g Dad's good friend Mike"" (which we got to graphically see in the opening scenes), and all of this apparently on prime time cable TV (finding out that Obama was a big fan was somehow the coup de grace; does he make time to watch such drivel between campaigning, golf, and vacations?). Who are the good guys - the bad guys? Who can tell? Is it anti-Islam, anti-American, or both in equal measure? I'd say the latter. Was Brody a prisoner in Iraq or Afghanistan? We seem to get it both ways. Al Qaeda's Abu Nazir nauseatingly cuddles Brody like a baby after he graphically beats his black friend to death, evidently at Nazir's orders. Good grief! It sure isn't The Joy of Sex, although there's much more than enough of that (and reams of profanity, nudity, and other gratuitous offal), all of it a total turn-off. Even the kids are constantly using the ""F"" word. Screening girls clad only in thong panties for the Sheik's harem was a particularly scintillating scene, especially when the aforementioned (and doomed) ""asset"", after asking how an applicant feels about anal sex and sex with girls, feels her crotch and then orders a Brazilian wax because the Sheikh doesn't care for hair.(Do beautiful young girls really line up eagerly to apply to be sex slaves for rich Arab sheiks? What a repellent thought, but probably they do. Greed is everywhere - especially in Hollywood.) And where is this incredibly thin plot going anyway? Brody either is or is not going to turn out to be what Mathison is so sure he is - something the audience is apparently destined to waste years waiting to find out - and then what? In fact, who cares? Mystery? Tension? A nail-biting ""thriller""? Award-winning performances? A lot of enthusiastic reviewers seem to think so and have lavished outrageous praise on it, but I'm certainly not among them. The Manchurian Candidate was a pretty good movie - a bit far-fetched maybe, but mercifully short and still pretty good thanks to Lawrence Harvey and Frank Sinatra - but this transparent and ridiculous lift from that hoary old plot is pathetic and so is everyone in it.",1,Worst TV show ever produced,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,3843,"[""'ve"", 'now', 'struggled', 'gritting', 'and/or', 'gnashing', 'teeth', 'whole', 'time', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'Showtime', 'cable', 'series', ""'m"", 'forced', 'say', 'evidently', 'lonely', 'view', 'worst', 'most', 'aggravatingly', 'offensive', 'piece', 'tasteless', 'trash', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'show', 'called', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'chemistry', 'professor', 'who', 'terminal', 'lung', 'cancer', 'making', 'crystal', 'meth', 'lay', 'up', 'nest', 'egg', 'family', 'What', 'grand', 'entertainment', 'dreadful', 'vehicle', 'are', 'repeat', 'even', 'remotely', 'likeable', 'characters', 'Homeland', 'especially', 'Carrie', 'Mathison', 'hyper-obsessive', 'bipolar', 'psycho', 'obviously', 'self-redeeming', 'witch', 'hunt', 'based', 'thinnest', 'evidence', 'whispered', 'comment', 'dying', 'agent', 'zero', 'specifics', 'either', 'sitting', 'watching', 'Brody', 'have', 'sex', 'wife', 'much', 'worse', 'masturbate', 'front', 'almost', 'made', 'vomit', 'TV', 'monitors', 'fed', 'spy', 'cameras', 'implausibly', 'illegally', 'implanted', 'room', 'Brody', 'house', 'course', 'garage', 'can', 'get', 'tantalizing', 'peek', 'Brody', 'doing', 'suspicious', 'Muslim', 'prayers', 'brobdingnagian', 'leagues', 'simple', 'wiretapping', 'Then', 'get', 'see', 'wiping', 'vagina', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'very', 'edifying', 'important', 'addition', 'story', 'perhaps', 'say', 'something', 'revealing', 'character', 'not', 'mention', 'getting', 'assets', 'killed', 'dark', 'alleys', 'swearing', 'protect', 'Have', 'missed', 'something', 'What', 'there', 'like', 'suppurating', 'rubbish', '16', 'year-old', 'girl', 'describing', 'game', 'Hearts', 'c', 't', 'hunt', 'family', 'breakfast', 'table', 'telling', 'mother', 'fact', 'been', 'busy', 'f', '-g', 'Dad', 'good', 'friend', 'Mike', 'got', 'graphically', 'see', 'opening', 'scenes', 'apparently', 'prime', 'time', 'cable', 'TV', 'finding', 'out', 'Obama', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'was', 'somehow', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'make', 'time', 'watch', 'such', 'drivel', 'campaigning', 'golf', 'vacations', 'Who', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'Who', 'can', 'tell', 'anti-Islam', 'anti-American', 'equal', 'measure', ""'d"", 'say', 'latter', 'Was', 'Brody', 'prisoner', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'seem', 'get', 'ways', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'Abu', 'Nazir', 'nauseatingly', 'Brody', 'baby', 'graphically', 'black', 'friend', 'death', 'evidently', 'Nazir', 'orders', 'Good', 'grief', 'sure', ""n't"", 'Joy', 'Sex', 'much', 'more', 'enough', 'reams', 'profanity', 'nudity', 'other', 'gratuitous', 'offal', 'total', 'turn-off', 'Even', 'kids', 'are', 'constantly', 'using', 'F', 'word', 'Screening', 'girls', 'only', 'thong', 'panties', 'Sheik', 'harem', 'was', 'particularly', 'scintillating', 'scene', 'especially', 'when', 'aforementioned', 'doomed', 'asset', 'asking', 'how', 'applicant', 'feels', 'anal', 'sex', 'sex', 'girls', 'crotch', 'then', 'orders', 'Brazilian', 'wax', 'Sheikh', ""n't"", 'care', 'hair', 'Do', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girls', 'really', 'line', 'up', 'eagerly', 'apply', 'be', 'sex', 'slaves', 'rich', 'Arab', 'sheiks', 'What', 'repellent', 'thought', 'probably', 'do', 'Greed', 'everywhere', 'especially', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'incredibly', 'thin', 'plot', 'going', 'anyway', 'Brody', 'not', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'what', 'Mathison', 'so', 'sure', 'something', 'audience', 'apparently', 'destined', 'waste', 'years', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'then', 'what', 'fact', 'who', 'Mystery', 'Tension', 'nail-biting', 'thriller', 'Award-winning', 'performances', 'lot', 'enthusiastic', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'think', 'so', 'have', 'lavished', 'outrageous', 'praise', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'maybe', 'mercifully', 'short', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'thanks', 'Lawrence', 'Harvey', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'transparent', 'ridiculous', 'lift', 'hoary', 'old', 'plot', 'pathetic', 'so', 'everyone']",Homeland: Season 1

To my delight, along comes Homeland - written in collaboration by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa (the genius behind the series ""24"").  This pairing is able to create a gripping, edge of your seat drama that will keep viewers coming back.  With the skill of taking pieces of history and making it into a thriller drama for TV, we are introduced to 3 main characters who work with and against each other.  The personal dynamic is fascinating and Claire Danes plays a Bi-Polar, manic-ridden CIA agent.  Determined and completely consumed, she goes after her nemesis a US Marine POW (Brody) who has supposedly ""turned"" and could be working for terrorists.It's a gripping show that had me from the first episode.  My first exposure to Homeland was on a Sunday where I watched them as a marathon.  It was impossible to stop (much like ""24"").  We are now just in to Season 2 and the twists and turns are already beginning.The acting on this show is awesome and convincing.  Claire Danes' acting is mind-boggling!

This is a Showtime drama, but it is produced by Fox 21, a studio known for rehashing shows over and over again, complete with fluff and diluted episodes. This is just a bad show. I stopped watching after the free pilot episode came out last year, but bought the Blu-Ray in the hopes that the show would be better uncensored and complete. The first few episodes were actually decent, but over time, Claire Danes just got to me. She is a grating, annoying actress. She is not very convincing as a CIA analyst at all. She would never get hired as one, I'm sorry. She is just not a very appealing leading woman for a show. Damien Lewis is the most generic, boring actor I've ever seen. I don't hate him, yet I don't think he's a great actor either. He never will be. It's as simple as that. He is someone that should come cheap, as an actor. For this line of work, an actor needs to stand out; he just can't.I watched until episode 8 or 9, then just gave up. After watching some truly bizarre, random, filler episodes, and seeing ridiculous twists that I swear I predicted around the first or second episode, I turned off. The show just kept getting worse. This is a great show for kids or people that don't watch much TV or get out much. If you are not any of those, skip the show. It's ludicrous. I mean, the main character is away from his wife for 8 years, presumed dead, returns to his wife and doesn't ever broach the notion of whether she saw anyone else, why she didn't remarry and whether she even wants or can be with him anymore. It felt like he just returned from a day of work. Really bad writing. His wife is a lousy actress, chosen more for her striking looks than realism.I hope a lot more people stop taking the Emmy's seriously after trying Homeland out. The Emmy's totally ignored The Wire and Oz for years, for crying out loud. I'll give you three guesses as to what both shows had in common. For Homeland to get numerous acclaim, and for The Wire and Oz to not, raises serious questions.

A Marine is captured, tortured & then becomes a muslim & a terrorist. Riiiiiiight! Other than the fact that this has never happened & never would the plot is just fine. Name one Marine that would see his fellow grunts killed & then turn muslim & terrorist. It ain't a gonna happen. Then, to add to this foul brew, it turns out that the CIA chick is psychotic! Now I could see this if they were the prez or a politician...but the CIA? For crying out loud, they would find this out, even if they couldn't pick up 911 or the fall of the Berlin Wall. Lewis is quite wooden & so brittle as an actor in this film that if he fell down he would break. His co-star is even worse. Frankly, she is a worse actor ran Demi Moore, if possible. This is just about the most unrealistic show in this genre that I've ever seen. For example, the CIA building has HUGE windows so enemy spies can hear conversations via electronic devices. Then Lewis is show yelling at his captain about ""fighting his bulls...war"" as if this would really happen in the military. If so, he'd be on KP for the rest of his known life. Predictably, the Marine's best friend is shanking his wife & the gal's CIA bosses let her get away w/ murder w/o any consequences. RIIIIIGHT! I want my money back.  Frankly, there is no motive for Lewis to be a turncoat & this show defines the worst of Hollywood. Please, go see something else!
