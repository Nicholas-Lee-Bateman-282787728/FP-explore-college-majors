This way we'll never feel a connection towards any of the characters or their annoyingly cliche story lines. This movie feels more like a soap opera, or it could be a television miniseries with the amount of story they want to fit in one movie.  Cliche, cliche, cliche.  Haven't we seen all of these stories before in other movies, the same characters, etc.  Disney sure knows how to make a pretty lame movie about Prom.

But now I see.The film has all the things to fit as a ""chick flick"" but more realistic and a little more unexpected. Also, the music was very well picked. I'm an indie music fan and I recognized more of the half of the songs, I have to say it's one of the main reasons I liked this movie. The actors are good, especially Aimee Teegarden, that proofs that she can be able to be the main character and many more. Can't wait to get it, because it's a must have. Give it a chance.

1381556,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B0041KKYHY,Brian Maitland,"[0, 0]","OK, so it's Disney and you're not going to get a ""realistic"" nor a raunchy portrayal of prom night. Given that it's still an average movie at best. What's funny is in the five-minute ""Making Of"" extra they go on about the casting. I found that and the script the weakest of all. Sure Julie from ""Friday Night Nights"" (Aimee Teegarden) is as good as ever because, basically, she has the chops and the acting experience. Her chemistry with the Johnny Depp wannabe rebel character (played by newcomer Thomas McDonell) is good. If they stuck with that story throughout maybe you have a nice teen romance.Where the casting is let down is the guys, bar the goofy Lloyd who plays that nervous shy awkward guy trying to come out of his shell but a bit too late in senior year, are pretty much identikit stereotypes. Also, what is up with having a field lacrosse team for the jocks? Who plays field lacrosse at a public school and has it as the ""main"" team for the school? Since it was set in Michigan, why not use hockey? Or basketball? I mean, even football...but American Pie me lacrosse? Seriously?The other big problem is the script. Where are the laughs? It's not all that funny a movie. No classic lines. No zinging comebacks. No funny situations. There are lame attempts (the various ways apparently this scrioptwriter thinks boys ask girls to the prom involve spelling out ""Prom?"" in inventive ways) at it but they go nowhere. Plus with the myriad of couples they have in the movie, why not flesh out their roles a bit more. I found the dialogue very very boring. Even the whole Tyler-Simone-Jordan love triangle was so bland.There are plenty of better teen comedies that revolve around the prom out there and, yes, parents even ones that will be clean enough to not offend people who think movies should be as clean as 1950s TV series.",3,too Disneyfied,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,1836,"['OK', 'Disney', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'realistic', 'raunchy', 'portrayal', 'prom', 'night', 'Given', 'still', 'average', 'movie', 'best', 'What', 'funny', 'five-minute', 'Making', 'extra', 'go', 'casting', 'found', 'script', 'weakest', 'Sure', 'Julie', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Nights', 'Aimee', 'Teegarden', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'basically', 'chops', 'acting', 'experience', 'chemistry', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'wannabe', 'rebel', 'character', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Thomas', 'McDonell', 'good', 'stuck', 'story', 'maybe', 'have', 'nice', 'teen', 'romance.Where', 'casting', 'let', 'down', 'guys', 'bar', 'goofy', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'nervous', 'shy', 'awkward', 'guy', 'trying', 'come', 'shell', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'senior', 'year', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'identikit', 'stereotypes', 'Also', 'what', 'up', 'having', 'field', 'lacrosse', 'team', 'jocks', 'Who', 'field', 'lacrosse', 'public', 'school', 'main', 'team', 'school', 'was', 'set', 'Michigan', 'why', 'not', 'use', 'hockey', 'basketball', 'mean', 'even', 'football', 'American', 'Pie', 'lacrosse', 'Seriously', 'other', 'big', 'problem', 'script', 'Where', 'are', 'laughs', 'not', 'movie', 'classic', 'lines', 'zinging', 'comebacks', 'funny', 'situations', 'are', 'lame', 'attempts', 'various', 'ways', 'apparently', 'scrioptwriter', 'boys', 'ask', 'girls', 'prom', 'involve', 'spelling', 'Prom', 'inventive', 'ways', 'go', 'nowhere', 'myriad', 'couples', 'have', 'movie', 'why', 'not', 'flesh', 'out', 'roles', 'bit', 'more', 'found', 'dialogue', 'very', 'very', 'boring', 'Even', 'whole', 'Tyler-Simone-Jordan', 'love', 'triangle', 'was', 'so', 'bland.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'better', 'teen', 'comedies', 'revolve', 'prom', 'there', 'yes', 'parents', 'even', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'clean', 'enough', 'not', 'offend', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'as', 'clean', '1950s', 'TV', 'series']",N/A

The characters in the movie all have their own relationships and problems, but Prom brings everything together.  The main characters though are a classic good girl and bad boy, but there are many other great characters that surprise and make you laugh!  The movie doesn't have any sex, bad language or anything inappropriate so it is really good for any ages.  I think teens and pre-teens would really like this movie, I mean I did and I'm way to old for it!  I really like how the characters deal with going away to college issues, cheating, being a third wheel in a relationship, being dateless for Prom, and most importantly not judging someone without getting to know them.

1381560,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0041KKYHY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 4]","Prom.  The anxiety of trying to find a date, going with your friends to get a tuxedo or a dress, renting a limo and finding out what to do later in the night.And when it comes to movies, there have been a good number of prom films in the '80s from ""Footloose"" and ""Pretty In Pink"", the 90's with ""She's All That"", ""American Pie"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You"" but lately, prom films have become more horror-driven, and in recent memory for non-horror prom film's in recent years, the only thing that comes to mind is the 2004 film ""Mean Girls"" and the 2008 film ""High School Musical 3'.But in terms of a film that primarily focuses on a high school prom, I guess America's due for a new prom film.And so we have Disney's ""Prom"" directed by Joe Nussbaum (""George Lucas in Love"", ""American Pie Presents the Naked Mile"") and written by Katie Wech.The film focuses on a group of teenagers from the same high school preparing for the prom.VIDEO:""Prom"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1).  For the most part, ""Prom"" is a beautiful looking film.  Because there are so many characters, various locations, outdoor, indoor, you get a wide range of colors featured throughout the film.  Colors are absolutely vibrant, black levels are nice and deep and you can see actually see the detail on the faces of the characters as well.Picture quality is very good!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Prom"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue and musically driven.  So, dialogue and music is crystal clear and when it comes to surround usage, its pretty much the music that envelops the soundscape.  From Katy Perry's ""Firework"", Taio Cruz's ""Break Your Heart"" and plenty of Indie music playing throughout the film, definitely makes the film upbeat.  But aside from that, I don't recall any major use of the surround channels.  ""Prom"" is pretty much a front and center-channel driven film.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Prom"" comes with the following special features:Last Chance Lloyd - (10:18) Scenes featuring Lloyd trying to ask a girl out for the prom and his younger sister Tess trying to help him out.Putting On Prom - (5:58) Producer Justin Springer, writer Katie Wech and director Joe Nussbaum talk about how they cast the characters for the film and the cast talk about working with each other.Bloopers - (2:34) Outtakes from ""Prom"".Deleted Scenes - (7:44) Featuring an introduction by Director Joe Nussbaum and producer Justin Springer for each of the four deleted scenes.Music Videos - (24:16) Featuring the following music videos: All Star Weekend - Not Your Birthday, Neon Trees - Your Surrender, Moon - Time Stand, Nolan Sotillo - We Could Be Anything (English Version), Nolan Sotillo - Junto Lo Havemos Bien (Spanish Version), Those Dancing Days - I'll Be Yours and Girl in a Coma - Come On, Let's Go.EXTRAS:""Prom: 2-Disc Combo Pack"" comes with the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 Television, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 2.0 DVS Dolby Digital and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Also, a slip over case is included.JUDGMENT CALL:Prom films are not the easiest films to create especially if you incorporate many characters to the film.Back in 1999, ""She's All That"" incorporated a lot of people but opted to include Hollywood's up-and-coming stars such as singer Usher and Lil' Kim, actor Freddie Prinze , Paul Walker and actress Rachael Leigh Cook, Gabrielle Union and Anna Paquin.  But what made the film work was how you have high school life outside of the prom and everything leading to the prom as the climax.We have seen the efficacy from that formula for prom films such as ""Pretty in Pink"", ""Footloose"", ""Mean Girls""...you have to showcase the high school life of these characters and then lead to the prom.And sure, you have the banality of the dance scene, the fight scene that you typically get from prom films but with ""Prom"", the problem is that there is too much focus on different characters, there is not enough story development to make you care for them.  The only couple you are emotionally invested in is Nova and Jesse.  Two people who are opposites but are attracted to each other.But when it comes to the other characters of the film, you just don't care.  Mei and Jared, we assume they a long time couple but there was no plot device to setup the friction between the couple until later into the film.  The same goes with the love triangle between Tyler, Simone and Jordan.  Jordan's character wasn't really explored.  She shows up earlier in the film and disappears until prom day.There is so many of these situations where you felt blocks of story may have been edited out for time, that it's unfortunate.  In fact, there are deleted scenes that probably shouldn't have been cut out at all.  And this is sad, considering Joe Nussbaum mentions it right after his commentary for the deleted scenes, in which he tells viewers ""hopefully, you agree that these scenes should have been deleted""...but unfortunately, some should have stayed in.""Prom"" is a film that feels incomplete because the pacing of the storyline for the characters outside of Nova and Jesse is off.  I liken it to a child's first try at connect the dots.  When the child forgets to follow the correct order and miss a dot, the picture doesn't seem right.  It's the same thing with ""Prom"" and how it introduces so many characters without building the storyline around those characters.But Aimee Teegarden and Thomas McDonell do a wonderful job playing the main couple of the film.  For those who grew up in the '90s, it was quite interesting to see Christine Elise (who was the spunky teenager, Emily Valentine on ""Beverly Hills 90210') playing Jesse's mother and also a brief cameo by actress Faith Ford (""Murphy Brown"" and ""Hope & Faith"") as the mother of Nova.As for the Blu-ray, there a quite a few special features and its cool to see a good number of music videos included on the Blu-ray.  The only thing that I wish was included on the Blu-ray are the web episodes of ""Corey & Lucas For the Win"" featuring ""Prom"" Sophomores Cory (Cameron Monaghan) and Lucas (played by Nolan Sotillo).Obviously the purpose was to show how different types of students deal with prom and also, its target audience are more than likely tweens and teens who probably are not going to delve so much into how deep the story is.  If anything, it's a safe film as well, so parents wondering if there is going to be any hanky panky teen sex ala ""American Pie"", they need not worry about that with ""Prom"".  There is a fight scene and teens ditching class but nothing else beyond that.Overall, ""Prom"" has its fair share of fun moments but also is hurt by its missed potential.  If you are a tween, teen or a parent looking for an upbeat prom film, then Disney's ""Prom"" is definitely for you!",3,"Blu-ray: If you are a tween, teen or a parent looking for an upbeat prom film,

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[0, 0]","If you've ever seen a movie called ""Drive Me Crazy,"" starring Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier, you've essentially seen ""Prom.""  The same theme of an upbeat, overachiever forced to collaborate with a cocky, misunderstood rebel is central here.  Both characters overcome their initial disgust to fall in love and learn lessons about not judging by appearances.  Like ""Drive Me Crazy,"" there are several subplots involving the heroine's classmates.  One popular girl is grappling with the decision to stay with her unfaithful boyfriend; two boys find that an attractive girl is causing friction in their friendship; and another girl tries - vainly - to get a crush to ask her to the dance - though he claims to have an Internet hottie meeting him there.  How the last storyline plays out is one of the few surprises in the movie.""Prom,"" lacks the self-consciously witty dialogue of DMC, which makes it a decent bet for a rainy day rental.  I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, but they all did a good enough job, and some even appeared to be played by actual teens.  Being a Disney movie, there is absolutely nothing objectionable in the way of language.  The heroine's parents are also presented sympathetically and not as one-dimensional stereotypes.

1381569,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0041KKYHY,Kevin Killian,"[5, 8]","PROM blends the glamor and stardust of Disney's HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL with something of Robert Altman's multi-story crosscutting to produce perhaps a new kind of teen picture, but it still has many of the same virtues that led us to watch all our favorites of the genre: GREASE, DIRTY DANCING, CENTER STAGE, FOOTLOOSE, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  And it's much more multicultural than any of the above.  Who would have thought that a tiny school like Brookside (Michigan) High had so many devastatingly cute students of color?  A star is born, maybe two, for Aimee Teagarden and Thomas McDonell are both incredibly appealing and show real chemistry together.  Aimee I recognize from five years of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and really she's playing the same part here, the overachiever and daddy's girl who finally puts her foot down and says, ""I have to be me.""  She does it well, even though she doesn't look like a teen any longer.Her parents aren't played by actors as talented as those on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but the replacement parents are just fine.  Dad is a tough guy with a heart of gold, and I think maybe the director was trying to get some of that working-class schmaltz that Kurt's father exhibits on GLEE.  He is so close to Kurt's father's character that I imagine the director shouting out, ""Hey, can we get Kurt's father for this part?""  ""No, but I know his twin brother and he's an actor too!""  He's the dad who wants the best for his offspring, be they gay or straight.  PROM doesn't have much in the plot regarding same-sex attraction, though there is an appealing bromance between two nerds spoiled when one of the nerds falls for his lovely lab partner Simone and starts neglecting Corey (Cameron Monaghan).  Monaghan caught the attention of show lovers everywhere when, a mere lad of 8 or 9, he ran away with the part of Kristin Chenoweth's younger brother and sang ""Gary, Indiana."")  Now he's all grown up and has a learners' permit in some very funny mother-dominated scenes.The movie constantly jumps from one story to another, with many characters involved in every different stage of romance.  Some are haplessly single, like John Cusack--sorry, I mean Nicholas Braun, who plays ""Lloyd"" in the movie, -- he looks exactly like John Cusack, and his name, ""Lloyd"" has got to be a tipoff to Cusack's most famous role, right?  Braun's not bad, just distracting.  Then the other end of the romance spectrum, those who have lived through years of being a couple and now they're ready to break up, the lovely Kylie Bunbury, a face new to me, and if she could sing look out Beyonce!  And her lacrosse-superstar boyfriend DeVaughan Nixon as the narcissistic horndog ""Tyler.""  There's also an airhead sort of guy who boasts of taking a Canadian girl to the prom--the story takes place in Michigan, which must be close to Canada, otherwise, how's he going to do it?  But the point in the movie is that no one thinks this girlfriend actually exists!  This story is played for laughs and you'd have to have a heart of stone not to chuckle a bit here or there.We hear a lot about Michigan's money woes on the news, but Brookside seems to be doing great: small class sizes, individual attention to students, a prom shed the likes of which I've never seen in a movie.  PROM leaves one loose end completely unwrapped involving this shed and a candle, but outside of that all stories get wrapped up just the way we want them to--except for the lonely half of the nerd couple maybe....  The music is cheerful and mindless, capped with the prom night itself during which Katy Perry's ""Firework"" is played fullblast, just the way it is, I imagine, at many proms right at this moment in pop history.  Add a star if you like long, drawn-put montage sequences at prom dress stores where the heroine tries on ugly and outlandish gowns and our hero sits, rolling his eyes---then she finds the right one, and she knows it's right by the smile on his face.  I collect these kind of montages, and cherish them, though poor Sergei Eisenstein's probably rolling in his grave.Prom committees do a heck of a lot of work!  That's one lesson I learned.  Another one is, in Michigan, lacrosse must be like what basketball and football, combined, is for the rest of the USA.  And, I didn't think I would ever see a movie in which the main character is called ""Nova,"" unless it was a Ridley Scott sci/fi spectacular, and yet here it is at last, ""Nova Prescott,"" just like ""Sidney Prescott"" of the SCREAM movies, and in fact, Aimee Teagarden was IN the most recent SCREAM movie, where she probably was attracted to the Prescott name and took it home with her, like a hostess gift, to use in this movie.
