359573,A1U4NF7H7FAEOJ,6303139132,Christopher D. Heer,"[19, 21]","This is not a movie about fencing. It is merely using the setting of a fencing academy to explore human nature, particularly obsession with excellence.Jeremy Kagan, an otherwise unremarkable director, weaves  these themes into an engaging story with some terrific cinematography. In  particular, many of the fencing scenes involving Roberts are downright  gorgeous. Is the fencing accurate? I have no idea; I've heard both opinions  offered, but it scarcely matters.F. Murray Abraham is as excellent as  always.  His path through the movie is mirrored not only by his physical  health but by the appearance of his apartment, his relationships with  others, etc., and Abraham is utterly convincing.Eric Roberts turns in a  very good performance, surprisingly.  He's got a natural tendency to really  play over the top, but for the most part he avoids that here.  He's uneven  in a couple of scenes, particularly the end, but that's only a minor  quibble.This movie will surprise you.

359575,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,6303139132,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[12, 13]","This little known gem is one of my favorites. I first encountered it years ago on late night cable. Back then, it captivated me because I love fencing. Since then, I have learned to appreciate the story as well.F. Murray Abraham plays a man just out of prison for murder. His was the foolish act of a headstrong youth. He has since come to regret it and wishes to change his life. He seeks employment as a fencing instructor in a prestigious salle but his style and skills are out of date. He can get work only as a janitor. Even so, he works to regain his lost skill and eventually gets the grudging acceptance of the maestro and is allowed to teach beginners classes. The students have a hard time taking him seriously but his skill is such that he wins acceptance from them as well. Eventually, his real identity comes out. He has a ""history"" with the maestro and tempers flare I a great clash of wills and style.This isn't just a story about guys playing with long pointy things. It is about striving to be the best but setting limits as to what one is willing to do to be the best. It is about winning at all costs versus winning with honor. It is about vengeance and respect.The fencing scenes are well done. Abraham does a convincing job of conveying the athleticism of fencing even though he is decades older than his opponents.Touche!",5,Superb!,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,1343,"['little', 'known', 'gem', 'one', 'favorites', 'first', 'encountered', 'years', 'ago', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'Back', 'then', 'captivated', 'love', 'fencing', 'then', 'have', 'learned', 'appreciate', 'story', 'well.F', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'man', 'just', 'prison', 'murder', 'was', 'foolish', 'act', 'headstrong', 'youth', 'come', 'regret', 'change', 'life', 'employment', 'fencing', 'instructor', 'prestigious', 'salle', 'style', 'skills', 'are', 'date', 'can', 'get', 'work', 'only', 'janitor', 'Even', 'so', 'regain', 'lost', 'skill', 'eventually', 'grudging', 'acceptance', 'maestro', 'allowed', 'teach', 'beginners', 'classes', 'students', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'taking', 'seriously', 'skill', 'such', 'acceptance', 'as', 'well', 'Eventually', 'real', 'identity', 'out', 'history', 'maestro', 'tempers', 'flare', 'great', 'clash', 'wills', 'style.This', ""n't"", 'just', 'story', 'guys', 'playing', 'long', 'pointy', 'things', 'striving', 'be', 'best', 'setting', 'limits', 'what', 'one', 'willing', 'do', 'be', 'best', 'winning', 'costs', 'winning', 'honor', 'vengeance', 'respect.The', 'fencing', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Abraham', 'convincing', 'job', 'conveying', 'athleticism', 'fencing', 'even', 'decades', 'older', 'opponents.Touche']",By the Sword VHS
359576,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6303139132,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Hard to believe that Eric Roberts has now been in the business for nearly 40 years. Today the perennial bad guy character actor, he never quite reached the level of stardom equal to that of his talent. Though one could reasonably argue that that was indeed the level he was capable of in the first place. I'm torn on the subject as his performances tend to swing from fantastic (Runaway Train) to functional (pretty much everything else).This very solid film falls into the former and, perhaps, represents his best career performance to date.Roberts portrays Alexander Villard, fencing master. Undefeated in his career, he holds the distinction of being a two-time Olympic Gold Medalist and two-time World Champion - doubling the achievement of his illustrious late father. A father who died under the most unusual of circumstances. Still, in spite of its historical notoriety, the Villard Academy remains one of the country's most prestigious and desirable schools. And students who are selected to attend are chosen by two simple criteria - raw talent or the ability to pay.Enter F. Murray Abraham as Maximillian 'Max' Suba, recent resident of the justice system. Now free after two decades, he's a man looking for a job. But not just any job. He wants to be a fencing instructor - specifically at the Villard Academy.Why?As the past comes crashing back into their lives, the two men are on a collision course at the points of their &Eacute;p&eacute;e. Those are rapiers, not foils - &eacute;p&eacute;e are killing swords. And the only resolution either will find is by way of blood.Once again, this same vehicle showcases two rich, superlative, and deeply complex performances by a pair of character actors whose talents, although recognized, hasn't produced the careers one would've expected given their abilities and strengths.Couple of minor weaknesses:- Didn't get into the extraneous student romance which played as a backdrop to the contest between Villard and Suba - thought it pointless and distracting. And though Mia Sara has always been very easy on the eyes, there just wasn't a valid reason for her character's inclusion or development.- Honestly could've done without the 'Fame'-style dancing sequence. Like most movies that employ this prop - but aren't specifically about dance or dancing - completely worthless. I recognize that the point was to reveal the fundamental differences between the two methodologies of instruction, how their emotional approach to the same end goal yielded completely different perspectives. I get it. But in this context, meaningless, because the production had built up enough energy to carry the film without resorting to such a cheap emotional crutch.Overall, the raw energy of the cast is barely contained in this well-paced and fascinating drama. And notably, showcases the missing key ingredient in most modern films today: Passion, or the lack thereof. This indie product is proof that a generous budget, well-heeled stars, splashy sfx, famous novels and pricey scripts do not equate to a good film. Too many movies are populated with walk-through performances and assembly-line scripts approved by rubber-stamp creatives.",4,Extraordinarily Strong Character Vehicle,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,3178,"['Hard', 'believe', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'now', 'been', 'business', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'perennial', 'bad', 'guy', 'character', 'actor', 'never', 'quite', 'reached', 'level', 'stardom', 'equal', 'talent', 'one', 'could', 'reasonably', 'argue', 'was', 'indeed', 'level', 'was', 'capable', 'first', 'place', ""'m"", 'torn', 'subject', 'performances', 'tend', 'swing', 'fantastic', 'Runaway', 'Train', 'functional', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', '.This', 'very', 'solid', 'film', 'former', 'perhaps', 'best', 'career', 'performance', 'date.Roberts', 'portrays', 'Alexander', 'Villard', 'fencing', 'master', 'Undefeated', 'career', 'distinction', 'being', 'two-time', 'Olympic', 'Gold', 'Medalist', 'two-time', 'World', 'Champion', 'doubling', 'achievement', 'illustrious', 'late', 'father', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'most', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'Still', 'spite', 'historical', 'notoriety', 'Villard', 'Academy', 'one', 'country', 'most', 'prestigious', 'desirable', 'schools', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'selected', 'attend', 'are', 'chosen', 'two', 'simple', 'criteria', 'raw', 'talent', 'ability', 'pay.Enter', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Maximillian', ""'Max"", 'Suba', 'recent', 'resident', 'justice', 'system', 'Now', 'free', 'two', 'decades', 'man', 'looking', 'job', 'not', 'just', 'job', 'be', 'fencing', 'instructor', 'specifically', 'Villard', 'Academy.Why', 'past', 'crashing', 'back', 'lives', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'collision', 'course', 'points', 'Eacute', 'p', 'eacute', 'are', 'rapiers', 'not', 'foils', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'are', 'killing', 'swords', 'only', 'resolution', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'blood.Once', 'again', 'same', 'vehicle', 'two', 'rich', 'superlative', 'deeply', 'complex', 'performances', 'pair', 'character', 'actors', 'talents', 'recognized', ""n't"", 'produced', 'careers', 'one', 'would', ""'ve"", 'expected', 'given', 'abilities', 'strengths.Couple', 'minor', 'weaknesses', 'Did', ""n't"", 'get', 'extraneous', 'student', 'romance', 'played', 'backdrop', 'contest', 'Villard', 'Suba', 'thought', 'pointless', 'distracting', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'valid', 'reason', 'character', 'inclusion', 'development.-', 'Honestly', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', ""'Fame'-style"", 'dancing', 'sequence', 'most', 'movies', 'employ', 'prop', 'are', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'dance', 'dancing', 'completely', 'recognize', 'point', 'was', 'reveal', 'fundamental', 'differences', 'two', 'methodologies', 'instruction', 'how', 'emotional', 'approach', 'same', 'end', 'goal', 'yielded', 'completely', 'different', 'perspectives', 'get', 'context', 'meaningless', 'production', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'enough', 'energy', 'carry', 'film', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'emotional', 'crutch.Overall', 'raw', 'energy', 'cast', 'barely', 'contained', 'well-paced', 'fascinating', 'drama', 'notably', 'missing', 'key', 'ingredient', 'most', 'modern', 'films', 'today', 'Passion', 'lack', 'thereof', 'indie', 'product', 'proof', 'generous', 'budget', 'well-heeled', 'stars', 'splashy', 'sfx', 'famous', 'novels', 'pricey', 'scripts', 'do', 'not', 'equate', 'good', 'film', 'Too', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'populated', 'walk-through', 'performances', 'assembly-line', 'scripts', 'approved', 'rubber-stamp', 'creatives']",By the Sword VHS

The movie presents us with a very interesting hero, an ex convict ( F. Murray Abraham) who is returning into the world, coming back to the fencing school where he studied. He comes back to meet the son of his long time protoge played by Eric Roberts. F. Murray Abraham plays a very convincing main role, as the dark, sullen swordsman Max Suba as is Eric Roberts in the part of the protege's son who is obcessed by excellence. This movie also offers an interesting look into the world of fencing and offers a explosive, can't be beat duel at the end between Eric Roberts and F. Murray Abraham, which makes the viewer wonder just how long it took them to fight as good as they do!
