I agree he should compensate his unwilling performers more sometimes, but without looking at the moral issues those movies are far more humorous, engaging and entertaining than this movie that seems to the formula comedy.  I don't like reality tv either as I find that mundane as well, but Cohen has a way of mixing reality with his story in funny and smart ways.  I don't mind that The Dictator should not have been scripted, just less formulaic.  It is definitely worth a watch but everybody also owes it to themselves to watch the original Dictator by Chaplin just to see how the films very.  Remakes like these are especially great because of they are such reflections of the times and these to films are hot button topics.  The other thing to watch for is the ending with the varying monologues and there solutions.  They are both honest and heartfelt but very different approaches.  Charlie Chaplin's version I suspect was very influential in the making of future Mel Brooks movies.  I could pass that film off as a Mel Brooks movie to the typical idiot that has never watched a movie before 1970 or 1980.

1470132,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B005LAIHGI,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 4]","While I normally give every movie I see a chance, regardless of how the trailer makes it look, something about the previews for The Dictator had me wanting to not see it at all. Sacha Baron Cohen's earlier work like Da Ali G Show and Borat were great, and Bruno was alright for what it was, but it seemed like with The Dictator, he wasn't making any progress with his comedy. More Middle Eastern jokes, more ""offensive"" jokes that are boring most of the time, why not try something different? The movie had this self-aware feeling like they were writing jokes with a ""hey, isn't this funny?!"" mentality instead of going for more genuine humor. I just plain didn't like this movie, and it hurts to say that since I know Cohen can do so much more given the right material and setup. When it comes down to it, if you've seen his other movies and Da Ali G Show, then you've seen most of what's here. If you haven't...I suggest watching those instead. The Dictator will most likely only appeal to people who still get shocked at politically incorrect humor.Aladeen is the dictator of the [fictional] country of Wadiya, ruling over it with an iron fist. Whatever he wants, he gets. Be it a nuclear bomb that's pointy instead of round, winning a race against professional runners, or changing a couple of words to his own name. He has a tendency to have people executed whenever they do something that bugs him even in the tiniest bit, and as such, no one likes him. Aladeen travels to America to talk with the United Nations, but he's kidnapped and shaved soon after his arrival. They replace the dictator with a lookalike, despite the man being mentally challenged, and plan on having him sign a document that would bring democracy to Wadiya, opening the country's oil fields up for business. Homeless and without any friends, Aladeen befriends (for lack of better word) Zoey, an activist who works at one of those all-natural shops that activists love to go to so much. It just so happens that her store is catering the hotel that Aladeen's replacement is staying at. This won't be pretty.I'll get the things I liked about the movie out of the way first. Jason Mantzoukas, who plays Nadal, former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons program, provided most of the laughs for me. Whenever he'd get irritated at Aladeen's obliviousness to logic and basic instructions, it was funny. Unfortunately there's a good amount of time that goes on without the guy after he's introduced, but when he comes back, it's good. The other main thing is a speech that Aladeen gives towards the end of the movie. I was just about to write it off as a waste of time until that moment. Aladeen talks about many things that are wrong with America, and you can't help but go ""...yeah, he's right"" during this segment. The speech isn't delivered with a very serious tone, yet everything he says is true. There's also the infamous helicopter scene from the trailer, and it still made me laugh when it came up....that does it for things I liked.Everything else about the movie is a flop. Jokes go on forever and don't know when to end, especially those with Bobby Lee, whose character is so forced into the movie that everything he does seems out of place. Some scenes are so drawn out that I was wondering if the movie was trying to be taken seriously all of a sudden because the attempts at comedy were suddenly gone. Aladeen just plain isn't an interesting character either, and comes off as Borat with authority more than anything else. It got old whenever he'd be talking about something sexual, and replace words for organs or actions with those in his language. The editing in The Dictator is pretty awful too, and it's clear that a lot of scenes were cut from the movie. You can see for yourself if you watch the trailer before or after watching the movie.  As for the politically incorrect-ness of the comedy here, none of it offended me in the way it might offend most people. No, what offended me was how hard they were trying to get a shock out of the viewer. Not since Carlos Mencia's show, Mind of Mencia, have I seen such a sad, forced attempt at surprising audiences with what was being said. Didn't any of the writers or anyone else have the guts to step forward and say something like 'hey guys, maybe we should stop with all this and write something more original'? I've seen the movie twice now, with the most recent viewing being 4 days ago, and I barely remember any of the jokes.

1470152,AYWSFRCIMOAYE,B005LAIHGI,Cestmoi,"[0, 2]","Warning! Spoilers ahead.There is some funny slap-stick humor. For example, when Aladeen (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) was told to take the garbage out. He took the garbage bin and...There is also some dark humor. For instance, the scene where Aladeen looked at the window of a store in New York, talking to himself ""Why is this happening to me? All I ever did were stealing my country's wealth and executing people who disagreed with me. Why does it always happen to the good guy?"" (I don't remember the exact words but these are very close to what he said.)However, it's very difficult to rate this movie because of its extremities. It vividly illustrates the word ""extreme"". Yes, many of the jokes are so over-the-top that they were either very funny or very disturbing.Case in point, at the 31st minute,in the grocery store named Free Earth Collective, he made politically incorrect comments and jokes that might deeply offend women and immigrants.Another example, at the 53rd minute, in the grocery store, he made fun of one of the taboo subjects that might cause extreme discomfort.The scene when he helped with delivering the baby was too much for me. At first, instead of helping the woman, he tried to have sex with her! To me, it looked like a rape attempt. It's very disturbing.

THE DICTATOR is a nice showpiece for this odd blend, as it buries it's thought-provoking ideas behind hard-R humor.The film follows General Aladeen (Cohen), the idiotic, over-the-top dictator of Wadiya.  On a trip to New York, Aladeen's second-in-command (Ben Kingsley) attempts to have the General assassinated.  Aladeen escapes and, beardless, takes up with do-gooder Zoey (Anna Farris), who has no idea who her new friend is.  As he falls in love, Aladeen also attempts to regain control of his country, before it is turned into a democracy.THE DICTATOR isn't Cohen's best effort; it starts off strong, but then meanders.  The jokes get a little old (until a hilarious diatribe in favor of dictatorships at the end; conservatives will be a little pissed at that one), and the story strays as Aladeen (kind of) develops a conscience.  Still, Larry Charles's direction is strong, and Cohen is still the master of below-the-belt satire.

I'm sure he was completely aware of how absurd every aspect of this movie was, but to watch him, you'd think he had no idea. In a film that is filled with comedic actors doing outrageous things, Kingsley is strutting around, dignified, serious, and stern of feature, delivering his lines as if he's taking part in a Shakespearean play. It's great to see such a respected actor having fun with the roles he selects, and willing to take on something different for him, impervious to the fear that many critics and fans might lambast him for the decision.John C. Reilly also has an incredible performance- I felt his lines were the funniest of the movie. Unfortunately, his role is quite brief, but it's great to see these two heavyweights (Reilly and Cohen) from ""Talledega Nights"" reunited and having such a good time together. (And keep your eyes peeled for a non-speaking cameo by Ed Norton late in the film.)If you don't like Cohen's humor, or any of his previous movies, you surely will not like this one. But for his fans, it's another delightful trip into the absurdity and hilarity that he's become well known for.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[31, 48]","3.5 out of 5 stars for THE DICTATOR.Upfront time: I'm not one to fall for Sacha Baron Cohen's subversive humor or his sense of the outlandish. I'm left cold and unimpressed by his Ali G and his Borat and Br&uuml;no. But then there's Admiral General Aladeen, a thoroughly despicable, funky-bearded tyrant who somehow wormed his way into, if not my heart, then at least my good graces. Understandably, enormous chunks of human civilization will absolutely loathe THE DICTATOR, and be offended and outraged by it. But, as a wannabe anarchist (there's this nihilistic chick I'm trying to impress), I'm inclined to sort of dig this movie.In the oppressed and oppressively warm North African nation of Wadiya, Admiral General Aladeen rules with absolute abandon, if not with sagacity. His will unchecked, Aladeen subjects his people to his petty whims and cruelties. He doesn't think twice about ordering someone killed, however trivial the reason. He sleeps with world-famous celebrities, if you consider Megan Fox a celebrity. You get a hint of the sad little boy lurking inside Aladeen when, post-coital, he pleads with Megan Fox to linger for a cuddling session (Megan Fox rejects him and demands her goodie bag). Redemption thru hugs? What the-- is Cohen getting mushy?THE DICTATOR, despite the brutal subject matter, may be more mainstream than Cohen's other motion pictures. It certainly follows a more conventional plot trajectory than did BORAT or BRUNO. Ben Kingsley - I would say he's slumming but he hasn't done anything good in a while - plays Tahir, the rightful heir to the throne, except that he was passed over for Aladeen. Tahir is fed up with his second banana role and plots to overthrow the Wadiyan ruler. When one assassination attempt is foiled by a body double, Tahir convinces Aladeen to address the United Nations in New York, wherein another assassination would be staged. Except that this second stab also fails, leaving Aladeen shaven of his signature beard and wandering the streets of the Big Apple, unrecognized. Meanwhile, Tahir installs a dimwit body double in place, a puppet whose strings he pulls from the shadows.On the streets of Manhattan, epiphany doesn't strike Aladeen as much as it sidles up to him only to be violently punched in the Adam's apple. It's a chore overcoming a lifetime of prejudice and hatred. But then Aladeen runs into left-wing activist Zoey (Anna Faris) who believes that the dethroned dictator - or, as Aladeen introduces himself to her, ""Allison Burgers"" - is a persecuted dissident. She offers him a clerking job at her vegan, feminist food store in Brooklyn, an offer which he accepts once he learns that her store is catering for the hotel in which the traitorous Tahir and the pretend Aladeen are staying. See, Allison Burgers still aims to regain what's his. Then again, Zoey hasn't hugged him yet.Fair warning: Neither sensitive souls nor them humorless fuddy-duddies need come to the show. Sacha Baron Cohen's transgressions surface frequently and undilutedly. Scenes play out, colored with rampant obscenities and disgusting imagery. Regarding the scatological stuff, even the writers of BRIDESMAID are cringing. And yet here's a saving grace: THE DICTATOR is funny as hell. Another saving grace: Cohen drops several acute observations. Don't forget that this is a satire; somewhere, Jonathan Swift is showing solidarity, never mind that he's long dead. I don't know that Aladeen as a character is able to salvage the audience's good regard. The tone is too viciously satirical, the narrative not really grounded enough, that I ever felt Aladeen was an honest-to-gosh, full-blooded person. He comes off more as a cartoon figure, and, so, emotionally, I was never engaged. Still, there's a redeeming moment which momentarily invests me, when, after a panic attack followed by a particularly vile act committed by his accomplice, Aladeen scolds him: ""Plan B was to have coffee and regroup - not to chop his head off!"" Now, I didn't get a lump in my throat. But I almost did choke on a jujube.If Marvel movies haven't taught you yet, don't exit once the end credits roll. You'll miss out on some stuff. That is, if you've managed to stick around that long. Odds are, halfway thru the film, you'd probably already stormed out of the theater, appalled and disgusted and loudly denouncing Sacha Baron Cohen.

However the jokes started to feel like they were going through the motions; don't get me wrong, I love politically incorrect humor, Borat and Bruno both had my sides sore in laughter, but a few of the jokes in this one fell flat for me because it seemed like it was being crude for the sake of being crude.For example, when Aladeen first learns how to masturbate it just wasn't really that funny to me, it didn't really push any envelopes and didn't add much to the story besides establishing that he's had the easy life before. Also when Anna Ferris and Aladeen hold hands inside a woman's vagina, it didn't really serve a purpose to the plot or the characters and just seemed like it was trying too hard. Also the crude racist FBI agent and the two Middle Easterners scaring Westerners on an air-craft felt very reminiscent of Harold & Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay. Ben Kingsley's character felt underdeveloped as the main villain, and his character was rather forgettable, it's a shame Sascha B. Cohen couldn't write more jokes for his character.So that's what I didn't like about it, but there is still a lot to like in the Dictator.

I understand that Cohen is trying to make a point and is making fun of dictators and discontent in the world but to this extreme? He is an equal opportunity insulter. Everyone is fair game. His character General Aladeen is dictator of the fictional Republic of Wadiya. A map of eastern Africa is shown and it looks like Wadiya borders Sudan right about where Eritea is. Aladeen (pronounced like Aladdin in Arabic) seems to be head of an Arabic country (his accent, the ""language"" he speaks has some Arabic words and so on) but he says at some point, ""I am not Arab.""  Cohen just seems to be out to offend everyone without at least making it seem its wrong.I like Cohen so I wanted to see the film. I knew to be prepared for awkward moments that were lacking in sensitivity. Lots of references to Osama Bin Laden.

Sacha Baron Cohen played Admiral General (ha-ha!) Aladeen, the ruthless Arab-ish dictator of the east African country of Wadiya. He loves grand titles, overly-decorated uniforms, giving himself awards, his golden limo and his retinue of red-bereted, gorgeous female bodyguards. So, the film is set up to be an over-the-top satire about excess of power in the Arab world. But it kind of goes nowhere.Imagine Borat with a love story attached. That's what you have here. A weird pairing of a violent, domineering, sexist, abusive and racist tyrant with his polar opposite - Zoey, a peace-loving, armpit-hairy feminist and natural foodie. The combination does not work. Aladeen insults Zoey and all women, and she just finds him charming. The film can't seem to decide whether to play Aladeen as a bad guy or a nice one. He sentences many people to die. He admits to having sex with small boys. He has sex with legions of prostitutes. He threatens the West with nukes. But he is redeemable because he is lonely (shades of Team America!) and falls in love with a working girl?The film is not a total loss. The scene in which Aladeen tries to deliver a baby (and leaves his cellphone inside Mom) was fun, if not actually funny. His argument with a CIA torturer (about who had the latest pain-inflicting devices) was almost topical. But so much was left undeveloped. His solid gold limo was a great visual, but was not put to use. As were his hotalicious body guards, who were good for only one sight gag, where an idiot shepherd tries to milk them.""The Dictator "" is a mess of unfunny crudity, gross out humor, a ridiculous plotline, pointless ethnic jabs and missed opportunities at satire - or just plain comedy. Some bits are so tone-deaf and badly written (prime example: the helicopter ride with 9/11 references) that even the cast could not possibly have thought them funny. His big speech at the end (using actual American political reality - e.g., ""You could let 1% of the people have all the nation's wealth"" -- as the way a true dictator should act) was preachy and out of place.SBC is a gifted artist.

Yes, unlikeBoratandBr&uuml;no, The Dictator is a narrative feature with a plot and it may be the funniest film they've done together. It has low-brow humor that is outrageous and crude, but there are several moments of ruthless political satire that ultimately make The Dictator much funnier than I expected it to be.There are pop culture references and topical humor that restrain it from being anything close to timeless, but I don't think I've laughed harder at a movie this year.The film courts controversy immediately by opening with the title card ""In Loving Memory of Kim Jong-Il."" From there, we meet Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen), the bearded, ignorant dictator of the (fictional) Republic of Wadiya. Aladeen's astounding stupidity, willingness to execute anyone who disagrees (or agrees) with him, and his development of nuclear arms that unnerve the US has his own men out to assassinate him; particularly Tamir (Ben Kingsley), the rightful heir to the throne that Aladeen has assumed. When Aladeen travels to New York to give a speech to the UN, his beard is shaved by a would-be assassin and he escapes into the streets as a double replaces him and promises to give Wadiya democracy. Aladeen ""befriends"" a feminist, vegan shop-owner (Anna Faris) and, against all odds, begins to fall for her as he desperately tries to keep his double from signing a constitution that will give his beloved country democracy.The film frequently utilizes shock humor and no topic is off-limits. Be forewarned; The Dictator doesn't know the meaning of politically correct. 9/11, child molestation, sex-selective abortion, various sex acts, stereotypes targeting race, women, and cultures are just a few examples of the comedic fodder here. The humor alternates between intelligent and down-right stupid, but maintains a streak of intelligence by always being aware of the audience it's targeting. Two early scenes represent this dichotomy; in one, Aladeen exclaims ""you now have herpes"" after a sexual rendezvous with Megan Fox. In another, Clayton (played by John C. Reilly) mistakes Aladeen for an Arab and informs him that ""anyone outside of America is technically an Arab."" Once you sift through the low-brow stuff there is some fine material that takes on dictatorships, America, terrorism, and cultural stereotypes. There's also an amusing and subtle gag about Osama bin laden and a brilliant throwaway gag that shows the confusion throughout Wadiya when Aladeen orders the words `positive' and `negative' to be changed to `Aladeen.' In a film where a man is beaten for several minutes by a large pair of breasts, it may seem odd to refer to said film as ""intelligent,"" but writing dumb in a smart and witty way is difficult and Cohen (and his co-writers) knows how to capture these differing facets of humor remarkably well.Making a film with a straight-forward narrative rather than the documentary-style of the previous outings seems be a more freeing experience comedically for Cohen and company. There is material here that Cohen would have never been able to execute on real, unsuspecting people without a potentially dangerous backlash. One example is the helicopter scene, which is one of the funniest and most hilariously politically incorrect scenes in the film. It's one of the film's best scenes and it would only work so well in this narrative framework. Some jokes fall flat, but the film's brisk 90-minute running time and rapid-fire humor make it easy to forget a mediocre joke as the next one has you rolling on the floor laughing.The Dictator is an uproarious experience that will have you clutching your stomach with laughter and also nodding in agreement when it catches you with surprise moments of brilliance. The speech at the end about dictatorship in America is astounding and insightful. Never sticking to one comedic level for long, the film ends with the line ""are you having a boy or an abortion?"" There is something here to please, or offend, anyone. With a slew of celebrity cameos including Edward Norton, Chris Elliot (yep, he's still alive), and Garry Shandling; The Dictator is over-the-top and consistently funny, despite the topical humor that will grow stale in years to come. It's not a timeless classic, but I was shocked by how good it turned out to be. I don't know if I've seen a funnier film this year and I doubt that I will.GRADE: B+",4,"A Smart, Offensive, Politically Incorrect; Far from Timeless, But Hilarious",1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,4580,"['Dictator', 'third', 'collaboration', 'director', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'writer/producer/star', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'first', 'break', 'mockumentary', 'mold', 'previous', 'films', 'together', 'Yes', 'unlikeBoratandBr', 'uuml', 'Dictator', 'narrative', 'feature', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'funniest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'done', 'together', 'low-brow', 'humor', 'outrageous', 'crude', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'ruthless', 'political', 'satire', 'ultimately', 'make', 'Dictator', 'much', 'funnier', 'expected', 'be.There', 'are', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'topical', 'humor', 'restrain', 'being', 'anything', 'close', 'timeless', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'laughed', 'harder', 'movie', 'year.The', 'film', 'courts', 'controversy', 'immediately', 'opening', 'title', 'card', 'Loving', 'Memory', 'Kim', 'Jong-Il', 'there', 'meet', 'Admiral', 'General', 'Aladeen', 'Cohen', 'bearded', 'ignorant', 'dictator', 'fictional', 'Republic', 'Wadiya', 'Aladeen', 'astounding', 'stupidity', 'willingness', 'execute', 'anyone', 'who', 'development', 'nuclear', 'arms', 'unnerve', 'US', 'own', 'men', 'assassinate', 'particularly', 'Tamir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'rightful', 'heir', 'throne', 'Aladeen', 'assumed', 'When', 'Aladeen', 'New', 'York', 'give', 'speech', 'UN', 'beard', 'shaved', 'would-be', 'assassin', 'streets', 'double', 'replaces', 'promises', 'give', 'Wadiya', 'democracy', 'Aladeen', 'befriends', 'feminist', 'vegan', 'shop-owner', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'odds', 'fall', 'desperately', 'keep', 'double', 'signing', 'constitution', 'will', 'give', 'beloved', 'country', 'democracy.The', 'film', 'frequently', 'shock', 'humor', 'topic', 'off-limits', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'Dictator', ""n't"", 'know', 'meaning', 'politically', 'correct', '9/11', 'child', 'molestation', 'sex-selective', 'abortion', 'various', 'sex', 'acts', 'stereotypes', 'targeting', 'race', 'women', 'cultures', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'comedic', 'fodder', 'here', 'humor', 'intelligent', 'down-right', 'stupid', 'streak', 'intelligence', 'always', 'being', 'aware', 'audience', 'targeting', 'Two', 'early', 'scenes', 'represent', 'dichotomy', 'one', 'Aladeen', 'now', 'have', 'herpes', 'sexual', 'rendezvous', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'Clayton', 'played', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Aladeen', 'Arab', 'anyone', 'America', 'technically', 'Arab', 'sift', 'low-brow', 'stuff', 'fine', 'material', 'dictatorships', 'America', 'terrorism', 'cultural', 'stereotypes', 'also', 'amusing', 'subtle', 'gag', 'Osama', 'bin', 'laden', 'brilliant', 'throwaway', 'gag', 'confusion', 'Wadiya', 'when', 'Aladeen', 'orders', 'words', 'positive', 'negative', 'be', 'changed', 'Aladeen', 'film', 'where', 'man', 'beaten', 'several', 'minutes', 'large', 'pair', 'breasts', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'refer', 'said', 'film', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'dumb', 'smart', 'witty', 'way', 'difficult', 'Cohen', 'co-writers', 'how', 'capture', 'differing', 'facets', 'humor', 'remarkably', 'well.Making', 'film', 'straight-forward', 'narrative', 'rather', 'documentary-style', 'previous', 'outings', 'be', 'more', 'freeing', 'experience', 'comedically', 'Cohen', 'company', 'material', 'here', 'Cohen', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'execute', 'real', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'backlash', 'One', 'example', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'hilariously', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'scenes', 'film', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'scenes', 'would', 'only', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'narrative', 'framework', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'film', 'brisk', '90-minute', 'running', 'time', 'rapid-fire', 'humor', 'make', 'easy', 'forget', 'mediocre', 'joke', 'next', 'one', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing.The', 'Dictator', 'uproarious', 'experience', 'will', 'have', 'clutching', 'stomach', 'laughter', 'also', 'nodding', 'agreement', 'when', 'surprise', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'speech', 'end', 'dictatorship', 'America', 'astounding', 'insightful', 'Never', 'sticking', 'one', 'comedic', 'level', 'long', 'film', 'line', 'are', 'having', 'boy', 'abortion', 'something', 'here', 'please', 'offend', 'anyone', 'slew', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'including', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Chris', 'Elliot', 'yep', 'still', 'alive', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Dictator', 'over-the-top', 'consistently', 'funny', 'topical', 'humor', 'will', 'grow', 'stale', 'years', 'come', 'not', 'timeless', 'classic', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'good', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'funnier', 'film', 'year', 'doubt', 'will.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

1470266,AOZFQAPPLMVOB,B005LAIHGI,"Lone Alaskan Gypsy ""Lone Alaskan Gypsy""","[2, 2]","I'm going to start off this review by just being honest: I loved this movie. I laughed my entire way through it. It's offensive. It's absurd. It's hysterical. It's definitely not for everyone, but I appreciate all of Sacha Cohen's work. If you're not familiar with what he does, then perhaps this movie isn't for you. But if you can appreciate an off-beat, politically inspired, offensively hilarious film- then this is the right choice.The Dictator takes you on the journey of a dictator of a northern African nation called Wadiya, who after years of surpressing his people and bragging of uranium rich weapons- is challenged by the United Nations to attend a sanction in New York City and announce his approval of democracy rather than dictatorship. Once in America his chief advisor, greedy for Wadiya's oil wealth, has the dictator ""Aladeen"" killed. Alas, Aladeen is not killed, but has had his beard shaved- which causes him to be unrecognizable. His chief advisor replaces him with a stunt double Aladeen, who is to make Wadiya a democracy and allow free oil trade in the country. But, the real dictator does not want his country to become a democracy and hitches a plan to show everyone his true identity, and prevent Wadiya from becoming anything but a dictatorship.Along the way Aladeen meets Anna Ferris's character- a feminist, non-racist, non-prejudice, fem lit major who runs an organic, anti-sexist, anti-big business, fair trade grocery store. Did you get all that? Me neither. She's the epitome of the modern day 20-something democratic extremist. She's all about equality. And ya gotta love her for that. Of course, Aladeen cannot even begin to comprehend all of this equality nonsense. Which makes their relationship hilariously entertaining to watch develop.The film is quite offensive at times. It openly discusses topics such as abortion, sexism, female oppression, oil wealth and the greed associated with it, and of course dictatorship- with a few references to Islamic politics. What I find really hysterical is the fact that although the dictator is an absolute terrible person, he is- in many ways, comparable to the horrible people all over the world. There's one scene I especially love that pokes fun at the racial stereotypes developed by 9/11. Aladeen and his assistant are in a helicopter tour, talking about a subject in their native tongue. But the only words the white tourists can understand are '9/11, 2012, Empire State Building, Boom boom boom, and 5, 4, 3, 2, 1."" All of these words are skewed against an entirely innocent conversation- but of course, the white Americans are utterly paranoid of the non-English speaking northern African tourists that they absolutely freak out about this discussion. This, I thought was brilliant- as it so hysterically portrays the typical racist mindset of so many Americans after 9/11. It's sad, but true. And I found it hilarious. This is just one of the many examples of Sacha Cohen's brilliantly subtle ploys at picking fun at modern American faults.All in all I thought the movie was ridiculously well done. It was hilarious, with just the most PERFECT ending. Spoiler Alert: In the end Aladeen very cleverly (and not purposely) describes Dictatorship in a way that so closely compares to our modern democracy.

They are direct, ironically sarcastic and extremely crass. If you are easily offended by racist comments, political commentary or very color visuals....this film is NOT for you.Larry Charles (Borat, Bruno) directed this film, like he did Sacha's others films with the style of farce, slapstick and extreme visualizations and graphic body parts....yes body parts. (If you have seen Borat, you know what I am talking about.)Screenwriters Sacha Baron Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer came up with a story that basically puts an abusive dictator in a fish-out-of-water story by having him come to New York to sign a pact (unannounced to him) that will allow his county to sell oil.....he wants to keep it, but his right hand man does not.His right hand man is played by Sir Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Schindler's List) as secretly back-stabbing second-in-charge who tried to have the Dictator killed several times. - Unsuccessfully, of course. The story is simple and predictable. The action slapstick and visual and you have to look close...there are planted gags, signage and more - especially when you get into the Dictators palace. He is obsessed with bling and himself. It's funny and very visually sharp.The Dictator is eventually kidnapped and `shaved' and becomes like everyone else as his double is put in place in order to over throw his government. One event after another makes his adventure fail almost at every step.I actually enjoy his films and although he is politically incorrect most of the time....I know he's a comedian trying to make me laugh. A lot of people don't like this form of crass comedy - but I wasn't disappointed. In fact, there were several times I was laughing hard out loud and other times I was saying....""oh no!..."", out loud as well. This is like the adult version of Monty Python!There are other performances by some pretty good actors like Anna Ferris (Scary Movie, Cloudy with A Chance Of Meatballs) as his `boss' in a new eco-friendly store that he has to take a job in and survive. She is the one who actually gets him to understand what the `right' thing to do is. Even Megan Fox and Edwaqrd Norton make cameo appearances with film clip archive footage of Hillary Clinton and Obama!Also John C. Reilly (Chicago, Step Brothers) makes an un-credited appearance as the agent who kidnaps the Dictator and gives him his new look!.  Again, if you have a weak threshold for crass (visual) humor and no stomach for political incorrectness...this film is NOT for you. I thought Bruno and Borat were better films overall of this type, but this one did make me laugh out loud!",3,Wow - Sacha...has Really Gone WAY Out There!

Aladeen is a brutal dictator that has oppressed his people and never makes any apologies for it, as no one would dare to oppose him.  Unbeknownst to Aladeen, his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) is plotting against him, as he has his own ambitions that will never be realized so long as Aladeen is in power.Finding an unlikely cohort in the security that was hired to protect Aladeen (or so Aladeen thought) Clayton (John C. Reilly), Tamir puts in motion a plan to remove Aladeen from power.  The plan goes horribly wrong, though the desired outcome is achieved and a bewildered Aladeen finds himself in the streets of New York City.While Aladeen is trying to regain his status, he meets Zoe (Anna Faris).  Zoe manages an eco friendly grocery store.  Aladeen begins to work at the store, never losing his will to regain power.  Along the way, he runs into a former Scientist in Wadyia ""Nuclear Nadal"" (Jason Mantzoukas).Nadal begrudgingly agrees to help Aladeen regain his power, though at first neither of the two have any idea whatsoever how to go about accomplishing this task!Aladeen continues his daily routines otherwise, getting to know his boss and also new friend Zoe on a more personal level.The movie cascades through various situations through just outright silliness and LOTS of crude language.  However, while at first glance some of the language and situations may seem offensive there is a method to this madness!  Through various misadventures, misunderstandings, as well as dumb luck - Aladeen finds himself with a chance to regain his former status and life.  Aladeen's Uncle Zamir however has other plans.  Ending as absurdly as the story began, you will enjoy the conclusion and the movie will end with you wanting to see it again.",5,ALL HAIL ALADEEN!

1470275,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B005LAIHGI,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[70, 93]","Sacha Baron Cohen does a great acting job in his latest film, ""The Dictator."" The gags are mostly good and although some are tacky and racist (with a few being crude) it still held my attention on a very rough day for me because it works as a parody of dictatorships. There is little about the plot and the film that I can add to the reviews already posted here; but I can certainly vouch for other reviewers who write that the film is actually pretty good entertainment, a parody and nothing truly offensive even if Sacha Baron Cohen is very daring when it comes to topics for jokes and gags.The plot is not terribly deep; but it moves along well and you shouldn't get bored. Sacha Baron Cohen (who plays the brutal dictator of the fictional, northern African country named Wadiya) surrounds himself with excellent actors all turning in convincing performances that make the film even funnier. Sir Ben Kingsley plays Tamir, the rightful heir to the dictatorship occupied by his apparently younger brother General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen). Anna Faris is brilliant as Zoey, a Brooklyn, New York vegan small business food store owner who's liberal activism clashes sharply with Aladeen's ""take no prisoners"" and kill-`em-all policy whenever anyone disagrees with him. Nadal, a scientist ordered to create nuclear weapons for Wadiya, is well played by Jason Mantzoukas; his timing is just right and he supports Baron Cohen really well.Soon after the film starts with some gags and basic introductions, General Aladeen is practically summoned to the United Nations. They want his assurance that he isn't developing nuclear weapons--otherwise they may use military force against Wadiya. Aladeen travels to New York with Tamir and an extensive entourage--but soon after that he is kidnapped and nearly killed in a very funny scene with one of my favorite actors, John C. Reilly, playing the would-be murderer. Tamir hopes that with the real Aladeen out of the way he can use a phony ""double"" for Aladeen and use the double to make Wadiya a democracy so Tamir can sell its oil to countries around the world, most notably America and China.But what Tamir doesn't know is that Aladeen escaped being killed and wants nothing more than to gain back total control of Wadiya. Just how Aladeen and Zoey get to know each other and how Aladeen tries to win back control of his country is how the rest of the film plays out, complete with gags and jokes about anything Baron Cohen wants to tackle, including 9/11, blacks, Jews, Asians and just about anything else you can imagine.All in all, if you liked Sacha Baron Cohen's other films, I think you will like this one. It is better than ""Bruno"" and while it isn't quite as good as ""Borat"" it's definitely funny. It managed to divert my attention on a rather stressful day and that's actually saying a lot. In addition, if you're new to Sacha Baron Cohen's sense of humor and you're not that easily offended, you should enjoy this film.",5,"""Are you having a boy or an abortion?""",1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2972,"['Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'latest', 'film', 'Dictator', 'gags', 'are', 'mostly', 'good', 'are', 'tacky', 'racist', 'few', 'being', 'crude', 'still', 'held', 'attention', 'very', 'rough', 'day', 'parody', 'dictatorships', 'little', 'plot', 'film', 'can', 'add', 'reviews', 'already', 'posted', 'here', 'can', 'certainly', 'vouch', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'write', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'entertainment', 'parody', 'nothing', 'truly', 'offensive', 'even', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'very', 'daring', 'when', 'topics', 'jokes', 'gags.The', 'plot', 'not', 'terribly', 'deep', 'along', 'well', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'who', 'brutal', 'dictator', 'fictional', 'northern', 'African', 'country', 'named', 'Wadiya', 'excellent', 'actors', 'turning', 'convincing', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'even', 'funnier', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Tamir', 'rightful', 'heir', 'dictatorship', 'occupied', 'apparently', 'younger', 'brother', 'General', 'Aladeen', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'brilliant', 'Zoey', 'Brooklyn', 'New', 'York', 'vegan', 'small', 'business', 'food', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'liberal', 'activism', 'clashes', 'sharply', 'Aladeen', 'take', 'prisoners', 'kill-', 'em-all', 'policy', 'whenever', 'anyone', 'Nadal', 'scientist', 'ordered', 'create', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'Wadiya', 'well', 'played', 'Jason', 'Mantzoukas', 'timing', 'just', 'right', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'really', 'well.Soon', 'film', 'gags', 'basic', 'introductions', 'General', 'Aladeen', 'practically', 'summoned', 'United', 'Nations', 'want', 'assurance', ""n't"", 'developing', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'otherwise', 'may', 'use', 'military', 'force', 'Wadiya', 'Aladeen', 'New', 'York', 'Tamir', 'extensive', 'entourage', 'soon', 'kidnapped', 'nearly', 'killed', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'playing', 'would-be', 'murderer', 'Tamir', 'real', 'Aladeen', 'way', 'can', 'use', 'phony', 'double', 'Aladeen', 'use', 'double', 'make', 'Wadiya', 'democracy', 'so', 'Tamir', 'can', 'sell', 'oil', 'countries', 'world', 'most', 'notably', 'America', 'China.But', 'what', 'Tamir', ""n't"", 'know', 'Aladeen', 'escaped', 'being', 'killed', 'nothing', 'more', 'gain', 'back', 'total', 'control', 'Wadiya', 'Just', 'how', 'Aladeen', 'Zoey', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'how', 'Aladeen', 'tries', 'win', 'back', 'control', 'country', 'how', 'rest', 'film', 'out', 'complete', 'gags', 'jokes', 'anything', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'tackle', 'including', '9/11', 'blacks', 'Jews', 'Asians', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'imagine.All', 'liked', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'other', 'films', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'better', 'Bruno', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Borat', 'definitely', 'funny', 'managed', 'divert', 'attention', 'rather', 'stressful', 'day', 'actually', 'saying', 'lot', 'addition', ""'re"", 'new', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'sense', 'humor', ""'re"", 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

Midway through the movie, I caught myself, thinking, ""this isn't as good as I expected it to be."" But overall, it did entertain me. There are a lot of stereotypes in this film that were funny but it just illustrates how Hollywood keeps holding onto these stereotypes and gross depictions because they can't come up with any contemporary funny material. If you took out the stereotypes that Hollyood's been playing up for many years, people would be rioting at how bad this film was because essentially nothing would be in it. But it did entertain me.I did like the humorous irony pointed out by General Aladeen where he discusses America and its ways/similar characteristics to dictatorships and tyrannical forms of government from concentrating the nations wealth to 1% of its population to bailing out the wealthy when they gamble and lose to ignoring and disregarding the poor's health and education to creating the appearance of a free media controlled by a few individuals to wiretapping phones and torturing prisoners to having rigged elections to lying about waging (immoral and evil) wars to overwhelmingly filling prisons with a people of a certain racial background and no one would object or complain to this to using the media to intimidate and scare people into supporting government policies that are inimical and adverse to their interests.

""The Dictator"" is more Borat than Bruno.  Cohen plays the part of a ruthless dictator of a North African country that is trying to develop all kinds of weapons of mass destruction but is particularly fond of a nuclear bomb.  He argues with his chief weapons scientist because he insists the bomb have a ""pointy"" end.  The scientist, Nadal is played by Jason Mantzoukas (TV's ""The League"").  He manages to steal almost every scene he's in.Aladeen, the Dictator must travel to New York to address the U.N. so that military action is not taken against his country by the rest of the world.  Once there he is replaced by a lookalike (also Cohen) under the control of his assistant and political rival (a smirking Ben Kingsley).  Like most great comedians who use insults and extremism to be funny, Cohen (who also co-wrote) goes after everybody and everything including the democratic form of government.  In one scene he defends his political change from a dictatorship to democracy using the U. S. as his beacon by defining current political differences as examples.  The ""one-percenters"" won't likely be laughing.The film is loaded with numerous cameos including Megan Fox as herself having a one-night stand with Aladeen.  Cohen's material will offend many so take this as fair warning.  For me, I found this more hilarious than cringe-worthy.  I liked it in spite of the fact than many of the punch lines are given away in the numerous TV and movie trailers.The Blu ray is shown in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is digitally shot but has a look of film and is very good.  Colors of varying hues are part of the film's fun and they are excellently projected here.  The primary audio track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While it might not be demo worthy, it is still very good.  There isn't much going on in the surrounds but this is the nature of the film.

Aladeen is left to fend for himself with no power over those around him and this is the source of many enjoyable scenes and dialogue.Admirers of Baron Cohen's work will feel right at home with plenty of crude and politically incorrect humour.There are some viewers though who will find the movie too vulgar but I encourage those who are undecided to watch the film previews before deciding whether to see it.Whilst the movie is amusing it may not knock some loyal Baron Cohen viewers off their seats with laughter but it will give them plenty to smile about.Baron Cohen has invented a new character which further confirms his excellent comedic range.Nicholas R.W.

But there are parts of this film that are so funny, they had me thinking ""funniest thing since Monty Python.""  Those parts, however are few and far between.The opening is stale, nothing new and not that funny. But about 2 minutes into the film, I'm grinning. A few minutes later, I'm laughing. This is the part where we learn that Admiral General Haffiz Aladeen of the country of Wadiya edited the country's language, changing 300 words to 'aladeen.'  Including the words 'positive' and negative.' So picture some poor sap trying to learn the results of his HIV test.  A brief period of lameness follows, which brings us to the six minute mark, where Wadiya's nuclear bomb is revealed. It is beyond funny. So in the first eight minutes, you are alternatively shaking your head at the lameness and laughing your head off. After this, however, there is only an occasional laugh. Even my co-viewer, who claims to be a SBC fan, admitted that the real laughs were a little thin on the the ground.There is a plot, but it's not important to the enjoyment of the film. Did you see ""Coming to America?"" Combine that with ""The Price and the Pauper"" and any Three Stooges short and you pretty much get the picture.Some reviewers believe that anyone who doesn't find the movie funny doesn't get ""sarcasm."" I think we do, although some of us call it satire, which implies funny.  And in The Dictator it is. Three or four times. But mostly, it isn't.  The unfunniness is so egregious, it hurts.  SBC tries too hard to squeeze in too many laughs. I mean, come on, how funny is referring to ""The Real Housewives of Schwarmaharadarajan?""  Or peeing into a pitcher and then drinking it? It's pointless...even in a satire, characters have to behave reasonably. I think Cohen approached the movie the way bad soup makers make soup: if they find it in the refrigerator, it goes in the pot. If it popped into Cohen's head, he added it to the script.

1470337,A3G5B9IXVO48,B005LAIHGI,Rudiger,"[2, 6]","Sacha Baron Cohen's full-scale transition to ""normal"" comedy mostly works in ""The Dictator."" Ostensibly a satire of the cartoonish extremes autocratic rulers can reach when nobody is criticizing them, in addition to American sensibilities and blind spots when it comes to their own leadership, it's plenty funny when it has no particular agenda. The shot of the wall of General Aladeen's seemingly endless pictures with blank-faced celebrities is wonderful, as is hearing a cover of R.E.M's ""Everybody Hurts"" in Arabic during an emotional moment.As Aladeen, Baron Cohen is basically a more malicious Borat given immense power. Ignorant, casually homicidal, and deeply antisemitic, he is easily removed from leadership by his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley, admirably straight-faced the whole time). Presumed dead after losing his beard to John C. Reilly, he must reclaim the throne from his double (also Baron Cohen, with an ever-closer resemblance to an imperial Borat) and the his beard from ... well, you'll see. Aiding him in this endeavor is Anna Faris as a walking, talking compilation of every dorm-room idealist stereotype ever, and Jason Mantzoukas, a weapons expert who had previously been fired for not making a sufficiently pointy missile.The film is consistently funny, with Mantzoukas and Faris turning in strong performances, but the targets are a bit slapdash. There are a couple of good vignettes on that already well-explored region of Baron Cohen's comedy - redneckism (redneckery?) - but nothing too distinct. Likewise, the film could have had more fun with the sort of privileged do-gooderism engendered by Faris's character. And the climactic speech, with its blunt reminders of how America's political system resembles a dictatorship in more than a few non-trivial ways, is done with almost no comic flair, whatever you may think of its message. Personally, I found the random non-political bits to be the funniest, like when Aladeen reveals his plan to test the claim of Cocowater to have more potassium than three bananas, or expressing his fondness for Yiddish due to its way of pronouncing words the way they sound.In any case, if you haven't already been tickled by Baron Cohen's work, there's no talking to you.

But when I saw Cohen in 'Les Misreables' I loved both him and Helena Bonham Carter so much, I had to try this film.  And was hugely surprised that it had an actual, linear storyline, instead of seeming like a bunch of spontaneous or ad-libbed ""interviews"" featuring yet another of Cohen's bizarre characters!Here Cohen plays Hafez Aladeen, hateful, oppressive, uncaring (and kind of stupid) leader of the republic of Wadiya, over which he rules with an iron hand - and lots of punishment for anyone who even annoys him.  Called to New York City to speak in front of the UN about his shady dealings with Wadiya's nuclear weapons program, Aladeen ends up in trouble when his second-in-command Tamir (the awesome Ben Kingsley) betrays him, replacing Aladeen with a double while also inadvertently getting Aladeen himself tossed onto the mean streets of NYC - where the evil dictator immediately meets/clashes with Zoey (Anna Faris), a left-wing feminist revolutionary determined to make her ""cause"" known during Aladeen's visit to the States.The film even gets a bit rom-com, between Aladeen and Zoey, but Cohen lovers needs not fear - there are PLENTY of off-color jokes and sight-gags on hand, some maybe determined to test the gag reflex.  The jokes are hit and miss, but Cohen certainly throws everything into the pot, and overall while not great this is an enjoyable enough off-color comedy that keeps Cohen's blue humor a bit in check, even as he works in his usual ad-libbed bizarreness when he can.  Not great but worth a look, and definitely (I feel) a step up from Cohen's usual fare.(Just an FYI, I did NOT see the ""Banned and Unrated"" version, just the regular R-rated version released in theaters; I hear there are significant changes between the two, so will be catching the unrated/banned version when I can.

1470363,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B005LAIHGI,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 2]","""The Dictator,"" Sacha Baron Cohen's most recent satire, portrays Admiral General Omar Aladeen, despotic ruler of the fictional North African country of Wadiya. ""The Dictator"" is scripted and doesn't contain the unanticipated ""ambush"" reactions of real, unsuspecting civilians that were a major part of his earlier pictures, ""Borat"" and ""Bruno."" There is a sense of improvisation here and there, but the plot is fairly predictable.Aladeen comes to New York to address the United Nations, where his scheming uncle (Ben Kingsley) has him replaced by an easily controlled double and kidnapped to be tortured and killed. He manages to escape and eventually meets the proprietor of an organic foods store, Zoey (Anna Faris), who believes Aladeen is a dissident seeking political refuge.In ambush, hidden-camera pictures, editing builds the scene for maximum humor.  When a film is confined to the rigors of the written page, the script has to stand on its own. Too often in ""The Dictator,"" the jokes make you squirm, such as a toss-away gags about Aladeen's cousins ""taking down"" the Empire State Building.Baron Cohen, a master at instant characterizations, succeeds in making Aladeen a caricature but never bothers to make him a real person.  With his beard and zillion medals on a paramilitary uniform, Aladeen most closely parodies Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. That's not enough for a feature film, however, and the running time far exceeds the character's ability to elicit laughs.Some good visual gags notwithstanding, ""The Dictator"" is not Sacha Baron Cohen's finest. He is far less successful in getting laughs here than when he points his hidden camera at real people and draws out their bigotry, prejudices, and dark thoughts.The ""Banned and Unrated"" two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains a digital copy, several deleted and extended scenes, a Larry King interview with Baron Cohen in character as Aladeen, and a music video.

He is the dictator of an oil rich country and all he has to do is make a signal and people die. He is a multiple gold medal winning athlete and can pretty much but whatever or whoever he wants.

While in New York to talk to the UN his second in command tries to have him killed and institute democracy in his country. Alladeen tries everything to make sure that doesn't happen. I have to say that I think Cohen is the Andy Kaufman of this generation. His comedy is the type where it makes you a little uncomfortable and you laugh but also wish he would stop and that you never saw it. If you have seen ""Borat"" you know what I mean. For me he is usually a little too much and crosses the line from funny to obscene. I didn't think that ""Bruno"" was that funny and in that one he seemed to just try and make people mad more then laugh. All that said this is far and away his best movie. There are the scenes in this where you laugh as you look away and thing you laugh at that you know you shouldn't but for the most part this is pretty mainstream (for him).

1470373,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIHGI,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[5, 10]","After establishing himself as a satirical force with Da Ali G Show, Sacha Baron Cohen took his style of free-form, guerrilla comedy to the big screen with the brilliant Borat, a film that turned him into something of a cultural icon. The film was sharp, topical, and unpredictable in a way many spoofs simply can't replicate. Keeping up that level of success proved to be harder than many thought, as Cohen followed it up with the terribly unfunny supermodel film, Bruno, that seemed to stumble in every way that Borat got right. The Dictator, while marketed as being a sort of spiritual and creative cousin to Borat, is a total departure for Cohen, as it relies heavily on traditional Hollywood storytelling and jettisons the unscripted stuff we've become so accustomed to. The change hasn't effected Cohen in the least, as The Dictator is just as incendiary and depraved as we all hoped it would be.That's not to say the film has the insight of Borat, but it does show Cohen's deft ability to bring pointed, serious issues to light while hiding them under a thin veil of gross out gags, penis humor, and stunning political incorrectness. The firebrand of a closing monologue is a thing of genius, even if the message he's sending is an obvious and disturbing one. But that's getting ahead just a little bit, because there are an incredible amount of laughs to be had before reaching that point. Cohen plays General Aladeen, a hilarious Saddam Hussein knock-off who runs the north African nation of Wadiya with an iron fist. Born into power and demanding of his people's support, he's both vengeful and extremely petty, powered by years of privilege. He has the money to do basically anything he wants, like nail some of the hottest women in Hollywood. You either worship him as the leader or....well, the other option is pretty nasty. When the UN comes calling with claims of Wadiya fostering a nuclear program, Aladeen jets to New York with his security detail to try and head off any possible sanctions. When he arrives, he's naturally floored that our country is as free as it appears, while also noting some of the obvious hypocrisies. Not long after arriving, he's betrayed by his elder brother(Sir Ben Kingsley), who has him kidnapped and replaced by a moronic body double who will sign a UN agreement making Wadiya a true democracy. Why? So that Big Oil execs, all named after their corporate masters, can swoop in and buy up the oil fields for a hefty sum.Presumed dead and shaved of his beard, the symbol of his rightful power, Aladeen is forced to try and acclimate to American culture while finding a way to stop the signing. The dictatorship must be protected at all costs! He becomes reluctant friends with a political activist named Zoey(Anna Faris), a vegan and a woman (*gasp*) who takes him in and gives him a job, even as he insults and demeans her right to her face. In fact, jokes about the perceived inferiority and unworthiness of females are probably the most prevalent of all in this film, although no group is spared Cohen's wrath. For once, we're treated to a spirited comedy that hasn't had all of the best gags ruined by trailers, which is a remarkable feat considering all that we've seen of the movie. Smartly, Cohen has chosen to use his gift for creating spontaneous controversy as a means of hyping the film, such as turning up at the Academy Awards as Aladeen, then promptly spilling ashes all over Ryan Seacrest.Cohen is a master at eliciting uncomfortable laughter from situations we know are just plain wrong! When Aladeen and his reluctant compatriot, a scientist named Nadal(the perfectly cast Jason Mantzoukas), turn up at a funeral for an African-American man with hopes of stealing his epic beard, it's impossible not to hide your face at the racial firestorm that's about to be unleashed. No subject is taboo, and even the 9/11 tragedy is used to clever, comical effect. It's at times like this when Cohen is at his most dangerous, and it seems to sharpen his edge in a way. There's no doubt that many people are going to be turned off by this scene in particular, and it's hard to blame them. It's equally difficult not to respect Cohen's brazenness to go where nobody else would dare to. There are times when the film seems to stretch pretty hard to keep up the steady stream of gags, and it's at times like this when you wish Cohen would depart from the script and just go out and insult some ignorant bystander. Like most of Cohen's creations, Aladeen isn't a character you necessarily root for. He's more like somebody you love to hate. That said, he's as memorable and quotable as Borat was, and certainly less irritating than Bruno.It helps that Cohen gets a ton of support from a fantastic supporting cast, another reason why this film succeeds where some of his improvised efforts haven't.  Mantzoukas is brilliant as Aladeen's accomplice, Nadal, a scientist who the dictator thought he had executed. Nadal is just the right prism from which to view Aladeen's character, a guy who has loyalty to the system Aladeen represents, but also has a good deal of hatred for the man himself. He also knows the true nature of Aladeen's heart, and manipulates him at every turn. Anna Faris is basically relegated to being the focal point for Cohen's verbal jabs(he calls her a ""lesbian hobbit""), and it takes some getting used to seeing her held back in such a way. A number of priceless celebrity cameos also swell the film's ranks, but they are also best left unspoiled. The most surprising scene stealer of all had to be MadTV's Bobby Lee as an ambassador who likes to exert his power in a very special kind of way. Again, something best left for you to discover yourself, but let's just say it involves some very interesting folks doing something unexpected.As Cohen has branched off into more legitimate roles, such as co-starring in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, it's going to be interesting to see if it leads to a softening of his style. For now, The Dictator proves again that nobody is as outrageously offensive as Cohen, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

Then, you are abandoned in a country where you're despised by the public as a whole and must make a living. What do you do?Admiral General Hafez Aladeen (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) has been master of all he surveys in the North African Republic of Wadiya for decades. He's immature, anti-Semitic, has such poor judgment, and so little control over his libido that his bodyguards are all female and chosen primarily for their looks. In addition, he spends a fortune of his country's money for the pleasure of Megan Fox's company in the bedroom. Still, all is not perfect in the world of our conceited ruler. He must face the combined challenges of building his struggling nuclear program and keeping U.N. inspectors from discovering it. All while his right hand and uncle, Tamir (played by Ben Kingsley) grows frustrated with working for such a buffoon. Believing that he rightly belongs in the seat of power, Tamir (Kingsley) hires an American mercenary named Clayton (played by John C. Reilly) to kidnap Aladeen so that he can be replaced a look-alike they employ to foil assassination attempts. The look-alike, (also played by Cohen) is a simpleton and will be much easier to manipulate than the real Aladeen who managed to escape his captors, but not before they'd stripped him of his decorated military uniform and cut off his trademark beard. After meeting him outside the U.N., Zoey, an activist and operator of an alternative lifestyle food co-op (played by Anna Faris) offers Aladeen a job, believing he was a refugee from the oppressive regime rather than the covertly ousted oppressor himself.Now, having not seen Borat or Bruno, perhaps I was unprepared for Cohen's brand of comedy. The director, Larry Charles, was also behind the camera for Cohen's previous efforts but I'm only familiar with his work as an alumnus of the Seinfeld writing staff and as the director of the Bill Maher documentary Religulous. I am a fan of both but comparing The Dictator to Seinfeld is like comparing apples to... well, Seinfeld. And the obvious references to eccentricities exhibited by Saddam Hussein  and former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi were funny, but the protagonist himself neither funny nor sympathetic. To me, he was rarely, if ever, interesting.

1470375,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIHGI,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Sacha Baron Cohen's new comedy ""The Dictator"" is a string of hit-and-miss sketches strung together by a thin storyline about Admiral General Aladeen, ""dictator"" of a fictional North African country of Wadiya, secretly developing nuclear weapons. Like Borat and Br&uuml;no, two comic characters Sacha Baron Cohen created, Aladeen travels to USA, but what you will see is not British shock comic's risque stunt involving unsuspecting bystanders, but a more story-driven comedy with professional actors, while picking random targets.That does not mean ""The Dictator"" does not contain politically incorrect laughs. It does, and there are a lot of them, but for all these political and scatological jokes (and I find some of them pretty funny), somehow the ""Borat"" star has lost his edge. As one of the characters in the film says, he has become a ""nice"" person. Well, I mean, comparatively.In ""The Dictator"" sometimes it seems Sacha Baron Cohen wants his character to be liked by the audiences. ""The Dictator"" is clearly aimed for mainstream success, with supports from Anna Faris and Ben Kingsley, and cameo appearances of Megan Fox, John C. Reilly and Edward Norton. The film even includes a subplot about Aladeen falling in love with Anna Faris's activist Zoey. Their love story, for all the ridiculous and outrageous moments it provides, is too familiar.Where is Sacha Baron Cohen going? (After ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,"" he will be seen in ""Les Mis&eacute;rables,"" directed by Tom Hooper of ""The King's Speech"" fame). Now that his face has got more recognizable, it is unlikely that he will repeat what did in ""Borat."" Or will he?
