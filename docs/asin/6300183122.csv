202791,ARFBRSE35ZJ6A,6300183122,Bill W. Dalton,"[49, 56]","Contrary to the critics in general and the reviewers here inparticular, The Conqueror is actually a pretty good film, if you'rea John Wayne fan, or just enjoy Hollywood spectaculars as theywere made back in the '50s. Wayne was not as miscast as onemight think. He certainly had the strength of character and screenpresence to play Temujin/Genghis Khan and he looked good in theoriental mustache and the Mongol warrior garb. The dialog here isno dumber than in any other Hollywood historical saga of thattime (or of this time, either, for that matter.  Remember RussellCrowe in Gladiator: ""At my signal, unleash Hell!""?)Movie lore has it that The Conqueror was filmed on location inUtah either on or near an atomic test site, and that many of the castand crew later died from radiation-induced cancers.  It may betrue, or it may be just mythology. There were no nuclear test sitesin Utah, but the shooting location could have been near theNevada test site.  Director Powell and cast members Wayne,Hayward, Moorehead, and John Hoyt did die from cancer, but ofdifferent types and years apart.  Many others died from othercauses.  Pedro Armendariz committed suicide.  Thomas Gomezdied from an auto accident.  Lee Van Cleef died of a heart attack.And some lived to a ripe old age.  Leo Gordon, for instance,passed away just last year, at the age of78, after a brief illness.Gordon was a scriptwriter as well as an actor, and wrote twoclassic Roger Corman movies: The Terror, and The WaspWoman.The Conqueror also had the distinction of having a PlayboyPlaymate, Pat Lawler (Miss August 1955) in a bit part.  Ms.Lawler appeared in the sci-fi comedy Invasion of the Saucer Menin 1957, and that seems to be the extent of her film career..To sum up: The Conqueror is not as bad as reported. It's notnearly as bad as, say, Big Jim McLain, The FightingKentuckian, or Jet Pilot.  And it's not nearly as good as, say, TheQuiet Man, Sands of lwo Jima, or True Grit.  It's in the middle.like, say, Hatari, Circus World, or The Shootist.This DVD edition offers just the movie, a scene index, andsubtitles.  The image quality is good, but the sound varies abit--some of the dialog seems rather distant and tinny.

It has some Chinese writing in the front, but I did have the option of playing it in English.""The Conqueror"" is probably the strangest mainstream film I can recall ever seeing. It is a grand production and there is NO reason to avoid seeing this film. Nevertheless, I do have some strong opinions about the film.Today when actors take on projects that are out-of-character and don't go well, like DeNiro in ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"", we say they were experimenting in the role. On that basis, John Wayne's foray into experimentation definitely hit its peak when he starred as Genghis Khan in ""The Conqueror"". Of course, John Wayne is the quintessential ""GOOD GUY"" and ""GENGHIS KHAN"" played like a ""Good Guy"" is like ""Santa Claus"" playing a serial killer. Yucky at the very least, impossible to do well is more like it.John Wayne, or let's suspend disbelief now by just referring to him henceforth as Genghis. Okay, Genghis definitely came to work on this film and no one could say in their right mind that he didn't give his all in this try-to-be epic during this, his prime of acting power mid-1950s. Genghis was trying to be like the real Genghis, but he looked and sounded like John Wayne. Yes, the trapping of being too popular, too good-natured and too well-known definitely affected Genghis in both the making of and the audiences' reception of ""The Conqueror"".I was okay with everything right up until he slapped Susan Hayward several times [wife of Genghis according to Genghis] and ordered that several of his ""loyal"" men who were drunk on guard duty be hanged. Whether this type of violence was fitting seemed not to matter as I forgot we were watching Genghis at work and just saw John Wayne acting very unbelievably. That's it. That's what is wrong with the movie. It is VERY HARD TO BELIEVE!It's not the stilted, ridiculous dialogue. Even the best historical films have some of that, recall ""Ben Hur"". It's not the American actors like William Conrad and Agnes Moorehead passing for Asians along with the Duke [I mean Genghis]. It's not that Susan Hayward's make-up and appearance was much too modern, or that the brief, seductive dance by former Playboy Bunny Sylvia Lewis at the palace of Wang Khan [Thomas Gomez] was a bit too much, especially for 1956. It's not that Susan Hayward's father, a tribal leader, was drunk for the entire film and seemed far too crude to have Susan Hayward in her most polished state as his daughter or to lead a tribe. It's not the complete lack of regard for human life that permeates the entire film and the underlying cruelty and treachery that is implicitly and often all too explicity welded into every scene.No, it is not any one of the aforementioned issues, but all of them together that is just too much for any film to overcome. Having said that, this movie is worth watching as it is a big and rather bizarre sprawling spectacle very much in the Howard Hughes [more is better] style of filmmaking. There is no cutting corners on this film.THE DVD: Whereas the film was lavishly produced, this ""IMPORTED"" DVD is a ""single-layer"" transfer and has no features, but it does play surprisingly well for an ""IMPORTED"" product and this widescreen 2.35:1 looks much better than the video did. Though it claims to be in ""Dolby Surround"" I could not hear that, but the sound was satisfactory. It is in English only, but English or Spanish subtitles are available if needed.Somehow this spartan, imported-edition DVD sells for over $30 and the only other available DVD [Goodtimes] also starts at about $30 which makes this a questionable purchase. Many city libraries do have this dubious classic available for circulation.

202809,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300183122,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","""The Conqueror"" is a movie that is infamous in Hollywood history for two reasons, neither of which is a good. First, it is a movie that has John Wayne playing Genghis Khan with Susan Hayward, Pedro Armenderiz, Agnes Morehead, and William Conrad also playing Orientals. Wayne spouts lines of dialogue like ""I feel this Tartar woman is for me, and my blood says, take her,"" ""We'll chase them like rats across the tundra,"" and ""I am bereft of spit,"" in what must count as the most surreal performance of his career (the role was originally written by Marlon Brando). The decision to cast the Duke as Genghis Khan is, to say, the least, bizarre, and it is hard to take your eyes away from what he is doing on screen (there is a legendary Hollywood joke that the only thing worse would have been casting Mickey Rooney as Jesus in ""King of Kings"").Second, 13 weeks of this 1956 movie were spent filming in Utah a bit more than 100 miles from the site of a nuclear testing ground in Nevada and the set was contaminated by nuclear fallout from 11 blasts in 1953. After location shooting was concluded, producer Howard Hughes paid to have 60 tons of dirt shipped back to Hollywood so it could be used to match interior shootings. Of the 220 persons who worked on ""The Conqueror"" at least 91 had contracted cancer by the early 1980s and over half that number died of it, including stars Wayne, Hayward, and Morehead, and director Dick Powell (Armend?riz committed suicide when learning he was terminally ill). Statistically speaking out of a group that size only 30 people should end up with cancer. The thought that Wayne and the others would lose their lives because of a movie this bad is just a sickening thought, but the evidence seems incontrovertible and there is even a chilling photograph of Wayne on the set with a Geiger counter.""The Conqueror"" is essentially a love story between Wayne's Genghis Khan, originally named Temujin before he becomes emperor of the known world, and the beautiful Tartar princess, Bortai (Hayward). The movie has actually pays some attention to the actual history of the character and the times, at least more than the Omar Sheriff film about Genghis Khan, but clearly the idea here was that it was easier to conqueror the world than it was to tame the red headed woman in his tent. It would have helped if there was some chemistry between the two stars, but there really is not that much difference between Hayward's Bortai when she is demeaning Temujin as a Mongol or when she they ride off into the sunset at the end to live happily ever after out there on that there tundra. Then there is the idea that little Agnes Moorhead is the mother of Wayne and William Conrad, each of whom is twice her size. This film is true Hollywood turkey.Wayne had pursued the role, seeing it as just a different type of Western, and on some level you have to respect the idea of trying to stretch as an actor. But the results are just so laughable and only the sobering through that Wayne and so many of the cast would pay for this fiasco with their lives keeps this from being a real hooter deserving of ""MST3K"" treatment. For years you could not see ""The Conqueror"" because a guilty Howard Hughes pulled it from circulation (or maybe he was not being eccentric; we are talking Howard Hughes here). In fact, ""The Conqueror"" was his final film. As the most curious film in John Wayne's career it deserves to be seen at least once by both his fans and those who are just curious about one of the oddest bits of Hollywood history.",3,The infamous bad film that killed John Wayen and many others,1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,3542,"['Conqueror', 'movie', 'infamous', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'two', 'reasons', 'good', 'First', 'movie', 'John', 'Wayne', 'playing', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Pedro', 'Armenderiz', 'Agnes', 'Morehead', 'William', 'Conrad', 'also', 'playing', 'Orientals', 'Wayne', 'spouts', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'feel', 'Tartar', 'woman', 'blood', 'take', ""'ll"", 'chase', 'rats', 'tundra', 'am', 'bereft', 'spit', 'what', 'must', 'count', 'most', 'surreal', 'performance', 'career', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'decision', 'cast', 'Duke', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'say', 'least', 'bizarre', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'away', 'what', 'doing', 'screen', 'legendary', 'Hollywood', 'joke', 'only', 'thing', 'worse', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'casting', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Jesus', 'King', 'Kings', '.Second', '13', 'weeks', '1956', 'movie', 'were', 'spent', 'filming', 'Utah', 'bit', 'more', '100', 'miles', 'site', 'nuclear', 'testing', 'ground', 'Nevada', 'set', 'was', 'contaminated', 'nuclear', 'fallout', '11', 'blasts', '1953', 'location', 'shooting', 'was', 'concluded', 'producer', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'paid', 'have', '60', 'tons', 'dirt', 'shipped', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'match', 'interior', 'shootings', '220', 'persons', 'who', 'worked', 'Conqueror', 'least', '91', 'had', 'contracted', 'cancer', 'early', '1980s', 'number', 'died', 'including', 'stars', 'Wayne', 'Hayward', 'Morehead', 'director', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'Armend', 'riz', 'committed', 'suicide', 'when', 'learning', 'was', 'terminally', 'ill', 'Statistically', 'speaking', 'group', 'size', 'only', '30', 'people', 'should', 'end', 'up', 'cancer', 'thought', 'Wayne', 'others', 'would', 'lose', 'lives', 'movie', 'bad', 'just', 'sickening', 'thought', 'evidence', 'incontrovertible', 'even', 'chilling', 'photograph', 'Wayne', 'set', 'Geiger', 'counter', 'Conqueror', 'essentially', 'love', 'story', 'Wayne', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'originally', 'named', 'Temujin', 'emperor', 'known', 'world', 'beautiful', 'Tartar', 'princess', 'Bortai', 'Hayward', 'movie', 'actually', 'pays', 'attention', 'actual', 'history', 'character', 'times', 'least', 'more', 'Omar', 'Sheriff', 'film', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'clearly', 'idea', 'here', 'was', 'was', 'easier', 'conqueror', 'world', 'was', 'tame', 'red', 'headed', 'woman', 'tent', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'was', 'chemistry', 'two', 'stars', 'there', 'really', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'difference', 'Hayward', 'Bortai', 'when', 'demeaning', 'Temujin', 'Mongol', 'when', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'end', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'out', 'there', 'tundra', 'Then', 'idea', 'little', 'Agnes', 'Moorhead', 'mother', 'Wayne', 'William', 'Conrad', 'whom', 'twice', 'size', 'film', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'turkey.Wayne', 'had', 'pursued', 'role', 'seeing', 'just', 'different', 'type', 'Western', 'level', 'have', 'respect', 'idea', 'trying', 'stretch', 'actor', 'results', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'laughable', 'only', 'sobering', 'Wayne', 'so', 'many', 'cast', 'would', 'pay', 'fiasco', 'lives', 'keeps', 'being', 'real', 'hooter', 'deserving', 'MST3K', 'treatment', 'years', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'Conqueror', 'guilty', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'pulled', 'circulation', 'maybe', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'eccentric', 'are', 'talking', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'here', 'fact', 'Conqueror', 'was', 'final', 'film', 'most', 'curious', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'career', 'be', 'seen', 'least', 'once', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'curious', 'one', 'oddest', 'bits', 'Hollywood', 'history']",N/A

Apparently, everyone's favorite eccentric millionaire/filmmaker, Howard Hughes, thought this would be a smashing success. I recently watched ""Genghis Khan"" (1965) with Omar Sharif, and thought that film suffered from miscasting (James Mason as a Chinese for example). But that's nothing compared to the casting of John Wayne as the mongol warrior. Did anyone, even Hughes, ever think that was a good idea? Believe you me, this role was more than even the Duke could chew (apparently even Wayne later said he wasn't suited for the role). But it's not just Wayne's and the casting director's fault that the movie is a stinker. The dialogue is so bad it has to be seen (or heard) to be believed. Our great warrior hero Temujin/Genghis Khan (Wayne) shows all the intellect and charisma of a caveman (""I stole you. I will keep you. Before the sun sets you will come willingly to my arms!"").

202819,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6300183122,Simon Davis,"[4, 5]","Despite being such a famous and colourful historical character the great Mongol warrior and leader Genghis Khan has been a individual strangely neglected by Hollywood film makers over the decades and to date this infamous conqueror has only received two major film treatments in the seldom seen ""Genghis Khan"", from 1964 starring Omar Sharif, and this infamous 1956 version titled ""The Conqueror"". Produced by none other than Howard Hughes it of course boasts the notorious casting of John Wayne in the role of Genghis Khan or Temijin as he is known through the story, and Susan Hayward as a red haired fair skinned Tartar woman. The obvious casting absurdities aside the film also has the dubious reputation of being possibly responsible for the cancer that later killed a number of the cast and the director supposedly from the radioactive sand on the Utah location. Whether this fact is true is still hotly debated however ""The Conqueror"", is a real favourite with the often compiled ""worst fifty films of all time"" lists. In many respects that label is unfair as aside from some of the casting choices (and to give the cast credit they do good work with what they are saddled with), the film boasts wonderful production values, stunning technicolour photography, and has a sort of ""Wild West"", feel to the story that in many respects I personally find quite appealing.As the story opens we find the new warlord Temujin (John Wayne), in open warfare against the rebel tribes called the Tartars who were responsible for killing his father. On a routine raid Temujin manages to capture the caravan train of the Tartar princess Bortai (Susan Hayward), daughter of the man who slew his father. Bortai is a fearless and feisty woman who at first resists the advances of Temujin however as time goes by the hatred for the raiding mongol develops slowly into love. Temujin meanwhile must contend with the intrigues at his court, the hostility of his mother Hunlun (Agnes Moorehead), over his bringing the daughter of his father's killer into their camp, and his suspicions (which prove to be largely false), of his brother Jamuga (Pedro Armendariz). Captured by the Tartars Temujin now faces the humiliations imposed on him by his enemies however Bortai's feelings have changed towards Temujin and she assists him in his escape. Temujin faces many battles ahead as he realises he has been betrayed by Shaman (John Hoyt) chief advisor to his ally Wang Khan (Thomas Gomez). Fighting the Tartars Temujin manages to kill Bortai's father so that finally his revenge for his own father's death is complete. Despite losing his brother Jamuga who kills himself to save face over his supposed usurping of Temujin's authority while he was a captive, Temujin experiences a triumph and is acclaimed the unquestioned ruler of the whole of the Golden Horde. Temujin is seen as having proven his worth as a leader and with the loving Bortai by his side he is elected undisputed ruler of the Mongol empire and given the new name of ""Genghis Khan"", a name that would travel down through the centuries as that of one of the greatest military leaders of all time.John Wayne reportedly went after the role of Genghis Khan when ""The Conqueror"", was announced for production. He possibly saw it as a further extension of his strong action man image on screen and in that respect apart from his absurd casting as a Mongol, he was right. If you can get over his strange and unconvincing makeup and usual drawl he actually does quite well in the role however never for one moment do you not think it's John Wayne up there on screen. He actually works very well with the equally miscast Susan Hayward and their ongoing love hate relationship is one of the better elements in the story. Haywards's character of Bortai is a welcome change from most heroines of 1950's epics in the respect that she is an extremely strong and determined woman who matches Temujin/Genghis Khan all the way in courage and endurance. It's amazing to remember that only two years after this much ridiculed effort Susan Hayward appeared in her Academy Award winning role in the classic ""I Want To Live!"", which just goes to show the ups and downs that even top actresses experience when at their peak. Susan Hayward was a fine dramatic actress but unfortunately had a very modern screen persona which clashes badly here with her role of a Tartar noblewoman. Rarely however has she looked more beautiful on screen than here and she makes a brave attempt to make something out of her character. The supporting cast in ""The Conqueror"", is certainly second to none with the great Agnes Moorehead playing Temujin/Genghis Khan's mother Hunlun in a very effective style and she probably has the best makeup of any of the caucasian actors in the cast. Being the gifted actress she was Moorehead makes the most of her small role as the great warrior's embittered mother. Pedro Armendariz as Temujin's brother Jamuga, Thomas Gomez as Temujin's weak ally Wang Khan and especially John Holt as the wily Shaman round out the cast effectively although their varying look under their oriental makeup is jarring especially in the tent city scenes where it is obvious that real Mongol extras have been employed as background atmosphere. Directed rather surprisingly by Dick Powell in his debut behind the camera the action certainly keeps rolling which as stated gives ""The Conqueror"", the feel of a western. On the production side of things the actual locations used here in Utah, despite their possible tragic after effects on the cast are still breathtakingly impressive and succeed quite well in standing in for the unavailable real Gobi Desert. The research that went into the Mongol costumes, weapons and tent housing is also first rate and helps give the film some of it's most redeeming qualities. Of course for most viewers the at times comical lines in the screenplay by Oscar Millard will always be the thing about ""The Conqueror', that they will remember. Lines such as ""You are beautiful in your wrath!"", ""I am bereft of spit"", are not exactly out of Masterpiece Theatre but I guess give the film it's ongoing fun house appeal for most.Long out of circulation because it was tied up as part of the estate of Howard Hughes, this film is now more of a curiosity piece than anything else and is still surprisingly not that well known by even many movie buffs. Never could ""The Conqueror"", be placed among the greats of 1950's epic story telling such as ""Quo Vadis"", and ""The Ten Commandments"", however its terrible reputation is in many respects I feel largely undeserved. I tend to view it as an enjoyable, rough and tumble asian western if such a thing is possible. Many people draw attention to some of the (I'm sure), unintentionally hilarious lines that are littered throughout the screenplay and while they also bring a smile to my face I still think ""The Conqueror"", is worth a look by film buffs. Its best features are certainly its lavish production values and in among the miscasting the truly sincere efforts by all cast members to rise above the handicaps that the film has placed on them. Certainly in the super sensitive presentday plagued as it is by stringent and at times totally unnecessary political correctness ""The Conqueror"", would never be made in the form it was by Howard Hughes here. ""The Conqueror"", is a odd piece of Hollywood history that you should try to catch at least once enabling you to then make up your own mind about its real worth.
