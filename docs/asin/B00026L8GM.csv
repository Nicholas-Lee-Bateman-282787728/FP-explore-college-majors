The gene has been past from generation to generation waiting to awakening in a worthy heir, one who is strong enough.

But there's even more cool stuff in this volume... we finally get to see Koenma in action, Sensui's final personality comes out, Kurama transforms back into Youko Kurama, Kuwabara goes crazy with the dimension sword, and one of the main YYH heroes dies!

825176,A29GGWB3GGQBO9,B00026L8GM,GPeralta,"[0, 0]","At the time when this DVD was first released, Toonami had just stopped airing YYH, stopping a couple episodes before the ones covered on this disc. However, that didn't stop me from getting this, since the item description on the back seemed to take the story line into a dramatically different direction.Without giving much away, these four episodes cover Yusuke's transformation while facing off against rogue Spirit Detective Sensui. These episodes also happen to be the final ones from the Saga (NOT the series) and do a good job of tying up some loose ends, with the final episode on the disc describing what happened to each of the seven psychics as well as our group of heroes.Like the series in general, the episodes are available subtitled with the Japanese audio track, or in the English dub, which I think does a good job of embellighing upon the original script, sprinkling bits of sarcasm here and there the lighten up the mood. As always, this release has the episodes uncut, showing a handful of things that you would have never seen if you just watched them as they were aired on Toonami, including some bits of swearing on Yusuke's part (but is that really a surprise?).Again, like most FUNimation DVD releases, the special features are far from special, with a handful of trailers for other anime as well as creditless opening and ending animations. But I wasn't really expecting else.The episodes here are awesome, and WOULD be worth the buy (gasp!) if the episodes weren't being re-released as we speak. These newer releases are being release in two disc volumes, each volume covering a span of 14 episodes (so I guess that would be 7 per disc).At the time this was first released, YYH fans didn't really have much of a choice, what with the series suddenly stopping on Toonami. Thus, purchasing these single disc releases were the best alternatice for fans at the time. But, considering the circumstances happeneing with the series now, what with the new re-releases coming out, I'd hold back on this purchase.So, if you haven't got these episodes yet, I'd definitely hold back on getting this single disc release and wait for the re-release to come out later this year. But if you're not a hardcore fan of the series and only want certain episodes, then this is definitely a recommendation if you can get it for $10 or less.",5,Good For its Time,1179792000,"05 22, 2007",2007,2346,"['time', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Toonami', 'had', 'just', 'stopped', 'airing', 'YYH', 'stopping', 'couple', 'ones', 'covered', 'disc', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'getting', 'item', 'description', 'back', 'seemed', 'take', 'story', 'line', 'dramatically', 'different', 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'four', 'episodes', 'cover', 'Yusuke', 'transformation', 'facing', 'off', 'rogue', 'Spirit', 'Detective', 'Sensui', 'episodes', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'final', 'ones', 'Saga', 'NOT', 'series', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'final', 'episode', 'disc', 'describing', 'what', 'happened', 'seven', 'psychics', 'as', 'well', 'group', 'heroes.Like', 'series', 'general', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'subtitled', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'track', 'English', 'dub', 'think', 'good', 'job', 'embellighing', 'original', 'script', 'sprinkling', 'bits', 'sarcasm', 'here', 'there', 'lighten', 'up', 'mood', 'always', 'release', 'episodes', 'uncut', 'showing', 'handful', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'just', 'watched', 'were', 'aired', 'Toonami', 'including', 'bits', 'swearing', 'Yusuke', 'part', 'really', 'surprise', '.Again', 'most', 'FUNimation', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'far', 'special', 'handful', 'trailers', 'other', 'anime', 'as', 'well', 'creditless', 'opening', 'ending', 'animations', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'else.The', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'awesome', 'WOULD', 'be', 'buy', 'gasp', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'being', 're-released', 'speak', 'newer', 'releases', 'are', 'being', 'release', 'two', 'disc', 'volumes', 'volume', 'covering', 'span', '14', 'episodes', 'guess', 'would', 'be', '7', 'disc', 'time', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'YYH', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'choice', 'what', 'series', 'suddenly', 'stopping', 'Toonami', 'Thus', 'purchasing', 'single', 'disc', 'releases', 'were', 'best', 'alternatice', 'fans', 'time', 'considering', 'circumstances', 'happeneing', 'series', 'now', 'what', 'new', 're-releases', 'coming', ""'d"", 'hold', 'back', 'purchase.So', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'episodes', 'yet', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'hold', 'back', 'getting', 'single', 'disc', 'release', 'wait', 're-release', 'come', 'out', 'later', 'year', ""'re"", 'not', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'series', 'only', 'want', 'certain', 'episodes', 'then', 'definitely', 'recommendation', 'can', 'get', '10', 'less']",N/A
825177,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00026L8GM,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper.She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.After killing Yusuke Sensui is pursued by Kurama, Hiei, and Kuwabara through the tunnel and into the demon world. Yusuke reawakens as a demon and follows. The final battle with Sensui is underway, and will soon end with a bang.This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",5,Back to demon world,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,1450,"['Yusuke', 'Urameshi', 'high', 'school', 'delinquent', ""n't"", 'go', 'class', 'always', 'getting', 'fights', 'One', 'day', 'trying', 'save', 'boy', 'be', 'hit', 'car', 'killed', 'instead', 'approached', 'pretty', 'girl', 'flying', 'broom', 'name', 'Botan', 'Grimm', 'Reaper.She', 'chance', 'regain', 'life', 'coming', 'back', 'life', 'Yusuke', 'Spirit', 'Detective', 'gain', 'spiritual', 'powers', 'hunts', 'down', 'rogue', 'apparitions', 'cause', 'trouble', 'living', 'world', 'joined', 'friend', 'Kuwabara', 'demons', 'Hiei', 'Kurama', 'Together', 'fight', 'off', 'deadly', 'demons', 'seek', 'destroy', 'world.After', 'killing', 'Yusuke', 'Sensui', 'pursued', 'Kurama', 'Hiei', 'Kuwabara', 'tunnel', 'demon', 'world', 'demon', 'final', 'battle', 'Sensui', 'underway', 'will', 'soon', 'end', 'bang.This', 'great', 'series', 'lots', 'cool', 'characters', 'good', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'engrossing', 'story', 'very', 'long', 'anime', 'so', 'want', 'watch', 'be', 'prepared', 'like', 'spend', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'Even', 'bang', 'up', 'start', 'flow', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'bit', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'vibe', 'everyone', 'likes', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'anime', 'fan', 'simply', 'amazing']",N/A
