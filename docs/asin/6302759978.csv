The only thing I liked about this movie was the photo of Kristy McNichol with her finger over her lips as if she had a secret.  The &quot;secret&quot; is that she really should have been in Flashdance and not this disaster of a film!I really wanted to like this movie simply because Kristy was in it, but have to say that it was phoney, unrealistic and didn't convince me that it was a script worthy of ever being put into production.  It seemed that it was designed to promote the careers of men, at Kristy McNichol's expense.After seeing this movie I actually had fantasies of throwing the video off the cliff into the ocean here in San Francisco, but I didn't want to break the law.

In this movie she portrays a flutist named Susan Berlanger. Susan had polio as a child and as a result must wear a leg brace that she feels keeps her from finding the love of her life. Because of this, she decides to settle for all that she thinks that she's worthy of....marrying a male friend of her's who happens to be gay, a marriage of convenience for both.  He can carry on with men without being detected as gay at the company he works for and she can eliminate the pressure from her parents (and society)to be married, plus the added security of being taken care of. Anyway, Susan decides to break her engagement and take a once in a lifetime vacation at a French ski resort where she cleverly learns that she can exchange or disguise her leg brace for a cast and consequently, stop people from feeling sorry for her and staring at her because she has a leg brace. After carrying on numerous flirtations with several different men at the resort, she meets a handsome photographer played by Michael Ontkean and they fall in love but she's afraid that once he learns about her leg brace that he won't love her anymore. The popular Billy Joel tune of the same title will be in your head as you watch this film and, bottom line, who doesn't want to be loved ""Just The Way You Are"".....?

Kristy McNicol's character reminds me of her, and like Kristy McNicol this girl was very attractive.  In fact, she was more beautiful than the actress.  And, even though she was on crutches (some handicap) she had lots of boyfriends.  Tons.  It just goes to show you that no matter who you are or what condition you're in, if you're a cute girl, guys will go for you.But, no matter how true that statement this film just assumes we'll buy into the poor little beautiful girl who is suddenly unattractive because she's disabled.  Well, okay (he said smiling). :)We as audience buy into that anyway, and we follow her adventures and misadventures as she tries to escape her stigma by disguising her handicap.  It works, and again we as the audience think her clever as she regains a social freedom that she's never had before.  She finds love, sex, and all that goes with it.
