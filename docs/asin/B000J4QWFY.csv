I highly enjoyed this film and i'm surprised not more people like it. The dvd comes with a behind the scenes feature that is almost half an hour, which was a surprise.

I love the Z-Grade zombie movie, the DIY microbudget gore fests, so I picked this one up for cheap not expecting much, and I actually found myself enjoying it. The plot is pretty good, and it is pulled off decently, the acting is so-so, not bad, I've definitely seen worse. The zombies look pretty good, and the gore is above average as well. It has all of the elements a watchable zombie movie needs, and while the pacing could be tightened up, and maybe some more zombie action could have been included, I was never really bored by the movie. It also had some pretty good production value as well, this is no camcorder movie. It is not a Romero zombie flick, but is still better than a lot of crap out there, I would call this an above average zombie movie, not great by any means, but still a solid addition to anyone's zombie collection.",3,The Quick and the Undead,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,919,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'love', 'Z-Grade', 'zombie', 'movie', 'DIY', 'microbudget', 'gore', 'fests', 'picked', 'one', 'up', 'cheap', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'actually', 'found', 'enjoying', 'plot', 'pretty', 'good', 'pulled', 'off', 'decently', 'acting', 'so-so', 'not', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'seen', 'worse', 'zombies', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'gore', 'above', 'average', 'as', 'well', 'elements', 'watchable', 'zombie', 'movie', 'needs', 'pacing', 'could', 'be', 'tightened', 'up', 'maybe', 'more', 'zombie', 'action', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'bored', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'production', 'value', 'as', 'well', 'camcorder', 'movie', 'not', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'flick', 'still', 'better', 'lot', 'crap', 'there', 'would', 'call', 'above', 'average', 'zombie', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'means', 'still', 'solid', 'addition', 'anyone', 'zombie', 'collection']",The Quick and the Undead
1025096,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000J4QWFY,Jason,"[3, 6]","Biological warfare leads to the creation of a landscape littered with zombies roaming the land.  An unidentified man gives himself an experimental injection with the hope of virus immunity.  Bounties are paid to hunters for killing zombies; payments are based upon appendages collected at the kill site.  Sounds like a great premise, right?  Too bad the movie ruined it.This movie is from A to Z bad, here are a few examples:Acting - Not a single cast member utters a convincing line; they're horrible.Blood - B should have been for budget, because neither ketchup nor koolaid is a convincing alternative for blood.Cast - They're atrociously untalented, with preposterous accents and absolutely no tangible emotion whatsoever.Direction - It's all over the map and disorganized.Filming - Aside from one or two decent scenes, the whole thing gives off the feel of a high level high school AV club production.Lighting - Dark and amateur at best, there are scenes in which some color scheme is attempted, but it never accomplishes what the director wants.  And I think they fell in love with the color blue for some reason.Makeup - Put on by a blind transvestite.Protagonist - A cross between a weather-beaten desperado who carries his gun in a guitar case, and a poor man's Hugh Jackman from Van HelsingSettings - The settings are essentially someone's backyard and one or two low rent properties.Zombies - Aside from the soundtrack, the zombies were the only redeemable aspect of the movie.Pass on this one unless you want to become a zombie in the little over an hour this movie will sap from your life.",2,Quick and the Undead?

The movie starts our great and is well-paced but drags towards the end when the zombies maraud the house. The dialog is typical cowboy cheesy and the acting, while somewhat hackneyed and stilted serves its purpose well even though the characters are stereotypes. While this movie is certainly no masterpiece, it does help and improve on the genre, so as zombie movies go, it's quite good. The zombies themselves are definitely Romero descended but aren't quite the shambling corpses they started out as.*Spoiler Alert*The only real problem I have with this film is the hero is somehow immune  to the Zombie Virus.
