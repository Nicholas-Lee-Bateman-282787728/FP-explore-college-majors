1099553,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000V7HGLI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Despite the fact that this film offends the Lovecraft scholar in me by totally exploiting and subverting the very nature of the Great God Cthulhu in the most ridiculous of ways (nor did I care for the unnecessary political pot-shots thrown in for no good reason), I was sort of digging The Slaughter as it meandered its way along (I'm not too proud to admit that the 3 Bs usually work for me).  Then, almost on a dime, the film completely switched its identity from bad low-budget horror to inane zombie comedy.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie completely jump sub-genres so suddenly and completely.  It's as if the filmmakers and writers just suddenly stopped working and turned the final twenty-five minutes of the film over to a random group of 13-year-old boys who just finished watchingShaun of the Dead.  I mean I sat and watched this film essentially commit cinematic suicide before my very eyes - the transformation is that radical and disastrous.  I can only hope that director Jay Lee's next film,Zombie Strippers (Unrated Special Edition), fares better than this one.The Slaughter opens with an invocation ceremony performed by a group of naked chicks, mispronouncing the Cthulhu chant straight out of Lovecraft to raise a skin-damaged crone with sagging breasts (and everything else) that they have the gall to call Cthulhu (or, as they say it, Cthul-a).  (For those not acquainted with Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, let me assure you that the real Cthulhu is a gigantic, terrifying, tentacled Great Old One so ancient as to be neither good nor evil, with no sexual characteristics whatsoever.)  Soon thereafter, a group of dumb, stereotypical college-age kids arrive on scene at a remote and spooky house, charged with cleaning the long-abandoned place under the watchful eyes of their uber-jerk boss and his annoying personal minion.  You've got the normal guy (Terry Erioski) with his level-headed girlfriend (Jessica Ellis aka Jessica Custodio), a little Karl Marx wannabe named Iggy (Zak Kilberg) always going on and on about the coming proletarian revolution, a dopehead (Billy Beck) who prefers to travel in the trunks of cars, and the pairing of a flirtatious hottie (Laura Stein aka Laura Bach) and her jealous boyfriend (Travis Wood) - you know you can't be raising demons without some hanky-panky up in that joint.In a clear rip-off ofThe Evil Dead, the kids find an ancient tome of demonic incantations down in the basement and, despite the warnings of Iggy (who suddenly turns into an expert on occult matters), go about doing the very things called for in the ritual described in the book, usually to their great misfortune.  The filmmakers aren't shy about indulging in blood and gore, but, unfortunately, the special effects are far too fake for you to even think about taking seriously.  I haven't seen this much stop motion animation since 1933's King Kong.  The acting was a little uneven throughout (and downright bad in some of the film's disastrous final twenty-five minutes), but it could have been much worse (especially since Jay Lee has said the cast basically worked for free).  I do hope to see Laura Stein (or Bach or whatever she wants to call herself) in future films because she has the goods, as far as I'm concerned - the camera definitely loves her, and for good reason.Director Jay Lee will tell you The Slaughter was envisioned from the start as a horror comedy, but I'm not buying it (nor did Lionsgate, who marketed it as ""an old school camp-o-rama bloodfest"").  In a way, it doesn't even matter.

1099554,A19LGBGAQVATC8,B000V7HGLI,Eddie Quist,"[0, 1]","""The Slaughter"" was quite an unexpected surprise, as usually these type of (Demonic) low budget filcks are just plain aweful. With that in mind, I certainly was not expecting much from ""The Slaughter"", but director Jay Lee had something else in mind.First off, I have to explain what I believe to be one of the best opening scenes that I have ever seen in an Indie Horror film. We all know that at some point there will be breasts, we've all come to understand and often wonder when the cannons are going to come out... Right?""The Slaughter"" doesn't make us wait long, as a bevy of witchy women wearing black robes and chanting some evil language decide to drop their robes and bare it all during the first two minutes of the film. This set the tone for me, and I realized that this guy (Lee) understands the genre, and what we expect from it.The story itself, is nothing new. A group of Horror movie cliche' young adults are hired to clean out an old creepy mansion, that is now owned by some a@*hole rich guy. Of course, they are all obsessed with sex, drugs and rock-n-roll, and get into all sorts of stupid shenanigans, and end up being possessed by evil spirits. We've seen this before, but I have to give my props to Mr. Lee and gang, as they set the bar a bit higher for this B-Movie genre by presenting us with decent gore and stellar makeup effects. The acting is admirable for the most part, but does have it's rough edges, however this is overlooked because the film (as a whole) entertains the veiwer.No, it's not going to change any lives, but if you're a fan of low budget Horror (like I am), you will not be let down.A nice little find for my collection.",4,Adventurous (Low Budget) Possessed Fun,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",2009,1669,"['Slaughter', 'was', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'usually', 'type', 'Demonic', 'low', 'budget', 'filcks', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'aweful', 'mind', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'Slaughter', 'director', 'Jay', 'Lee', 'had', 'something', 'else', 'mind.First', 'have', 'explain', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'opening', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Indie', 'Horror', 'film', 'know', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'breasts', ""'ve"", 'come', 'understand', 'often', 'wonder', 'when', 'cannons', 'are', 'going', 'come', 'out', 'Right', 'Slaughter', ""n't"", 'make', 'wait', 'long', 'bevy', 'witchy', 'women', 'wearing', 'black', 'robes', 'chanting', 'evil', 'language', 'decide', 'drop', 'robes', 'bare', 'first', 'two', 'minutes', 'film', 'set', 'tone', 'realized', 'guy', 'Lee', 'genre', 'what', 'expect', 'it.The', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'group', 'Horror', 'movie', 'cliche', 'young', 'adults', 'are', 'hired', 'clean', 'out', 'old', 'creepy', 'mansion', 'now', 'owned', '@', '*hole', 'rich', 'guy', 'course', 'are', 'obsessed', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock-n-roll', 'get', 'sorts', 'stupid', 'shenanigans', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'possessed', 'evil', 'spirits', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'gang', 'set', 'bar', 'bit', 'higher', 'B-Movie', 'genre', 'presenting', 'decent', 'gore', 'stellar', 'makeup', 'effects', 'acting', 'admirable', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'rough', 'edges', 'however', 'overlooked', 'film', 'whole', 'veiwer.No', 'not', 'going', 'change', 'lives', ""'re"", 'fan', 'low', 'budget', 'Horror', 'am', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'let', 'down.A', 'nice', 'little', 'find', 'collection']","Slaughter, The 2006"
1099555,AHVG37KI3IM38,B000V7HGLI,G-Fan,"[3, 3]","First off - I love horror movies.  I have for pretty much as long as I can remember.  I don't consider myself an expert or even an aficionado - I'm just a fan.  I know what I like, and I certainly know what I don't like.  Generally speaking, I watch movies to be entertained.  If the entertainment value is not there, I probably will not watch a film a second time.I just finished my third viewing of The Slaughter.  Having seen it the first two times when it was showing On-Demand on TV over the past year or two, something about it stuck with me.  When I recently saw that Amazon had it for a very good price, I went ahead and ordered the DVD.I have to admit, I fail to understand all the hate for this film.  This is not high art, and it has no pretensions of being so.  It's just a group of semi-talented people who got together to try and make an entertaining low-budget horror film with a sense of humor.  To that end, I think they succeeded.  Sure, the acting is far from top-notch, often being pretty over-the-top. And the storyline doesn't make much sense at times.  But how many horror movies could those same shortcomings be attributed to? A LOT of them, in my viewing experience.  And in my many years of watching films of this genre, there have been more than a few I have given up on.  Not so with The Slaughter.  It holds my interest throughout, has me roll my eyes a number times, but also makes me laugh, and - bottom line - ENTERTAINS me.  And for me, at least, that's what it's all about.Is this film trying to rip off The Evil Dead?  Probably.  At least it's a rip-off, or perhaps even an homage, and not some lame big studio attempt to remake what is arguably a classic horror film (let's face it - The Evil Dead wasn't high art, either.  Just a group of (at the time) semi-talented people who got together to try and make an entertaining low-budget horror film with a sense of humor........(sound familiar?)  While the plot won't win any awards, it's fairly straightforward for a movie of this kind, and yes - it owes more than just a little bit to the first two Evil Dead films.  It has pretty girls, nudity, and gore - all the basic elements for any modern horror film.I'll admit that when I first watched it, the sudden shift two-thirds of the way through from horror/humor to horror/COMEDY was a bit jarring.  It would have been a bit like if the first Evil Dead film had shifted 2/3 of the way through into the much more comedy-laden aspect of the second film.  With The Slaughter, I basically didn't see that coming, but still stuck with it until the end.  I'm glad I did, for I feel I was rewarded with a pretty fun ride.  Certainly fun enough to warrant a couple of subsequent viewings.On a scale of one to five, I would probably give The Slaughter a solid two-and-a-half stars.  But I'm rounding it up to three, rather than down, as I feel it's better than a two star movie, and well - there simply aren't any other three star reviews at present (that, and Amazon's rating system doesn't allow for half stars).  All in all, I found it a rather uneven but reasonably satisfying little film, and I was more than happy to add it to my DVD collection at a relatively low price.",3,Not As Bad As You May Have Been Led To Believe,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,3204,"['First', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'expert', 'even', 'aficionado', ""'m"", 'just', 'fan', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'certainly', 'know', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'watch', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'there', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'film', 'second', 'time.I', 'just', 'finished', 'third', 'viewing', 'Slaughter', 'Having', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'showing', 'On-Demand', 'TV', 'past', 'year', 'two', 'something', 'stuck', 'When', 'recently', 'saw', 'Amazon', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'went', 'ahead', 'ordered', 'DVD.I', 'have', 'admit', 'fail', 'understand', 'hate', 'film', 'not', 'high', 'art', 'pretensions', 'being', 'so', 'just', 'group', 'semi-talented', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'together', 'try', 'make', 'entertaining', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'sense', 'humor', 'end', 'think', 'succeeded', 'Sure', 'acting', 'far', 'top-notch', 'often', 'being', 'pretty', 'over-the-top', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'times', 'how', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'could', 'same', 'shortcomings', 'be', 'attributed', 'LOT', 'viewing', 'experience', 'many', 'years', 'watching', 'films', 'genre', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'few', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'Not', 'so', 'Slaughter', 'interest', 'roll', 'eyes', 'number', 'times', 'also', 'bottom', 'line', 'ENTERTAINS', 'least', 'what', 'about.Is', 'film', 'trying', 'rip', 'off', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Probably', 'least', 'rip-off', 'perhaps', 'even', 'homage', 'not', 'lame', 'big', 'studio', 'attempt', 'remake', 'what', 'arguably', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'let', 'face', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'was', ""n't"", 'high', 'art', 'Just', 'group', 'time', 'semi-talented', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'together', 'try', 'make', 'entertaining', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'sense', 'humor', '..', 'sound', 'familiar', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'movie', 'kind', 'yes', 'more', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'first', 'two', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'films', 'pretty', 'girls', 'nudity', 'gore', 'basic', 'elements', 'modern', 'horror', 'film.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'sudden', 'shift', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'horror/humor', 'horror/COMEDY', 'was', 'bit', 'jarring', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'first', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'film', 'had', 'shifted', '2/3', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'comedy-laden', 'aspect', 'second', 'film', 'Slaughter', 'basically', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'still', 'stuck', 'end', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'rewarded', 'pretty', 'fun', 'ride', 'Certainly', 'fun', 'enough', 'warrant', 'couple', 'subsequent', 'viewings.On', 'scale', 'one', 'five', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'Slaughter', 'solid', 'two-and-a-half', 'stars', ""'m"", 'rounding', 'three', 'rather', 'down', 'feel', 'better', 'two', 'star', 'movie', 'well', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'other', 'three', 'star', 'reviews', 'present', 'Amazon', 'rating', 'system', ""n't"", 'allow', 'half', 'stars', 'found', 'rather', 'uneven', 'reasonably', 'satisfying', 'little', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'relatively', 'low', 'price']","Slaughter, The 2006"

Since many, many more people have seen that one, I think it rates as a good comparison; if you found that movie groanworthy, you're going to hate this. Lee takes the usual tack towards making a horror-comedy--slap a bunch of stereotyped characters together and give them something aimed at killing them all off. Which often works, if you're going to do something interesting and creative with the stereotypes, interesting and creative with the killer, or interesting and creative with the murders. Not much of any of the three here, though I have to admit the comic timing actually started working in about the final fifteen minutes of the movie. Until then, the only ecuse to keep watching it is that the cast is chock full of drop dead gorgeous ladies who seem to be allergic to clothing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. **",2,The Stupid.,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,1031,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Slaughter', 'lt', '>', 'Jay', 'Lee', '2006', 'Jay', 'Lee', 'followed', 'up', 'lt', '>', 'Slaughter', 'lt', '>', 'anemic', 'sophomore', 'sophomoric', 'effort', 'lt', '>', 'Zombie', 'Strippers', 'lt', '>', '2008', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'think', 'rates', 'good', 'comparison', 'found', 'movie', 'groanworthy', ""'re"", 'going', 'hate', 'Lee', 'usual', 'tack', 'towards', 'making', 'horror-comedy', 'slap', 'bunch', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'together', 'give', 'something', 'aimed', 'killing', 'off', 'Which', 'often', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'something', 'interesting', 'creative', 'stereotypes', 'interesting', 'creative', 'killer', 'interesting', 'creative', 'murders', 'Not', 'much', 'three', 'here', 'have', 'admit', 'comic', 'timing', 'actually', 'started', 'working', 'final', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'then', 'only', 'ecuse', 'keep', 'watching', 'cast', 'chock', 'full', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'ladies', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'allergic', 'clothing', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', '**']","Slaughter, The 2006"

After the film arrived and I sat down to begin my viewing experience, I was surprised as to what exactly the film entailed.  From the opening credits until the end credits, there's no lack of violence, action, gore, or suspense.  ""The Slaughter"" does a great job of providing scares, chills, and even laughs to the audience.The film comes off as trying to emulate ""Evil Dead"" only with a much tighter budget and less known and talented actors than what ""Evil Dead"" had at its disposal all those years ago.  However, to say the film is horrible just because of the lack of funding or well known actors would be a disservice to the viewing experience as a whole.The film starts off by depicting a cult of female witches performing a seance to resurrect an evil demonic woman from her grave.  As the witches perform their seance, there is an abundance of violence and nudity, lots of nudity.  All of this occurs from the very second you press ""play"" on your remote.  Immediately following the nudity and violence that occurs during the seance, the film cuts away to a young woman waking in the middle of the night and discovering that her daughter has been slaughtered in her sleep.  Trying to escape, the woman is flung down the stairs and impaled on a coat-hanger in the most obscure of bodily locations.""The Slaughter"" continues the story by having a group of clean up workers spending the weekend at the home several years later in an attempt to refurbish the home for resale.  What they weren't expecting was the evil spirit that still lingers within the halls of the home.  One by one the workers are picked off as the evil spirit attempts to resurrect once again.  The scenes that follow include graphic depictions of gore and nudity, both of which are usually considered must-haves for horror films.If you're looking for a cheesy movie with the occasional laugh-inducing dialogue and scenes, while still getting nudity and violence, then there's nothing better than ""The Slaughter"".  Just don't expect a triple A quality film with great acting.  But for those who enjoy violent , independent films, ""The Slaughter"" is perfect for a late night viewing.",5,"Cheesy, In a Good Way, Like a Hamburger....Not Feet",1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,2299,"['Netflix', 'called', 'film', 'campy', 'better', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'caught', 'attention', 'so', 'was', 'instantly', 'added', 'queue', 'film', 'arrived', 'sat', 'down', 'begin', 'viewing', 'experience', 'was', 'surprised', 'what', 'exactly', 'film', 'entailed', 'opening', 'credits', 'end', 'credits', 'lack', 'violence', 'action', 'gore', 'suspense', 'Slaughter', 'great', 'job', 'providing', 'scares', 'chills', 'even', 'audience.The', 'film', 'off', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'only', 'much', 'tighter', 'budget', 'less', 'known', 'talented', 'actors', 'what', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'had', 'disposal', 'years', 'ago', 'However', 'say', 'film', 'horrible', 'just', 'lack', 'funding', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'disservice', 'viewing', 'experience', 'whole.The', 'film', 'off', 'depicting', 'cult', 'female', 'witches', 'performing', 'seance', 'resurrect', 'evil', 'demonic', 'woman', 'grave', 'witches', 'perform', 'seance', 'abundance', 'violence', 'nudity', 'lots', 'nudity', 'occurs', 'very', 'second', 'press', 'play', 'remote', 'Immediately', 'following', 'nudity', 'violence', 'seance', 'film', 'away', 'young', 'woman', 'waking', 'middle', 'night', 'discovering', 'daughter', 'been', 'slaughtered', 'sleep', 'Trying', 'escape', 'woman', 'flung', 'stairs', 'impaled', 'coat-hanger', 'most', 'obscure', 'bodily', 'locations', 'Slaughter', 'story', 'having', 'group', 'clean', 'workers', 'spending', 'weekend', 'home', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'attempt', 'refurbish', 'home', 'resale', 'What', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'was', 'evil', 'spirit', 'still', 'halls', 'home', 'One', 'one', 'workers', 'are', 'picked', 'off', 'evil', 'spirit', 'attempts', 'resurrect', 'once', 'again', 'scenes', 'follow', 'include', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'gore', 'nudity', 'are', 'usually', 'considered', 'must-haves', 'horror', 'films.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'occasional', 'laugh-inducing', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'still', 'getting', 'nudity', 'violence', 'then', 'nothing', 'better', 'Slaughter', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'triple', 'A', 'quality', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'who', 'enjoy', 'violent', 'independent', 'films', 'Slaughter', 'perfect', 'late', 'night', 'viewing']","Slaughter, The 2006"

I thought maybe this was like a hidden gem plus I got it for a dollar because I bought a bunch of used movies. Anyways I get home pop it in and watch the previews. First thing I see is that Lionsgate distributes this so I was like cool, I like most of what Lionsgate puts out, then the previews start and each one looks crappier and crappier, homemade can't act right B.S. Now I was worried. Finally get to the movie and guess what, same thing, looks like they recorded it with a home video camera, acting is super weak and it just looks like garbage. This movie is horrible in every sense of the word, I don't know what film festivals they played this at and won but they must be some super sucky festivals!
