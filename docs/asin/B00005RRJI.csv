680201,AOQLO5AHYBNZL,B00005RRJI,AnimalLuVer,"[3, 4]","Expect to be surprised when you see Come Undone, and I do recommend you see it at least once.  Having seen it last year and watched it again yesterday, I'm glad I saw it the second time.  I found ""Come Undone"" exciting, mournful, sexy, stirring, sad, provacative, and fun, . . . all at once:  Even better than I expected!It's a fine story of a boy's realization of his sexual identity, by falling in love with another boy!  ""Coming of age"" is difficult enough, but Mathieu also is coming to terms with being gay.  Well, at least the object of his affections, Cedric, is very handsome.  YET, thankfully, in the entire movie there are none of the stereotypically ""gay"" characters pulled out of some SoHo or South Beach gym.  The two guys are people anyone would like, though not at all perfect.While there are no gratuitous sex scenes nor unnecessary nakedness, this IS a story about two healthy young guys falling in love and you will see them naked enough to convey the story.  There's a very, uh, steamy sex scene!  And when I say there's some naked scenes, I mean these men are naked.  It's really all very tasteful, though not at all mild by America's prudish neo-Victorian standards.It wouldn't be a very realistic depiction of boyhood if these guys didn't have any ""issues"".  Well, it IS a genuine story and these guys have some problems, but none of the cliche standard-fare crap you get from every American coming of age film.  Frankly, I didn't like the problems the author chose for either of the boys -- but then neither did Mathieu or Cedric!  Fortunately, the problems were perfect for the story because they explain how these two boys chanced to meet in the first place.  NOTE that what I mean is that I like the persons the two characters seem to be, so I find myself wishing they didn't have those problems.  Just empathy, which is the best compliment I could give a movie.What's more intriguing is the way issues are treated by the storyteller.  As much as I enjoyed this movie -- and I plan to watch it again this weekend -- I still can't entirely understand why the author chose to begin and end it in the ways he did.  Probably, though, that is because I'm only used to American movies with their all-too-cliche endings where everything is wrapped up.  But that's just it!  At age 18, nothing is resolved in life.  A guy that age has a lot of years ahead of him -- whether he's ready to deal with life or not.So both the ending and the beginning perfectly reflect that reality.  Most of the other reviews make far too much ado about Mathieu's mother.  Her illness is not the issue.  Like any 18 year old, the problem for Mathieu is that he actually HAS a mother, two sisters, and a father.  For those are major impediments to love and sex and self-discovery for every healthy teenager in the world.The story was told very effectively, though not entirely chronologically.  It's COMPELLING so expect to want to watch it again, so that'll be just fine.  When the film ends, I don't know whether to be hopeful or sad for Mathieu, and that reminds me how it was to be eighteen.This is a fine film.  I can immediately think of two reasons to be glad this is a French film.  All the dialogue is in native French and it sounds wonderful.  While reading the subtitles you will absorb extra meaning from the tones and inflections of the actors.  IT IS VERY EASY TO ENJOY THE MOVIE IN THAT THE SUBTITLES WILL NOT SLOW YOU DOWN LIKE IN SOME MOVIES.  For example, that Jean Reno movie, ""Crimson Rivers: Angels of the Apcalypse"" -- I very much like that movie by the way, watched it twice -- in that movie I found myself reversing the DVD frequently to catch both what was said and what happened on screen, and certain nuances.  Much as I enjoyed it, it was frustrating.  ANYWAY, the second reason, without giving anything away, is that in ""Come Undone"" things that in American films would be distractions are nonissues in France, at least the France depicted in the movie.(Again, I do recommend that Jean Reno's Crimson Rivers, which, with some careful inspection and reversing of a particular scene near the beginning, has an important surprise that you miss but later in the film you learn something that makes you go back and review.  I also like that other Jean Reno picture, 'the professional' I think it's called, which is why I watched his later movie, which is available at Amazon.  By the way, Crimson Rivers has another title originally, and something I read elsewhere indicated it was a sequel of a film only released in France, but I haven't found out more.It's an entirely different genre, Action-Suspense-(& something I can't define), so I wouldn't venture so far as to say 'if you like Undone, you'll like Crimson' but with that in mind I do urge you to see it, if you like surprises and don't mind looking for them.",5,Without a doubt the best gay movie ever!

680202,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B00005RRJI,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 2]","Director S&eacute;bastien Lifshitz trusts in incomplete junctures, ruptured times and constant flashbacks to create a narrative line that encircles the most significant moments in the life of Mathieu, the protagonist. Without following habitual guidelines, the story begins a couple of years after the main events of the film, and through long flashbacks the viewers understand that Mathieu is hurtfully unraveling and that his boyfriend C&eacute;dric has already been confined to the past.At the very beginning of the film we learn that Mathieu has attempted to commit suicide, that he has no intention of continuing his relationship with C&eacute;dric and that, in spite of it all, once he leaves the hospital he will visit the beach in which the two of them met for the first time.But how exactly was that first encounter? The first flashback scenes are somehow cold and neutral, they follow the protagonist like in a documentary, without providing the audience with cause of concern or any real emotional binding: Summer is reduced to tediousness, to a routine in which the camera is fixated on Mathieu's daily affairs, we understand that besides swimming in the sea, smoking in his bedroom and jerking off in the bathroom there is not much going on in his life. When Mathieu is lying on the sand, the presence of another boy distracts him. After perusing each other at the beach, the two teenagers finally find the courage to meet. For Mathieu, this is his first homosexual experience, for C&eacute;dric (interpreted by St&eacute;phane Rideau, a most influential figure in contemporary French gay cinema) it isn't.There is an intense passion between these two youngsters. As they start spending more and more time together, and as things quickly progress into the realms of sex, soon Mathieu's relatives become suspicious. Mathieu's mother is deeply depressed and her son doesn't want to upset her by coming out of the closet. His sister, however, knows exactly what's going on from the beginning.If there is something singular in Lifshitz's treatment of gay characters is how natural it's for them to be faithful to their true nature. Here accepting homosexuality is never a big deal, revelations are never a dramatic scene and they never involve crying or excruciatingly painful dialogs. The real drama comes from the lack of a paternal figure, id est, the lack of fatherly authority. With a depressed mother that lives in a world of her own as a consequence of the pills she takes, and the complete absence of the father, Mathieu is free to do as he pleases. But he's never truly free, for freedom actually means an emancipation from fatherly figures, and such emancipation can never be possible if there are no fathers at all.For Jacques Lacan the 'nom de pere' was the law of the father; even when a single mother is raising her child, she will be able to summon the name of the father and invest herself with an authority that comes from that tautological figure that does not need to explain or justify, that needs only to say 'no because I say so'. Clearly Mathieu has an unresolved conflict with the man he never sees, the man that has also abandoned her mother when she needed him the most. Oh sure, he's working hard to provide for the family, and that seems to excuse him. But when Mathieu tells the truth about himself to everyone, he has no intentions of sharing that intimate admission with his father. If the father is absent, there is no authority, and because of that, Mathieu is confused.C&eacute;dric has a father but his relationship with him is distant. He's independent, and since his independence came at a great price, he has been able to surmount the need to obtain his father's approval; in fact, family is something he no longer craves for. When Mathieu and C&eacute;dric decide to live together in Nantes, all family ties are severed at once. But the unresolved Oedipal conflict will gravely distress Mathieu.The nonexistence of the father can be designated as a structural emptiness that would preserve the function of desire. For the neurotic, the 'lack' is commonly occupied by the demand, which on one hand protects against the enigma of the Other's desire, while at the same time preserves the 'emptiness' that is necessary for the function of desire -of course at the expense of dissatisfaction; after all every demand (which is always constituted by signifiers) is a false demand, a deceiving one (of course, it is the subject himself the first to be mislead). C&eacute;dric demands the unceasing presence of Mathieu but he does not ask kindly for it; Mathieu's original plans were to return to Paris, but faces now a disjunctive, if he obeys the demand he will only get dissatisfied but if he doesn't his relationship fails and the emptiness reappears. This demand cannot be satisfied as it echoes the emergence of the subject through the signifier: the function of the signifier requires the effacement of its own traces. In this case, the motivation to move to Nantes should have come from Mathieu and not from Cedric.After many flashbacks and prolepsis, we come to a moment in time in which everything else has been left behind. Some might say that this is a glimmer of hope as Mathieu might find another companion in Pierre (yet another fatherless individual). But if there is one final fundamental revelation is how the two young men are preoccupied as they see a child playing alone in the beach until they realize the father is in a car nearby. Whether we want it or not, fathers still play an important role in our lives and in the way in which we define ourselves; accepting them or opposing them, they are still the authority that we follow or defy, and without that authority, existential doubts might render us motionless.",4,"If what they really want is love, can sex be sufficient?",1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,5776,"['Director', 'S',

680203,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005RRJI,Benjamin,"[9, 10]","OK, I'll admit it. I rented it for the nudity. Done as a gay coming-of-age story, ""Come Undone"" seemed like a pleasant enough excuse to show some well-toned guys romping around together on a beach. So I popped the DVD in the player, and I did what I usually do with gay softcore (or with something I think is trying to pass itself off as gay softcore), which is to say that I went straight for the chapter searches and to find the film's most explicit scenes. (It's not something of character, but, c'mon, you know you've done it.)The scenes I jumped into, though as explicit as I'd hoped, left me wondering about the context of the film. As with most ambitious French films, ""Come Undone"" follows a non-linear plot where not everything that happens is explainable or explained away. When I stopped jumping from scene to scene, I started the film at the beginning, and I found ""Come Undone"" to be a somewhat complicated, resonant and smart film. I'm really glad I decided to watch the whole thing.The majority of the film is told in flashback. From the scenes that take place in the ""present,"" we can tell that the film's main character Mathieu is depressed, just out of an institution and reluctant to talk about what's happened with his first gay relationship, which involved a boy named Cedric.The film, sometimes without warning, flashes back and forth along the timeline of their relationship. We see how they met, with Cedric staring down Mathieu on the beach. We see their first dates, their first fights. We see Cedric telling Mathieu about his more colorful past as a gay man. We see him meeting Mathieu's family.Occasionally, these scenes frame what happened a year later, after Cedric and Mathieu's relationship, which we learn became serious, is over.The film leaves it for the audience to decide what happened between the two summers, hinting that Cedric and Mathieu's courtship and breakup will be more important to who Mathieu is than how the relationship went. I fought my urge, as an American moviegoer, to have more of the loose ends of the film tied up, and I found ""Come Undone"" to be ultimately rewarding.So watch it for one reason. Then watch it for another. You'll find it worthwhile either way.",4,The nudity is beautiful.

680207,A1M1WYRFPG4U3Q,B00005RRJI,D. Fair,"[21, 25]","It appears to me that many of the professional reviewers were expecting or thought this movie was about hard-core ""SEX"" or a ""gay sex movie."" They have entirely missed this film's point and have insulted the screenwriter and director if that is the case. This is a beautiful, very simply put film about a 19 year old's first love and coming of age into adulthood. The story progresses very nicely. We see Mathieu's emotional journey. Again, the film is about his first love -- and this first love is with another man. What I love is how comfortable the director makes this homosexuality, not ""sex crazed gay men"" as American sterotypes can go. In fact, Mathieu never even says once that he is gay (he only lightly confirms it when C&eacute;dric when asks if he's told his family yet). My point being, that this wasn't made to be a ""gay movie,"" but a profoundly quiet film about love.Cinematography was the poorest aspect. There were scenes where more camera angles were needed. Cinematography can greatly enhance a film's quality. The acting was really superb. Mathieu (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Elkam) is gifted with this nonchalant, casual acting that you don't see in many young actors (who want to shout emotions and be big and brazen). C&eacute;dric (St&eacute;phane Rideau) shows his vast acting experience well in a role that requires a ""veteran"" feeling. Throughout the whole film I felt nothing of a ""pushed to please"" Hollywood aspect. You either love it or it's not you're thing. A classic independent European film.This is a wonderful film I feel for uneducated unexposed Americans to see. Besides the graphic sexual scenes (there's tastefully enough), one really gets an objective view of male homosexuality. You know, not that it's shoved in your face, but something to only respectfully observe (and the fact that the two men are very good looking is always a plus).I find myself thinking about this film days after. I think I'm going to buy this (I rented it) because I feel I need to understand this film on more levels.

What I didn't expect (because I hadn't read the reviews) were the long, drawn-out, wordless interludes featuring a depressed Mathieu staring unendingly at something, and the completely unsatisfying and sudden ending.In a nutshell, the movie centers around Mathieu, an 18-year-old young man vacationing with his family at the beach. His family consists of his chronically depressed mother, his angry sister, and someone who may be their aunt, and no one is terribly happy with each other. Mathieu meets Cedric at the beach, and there is an instant spark between them. The two soon become intimate and then fall in love. The film shifts back and forth through about three different times in these peoples' lives, showing us what happened, and showing us (sort of) how they got there.There are a few fairly intense erotic scenes between Cedric and Mathieu, and, sadly, tho are the only real highlights of the film, unless you really, really enjoy the aforementioned angst-ridden staring-out-the-window sequences interspersed with family hostility and bitterness.The ending gives utterly no sense of closure, and the viewer is left wondering, &quot;why was I supposed to care about these people, and why did I just spend two hours of my life watching this crap?&quot;The special features aren't worth mentioning, either.

Come undone is rather a single story with three different timelines and the film unfoldes between the three. In my reviewes, I dont like to give away to much of the plot, and spoil the film for others, but it is a love story between Mathieu (the lead character) and Cedric (a real hottie) set in present day France. Mathieu's mother gave birth to a son with cancer and died after birth and the mother's health never fully recovers. His sister has issues too of her own and Mathieu's relationship with her is strained at best.

680214,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005RRJI,Grady Harp,"[17, 18]","'Presque Rien' ('Come Undone') is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director S&eacute;bastien Lifshitz (with the collaboration of writer St&eacute;phane Bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'Wild Side').  As we come to understand Lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable.  By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now, time passed, time reflective, time imagined, time alone - Lifshitz makes his tales more personal, involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses.  It takes a bit of work to key into his method, but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film.Mathieu (handsome and gifted J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Elkam) is visiting the seaside for a holiday, a time to allow his mother (Dominique Reymond) to struggle with her undefined illness, cared for by the worldly and wise Annick (Marie Matheron) and accompanied by his sister Sarah (Laetitia Legrix): their distant father has remained at home for business reasons.  Weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of Mathieu alone, looking depressed, riding trains, speaking to someone in a little recorder.  We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.While sunning at the beach Mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him, and we can feel Mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion.  The youth C&eacute;dric (St&eacute;phane Rideau) follows Mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction.  Soon C&eacute;dric approaches Mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession.  Mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking, rebuffs C&eacute;dric's public approaches, but continues to seek him out for consignations.  The two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship, so very necessary to understanding this story, is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes.  Yet as the summer wears on Mathieu, a committed student, realizes that C&eacute;dric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival.  It becomes apparent that C&eacute;dric is the Dionysian partner while Mathieu is the Apollonian one: in a telling time in architectural ruin Mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while C&eacute;dric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking.Mathieu is a complex person, coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father, a fear of his burgeoning sexuality, and his nascent passion for C&eacute;dric. Their moments of joy are disrupted by C&eacute;dric's admission of infidelity and Mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways.  Time passes, family changes are made, and Mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt.  The manner in which Mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace, strangely enough, in one of  C&eacute;dric's past lovers Pierre (Nils Ohlund) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax.After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful.  Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion, conflicts with passion's powers found in love, and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful. The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative.  Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of filmmaking.  In French with English subtitles.  Highly Recommended.

This is a typical French movie in the way of dialogue, content, and direction, but never the less it is amazingly real. Come Undone is not a movie for those that are seeking the regular garbage that comes out of Hollywood.This is a unique movie in that it is simple and cleverly portrays sexuality between two young males in the real world.The movie starts off slow and dialogue in some scenes is non existent, but picks up from there on. I could not take my eyes off the screen as the movie reflects life the way it is without all that glamour and fantasy that comes out of Hollywood. Another reason why I couldn't take my eys off the screen was because the two male leads are DREAMY and HOT! Both actors did their part well and are definitely worth watching, especialy during the intimate moments between the two. It must be admitted that most people that enjoy or will enjoy watching this movie is for no more than to see the scenes depicting the two male stars nude and Jeremie Elkaim in an intimate moment in the bathroom playing with his....The movie is excellent! Dialogue and plot are simple but neatly delivered thanks to the clever direction and performances that are given by the two leading lads. The end of the movie leaves you wondering but it is good for it leaves you to determine a suitable ending.

Nothing is pat.This is a movie that treats it characters (and the audience) with a respect one rarely sees in gay themed movies (one need only compare this movie with simplistic dreck like ""The Broken Hearts Club"" to understand the difference between respecting your audience versus pandering to it).This film makes you focus on a young man who is dealing not just with his nascent homosexuality but also serious family issues and a lack of direction in his own life.

The story is told in a challenging non-linear style which requires some thought from the viewer. The lead actors are superb. Elkaim delivers a heartbreaking performance, and Rideau brings a bold charisma and sexual energy to his role. The two are ably supported by an excellent supporting cast; Violeta Ferrer is a particular standout with her warm, earthy performance as another young man's mother.The filmmakers achieve a spellbinding visual poetry in many of the film's scenes. The use of tight close-up shots creates a real feeling of intimacy between viewer and characters....Throughout the film are some intriguing symbolic touches; particularly powerful is the filmmaker's use of the beach as a setting in the story.

The use of flashbacks is not nearly as confusing as some reviewers here seemed to find it.  To assist viewers who might otherwise become lost, the film uses different seasons and different color palettes for the two main time-frames (warm summer colors for summer, cool more wintry colors for winter).  If that's not enough, the main character wears a heavy neck-scarf during the winter scenes.  Short of including subtitles giving the dates and locations of each scene, the director did everything he could to make it clear where and when the events took place.The acting is excellent, and even the secondary characters (the mother, her friend, the sister) are convincing. The cinematography is also outstanding.  As for the story, it is certainly as believable as any other story of passionate first love.  I especially liked the playfulness of the two main characters, because it helped to remind us that they are not that far from childhood and are just beginning to develop emotionally.While the issue of clinical depression does play a significant role in the film, I did not find the film itself to be depressing at all, but almost redemptive (though without a traditional happy ending).Video quality on the DVD is very good, as is the audio.

It essentially has 3 timelines and they all interchange, with no real defining of when the timeline has shifted. It takes a couple of minutes before you realize that you're looking at Mathieu dealing with depression, looking at Mathieu on the beach with Cedric, or looking at Mathieu getting to the point of dealing with his depression. You must pay attention or else you'll be confused. After getting used to the format, I was able to enjoy it much more, especially the 2nd time through.The majority of the story deals with Mathieu and his first gay affair with Cedric while on vacation. The realization of sexuality isn't portrayed with the typical anguish or guilt and revulsion; it's simply a realization. There are seemingly extraneous issues, Mathieu's mother and her depression and his revoltingly oppressive sister, but those issues become important when we witness Mathieu's own mental breakdown. Was it because of Cedric, Mathieu's dysfunctional family, the pain of coming out? If you're looking for answers, don't, because you won't get any. The story doesn't really have an end; the viewer is left to wonder about so many things and come to their own conclusions.For Americans, this is a very frustrating exercise because we expect stories with beginnings, middles, and ends. A haunting soundtrack and amazing cinematography enhance. Both actors in the lead roles are gorgeous; but, beware, there is quite a bit of graphic nudity and one really full-on sex scene.

680228,A15NLCXF69HL4M,B00005RRJI,Scott A. Humphries,"[5, 15]","Quick summary: don't waste your money on this dull flick, unless you are really keen to see the very attractive actors frolicking topless, and even then beware that there is only one (brief) sex scene - although it is quite a hot one.It is interesting that the last few years has seen an explosion in gay films on DVD. Not sure what has caused this, but rest assured quantity is not related to quality.This film is the story of two very handsome young man - a lean, long-limbed, very French looking guy and his boyfriend - a hunkier, very sexy number who many of us will recall from the excellent film ""Wild Reeds"". They meet in summer when both are very tanned and spending a lot of time on the beach.  They kiss and make love in very poorly lit scenes, and have one rather sexy romp in the sand dunes. Mostly off-camera, it all goes pear-shaped and the skinnier guy goes sort of crazy, develops pale skin and has a lot of very long Meaningful Close-Ups and other long pointless scenes to illustrate his unexplained and uninteresting depression.This is not a very good film, despite the appeal of the lead actors. It is just another disappointing film that has been attractively packaged to cash in on the obviously thriving ""gay genre"" DVD. Hardly anything happens in this movie, which is fine if the characters are interesting (and they are not). What does happen occurs mostly off-camera. The support actors are dull (especially the sour-faced anorexic sister). There are a couple of good scenes but they are so infrequent and hidden amongst such a huge amount of boring, pretentious filler that they lose their impact. The script is rambling, the editing  poor. In the hands of a good editor this could have been a good short film maybe, but as a feature it is a dull, overblown failure with delusions of artistic importance.Get ""Wild Reeds"" instead - a truly excellent film and starring the sexier half of the dup trying valiantly to save ""Come Undone.""",2,Beautiful men - boring film,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1959,"['Quick', 'summary', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'dull', 'flick', 'are', 'really', 'keen', 'see', 'very', 'attractive', 'actors', 'frolicking', 'topless', 'even', 'then', 'beware', 'only', 'one', 'brief', 'sex', 'scene', 'quite', 'hot', 'one.It', 'interesting', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'seen', 'explosion', 'gay', 'films', 'DVD', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'caused', 'rest', 'assured', 'quantity', 'not', 'related', 'quality.This', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'very', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'lean', 'long-limbed', 'very', 'French', 'looking', 'guy', 'boyfriend', 'hunkier', 'very', 'sexy', 'number', 'who', 'many', 'will', 'recall', 'excellent', 'film', 'Wild', 'Reeds', 'meet', 'summer', 'when', 'are', 'very', 'tanned', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'beach', 'kiss', 'make', 'love', 'very', 'poorly', 'lit', 'scenes', 'have', 'one', 'rather', 'sexy', 'romp', 'sand', 'dunes', 'Mostly', 'off-camera', 'pear-shaped', 'skinnier', 'guy', 'sort', 'crazy', 'pale', 'skin', 'lot', 'very', 'long', 'Meaningful', 'Close-Ups', 'other', 'long', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'illustrate', 'unexplained', 'uninteresting', 'depression.This', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'appeal', 'lead', 'actors', 'just', 'disappointing', 'film', 'been', 'attractively', 'packaged', 'cash', 'obviously', 'thriving', 'gay', 'genre', 'DVD', 'Hardly', 'anything', 'movie', 'fine', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'not', 'What', 'happen', 'occurs', 'mostly', 'off-camera', 'support', 'actors', 'are', 'dull', 'especially', 'sour-faced', 'anorexic', 'sister', 'are', 'couple', 'good', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'infrequent', 'hidden', 'amongst', 'huge', 'amount', 'boring', 'pretentious', 'filler', 'lose', 'impact', 'script', 'rambling', 'editing', 'poor', 'hands', 'good', 'editor', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'short', 'film', 'maybe', 'feature', 'dull', 'overblown', 'failure', 'delusions', 'artistic', 'importance.Get', 'Wild', 'Reeds', 'instead', 'truly', 'excellent', 'film', 'starring', 'sexier', 'half', 'dup', 'trying', 'valiantly', 'save', 'Come', 'Undone']",Come Undone

Unfortunately(and fortunately)it was one that I hadn't seen.  Unfortunately the beginning is very slow paced with little time spent on building character in the main actor(s).  I began to wonder if I wanted to spend 2 hours at this pace.  But, like an old car entering a freeway ramp (not being able to keep up with newer models)the pace builds.  Eventually, the story begins to unfold and turns out to be interesting.  The symbolism (between cat and character-see other reviews)wasn't obvious.  After reading other reviews I can go back and watch Come Undone with a fresh perspective.  I was disappointed in the ending- pretty abrupt. As a north american I'm always amazed at how french dialouge never beat around the bush when it comes to discussing gay issues.
