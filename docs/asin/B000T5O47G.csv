But movies this stupid aren't often as funny as this one. I should have been more generous with the star rating, as I  doubt they intended this to be taken seriously. If you take it too seriously, you will be bitterly disappointed. But any movie that features Larry The Cable Guy has a stamp on it.But despite the names of Engvall and ""Larry,"" the real show stealer is DJ Qualls. This guy's a mess, a real train-wreck. Yes, he's the stereotypical trigger-happy clueless American, but what people don't understand, is it is an intentional low-brow comedy which relies on insensitivity and stereotypes. Hence the hard-drinking Mexicans, the over-the-top ""No Closet Can Hold Me"" gay nephew of the town thug, the thug himself, and the beer-guzzling ""redneck"" Americans. Lighten up, people, it's just a silly movie.And to all you politically correct busybodies, who still want to subject yourself to politically incorrect misery, that of the right to personal expression, go to ""Features"" and watch the interview with Lisa Lampanelli, the ""Queen Of Mean."" As Mencia often says, ""...FREE SPEECH, BABY!!!"" My god, get a sense of humor...Also in the features, one sees how Danny Trejo got into acting. He is often typecast in bad guy roles, but as he says here, he has done time in every California penitentiary at one time or another. He lost nine years of his life to prison sentences. Coming to the point where he said to himself, ""enough is enough,"" he finally did straighten himself out, and managed to break into films, as an extra at first. This isn't really relevant to the film, but ""Bonus Features"" never really are.Back to the movie at hand. The biggest laugh I had in watching this was from a very short clip, only a few seconds at most. At one hour, eight minutes, forty-two seconds, Qualls left me on the floor with a noise he made. Some sounds can do this, in this case, a scream. But it killed me. I don't know, it is just one of those things. And of course, there is juvenile toilet humor, Larry's catch-phrase: ""...Git'r done..."" and a lot of, as I said earlier, stupidity. But keep in mind it is just a silly movie, a ""Farce,"" if you will, and you won't hate it so much.",3,"Somewhere between three and four stars, STUPID is rarely this funny",1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,2258,"['First', 'let', 'make', 'one', 'point', 'clear', 'THISIS', 'STUPID', 'MOVIE', 'God', 'stupid', 'movies', 'stupid', 'are', ""n't"", 'often', 'as', 'funny', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'generous', 'star', 'rating', 'doubt', 'intended', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'will', 'be', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'stamp', 'it.But', 'names', 'Engvall', 'Larry', 'real', 'show', 'stealer', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'guy', 'mess', 'real', 'train-wreck', 'Yes', 'stereotypical', 'trigger-happy', 'clueless', 'American', 'what', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'intentional', 'low-brow', 'comedy', 'insensitivity', 'stereotypes', 'Hence', 'hard-drinking', 'Mexicans', 'over-the-top', 'Closet', 'Can', 'Hold', 'Me', 'gay', 'nephew', 'town', 'thug', 'thug', 'beer-guzzling', 'redneck', 'Americans', 'Lighten', 'up', 'people', 'just', 'silly', 'movie.And', 'politically', 'correct', 'busybodies', 'who', 'still', 'want', 'subject', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'misery', 'right', 'personal', 'expression', 'go', 'Features', 'watch', 'interview', 'Lisa', 'Lampanelli', 'Queen', 'Mean', 'Mencia', 'often', 'FREE', 'SPEECH', 'BABY', 'My', 'god', 'get', 'sense', 'humor', 'Also', 'features', 'one', 'how', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'got', 'acting', 'often', 'typecast', 'bad', 'guy', 'roles', 'here', 'done', 'time', 'California', 'penitentiary', 'one', 'time', 'lost', 'nine', 'years', 'life', 'prison', 'sentences', 'Coming', 'point', 'where', 'said', 'enough', 'enough', 'finally', 'did', 'straighten', 'out', 'managed', 'break', 'films', 'extra', 'first', ""n't"", 'really', 'relevant', 'film', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'never', 'really', 'are.Back', 'movie', 'hand', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'had', 'watching', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'clip', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'most', 'one', 'hour', 'eight', 'minutes', 'forty-two', 'seconds', 'Qualls', 'left', 'floor', 'noise', 'made', 'sounds', 'can', 'do', 'case', 'scream', 'killed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'one', 'things', 'course', 'juvenile', 'toilet', 'humor', 'Larry', 'catch-phrase', 'Git', 'r', 'done', 'lot', 'said', 'earlier', 'stupidity', 'keep', 'mind', 'just', 'silly', 'movie', 'Farce', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hate', 'so', 'much']",N/A

1088452,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000T5O47G,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Somewhat of a disappointment to be totally honest.  I LOVE Larry the Cable Guy and I think he's one of the best stand up comedians when it comes to unpredictable and tricky jokes.  Somehow though, he wasn't particularly funny on Delta Farce.  Neither were most of the other characters (except that skinny guy- HE was funny).Even though the film is a disappointment, I still really loved it because it's just an outrageous style of humor that really cracks me up.  It's dumb humor, sure, but it's the kind of laughs that always immediately put me in a good mood.I'd say Larry's previous movie was better than this one though.The fact that the bad guy in the movie was called Carlos Santana was the funniest joke of all, haha.  I'm a big Santana fan (I LOVE his album Love, Devotion and Surrender that he did with John McLaughlin back in 1972) so any time his name is mentioned makes me happy.  Funny how the bad guy would say ""I'm Carlos Santana!"" and Larry the Cable Guy would go ""The singer?""  and he'd go ""NO, NOT THE SINGER!"" hahaThe way Larry the Cable Guy and his buddies saved a Mexican town (that they thought was a town in Iraq, LOL) and the way they found water were funny segments.  Much of the movie was about Larry and company saving a small Mexican town from a gang of bad guys.  They'd save the town and not realize they were doing it, lol.

I never really wanted to watch one of these movies as I figured they wouldn't be worth it. I was right. This movie isn't one of the worst I've seen, but it's still well below average.Bill, Larry, and Everett work for the army on the weekends. They never do anything but hang around the station by themselves. One day a Sergeant needs them to go into battle in Iraq. They are almost killed in training before they are put into a plane. They end up napping in the back of the plane and accidentally are ejected from the plane. They end up falling in what they think is Iraq. You soon discover that they have landed in Mexico. The Sergeant seems to have died and they need to survive. They make their way to a local city and fight off what they think are terrorists. They do turn out to be terrorists, but only on the small Mexican city. They become heroes and are expected to fend off any other attacks.Bill is the same character he is in real life. He is just a normal guy. Larry is a toned down version of what you see on television. Larry actually acts like the sane one in the group and is the guy who gets the girl. Everett is a trigger-happy man. He is usually the man to mess things up for everyone. Everett is really the only character with something interesting about him. The Sergeant is just an over acting monster that isn't really as funny as you'd want.The movie itself isn't all that funny. Some parts here and there are amusing, but nothing really funny.

Meaning there in the army, but only on the weekends, where they bum around and have no military experience what-so-ever. There pretty much the lowest rank of ranks for the US Army.They end up receiving orders to take on a mission in Iraq that the real army does not want to waste real troops on, so they have scraped the bottom of the barrel to send in these guys.They meet there new drill sergeant who is the guy from Men At Work, almost playing the same character he did in that, and they find themselves on a plane heading to Iraq.However these three dopes end up trying to sleep in a military vehicle on the plane, and the Sargent looks for them as the plane hit's bad weather and the pilot end's up lightning the load by dropping the vehicle and the 4 guy's out of the plane, not knowing they are in the vehicle sleeping.When they awaken, they think they are in Iraq, but they are actually in Mexico. They then find themselves helping out a small Mexican village free itself from a group of Bandits and there leader, Carlos Santana. Not the singer, he's a banditto.::Review::Overall, this is very much a ""seen it before"" situation. Nothing is new, and to be honest, the comedy is not all there. It tries to swing to a more adult audience in some scenes, but for the most part, if they cut out the cuss words, this is a PG rated movie.They really needed to find the balance of which direction to go with it. Should it have been a PG rated family comedy, or let Larry and Bill ad lib and make it a more adult scenario movie.I think most people like myself expected a lot more of the Blue Collar dirty humor to it. But it just did not deliver much of the memorable quotes for a comedy movie.They may have had a lot of fun making this movie, but honestly, the dweeby guy does not seem to fit in this thing. His character is a nutcase red neck, obsessed with shooting a gun and blowing things up, but they start off picking on him and making him the rear end of jokes, then it's barely there, then it's back... they really needed to expand that character more or make better jokes at his expense, and constituently.There is probably a heap more you could say could have improved this film, but I won't bother going into it, the movies done, printed and released.. so it's not like there going to remake it any time soon.::: Bonus Features :::It's packed with extra features. A featurette, boring deleted scenes, boring outtakes, and a couple more interviews with cast members. Some ok, some boring, some interesting and some annoying. The best one was hearing how Danny Trejo went from a life of crime to an actor.Also Jeff Dunham makes a small appearance in this film and his interview is always entertaining to see Walter and the Halipino on a Shtick.:::Overall:::Rental at the most, the die hard fans may want to purchase it with no questions asked, but I'd recommend renting it.

Unaware of the mix-up, the trio, believing at first that they are actually in Iraq, wind up fighting against some local gangsters who are terrorizing the inhabitants of a small rural village.As written by Bear Aderhold and Tom Sullivan and directed by C. B. Harding, ""Delta Farce"" is riddled with wheezy plot mechanics, tired lowbrow humor, and insulting stereotypes of gays and Mexicans, the latter of whom are portrayed as either gold-toothed, moustache-twirling banditos or backward children who not only cannot defend themselves against the bad guys but must rely on good old American ingenuity and know-how to get even the simplest menial task accomplished.  This is especially offensive given that these American heroes are not too many DNA strands away from being certifiable idiots themselves.  None of this would really matter so much if the movie itself had managed to be funny.  As it is, however, this is about as thoroughly witless and lame-brained a comedy as has come our way in a long long time.The moviemakers end on a sobering note, dedicating the film to the real military men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.
