883221,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0007N1ALI,Dorrie Wheeler,"[7, 8]","If you are a fan of the game of poker you will surely enjoy World Poker Tour-Season Two.  The show comes on the travel channel.  The major players have their only little quirky personalities, like Phil Ivey who is known for wearing sweatshirts and sweat pants to the table.  The announcers have little quips and jokes to provide fodder as the game play takes place.  The stakes are very high.  The World Poker Tour succeeds because it gives the viewers a front row seat to these high stakes games. The set is a whopping 8 discs.  This set would make the perfect gift for a poker fan, or hey Father's Day is coming up too. The set includes episodes from various locations including Aruba, on ships and several episodes taped at various casinos in Nevada and California among other locals.  The extras are interesting.  The player profiles give the viewers insight into the players who you don't really see talk when they are at the table.  The featurette ""Poker Takes Over Hollywood: A look at Hollywood's fascination with poker,"" takes a look at how some of Hollywood's popular actors are into the game of poker.  This set is priced less than season one and you get just as much great poker action if not more with all the bonus material.  This is a wonderful DVD set for someone who likes the shows, loves the game of poker, or wants to learn more about poker.",5,Great Set for Poker Fans,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,1361,"['are', 'fan', 'game', 'poker', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'World', 'Poker', 'Tour-Season', 'Two', 'show', 'travel', 'channel', 'major', 'players', 'have', 'only', 'little', 'quirky', 'personalities', 'Phil', 'Ivey', 'who', 'known', 'wearing', 'sweatshirts', 'sweat', 'pants', 'table', 'announcers', 'have', 'little', 'quips', 'jokes', 'provide', 'fodder', 'game', 'play', 'place', 'stakes', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'World', 'Poker', 'Tour', 'viewers', 'front', 'row', 'seat', 'high', 'stakes', 'games', 'set', 'whopping', '8', 'discs', 'set', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'gift', 'poker', 'fan', 'Father', 'Day', 'coming', 'up', 'too', 'set', 'episodes', 'various', 'locations', 'including', 'Aruba', 'ships', 'several', 'episodes', 'taped', 'various', 'casinos', 'Nevada', 'California', 'other', 'locals', 'extras', 'are', 'interesting', 'player', 'profiles', 'give', 'viewers', 'insight', 'players', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'talk', 'when', 'are', 'table', 'featurette', 'Poker', 'Takes', 'Hollywood', 'look', 'Hollywood', 'fascination', 'poker', 'look', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'popular', 'actors', 'are', 'game', 'poker', 'set', 'priced', 'less', 'season', 'one', 'get', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'great', 'poker', 'action', 'not', 'more', 'bonus', 'material', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'set', 'someone', 'who', 'shows', 'game', 'poker', 'learn', 'more', 'poker']",N/A

883224,A2FSEGZDAONS2U,B0007N1ALI,Movie Madman,"[13, 14]","Like most of us who enjoy poker, if it is on, I am watching.  Season 2 of the World Poker Tour was the most exciting, as prize pools escalated to record numbers. You get all of the exciting tournaments to watch anytime you like.  I have watched all of the DVDs over a dozen times and they are still fun to watch. My favorite BONUS in this DVD set is the added commentary in 4 of the tournaments, 2 with Daniel Negreanu and Erick Lindgren and 2 with Antonio ""the magician"" Esfandiari and Phil ""the unabomber"" Laak.  The insights of these 4 professionals are worth the price of the entire set. Let's hope they do this in the 3rd season DVD set...hopefully in more of the tournaments too.The only downside is the 8th DVD is just some poker tips and player profiles. It was not that great, but that is being really picky because also on the 8th DVD is an aftermath review of the WPT champuionship where Daniel Negreanu, Annie Duke, and Phil Hellmuth break down why the losers lost, how the winner won, and the tells, body language, and mental breakdowns that occurred throughout the game.This dvd set is the best I will buy this year unless season 3 comes out this year.  I do not see how a poker fan would be disappointed.  The final tables in season 2 were loaded with the greatest players ever to sit at a table and you get to sit there with them and look at their cards, judge their decisions, and root for your favorites, what could be better??Hope this helped some of you.",5,Poker Entertainment,1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,1474,"['most', 'who', 'enjoy', 'poker', 'am', 'watching', 'Season', '2', 'World', 'Poker', 'Tour', 'was', 'most', 'exciting', 'prize', 'pools', 'escalated', 'record', 'numbers', 'get', 'exciting', 'tournaments', 'watch', 'anytime', 'have', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'dozen', 'times', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'favorite', 'BONUS', 'DVD', 'set', 'added', 'commentary', '4', 'tournaments', '2', 'Daniel', 'Negreanu', 'Erick', 'Lindgren', '2', 'Antonio', 'magician', 'Esfandiari', 'Phil', 'unabomber', 'Laak', 'insights', '4', 'professionals', 'are', 'price', 'entire', 'set', 'Let', 'hope', 'do', '3rd', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'hopefully', 'more', 'tournaments', 'only', 'downside', '8th', 'DVD', 'just', 'poker', 'tips', 'player', 'profiles', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'being', 'really', 'picky', 'also', '8th', 'DVD', 'aftermath', 'review', 'WPT', 'champuionship', 'where', 'Daniel', 'Negreanu', 'Annie', 'Duke', 'Phil', 'Hellmuth', 'break', 'down', 'why', 'losers', 'lost', 'how', 'winner', 'won', 'tells', 'body', 'language', 'mental', 'breakdowns', 'occurred', 'game.This', 'dvd', 'set', 'best', 'will', 'buy', 'year', 'season', '3', 'out', 'year', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'poker', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'final', 'tables', 'season', '2', 'were', 'loaded', 'greatest', 'players', 'ever', 'sit', 'table', 'get', 'sit', 'look', 'cards', 'judge', 'decisions', 'root', 'favorites', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'Hope', 'helped']",N/A
