1185619,A3PZR5NI1EGMP1,B001ECDVIG,"A. Cooper ""possum""","[3, 4]","I've seen WWDIS three times, and I'm giving it four stars. This is why:The first star is for tenacity. This movie took something like ten years to make, years of believing in the project, searching for funding, not taking 'no' for an answer -- and all done by outsiders to the movie system. That takes some balls, you know? So kudos to Roger Grossman and Michelle.The second star is for integrity. This is a labor of love. It isn't tainted by the exploitation that infected other punk movies from the past. It also helps that the original band members were apparently involved, to a degree, in the making of the film. But I would have liked to have seen more of the importance of Malissa in Darby's life, as well as Bosco.Third star goes to the acting, most particularly Bijou Phillips and Shane West. Nice job.Fourth star is for portraying the L.A. punk scene, period. Just as then it was ignored by the music industry, today it's apparently of little interest to the film industry. That's too bad, because the energy and originality of that time was amazing. The soundtrack, by the way, is terrific.The weaknesses:  the movie is too short (perhaps due to financial considerations), and I wish they had focused much more on what it must have been like to have been a young, closeted gay man in a scene that was becoming increasingly macho and intolerant. Darby also comes off in the film as a sort of generic, misunderstood rebel... it would have been truer and more affecting to see the darker, more insecure and controlling side of Darby.Look, if you love the Germs music, you should definitely see this movie. If you're curious about the L.A. punk scene, see this movie. For further info, I'd recommend the book Lexicon Devil, and if you can find a copy of The Decline of Western Civilization (Part 1), do so. And of course, buying the Germs album. I think a lot of Darby's secrets are answered in his lyrics.",4,What We Do Is Secret,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,1913,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'WWDIS', 'three', 'times', ""'m"", 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'why', 'first', 'star', 'tenacity', 'movie', 'took', 'something', 'ten', 'years', 'make', 'years', 'believing', 'project', 'searching', 'funding', 'not', 'taking', ""'no"", 'answer', 'done', 'outsiders', 'movie', 'system', 'balls', 'know', 'So', 'kudos', 'Roger', 'Grossman', 'Michelle.The', 'second', 'star', 'integrity', 'labor', 'love', ""n't"", 'tainted', 'exploitation', 'infected', 'other', 'punk', 'movies', 'past', 'also', 'original', 'band', 'members', 'were', 'apparently', 'involved', 'degree', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'importance', 'Malissa', 'Darby', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'Bosco.Third', 'star', 'acting', 'most', 'particularly', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'Shane', 'West', 'Nice', 'job.Fourth', 'star', 'portraying', 'L.A.', 'punk', 'scene', 'period', 'Just', 'then', 'was', 'ignored', 'music', 'industry', 'today', 'apparently', 'little', 'interest', 'film', 'industry', 'too', 'bad', 'energy', 'originality', 'time', 'was', 'amazing', 'soundtrack', 'way', 'terrific.The', 'weaknesses', 'movie', 'too', 'short', 'perhaps', 'due', 'financial', 'considerations', 'wish', 'had', 'focused', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'been', 'young', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'scene', 'was', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'macho', 'intolerant', 'Darby', 'also', 'off', 'film', 'sort', 'generic', 'misunderstood', 'rebel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'truer', 'more', 'affecting', 'see', 'darker', 'more', 'insecure', 'controlling', 'side', 'Darby.Look', 'love', 'Germs', 'music', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'movie', ""'re"", 'curious', 'L.A.', 'punk', 'scene', 'see', 'movie', 'further', 'info', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'book', 'Lexicon', 'Devil', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'Decline', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'Part', '1', 'do', 'so', 'course', 'buying', 'Germs', 'album', 'think', 'lot', 'Darby', 'secrets', 'are', 'answered', 'lyrics']",What We Do Is Secret

1185621,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B001ECDVIG,Doug Anderson,"[4, 5]","I liked punk back in the late 1970's but since I didn't live in LA I never had the chance to actually see a live Germs show. I have seen The Decline of Western Civilization as well as plenty of other Germ performances on video which of course isn't quite the same thing as seeing a live Germs show but its probably as close as most of us will come to seeing and feeling what punk in all of its filth and fury was all about.The godfathers of punk were Lou Reed and David Bowie and Iggy Pop. LA punk was a fusion of these artist's attitudes and styles. It may seem to all have happened spontaneously but of course it was supposed to seem that way. In actuality punk was just as theatrical as a Lou Reed or David Bowie show. Reed and Bowie shows provided a venue for self-expression and punk shows were the same way. For most punks it was just plain fun to dress up in outrageous costumes and play or attend gigs. But for the hardcore punks like Darby Crash it was more than just dressing up and having a larf.Whats sad is that Darby Crash was very funny in real life but had very little sense of humor when it came to performing. For Crash performance was a kind of validation and crowd approval was something that he couldn't live without. Unfortunately Crash made his reputation with destructive behavior and the crowd wanted to see destruction every night. And Crash aimed to please.This film is very good at making the punk scene look like fun. It cleverly casts a very likable actor to play Darby Crash (Shane West looks like Ewan MacGregor) and equally likable actors to play band members (Bijou Phillips is especially enjoyable as the high-spirited and quirky gum smacking ""Lorna Doom""). And most of the film really just feels like a bunch of kids having a good time playing music and creating good punk theatre. And I think for many this is enough to make the film worth their while. However, the film is less successful when addressing the specifics of Crash's motivations, ambitions, his ambiguous sexuality, and his lyrics. Though enjoyable the movie just kind of glosses over these substantive issues and so the ending comes as just as much of a shock to us (even though we know its coming) as it does to fellow band members.If you don't expect it to be a genuine punk artifact (which it isn't) you might be entertained.",3,I'm Not a Commodity (or maybe I am),1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,2330,"['liked', 'punk', 'back', 'late', '1970', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'LA', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'actually', 'see', 'live', 'Germs', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'Decline', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'as', 'well', 'plenty', 'other', 'Germ', 'performances', 'video', 'course', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'thing', 'seeing', 'live', 'Germs', 'show', 'probably', 'as', 'close', 'most', 'will', 'come', 'seeing', 'feeling', 'what', 'punk', 'filth', 'fury', 'was', 'about.The', 'godfathers', 'punk', 'were', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'LA', 'punk', 'was', 'fusion', 'artist', 'attitudes', 'styles', 'may', 'seem', 'have', 'happened', 'spontaneously', 'course', 'was', 'supposed', 'seem', 'way', 'actuality', 'punk', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'theatrical', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'David', 'Bowie', 'show', 'Reed', 'Bowie', 'shows', 'provided', 'venue', 'self-expression', 'punk', 'shows', 'were', 'same', 'way', 'most', 'punks', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'dress', 'up', 'outrageous', 'costumes', 'play', 'attend', 'gigs', 'hardcore', 'punks', 'Darby', 'Crash', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'dressing', 'up', 'having', 'larf.Whats', 'sad', 'Darby', 'Crash', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'humor', 'when', 'came', 'performing', 'Crash', 'performance', 'was', 'kind', 'validation', 'crowd', 'approval', 'was', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'Unfortunately', 'Crash', 'made', 'reputation', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'crowd', 'wanted', 'see', 'destruction', 'night', 'Crash', 'aimed', 'please.This', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'making', 'punk', 'scene', 'look', 'fun', 'cleverly', 'very', 'likable', 'actor', 'play', 'Darby', 'Crash', 'Shane', 'West', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'equally', 'likable', 'actors', 'play', 'band', 'members', 'Bijou', 'Phillips', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'high-spirited', 'quirky', 'gum', 'smacking', 'Lorna', 'Doom', 'most', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'feels', 'bunch', 'kids', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'playing', 'music', 'creating', 'good', 'punk', 'theatre', 'think', 'many', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'while', 'However', 'film', 'less', 'successful', 'when', 'addressing', 'specifics', 'Crash', 'motivations', 'ambitions', 'ambiguous', 'sexuality', 'lyrics', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'just', 'kind', 'glosses', 'substantive', 'issues', 'so', 'ending', 'as', 'just', 'much', 'shock', 'even', 'know', 'coming', 'fellow', 'band', 'members.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'genuine', 'punk', 'artifact', ""n't"", 'might', 'be', 'entertained']",What We Do Is Secret

1185623,A25ZY9U8G74AX9,B001ECDVIG,James W. Harris,"[1, 1]","Exciting and inspiring and fast-paced look at the creation and dissolution of a legendary punk band.Darby Crash was a screwed-up kid who nevertheless had vision and drive, and he hooked up with people talented and crazy enough to help him bring his dream to life. The Germs started with nothing, and despite that just went out and slapped the world hard upside the head with the sound and fury they created. That's the central message here.What cool and maybe even world-changing thing do you want to do, but aren't doing? Maybe this movie will inspire you to do it.The Germs knew they didn't need anybody's permission or approval or certification, and neither do you. And maybe Darby's screwed-up personal life and tragic stupid death can be instructive, too.The director's commentary is quite interesting; it shows how DIY this film was, how it was a labor of love for all involved, and how the director, like the Germs themselves, didn't let anything stop him from bringing his vision to the world.Of course this isn't the complete Germs story. It's a great snapshot, taken from a particular point of view.

1185629,A10W40DOIE1EOP,B001ECDVIG,Zelie Nic,"[5, 5]","First, I'm not going to pretend that I was around LA when all of this went down... I was in New Orleans, and I didn't really get into punk until 1980 or '81, when Black Flag came through. Darby Crash was already dead by then, so I never knew him, met him, or even saw the Germs.  With that said,  the fact that the surviving Germs are happy with Shane West and ""What We Do is Secret"" is enough for me.I'll be honest though, I would've liked to have seen some more of the earlier years.  Show some more of the time spent at IPS (read ""Lexicon Devil"").  I think that the film does try to project the complicated person that Crash appears to have been.  I do think it comes off short though, perhaps because of the fact that the film itself clocks in around an hour and a half.The list of people involved in the making of this film is impressive.  It is a who's who of punk in Los Angeles.  This, coupled with the input of the Germs and their immediate circle suggest that the film was credible.What surprised me though was how many of the scenes of turmoil within the band seemed cliche.  I've no doubt it was, but it still surprised me.The documentary/ bio-epic presentation is interesting.  I wonder why Grossman decided to do it this way.  I don't know.  If this film had a larger budget and this is what they turned out I would rate this movie lower... but the fact of the matter is that this film had a small budget and took almost two decades to make.  This fact perhaps explains the relatively short length of ""What We Do is Secret"" as well as other shortcomings.I'm glad this film was completed.
