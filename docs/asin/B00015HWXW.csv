793610,AUHMTUKAYNM2P,B00015HWXW,Bonerus Viagrus,"[0, 6]","This film is true independent filmmaking.  Along with Troma.  This film is about a group of friends going up to one's cabin for the weekend.  At a bar, they pick up a woman, very attractive if I might say, and take her with them.  After a night of screwin', everyone gets laid!, one of them disappears.  It's fun to watch them blame eachother through the whole thing, it shows that they're only human.  Unlike some people who immediately jump to conclusions about the killers.  That's fun too, though.  Like FvJ.  They jumped to conclusions pretty quick, only 'cuz they had to trim the script to an hour and a half.  It's still the best movie ever! (FvJ I mean)  S.I.C.K. offers the fact that a killer clown cannibal lives in the woods, waiting for his next snacks/victims.  I wouldn't even suggest a clown is in the woods killing my friends.  Maybe now I will.  The movie is slow at times, but gives you sex, very hysterical dialogue if most people actually listen to it instead of fast forwarding, and also a clown who is very, very sick.  I saw the trailer of this on House of the Dead VHS after I rented it, but the store didn't have this.  The picture quality is genius, because most movies have people so lit up, you can see their expressions, even though they don't know where everyone else is.  It is very dark, like the movie.  It also made me wonder if the clown was hidden in the background, watching.  A common complaint is that the clown is seen putting on his make-up, but in the movie actually has a mask on.  It's 'cuz the clown was depicted in the story like a party clown, but in the movie, he is a cannibal who wears a clown mask.  The film builds up to the conclusion, which I suspected some of it, but there is one bit that I didn't even conceive.  The movie is not laden with gore, but is still pretty good when you actually see it.  The movie is worth renting, even if you don't like it, please fast forward to the end.  The end alone is worth a look.  My sister bought me a copy at a video store during it's sale of over 1000 titles, which was pretty much depleted!  There was only one copy, and I didn't see any left on the rental shelf either.  I think it was worth it because the movie is fun to watch.  Artisan is the only company taking big risks on horror films lately.  House of the Dead, S.I.C.K., and Cutthroat Alley (which I wanna see).  All of the other companies are going with the sure-things.  I love almost every horror movie I've ever seen.  The only one I hated was the Ring.  I call it a comedy.  I like mainstream horror, indie horror, and also the shoe-string budget horror.  I can only hope to make a movie that would get major distribution, but if I make one, I'm sending it to Artisan.  They might release it.  At least rent this because it's not just a sweet, super SWEET movie cover.  It's actually really creepy.  I will never think of Ring Around the Rosie the same way again.",5,A true independent film.,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,2927,"['film', 'true', 'independent', 'filmmaking', 'Troma', 'film', 'group', 'friends', 'going', 'up', 'one', 'cabin', 'weekend', 'bar', 'pick', 'up', 'woman', 'very', 'attractive', 'might', 'say', 'take', 'night', 'screwin', 'everyone', 'laid', 'one', 'fun', 'watch', 'blame', 'whole', 'thing', ""'re"", 'only', 'human', 'people', 'who', 'immediately', 'jump', 'conclusions', 'killers', 'fun', 'too', 'though', 'FvJ', 'jumped', 'conclusions', 'pretty', 'quick', 'only', 'had', 'trim', 'script', 'hour', 'half', 'still', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'FvJ', 'mean', 'S.I.C.K', 'fact', 'killer', 'clown', 'cannibal', 'woods', 'waiting', 'next', 'snacks/victims', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'suggest', 'clown', 'woods', 'killing', 'friends', 'Maybe', 'now', 'will', 'movie', 'slow', 'times', 'sex', 'very', 'hysterical', 'dialogue', 'most', 'people', 'actually', 'listen', 'instead', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'also', 'clown', 'who', 'very', 'very', 'sick', 'saw', 'trailer', 'House', 'Dead', 'VHS', 'rented', 'store', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'picture', 'quality', 'genius', 'most', 'movies', 'have', 'people', 'so', 'lit', 'up', 'can', 'see', 'expressions', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'everyone', 'else', 'very', 'dark', 'movie', 'also', 'made', 'wonder', 'clown', 'was', 'hidden', 'background', 'watching', 'common', 'complaint', 'clown', 'seen', 'putting', 'make-up', 'movie', 'actually', 'mask', 'clown', 'was', 'depicted', 'story', 'party', 'clown', 'movie', 'cannibal', 'who', 'clown', 'mask', 'film', 'conclusion', 'suspected', 'one', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'conceive', 'movie', 'not', 'laden', 'gore', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'actually', 'see', 'movie', 'worth', 'renting', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'please', 'fast', 'forward', 'end', 'end', 'alone', 'look', 'sister', 'bought', 'copy', 'video', 'store', 'sale', '1000', 'titles', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'depleted', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'copy', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'left', 'rental', 'shelf', 'either', 'think', 'was', 'worth', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'Artisan', 'only', 'company', 'taking', 'big', 'risks', 'horror', 'films', 'lately', 'House', 'Dead', 'S.I.C.K.', 'Cutthroat', 'Alley', 'wan', 'see', 'other', 'companies', 'are', 'going', 'sure-things', 'love', 'almost', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'hated', 'was', 'Ring', 'call', 'comedy', 'like', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'indie', 'horror', 'also', 'shoe-string', 'budget', 'horror', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'make', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'major', 'distribution', 'make', 'one', ""'m"", 'sending', 'Artisan', 'might', 'release', 'least', 'rent', 'not', 'just', 'sweet', 'super', 'SWEET', 'movie', 'cover', 'actually', 'really', 'creepy', 'will', 'never', 'think', 'Ring', 'Rosie', 'same', 'way', 'again']",S.i.c.k.

793619,A1EM1PEMH6OYDU,B00015HWXW,"J. Cook ""Scabboy""","[3, 3]","PLOTA group of friends plan a weekend trip to remote cabin in the woods. After they stop for beer and pick up a hitchhiker they drive to the desolate spot and start to party. Gathered around a campfire, the hitchhiker girl tells a story of a deranged cannibal clown killer. From that point on weird things start to happen and she becomes a suspect. When one of them come up missing, and no fingers point to her, they start to worry and wonder who is behind it all. When it becomes apparent that the story was more than a myth, and things are really happening the way the hitchhiker told, the real story comes out in a twist ending that makes everything make sense.Since I am a fan of (even very low budget) woods/camp slasher movies, I really wanted to check this out. It was a typical woods slasher-- nothing new here. We had sex, drugs, boobs and the over-used campfire scene. We had one pretty okay kill (a decapitation) and a pretty alright story behind the movie. The killer was big and intimidating, but that was about it. The location of the movie was great. One of the very few low-budget woods slashers that actually take place in a real cabin, and not in a tent in the woods. That being said, I really enjoyed the location and scenery. Finally, I must admit that the ending really surprised me, and I thought it made the movie worthwhile for me.Well, the movie had some really pungent acting. The girls were all pretty cute, but only 2 were unclothed. The gore, being very skimpy to begin with wasn't very well done. The only kill in the movie (well, onscreen kill) other than the death in the opening pre-credit scene was a head decapitation, which looked alright, but still wasn't very well done. The movie lacked kills and action. Most of the movie was the gang just hanging out, talking, arguing, getting high, or looking for their lost friend. The cast also kept mentioning the obvious-- to let us know they were not within range of getting help. ""Cell phones don't work"", We're 12 miles from civilization..."". I mean, c'mon, it's a slasher movie, we should already presume all of this. Lastly, why always a clown mask? Okay, we all get it. Some people are terrified of clowns, but it has already been done and it didn't work then. I just thought it was lame.I read a review of this movie in Fangoria, and I tell you I really never wanted to ever watch it. After having a few friends watch it and they said it was actually not bad, and on the same level as Camp Blood, Camp Utopia and Memorial Day,I figured I should check it out. All I could really think about was a rip-off of Camp Blood, which it was, and that movie was not very good at all. The opening scene wasn't very good, and the movie was shot on video, which gives that distinct ""home video"" look. That, itself wasn't too inviting. The lady was killed, and ""Food"" was wrote across her forehead, and the killer put clown make-up on her. That scene reminded me of the scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, when Leatherface was using that hand-held spelling game and a picture of a clown kept coming up, and he kept typing in ""FOOD"" and kept getting it wrong. I am quite sure it was ripped straight from that. Anyways, the movie was pretty slow in a lot of places, and the ending, even though I thought it was pretty alright really fell flat. I would recommend this movie to people who are a fan of low-budget movies, camp/woods slashers, and movies like Bloody Murder, Camp Blood, Camp Utopia and such. Otherwise, stay away from this.",2,"OKAY, I GET IT, CLOWNS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SCARY...",1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,3509,"['PLOTA', 'group', 'friends', 'plan', 'weekend', 'trip', 'remote', 'cabin', 'woods', 'stop', 'beer', 'pick', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'drive', 'desolate', 'spot', 'start', 'party', 'Gathered', 'campfire', 'hitchhiker', 'girl', 'story', 'deranged', 'cannibal', 'clown', 'killer', 'point', 'weird', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'suspect', 'When', 'one', 'come', 'up', 'missing', 'fingers', 'point', 'start', 'worry', 'wonder', 'who', 'When', 'apparent', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'myth', 'things', 'are', 'really', 'happening', 'way', 'hitchhiker', 'told', 'real', 'story', 'out', 'twist', 'ending', 'everything', 'make', 'sense.Since', 'am', 'fan', 'even', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'slasher', 'movies', 'really', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'typical', 'woods', 'slasher', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'had', 'sex', 'drugs', 'boobs', 'over-used', 'campfire', 'scene', 'had', 'one', 'pretty', 'okay', 'kill', 'decapitation', 'pretty', 'alright', 'story', 'movie', 'killer', 'was', 'big', 'intimidating', 'was', 'location', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'One', 'very', 'few', 'low-budget', 'woods', 'slashers', 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'real', 'cabin', 'not', 'tent', 'woods', 'being', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'location', 'scenery', 'Finally', 'must', 'admit', 'ending', 'really', 'surprised', 'thought', 'made', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'me.Well', 'movie', 'had', 'really', 'pungent', 'acting', 'girls', 'were', 'pretty', 'cute', 'only', '2', 'were', 'unclothed', 'gore', 'being', 'very', 'skimpy', 'begin', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'kill', 'movie', 'well', 'kill', 'other', 'death', 'opening', 'pre-credit', 'scene', 'was', 'head', 'decapitation', 'looked', 'alright', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'lacked', 'kills', 'action', 'Most', 'movie', 'was', 'gang', 'just', 'hanging', 'out', 'talking', 'arguing', 'getting', 'high', 'looking', 'lost', 'friend', 'cast', 'also', 'kept', 'mentioning', 'obvious', 'let', 'know', 'were', 'not', 'range', 'getting', 'help', 'Cell', 'phones', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', ""'re"", '12', 'miles', 'civilization', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'slasher', 'movie', 'should', 'already', 'presume', 'Lastly', 'why', 'always', 'clown', 'mask', 'Okay', 'get', 'people', 'are', 'terrified', 'clowns', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'then', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'lame.I', 'read', 'review', 'movie', 'Fangoria', 'tell', 'really', 'never', 'wanted', 'ever', 'watch', 'having', 'few', 'friends', 'watch', 'said', 'was', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'same', 'level', 'Camp', 'Blood', 'Camp', 'Utopia', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'figured', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'could', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'rip-off', 'Camp', 'Blood', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'video', 'distinct', 'home', 'video', 'look', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'inviting', 'lady', 'was', 'killed', 'Food', 'was', 'wrote', 'forehead', 'killer', 'put', 'clown', 'make-up', 'scene', 'reminded', 'scene', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'III', 'when', 'Leatherface', 'was', 'using', 'hand-held', 'spelling', 'game', 'picture', 'clown', 'kept', 'coming', 'up', 'kept', 'typing', 'FOOD', 'kept', 'getting', 'wrong', 'am', 'quite', 'sure', 'was', 'ripped', 'straight', 'Anyways', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'slow', 'lot', 'places', 'ending', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'alright', 'really', 'fell', 'flat', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fan', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'camp/woods', 'slashers', 'movies', 'Bloody', 'Murder', 'Camp', 'Blood', 'Camp', 'Utopia', 'such', 'Otherwise', 'stay', 'away']",S.i.c.k.
