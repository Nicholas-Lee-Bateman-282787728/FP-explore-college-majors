A double entendre on Three Rivers.  Alex O'Loughlin is great as the transplant surgeon.  I did however find a bunch of medical inaccuracies on the show.  #1 Dr Yablonsky would NEVER go to the ER to help.  Surgeons would come consult but do little else.  They have done CPR wrong (a lot of shows do) and listened to the heart on the wrong side of the chest.  Some of the labeled locations have pictures that are totally NOT those actual places.  (I laughed at the Portland, ME one.  It looks NOTHING like that!!!)  I have always loved medical dramas and it only slightly detracted for me (I am an RN)and I HIGHLY recommend watching this great show that was cancelled too soon.",5,Awesome show!

Alex O'Loughlin is perfectly cast as Dr. Andy Yablonski, and his hard work and study shows.  Alex is extremely passionate about this role, and has become an ambassador for Donate Life.Not only is Three Rivers informative and important in educating people about organ donations, but the writers are quickly weaving stories around the various characters, and making me more and more anxious to see each episode.  The entire cast is excellent, but I am glad to see that we are finding out more about Dr. Andy and his past and personal life.  A doctor with a dark past to deal with along with work that keeps him too busy to keep his marriage together makes for a fascinating hour.The writers have woven the three parts of this show so skillfully - the doctors, the donors and the families of the donors.  There is action to keep your attention the entire hour and it leaves you wanting more.  This show is touching, dramatic and has just the right touch of humor.Three Rivers has a very tough spot.  Where I live, the football on CBS has consistently pushed it later than many people want to watch TV on a Sunday night, with school and work the next day.  It has been on against football on NBC, and it even had the World Series to contend with on FOX.  This week, while I watched one of the best episodes yet, ABC was airing the AMAs - and again, football on NBC.  I am glad to see that CBS seems to be trying to give this marvelous show the chance that it so richly deserves, and I hope that they appreciate the show and the stellar cast enough to try airing it on another night during the week.I love Three Rivers. Alex O'Loughlin, as always, is brilliant - and I look forward to seeing much more.
