I also got Time Tunnel awhile back and it is fun to watch to. You can't go wrong with adding this to you DVD collection. Now I'm waiting for Land of the Giants to reduce in price and I'll get that next!

He mentioned he'd like to have the complete series and so for Christmas we sent it to him while he's serving in the middle east. He loves it as much now as then!

1229759,A3MQ15651KGVLJ,B001PR2186,Rick L. Parrish,"[0, 0]",Loved this show as a kid.  Do note that this is missing the final half season and you'll have to buy it separately but it is available here on amazon as well ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044XV7AQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6 ).  The series was a stalwart when I was a child and Admiral Nelson and Captain Crane were my heroes.  It's part cold war suspense and sci-fi fantasy fun rolled into one incredibly well done tv series.  The first season is in B/W but color thereafter and it features great writing with first class acting (essential if you're gonna sell this sort of story to adults too).  Plenty of guest stars too.  If you have fond memories of it from your childhood or just want to introduce it to your progeny you won't be disappointed and if you're a first time viewer rest easy knowing this one holds up all these years later when so many from the same era don't.Treat yourself!,5,Great Series From The Sixties And Holds Up Pretty Well 50 Years Later!!,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,900,"['Loved', 'show', 'kid', 'Do', 'note', 'missing', 'final', 'half', 'season', ""'ll"", 'have', 'buy', 'separately', 'available', 'here', 'amazon', 'as', 'well', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044XV7AQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6', 'series', 'was', 'stalwart', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Admiral', 'Nelson', 'Captain', 'Crane', 'were', 'heroes', 'part', 'cold', 'war', 'suspense', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'fun', 'rolled', 'one', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'tv', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'B/W', 'color', 'thereafter', 'great', 'writing', 'first', 'class', 'acting', 'essential', ""'re"", 'gon', 'sell', 'sort', 'story', 'adults', 'too', 'Plenty', 'guest', 'stars', 'too', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'childhood', 'just', 'want', 'introduce', 'progeny', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'rest', 'easy', 'knowing', 'one', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'same', 'era', ""don't.Treat""]","Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea - The First Three Seasons and Season 4, Part 1"
