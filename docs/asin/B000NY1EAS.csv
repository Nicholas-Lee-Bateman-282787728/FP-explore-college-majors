1061674,A10GLKTPF3MMUM,B000NY1EAS,"Andrew J. DiLiddo Jr. ""Big_Man_Big_Heart_Fine...","[2, 2]","I can watch this movie again and again.  Its difficult to say more than the previous reviewers.  I did not view this movie through a prism of ""anti-war"" genre as some reviewers above have.  I look at Benigni as the embodiment of joy and love.  The scene with his daughters in their bedroom with a bat flying around is not only hilarious, but, lovable. With a few gestures, Benigni depicts his love for the world and his daughters.  The girls sense his profundity and despite the hour and their recent trauma, they ask Dad how he became a poet.  Attilio, Benigni's character's answer to his two daughters is quintessential Benigni.The scene where Benigni/Attilio is lecturing on poetry to his university class is riveting.  I can view this scene again and again.  It is reminiscent of Giacomo Puccini's opera, La Boheme,Puccini - La Boh&egrave;me / Freni, Pavarotti, Harwood, Ghiaurov, Karajan""Che gelida manina "" (what a cold little hand) aria where Rodolfo describes his life to Mimi: "" I am a writer, I live, I write"".  Vittorio is a poeta, at one with the world in the same manner as Rodolfo.HOW FAR AND WIDE WOULD YOU GO for someone you truly love??Maybe a difficult question to answer but try answering in the context of how Attilio (Benigni) travels from Italy to Baghdad during the Iraq War to get to his love, Nicoletta Braschi (his wife in real life)  as Vittoria.  The travel scenes from Italy to Baghdad can be viewed as comedic when he joins up with the Red Cross in order to get into Baghdad. On a higher plane, Benigni depicts a man who is driven by a powerful love.  Benigni's acting when he tries to get a formula for home-made glycerine to treat  Vittoria's (Nicoletta Braschi's) cerebral edema is masterful.  He portrays a man who is so frustrated and impatient but at the same time knows he has to suppress these emotions in order to calm the wise Iraqi elder man to get the recipe for this life saving medicine. Some could critique the scenes around Nicoletta Braschi's hospital bed as formulaic Benigni.  As Attilio (Benigni) in desperation launches into a soliloquy of poetry describing his love for Vittoria to the Iraqi wise man, the monologue and the imagery is as beautiful as some operatic arias.  The elder Iraqi man is so taken with the beauty of Attilio's poetry, even though he cannot understand the language, that he relaxes and is able to recall the recipe for making homemade glycerin.His persona in those scenes is very similar to the nervous jovial character in the concentration camp in ""Life is Beautiful"".  Yes, the acting is similar as other reviewers here have detailed.  However, I DO NOT RECOMMEND you view this film as a comparative to ""Life is Beautiful"".  This film can stand on its own merit and I even haven't begun to discuss Jean Reno as Fouad or Nicoletta Braschi.",5,Poets and aspiring poets - a must see,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,2815,"['can', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'difficult', 'say', 'more', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'did', 'not', 'view', 'movie', 'prism', 'anti-war', 'genre', 'reviewers', 'have', 'look', 'Benigni', 'embodiment', 'joy', 'love', 'scene', 'daughters', 'bedroom', 'bat', 'flying', 'around', 'not', 'only', 'hilarious', 'lovable', 'few', 'gestures', 'Benigni', 'love', 'world', 'daughters', 'girls', 'sense', 'profundity', 'hour', 'recent', 'trauma', 'ask', 'Dad', 'how', 'became', 'poet', 'Attilio', 'Benigni', 'character', 'answer', 'two', 'daughters', 'quintessential', 'Benigni.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Benigni/Attilio', 'lecturing', 'poetry', 'university', 'class', 'riveting', 'can', 'view', 'scene', 'again', 'again', 'reminiscent', 'Giacomo', 'Puccini', 'opera', 'La', 'Boheme', 'Puccini', 'La', 'Boh', 'egrave', '/', 'Freni', 'Pavarotti', 'Harwood', 'Ghiaurov', 'Karajan', 'Che', 'gelida', 'manina', 'what', 'cold', 'little', 'hand', 'aria', 'where', 'Rodolfo', 'life', 'Mimi', 'am', 'writer', 'live', 'write', 'Vittorio', 'poeta', 'one', 'world', 'same', 'manner', 'Rodolfo.HOW', 'FAR', 'AND', 'WIDE', 'WOULD', 'YOU', 'GO', 'someone', 'truly', 'love', 'Maybe', 'difficult', 'question', 'answer', 'try', 'answering', 'context', 'how', 'Attilio', 'Benigni', 'Italy', 'Baghdad', 'Iraq', 'War', 'get', 'love', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'wife', 'real', 'life', 'Vittoria', 'travel', 'scenes', 'Italy', 'Baghdad', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'comedic', 'when', 'up', 'Red', 'Cross', 'order', 'get', 'Baghdad', 'higher', 'plane', 'Benigni', 'man', 'who', 'driven', 'powerful', 'love', 'Benigni', 'acting', 'when', 'get', 'formula', 'home-made', 'glycerine', 'treat', 'Vittoria', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'cerebral', 'edema', 'masterful', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'frustrated', 'impatient', 'same', 'time', 'suppress', 'emotions', 'order', 'calm', 'wise', 'Iraqi', 'elder', 'man', 'get', 'recipe', 'life', 'saving', 'medicine', 'could', 'critique', 'scenes', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'hospital', 'bed', 'formulaic', 'Benigni', 'Attilio', 'Benigni', 'desperation', 'launches', 'soliloquy', 'poetry', 'describing', 'love', 'Vittoria', 'Iraqi', 'wise', 'man', 'monologue', 'imagery', 'as', 'beautiful', 'operatic', 'arias', 'elder', 'Iraqi', 'man', 'so', 'taken', 'beauty', 'Attilio', 'poetry', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'language', 'relaxes', 'able', 'recall', 'recipe', 'making', 'homemade', 'glycerin.His', 'persona', 'scenes', 'very', 'similar', 'nervous', 'jovial', 'character', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'Yes', 'acting', 'similar', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'detailed', 'However', 'DO', 'NOT', 'RECOMMEND', 'view', 'film', 'comparative', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'merit', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'begun', 'discuss', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Fouad', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi']",The Tiger and the Snow

1061677,A2Z5XUM00YMDGA,B000NY1EAS,"Constantinos V. ""Constantinos V.""","[40, 43]","Watching this movie will inevitably remind you of Benigni's previous movie ""Life is beautiful"". Most probably it will not give you the same thrill since ""Life is beautiful"" is a masterpiece and it is such an inspired movie. I am sure that even Benigni does not expect to produce such a movie again.Still there are some common elements in these two movies. Benigni plays once more a funny character which is surrounded by extremely difficult circumstances. Yet he is focused on his goal (in this movie to rescue the woman he loves). And this time we get to see a much happier ending.  This movie also unfolds during a war which is taking place right now. This time the villains are not so easy to point out (like the ""Nazi's in Life is beautiful"") but the movie still describes how war brings misery to everyone involved, either these are the American troops, the residents of Baghdad or even members of humanitarian organizations and regardless from which side the fire comes. If anyone expects any political comments in the movie I think he will be disappointed. Benigni remains neutral and does not take sides on who is right and who is wrong in this war. This might disappoint some who would expect a political comment in this movie yet it will make it more attractive to broader audiences.I cannot also overlook Jean Reno's role in the movie. He plays an Arab poet. One of the best scenes of the movie is when he is looking at the starry sky of Baghdad with Attilio and he quotes some memorable poetry. I believe this is another role which Reno delivers in a superb way.Nicola Piovani's music also contributes to the atmosphere of the movie. He has worked with Benigni in many films and there is the right chemistry between his music and the scenes for which it is employed.In conclusion I would highly recommend this movie. When you get it do not expect to see another masterpiece like ""Life is beautiful"" because you will be disappointed. Yet prepare yourself for an entertaining movie with positive messages. If you have not seen ""Life is beautiful"" (you can check my review for this movie as well), see it AFTER you see this movie.

This story goes in a different direction, so direct comparison of the two films is probably unwarranted, but you have to like Roberto's personality to like either of them. Funny bits with everything from oxygen tanks to minefields to camels are involved here. Reminds me a bit of a Woody Allen production, sometimes finding humor in unlikely places. There is one part of this film which does not segueway well, at all-it goes from very early in their relationship, to what apparently is much later, and Nicoletta ends up in Baghdad without much explanation, either. One word of warning: If you do not like singer Tom Waits, don't even think about buying this DVD. I actually like him, but they just about beat one of his songs to death in this film. You hear it early on, then maybe 5 minutes later, then maybe 30 minutes later (I didn't time it, just guessing), then again later. Personally I don't have that much tolerance for any song, even a good one, the song almost ruined the film for me. I understand there being a theme song, as there are in many movies, but this was just a bit too repetitive. The end of this movie leaves you wondering about a couple of things, and about what happens later, it could go either of two ways after we see our hero depart, we don't really know what happens, but I think about every viewer will agree on what they would like to happen.",4,Roberto and Nicoletta again,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,1508,"['liked', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'La', 'Vita', 'E', 'Bella', 'will', 'probably', 'here', 'again', 'wife', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'story', 'different', 'direction', 'so', 'direct', 'comparison', 'two', 'films', 'probably', 'unwarranted', 'have', 'like', 'Roberto', 'personality', 'Funny', 'everything', 'oxygen', 'tanks', 'minefields', 'camels', 'are', 'involved', 'here', 'bit', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'production', 'sometimes', 'finding', 'humor', 'unlikely', 'places', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'not', 'segueway', 'well', 'all-it', 'very', 'early', 'relationship', 'what', 'apparently', 'much', 'later', 'Nicoletta', 'up', 'Baghdad', 'much', 'explanation', 'either', 'One', 'word', 'warning', 'do', 'not', 'singer', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'buying', 'DVD', 'actually', 'just', 'beat', 'one', 'songs', 'death', 'film', 'hear', 'early', 'then', 'maybe', '5', 'minutes', 'later', 'then', 'maybe', '30', 'minutes', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'time', 'just', 'guessing', 'then', 'again', 'later', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'tolerance', 'song', 'even', 'good', 'one', 'song', 'almost', 'ruined', 'film', 'understand', 'there', 'being', 'theme', 'song', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'repetitive', 'end', 'movie', 'wondering', 'couple', 'things', 'what', 'later', 'could', 'go', 'either', 'two', 'ways', 'see', 'hero', 'depart', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'viewer', 'will', 'agree', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'happen']",The Tiger and the Snow

It is incredibly strong on fantasy, whimsy, and romance, but the screenplay is also quite intelligent and has some funny commentary on psychoanalysis, poetry, and literary criticism.  I haven't seen ""Life is Beautiful"" but apparently Mr. Benigni's special talent is taking a wartime setting such as the Holocaust or the U.S. Invasion of Iraq and using these contexts to underscore the potential of human beings to transcend even the most grim and brutal circumstances.  While there is something vaguely troubling to me about Mr. Benigni's premise, I give him enormous credit for taking cinema to new places. I was also put off by the frenetic, obsessive way in which Mr. Benigni's character stalks the female lead, as having been a stalking victim myself, I feel that popular culture far too often romanticizes the type of disruptive, mentally unbalanced pursuit of a love object which should actually be criminalized.

1061682,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,B000NY1EAS,Godly Gadfly,"[1, 1]","Remember ""Life is Beautiful""?  A delicious mix of tragedy and comedy?  This is another film that features the Italian actor Roberto Benigni, and once again his real life wife acting his love interest in the film.  It's in Italian, with English sub-titles.  While Life is Beautiful was set in World War II, this film is set in the modern war in Iraq, with a big part of the film in Bagdhad.Attilio (Benigni), is a poet in Rome, who teaches in a university.  The beginning of the film presents him as a single father, with two teenage girls.  His love interest is Vittori (acted by Benigni's real-life wife), about whom he dreams constantly at night, but she wants nothing to do with him.  The film has a PG rating, but just as with ""Life is Beautiful"", Benigni's character declares an unrequited love and begs to make love to his lady - so be aware this might be unsuitable for children.  But don't be disgusted too quickly, because you might be in for a surprise... [spoiler: at the end we discover that Vittori is actually Attilio's wife, which gives the entire film a whole different meaning, and you'll almost want to watch it again]When Vittori goes to Iraq while working on a biography of an Iraqi poet, she becomes seriously ill, and Attilio manages to find his way to her bedside in Bagdhad.  Most of the film revolves on the scenes that follow, as he desperately tries to save her life.  Here the film clearly becomes serious - Attilio seems oblivious to the reality of the danger, and while his enthusiastic optimism is sometimes over-the-top, it also serves to make the tragedy of war more apparent.  His character is very much like the bubbly optimism of his character in ""Life is Beautiful"", constantly babbling, and if you enjoyed it there, you'll like it here too.  He's a buffoon, but a loveable one.I don't want to spoil the plot, but at the very end there is a somewhat surprising twist and discovery, one that may leave you wanting to watch the film again with a completely new perspective!  So if you are disappointed while watching, suspend your judgment until the end!  As good as Life is Beautiful?  That would be saying too much.  It's primarily an entertaining story, but it's a good one, with a pleasant mix of humour and comedy, and one that will leave you contemplating both the power of love and the horror of war. - GODLY GADFLY",4,Life still is beautiful ... sometimes,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,2357,"['Remember', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'delicious', 'mix', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'film', 'Italian', 'actor', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'once', 'again', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'acting', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'Italian', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'was', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'set', 'modern', 'war', 'Iraq', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'Bagdhad.Attilio', 'Benigni', 'poet', 'Rome', 'who', 'university', 'beginning', 'film', 'single', 'father', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'love', 'interest', 'Vittori', 'acted', 'Benigni', 'real-life', 'wife', 'about', 'whom', 'constantly', 'night', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'PG', 'rating', 'just', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'Benigni', 'character', 'unrequited', 'love', 'begs', 'make', 'love', 'lady', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'might', 'be', 'unsuitable', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'disgusted', 'too', 'quickly', 'might', 'be', 'surprise', '[', 'spoiler', 'end', 'discover', 'Vittori', 'actually', 'Attilio', 'wife', 'entire', 'film', 'whole', 'different', 'meaning', ""'ll"", 'almost', 'want', 'watch', 'again', ']', 'When', 'Vittori', 'Iraq', 'working', 'biography', 'Iraqi', 'poet', 'seriously', 'ill', 'Attilio', 'find', 'way', 'bedside', 'Bagdhad', 'Most', 'film', 'scenes', 'follow', 'desperately', 'save', 'life', 'Here', 'film', 'clearly', 'becomes', 'serious', 'Attilio', 'oblivious', 'reality', 'danger', 'enthusiastic', 'optimism', 'sometimes', 'over-the-top', 'also', 'make', 'tragedy', 'war', 'more', 'apparent', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'bubbly', 'optimism', 'character', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'constantly', 'babbling', 'enjoyed', 'there', ""'ll"", 'like', 'here', 'too', 'buffoon', 'loveable', 'one.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'plot', 'very', 'end', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'twist', 'discovery', 'one', 'may', 'leave', 'wanting', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'completely', 'new', 'perspective', 'So', 'are', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'suspend', 'judgment', 'end', 'As', 'good', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'would', 'be', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'primarily', 'entertaining', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'pleasant', 'mix', 'humour', 'comedy', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'contemplating', 'power', 'love', 'horror', 'war', 'GODLY', 'GADFLY']",The Tiger and the Snow

It was just badly written and badly edited.I write this, because, I read the Amazon reviews before I bought this, and I feel like I was badly over sold and that I wasted my time and money.  My sweetheart felt the same way. Two thumbs down.  So remember:  buyers beware.

This is not what you would expect from him if you are used to his comedies, but if you have seen Life is Beautiful, then you know what a great actor he is.  This is a love story.  It is heartwrenching in places when you feel Benigni's frustration at not being able to get his love the help she needs.  Not to spoil it for anyone, but the ending where his love sees the necklace is priceless.

He can bring sadness and comedy into the same moment. As a script, The Tiger and the Snow is creative, well plotted and has a near flawless structure. Benigni is highly underrated for this particular work; maybe because it takes place in Iraq, maybe because there's a bias against ""foreign"" films in America. Whatever the reason, if you are a lover of good quality work, this is a highly recommended movie. And I haven't even started on Benigni's gift for comedy. Or the magic that Nicoletta Braschi brings to the screen. Or Jean Renoir's ever-present charisma.

I always associated these two guys as they somehow are similar. Both are my favourite actors. The movie is clearly against any kind of invasion and war and is created to send a message across. If you sleep through the middle of the movie (I did, unintentionally) you will not understand what it all was about. Once you watch it entirely and especially the second time, you will understand, it's a good movie.
