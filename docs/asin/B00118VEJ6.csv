1130838,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B00118VEJ6,Compay,"[0, 0]","This review is from: Eddie Griffin: Freedom of Speech (DVD)As a fan of Eddie Griffin, I had hoped that his Freedom of Speech stand-up special would be a bit more edgy than his other performances. But overall, too much of the material seemed dated, recycled, and just not that funny.Voodoo Child was easily one of his best performances, partly because of the originality, and also how introspective the material was. But in Freedom of Speech, Eddie goes as far as digging up decades-old Black jokes (""branch manager"", ""snow tires"") to weave into ""personal"" stories as filler.There's also some recycling of his old routine on how ethnic women treat their men when they come home from work. The jokes about sugar sandwiches are also noticeably lifted from Martin Lawrence.The crowd isn't feeling this performance as his other stand-up shows, and big laughs are rare. When Eddie breaks into jokes about mathematics and science, you can hear a pin drop in the theater.Freedom of Speech is worth watching once, but it's probably Griffin's weakest performance to date. Definitely give this one a rent before you consider buying the DVD.",2,"Not as Funny as Griffin's ""Voodoo Child"" Show",1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1129,"['review', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'Freedom', 'Speech', 'DVD', 'fan', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'had', 'hoped', 'Freedom', 'Speech', 'stand-up', 'special', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'edgy', 'other', 'performances', 'overall', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'seemed', 'dated', 'recycled', 'just', 'not', 'funny.Voodoo', 'Child', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'partly', 'originality', 'also', 'how', 'introspective', 'material', 'was', 'Freedom', 'Speech', 'Eddie', 'as', 'far', 'digging', 'up', 'decades-old', 'Black', 'jokes', 'branch', 'manager', 'snow', 'tires', 'weave', 'personal', 'stories', 'filler.There', 'also', 'recycling', 'old', 'routine', 'how', 'ethnic', 'women', 'treat', 'men', 'when', 'come', 'home', 'work', 'jokes', 'sugar', 'sandwiches', 'are', 'also', 'noticeably', 'lifted', 'Martin', 'Lawrence.The', 'crowd', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'performance', 'other', 'stand-up', 'shows', 'big', 'laughs', 'are', 'rare', 'When', 'Eddie', 'jokes', 'mathematics', 'science', 'can', 'hear', 'pin', 'drop', 'theater.Freedom', 'Speech', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'probably', 'Griffin', 'weakest', 'performance', 'date', 'Definitely', 'give', 'one', 'rent', 'consider', 'buying', 'DVD']",Eddie Griffin - Freedom Of Speech
