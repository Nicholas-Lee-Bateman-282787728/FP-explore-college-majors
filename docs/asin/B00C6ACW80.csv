1642776,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,B00C6ACW80,Dave Cordes,"[10, 11]","""Scream of the Shalka"" was originally released as 6x15 minute Flash animation webisodes by the BBC to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the program when there was no Doctor Who program currently on-air in 2003.  Shortly afterward, BBC One had decided to bring Doctor Who back to the tele and then-showrunner Russell T. Davies in an interview with Doctor Who Magazine announced that the new television Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston) would be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Richard E. Grant's Ninth Doctor to an alternate Whoniverse. Davies later commented that Grant had never even been considered for the role in the new series, quoted as saying in DWM: ""I thought he was terrible. I thought he took the money and ran, to be honest. It was a lazy performance. He was never on our list to play the Doctor. Therefore it exists outside of the continuity canon of the Whoniverse.""  A bit harsh I'd say.I've enjoyed other animated adventures of Doctor Who including Cosgrove Hall's wonderful work on the 10th Doctor serialDoctor Who: The Infinite Questand the wonderfully animated reconstruction episodes onDoctor Who: The Invasion (Story 46), and recently Quarios' work animating the 2 missing episodes fromDoctor Who: The Ice Warriors (Story 39).  I think the animation in ""Scream of the Shalka"" is equally as good and interesting and enjoyable to watch with good performances by Richard E. Grant as the Doctor (Who appeared, ironically, as the Tenth Doctor in the parody ""The Curse of Fatal Death"" and as the villain inDoctor Who: The Snowmen [Blu-ray] (2012)and Derek Jacobi as the Master (who would later reprise his role in ""Utopia"") and the Doctor's companion, Alison Cheney, voiced by Sophie Okonedo who also appeared as Liz 10 in ""The Beast Below"" and ""The Pandorica Opens.""  David Tennant even has a cameo.  There's no denying the significance that ""Scream of the Shalka"" contributed to Doctor Who's long-awaited return to the airwaves and it's a fascinating look at an attempt to give the fans new material in another media format during a period when we only had the Big Finish audio dramas to keep the show going after Paul McGann's singular appearance as the Eighth Doctor in the AmericanizedDoctor Who: The Movie (Special Edition).Extras include ""Carry On Screaming"" where the production team discuss the genesis of the animated series,  ""Screaming Sessions"" with the cast and crew minus Richard E Grant discuss being turned into animated characters, ""Interweb Of Fear"" talks about the BBC's plans to bring online media with Doctor Who to the forefront, and finally ""The Soundtrack Album"" features over 27 minutes of isolated music score.  Still, there's no reason why these could not have been included as bonus material on another 2-disc DVD set (this is NOT a 2-disc set, btw, even though there is a misprint on the packaging), perhaps as part of theDoctor Who 50th Anniversary Special: The Day of the Doctor (Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD Combo)along with the docudrama ""Doctor Who: An Adventure In Space and Time"" or even as part of the ""Doctors Revisited"" seriesDoctor Who: Doctors Revisited - Ninth to Eleventh.  If you are a completist, or you REALLY liked ""Scream of the Shalka,"" then it's probably worth  justifying purchasing the DVD.  I strongly encourage anyone who hasn't seen it though to watch the webcasts online for free first ([...] to decide for yourselves if it is worth splurging on to add it to your collection.",3,Good but could have been included as bonus material on another DVD,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,3451,"['Scream', 'Shalka', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '6x15', 'minute', 'Flash', 'animation', 'webisodes', 'BBC', 'commemorate', '40th', 'anniversary', 'program', 'when', 'was', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'program', 'currently', 'on-air', '2003', 'Shortly', 'afterward', 'BBC', 'One', 'had', 'decided', 'bring', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'back', 'tele', 'then-showrunner', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'interview', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Magazine', 'announced', 'new', 'television', 'Doctor', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'would', 'be', 'Ninth', 'Doctor', 'relegating', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Ninth', 'Doctor', 'alternate', 'Whoniverse', 'Davies', 'later', 'commented', 'Grant', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'been', 'considered', 'role', 'new', 'series', 'quoted', 'saying', 'DWM', 'thought', 'was', 'terrible', 'thought', 'took', 'money', 'ran', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'lazy', 'performance', 'was', 'never', 'list', 'play', 'Doctor', 'Therefore', 'continuity', 'canon', 'Whoniverse', 'bit', 'harsh', ""'d"", 'say.I', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'other', 'animated', 'adventures', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'including', 'Cosgrove', 'Hall', 'wonderful', 'work', '10th', 'Doctor', 'serialDoctor', 'Who', 'Infinite', 'Questand', 'wonderfully', 'animated', 'reconstruction', 'episodes', 'onDoctor', 'Who', 'Invasion', 'Story', '46', 'recently', 'Quarios', 'work', 'animating', '2', 'missing', 'episodes', 'fromDoctor', 'Who', 'Ice', 'Warriors', 'Story', '39', 'think', 'animation', 'Scream', 'Shalka', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'good', 'performances', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'appeared', 'ironically', 'Tenth', 'Doctor', 'parody', 'Curse', 'Fatal', 'Death', 'villain', 'inDoctor', 'Who', 'Snowmen', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', '2012', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Master', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'reprise', 'role', 'Utopia', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'Alison', 'Cheney', 'voiced', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'Liz', '10', 'Beast', 'Below', 'Pandorica', 'Opens', 'David', 'Tennant', 'even', 'cameo', 'denying', 'significance', 'Scream', 'Shalka', 'contributed', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'long-awaited', 'return', 'airwaves', 'fascinating', 'look', 'attempt', 'give', 'fans', 'new', 'material', 'media', 'format', 'period', 'when', 'only', 'had', 'Big', 'Finish', 'audio', 'dramas', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'singular', 'appearance', 'Eighth', 'Doctor', 'AmericanizedDoctor', 'Who', 'Movie', 'Special', 'Edition', '.Extras', 'include', 'Carry', 'Screaming', 'where', 'production', 'team', 'genesis', 'animated', 'series', 'Screaming', 'Sessions', 'cast', 'crew', 'minus', 'Richard', 'E', 'Grant', 'discuss', 'being', 'turned', 'animated', 'characters', 'Interweb', 'Fear', 'talks', 'BBC', 'plans', 'bring', 'online', 'media', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'forefront', 'finally', 'Soundtrack', 'Album', '27', 'minutes', 'isolated', 'music', 'score', 'Still', 'reason', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'bonus', 'material', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'NOT', '2-disc', 'set', 'btw', 'even', 'misprint', 'packaging', 'perhaps', 'part', 'theDoctor', 'Who', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'Day', 'Doctor', 'Blu-ray', '3D', '/', 'Blu-ray', '/', 'DVD', 'Combo', 'docudrama', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Time', 'even', 'part', 'Doctors', 'Revisited', 'seriesDoctor', 'Who', 'Doctors', 'Revisited', 'Ninth', 'Eleventh', 'are', 'completist', 'REALLY', 'liked', 'Scream', 'Shalka', 'then', 'probably', 'worth', 'justifying', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'watch', 'webcasts', 'online', 'free', 'first', '[', 'decide', 'yourselves', 'worth', 'splurging', 'add', 'collection']",Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka

So went the experience of the team behind the first ever fully animated Doctor Who story, Scream of the Shalka. What they created may not be one of the fondest remembered episodes in the Who-verse, but it may be the most important.Back in 2002 the original team of folks behind this were coming off some interesting experiments happening with online storytelling and animation. The BBC had two official websites, with one leaning more towards pop culture and the media front and the other more focused on the news. The team noticed that the 40th anniversary of Doctor Who was soon approaching and the BBC had made no mention of doing anything special for it. The famed character was still viewed at the time as a historical novelty with only a niche following.It was agreed that some type of remembrance should celebrate the anniversary and this team charged forward with the idea of making a brand new animated story and launching it online using flash animation. They asked BBC if it was cool and found out they were golden as long as they could get all the rights sorted out, which they did. Off they went and the work was quick and tough, but thrilling.Suddenly people started asking the BBC questions at press conferences about whether or not a celebration was being planned for the anniversary and would the show ever come back. The reply was they would love to bring the show back, but the rights were too tied up and unavailable. This was a rather big shock to the folks working on Shalka since they believed they had the rights all sorted out. The BBC got reminded about them and called them immediately to headquarters, likely in order to yell at them. But the Shalka team came prepared with all their documentation about the rights and they were allowed to continue on the special.This brief and momentarily tense meeting was only a brief bump in the road in terms of Shalka production, but it planted that seed that Doctor Who could actually come back fully on television. Once that connected with an ambitious woman at the head of development the ball began to roll and it very quickly led to the 2005 reboot and the rebirth of a modern day franchise. The premiere of the new series quickly overshadowed the online Shalka production which hit the web only a few months before the show came back to air. The story was quickly dumped into the annals of Who history and left to gather digital dust, even though it actually won an award for digital animation at the time.Yet I think it deserves to be told that without Shalka the current phenomenon may not have come to bear, or at least not in the time frame it did. Also, for Richard Grant, the actor who voiced the Doctor in this tossed aside project, he did get to come back years later during the seventh season with Matt Smith as The Great Intelligence. Another factoid is back in 2003, then fanboy and future Doctor himself, David Tennant, got to voice a five line character (Second Warehouse Worker) in the animated episode.So while it might not be a great story in contrast to the last seven years of modern day Doctor Who, it was an integral stepping stone to getting us there.",4,A Piece of Doctor Who history more important than it seems,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,3255,"['are', 'times', 'life', 'when', 'even', 'dream', 'true', '8217', 'not', 'quite', 'way', 'imagined', 'went', 'experience', 'team', 'first', 'ever', 'fully', 'animated', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', 'Scream', 'Shalka', 'What', 'created', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'fondest', 'remembered', 'episodes', 'Who-verse', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'important.Back', '2002', 'original', 'team', 'folks', 'were', 'coming', 'off', 'interesting', 'experiments', 'happening', 'online', 'storytelling', 'animation', 'BBC', 'had', 'two', 'official', 'websites', 'one', 'leaning', 'more', 'towards', 'pop', 'culture', 'media', 'front', 'other', 'more', 'focused', 'news', 'team', 'noticed', '40th', 'anniversary', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'soon', 'approaching', 'BBC', 'had', 'made', 'mention', 'doing', 'anything', 'special', 'famed', 'character', 'was', 'still', 'viewed', 'time', 'historical', 'novelty', 'only', 'niche', 'following.It', 'was', 'agreed', 'type', 'remembrance', 'should', 'celebrate', 'anniversary', 'team', 'charged', 'forward', 'idea', 'making', 'brand', 'new', 'animated', 'story', 'launching', 'online', 'using', 'flash', 'animation', 'asked', 'BBC', 'was', 'cool', 'found', 'were', 'golden', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'get', 'rights', 'sorted', 'out', 'did', 'went', 'work', 'was', 'quick', 'tough', 'thrilling.Suddenly', 'people', 'started', 'asking', 'BBC', 'questions', 'press', 'conferences', 'not', 'celebration', 'was', 'being', 'planned', 'anniversary', 'would', 'show', 'ever', 'come', 'back', 'reply', 'was', 'would', 'love', 'bring', 'show', 'back', 'rights', 'were', 'too', 'tied', 'up', 'unavailable', 'was', 'rather', 'big', 'shock', 'folks', 'working', 'Shalka', 'believed', 'had', 'rights', 'sorted', 'out', 'BBC', 'got', 'reminded', 'called', 'immediately', 'headquarters', 'likely', 'order', 'yell', 'Shalka', 'team', 'came', 'prepared', 'documentation', 'rights', 'were', 'allowed', 'continue', 'special.This', 'brief', 'momentarily', 'tense', 'meeting', 'was', 'only', 'brief', 'bump', 'road', 'terms', 'Shalka', 'production', 'planted', 'seed', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'could', 'actually', 'come', 'back', 'fully', 'television', 'connected', 'ambitious', 'woman', 'head', 'development', 'ball', 'began', 'roll', 'very', 'quickly', 'led', '2005', 'reboot', 'rebirth', 'modern', 'day', 'franchise', 'premiere', 'new', 'series', 'quickly', 'overshadowed', 'online', 'Shalka', 'production', 'hit', 'web', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'show', 'came', 'back', 'air', 'story', 'was', 'quickly', 'dumped', 'annals', 'Who', 'history', 'left', 'gather', 'digital', 'dust', 'even', 'actually', 'won', 'award', 'digital', 'animation', 'time.Yet', 'think', 'be', 'told', 'Shalka', 'current', 'phenomenon', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'bear', 'least', 'not', 'time', 'frame', 'did', 'Also', 'Richard', 'Grant', 'actor', 'who', 'voiced', 'Doctor', 'tossed', 'aside', 'project', 'did', 'get', 'come', 'back', 'years', 'later', 'seventh', 'season', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'Great', 'Intelligence', 'factoid', 'back', '2003', 'then', 'fanboy', 'future', 'Doctor', 'David', 'Tennant', 'got', 'voice', 'five', 'line', 'character', 'Second', 'Warehouse', 'Worker', 'animated', 'episode.So', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'story', 'contrast', 'last', 'seven', 'years', 'modern', 'day', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'integral', 'stepping', 'stone', 'getting', 'there']",Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka

I was more than a bit skeptical going into this. A few of the reasons that I enjoy the live action series so much is the little nuances and amusing facial expressions of the actors on the screen. It's impossible to catch the twinkle of the eye or even something like the movement hair. Surprisingly, even though these details weren't present in this feature, the actors voicing the Doctor, Alison, and even the Master really brought the characters to life. Richard E. Grant, Sophie Okonedo and Derek Jacobi are just a few of the famous actors who lent their voice talents to this little masterpiece and later starred alongside the Doctor in the live action series. You know how great they were in the new series so you can imagine how wonderful they were in this animated bridge between classic and new Doctor.Now for the monsters -- the Shalka. The Shalka, a reptilian-like alien species didn't have much to say, but as you may have guessed from the title of the DVD, their screams are quite grotesque -- not to mention the fact that they took over human bodies to lead earth and humanity into death and darkness. Aliens that can grow out of human foreheads is enough to give anyone the shivers! The Shalka are indeed a very frightening alien, up there with the Weeping Angels and the Silence.I was very impressed with the animation, the story-line, the monsters, and each of the characters. As much as I enjoyed this, I was a little disappointed that the ending was left open for more adventures with the Doctor and Alison but to my knowledge, there never were any. Still, Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka is yet another wonderful DVD for anyone who loves Doctor Who and for those who want to build their DVD library with shows the whole family can watch and enjoy together.Doctor Who Scream of the Shalka is available now on DVD from Amazon and other stores.~ My Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars ~*I received a complimentary copy from the publisher/publicist for review purposes.

If you try hard you might be able to see how he could be the next generation up from the 8th Doctor, Paul Mcgann.
