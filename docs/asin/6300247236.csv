226234,A1A4DEENGHK51T,6300247236,Alan Attebery,"[7, 9]","It is no secret that there are many managers in this world who are nothing more than tokenheads of their departments. The real movers, shakers, and go-getters are the underlings that work for the manager.And so is the case of Franklin M Hart, Jr., (perfectly played by Dabney Colemna) a vice-president at Consolidated. Oh sure, he was nice enough as he worked his way to the top of this male-dominated firm. But once he got there, he started stepping on everyone below him, including Violet Newstead (the ever funny Lily Tomlin), the office manager. As if that wasn't bad enough, Mr. Hart continously tries to seduce his unavailable, and equally unwilling, secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton, making her movie debut). And when the new girl, Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda), accidentally makes a mess in the copier room, Mr. Hart tells her like it is.After a while, the three put-upon women become friends, and after smoking a single joint together, start fantasizing about how they would put Mr. Hart in his place. Soon, however, fantasy becomes reality when Mr. Hart finds out that Violet accidentally put rat poison in his coffee.In an attempt to stay out of jail, Violet, Doralee, and Judy take Mr. Hart hostage while they formulate a plan. Soon they discover that Mr. Hart has illegally made a profit at Consolidated's expense, and set out to get the evidence needed that will keep Mr. Hart from going to the police. But it will take nearly three weeks for the home office to send them the information. Will they be able to keep Mr. Hart under lock and key until then? Better yet, can they fool the office into thinking that Mr. Hart is still at work even though he's not?&quot;9 to 5&quot; is one of those movies that you can't help but to enjoy. Funny, witty, and smart, anyone who has ever worked for a manager that didn't deserve to be a manager will enjoy watching fantasy become reality (at least, in the movie).Released in 1980, this movie earned over $100 million (a relative rarity back then). It also earned Dolly Parton an Oscar nomination (Best Music - Original Song), three Golden Globes nominations (Best Motion Picture Actress - Musical/Comedy; Best Original Song - Motion Picture; New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture - Female), and a Grammy nomination (Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special). She also won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Song.The success of the movie resulted in two short-lived TV series (first one from 1982-1983; second one from 1986 - 1988), both of which starred Dolly Parton's sister, Rachel Dennison.If you've ever dreamed of watching your manager get his or her just desserts, then this movie will provide you with plenty of laughs (and possibly an idea or two).",4,Not your average working stiff movie.,1085788800,"05 29, 2004",2004,2772,"['secret', 'are', 'many', 'managers', 'world', 'who', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'tokenheads', 'departments', 'real', 'movers', 'shakers', 'go-getters', 'are', 'underlings', 'work', 'manager.And', 'so', 'case', 'Franklin', 'M', 'Hart', 'Jr.', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Dabney', 'Colemna', 'vice-president', 'Consolidated', 'Oh', 'sure', 'was', 'nice', 'enough', 'worked', 'way', 'top', 'male-dominated', 'firm', 'once', 'got', 'there', 'started', 'stepping', 'everyone', 'including', 'Violet', 'Newstead', 'ever', 'funny', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'office', 'manager', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'continously', 'seduce', 'unavailable', 'equally', 'unwilling', 'secretary', 'Doralee', 'Rhodes', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'making', 'movie', 'debut', 'when', 'new', 'girl', 'Judy', 'Bernly', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'accidentally', 'mess', 'copier', 'room', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'while', 'three', 'put-upon', 'women', 'become', 'friends', 'smoking', 'single', 'joint', 'together', 'start', 'fantasizing', 'how', 'would', 'put', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'place', 'Soon', 'however', 'fantasy', 'becomes', 'reality', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'out', 'Violet', 'accidentally', 'put', 'rat', 'poison', 'coffee.In', 'attempt', 'stay', 'jail', 'Violet', 'Doralee', 'Judy', 'take', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'hostage', 'formulate', 'plan', 'Soon', 'discover', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'illegally', 'made', 'profit', 'Consolidated', 'expense', 'set', 'out', 'get', 'evidence', 'needed', 'will', 'keep', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'going', 'police', 'will', 'take', 'nearly', 'three', 'weeks', 'home', 'office', 'send', 'information', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'lock', 'key', 'then', 'Better', 'yet', 'can', 'fool', 'office', 'thinking', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'still', 'work', 'even', 'not', 'quot', '9', '5', 'quot', 'one', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'Funny', 'witty', 'smart', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'worked', 'manager', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'manager', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'fantasy', 'become', 'reality', 'least', 'movie', '.Released', '1980', 'movie', 'earned', '100', 'million', 'relative', 'rarity', 'back', 'then', 'also', 'earned', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Music', 'Original', 'Song', 'three', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Actress', 'Musical/Comedy', 'Best', 'Original', 'Song', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'New', 'Star', 'Year', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Female', 'Grammy', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Album', 'Original', 'Score', 'Written', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Television', 'Special', 'also', 'won', 'People', 'Choice', 'Award', 'Favorite', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Song.The', 'success', 'movie', 'resulted', 'two', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'first', 'one', '1982-1983', 'second', 'one', '1986', '1988', 'starred', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'sister', 'Rachel', 'Dennison.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'dreamed', 'watching', 'manager', 'get', 'just', 'desserts', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'provide', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'possibly', 'idea', 'two']",9 to 5 VHS

226240,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300247236,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 7]","From the moment I heard Dolly Parton's uniquely engaging voice come over my television stereo set singing the theme song to this 80's comedy I knew that I was going to enjoy myself.  I don't know what it is about that woman that I just adore, but whatever, that's neither here nor there.  The fact is that before I even got into the meat of this movie I had made my mind up.  By the time the credits began to roll I have changed my mind completely.  Yet still, by the time I woke up the next morning I had a very different outlook.Okay, so here's the thing; `9 to 5' is a deceitful little thing.This is what I mean.  `9 to 5' is not a laugh out loud type of comedy.  Maybe it is to some, but for me it was one of those `laugh quietly on the inside' type of comedies, and so because of that when the film ends I wound up thinking it wasn't really all that funny.  But it's also one of those comedies that sits well with you.  As you think about it you wind up finding the humor and before long you remember it funnier than when you were watching it.Make sense?So the film revolves around three working women and their egotistical boss.  Violet Newstead is a hard working woman seeking out a promotion that she wholeheartedly deserves; Doralee Rhodes is a hard working secretary just trying to do her job right despite the nasty rumors floating around the office, and Judy Bernly is a recent divorcee who just wants to prove her independence.  The problem they all share is the man they call boss; Franklin M. Hart Jr.When an accident gives sends one of the girls into a panic their lives are forever changed as they find themselves holding their boss hostage, getting involved in blackmail and eventually teaching the man a thing or two about girl-power.As far as the acting is concerned, there are clear standouts and a few disappointing letdowns.  First of all, Dolly Parton is a doll and a comedic knockout; truly the most inspired performance between the three leads.  Jane Fonda, an actress I am not usually smitten with, is less inspired but she manages to be better than I would have given her credit for.  My biggest disappointment came in the form of Lily Tomlin, who I just expected to be amazing.  I usually find her a comedic delight and a true standout in just about everything, but here she was at times rather dull.The truth of the matter is though, that as much as this film is about these three women and their `standing up to the man', it is the man himself that runs away with the entire show.  Yes, Dabney Coleman, AKA Franklin M. Hart Jr. is seriously the funniest and most engaging part of this film.  He nails his character and delivers one of my favorite supporting performances of the said year.So, the film is not as good as I expected (it can feel a little bland at times) but if you let it rest a bit it winds up being funnier the more you think about it.  In parts it's great and so maybe that's why it's funnier to think about than to watch, since when you think about it you think about the better parts.  Anyways, it's worthy watching at least once; if only for the great Coleman and the vivacious Parton.",3,Well I'm in the minority here...,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,3136,"['moment', 'heard', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'uniquely', 'engaging', 'voice', 'come', 'television', 'stereo', 'set', 'singing', 'theme', 'song', '80', 'comedy', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'woman', 'just', 'adore', 'whatever', 'here', 'there', 'fact', 'even', 'got', 'meat', 'movie', 'had', 'made', 'mind', 'up', 'time', 'credits', 'began', 'roll', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'completely', 'still', 'time', 'woke', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'outlook.Okay', 'here', 'thing', '9', '5', 'deceitful', 'little', 'thing.This', 'what', 'mean', '9', '5', 'not', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'type', 'comedy', 'Maybe', 'was', 'one', 'laugh', 'quietly', 'inside', 'type', 'comedies', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'wound', 'up', 'thinking', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'funny', 'also', 'one', 'comedies', 'well', 'think', 'wind', 'up', 'finding', 'humor', 'long', 'remember', 'funnier', 'when', 'were', 'watching', 'it.Make', 'sense', 'film', 'around', 'three', 'working', 'women', 'egotistical', 'boss', 'Violet', 'Newstead', 'hard', 'working', 'woman', 'seeking', 'out', 'promotion', 'wholeheartedly', 'Doralee', 'Rhodes', 'hard', 'working', 'secretary', 'just', 'trying', 'do', 'job', 'right', 'nasty', 'rumors', 'floating', 'office', 'Judy', 'Bernly', 'recent', 'divorcee', 'who', 'just', 'prove', 'independence', 'problem', 'share', 'man', 'call', 'boss', 'Franklin', 'M.', 'Hart', 'Jr.When', 'accident', 'one', 'girls', 'panic', 'lives', 'are', 'forever', 'changed', 'find', 'holding', 'boss', 'hostage', 'getting', 'involved', 'blackmail', 'eventually', 'teaching', 'man', 'thing', 'two', 'girl-power.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'are', 'clear', 'standouts', 'few', 'disappointing', 'letdowns', 'First', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'doll', 'comedic', 'knockout', 'most', 'inspired', 'performance', 'three', 'leads', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'actress', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'smitten', 'less', 'inspired', 'be', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'credit', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'came', 'form', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'who', 'just', 'expected', 'be', 'amazing', 'usually', 'find', 'comedic', 'delight', 'true', 'standout', 'just', 'everything', 'here', 'was', 'times', 'rather', 'dull.The', 'truth', 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'three', 'women', 'standing', 'up', 'man', 'man', 'away', 'entire', 'show', 'Yes', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'AKA', 'Franklin', 'M.', 'Hart', 'Jr.', 'seriously', 'funniest', 'most', 'engaging', 'part', 'film', 'character', 'one', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'performances', 'said', 'year.So', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'can', 'feel', 'little', 'bland', 'times', 'let', 'rest', 'bit', 'up', 'being', 'funnier', 'more', 'think', 'parts', 'great', 'so', 'maybe', 'why', 'funnier', 'think', 'watch', 'when', 'think', 'think', 'better', 'parts', 'Anyways', 'worthy', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'only', 'great', 'Coleman', 'vivacious', 'Parton']",9 to 5 VHS

Pearson ""West Coast Ranter""","[0, 0]","I was but 9-years-old when this one came to theatres and I still remember how at that time, the movie theater held such a spell of mystique over me...something that gets lost as you get older and movies are more ""every day"" now.As most might attest, the film starts off wonderfully with the opening, upbeat, thumping chords of the theme song, ""9 to 5"" sung by the incomparable Dolly Parton...the song invigorates you right from the start and you know you are in for a load of fun.Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda are cast perfectly and beautifully in their respective roles. I don't know of any modern actress/comedians who could fill these roles more beautifully. Quite simply, Lily Tomlin is a comedic genius...and she is fully supported by the lesser experienced Dolly and far more experienced Jane Fonda. Surprisingly, Jane Fonda, already somewhat of an icon at the time, took a less visible/memorable role...but played it with perfectly subtelty and professionalism.A few of my favorite scenes: The three girls are pulled over by the cop because of the ""short"" in the trunk. They know the body is in the trunk, but are trying to play it off by pretending that Dolly's character ate rat poison by accident.Also, for years later, I was afraid to go into hospital bathrooms after the female orderly found the ""body"" in the bathroom covered by the sheet...by the way she said, ""There's another stiff in the john""...I assumed that dead bodies were often found in hospital bathrooms.Dabney Coleman played the perfect sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss...and as a kid, I truly hated him.Another of my favorite bits was when Lily Tomlin, in her Disney-like dream sequence, poisons her bosses coffee...then launches him out of his office window right after saying, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"" then sticking out her tongue. For years, my siblings and I would tease each other with the same gesture. (you'll have to watch the film to know what I'm talking about).If you watch this film for the first time, you'll notice there are no desktop computers...nor does anyone have a cell phone. And the copy machine is almost the size of a small car. It may date the film just a tad...but the comedic value more than makes up for that. It's definitely a film for all time and women today, I'm sure, are still facing similar type situations in the office.Now in my 30's, I'm always surprised at the number of 20-something's who have never seen nor heard of this classic film.

The reason for their discontent, is their boss who seeks to use and abuse his female staff while maintaining his iron hold over his section in the company. As the women get together, they discuss their favorite fantasies concerning the boss, all of them concern offing him in one way or another. Jane bags him in a big game hunt, Dolly wants to rope and brand him and Lili has a Snow White fairytale scenario that has her as a princess surrounded by cute woodland animals bringing a cup of poison.The problem for Lili, is that her fantasy has become a reality when she mistakes a package of rat poison for a box of sweetener and brings a cup of poisoned coffee to her boss. He doesn't drink it, but his chair gives way and he hit his head and was hospital bound. None of the three realized that he wasn't poisoned so they drive to the hospital to snatch the body, thinking it is their boss. When they find that it isn't they put it back and believe their troubles are behind them, only to discover that the boss learned about what happened and is planning to use that information to his own nefarious ends before he finally has them jailed. to prevent it, they take him captive at gunpoint while they try to figure a way to keep him quiet.In the meantime, they start to realize their own power and make changes to improve everything in his name, What happens after is a comedic ending that has to be seen..",5,Secretaries on the warpath.....,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,1560,"['young', 'woman', 'entering', 'first', 'job', 'corporate', 'world', 'discovers', 'just', 'how', 'unfair', 'everything', 'when', 'two', 'other', 'disgruntled', 'co-workers', 'reason', 'discontent', 'boss', 'who', 'use', 'abuse', 'female', 'staff', 'maintaining', 'iron', 'hold', 'section', 'company', 'women', 'get', 'together', 'discuss', 'favorite', 'fantasies', 'concerning', 'boss', 'concern', 'offing', 'one', 'way', 'Jane', 'bags', 'big', 'game', 'hunt', 'Dolly', 'rope', 'brand', 'Lili', 'Snow', 'White', 'fairytale', 'scenario', 'princess', 'surrounded', 'cute', 'woodland', 'animals', 'bringing', 'cup', 'poison.The', 'problem', 'Lili', 'fantasy', 'become', 'reality', 'when', 'package', 'rat', 'poison', 'box', 'sweetener', 'cup', 'poisoned', 'coffee', 'boss', ""n't"", 'drink', 'chair', 'way', 'hit', 'head', 'was', 'hospital', 'bound', 'None', 'three', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'poisoned', 'so', 'drive', 'hospital', 'snatch', 'body', 'thinking', 'boss', 'When', 'find', ""n't"", 'put', 'back', 'believe', 'troubles', 'are', 'only', 'discover', 'boss', 'learned', 'what', 'happened', 'planning', 'use', 'information', 'own', 'nefarious', 'ends', 'finally', 'jailed', 'prevent', 'take', 'captive', 'gunpoint', 'try', 'figure', 'way', 'keep', 'quiet.In', 'meantime', 'start', 'realize', 'own', 'power', 'make', 'changes', 'improve', 'everything', 'name', 'What', 'comedic', 'ending', 'be', 'seen..']",9 to 5 VHS

This special edition DVD also has some nice extras celebrating the most famous office comedy of the bunch. What a combo! Fonda, Tomlin, and Parton...who could have ever imagined that one (watch the DVD and you'll see how Fonda herself came up with the casting one enchanted evening).When this movie was made (1980), the office secretary had no respect. As Fonda points out in the DVD's featurette, the best way to address serious issues and get them out to a large audience is through comedy. This one succeeds on all levels. Judy (Fonda) has just been dumped by her husband...for his secretary. To pay the bills, she takes a job as (what else?) a secretary at the Consolidated Corporation. No-nonsense office manager Violet (Tomlin) trains Judy and passes on some of her frustration at always getting ""leap-frogged"" over for promotions by the good-ol'-boys network, headed by her sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical boss, Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman). Hart's personal secretary, Doralee (Parton), has made no friends in the steno pool because Hart has let it ""leak"" that the two are having an affair; the rest of the girls shun her for this.When Violet accidentally pours rat poison into her boss' coffee instead of Skinny & Sweet, the antics begin and the office will never be the same as all 3 girls band together to make some changes.Casting is amazing; Coleman is letter perfect as the slime-ball boss. Parton hits a home-run in her first movie as the heart-of-gold southern secretary who doesn't stand for bull-s&*t. Tomlin is excellent as Violet, especially in a fantasy sequence as a surreal Snow-White. Fonda is totally believeable as the clumsy defenseless woman dumped by a husband who is forced to fend for herself.Extras include: commentary track with all Fonda, Tomlin, & Parton. Fonda is a little overbearing and is actually told to shut-up at one point. However, much of the excitement is due to how proud all three feel about this film, and how much fun they had making it. Not a lot of behind-the-scenes info, but just hearing the 3 together again is tons of fun. The featurette on the making-of again has all 3 reminiscing about the making of the movie, and includes flubs as well as how the movie came to be. A featurette on Writer/Director Colin Higgins is touching (Higgins has passed away), and all three leads agree on one thing: what a comically gifted and sweet man he was. It is obvious that much of ""9 to 5""'s success is due to him. They all credit him for his humor and timing and belief in the project. A few deleted scenes, a gag reel (some of the footage also appears in the documentaries), theatrical trailer, and a karaoke version of the hit title tune round out this excellent DVD.DEFINITELY one for your comedy collection!",5,"9 to 5 - Sexist, Egotistical, Lying Hypocritical Bigot Edition",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,2872,"['Even', 'office', 'equipment', 'used', 'movie', 'gone', 'style', 'comedy', 'still', 'punch', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'also', 'nice', 'extras', 'celebrating', 'most', 'famous', 'office', 'comedy', 'bunch', 'What', 'combo', 'Fonda', 'Tomlin', 'Parton', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined', 'one', 'watch', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'Fonda', 'came', 'up', 'casting', 'one', 'enchanted', 'evening', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1980', 'office', 'secretary', 'had', 'respect', 'Fonda', 'out', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'best', 'way', 'address', 'serious', 'issues', 'get', 'out', 'large', 'audience', 'comedy', 'one', 'levels', 'Judy', 'Fonda', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'husband', 'secretary', 'pay', 'bills', 'job', 'what', 'else', 'secretary', 'Consolidated', 'Corporation', 'No-nonsense', 'office', 'manager', 'Violet', 'Tomlin', 'Judy', 'passes', 'frustration', 'always', 'getting', 'leap-frogged', 'promotions', ""good-ol'-boys"", 'network', 'headed', 'sexist', 'egotistical', 'lying', 'hypocritical', 'boss', 'Franklin', 'Hart', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Hart', 'personal', 'secretary', 'Doralee', 'Parton', 'made', 'friends', 'steno', 'pool', 'Hart', 'let', 'leak', 'two', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'rest', 'girls', 'shun', 'this.When', 'Violet', 'accidentally', 'rat', 'poison', 'boss', 'coffee', 'instead', 'Skinny', 'Sweet', 'antics', 'begin', 'office', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', '3', 'girls', 'band', 'together', 'make', 'changes.Casting', 'amazing', 'Coleman', 'letter', 'perfect', 'slime-ball', 'boss', 'Parton', 'home-run', 'first', 'movie', 'heart-of-gold', 'southern', 'secretary', 'who', ""n't"", 'stand', 'bull-s', '*t.', 'Tomlin', 'excellent', 'Violet', 'especially', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'surreal', 'Snow-White', 'Fonda', 'totally', 'believeable', 'clumsy', 'defenseless', 'woman', 'dumped', 'husband', 'who', 'forced', 'fend', 'herself.Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'Fonda', 'Tomlin', 'Parton', 'Fonda', 'little', 'overbearing', 'actually', 'told', 'shut-up', 'one', 'point', 'However', 'much', 'excitement', 'due', 'how', 'proud', 'three', 'feel', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'had', 'making', 'Not', 'lot', 'behind-the-scenes', 'info', 'just', 'hearing', '3', 'together', 'again', 'tons', 'fun', 'featurette', 'making-of', 'again', '3', 'reminiscing', 'making', 'movie', 'flubs', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'movie', 'came', 'be', 'featurette', 'Writer/Director', 'Colin', 'Higgins', 'touching', 'Higgins', 'passed', 'away', 'three', 'leads', 'agree', 'one', 'thing', 'what', 'comically', 'gifted', 'sweet', 'man', 'was', 'obvious', 'much', '9', '5', 'success', 'due', 'credit', 'humor', 'timing', 'belief', 'project', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'footage', 'also', 'documentaries', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'karaoke', 'version', 'hit', 'title', 'tune', 'round', 'out', 'excellent', 'DVD.DEFINITELY', 'one', 'comedy', 'collection']",9 to 5 VHS

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[2, 2]","Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda star as three overworked and underpaid secretaries who turn the tables on their chauvanist, unscrupulous boss Mr. Hart (Dabney Coleman) in this classic 1980 office comedy, crisply scripted and directed by the late Colin Higgins from a story by Patricia Resnick.Executive producer and top-billed star Jane Fonda  gives herself the least interesting of the three main roles. Fonda plays Judy Bernly, a rather mousy, nondescript woman who is re-entering the workplace after a recent divorce. By contrast, Violet Newstead  (Lily Tomlin) has been with Consolidated Corporation for twelve years and is constantly being passed over for promotion due to male-chauvanist prejudices. Friendly Doralee (Dolly Parton) has to endure harassment from Mr. Hart on a daily basis. The three eventually bond and fantasize about bumping off their boss. Tomlin's fantasy, based on  Walt Disney's ""Snow White,"" is especially inspired. The plot turns wildly wacky when Violet mistakenly thinks she has killed Hart, by putting rat poison into his coffee. This leads to an extended car chase/comedy sequence involving a dead body stolen from the hospital. Tomlin's comic hysteria is priceless. ""I murdered the boss,"" she wails, ""Do you think they're not going to throw me in prison for something like that?"" Mr. Hart does intend to throw the three ladies in prison for attempted murder; forcing them to, literally, tie Hart up and take charge of the office.Dabney Coleman is wonderful as Mr. Hart. Given the wacky turns of the plot, Hart could have easily come across as a cartoonish scoundral. Hart is a hateful boss, certainly. But as played by Coleman, he is a boss the audience loves to hate. Elizabeth Wilson has a memorable supporting role as Roz, who is secretly in love with Hart and functions as his ""snitch.""The film truly belongs to Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. I can't praise Lily Tomlin's comedy skills highly enough. And Dolly Parton (in her film debut) has a natural, relaxed camera presence. She probably played Doralee as an extention of her own charming personality. But it is a shame that Parton's subsequent movie roles were never as good, or as fun,  as ""9 To 5."" Parton also wrote and performed the film's irresistably catchy and Academy Award nominated title song. Appropriately, the mult-talented Parton wrote all the music and lyrics for the 2009 musical stage adaptation of ""9 To 5""; for which she received a Tony Award nomination. The DVD Extras include a hilarious gag reel, deleted scenes, the original pre-release theatrical trailer, featurettes, and a giggly Audio commentary from Tomlin, Parton, Fonda, and producer Bruce Gilbert; who all clearly admire and miss their beloved director Colin Higgins.",4,"""9 TO 5: THE ORIGINAL OFFICE COMEDY""",1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2750,"['Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'star', 'three', 'overworked', 'underpaid', 'secretaries', 'who', 'turn', 'tables', 'chauvanist', 'unscrupulous', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'classic', '1980', 'office', 'comedy', 'crisply', 'scripted', 'directed', 'late', 'Colin', 'Higgins', 'story', 'Patricia', 'Resnick.Executive', 'producer', 'top-billed', 'star', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'least', 'interesting', 'three', 'main', 'roles', 'Fonda', 'Judy', 'Bernly', 'rather', 'mousy', 'nondescript', 'woman', 'who', 're-entering', 'workplace', 'recent', 'divorce', 'contrast', 'Violet', 'Newstead', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'been', 'Consolidated', 'Corporation', 'twelve', 'years', 'constantly', 'being', 'passed', 'promotion', 'due', 'male-chauvanist', 'prejudices', 'Friendly', 'Doralee', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'endure', 'harassment', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'daily', 'basis', 'three', 'eventually', 'bond', 'fantasize', 'bumping', 'off', 'boss', 'Tomlin', 'fantasy', 'based', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Snow', 'White', 'especially', 'inspired', 'plot', 'wildly', 'wacky', 'when', 'Violet', 'mistakenly', 'killed', 'Hart', 'putting', 'rat', 'poison', 'coffee', 'extended', 'car', 'chase/comedy', 'sequence', 'involving', 'dead', 'body', 'stolen', 'hospital', 'Tomlin', 'comic', 'hysteria', 'priceless', 'murdered', 'boss', 'Do', 'think', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'throw', 'prison', 'something', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'intend', 'throw', 'three', 'ladies', 'prison', 'attempted', 'murder', 'forcing', 'literally', 'tie', 'Hart', 'up', 'take', 'charge', 'office.Dabney', 'Coleman', 'wonderful', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'Given', 'wacky', 'turns', 'plot', 'Hart', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'come', 'cartoonish', 'scoundral', 'Hart', 'hateful', 'boss', 'certainly', 'played', 'Coleman', 'audience', 'hate', 'Elizabeth', 'Wilson', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'role', 'Roz', 'who', 'secretly', 'love', 'Hart', 'functions', 'snitch', 'film', 'truly', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'ca', ""n't"", 'praise', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'comedy', 'highly', 'enough', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'film', 'debut', 'natural', 'relaxed', 'camera', 'presence', 'probably', 'played', 'Doralee', 'extention', 'own', 'charming', 'personality', 'shame', 'Parton', 'subsequent', 'movie', 'roles', 'were', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'fun', '9', '5', 'Parton', 'also', 'wrote', 'performed', 'film', 'irresistably', 'catchy', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'title', 'song', 'Appropriately', 'mult-talented', 'Parton', 'wrote', 'music', 'lyrics', '2009', 'musical', 'stage', 'adaptation', '9', '5', 'received', 'Tony', 'Award', 'nomination', 'DVD', 'Extras', 'include', 'hilarious', 'gag', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'original', 'pre-release', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'featurettes', 'giggly', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'Tomlin', 'Parton', 'Fonda', 'producer', 'Bruce', 'Gilbert', 'who', 'clearly', 'admire', 'miss', 'beloved', 'director', 'Colin', 'Higgins']",9 to 5 VHS

226269,A2TWIZ33KJCQ54,6300247236,"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP""","[22, 22]","FIRST THOUGHTS - -This movie is among the greatest 100 minute entertainment fests in existence. ""9 to 5"" reaches and touches everybody, both male and female somewhere personal and strangely satisfying. Though the plot is great and really moves, it is the smart ""fantasy-revenge"" ideas, dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming mean-spirited and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience.We need to salute Director/Screenwriter, Colin Higgins first. Higgins was the Screenwriter for ""Harold and Maude"", ""Silver Streak"" and ""Foul Play"", picking up a Golden Globe nomination for ""Foul Play"" in 1978. All of Higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious mean-spirited cliches that many of his films' topics' encompass. Also, Editor Pembroke J. Herring who was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Editing and also edited ""Ground Hogs Day"", did an amazingly seamless job of keeping ""9 to 5"" so coherently glued together. Herring was nominated for ""Best Editing"" for; ""Tora! Tora!Tora!"", 1970, ""Bound For Glory"",1976, ""Out Of Africa"", 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas. Higgins and Herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and ""9 to 5"" is one of them.The three female leads all embody some type of stereotype. Lily Tomlin, as Violet Newstead is the widow with four children, going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years - UNSUCCESSFULLY. She is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man's world, so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through F. Hart [Dabney Coleman]. Jane Fonda, as Judy Bernly, is in the middle of a divorce in which her no-good husband, Dick, played deftly by Lawrence Pressman, left her for his secretary. Judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself, F.Hart. Dolly Parton as the delightful Doralee Rhodes, who F.hart chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time - HIS, examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself. That's F.Hart of course and he is the bane of these three ""innocent women"" and as we see, represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it. BTW, Dolly Parton in this role was nominated for an ""Oscar"", ""Best Song"", and 3 ""Golden Globes"", includeing ""Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy"".This film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training. Dabney Coleman as Franklin Hart or just F.HART, delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office. He is ""his"" 3 ""GIRLS"" reason for being the way they are, at least throughout the film. Coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role Carrol O'Connor did in ""All In The Family"" as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed. Comedy and Cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and ""9 to 5"" serves that cause well, chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of Coleman's character. Man or woman, we all enjoy Coleman's comeupance and so will you.My favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana. Naturally, these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against F.Hart. Even such animated Disney characters as ""Snow White"" make an appearance in Tomlin's depiction of Hart's demise. Naturally, the reality nearly repeats Tomlin's fantasy on the very next day, which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse, evading the police, kidnapping and much, much more.The scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just dove-tail so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon. We are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film's plot have been resolved.This is a terrific black comedy. Our characters [3 female leads] gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction. Their foil, F.HART after showing all how despicable he was, literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds. ""REEL JUSTICE"", tidy and quick!! The topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated.--* THE CAST --* Colin Higgins  - Director / ScreenwriterJane Fonda  - Judy BernlyLily Tomlin  - Violet NewsteadDolly Parton  - Doralee RhodesDabney Coleman  - Franklin Hart Jr.Sterling Hayden  - TinsworthyElizabeth Wilson  - RozHenry Jones  - HinkleLawrence Pressman  - DickMarian Mercer  - Missy Hart--* THE AWARDS --*Best Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  AcademyBest Actress- Musical or Comedy (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden GlobeBest Original Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden GlobeNew Star of the Year - Female (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden GlobeDVD FEATURES:It is widescreen [1.85:1] and much clearer than the VHS release.

I thought it was hilarious then and I still think it is hilarious now. Dabney Coleman was the perfect evil boss. He was a sexist, bigoted jerk of a human being who treated his employees like dirt. Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, and Dolly Parton rounds out the cast as the disgruntled employees. Although we use computers now, office antics remains unchanged in the 21st century. Who hasn't dreamt of killing their boss? ""9 to 5"" really epitomized just how funny, if not torturous working in an office can be. I know from experience. Thankfully I never encountered a male supervisor who sexually harassed me like Dabney Coleman did to Dolly Parton in the movie. My personal favorite moment in the film was when the women were at Dolly's home kicking back on some wacky tobaccy. The fantasies were hysterical. They still crack me up to this very day.

226273,AY12DBB0U420B,6300247236,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night I felt like watching a comedy, so I put a ""9 to5"" DVD on. It starred Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The setting was about 1980 when the country was going through a major realignment of the work force. The male-dominated upper levels of business, scientific or academic employment were under fire for not hiring and promoting enough women and women's role in these establishments was starkly defined. It was an interesting time and this movie fits the situation. All the stereotypes prevail in abundance. The Fonda/Tomlin/Parton trio play the downtrodden women and do an excellent job of it. Gags are plentiful and it makes it fun to look back on that period, if somewhat embarrassing.The movie is well done. The acting is good, if somewhat exaggerated here and there for the purpose of laughs. The direction and filming are good. The three leading actresses fit well together and seem to be having a good time. It's a fun movie to watch. If I had any criticism, it would be that the circumstances have changed so drastically in the past three decades that the humor now seems very dated and somewhat stale.

226279,A26HFSVLAGULIM,6300247236,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[3, 5]","This movie is among the greatest 100 minute entertainment fests in existence. ""9 to 5"" reaches and touches everybody, both male and female somewhere personal and strangely satisfying. Though the plot is great and really moves, it is the smart ""fantasy-revenge"" ideas, dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming mean-spirited and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience.We need to salute Director/Screenwriter, Colin Higgins first. Higgins was the Screenwriter for ""Harold and Maude"", ""Silver Streak"" and ""Foul Play"", picking up a Golden Globe nomination for ""Foul Play"" in 1978. All of Higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious mean-spirited cliches that many of his films' topics' encompass. Also, Editor Pembroke J. Herring who was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Editing and also edited ""Ground Hogs Day"", did an amazingly seamless job of keeping ""9 to 5"" so coherently glued together. Herring was nominated for ""Best Editing"" for; ""Tora! Tora!Tora!"", 1970, ""Bound For Glory"",1976, ""Out Of Africa"", 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas. Higgins and Herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and ""9 to 5"" is one of them.The three female leads all embody some type of stereotype. Lily Tomlin, as Violet Newstead is the widow with four children, going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years - UNSUCCESSFULLY. She is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man's world, so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through F. Hart [Dabney Coleman]. Jane Fonda, as Judy Bernly, is in the middle of a divorce in which her no-good husband, Dick, played deftly by Lawrence Pressman, left her for his secretary. Judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself, F.Hart. Dolly Parton as the delightful Doralee Rhodes, who F.hart chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time - HIS, examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself. That's F.Hart of course and he is the bane of these three ""innocent women"" and as we see, represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it. BTW, Dolly Parton in this role was nominated for an ""Oscar"", ""Best Song"", and 3 ""Golden Globes"", includeing ""Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy"".This film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training. Dabney Coleman as Franklin Hart or just F.HART, delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office. He is ""his"" 3 ""GIRLS"" reason for being the way they are, at least throughout the film. Coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role Carrol O'Connor did in ""All In The Family"" as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed. Comedy and Cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and ""9 to 5"" serves that cause well, chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of Coleman's character. Man or woman, we all enjoy Coleman's comeupance and so will you.My favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana. Naturally, these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against F.Hart. Even such animated Disney characters as ""Snow White"" make an appearance in Tomlin's depiction of Hart's demise. Naturally, the reality nearly repeats Tomlin's fantasy on the very next day, which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse, evading the police, kidnapping and much, much more.The scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just dove-tail so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon. We are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film's plot have been resolved.This is a terrific black comedy. Our characters [3 female leads] gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction. Their foil, F.HART after showing all how despicable he was, literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds. ""REEL JUSTICE"", tidy and quick!! The topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated.DVD FEATURES:It is widescreen [1.85:1] and much clearer than the VHS release. The Disney characters in Violet's fantasy demonstrate this obvious color and clarity improvement over the video release. It has 1 trailer and of course scene selection and is available on the same DVD in either English or French with English or Spanish subtitles or no subtitles at all [of course]. Naturally, some interviews and a neat featurette would be nice but again this is a large improvement over the old faded video releases.THIS DVD RELEASE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND THIS FILM'S

They carried out a plan against their boss and got away with it.Please keep in mind, this film is a comedy and was made to laugh at.However, their are some strong messages here that can be well learned.  Bosses should not verbally abuse and/or sexually intent, touch, harass any employee.  This film does point out employees have rights too.  Managers can be in the wrong too.Jane Fonda is ""Judy Bernly"".  Recently divorced.  Has no experience, but is a very decent woman.  Today is her first day at Consolidated Companies LTD.  On her first day everything goes wrong.Lily Tomlin is ""Violet Newstead"".  She has worked their forever.  Never spies.  She is ready for a promotion. She trains Judy on her first day.  In fact, Violet has trained most of the people there and they have been promoted instead of her.Dolly Parton (in her first film) is ""Doralee Rhodes"".  Mr. Hart's main secretary.  There is bad gossip going around about the boss and the secretary, but it is not true.  Doralee is a married woman  and is a Christian and pure as Judy is and would never engage in bad behavior at work.Dabney Coleman is the boss, ""Franklin Hart"". He is the boss and the vice-president.  Has has a bad mouth towards secretaries and wants ""personal servitude"" that is not part of the job description.After the boss makes personal advances towards Doralee, makes inappropriate comments towards Violet and dismisses Maria (Roxanna Bonilla-Giannini) for having light conversation in the bathroom and guessing the bosses salary, and after another incident, Violet, along with Doralee and Judy later decide that something has to be done to the boss and improvements must be made within the company.Better working conditions for all.  Violet just might get her promotion yet.Also in the cast: Elizabeth Wilson, Peggy Pope, Sterling Hayden, Lawrence Pressman, Marian Mercer.Yes, that is Dolly Parton singing ""Nine To Five"".Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman also worked together in On Golden Pond (1981).Followed by the tv series Nine To Five (1982-83) with Rita Moreno as ""Violet"", Valerie Curtin as ""Judy"", and Rachel Dennison as ""Doralee"".

The theater was packed almost exclusively with women -- business suits and Reeboks, heels in tote bags: the office worker's uniform of the era.

Learning a lesson from the TV show All In The Family, humor can be used to nudge people into accepting new ideas.  And this is a funny, enjoyable and entertaining movie.What of the lessons.The primary message is of female rights in the work place.  By watching this movie, you can see some of the common sense notions that once marked the feminist movement.  How come no big 8 accounting fim had female partners?  Good question.  How come out of 50 directors of aetna, all were male.  The conditions of equal pay and protection from sexual harrassment have vastly improved since this movie was made.The second notion was more accomodating treatment of employees in the workplace.  Many employers are doing a better job now than when 9-5 first appeared.The third notion that unfortuneately has permeated society also is the lessons that ""normal people can do drugs and be very productive members of society"".  Edit out the drug use scene and this movie is suitable for family viewing.  I am not sure why the writers felt the need to present illegal drug use as something that normal people do, but it defineately takes away from the movies higher messages.For the comedy and the first 2 lessions of the movie I give 4 stars.  For showing maryjane use without negative consequence I give 2 stars for an average of 3.Much of the feminist movement has gone left of the positions staked out in this movie.",3,Retro Look at the Feminist movement,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,1514,"['When', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'America', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Learning', 'lesson', 'TV', 'show', 'All', 'Family', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'nudge', 'people', 'accepting', 'new', 'ideas', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'movie.What', 'lessons.The', 'primary', 'message', 'female', 'rights', 'work', 'place', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'common', 'sense', 'notions', 'once', 'marked', 'feminist', 'movement', 'How', 'come', 'big', '8', 'accounting', 'fim', 'had', 'female', 'partners', 'Good', 'question', 'How', 'come', '50', 'directors', 'aetna', 'were', 'male', 'conditions', 'equal', 'pay', 'protection', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'have', 'vastly', 'improved', 'movie', 'was', 'made.The', 'second', 'notion', 'was', 'more', 'accomodating', 'treatment', 'employees', 'workplace', 'Many', 'employers', 'are', 'doing', 'better', 'job', 'now', 'when', '9-5', 'first', 'appeared.The', 'third', 'notion', 'unfortuneately', 'permeated', 'society', 'also', 'lessons', 'normal', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'drugs', 'be', 'very', 'productive', 'members', 'society', 'Edit', 'out', 'drug', 'use', 'scene', 'movie', 'suitable', 'family', 'viewing', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'writers', 'felt', 'need', 'present', 'illegal', 'drug', 'use', 'something', 'normal', 'people', 'do', 'defineately', 'away', 'movies', 'higher', 'messages.For', 'comedy', 'first', '2', 'lessions', 'movie', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'showing', 'maryjane', 'use', 'negative', 'consequence', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'average', '3.Much', 'feminist', 'movement', 'gone', 'left', 'positions', 'staked', 'out', 'movie']",9 to 5 VHS

Each one of them plays such a different character but they all work so well together.This movie tells the story of three clerical workers in corporate America who have to endure a sexist boss (played perfectly by Dabney Coleman). Each of the main characters fantasize about getting their sweet revenge with their boss. And one day, due to a freak accident (caused by Violet) they actually live out their fantasy! Mr. Heart (the boss) hears of how he was ""poisoned"" from his 2-faced cohort Roz (played by Elizabeth Wilson) who was only too happy to repeat the gossip that she overheard. By the way, doesn't everyone have a coworker like Roz?? The movie then takes on a twist of black comedy and poetic justice when Judy, Violet & Doralee decide to tie up Mr. Hart and hold him prisoner while they find enough dirt on him so they can blackmail him. It's then a race for time for the ladies to keep Hart tied up and out of sight. Fortunately, Mr. Hart's wife is on a cruise but Roz is still lurking about. After the ladies concoct a scheme to send Roz away for a few weeks their true magic really starts to happen! They enact several policies that were groundbreaking for their time: an alcohol rehabilitation program, equal pay & a daycare center!The company had never seen such growth and it was all due to Doralee, Judy & Violet. Unfortunately, Mr. Hart manages to finally break out of his ""prison"" and gets back to the office just in time to see the company's CEO who wants to congratulate. Of course Mr. Hart is more than happy to take ALL of the credit for ALL of the work that he did not do. The CEO decides to promote him! Mr. Hart was shipped out to Brazil without a second thought!

And despite all the changes in the world, the world of work is still just as grim as the movie suggests.  How well the three stars interact!  Many have commented on how Jane Fonda, the movie's producer and the biggest star present, seems to enjoy playing a dowdy-type nebbish and taking a backseat to the bigger personalities of Tomlin and Parton, but she has got some wonderful scenes on her own.  Just to contrast, there's the pathetic scene when she comes home from her first horrible day at work and finds her husband at the apartment door. It's all in her face, the momentary hope that he's back, and then the disillusionment when instead he hands her the divorce papers, while his new girlfriend sits out front by the curb in his sportscar.  Her absurd little corsage doesn't wilt, but her spirit does, though she tries to keep her cool.Joan Fontaine in Letter to an Unknown Woman didn't do that kind of acting any better than Fonda here.  But Jane also shines in the all-out Lucy Ricardo comedy when the monstrous Xerox machine goes out of control, spitting all colors of paper out at her and all she can do is keep shuffling them and trying to match their corners.  In fact it's a scene worthy of Chaplin.  Lily Tomlin has the fiery part, but her best scenes are at home, accepting a joint from her teenage son while she fixes the garage door opener on a stepladder.  Ditto with Dolly complaining to her husband that the other girls treat her like she's trash, and she doesn't know why.  ""It's because you're so pretty,"" he tells her, and she protests, but she likes to hear that, doesn't she?  I guess I like the movie because of its incisive picture of office life, and because of the spirit that its leading players (and even its supporting actors, like, is that Marian Mercer as Hart's wife?) give to the show.

It takes a look at the workplace from a woman's view.We first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them.  She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it.  Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office.  She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living.  Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is ""banging the boss"".But the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train.  She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he's been having an affair with Doralee.  And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond.Each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss.  Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey.  Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit.  But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart.The next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee.  When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him.  This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse.The next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up.  The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart.  Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence.  The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence.  Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart's absence.  Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else's glory.The subject matter here is very serious.  So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly.  This is a film that many people identify with.  Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them.  And this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors.  You will laugh until it hurts.DVD EXTRAS:Commentary by producer Bruce Gilbert and stars Lily, Jane and Dolly9 to 5 @ 25 - a 25 minute featurette with interviews with Gilbert, writer director Colin Higgins and stars Lily.

226316,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,6300247236,Nicholas Carroll,"[77, 85]","This film is one of the rare achievements in comedy: I can watch this over and over (and I have) and still laugh at the same parts. The jokes never wear out after a viewing or two. That's due in part to the excellent camaraderie between Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton. I simply can't imagine this film without any of those three, for they made their roles what it is and the interractions between the three of them are hilarious. Dabney Coleman as their sexist boss with an extremely naive wife is also hilarious as he gets his comeuppance.Jane Fonda plays a mousy lady who enters the work force after her husband runs off with his secretary. Seeing her flustered by the photocopier is hilarious and it's fun to watch her transformation into a confident lady who can hold her own (gun) against the boss.Lily Tomlin plays the lady who's been at the company for a long time and is passed over for a rightful promotion because she's a woman. I love her scene when she schemes to steal a body from the hospital, mistakingly thinking it's her boss's dead body. When she's in a doctor's white coat and a candy striper stops her and apologizes when she realizes she's interrupting a doctor, Lily says, ""that's right, I'm a doctor...so why the hell am I talking to you?""Dolly Parton plays the secretary who uses her God-given endowment to humorous effect. Dabney Coleman can't help to push pencil holders off his desk so she can bend down and pick them up while he gets to sneak a peak. It was this film that has made me a lifelong fan of Dolly Parton because I love how she rebukes her boss by telling him that she put up with his behavior because of the way she was brought up and won't tolerate it anymore and if he messes with her, she'll gladly turn him ""from a rooster to a hen in one shot!"" I especially loves how she tells him, ""I never thought I'd live to say this about another human being, but you are evil, that's right, EVIL TO THE CORE!"" Yow! She means business, but it only makes the boss more turned on, so she has to back her words with deeds, thus fulfilling her fantasy sequence.The dream sequences are hilarious and it is interesting to see the way they each come true. I love Lily Tomlin's Disney-esque dream sequence, the one that causes the most problems. While the movie does veer off in a surprising way, and some might say outlandishly unrealistic, and while one reviewer mentioned that it doesn't end with a ""big bang"", I think the ending was delightfully ironic. The ladies improved the office environment, no one missed the boss, someone even higher up noticed the improvements and justice prevailed. Beautiful!I was only a kid when I saw this film in theaters and it has been one of few films where the humor never gets old. Anytime I need a laugh, I can rely on this film to provide them despite the numerous times I've seen it. That's a credit to everyone involved in making this film, but most especially to the three actresses who really play well off each other with comedic brilliance! I'm glad they have released a special edition, as I waited to buy it on DVD for just such an edition.

There's also Roz--the company spy, and the gossip mill with poeple of the office thinking Dolly--the boss' secretary--is sleeping with him.After a ""great"" day at the office, 3 women get ticked off, leave early and head to the local bar (sounds like where I work, except heaven forbid you leave the office early without being docked and given a warning for leaving early unexpectedly.)

Not only was it her first movie, but many ardent Dolly fans have said it was her best work on film. The film garnered Miss Parton an Oscar nomination as Best Original Song, as well as two Grammys.Jane Fonda wanted to do a film about female office workers who get back at their egotistical and arrogant boss. Patricia Resnick, who also wrote Dolly's film ""Straight Talk"", penned the ""9 to 5"" script. It was through Jane's production company that ""9 to 5"" was produced. Jane knew she wanted both Lily Tomlin and Dolly for the roles of the other two secretaries that she would be playing alongside, and the result was one of the best trios ever in movie making. Their chemistry is right on, and as a result ""9 to 5"" has gone on to be a Hollywood classic. The script by Resnick is near perfect, and the supoorting roles, most notably Dabney Coleman who plays the boss Mr. Hartt, is superb. Sit back and enjoy a true funny and hilarious movie that has never aged, despite being made in 1980.Dolly is also producing a Broadway production called ""9 to 5 -The Musical"", in which she wrote the entire score, and the script has been written by Patricia Resnick.

As the senior supervisor of Consolidated, Violet does most of the work and gets none of the credit. Without a college degree, despite her great brain and ample work knowledge, she is passed over time and time again for promotion. Lily Tomlin realistically and humorously portrays this character so well that it's astounding. Her interactions with Franklin Hart (played by the quietly brilliant Dabney Coleman) are absolutely dead-on 1980 (and before) scenes that could have occurred in any office. My mom said she was falling over laughing in the theater (she went to see it in 1980 when it was originally out) because it was all so true-to-life.Jane Fonda is equally believable, if not as likeable, as the other actors here. Her character, a mousy and long-married woman dealing with both a new job and an old marriage breaking up, is the naive one here. Not a bad portrayal, just not as interesting as the others.Dolly Parton shines in her first movie role. She elevates this movie, with both her fabulous theme song and her Southern charm. I kid you not, there are some brains behind that beauty. She is a total natural and perhaps even funnier in this movie than Lily Tomlin (a difficult feat, and nearly impossible for a new actress). Dolly's time with Dabney Coleman is funny, charming and just plain special.To the viewer, it may seem dated and perhaps just a vestage of our mothers' working world. But while some things change, some things stay the same. The glass-ceiling-pink-collar-ghetto still exists, it's just not as blatant and it's covered up under a lot of politically correct hogwash. If you work, you'll relate to this movie. It may be old, but it's still funny and still has a lot of relevance in today's world.",5,Fantastic true-to-life office job movie,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,2016,"['9', '5', 'there', 'Working', 'Girl', 'Office', 'Space', 'presenting', 'office', 'worker', 'plight', 'also', 'showing', 'seriously', 'hysterical', 'humor.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'represented', 'mom', 'best', 'cinema', 'Violet', 'Newstead', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'character', 'senior', 'supervisor', 'Consolidated', 'Violet', 'most', 'work', 'none', 'credit', 'college', 'degree', 'great', 'brain', 'ample', 'work', 'knowledge', 'passed', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'promotion', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'realistically', 'humorously', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'astounding', 'interactions', 'Franklin', 'Hart', 'played', 'quietly', 'brilliant', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'are', 'absolutely', 'dead-on', '1980', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'occurred', 'office', 'mom', 'said', 'was', 'falling', 'over', 'laughing', 'theater', 'went', 'see', '1980', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'true-to-life.Jane', 'Fonda', 'equally', 'believable', 'not', 'likeable', 'other', 'actors', 'here', 'Her', 'character', 'mousy', 'long-married', 'woman', 'dealing', 'new', 'job', 'old', 'marriage', 'breaking', 'up', 'naive', 'one', 'here', 'Not', 'bad', 'portrayal', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'others.Dolly', 'Parton', 'shines', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'theme', 'song', 'Southern', 'charm', 'kid', 'not', 'are', 'brains', 'beauty', 'total', 'natural', 'perhaps', 'even', 'funnier', 'movie', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'difficult', 'feat', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'new', 'actress', 'Dolly', 'time', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'funny', 'charming', 'just', 'plain', 'special.To', 'viewer', 'may', 'seem', 'dated', 'perhaps', 'just', 'vestage', 'mothers', 'working', 'world', 'things', 'change', 'things', 'stay', 'same', 'glass-ceiling-pink-collar-ghetto', 'still', 'just', 'not', 'blatant', 'covered', 'up', 'lot', 'politically', 'correct', 'hogwash', 'work', ""'ll"", 'relate', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'old', 'still', 'funny', 'still', 'lot', 'relevance', 'today', 'world']",9 to 5 VHS

I am confining my review to the extras on this new release as most people have seen and know what this movie is about. Yes, the movie itself stands on it's on as deserving a dvd release BUT it is SOO wonderful that they have put out all these great extras on the new release!  It is wonderful to see Jane,Lily & Dolly interviewed about the making of this film, as well as all of the deleted scenes, the hysterical gag reel and of course the commentary.  I would recommend watching the movie with the commentary on as it is the best way to learn what the trio have to say about the movie, their costars and themselves and all of the behind-the-scenes ""dish"".  Although if you're looking for backstabbing divas you will be disappointed as they have nothing but fun, positive memories to share about making this film.  They do still talk about a sequel which is almost hard to believe that they could do because it would be hard to top this movie.  A nice piece that is included is about Colin Higgins, the writer/director of the film.  They obviously adored and had great respect for this man.  It was nice to see him get some recognition, even if he has passed.By the way, from looking at the recent reunion pictures for this special release, don't they all 3 still look great?Buy this movie for the laughs and the spectacular special features.",5,Fantastic Re-release,1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,1427,"[""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'Fox', 're-released', 'great', 'movie', 'all-time', 'classic', 'am', 'confining', 'review', 'extras', 'new', 'release', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'Yes', 'movie', 'deserving', 'dvd', 'release', 'BUT', 'SOO', 'wonderful', 'have', 'put', 'out', 'great', 'extras', 'new', 'release', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Jane', 'Lily', 'Dolly', 'interviewed', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'hysterical', 'gag', 'reel', 'course', 'commentary', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'commentary', 'best', 'way', 'learn', 'what', 'trio', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'costars', 'behind-the-scenes', 'dish', ""'re"", 'looking', 'backstabbing', 'divas', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'have', 'nothing', 'fun', 'positive', 'memories', 'share', 'making', 'film', 'do', 'still', 'talk', 'sequel', 'almost', 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'top', 'movie', 'nice', 'piece', 'included', 'Colin', 'Higgins', 'writer/director', 'film', 'obviously', 'adored', 'had', 'great', 'respect', 'man', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'get', 'recognition', 'even', 'passed.By', 'way', 'looking', 'recent', 'reunion', 'pictures', 'special', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", '3', 'still', 'look', 'great', 'Buy', 'movie', 'laughs', 'spectacular', 'special', 'features']",9 to 5 VHS

What!?!I haven't bought a DVD in a long time that was just in stereo.I was looking forward to hearing Dolly in 5.1 surround sound sing 9 to 5.  :(The film transfer was also dissapoiting.  It looks like they didn't even bother to restore the film, they just cleaned it up a bit and threw it on the computer to be digitized.The special features are also very lacking.  The commentary with the ladies is great, the featurette is good but that's pretty much it.There's a few other things, but come on.  It's 25 years old and you just throw the DVD together?

Needless to say it doesn't any longer!:)All of the cast is excellent and the theme song is one of Dolly Parton's best. On a more serious note, what I find particularly valuable is its presentation of life in low-paid work. Many of the situations can be found in the working place today and the film handles them with the right mix of seriousness and humour. In fact, I use anecdotes from the movie when teaching my students about the Industrial Revolution (especially about Roz, ""the eyes, ears, nose and throat of the boss"".)

I expected alot from this DVD as I heard it had alot of extras and a brand new remastered transfer. Well only half my expectations were met. The extras were great, they included deleted scenes, audio commentary, featurettes and more. The only problem was with the supposed new remastered transfer. When compared to the previous bare bones copy, it just didn't stack up. I did notice that alot of the cracks and pops were removed but the film was very dark. Where as the older transfer was very bright. Another thing I noticed was the audio track on the new transfer sounded very distorted and muffled. I quickly send this DVD back as I wasn't having this awful transfer. When you purchase this DVD you have to think to yourself, what is more important the movie transfer or the extras it provides. With me, the extras just wasn't enough to make me keep this DVD.
