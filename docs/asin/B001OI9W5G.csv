My last sentence comes across very sad to even me as there really isn't a story to speak of, only a threadbare plot. If you were wondering whether this was Christian reclaiming of the Arthur legend, it kind of is, but holds no resemblance to it other than the names.  There isn't significant writing in this and it shows in how the characters seem separated from each other throughtout.  There are no genuine connections in the movie whatsoever even the critical relationship from father to son.  The closest they get is a tangental connection between Pendragon and his kidnapped sister, which is barely there. The reason it's so sad is because the movie is close to 2 hours long, features diverse elements of light and dark, beauty and ugliness, peace and violence...and love. The film never develops any of these elements into something substantial, or entertaining.  Just because you don't have a budget doesn't mean you don't have good writing, or other good elements.  Many wildly entertaining movies are of low budget, but high quality, here we have use of digital technology that only serves to distance the film from any emotional depth.  It doesn't have to be that way as I've seen numerous digital films that worked wonderfully, but this one seemed particularly anemic.  The additional dialoue recording done for this film was both extensive and weak.  A number of scenes are barely audible as they are hushed and whispered. This movie is the quintessential argument against the Godard method of not shooting with a script. It seems rushed, poorly made, and having no genuine anchor for the audience to attach itself to.  If they had a script, well, I hope that next time (if there is one) they come with a better one in hand.  If they do it will be an expensive lesson learned.  May Christian film live on, get better, and forget this failure that shows faint hope.",1,There's nothing in this film to recommend to anyone....,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,1967,"['maybe', 'sincere', 'Christian', 'message', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'secondary', 'story', 'last', 'sentence', 'very', 'sad', 'even', 'really', ""n't"", 'story', 'speak', 'only', 'threadbare', 'plot', 'were', 'wondering', 'was', 'Christian', 'reclaiming', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'kind', 'resemblance', 'other', 'names', ""n't"", 'significant', 'writing', 'how', 'characters', 'seem', 'separated', 'other', 'throughtout', 'are', 'genuine', 'connections', 'movie', 'whatsoever', 'even', 'critical', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'closest', 'get', 'tangental', 'connection', 'Pendragon', 'kidnapped', 'sister', 'barely', 'there', 'reason', 'so', 'sad', 'movie', 'close', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'features', 'diverse', 'elements', 'light', 'dark', 'beauty', 'ugliness', 'peace', 'violence', 'love', 'film', 'never', 'elements', 'something', 'substantial', 'entertaining', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'writing', 'other', 'good', 'elements', 'Many', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'high', 'quality', 'here', 'have', 'use', 'digital', 'technology', 'only', 'distance', 'film', 'emotional', 'depth', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'numerous', 'digital', 'films', 'worked', 'wonderfully', 'one', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'anemic', 'additional', 'dialoue', 'recording', 'done', 'film', 'was', 'extensive', 'weak', 'number', 'scenes', 'are', 'barely', 'audible', 'are', 'hushed', 'whispered', 'movie', 'quintessential', 'argument', 'Godard', 'method', 'not', 'shooting', 'script', 'rushed', 'poorly', 'made', 'having', 'genuine', 'anchor', 'audience', 'attach', 'had', 'script', 'well', 'hope', 'next', 'time', 'one', 'come', 'better', 'one', 'hand', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'expensive', 'lesson', 'learned', 'May', 'Christian', 'film', 'live', 'get', 'better', 'forget', 'failure', 'faint', 'hope']",Pendragon: Sword Of His Father

And the Christian message is sincere. But the acting is absolutely the worst I've seen in just about any movie over the past twenty or so years; especially in this genre. Clive Owen in 'King Arthur' also has a Christian message, but he can act, and so can EVERYONE else in that movie. In this one, I can't find a single genuine actor.

The message in this movie about a warrior who relies on God for his strength is really bold.  The main character in the film is constantly quoting verses which give him strength in time of trouble.  As far as the bad effects and cinematography, it was not as bad as I expected.  I mean most Christian films are really low budget.  This one had some decent fight scenes or maybe you just get used to not seeing the blood and gore the farther you go along in the movie.  I believe the movie still made its point with the fight scenes, but we are just so used to seeing the gore as a society that it was kind of weird without it.  However, this also makes it more watchable for younger kids.  The story had quite a few twist in it that I did not expect; however if this is based on a true story, these twist would show the ultimate faithfulness of God to his followers.  I highly recommend the movie.  I love historical type films, and this entertained me.

It  had  a  great  script  and  it  had  a  great  Christian  message.  The  photography  is  good  although  there  were  some  places  where  it  could  have  been  done  better,  and  it  could  have  been  edited  better  in  a  few  spots.  The  sets  were  very  well  build.  However,  there  are  things  that  literally  kill  this  film.  Except  for  a  few  people,  the  acting  was  horrific.

As  for  the  fight  scenes,  they  were  totally  horrible  with  the  exception  of  the  final  fight  scene.  That  was  done  well.  The  video  effects  cold  have  been  better.  Action  movies  normally  cannot  be  done  well  on  a  low  budget.  Most  Christian  movies  are  horrible,  and  I  do  applaud  the  Burns  family  for  making  the  attempt  to  do  a  great  movie,  but  bad  acting  and  horrible  fight  scenes  will  not  get  this  fil  very  far.

What an awesome film! It is very well done and has faith components woven throughout. It's also packed with adventure and a great plot.

I also appreciate that tweens (approximately age 10 or 11) and up can watch it (no younger children due to the fighting sequences) without the worry of inappropriate content.

Some of the acting needs a bit more polish to truly be considered professional but the movie on the whole does seem well done as far as cinematography, costumes, etc. While none of our sons asked to see it again, I think they will later on.

When the characters encourage each other or remind each other of God's calling in their lives, the dialogue is realistic.
