Burt,"[1, 1]","My five-year-old loved the original book by Kate and Jim McMullan, so when I saw a video adaptation at our local library, I grabbed for it immediately.The video was a very respectful adaptation of Jim McMullan's original illustrations, with the garbage truck speaking in a perfect gravelly voice provided by Andy Richter.  The little guy loved that, too.And then we moved on to the rest of the disk, and other delights which included a special favorite from my own childhood, ""Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel"".Tonight, the little guy asked if he could watch ""the garbage truck video"" again, and I had to admit that we had borrowed it from the library, and would have to see if we could check it out again.But clearly this is a sign that we need to buy our own copy right quick.",4,But the DVD Doesn't,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,780,"['five-year-old', 'loved', 'original', 'book', 'Kate', 'Jim', 'McMullan', 'when', 'saw', 'video', 'adaptation', 'local', 'library', 'grabbed', 'immediately.The', 'video', 'was', 'very', 'respectful', 'adaptation', 'Jim', 'McMullan', 'original', 'illustrations', 'garbage', 'truck', 'speaking', 'perfect', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'provided', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'little', 'guy', 'loved', 'then', 'moved', 'rest', 'disk', 'other', 'delights', 'included', 'special', 'favorite', 'own', 'childhood', 'Mike', 'Mulligan', 'Steam', 'Shovel', '.Tonight', 'little', 'guy', 'asked', 'could', 'watch', 'garbage', 'truck', 'video', 'again', 'had', 'admit', 'had', 'borrowed', 'library', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'could', 'check', 'out', 'again.But', 'clearly', 'sign', 'need', 'buy', 'own', 'copy', 'right', 'quick']",I Stink !...and more stories on wheels
1226989,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B001PHA6PQ,Justin G.,"[14, 14]","My son absolutely loves the bookI Stink!, so when I saw this animated version available, I knew it would be right up his alley. The folks at Schoolastic have a great track record when it comes to animating classic children's books, and this is no exception. I Stink was animated in a way that perfectly compliments the book's illustrations, and Conan sidekick Andy Richter does a fantastic job giving voice to the ""all-attitude, all the time"" garbage truck. The animated version of I Stink is almost as huge a hit with my son as the book.The DVD also includes a few other animated adaptations that (sort of) carry on the garbage truck theme. Trashy Town is the only other garbage-themed story on the DVD, but with its simple animation and catchy ""chorus"" it went over really well. The others are hit and miss. Arnie the Doughnut was funny and a little disturbing (it's about a sentient pastry aware of his imminent demise), but The Beast of Monsieur Racine was just a little too weird.I'd absolutely recommend the I Stink DVD to anyone whose child(ren) enjoyed the book. It's a fun collection of animated stories, and a welcome break from Elmo, the Wiggles, etc.",4,"Great adaptation of the book, and a few other surprises",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1162,"['son', 'absolutely', 'bookI', 'Stink', 'when', 'saw', 'animated', 'version', 'available', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'folks', 'Schoolastic', 'have', 'great', 'track', 'record', 'when', 'animating', 'classic', 'children', 'books', 'exception', 'Stink', 'was', 'animated', 'way', 'perfectly', 'book', 'illustrations', 'Conan', 'sidekick', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'fantastic', 'job', 'giving', 'voice', 'all-attitude', 'time', 'garbage', 'truck', 'animated', 'version', 'Stink', 'almost', 'huge', 'hit', 'son', 'book.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'few', 'other', 'animated', 'adaptations', 'sort', 'carry', 'garbage', 'truck', 'theme', 'Trashy', 'Town', 'only', 'other', 'garbage-themed', 'story', 'DVD', 'simple', 'animation', 'catchy', 'chorus', 'went', 'really', 'well', 'others', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'Arnie', 'Doughnut', 'was', 'funny', 'little', 'disturbing', 'sentient', 'pastry', 'aware', 'imminent', 'demise', 'Beast', 'Monsieur', 'Racine', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'weird.I', ""'d"", 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'Stink', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'child', 'ren', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'fun', 'collection', 'animated', 'stories', 'welcome', 'break', 'Elmo', 'Wiggles', 'etc']",I Stink !...and more stories on wheels

It has several different stories and the option of having the ""read along"" captions at the bottom of the screen.  Both my boys watched this DVD from beginning to end. They told me they really liked all the stories and now like to watch the DVD while going through the physical books.

I suppose I can support it as long as he receives an exceptional education first ... for now, I think it's just cute.  He loves the &#34;I Stink&#34; (Andy Richter) and &#34;I'm Dirty&#34; (Steve Buscheme) books and movies.  The narrators are popular actors and they do a wonderful job.  The other stories included on the DVD are not as amazing, but it's a good bit of entertainment for a 4 yr old and if he enjoys it I am ok with that.  Also, the movies are fairly short, so the entire DVD is only about 40 minutes or so long.",5,Loved by my 4 yr old boy,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,671,"['do', 'not', 'look', 'down', 'profession', 'did', 'sort', 'cringe', 'when', 'son', 'said', 'be', 'dump', 'truck', 'driver', 'when', 'big', 'suppose', 'can', 'support', 'as', 'long', 'exceptional', 'education', 'first', 'now', 'think', 'just', 'cute', '34', 'Stink', '34', 'Andy', 'Richter', '34', ""'m"", 'Dirty', '34', 'Steve', 'Buscheme', 'books', 'movies', 'narrators', 'are', 'popular', 'actors', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'other', 'stories', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'amazing', 'good', 'bit', 'entertainment', '4', 'yr', 'old', 'am', 'ok', 'Also', 'movies', 'are', 'fairly', 'short', 'entire', 'DVD', 'only', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'long']",I Stink !...and more stories on wheels
