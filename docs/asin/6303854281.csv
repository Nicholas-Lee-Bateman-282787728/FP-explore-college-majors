When he does, Rickman commands the stage (literally and as part of the movie's plot). There is one particular look that Rickman shoots Hugh Grant's character that alone makes it worth watching the rest of the two-hour movie. Rickman's performance never falls below excellence and his portrayal of Hook is mesmerizing (and the bits that we see of his stage role are more powerful than even when Dustin Hoffman played the famous pirate in Hook.Georgina Cates' first major movie performance is impressive because she is able to match Rickman's intensity and bring about pure innocence to her character. Furthermore, at 20, she looks much younger than her 16-year-old character.Mike Newell's direction is impressive in this film. And the costumes are authentic for the period.Seeing the backstage of the late 1940s theater makes for an interesting drama, but more so makes the revelation more plausible, although it is highly predictable and as Dickensian as it is soap operaish. All, in all, a must-see film for anyone who has ever fallen under Rickman's spell.",3,"An Awfully Big Role for Rickman, which he handles extraordinarily well",1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,1295,"['Eager', 'more', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Die', 'Hard', 'AHarry', 'Potter', '1-5', 'goodness', 'watched', 'Awfully', 'Big', 'Adventure.Unfortunately', 'even', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'top', 'billing', 'picture', ""n't"", 'appear', 'good', 'half', 'hour', 'When', 'Rickman', 'stage', 'literally', 'part', 'movie', 'plot', 'one', 'particular', 'look', 'Rickman', 'shoots', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'character', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'rest', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'Rickman', 'performance', 'never', 'excellence', 'portrayal', 'Hook', 'mesmerizing', 'bits', 'see', 'stage', 'role', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'even', 'when', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'played', 'famous', 'pirate', 'Hook.Georgina', 'Cates', 'first', 'major', 'movie', 'performance', 'impressive', 'able', 'match', 'Rickman', 'intensity', 'bring', 'about', 'pure', 'innocence', 'character', 'Furthermore', '20', 'much', 'younger', '16-year-old', 'character.Mike', 'Newell', 'direction', 'impressive', 'film', 'costumes', 'are', 'authentic', 'period.Seeing', 'backstage', 'late', '1940s', 'theater', 'interesting', 'drama', 'more', 'so', 'revelation', 'more', 'plausible', 'highly', 'predictable', 'as', 'Dickensian', 'soap', 'operaish', 'must-see', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'fallen', 'Rickman', 'spell']",Awfully Big Adventure VHS
386804,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,6303854281,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 4]","Here is a film that enthusiastically supports the negative stereotypes of ""theatre people"" cherished by hod carriers, gravediggers, truck mechanics, and short order cooks.  It concerns a bottom of the barrel local stage company in post-war Liverpool, which functions as a repository of wretched refuse unable to find work in better venues.  Virtually every despised group is represented; the troupe is teeming with homosexuals, alcoholics, cruel narcissists, manipulative wretches, and those guilty of sex crimes involving minors both male and female.  We do not find people to like in this film, we only find people to pity - like Bunny, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Firth - and Stella, the tragically damaged and clueless protagonist.  Georgina Cates is thoroughly convincing as Stella, yet another young girl who flees a harsh reality for the theatre's comforting deceptions.I was amazed to discover that the trailer for this movie presented it as a comedy - Hamlet is funnier.  Even the illusion of happiness - the theatre's stock and trade - is missing.  What we have instead is a world where people play roles without knowing it, and are emotionally mugged in the process.  The ringleader of this horror show is Meredith Potter; Hugh Grant is exceptionally good.  (This movie was made before Grant found his niche as an affable cad and is certainly his best bit of acting ever.)  Potter is the apogee of upper class English entitlement gone to seed; he is clever, thoroughly decadent, lacking in anything remotely resembling a conscience, and pathetic - though his cruelty makes it impossible for us to scrape together a farthing of empathy, our revulsion prohibits it.The arrival of Alan Rickman - a consistently wonderful actor - as O'Hara, would seems to signal a battle of titans - admirable versus contemptible.  And while watching Rickman play Captain Hook is pure delight, his O'Hara skirts around Potter and drifts off into a somewhat, if not very, bizarre backstory involving Stella's shadowy past.  This derails the film and sends it off in a murky direction since it was never a who-done-it or a psychological thriller.  O'Hara's connection to Stella and her mother may give us an ""aha"" moment - but ultimately it's a distraction because it doesn't inform what's happened up to that point.  O'Hara has a grim realization that puts him in a very difficult position.  But in the final analysis, Stella is still a girl ""abandoned"" by her mother and raised by relatives who trades the sadness of real life and for the sadness of fantasy life.Good cinematography, good acting, poor pacing, and sloppy scripting.  Would have been far more interesting to see how a loathsome creature like Potter might create great theatre through the dynamic tension between himself and a range of competing personalities cut from finer cloth.",3,"Roar Of The Greasepaint, Smell Of The Crowd",1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2839,"['Here', 'film', 'enthusiastically', 'negative', 'stereotypes', 'theatre', 'people', 'cherished', 'hod', 'carriers', 'gravediggers', 'truck', 'mechanics', 'short', 'order', 'cooks', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'local', 'stage', 'company', 'post-war', 'Liverpool', 'repository', 'wretched', 'refuse', 'unable', 'find', 'work', 'better', 'venues', 'Virtually', 'despised', 'group', 'represented', 'troupe', 'teeming', 'homosexuals', 'alcoholics', 'cruel', 'narcissists', 'manipulative', 'wretches', 'guilty', 'sex', 'crimes', 'involving', 'minors', 'male', 'female', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'people', 'like', 'film', 'only', 'find', 'people', 'pity', 'Bunny', 'portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'Stella', 'tragically', 'damaged', 'clueless', 'protagonist', 'Georgina', 'Cates', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'Stella', 'yet', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'harsh', 'reality', 'theatre', 'comforting', 'deceptions.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'discover', 'trailer', 'movie', 'presented', 'comedy', 'Hamlet', 'funnier', 'Even', 'illusion', 'happiness', 'theatre', 'stock', 'trade', 'missing', 'What', 'have', 'instead', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'play', 'roles', 'knowing', 'are', 'emotionally', 'mugged', 'process', 'ringleader', 'horror', 'show', 'Meredith', 'Potter', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Grant', 'found', 'niche', 'affable', 'cad', 'certainly', 'best', 'bit', 'acting', 'ever', 'Potter', 'apogee', 'upper', 'class', 'English', 'entitlement', 'gone', 'seed', 'clever', 'thoroughly', 'decadent', 'lacking', 'anything', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'conscience', 'pathetic', 'cruelty', 'impossible', 'scrape', 'together', 'farthing', 'empathy', 'revulsion', 'it.The', 'arrival', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'consistently', 'wonderful', 'actor', ""O'Hara"", 'would', 'signal', 'battle', 'titans', 'admirable', 'versus', 'contemptible', 'watching', 'Rickman', 'play', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'pure', 'delight', ""O'Hara"", 'Potter', 'drifts', 'off', 'somewhat', 'not', 'very', 'bizarre', 'backstory', 'involving', 'Stella', 'shadowy', 'past', 'film', 'off', 'murky', 'direction', 'was', 'never', 'who-done-it', 'psychological', 'thriller', ""O'Hara"", 'connection', 'Stella', 'mother', 'may', 'give', 'aha', 'moment', 'ultimately', 'distraction', ""n't"", 'inform', 'what', 'happened', 'up', 'point', ""O'Hara"", 'grim', 'realization', 'very', 'difficult', 'position', 'final', 'analysis', 'Stella', 'still', 'girl', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'raised', 'relatives', 'who', 'sadness', 'real', 'life', 'sadness', 'fantasy', 'life.Good', 'cinematography', 'good', 'acting', 'poor', 'pacing', 'sloppy', 'scripting', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'loathsome', 'creature', 'Potter', 'might', 'create', 'great', 'theatre', 'dynamic', 'tension', 'range', 'competing', 'personalities', 'cut', 'finer', 'cloth']",Awfully Big Adventure VHS
386805,A1LMBOI3T91P87,6303854281,Allan M. Lees,"[9, 10]","In the days before Hugh Grant became a romantic comedy icon, it turns out that he could act, and act he does in this marvellous little vignette period-piece.  Here he plays an effete theater director with a penchant for picking up men and then discarding them in the cruellest possible manner. He has assembled, for a short repertory season in the Liverpool of 1957, a cast of has-beens, alcoholics, and other assorted misfits, including the naif fourtnee-year-old Stella who dreams of becoming a posh starlet.The supporting cast all turn in solid performances, but what really brings the film alive is when Alan Rickman steps into the story about one-third of the way in. This is Rickman in his prime: electrifying, nuanced, darkly compelling yet subtly self-mocking at the same time. It is exceedingly difficult for an actor to play an actor, because the ""visible ham"" element can too easily become, accidentally, ""risible ham.""  The entire cast generally manage to pull off this balancing act par excellence, but Rickman does it best of all.  He exudes sexuality even when dressed as Captain Hook in the pantomime version of Peter Pan. It's no surprise that several of the ladies of the cast would like to rekindle old acquaintances.But the Rickman character's tragic secret (he believes he has a son, born to him many years before by a woman he knew only as Stella Maris) turns Greek-tragedy like into his denouement.  The naif Stella, whom he seduces almost instantly because he is drawn to her by some alchemical attraction, turns out to be... none other than his daughter.  Struck by this Oedipal twist, Rickman puts in a performance that needs to be watched several times over to be fully appreciated.  In genuine grief and shock, his actor character takes recourse to cliched dramatic gesture.  At first I felt Rickman had missed the mark, but after re-watching the scene in question three times I came to appreciate exactly the effect he achieves.  The net result is to lend a painful pathos to his resultant demise by accidental drowning.So for anyone looking for a twisted version of Oedipus Rex set in post-war Britain, with all the class consciousness and stultifying conventions of the time here subverted in a most enjoyable manner, this awfully small adventure yields a big reward.",4,"Hugh Grant Acts, Shock Horror!",1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,2298,"['days', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'became', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'icon', 'out', 'could', 'act', 'act', 'marvellous', 'little', 'vignette', 'period-piece', 'Here', 'effete', 'theater', 'director', 'penchant', 'picking', 'up', 'men', 'then', 'discarding', 'cruellest', 'possible', 'manner', 'assembled', 'short', 'repertory', 'season', 'Liverpool', '1957', 'cast', 'has-beens', 'alcoholics', 'other', 'assorted', 'misfits', 'including', 'naif', 'fourtnee-year-old', 'Stella', 'who', 'becoming', 'posh', 'starlet.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'turn', 'solid', 'performances', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'alive', 'when', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'story', 'one-third', 'way', 'Rickman', 'prime', 'electrifying', 'nuanced', 'darkly', 'compelling', 'yet', 'subtly', 'self-mocking', 'same', 'time', 'exceedingly', 'difficult', 'actor', 'play', 'actor', 'visible', 'ham', 'element', 'can', 'too', 'easily', 'become', 'accidentally', 'risible', 'ham', 'entire', 'cast', 'generally', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'balancing', 'act', 'par', 'excellence', 'Rickman', 'best', 'sexuality', 'even', 'when', 'dressed', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'pantomime', 'version', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'surprise', 'several', 'ladies', 'cast', 'would', 'like', 'rekindle', 'old', 'Rickman', 'character', 'tragic', 'secret', 'son', 'born', 'many', 'years', 'woman', 'knew', 'only', 'Stella', 'Maris', 'Greek-tragedy', 'denouement', 'naif', 'Stella', 'whom', 'almost', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'alchemical', 'attraction', 'out', 'be', 'none', 'other', 'daughter', 'Struck', 'Oedipal', 'twist', 'Rickman', 'performance', 'be', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'genuine', 'grief', 'shock', 'actor', 'character', 'recourse', 'cliched', 'dramatic', 'gesture', 'first', 'felt', 'Rickman', 'had', 'missed', 'mark', 're-watching', 'scene', 'question', 'three', 'times', 'came', 'appreciate', 'exactly', 'effect', 'net', 'result', 'lend', 'painful', 'pathos', 'resultant', 'demise', 'accidental', 'drowning.So', 'anyone', 'looking', 'twisted', 'version', 'Oedipus', 'Rex', 'set', 'post-war', 'Britain', 'class', 'consciousness', 'stultifying', 'conventions', 'time', 'here', 'subverted', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'manner', 'awfully', 'small', 'adventure', 'yields', 'big', 'reward']",Awfully Big Adventure VHS

386807,A2ELT9NS0Q8W9L,6303854281,babydoh,"[15, 15]","First and foremost, I want to state that this is NOT a comedy.  The summary on the back of the box, describing it as ""hilarious,"" ""warmhearted,"" and so forth, reads as though it was written by somebody who never saw the movie.  It is about as much of a comedy as Hamlet is a go-kart race.That said, it is a super film.  Set in 1947, the story centers on sixteen-year-old Stella Bradshaw, who has lost her mother in the war and lives with her aunt and uncle.  Stella joins an amateur theatre company and falls instantly in love with the company's slimeball of a director, Meredith Potter.  It doesn't take long for her to be lured into the milieu's seedy underbelly, and eventually she has her first (and second and third...) sexual encounter with P.L. O'Hara, star of the company's production of ""Peter Pan"".The end of the movie will certainly be found disturbing and/or sad by most (hence my omission of the fifth star in rating the movie), but it's still worth watching - most likely more than once, so you can start to fill in the details you might have missed before.  (There's a whole lot of information packed into this plot, and it's very easy to let stuff slip by!)The cast, of course, is wonderful.  Georgina Cates is well cast as Stella, and very pretty too.  Her characterization of the shy, unsure-of-herself girl is engaging and well thought out.  (She looks about twelve until a scene where we see her topless.  Then the illusion is pretty much shattered.) Alan Rickman, as P.L. O'Hara, is great as usual.  The big surprise here for me was Hugh Grant's performance as Meredith Potter.  He is actually playing a character here - and a nasty one at that.  That alone is worth watching the movie!  The supporting cast is terrific as well.  It was fun to see such first-rate actors bringing such life to such teeny roles (for example, Edward Petherbridge, who has all of approximately fifteen seconds onscreen).To sum up, An Awfully Big Adventure - though certainly disturbing in places - is an awfully good film.",4,Great film...highly inaccurate synopsis,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,2023,"['First', 'foremost', 'want', 'state', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'summary', 'back', 'box', 'describing', 'hilarious', 'warmhearted', 'so', 'forth', 'was', 'written', 'somebody', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'comedy', 'Hamlet', 'go-kart', 'race.That', 'said', 'super', 'film', 'Set', '1947', 'story', 'centers', 'sixteen-year-old', 'Stella', 'Bradshaw', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', 'war', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'Stella', 'amateur', 'theatre', 'company', 'instantly', 'love', 'company', 'slimeball', 'director', 'Meredith', 'Potter', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'be', 'lured', 'milieu', 'seedy', 'underbelly', 'eventually', 'first', 'second', 'third', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'P.L', ""O'Hara"", 'star', 'company', 'production', 'Peter', 'Pan', '.The', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'found', 'disturbing', 'and/or', 'sad', 'most', 'hence', 'omission', 'fifth', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'most', 'likely', 'more', 'once', 'can', 'start', 'fill', 'details', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'before', 'whole', 'lot', 'information', 'packed', 'plot', 'very', 'easy', 'let', 'stuff', 'slip', 'cast', 'course', 'wonderful', 'Georgina', 'Cates', 'well', 'cast', 'Stella', 'very', 'pretty', 'too', 'characterization', 'shy', 'unsure-of-herself', 'girl', 'engaging', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'twelve', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'topless', 'Then', 'illusion', 'pretty', 'much', 'shattered', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'P.L', ""O'Hara"", 'great', 'usual', 'big', 'surprise', 'here', 'was', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'performance', 'Meredith', 'Potter', 'actually', 'playing', 'character', 'here', 'nasty', 'one', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'terrific', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'such', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'bringing', 'such', 'life', 'such', 'teeny', 'roles', 'example', 'Edward', 'Petherbridge', 'who', 'approximately', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'onscreen', '.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Awfully', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'certainly', 'disturbing', 'places', 'awfully', 'good', 'film']",Awfully Big Adventure VHS
386808,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,6303854281,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","Every now and then a movie comes along that the people distributing the film have no idea how to promote. When that happens the best thing to do is to label it a ""comedy"" especially if it features someone like Hugh Grant who specializes in the genre. Other movies that this has happened to include Bill Forsyth's HOUSEKEEPING (1987) and the 2007 film LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. While there are comic moments, these films are essentially dramas with a dark side which do not appeal to nearly as many people. Once the studios have your money there's almost always a backlash for the film not being what was advertised. That certainly applies to AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE which was promoted as if it were another NOTTING HILL or BRIDGET JONES' DIARY. Nothing could be further from the truth but don't let that stop you from seeing what may be Hugh Grant's finest performance and a real change of pace for Alan Rickman. Just ignore the mislabelling and jump right in.Director Mike Newell has always made films that have a literary quality to them which comes as no surprise since most of his movies (THE AWAKENING, HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE, the recent GREAT EXPECTATIONS to name 3) are adaptaions of books. He concentrates on characters and dialogue and as a result his movies have a very deliberate pace and his choice of material is often quite dark in tone. Those already familiar with his work will be ahead of the game but others should take the plunge so that they can discover the wonderfully self-contained worlds that his movies allow us to visit. Other films of his worth investigating or revisiting include the well known FOUR WEDDINGS & A FUNERAL, the wonderfully acted ENCHANTED APRIL, and the remarkable DONNIE BRASCO.AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE is set in post World War II Liverpool and tells the coming-of-age story of a young girl who gets involved with a second rate theater troupe and the people who are part of it. They are led by a classic old school ""queen"" played by Hugh Grant who has a waspish tongue and designs on the male members of the company much to the consternation of his long suffering partner (Peter Firth). Our naive young heroine Stella (Georgina Cates) doesn't realize he's gay at first and idolizes him and when that illusion is shattered, she takes up with the company's Don Juan (Alan Rickman) who sees her as just another conquest until he develops feelings for her. This leads to an amazing discovery and a remarkable ending. The title of the film comes from a line in PETER PAN which the troupe performs throughout the movie. Full of comic moments, ADVENTURE is definitely not a comedy. Like most coming-of-age stories it has its share of pain and self-discovery. The final shot is remarkable in its poignancy.

In fact, by the end, you may want a tissue (I know I needed one).Second of all, I bought this film because of my intense desire to own as many movies with Alan Rickman in them. Mr. Rickman has exceptional talent and brings any character he plays to life as well as bringing something of himself to the roll. I would also like to point out that Hugh Grant does a great job of playing the sleazy director Meredith Potter.Georgina Cates plays Stella, a young girl who joins the theater and develops a crush on the heartless Potter (Grant), who only has eyes for boys. At first, I thought Stella wasn't very smart, but I think it is more that she is very naive of the world around her. She is unaware that the reason Potter doesn't notice her is because of his interest in boys. Enter P.L. O'Hara(played brilliantly by Rickman), who seems to recognize her from the start. Because Stella is so eager to be like the others(wears a cross because she heard all the actors were Catholic and tries to fake V.D.), she practically ""gives"" herself to O'Hara.This film has a very tragic ending(hence the tissues), but I found that I liked this film(even though you don't see Rickman until at least halfway through). I give this film 4 stars based mainly on the performances, but I feel calling this film a comedy, when it clearly isn't, robbed this film of 5 stars. If you are a fan of Rickman's (or Grant's), do not hesitate in buying this film. But if you are looking for a comedy then you will be disappointed.

386813,A29VKODW4R5U7W,6303854281,dooby,"[137, 141]","This is an excellent film, moving, sad, even tragic. It is NOT a ""warm hearted comedy,"" as it says on the back of the DVD. And it certainly is not ""hilarious"". The blurb on the cover is quite possibly the most misleading I have ever come across. Despite that, it is a lovely film. It is a solid, serious British drama, with an excellent all round cast. The humour where present is decidedly low key. Its predominant mood is one of sadness and loss, there is warmth to be sure, but certainly not what is projected on the cover or in the trailer. One wonders why the publicists chose to so misrepresent such a fine film. Was it because they were worried its serious and even dark nature would put off the popcorn munchers? Perhaps it would have been better if they had. Then we wouldn't have been saddled with so many negative reviews from viewers who naturally felt short-changed. Then again, this is not a movie that American audiences would readily take to.Set in 1947, it tells the story of a 16 year old girl, Stella (Georgina Cates), abandoned at birth by a wayward mother and brought up by her aunt and uncle, who aspires to join the Theatre. Into this milieu she willingly plunges herself. She encounters sordid seedy characters. She takes on menial tasks without pay. She embraces all with a gushing eager naivete. She falls for the stage director (Hugh Grant) who in her young innocence she doesn't realise actually has a preference for boys. She then latches on to an aging Lothario (Alan Rickman) who does appreciate young girls. In this darkness in which she finds herself, past and present intersect. The absent mother she faithfully places a call to everyday, the same mother who gave her away years ago, becomes the silent confidant of her hopes and fears. The aging Rickman character constantly pines for his own past even as he happily deflowers the young girl. The stage director's sordid history of seducing and then spurning young men finally comes to a head. All combine to create an air of loss and decay. A nice touch was the use of a lone flute playing ""The Last Rose Of Summer"" whenever the Rickman character thinks back to his lost love. If you know the song, it perfectly encapsulates the mood of this movie. And yes there is a twist at the end, but if you have been paying attention, it won't come as too much of a shock. Although the prudes and the self-righteous will as usual recoil in moral outrage.New Line Entertainment has given us a fine if bare-bones DVD. The film is transferred in it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). Picure quality is good, clean and clear with natural warm colors. Black levels are just right. Audio includes the original stereo plus both DTS and Dolby 5.1 remixes. Excellent presentation. There are even optional English subtitles for people who can't get round the British accents.

I did love --and still do--the acting in this movie, particularly Rickman. So, I watched it again recently, on a larger screen.  It's actually a really good film. It's very moody, but now I realize that the character depiction is realistic and not patronizing. Some characters are unsophisticated and naive, but on second viewing it doesn't seem a value judgment by the filmmakers. The lead character is very young, innocent, guileless, and dealing the best she can with her abandonment by her mother, not painfully dimwitted, as I thought five years ago. This is a period piece (post WWII) and the production values are superb. Is it a comedy or a tragedy? Both. It's British and maybe a bit quirky by American standards, but it's quite good.

386819,A106016KSI0YQ,6303854281,Jay Dickson,"[1, 1]","Sometimes fine novels translate to film beautifully through a kind of alchemy that's very hard to explain. But with this 1995 adaptation of Beryl Bainbridge's darkly complex 1989 novel about a teenage girl working as an assistant stage manager a Liverpool repertory just after the Second World War and falling in love with its resident impresario, it's frustrating that so many of the right elements seem to be in place for a successful translation to the screen but keep falling short. The problems seem most deeply entrenched in Charles Wood's screenplay, which you can't help but admiring for picking up so many of the quirkier and most telling details in the Bainbridge source material and working it into the dialogue; but this somehow results in the characters speaking in a very stilted way that doesn't seem real (the way it did in Bainbridge's original novel). The heroine--a girl completely unschooled in the ways of human behavior, but an avid romantic consumer of literature and theatre--is nearly an impossible part to play, and the producers of this film seem to have found the wrong actress in Georgina Cates, who makes Stella seem not simply artless but nearly mentally deficient (you also wonder why her more sympathetic elders in the theatre company don't simply take her aside for five minutes to explain such obvious things as the impresario's homosexuality or the ways in which he enjoys mentally torturing younger people).Hugh Grant, doing a rare (but blessedly welcome) character turn as the caddish gay impresario Meredith (a terrific multi-layered character), is quite good, and he's even bettered by Alun Armstrong as the girl's protective uncle and, particularly, Alan Rickman, doing one of his own rare turns as a sympathetic character. As P. L. O'Hara, the gifted but self-destructive actor whom the company engages to play Captain Hook in their Christmas production of PETER PAN, Rickman gets the opportunity not often afforded him onscreen to act more with his body and not with his voice. He proves himself a fine physical actor, and even for once he takes care to curb his sly, slow, sinister speaking tones (so beloved of audiences, yet so often overused by him). The production design by Mark Geraghty and the cinematography by Dick Pope are terrific, and impressively re-create the faded Edwardian grandeur of post-War Liverpool, from its awful unpainted bedsitters to its mosaic-covered tearooms that have seen better days. The director, Mike Newell, does show a nice attention both to period detail and to the feelings of the younger characters (including Meredith's tormented lover Geoffrey (Alan Cox), who advances his career by agreeing to sleeping with the impresario and then gets cruelly cast aside); these affinities have much shaped Newell's later career in directing films that have shown his gifts working with young people and with period pieces (as in the underrated MONA LISA SMILE)",3,An awfully uneven film,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,2933,"['Sometimes', 'fine', 'novels', 'translate', 'film', 'beautifully', 'kind', 'alchemy', 'very', 'hard', 'explain', '1995', 'adaptation', 'Beryl', 'Bainbridge', 'darkly', 'complex', '1989', 'novel', 'teenage', 'girl', 'working', 'assistant', 'stage', 'manager', 'Liverpool', 'repertory', 'just', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'falling', 'love', 'resident', 'impresario', 'frustrating', 'so', 'many', 'right', 'elements', 'seem', 'be', 'place', 'successful', 'translation', 'screen', 'keep', 'falling', 'short', 'problems', 'seem', 'most', 'deeply', 'entrenched', 'Charles', 'Wood', 'screenplay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admiring', 'picking', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'quirkier', 'most', 'telling', 'details', 'Bainbridge', 'source', 'material', 'working', 'dialogue', 'somehow', 'results', 'characters', 'speaking', 'very', 'stilted', 'way', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'way', 'did', 'Bainbridge', 'original', 'novel', 'heroine', 'girl', 'completely', 'unschooled', 'ways', 'human', 'behavior', 'avid', 'romantic', 'consumer', 'literature', 'theatre', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'part', 'play', 'producers', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'found', 'wrong', 'actress', 'Georgina', 'Cates', 'who', 'Stella', 'seem', 'not', 'simply', 'artless', 'nearly', 'mentally', 'deficient', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'elders', 'theatre', 'company', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'take', 'aside', 'five', 'minutes', 'explain', 'such', 'obvious', 'things', 'impresario', 'homosexuality', 'ways', 'mentally', 'torturing', 'younger', 'people', 'Grant', 'doing', 'rare', 'blessedly', 'welcome', 'character', 'turn', 'caddish', 'gay', 'impresario', 'Meredith', 'terrific', 'multi-layered', 'character', 'quite', 'good', 'even', 'bettered', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'girl', 'protective', 'uncle', 'particularly', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'doing', 'one', 'own', 'rare', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'P.', 'L.', ""O'Hara"", 'gifted', 'self-destructive', 'actor', 'whom', 'company', 'play', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Christmas', 'production', 'PETER', 'PAN', 'Rickman', 'opportunity', 'not', 'often', 'afforded', 'onscreen', 'act', 'more', 'body', 'not', 'voice', 'fine', 'physical', 'actor', 'even', 'once', 'care', 'curb', 'sly', 'slow', 'sinister', 'speaking', 'tones', 'so', 'beloved', 'audiences', 'yet', 'so', 'often', 'overused', 'production', 'design', 'Mark', 'Geraghty', 'cinematography', 'Dick', 'Pope', 'are', 'terrific', 'impressively', 're-create', 'faded', 'Edwardian', 'grandeur', 'post-War', 'Liverpool', 'awful', 'unpainted', 'bedsitters', 'mosaic-covered', 'tearooms', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'show', 'nice', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'feelings', 'younger', 'characters', 'including', 'Meredith', 'tormented', 'lover', 'Geoffrey', 'Alan', 'Cox', 'who', 'career', 'agreeing', 'sleeping', 'impresario', 'then', 'cruelly', 'cast', 'aside', 'affinities', 'have', 'much', 'shaped', 'Newell', 'later', 'career', 'directing', 'films', 'have', 'shown', 'gifts', 'working', 'young', 'people', 'period', 'pieces', 'underrated', 'MONA', 'LISA', 'SMILE']",Awfully Big Adventure VHS

It was one of 4 movies in a Hugh Grant pack; the other 3 were all romantic comedies.  From the picture on the cover I suspected it might be dark, might be a mystery....then I watched it.The girl, Stella, was a bit odd to me.  I couldn't figure out if she was crazy, dumb (as in really slow), or scarred from some terrible event in her up bringing.  As I watched it, I assumed she was playing a 15 year old girl, and the actress did look very young to me.  I couldn't understand why she was so suddenly ""in love"" with Meredith.  I couldn't even figure out why she wanted to be involved the theatre, or why she didn't want to tip cab drivers?  And I could only assume that the reason she did't know that Meredith had an obvious preference for men was because as a young girl, she wouldn't realize that there was such a thing as homosexuality.  She seemed unintelligent to me (not just innocent).  What did she want out of life?  Where was her spirit?Hugh Grant acted very well, and I enjoyed seeing him in a different type of role...but I couldn't figure out why his character seemed crazy.  Was everyone in this film supposed to be crazy?I kept meaning to shut the movie off, because it didn't make a lot of sense to me, and I couldn't figure out anyone's motiviation or any real plot, and sometimes I couln't even understand what they were saying (between the accent and speaking so softly)...but something kept me watching to find answers.  Besides....I was waiting to see Alan Rickman.I enjoyed Alan Rickman's acting very much.  Somehow I was hoping he would be the hero to help ""fix"" things and clarify things.  I quickly realized that wouldn't happen.  The ""suprise/shocking ending"" was no surprise to me, as there had been subtle suggestions.  I felt most for his character.I didn't understand Stella's uncle at all.  Why was he even in the movie?  I got nothing from that but more confusion.I'm not sure if it was just poorly scripted, or if the ""story"" that is was based on wasn't so hot, but I found the overall story not worth watching.  Everything was just so sad and messed up.  Much of the acting was very good.  The ending, as horrid as it was, at least made some sense.

386821,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,6303854281,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[17, 18]","This is another in a long line of films I have viewed solely to enjoy Alan Rickman's performance, and what a performance; but more about that later.Having read all the Amazon reviewers' comments and a multitude of professional critics' articles I was still unable to get a sense of this film.  The plot was somewhat clear, some reviewers having given away the ending (shame on them and what a shame), but the true atmosphere of the film still eluded me.  Frankly, I couldn't convince myself this was a film I would enjoy.  Having now viewed this unusual but very interesting film, I find that nothing prepared me for what it truly was about and what it had to offer as real entertainment.Lest I reveal more of the plot than I intend, I will instead stick mostly to my point and say that Alan Rickman is an actor of absolutely unbelievable talent.  I say this after every film; he selects the widest range of roles of any actor, and he never gives a less than perfect + performance.  His Captain Hook and O'Hara are sublime characters.  He looks fantastic in both roles, of course.  Again we get to see him dance, not the tango this time, but variety is the spice of his work.  The love scenes, and I feel comfortable identifying them as 'love', because his character displays a sense of love despite his shallow nature; and also exhibits a desperate need for love that would be difficult to believe in this particular character if it were portrayed by a lesser actor.  His comic reactions have perfect timing and his emotional reactions display feelings that overwhelm and pale the efforts of every other character in the film.  This is a considerable feat because this film offers an usual, but solid, performance by Hugh Grant; a side of his talent I had not previously seen and which proved very intriguing.  Georgina Cates as Stella, the naive young girl struggling to find both herself and her past, is flawless.  She wears her feelings as open as a book on her sweet young face and states her thoughts as directly (and comically) as any adolescent innocent would.  Apparently it is like learning the ukulele.This film is not a comedy; if it were not British, there probably would have been no humor at all.  The British it seems have a way of inserting their own manner of dry wit and humor into the most serious of situations without ever losing their direction.  Perhaps I have been viewing too many English films of late; as I had no trouble with the accents and understood every word clearly.There are other reviewers here who have certainly bested my efforts at describing Rickman's attraction in this film, as I think unfortunately my statements certainly fail to do justice to the work he does in 'An Awfully Big Adventure'.  I continue to owe him thanks for the unusual scope of entertainment genres I have explored just because I am so awed by his abilities and do not want to miss of minute of an opportunity to watch him work.  Others also have provided more of the plot and I too have fallen short of explaining the true nature of the film.  All I am left to hope for is that I can  encourage any fans of Rickman's or movie-lovers who enjoy the unusual, and who have not yet viewed this film, to get themselves a copy of this rare video and see just what the 'awfully big adventure' is truly all about.

386827,A17WIKPW5JKOSF,6303854281,Merilahti Kristiina,"[44, 47]","Ok, I wouldn't have wathed it, if it didn't have Alan Rickman. One sees his acting so little, Harry Potter -movies really are a waste of time for people like me, who appreciate the fine adult actors in them - and see them only briefly.Again Alan Rickman has a difficult part and comes in late in the movie. But what the heck: the movie isn't bad. And Hugh Grant can be really sleezy! I can't tell how much I enjoyed his sexually vague, self-centered director. And Georgina Cates is really wonderful. She is the one that makes this a comedy. Stella (Cates) is so determined to become a real actress, that she hangs on every word the director says and writes down his pseudo-artistic ponderings - which he himself doesn't believe after he's said them. She worships even his nicotine-stained fingers, starts wearing a hidden cross after hearing all in the theatre are catholics - she is a protestant - and fakes a venerial disease, because everyone seems to have sex with everything that moves - except her. So she decides to get rid of her virginity as soon as possible.Rickman enters in a scene that seems to be designed for someone like him, who can hold your attention without speaking or doing anything, just looking. He walks through the theatre, people come and talk to him, say things to him... He hardly stops or opens his mouth. The director isn't happy to have him back, but everyone agrees, that no one can play Captain Hook like he can, so he is invited to join the cast. Again: Captain Hook: who else? Rickman is the villain we love. And the glimpses of Hook are really delicious. It made me again think, how people send different messages, even professional actors playing the same part. When Grant does the Hook, the children are sitting silently, filled with suspence, even fear, whereas Rickman's Hook makes them laugh out loud. Of course it's been directed that way, but it has some truth in it.I would also like to mention Alun Armstrong, uncle Vernon, who is always good, in this movie also.And then... In case you haven't read other reviews: this is not an easy film to watch, even though it's at times very funny. Even though Stella almost demands Rickman's character to take her, it isn't always comfortable to watch their relationship. Even though Cates turns out some comedy in it and some kind of real love seems to be budding between them. And the end is tragic, though it didn't come to me as a big surprise after Rickman said - first seeing Cates -: ""I know her."" So I was pretty much aware of the real tragedy, but was still touched by the unnecessarily sad solution.This isn't a feel-good movie. But it's a damn good one and I do like stories that unfold slowly to let you know bit by bit how things really are and where you thought wrong. But no, this really isn't easy.

Rather, it is troubling, often painful to watch.  The main characters are all believable and compelling, and the acting on their part is superb.  Hugh Grant amazes once again.  Having just seen him in Music and Lyrics, in which he is charming, likable, and really musically talented, I am impressed with the range of his acting ability since this role is so different.  If you compare these roles to his others in Two Weeks Notice, Bridget Jones, and Love Actually, you see an actor who just keeps pulling talents out of the trunk like magic.  Who knew he could sing!  The dance scene in Love Actually is hilarious.  Grant is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood; there is virtually nothing he cannot do well.  Alan Rickman is also excellent in this film; he gives it a lot of heart.  And the girl effectively combines pathos and humor.  However, this is not a pleasurable viewing experience because of the storyline.
