In much of central and Latin America he is monsingnor romero,the one and only true hero that el salvador has ever known. This movie produced by the late lamented Fr. Ellwood keiser{known as the hollywood priest  for his ability to get big name stars to work for scale},was under obvious budget constraints.This might be the most catholic movie I have ever seen,though many would not view it as such. It tells the story of Romero, a quiet bishop, who, as a compromise,is elevated to be archbishop of San Salvador{the equivalant of cardinal of new york 50 years ago]. The eight familes{the name given to the oligarchy that ran[runs] the country} celebrated. here was  a man they could manipulate,who would bless the armed forces,condemn the &quot;radical elements$Q,and restore the status quo. All was well save for one thing:Romero changed. His friend{and &quot;radical element&quot;}  fr Rutillio Grande{wwonderfully played by the late Richard Jordan}was asassinated along with a poor farmer and a young boy.From then on,and early in this movie, Romero becomes transformed.All seven sacraments are portrayed in this film{trivia,perhaps, though they work seamlessly} Romero trudges foward,though it becomes apparent to all what his ending will be. Raul Julia is simply wonderful as Romero{wearing a pair of the archbishops actual glasses] Tony Plena is ,as always, superb, as a tortured priest{interesting, in America a conscience striken portrayal of a cleric is always sexual}Harold Gould is fine as a member of the&quot;eight families&quot;.

Romero begins his journey self-centered and in attentive to the controversy in the country where he is assigned to serve. He has all of the best that life has to offer. He could have continued that way. But Romero was a man with compassion in his heart, and when he was finally confronted with the truth, he took action, and this action cost him his life.A tribute to Romero and his life, this wonderful motion picture calls us to ask ourselves what we would do in similar circumstances.

Many important characters are rather sketchily portrayed, primarily a weakness of the script; however, at the heart of the picture stands a magnificent characterization by Julia.

There's a pervasive sense of horror and fear in these latter largely missing from Romero despite laudable efforts at conveying the same rawness of police state terror. Perhaps the staging is a little too tidy or the death squads too ordinary to reach the same level of abject dread.Nonetheless there is much to praise in Romero. Raul Julia's transformation from meek upper-class toady to passionate spokesman for the masses is eloquently understated, and no less powerful. I especially like the way the filmakers portrayed elements of the elite, humanising them and giving them a chance to speak, even as their death squad hirelings carry out the bloody dirty work. Perhaps the movie's high point is Romero's pivotal refusal to continue baptism privileges for the well-bred, thus affirming his new spiritual loyalty, but also sealing his earthly doom. It's a quietly powerful and revealing moment.I wish the producers had showed more candor in implicating the US's role in the repression. Except for Romero's plea to stop arming the military and the presence of a thuggish American advisor (he looks North American but is not identified), there is no mention of repression's ultimate sponsor. Yet the US was waist deep in these events, as Reagan's boys in the basement  undercut every Congressional effort to moderate support.

He stood in the pulpit of the national cathedral and urged soldiers to obey their Lord and disobey commands of oppression. He paid for this, taking a bullet to the heart while blessing the wine during mass.This movie portrays the story of a quiet, bookish man who stood in the gap between the machine of dehumanizing globalization and the children of Jesus. We watch him wrestle with discovering an authentic Christian response to the injustices and oppression prevalent in El Salvador. We see him reprimand all those who would practice violence, whether as military authority, rebels, or institutionalized violence that robs people of their humanity and ability to feed their families.The movie was filmed in Mexico, not Hollywood. Raul Julia deserved an Oscar for his performance as Romero. Mexican extras bring a feeling of authenticity that could not have been realized in Hollywood. The telling manages to avoid most of the &quot;splatter&quot; depictions of violence that most box office draws include, and by so doing, makes the violence even more heinous.This is a powerful story, whether you are Christian or Pagan, Marxist or Capitalist.

In recent years, new technology has led to more and more flash in the movies but decreased substance.  Many critics lay the blame for the current trend toward cinematic escapism to the current political climate, and there's certainly some truth to that assertion.  But it's just as likely that American moviemakers just have too many toys at hand to concern themselves with grown-up themes.This 1989 film, though filmed in English and starring a major cinematic figure (the late Raul Julia), was certainly not a typical Hollywood production.  It was reportedly produced by the Paulist Fathers and funding in part came from donations by concerned Catholics.  It's a ""small,"" film but certainly compelling.  Some have lamented the film's relative predictability.  But, of course, screenwriter John Sacret Young and director John Duigan were limited by the actual facts of Romero's life.  There may have been ways of putting a little more punch into the plotline, I suppose, but overall the facts of Romero's life are riveting enough.In the classic social drama, the political awakening of the hero is a pretty standard theme.  Think NORMA RAE or THE CHINA SYNDROME or COMING HOME from the 1970s (the last gasp of social consciousness in American film, it seems).  As in those films, the hero Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador is something of a political naif.  A bit timid and bookish, he is promoted to the archbishopric because he seems among the least likely clergy to rock the boat.  His gradual transformation to a champion of the poor and oppressed comes about when fellow priests are murdered and tortured and he sees the brutality of his country's repressive government for what it is.  As a man of principle and a man of God, he has no choice but to act.The film's greatest strength is, in fact, its presentation of Romero's transformation as painful and conflicted.  Once welcome at the mansions of the very rich, he has become a social and political pariah by the film's end.  He has also become, in a very profound way, much more of a man of God.",4,A Political And Spiritual Awakening,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,2185,"['have', 'basic', 'tenet', 'country', 'US', 'mean', 'more', 'socially', 'conscious', 'even', 'downright', 'political', 'cinema', 'recent', 'years', 'new', 'technology', 'led', 'more', 'more', 'flash', 'movies', 'decreased', 'substance', 'Many', 'critics', 'lay', 'blame', 'current', 'trend', 'cinematic', 'escapism', 'current', 'political', 'climate', 'certainly', 'truth', 'assertion', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'American', 'moviemakers', 'just', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'toys', 'hand', 'concern', 'grown-up', 'themes.This', '1989', 'film', 'though', 'filmed', 'English', 'starring', 'major', 'cinematic', 'figure', 'late', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'was', 'reportedly', 'produced', 'Paulist', 'Fathers', 'funding', 'part', 'came', 'donations', 'concerned', 'Catholics', 'small', 'film', 'certainly', 'compelling', 'have', 'lamented', 'film', 'relative', 'predictability', 'course', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Sacret', 'Young', 'director', 'John', 'Duigan', 'were', 'limited', 'actual', 'facts', 'Romero', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'ways', 'putting', 'little', 'more', 'punch', 'plotline', 'suppose', 'facts', 'Romero', 'life', 'are', 'riveting', 'classic', 'social', 'drama', 'political', 'awakening', 'hero', 'pretty', 'standard', 'theme', 'Think', 'NORMA', 'RAE', 'THE', 'CHINA', 'SYNDROME', 'COMING', 'HOME', '1970s', 'last', 'gasp', 'social', 'consciousness', 'American', 'film', 'films', 'hero', 'Archbishop', 'Oscar', 'Romero', 'El', 'Salvador', 'something', 'political', 'naif', 'bit', 'timid', 'bookish', 'promoted', 'archbishopric', 'least', 'likely', 'clergy', 'rock', 'boat', 'gradual', 'transformation', 'champion', 'poor', 'oppressed', 'when', 'fellow', 'priests', 'are', 'murdered', 'tortured', 'brutality', 'country', 'repressive', 'government', 'what', 'man', 'principle', 'man', 'God', 'choice', 'act.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'fact', 'presentation', 'Romero', 'transformation', 'painful', 'conflicted', 'Once', 'welcome', 'mansions', 'very', 'rich', 'become', 'social', 'political', 'pariah', 'film', 'end', 'also', 'become', 'very', 'profound', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'man', 'God']",Romero VHS

More and more, he takes an active role in opposing the brutalization of his people, opposing also his bishops who preferred to deal with purely spiritual matters.

Romero comes to see that avoiding ""politics"" means abandoning the poor and oppressed to their tormentors.Raul Julia does a creditable, if somewhat plodding job of portraying the Archbishop. Julia doesn't quite get down to the interior fire that drove Romero to a date with martyrdom.

There is a sense of realism and a portrayal of large scale social events that makes this film potentially useful for at least instructing Americans about the kind of oppression that is the norm in many poor countries.  Unfortunately, the film assumes that viewers are already familiar with the historical context of the Salvadorean setting, or else deliberately downplays such content so as to avoid controversy and focus on the moral example provided by Romero, and to generally awe viewers with its impactful portrayal of social struggles.  But still, the film is far better at offering some educational benefits than most other films dealing with historical subject matter.  Final sequence of film transcends the particulars of El Salvador and strikes me as a timeless testament to all the victims of social change in our modern era.  Of note is that the PG-13 rating that is so prominently displayed on promotional materials for this film is probably a fake one - I have found no listings for this film in the MPAA's official ratings directory, nor on its searchable internet data base.  1989 was a year when there was a noticeable conservative shift in rating policies, when films like this started to receive R ratings for violent content.  While the film would have gotten a PG in the 1970s, in the 1990s it would've received an R.

The story is simple. A scholarly, non political priest is surprisingly named the arch  bishop of el salvador(&quot;A nice compromise choice&quot;). Eventually he  realizes that he must take a stand against this violence and oppression, as  a result he is loved by the salvadoran people and it also leads to his  assasination.One must understand the political situation to better  appreciate this movie. El salvador was on the brink of civil war and the  sandanista takeover in nicaragua brought panic to the military and wealthy  landholders as they feared the same thing happening in el salvador. It was  only with the military assistance from the united states that kept el  salvador from falling to revolutionaries. What makes this movie so special  is that it goes beyond the superficial political issue of that time of  whether the US should be aiding the military. It's mans inhumanity to man  and it is all our responsibility to fight against it. Romero is against all  violence including that initiated by the revolutionaries.This movie is  powerful and violent. It has to be violent to tell the story but what is  depicted in this movie is mild compared to what really happened there. The  quality of the production is mediocre and it's obviously a low budget  affair. Many of the same extras and tertiary characters appear regardless  of where the scene supposedly takes place(aquilares or san salvador). The  acting is solid but not spectacular. It is raul julia's romero who steals  the show with an oscar caliber performance. The fact that the movie was  produced by a religious order of the catholic church(the paulists) is a  plus. The most moving scene is when  romero and the people of aquilares  take back the local cathedral from the military by courageously walking  into the church and beginning a mass. The people got the courage to do this  when romero risks his life to gather the blessed sacrament(consecrated  communion hosts) from the church alter. Another powerful moment is when  like jesus in the garden of gethsemene, romero painfully prays at the grave  of his fallen friend contemplating his imminent death. &quot;Take me i'm  yours&quot; he says. I doubt if such scenes would ever make their way into  a hollywood production but they should because romero was a catholic  bishop. There is also a paternalistic view that the church alone can help  these people which is something of a negative. There is also an attempt to  demonstrate all the various views of the situation. In addition to the  church, the military and the guerillas one sees the views of the  aristocracy, the government and the indifferent. Violence affects all in  this film not just the poor or the church. That's not the case in other  films about this period like oliver stone's &quot;salvador&quot; which goes  so far as to depict the guerillas as if they were freedom fighting  hippies.Over all this is a great movie. I would recommend it to any  adult but catholics especially will find it  moving....................socks",5,A must see video.......,954028800,"03 26, 2000",2000,3172,"['not', 'type', 'video', 'rent', 'one', 'time', 'viewing', 'have', 'own', 'can', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'share', 'friends', 'story', 'simple', 'scholarly', 'non', 'political', 'priest', 'surprisingly', 'named', 'arch', 'bishop', 'el', 'salvador', 'quot', 'A', 'nice', 'compromise', 'choice', 'quot', 'Eventually', 'must', 'take', 'stand', 'violence', 'oppression', 'result', 'loved', 'salvadoran', 'people', 'also', 'assasination.One', 'must', 'understand', 'political', 'situation', 'better', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'El', 'salvador', 'was', 'brink', 'civil', 'war', 'sandanista', 'takeover', 'nicaragua', 'brought', 'panic', 'military', 'wealthy', 'landholders', 'feared', 'same', 'thing', 'happening', 'el', 'salvador', 'was', 'only', 'military', 'assistance', 'united', 'states', 'kept', 'el', 'salvador', 'falling', 'revolutionaries', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'superficial', 'political', 'issue', 'time', 'US', 'should', 'be', 'aiding', 'military', 'mans', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'responsibility', 'fight', 'Romero', 'violence', 'including', 'initiated', 'revolutionaries.This', 'movie', 'powerful', 'violent', 'be', 'violent', 'tell', 'story', 'what', 'depicted', 'movie', 'mild', 'compared', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'there', 'quality', 'production', 'mediocre', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'affair', 'Many', 'same', 'extras', 'tertiary', 'characters', 'appear', 'regardless', 'where', 'scene', 'supposedly', 'place', 'san', 'salvador', 'acting', 'solid', 'not', 'spectacular', 'raul', 'julia', 'romero', 'who', 'show', 'oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'religious', 'order', 'catholic', 'church', 'paulists', 'plus', 'most', 'moving', 'scene', 'when', 'romero', 'people', 'aquilares', 'take', 'back', 'local', 'cathedral', 'military', 'courageously', 'walking', 'church', 'beginning', 'mass', 'people', 'got', 'courage', 'do', 'when', 'romero', 'life', 'gather', 'blessed', 'sacrament', 'consecrated', 'communion', 'hosts', 'church', 'alter', 'powerful', 'moment', 'when', 'like', 'jesus', 'garden', 'gethsemene', 'romero', 'painfully', 'grave', 'fallen', 'friend', 'contemplating', 'imminent', 'death', 'quot', 'Take', 'i', ""'m"", 'yours', 'quot', 'doubt', 'such', 'scenes', 'would', 'ever', 'make', 'way', 'hollywood', 'production', 'should', 'because', 'romero', 'was', 'catholic', 'bishop', 'also', 'paternalistic', 'view', 'church', 'alone', 'can', 'help', 'people', 'something', 'negative', 'also', 'attempt', 'demonstrate', 'various', 'views', 'situation', 'addition', 'church', 'military', 'guerillas', 'one', 'views', 'aristocracy', 'government', 'indifferent', 'Violence', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'poor', 'church', 'not', 'case', 'other', 'films', 'period', 'stone', 'quot', 'quot', 'so', 'far', 'depict', 'guerillas', 'were', 'freedom', 'fighting', 'hippies.Over', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'adult', 'catholics', 'especially', 'will', 'find', 'moving', '..socks']",Romero VHS

Any good Catholic knows that the Paulists tend to toy with dissent. Now having stated that on to the review:I agree that Raul Julia's performance was exceptional. He brought out he character of the late Archbishop very well. And along with the sets and extras they merit 3 stars out of 3 .What I did not like about the film is its overtly gross support of Liberation Theology that has been denounced by the Church as heresy, due to its incorporation of Marxism. The archbishop himself wasn't a liberation theologian...he denouced Marxism. And he was critical of the greed of the rich. He didn't hate them. He was constantly reminding them of the need to look after the poor.The film also failed to show the spirituality of this man...and merely portrays him as a fighter that gave provocative speeches that aroused the passions of the crowds. But it fails to tell us that he was also cautious....So if you want a good biopic of Romero, I suggest that you DON'T by the movie. If you're interested still, then I'd advice you to rent it.Once agin Holy Mother Church has told us not to harbour resentment or envy towards anyone. The rich are not to be hated for what they have. That is communism. Some of the rich were once poor. And the poor should be cared for by giving them employment, education and a sense of self worth. I think Oscar Romero would agree!",2,A lot of charchter yet no soul.....,1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,1439,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'recognizing', 'makers', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'Paulist', 'press', 'good', 'Catholic', 'Paulists', 'tend', 'toy', 'dissent', 'Now', 'having', 'stated', 'review', 'agree', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'performance', 'was', 'exceptional', 'brought', 'out', 'character', 'late', 'Archbishop', 'very', 'well', 'sets', 'extras', 'merit', '3', 'stars', '3', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'overtly', 'gross', 'support', 'Liberation', 'Theology', 'been', 'denounced', 'Church', 'heresy', 'due', 'incorporation', 'Marxism', 'archbishop', 'was', ""n't"", 'liberation', 'theologian', 'denouced', 'Marxism', 'was', 'critical', 'greed', 'rich', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'was', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'need', 'look', 'poor.The', 'film', 'also', 'failed', 'show', 'spirituality', 'man', 'merely', 'fighter', 'gave', 'provocative', 'speeches', 'aroused', 'passions', 'crowds', 'tell', 'was', 'also', 'cautious', '.So', 'want', 'good', 'biopic', 'Romero', 'suggest', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'movie', ""'re"", 'interested', 'still', 'then', ""'d"", 'advice', 'rent', 'it.Once', 'agin', 'Holy', 'Mother', 'Church', 'told', 'not', 'harbour', 'resentment', 'envy', 'towards', 'anyone', 'rich', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'hated', 'what', 'have', 'communism', 'rich', 'were', 'once', 'poor', 'poor', 'should', 'be', 'cared', 'giving', 'employment', 'education', 'sense', 'self', 'worth', 'think', 'Oscar', 'Romero', 'would', 'agree']",Romero VHS
