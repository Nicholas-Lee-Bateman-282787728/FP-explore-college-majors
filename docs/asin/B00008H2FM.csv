Anyways, with Majuub absorbed by Baby Vegeta, Goku steps in to pick up where he left off. And whoever said that it was horribly edited by FUNimation is one true jackass to think that. By Goku becoming a SS4, does he have what it takes to put Baby to rest?

Knox ""QuackJak""","[1, 4]","...People who watch the Cartoon Network version of Dragonball Z and other editied versions of original Japanese anime will probably enjoy this as well, considering it more tightly edited and dubbed to thier preferance. Of course it ruins the whole flow of the story, but it seems that doesn't matter anymore. Pity.Too bad all that does is pander to our desire to have things 'simplified' for us. This series had enough problems of its own (original creator wasn't involved, the first storyarc was considered by audiences a poor return to 'Dragon Ball' days so they switched to fight-intensive DBZ style) without being trimmed and repackaged for American audiences to digest.About the only thing left to add is if you have seen the original Japanese series on VCD you may want to steer clear of this, as the editing and the soundtrack make it so you can't enjoy it..",1,HORRIBLY EDITED BY FUNIMATION,1048550400,"03 25, 2003",2003,865,"['People', 'who', 'watch', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'version', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'other', 'editied', 'versions', 'original', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'considering', 'more', 'tightly', 'edited', 'dubbed', 'thier', 'preferance', 'course', 'whole', 'flow', 'story', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anymore', 'Pity.Too', 'bad', 'pander', 'desire', 'have', 'things', ""'simplified"", 'series', 'had', 'enough', 'problems', 'own', 'original', 'creator', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'first', 'storyarc', 'was', 'considered', 'audiences', 'poor', 'return', ""'Dragon"", 'Ball', 'days', 'switched', 'fight-intensive', 'DBZ', 'style', 'being', 'trimmed', 'repackaged', 'American', 'audiences', 'digest.About', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'add', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Japanese', 'series', 'VCD', 'may', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'editing', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it..']",N/A

The original Japanese version sticks to Anime roots where the men sound like little girls when they scream and the voices become monotonus after a while. The 60's godzilla music did not help the Japanese version as well.If you're into Anime and that type of voices in your Dragonball experience, then you have the ability to hear it in the DVD. If you're like me, who enjoy their Dragonball characters sounding real, tough and believable and who enjoys modern music that actually compliments the scenes instead of detracts from it, then you'll love the english dubbed version.It all depends on what you are into. I'm not into Anime, but I am into Dragonball Z. That's why I prefer the superior dubbing of the English version over its  not-so-good predecessor",5,English version is the best,1050192000,"04 13, 2003",2003,882,"['have', 'seen', 'pre-release', 'first', 'few', 'english', 'dubbed', 'versions', 'GT', 'must', 'say', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'sticks', 'Anime', 'roots', 'where', 'men', 'sound', 'little', 'girls', 'when', 'scream', 'voices', 'become', 'monotonus', 'while', '60', 'godzilla', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'Japanese', 'version', 'well.If', ""'re"", 'Anime', 'type', 'voices', 'Dragonball', 'experience', 'then', 'have', 'ability', 'hear', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'who', 'enjoy', 'Dragonball', 'characters', 'sounding', 'real', 'tough', 'believable', 'who', 'modern', 'music', 'actually', 'scenes', 'instead', 'detracts', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'english', 'dubbed', 'what', 'are', ""'m"", 'not', 'Anime', 'am', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'why', 'prefer', 'superior', 'dubbing', 'English', 'version', 'not-so-good', 'predecessor']",N/A
