1275169,AY1G069JXU49L,B002KMIW6K,"A. Thankful ""RolyPolyBear""","[5, 5]","Being an avid fan of this British wartime drama, I finally got to view this when our local library got it in.  I was shocked that there were no behind the story special features to make the story come to life better.  Though I was grateful for the subtitles; (Honeysuckle tends to talk quickly and low-toned that sometimes you miss her best quips without subtitling)....  I only rated it 3 Stars for many of the lower rating reviews same reasons...  Although the bright star was the 3rd episode ""The Hide"" which made me really realize how important we mothers are to our children, even in a world that seems to value everything but.... My query about this one episode is when Foyle uses the almost Biblical phrase that he ""knew her"" twice to indicate to a prisoner he knew his mother...  Was it a double play on words to develop this other character for future episodes?  My main complaint was Sam being a nude model in episode 1 (did you really have to go there, everybody else does, I was hoping Foyle would stay out of that cheap genre...) Milner finally loosened up in these three and actually made me laugh with his facial expressions in several moments, but the makeup artist seemed to forget to fill in his right eyebrow completely with pencil so in some shots he looked a bit off---kind of like the other person's comment of Sam without the makeup and horribly lit...  Although I think Anthony (Milner) has a striking resemblance to a young George Washington (except for eye color) and perhaps could play him in a movie???  But, I digress...My absolute fav Foyle's War was ""Broken Souls"" and I don't think you could get any better than that---it had every emotion, every twist, and one of Chopin's best works to boot! I do find it interesting that Mr. Horowitz really likes to pick skinny Sean Penn/early Robert DeNiro look-alikes in so many of his Foyle's War episodes---the returning POW soldier in Broken Souls with the frostbit foot, as well as the character of ""Tom"" in the Russia House episode, always having them play off of fuller-faced ""regular Joe"" looking characters... I enjoyed ""Tom's"" speech he gave to Milner, who himself a wounded Veteran seemed touched by the words...  Everybody seems to dislike the Killing Time episode so I won't go there except to say I really liked the African-American actor (I think he was American, I could be wrong LOL)who played Gabe---I enjoyed watching his character interact with Foyle and everybody, and his voice reminded me of a young Sydney Poitier.  He was the best part of the whole episode in my opinion.  I always enjoy Michael's understated Foyle and in previous episodes could almost predict by his familiar cheek-chewing, eye blinking and mouth moving displays when he had solved a case.  This time, I think it was too much dialogue and since our main characters are all in different stations in life, the interplay wasn't there.  My personal wish (if they make another one) is that in America when Foyle goes, he meets up with that telegraph pole selector lady with the red coat again.  Or ends up with Elsa---I liked her addition to the Russia House, those characters always add a definite flavor to the episode that would be bland without them.  The music in the 3 episodes seemed like a Harry Potter/Polar Express/X-files combination this time around---it was interesting...If anybody who makes Foyle's War reads this, please DON'T have the characters sacrifice their moral codes in any future episodes---yes, they are all human, but some of us out here watch these because they are calm not flashy dramas that make you think and discuss and don't need all that mindless smutty stuff... I never was taught in school how bad England had it during WW II, and I enjoy learning the history in these productions (I didn't notice the wrong uniforms for the American G.I.'s though since I am not from that era, but I appreciated learning that from the other reviewer!)Don't stoop to the level that so many previously good shows have....PLEASE!  I'm running out of anything good to watch since I don't watch cable tv anymore!  Keep Foyle with the one thing that has become synonymous with it's name; Integrity.....

1275177,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B002KMIW6K,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[0, 1]","This is an excellent conclusion to a masterful British detective series. I praise this series highly because once again the brits, and Acorn media, have released a winner. I first started watching this series because I am a fan of most detective series and have an interest in World War II. I was glad I did since the casting, directing, sets, costumes, camera work, scenery, and music were first rate. You really feel you immersed in the forties and the struggle that took place for England during the war and the impact it had on everyone including the police. This set picks up after the war and DMS Foyle is still anxious to leave the force and go to America. He is coerced to remain for six more weeks to solve some cases that can have great ramifications in the first two episodes. The last episode he has left the force but he is drawn in to help the police solve it for personal reasons.The Russian House involves Russians that were POWs that fought for the Germans against Russia because of Stalin. They are being shipped back from England and don't expect to be received well by the government. When one prisoner commits suicide, Foyle investigates the circumstances and finds their is far more below the surface of why the British goverment is being so cooperative with the Russians.The Killing Time is about the black soldiers that fought in WWII and their ill treatment in the service not only from Americans but the British as well. The fact some of the English women fratenize with them only stirs up even more disentment. When one soldier tries to marry one that has had his child it only lands him in far more troble than he expected. When his fiance is murdered and he is accused for the crime he is lucky Foyle is on the case.The Hide involves a condemned soldier that was a POW that became part of a British unit working for the Nazi's. When Foyle visits him in jail he can get little out of him but surmises that there is far more the case that meets the eye.

L'hoir,"[26, 27]","If Sherlock Holmes can be brought back from death at the Reichenbach Falls, then Christopher Foyle can certainly be recalled from permanent retirement at the Hastings Police. And fortunately for viewers, British ITV has had the good judgment to bring such a scenario to fruition. As far as this viewer is concerned, Foyle, Sam, and Milner--such wonderful characters, they seem like old friends--can go on solving mysteries as long as possible, not only in the period immediately after the war but also into the Cold War, the beginnings of which are intimated in ""The Russian House.""As usual, the mysteries are absorbing. I especially enjoyed watching the low-key, snail's-crawl 'car chase' in the first episode; the slowness of the pace heightened the suspense even more than would the customary high-speed television cliche of cars careening through the streets in wrong-way traffic.In addition to being a superlative detective series, ""Foyle's War"" continues to act as a mirror of history. It is fascinating to discover some of the War's dirty secrets that had been first hidden and then, conveniently, forgotten, such as the one that serves as the background for ""The Russian House."" The best thing about the continuation of the series, however, is its concentration on a period of history that is so often neglected--the depiction of what it was like to live in Britain just after the war, with rationing, food shortages, bomb-damage, displaced persons. Especially compelling is its portrayal of  the men and women who had given their hearts' blood to service for so many years, dreaming that there was no place like Home, and then upon returning sometimes discovering that Home had no place for them. All the characters of the series have been defined by their wartime personae, as Sam and the young man she meets in London indicate (She has spent most of the war as Inspector Foyle's driver and the young man has spent the war code-breaking at Bletchley Park). With the end of the war, they are analogous to actors who had been performing in a very long play after the applause has died down and the curtain has descended. They must go back to reality, but to a new reality.So here's to Christopher Foyle: may he (and Michael Kitchen) continue to flourish!

1275199,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B002KMIW6K,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[11, 11]","Post War!-What everyone who's seen Foyle's War was anxiously awaiting. Triumphant 3 NEW EPISODES of Foyle's Post-War (summer 1945). Done in the same 6-STAR excellence as the British home-front WWII series. Period drama done to perfection providing history, drama, action, romance, mystery, and suspense (6-STARS) in every episode. Its barely off the telly (aired April, 2010) and available WITH SUBTITLES only 2 months later. Wow!Foyle's War will certainly be a classic--if not already so. It is indisputably the FINEST war drama and crime mystery combo ever produced in Britain (the world?)  Hopefully this encore will be only the start of years showing the post-war conditions in England, through the eyes of Foyle.Michael Kitchen is back as Foyle--the series is impossible without him. Anthony Horowitz is writer/creator. And what a blessing to again see 'Sam', Miss Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) back helping Foyle in Hastings, solving crimes and dealing with post-war issues. She has such a beautiful face--and more. A jolly voice. I just love her.In the Series, Foyle longs for retirement, away from crime, death, and political intrigue; but now all the world longs for Foyle to be on the job for many series to come.If you watched ""Foyle's War: Series 1-5 -From Dunkirk to VE-Day"" then Set 6 is a MUST. These 3 feature-length episodes do stand alone, but after viewing them you WILL want the complete wartime set. Don't expect to watch one episode at a time. They are so good, you'll watch them back-to-back, all 300 minutes.Foyle's War is fiction, but so authentic and accurate to detail and events that this series is a MUST for historians. it is so historical detailed it becomes educational. Above all else, it is 6-STAR ENTERTAINMENT.Still not enough...check this listing...""We'll Meet Again (4pc) (DVD)""",5,JUST WHAT WE'VE COME TO EXPECT--OUTSTANDING!,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,1814,"['Post', 'War', '-What', 'everyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Foyle', 'War', 'was', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'Triumphant', '3', 'NEW', 'EPISODES', 'Foyle', 'Post-War', 'summer', '1945', 'Done', 'same', '6-STAR', 'excellence', 'British', 'home-front', 'WWII', 'series', 'Period', 'drama', 'done', 'perfection', 'providing', 'history', 'drama', 'action', 'romance', 'mystery', 'suspense', '6-STARS', 'episode', 'barely', 'telly', 'aired', 'April', '2010', 'available', 'WITH', 'SUBTITLES', 'only', '2', 'months', 'later', 'Wow', 'Foyle', 'War', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'classic', 'not', 'already', 'so', 'indisputably', 'FINEST', 'war', 'drama', 'crime', 'mystery', 'combo', 'ever', 'produced', 'Britain', 'world', 'Hopefully', 'encore', 'will', 'be', 'only', 'start', 'years', 'showing', 'post-war', 'conditions', 'England', 'eyes', 'Foyle.Michael', 'Kitchen', 'back', 'Foyle', 'series', 'impossible', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'writer/creator', 'what', 'blessing', 'again', 'see', ""'Sam"", 'Miss', 'Stewart', 'Honeysuckle', 'Weeks', 'back', 'helping', 'Foyle', 'Hastings', 'solving', 'crimes', 'dealing', 'post-war', 'issues', 'beautiful', 'face', 'more', 'jolly', 'voice', 'just', 'love', 'Series', 'Foyle', 'retirement', 'away', 'crime', 'death', 'political', 'intrigue', 'now', 'world', 'Foyle', 'be', 'job', 'many', 'series', 'come.If', 'watched', 'Foyle', 'War', 'Series', '1-5', '-From', 'Dunkirk', 'VE-Day', 'then', 'Set', '6', 'MUST', '3', 'feature-length', 'episodes', 'do', 'stand', 'alone', 'viewing', 'WILL', 'want', 'complete', 'wartime', 'set', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'good', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'back-to-back', '300', 'minutes.Foyle', 'War', 'fiction', 'so', 'authentic', 'accurate', 'detail', 'events', 'series', 'MUST', 'historians', 'so', 'historical', 'detailed', 'educational', 'else', '6-STAR', 'ENTERTAINMENT.Still', 'not', 'enough', 'check', 'listing', ""'ll"", 'Meet', 'Again', '4pc', 'DVD']",N/A

In The Russian House, for example, he tells off his former associate, his prior boss, and the deputy of his former associate. In each case, he makes his point and gets results.

But I was let-down by this three episode return. Moral preaching abounded in the plots revolving around loyalty, race, and betrayal. It is surprising that Michael Kitchen did not push back on some of the lines he was instructed to utter. The incredulous bearing he carried when dealing with Britain's upper crust has given way to his own superiority and self righteousness - it was uncomfortable and made me enjoy the character less. Also, I never quite got the tension between Milner and Foyle - totally unnecessary and a distraction.The episode dealing with the strain between US black and white soldiers was just plain bad - preachy, unbelievable (Britain has its own sobering history of racial tolerance), and the actual murder plot contrived. Exploring the return of Soviet citizens who fought for Hitler was interesting (the repatriation of the Cossacks was a huge black eye for Britain) and a plot involving the Britisches Freikorps, a unit of the Waffen-SS, could have been more engaging.Still, you want to care for the characters and historical accuracy is evident throughout. However, at the end, Foyle didn't need passage on a ship to get to America - given his moral superiority - he could have just walked across the Atlantic.",3,Preachy and Self Righteous - A Season Too Far,1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,1346,"['Let', 'state', 'love', 'sets', '1-5', 'series', 'wrote', 'flattering', 'review', 'support', 'was', 'let-down', 'three', 'episode', 'return', 'Moral', 'preaching', 'abounded', 'plots', 'revolving', 'around', 'loyalty', 'race', 'betrayal', 'surprising', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'did', 'not', 'push', 'back', 'lines', 'was', 'instructed', 'utter', 'incredulous', 'bearing', 'carried', 'when', 'dealing', 'Britain', 'upper', 'crust', 'given', 'way', 'own', 'superiority', 'self', 'righteousness', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'made', 'enjoy', 'character', 'less', 'Also', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'tension', 'Milner', 'Foyle', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'distraction.The', 'episode', 'dealing', 'strain', 'US', 'black', 'white', 'soldiers', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'preachy', 'unbelievable', 'Britain', 'own', 'sobering', 'history', 'racial', 'tolerance', 'actual', 'murder', 'plot', 'contrived', 'Exploring', 'return', 'Soviet', 'citizens', 'who', 'fought', 'Hitler', 'was', 'interesting', 'repatriation', 'Cossacks', 'was', 'huge', 'black', 'eye', 'Britain', 'plot', 'involving', 'Britisches', 'Freikorps', 'unit', 'Waffen-SS', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'engaging.Still', 'want', 'care', 'characters', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'evident', 'However', 'end', 'Foyle', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'passage', 'ship', 'get', 'America', 'given', 'moral', 'superiority', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'walked', 'Atlantic']",N/A

1275206,A28YDMI499J1X9,B002KMIW6K,J. Janssen,"[2, 2]","Foyle's War 6 is one of those little surprises in life that one doesn't expect.  The original series clearly had a ending and was put into my rotation for ""annual viewing"".  When I first got wind of a new installment in the pipeline I was anticipatory but cautious. I had been disappointed before with Ballykisangel being stretched out long after it should have been put to bed and was concerned that trying to recapture the feel of wartime Hastings might be an elusive and frustrating endeavor.  But, not to worry; the dramas are very much in tune with those in the first 3 series and, in my opinion, are superior to series 4 & 5.The first 3 series were my favorite of all the Brit tele-dramas available in the US (and that includes Morse, Lewis, Midsomer, Sherlock, Poroit, Frost, Ballykisangel, etc.).  But it was painfully obvious that series 4 & 5 seemed rushed to finish the project in the shortest period of time. The series felt truncated and the finale was more melancholy than one might associate with the end of an epic war and the anticipation of ""good times"" ahead.  It turns out that ITV's ""director of television"" cancelled the series but then faced a firestorm of protest from viewers world wide.  This protest led ITV to reverse itself and produce ""series 6"".  Additionally, Michael Kitchen was added as a producer on the show, hopefully a sign that future episodes will be forthcomingThe three included dramas do much to establish a post war footing for the character's relationship and open numerous story lines around which to craft future episodes.  In ""The Hide"" Foyle closes out series 6 by embarking on his ""unfinished business"" trip to the US and hints at a speedy return.  One can only hope that there will be more in the future as the principal actors are still with us and established in post war lives. Certainly in the short term a ""resolve"" to the ""50 Ships"" episode in volume 2 is promised.  Let's all hope this wonderful series created by Tony Horowitz (original lead writer of the Midsomer juggernaut) can continue to find life in post war England and entertain us for years to come.UPDATE:There's another review by someone who issued strong distaste and condemnation for one of the episodes that bordered on political diatribe. Between the ranting his main complaint appeared to be questioning the ""facts"" underlying the story line.  While everybody is entitled to their opinion, isn't this a fictional series that's allowed to take license with the facts?  One can either like or dislike a particular topic, but to condemn it based upon the selective use of ""facts"" seems illogical.  To hold any water this same individual would have to express like concern about the works of Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway and, dare I say, every film John Wayne and Ronald Reagan ever made.Further, while ""Killing Time"" is at times uncomfortable to watch, one has to question the apoplexy some of these negative reviews have exhibited. Are these reviewers really oblivious to the racism evident in US society and it's military during the mid century?  Surely they can't be. I think they just don't like to be reminded of it.  To Foyle's War's credit, some of the brits don't come off any better (except our lead characters naturally).  Minorities rarely fare well under the pressures of war or economic hard times and America is no exception.  To show outrage at having it ""shoved down their throat"" is akin to denying it ever happened.  And that is, I believe, what we fought WWII over, at least retrospectively.I do have one minor gripe for Series 6 as well as for the previous ones involving the US military.  Whomever the US military advisor on the series was dropped the ball on the wearing of the uniform.  Almost every scene shows gig lines not straight, epaulets not properly tucked under lapels, ribbons not properly sequenced and worst of all, brass worn out of position and numerous times upside down.",5,"Different, yet the same...",1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,3944,"['Foyle', 'War', '6', 'one', 'little', 'surprises', 'life', 'one', ""n't"", 'expect', 'original', 'series', 'clearly', 'had', 'ending', 'was', 'put', 'rotation', 'annual', 'viewing', 'When', 'first', 'got', 'wind', 'new', 'installment', 'pipeline', 'was', 'anticipatory', 'cautious', 'had', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Ballykisangel', 'being', 'stretched', 'out', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'bed', 'was', 'concerned', 'trying', 'recapture', 'feel', 'wartime', 'Hastings', 'might', 'be', 'elusive', 'frustrating', 'endeavor', 'not', 'worry', 'dramas', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'tune', 'first', '3', 'series', 'opinion', 'are', 'superior', 'series', '4', '5.The', 'first', '3', 'series', 'were', 'favorite', 'Brit', 'tele-dramas', 'available', 'US', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'Midsomer', 'Sherlock', 'Poroit', 'Frost', 'Ballykisangel', 'etc.', 'was', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'series', '4', '5', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'finish', 'project', 'shortest', 'period', 'time', 'series', 'felt', 'truncated', 'finale', 'was', 'more', 'melancholy', 'one', 'might', 'associate', 'end', 'epic', 'war', 'anticipation', 'good', 'times', 'ahead', 'out', 'ITV', 'director', 'television', 'cancelled', 'series', 'then', 'faced', 'firestorm', 'protest', 'viewers', 'world', 'wide', 'protest', 'led', 'ITV', 'reverse', 'produce', 'series', '6', 'Additionally', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'was', 'added', 'producer', 'show', 'hopefully', 'sign', 'future', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'forthcomingThe', 'three', 'included', 'dramas', 'do', 'much', 'establish', 'post', 'war', 'footing', 'character', 'relationship', 'open', 'numerous', 'story', 'lines', 'craft', 'future', 'episodes', 'Hide', 'Foyle', 'out', 'series', '6', 'embarking', 'unfinished', 'business', 'trip', 'US', 'hints', 'speedy', 'return', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'future', 'principal', 'actors', 'are', 'still', 'established', 'post', 'war', 'lives', 'Certainly', 'short', 'term', 'resolve', '50', 'Ships', 'episode', 'volume', '2', 'promised', 'Let', 'hope', 'wonderful', 'series', 'created', 'Tony', 'Horowitz', 'original', 'lead', 'writer', 'Midsomer', 'juggernaut', 'can', 'continue', 'find', 'life', 'post', 'war', 'England', 'entertain', 'years', 'come.UPDATE', 'review', 'someone', 'who', 'issued', 'strong', 'distaste', 'condemnation', 'one', 'episodes', 'bordered', 'political', 'diatribe', 'ranting', 'main', 'complaint', 'appeared', 'be', 'questioning', 'facts', 'underlying', 'story', 'line', 'everybody', 'entitled', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'fictional', 'series', 'allowed', 'take', 'license', 'facts', 'One', 'can', 'either', 'dislike', 'particular', 'topic', 'condemn', 'based', 'selective', 'use', 'facts', 'illogical', 'hold', 'water', 'same', 'individual', 'would', 'have', 'express', 'concern', 'works', 'Shakespeare', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'dare', 'say', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'ever', 'made.Further', 'Killing', 'Time', 'times', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'question', 'apoplexy', 'negative', 'reviews', 'have', 'exhibited', 'Are', 'reviewers', 'really', 'oblivious', 'racism', 'evident', 'US', 'society', 'military', 'mid', 'century', 'Surely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'think', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'reminded', 'Foyle', 'War', 'credit', 'brits', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'better', 'lead', 'characters', 'naturally', 'Minorities', 'rarely', 'fare', 'well', 'pressures', 'war', 'economic', 'hard', 'times', 'America', 'exception', 'show', 'outrage', 'having', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat', 'akin', 'denying', 'ever', 'happened', 'believe', 'what', 'fought', 'WWII', 'least', 'retrospectively.I', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'minor', 'gripe', 'Series', '6', 'as', 'well', 'previous', 'ones', 'involving', 'US', 'military', 'US', 'military', 'advisor', 'series', 'was', 'dropped', 'ball', 'wearing', 'uniform', 'scene', 'gig', 'lines', 'not', 'straight', 'not', 'properly', 'tucked', 'lapels', 'ribbons', 'not', 'properly', 'sequenced', 'worst', 'brass', 'worn', 'position', 'numerous', 'times', 'upside', 'down']",N/A

Foyle is back on the job dealing with the lawlessness that plagued England as the country tried to rebuild. Still created by Anthony Horowitz and still starring Michael Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks, this was filmed in 2009 and will air on ITV in England during April of 2010. If it is recieved as well as sets 1-5, then the series will continue to be produced. In an unprecidented move, ITV is attempting to make up for the terrible decision to cut the original series short, and end it abruptly. They are hoping it hasn't lost it's audience. The DVD will be released in August 2010.Here is a synopsis of Series 7, (set 6).It is June 1945 and while VE Day has been celebrated in Britain, the war continues elsewhere in the world. The immediate aftermath of war was not a time of jubilation and optimism, as had been expected. The country was exhausted and poverty-stricken, families torn apart and rations tighter than ever before. Like everyone else, Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle needs to feel his way in this new world as he faces some of his toughest challenges and gripping plots to date. Keen to retire, but bound to his old job by the steep rise in violent crime that swept the country, Foyle is thrust into the dangerous worlds of international conspiracy and execution, military racism and national betrayal.The Russian House:CS Foyle stumbles upon an international cover up, which, if exposed could bring down the British government, and reveal the War Office's darkest secret yet.Killing Time:Foyle goes head to head against the might of the US army, as racial prejudices erupt when a local girl is found murdered, and the finger of suspicion points to a black GI at the US military base.The Hide:The newly retired Foyle battles to save a young man accused of high treason from the executioner's noose, in a case that will shatter his personal world to the core...[...]",5,"The ""new"" Foyle's War",1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,1981,"['wondering', 'what', 'continuation', 'series', 'post', 'war', 'Foyle', 'back', 'job', 'dealing', 'lawlessness', 'plagued', 'England', 'country', 'tried', 'rebuild', 'Still', 'created', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'still', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'Honeysuckle', 'Weeks', 'was', 'filmed', '2009', 'will', 'air', 'ITV', 'England', 'April', '2010', 'recieved', 'as', 'well', 'sets', '1-5', 'then', 'series', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'produced', 'unprecidented', 'move', 'ITV', 'attempting', 'make', 'up', 'terrible', 'decision', 'cut', 'original', 'series', 'short', 'end', 'abruptly', 'are', 'hoping', ""n't"", 'lost', 'audience', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'August', '2010.Here', 'synopsis', 'Series', '7', 'set', '6', '.It', 'June', '1945', 'VE', 'Day', 'been', 'celebrated', 'Britain', 'war', 'elsewhere', 'world', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'war', 'was', 'not', 'time', 'jubilation', 'optimism', 'had', 'been', 'expected', 'country', 'was', 'exhausted', 'poverty-stricken', 'families', 'torn', 'apart', 'rations', 'tighter', 'ever', 'before', 'everyone', 'else', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Superintendent', 'Christopher', 'Foyle', 'feel', 'way', 'new', 'world', 'toughest', 'challenges', 'gripping', 'plots', 'date', 'Keen', 'retire', 'bound', 'old', 'job', 'steep', 'rise', 'violent', 'crime', 'swept', 'country', 'Foyle', 'thrust', 'dangerous', 'worlds', 'international', 'conspiracy', 'execution', 'military', 'racism', 'national', 'betrayal.The', 'Russian', 'House', 'CS', 'Foyle', 'international', 'cover', 'up', 'exposed', 'could', 'bring', 'down', 'British', 'government', 'reveal', 'War', 'Office', 'darkest', 'secret', 'yet.Killing', 'Time', 'Foyle', 'head', 'head', 'might', 'US', 'army', 'racial', 'prejudices', 'erupt', 'when', 'local', 'girl', 'found', 'murdered', 'finger', 'suspicion', 'points', 'black', 'GI', 'US', 'military', 'base.The', 'Hide', 'newly', 'retired', 'Foyle', 'battles', 'save', 'young', 'man', 'accused', 'high', 'treason', 'executioner', 'noose', 'case', 'will', 'shatter', 'personal', 'world', 'core', '[', ']']",N/A

The episodes are ""The Russian House"", in which the escape of a Russian POW brings calamity and murder, igniting division between Foyle and a former subordinate; ""Killing Time"" about the prospect of absolute disaster involving African American GIs who want to return home; and ""The Hide"", a tale about a young woman's murder and an accused traitor who will not defend himself.

Life won't ever be the same again, but no one is quite sure how it will be. Hastings has a new, modern police station, but DCI Foyle wants nothing more than to get away from it. He wants to resign and pursue some ""unfinished business"". But no one will let him quite yet. Sam Stewart is out of uniform. And Paul Milner is now a Detective Inspector in Brighton, struggling with a new sergeant who is not especially sharp and trying to make a name for himself without Foyle -sometimes trying clumsily, causing some friction with his former boss. Milner is more in the background now than in previous seasons, and doesn't appear at all in ""The Killing Time"".In the months after the War, there was still plenty of political intrigue. Anthony Horowitz and his writers focus on the forced repatriation of Russian POWs, the situation of black GIs in Britain, and the British Free Corps, who were British POWs in Germany recruited to join the German cause and propagandize against the British in exchange for much better accommodations than they had in a POW camp -at least until after the War, when Britain charged them with treason. On the cultural side, there are frequent allusions to the post-War development boom and a consistent sense that big change, for better or worse, is in the air. ""The Killing Time"" is the weakest of these three episodes, with behavior that is simply not believable or accurate. The other two are quite good, though. The Acorn DVD set has no bonus features. English subtitles are optional. These are the episodes:June 1945. DCI Foyle is anxious to resign and get on with other plans, but he's compelled to stay on until a replacement can be found. A pompous old acquaintance now working for the War Office, Brigadier Timothy Wilson (Tim Pigott-Smith), asks Foyle to quietly track down an escaped Russian POW. The POW, Ivan, seeks help from his friend Nikolai Vladchenko (Dimitry Drannikov), who is working as a gardener on the estate of Sir Leonard Spencer-Jones (Christopher Good), where Sam Stewart is also employed. Ivan intends to go to ""The Russian House"", a safe house of White Russians in London, which he hopes will protect him from deportation. But Sir Leonard is shot in his home. DI Paul Milner, now working in Brighton, is on that case, while Foyle and Sam follow the Russians to London.July 1945. In ""The Killing Time"", American Major Wesker (Adam James) requests that the Hastings council impose temporary racial segregation on the town's bars, as there have been hostilities between black and white GIs on the base now that the fighting is over and the men are waiting to return home. A young woman staying in Sam's guest house, Mandy Dean (Charlotte Riley), is shunned by her family on account of her illegitimate child, whose father is Gabe Kelly (Obi Abili), a GI whom Mandy hopes to marry. Meanwhile, there is a rash of roadway hold-ups that target prominent citizens. Racial tensions escalate on the American base, encouraged by the intolerant Sgt. Calhoun (John Sharian). And a body is discovered in the woods. This episode has enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.August 1945. ""The Hide"" sees Foyle resign from his position in the Hastings Police to follow an old case to America. Before he leaves, he reads that a soldier named James Devereaux (Andrew Scott) will soon be tried for treason for his participation in the British Free Corps while a POW in Germany. Foyle visits Devereaux's lawyer Mr. Deakin (Will Keen) to inquire about  the case, only to find that the young man refuses to defend himself. Upon speaking with Devereux in prison, Foyle becomes convinced that he is hiding something important. Investigating in an unofficial capacity, Foyle crosses paths with DI Milner who is investigating the murder of young Agnes Littleton, a friend of the accused traitor. Foyle's motives in this case are, at first, as mysterious as Devereaux's.",4,Still Plenty of Politics and Violence for Foyle to Sort Out in the Months After the War.,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,4025,"['Foyle', 'War', '6', 'tackles', 'England', 'first', 'post-War', 'summer', 'when', 'everyone', 'sense', 'world', 'changed', 'Life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'one', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'Hastings', 'new', 'modern', 'police', 'station', 'DCI', 'Foyle', 'nothing', 'more', 'get', 'away', 'resign', 'pursue', 'unfinished', 'business', 'one', 'will', 'let', 'quite', 'yet', 'Sam', 'Stewart', 'uniform', 'Paul', 'Milner', 'now', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Brighton', 'struggling', 'new', 'sergeant', 'who', 'not', 'especially', 'sharp', 'trying', 'make', 'name', 'Foyle', 'trying', 'clumsily', 'causing', 'friction', 'former', 'boss', 'Milner', 'more', 'background', 'now', 'previous', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'appear', 'Killing', 'Time', 'months', 'War', 'was', 'still', 'plenty', 'political', 'intrigue', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'writers', 'focus', 'forced', 'repatriation', 'Russian', 'POWs', 'situation', 'black', 'GIs', 'Britain', 'British', 'Free', 'Corps', 'who', 'were', 'British', 'POWs', 'Germany', 'recruited', 'join', 'German', 'cause', 'propagandize', 'British', 'exchange', 'much', 'better', 'accommodations', 'had', 'POW', 'camp', '-at', 'least', 'War', 'when', 'Britain', 'charged', 'treason', 'cultural', 'side', 'are', 'frequent', 'allusions', 'post-War', 'development', 'boom', 'consistent', 'sense', 'big', 'change', 'better', 'worse', 'air', 'Killing', 'Time', 'weakest', 'three', 'episodes', 'behavior', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'accurate', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'though', 'Acorn', 'DVD', 'set', 'bonus', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'optional', 'are', 'episodes', 'June', '1945', 'DCI', 'Foyle', 'anxious', 'resign', 'get', 'other', 'plans', 'compelled', 'stay', 'replacement', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'pompous', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'now', 'working', 'War', 'Office', 'Brigadier', 'Timothy', 'Wilson', 'Tim', 'Pigott-Smith', 'Foyle', 'quietly', 'track', 'down', 'escaped', 'Russian', 'POW', 'POW', 'Ivan', 'help', 'friend', 'Nikolai', 'Vladchenko', 'Dimitry', 'Drannikov', 'who', 'working', 'gardener', 'estate', 'Sir', 'Leonard', 'Spencer-Jones', 'Christopher', 'Good', 'where', 'Sam', 'Stewart', 'also', 'employed', 'Ivan', 'go', 'Russian', 'House', 'safe', 'house', 'White', 'Russians', 'London', 'will', 'protect', 'deportation', 'Sir', 'Leonard', 'shot', 'home', 'DI', 'Paul', 'Milner', 'now', 'working', 'Brighton', 'case', 'Foyle', 'Sam', 'follow', 'Russians', 'London.July', '1945', 'Killing', 'Time', 'American', 'Major', 'Wesker', 'Adam', 'James', 'Hastings', 'council', 'impose', 'temporary', 'racial', 'segregation', 'town', 'bars', 'have', 'been', 'hostilities', 'black', 'white', 'GIs', 'base', 'now', 'fighting', 'men', 'are', 'waiting', 'return', 'home', 'young', 'woman', 'staying', 'Sam', 'guest', 'house', 'Mandy', 'Dean', 'Charlotte', 'Riley', 'shunned', 'family', 'account', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'father', 'Gabe', 'Kelly', 'Obi', 'Abili', 'GI', 'whom', 'Mandy', 'marry', 'Meanwhile', 'rash', 'roadway', 'hold-ups', 'target', 'prominent', 'citizens', 'Racial', 'tensions', 'escalate', 'American', 'base', 'encouraged', 'intolerant', 'Sgt', 'Calhoun', 'John', 'Sharian', 'body', 'discovered', 'woods', 'episode', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'interesting.August', '1945', 'Hide', 'Foyle', 'resign', 'position', 'Hastings', 'Police', 'follow', 'old', 'case', 'America', 'soldier', 'named', 'James', 'Devereaux', 'Andrew', 'Scott', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'tried', 'treason', 'participation', 'British', 'Free', 'Corps', 'POW', 'Germany', 'Foyle', 'Devereaux', 'lawyer', 'Mr.', 'Deakin', 'Will', 'Keen', 'inquire', 'case', 'only', 'find', 'young', 'man', 'defend', 'speaking', 'Devereux', 'prison', 'Foyle', 'convinced', 'hiding', 'something', 'important', 'Investigating', 'unofficial', 'capacity', 'Foyle', 'paths', 'DI', 'Milner', 'who', 'investigating', 'murder', 'young', 'Agnes', 'Littleton', 'friend', 'accused', 'traitor', 'Foyle', 'motives', 'case', 'are', 'first', 'as', 'mysterious', 'Devereaux']",N/A

So, just when we had reluctantly said goodbye to this outstanding police procedural --it had reached its planned conclusion -- we get more.  Thank you, gods of ITV.The historical mystery series set in the quaint - and historical--south coast English city of Hastings during World War II, made its ITV debut in October, 2002, and its PBS debut in February, 2003.  Set 6 comes to us now as a boxed three DVD set consisting of the complete UK broadcast edition of three new mysteries, approximately 300 minutes.  And to add to the general joy, there are subtitles, too.  As with the previous episodes, that took us through World War II, these encore episodes, that are set immediately after the end of the war, are based on  substantial research into lesser-known facets of the war and its aftermath.  They are handsomely filmed on location, with excellent period costume, accurate transportation, and interiors, no lack of extras and vehicles; the cop shops and streets are bustling, as they should be.  The plots are intriguing, complex, many-layered, driven by compelling characters, chief of which must be Michael Kitchen, (Out of Africa: 25th Anniversary (Blu-ray/DVD Combo);Reckless) playing Detective Chief Supervisor Christopher Foyle, a man of undying rectitude, yet with a sly sense of humor.  The brilliant scriptwriter Anthony Horowitz (Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection;Midsomer Murders: Set 15), who created the series and wrote most of its episodes,  has also found ways to bring back co-stars Anthony Howell as Foyle's former subordinate, Detective Inspector Paul Milner, and Honeysuckle Weeks as Foyle's former driver, Samantha Stewart.  In addition, the current series features such guest stars as Tim Pigott-Smith (The Jewel in the Crown - Complete Set [VHS]), and Eleanor Bron (The House of Mirth); also Max Brown, Christopher Good, and David Yelland.The mysteries are:The Russian House.  June 1945. The end of the war finds Britain holding 20,000 Russian prisoners of war, who fought for the Germans.  The country is anxious to repatriate them without incident, as the Russians are somehow holding a similar number of British POW's that it wants back.  A couple of Russians escape.  Foyle, who wants to retire, still agrees to help British Intelligence officials search for them.  His investigation bumps into a murder investigation run by his former subordinate Milner: there's some conflict between them.  Sam also shows up: she'd been working for the murder victim.  As I have noted before, scriptwriter Horowitz is always at his strongest in tales of father/son conflict, and he's created one here.Killing Time. July 1945.  Black American GI's are being warehoused in Hastings, killing time, as they wait to be returned to the States.  Racial tensions accompany these men, and impinge on the British.  Should prove emotionally resonant for most Americans.The Hide.  August 1945.  DI Milner looks into the murder of a young woman in Brighton; Foyle is drawn into a search for the motives of an accused traitor who refuses to defend himself, and therefore will be hanged.  The investigations converge.  Another of Horowitz's particularly strong stories of father/son conflict.This series is literate and thoughtful, as it has explored the moral gray areas of war.  It has won numerous awards, been greatly praised by the critics, and proven extremely popular.  If you are a mystery fan who isn't yet familiar with it, you don't know what you're missing.  The episodes are free-standing; you can begin here with set 6, but untold pleasures await you should you go back to the beginning, with set 1.",5,Hip Hip Hooray!

1275244,AANR4ZA4CC4OS,B002KMIW6K,Talentseer,"[21, 45]","There is nothing better than the Brits' mysteries adaptations.  I own all of the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series, all of the David Suchet Poirot Series, and now all the Foyle's War set.  But let me say what is bothering me about Foyle's War, especially this latest (6th in the US) version.  In no particular order:  ever since the exectives decided to put the hatchet to the series at the end of Foyle's War 4 (mid-1943 timeline) it has been a very awkward reach.  Foyle's War 5 came in at just three stories instead of the previous four for all previous sets.  It was so obvious that they just had to ""hurry up and end it in three stories"" and it never worked.  Hey!  What happened to 1944?  So then the powers that be opened it up again, great, but why move on to post-war?  All of the actors are still recent enough...and young and current enough...to Series' five abrupt shut down in 2007 that the stories could easily have gone back and done 1944.  No one would have noticed. You still can!  Just call it Foyle's War 4.5, put Sam back in the car and none of your fans will mind!  But you better do it in the next year...assuming you remain in production.  Next point:  ""Killing Time"" is a clumsy British stab at American liberals' political correctness, and it angers me.  I buy this product to be entertained, not lectured to.  Mr. Horowitz, if you choose one more time to lecture me about my country, then I will STOP BUYING YOUR PRODUCT.  I, like many other reviewers here, hated ""Killing Time"" and I fast-forwarded it at the half-way mark.  Of course, gee, whaddaya know, it's an evil white man that's the murderer. You're the one that's racist, Mr. Horowitz, by ramming your own British political correctness down my American throat. ""Killing Time"" just alienated 50% of your current and future audiences in the States...do you not see this, Mr. Horowitz?  60% of Americans are conservatives, not liberals.  Stop with the politics and just write a good mystery, ok?  Next point:  I literally gasped at the lack of any makeup on Sam in her first appearance in this new set when she walked into the artist's studio.  Like, hey, guys, who forgot about the makeup?  She absolutely looks ghastly.  Sorry, Sam!  Later, she starts to look better, but that first shot...good God...awful!  Looked like a pale, ghastly ghost!  And my final point.  Will someoneone please tell Anthony Horowitz, great literary talent that he is, to PLEASE stop with the unwanted pregnancies and consciencious objectors!  Please, Tony?  With sugar on it?  I mean, come on.  This must be the fourth time...and I am not making that up...in the complete series we get yet ANOTHER illegitimate pregancy and ANOTHER ""conshy.""  ENOUGH!  STOP IT!  And I will also add for Mr. Horowitz that it would be nice to see one of his returning war veterans actually be an authentic and stable patriot and hero instead of what appears to be Horowitz' preferred portrayal of all returning troops as wacked-out, mentally-ill, nut jobs.  Everyone of Horowitz' returning troops have been portrayed this way, and I don't like it.  ""The Russian House"" takes too long to develop.  The only saving grace to this set is ""The Hide"" which is an outstanding story, easily one of the series' best, but not enough to save Set 6.  So there.  Go ahead and hate me.  I enjoyed previous Foyle's Wars, but I'm afraid that I'll prefer Sets 1-4 when it was clicking along like clockwork.  Sad for Michael Kitchen and the actors who have all done a wonderful job, not their fault.

He is simply too good to be replaced, according to his superiors.  Set 6 is actually the episodes from season 7 (because set 4 includes seasons 4 & 5).  With many series, the longer they last the more political they become. Foyle's War is no different.  The social commentary in set 5 and in this set sometimes seems more important than the stories themselves.  However, the writing is still excellent and there are some interesting twists here.  In set five, the three main characters have parted and gone their separate ways.  Set 6 brings them unexpectedly back together.
