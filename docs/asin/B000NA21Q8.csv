Alexander ""once met........................""","[4, 6]","Smashing Cast, direction-extraordinaire, wonderful acting (delightfully-portrayed  - following real-life events upon the high seas - reducing all fair and decent-minded people to tears of impotent frustration and despair.) Nota Bene: The 'burning' desire (to 'do' something in order to help these poor, innocent, beautiful 'children of the Universe' by protecting and releasing Them from Their never-ending nightmare, having to encounter - 'circumstances of embarkation'; Wholly Irrelevant - an; out-of-control 'mob' of howling, murderous demons in human form and attire) is overwhelming, throughout most of the film.

This is one I'll be sharing with everyone I know.  Such a sad story but one that needed to be told.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat and have you rooting for Omar Epp's character to somehow escape his brother and the other seven stowaway's fate.  Very tragic but it culminates to a very justifiable ending.

Just how much of it actually happened one can only guess at; that said, after seeing this film on cable TV years ago, I knew I'd have to get it on DVD someday. Not a long film; however, it captivates the viewer and once it starts, it never lets up until the very end.
