I'm not an Nsync fan, I am a movie fan. If you are a movie fan, don't skip over this because you dislike Nsync. The movie is about a guy named Kevin who is a complete chicken when it comes to love. He meets a girl on the train, but fails to get her number. He spends the rest of the movie wishing he had and then haplessly searching for her in Chicago. Lance Bass, believe it or not, does have presence on screen. And Joey Fatone, well, he steals the show. This guy is worth seeing the movie. He's so funny and his mannerisms cracked me up. There's one scene where he's singing &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; and he's pouring sugar down his throat. He chokes on it in front of everyone at this bar. It was hilarious. There is tons of other stuff like that, so see this movie.

My teenage sister and I rented this when we had a terrible flu, and the only reason we finished watching it was because we were both literally too sick to get up and switch it off. The acting is bad, the script is bad, the casting is bad, the premise is bad, and the photography is stupifyingly awful. It should be understood that both my sister and myself are mild fans of N'SYNC; we own the albums and my sis has seen them live (whatever their faults, the members of N'SYNC are electrifying performers, and worth seeing in concert even for non-fans for the sheer energy they bring to the stage).That is why this movie is all the more offensive; the fans deservce better than this sloppy and lazy production. The plot, such as there is, concerns the trials and tribulations of a young man, played by Lance Bass, as he attempts to locate the dream girl he met on the subway and instantly fell for. This is where we run into our first problem: Bass. He is the LEAST charasmatic member of the group, why is he the one starring in his own movie? At the end of the film , fellow bandmates Justin Timberlake and Chris Kirpatrick make an appearance in a ... ""behind the scenes look"" ; this two minute segment is far funnier than anything in the movie (""I got three words for you: Dee-Knee-RO!"") and demonstrates that Timberlake should be the one with his own movie.Bass actually formed his own production company to produce this film, and after its abysmal box-office take he would be well advised to stick to outerspace. And as regards the ""performance"" of Joey Fatone, well, my Mom always said if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.I'll say it anyway: He is bad. BAD.All in all, a dull, uninteresting film that should be avoided by anyone who is not 100% devoted to all things 'Sync.

The whole movie is very predictable and decent performances, and overall is a fun movie. Lance Bass stars as Kevin who falls in love with a girl he meets on the L train played by the gorgous and charming Emmanuelle Chriqui. He foregts to get her number then the whole city and his friends help him find the girl of his dreams. Parts of the movie are kind of rediculous. Why would a whole city care about helping this guy? Lance gives an ok performance, but he seems very stiff and tried way to hard to &quot;act&quot;, but he is likeable. Joey Fatone adds some comic fun to his role, but he as well is trying way too hard, and comes off as a charicture instead of a real person, and the same could be said about the supporting cast. It is enjoyable, and the soundtrack is a lot of fun, and it is definetly one of those films you can just kick back, relax, and watch with a bunch of friends, probably making fun of it.

Well it's really not the preteen-oriented movie I feared, it's basically just a standard twentysomething romantic comedy with an emphasis on collegiate humour, and is above average for it's genre. I'm assuming the movie totally wasn't written with the N Sync members in mind, and if anyone else from young hollywood had been cast for Lance Bass' part the movie would have had a better shot at reaching a wider audience. Nothing against Lance or Joey though, they're fine in their parts. It was really mostly the cover that put me off considering watching the movie. This movie is an equal peer of movies like The Bachelor, The Sweetest Thing, 40 Days And 40 Nights, 100 Women, and Loser.",4,Please enter a title for your review,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,1142,"['do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'made', 'decide', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'fact', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'Newsradio', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'was', 'mean', 'look', 'cover', 'Joey', 'Fatone', 'retarded', 'pose', 'guitar', 'Lance', 'Bass', 'looking', 'grinning', 'mannequin', 'title', 'outlined', 'pink', 'purple', 'have', 'figure', 'substanceless', 'preteen-oriented', 'fluff', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'chose', 'be', 'involved', 'maybe', 'more', 'Well', 'really', 'not', 'preteen-oriented', 'movie', 'feared', 'basically', 'just', 'standard', 'twentysomething', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'emphasis', 'collegiate', 'humour', 'above', 'average', 'genre', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'movie', 'totally', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'N', 'Sync', 'members', 'mind', 'anyone', 'else', 'young', 'hollywood', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'Lance', 'Bass', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'shot', 'reaching', 'wider', 'audience', 'Nothing', 'Lance', 'Joey', ""'re"", 'fine', 'parts', 'was', 'really', 'mostly', 'cover', 'put', 'off', 'considering', 'watching', 'movie', 'movie', 'equal', 'peer', 'movies', 'Bachelor', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', '40', 'Days', '40', 'Nights', '100', 'Women', 'Loser']",N/A

686910,A3N9TGJFS6IQFY,B00005V1Y3,SheLikesDvds.com,"[0, 0]","On the Line is a story about Kevin (played by Lance Bass from NSync), a guy who has always failed in the love department because he's never had the guts to take big risks when it comes to his heart. One day while riding the L-train, he meets a girl with whom he has an immediate connection.... , he doesn't get her name or phone number. As soon as she out of sight, he realizes how monumental his mistake is. Kevin takes the biggest gamble of his life and places flyers all over town searching for the L-train girl. A local newspaper picks up the story and things start to snowball out of control. Hundreds of women contact him but none of them are the right the girl-the L-train girl. Will he find her? Is it true love? Well, this is a film about romance so you figure it out.On the Line is a fluff movie without any real bite. For the 12-year-old diehard NSync fans, this PG piece of pap is at least palatable but for all of the grown-ups out there, I suggest that you just say no. The brightest spot in the entire film is the performance of Jerry Stiller-as the gruff but loveable office guy who dispenses advice and insults equally. Unfortunately, he appears to be one of the few gifted actors in this production. Lance Bass and Joey Fatone from NSync make a phenomenal effort but it just doesn't fly but at least they can laugh at themselves. For a few extra giggles, hang on past the credits and see the other band members (dressed as hairdressers) take pot shots at Lance and Joey. This extra is a real blast. To be fair, this movie was not nearly as bad as I imagined. For everyone else besides the NSync fans, I warn you that the plot drags, the acting is mediocre, and the story is a bad rewrite of Serendipity. I can't give a rave review but I won't slam it completely, I give it a C-.",2,Fine if your a 12 year-old girl,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,1796,"['Line', 'story', 'Kevin', 'played', 'Lance', 'Bass', 'NSync', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'failed', 'love', 'department', 'never', 'had', 'guts', 'take', 'big', 'risks', 'when', 'heart', 'One', 'day', 'riding', 'L-train', 'girl', 'whom', 'immediate', 'connection', ""n't"", 'get', 'name', 'phone', 'number', 'As', 'soon', 'sight', 'how', 'monumental', 'mistake', 'Kevin', 'biggest', 'gamble', 'life', 'places', 'flyers', 'town', 'searching', 'L-train', 'girl', 'local', 'newspaper', 'up', 'story', 'things', 'start', 'snowball', 'control', 'Hundreds', 'women', 'contact', 'none', 'are', 'right', 'girl-the', 'L-train', 'girl', 'Will', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'Well', 'film', 'romance', 'figure', 'Line', 'fluff', 'movie', 'real', 'bite', '12-year-old', 'diehard', 'NSync', 'fans', 'PG', 'piece', 'pap', 'least', 'palatable', 'grown-ups', 'there', 'suggest', 'just', 'say', 'no', 'brightest', 'spot', 'entire', 'film', 'performance', 'Jerry', 'Stiller-as', 'gruff', 'loveable', 'office', 'guy', 'who', 'advice', 'insults', 'equally', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'gifted', 'actors', 'production', 'Lance', 'Bass', 'Joey', 'Fatone', 'NSync', 'make', 'phenomenal', 'effort', 'just', ""n't"", 'fly', 'least', 'can', 'laugh', 'few', 'extra', 'giggles', 'hang', 'credits', 'see', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'dressed', 'hairdressers', 'take', 'pot', 'shots', 'Lance', 'Joey', 'extra', 'real', 'blast', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'imagined', 'everyone', 'else', 'NSync', 'fans', 'warn', 'plot', 'drags', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'story', 'bad', 'rewrite', 'Serendipity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'rave', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'slam', 'completely', 'give', 'C-']",N/A

This is the movie I wouldn't be embarrassed to watch with my little sister.  But don't think that's bad for the plot, because it made it even better I think. It was clean, funny, and sweet. That combination is hard to find in the modern movies these days. The actors did a good job, the music was good, and the story was cool. What could get better! Anyway, this is a fun movie, and I hope you enjoy it! By the way, the people who said this movie stank....well, they can't see strait.
