In a nutshell, Mother Nature has a family reunion with her ""children"", including The Tides, Earthquake, North Wind and the Miser Brothers (Heat Miser and Snow Miser).The narcissistic lavender-hued North Wind poses an unusual question during the meeting: if something happened to Santa Claus, who would deliver the presents to the good children? Since the North Pole falls under the domain of the North Wind, it's determined that he would be in charge.Enter evil plan to destroy Santa and take over Christmas!Will the Heat Miser and Snow Miser be able to put aside their differences to help Santa? And what happens when Santa throws out his back right before Christmas? Who sabotaged Santa's sleigh...and can elf Tinsel, chief engineer, remedy the situation?The animation is fantastic in this DVD (yes, it appears to be stop-motion!)

As an adult I enjoyed it for what it is. I agree that the worst things were the change (look) of Mrs. Claus. Her hair was styled up with a rubber band looking thing like you would do for a Barbie doll. The original Mrs. Clause was adorable both physically, and vocally. The songs were AWFUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLL, and the wind villian was just full of hot air. He really wasn't necessary in the story, and made for a predictable villian/movie out come. I loved how they got Mickey Rooney to play Santa Claus again. They gave santa a good joyful feel to his character. I also enjoyed the physical re-design of the Santa character. Also, I didn't mind the changes they had made to mother nature. In the first movie I never cared for her looks (a swamp hag with bad fashion sense). At least in this version her physical appearance was cute.I loved her voice. It was soothing to hear. I don't know how I feel about the subtle changes they had made to the brothers? Snow looked a little too harsh...Heat basically looked the same, but had new clothes. To get to the over all point, this is a movie that will keep kids occupide while you wrap Christmas gifts. However, for the adults who just want to see a sequel, then understand you can't have high expectations on this film. Enjoy it for what it offers you.Also, what happened to Jingle and Jangle?
