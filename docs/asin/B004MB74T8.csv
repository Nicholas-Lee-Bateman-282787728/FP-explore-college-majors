Plus, the extra features bring the DVD closer to an hour.In this augmentation to the original movie, no one believes the BoneKnapper dragon exists, and they especially don't believe Gobber's stories that said dragon has singled him out for a lifetime of torment! Still, the kids dutifully go with Gobber to avenge years of destruction blamed on the legend.With a mixture of computer animation and cartoon flashbacks, we see Gobber's story from both ends.  It's a fun tail of unspeakable treasure, frozen vikings trapped in a glacier that punch you in the face, hammerhead sharks, a hammerhead yak, a hammerhead whale, a hammerhead yak riding a hammerhead whale...making the kids doubt Gobber more with every word, until...If you're the type where length matters, and you'd rather have long and boring than short, funny and exciting, don't bother with this DVD.

I was unaware of this particular one until recently.  They watched it and wanted more.  I am really happy that cartoon network has decided to make a series on these stories cause there is something about the characters that make it fun to watch and connect to.  I find myself sitting and watching it with them and see that they have a moral and children can learn and even see themselves in the movies.
