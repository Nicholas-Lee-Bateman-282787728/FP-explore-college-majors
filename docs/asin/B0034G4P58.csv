1323822,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B0034G4P58,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","The Eagle, I have to say, impressed me.Kevin MacDonaldkeeps the film on slow-burn tension, with gorgeous cinematography, realistic costumes and settings, and a fine cast (minus the Channing). I felt it was a real old-school epic; little to no CGI, lots of extras, real sets, gorgeously lush and atmospheric locations, a simpleminded but rousing storyline about a man who puts honor and the safety of his men first, and some good old fashioned action.A pity then, that it's lead,Channing Tatum, is so...uninspired. He really shows no emotional arc or even any emotion, period, in the film. His drama scenes fall flat, and his accent is as lost as the legion. Don't get me wrong, I thought he was great in the fighting scenes; a good-looking, sword-wielding centurion, but I wished there was a more mature actor in the role of Marcus Decimus Merid--erm...Marcus Flavius Aquila. Thankfully, he is backed up by a more than able cast.Jamie Bellgives a subtle, sympathetic, and excellent performance as the slave Esca, and his relationship with Aquila is riveting and interesting. He was perhaps the highlight of the film. This is a mature actor that we all want to see more of.Donald Sutherlandis an accomplished actor, so there was no reason he had to use his Canadian accent instead of a more authentic, or at least believable, ""Roman"" accent. I'm kidding, there is no such thing as a Roman accent, but at least a British one would be less jarring. Still, he is beyond criticism.The big highlight for me, though, wasMark Strongas Gurn. Strong is one of my favourite actors. He's incredibly talented and versatile, tough, cool, and always gives a nuanced, scene-stealing performance. He was the high point of the film, and his deserting legionary was an engaging, interesting, and awesome character.The villains are dastardly. Painted, tattooed, plumed, dressed in seal skins and carrying weapons of wood, flint, bone, and salvaged steel, the Seal People are both effectively interesting, realistic, and menacing. The film isn't really clear on who's bad and who's good. Like most wars, both sides have their tragedies and heroes, and both sides are relateable and sympathetic once you hear their side of the story.From a technical viewpoint, the film is superb. The cinematography is grand and realistic. The world of The Eagle is a world of wet dark forests, moors, glens, tall mountains, and cold and mud and heather and fire. It is incredibly atmospheric; so much so it's surprising how much a film that did not connect at the box office, or with critics can linger in the mind. There are images I remember even now; Marcus Aquila standing wounded by the Eagle standard, the funeral pyre of a beloved warrior, sparks floating into the sky, the last stand of the Ninth Legion, the endless moors divided by Hadrian's Wall - the end of the world.The costumes are incredible; authentic, lived-in, muddied in, well-researched and period accurate. The armour of the Roman legionnaire's are scuffed and worn, muddied and bloodied. The Celts and Britons wear furs, bound roughly with thick thread, homespun, and wool.The action, when it comes, is engaging and well shot, though at times I wished for less shaky-cam. It is frantic, frenetic, down and dirty brawling with swords and clubs and bows. The contestants always seem real to us, so we wince when one falls. The final battle was very memorable and haunting.Let's talk cons. Number one, the screenplay. It sags near the middle, with the recovering Marcus, and at times feels like it should be more action-packed. But as I said, The Eagle is not over the top and in your face, but more subtle and slow-burning. Number two, the convenient arrival of the last remnants of the Ninth is both unrealistic and smells of Hollywood cheese, as does Tatum's final one-liner (""What shall we do next?"" ""You decide""). And I already mentioned Tatum's acting. He must have confused the worlds solid and laconic with ""do nothing and stare pinefully into the camera.""But on the whole, The Eagle remains a pleasant surprise. Kevin MacDonald is an adept director whose film is visually stunning, technically excellent, very realistic, dramatic, and atmospheric. Tatum's performance is best when he has a sword in his hand, decapitating people, but the rest of the actors are excellent, turning in subtle, sympathetic roles. The story may, at times, lack drive or action and smell of uncharacteristic sentimentality, it is, on the whole, an old-school, refreshingly realistic sword-and-sandals adventure! Colour me impressed.My rating? Four eagles out of five.P.S. Check out the excellent book by Rosemary SutcliffThe Eagle of the Ninth!

This film takes place around the year 100 AD when there were multiple wild tribes, many of Celtic ancestry, surrounding the isle of civilization that the Romans brought to the British island.  It is correct to say British when referring to the island during this period. It is not until the Anglo-Saxon invasions and occupation that the term England began to be applied. Anyway, back to the review, this is the story of a young Roman officer assigned to the British island at his own request to explore, discover, the facts around his father's disappearance along with the Roman Ninth Legion which his father led.  One nice touch in the movie is the contrast between the Mediterranean style villas and gardens as compared to the animal skin huts of the wild tribes. The Romans brought written language, law, procedures, and a host of other technologies that helped them subdue the British wilderness. The story is a fairly predictable tale of adventure, of conflicts and misunderstandings revolved, of escape from danger and setting the world right again. It is an adventure tale and in my opinion was pretty well told. The primeval forests and rocky coasts of Britain are beautifully photographed.  Roman soldiers who served for 12 years were given a farm in a conquered nation and the rough soldiers certainly earn their living when stationed on the outskirts of the Empire in Britain.Channing Tatum does a respectable job of acting in the film as does Jamie Bell. Channing Tatum, as Marcus Flavius Aquila, is the son of the commanding officer of the Ninth Legion who crossed Hadrian's Wall and entered the depths of wild Caledonia. Aquila shows considerable leadership skills and bravery, is given honors and an honorable discharge, but then decides to stay in Britain to solve the mystery of the missing legion and the fate of his father, whose reputation has been disgraced by the disappearance of a full legion of men. The film is also about the relationship between Centurion Aquila and his Celtic slave, Esca, played by Jaime Bell. Together they cross Hadrian's wall and enter the wilderness north of the Roman territories.The film is successful because it is not overly ambitious. There is a story to tell, characters to be developed, and this it does with realistic depictions of hand to hand warfare and the dirty living conditions of life at this time. Neither the Romans nor Celts are depicted as evil, just men in conflict with men, occupiers against the occupied.Donald Sutherland plays the uncle of Aquila with wit and humor. The striking Tahar Rahim plays the son of the tribal chief of the Seal People who play a major role in the issue of whether the Roman Ninth Legion regains its honor.I found this film to be good solid entertainment about a fascinating time in British history.",4,Adventure story around the Roman occupation of Britain.,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,2897,"['sometimes', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Romans', 'occupied', 'Britain', '34', 'BC', '410', 'AD', 'film', 'place', 'year', '100', 'AD', 'when', 'were', 'multiple', 'wild', 'tribes', 'many', 'Celtic', 'ancestry', 'surrounding', 'isle', 'civilization', 'Romans', 'brought', 'British', 'island', 'correct', 'say', 'British', 'when', 'referring', 'island', 'period', 'not', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'invasions', 'occupation', 'term', 'England', 'began', 'be', 'applied', 'Anyway', 'back', 'review', 'story', 'young', 'Roman', 'officer', 'assigned', 'British', 'island', 'own', 'request', 'explore', 'discover', 'facts', 'father', 'disappearance', 'Roman', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'father', 'led', 'One', 'nice', 'touch', 'movie', 'contrast', 'Mediterranean', 'style', 'villas', 'gardens', 'compared', 'animal', 'skin', 'huts', 'wild', 'tribes', 'Romans', 'brought', 'written', 'language', 'law', 'procedures', 'host', 'other', 'technologies', 'helped', 'subdue', 'British', 'wilderness', 'story', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'tale', 'adventure', 'conflicts', 'misunderstandings', 'revolved', 'escape', 'danger', 'setting', 'world', 'right', 'again', 'adventure', 'tale', 'opinion', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'told', 'primeval', 'forests', 'rocky', 'coasts', 'Britain', 'are', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'who', 'served', '12', 'years', 'were', 'given', 'farm', 'conquered', 'nation', 'rough', 'soldiers', 'certainly', 'earn', 'living', 'when', 'stationed', 'outskirts', 'Empire', 'Britain.Channing', 'Tatum', 'respectable', 'job', 'acting', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Marcus', 'Flavius', 'Aquila', 'son', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'who', 'crossed', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'entered', 'depths', 'wild', 'Caledonia', 'Aquila', 'considerable', 'leadership', 'skills', 'bravery', 'given', 'honors', 'honorable', 'discharge', 'then', 'stay', 'Britain', 'solve', 'mystery', 'missing', 'legion', 'fate', 'father', 'reputation', 'been', 'disgraced', 'disappearance', 'full', 'legion', 'men', 'film', 'also', 'relationship', 'Centurion', 'Aquila', 'Celtic', 'slave', 'Esca', 'played', 'Jaime', 'Bell', 'Together', 'cross', 'Hadrian', 'wall', 'enter', 'wilderness', 'north', 'Roman', 'territories.The', 'film', 'successful', 'not', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'story', 'tell', 'characters', 'be', 'developed', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'hand', 'hand', 'warfare', 'dirty', 'living', 'conditions', 'life', 'time', 'Romans', 'Celts', 'are', 'depicted', 'evil', 'just', 'men', 'conflict', 'men', 'occupiers', 'occupied.Donald', 'Sutherland', 'uncle', 'Aquila', 'wit', 'humor', 'striking', 'Tahar', 'Rahim', 'son', 'tribal', 'chief', 'Seal', 'People', 'who', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'issue', 'Roman', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'honor.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'good', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'fascinating', 'time', 'British', 'history']",N/A

The current going theory is that they were wiped out in combat in the Eastern Provinces, but there's also a theory that they were destroyed fighting the Picts in what is now called Scotland. That's the jumping-off point for The Eagle, a rather lightweight sword and sandals film staring Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell.Tatum plays Marcus Flavius Aquila, son of the commander of the Ninth Legion. He's gone into the army himself and worked hard to get sent to Britannia, where he hopes to not only recover his father's honor, but also that of the Legion and to recover it's beloved standard; a gold eagle. The Roman legions fetishized their eagles (or ""aquila"", a word suspiciously similiar to the last name of our hero), to an impressive degree. Better in many ways to lose every man in your legion than to lose your standard.Anyhow, young Marcus gets to Britannia, takes command of a legion, promptly gets injured and drummed out of the service, then acquires Esca (Jamie Bell), a young slave. He eventually hatches a plan to find the Eagle and along with Esca, heads north into darkest Caledonia. Along the way the two fight, bond and generally have an interesting time of it.I really enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining, well-done and well-paced. Several of the plot twists were telegraphed well in advance, including the biggest one, which was shown to us in the trailers. But that minor complaint aside, it was good. The historical accuracy was decent (though some of the tactics the Romans employ made me roll my eyes. Where's your pila, boys?), and anytime I see a movie with Romans not using stirrups I get a least a bit happy. Plus it was cool hearing the Picts speaking Gaelic. Yes, it wasn't Pictish, but it was the best they could do, and at least it wasn't the Pictsies. Also, the acting was quite decent, and Channing Tatum seems to have done a good job of redeeming himself after some of his other works.This is minor escapist fare. It's nothing great, but it is pretty fun and on the whole there's certainly far worse ways to spend a couple hours.",4,Senatus populesque Romanus!,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,2142,"['Back', 'early', 'second', 'century', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'disappeared', 'history', 'current', 'going', 'theory', 'were', 'wiped', 'out', 'combat', 'Eastern', 'Provinces', 'also', 'theory', 'were', 'destroyed', 'fighting', 'Picts', 'what', 'now', 'called', 'Scotland', 'jumping-off', 'point', 'Eagle', 'rather', 'lightweight', 'sword', 'sandals', 'film', 'staring', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Jamie', 'Bell.Tatum', 'Marcus', 'Flavius', 'Aquila', 'son', 'commander', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'gone', 'army', 'worked', 'hard', 'get', 'sent', 'Britannia', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'recover', 'father', 'honor', 'also', 'Legion', 'recover', 'beloved', 'standard', 'gold', 'eagle', 'Roman', 'legions', 'fetishized', 'eagles', 'aquila', 'word', 'suspiciously', 'last', 'name', 'hero', 'impressive', 'degree', 'Better', 'many', 'ways', 'lose', 'man', 'legion', 'lose', 'standard.Anyhow', 'young', 'Marcus', 'Britannia', 'command', 'legion', 'promptly', 'injured', 'drummed', 'service', 'then', 'Esca', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'young', 'slave', 'eventually', 'plan', 'find', 'Eagle', 'Esca', 'north', 'darkest', 'Caledonia', 'way', 'two', 'fight', 'bond', 'generally', 'have', 'interesting', 'time', 'it.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'well-done', 'well-paced', 'Several', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'telegraphed', 'well', 'advance', 'including', 'biggest', 'one', 'was', 'shown', 'trailers', 'minor', 'complaint', 'aside', 'was', 'good', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'was', 'decent', 'tactics', 'Romans', 'employ', 'made', 'roll', 'eyes', 'Where', 'pila', 'boys', 'anytime', 'see', 'movie', 'Romans', 'not', 'using', 'stirrups', 'get', 'least', 'bit', 'happy', 'was', 'cool', 'hearing', 'Picts', 'speaking', 'Gaelic', 'Yes', 'was', ""n't"", 'Pictish', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'Pictsies', 'Also', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'decent', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'redeeming', 'other', 'works.This', 'minor', 'escapist', 'fare', 'nothing', 'great', 'pretty', 'fun', 'whole', 'certainly', 'far', 'worse', 'ways', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours']",N/A

Once is bad enough (Centurion, which was bad enough), but twice?The Eagle is the Ninth's old story. The soldiers set out in 120 or so to bring some Roman peace to the Picts. They don't come back, and neither does the Eagle standard, which means loss of honor to Rome and to the unfortunate commander of the Ninth. Twenty years later his son, Marcus (Channing Tatum), after barely surviving an attack along the frontier, decides he will journey alone into the wilds of the north. He will discover whether his father, the commander, was a hero who died defending the Eagle, or a coward. He is determined to bring back the standard. He will take with him a slave, Esca (Jamie Bell), son of a defeated tribal leader who doesn't care one bit for the Romans. Impossible odds for Marcus, you say? Thank goodness this is a movie.Off Marcus and Esca go, over mountains and through valleys. The weather is chill and foggy and gets worse. Esca talks them through hostile encounters. They fight when they must. They learn more of the Ninth Legion...and they learn about a tribe in the far north...the Seal People. They find this ferocious tribe who enjoys wearing blue. Marcus now must play Esca's slave if the two are to survive. Yes, there is the Eagle, an escape, a few shaggy survivors of the Ninth, and an inspiring battle in a wet firth. Who lives? Who dies? Who cares?Unlike Centurion, which is more a video game than a movie, The Eagle can be interesting, at least in parts. It features fine performances by Jamie Bell and Donald Sutherland, who plays Marcus' uncle. Bell made his name when, as a 15-year-old, he was chosen to play the 11-year-old Billy Elliot. As an adult he may be small and wiry, but he has become an actor one notices. He's considerably more believable than Tatum. The wild scenery is well photographed. The Seal People's village and lives are raw, dangerous and filthy. The Prince of the Seal People (Tahar Rahim) makes an impressively blue adversary.Even more impressive is the first 20 or so minutes of the movie. Marcus arrives to take charge of a Roman outpost. He barely has time to know his troops before the outpost is attacked. A young fan of Roman history might learn a lot about how Roman soldiers can build a big wooden fort, how unpleasant life must have been for them and how to fight with the Roman short sword. Get together with some friends, bring your shields and you can practice going into battle in the testudo formation. This is a highlight of the movie. You'll impress your neighbors and any attacking Picts.The Eagle is sheer popcorn. It has some crunch, even though Channing Tatum is a soft center. It's hard to beat Roman empire building for entertainment.

1323834,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0034G4P58,C. Sawin,"[8, 13]","I didn't know much about The Eagle going into it. I had seen a TV spot or two, but it was pretty underwhelming and didn't seem to reveal much of anything about the plot of the film. Something about a war in Roman times starring the guy that played Duke in the G.I. Joe movie. When I realized I was going to a screening, I purposely avoided more TV spots and full-length trailers. The less you know about a film going into it, the better the experience will be. I also wasn't sure what to expect from Channing Tatum since he's been pretty mediocre at best even when it comes to the films he was a part of that I enjoyed. In the end, The Eagle may be some of Tatum's best work but I'm not exactly sure how much of a compliment that really is.For at least a few years now, I've firmly believed that a film can be good despite what its rating is. I still believe that. A good film is going to be good no matter what not just because it shows blood or nudity or just so happens to be family friendly. With that being said, I'm also under the impression that films revolving around heavy warfare should aim for the R-rating. War is brutal, relentless, and unforgiving. I believe it should be depicted that way on screen. The Eagle is obviously about more than spending time on the battlefield. War is more of a backdrop to the relationship between Marcus and Esca and the journey to find the Eagle in addition to its meaning to the Romans. However, no blood being shown during the most intense battle sequences of the film made it feel censored at times and seem weak in comparison to the films it'll make you reminisce about throughout its duration.Channing Tatum carries the film fairly well. There's one scene right before he heads off to try and find the Eagle where he's talking with Donald Sutherland and he makes a speech that Tatum just manages to put such power and emotion into. It's a short scene, but it's probably his highlight and helps display the passion Marcus has of restoring honor to his family's name. Jamie Bell's Esca was mostly interesting due to his true intentions being fairly unpredictable throughout the film. His British blood runs thick, but he owes his life to Marcus who happens to be a Roman. One of them eventually has to give. Seeing that play out is the main attraction to the Esca character. Donald Sutherland's appearance in the film isn't nearly as noteworthy as his appearance in The Mechanic. Sutherland seemed to make the most of his short screen time in The Mechanic while being rather flat in The Eagle despite having a bit more screen time in comparison. Sutherland's Uncle Aquila also stands in the way of his nephew Marcus in a roundabout kind of way by encouraging him to stay put and repeatedly informing him he has no chance of surviving north of the wall. Both characters Sutherland portrays are so different in comparison, which is probably a good thing at the end of the day. Mark Strong may be practically unrecognizable in this, as well. I'm convinced (and this is a partial spoiler) that he took over the reigns of only taking characters that die at the end of a film from Liam Neeson. It seems like Strong dies in every film he's a part of, doesn't it? Lastly, there's Tahar Rahim who has a very strong showing here. After seeing him in the outstanding A Prophet, it was great to not only see him in something else but see him perform just as well.Yet another film that suffers from shaky camera techniques during the most intense sequences in the film. Is just filming scenes like this normally just too boring for directors these days? If an intense fight sequence is edited well, do you even need the shaky bit? I never realized how often this technique was used until recently, but it seriously needs to go away more than any other trend currently taking place in Hollywood.The Eagle is a captivating drama with heavy hitting action sequences and a well-rounded cast that contains elements of 300, Gladiator, and even Valhalla Rising. Unfortunately The Eagle isn't anywhere near as good as any of those films and falls a bit flat in the end.

Wend,"[6, 9]","I have not read Rosemary Sutcliff's book (The Eagle of the Ninth) but I understand that the book is more of a mystery whereas The Eagle is an action film.  Understandably, lovers of the book will be disappointed but, of course, translating a book to the screen is rarely satisfying.I found that The Eagle was better than I expected. The opening of the film, set in the reign of Antoninus Pius (around 140 CE), gives a gritty picture of Roman camp life.  Marcus Aquila has arrived in Britain to command the same cohort commanded by his father, who is responsible for the loss of an eagle standard.  The film wavers a bit in being precise about the organization of a cohort and a legion but this is not critical to enjoy the film.  The day-to-day life in camp is nicely depicted with the high point begin a battle with the Britons who have captured the members of a Roman patrol.  The discipline of the Romans is nicely portrayed as they form a testudo formation to rescue their comrades. The costumes are not bad but reflect more of the Hollywood version of ancient dress. The soldiers have the correct footwear but the armor is segmented leather.Spoilers below.Marcus is wounded and recovers at a villa owned by his uncle, nicely played by Donald Sutherland. During a gladiatorial combat, Marcus sees a salve named Esca who refuses to fight and saves his life, becoming his slave in turn. Marcus decides to bring back the Eagle to restore the good name of his father and sets of with Esca acting as an interpreter. They make their way into the Scottish highlands where they are captured by the Seal People, who paint themselves a gray-blue.  Esca turns the tables on Marcus by claiming the Roman is his slave.  The Seal People look more like American Indians by their clothing and wearing bones for decoration.End of spoilersChanning Tatum is well cast as Marcus. He is the very image of a Roman soldier, brooding over his family's loss of honor and conveying a strong sense of loyalty to his soldiers.  Jamie Bell also fills his part very well conveying Esca's reluctant but growing admiration of Marcus.  Mark Strong makes a brief appearance, this time not as a villain, as one of the Roman soldiers that survived the massacre of the cohort and went native.

The Eagle tells a different story - Marcus, invalided out of the Roman army with a leg wound, nips off beyond Hardian's Wall into the depths of primitive Scotland to find out what (apparently) happened to the ill-fated 9th Legion. Not the same at all.To be fair, although both are drawn from the same basic source material, the two stories are not the same - Marcus' journey as far more of a Roman buddy movie, although ""buddy"" is perhaps straining things a bit. Marcus (Channing Tatum) is accompanied by his slave Eska (Jamie Bell), and there is a subtext of honour, obligation, and trust running through the film as the two of them go into the wilds to try to recover the lost Eagle of the 9th, and find out what happened to Marcus' father..The Eagle is filmed on location in Scotland (which looks very Scottish) and Hungary (which often doesn't). Though it isn't as bleak as Centurion, it still looks pretty cold and wet and miserable much of the time. There's lots of action, much of it bloody, a couple of other well-known faces (Mark Strong, who isn't in it very much, and who sports an incongruous American accent, for instance), and vast numbers of Hungarians in supporting roles and as extras.

I thoroughly enjoy historical period pieces--especially those centered around the Roman Empire--so I pulled up a chair to watch THE EAGLE, the story about Rome's IX Legion disappearing in what is now Scotland, north of Hadrian's Wall in the Second Century.  It's also the story of Roman officer Marcus Flavius Aquila (Channing Tatum), whose father commanded the IX Legion, who ventures north of the wall to find the legion's emblem, a golden eagle, accompanied by his slave Esca (Jamie Bell), who happens to be a member of the native Brigantes tribe.  (And as such, despises Rome.)  To Marcus, retrieving the eagle will restore his family's honor, plus he may learn what became of his father, and of the legion.  Yet it's a dangerous journey, as the natives are extremely hostile, and suspicious of Esca's intentions.I enjoy authenticity, and this was a gritty, brutal time in which to live, and THE EAGLE takes no shortcuts.  The violence is graphic, the conditions primitive, the emotions raw.  Skilled actors Donald Sutherland and Mark Strong comprise the main portion of the secondary characters, and it's good they are in this film, as Channing just isn't solid enough to anchor an historical epic such as this.  He was definitely the weak link.  And at over 220 minutes the film is too long, and bogs down here and there as it moves towards its predictable (yet satisfying) ending.  Yet the vistas (you can't go wrong with Scotland), the action, the story, and the ever-growing friendship of Marcus and Esca, make THE EAGLE a grand historical tale not to be missed.--D.

In the context of this movie, it would've likely = 80 men.  It was led by a senior enlisted fellow who was known as a Centurion.  6 Centuries made up a Cohort, and 10 Cohorts comprised a Legion.  Why am I telling you all of this?  you ask.  Well, this terminology is used throughout the present film, so it's useful to know what they're talking about.The movie centers around a Roman officer who is medically dishcharged (Channing Tatum) but finds himself obsessed with figuring out a way to bring honor to himself and Rome.  His father fought with the IX Legion, which disappeared north of Hadrian's Wall a few decades earlier.  Along with the Legion, its guidon (the eagle) was never found.  Recovering the Eagle might be JUST the thing to salvage his brief military career!This is not a great movie, but it is an interesting one.  It does a good job of making you feel like you're back in England during the days of the Roman occupation > the Romans built the wall to keep the Caledonians out.  The final battle scene was a little incomplete, but for the most part this was a well done film.So, if you're Italian (or Scottish) and / or interested in Roman history, this is a worthwhile venture to undertake.  It does point out, correctly, just how sacred the Eagle was to the Roman Legionnaires.

Those first impressions were wildly off base. The Eagle is a serious and gritty mini-epic, a film that fully embraces themes of loyalty, friendship, and honor, set against the backdrop of sprawling vistas and historical authenticity. In previous films, Tatum displayed the charisma of aluminum foil and, while he's still a bit stiff, this is a good role for him--physical, jock-tough, brow-furrowed, and appears to be enjoying himself. However, as much as I love to champion under-the-radar sword-swinging actioners, I must stop short from a full-on chubby for this thing.

Nobody really knows what happened to them.But that hasn't stopped writers and moviemakers from speculating about what did happen. ""The Eagle"" is a solid adaptation of Rosemary Sutcliff's novel ""The Eagle of the Ninth"" -- a gritty, mud-slicked quest movie set in a time when Rome still ruled the world. Channing Tatum is a little wooden, but he's more than made up for by Jamie Bell's subtle performance.Centurion Marcus Flavius Aquila (Tatum) is the son of the Ninth Legion's commander, and is determined to regain his family honor. But after he's horribly wounded in battle, he finds himself honorably discharged and facing a life of boredom... until he hears rumors that the Ninth Legion's golden eagle has been seen north of Hadrian's Wall. If he can get the eagle, his family's honor will be restored.The problem is, no Roman has gone past the wall and lived to tell about it. So Aquila sets out to northern Britain, with his Briton slave Esca (Bell) as his only guide -- and quickly runs into deserters, rogue warriors, and the deadly blue-painted Seal People who helped destroy the Ninth Legion. Can they rely on each other long enough to find the golden eagle... and can they make it back to Roman land alive?Of the three movies made about the Lost Legion in the last few years, ""The Eagle"" is probably the grittiest and most realistic -- there are no glorious battles, Hollywoodized Celts or Arthuriana. Instead, director Kevin Macdonald fills the movie with mud, rain, cold pale light, grimy little outposts, frenetic small battles and the spare expanses of Scotland.And for the most part, the movie succeeds. It's a small, lean movie with a lot of underlying tension, and some hauntingly atmospheric scenes like the Seal People's firelit ceremonies, complete with a horned-god figure and lots of dancing/chanting. Also a nice touch: all the Britons speak Gaelic. It isn't entirely accurate, but is a nice change after countless movies where everybody speaks English. Even better, there are no subtitles, so we're as lost as Aquila whenever they speak.The one downside: the climactic battle is visually beautiful -- it's savage, bloody and wild. But the conveniently-timed arrival of Aquila's allies is just too ""Hollywood.""And Macdonald avoids identifying either the Romans or Britons as ""bad guys"" -- they both commit atrocities, but they both also have good honorable people as well. Esca and Aquila represent both their peoples in this story, so obviously the movie rests on the shoulders of Tatum and Bell. Tatum is rather wooden at first, but he gets more flexible and emotional as the movie goes on; and Bell gives a pitch-perfect performance as a proud young Briton with an iron-clad code of honor.Sure, there are a few other actors of note in here -- Donald Sutherland and Mark Strong have brief, well-acted roles, and Tahar Rahim does an excellent job as the blue-skinned Mohawked prince of the Seal People, but the star roles are really what this story depends on.As for this blu-ray edition, it will apparently contain the original PG-13 version, plus the unrated version. There is also going to be an alternate ending, deleted scenes, directorial commentary, a featurette about the making of the movie, smart phone interaction and something called UHear.""The Eagle"" is a movie that feels very richly authentic, and has just enough mud, blood, rain and heather to make it seem as if you've traveled back in time.",4,For honor and the eagle,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,3527,"['year', '100', 'Roman', 'Legio', 'IX', 'Hispana', 'supposedly', 'went', 'missing', 'somewhere', 'Britain', 'Nobody', 'really', 'what', 'happened', 'them.But', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'writers', 'moviemakers', 'speculating', 'what', 'did', 'happen', 'Eagle', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'Rosemary', 'Sutcliff', 'novel', 'Eagle', 'Ninth', 'gritty', 'mud-slicked', 'quest', 'movie', 'set', 'time', 'when', 'Rome', 'still', 'ruled', 'world', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'little', 'wooden', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'subtle', 'performance.Centurion', 'Marcus', 'Flavius', 'Aquila', 'Tatum', 'son', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'commander', 'determined', 'regain', 'family', 'honor', 'horribly', 'wounded', 'battle', 'honorably', 'discharged', 'facing', 'life', 'boredom', 'rumors', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'golden', 'eagle', 'been', 'seen', 'north', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'can', 'get', 'eagle', 'family', 'honor', 'will', 'be', 'restored.The', 'problem', 'Roman', 'gone', 'wall', 'lived', 'tell', 'So', 'Aquila', 'out', 'northern', 'Britain', 'Briton', 'slave', 'Esca', 'Bell', 'only', 'guide', 'quickly', 'runs', 'deserters', 'rogue', 'warriors', 'deadly', 'blue-painted', 'Seal', 'People', 'who', 'helped', 'destroy', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'Can', 'rely', 'other', 'long', 'enough', 'find', 'golden', 'eagle', 'can', 'make', 'back', 'Roman', 'land', 'alive', 'three', 'movies', 'made', 'Lost', 'Legion', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Eagle', 'probably', 'grittiest', 'most', 'realistic', 'are', 'glorious', 'battles', 'Hollywoodized', 'Celts', 'Arthuriana', 'Instead', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'movie', 'mud', 'rain', 'cold', 'pale', 'light', 'grimy', 'little', 'outposts', 'frenetic', 'small', 'battles', 'spare', 'expanses', 'Scotland.And', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'small', 'lean', 'movie', 'lot', 'underlying', 'tension', 'hauntingly', 'atmospheric', 'scenes', 'Seal', 'People', 'firelit', 'ceremonies', 'complete', 'horned-god', 'figure', 'lots', 'dancing/chanting', 'Also', 'nice', 'touch', 'Britons', 'speak', 'Gaelic', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'accurate', 'nice', 'change', 'countless', 'movies', 'where', 'everybody', 'English', 'Even', 'better', 'are', 'subtitles', ""'re"", 'as', 'lost', 'Aquila', 'whenever', 'speak.The', 'one', 'downside', 'climactic', 'battle', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'savage', 'bloody', 'wild', 'conveniently-timed', 'arrival', 'Aquila', 'allies', 'just', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'Macdonald', 'avoids', 'identifying', 'Romans', 'Britons', 'bad', 'guys', 'commit', 'atrocities', 'also', 'have', 'good', 'honorable', 'people', 'well', 'Esca', 'Aquila', 'represent', 'peoples', 'story', 'so', 'obviously', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'Tatum', 'Bell', 'Tatum', 'rather', 'wooden', 'first', 'more', 'flexible', 'emotional', 'movie', 'Bell', 'pitch-perfect', 'performance', 'proud', 'young', 'Briton', 'iron-clad', 'code', 'honor.Sure', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'actors', 'note', 'here', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'have', 'brief', 'well-acted', 'roles', 'Tahar', 'Rahim', 'excellent', 'job', 'blue-skinned', 'Mohawked', 'prince', 'Seal', 'People', 'star', 'roles', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'story', 'on.As', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'will', 'apparently', 'contain', 'original', 'PG-13', 'version', 'unrated', 'version', 'also', 'going', 'be', 'alternate', 'ending', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'directorial', 'commentary', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'smart', 'phone', 'interaction', 'something', 'called', 'UHear', 'Eagle', 'movie', 'very', 'richly', 'authentic', 'just', 'enough', 'mud', 'blood', 'rain', 'heather', 'make', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'traveled', 'back', 'time']",N/A
1323844,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0034G4P58,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 6]","THE EAGLE (a/k/a THE EAGLE OF THE NINTH, 2011) is a simple film to review, appreciate, critique - but the difficult part is exposing its faults. Here I find those faults to be thanks to the director.Marcus Flavius Aquila (Channing Tatum with a particularly silly, obvious name) is a tormented commander in the Roman Army in Britain. His father Flavius (Alad&aacute;r Lakl&oacute;th, seen only in GLADIATOR-type flashbacks), who commanded the 9th Legion in northern Britain, has been missing in action, along with the legion, for years. Presumed dead and disgraced for losing the golden Roman eagle standard, Flavius' only son Marcus is determined to somehow find and return the eagle.Here enters Celtic slave Esca of the Brigantii Tribe (Jamie Bell, a big hero of mine and last seen in 2008's DEFIANCE, vid. my review). Now a slave to Marcus' uncle (Donald Sutherland in a role far too small), Esca is given to Marcus and devotes himself after Marcus saves his life. This is Jamie's 13th film as it happens, and a somewhat lucky 13 it is for him. His portrayal is sensitive and intense. You can't help loving good old Jamie Bell - and I certainly do.The ""big gosh-darned quest"" begins - with Marcus determined to somehow find the eagle and return it to Rome. He decides he and Esca will cross Hadrian's Wall and find the thing. Esca, as a good Celt, has pledged his life to Marcus and what the film naturally will not show in any real way is that Esca has also determined to give his heart to Marcus as well - it was the Celtic way. This film is, in fact, about the love that blossoms between Esca and Marcus.Director Kevin Macdonald (THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND is his best-known film) did not spare any expenses here, except good direction. He's a lucky newbie and it shows in this film with its copying of GLADIATOR, TROY, and other similar beefcake historical silliness. The film which enjoyed some proper homage here is THE LAST LEGION (vid. my review). And they even filmed it on beautiful locations in Scotland and Hungary.While I appreciated and understood the cultural details and complexities which probably confused the average audience, the film is listless, languid and frankly a tad boring. If you're not a fan of the ancient Celts, Channing Tatum and/or Jamie Bell you'll find yourself being sent to sleep by this.For my money, this film is actually a (mostly) wholesome classic, good for (almost) the entire family. With its simple, noble storyline and the exciting time period setting, it doesn't really need the battles and grand-scale action. Seeing the Picts and hearing them speak their own cadenced dialect of Gaelic made it all the more worthwhile for me.As I said, if you're not a narrow fan, you'll go to sleep.Bell and Tatum, who had to shoulder the burden of this film, carry it well. They make a dazzling couple, but that's just me talking from a personal perspective. There is nothing too dangerous in the film: the swearing is kept to the actual word everyone used in ancient times (""pissing""); there is no rape or sex; the battles are far less blood-n-gore than I've seen in decades; even the plot does not require thinking and is evenly predictable.It is a film with a unique offering: it can be many things simultaneously and be all things for all people. For me it was a deep, moving love story. For others it will be another one-off like so many before. The roles whiz by, we barely catch some of the dialogue, and even the two major parts ring a tad hollow.

The Roman 9th legion is in the process of conquering Britain when they meet their match and are decimated by some of the Northern tribes. For all intents and purposes they disappear along with the Eagle of the title. Nine years have passed and the son of the legion's commander has come up in the ranks and wants to retrieve said Eagle and square his father's name.This movie is a shame. There is so much good here that ends up getting pulled down by some bad decisions. First is the casting. I like Channing Tatum well enough but he needs a few more projects under his belt to develop enough gravity to handle a role like this. And Donald Sutherland, as Tatum's uncle, was entirely miscast, as was Denis O'Hare as Lutorius. But then you have Jamie Bell as Esca and Tahar Rahim as the Seal Prince who ,among others, do a great job. Same with the directing. Much of the first act is almost hack level, but when Tatum and Bell head North on their mission things pick up in a big way. The landscape is used as well, if not better than any movie I've ever seen. It's near breathtaking. The sense of movement within the frame also gets better. It's almost an entirely different movie. And when they meet up with the Seal tribe it maintains a great level of authority. But then there is some clunky dialogue and the end is a bit too cool and it's frustrating to see.""King Arthur,"" and ""Centurion"" do a decent job of touching on Rome's time in Britain and, for my money, this does a better job in many respects.

1323854,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0034G4P58,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","THE EAGLE is based on quasi-historic events written by Rosemary Sutcliff in her novel 'The Eagle of the Ninth' and adapted for the screen by Jeremy Brock. In the hands of director Kevin Macdonald the re-enactment of the Roman wars in Britain become more a study of relationships and moral duty and that is probably the reason the film comes across as a rather quiet, contemplative piece rather than an epic. That is not a bad decision and were it not for the lack of a strong actor in the lead role, it likely would have been a theatrical success.The story begins in 140 AD in Rome where young Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum), the son of the soldier who allowed the Eagle symbol of Roman victory to be lost in a battle in Britain in 120 AD, becomes a centurion: he asks to be stationed in Britain where he promises his father's departed spirit that he will restore honor to his family by regaining the eagle. Though advised against such a futile mission (the Roman legion south of Hadrian's wall has been unsuccessful in conquering the Britons),  Marcus is determined.  He is more a devoted son and humanist: he prevents the killing of a young Briton, Esca (Jamie Bell), in the gladiator arena and to repay the debt of saving his life Esca agrees to be Marcus' slave despite the fact that he loathes Rome and Marcus for the damages Romans inflicted on his people.  The two men set out to Britain where Marcus assumes command of the tired and disenchanted Roman legion, but with the support of Lutorius (Denis O'Hare) and because of wise decisions about strategy his legionnaires grow to respect him.  Marcus' courage results in his being injured in a confrontation with the rogue warriors  and he is transported to a hospital with Esca at his side. At the hospital he is tended by his uncle Aquila (Donald Sutherland) who assures his return to health and informs him that Rome has honored his bravery in battle and has rewarded him with an honorable discharge.  But Marcus is determined to restore his father's good name and sets off to the north with Esca to gain the eagle.  On the way Marcus and Esca become close and Esca provides leadership abilities when the two confront the Seal People lead by the Seal Prince (Tahar Rahim).  In a turn of events the Seals capture Marcus and Esca and to save Marcus' life, Esca tells the Seals that Marcus is his slave - a reversal of roles that indicates the relationship between these two men.  Once the eagle is discovered and recovered Marcus and Esca flee, Marcus gives Esca his freedom but Esca stays with his new friend, encountering the last of the lost Ninth including Guern (Mark Strong) and  Marcus is reassured of his father's bravery and valor and the story speeds along to the expected end.The film is shot in Scotland and Hungary and the scenery is the star as captured by Anthony Dod Mantle.  The original musical score is by Atli &Ouml;rvarsson and adds considerably to the atmosphere of this rather dark film.  Jamie Bell is excellent as Esca, finessing the transition from hateful slave to respectful freed friend.  Channing Tatum is rather monotoned and monotonous as Marcus, a role that would have been better suited in the hands of a well-schooled actor rather than an Abercrombie & Fitch model.  But the director makes the most of Tatum's presence and the story is not impaired by his presence: it is just not enhanced by it.  THE EAGLE fares well on DVD with subtitles provided for the Gaelic conversations with the Seals.  It may not be a great movie, but it is fairly solid entertainment.

Mostly that meant not including standard movie cliches, and having an inspiring story, a complicated plot with no true good guys or bad guys, and good action. By cliches, I mean specifically that I really appreciated the lack of a gratuitous sex scene, and the lack of a scene where the good guy is almost beaten, kneels on the ground, the bad guy swings, and at the last second the good guy jerks up and kills the bad guy. The fighting in this movie is actually good.But I deducted two stars because of the historical problems. While there is an ancient Roman Republican tradition of Roman fighting prowess, and this movie suggests a great conflict between that republican martial tradition and the developing bureaucratic and soft elites under the empire, this movie doesn't do anything to portray the natives of the Island of Britain in an historically accurate way. The setting of the movie is in the 2nd century AD, but Gaelic-speaking Scots-Irish didn't arrive in Scotland from Ireland to establish the Dal Riata until the 5th century. In the 2nd century here were no Gaelic-speakers in what is now Scotland, and there never have been any in central Britain where supposedly ""Gaelic"" speaking Esca came from. His tribe, the Brigantes, spoke an ancient ancestor of the Welsh/Cornish/Breton languages, a completely different branch of the Celtic language family from Gaelic. The people north of Hadrian's Wall were the Picts, and we have no idea what type of language they spoke - The strongest hypothesis is that it wasn't Indo-European at all, just like Basque & Etruscan are/were not Indo-European.

The same physical mannerisms, facial gestures, head turning, dialogue and enunciation that he presents in all his movies.Battle scenes: The formation the soldiers used against the Brits would have been more effective against arrows or calvary not a mass of enemy that outnumbered them 10 to 1. Anybody who has been to an European soccer match would know that these few soldiers with shields in front of them while plodding a couple of hundred yards would have been crushed by the mass of rabid enemy fans.Battle scenes 2: Brits that, unfortunately, looked more like northeastern American natives with sword fighting skills as good as the Romans was out-of-control imagineering by the director.Storyline example: Too formula driven e.g. son defends family honor; treks across hundreds of miles to coincidentally come right to the location of a lost metal eagle; steals it back and despite being wounded rides hundreds of miles back mostly on horseback but for some not clear reason was not able to outdistance the on-foot Brits.

This occupation occurred from 43 to 407 AD.  There are many ruins related and attributed to the 9th Legion which was last based in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire prior to their alleged disappearance.This story was obtained from a novel of the same name which has some historical grounding.  As a Greco-Roman descendant I can understand the pride of Marcus Aquila in restoring the honor of his Roman family, but as the movie continues the viewer develops compassion for Esca, his family, and his heritage of the Celts and Picts of Northern England.The end of the story finds both Marcus and Esca uniting to obtain the mission of securing the Eagle, the standard of the lost 9th Legion.  The viewer feels for both cultures and their respective struggles in the ancient world.  Both fierce enemies become friends for an accomplishment which was thought impossible.

Rosemary Sutcliff is one of my favorite author's, if not my favorite, and I thought that, while this movie was not exactly like the book, it was still a good version of the story, and it didn't not do justice to Sutcliff's story. At least the characters were in character. I thought Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell made a very good Marcus and Esca, especially Jamie Bell. He has that thin chiseled look that it so very Celtic. And by the way, all you people who think there's any ""romantic"" interest between these two, don't you know what platonic brotherly love is? Does anyone anymore? Marcus and Esca had an amazing BROTHERLY relationship. The movie and book was about brotherhood despite the fact that Esca was British and Marcus Roman. Anyone who says differently is shallow and please stop saying it because you are ruining it for everyone else!There were a few things that I have to point out. One is that as much as I love the Gaelic language, they probably wouldn't have spoken it, besides the Pictish clans in the far North. And Esca, being a Brigantes, (which were from modern day Northumberland/Yorkshire area) would probably not have had cause to learn Gaelic. Their language was more like Welsh. But I'm not one to nit pick in movies like this, not when they have such lovely scenery. The wildness of Scotland, went so well with the costuming in this movie and the amazing score to create something that actually looked like it was from the wild, harsh yet beautiful days of Roman Britain.I do wish they had kept several elements of the book though, top of my list would be Marcus' love interest, Cottia. I don't mind that this was a brotherhood story without a lead female character, but it might have kept certain immiture people from thinking Marcus and Esca were gay. Also I totally loved their wolf pup, Cub, in the book. I also wish there had been more between them and Tribune Placidus (I actually wish one of them had gotten to slug him, but I guess that would have been a breech in rank ;)Besides the few flaws, this is still one of my favorite movies. I rarely buy movies, but this was one I felt I had to add to my collection. If you love Scotland like me, then buying this movie for the landscape alone is worth it.

(-:  (Yeah, I said it!)I wasn't disappointed, nor was I blown away.I enjoy an ancient roman or greek period epic just as much as the next guy,and this one had a pretty solid storyline; the usual roar & gore of the ancienthand-to-hand / face-to-face battleground, both Channing Tatum and Jaime Bell dida decent job in their respective roles....great supporting cast, etc.The story takes place during the time when the ancient romans were trying to dominateancient Britain, who they saw as barbarians. Twenty years before, Channing Tatum's character'sfather, all from a long line of proud, brave, and decorated roman solidiers, had literally disappearedwith his band of 5000 solidiers, as they attempted to conquer the northern part of Britain.The north is reputed to be a very ominous & mysterious place, inhabited by some of the mostsavage and fierce of the ancient british barbarian tribes. After such a crushing defeat,the Roman emperor, Hadrian, decides to erect a massive wall, which becomes known as ""the endof the known world"" to the ancient romans. Fast forward 20 yrs,  and it is now Channing's characterwho is revered as a mighty warrior for the Roman conquest of Britain. But there is one blemish onhis family name, and in his own memories of his father...that it's been said that his father and a fewof his soliders, after being so utterly overwhelmed by the barbarian hordes, turned tail and ran.Cowardice in the face of death, for a decorated general in the Roman army, be it real or percieved,is something that Channing Tatum's character just can't abide. In the back of his mind, regardless ofwhat victories he has on the battlefield, he feels he must somehow redeem his family name, and retrievethe standard of the golden eagle, that was the emblem which represented his father's ill-fated army.After a brutal campaign against the southern british barbarian hordes, he is severely wounded, and whilein recovery at his uncle's palace (played by veteran actor Donald Sutherland), he goes to a gladitorial display,where he witnesses a young slave, played admirably by Jaime Bell (of Billy Elliot fame), stand up boldlyin the face of what surely is impending doom in the arena, against a huge muscular gladiator.Impressed, and perhaps even touched by this young slave's moxie, he stands up for him and overrides thepopular vote that he should die at the gladiator's hand. For this, the slave becomes his slave.Not giving away anymore of the story, in case any of you haven't seen it yet, than I already have....This is the point where the story takes it's shape and purpose.But, long story short...there are places where the storytelling goes off the beaten path at bit,some places where it slows to a snails pace, mixed in with moments of brilliant sequences.Overall though, it's very uneven.I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, becuase that would be a lie.But this is not a GREAT MOVIE either...it could've been though.My advice is that this makes for a better rental than it does a purchase.  ***3 Stars***",3,"It's A Good Film, But Nothing Spectacular....",1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,3128,"['Well', 'being', 'Channing', 'Absolute', 'Hottie', 'Tatum', 'was', 'starring', 'film', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Yeah', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'blown', 'away.I', 'enjoy', 'ancient', 'roman', 'greek', 'period', 'epic', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'one', 'had', 'pretty', 'solid', 'storyline', 'usual', 'roar', 'gore', 'ancienthand-to-hand', '/', 'face-to-face', 'battleground', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Jaime', 'Bell', 'dida', 'decent', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', '.great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'etc.The', 'story', 'place', 'time', 'when', 'ancient', 'romans', 'were', 'trying', 'dominateancient', 'Britain', 'who', 'saw', 'barbarians', 'Twenty', 'years', 'Channing', 'Tatum', ""character'sfather"", 'long', 'line', 'proud', 'brave', 'decorated', 'roman', 'solidiers', 'had', 'literally', 'disappearedwith', 'band', '5000', 'solidiers', 'attempted', 'conquer', 'northern', 'part', 'Britain.The', 'north', 'reputed', 'be', 'very', 'ominous', 'mysterious', 'place', 'inhabited', 'mostsavage', 'fierce', 'ancient', 'british', 'barbarian', 'tribes', 'such', 'crushing', 'defeat', 'Roman', 'emperor', 'Hadrian', 'erect', 'massive', 'wall', 'known', 'endof', 'known', 'world', 'ancient', 'romans', 'Fast', 'forward', '20', 'yrs', 'now', 'Channing', 'characterwho', 'revered', 'mighty', 'warrior', 'Roman', 'conquest', 'Britain', 'one', 'blemish', 'family', 'name', 'own', 'memories', 'father', 'been', 'said', 'father', 'fewof', 'soliders', 'being', 'so', 'utterly', 'overwhelmed', 'barbarian', 'hordes', 'turned', 'tail', 'ran.Cowardice', 'face', 'death', 'decorated', 'general', 'Roman', 'army', 'be', 'real', 'percieved', 'something', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'character', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'abide', 'back', 'mind', 'regardless', 'victories', 'battlefield', 'must', 'somehow', 'redeem', 'family', 'name', 'retrievethe', 'standard', 'golden', 'eagle', 'was', 'emblem', 'represented', 'father', 'ill-fated', 'army.After', 'brutal', 'campaign', 'southern', 'british', 'barbarian', 'hordes', 'severely', 'wounded', 'whilein', 'recovery', 'uncle', 'palace', 'played', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'gladitorial', 'display', 'where', 'young', 'slave', 'played', 'admirably', 'Jaime', 'Bell', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'fame', 'stand', 'up', 'face', 'what', 'surely', 'impending', 'doom', 'arena', 'huge', 'muscular', 'gladiator.Impressed', 'perhaps', 'even', 'touched', 'young', 'slave', 'moxie', 'up', 'overrides', 'thepopular', 'vote', 'should', 'die', 'gladiator', 'hand', 'slave', 'slave.Not', 'giving', 'away', 'anymore', 'story', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'already', 'have', '.This', 'point', 'where', 'story', 'shape', 'purpose.But', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'storytelling', 'beaten', 'path', 'bit', 'places', 'where', 'snails', 'pace', 'mixed', 'moments', 'brilliant', 'sequences.Overall', 'very', 'uneven.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'movie', 'becuase', 'would', 'be', 'lie.But', 'not', 'GREAT', 'MOVIE', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'though.My', 'advice', 'better', 'rental', 'purchase', '***3', 'Stars***']",N/A

It does not follow the generic formula of such a film, it lacks a one-dimensional villain, the fate of the world does not hang in the balance, and there is no female love interest for the protagonist to rescue--in fact, there are barely any women at all in this film. ""The Eagle"" tells the story of Marcus Aquila (a woefully miscast Channing Tatum), a young Roman soldier who longs to venture north of Hadrian's Wall in order to retrieve the titular standard and redeem the honor of his father, whose legion was slaughtered in the region and whose defeat brought dishonor to Rome. While recuperating from a serious injury he suffered during an act of valor, Marcus rescues a young slave, Esca (a surprisingly intense Jamie Bell), from death during a gladiator battle. As they journey to the north in search of the eagle, the growing bond between Marcus and Esca betrays a small degree of homoeroticism, but any hint of that is quickly quashed when they are captured by ""savages"" who look suspiciously like American Indians. The film then degenerates into a series of set pieces that exemplify loyalty and honor, and the film ends with a dialogue exchange between Marcus and Esca that seems to be lifted directly from the script of any B-grade cop/buddy flick you can name. I can't quite imagine who the filmmakers thought this mess would appeal to, but regardless of the target audience, this film misses the mark by a wide margin.",2,A misguided mess,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1564,"['suppose', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Eagle', ""n't"", 'typical', 'sword-and-sandals', 'gladiator/ancient', 'warrior', 'epic', 'not', 'follow', 'generic', 'formula', 'such', 'film', 'one-dimensional', 'villain', 'fate', 'world', 'not', 'hang', 'balance', 'female', 'love', 'interest', 'protagonist', 'rescue', 'fact', 'are', 'barely', 'women', 'film', 'Eagle', 'story', 'Marcus', 'Aquila', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'young', 'Roman', 'soldier', 'who', 'venture', 'north', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'order', 'retrieve', 'titular', 'standard', 'redeem', 'honor', 'father', 'legion', 'was', 'slaughtered', 'region', 'defeat', 'brought', 'dishonor', 'Rome', 'recuperating', 'serious', 'injury', 'suffered', 'act', 'valor', 'Marcus', 'young', 'slave', 'Esca', 'surprisingly', 'intense', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'death', 'gladiator', 'battle', 'journey', 'north', 'search', 'eagle', 'growing', 'bond', 'Marcus', 'Esca', 'small', 'degree', 'homoeroticism', 'hint', 'quickly', 'quashed', 'when', 'are', 'captured', 'savages', 'who', 'look', 'suspiciously', 'American', 'Indians', 'film', 'then', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', 'exemplify', 'loyalty', 'honor', 'film', 'dialogue', 'exchange', 'Marcus', 'Esca', 'be', 'lifted', 'directly', 'script', 'B-grade', 'cop/buddy', 'flick', 'can', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'imagine', 'who', 'filmmakers', 'thought', 'mess', 'would', 'appeal', 'regardless', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'mark', 'wide', 'margin']",N/A

Cornwell ""Reviewer at Large""","[1, 2]","The scenes are gritty and shot to give the feel that these are real scenes, but the movie is predictable to a point.Dishonored father's son grows up to be a centurion like his father and command a northern garrison, a post he requested. On his first skirmish with the wild Britons, he is wounded seriously and honorably discharged with his leg damaged when a chariot he took down fell on him. He is a stubborn cuss and lives to tell the tale but lives in pain because his leg was not properly attended. A relative from his father's side of the family, another Aquilii, played by Donald Sutherland, takes him into his home and eventually find's a surgeon to fix Marcus Aquila's leg after Marcus saves a slave from a gladiatorial fight: slave versus gladiator.The slave owes Marcus his life, although why a slave would have been allowed to keep his father's dagger is never mentioned. Once Marcus's leg is healed and his strength returns, he is determined to go into the north beyond Hadrian's wall and bring back the Eagle of the 9th Cohort with his slave Esca, who convinces Marcus to let him do all the talking.There is the usual misunderstanding, Marcus and Esca change places as slave and master, and they travel north to where a clan of seal people on the edge of the world have the eagle. What follows is the usual rescue, fight, danger, and cavalry rescue (Romans not American blue boys). Pretty standard fare.There are few women and those that do appear are merely background. This is a man's movie about men's affairs and women would have just gotten in the way, despite the fact that many clans fought side by side with the women. Anyone ever hear of Boudicca? The seal people look particularly fierce, more like wood ash and woad painted Mohawk Indians than clans from northern Scotland, but they are effectively fierce and warlike. The acting is what one would expect of this kind of movie: adequate but uninspired. Extra points for dressing Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare) of True Blood excess in Roman soldier's garb and giving him some minor authority.Channing Tatum is laconic and iron-jawed and Jamie Bell is subdued and secretive, but with a strong underlying rage kept in tight control. The scenes are furious clashes of arms and the dream sequences appropriately cryptic and telling of Channing Tatum's need to unravel the mystery of his father's disappearance and his family's honor. He has a lot to prove and throws himself at every opportunity.The Eagle is nothing special, but it's not completely devoid of cinematic value. It is thrilling and exciting and full of men and costumes with very little needed or shown in the way of acting. After all, men have always had the anger and rage market cornered.

While the actual story of the 9th Legion is lost to us, this movie continues the assumption that it was lost in battle in Scotland. I'd been looking forward to seeing this for a year, though its tardiness in hitting the screens down here and the very limited release it received, suggested that it was going to be modest fair. While there were some good passages, this turned out to be the case.The opening scenes were the best, with the first battle being very exciting. They ultimately weren't what they could have been though, due to the scenes being disjointed and rushed. The chariot attack scene was simply just too short! I didn't mind the subsequent journey of the two main characters north to find the 9ths lost Eagle standard but I felt it was undone by the depiction of the Seal village. The Seal people looked impressive in the Trailer but I found myself underwhelmed here. I didn't mind that they seemed to borrow from American Indians for their `look', it was partly that the name `seals' just doesn't carry any gravitas. As well, they were probably just a bit too primitive looking and I didn't find the chief to be at all imposing. All up, they just didn't quite work for me. The two leads were fine but by the end they couldn't do much in a movie that had kinda lost its way.I'm conscious that the movie is based on a book that was written for young adults, so the director may well have made decisions to keep it suitable for that audience. The final confrontation seemed to confirm this for me. The low level of violence too also points to this. But to me, if Centurion had a bit much gore, this didn't have enough.This said, I enjoyed the film (and may well have loved it if I were still fifteen). It's totally ok that a film is made for teenagers but it really had the potential to impress on a higher level.

It tells the story of a young Roman officer (Channing Tatum) searching to recover the lost Roman Eagle that disappeared with his father's legion in the northern part of Great Britain. With his slave (Jamie Bell), the two set out in the highlands to recover the Golden Eagle. The story is very engaging, but possibly weighed down by the first 30 minutes, when we see him at his new post. Honestly, I didn't care about his new post, and I didn't care about his uncle, played by a dead looking, and acting, Donald Sutherland. It wasn't until you started to find out about his slave Esca's life, played wonderfully by the very talented Jamie Bell. Once they saddled their horses and journeyed beyond Hadrian's wall, the story picked up nicely, and I was engaged. However, one aspect that constantly made me cringe at times was Channing Tatum's performance as Marcus. Yes, he has proved himself to be a teen heartthrob in Dear John, and of course a badass in G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra, but for me it seemed as if he almost didn't fit well in this movie. And to tell you the truth, I cared more about Jamie Bell's character Esca than I did with Channing Tatum's character. And last but not least, The Seal warriors that chase Esca and Marcus at the end looked like the Na'vi from James Cameron's Avatar!

""The Eagle"" is not so much epic, as its an epic fail.The story takes place in the early 2nd century where 20 years ago a group of 5,000 Roman soldiers lead by the father of Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum) disappeared in the highlands Caledonia along with the golden eagle emblem that represented the group called The Ninth. After defending a fort and the soldiers he was assigned to lead, Marcus sets out into the highlands with his slave Esca (Jamie Bell) to retrieve the eagle and restore his father's name and of course to find out what happened to him and his group of soldiers.Of course if you've seen the trailers you know these two encounter an evil tribe known as the Seal People. The whole movie is pretty predictable along with lots of stale acting, lame dialogue and very boring fights. A lot of the bad acting comes from Channing Tatum, who was fitting in G.I. Joe, but doesn't have the chops for these types of movies. The dialogue is very bland I mean you don't ever feel like the actors really seem to care, though I admit Bell does at least a halfway decent job and Donald Sutherland is his usual self as Marcus' uncle.One thing I will say is the movie does have good cinematography, its well shot and looks good. There is a decent story here but it gets marred by the bad acting and lack of interesting characters.

However, the story begins as a Roman story--young leader takes over the dreaded outpost of Hadrian's Wall in order to assuage his father's honor and restore the Eagle emblem to the Roman Empire. Not long into the story, the emphasis shifts to young Marcus's recovery from injuries sustained in battle. Then there's a long ride by Marcus and his new slave Esca to find the Seal People, a sub-branch of the little-known Picts and recover that Eagle emblem.As I rode the rugged hills and mountains with the two, I thought that viewers looking for a thrilling Roman rout of Celtic peoples must be getting bored. However, I found this story--this quest--more riveting than battle and, of course, thought the landscape breathtaking (filmed in Scotland and Hungary) and anticipated that the journey would lead to new movie thrills. I was, of course, correct.The back story: Marcus's father was the leader of this post when Marcus was small. He and his 5000 men all disappeared, along with the Eagle emblem. It was considered dishonorable to lose the EAgle, even if no one knew what happened those years ago. Marcus grows up to take his father's place and rectify his honor. Early in his rule, he prevents his troops from being slaughtered during a surprise attack during the black of night by rousting them to duty in time for battle.Edited 8-30-13: How in the world did I fail to mention Channing Tatum? I've most of his movies since this one and simply find him enthralling.Much of the framework of the story is based on fact and is taken from Rosemary Sutcliff's young adult novel, ""The Eagle,"" one of three novels in her Roman Britain trilogy. I've always heard about the Picts, those painted-tattoed peoples on the edge of the Celtic nation. Not much is known about them, but Ms Sutcliff and the film lift up that curtain and show us a culture alien to even the Celts in general. History tells us that Hadrian built this 90-mile wall to prevent Celtic invasions into northern England which the Romans had added to their empire. The ferocity of Celtic fighting along this wall was daunting even to Roman soldiers.Enter Marcus and his slave, Esca, who was given to him, as a result of battle between gladiator and captive. Esca is a Breton, another branch of the Celts. In the film, all the Celts spoke the same language, so that Esca can communicate with each new group he and Marcus meet on their quest. As Celts hate Romans, slave and master turn about and Esca does all the talking.Finally, they arrive in the land of the Seal People, far north into modern Scottish territory along the North Sea. Marcus learns what it means to be a slave, but, more importantly, what it means to have a friend. There's also the revelation of some of the lost legionaries who adapted to the way of life of the Celts, the meaning of honor and courage and making things right.I really enjoyed this film because of the story and the setting. Both were exotic in a wild, enduring way. ""The Eagle"" is also the first movie I've ever seen which features the Gaelic language. That in itself was worth the admission.Edit 8-30-13: How in the world did I neglect to mention Channing Tatum?

The scenes of the seal people and the lost father who has joined them (and bears the missing father's ring) were not only visually captivating but very creative.  The bond between the two protagonists (ex-slave and retired legionnaire) shows the bonds between two people despite the disharmony of the empire vs its occupied subjects.  The beauty and mystery of wild Scotland blows the mind.Overall, I felt that Channing Tatum's performance was masterful in its subtle dignity--not overdramatic and not too ham-headed.  Jamie Bell was stellar as usual, and his lesser stature was jarring only physically.  The inequality of his people against the physical superiority of a bunch of Roman soldiers seems so overwhelming, but regardless of sides, the heroes of the film show far more than a physical strength.  The elderly return to fight out of brotherhood, the weak arise to die in the ring rather than fight a gladiator for the Roman audience's amusement, and a slight young companion becomes a formidable  secret ally in a few tight spots...loyal beyond common sense, quick-witted, and able to keep the deepest secret to protect his best friend's vision of his own father.The ending was a freeze-frame and completely dorky...but it was fun fun fun.

Surprisingly enough, while this was sort of an abridged version of Rosemary Sutcliff's 'The Eagle of the Ninth', basically covering only the highlights, it was both entertaining and captured just enough of the original story to make this something more than another brainless action flick. Even the action sequences were relevant to the plot and not tedious... in fact, its been a while since I enjoyed an action movie so much. Maybe because it wasn't really an action movie, when compared with other recent examples of the genre. Either way, there was not even a single boring minute.I also found I was not in the least disappointed by the Marcus/Esca friendship, and while again, it wasn't as intricate as in the book, there is a definite sense of their loyalty to each other throughout. The fangirls out there will be positively giddy with delight with that aspect. It really was that slashy (and then some) and while it was worth watching for that alone, there was just so much more to this movie. I loved the message of loyalty, honor and duty. Just themes that never come across nowadays, and it was refreshing to see they hadn't been abandoned entirely.While 'The Eagle' was blessedly free of CGI, don't let that fool you. From beginning to end every scene was visually stunning, and you'll find yourself getting so caught up in the story the lack of it will not be missed. In the least. I think that was even one of my favorite things about it.

We all really enjoyed the book--not just the story of Marcus and Esca (and Esca's tamed wolf) but the history of the Romans in Britain. My kids--now young adults--and I were really looking forward to seeing the movie.Other reviewers have gone into detail regarding the plot, and some have pointed out that this film did okay as far as incorporating historically accurate elements. Basically, Marcus and his slave Esca venture into the wilds of Britain--beyond Hadrian's Wall--to retrieve the eagle standard of the Ninth Legion, which was under his father's command. As long as the standard remains lost, so does the honor of the Ninth Legion and Marcus's family.As for the movie, I can't decide whether to give this a:Thumbs up/Life, life!--Except for skipping the part about the wolf (save for one shot of a caged wolf cub), the movie stayed faithful to the book. During the initial battle scenes, the lorica musculata was a flattering look for Channing Tatum and crew.  Donald Sutherland, while he didn't have a big role as Marcus's uncle, is always good. The scenes with the warrior Seal People were pretty tense, too.Or a:Thumbs down/Death, death!--It's too bad that the dramatic tension wasn't sustained throughout the rest of the film, which dragged in some parts. That was disappointing. The dialogue was a bit stilted and cliched, but again, that was in line with Sutcliff's writing. It came across better in the book.And why did Donald Sutherland serve eggs to his dignatary guests even though Marcus and Esca just killed a big boar? Wouldn't you think he'd prepare a rack of ribs?In any case, we all agreed that this movie was just okay, and no match for the book.But if you like movies about the Roman Legion--and come on, who doesn't?--you'll probably enjoy this.",3,An Eagle with its Wings Clipped,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1859,"['When', 'kids', 'were', 'young', 'read', 'Rosemary', 'Suttcliff', 'Eagle', 'Ninth', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'Marcus', 'Esca', 'Esca', 'tamed', 'wolf', 'history', 'Romans', 'Britain', 'kids', 'now', 'young', 'adults', 'were', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'gone', 'detail', 'regarding', 'plot', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'did', 'okay', 'as', 'far', 'incorporating', 'historically', 'accurate', 'elements', 'Basically', 'Marcus', 'slave', 'Esca', 'venture', 'wilds', 'Britain', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'retrieve', 'eagle', 'standard', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'was', 'father', 'command', 'As', 'long', 'standard', 'lost', 'so', 'honor', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'Marcus', 'family.As', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'give', 'Thumbs', 'up/Life', 'life', 'skipping', 'part', 'wolf', 'save', 'one', 'shot', 'caged', 'wolf', 'cub', 'movie', 'stayed', 'faithful', 'book', 'initial', 'battle', 'scenes', 'lorica', 'musculata', 'was', 'flattering', 'look', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'crew', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'role', 'Marcus', 'uncle', 'always', 'good', 'scenes', 'warrior', 'Seal', 'People', 'were', 'pretty', 'tense', 'Thumbs', 'down/Death', 'death', 'too', 'bad', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'was', ""n't"", 'sustained', 'rest', 'film', 'dragged', 'parts', 'was', 'disappointing', 'dialogue', 'was', 'bit', 'stilted', 'cliched', 'again', 'was', 'line', 'Sutcliff', 'writing', 'came', 'better', 'book.And', 'why', 'did', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'serve', 'eggs', 'dignatary', 'guests', 'even', 'Marcus', 'Esca', 'just', 'killed', 'big', 'boar', 'Would', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'prepare', 'rack', 'ribs', 'case', 'agreed', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'match', 'book.But', 'like', 'movies', 'Roman', 'Legion', 'come', 'who', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy']",N/A

1323906,A22PV91A5CNOGO,B0034G4P58,"NY film buff ""A reader from NY, NY""","[2, 3]","Having read Rosemary Sutcliff's novel, ""The Eagle of the Ninth,"" and seen the trailer for this film, I wasn't quite certain of what to expect. Sutcliffe's novel, first published in the 1950s, is a well-written adventure story about Marcus Flavius Aquila, a young Roman centurion on a quest to discover the truth about the fate of his father, a commander of the Ninth Legion, and the legion's eagle standard. The Ninth, which marched into the wilds of the Scottish highlands, vanished into thin air when Marcus was a child, an event still viewed by some as a blot on the Aquila family honor. Marcus is accompanied in his quest by his Briton slave Esca, who, in the novel, is also a close friend and comrade worthy of trust.The film takes a somewhat different tack, and simplifies the story, eliminating many details and characters, including the novel's only female element. As in the book, Marcus (Channing Tatum, who looks great in armor) has rescued the slave Esca (the excellent Jamie Bell) from a gladiatorial ring in Roman Britain. The film's Esca, not surprisingly, loathes all things Roman, and serves Marcus only as a repayment of his life debt, at first exhibiting none of the feelings of friendship and spiritual empathy displayed by the character in the novel. Master and slave set off into Caledonia, as the Romans called northern Scotland, in search of the Eagle and information regarding the fate of the Ninth Legion -- only to be captured by one of the native clans, the ""Seal People,"" who are led by a fierce, unpleasantly violence-prone mohawked prince played by Tahar Rahim. In the meantime, they have encountered a lone survivor of the Ninth, a Roman who has adopted the native lifestyle and a Briton name for self-preservation, and Marcus has heard the tragic story (movingly told by Bell) of how Esca came to be a slave. The conclusion of the film is entirely predicatable, and the final scene rather abrupt, but the battle scenes, throughout, are rivetting and well choreographed, and the sweeping vistas of the Scottish highlands provide a dramatic backdrop to Marcus and Esca's hazardous travels.The stripped-down nature of the storyline places responsibility for the film's success on the two young actors, Tatum and Bell. (Donald Sutherland makes a brief appearance as Marcus' genial uncle, but he has little impact on the film's overall atmosphere.) The buff Channing Tatum, with his hair dyed dark and his eyecatching Abercrombie-and-Fitch physique, is surprisingly effective as Marcus Aquila. One would imagine a Roman centurion to have the kind of abrupt, stoic delivery that Mr. Tatum starts off with (he becomes much more expressive, believable, and at ease with his role later on in the movie). In any event, he is quite likeable. Jamie Bell's intense, nicely nuanced Esca, who goes from tight-lipped, cold-eyed hostility to reluctant comradeship and eventual friendship, is sympathetic and appealing, and his lithe, offbeat good looks and slim physique make an interesting foil to his co-star's robust mainstream hunkiness. Those who still associate Mr. Bell with Billy Elliot will notice that he has added muscle and definition to his slender frame, and that his very impressive acting chops are as well-honed as ever.""The Eagle"" may not be a remarkable piece of cinema, but it contains some fine period detail and cinematography, striking scenery, and a nice, edgy bromance between the two protagonists. Interestingly, the Romans speak with a variety of American accents (a touch of social commentary, eh?), while the natives speak Scots Gaelic (less problematic, I suppose, than having them speak Pictish).

Anticipating seeing his characters Marco and Cato to the screen, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that the film was based not on the Scarrow novels but on Rosemary Sutcliff's 'Eagle of the Ninth', the first of a very good series of children's books written by her in in the 1950's. Sutcliff specialized in historical fiction for children and her 'Eagle of the Ninth' series is one the best children's historical series ever, the third in the series winning the Carnegie Medal. Sutcliff's books were a favorite of school librarians worldwide and is itself a worthy basis for a film on Roman Britain. Her books were popular with young adults as well as children and was filmed once before by the BBC.'The Eagle', directed by Kevin Macdonald, is an adaptation of Sutcliff's children's book with a plot line altered to appeal to modern audiences. Macdonald attempts to straddle the line between the original children's book and adult tastes for more action.The film gets a lot right. Roman Britain, circa mid 2nd century AD, is portrayed correctly, From the the uniformity of dress of the legions, the design of the Roman villa, and Roman battle tactics, the film's portrayal is authentic.  His portrayal of the Seal tribesmen is guesswork because not much is really known historically but his interpretation is good enough. Gaelic is spoken in the film however, a language probably not spoken by the Pictish people of northern Britain. The director also does not make the same mistake that so many filmmakers do in having Romans speak with British accents. All the Romans speak American English to differentiate them from the British, Gauls, and other cultures that were commonly part of Roman forces in the 2nd Century. It may be jarring at first, but the language choice makes sense.Unfortunately, the film gets a lot wrong as well. Maintaining viewer's interest in the the main characters is the key to this story and it fails because of the poor acting of of the lead characters. The film lacks drive. It is too pedestrian a production. The beauty of the setting is marred by lackluster direction and mediocre acting.

Suffice it to say, this is a fine old adventure story, derived from Rosemary Sutcliff's series of novels about ancient Rome. Yes, Channing Tatum at times is stiff and one hopes for  more subtlety, but Donald Sutherland does not fare much better, coming across more like Sergeant Oddball from ""Kelly's Heroes"".The scenes of the fog and rivers and rolling hills are quite beautiful. And the legionary outpost at the beginning of the film is well staged.The big reason I gave this film only three stars is because of the cinematography. When will directors finally stop pandering to the TV-reality series style of shaky camera work during battle scenes and other scenes? Hello!!! There's a bigger audience out there than just the plugged in brainless teenyboppers who go to the cinema for a visceral roller coaster ride.The human eye (and brain) needs more time to absorb, and appreciate, every image. To confuse the viewer with rapid cuts, missing frames, and light-speed pans is a very cheap way to produce ""excitement"". Unfortunately, nowadays this seems to be a case of the blind leading the blind in Hollywood.Furthermore, when the cinematographer's color palette becomes either monochromatic or purposely overexposed or purposely unfocused, where is the pleasure in appreciating composition, contrast and a reflection of nature's beauty?Gone are the directors who carefully planned these relationships and structured their composition.

1323913,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B0034G4P58,PJR,"[9, 10]","The previous 92 reviews raise many of the problems with this nevertheless excellent film, yet I hope that I can add something.When people nitpick a lot about films that have a lot going for them, it looks like the film is not working on some deeper level for them. One can nitpick about ANY film, but we generally let the small things go when there are bigger things that we appreciate. I do the same. I like sci-fi films and Westerns and love stories that are not completely realistic and so on if they work overall. I wish all the nitpicking reviewers of the Eagle had articulated what it was that made them dwell on the rough spots. But of course it is hard to ""know thyself"" and easier to nitpick.What kept me involved with the film? For one thing it was beautiful to look at. There was well photographed scenery and attractive and believable sets and well photographed interactions. The Seal People were necessarily made up images, but they were great images. Donald Sutherland was wooden at times, but he made up for this overall and as a distinctive character. Etc. Channing's acting seemed right and convincing for a serious young soldier who had a special motive for being in the thick of things. The ancient Romans are said to have been serious business like people and that is how he played the lead. If he has played it as young Hamlet it would have been inappropriate.Maybe I would have kept watching it with the sound off -- I am not completely serious, but I am trying to make a point that it was easy on the eyes.Perhaps what really  kept me involved was that  it it was pretty clear early in the film that it was going to be character and mood driven and would not depend simply on blood and sandals spectacle.  Young men driven by honor and loyalty to do crazy things is a fascinating topic in my mind. This  part was pulled off very well in my opinion. It kept me in suspense as a matter of ""human interest"" -- how far would this kid go to get back some stupid eagle? How far would his slave go out of loyalty to his master, despite his ambiguous feelings about him to begin with? Parts of their ""buddy adventure"" could be seen as tedious but for me they just kept up the tension of when will one or the other reach a breaking point?Obviously viewers who can not empathize with boys who go into insane war conditions out of a feeling of honor or pride in the flag and who have over the years seen many of them disillusioned would not relate to the film this way. And obviously people who do not empathize with people who go overboard out of loyalty to friends and then have seen the loyalty reach a breaking point also would not relate to the dramatic tension in the film the same way I did.Thus one thing I want to say here is that I really appreciated the alternative endings that were presented, because they were important parts of the whole story for me. I watched the non-rated blu ray version. The theatrical ending was really lame in my opinion, but it was probably the crowd pleaser. Mission accomplished, the eagle is brought back to the big shots and then the kid has earned the right to tell them off. Cliche #10,000.The alternative ending was also a cliche, but it was in my opinion more fitting with the rest of the film because it suggested that the boy warrior had learned something and matured from his contacts with ""the enemy."" Most superficially he had learned that the symbols were not that important and that the esteem of the rulers was not that important. What was important was people and their substance regardless of rank and honors.This gets us around to why I say it was good enough to be controversial. The film is sell enough done to get you involved with the characters and wonder SHOULD they just keep going with honor and loyalty. Is being patriotic to Rome really worth all this? How sane is honer taken to this level, which is not entirely unrealistic for some guys. There is something admirable, and I am not putting it down. But it is debatable and worth discussing.Yes then as former slave and master go off into the sunset all but holding hands this might look sort of corny, but it does tie things together. They had both grown into real people instead of puppets of their cultures.Some have called their relationship homoerotic. Well, maybe. Who knows? Who cares? What would that have to do with anything? It was a buddy film, and buddies can come to love each other in buddy ways as brothers or whatever. There was intimate male bonding and that would be natural after all they had been through. Is that really corny or even unusual when you think about it? Male intimacy is still awkward for many guys in our culture, and there are some women who see male coalitions as threats. So that part of the alternative ending may have been objectionable to some because of ""deep"" psychological reasons, and it might be tempting to ""dismiss"" it as homoerotic (whatever that means). But painting labels like that is a distraction from the simple fact that the two had been though a heck of a lot and obviously had developed the trust and mutual respect to consider making a life together as partners. So this was the consistent ending in terms of the tension all along that had been working itself out in their relationship.In addition to the alternative ending -- that I would say is a must watch -- the deleted scenes were substantial and worthwhile. The ""making of"" was better than most but not tops. I confess that I got tired of the director's commentary and stopped watching. But then I was coming down with a bug.",5,Good enough to be controversial,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,5573,"['previous', '92', 'reviews', 'raise', 'many', 'problems', 'nevertheless', 'excellent',

This ridiculous piece of trash goes more or less like this: the son of the commander of a legion that disappeared in the north of England has a fixation to retrieve the eagle that was the symbol of the legion. He wanders off to the north alone with a slave whose life he has saved ,wanders around a bit before bumping just in the tribe who got the eagle after the battle that destroyed the legion. The representation of the Picts if one of the most devastatingly hilarious horrors in this movie: they look like a cross between a disco version of the mohican and a pandora native from avatar...:) Anyhow he  steals the eagle, tries to run back on horseback but for some mysterious reason is not able to outrun the poor pits who are following them *running*.

1323923,A2733E5FQFAUKR,B0034G4P58,Rick  Henry,"[15, 18]","Well, we've had tons of people slamming the film -- many whom I doubt could themselves act their way out of a paper bag -- and I am always amazed at those who have never done the work, nor been in the business (not even their backyard little theater), who render such wondrous opinions of who can act and who can't.We've also had input on the historical accuracy involved; and a run through of the whole plot.  So what's left?I went because I always look forward to ancient ""historical"" films, whether wonderful or not.  Many are terrible; the latter ones have definitely come up since the 50's.  (Among one of the worst ever, was Richard Burton's ""Alexander the Great."")  And while I would love to have seen more/better results from this film... I was very well pleased with what I saw.  Even if I could not for the life of me understand why Donald Sutherland would choose to have an estate in such a god-forsaken place, as much as if his were the only residence in that part of Britain.  How did he survive from being bored to death?  To leave the comforts of most Roman cities for a backwater?  And then, yes, the business of the Seal People reminded me definitely of ""American"" Indians, more than northern British savages.  It was also obvious the producers were on a tight budget, and spent their money judicuously.  But I was still pretty happy with the results.Here, I saw Channing Tatum as one of the most perfectly cast Romans possible.  He had the look, the bearing, the character, and the attractiveness.  I've never seen him act before, but I was impressed enough to call this role for him: star-making.  (Wooden?  Go back to bed, people.  You wouldn't know a post from a stone.)  Granted, to enhance his standing, if Tatum could take off a year and enroll in the Actor's Studio, he might definitely be a true force in the making.  (From interviews, I understand he's never had any lessons.) Jamie Bell is also a pleasure to see, as well.  Something odd and intense and deep about him, both hard and sensitive  (The kid who made ""Billy Elliot"" magical.)Further, while the characters of Channing and Jamie were supposed to be in strong cross-conflict with each other...maybe this failed on both their parts.  No matter what they did, or what the script called for, or how they read their lines -- you just could not dismiss ""sensing"" the love these two guys had for each other, whether expressed or not, it was just there somehow.  And I was really pulling for their friendship to be shown, which it was eventually, but had to be somewhat repressed for the film.  (All this confirmed in later interviews, that they got along famously in person.)  So great!  Yeah, an undercurrent of homoeroticism -- so what?  It made the film alive, for me.  And probably saved it from being just a very dreary-some adventure in barren north Scotland.The only other thing I missed was maybe somehow a greater emphasis on the symbol of the eagle.  It was there, but for me, not quite strong enough.  And too, I never could quite get over ""how"" the Seal People could buy the story of Marcus being Esca's slave.  Marcus was just too much of a standout, physically, etc.  It just didn't ring through.  However... the film itself had me groaning for more -- .

The protagonist in this story, Marcus, is the son of a Roman officer who lost an entire Legion of 5,000 soldiers when it forayed north into this uncharted territory.  Worse for Roman military honor, the Legion's Standard (its ""Eagle"") was lost as well.  His family name had been tainted by the loss, and he of course seeks to reclaim the Eagle, find out what happened to the lost Legion, thereby restoring his family honor.  Towards this end he asks to be posted at the northernmost Roman garrison in Britain, which is considered to be a backwater posting that no one would want.No spoilers here, but basically Marcus journeys north of Hadrian's wall in search of the Standard, accompanied by his British-born slave.  More would be telling.The most impressive aspect of this movie is its moody cinematography.  One truly gets the atmosphere of a British landscape (Scotland, actually) pristine and almost untouched by man, and completely untouched by civilization.  Never have I seen a film that conveyed this impression more powerfully.The story here is straightforward, and not especially complicated.  Nor is the acting anything terribly impressive.  The story moves along at a brisk pace and holds the viewer's interest, but the real power of this film is the cinematography, not the storyline or acting.

1323933,AP3V63JVKLEO5,B0034G4P58,Sherman A. Thompson,"[1, 2]","I accidentally stumbled onto this flick just at its beginning on a TV movie channel without knowing the title. I could tell from the costumes and settings it was likely about the Romans in Britain. I've studied the Celts and Romans in depth, once had a pretty good artifact collection of museum quality items from Roman-occupied Britain, and wrote a 285 page historic novel about the Boudican rebellion. I've also visited the Roman baths at Bath, small Roman amphitheaters in England and Wales, the Roman fort at Housesteads, and many places along Hadrian's Wall. I've been a consultant for several published books on the Picts, Romans, and Celts, and I know British Roman history pretty well. The DVD starts with an insufferable set of uninvited previews of Universal films that seem to drone on and on. The old Universal producers would not have abused their paid audiences this badly.That said, I was impressed with much of this film's depiction of a typical Roman frontier fort and the area near Hadrian's Wall in Britain. The buildings, their construction, the costumes, and many other things depicted in the film were spot on. Even the circular Celtic thatched houses were very close to those of the Butser experimental ancient farm near Chalton in Britain. The dwellings further north resembled those excavated at Skara Brae, Orkney, in north Britain, giving the viewer a rough idea of what life there might have been like. For me, the scenery and settings were what made this movie worth watching. The weak screenwriting, poor story development, and several hard-to-accept events were the main reasons I gave it only three generous stars as a movie. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the acting bad. To me, sacrifice of the young boy for clann betrayal was acceptible and not a problem, knowing ancient Celtic culture. The ""Master of Animals"" costume of the shaman, similar to that on the Gundestrap Cauldron, was also a nice touch.It would have been so easy to make the entirely blue painted and ludicrous ""Seal People"" tattooed or woad-painted Picts instead of having them look like American Mohawk indians. Sheer unbelievable idiocy. And these folk on foot could outdistance horses in the long chase south? Not bloody likely. Then there was the matter of surviving hypothermia in a bitter cold Scottish river? Again, not very believable. I could stretch a point and accept the miraculous and too-quick appearance of remnants of the lost IX'th Legion, but only barely, for the sake of a difficult plot resolution. The film trailer stated that the IX'th Hispana legion composed of 5,000 men disappeared north of the wall, never to be seen again. This is incorrect. The IX'th legion reappeared later in Israel.Also, Celts never put rotating blades on the hubs of their chariot wheels, regardless of the sculpture artist's misconception of how the unfortunate British bronze statue of Boudica should look. Putting blades on Celtic chariots was pure fantasy and the consultants should have said emphatically,""No!"" But at least the chariots were there. We know from excavated burials that the real ones were very lightweight and fast, carrying a warrior and his highly skilled driver. Celts often fought in the nude, and this was almost alluded to in the brief fight with the rogue warriors. Another good depiction of reality that probably escaped most viewers. That said, there was the error of wearing their crossbow fibulas upside down. I've had and conserved about a dozen at one time or another and still have one in good wearable condition. These fibulae were always worn with the crossbar at the bottom and the latch catch at the top where the wearer can see to latch it. Someone should have spotted this error.Despite its many weaknesses there were also many good aspects. I ordered a DVD copy because of the great visuals in the film that depicted life in a Roman frontier fort and how it might have been north of the wall in the Britain of 2,000 years ago. Just producing the film was a courageous gamble that could have resulted in an epic if only it had been better crafted and had a slightly more believable story. It suffered from badly informed consultants on the ancient Britains, Celts, and the people of the far north. The DVD extras included an alternate ending, which I won't spoil for you. It also included several cut scenes. One was an excellent depiction of a Celtic chariot race.Not exactly bad, but it could have been much better with very little effort. ... nonetheless, still better than most,  and worth watching, if only for the well filmed visuals.",3,not bad but could have been much better,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,4588,"['accidentally', 'stumbled', 'flick', 'just', 'beginning', 'TV', 'movie', 'channel',

The sound and picture are fine, but not what I would rate as anything special for color - as there is hardly any except one or two sequences. The DTS is adequate and was more about the small surrounds (dogs barking during the search, the cave sequence echoes) but the special features are what make this somewhat cheesy theatrical release a recommendation:* Unrated cut, same run time. They left the sounds and sights of people being killed in this version (blood, a beheading, the sounds of throats being cut [removed in theatrical], etc. Cannot tell if they were removing the blood in the theatrical or adding it into the unrated, but either way it looks believable here.* Alternate ending, 4:21 minutes. WAY better version and should have been used instead of that cheesy ending that ruined the main film. Some spoilers: they do not go back to Rome and they actually had written the dialogue correctly as to where their legion was from. Worth the watch.* Making of, 12:12 minutes. A semi-narrated clip laden documentary that adequately covers most stages of production, informative and well made.* Deleted scenes, 2 @ 6:20 minutes. Should have been left in as they added some nice character. A chariot race scene that would have made much more sense to the initial battle as to why he spears that driver; also the pig hunt sequence where you could tell they had cut out a long conversation by the river in the theatrical.* Commentary, full length.

It had just about all I could want, therefore, although the script could have been a bit tighter and the acting better. Based on the novel The Eagle of the Ninth by Rosemary Sutcliff, the story takes place in 140 AD.  Channing Tatum plays a young Roman centurian, whose father commanded the Ninth Legion, which had 5,000 men almost all killed by the Celts--at least in the film. First, Tatum is commander of a fort, which has to repel an attack; then, he and a Celtic slave (played by Jamie Bell) head north of Hadrian's Wall to retrieve the Ninth's eagle standard, held by the blue-painted Seal People.Somehow, a handful of Roman deserters are there to help Tatum and Bell fend off a Seal People attack. Their existence seems very unlikely, but apparently, according to historical accounts, some of the Ninth's men did survive and served in later campaigns (although they were not hiding in the woods for two decades, as they were in the film).

The filmmakers don't have to linger on the atrocities that rationalize the oppressed Esca's contempt for Marcus, a representation of the arrogance of empire, because the torment is in Bell's face: how his character struggles to separate the Roman who saves him from death and the Romans who took his people's land and murdered his family. Who did what to who matters less in the end than what we promise to each other that we will become.Roles are reversed or dissolved,Esca must play the master to Marcus's slave in order for the men to ensure their survival,also boundaries between Pict and Roman,victim and victimizer, even language.The overall theme is the need and struggle for brotherhood.Macdonald's collaging of visual planes is expressionistic, the ensuing battles between the Romans and warrior Picts are shot with a phantasmagoric intensity that foregrounds the confusion, noise, and brutality of battle, and the overall effect is closer to the existential poetry of Terrence Malick's The New World.

Channing Tatum is the centurion who asks for a post at the very edge of the empire on the Scottish border in hopes of covering his family name with so much honor and glory it'll drown out the shame that has attached itself to it since his father led the Ninth Legion to an unknown fate north of what would become Hadrian's Wall. Despite getting off to a good start by winning over his men and saving his fortress from attack not once but twice, his career is over almost as soon as its begun when he is invalided out of the legion. Recuperating at his uncle Donald Sutherland's villa where he saves the life of a British slave (Jamie Bell), he sees a chance to challenge fate and redeem the family's honor when rumors start that the Eagle standard of the Ninth Legion have been seen beyond the wall...Andrew MacDonald's film is very much a classic old-fashioned adventure film seen through modern eyes but managing to avoid many of the clich&eacute;s of the genre, old and new. It reverses the classic casting approach by almost entirely using American actors instead of British ones for the Romans (with the exception of Mark Strong's Dennis Hopper-like legionary gone native), a conceit which works surprisingly well. Aside from a misjudged shot of a ranting druid and a brief fight with some rogue warriors it avoids the excesses of shakeycam and overediting for a smoother visual approach to the action scenes, the desaturated photography managing to turn the Hungarian and Scottish locations into something that looks almost like a lost world while just managing to avoid the tiresome orange and teal visual clich&eacute;s of most modern action films. There's even a nicely imaginative use of sound in the climax when the sounds of the final battle are reduced not to the usual silence and soaring orchestral chords but those of the two central combatants in a sequence where the audio briefly becomes more impressive than the visuals. Much of the big action is at the front of the picture, slightly unbalancing it for those hoping for the kind of big action movie it seems to start out as, the scale shrinking as the focus narrows and the landscape conversely expands, but it never feels like its dragging its heels or padding things out.The film initially manages to give a good sense of how the ancient Roman world worked without letting the details get in the way of the story before plunging into the dark savage world beyond the wall, where hard country breeds harsh tribes with more in common with Native Americans than the usual righteous oppressed locals fighting the empire for their freedom. Indeed, when the hero and his slave go on the run pursued by the relentless Mohican-like Seal People, you could easily be watching a Western. Yet even here the film manages to avoid falling into easy good guy-bad guy stereotyping, with Tahir Rahim excellent as their relentless nemesis, managing to create a believable and human character despite having little to work with. Nor does the film opt for an easy hero/villain position on Rome itself, choosing to stake its colors on heroism and courage on either side. Those expecting an epic or a relentless action movie may be disappointed, but as a large-scale old-fashioned adventure, all in all it's rather terrific.The US Blu-ray offers a decent 2.40:1 widescreen transfer of both the theatrical and unrated cuts, director's commentary on the unrated cut, a perhaps slightly better alternate ending that gives the Eagle itself more value than the one finally used, a couple of deleted scenes (one explaining why Douglas Henshall gets prominent billing for just a couple of shots as a charioteer who Tatum kills: the rest of his part never made the final cut) an d a making of featurette. Universal's European Blu-ray only includes the unrated version but does include a more substantial 48-minute making of documentary that didn't make the US release.",4,"""The Eagle is not a piece of metal.

1323949,A2J9COKR9JAZUQ,B0034G4P58,"Trey David Wood ""The Sleeper Must Awaken""","[0, 1]","I love ancient history, and I'm always excited to read about a new historical movie that deals with some ancient event, especially if it is in an epic style.  With the Eagle, my excitement was tempered with some reservation, however, because of the main character being played by Channing Tatum, who I had only seen in the Step Up movies (my wife made me watch them) and in G.I. Joe (which was disappointing).  Tatum's character in Step Up was so repulsive to me that I could not imagine him playing a dignified Roman in this movie, yet within the first ten minutes of The Eagle he had layed my fears to rest by being not only convincing, but somewhat likeable.The setting puts me in mind of another good recent movie about the Roman occupation of Britain, called Centurion.  They are stylistically different movies, but I don't think that its stretching it to view them as companion pieces.  The Eagle is gritty and filmed with thick saturation and sweeping cinematography. The battles are exciting and coherent, with only a minimum of the shaky-camera effect that plagues so many movies.I'm not certain that this movie is based on a historical event, per se, but the costumes and cultures seem to be mostly accurate in their presentation. Surprisingly, there is no love story in this movie.  That is not a bad thing.  The plot leaves no room for an impromptu romance, and allows the movie to focus squarely on the main character's quest to regain his father's honor.If you're a fan of Gladiator or Braveheart, or even Troy and Alexander, this movie will not disappoint you.  If you want a 300-style comic book extravaganza, this is not for you.In summary, it is very good historical movie that is worth your time.",4,(Insert latin phrase which indicates approval),1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,1715,"['love', 'ancient', 'history', ""'m"", 'always', 'excited', 'read', 'new', 'historical', 'movie', 'deals', 'ancient', 'event', 'especially', 'epic', 'style', 'Eagle', 'excitement', 'was', 'tempered', 'reservation', 'however', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'played', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'Step', 'Up', 'movies', 'wife', 'made', 'watch', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Tatum', 'character', 'Step', 'Up', 'was', 'so', 'repulsive', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'playing', 'dignified', 'Roman', 'movie', 'yet', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Eagle', 'had', 'layed', 'fears', 'rest', 'being', 'not', 'only', 'convincing', 'somewhat', 'likeable.The', 'setting', 'mind', 'good', 'recent', 'movie', 'Roman', 'occupation', 'Britain', 'called', 'Centurion', 'are', 'stylistically', 'different', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'stretching', 'view', 'companion', 'pieces', 'Eagle', 'gritty', 'filmed', 'thick', 'saturation', 'sweeping', 'cinematography', 'battles', 'are', 'exciting', 'coherent', 'only', 'minimum', 'shaky-camera', 'effect', 'so', 'many', 'movies.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'movie', 'based', 'historical', 'event', 'se', 'costumes', 'cultures', 'seem', 'be', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'presentation', 'Surprisingly', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'plot', 'room', 'impromptu', 'romance', 'movie', 'focus', 'squarely', 'main', 'character', 'quest', 'regain', 'father', 'honor.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'even', 'Troy', 'Alexander', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'want', '300-style', 'comic', 'book', 'extravaganza', 'not', 'you.In', 'summary', 'very', 'good', 'historical', 'movie', 'time']",N/A

I really enjoyed this clever, witty, interesting film all-told and enjoyed the story and idea behind it too.Although it's ostensibly a story about Rome in Britain, I think it's also basically about a friendship between people from completely different walks of life and perspectives; it could be a kind of buddy movie too. The story centres on a Roman Legion 'the 9th' having completely disappeared in Scotland, that wild and barbarous place, twenty years before the story begins. The son of the commander of the legion wants to find out what happened to his father and his men basically. So, the two men, one a Roman and the other a British slave go into Scotland to find some answers.They meet, and fight with, the Picts, but eventually are befriended by a Pictish tribe, although they eventually fall foul of these too. I won't go on anymore about the plot but will say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it was well put together and executed and gave me a feel of that long past time.One point to note; the actor who plays the Pictish king's son is Tahar Rahim, who was the lead role in the film 'A Prophet'.Summing up, I recommend this film because it weaves an interesting and original story which could be watched by anyone and enjoyed by the whole family, but is exciting enough to thrill you too.",5,Enjoyable historical movie!,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,1449,"['bought', 'film', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'not', 'having', 'heard', 'so', 'watching', 'had', 'anticipations', 'expectations', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'clever', 'witty', 'interesting', 'film', 'all-told', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'idea', 'ostensibly', 'story', 'Rome', 'Britain', 'think', 'also', 'basically', 'friendship', 'people', 'completely', 'different', 'walks', 'life', 'perspectives', 'could', 'be', 'kind', 'buddy', 'movie', 'too', 'story', 'Roman', 'Legion', '9th', 'having', 'completely', 'disappeared', 'Scotland', 'wild', 'barbarous', 'place', 'twenty', 'years', 'story', 'son', 'commander', 'legion', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'father', 'men', 'basically', 'So', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'Roman', 'other', 'British', 'slave', 'go', 'Scotland', 'find', 'answers.They', 'meet', 'fight', 'Picts', 'eventually', 'are', 'befriended', 'Pictish', 'tribe', 'eventually', 'fall', 'foul', 'too', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'anymore', 'plot', 'will', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'executed', 'gave', 'feel', 'long', 'past', 'time.One', 'point', 'note', 'actor', 'who', 'Pictish', 'king', 'son', 'Tahar', 'Rahim', 'who', 'was', 'lead', 'role', 'film', ""Prophet'.Summing"", 'up', 'recommend', 'film', 'interesting', 'original', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'watched', 'anyone', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'family', 'exciting', 'enough', 'thrill', 'too']",N/A

To do so, Marcus enters deep into the forbidden territories with a British slave Esca (Jamie Bell), whose life he saved.Based on a Rosemary Sutcliff book ""The Eagle of the Ninth"" published in 1954, ""The Eagle"" is a story of war as well as friendship. The action sequences with brutal close combat fighting are expertly handled without relying on computer graphics, and the story of Marcus and Esca is fairly credible. Director Kevin Macdonald (""Last King of Scotland""), however, fails to infuse life into other characters including Guern played by Mark Strong, a talented actor again wasted because of underwritten character.One good thing about the film is that there is no romantic subplot, a mistake that many historical adventure films have committed. ""The Eagle"" (shot in Scotland and Hungary) also benefits from the photography of Anthony Dod Mantle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") that captures the beauty and harshness of the nature.Yes, photography is very good, and so is the storyline, but they are still not good enough to completely overwhelm the ""been there done that"" feeling we occasionally have, and Macdonald's rather uninspired direction in describing the hero's attempt to recover the family's honor.",3,Decent If Not Outstanding Film about Adventure and Friendship,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,1578,"['Inspired', 'Roman', 'Ninth', 'Legion', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'year', '120', 'AD', 'served', 'loose', 'basis', 'Neil', 'Marshall-directed', 'Centurion', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Eagle', 'story', 'young', 'Roman', 'soldier', 'Marcus', 'Flavius', 'Aquila', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'who', 'restore', 'family', 'dignity', 'recovering', 'lost', 'golden', 'eagle', 'standard', 'do', 'so', 'Marcus', 'deep', 'forbidden', 'territories', 'British', 'slave', 'Esca', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'life', 'saved.Based', 'Rosemary', 'Sutcliff', 'book', 'Eagle', 'Ninth', 'published', '1954', 'Eagle', 'story', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'friendship', 'action', 'sequences', 'brutal', 'close', 'combat', 'fighting', 'are', 'expertly', 'handled', 'relying', 'computer', 'graphics', 'story', 'Marcus', 'Esca', 'fairly', 'credible', 'Director', 'Kevin', 'Macdonald', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'however', 'infuse', 'life', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'Guern', 'played', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'talented', 'actor', 'again', 'wasted', 'underwritten', 'character.One', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'mistake', 'many', 'historical', 'adventure', 'films', 'have', 'committed', 'Eagle', 'shot', 'Scotland', 'Hungary', 'also', 'benefits', 'photography', 'Anthony', 'Dod', 'Mantle', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'beauty', 'harshness', 'nature.Yes', 'photography', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'storyline', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'completely', 'overwhelm', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'feeling', 'occasionally', 'have', 'Macdonald', 'rather', 'uninspired', 'direction', 'describing', 'hero', 'attempt', 'recover', 'family', 'honor']",N/A
