1352107,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,B003L77GH4,AC,"[0, 0]","I hadn't seen a single episode of this show until last week, and had no idea what it was that might separate this show from any of the others in the genre.After noting the extremely high percentage of 5-star ratings, out of nearly 400 reviews for Season 1, and the remarkably high percentage out of the nearly 300 reviews for Season 2, and reading the specifics conveyed by others in their reviews, I had to see for myself what so many had found so compelling about this show.I initially thought this show was simply a combination of 'vampire' + 'high school', but that's SO NOT IT.  Of the various reviews I read, what became pivotal for me were those which were from people who did not consider themselves fans of the genre, and those which commented regarding the show having exceptional writing -- and I happen to now be among the chorus of those singing the praises of this show, and belong to both of those 'camps'.Although I saw the Twilight movies, I wasn't all that impressed by them -- the stories or the acting.  When I checked out True Blood (again, to see what all the fuss was about :) ), I enjoyed Season 1, wasn't such a fan of Season 2, and really liked Season 3.  However, this show strikes me as being relatively peerless -- it's simply that good, and I don't know what even comes close.  I continue to marvel at the exceptional storylines, which are not only paired with phenomenal writing, involving truly remarkable creativity, and skilled pacing, but fantastic acting.I'm blown away by this show, and am utterly delighted to have found a show whose incredible storylines downright fascinate me, and keep me spellbound, from episode, to episode.  In working my way through the Season 1 set, I initially didn't understand what the fuss was all about -- however, after certain initial specifics were fleshed out (no pun intended), it became apparent that this was no ordinary show, and I soon found myself in that delightful state of anticipation, after each episode concluded -- I had to watch the next one, right away... :)And that 'snowballing' of anticipation and practically being mesmerized by the show was even more true of Season 2 -- holy crap, WHAT A SEASON!  It's like they laid the groundwork in Season 1 for a stunning 'lift off', in Season 2 -- the creativity and stunningly wonderful writing are 'off the charts' in this season.I can't recommend this show highly enough.  I happen to be a sci-fi fan, and enjoy when it crosses into what is deemed to be within the fantasy realm, and find ventures into the supernatural to be fertile ground for great stories, but am not 'hardcore' regarding any genre -- my preference, above all, is for great stories -- and this show delivers it in abundance.For anyone who might be 'on the fence', and among those who, like me (until last week, that is) hadn't seen an episode of this show, I hope you decide to give it a try, as there is so much to enjoy about this wonderful series.Great stories, great writing, and great execution (again, no pun intended [lol]) -- it's got it all!",5,"Had to see for myself why others raved, and am stunned by how good this show is",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,3054,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'show', 'last', 'week', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'might', 'separate', 'show', 'others', 'genre.After', 'noting', 'extremely', 'high', 'percentage', '5-star', 'ratings', 'nearly', '400', 'reviews', 'Season', '1', 'remarkably', 'high', 'percentage', 'nearly', '300', 'reviews', 'Season', '2', 'reading', 'specifics', 'conveyed', 'others', 'reviews', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'had', 'found', 'so', 'compelling', 'show.I', 'initially', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'simply', 'combination', ""'vampire"", '+', 'school', 'SO', 'NOT', 'IT', 'various', 'reviews', 'read', 'what', 'became', 'pivotal', 'were', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'consider', 'fans', 'genre', 'commented', 'regarding', 'show', 'having', 'exceptional', 'writing', 'happen', 'now', 'be', 'chorus', 'singing', 'praises', 'show', 'belong', 'saw', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'stories', 'acting', 'When', 'checked', 'out', 'True', 'Blood', 'again', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'Season', '1', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'fan', 'Season', '2', 'really', 'liked', 'Season', '3', 'However', 'show', 'being', 'relatively', 'peerless', 'simply', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'even', 'close', 'continue', 'marvel', 'exceptional', 'storylines', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'paired', 'phenomenal', 'writing', 'involving', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'creativity', 'skilled', 'pacing', 'fantastic', 'acting.I', ""'m"", 'blown', 'away', 'show', 'am', 'utterly', 'delighted', 'have', 'found', 'show', 'incredible', 'storylines', 'downright', 'fascinate', 'keep', 'spellbound', 'episode', 'episode', 'working', 'way', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'initially', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'however', 'certain', 'initial', 'specifics', 'were', 'fleshed', 'out', 'pun', 'intended', 'became', 'apparent', 'was', 'ordinary', 'show', 'soon', 'found', 'delightful', 'state', 'anticipation', 'episode', 'concluded', 'had', 'watch', 'next', 'one', 'right', 'away', ""'snowballing"", 'anticipation', 'practically', 'being', 'mesmerized', 'show', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'true', 'Season', '2', 'holy', 'crap', 'WHAT', 'SEASON', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'Season', '1', 'stunning', ""'lift"", 'Season', '2', 'creativity', 'stunningly', 'wonderful', 'writing', 'are', 'charts', 'season.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'show', 'highly', 'enough', 'happen', 'be', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'when', 'what', 'deemed', 'be', 'fantasy', 'realm', 'find', 'ventures', 'supernatural', 'be', 'fertile', 'ground', 'great', 'stories', 'am', 'not', 'regarding', 'genre', 'preference', 'great', 'stories', 'show', 'abundance.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'be', ""'on"", 'fence', 'who', 'last', 'week', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episode', 'show', 'hope', 'decide', 'give', 'try', 'so', 'much', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'series.Great', 'stories', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'execution', 'again', 'pun', 'intended', '[', 'lol', ']', 'got']",N/A

1352131,AB34G6VKP28L,B003L77GH4,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 2]","Though book fans may not care for the direction in which this show is headed, most of us tuned in for each new episode knowing we were in for quite an experience. Becoming stronger and more mature in its second season, The Vampire Diaries is not for the faint of heart... and we wouldn't want it to be.Katherine has returned. The charming, beautiful vampire who first turned Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) in the aftermath of the Civil War has arrived in Mystic Falls, much to the horror of her doppelganger and Stefan's current girlfriend, Elena (Nina Dobrev). And she's out to have some, well, fun. The intensely jealous vampire has no interest in allowing the lovers peace and threatens to harm Elena's brother Jeremy (??) and her aunt Jenny (??) if they don't break up. But her actions toward the unhappy duo are just a smokescreen - she has something much more exciting planned that involves an ancient curse and a precious moonstone. Unfortunately for all of them, Caroline (Candice Accola) is caught up in the mix. Near death after a car accident, she is visited by Katherine and given a dose of vampire blood and a broken neck. She awakens with a hunger for blood and uncertainty as to where this new twist of fate will lead her. Bonnie (Katerina Graham) is struggling with her powers as a witch, and holds a growing hatred for vampires that may unleash a tide of violence.But Caroline is not the only one questioning her existence... as it seems the werewolf gene in the Lockwood family has been activated. Mason intends on ending Damon (if Damon doesn't end him first) but his nephew Tyler is about to experience the real traumas of the family curse. And that doesn't even cover the new vampires in town, the arrival of the warlocks, or the re-emergence of an ancient evil even Katherine is terrified of...Creating quite a stir due to its daring and sometimes scandalous ad campaigns, those unfamiliar with the material would be surprised to learn that this series is tamer than the previews might suggest. It has a solid cast that is ever expanding, continuity in its ongoing arcs, and never fails to stretch out in new and exciting directions. Fans of the love triangle in particular will like certain scenes and implications this season, as we find out how Damon truly feels about Elena. The first half is a lot of fun with the return of Katharine and the transformation of Caroline into a vampire, the next batch of episodes deals with the werewolf problems, and finally the season ends by returning to the beginning and the implications of both curses. In terms of storytelling it's solid and week to week breaks out surprises, which is one of the reasons it is so popular. It is a smart show and that is not often found in programming aimed at young adults.It goes without saying that this series is edgy and controversial.

1352133,A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE,B003L77GH4,cinephiliagal,"[0, 0]","I've watched every vampire TV series of note (and many that were forgettable) in the last 40 years, and VD is not the best, but it is also definitely not the worst. Coming after shows like BTVS and Angel, Vampire Diaries (and True Blood) have a lot to live up to in terms of great writing and strong characters (especially female characters), and they often fall short. (This is just my opinion; do keep in mind, I'm not a tween, teen, or twenties kid who hasn't seen anything else besides Twilight, True Blood or VD; I have much higher expectations than the average viewer, I guess.)It's funny, I started out watching the premiere episode of season 1 and the first few season 1 VD eps relating to Elena as a kind of shell-shocked survivor of family tragedy... but then VD became so unrealistically melodramatic, I couldn't relate.  But since Season 2 began, although there were some episodes that kind of stumbled, most have been really interesting, and these last few have been really good. This one -- The Last Day -- is probably up there in the top five.Maybe it's because I'm older now, I don't go for the vampire-trying-to-be-good/human types as much as I did when I was younger... I find the vampire characters who just accept their vampire nature and run with it more intriguing. I guess because I've already been through so much crap in life, I realize now that things are not black and white, that there are many paths to the same destination, and that many shades of gray and levels of moral ambiguity are involved in doing both good and evil. And I also realize that sometimes you just have to seize the moment while you can. Perhaps that's why I find Damon a much more interesting character than Stefan, and, frankly, he is a major reason I tuned in week after week this second season.The show really became interesting to me when Damon's unrequited love for Elena began to surface, and when Katarina returned to wreak havoc in the brothers' lives. It was hard to get into the first season: Damon, revelling in being bad, was much more the reason I tuned in than Stefan &/or Elena.But this season, Caroline's turning and then her strange love triangle(ish) situation and her relationship with Tyler kept me tuning in, as did Bonnie's development of her powers... again, these story arcs kept my attention this season much more than the Stefan/Elena story arc (heresy, I know!). And of course Katarina's meddling and messing with everyone/everything, and her manipulation, only to have her come-uppance as Klaus compelled her, have been *rich* to watch.But now that Elena's life is closer and closer to the threat of death, Damon's unrequited love is affecting his judgment and his behavior in increasingly wild, desperate, and unpredictable ways. The poignancy of his hopeless feelings for her, and the fact that it ""will always be Stefan"" for her, and the fact that that hasn't stopped him, has been fairly gripping over the last couple of episodes, and The Last Day was no exception.And, finally, it is fairly tear-jerking when you realize how little time Stefan and Elena have had together, and how much Elena has already lost in her life -- in terms of deaths of loved ones, of family -- as she gets closer and closer to Klaus' ritual.I guess I can once again relate to Elena, as she seems about to (once again) lose so much, including her own life, as well as the lives of those around her. I guess having been through the deaths of several loved ones over the last few years, I relate far less to her happy kissy-face times with Stefan and relate far more to her doomy gloomy times like now... Which is my own crap, of which I'm totally aware and fully admit.But then, as Matt Groening (creator of Life In Hell long before he created The Simpsons and Futurama) once said, Happiness is boring... to which I'd add, happiness is also not very dramatically challenging; it doesn't drive plot or character development the way tragedy and danger do, that's for sure.And before everyone jumps down my throat, yeah, yeah, I get that Stefan and Elena are supposed to be the main focus of the show -- but then again, they're not; it's an ensemble cast; and I'm glad that the other characters and actors really got to develop and shine this season. Plus having to play Katarina/Katherine in addition to the sometimes almost annoyingly-nice Elena has shown more than anything that Nina Dobrev really can act; watching her go from playing innocent, trusting, let's-make-a-deal Elena to playing the scheming, selfish, manipulative Katherine has been a rather delightful surprise throughout this season. And just when the polar opposite behavior of those two characters was getting predictable, they had Katherine pretend to be Elena, so Nina Dobrev had to play Kathareine playing Elena -- and the disdain Katherine had for Elena's nature (right after convincingly pretending to *be* her) was both hilarious and also quite compelling. It was quite fascinating to watch Nina navigate those parts so well.Yet, still, my heart goes out most to Damon, because it will never be him for Elena... but he's willing to risk her undying hatred in order to save her ""by any means necessary."" That's pretty big love, in my book; a pretty damn big sacrifice -- far more, imo, than Stefan has made or will make. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for the bad guy with the good heart.",4,"who loves her more, the brother who does what she says, or the one who'll risk her eternal hatred for saving her?",1304640000,"05 6,

I watched the first episode of the first season and had to watch the second, and so on.  I watched the first season in two nights and ordered the second season.  It was made for young adults and it's fascinating to see what these kids get up to.  As an adult you wonder vaguely how these kids can get away with all the stuff they manage to do...parties every weekend, parents aware of their kids drinking and doing drugs and doing nothing to stop it.  Short on parental supervision and long on self gratification. Under all that there are the mysteries involved behind the scenes of all the parties. You see that the parents are aware of the Vampires,and the witches and the werewolves. They are so involved in killing and keep the ""evil"" that they let it slip in unaware that they don't know everything.  Vampires that are good, and Vampires that are evil, and Vampires you think are evil and turn out not to be evil.  Vampires that can go out in the sun, but only because of talismans made by witches that have magic attached to them.It's a fun romp through the supernatural. You have your whiny tortured vampire (this appears to be a per-requisite for this type of story, i.e. the whiny Vampire gets the girl) that is trying so hard to be good. Your evil vampire that isn't really evil but who is tortured because he loves the girl his brother has. Then you have the Girl.  The one they both love. (Oh why must they choose the whiny tortured vampire.) The two vampires are brothers.  This series has a bit of everything for everybody...Vampires, Witches and Werewolves.  Doppelgangers appears to be the main theme for season two as the ""girl"" is playing two parts.  One of a Vampire (self involved, all about me vampire), and the other the teenage girl that the brother vampires are in love with.  All this sounds very Soap Opera-ish, but this series manages to stay just clear of that.It's fun, suspenseful, intense and takes the supernatural just beyond it's boundaries.

It also bugs me that the characters frequently act out of plot driven stupidity (""I can't believe that this character, who has screwed us over 47 times in the last five weeks, would do something bad to us THIS time."").On the up side, the writers frequently make fun of the standard vampire goes back to high school tropes and the characters get to make snarky comments about the fact that this tiny little town seems to have some kind of festival, or major event every other week.Also, hasn't anybody notice the unusually high death rate in this tiny town?On the other hand, I like the fact that the leaders of the town are not entirely dim and have some idea of what is going on.The show is worth watching, if you don't try and take it seriously.",4,Cheesy Fun,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,1904,"['Vampire', 'Diaries', 'show', 'use', 'standard', 'urban', 'fantasy/', 'paranormal', 'romance', 'cliches', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'ashamed', 'of.The', 'story', 'same', 'old', 'thing', 'beautiful', 'high', 'school', 'coed', 'mysterious', 'stranger/high', 'school', 'boy', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'vampire', 'who', 'thankfully', 'not', 'sparkle', 'sneak', 'room', 'watch', 'sleep', 'anything', 'creepy', '.She', 'spitting', 'image', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'so', 'must', 'know', 'good', 'guy', 'looking', 'help', 'provide', 'stability', 'life', 'death', 'parents', 'car', 'crash.You', 'get', 'idea.The', 'main', 'character', 'Elena', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'beautiful', 'friends', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'sort', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'actresses', 'something', 'hang', 'out', 'pretty', 'boys', 'get', 'supernatural', 'trouble.One', 'problems', 'have', 'program', 'however', 'show', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'Virginia', 'least', 'two', 'characters', 'grew', 'up', 'there', 'Civil', 'War', 'virtually', 'one', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'south', 'also', 'bugs', 'characters', 'frequently', 'act', 'plot', 'driven', 'stupidity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'character', 'who', 'screwed', '47', 'times', 'last', 'five', 'weeks', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'bad', 'THIS', 'time', 'up', 'side', 'writers', 'frequently', 'make', 'fun', 'standard', 'vampire', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'tropes', 'characters', 'get', 'make', 'snarky', 'comments', 'fact', 'tiny', 'little', 'town', 'have', 'kind', 'festival', 'major', 'event', 'other', 'week.Also', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'notice', 'unusually', 'high', 'death', 'rate', 'tiny', 'town', 'other', 'hand', 'like', 'fact', 'leaders', 'town', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'dim', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'take', 'seriously']",N/A

I thought it was yet another mass-consumer product for all those rabid Tween-Twilight fans (and their mom's)...Until I actually sat down and watched it.VD, (funny acronyms aside) I am happy to admit, was everything that Twilight dribble was not: it treated teens seriously, (as Buffy the Vampire Slayer did) realistically and was not afraid to explore controversial subjects. This show does not depict teens as vapid, angsty and shallow, (although some of the characters do start that way). It takes the vampire genre, (Dracula, Anne Rice, True Blood) and the teen TV show genre (90210, Dawson's Creek, Party of Five) and gives it a fresh and supernatural spin. Its refreshing to see a show where the characters have real-life motivations, actually portraying the glories and perils of adolescence. It does not shy away from topics such as drug use, unprotected sex, racism and promiscuity. It blends adolescent and adult characters with great care and realism. It is nice to actually watch a show that makes me want to come back for more, that actually cares about the subject and the viewer. Major characters struggle, suffer and actually die; this is not a soap opera. Bravo for Vampire Diaries! Cannot wait for season 3.

I read the books way back when (and for the record, they were awful- but *very* engaging and still WAY better then 'Twilight'), and I was excited about the show. I didn't care that Elena went from blond to brunette and had a brother instead of a sister, and the Salvatores were from Virginia instead of Italy, I was just psyched to see the triangle up on screen. Season 1 got off to a shaky start, but did not disappoint.Season 2, on the other hand, is not only ""not disappointing"", but has some really great episodes. One of the running themes is the evolution of Caroline's character and her friendship with Stefan, which mirrors his relationship with Lexi.In the opener, Caroline, is turned into a vampire and gains a small measure of revenge on Damon for his mistreatment of her when he first comes into town (#1 ""The Return""). It's amazing to watch Caroline grow a spine along with her fangs and I found myself rooting for her alongside the two brothers and Elena. Another one of my faves is #6 ""Plan B"", in which Jeremy struggles to become part of Mystic Falls' new world order and Damon and Katherine reveal just how ruthless they are. There's also the introduction of Rose (#8 ""Rose"") who gets Damon to show his softer side. Katherine's back story is featured (#9 ""Katerina"") which gave Nina Dobrev a chance to really shine- I think she got her People's Choice award for her work in Season 2, actually. There's also the first of many wonderful episodes showing how Lexi influenced the brothers and the relationship between Elena and Original Elijah (#15 ""The Dinner Party""). The finale (#22 ""As I Lay Dying"") which is a neat little full-circle move showing that what happened to Jeremy in the first episode (and the Season 1 finale) had consequences,If you're a fan of the show, and like rewatching for nuance and characterization, this is worth owning.",5,"As guilty pleasures go, this one's pretty epic.",1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,1890,"['Okay', 'admit', ""'m"", 'fan', 'read', 'books', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'record', 'were', 'awful-', '*very*', 'engaging', 'still', 'WAY', 'better', 'then', ""'Twilight"", 'was', 'excited', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Elena', 'went', 'blond', 'brunette', 'had', 'brother', 'instead', 'sister', 'Salvatores', 'were', 'Virginia', 'instead', 'Italy', 'was', 'just', 'psyched', 'see', 'triangle', 'up', 'screen', 'Season', '1', 'got', 'off', 'shaky', 'start', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.Season', '2', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'disappointing', 'really', 'great', 'episodes', 'One', 'running', 'themes', 'evolution', 'Caroline', 'character', 'friendship', 'Stefan', 'relationship', 'Lexi.In', 'opener', 'Caroline', 'turned', 'vampire', 'gains', 'small', 'measure', 'revenge', 'Damon', 'mistreatment', 'when', 'first', 'town', '1', 'Return', 'amazing', 'watch', 'Caroline', 'grow', 'spine', 'fangs', 'found', 'rooting', 'alongside', 'two', 'brothers', 'Elena', 'one', 'faves', '6', 'Plan', 'B', 'Jeremy', 'become', 'part', 'Mystic', 'Falls', 'new', 'world', 'order', 'Damon', 'Katherine', 'reveal', 'just', 'how', 'ruthless', 'are', 'also', 'introduction', 'Rose', '8', 'Rose', 'who', 'Damon', 'show', 'softer', 'side', 'Katherine', 'back', 'story', 'featured', '9', 'Katerina', 'gave', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'chance', 'really', 'shine-', 'think', 'got', 'People', 'Choice', 'award', 'work', 'Season', '2', 'actually', 'also', 'first', 'many', 'wonderful', 'episodes', 'showing', 'how', 'Lexi', 'influenced', 'brothers', 'relationship', 'Elena', 'Original', 'Elijah', '15', 'Dinner', 'Party', 'finale', '22', 'Lay', 'Dying', 'neat', 'little', 'full-circle', 'move', 'showing', 'what', 'happened', 'Jeremy', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', '1', 'finale', 'had', 'consequences', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'rewatching', 'nuance', 'characterization', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A

I am quite convinced that the writers have a plot wheel on their desk and when looking for a plot point, they spin that wheel. That's the only reason I could think of for some of the stupidity that crops up during this show:Highlights include:1. Elijah not killing Klaus because Klaus mentioned about his family. Sorry but how long has Elijah been alive? As soon as he failed to stake his brother, I could see the betrayal coming a mile off. That seems crap to me as why would Elijah believe his brother? Why wasn't he anticipating this staking? Surely he should have said, 'fine they're alive and I'll find them myself' before staking Klaus. My friends and I howled in annoyance at this.2. Tyler not helping Caroline when she was kidnapped by Jules. I mean, he barely knows Jules and co, but he has known Caroline for years and she stood by him during his first werewolf transformation, yet he lets her be tortured and barely raises an eyebrow. I mean if given a choice between an old friend and some new people that you don't know, you would logically side with your old friend. Made absolutely no sense.3. Why does Klaus want Stefan to go all blood addicted? I mean if Klaus has got a secret crush on Stefan, fine, but really it makes no sense. Klaus can certainly do enough damage by himself, why does he need Stefan?4. Turning Jenna into a vamp, I mean it was shocking and all, but really was it necessary? It seemed overly complicated and used purely to angst Elena and Jeremy some more.5. The sudden 'sacrifice for another spell' that supposedly redeems John. Sorry but that was an ass pull.6. And Elena's desire to save Bonnie, especially when they find out just what else the ritual needs. Erm excuse me, you don't want to sacrifice your friend, but you're quite willing to kill yourself and two others. Bravo for you Elena. We would have preferred Elena sacrificing herself after exhausting every other possibility, not ignoring everything else in order to sacrifice herself. (shades of Bella Swan anyone?)These are the few I can think of atm, but when I watch this show with friends, we do enjoy it but every episode, something utterly random and ill thought out happens.

Everyone is getting used to the secrets and some accidentally fall into &#34;the know.&#34; Enter the Originals. Now it is getting real interesting. Stefan and Damon fight to keep Elena alive and out of their reach.First I was super excited to see the Originals. I actually watched that show first. I knew it was a spin off and now I can see where they were pulled from. Klaus and Elijah are great vampires.I adore Damon. He is back with his little snarky quips and terrible foot-in-mouth disease, while Caroline and Matt are still trying to figure it out. Tyler is sifting through some family history that could be life changing. Bonnie is getting more powerful every day but she struggles to keep her friendships with vampires and their allies.My favorite characters. These all have shows, in my humble opinion, good development. They are all learning and growing. Each adapting to their circumstances in a great way. I look forward to what will happen next.",4,Stefan and Elena take on the Originals,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,1078,"['Quick', 'Overview', 'Stefan', 'Damon', 'Elena', 'finally', 'deal', 'Catherine', 'spark', 'Matt', 'Caroline', 'examined', 'Everyone', 'getting', 'used', 'secrets', 'accidentally', 'fall', '34', 'know.', '34', 'Enter', 'Originals', 'Now', 'getting', 'real', 'interesting', 'Stefan', 'Damon', 'fight', 'keep', 'Elena', 'alive', 'reach.First', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'see', 'Originals', 'actually', 'watched', 'show', 'first', 'knew', 'was', 'spin', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'were', 'pulled', 'Klaus', 'Elijah', 'are', 'great', 'vampires.I', 'adore', 'Damon', 'back', 'little', 'snarky', 'quips', 'terrible', 'foot-in-mouth', 'disease', 'Caroline', 'Matt', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'Tyler', 'sifting', 'family', 'history', 'could', 'be', 'life', 'changing', 'Bonnie', 'getting', 'more', 'powerful', 'day', 'keep', 'friendships', 'vampires', 'allies.My', 'favorite', 'characters', 'have', 'shows', 'humble', 'opinion', 'good', 'development', 'are', 'learning', 'growing', 'adapting', 'circumstances', 'great', 'way', 'look', 'forward', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next']",N/A

Now Thursdays are my night to get my Vamp addiction on.  The writing is great with all the plot lines and twists that you expect; but sometimes you get a surprise you didn't see coming.  What I like the best is Ian Somerhalder, Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley dynamic and the terrific acting they give every episode.  The Twilight series annoys me in that their characters are not believeable....and when Bella and Edward are in a scene together there is no chemistry....sad but true.  When Elena and Stephan or Elena and Daemon are together the sparks are flying....I believe the characters because the acting is great and the supporting cast is wonderful as well ....and they are sexy and hot which gives all something to look forward to each week.  Love the show and I am not in the 18-24 demographic either.
