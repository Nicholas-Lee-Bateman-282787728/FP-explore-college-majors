1608374,A209QRVZ99UQDC,B00AF4ORUK,Calamity Jane,"[1, 2]","Sharon Stone portrays a stellar female reporter, the proverbial toast of the newsroom. Within a few minutes of this film, she makes minced meat out of an sneaky female politician, thus giving the viewer the sense that Stone is going to play a brilliant and savvy journalist and human being.  Unfortunately that it falls apart when her brother goes missing in Mexico. The police won't help, don't care, so Stone decides to get the job done herself.Having no idea where to start looking, Stone engages the help of a co-worker. They drive to a random section of the southern border where they encounter a border fence and armed guards. Low-and-behold, Stone sees her brother`s blood-tinged hat dangling from the top of the fence. Lawdy, it's a miracle! Ignoring the guards and their automatic weapons, Stone rushes towards the fence and begins climbing. Despite the hail of bullets unleashed on her and her coworker, Stone retrieves the hat, scurries back down the fence and runs across the sand, ultimately dodging all the bullets. The duo hide behind a small wooden shed that has no earthly purpose for being there other than to shield the stars. Seconds later, after the gunfire has stopped, Stone and her friend shrug and decide it's safe to leave. They walk away from the shed and stroll unmolested back to the car. It's utterly ridiculous.It goes downhill from there.The producers should have allowed Stone to play a character her own age. Instead, they plastered her with bright red lip stick, decked her out in a hairdo fit for a high school prom queen, hoping we wouldn't notice a 55-year-old actress who naturally wrinkles and ages like the rest of us. It's grossly distracting, as is Stone's constant shock and bewilderment every time she encounters more drug cartels, human smugglers and violence along the way. I don't even know if she eventually found her brother. I don't care. I stopped watching and found something better to do.

1608375,A2W5F8CRQWDW4,B00AF4ORUK,"Jim Clark ""Jim Clark""","[3, 5]","By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiSharon Stone, probably best known for crossing her legs in Basic Instinct, brings some real acting and emotion into Border Run, which by most standards would be considered B-grade.To its benefit the story is strong enough to raise it up a notch or two.Sofie Talbert (Stone) is a Phoenix television reporter with right-wing tendencies. In real life, Sharon is more liberal. She is even an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church, so she had to do some acting. She&#8217;s working on a story about people crossing the border. &#8220;Thousands try to cross into the U.S. illegally every year,&#8221; Sofie says. &#8220;Each person carries a story, this is one of them and I didn&#8217;t know at the time but this story is also mine.&#8221;She gets deeper into the story, by accident, when she calls her brother (Billy Zane) to tell him about her big break. She hears gunshots over the phone.So she begins a search for her missing brother. Eventually she finds herself as cargo in a hidden compartment under an 18-wheeler with other hopeful mexicans. Sofie is befriended by a wolf (one who smuggles illegals). One can imagine the conditions - trapped in a compartment, with hot asphalt below, no water and no food. One man dies, so the lead smuggler, a very violent female, discovers Sofie. At first she is going to kill her but then knows her body count will be off by one.Border Run takes a little while to grab hold, but once is does holds your attention.

1608376,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AF4ORUK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","For a movie that hopes to make a statement about issues within the topic of illegal immigration, ""Border Run"" rarely presents anything beyond empty-headed platitudes. The central character, although a brilliant reporter who has covered many stories related to the problem, appears so naive to the reality of what is happening that she seems to live under a rock. As she meets Mexican immigrants attempting an illegal border crossing, she proves herself to be a complete idiot (maybe she's just a stand-in and the filmmakers think the audience are the idiots). She doesn't understand why a pregnant woman would want her child born in America (I guess she's never heard of citizenship). But even worse, she asks a girl ""aren't you a little young to be traveling alone?"" like she's on a vacation and not fleeing for a new life. I'll just be kind and say that the screenplay lacks subtlety and smarts and leave it at that.So for the remainder of my comments, I'll just look at ""Border Run"" as a supposed thriller. Sharon Stone plays the reporter who is so good she can unhinge a savvy politician with one pointed question. After establishing her as a competent professional, however, the remainder of the movie has her doing the most preposterous things. When her brother (Billy Zane) goes missing, she sets about finding him. He was lost on the border leading a crossing. She meets up with a co-worker of his and they immediately drive to the middle of nowhere and find his blood stained hat. What do they do now? Go to a local bar and make out. Heck, he'll still be missing in the morning. With one random phone call, she unravels a way to get to Zane, but it means putting herself in harm's way. There is no conceivable reason for her to do anything she does from here on out, but it helps us to learn about the bad guys who exploit the immigrants. They don't make much sense either. When getting ready to travel with a pregnant woman, why not just stomp her belly for no reason. Surely that will make it easier to transport her!Stone goes in country. Why? So she can immediately try to escape the country. Meanwhile Zane hangs around. It's all so silly and utterly preposterous. A couple of last minute twists aren't very surprising or are poorly executed. The acting veers toward melodrama at every opportunity. I'm no hater of Stone, I think she's often been better than she's given credit for. ""Border Run,"" however, does her no favors. Meant to be heroic, I couldn't help but think that she deserved every manner of unpleasantness that she encounters. Had this movie not taken itself so seriously, it might have achieved a bit of campy fun. But no such luck, ""Border Run"" acts like it's an important film while being a poorly constructed thriller.

1608377,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00AF4ORUK,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","It truly is sad when a star begins to age and can't seem to accept it. I understand that Hollywood has an obsession with young actors but there are roles out there that should be played by actors and actresses that require them to be themselves and in their age bracket. When they don't they appear foolish and out of touch with reality. Proof of that lies in the number of botched plastic surgeries we fans have to witness that leave them looking nothing like the starts we once knew.That being said I was truly saddened seeing Sharon Stone insisting on playing a character far younger than her years. She remains an attractive woman but apparently thinks she needs to play younger roles. I'm sorry, it doesn't work and that becomes the focus for some viewers like myself rather than the story unfolding. Make it a weak story that uses clich&eacute; and seems more politically motivated than anything and it doesn't help.Stone stars as Sofie, a female reporter who is the center of the newsroom, the star journalist. She's an investigative bulldog who wants to discover the bad things in the world and shed journalistic light on them to make things better, a crusader searching for the next big thing. That story is dropped into her lap when her brother goes missing.Her brother (Billy Zane) was working with relief efforts along the US/Mexican border and involved in the smuggling of Mexicans across that border. Now Sofie insists on going across the border in an attempt to save her brother, story be damned. But as is always the case the story does end up catching her eye as well.Soon we find Sofie captured by the bad guys and held captive. She's subjected to the poor treatment that the workers who want to cross the border are exposed to. She also discovers that they're not only being smuggled across as workers but as drug mules too. Can she escape and save both the poor people she's imprisoned with as well as her brother? And just who is behind all of the things going on at the crossing?Before these things could be answered I found myself not caring. This story has been done before and portrayed better. The acting seems run of the mill and not much higher than Lifetime movie quality (sorry Lifetime). I never found myself engaged with anyone involved on screen, cared only about a few characters none of which were leads and in general thought the movie was more motivated by the politics of Hollywood around the immigration issue than in a story about people. News to Hollywood: tell stories about people and stay out of politics. It never comes out well.For me the worst was as I said from the start, seeing Stone playing a role that should have been played by someone no older than her 30s. Yes, Stone remains an attractive woman but I found it completely hard to believe her as a reporter in the position she was in. At 55 (her real age) the character should have been an anchor by now not doing tough investigative journalism. I'll suspend belief for most films but this was too much.On the whole the movie wasn't enjoyable, wasn't entertaining and brought nothing new to the table. Thus I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone with the exception of die hard Stone fans who insist on seeing her in anything at all.",2,ANOTHER CAUSE,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,3239,"['truly', 'sad', 'when', 'star', 'age', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'accept', 'understand', 'Hollywood', 'obsession', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'actors', 'actresses', 'require', 'be', 'age', 'bracket', 'When', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'foolish', 'touch', 'reality', 'Proof', 'number', 'botched', 'plastic', 'surgeries', 'fans', 'have', 'witness', 'leave', 'looking', 'nothing', 'starts', 'once', 'knew.That', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'truly', 'saddened', 'seeing', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'insisting', 'playing', 'character', 'far', 'younger', 'years', 'attractive', 'woman', 'apparently', 'play', 'younger', 'roles', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""n't"", 'work', 'focus', 'viewers', 'rather', 'story', 'unfolding', 'Make', 'weak', 'story', 'clich', 'eacute', 'more', 'politically', 'motivated', 'anything', ""n't"", 'help.Stone', 'stars', 'Sofie', 'female', 'reporter', 'who', 'center', 'newsroom', 'star', 'journalist', 'investigative', 'bulldog', 'who', 'discover', 'bad', 'things', 'world', 'shed', 'journalistic', 'light', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'crusader', 'searching', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'story', 'dropped', 'lap', 'when', 'brother', 'missing.Her', 'brother', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'was', 'working', 'relief', 'efforts', 'US/Mexican', 'border', 'involved', 'smuggling', 'Mexicans', 'border', 'Now', 'Sofie', 'insists', 'going', 'border', 'attempt', 'save', 'brother', 'story', 'be', 'damned', 'always', 'case', 'story', 'end', 'up', 'catching', 'eye', 'well.Soon', 'find', 'Sofie', 'captured', 'bad', 'guys', 'held', 'captive', 'subjected', 'poor', 'treatment', 'workers', 'who', 'want', 'cross', 'border', 'are', 'exposed', 'also', ""'re"", 'not', 'only', 'being', 'smuggled', 'workers', 'drug', 'mules', 'too', 'Can', 'escape', 'save', 'poor', 'people', 'imprisoned', 'as', 'well', 'brother', 'just', 'who', 'things', 'going', 'crossing', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'answered', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'portrayed', 'better', 'acting', 'run', 'mill', 'not', 'much', 'higher', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'quality', 'sorry', 'Lifetime', 'never', 'found', 'engaged', 'anyone', 'involved', 'screen', 'cared', 'only', 'few', 'characters', 'none', 'were', 'leads', 'general', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'motivated', 'politics', 'Hollywood', 'immigration', 'issue', 'story', 'people', 'News', 'Hollywood', 'tell', 'stories', 'people', 'stay', 'politics', 'never', 'out', 'worst', 'was', 'said', 'start', 'seeing', 'Stone', 'playing', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'someone', 'older', '30s', 'Yes', 'Stone', 'attractive', 'woman', 'found', 'completely', 'hard', 'believe', 'reporter', 'position', 'was', '55', 'real', 'age', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'anchor', 'now', 'not', 'doing', 'tough', 'investigative', 'journalism', ""'ll"", 'suspend', 'belief', 'most', 'films', 'was', 'too', 'much.On', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'brought', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'Thus', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'exception', 'die', 'hard', 'Stone', 'fans', 'who', 'insist', 'seeing', 'anything']",Border Run

1608382,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00AF4ORUK,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","In ""Border Run,"" an American TV reporter Sofie sets out to find her brother Aaron who went missing around the US-Mexican border. She believes something bad had happened to him because the last time she heard his voice over the phone, she clearly heard gunshots, too. So she travels to Mexico herself and enlists the help of his co-worker Rafael (Rosemberg Salgado), to discover the truths.As you expect, the truths have something to do with illegal immigrants. Sharon Stone (who also co-executive-produced) plays the role of the determined reporter with gusto, but with all respect to her it is hard to take her character seriously, when she is seen making out with Rafael BEFORE her brother is found out. Plus, there is more than one incredible coincidence and strange decision making.But what is really disappointing is that her journey neither convinces nor interests us. No doubt Sofie's search for her brother is intended to serve as a portal through which viewers are allowed to face, as Sofie does, the grim reality of illegal border crossing. The idea is not bad, but the film needs a director who can handle both the thriller elements and the sensitive social issue at the same time more effectively, as Michael Winterbottom did in ""In This World.""As a missing person thriller ""Border Run"" lacks tension.
