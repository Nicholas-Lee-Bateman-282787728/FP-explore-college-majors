948965,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BT96E6,A Customer,"[4, 5]","The characters in Love Ludlow seem to be living in some kind of netherworld of paranoid angst, they're lovable, endearing, and good-natured, but they also border on the irritating and are often annoying. But this shouldn't let viewers from enjoying this sweet-natured little film that stands as a kind of gentle ode to finding one's true love. With all its faults there's no doubt that Love Ludlow's heart is in the right place and are some likable  - if a bit overly eager - performances from its trio of lead characters.Love Ludlow's missteps early on try one's patience, but there are rewards in sticking with this film, because it does say some interesting things about love and the need to actually depend on someone for emotional survival. Myra (Alicia Goranson) is a brash, alternative looking, and totally tough talking Queens girl who has had to care for her dysfunctional brother Ludlow (Brendan Sexton III) ever since their mother died five years ago.Ludlow is one of those child-adults. He's about twenty, but has the behavioral habits and the emotional capacity of a six year old. Terrified of going out into the world, Ludlow bolts himself in their apartment all day and paints quotes from Shakespeare onto pieces of paper, whilst Myra works as an office temp. She doesn't have to worry while she's gone, because Ludlow would never leave the apartment alone.The poor Myra seems to be living in an emotional vacuum, perhaps hardened by years of having to shoulder Ludlow's dependence on her. Shut off from her fellow workers, she spends her days grumpy and serious and absolutely refuses to be flattered by any man. Until the shy and kindly Reggie (David Eigenberg) come along and persistently entices her, eventually winning a date. Myra's feistiness and her independent spirit immediately capture Reggie. They hit it off, his meekness balancing out her crustiness, which gradually disappears. Of course, Ludlow, feels threatened by all this attention Myra is getting; he wants her all to himself.Whilst Love, Ludlow is well written and has some moments of serious drama, the film is ultimately hampered by David Paterson's script that tends to rush through some of the character development: Myra transforms far too quickly from a gruff unhappy soul into a shining beacon of happiness when she starts dating Reggie, and Reggie ends up bonding with Ludlow a little too rapidly. Even Ludlow himself has moments of inconstancy, gravitating between an amicable acceptance of Reggie and a sort of truculent resignation at the whole situation.The performances are all pretty good, especially Alicia Goranson as Myra; she is just so conflicted, wanting to care for her brother as much as she wants to live her own life and be free of him. Likewise, Eigenberg presents Reggie as a sympathetic loner whom the viewer wants to succeed. Love Ludlow is the sort of film you wouldn't want to pay to see in the theatre, rent it instead on the ""two for one"" days. Yet those viewers who like ""quirky,"" ""goofy"" and ""cute"" characters, will probably find a lot to like in Love Ludlow, just don't look at the film too critically.

948968,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BT96E6,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","First time screenwriter David Patterson adapted his own play 'Finger Painting in a Murphy Bed' for the film LOVE, LUDLOW making the onus of the success of the film rest heavily on his shoulders. Fortunately the producers found first-time director Adrienne J. Weiss who has capably transformed a delicate triangle into a solid little comedy.  If polish is lacking in the final product it can easily be forgiven by the fact that this is a new venture.A three character story, each of the three people we get to know is borderline functional in their approach to life and the world at large.  Myra (Alicia Goranson) is a hard working office temp but is socially crippled by the fact that she is the caretaker for her bipolar brother Ludlow (Brendan Sexton III) who is confined to their tiny apartment and demands every ounce of Myra's attention.  At work, love starved but socially anxious Myra meets Reggie (David Eigenberg), a gentle naive soul who has never been in any type of relationship.  The two socially inept people find 'something that is missing' in their lives, but when Myra faces the fact that she is confined to quarters due to the obligation compulsive Ludlow's care and when Reggie meets Ludlow and realizes Myra is unable to move out of her life space due to Ludlow's childlike tantrums and demands, the strange trio's compatibility is challenged and the method in which the three cope with the big decisions in their lives is the resolution of the movie.The dialogue is sharp but more in keeping with a stage drama than a film: there is a lack of flow, which is not the fault of the editors or the cinematographer or the director.  The script is stage bound.  But given that fact, this is a modern comedy, funny at times, aching at times, but always reflecting the innate humor in even the saddest of human lives.  The trio of leads gives fine performances as do the supporting cast members.  In a year where sibling dysfunction is one of the topics du jour, LOVE, LUDLOW  holds up well in the competition.

948971,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000BT96E6,Mark,"[4, 4]","If ever there was an overlooked film, Love, Ludlow would be that film.  Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival is a fantastic way to shed some light on some fantastic overlooked films, but I was semi-disappointed that this film did not attract his attention.  Not that the films that he screened weren't fantastic, but I think this one could have attracted a larger audience with the right marketing.  After appearing at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and becoming an Official Selaction, Love, Ludlow disappeared, away from the public and critic alike.  Sitting lonely on the shelf of the video store I work at, the only copy of Love, Ludlow seemed overshadowed by the big market (and often nauseating) blockbusters that litter the shelves.  The film's director is Adrienne Weiss, who takes her second, and supremely successful, shot at directing.  As the director is virtually unknown, she uses actors that aren't really prime time.  Many may recognize David Eigenberg from HBO's Sex and the City, and many others may recognize Alicia Goranson from the hit 90's series Roseanne.  Goranson is Myra, a twentysomething temp, working for a small corporation in New York, and washing some of local tenants' laundry so she can support herself and her brother Ludlow (Brendan Sexton III), who is mentally challenged and was left to her keeping after the death of their mother.  Eigenberg is Reggie, a co-worker of Myra's, who becomes attracted to her angry, Bronx-girl personality.  They begin to date, and we begin to see Ludlow feeling like a third wheel in the relationship.  Although we feel bad for Ludlow, we certainly cannot expect Myra staying single just to spend every waking moment with Ludlow.  Ludlow begins to act out, taking Reggie's keys and making him pay forty dollars, and spend the night to get them back.  Reggie tries his best to form a positive relationship with Ludlow, but as Reggie gets closer, Ludlow pushes him away.  Eigenberg does his best work in this film, and we see early in the film his frustration with Ludlow, only to lead to a scene where he blows up and yells at Ludlow for ""running away"".  Sexton does a nice job of playing Ludlow without venturing into the more severely disabled roles of Hoffman's Rain Man or Sean Penn's I Am Sam, and I enjoyed watching his performances and seeing where he would take the character next.  Goranson, on the other hand, was more difficult to disect.  At first I thought her performance was a bit stiff and unchallenging, but as I look further at it, she does a decent job at conveying a character who hides her emotions behind a wall, that is her Bronx-girl attitude.  We do see her break down once or twice in the film, but it is always restrained as she tries to put out a strong personality.  She is, in fact, semi-new to the idea of dating, and she has never really expressed other emotions, besides anger.  She needs to be tough.  She is living in a world where a large amount of responsibility has been dumped on her, and no one, even the tenants in her building, shows much sympathy.  The film is a quick, 86-minute view, and I highly reccomend seeing this film.  It has good leading and supporting performances, although, I could have done without some of the eccentricities that come with some of these characters.  The character of Carol, a co-worker of Myra's who lives with her mother, is a bit unneccesary in the beginning, and I wasn't really compelled by her.  She does provide a moment of relief during a very funny scene involving yet another co-worker named Storkelson, a sexist pig who insists on sharing his sexual stories.  Overall, Love, Ludlow is not the best film of 2005, but it is funny, charming, and highly entertaining.",4,Charming,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,3718,"['ever', 'was', 'overlooked', 'film', 'Love', 'Ludlow', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Overlooked', 'Film', 'Festival', 'fantastic', 'way', 'shed', 'light', 'fantastic', 'overlooked', 'films', 'was', 'semi-disappointed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'attract', 'attention', 'Not', 'films', 'screened', 'were', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'think', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'attracted', 'larger', 'audience', 'right', 'marketing', 'appearing', '2005', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'becoming', 'Official', 'Selaction', 'Love', 'Ludlow', 'disappeared', 'away', 'public', 'critic', 'alike', 'Sitting', 'lonely', 'shelf', 'video', 'store', 'work', 'only', 'copy', 'Love', 'Ludlow', 'seemed', 'overshadowed', 'big', 'market', 'often', 'nauseating', 'blockbusters', 'litter', 'shelves', 'film', 'director', 'Adrienne', 'Weiss', 'who', 'second', 'supremely', 'successful', 'shot', 'directing', 'director', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'prime', 'time', 'Many', 'may', 'recognize', 'David', 'Eigenberg', 'HBO', 'Sex', 'City', 'many', 'others', 'may', 'recognize', 'Alicia', 'Goranson', 'hit', '90', 'series', 'Roseanne', 'Goranson', 'Myra', 'twentysomething', 'temp', 'working', 'small', 'corporation', 'New', 'York', 'washing', 'local', 'tenants', 'laundry', 'can', 'support', 'brother', 'Ludlow', 'Brendan', 'Sexton', 'III', 'who', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'was', 'left', 'keeping', 'death', 'mother', 'Eigenberg', 'Reggie', 'co-worker', 'Myra', 'who', 'attracted', 'angry', 'Bronx-girl', 'personality', 'begin', 'date', 'begin', 'see', 'Ludlow', 'feeling', 'third', 'wheel', 'relationship', 'feel', 'bad', 'Ludlow', 'certainly', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'Myra', 'staying', 'single', 'just', 'spend', 'waking', 'moment', 'Ludlow', 'Ludlow', 'act', 'out', 'taking', 'Reggie', 'keys', 'making', 'pay', 'forty', 'dollars', 'spend', 'night', 'get', 'back', 'Reggie', 'best', 'form', 'positive', 'relationship', 'Ludlow', 'Reggie', 'closer', 'Ludlow', 'away', 'Eigenberg', 'best', 'work', 'film', 'see', 'early', 'film', 'frustration', 'Ludlow', 'only', 'lead', 'scene', 'where', 'up', 'yells', 'Ludlow', 'running', 'away', 'Sexton', 'nice', 'job', 'playing', 'Ludlow', 'venturing', 'more', 'severely', 'disabled', 'roles', 'Hoffman', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Am', 'Sam', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'performances', 'seeing', 'where', 'would', 'take', 'character', 'next', 'Goranson', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'more', 'difficult', 'disect', 'first', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'bit', 'stiff', 'unchallenging', 'look', 'further', 'decent', 'job', 'conveying', 'character', 'who', 'emotions', 'wall', 'Bronx-girl', 'attitude', 'do', 'see', 'break', 'down', 'once', 'twice', 'film', 'always', 'restrained', 'put', 'out', 'strong', 'personality', 'fact', 'semi-new', 'idea', 'dating', 'never', 'really', 'expressed', 'other', 'emotions', 'anger', 'be', 'tough', 'living', 'world', 'where', 'large', 'amount', 'responsibility', 'been', 'dumped', 'one', 'even', 'tenants', 'building', 'much', 'sympathy', 'film', 'quick', '86-minute', 'view', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'seeing', 'film', 'good', 'leading', 'supporting', 'performances', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'eccentricities', 'come', 'characters', 'character', 'Carol', 'co-worker', 'Myra', 'who', 'mother', 'bit', 'unneccesary', 'beginning', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'compelled', 'provide', 'moment', 'relief', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'involving', 'yet', 'co-worker', 'named', 'Storkelson', 'sexist', 'pig', 'who', 'sharing', 'sexual', 'stories', 'Overall', 'Love', 'Ludlow', 'not', 'best', 'film', '2005', 'funny', 'charming', 'highly', 'entertaining']","Love, Ludlow"
