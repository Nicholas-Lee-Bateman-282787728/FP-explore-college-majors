Hamil,"[3, 3]","Like so many others I am a huge fan of this show and am thrilled to have the first two seasons.I guess I got lucky though as I didn't order the second season until after the corrections were made. I fail to see however why so many are complaining about the price. Yes it is high but that old saying applies here, "" You Get WhatYou Pay For "". I paid the higher price and got quality.I keep seeing reviewers saying they won't purchase until the price goes down while in the same breath complain that it's taken so long for seasons to be released. Do these folks not understand that by refusing to purchase or as some have suggested boycotting just means no release at all? I'm not fond of high prices either but to me it's worth it to get the product.This second season has brilliant color and most of the episodes run seamlessly so that they play like a mini-movie instead of seeing where the commercials were. It's also nice to see that the episodes are unedited in that needed dialouge is still there to explain what is being said and why, television cuts dialouge in order to put in commercials so that far too often we're left to wonder, just as movies are cut to fit in a time frame, meaning the most important parts are removed  and we see the buthered  version until we buy it on dvd and actally see what the film is all about. If you are truely a fan of this show and want seasons 3 and 4 released then go ahead and buy, you won't regret it.",5,just wonderful,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,1448,"['so', 'many', 'others', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'am', 'thrilled', 'have', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.I', 'guess', 'got', 'lucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'order', 'second', 'season', 'corrections', 'were', 'made', 'fail', 'see', 'however', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'complaining', 'price', 'Yes', 'high', 'old', 'saying', 'applies', 'here', 'Get', 'WhatYou', 'Pay', 'paid', 'higher', 'price', 'got', 'quality.I', 'keep', 'seeing', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'price', 'down', 'same', 'breath', 'complain', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'seasons', 'be', 'released', 'Do', 'folks', 'not', 'understand', 'refusing', 'purchase', 'have', 'suggested', 'boycotting', 'just', 'release', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'high', 'prices', 'either', 'worth', 'get', 'product.This', 'second', 'season', 'brilliant', 'color', 'most', 'episodes', 'run', 'seamlessly', 'so', 'play', 'mini-movie', 'instead', 'seeing', 'where', 'commercials', 'were', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'episodes', 'are', 'unedited', 'needed', 'dialouge', 'still', 'there', 'explain', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'why', 'television', 'cuts', 'dialouge', 'order', 'put', 'commercials', 'so', 'far', 'too', 'often', ""'re"", 'left', 'wonder', 'just', 'movies', 'are', 'cut', 'fit', 'time', 'frame', 'meaning', 'most', 'important', 'parts', 'are', 'removed', 'see', 'buthered', 'version', 'buy', 'dvd', 'actally', 'see', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'are', 'truely', 'fan', 'show', 'want', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'released', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

SOME CREDIT SHOULD BE GIVEN THEM FOR JUMPING ON THE BREAD WAGON. MY MAIN PROBLEM WAS WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS IT WAS LISTED FOR ABOUT $27.00. IN A DAY IT JUMPED TO $42.00. WITHOUT SOME ADVANCE WARNING I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER BUYING THIS FOR ALL THE REASONS ALREADY LISTED. MOST OF US ARE MOVIE ""COLLECTORS"" AND NOT JUST CASUAL BUYERS. FOR THIS PRICE I CAN'T SEE DOING IT IF IT ISN'T A FULL RELEASE. THE PRICE MIGHT WELL BE CONSIDERED TOO MUCH EVEN FOR THAT IN A THE WRITTINGS ON THE WALL FOR DVD'S WITH BLU-RAY. ANOTHER FACTOR AS IN MOST CASES THE SECOND SEASON HAD CHANGES WHICH MAKE IT A RISK TO BUY AS THE FIRST HAD A FINE BEGINNING BUT WITH CHARACTER DECISIONS AND WEAKER STORIES WHICH HURT THE SHOW AND WERE CORRECTED JUST IN TIME TO MAKE THE LAST EPISODES WORTHY. THAT CARRIED OVER INTO TGHIS SEASON. HAVING UNREMASTERED SINGLE MOVIES IS ONE THING, SETS ANOTHER ( I REALIZE THIS IS THE CASE EVEN WITH A FULL REALEASE ). THE PROBLEM IS TOO MANY GOOD MOVIES THAT WOULD SELL ( AND MANY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ) ARE BEING MIXED WITH MOVIES THAT QUITE FRANKLY WOULDN'T SELL WELL. LOOK OVER AMAZONS LIST AND THEIR ARE A FEW GEMS THERE. AT LEAST MOST SINGLE DISC'S ARE UNDER $19.00 WHICH IS A JOKE FOR A DVD-R DISC.

However, the price isn't the biggest issue for me.  The second season is finally getting released to DVD where regular DVD channels might have prevented any other seasons seeing release.  The price may be an economics thing based on how many MOD copies MGM and Amazon think might get pressed and MOD is a great way to finally get the rest of the series out there (season one must not have sold enough copies to justify regular releases for MGM).

The episodes seem a bit grainy at times, but I think that's purposeful---- to add to the mystery of the show.  The episodes are indeed out of order and my disc #11 is also missing ""The Choice"" episode, but I think Amazon and MGM will probably make it good.  I sent them an email and will let everyone know how things stand.  But frankly, with the exception of the missing episode, I'm pretty pleased with the set.ADDENDA 3/8/10:  I talked to someone in Amazon's MOD department and he said they had read the reviews on the sets problems.  They said they would definitely contact the company that manufactured this set and ask for a re-do.  How long that will take is anyone's guess.

1298953,A14JTRQUNRNJZP,B002Y26URE,kd5,"[0, 0]","I knocked a star off for lack of product packaging as shown in the picture for this box set.  What I received were 3 amaray cases, individually wrapped (just as you'd find a typical DVD), each with their own UPC number.  Not good if you're using DVD cataloging software to catalog your collection.  Sits on the shelf just fine but I wanted a single UPC number for the entire season and a box set package to house the cases, the box set packaging pictured here is not included.  If you're entering this into DVD cataloging software and would like a single UPC number to enter for the whole season, use 883904201434, the pic for the actual product can be found at DVD Empire (the image shown there is the same for all 3 cases).As for the actual season, this would've gotten 5 stars from me if not for the lack of packaging.  Poltergeist: The Legacy is an excellent series, so far Season 2 is even better than Season 1 (opinion shared by my wife as well).  It seems as if MGM has worked out most of the bugs, episodes are in order, the last episode, The Choice, is included now (previous reviewers had stated The Choice wasn't there, it is now).  Picture quality is not perfect (seems a little grainy to me), audio is not perfect (dialog overshadowed by the music just a tad), but all in all not too terribly bad, and quite possibly the only way you'll ever own the physical Poltergeist: The Legacy: Season 2.Recommended, if it's on sale again someday for less than half of the typical selling price.  -kd5-",4,No outer carton as shown in pic,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,1504,"['knocked', 'star', 'off', 'lack', 'product', 'packaging', 'shown', 'picture', 'box', 'set', 'What', 'received', 'were', '3', 'amaray', 'cases', 'individually', 'wrapped', 'just', ""'d"", 'find', 'typical', 'DVD', 'own', 'UPC', 'number', 'Not', 'good', ""'re"", 'using', 'DVD', 'cataloging', 'software', 'catalog', 'collection', 'Sits', 'shelf', 'just', 'fine', 'wanted', 'single', 'UPC', 'number', 'entire', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'package', 'house', 'cases', 'box', 'set', 'packaging', 'pictured', 'here', 'not', 'included', ""'re"", 'entering', 'DVD', 'cataloging', 'software', 'would', 'like', 'single', 'UPC', 'number', 'enter', 'whole', 'season', 'use', '883904201434', 'pic', 'actual', 'product', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'DVD', 'Empire', 'image', 'shown', 'same', '3', 'cases', '.As', 'actual', 'season', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'lack', 'packaging', 'Poltergeist', 'Legacy', 'excellent', 'series', 'far', 'Season', '2', 'even', 'better', 'Season', '1', 'opinion', 'shared', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'MGM', 'worked', 'out', 'most', 'bugs', 'episodes', 'are', 'order', 'last', 'episode', 'Choice', 'included', 'now', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'had', 'stated', 'Choice', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'now', 'Picture', 'quality', 'not', 'perfect', 'little', 'grainy', 'audio', 'not', 'perfect', 'dialog', 'overshadowed', 'music', 'just', 'tad', 'not', 'too', 'terribly', 'bad', 'quite', 'possibly', 'only', 'way', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'own', 'physical', 'Poltergeist', 'Legacy', 'Season', '2.Recommended', 'sale', 'again', 'someday', 'less', 'half', 'typical', 'selling', 'price', '-kd5-']",N/A
