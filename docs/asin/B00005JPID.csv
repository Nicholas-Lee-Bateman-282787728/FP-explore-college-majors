651666,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B00005JPID,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[2, 4]","White Dog is not an easy film to sit through and it rubbed a lot of people the wrong way for a simple reason; it hits close to home. Racism did exist back then just like it does now and the film strips the idea of racism down to its simplest, by showing it for what it is; fear. And what clearer way to demonstrate this but centering the film around a dog who was raised to fear and attack black people on sight.Kristy McNicol has a natural, easy-going screen presence and delivers a solid performance as an actress whose adopted stray turns out to attack people. She is appalled when her loving, good-natured German Shepherd disappears and comes back stained with blood. When she takes him to a trainer to be rehabilitated, she learns that he doesn't attack just anyone, only black people. Since pupphyhood, the dog was habitually beaten and taught to associate black people with being attacked, until he attacks any black person on sight, before they get him. This is racism stripped to its barest; fear, taught to us, handed down by those we learn from. But can a simple creature like this dog be taught to overcome his fear? That's the task that the trainer, played by Paul Winfield, is set with. If he can cure this dog of his racism, then why can't people?White Dog was controversial on its release, in fact some people insisted on branding it as a racist movie. There is nothing racist about it, except that it exposes the tumour in our society that is racism and what it essentially is. Things like this really have happened, racists trained their dogs to perform these terrible acts. White Dog is clever because the subject of racism isn't beaten over the viewer's head. The dog is the perfect demonstration of this. Here is a creature completely innocent of his terrible crimes, the guilty party being those who trained him. White Dog isn't afraid to take us along for the ride and show us what exactly this fear-ridden dog does, and we know that he only does these things because he's been programmed to do so, showcasing the true, subtle horror of racism. It's a graphic, tough movie that isn't easy to sit through, but it's an important film that should be appreciated, not feared. It's a sad thing that White Dog was so shunned because people branded it as a racist movie, thus showcasing prejudice of their own. What irony.Even with its low budget, White Dog delivers the punches, and while it doesn't look like a polished film, it somehow works much better because of this. The performances all around are stellar. Outshining all, though, is the main character, the dog himself. It's downright unreal to witness an animal acting like that. Sad but sobering, White Dog is an intelligent film that you will walk away from fresher and more alert.",4,Racism Stripped Bare,1309996800,"07 7, 2011",2011,2759,"['White', 'Dog', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'sit', 'rubbed', 'lot', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'simple', 'reason', 'close', 'home', 'Racism', 'did', 'exist', 'back', 'then', 'just', 'now', 'film', 'idea', 'racism', 'down', 'simplest', 'showing', 'what', 'fear', 'what', 'clearer', 'way', 'demonstrate', 'centering', 'film', 'dog', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'fear', 'attack', 'black', 'people', 'sight.Kristy', 'McNicol', 'natural', 'easy-going', 'screen', 'presence', 'solid', 'performance', 'actress', 'adopted', 'stray', 'out', 'attack', 'people', 'appalled', 'when', 'loving', 'good-natured', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'disappears', 'back', 'stained', 'blood', 'When', 'trainer', 'be', 'rehabilitated', ""n't"", 'attack', 'just', 'anyone', 'only', 'black', 'people', 'pupphyhood', 'dog', 'was', 'habitually', 'beaten', 'taught', 'associate', 'black', 'people', 'being', 'attacked', 'black', 'person', 'sight', 'get', 'racism', 'stripped', 'barest', 'fear', 'taught', 'handed', 'down', 'learn', 'can', 'simple', 'creature', 'dog', 'be', 'taught', 'overcome', 'fear', 'task', 'trainer', 'played', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'set', 'can', 'cure', 'dog', 'racism', 'then', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'people', 'White', 'Dog', 'was', 'controversial', 'release', 'fact', 'people', 'insisted', 'branding', 'racist', 'movie', 'nothing', 'racist', 'tumour', 'society', 'racism', 'what', 'essentially', 'Things', 'really', 'have', 'happened', 'racists', 'trained', 'dogs', 'perform', 'terrible', 'acts', 'White', 'Dog', 'clever', 'subject', 'racism', ""n't"", 'beaten', 'over', 'viewer', 'head', 'dog', 'perfect', 'demonstration', 'Here', 'creature', 'completely', 'innocent', 'terrible', 'crimes', 'guilty', 'party', 'being', 'who', 'trained', 'White', 'Dog', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'along', 'ride', 'show', 'exactly', 'fear-ridden', 'dog', 'know', 'only', 'things', 'been', 'programmed', 'do', 'so', 'showcasing', 'true', 'subtle', 'horror', 'racism', 'graphic', 'tough', 'movie', ""n't"", 'easy', 'sit', 'important', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'not', 'feared', 'sad', 'thing', 'White', 'Dog', 'was', 'so', 'shunned', 'people', 'branded', 'racist', 'movie', 'thus', 'showcasing', 'prejudice', 'own', 'What', 'low', 'budget', 'White', 'Dog', 'punches', ""n't"", 'look', 'polished', 'film', 'somehow', 'much', 'better', 'performances', 'around', 'are', 'stellar', 'Outshining', 'main', 'character', 'dog', 'downright', 'unreal', 'witness', 'animal', 'acting', 'Sad', 'sobering', 'White', 'Dog', 'intelligent', 'film', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'fresher', 'more', 'alert']",White Dog

Defiant, vicious, and unsettling, this story delivers a strong bite against the cruelty of nature's most primitive beast--man.A young woman picks up a beautiful stray dog, but soon realizes the sheer terror that lies beneath the fur.  She's adopted an attack dog, a White Dog, an animal trained to single out and maliciously attack black people.You white folk better be careful with your tan.  This dog sees dark skin, it attacks with a bitter hatred.Instead of putting the beast to sleep, the new owner takes it to a specialized trainer, to see if this animosity can be unlearned.  Of course, reversing a mindset is no easy task.This is a powerful story, a bit heavy-handed no doubt, but necessary.  The acting in this movie is sub-par, except from the dog.

Until now, of course.This film was made for Paramount Studios in 1984, but they never gave it a theatrical release.  The plot, about a stray dog taken in by Kristy MacNichol that is a ""white dog"", a dog trained to kill and maim black people, was considered too hot for them, and the film ended up being a legendary, unseen work.  It ended up being the final film of the great Sam Fuller (who directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Curtis Hanson, the director of L.A. Confidential).  Is the film great, or is it a disappointment?  Well...The film is mixed.  When it works, it's very, very good, and when it doesn't, it's slightly embarrassing (which may have been another reason why Paramount didn't release it in the States).  It's never cringe inducing or creaky, but there are notable flaws here.  There is bad dialogue (some of which sounds dubbed in, and it's bad dubbing), overacting, some bad camera moves, sledgehammer music cues (especially during an early attack scene), and boring, arbitary secondary characters (Kristy MacNichol's boyfriend and a policeman, for example).  The first third of the film is a bit dull.  But when Paul Winfield enters the film (he's the trainer that attempts to cure the white dog of its racism), the film is much better.  Winfield is great here, playing an entirely believable, passionate person who really wants to cure the dog of its hatred of black people.  There are some powerful moments, like when Kristy goes to the pound to look for her dog.  We see in long shot a dog placed in a chamber that puts him to sleep.  We don't see the dog pass away (Fuller isn't exploitative), but he shows a close up of the chamber, which is powerful and sad.  After that, Kristy becomes determined to cure her dog.Fuller comes up with some excellent camera work (especially in the cage where the animal is retrained), great performances by the dog (there were five dogs portraying the white dog in the film), some funny humour directed at R2D2 (yes, the Star Wars robot), and a very powerful and memorable ending.  Overall, it's a mixed bag, but its positives outweight its negatives.  If you like Fuller, you should check this out.  It's not perfect, but it's a memorable film.  It was silly of Paramount not to release the film, but Criterion has done us all a favour.

I thought the quality of the picture was superb! The acting teetered between mediocre and good, however.I'm sure the film had a much greater impact back in the early eighties when it first came out. Racism was still a raw subject in much of America. The fact it had a limited theatrical release tells me that America was not yet comfortable with the raw message of the film: Once a racist, always a racist.The reason I chose to watch this film was because I find Sam Fuller's film intriguing and relentlessly disturbing.

There is much to be read into this film, and it's one of my favorites. Several scenes make me tear up. Yes, animal cruelty is grotesque in any case, and this is a case of it being psychological which is, to some, even more disturbing. But if you love cinema, and the movies of S. T. Fuller, then you have to own this Criterion disc. The film offers plenty for discussion and critical analysis. I guess you need to be an animal lover to really get into this one or to understand it fully, but I think it's one of the best ethical discussions for a case for animals ever committed to celluloid, and to me that means something.The Criterion disc has some great extras, a 55 minute making of piece which is a must see, featuring writer Curtis Hanson. The other great piece is the booklet, which has two fine critical pieces included in it.

And it further gained a following through obscurity and not being seen. As usual, the legend grows in the absence of much of anyone having seen the work.It stars 70's oddity Kristy McNicoll who as usual is a bad actress. The script is terrible, the direction is terrible, the music is terrible and its all heavy-handed paternalistic messages around every corner. And there is just something really wrong with a metaphor that combines dealing with racism in society and dog training. Jameson Parker is another TV actor who puts in a tv movie of the week performance. Paul Winfield manages to turn in a good performance.

Instead, the characters in this film all express sanitized, politically correct points of view--they are all untouched by the reality of racism.

At the same time, his stories (usually B stories, always with an element of melodrama, and a heavy dose of pulp, and a low-budget vibe) always also manage to be unique and engaging.  This film is no exception.It is a film about Julie, a young, aspiring actress who adopts a dog and finds out it is no ordinary dog.  It is a ""white dog"" trained from a young age to fear and attack people with black skin.  Julie, convinced that the dog is not at fault for its training, finds an animal trainer willing to attempt a rehabilitation.  What Fuller achieves by making the dog both Julie's protector and the perpetrator of violence is to generate both sympathy for the animal and anger at its behavior.  Fuller's message, in a nutshell, may be to hate (and fight against) racism without at the same time hating the racist.  While the dog's training is an obvious metaphor for racism - that aims to show its stupidity and insidiousness, it also, more subtly, makes clear that those who grow up racist inherit their prejudices unthinkingly and should therefore also be considered victims.Sam Fuller's astonishing technique is to take a very blunt premise and weave it into a story that (however hokey it might seem if merely described) manages to be gripping, and somehow even plausible.  Every character offers something unique and memorable, and I found myself thoroughly drawn in by the story.  The dialogue works on multiple levels, with several conversations serving as both blunt and powerful lectures to the audience on the evil and stupidity of racism, and plausible conversations between characters that flow out of actual situations.  Few directors could pull this off without it seeming hokey and heavyhanded.  Sam Fuller manages.

651684,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B00005JPID,Robin Simmons,"[37, 40]","In 1982, Samuel Fuller's ""WHITE DOG"" created a storm of controversy that resulted in a limited theatrical release with no follow-up video until now.What was falsely labeled an incendiary racist film that could provoke real life violence is instead a bold anti-racist parable about how racism is learned or taught. In the movie the metaphor is a dog that has been trained to attack people with dark skin.The origin of the story is a harrowing true incident Romain Gary wrote about in Life magazine.The movie story is simple.  Julie Sawyer (Kristy McNichol in her first adult role) is a young actress who, while driving one night, accidentally hits a white German shepherd on a mountain road.  She takes it to a vet and tries to find the owner.  In the meantime, Julie grows attached to the dog.  One night it saves her from a intruder who attempts to rape her.  Later, the dog runs away and comes home bloody.  On a movie set with Julie, the dog attacks a black actress.  Julie realizes the dog has been trained as an attack dog so she takes it to ""Noah's Ark"" an animal shelter and training facility hoping the dog can be deprogrammed in some way.  She is told that the dog is a ""white dog,"" one trained to attack black people.  At the facility, Keys (Paul Winfield), a dog expert sees this as an opportunity to see if racial prejudice can be unlearned.This low-budget film is sometimes heavy-handed but is immensely watchable and the restored uncut widescreen transfer is, as with all Criterion editions, made from the best elements available and is very crisp and clean.Kristy McNichol has a natural, winning charisma on screen.  Her top billing is justified and she has an easy, believable chemistry with the dog (actually five dogs were used).Paul Winfield dominates the latter half of the film.  His performance is focused and intense.  I was reminded of a superb dog story in which he starred, 1972's ""Sounder.""The great Burl Ives has a small part as the co-owner of ""Noah's Ark.""  It is great to hear that singular voice even if it is only in spoken words.Director Sam Fuller had a reputation as a tough, cigar-chomping sometimes over-the-top, story-teller.  He has been called ""the tabloid poet.""  Fuller did not shy away from controversial issues and in fact helmed other films with racial conflict as a theme.  He died in 1997 at the age of 85.There's a wonderful featurette containing new interviews with producer Jon Davison, co-writer Curtis Hanson (""L.A.

The DVD also includes behind the scenes photographs.This is a film you won't soon forget.",5,A highly controversial film,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,1123,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'edition', 'filmWhite', 'Dog', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'films', '1980', 'was', 'suppressed', 'due', 'controversy.The', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'actress', 'who', 'stray', 'dog', 'later', 'discovers', 'dog', 'had', 'been', 'trained', 'attack', 'kill', 'black', 'people', 'African-American', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'role', 'animal', 'trainer', 'who', 'rehabilitate', 'dog.The', 'film', 'case', 'real', 'actress', 'who', 'happened', 'real', 'incidents', 'South', 'where', 'racists', 'trained', 'dogs', 'do', 'such', 'horrific', 'acts.The', 'film', 'also', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'one', 'few', 'film', 'roles.I', 'liked', 'film', 'saw', 'message', 'how', 'racism', 'taught', 'not', 'inherent', 'film', 'was', 'misunderstood', 'not', 'widely', 'released', 'edition', 'premiere', 'home', 'video.The', 'DVD', 'interview', 'director', 'Sam', 'Fuller', 'widow', 'Christa', 'Lang-Fuller', 'film', 'producer', 'Jon', 'Davison', 'co-writer', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'dog', 'trainer', 'Karl', 'Lewis-Miller', 'DVD', 'also', 'scenes', 'photographs.This', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",White Dog
