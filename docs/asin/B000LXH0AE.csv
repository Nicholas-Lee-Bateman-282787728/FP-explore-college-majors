1041270,A1Y7PVYQ9NOHLB,B000LXH0AE,,"[3, 3]","Best-selling author, Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), is struggling with her newest novel. How will she kill the main character, Harold Crick? Little does she know, Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is real and she is writing his life story. Harold has been hearing her voice in his head as she narrates every moment of his mundane life as an IRS agent. Harold seeks out help from a professor of literature (Dustin Hoffman), and together they try to figure out who the voice is and what it means for Harold's future.This is admittedly a very ""out-there"" concept, but amazingly it works. The acting is superb and this is one of Ferrell's strongest performances. Ferrell is more notably recognized for his slap-stick comedies and quirky characters, but here he shows he can also be serious and charming. The supporting cast of Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah add a clever dose of richness to an already engaging performance by Ferrell.This is a fun film that beautifully explores the human psyche and the beauty of literature. Not only is this film entertaining, but it is also extremely thought provoking. Harold Crick struggles with a universal question: what will we do with the life we each have been given? Are we led by fate or do we have a choice in regards to our destiny? In the end, the answers Harold Crick discovers and the choices he makes will warm your heart and open your eyes.",5,Strangely Wonderful!,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,1418,"['Best-selling', 'author', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'struggling', 'newest', 'novel', 'How', 'will', 'kill', 'main', 'character', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Little', 'know', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'real', 'writing', 'life', 'story', 'Harold', 'been', 'hearing', 'voice', 'head', 'moment', 'mundane', 'life', 'IRS', 'agent', 'Harold', 'out', 'help', 'professor', 'literature', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'together', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'voice', 'what', 'Harold', 'future.This', 'admittedly', 'very', 'out-there', 'concept', 'amazingly', 'acting', 'superb', 'one', 'Ferrell', 'strongest', 'performances', 'Ferrell', 'more', 'notably', 'recognized', 'slap-stick', 'comedies', 'quirky', 'characters', 'here', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'serious', 'charming', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'add', 'clever', 'dose', 'richness', 'already', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Ferrell.This', 'fun', 'film', 'beautifully', 'human', 'psyche', 'beauty', 'literature', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'entertaining', 'also', 'extremely', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'universal', 'question', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'Are', 'led', 'fate', 'do', 'have', 'choice', 'regards', 'destiny', 'end', 'answers', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'discovers', 'choices', 'will', 'warm', 'heart', 'open', 'eyes']",N/A

So it seems for IRS auditor, Harold Crick (Will Farrell), the updated equivalent of W.H.Auden's, ""Unknown Citizen"".  Harold lives his life with precision.  He is a math prodigy, and his life is dull and repetitive.  When he hears his life narrated by a mysterious voice (Emma Thompson), the prose begs for an explanation and an ending. This voice becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, shaking up his routine.  His inquest about this phenomena only brings about skepticism or derision.  Many understandably believe he is losing his mind.  He seeks first a psychiatrist, whose diagnosis is schizophrenia; then, he seeks what he really wants: literary help.  His sojourn connects with a bookworm lifeguard, Professor Jules Hilbert  (Dustin Hoffman), who takes him up on his paper chase.  Before the enigma resolves, matters really loosen up one day when he audits a radical owner of  a corner coffee/bakery shop,  (Maggie Gyllenhaal).  He is as charming as Zerox machine, and she is as friendly as a banchee, but they manage to fall in love.  Afterall, opposites do attract.Getting to the bottom--or in this case the end--is the crux of the story.  Changes do come about in Harold and his life, but the journey, like life itself, is worth the focus and execution presented in the film.  Much more believable than the likable `Lake House,' and borrowing nothing more than an innovative consciousness presented in movies like `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' `Stranger Than Fiction' lives up to the story title and gives us pause to reflect on the alternatives in life and how they can envelop us--only if we let them.

1041276,A1ETMNKF9HO2TJ,B000LXH0AE,ahw,"[1, 2]","The concept of Stranger than Fiction was admittedly enchanting.  It evokes the kind of cleverness you'd get from a Charlie Kaufman flick (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).  However, unlike those movies, by the second half of the film, the plot device seems to confuse the film thematically.The plot centers (most of the time) on Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) who one day wakes up hearing the voice of a narrator, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) in his head.  This is the source of most of comedy in the movie, with Ferrell's unabashed style fitting in perfectly in situations where he's making a fool of himself in public confronting his narrator.But, unfortunately, that's about as much as the plot device does for the movie.  As the plot progresses, the movie becomes thematically convoluted as the movie can't decide whether to focus on Ferrell's actions or Thompson's.  Is this movie about Ferrell's actions in light of his imminent death?  Or is it about the morality of Thompson's choice of killing a novel character who happens to be real?  And ultimately, the movie fails to really pound any of these themes home - after watching the movie, it feels like a speaker, going up to the podium, pointing his finger in the air as if he had something brilliant to say, but instead walks away silent, tail between his legs.Thematic confusion aside, the movie does bring out a decent performance out of Ferrell, who shows he can do more than just being loud and unabashed, as his resume might suggest.  But the real gem is the stellar performance out of Emma Thompson, who wonderfully portrays the role of neurotic literist.  With her, she brings the refreshingly subtle, dialogue-driven British-style humor that works fantastically opposite Ferrell's situational comedic style.All-in-all, an entertaining flick to catch on TV, or to rent, but nothing groundbreaking as the clever plot device turns out to be less novel and more gimmick.",3,"Clever Concept, but Fizzles Halfway Through",1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,1969,"['concept', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'was', 'admittedly', 'enchanting', 'kind', 'cleverness', ""'d"", 'get', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'flick', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'However', 'movies', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'plot', 'device', 'confuse', 'film', 'thematically.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'most', 'time', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'up', 'hearing', 'voice', 'narrator', 'Kay', 'Eiffel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'head', 'source', 'most', 'comedy', 'movie', 'Ferrell', 'unabashed', 'style', 'fitting', 'perfectly', 'situations', 'where', 'making', 'fool', 'public', 'confronting', 'narrator.But', 'unfortunately', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'plot', 'device', 'movie', 'plot', 'movie', 'thematically', 'convoluted', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'focus', 'Ferrell', 'actions', 'Thompson', 'movie', 'Ferrell', 'actions', 'light', 'imminent', 'death', 'morality', 'Thompson', 'choice', 'killing', 'novel', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'real', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'really', 'pound', 'themes', 'home', 'watching', 'movie', 'speaker', 'going', 'up', 'podium', 'pointing', 'finger', 'air', 'had', 'something', 'brilliant', 'say', 'instead', 'walks', 'away', 'silent', 'tail', 'legs.Thematic', 'confusion', 'aside', 'movie', 'bring', 'out', 'decent', 'performance', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'being', 'loud', 'unabashed', 'resume', 'might', 'suggest', 'real', 'gem', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'role', 'neurotic', 'literist', 'refreshingly', 'subtle', 'dialogue-driven', 'British-style', 'humor', 'fantastically', 'opposite', 'Ferrell', 'situational', 'comedic', 'style.All-in-all', 'entertaining', 'flick', 'catch', 'TV', 'rent', 'nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'clever', 'plot', 'device', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'novel', 'more', 'gimmick']",N/A

It is a look at one's man's hollow life coming to fruition with a love of a woman.For those going to see this movie for Will Farrell's typical comedy antics - don't go, as you are bound to be highly disappointed. For the first time, Farrell portrays his character (Harold Crick, the IRS auditor lacking a personal life) without tricks or antics. Farrell succeeds beautifully - his character comes off as kind and lovable, a man trapped in the undeniably typical boredom of our lives. Crick's shortcomings are all of our shortcomings, his heroism stemming from the narrator's guiding hand, rather than from his human nature.Emma Thompson is exceptional as Kay Eiffel, the elusive writer, of eight tragedies, suffering from writer's block and experiencing all the possible ways she can kill her main character. Also notable is Queen Latifah's performance as the assistant, nee publisher's spy.If the movie feels like it's trying to be excessively moral or philosophic at times, that's because it is. But like a novel that falls short in a few places, but is amazing overall, this movie manages to pick up pace and remind you of its good parts, before you get dragged down by its negatives.The ending is satisfyingly American, but in a unique way - it doesn't just make the movie more pleasant, it makes sense.

1041280,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000LXH0AE,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 4]","Stranger Than Fiction is smart without being sarcastic, thoughtful without being dull, uplifting without being saccharine.  It runs a wambly course from goofy through ominous to downright surreal - but never loses track of its humanity.  Viewers will recall Being John Malkovich and Adaptation - but it's better than both, especially the latter.  While those movies were self-consciously clever, pointing incessantly at the man behind the curtain - Stranger Than Fiction plays it straight, and we are the beneficiaries.  Indeed, there is a calm, sweet reserve to this movie, all the performances are understated and nobody is winking at the camera.This film makes me want to see Will Ferrell in more dramatic parts; his touching innocence sets the tone effectively.  Ferrell is surrounded by acting royalty - Emma Thompson is painfully convincing as a neurotic writer, Dustin Hoffman ""channels"" an English professor, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is even more irresistible than usual (saying something).  Indeed, the movie-within-a-movie love story between Ferrell and Gyllenhaal is a real standout - such genuine romanticism, sensitively handled, is rare in film today.  A pleasure seeing Linda Hunt again, however briefly.  Latifah, by contrast - and her character - (a ""fixer"" for stuck writers - in today's publishing industry? - please!) are equally implausible and useless.Marc Foster directs this film with extraordinary confidence, allowing it to develop at a leisurely pace.  It sits neatly between two other films of his, Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland - one a grim descent into the hungry heart of man - the other, a flight into fantasy.  While the premise of Stranger Than Fiction is certainly surreal, the tone is ultimately all too human, it's the personal character we notice, not the gadget.  Of course, the movie is not without its dry humor, especially in its commentary on the relationship between art and responsibility.  Perhaps only an actor of Dustin Hoffman's caliber could explain to Harold - without irony - that he needs to die because it's in the best interests of Kay's book - and after all - the book is a masterpiece.All the people in this film - (unlike so many movie characters) - have ideals and value systems - even the ironically named Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) with her rather loopy view of selective, socially defensible taxation.  As the film develops, their value systems brush against each other but do not collide and crash.  And in the end, even when the film violates its own rules, (the rules we have begrudgingly been persuaded to accept), you will forgive it.  Because by then none of these people are characters at all, they're just nice people, and you want them to win.

But in ""Stranger Than Fiction"", he does something I didn't think possible - he made me care about his character.  In a turn that blends comedy and drama, Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor whose highly regimented life gets turned upside down when he meets Ana (the charming Maggie Gyllenhaal), a baker who is delinquent on her taxes, and starts hearing the voice of his creator, author Karen Eiffel (the perfectly neurotic Emma Thompson) in his head.  A trivial thing, setting his wristwatch, puts Harold in danger of dying, something Miss Eiffel's protagonists do with alarming regularity.  But Harold's awareness puts him on a mission to find out what's going on and more importantly how to avoid getting killed off.Ferrell plays Harold with great balance.  As opposed to movies like ""Elf"" and ""Anchorman"", where he seems to be nothing more than a big goofy kid, Ferrell allows a conflicted man to emerge.  He likes Ana, but refuses cookies from her because they could be considered a bribe.  He enjoys structure in life, but is taken by Ana's carefree attitude.  And though he understands why his death is eminent, he yearns to remain alive.Ferrell, Gylenhaal, and Thompson emerge as the real gems in this movie.  They shine.  The same cannot be said, however, for Dustin Hoffman, who basically phones in his role as literary professor Jules Hilbert, and Queen Latifah, who basically has no role at all as Penny, the assistant sent from the publishing house to make sure Eiffel turns her manuscript in on time.  As some other reviewers have also noted, it is a bit odd that both Eiffel and her creation would exist in the same universe.  It does make things a bit fast and loose.  Despite that, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" proves that the comically-inclined Ferrell can handle a more meaty role.  It's not the Great American Movie, but it is a nice change-of-pace picture for a rainy afternoon.",3,"Not a Will Ferrell fan, but I like this movie",1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,1933,"[""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'made', 'care', 'character', 'turn', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Ferrell', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'IRS', 'auditor', 'highly', 'regimented', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'Ana', 'charming', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'baker', 'who', 'delinquent', 'taxes', 'hearing', 'voice', 'creator', 'author', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'perfectly', 'neurotic', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'head', 'trivial', 'thing', 'setting', 'wristwatch', 'Harold', 'danger', 'dying', 'something', 'Miss', 'Eiffel', 'protagonists', 'do', 'alarming', 'regularity', 'Harold', 'awareness', 'mission', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'avoid', 'getting', 'killed', 'off.Ferrell', 'plays', 'Harold', 'great', 'balance', 'opposed', 'movies', 'Elf', 'Anchorman', 'where', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'big', 'goofy', 'kid', 'Ferrell', 'conflicted', 'man', 'emerge', 'Ana', 'cookies', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'bribe', 'structure', 'life', 'taken', 'Ana', 'carefree', 'attitude', 'why', 'death', 'eminent', 'remain', 'alive.Ferrell', 'Gylenhaal', 'Thompson', 'emerge', 'real', 'gems', 'movie', 'shine', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'however', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'basically', 'phones', 'role', 'literary', 'professor', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'basically', 'role', 'Penny', 'assistant', 'sent', 'publishing', 'house', 'make', 'sure', 'Eiffel', 'manuscript', 'time', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'also', 'noted', 'bit', 'odd', 'Eiffel', 'creation', 'would', 'exist', 'same', 'universe', 'make', 'things', 'bit', 'fast', 'loose', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'comically-inclined', 'Ferrell', 'can', 'handle', 'more', 'meaty', 'role', 'not', 'Great', 'American', 'Movie', 'nice', 'change-of-pace', 'picture', 'rainy', 'afternoon']",N/A

But then Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are also in it, and I like both of them, so I'm game. Besides, the movie was given to me. Now, that might have been because the original owner was disappointed in it, or for some other reason. Ah well, I had time to kill this afternoon.The first ten or fifteen minutes lived up to my expectations, but eventually, it started getting better. By the end, I couldn't help being touched. It's a very, very weird movie, but a thoughtful one in significant spots. And just the thing for a philosophy major.Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent with no life to speak of outside of his job, and his job is pretty darn boring, too. Did I say no life to speak of? Then why is someone speaking of it? Narrating it, actually, in a female voice with an elegant British accent (Emma Thompson). OK, he's hearing voices. After a really mad talk with someone in his office (a resident therapist? Someone from the Department of Human Resources? It's not clear.), he does the rational thing and goes to a therapist. The therapist says it's schizophrenia, but he says the voice isn't telling him to do anything, it's just narrating his life as if he was a character in a book.Turns out he is. He goes to see literature profession Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who decides he's got to find out what sort of book he's in, figure out who the author is, and contact her.Meanwhile, two other things are going on. Karen Eiffel, his author (Emma Thompson), is suffering writer's block and can't figure out how to kill off her main character. Her publisher sends her an assistant (Queen Latifah), who pledges she will help her in any way she can, but she's never yet failed to get an author to complete a work on time. So with unflappable calm, she goes to considerable lengths to help Eiffel, but nothing seems to work.The second thing that's going on is that Harold is falling in love. A rather hippie-like young woman (Maggie Gyllenhaal) runs a bakery shop and has neglected to pay a part of her taxes in protest against the way the government spends it on the military budget. So Harold's job is to audit her records for the last three years, and she presents them to him all jumbled together in a cardboard box. She admits she normally keeps very tidy records, but she did this to annoy him. She thinks she really hates him because he's the IRS. But the author knows, and eventually Harold knows (the voice in his head) that they are falling in love.So Harold must find Karen Eiffel and persuade her to change the book's ending and not kill him off. Does he do it? I can't ruin the outcome for you; that would be cruel.The metaphysics is a little hard to follow, especially when you've had just enough education to follow the lack of logic. I daresay a moderately intelligent teenager with no higher education to cause him or her to think about it too hard would find this a wonderful movie. I'll just say I enjoyed it somewhat, and admired the Eiffel ending, even if Professor Hilbert was a little disappointed.",2,"Stranger, But Still Fiction",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3159,"['know', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'lead', 'then', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'are', 'also', 'like', ""'m"", 'game', 'Besides', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'Now', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'original', 'owner', 'was', 'disappointed', 'other', 'reason', 'Ah', 'well', 'had', 'time', 'kill', 'afternoon.The', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'eventually', 'started', 'getting', 'better', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'touched', 'very', 'very', 'weird', 'movie', 'thoughtful', 'one', 'significant', 'spots', 'just', 'thing', 'philosophy', 'major.Harold', 'Crick', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'IRS', 'agent', 'life', 'speak', 'outside', 'job', 'job', 'pretty', 'darn', 'boring', 'too', 'Did', 'say', 'life', 'speak', 'Then', 'why', 'someone', 'speaking', 'Narrating', 'actually', 'female', 'voice', 'elegant', 'British', 'accent', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'OK', 'hearing', 'voices', 'really', 'mad', 'talk', 'someone', 'office', 'resident', 'therapist', 'Someone', 'Department', 'Human', 'Resources', 'not', 'clear', 'rational', 'thing', 'therapist', 'therapist', 'schizophrenia', 'voice', ""n't"", 'telling', 'do', 'anything', 'just', 'narrating', 'life', 'was', 'character', 'book.Turns', 'out', 'see', 'literature', 'profession', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'got', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'sort', 'book', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'author', 'contact', 'her.Meanwhile', 'two', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'author', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'suffering', 'writer', 'block', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'kill', 'off', 'main', 'character', 'publisher', 'assistant', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'way', 'can', 'never', 'yet', 'failed', 'get', 'author', 'complete', 'work', 'time', 'So', 'unflappable', 'calm', 'considerable', 'lengths', 'help', 'Eiffel', 'nothing', 'work.The', 'second', 'thing', 'going', 'Harold', 'falling', 'love', 'rather', 'hippie-like', 'young', 'woman', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'bakery', 'shop', 'neglected', 'pay', 'part', 'taxes', 'protest', 'way', 'government', 'military', 'budget', 'So', 'Harold', 'job', 'audit', 'records', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'jumbled', 'together', 'cardboard', 'box', 'normally', 'very', 'tidy', 'records', 'did', 'annoy', 'really', 'IRS', 'author', 'eventually', 'Harold', 'knows', 'voice', 'head', 'are', 'falling', 'love.So', 'Harold', 'must', 'find', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'persuade', 'change', 'book', 'ending', 'not', 'kill', 'off', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'outcome', 'would', 'be', 'cruel.The', 'metaphysics', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'especially', 'when', ""'ve"", 'had', 'just', 'enough', 'education', 'follow', 'lack', 'logic', 'daresay', 'moderately', 'intelligent', 'teenager', 'higher', 'education', 'cause', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'would', 'find', 'wonderful', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'somewhat', 'admired', 'Eiffel', 'ending', 'even', 'Professor', 'Hilbert', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed']",N/A

The preview shows all the funny parts, and when seeing Will Ferrell, you expect more of the same in this movie. If you are going to buy this, you must know what you are getting. This is a drama, a drama maybe meant to have a message, to be poignant or to have a greater meeting. Or as I believe, a drama that is pointless and irrelevant.Expect to be amused at certain parts, but never to really laugh. Many will watch this movie thinking it is a comedy, and who is to blame them. Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman all have been stars in comedies, and Will Ferrell is one of the funniest actors around.Every performance in understated, every scene is meloncholy and borders on sad. Queen Latifah is wasted as the assistant to Emma Thompson, the famous author with writer's block. Harold Crick is a character in her novel, nothing more. There is no point, no connection to the viewer to make us care about him. Dustin Hoffman does shine ins his role as the professor trying to help Crick figure out whether is life is a comedy or tragedy. The movie shows the most promise when Crick goes to do an IRS audit of Maggie Gyllenhaal's Ana, and everyone at Ana's bakery turns on the hated ""tax man."" Crick and Ana's relationship shows the most promise in the movie, but in the end, it is discarded as just another plot in the narrated story.In the first few minutes, the gimick of Harold Crick hearing the narration of his life is revealed. Harold can hear a voice in his head. Sounds funny, but since this movie isn't funny, what's the catch? That's the problem with this movie. It exists in a world that doesn't matter. There's no twist at the end to make us care, there's no relevation to explain why Harold can hear a voice in his head. There's basically no reason for this movie.In the end, this might qualify as a rental, but you shouldn't buy this movie without knowing what you are getting yourself into.

Marold""","[6, 8]","`Stranger than Fiction', the umpteenth Will Ferrell comedy of the last three years, directed by Marc Forster, is, as virtually all critics proclaim, by far Ferrell's best effort among all these flicks. I will certainly agree with that, but I offer the notion that the quality of the film is attributable to a greater extent to the writing of Zach Helm, the directing, and the acting of Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson. And, I also give a nod to the value of the cameo appearances by Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce, who are probably seen on film far less than they deserve. The one `above the title' performance which left something to be desired was the role played by Queen Latifah. She did well, but her appearance just disappeared into the background as part of the environment in which Emma Thompson's character, novelist Karen Eiffel moved.I've never been a big fan of Ferrell. I certainly never looked forward to his movies as I would to those starring Jim Carey, Robin Williams, or Bill Murray, or even Dan Ackyroyd for that matter. `Elf' was entertaining but every one of his other recent efforts (I haven't seen `Taladega Nights' yet, and that may change my opinion.) seem to be modest at best. But, he certainly contributes much to this movie, largely by playing against his usual type.One strong argument that the value of the film rests primarily with the writing is in the character actor performance of Dustin Hoffman. The role needed none of the kind of talent he put into films such as `Rainman', `Kramer versus Kramer' or `Midnight Cowboy'. All he needed to do was to play a slightly quirky but highly qualified Literature professor at a major New York City university. While Hoffman executed his business flawlessly, it was very good business and dialogue indeed. Much better, for example than what he had to work with in some other recent comedies such as `Meet the Fokkers'. A similar statement can be made for the performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal. I don't recall seeing her in any other film, but if I did, her performance did nothing to stand out. That is certainly not true in this film.The best demonstration of the film's quality writing comes near the end, where the principals, Ferrell, Thompson, and Hoffman's characters are trying to decide how the story should end. This situation gives away nothing to anyone who has not seen the movie, since the trailer makes it clear that Ferrell's character is itself a character in Emma Thompson's novel in progress. The whole setup for this ending problem shows the very best in dramatic creativity. The real irony is that it fits in perfectly with the question posed by Hoffman to Ferrell to determine whether the novel in which he is a part is a comedy or a tragedy. The problem of the ending is ultimately in the resolution of this question.As great as this movie is, it has one sour piece of business that sticks out like a sore thumb, where a demolition crew begins tearing down Ferrell's apartment building. This too is in the trailer. I won't say why it is a weak piece of business, but I think you will find it so as well.I am not sure I would rate this movie as high as `Ghostbusters' or `Animal House' or `Blazing Saddles', three comedies I enjoy rewatching on a regular basis, but it certainly is worthwhile to own, even if, unlike these others and those from my favorite Woody Allen flicks, it is light on subtitles discovered only on a second or third watching.",5,"Ferrell is good, but writing and directing are even better.",1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,3459,"['Stranger', 'Fiction', 'umpteenth', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'comedy', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'directed', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'virtually', 'critics', 'proclaim', 'far', 'Ferrell', 'best', 'effort', 'flicks', 'will', 'certainly', 'agree', 'offer', 'notion', 'quality', 'film', 'attributable', 'greater', 'extent', 'writing', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'directing', 'acting', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'also', 'give', 'nod', 'value', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'who', 'are', 'probably', 'seen', 'film', 'far', 'less', 'deserve', 'one', 'title', 'performance', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'role', 'played', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'did', 'well', 'appearance', 'just', 'disappeared', 'background', 'part', 'environment', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'character', 'novelist', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'moved.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Ferrell', 'certainly', 'never', 'looked', 'forward', 'movies', 'would', 'starring', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'even', 'Dan', 'Ackyroyd', 'matter', 'Elf', 'was', 'entertaining', 'one', 'other', 'recent', 'efforts', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Taladega', 'Nights', 'yet', 'may', 'change', 'opinion', 'seem', 'be', 'modest', 'best', 'certainly', 'much', 'movie', 'largely', 'playing', 'usual', 'type.One', 'strong', 'argument', 'value', 'film', 'primarily', 'writing', 'character', 'actor', 'performance', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'needed', 'none', 'kind', 'talent', 'put', 'films', 'such', 'Rainman', 'Kramer', 'versus', 'Kramer', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'needed', 'do', 'was', 'play', 'slightly', 'quirky', 'highly', 'qualified', 'Literature', 'professor', 'major', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'university', 'Hoffman', 'executed', 'business', 'flawlessly', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'business', 'dialogue', 'indeed', 'Much', 'better', 'example', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'other', 'recent', 'comedies', 'such', 'Meet', 'Fokkers', 'similar', 'statement', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'performance', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'other', 'film', 'did', 'performance', 'did', 'nothing', 'stand', 'out', 'certainly', 'not', 'true', 'film.The', 'best', 'demonstration', 'film', 'quality', 'writing', 'end', 'where', 'principals', 'Ferrell', 'Thompson', 'Hoffman', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'decide', 'how', 'story', 'should', 'end', 'situation', 'away', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'trailer', 'clear', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'character', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'novel', 'progress', 'whole', 'setup', 'ending', 'problem', 'very', 'best', 'dramatic', 'creativity', 'real', 'irony', 'perfectly', 'question', 'posed', 'Hoffman', 'Ferrell', 'determine', 'novel', 'part', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'problem', 'ending', 'ultimately', 'resolution', 'question.As', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'sour', 'piece', 'business', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'where', 'demolition', 'crew', 'tearing', 'down', 'Ferrell', 'apartment', 'building', 'too', 'trailer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'why', 'weak', 'piece', 'business', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'so', 'well.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'rate', 'movie', 'as', 'high', 'Ghostbusters', 'Animal', 'House', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'three', 'comedies', 'enjoy', 'rewatching', 'regular', 'basis', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'own', 'even', 'others', 'favorite', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'flicks', 'light', 'subtitles', 'discovered', 'only', 'second', 'third', 'watching']",N/A

Myself not being much of a Ferrell champion (although I modestly enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS), I came into STRANGER THAN FICTION wondering if he might try some over-the-top antics or just give another mediocre performance. Amazingly, Ferrell gives a thoughtful and insightful portrayal of a conflicted man who believes he's being followed by a narrating woman's voice.What gives Stranger Than Fiction its emotional heft, too, is its clever script and fine performances by Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal (SHERRYBABY), Dustin Hoffman, and even Queen Latifah.Falling partially into the fantasy category (but only slightly so), the story is of Harold Crick, an IRS agent who one day begins hearing a woman's voice narrating the more mundane portions of his life (""Harold brushed his teeth 32 strokes up and down and 72 side to side""). Initially Harold fears he may be having some sort of mental break. He goes to see a shrink who eventually (and reluctantly) refers him to Professor Jules Hilbert (Hoffman). Some of the most entertaining dialogue is heard here as Hilbert and Crick try to decide whether the voice is narrating his life as a comedy or a tragedy (or maybe some other genre). When Hilbert asks Crick what he does for a living and if there's anyone that might want to hurt him, Crick replies, ""I'm an IRS agent, everyone hates me."" To which Professor Hilbert responds, ""Well that certainly sounds like a comedy to me.""Eventually, Harold discovers who's voice is in his head. It's a novelist named Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), and it appears that Harold is simply a fictional creation of her's that has somehow come to life. Harold races to find Ms. Eiffel before she finishes her novel, strictly because he knows that he plans to kill her (she narrates to him this simple fact, much to Harold's dismay). Once they meet, Ms. Eiffel is somewhat freaked out by the prospect that one of her creations has come to life, and Harold is even more freaked to learn that she's finished the novel (the ending isn't typed yet, but is handwritten and awaiting the plunk! plunk! of the typewriter keys).The ending is bittersweet for both Harold and Emma. Can she change her masterpiece of fiction? Can she not kill Harold and still retain the essence of her work (she's killed off her main protagonist in all her other novels)?Ferrell's soft-spoken tax-man performance was something of a marvel. His witty line deliveries and his tender relationship with Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) goes way beyond anything we've seen from him before. Again, much of this can be attributed to the brilliant script by Zach Helm. But Will Ferrell's performance cannot be denied. He's in almost every shot, proving that he can be a great leading man if given the right set of circumstances. Now let's just hope that he continues on this upward swing.",4,"A ""Wow!""

Emma Thompson!  Linda Hunt!  They also tried to pull in the Black vote with Latifah.  These heavyweights had almost nothing to do.  They are really extras.  This is essentially a one-man show.  And that one man was made a nonentity to show how serious this film is.  I'm surprised this did not win at the Sundance Film Festival.And by the way, the ""brief nudity"" is a bunch of old men taking a shower.

1041305,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B000LXH0AE,Brian Conway,"[0, 0]","Although Stranger Than Fiction looked like it would be a successful enough comedy given the all-star cast, it started garnering the most praise for the bright and refreshing screenwriting brought on board by newcomer Zach Helm. Drawing comparisons to the brilliant mind behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Charlie Kaufman, Zach Helm's script contains a similar philosophical bent and uncertain outlook on life that made Kaufman's works so incredibly popular. Director Marc Forster does an excellent job bringing the many quirks of Zach Helm's story to life and makes the best of his stellar cast. Will Ferrell again demonstrates why he is one of the most sought after actors in Hollywood giving the most serious performance of his career as obsessive-compulsive IRS agent Harold Crick. Maggie Gyllenhaal's excellent turn as Ana Pascal, the radical baker who becomes the object of Crick's affections, should definitely land her more leading roles and make her a star. Emma Thompson's Karen Eiffel, stuck with the moral conundrum of whether to kill off her main character who just happens to be real, and Dustin Hoffman's cold, reluctant scholar round out the cast and raise the film above the typical ""supernatural"" romantic comedy fodder. While the movie doesn't break any new ground per se, it provides a cinematic experience that is simultaneously contemplative and fun, able to tug at the audience's emotions to great effect without being heavy-handed or sappy. Stranger Than Fiction, with its pitch-perfect casting and touching story, provides a great launching platform for an imaginative, new screenwriting talent and effectively establishes Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal as serious talents to watch.",4,Stranger Than Fiction (4 stars),1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,1721,"['Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'successful', 'enough', 'comedy', 'given', 'all-star', 'cast', 'started', 'garnering', 'most', 'praise', 'bright', 'refreshing', 'screenwriting', 'brought', 'board', 'newcomer', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'Drawing', 'comparisons', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'script', 'similar', 'philosophical', 'bent', 'uncertain', 'outlook', 'life', 'made', 'Kaufman', 'works', 'so', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'many', 'quirks', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'story', 'life', 'best', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'again', 'why', 'one', 'most', 'sought', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'giving', 'most', 'serious', 'performance', 'career', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'IRS', 'agent', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'excellent', 'turn', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'radical', 'baker', 'who', 'object', 'Crick', 'affections', 'should', 'definitely', 'land', 'more', 'leading', 'roles', 'make', 'star', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'stuck', 'moral', 'conundrum', 'kill', 'off', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'real', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'cold', 'reluctant', 'scholar', 'round', 'cast', 'raise', 'film', 'typical', 'supernatural', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fodder', 'movie', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'se', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'simultaneously', 'contemplative', 'fun', 'able', 'tug', 'audience', 'emotions', 'great', 'effect', 'being', 'heavy-handed', 'sappy', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'pitch-perfect', 'casting', 'touching', 'story', 'great', 'launching', 'platform', 'imaginative', 'new', 'screenwriting', 'talent', 'effectively', 'establishes', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'serious', 'talents', 'watch']",N/A

1041309,A2LN2AK7HNBI8N,B000LXH0AE,Bruce Varner,"[1, 1]","This movie requires a heaping helping of ""willing suspension of disbelief"".  The plot is way out there, but the intelligent script, seamless directing and strong acting make it work.  This film promises to be a pleasant surprise to you.IRS Agent Harold Crick begins hearing a female voice in his head.  He comes to realize that this voice is narrating his life, in all of its tedium.  One day, the narrative takes a disturbing turn as Crick learns that he is to die.  Crick seeks the help of a psychiatrist, who advises him that he is schizophrenic and in need of medication.  Crick doesn't accept this, and the psychiatrist suggests that he enlist the help of a literature professor, since the narrative in his head sounds like a novel being written.  Crick turns to Professor Jules Hilbert, and together they try to determine who is narrating Crick's life.  As it turns out, the narrative in his head is a novel being written by a famous writer, Karen Eiffel.Subplots add interest and dimension to this film.  Karen Eiffel appears to be quite insane, and her publisher sends an assistant (Penny Escher) to help her finish the book.  Along his journey, Crick meets a quirky bakery owner named Ana Pascal.  Ana becomes the love interest in the film.Exceptional supporting performances help make this movie special.  First is the gifted actress Emma Thompson as novelist Karen Eiffel.  She found just the right level for this character: off balance enough to make the character interesting, yet not over the top.  Ms. Thompson is nicely balanced by Queen Latifah as Penny Escher.  Latifah just gets better and better.  Dustin Hoffman lends his considerable talent as Professor Jules Hilbert.  His performance is understated; showing enough clinical detachment to be a credible academic, but enough compassion for Harold to make him likeable.Maggie Gyllenhaal is Ana Pascal, a role she appears born to play.  She was incredibly cute and fiery.  The script may have made her a bit cliche.  Ana is a former Harvard Law student who discovered a talent for baking, and thus devoted her life to bringing joy to others via baked goods.  Nonetheless, Gyllenhaal found the soul of the character, and gave an honest and engaging performance.  Ana hated Crick initially, after all, he is an IRS Agent who is auditing her.  In the end though, she sees the lonely man within Harold Crick, and her empathetic and nurturing personality take over.  It is through Ana that Harold finally finds happiness and release, starting with his first homemade cookies.Will Ferrell is just brilliant in this film.  I was a Will Ferrell fan long ago when I saw him join with the magnificent Cheri O'Teri in their ""Cheerleader"" sketches on Saturday Night Live.  Since then, he has shown that he has serious talent.  This role may have funny moments, but it is a dramatic role.  This character has an arc with a capital ""A"", and Ferrell hits all the right notes.  There are many wonderful scenes with Ferrell, but I have two favorites.  First is the scene where he tears his apartment up looking for the ""voice"".  People in the theatre laughed, but it was probably from discomfort.  Here was a desparate man afraid that he is going insane.  I loved the long scene he had with Gyllenhaal where they fell in love.  To attempt to seduce a girl was a big step for Harold.  His nerves and sweetness were charming.  That night, Harold Crick became a full man.  Ferrell and Gyllenhaal were unbeatable scene partners.This is a creative, intelligent film with comedy, drama, and a lot of heart.  It features a stellar cast on top of their games.Highly recommended.",5,Ferrell Shines,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,3623,"['movie', 'heaping', 'helping', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'plot', 'way', 'there', 'intelligent', 'script', 'seamless', 'directing', 'strong', 'acting', 'make', 'work', 'film', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'you.IRS', 'Agent', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'hearing', 'female', 'voice', 'head', 'realize', 'voice', 'narrating', 'life', 'tedium', 'One', 'day', 'narrative', 'disturbing', 'turn', 'Crick', 'die', 'Crick', 'help', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'schizophrenic', 'need', 'medication', 'Crick', ""n't"", 'accept', 'psychiatrist', 'help', 'literature', 'professor', 'narrative', 'head', 'novel', 'being', 'written', 'Crick', 'Professor', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'together', 'try', 'determine', 'who', 'narrating', 'Crick', 'life', 'out', 'narrative', 'head', 'novel', 'being', 'written', 'famous', 'writer', 'Karen', 'Eiffel.Subplots', 'add', 'interest', 'dimension', 'film', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'be', 'quite', 'insane', 'publisher', 'assistant', 'Penny', 'Escher', 'help', 'finish', 'book', 'journey', 'Crick', 'quirky', 'bakery', 'owner', 'named', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Ana', 'love', 'interest', 'film.Exceptional', 'supporting', 'performances', 'help', 'make', 'movie', 'special', 'First', 'gifted', 'actress', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'novelist', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'found', 'just', 'right', 'level', 'character', 'balance', 'enough', 'make', 'character', 'interesting', 'yet', 'not', 'top', 'Ms.', 'Thompson', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Penny', 'Escher', 'Latifah', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'considerable', 'talent', 'Professor', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'performance', 'understated', 'showing', 'enough', 'clinical', 'detachment', 'be', 'credible', 'academic', 'enough', 'compassion', 'Harold', 'make', 'likeable.Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'role', 'born', 'play', 'was', 'incredibly', 'cute', 'fiery', 'script', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'bit', 'cliche', 'Ana', 'former', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'student', 'who', 'discovered', 'talent', 'baking', 'thus', 'devoted', 'life', 'bringing', 'joy', 'others', 'baked', 'goods', 'Nonetheless', 'Gyllenhaal', 'found', 'soul', 'character', 'gave', 'honest', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Ana', 'hated', 'Crick', 'initially', 'IRS', 'Agent', 'who', 'auditing', 'end', 'lonely', 'man', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'empathetic', 'nurturing', 'personality', 'take', 'Ana', 'Harold', 'finally', 'happiness', 'release', 'starting', 'first', 'homemade', 'cookies.Will', 'Ferrell', 'just', 'brilliant', 'film', 'was', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'fan', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'saw', 'join', 'magnificent', 'Cheri', ""O'Teri"", 'Cheerleader', 'sketches', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'then', 'shown', 'serious', 'talent', 'role', 'may', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'dramatic', 'role', 'character', 'arc', 'capital', 'A', 'Ferrell', 'right', 'notes', 'are', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'Ferrell', 'have', 'two', 'favorites', 'First', 'scene', 'where', 'apartment', 'up', 'looking', 'voice', 'People', 'theatre', 'laughed', 'was', 'probably', 'discomfort', 'Here', 'was', 'desparate', 'man', 'afraid', 'going', 'insane', 'loved', 'long', 'scene', 'had', 'Gyllenhaal', 'where', 'fell', 'love', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'girl', 'was', 'big', 'step', 'Harold', 'nerves', 'sweetness', 'were', 'charming', 'night', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'became', 'full', 'man', 'Ferrell', 'Gyllenhaal', 'were', 'unbeatable', 'scene', 'partners.This', 'creative', 'intelligent', 'film', 'comedy', 'drama', 'lot', 'heart', 'stellar', 'cast', 'top', 'games.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

The process that he goes through to help out Will's character is ridiculous yet so logical.  Get this.  Since Will is in some sort of literature (or so he says) Dustin uses his literary expertise to help figure out the genre of the literature thus figuring out how his story/life will unfold.

However, the brilliant and heart-warmingly *normal* man he portrays in this film is a testament to his versatility as an actor!Quick Synopsis: Harold Crick is an IRS agent who leads a very boringly predictable life each and every day. He counts out everything, from brush strokes while he's brushing his teeth, to how many steps it takes him to get to work. What Harold didn't expect in his mundane existance was to one day start hearing a woman's voice in his head begin to narrate his life. As he frantically tries to figure out what is going on, the woman's voice (belonging to a local author who is known for her tragic stories) say in a nonchalant voice that Harold Crick was going to die.This film is engaging and imaginative. It is a far cry from Will Ferrell's usual role, but he manages to bring a vulnerability and a very real personality to his character. He performs in a sense that not many thought he was capable of, and gives Harold Crick a down-to-earth and completely believable vibe. His character reacts in the same way one might imagine *anyone* would react in this insane situation, and he navigates the strange plotline with ease.Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal each turn in equally unique and 'right-on-the-money' performances, and I would expect nothing less from any of them, but this film is still awe inspiring due to Ferell's turn as Harold Crick.While the idea that one could hear another person's voice in their own head, and not only have zero control over their fate, but to have to realize that no matter what you do, you either can't change the outcome or you shouldn't change the outcome, is an insane and completely unplausible concept. However...it also completely works for this film. I know that none of us watch a movie expecting to see anything that would happen in real life (that would be boring), but ""Stranger than Fiction"" takes an average man in need of a life change, and gives it to him in a uniquely thinking-outside-the-box sort of way. I think most of us fear change, and often fear the uncertainty in life itself, and these fears manifest to their fullest in Harold Crick's strict and rigidly controlled lifestyle that can't really be called living. He does the same thing every day. He eats the same, takes his breaks at the exact same time, walks the exact same number of steps to the bus stop, and goes to bed at the exact same time. When time begins to work against him, and his life spirals out of his control with the emergence of this voice inside his head, he actually begins *living* for the first time. While there is an air of doom ahead of him, he tries to find out how and why, while at the same time altering his rigid routine to include things he actually enjoys, and to take a couple risks in life, such as asking out the beautiful woman he is falling in love with, even with the fear of rejection.The cinematography and set design in this film work beautifully together. The appearance of numbers to help illustrate Harold's numeral obsession, and the bland whiteness of the author's walls indicate a blank canvas on which to create a masterpiece of fiction...that just happens to turn out to be fact. Harold's apartment consists of pale and boring yellows and greens, with little or no decoration. It all flows and works together, and it's interesting to relate it all to the mood and growth of Ferrell's character.Bottom line, this is a must see. It's orignal and uniquely interesting. A word of caution -- the film is *not* going to explain how Harold is hearing the author's voice in his head, or how everything the author writes on her little typewriter comes true, but if you can ignore these burning questions, you will enjoy this story for what it is, and not what you might want it to be.",4,Brilliantly different and thoroughly engaging.

1041318,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,B000LXH0AE,Classic Movie watcher,"[2, 2]","Will Ferrell portrays well an IRS auditor Harold Click who has led a monotonous and uneventful life. He barely smiles, meets friends and attends no social gatherings. Emma Thompson's voice in his head is an excellent narrative, an indispensable thread that links the plot together. Only four more main characters appear in the movie - the baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) later turned his love interest, the literary professor (Dustin Hoffman) who offered professional help to seek the voice's identity, the author (Emma Thompson) who suffered from writer's block for nearly 10 years and the assistant from the publisher (Queen Latifah) who came to her rescue.The fact that the director focused only around the boring life of Harold Click proved to be a refreshing perspective. No way that everyone could have tons of friends, family support and affluent life. Every main character leads a simple life. Maggie Gyllenhaal, the baker, simply makes cookies, cakes and gives away generously to the needy. Dustin Hoffman works from an office with a breathtaking view. At one point, he looked through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Emma Thompson is a neurotic, unsocial author living in an apartment with minimalist design. And Queen Latifah looks a confident and caring professional who has promised to help Emma Thompson end her novel quietly and efficiently. (This means killing the character Harold Click the best way possible.)Looking back, I like the movie for its subtle tone, excellent cinematography of the city, portrayal of relationships just as it is without stereotyping. The life of Harold Click is boring but the narration of his life is not. Instead I can grow to like him and wish him all the best. What I learn from this movie - one can empathize and be a good person without saying too much, one can be in the spotlight of the movie without being a hero credited with big deeds, good look and in an important situation. As Harold Click said in the movie, there are mundane moments and significant moments in life. And in this movie, the baker, the author, the assistant, the professor and Harold Click himself have done some seemingly insignificant things that have made significant changes in other peoples' lives.

While that film was basically a typical Adam Sandler vehicle for fart and dog-humping-stuff jokes, this film has more of an accessible tone but a heart as well. It's cheesy to say since there's always films that ""have a heart"" even when they're just soulless moneysucking fodder. Much ado had been talked about for Will Ferrell's first dramatic role and while I wouldn't say he's the best performance, he's probably the most surprising and the whole film taken as a whole is a good date rental.Harold Crick is a IRS agent with straight routines: brushes his teeth a specific amount of times and walks to the bus in specific number of steps. But then he notices that what he's doing is being narrated by a voice in his head. Voice turns out to be troubled author Kay Eiffel who's writing her latest book. With the help of a literature professor, Harold has to locate Kay before she writes her ending: Harold's death.While Ferrell does a commendable job, strangely it's Emma Thompson who stole the show for me. Troubled but having an odd sense of humor as well, including one scene where she needs inspiration from ""surely dead"" people. We also have Dustin Hoffman, cutie Maggie Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah as Kay's assistant and Tony Hale (Buster from Arrested Development) as Harold's friend, Dave. Even Amadeus himself, Tom Hulce, shows up as a cameo. Unlike certain films that try to stock as much name actors as possible (coughs*Oceans Eleven*coughs), these work as characters and don't distract anyone.Too bad the extra features are kind of lame. These are basically ""this was so great to work on, he's so talented"" interviews and you don't really get any insight into making it, it's just a bunch of people talking about how cool the movie is. One thing I should mention is that this isn't really one of those knee-slapper comedies where there's joke after another. Some comedies have that kind of go-for-broke quality where they will use whatever they can to make sure the audience laughs while this is more geared to a more relaxed crowd that likes a couple funny parts thrown in.I don't know if it's worth buying but if you've got a special someone, it'd make a great date movie.

Emma Thomposon plays an accomplished writer who has writers block.  She is trying to figure out how to kill Harold the main character in her story who also happens to be Will Ferrell.  Dustin Hoffman is also in the cast.  He plays a wonderful character who is an ecentric Professor of Literature.  The beautiful and talented Maggie Gyllenhaal is Harold's love interest who thinks he is just the most innocent wonderful person.  The chemistry between the two is magnetic.  A wonderful scene where he is playing the guitar singing the only song he knows as she is cleaning the kitchen.  She is drawn to the song and ends up mouthing the words.  Obviously a song that she knows and also moves her.  To round off this great cast, Queen Latifah plays the assistant to Emma Thompson who is there to help her with her writers block.A great story, great cast and a wonderful performances by the talented Will Ferrell and the entire cast.",5,Stranger Than Fiction,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,1412,"['am', 'always', 'been', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'fan', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'innocence', 'sorts', 'When', 'saw', 'ELF', ""could't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'being', 'able', 'pull', 'role', 'off.The', 'same', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'fantastic', 'story', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'great', 'IRS', 'Agent', 'who', 'very', 'boring', 'life', 'hearing', 'voice', 'Not', 'just', 'voice', 'voice', 'narrating', 'life', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Emma', 'Thomposon', 'accomplished', 'writer', 'who', 'writers', 'block', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'kill', 'Harold', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'also', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'character', 'who', 'ecentric', 'Professor', 'Literature', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Harold', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'just', 'most', 'innocent', 'wonderful', 'person', 'chemistry', 'two', 'magnetic', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'where', 'playing', 'guitar', 'singing', 'only', 'song', 'cleaning', 'kitchen', 'drawn', 'song', 'up', 'mouthing', 'words', 'Obviously', 'song', 'also', 'round', 'off', 'great', 'cast', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'assistant', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'there', 'help', 'writers', 'block.A', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'talented', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'entire', 'cast']",N/A

What would it feel like to know that your actions were not the result of individual thought but were born of an author's imagination? How would you react if you knew that all of your pains and problems were no more than the whims of an eccentric writer? What if your fate, your world, even your personality were just the invention of another person? And what if your life was about to end and you knew, but had no control other than to accept the circumstances? This is the reality of Harold Crick.It's not an easy thing to do, telling a story within a story, but in the hands of talented director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball&Finding Neverland) the end result is both profound and entertaining. Will Ferrell assumes the identity of Harold Crick, an obsessive compulsive and pathetically predictable IRS agent, whose world is turned upside down when he begins to hear a woman's voice narrating his daily activities. He discovers that his death is approaching and this knowledge brings new meaning into his neat and tidy life.With a cleverly bizarre premise like this, you know that there will be a host of quirky but lovable characters and if this film had been directed by anyone else, these characters might have become two-dimensional and dull. But Stranger Than Fiction has a wonderful cast including Emma Thompson as Karen Eiffel, the narrator and writer who decides Harold's fate, Maggie Gyllenhaal as an anarchistic yet friendly baker, Dustin Hoffman as a literary expert who must help Harold decipher the purpose of his life and his story, and Queen Latifah who plays a no-nonsense author's assistant determined to help Karen Eiffel overcome her writer's block. Now this film could easily have become over-the-top and heavy handed but just avoids to do so. It maintains a tricky balance of comedy and tragedy, of intellect and emotion. And this can be attributed to its amazing cast and its confident director. It's not a perfect film (I've never seen one and I don't think they exist) but it is extremely enjoyable.Also recommended:The GraduateHarold and MaudeDanny DeckchairEternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindI Heart HuckabeesLars and the Real Girl",4,Harold Crick Was an Ordinary Man Until...,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,2260,"['Imagine', 'whole', 'life', 'entire', 'existence', 'was', 'creation', 'human', 'being', 'mind', 'What', 'would', 'feel', 'know', 'actions', 'were', 'not', 'result', 'individual', 'thought', 'were', 'born', 'author', 'imagination', 'How', 'would', 'react', 'knew', 'pains', 'problems', 'were', 'more', 'whims', 'eccentric', 'writer', 'What', 'fate', 'world', 'even', 'personality', 'were', 'just', 'invention', 'person', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'end', 'knew', 'had', 'control', 'other', 'accept', 'circumstances', 'reality', 'Harold', 'Crick.It', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'telling', 'story', 'story', 'hands', 'talented', 'director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'end', 'result', 'profound', 'entertaining', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'identity', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'pathetically', 'predictable', 'IRS', 'agent', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'hear', 'woman', 'voice', 'narrating', 'daily', 'activities', 'death', 'approaching', 'knowledge', 'new', 'meaning', 'neat', 'tidy', 'life.With', 'cleverly', 'bizarre', 'premise', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'host', 'quirky', 'lovable', 'characters', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'anyone', 'else', 'characters', 'might', 'have', 'become', 'two-dimensional', 'dull', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'including', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'narrator', 'writer', 'who', 'Harold', 'fate', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'anarchistic', 'yet', 'friendly', 'baker', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'literary', 'expert', 'who', 'must', 'help', 'Harold', 'decipher', 'purpose', 'life', 'story', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'no-nonsense', 'author', 'assistant', 'determined', 'help', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'overcome', 'writer', 'block', 'Now', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'over-the-top', 'heavy', 'handed', 'just', 'avoids', 'do', 'so', 'tricky', 'balance', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'intellect', 'emotion', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'amazing', 'cast', 'confident', 'director', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'exist', 'extremely', 'enjoyable.Also', 'recommended', 'GraduateHarold', 'MaudeDanny', 'DeckchairEternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'MindI', 'Heart', 'HuckabeesLars', 'Real', 'Girl']",N/A

1041325,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000LXH0AE,Craig Matteson,"[2, 2]","I liked this movie very much and especially enjoyed seeing Will Ferrell as something other than just another variety of buffoon.  Sure, he is good in those roles and quite funny, but here he takes the clown off and brings us a new range of character with his portrayal Harold Crick.Crick is an IRS auditor who lives a very precise and standardized life.  He seems oblivious to why he is doing this or that by living this way he is avoiding his life.  Underneath somewhere we do learn that he has some awareness of his condition and does have real human emotions about such awful tedium, but he has them bottle up in something like the containers used to transport nuclear waste.All this changes when he begins to hear a voice narrating his life.  This makes his routine very difficult.  His associates at the IRS notice the problem.  Oh, and the counselor at the IRS is Tom Hulce looking a lot like Richard Dreyfuss.  He gets what should be a simple auditing assignment to a very small bakery and meets a very antagonistic Ana Pascal (played by the wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal).After rejecting the recommendation of a psychiatrist to get medicated, he ends up seeking the help of a professor of literature, Jules Hilbert (in a fine performance by Dustin Hoffman).I don't want to go into any more of the plot because it is all about the voice and his life.  While some folks complain about plots that aren't naturalistic and other complain that Zach Helm is trying to rip off Charlie Kaufman, I don't think so.  Kaufman is too experimental to have a point as direct as is made in this movie.  And if you really just look at the story from a literary point of view, it makes complete sense.  Many literary critics, Harold Bloom for one, keep talking about how our lives are rooted in literature, that we are creations of great writers in the past whose world views we have adopted and merely suppose them to be our own sense of the world.Whether you accept this or not, it makes sense to wonder what a literary creation would think of his world if he could, wouldn't it?

1041327,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B000LXH0AE,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 2]","Marc Forster is making a name for himself with such major films as Monsters Ball and Finding Neverland.  In Stranger Than Fiction, he takes a plot that could have been suggested by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) and creates a world that suggests fantasy yet is grounded in what we call reality.  It is an inventive plot made convincing by sensitive direction and fine performances by its stars, Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal.IRS civil servant Harold Crick (Ferrell) leads a regimented, mundane existence, which consists of an orderly routine guided by his punctual wristwatch.  His solitary life becomes upset by the presence of a female voice that seems to be narrating his every move.  His daily rituals are altered and, when he audits a baker, a free spirited activist named Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), he meets stiff resistance and hostility.  Compelled to find the answers to the mysterious voice, he first consults the company shrink (Tom Hulce in a welcome, yet short performance), a therapist (Linda Hunt in too brief a role), and finally a literary professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman in bravura support).  It is with Dr. Hilbert that Harold finds hope and a methodology to solve the puzzle of the narrative voice.At the same time, famed author, Kay Eiffel, is trying to finish her latest novel about a taxman who is hearing voices.  When she struggles to find a suitable end for her character (all her principal characters are killed off in her books), a publisher's assistant arrives in the name of Penny Escher (Queen Latifah wasted in a pedestrian part).  Harold visits Ana for a followup audit and becomes smitten and attracted by her perky charm.  As he audits her maze of disorganized tax documents, Ana begins to feel bad for the poor soul and gives him a sort of peace offering of homemade cookies, and thus their relationship grows.  His visits with Dr. Hilbert begin to narrow the possible sources of his affliction until one day he stumbles on the answer and in doing so, he realizes that his life is predestined.  His life out of kilter, Harold begins to break out of his quiet shell and experience life's interesting aspects.  Kay's mental block soon gives way and when she finishes her novel and is ready to type the manuscript, Harold tracks her down using some creative ingenuity. She too has realized some incredible connection between her story and his real life. When Dr. Hilbert reads the final manuscript, his conclusions are a stunner to Harold.  How Harold and Kay respond to this is what winds the film to a tense conclusion.The dialogue is funny at times and always interesting.  There are traces of other films like Groundhog Day, Field of Dreams or an episode of The X Files that will come to mind.  The movie touches on the concepts of fate and destiny without being too obvious-perhaps it should have been more obvious come to think of it.  Do we control our lives or are we part of some other plan or manuscript (like The Matrix)?  The concept of `cause and effect' and of randomness figures heavily in the overall theme of the film.Harold is a sort of distant cousin to Forrest Gump complete with an innocent perspective on life.  His character works because his persona changes throughout the film and when he faces his fears and desires head on, his life begins to move forward in ways he never imagined.  He is starting to live life.  And when he finds out his fate, he makes a big decision that brings his character full circle.Harold's watch becomes a kind of supporting character, as it serves as a catalyst for him and Ana to bond, but it is used too sparingly at times.  There is a slight feeling that the filmmakers did not have enough confidence in the fantasy part to match the reality which is well done.  Too bad, as the film steadily progresses in its story and etches some interesting characters.  It also gets a bit confusing as to why a couple of characters pop in and out briefly, and you know it's for some reason that becomes more evident by the climax.The movie is at its best when Harold warms up to Ana, and the two begin a courtship that is affecting and genuine.  In this, Gyllenhaal and Ferrell shine.  Will Ferrell has always been a dependable comic from his Saturday Night Live years, but here, he successfully portrays a shy, passive man complete with blank expressions and awkward body language.  Hoffman has his most significant role in years since his brief but memorable turn in Foster's previous Finding Neverland.  And Gyllenhaal proves adept as a romantic lead.Forster is becoming a modern day teller of fables.  In Stranger Than Fiction he spins a simple tale (written by Zach Helm) of love, life, and fate with a moral that is redemptive and refreshing.  Not everyone will connect with this film; I suspect that the romantics out there will.",4,STRANGER THAN FICTION -Life as Narrative,1162771200,"11 6, 2006",2006,4851,"['Marc', 'Forster', 'making', 'name', 'such', 'major', 'films', 'Monsters', 'Ball', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'suggested', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'world', 'fantasy', 'yet', 'grounded', 'what', 'call', 'reality', 'inventive', 'plot', 'made', 'convincing', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'fine', 'performances', 'stars', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal.IRS', 'civil', 'servant', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Ferrell', 'regimented', 'mundane', 'existence', 'orderly', 'routine', 'guided', 'punctual', 'wristwatch', 'solitary', 'life', 'becomes', 'upset', 'presence', 'female', 'voice', 'be', 'narrating', 'move', 'daily', 'rituals', 'are', 'altered', 'when', 'baker', 'free', 'spirited', 'activist', 'named', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Gyllenhaal', 'stiff', 'resistance', 'hostility', 'Compelled', 'find', 'answers', 'mysterious', 'voice', 'first', 'consults', 'company', 'shrink', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'welcome', 'yet', 'short', 'performance', 'therapist', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'too', 'brief', 'role', 'finally', 'literary', 'professor', 'Dr.', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'bravura', 'support', 'Dr.', 'Hilbert', 'Harold', 'hope', 'methodology', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'narrative', 'voice.At', 'same', 'time', 'famed', 'author', 'Kay', 'Eiffel', 'trying', 'finish', 'latest', 'novel', 'taxman', 'who', 'hearing', 'voices', 'When', 'find', 'suitable', 'end', 'character', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'books', 'publisher', 'assistant', 'name', 'Penny', 'Escher', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'wasted', 'pedestrian', 'part', 'visits', 'Ana', 'followup', 'audit', 'becomes', 'smitten', 'attracted', 'perky', 'charm', 'maze', 'disorganized', 'tax', 'documents', 'Ana', 'feel', 'bad', 'poor', 'soul', 'sort', 'peace', 'offering', 'homemade', 'cookies', 'thus', 'relationship', 'grows', 'visits', 'Dr.', 'Hilbert', 'begin', 'narrow', 'possible', 'sources', 'affliction', 'one', 'day', 'answer', 'doing', 'so', 'life', 'predestined', 'life', 'kilter', 'Harold', 'break', 'quiet', 'shell', 'experience', 'life', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'Kay', 'mental', 'block', 'soon', 'way', 'when', 'novel', 'ready', 'type', 'manuscript', 'Harold', 'down', 'using', 'creative', 'ingenuity', 'too', 'realized', 'incredible', 'connection', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Hilbert', 'final', 'manuscript', 'conclusions', 'are', 'stunner', 'Harold', 'How', 'Harold', 'Kay', 'respond', 'film', 'tense', 'conclusion.The', 'dialogue', 'funny', 'times', 'always', 'interesting', 'are', 'traces', 'other', 'films', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'episode', 'X', 'Files', 'will', 'come', 'mind', 'movie', 'touches', 'concepts', 'fate', 'destiny', 'being', 'too', 'obvious-perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'obvious', 'come', 'think', 'Do', 'control', 'lives', 'are', 'part', 'other', 'plan', 'manuscript', 'Matrix', 'concept', 'cause', 'effect', 'randomness', 'figures', 'heavily', 'overall', 'theme', 'film.Harold', 'sort', 'distant', 'cousin', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'complete', 'innocent', 'perspective', 'life', 'character', 'persona', 'changes', 'film', 'when', 'fears', 'desires', 'head', 'life', 'move', 'forward', 'ways', 'never', 'imagined', 'starting', 'live', 'life', 'when', 'out', 'fate', 'big', 'decision', 'character', 'full', 'circle.Harold', 'watch', 'kind', 'supporting', 'character', 'catalyst', 'Ana', 'bond', 'used', 'too', 'sparingly', 'times', 'slight', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'confidence', 'fantasy', 'part', 'match', 'reality', 'well', 'done', 'Too', 'bad', 'film', 'steadily', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'also', 'bit', 'confusing', 'why', 'couple', 'characters', 'pop', 'briefly', 'know', 'reason', 'more', 'evident', 'climax.The', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'Harold', 'up', 'Ana', 'two', 'begin', 'courtship', 'affecting', 'genuine', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Ferrell', 'shine', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'always', 'been', 'dependable', 'comic', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'years', 'here', 'successfully', 'shy', 'passive', 'man', 'complete', 'blank', 'expressions', 'awkward', 'body', 'language', 'Hoffman', 'most', 'significant', 'role', 'years', 'brief', 'memorable', 'turn', 'Foster', 'previous', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Gyllenhaal', 'adept', 'romantic', 'lead.Forster', 'becoming', 'modern', 'day', 'teller', 'fables', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'simple', 'tale', 'written', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'love', 'life', 'fate', 'moral', 'redemptive', 'refreshing', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'connect', 'film', 'suspect', 'romantics', 'out', 'there', 'will']",N/A
1041328,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B000LXH0AE,Daddy,"[0, 0]","This is an intriguing story, done very well... though with a slightly in satisfying ending (in my opinion).  The concept is fairly unique; a mild-mannered man learns that he is the character of an author's new novel, and the author narrates his life - which he actually hears her doing.  Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor.  Ferrell's performance is uniquely somber, down-to-earth and sympathetic.  Despite being promoted or labeled as a comedy, I see this movie as more of a drama with comedic overtones. Emma Thompson plays the author, Karen Eiffel.  Thompson is superb as the reclusive, intense and somewhat depressed author, living alone, as she contemplates and imagines scenarios of all types of death, for her book.  Queen Latifah does a very nice portrayal of the assistant hired by Eiffel's publisher, trying to help her finish the novel.  Dustin Hoffman gives his usual excellent flair as Literature Professor Jules Hilbert, who tries to help Harold find out why he's a character in a story, and who the author is.  Linda Hunt also adds a nice portrayal in a bit part as one of the psychologist Harold talks to.  The beginning of the movie is wrought with animated graphic measurements (similar to the kind used in the opening credits to Flubber and Bicentennial Man).  These animated graphics add a touch of surrealism to the story, designed to show Harold's focus on numbers and statistics.  They continue to a lessening degree throughout the movie, with just enough scarcity so as not to distract from the scenes.  Harold's lifestyle changes dramatically once he learns that he is going to die - as he hears the narration of his impending death.  There are many humorous scenes and moments; like when a wrecking crew knocks out the wall of Harold's apartment, or whenever Harold tries to question the ""voice"".  The story is played out well and culminates well. However, the actual ending seems a bit lame.  It could have had more punch if the ending followed the course of the premise a little better.

I'm not saying that `Happy Feet' is a bad movie, I can't say that for I have not seen it, but I doubt I will like it this much,  I have been waiting to see `Stranger than Fiction' for a few months now, being a huge fan of 2004's `Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind' as well as being a huge fan of Will Ferrell and hearing all the buzz, strong buzz, not only of script but of concept and overall quality of film I just couldn't resist.The story of Harold Crick (Ferrell) is a simple one.  He's an IRS agent who has done nothing in his life he's particularly fond of.  He lives for his work and his work alone.  He has no friends besides Dave (Tony Hale) ""this guy I work with"" who he barely speaks with and never on a social level.  He lives alone, eats alone, sleeps alone...that is until a woman's voice takes up residence inside his head.  He begins to hear her narrating his life, his decisions, his feelings and intimate thoughts and he begins to go slowly insane.  And then she announces that he is soon going to die.  Harold is now on edge, worried that his life is soon to end, and so he begins to seek help from anyone who will give it.This help comes in the form of Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), a literary professor determined to find out whether Harold is living in a tragedy or a comedy.  Beginning with a series of pointless questions (as in ""do you have superpowers"") Jules slowly begins to dwindle down the possibilities and comes up with a list of authors he believes could be writing the story of his life.  But when he finds out it is not one of the few he suggested but is in fact his idol Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) Jules is alarmed for Karen always kills off her hero, always.Upon realizing his days are numbered Harold decides to truly live his life.  He learns to play guitar, which he later shows us by struggling through a rendition of `Whole Wide World'.  He also begins to pursue a relationship with a beautiful young baker named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a woman who initially despised him but has grown to love him for the man he is underneath.  On the other hand we have Karen who is suffering from an extreme case of writers block, for she just can't figure out `how' she will kill Harold.  To help, her publishers send her Penny Escher (Queen Latifah), a writer's assistant who is determined to help her `kill' Harold.Thanks in large part to the impressive cast, `Stranger than Fiction' delivers an original one of a kind comedy that is sure to please any fan of the genre.  Will Ferrell performs against type proving that he's more than just a big kid; he can be serious and yet still hold out attention.  Unlike some viewers and critics I found him far from boring.  Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah were a perfect team, working off of each other brilliantly, and Emma does stand out here as the most memorable character.  Maggie has just had a killer year this year, and while her Ana isn't as brilliant as her Sherry (from `Sherrybaby') or her Alison (from `World Trade Center') she still delivers a sweet, funny and believable love interest for Harold, and believe it or not Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal have great chemistry.If you're looking for a smart and original comedy, one that will make you laugh and make you smile and, in the long run, really make you think then this is the movie for you.  It may present the same ""seize the day"", ""live for now"", ""take the risks your afraid to take"" type message that a lot of movies today are presenting, but `Stranger than Fiction' does so with a unique twist that is all it's own, and in that way it seems original even if the moral is not.",5,"""Well, that sounds like a comedy!""",1164672000,"11 28, 2006",2006,3898,"['what', 'comedy', 'smart', 'fresh', 'true', 'delight', 'was', 'completely', 'content', 'walking', 'theater', 'last', 'Saturday', 'night', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'decision', 'skip', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'take', 'chance', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'comedy', 'was', 'justified', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'bad', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'doubt', 'will', 'like', 'much', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'few', 'months', 'now', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', '2004', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'hearing', 'buzz', 'strong', 'buzz', 'not', 'only', 'script', 'concept', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist.The', 'story', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Ferrell', 'simple', 'one', 'IRS', 'agent', 'who', 'done', 'nothing', 'life', 'particularly', 'fond', 'work', 'work', 'alone', 'friends', 'besides', 'Dave', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'guy', 'work', 'who', 'barely', 'never', 'social', 'level', 'alone', 'alone', 'sleeps', 'alone', 'woman', 'voice', 'up', 'residence', 'head', 'hear', 'narrating', 'life', 'decisions', 'feelings', 'intimate', 'thoughts', 'go', 'slowly', 'insane', 'then', 'soon', 'going', 'die', 'Harold', 'now', 'edge', 'worried', 'life', 'soon', 'end', 'so', 'seek', 'help', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'it.This', 'help', 'form', 'Dr.', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'literary', 'professor', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'Harold', 'living', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'Beginning', 'series', 'pointless', 'questions', 'do', 'have', 'superpowers', 'Jules', 'slowly', 'dwindle', 'down', 'possibilities', 'up', 'list', 'authors', 'could', 'be', 'writing', 'story', 'life', 'when', 'not', 'one', 'few', 'suggested', 'fact', 'idol', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Jules', 'alarmed', 'Karen', 'always', 'off', 'hero', 'realizing', 'days', 'are', 'numbered', 'Harold', 'truly', 'live', 'life', 'play', 'guitar', 'later', 'struggling', 'rendition', 'Whole', 'Wide', 'World', 'also', 'pursue', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'young', 'baker', 'named', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'woman', 'who', 'initially', 'despised', 'grown', 'love', 'man', 'underneath', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'Karen', 'who', 'suffering', 'extreme', 'case', 'writers', 'block', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'will', 'kill', 'Harold', 'help', 'publishers', 'send', 'Penny', 'Escher', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'writer', 'assistant', 'who', 'determined', 'help', 'kill', 'Harold.Thanks', 'large', 'part', 'impressive', 'cast', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'delivers', 'original', 'one', 'kind', 'comedy', 'sure', 'please', 'fan', 'genre', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'performs', 'type', 'proving', 'more', 'just', 'big', 'kid', 'can', 'be', 'serious', 'yet', 'still', 'hold', 'out', 'attention', 'viewers', 'critics', 'found', 'far', 'boring', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'were', 'perfect', 'team', 'working', 'other', 'brilliantly', 'Emma', 'stand', 'out', 'here', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'Maggie', 'just', 'had', 'killer', 'year', 'year', 'Ana', ""n't"", 'as', 'brilliant', 'Sherry', 'Sherrybaby', 'Alison', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'still', 'sweet', 'funny', 'believable', 'love', 'interest', 'Harold', 'believe', 'not', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'smart', 'original', 'comedy', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'make', 'smile', 'long', 'run', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'present', 'same', 'seize', 'day', 'live', 'now', 'take', 'risks', 'afraid', 'take', 'type', 'message', 'lot', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'presenting', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'so', 'unique', 'twist', 'own', 'way', 'original', 'even', 'moral', 'not']",N/A

Clendenin,"[0, 4]","Harold Crick's (Will Ferrell) compulsively ordered and very lonely life is ruled by numbers, which makes sense because he is an IRS auditor. He brushes his teeth the same number of strokes each day, and knows exactly how many steps that he walks to the bus stop. A narrator voice-over gives us a running commentary, and soon we realize that the narrator is in fact Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a novelist who is writing the story of Harold's life and struggling to end the novel, and Crick's life, in a fitting way. His real life is her novel's plot. Harold also starts to hear Eiffel's voices in his head, and so he discovers that his life is unfinished and awaits her literary decisions as well as his personal choices. As his life approaches death Harold also falls for a delightfully quirky woman named Ana, who is his opposite--she sports tattoos and dropped out of Harvard Law School because she wanted to open a bakery. This is a very clever comedy that also stars Dustin Hoffman as a literature professor who functions as Crick's ""therapist"" to figure out the narrative plot of his life and the likely choices that Eiffel might make, and Queen Latifah as the novelist's assistant.

1041333,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000LXH0AE,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[1, 2]","In the wonderful romantic comedy Stranger Than Fiction, Chicago IRS auditor Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) has suddenly found himself the main character in a novel, which is perhaps an odd subject for a movie. But here the juxtaposition of picture and sound works perfectly, whereas in a novel, the double-jumble of words (as Harold performs an action and the narrator describes it) would prove too constricting.Harold goes about his mundane life until he suddenly hears a narrator (the voice of Emma Thompson) describing his actions and thoughts. It's distracting to be sure, and mostly inconvenient, until the narrator says something about how Harold is going to die. Hoping to live a bit longer, Harold consults a literature expert, Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) who attempts to decipher whether Harold's story is a comedy or a tragedy, as well as who the author might be. Meanwhile, Harold falls in love for the first time, with his complete opposite: an anarchist baker, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Harold meets her while auditing her; she explains that she has only paid 78% of her taxes because the other 22% goes to war, bombs and corporate cover-ups.In Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994), a character asks: if one could save from a burning building either the last known copy of Shakespeare's works or some ""anonymous human being,"" which is the correct choice? Stranger Than Fiction asks a similar question, as it turns out that the Thompson's writer, Kay Eiffel, is in fact creating her masterpiece. Is Harold's life worth more than that? But while Allen leaves his question hanging, Stranger Than Fiction ultimately works its way into a corner, and forces itself to come up with an answer. And no answer could possibly be as interesting as the question.Until this unsatisfying ending, however, the movie flows exactly right. Ferrell manages a streamlined, uncharacteristically low-key performance, and he compliments Gyllenhaal's loose ferocity. They have a wonderful chemistry of the type that graced hit films like When Harry Met Sally and Four Weddings and a Funeral. (Try not to smile when Harold brings a box of ""flours"" for his date.) First-time writer Zach Helm introduces a few bizarre, subversive elements, such as the punk/alternative music that Ana listens to. Professor Hilbert slurps down a constant flow of hot coffee and Kay continually stifles her cigarettes in slightly damp tissues. Food plays an important role as well, from Ana's warm, soft cookies to the cold, creepy dinners eaten by the IRS men.Director Marc Forster has floundered thus far with realism (Everything Put Together, Monster's Ball) and flights of fantasy both maudlin (Finding Neverland) and baffling (Stay), but he shows a nice touch here, even if he's sometimes clumsy or misguided (as with a trick shot of the inside of Ferrell's mouth while brushing his teeth). If the filmmakers had plunged a bit deeper, worked with a little more ambiguity or independence, they might have come up with something more along the lines of The Truman Show (1998) or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). Stranger Than Fiction instead swaps genius for pleasure, but sometimes that's enough.",4,"All heart, very witty - poor ending",1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,3201,"['wonderful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'Chicago', 'IRS', 'auditor', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'suddenly', 'found', 'main', 'character', 'novel', 'perhaps', 'odd', 'subject', 'movie', 'here', 'juxtaposition', 'picture', 'sound', 'works', 'perfectly', 'whereas', 'novel', 'double-jumble', 'words', 'Harold', 'action', 'narrator', 'would', 'prove', 'too', 'constricting.Harold', 'mundane', 'life', 'suddenly', 'narrator', 'voice', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'describing', 'actions', 'thoughts', 'distracting', 'be', 'sure', 'mostly', 'inconvenient', 'narrator', 'something', 'how', 'Harold', 'going', 'die', 'Hoping', 'live', 'bit', 'longer', 'Harold', 'literature', 'expert', 'Professor', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'attempts', 'decipher', 'Harold', 'story', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'author', 'might', 'be', 'Meanwhile', 'Harold', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'complete', 'opposite', 'anarchist', 'baker', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Harold', 'meets', 'auditing', 'only', 'paid', '78', '%', 'taxes', 'other', '22', '%', 'war', 'bombs', 'corporate', 'cover-ups.In', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', '1994', 'character', 'one', 'could', 'save', 'burning', 'building', 'last', 'known', 'copy', 'Shakespeare', 'works', 'anonymous', 'human', 'being', 'correct', 'choice', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'similar', 'question', 'out', 'Thompson', 'writer', 'Kay', 'Eiffel', 'fact', 'creating', 'masterpiece', 'Harold', 'life', 'more', 'Allen', 'question', 'hanging', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'ultimately', 'way', 'corner', 'forces', 'come', 'up', 'answer', 'answer', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'as', 'interesting', 'question.Until', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'however', 'movie', 'exactly', 'right', 'Ferrell', 'streamlined', 'uncharacteristically', 'low-key', 'performance', 'Gyllenhaal', 'loose', 'ferocity', 'have', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'type', 'graced', 'hit', 'films', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Try', 'not', 'smile', 'when', 'Harold', 'box', 'flours', 'date', 'First-time', 'writer', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'few', 'bizarre', 'subversive', 'elements', 'such', 'punk/alternative', 'music', 'Ana', 'Professor', 'Hilbert', 'slurps', 'down', 'constant', 'flow', 'hot', 'coffee', 'Kay', 'continually', 'cigarettes', 'slightly', 'damp', 'tissues', 'Food', 'important', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'Ana', 'warm', 'soft', 'cookies', 'cold', 'creepy', 'dinners', 'eaten', 'IRS', 'men.Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'floundered', 'thus', 'far', 'realism', 'Everything', 'Put', 'Together', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'flights', 'fantasy', 'maudlin', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'baffling', 'Stay', 'nice', 'touch', 'here', 'even', 'sometimes', 'clumsy', 'misguided', 'trick', 'shot', 'inside', 'Ferrell', 'mouth', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'plunged', 'bit', 'deeper', 'worked', 'little', 'more', 'ambiguity', 'independence', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'more', 'lines', 'Truman', 'Show', '1998', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', '2004', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'instead', 'genius', 'pleasure', 'enough']",N/A

Instead, screenwriter Zack Helm gives us characters we care about deeply.  Will Ferrell as Harold Crick turns in a marvelous performance that combines his usual bewildered, semi-clueless persona with depth and passion - a man confronted with the realization that his life may not be his own.When Harold Crick, an auditor for the IRS, starts hearing his life narrated by a calm, female British voice, it drives him crazy, but the real crisis begins when he hears the words ""Little did he know . . . .""  Harold plunges into a quest to discover what this voice means and to steer his mundane life into something more rewarding.  He falls in love with the heavily tattooed, rebellious baker he is auditing (Maggie Gyllenhaal as Ana Pascal) and tries to solve the mystery of the voice with English professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman),  a man more interested in the literary implications of Harold's situation than in the personal stakes.  The film alternates between Harold's dilemma and that of chain-smoking novelist Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), the voice in Harold's head who is on a desperate quest to overcome writer's block.Not a single actor is miscast in this metafictive exploration of writing, character, motivation, self-sacrifice, and passion.  Although it's not clear why a man like Harold would be attracted to a woman like Ana, their chemistry makes the bizarre pairing work.  Queen Latifah as Eiffel's calm assistant Penny balances Thompson's character's trembling near-insanity.Despite the serious issues this film addresses, it is ultimately a comedy.  The laugh-out-loud moments come one after another, and they serve to deepen our emotional involvement with the plot and characters.

My favorite line of the movie was when Emma Thompson, the writer says something like, if you set out to kill the guy in the story, and the guy wants to change the outcome, wants he finds out he will die, shouldn't those be the guys you keep alive? It speaks to those people who believe in fate, vs a predefined outcome to their lives, and the film overall is a great metaphor for not letting ""life pass you by"", in lieu of routine and monotony.All of the characters are well developed and the chemistry is fantastic. I love Maggie and Dustin in these roles, and Emma Thompson as usual, is  standout, as she is faced with her writer's block, and struggles with writing a tragedy vs a comedy. The film also reminds us what things are important in life, and how our behavior would/would not change if faced with sudden death. Although most people would anticipate a comedy, when Will Farrel is involved, this film, laces realism with a provocative challenge of examining our lives in a more ""aware"" state of mind.

1041337,A2Z44AN3F2IN61,B000LXH0AE,D. K. Stokes,"[1, 1]","The story starts with Emma Thompson's voice narrating an ordinary morning in IRS agent Harold Crick's (Will Ferrell) life, a perfectly normal beginning to a movie, until he looks confused and looks around, and the voice stops, then resumes. He's hearing a voice narrating his life, and naturally, it causes a lot of havoc.He tries to ignore it, but the strain starts to show, so a co-worker gives him the ""easier"" of two audits--a baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Of course, it's not easier, because the baker is not only a free spirit who'd dropped out of law school to become a baker and who's refusing to pay the percentage of her taxes pertaining to the defense budget, but he's also extremely attracted to her.Harold consults a psychiatrist, though he's sure he's not crazy, then a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman), who after initial resistance, finds the problem fascinating. Turns out Harold Crick is the main character in novelist Kay Eiffel's (Emma Thompson) latest book, and he's screwed, because she always kills her main character in the end.Ms. Eiffel, meanwhile, is suffering from writer's block, and her publisher sends an assistant (Queen Latifah) to help prod her along.It's such a clever, fascinating story--the collision of fiction and real life, and it's twisted just a little differently from other stories I've read about fictional characters coming to life, though maybe I just haven't read the right stories. What makes it wonderful, though, is that that isn't all there is to the story.There's also the love story between Harold and the baker, which was sweet and believable. Her free spirit is a perfect foil for his regimented existence. He makes missteps that aren't silly or cliched, but rather in line with his character, and she reacts in character as well. Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal bring the characters to life so convincingly you forget they're just acting.There's the story of the author's writer's block and her attempts to foil it--standing at the edge of her desk trying to imagine jumping from a tall building, and the hilarious scene from the previews when she's going through the hospital looking for dying people. The assistant's calm but determined demeanor works so well with the author who's alternately stuck inside her head and going off on flights of fancy. Again, Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah are just perfect in the roles.And the whole thing makes Harold reevaluate his life, which in turn makes the audience think, and we discussed it for days afterward.

I didn't really like it.I had expected to like it--I thought it was going to be an more-intelligent-than-average, feel-good comedy, but I didn't find that much to laugh at in this film, or to feel good about.Instead, it's a quirky sort of character study, infused with some ponderous (almost pretentious) philosophical asides. Maybe the fact that it stars Will Ferrell threw me off? I don't know. Honestly, I'm not even a huge fan of Will Ferrell's comedies, and frankly, I thought he did a fine job here. Like Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Robin Williams and others, I'm gratified to see Mr. Ferrell branch out (and succeed). However, I don't think that Ferrell's regular fans will much enjoy this film, and I feel as though the initial trailers didn't make it clear enough that this was outside of his normal area.Anyways, the acting is all fine. Thompson, Gyllenhaal, Hoffman, Latifah... they're all great, as is usual for all of them. But the script, and story, left me a little cold. It's all very odd, but never feels as powerful, poignant or sweeping as, say, a Charlie Kaufman film. The oddness never has an explanation (which isn't strictly necessary) or, to my mind, a compelling thematic reason for existing (which is). It just feels like a gimmick, used to sell the movie to executives at a pitch meeting. The movie feels like it's trying to be profound, which is a thing that I think rarely works out.Interesting film.

1041340,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000LXH0AE,Doug Anderson,"[4, 9]","Stranger Than Fiction asks an interesting question: who is really narrating/scripting our lives? The fact that the answer the film provides to this anxiety-ridden question is not some transcendent entity nor the government nor aliens is at least original but the fact that the narrator of your life might very well be a chain-smoking sociopath just as depressed about these existential issues as you are will probably not afford you any relief (except of the comic sort). This film asks its questions about self-authorship in an interesting and unfamiliar way and it serves as a sort of a comic wake-up call for those who have acted too long as passive observers of their own realites instead of as active creators (or I should say this is the message most people are taking from the film). Whats really interesting about this film though is not necessarily what you see onscreen but the story being told in the presses about its screenwriter's own attempt, after years of script doctoring for the man, to declare his own independence from the Hollywood script mill by writing from start to finish a script that he could call his own. The resulting script, Stranger Than Fiction, is thus a fictional enacting of its author's real-life urge to break free from the confines of a dehumanizing system and become a self-fashioning agent in his own write.The story gets even odder though when you consider that the film Stranger Than Fiction exists at a kind of generic crossroads between meta-fictional comedy (with only Indie-hit potential) &  romantic comedy (with Hollywood blockbuster break-out appeal) and that its writer never fully commits to either. The writer is of two minds about everything; and the resulting film is a schizophrenic piece of art.The most fascinating way to read this film, I think, is to see both writer and character as two sides of the same person, and to view both to be involved in the identical struggle to liberate themselves from their own formulations. So the question isn't really whether some external agent is scripting our lives but whether we, regardless of whether we see ourselves as artists or real people (or a bit of both), can somehow outrun our tendencies to formulize our lives. It seems that its not really the system that has been sticking it to us all these years but we who have been sticking it to ourselves.The main agents here are I.R.S. investigator Harold Crick (played by a cuddly but subdued Will Ferrell) and his narrator, the psychotically withdrawn Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). The first two-thirds of the film have Harold trying to figure out where that voice in his head is coming from and even though he does figure it out the answer turns out to be a kind of non-answer. That its Kay Eiffel who is narrating Harold Crick's ( a name meant to sound like ""cricket"" and meant to subtley allude to Kafka's cockroach) life to Harold Crick doesn't tell us much except that life is more absurd than Kafka imagined it to be (and exactly as absurd as Pirandello imagined it to be). When narrator and narrated finally meet face to face we expect some kind of meta-theatrical feud over agency or something existential but instead its anti-climactic. The fact that author and character do not discuss their relationship or begin a relationship seems obscure (if this were a French movie I think author and character would sleep with one another and contemplate the fact that the thing that determines all of our lives is the American film industry).  But since its an American film and not a French film it has to be a romantic comedy and so the characters do not need to speak because the fact that it will eventually be a romantic comedy --because its being made for an American market and has to be-- has predetermined the outcome.Hoffman as literary theorist Jules Hilbert bursts onto the screen like a bolt of highly-caffeinated lightning. And he steals the show, at least in my book. Ultimately this literary theorist who seems to be brimming with keen observational powers is only interested in life if he can fit it to some recognizable literary pattern; and this turns out to be as dehumanizing as Kay's adherence to her easily recognizable literary formulae and Harolds own numbers obsession. What makes Hoffman's character so great though is that none of this predetermination stuff bothers him in the slightest. He's perfectly at ease with life being reduced to formula. In fact hes long since resigned himself to this fact. Whether the film is a romantic comedy or a metaphysical caper picture (like say I Heart Huckabees)makes no difference to him. Although given the choice, one assumes, Jules Hilbert would prefer to be in a metaphysical caper picture.A relationship between the novelist and literary theorist is hinted at and would be a logical move since they each love the same thing (looking at life from a perch) but this opportunity is passed by and we do not even get so much as a conversation between these two like-minded literary formulizers. Kay re-writes the script of Harold's life but this doesn't change the fact that Harold Crick is still not the author of his life (unless you see Kay and Harold as two sides of one person).Maggie Gyllenhaal as Ana Pascal, an anarchist/business owner, and nurturer, becomes for Harold Crick a kind of symbol of all that automated man needs to feel human once again. When Harold Crick woos her with a punk song (*Wreckless Eric's ""Whole Wide World""-incredible song!!!) that he just learned on guitar we realize that the film has only two options left: go the way of the old European films of Godard and Antonioni and fade out in a moment of existential irresolvedness or dissolve all existential doubt in sentiment by becoming a romantic comedy. And it chooses both.",3,a writer in search of something,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,5781,"['Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'interesting', 'question', 'who', 'really', 'narrating/scripting', 'lives',

1041342,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B000LXH0AE,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","""Stranger Than Fiction"" is two stories that are artfully melded into a seamless movie. There is first of all the quirky story of Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS auditor, who awakens one day to hear a voice narrating his life. The voice belongs to author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who is writing a novel in which Crick is the main character. She is, of course, ignorant of the fact that her characters exist in real life. In itself, this is a difficult concept to pull off, and ""Stranger Than Fiction"" does an excellent job in this regard. However, if this were the sum and substance of the story, the movie would be worth at best four stars.What makes the movie worth five stars is that there is also the story in which Harold Crick is involved in real life. Assigned to audit a suspicious return, Harold meets the lovely Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who bakes and sells cookies in her little shop, and who has refused to pay the portion of her income taxes that go to support the military. Right from the start one senses that despite the fact that these two are in an adversarial relationship, a fire has been kindled between them. Over time, as Harold and Ana have further contact, the fire develops into a full-blown romantic relationship.Meanwhile, it becomes evident that Karen Eiffel, as she works on her novel, is going to bump off Harold, its major character. And so, in addition to the warmhearted romantic story of Harold and Ana, we are confronted with the suspense of whether or not Ms. Eiffel can be persuaded to rethink the ending of her novel.This is indeed a unique and enjoyable movie. The acting is great. (Ferrell in particular steps out of his usual over-the-top role.) And the concept is pulled off to perfection.

Still, his character remains a bit shallow for the most part, but the movie does work.

1041347,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000LXH0AE,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","Put-upon protagonist Harold Crick appears to exist in the same absurdist universe as screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's off-center characters in ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"". It is not Kaufman, however, who penned the creative script here but rather Zach Helm, whose fertile imagination drives this fatalistic 2006 dramedy. Directed with a nice contemporary panache by the increasingly versatile Marc Forster, the fantasy-driven film focuses on Harold's sadly mundane existence as an emotionally unavailable, anal-retentive tax auditor for the IRS.One morning, he hears a particularly erudite voice describe his life with real-time precision and zealous literacy. Harold desperately seeks out the source, first by speaking with the unctuous office psychiatrist and then by eliciting the help of an eccentric literature professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert. It turns out to be the voice of author Karen Eiffel, who has been undergoing writer's block for nearly a decade, a situation alarming enough to her publishing company that they send a foolproof assistant to ensure a final manuscript is delivered. In the meantime, Harold finds himself drawn to a high-spirited, non-conformist bakery owner named Ana in the middle of a testy, confrontational audit. But the more serious problem is that Harold is the main character in Eiffel's nearly completed novel, and she always kills off her heroes in her books.How Helm and Forster resolve this fanciful dilemma is the best part of the movie because they build the far-fetched convolutions toward a satisfying emotional resonance. If the rest of the set-up doesn't reach the dizzying high-wire act of Kaufman's best work, the film still has genuinely clever plot turns and moments of creative momentum. In a reflective seriocomic performance, Will Ferrell proves he has the acting chops to handle the gravity of Harold's dilemma, even if he has to act constrained most of the time. Emma Thompson manages to capture Eiffel's angst-ridden reclusive nature with her familiar sardonic aplomb.As Ana, Maggie Gyllenhaal finally has a role worthy of her ripened, effortlessly coquettish persona. Playing a more deadpan variation of his bumbling sleuth in ""I Heart Huckabees"", Dustin Hoffman nicely underplays Hilbert. Queen Latifah has relatively little to do as Eiffel's assistant Penny, but she does it with authority. With this accomplished film, Forster really shows a flair for balancing the whimsical with the tangible that drive Helm's charmingly inventive story.",4,Life and Art Clash for a Sad Sack Tax Auditor in a Kaufman-Lite Fantasy Dramedy,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2507,"['Put-upon', 'protagonist', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'exist', 'same', 'absurdist', 'universe', 'screenwriter', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'off-center', 'characters', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'not', 'Kaufman', 'however', 'who', 'penned', 'creative', 'script', 'here', 'rather', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'fatalistic', '2006', 'dramedy', 'Directed', 'nice', 'contemporary', 'panache', 'increasingly', 'versatile', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'fantasy-driven', 'film', 'focuses', 'Harold', 'sadly', 'mundane', 'existence', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'anal-retentive', 'tax', 'auditor', 'IRS.One', 'morning', 'particularly', 'erudite', 'voice', 'describe', 'life', 'real-time', 'precision', 'zealous', 'literacy', 'Harold', 'desperately', 'out', 'source', 'first', 'speaking', 'unctuous', 'office', 'psychiatrist', 'then', 'eliciting', 'help', 'eccentric', 'literature', 'professor', 'Dr.', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'out', 'be', 'voice', 'author', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'who', 'been', 'undergoing', 'writer', 'block', 'nearly', 'decade', 'situation', 'alarming', 'enough', 'publishing', 'company', 'send', 'foolproof', 'assistant', 'ensure', 'final', 'manuscript', 'delivered', 'meantime', 'Harold', 'drawn', 'high-spirited', 'non-conformist', 'bakery', 'owner', 'named', 'Ana', 'middle', 'testy', 'confrontational', 'audit', 'more', 'serious', 'problem', 'Harold', 'main', 'character', 'Eiffel', 'nearly', 'completed', 'novel', 'always', 'heroes', 'books.How', 'Helm', 'Forster', 'resolve', 'fanciful', 'dilemma', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'build', 'far-fetched', 'convolutions', 'satisfying', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'rest', 'set-up', ""n't"", 'reach', 'dizzying', 'high-wire', 'act', 'Kaufman', 'best', 'work', 'film', 'still', 'genuinely', 'clever', 'plot', 'turns', 'moments', 'creative', 'momentum', 'reflective', 'seriocomic', 'performance', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'acting', 'chops', 'handle', 'gravity', 'Harold', 'dilemma', 'even', 'act', 'constrained', 'most', 'time', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'capture', 'Eiffel', 'angst-ridden', 'reclusive', 'nature', 'familiar', 'sardonic', 'aplomb.As', 'Ana', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'finally', 'role', 'worthy', 'ripened', 'effortlessly', 'coquettish', 'persona', 'Playing', 'more', 'deadpan', 'variation', 'bumbling', 'sleuth', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'nicely', 'Hilbert', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'relatively', 'little', 'do', 'Eiffel', 'assistant', 'Penny', 'authority', 'accomplished', 'film', 'Forster', 'really', 'flair', 'balancing', 'whimsical', 'tangible', 'drive', 'Helm', 'charmingly', 'inventive', 'story']",N/A

Never mind that ""American Beauty"" came out several years before this one. They should have passed over ""American Beauty"" anyway and held out for something that was REALLY entertaining, uplifting, AND truly out-of-the-mold, avant garde, etc.I bought this movie after enjoying Maggie Gyllenhaal in ""Secretary"" opposite James Spader. When I want to see more of a particular actor after seeing one of their films, I look them up on Amazon and read the reviews of the films with the best average ratings. For Gyllenhaal, ""Stranger than Fiction"" attracted my attention and the list of other actors in the film sealed the deal.As others have noted, five minutes into this movie I knew I was going to REALLY LOVE it. Everybody was photographed so well. The writing was superb... as was every actor's performance.Some other points worth mentioning:1. As full an experience as this film was/is, the extras made it that much more so. Generous, illuminating, and a completion of an already superb experience.2. The integration of GUI-style graphics in this film broke new ground in my experience by adding a whole new layer of information about what the main character is thinking as he is acting, AND being narrated by the voice-over of Emma Thompson's character. How RICH and COOL is that?! Previously, a similar GUI device was used in the ""Terminator"" to underscore the fact that ""The Arnold's"" character was a cyborg. USed her with a human, it added an extra dimension of description of the (human) character. Given a choice, this film buff would prefer to see this device explored more fully by Hollywood than the rehash of 3-D.3. I am intrigued by one of the opening scenes in which Ms. Thompson's character steps off of a tall building. I knew she was going to do it, but I could not look away. Once it became clear that the author with writer's block was not deceased, I am at a complete loss as to why it is in the film... all the more reason to watch the movie a seccond time in as many days.4. Maggie Gyllenhaal does not disappoint. Quite the opposite. Who is this woman? In an effort to find out, I'm going back for another of her movies. Also, as a result of her perrformance in this movie and ""Secretary,"" I will trust the next movie that comes out with her in it... I trust her judgement that much... first rate... ditto the director.5. For me, this movie was wonderful in the same strange and magical way as M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" and I hope to discover others situated in this odd nether world between realism and surrealism... perhaps I will give Robin William's ""What Dreams May Come"" another viewing.6. After a few days and a reading of Henry David Thoreau's essay, ""Civil Disobedience,"" I have an elevated appreciation for the subtext of civil disobediance undertaken by Miss Gyllenhaal's character, and by the choice to write the hero as a functionary for the IRS. As described by Thoreau, Ms. Gylenhaal's character is Thoreau's avatar in her insistance on living her life from the inside-out, and resisting the government's interest in her support for policies with which she disagrees (implied by her refusal to pay her taxes in proportion to the size of the government's expenditures for things with which she disagrees). Likewise, the fact that she becomes involved with (in essence) a tax collector who is more machine than man makes this association even more compelling. Any reading of Thoreau's essay will convince the reader that it was a powerful influence that shaped this story line. Interestingly, this is only hinted at in the special feature commentaries by Miss Gyllenhaal.",5,"The film that should have won best movie instead of ""American Beauty""...",1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,4207,"['First', 'Preface', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'entertaining', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'could', 'organize', 'movie', 'reviews', 'more', 'dynamic', 'way', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'interesting', 'insightful', 'ones', 'faster.Second', 'Preface', 'was', 'angry', 'embarrassed', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'saw', 'fit', 'give', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'then', 'claim', 'award', 'was', 'film', 'transcendental', 'irony', 'magical', 'realism', 'etc', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'several', 'times', 'cleverer', 'more', 'transcendental', 'magical', 'surreal', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'whisper', 'attention', 'am', 'aware', 'Never', 'mind', 'American', 'Beauty', 'came', 'out', 'several', 'years', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'passed', 'American', 'Beauty', 'anyway', 'held', 'out', 'something', 'was', 'REALLY', 'entertaining', 'uplifting', 'AND', 'truly', 'out-of-the-mold', 'avant', 'garde', 'etc.I', 'bought', 'movie', 'enjoying', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Secretary', 'opposite', 'James', 'Spader', 'When', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'particular', 'actor', 'seeing', 'one', 'films', 'look', 'up', 'Amazon', 'read', 'reviews', 'films', 'best', 'average', 'ratings', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'attracted', 'attention', 'list', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'sealed', 'deal.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'REALLY', 'LOVE', 'Everybody', 'was', 'photographed', 'so', 'well', 'writing', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'actor', 'performance.Some', 'other', 'points', 'worth', 'mentioning:1', 'full', 'experience', 'film', 'was/is', 'extras', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Generous', 'illuminating', 'completion', 'already', 'superb', 'experience.2', 'integration', 'GUI-style', 'graphics', 'film', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'experience', 'adding', 'whole', 'new', 'layer', 'information', 'what', 'main', 'character', 'thinking', 'acting', 'being', 'narrated', 'voice-over', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'character', 'How', 'RICH', 'COOL', 'Previously', 'similar', 'GUI', 'device', 'was', 'used', 'Terminator', 'underscore', 'fact', 'Arnold', 'character', 'was', 'cyborg', 'human', 'added', 'extra', 'dimension', 'description', 'human', 'character', 'Given', 'choice', 'film', 'buff', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'device', 'explored', 'more', 'fully', 'Hollywood', 'rehash', '3-D.3', 'am', 'intrigued', 'one', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Ms.', 'Thompson', 'character', 'steps', 'tall', 'building', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'could', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'became', 'clear', 'author', 'writer', 'block', 'was', 'not', 'deceased', 'am', 'complete', 'loss', 'why', 'film', 'more', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'seccond', 'time', 'as', 'many', 'days.4', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'not', 'disappoint', 'opposite', 'Who', 'woman', 'effort', 'find', 'out', ""'m"", 'going', 'back', 'movies', 'Also', 'result', 'perrformance', 'movie', 'Secretary', 'will', 'trust', 'next', 'movie', 'out', 'trust', 'judgement', 'much', 'first', 'rate', 'director.5', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'same', 'strange', 'magical', 'way', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Lady', 'Water', 'hope', 'discover', 'others', 'situated', 'odd', 'world', 'realism', 'surrealism', 'perhaps', 'will', 'give', 'Robin', 'William', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'viewing.6', 'few', 'days', 'reading', 'Henry', 'David', 'Thoreau', 'essay', 'Civil', 'Disobedience', 'have', 'elevated', 'appreciation', 'subtext', 'civil', 'disobediance', 'undertaken', 'Miss', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'choice', 'write', 'hero', 'functionary', 'IRS', 'described', 'Thoreau', 'Ms.', 'Gylenhaal', 'character', 'Thoreau', 'avatar', 'insistance', 'living', 'life', 'inside-out', 'resisting', 'government', 'interest', 'support', 'policies', 'implied', 'refusal', 'pay', 'taxes', 'proportion', 'size', 'government', 'expenditures', 'things', 'Likewise', 'fact', 'involved', 'essence', 'tax', 'collector', 'who', 'more', 'machine', 'man', 'association', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'reading', 'Thoreau', 'essay', 'will', 'convince', 'reader', 'was', 'powerful', 'influence', 'shaped', 'story', 'line', 'Interestingly', 'only', 'hinted', 'special', 'feature', 'commentaries', 'Miss', 'Gyllenhaal']",N/A

She has writer's block, unable to choose the appropriate demise for her main character, also named Harold Crick. The fictional and real-life characters are one and the same, sharing the fate decided by the writer.From the creative opening sequences, to the slow unveiling of Farrell's character, to the difficult final decision of Thompson's novelist, ""Stranger than Fiction"" never gets off track. Each time the pacing seems it may flag, another element or payoff reengages the viewer. Thompson plays one of her best roles in years. Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah, and Hoffman add their stellar acting to the mix. In contrast to the higher-grossing ""Talledega Nights,"" Farrell proves he can be a riveting screen presence even when subdued.Funny, warm, and life-affirming, ""Stranger than Fiction"" explores the world in an unconventional way. By the end, we feel so comfortable here that it seems almost, well, conventional. Almost the way it should be.

He's a lonely IRS agent, systematic to the point of being [...]-retentive and obsessive,  and intrigued with numbers. He hears a voice that appears to be directing his life, or is he directing his life?Stranger than Fiction is a fresh breath of air from Hollywood, and its format is much akin to the previously mentioned (by other reviewers) The Truman Show in that we have the main character apparently living inside another world with someone else looking down upon it. The biggest question that Harold ( Will Farrell) faces is how much control he ultimately has in his fate, and whether he should try to save his life once he knows it is in jeopardy. Once he discovers that he is hearing a voice narrating his life, he begins to take action to see what he can do about living a happy existence. After getting little help from a psychologist, Harold seeks help from someone who knows about characters and plot, a literary professor (Dustin Hoffman). There are a series of tests for Harold to decipher whether he is living a comedy or a tragedy, and how much he should make his life's ""plot"" move forward. After wavering back and forth between the two, the best advice comes from the professor: ""Go out and live your life...make it the one you've always wanted."" Harold tries to do this, but eventually is able to identify the narrator's voice, and then there is the race to find her, and what to do ultimately about Harold Crick's fate...Several quirky characters and the stars that play them, as well as a unique story, make this film not your average comedy. Will Farrell epitomizes Crick, with his deadpan appearance and humor, and he gives the film a creative edge. Emma Thompson plays Karen Eiffel, the narrator and author with serious writer's block who cannot figure out how to end her main character's life. Dustin Hoffman turns in a solid performance as the coffee-drinking professor (a bit of a stereotype, but good nonetheless). Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) does a fine job as the strong-headed baker who refuses to pay all her taxes, and ultimately has a romance with Crick.Another commendable element of this film is the point of view and perspective. By taking the story from two different points of view, there is the element of fate vs. individual decision intertwined in Harold's life, and this is what drives the plot forward. We are left to wonder until the very end which one will win out.There are a few criticisms of the film. One of these is the unnecessary addition of Queen Latifah's character, who is the writing assistant to the author. This character just followed the author around, and added nothing of significance to the story's plot. Over all this character was strictly pointless, and seemed to just slow down the movie. Another slight criticism is the ending, which seemed to be a little too ""pc"", and didn't coincide with the film's over all originality. It wasn't too obtrusive, but it could have been better though out.Still, Stranger than Fiction is a smart and clever comedy/ drama. If you are looking for something different, love movies that get inside the main character's head (literally and figuratively), or are a literary person or writer with a nasty case of writer's block, this is the film for you!",4,"If you are starved for a movie with some creativity, here it is",1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,3271,"['Meet', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'lonely', 'IRS', 'agent', 'systematic', 'point', 'being', '[', ']', '-retentive', 'obsessive', 'intrigued', 'numbers', 'voice', 'be', 'directing', 'life', 'directing', 'life', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'fresh', 'breath', 'air', 'Hollywood', 'format', 'much', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Truman', 'Show', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'apparently', 'living', 'world', 'someone', 'else', 'looking', 'down', 'biggest', 'question', 'Harold', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'how', 'much', 'control', 'ultimately', 'fate', 'should', 'try', 'save', 'life', 'once', 'jeopardy', 'Once', 'hearing', 'voice', 'narrating', 'life', 'take', 'action', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'living', 'happy', 'existence', 'getting', 'little', 'help', 'psychologist', 'Harold', 'help', 'someone', 'who', 'characters', 'plot', 'literary', 'professor', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'series', 'tests', 'Harold', 'decipher', 'living', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'how', 'much', 'should', 'make', 'life', 'plot', 'move', 'forward', 'wavering', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'best', 'advice', 'professor', 'Go', 'out', 'live', 'life', 'make', 'one', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'Harold', 'tries', 'do', 'eventually', 'able', 'identify', 'narrator', 'voice', 'then', 'race', 'find', 'what', 'do', 'ultimately', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'fate', 'Several', 'quirky', 'characters', 'stars', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'unique', 'story', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'average', 'comedy', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'Crick', 'deadpan', 'appearance', 'humor', 'film', 'creative', 'edge', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'narrator', 'author', 'serious', 'writer', 'block', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'end', 'main', 'character', 'life', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'solid', 'performance', 'coffee-drinking', 'professor', 'bit', 'stereotype', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'fine', 'job', 'strong-headed', 'baker', 'who', 'pay', 'taxes', 'ultimately', 'romance', 'Crick.Another', 'commendable', 'element', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'perspective', 'taking', 'story', 'two', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'element', 'fate', 'vs.', 'individual', 'decision', 'intertwined', 'Harold', 'life', 'plot', 'forward', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'very', 'end', 'one', 'will', 'win', 'are', 'few', 'criticisms', 'film', 'One', 'unnecessary', 'addition', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'character', 'who', 'writing', 'assistant', 'author', 'character', 'just', 'followed', 'author', 'added', 'nothing', 'significance', 'story', 'plot', 'character', 'was', 'strictly', 'pointless', 'seemed', 'just', 'slow', 'down', 'movie', 'slight', 'criticism', 'ending', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'pc', 'did', ""n't"", 'coincide', 'film', 'originality', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'obtrusive', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'out.Still', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'smart', 'clever', 'comedy/', 'drama', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'love', 'movies', 'get', 'main', 'character', 'head', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'are', 'literary', 'person', 'writer', 'nasty', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'film']",N/A

Harold Crick is a character whom you just can't help but liking, and that is because he is such a human character. Crick is essentially just an ordinary guy who is in love with a girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and wants to live a long, happy life with her.

1041360,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000LXH0AE,Grady Harp,"[0, 0]","STRANGER THAN FICTION is one of the more wise, conceptually stunning, finely executed original films to come to the screen in a long time.  How this little gem of a film went unnoticed by the Academy is anyone's guess, but viewers' alert: spend an evening viewing this film and new standards for excellence will be set for you.Director Marc Forster ('Finding Neverland', 'Monster's Ball', 'Stay', 'Everything Put Together') is a director of vision, a man unafraid to tackle testy topics, and a genius at pacing a film with a keen collaborative eye with his cinematographer, his editor, his set designer, his casting director, and his actors.  Taking the chance of working with first time writer Zach Helm (a gifted artist whose niche in the business is already secure with this first venture) and assembling a cast of some of our finest actors proves successful in every graphically odd twist and turn of this unusual, compelling and unclassifiable story.Harold Crick (Will Ferrell - finally given a role in which he can prove that he is an actor and not just a foolish pratfall comedian) is a boring, number obsessed IRS agent whose every moment of every day is timed to be exactly the same (with the important co-existence with his wrist watch!)...until one day he hears a voice narrating his life, the female voice of loopy and blocked writer Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who is writing a story that has a 'Harold Crick' as her main character.  Only our boring IRS agent can hear her voice: his loony office friend Dave (Tony Hale) empathizes but can do little else to help him.  When the narrator begins to talk about ending 'Harold's' life, Harold freaks and seeks guidance from a literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman, in one of his most subtle and refined roles of his career) who knows Eiffel's work and aids Harold in understanding novels, be they comedy or tragedy. Harold also seeks the advice of psychiatrist Dr. Mittag-Leffler (the always superb Linda Hunt) who is of little help, and Dr. Cayly (Tom Hulce) who repairs all upsets with hugs.Meanwhile in his work of auditing citizens he encounters anti-government baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, once again proving that she is one of the most formidable talents in film today), and a bizarre but tender attraction slowly ensues.  And all this time novelist Kay Eiffel is struggling with how to 'kill Harold' so that she can complete her novel. Her publisher sends in 'assistant' Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to ground her and guide her to her novel's completion by helping her observe hospital disasters, vantages, and steadying her grip on life.The manner in which the novel is finished which involves the ultimate fate of Harold and the changes the narration of the novel have had on his life makes up the resolution of the story.  And a cleverly written conclusion it is.  Zach Helm is obviously a brilliant, well-informed writer who knows how to balance comedy and tragedy, crises of life with the little things that count, and can mold conversations so subtle that they beg to be rewound to enjoy the words repeatedly.  Forster wisely uses graphic superimpositions of numbers and graphs and lines to show us the inside of Harold's intriguing mind, all the while allowing us to draw close to the needy and tender aspect of this nerd of nerds, thus making the involvement with his narrator, his girlfriend Ana, and his doctors and professor wholly credible.Some people (this viewer being one) avoided this film in the theaters because of the fear that it may be just another Will Ferrell bit of foolishness: over the top slapstick physical comedy that grows stale after about five minutes.  But Will Ferrell here opens an important new door for his career: he can act!  The ensemble cast could not be improved upon and it is refreshing to see the widely disparate types of actors gathered here work as a cohesive and impeccable unit.

The music was unwinding, freeing and stolid all at once. Cheerful, too. The film is about a man who's hearing voices as if his own life is being read out to him.

1041364,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000LXH0AE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","STRANGER THAN FICTION is a film about a man named Harold Crick who one day hears a posh female voice narrating his life story inside his noggin. STRANGER THAN FICTION is also about a cigarette-wielding author afflicted with a decade-long writer's block, a kid on a bike, a female bus driver, and a fateful wristwatch. The storyline gains impetus when the seemingly omniscient voice matter-of-factly states that Harold's death is imminent. This was one of the movies that got away from me during its theatrical reign. I meant to see it, but somehow never got around to it. Now, months later, before popping in the dvd, I must admit to having had a certain trepidation concerning Will Ferrell's performance. His prior goofy cinematic works gave no real indication that he could consistently pull off this serious role. The very pleasant news is that, yes, indeed, he can. As Harold Crick, you never catch him veering off character, and his effectively low key effort results in a more gratifying and a more resonant cinematic experience for his avid fans as well as the more casual onlookers.The cast really is very well assembled. Emma Thompson's twitchy and neurotic performance as author Karen Eiffel is complemented by her immaculately crisp and modulated, sublimely British vocal delivery, which provides the frighteningly accurate narrative voice in Harold's head. Dustin Hoffman adds a certain authority and a welcome layer of quirkiness to his role of Lit. Professor Jules Hilbert, who becomes interested in Harold's dilemma. The awesome, pixie-cute Maggie Gyllenhaal sparkles as the very sassy and independent cookie maker Ana Pascal, whose immediate on-screen chemistry with Ferrell serves to underscore the pre-Ana Pascal regimented emptiness in his life. Queen Latifah is also here, resplendent in business attire. Thankfully, very little of her rap persona shows up in her performance as Karen Eiffel's assistant. She is convincing enough in her role that, pretty soon, I stopped looking at her and thinking, ""Hey, that's Queen Latifah!""But, despite the rest of the stellar cast and their excellent contributions, it's leading star Will Ferrell who gives STRANGER THAN FICTION its heart and soul. He has never been more engaging. He saturates his Harold Crick with an aching loneliness and a painful awkwardness (especially around Ana) that are so palpable that one immediately feels a sympathetic connection to him. Excellent job by Ferrell, who I didn't know had it in him to muster the acting chops to effectively internalize. My favorite moment has to be Harold strumming his guitar and quietly singing the Monkee's ""I'd Go the Whole Wide World"" with unaffected earnestness.The special features offer 6 comprehensive behind-the-scenes featurettes: ""Actors in Search of a Story""; ""Building the Team"" - this breaks down the film's writing/directing/cinematic collaboration; ""On Location in Chicago"" - about the deliberations that went into the determining of the location (and how Chicago's architecture nicely complements Harold's inner mathematical world); ""Words on a Page"" - this focuses on Zach Helm, who wrote STRANGER THAN FICTION; ""Picture a Number: the Evolution of a G.U.I."" - this is an informative featurette which adds even more heft to Harold's character as it reveals how the graphic designers used Graphic User Interface to illustrate the world as seen from Harold's perspective; ""On the Set"" - an unnecessary three minutes of quick camera shots of cast & crew.There's also an extended, part-improvisational scene (6 and a half minutes long) of Karen Eiffel being interviewed on the Book Channel by Darlene Sunshine (as played with dense peppiness by Kristin Chenoweth) and a 5-minute-long deleted scene of ""author"" Peter Allen Prothero also being interviewed by Darlene Sunshine on the Book Channel. What's missing here is an audio commentary. It would've been nice to hear comments from Ferrell, Gyllenhaal, Hoffman, and Thompson.To me, STRANGER THAN FICTION rates four and a half stars. My only complaint about the movie - and it's a minor one - is that the ending didn't follow thru on the promise begun with the high concept premise. The outcome of Harold Crick is ultimately up to Karen Eiffell, who holds the power of God over him. Eiffell finds herself conflicted as she must choose between the perfect closing chapter for her novel versus her new affinity for her made-up character Harold Crick, who has strangely become a breathing, living person in his own right.STRANGER THAN FICTION is an engaging fable which convincingly argues for upending the tired conventions which sticks one in a rut. It calls for you and me to imbue each precious moment with a passion for living. Countless movies before have espoused this mantra, but few have delivered it with such delicate panache. For example, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, warm and memorable though it is and as much as I love it, chooses to hammer home its message (Capra always was unabashedly sentimental, and there's nothing wrong with that). STRANGER THAN FICTION is wonderfully bolstered by a perceptive script from Zach Helm, a great ensemble cast who breathes vivid life into the richly textured roles, and a very capable directing job by Marc Forster. On the surface, this might seem to be an unorthodox comedy, but as you go deeper into the film, while it does maintain a certain level of levity, it gradually takes on a darker and a more dramatic feel. Just go with the flow and you will reap cinematic dividends. So far, this is the best Will Ferrell I've seen in feature  films. While I do expect to bump into him most often in the realm of zany comedy, every once in a while, I'll look for him to stretch his thespian wings and expand into more challenging roles...",5,"""Get

When he finds out his life is being controlled by an author writing about a character of the same name, and that the author is trying to come up with a not-so-happy ending for the character, Harold must figure out how to prevent his ""untimely"" death. In the meantime, he learns to appreciate the time he does have to live.I really liked Maggie Gyllenhaal and Queen Latifah's roles in this movie. Even though they were both supporting characters, I feel like they're the ones who really carried this film. I also liked some points that the movie implied about literature. As unwanted as graphic situations in some books can be, sometimes you need them to make a story worth reading. Sometimes, I see reviewers on Amazon give a book a bad rating because they were disturbed by the crime, death, rape, etc. that occurred in the story they read. But imagine if the stories were completely censored down to the bone, and nothing bad ever happened in any of them. The story would lose some of its appeal, just like this movie would if there were no problems to solve.That being said, although this movie was enjoyable, I would disagree with the movie characters who insisted that the author NEEDS to kill off the character in her book. While the author could write something bad to happen to him, it didn't necessarily need to be death, especially since the author found out that her writing had a voodoo effect.

The novelist Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is reputed for always killing off her lead character. So Crick is on mission to track her down before it's too late! Eiffel's writing assistant is played by the rap-artist Queen Latifah.Employed by the Inland Revenue, Crick is sent to audit a baker who pays only 78% of her taxes. He instantly falls in love with the baker - the gorgeous but rebellious Anna Pascale (Maggie Gyllenhaal). What begins as a sort of love/hate relationship flourishes over time. Dustin Hoffman excels as ever. Originally he wanted the lead role in this movie but I suspect the directors were reluctant to cast him dating the stunningly cute Gyllenhaal, an actress 40 years his junior! So he has to settle for the eccentric Professor Jules Hilbert instead. He's an important character who helps Crick track down the elusive novelist. It's all very well cast. Even Crick's wristwatch becomes a character in the story!If you're after something a bit different yet not too ""off the wall"", check out this film.

1041375,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B000LXH0AE,Jason Horsley,"[1, 2]","Stranger Than Fiction is a perfect film with one tiny flaw: it doesn't actually make sense. But such flagrant disregard for narrative logic is inseparable from the film's charm, and whether directly inspired by Charlie Kaufman's cinema of self-analysis, it's probably safe to say that the film wouldn't exist without Kaufman's precedent for non-linear, anti-logic meta-narratives. Stranger Than Fiction is less lacerating in its wit and less dark and scabrous in its insights than Kaufman, but considerably more affecting. It's also closer to perfection as a post-millennial, pre-apocalypse schizophrenic romantic comedy, and confirms that the schizo comedy more or less invented by Kaufman (after some early flirtations by Woody Allen) is the natural evolution of the rom-com genre. Current times are far too precarious for a simple ""boy-meets-girl"" scenario to adequately distract us from our collective anxieties anymore.Reflecting what amounts to a global identity crisis, the film is populated by semi-functional lost souls doing what they can to keep their heads above the waters of despair. An OCD IRS worker (Will Ferrell) falls in love with a tattooed Harvard drop-out and failed revolutionary, resigned to baking cookies for a better world (the ever-enrapturing Maggie Gyllenhaal); an acclaimed author and suicide manqu&eacute; suffers from guilt and uncertainty over her literary gift and her wont for killing off characters (a deglamorized Emma Thompson is the tortured soul of the film); a literature professor for whom books are more real than people (another terrific turn by Dustin Hoffman, well on his way to career resurrection in offbeat supporting comedy roles). All characters in search of something if only they knew what, who have taken refuge in their routines in order to survive. Such eccentric characters are perfectly at home in what amounts to a self-reflective, self-referential, meta-comedy, in which fictional beings grasp to be real.Stranger Than Fiction concerns a character in a novel who realizes that he is part of a fictional narrative and attempts to break out of the story (the inevitability of his own death) and meet his maker. The moment he does, he becomes a character in her life, which thereby becomes fiction--the movie we are seeing. It was impossible for me not to try and figure out if Stranger Than Fiction made sense, even while I was engaged in the blissful act of watching it. Fortunately, it was equally impossible to decide with any certainty, and in the end I realized it didn't really matter much. Since we don't have the opportunity to read the novel that Katherine Eiffel is writing, we can't know how much of the protagonist's life (i.e., the movie) is already captured by her fiction. Logically, however, the movie cannot really cohere, since Harold Crick (named after one of the inventors of DNA?), by finding out that a novel is being written about his life, would surely change the fiction's trajectory entirely. He hears the author narrating his life, for example, but he doesn't hear a narration about his hearing the narration, as would presumably be the case, within the (apparent) logic of the movie. Such an idea would force the story to replicate ad infinitum, spinning worlds within worlds, fictions within fictions, mirrors inside mirrors--a reflective universe in which there would be, finally, no object to be reflected.Stranger Than Fiction shies away from the giddier and more psychedelic implications; wisely but also perhaps timidly, it does not venture where shamans and schizophrenics are compelled to tread, staying instead on the safer (and sweeter) ground of life-affirming (and death-defeating) romantic comedy. It flirts with tragedy, but never dares to consummate. It dips its toes into the dark waters of madness, but never plunges in. What makes Stranger Than Fiction different from other feel-good movies is that it actually earns our good feelings. It doesn't sell itself short to please us. It's eccentric and unique enough to create a sense of uncertainty as to where it's going, and the resulting tension--the sense of the unexpected and the feeling that anything can happen--creates a fair imitation both our own lives and of Crick's particular terror of losing control. As with Kaufman, almost every line in the film comes as a surprise; the scenes keep us guessing and the film seems fresh, uncalculated, uncontrived, effortless. The energy and lightness of Marc Forster's direction, and the playful ingenuity of Zach Helm's script, give the impression that the filmmakers are surprising even themselves. The film crackles with laughter and pathos, the laughs are easy and grateful, the tears sweet and unsullied by sentimentality. The beautiful irony of Stranger Than Fiction is that, by making Crick semi-fictional within his own life, he comes to seem far more real than most movie protagonists ever do. I think it's the best film of 2006.The film is so breezily anarchic that there is even some doubt whether it will wind up as a tragedy (the IRS man might have to die for his sins). One of the touching quirks of the movie (and of Will Ferrell's pitch-perfect performance) is that the ""soulless"" civil servant is the most innocent and endearing character in the film, while it is the tormented artist-writer whose soul is in jeopardy. When Eiffel discovers her character is a living, breathing person--not merely the concatenation of her genius--she is forced to face up to a new and disturbing sense of responsibility. The question arises: as a ""creator,"" is being true to her tale necessarily ""right"" for the character in it? This is not exactly a moral question; it goes deeper than mere morality, which after all entails ordinary human relations within an ordinary social context. Stranger Than Fiction raises the question of a God who lacks compassion for its creations, forced to face up to her own conscience by those same creations. Perhaps s/he even became a creator in the first place in order to learn such compassion? By her decision to abandon the necessary ruthlessness of tragedy and let Harold live, Eiffel may become a ""lesser"" (i.e. less-obsessed) writer, but she becomes a better person. She has learned that there is more to real fiction than taking lives, that there is a time for mercy as well as sacrifice. As any creator worth her salt knows, there is no tragedy without comedy, no laughter without tears.",5,Stop Making Sense,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,6432,"['Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'perfect',

This is a genial, none-too-complex tale that uses the same old Hollywood cliches to fill out the paint by numbers characters. Boring guy who counts his toothbrush strokes (he must be in need of a lightening up) perky anti-establishment gal with cool tattoos (she needs a man...hmm, wait she needs this man!) struggling writer who smokes too much, and her driven muse. These are the standard people in such a film, all right out of the cabinet of pre-packaged movie characters. Seen them before, often.There were also innumerable annoyances. First, the narrative we actually hear spoken by Emma Thompson is awful. Folks, that is not a masterpiece, that is lame and silly prose. The screenwriter may flatter himself, but to these ears it was not gold but pyrite. Oh well. Masterpieces are hard to write. (No kidding!) But the more troublesome aspect to me was the accuracy of the story Thompson was writing. She wrote about Crick in the guitar shop as he was there. OK, but when the living Harold Crick was running to make the phone call to her and she wrote ""The phone rang"" to whom was her Harold Crick character calling? His author? No, I think not. Supernatural/time-travel stories are hard to keep consistent, and this little problem often made it perplexing. he still had a life when she wasn't writing about it. Or are all the characters hers? And his transformation from uptight number cruncher to sweet and gentle lover is not only unpleasant to watch, it feels about as likely as Mike Tyson becoming a caring lover.And yet this is not a bomb. Though Queen Latifah is dreadful (another incarnation of the Magic Negro Hollywood so loves) everyone else works hard to make it come alive. The film is so straightforward, the characters, despite their uni-dimensional existence, so earnest, and the look so good that I left it pleased, not annoyed.

1041377,A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y,B000LXH0AE,Jeffrey A. Thompson,"[0, 1]","First, I'll list what I like about the movie. The casting, the performances and most of the dialogs were very good. I can't think of a bad performance. The dialogs were quirky and thoughtful. Lines within their context are very good indeed. I like ""So I decided to save the world one cookie at a time."" Within its context, it is a fairly profound line. Ferrell is very good in this. Emma Thompson is awesome.Second, I'll list what I dislike about the movie. The premise doesn't quite work. Does the Ferrel character hear the voice of the narrator within the novel itself. If he doesn't, I can't see how the author could explain his decisions about changing his life. If he does hear her voice within the novel, the ending does not make any sense. The author changed the ending because the character knew he was going to die in the novel and told her to finish it anyway. You get into the bootstrap problem because the author should have known because she's writing the character. Maybe I missed something? However, my main point is, the story drags because you think you know the character is going to die for most of the story. The plot just plods along setting everything up for the climax. The quaint characters and the spiffy dialog don't quite make for great movie.I would give it 3 1/2 stars because of the performances.",3,Great Performances,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,1326,"['First', ""'ll"", 'list', 'what', 'like', 'movie', 'casting', 'performances', 'most', 'dialogs', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'performance', 'dialogs', 'were', 'quirky', 'thoughtful', 'Lines', 'context', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'like', 'So', 'decided', 'save', 'world', 'one', 'cookie', 'time', 'context', 'fairly', 'profound', 'line', 'Ferrell', 'very', 'good', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'awesome.Second', ""'ll"", 'list', 'what', 'dislike', 'movie', 'premise', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Ferrel', 'character', 'hear', 'voice', 'narrator', 'novel', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'author', 'could', 'explain', 'decisions', 'changing', 'life', 'hear', 'voice', 'novel', 'ending', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'author', 'changed', 'ending', 'character', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'novel', 'told', 'finish', 'anyway', 'get', 'bootstrap', 'problem', 'author', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'writing', 'character', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'something', 'However', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'drags', 'think', 'know', 'character', 'going', 'die', 'most', 'story', 'plot', 'just', 'plods', 'setting', 'everything', 'up', 'climax', 'quaint', 'characters', 'spiffy', 'dialog', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'great', 'movie.I', 'would', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'performances']",N/A
1041378,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000LXH0AE,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[0, 0]","If there is one thing I've learned about authors who write fiction, it's that believable characters can really make a story work. This is often achieved by thinking of the characters as real people, as if the author can actually interact with him or her. The fictional character can be so realistic that the author can have feelings about the character. This is why lovable characters are likely to have good fortune while despicable ones are killed off or suffer some terrible fate. When fiction writers talk about their characters, it sounds no different from talking about people they know in real life. It's an interesting fact if you never knew this. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" takes this idea to another level and so goes the story.I do like the fact that this film keeps jokes about a voice in one's mind to a minimum. The film explores the theme of living life to the fullest if you knew that your life would be over at some point. It's the same thing that happens to people diagnosed with a terminal illness. Then again, it applies even if you have no idea when you'll die or what you'll die from, as Professor Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) implies in one scene. The production and direction were stylish and engaging as well as the acting. Will Ferrell gave a great performance as the protagonist, much restrained in comparison to previous roles but Maggie Gyllenhaal steals the show for coming across as both funny and sad. Veterans Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson deliver as one would expect, entirely at one with their roles. Emma Thompson is enjoyable to watch doing practically anything, and this role gave her a lot to play with. Last but not least, the supporting cast (most notably Queen Latifah) was solid and held the film together. The story was clever, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, and moved along well. I liked the writing and diagrams on screen to represent Crick's thought process, and the look of the film is adequately eccentric, even though the story almost leads to nothing.The only previous work I had seen of director Marc Forster was 2005's ""Stay"" with Naomi Watts, and ""Finding Neverland."" Forster has an incredible imagination and a way of creating such a unique world, story and complicated plot but somehow makes it truly watchable. ""Stranger that Fiction"" certainly succeeds in creating a much more humane story than the sometimes simple-minded ""I Heart Huckabees."" But, still, this is a work of fiction in which every character is sacrificed in the name of a high-minded concept -- a concept which may leave you smiling in the end, but not after you've scratched your head and wondered where all the characters went.",4,Beautiful concept but slightly disappointing by the execution.,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,2653,"['one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'authors', 'who', 'write', 'fiction', 'believable', 'characters', 'can', 'really', 'make', 'story', 'work', 'often', 'achieved', 'thinking', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'author', 'can', 'actually', 'interact', 'fictional', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'realistic', 'author', 'can', 'have', 'feelings', 'character', 'why', 'lovable', 'characters', 'are', 'likely', 'have', 'good', 'fortune', 'despicable', 'ones', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'fate', 'When', 'fiction', 'writers', 'talk', 'characters', 'different', 'talking', 'people', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'interesting', 'fact', 'never', 'knew', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'idea', 'level', 'so', 'story.I', 'do', 'fact', 'film', 'jokes', 'voice', 'one', 'mind', 'minimum', 'film', 'theme', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'knew', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'same', 'thing', 'people', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'illness', 'Then', 'again', 'even', 'have', 'idea', 'when', ""'ll"", 'die', 'what', ""'ll"", 'die', 'Professor', 'Hilbert', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'one', 'scene', 'production', 'direction', 'were', 'stylish', 'engaging', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'protagonist', 'much', 'restrained', 'comparison', 'previous', 'roles', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'show', 'coming', 'funny', 'sad', 'Veterans', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'deliver', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'entirely', 'one', 'roles', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'doing', 'practically', 'anything', 'role', 'gave', 'lot', 'play', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'supporting', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'was', 'solid', 'held', 'film', 'together', 'story', 'was', 'clever', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'tragic', 'moved', 'along', 'well', 'liked', 'writing', 'diagrams', 'screen', 'represent', 'Crick', 'thought', 'process', 'look', 'film', 'adequately', 'eccentric', 'even', 'story', 'almost', 'nothing.The', 'only', 'previous', 'work', 'had', 'seen', 'director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'was', '2005', 'Stay', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Forster', 'incredible', 'imagination', 'way', 'creating', 'such', 'unique', 'world', 'story', 'complicated', 'plot', 'somehow', 'truly', 'watchable', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'certainly', 'creating', 'much', 'more', 'humane', 'story', 'sometimes', 'simple-minded', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'still', 'work', 'fiction', 'character', 'sacrificed', 'name', 'high-minded', 'concept', 'concept', 'may', 'leave', 'smiling', 'end', 'not', ""'ve"", 'scratched', 'head', 'wondered', 'where', 'characters', 'went']",N/A

1041381,A3OFB18116P6RM,B000LXH0AE,J. L. Reimer,"[1, 1]","""Stranger than Fiction"" is an original and delightful film. Harold Crick is introduced, accompanied by narrative, as a boring, methodical IRS agent with his life structured around numbers and punctuality. The fun begins when he starts to hear the voice narrating his life and learns of his impending death. Out of desperation and with the help of a literary professor and a warm-hearted baker, Harold proceeds to change his life and discover the author guiding his destiny.Will Ferrell as Harold leads the impressive cast in a subtle performance. Ferrell allows the humor to come from the situation of his character discovering he may be a fictional character and the absurdity of trying to be believed when telling others. He is given warmth and depth as he changes his life on a path to alter the destiny Karen has planned for him.Emma Thompson plays Karen (sometimes called Kay) who is a depressed reclusive author with no lack of imagination when it comes to finding a way to kill her main character while her assistant, played by Queen Latifah, presses Karen to meet her deadline. Dustin Hoffman is delightful as the quirky literary professor who helps Harold on his journey to discover who he is and find Karen. And through Ana, a free-spirited baker he is sent to audit, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Harold learns to love and care about more than the numbers that fill all parts of his life.The film's direction takes its queue from the unique twist of the script's plot, highlighting the difference in Harold's narrated life of numbers with the one he builds for himself as he takes control of his own destiny. The choices he makes on his journey to discover who he is give the film a rich and fulfilling life that had me laughing out loud.",5,A wonderful experience,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,1748,"['Stranger', 'Fiction', 'original', 'delightful', 'film', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'introduced', 'accompanied', 'narrative', 'boring', 'methodical', 'IRS', 'agent', 'life', 'structured', 'numbers', 'punctuality', 'fun', 'when', 'hear', 'voice', 'narrating', 'life', 'learns', 'impending', 'death', 'desperation', 'help', 'literary', 'professor', 'warm-hearted', 'baker', 'Harold', 'change', 'life', 'discover', 'author', 'guiding', 'destiny.Will', 'Ferrell', 'Harold', 'impressive', 'cast', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Ferrell', 'humor', 'come', 'situation', 'character', 'discovering', 'may', 'be', 'fictional', 'character', 'absurdity', 'trying', 'be', 'believed', 'when', 'telling', 'others', 'given', 'warmth', 'depth', 'life', 'path', 'alter', 'destiny', 'Karen', 'planned', 'him.Emma', 'Thompson', 'Karen', 'sometimes', 'called', 'Kay', 'who', 'depressed', 'reclusive', 'author', 'lack', 'imagination', 'when', 'finding', 'way', 'kill', 'main', 'character', 'assistant', 'played', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Karen', 'meet', 'deadline', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'delightful', 'quirky', 'literary', 'professor', 'who', 'Harold', 'journey', 'discover', 'who', 'find', 'Karen', 'Ana', 'free-spirited', 'baker', 'sent', 'audit', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Harold', 'love', 'care', 'more', 'numbers', 'fill', 'parts', 'life.The', 'film', 'direction', 'queue', 'unique', 'twist', 'script', 'plot', 'highlighting', 'difference', 'Harold', 'narrated', 'life', 'numbers', 'one', 'control', 'own', 'destiny', 'choices', 'journey', 'discover', 'who', 'give', 'film', 'rich', 'fulfilling', 'life', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud']",N/A

I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it turned out to be far better and entertaining than I had precieved.Typically,Will Farrel(at least to me) is a hit and miss in the comedy department.You either like him or hate him and when most of his films are just elongated Saturday Night Live skits,Stranger than Fiction is quite different than what he usually does,but Stranger than Fiction's lead character ""Harold"" really fits Will Farrel quite well.I liked this film because of its quirky humor and most of all because of its originality.Its nice to get a fesh breath of air once in a while from a place that usually relys on sequels and ""quote"" summer block busters to make their bread and butter.Stranger than Fiction also has a great cast and storyline,you almost have to have no soul, sense of humor or be a completely borring person to not like this film.In the end,Stranger than Fiction might even have you questioning and anylizing your own life and to maybe even cause you to take control of your own destiny and live the life you've always wanted one cookie at a time.",4,"""And so it was, Harold Crick was saved by a wristwatch""",1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,2646,"['Harold', 'Crick', 'mild', 'mannered', 'calculating', 'IRS', 'Agent', 'predictable', 'individual', 'who', 'life', 'numbers', 'almost', 'litterally.Harold', 'counts', 'brush', 'strokes', 'teeth', 'steps', 'when', 'bus', 'only', 'single', 'windsor', 'knot', 'save', 'time', 'tieing', 'tie.Day', 'day', 'predictable', 'life', 'counting', 'going', 'watch', 'seconds', 'minutes', 'time', 'one', 'day', 'voice', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'life.Now', 'Harold', 'life', 'changes', 'followed', 'narrating', 'voice', 'head', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'be.One', 'day', 'life', 'was', 'going', 'according', 'plan', 'next', 'total', 'disarray.Where', 'thought', 'once', 'was', 'control', 'life', 'now', 'mercy', 'narrator', 'who', 're-writing', 'life', 'him.Beliveing', 'crazy', 'not', 'wanting', 'die', 'voice', 'read', 'Harold', 'out', 'seek', 'outside', 'assistance', 'college', 'professor', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', '.Unable', 'find', 'answer', 'instead', 'letting', 'narrator', 'write', 'life', 'Harold', 'change', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'control', 'destiny', 'suddenly', 'charge', 'life', 'always', 'wanted.Until', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'who', 'voice', 'frantically', 'contact', 'stop', 'novalist', 'killing', 'off', 'new', 'novel', 'always', 'done', 'many', 'novels', 'before.In', 'end', 'Harold', 'fate', 'written', 'far', 'nobler', 'death', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'store', 'years', 'later.In', 'twist', 'fate', 'circumstance', 'Harrold', 'odds', 'thanks', 'wristwatch', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'correctly', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'entertaining', 'had', 'precieved.Typically', 'Will', 'Farrel', 'least', 'hit', 'miss', 'comedy', 'department.You', 'hate', 'when', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'elongated', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'skits', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'quite', 'different', 'what', 'usually', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'lead', 'character', 'Harold', 'really', 'Will', 'Farrel', 'quite', 'liked', 'film', 'quirky', 'humor', 'most', 'originality.Its', 'nice', 'get', 'fesh', 'breath', 'air', 'once', 'while', 'place', 'usually', 'relys', 'sequels', 'quote', 'summer', 'block', 'busters', 'make', 'bread', 'butter.Stranger', 'Fiction', 'also', 'great', 'cast', 'storyline', 'almost', 'have', 'have', 'soul', 'sense', 'humor', 'be', 'completely', 'borring', 'person', 'not', 'like', 'end', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'might', 'even', 'have', 'questioning', 'anylizing', 'own', 'life', 'maybe', 'even', 'cause', 'take', 'control', 'own', 'destiny', 'live', 'life', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'one', 'cookie', 'time']",N/A

1041388,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000LXH0AE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Damn Hollywood and their need for happy endings. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" was a film that opened in 2006 to great reviews, had a lot of Oscar buzz surrounding it, and then audiences began responding to the film rather poorly (at least where I live...Everyone I know that has seen it, hates it) and so it disappeared. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is very original, well-written, well-acted, and very funny...Since it tells you what's going to happen at the end, I prayed that the writer wouldn't back out and change it. Then the ending happens and I found myself shaking my head disapprovingly. The ending is satisfying, nice to see...But, in my opinion, I would say this was one of the best films of the year...A nice break perhaps from a typical studio film, but I guess that's too much to ask for. Will Ferrell (once again blending nicely into a comedy-drama, following his scene stealing performance in ""Winter Passing"") plays Harold Crick, an IRS agent whose life is a seemingly endless circle of teeth brushing, working, and going to sleep. Harold has no life, no girlfriend, no friends, and his life is based around numbers. While the film never says it, Harold clearly has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and counts his brush strokes, stairs, steps, and relies heavily on his wristwatch (which seems to have a personality of its own). Then, one day, a strange thing happens. Harold finds that a female is narrating his life and only he can hear it. We know (in an example of dramatic irony, hilariously noted by Dustin Hoffman) that the narrator is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson, who's terrific), a famous writer who hasn't published a novel in 10 years due to writer's block. Harold Crick is her main character and she's struggling with finding a way to kill him, so much so that her publishers have hired an assistant (Queen Latifah) to help her. Harold, fearing that he is crazy, suddenly begins taking the narrator seriously when she says that Harold will soon die. Fearing the worst, he consults a literary professor (Dustin Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in) who tells Harold to find out whether his story is a comedy or tragedy. Things aren't looking good for Harold since the odds are against him...He works for the IRS, everybody hates him. When he tries to file an audit on Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a baker, the whole bakery boos him. But then Ana begins to fall for Harold (surprisingly both Ferrell and Gyllenhaal have pretty good chemistry together) and things look up. Until a construction company almost demolishes his apartment, while he's inside watching TV Thompson's narration of the events is absolutely hilarious and Thompson's voice is so suited for the role. The movie has a great look to it and for a while I had a lot of hope for it. It kept heading in the direction of the non-stereotypical Hollywood comedy-drama, but opts out at the last second. I still enjoyed ""Stranger Than Fiction"" quite a bit and, as I said, I did enjoy the ending and maybe the ending I was hoping for wouldn't have worked as good. All the actors are perfectly cast in their roles...Ferrell is doing a very good job at slowly easing his way into the drama category, Hoffman & Thompson are perfect, and Latifah & Gyllenhaal add a lot of nice moments to the film. I recommend ""Stranger Than Fiction"" it's certainly one of the best films of its kind from 2006 and has a lot more originality than those other films.GRADE: B+",4,Almost Perfect,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,3431,"['Damn', 'Hollywood', 'need', 'happy', 'endings', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'was', 'film', 'opened', '2006', 'great', 'reviews', 'had', 'lot', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'then', 'audiences', 'began', 'responding', 'film', 'rather', 'poorly', 'least', 'where', 'live', 'Everyone', 'know', 'seen', 'disappeared', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'very', 'original', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'very', 'funny', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'prayed', 'writer', 'would', ""n't"", 'back', 'out', 'change', 'Then', 'ending', 'happens', 'found', 'shaking', 'head', 'disapprovingly', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'nice', 'see', 'opinion', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'A', 'nice', 'break', 'perhaps', 'typical', 'studio', 'film', 'guess', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'once', 'again', 'blending', 'nicely', 'comedy-drama', 'following', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'Winter', 'Passing', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'IRS', 'agent', 'life', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'circle', 'teeth', 'brushing', 'working', 'going', 'sleep', 'Harold', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'friends', 'life', 'based', 'numbers', 'film', 'never', 'Harold', 'clearly', 'Obsessive', 'Compulsive', 'Disorder', 'brush', 'strokes', 'stairs', 'steps', 'relies', 'heavily', 'wristwatch', 'have', 'personality', 'own', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'strange', 'thing', 'happens', 'Harold', 'female', 'narrating', 'life', 'only', 'can', 'hear', 'know', 'example', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'hilariously', 'noted', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'narrator', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'terrific', 'famous', 'writer', 'who', ""n't"", 'published', 'novel', '10', 'years', 'due', 'writer', 'block', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'main', 'character', 'struggling', 'finding', 'way', 'kill', 'so', 'much', 'publishers', 'have', 'hired', 'assistant', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'help', 'Harold', 'fearing', 'crazy', 'suddenly', 'taking', 'narrator', 'seriously', 'when', 'Harold', 'will', 'soon', 'die', 'Fearing', 'worst', 'literary', 'professor', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'scene', 'who', 'Harold', 'find', 'out', 'story', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'good', 'Harold', 'odds', 'are', 'IRS', 'everybody', 'When', 'file', 'audit', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'baker', 'whole', 'bakery', 'boos', 'then', 'Ana', 'fall', 'Harold', 'surprisingly', 'Ferrell', 'Gyllenhaal', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'things', 'look', 'up', 'construction', 'company', 'almost', 'apartment', 'inside', 'watching', 'TV', 'Thompson', 'narration', 'events', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Thompson', 'voice', 'so', 'suited', 'role', 'movie', 'great', 'look', 'while', 'had', 'lot', 'hope', 'kept', 'heading', 'direction', 'non-stereotypical', 'Hollywood', 'comedy-drama', 'out', 'last', 'second', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'quite', 'bit', 'said', 'did', 'enjoy', 'ending', 'maybe', 'ending', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'roles', 'Ferrell', 'doing', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'slowly', 'easing', 'way', 'drama', 'category', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'are', 'perfect', 'Latifah', 'Gyllenhaal', 'add', 'lot', 'nice', 'moments', 'film', 'recommend', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'kind', '2006', 'lot', 'more', 'originality', 'other', 'films.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

1041399,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B000LXH0AE,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","I'll come right out and say it -- I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell.  Like other actors of his brand of slapstick/gross-out humor (Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, etc.), he's usually way too over-the-top and obnoxious for me to enjoy much.  I didn't mind it in ""Elf"" and ""Megamind"" so much (probably because both were PG and he kept the potty humor to a minimum), but it just became obnoxious in films like ""Anchorman"" and ""Blades of Glory.""  So when I heard he was turning to a more dramatic, less slapstick role in this film, I was skeptical.  Not every comedic actor makes a successful transition to drama, after all.It turns out I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Will Ferrell delivers a surprisingly restrained performance in this movie, one that takes a tired clich&eacute; of a plot -- what would you do if you found out your days are numbered? -- and finds a fresh new twist to it.Will Ferrell is Harold Crick, an IRS auditor living a bland existence and who prefers his life orderly and structured... and who begins to hear a strange voice in his head, narrating his life as he lives it.  At first he's merely weirded out (and rightfully so), but when the ""narrator"" drops a hint that his death is right around the corner, he freaks out and tries to find help to deal with his unconventional problem.  Eventually he finds aid in a renowned literary professor, who tries to help him find out who's writing his tale and what genre of story he's currently inhabiting, that they might learn of his ultimate fate.  Along the way Harold starts to loosen up, trying to truly live life in his last days and even romancing a semi-rebellious bakery owner who he's been assigned to audit.  Meanwhile, reclusive and sarcastic author Karen Eiffel is struggling with a bad case of writer's block, and with the help of an assistant tries to puzzle out the right means of killing off her current novel's protagonist... Harold Crick.As stated before, this type of plot has been done to death, and often with overly sappy results.  But the ""narrative of life"" angle gives it a fresh twist, and the quirky and believable characters help further the story along.  In a day and age when most films are populated by caricatures instead of real people, it's nice to find a film made up of actual people, characters who you might easily recognize from your own circle of friends and acquaintances.  And while the film is quite funny, making it more of a comedy-drama than a straight drama, it doesn't fall back on slapstick or gross-out/shocker humor to get a laugh, but instead finds humor in the situation and character interactions -- the best kind of comedy, in my opinion.The actors do a marvelous job of carrying the film and portraying the characters as well.  Will Ferrell delivers a surprisingly nuanced and restrained role as Harold, the lead character, and while the film provides him a few chances to cut loose and be over the top (such as loudly telling his inner voice to shut up or beating his bed with a lamp -- it makes sense on context), the film works best when he's quieter and more reserved.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Ana, a punkish bakery owner who at first lives to make Harold's life miserable (he IS auditing her, after all) but eventually softens toward him when she sees he's not a bad man, just a slightly nerdy guy doing his job.  Emma Thompson is darkly delightful as a snarky author trying to decide how best to off her main character, while Queen Latifah -- primarily known for comedy much like Ferrell -- is remarkably quiet and reserved as her assistant.  Dustin Hoffman plays the literary professor who seems to be enjoying Ferrell's unique predicament a little too much, and while he did a good job in his role it's probably one of the less notable performances in the film.A quirky and different take on an old idea, this is a thoughtful comedy-drama that's well worth a look.  Even if you're not a Will Ferrell fan, you'll most likely enjoy this film, as it's an atypical role for Ferrell and a comedy that doesn't rely on shock value or mindless slapstick to work.

1041400,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000LXH0AE,Kevin Killian,"[0, 0]","Karen (Emma Thompson) is a best selling cult novelist like Anne Tyler or someone who's famous for the consistency with which her main characters meet fate, for all of them die.  No exceptions.When Harold Crick figures out that he's one of her characters, with the help of humanist Dustin Hoffman, he gets upset, naturally enough, and attempts to break down the fortress of solitude Karen Eiffel's erected around herself.I found some of the characters unconvincing.  Queen Latifah must haveread the script, discovered she wasn't playing anything real, and just decided to look elegant and demure, playing a life-coach type of woman whom Karen hires to help her work through her writers' block.  Latifah can be good when the script give her something to do, but here, she's just something for Thompson to bounce off of.Kind of the same thing for Maggie Gyllenhall, who was just there to soften up uptight Will Ferrell--that is her total function in the movie, the conventional ""love interest.""  But she makes the most of it and reportedly went to a crash course seven week course in pastry making at France's Cordon Bleu, and throughout the movie you see her energetically ignoring the script and baking a carload of pastries, brioches, cookies and strudel.  Good for her!Regarding the ending of the movie, I, a novelist myself, have often wondered if it would have made a difference if the screenwrifers had set up more romantic/sexual tension between Emma Thompson and Will Ferrell.  The way it is, there's nothing there, but I would have liked to see them get involved, maybe go to Club Med, get Karen out of that pretentious, chichi empty cold Manhattan apartment, and give her some laughs.  And instead of Maggie Gyllenhall opposing this development, she could be welcoming, reassuring, teaching Emma Thompson that baking is the next best thing to godliness.

1041402,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000LXH0AE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[137, 148]","The idea of ""Stranger Than Fiction"" appealed to me the moment I first heard of it.  Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell, wakes up one day and hears a voice.  An omniscient narrator is relating his life with precision and no one can hear that voice but himself.  It turns out that the voice is Emma Thompson, playing a famed author who is actually writing a novel about a character named Harold Crick.  And it's the same Harold Crick.  What is being put down in fiction is also concurrently happening in real life.  It's a tricky concept, one that I felt might be impossible to pull off effectively.  Well, not only does ""Stranger Than Fiction"" pull it off--it succeeds grandly as a surprisingly thoughtful, amusing, and moving contemplation of life.  For Harold must immediately confront his mortality when the narrator informs him/us that he will soon die!The complicated narrative of the film is pulled off brilliantly.  The overlapping structure necessary to maintain the momentum and cohesion of the film must be attributed to a clever, intricate screenplay.  Literate, witty, and real--it's a real treat.  Lots of interesting effects help to pull the two worlds together making even the most mundane moments of Harold's life visually compelling.  The movie's construction is fascinating and enjoyable.Will Ferrell reins in his typical ""overgrown kid"" persona, and plays Harold as a real guy.  It's refreshing and while I've never considered him a leading man type--his tentative romance with Maggie Gyllenhaal (while a bit of a stretch) is played very credibly and sweetly.  Dustin Hoffman, as a literature professor helping Harold discover what book he's in, is having a great time.  But it's Emma Thompson that stole my heart.  As the author, she is a complete neurotic mess--but as she begins to realize what is happening, something in her transforms.  Her character provides much of the film's insight and it's most powerfully dramatic acting.  It's a deft balancing act, and as usual--she hit all the right marks.After a near perfect movie, we have to bring both stories of Harold to an end.  The movie turns into a poignant examination of sacrifice.  If Thompson kills Harold in her novel, it will be recognized as a great piece of literature.  If she lets him live, the novel will be just another routine bit of entertainment.  This art versus commercialism angle is absolutely enthralling, and also surprising since it is raised so late in the film.  There are moments of real power as everyone faces important life decisions--but these aren't false ""lessons,"" they are genuine emotion that the film has subtly earned.Ultimately, the ending is exactly what the film wants it to be.  While I didn't find it the most satisfying choice--it is perfect for the movie because by this point the film itself is mirroring the novel within the film.  It's a clever bit of trickery and very unusual.  I admired ""Stranger Than Fiction"" very much and would give it 4 1/2 stars as an original and intelligent treat.

However, I was impressed that this movie was different from any that I have seen before.So movie is about a man who lives his days for the past 12 years exactly the same. One day he finds himself hearing a voice that is narrating his everymove. Eventually he finds help and finds himself scared to death because this voice tells him that he is going to die. He spends the next couple of days trying to change this outcome, while doing a lot of things he has always wanted to do.Good acting by the characters. A great plot. Something entirely different. Characters are very simple, very common. It was nice to see how other not so main characters were all related at some point.Only thing was towards the end it starts to slow down.

He suddenly hears a woman's voice narrating what he is doing.  This is very disconcerting to someone like Harold, or anyone for that matter.  Everything he does is narrated by a voice only he can hear.  The voice states that he is facing imminent death so he goes to a psychiatrist who recommends a literary writer Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) on what to do.  Jules suggests to do something unexpected - like tell a baker he is auditing that he would like to start dating her.  The baker Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is cute, bubbly and strong-willed, but falls for Harold.  This is to be a surprise to the ""voice"" narrating his life - and cause a different ending.  Harold begins to have fun and enjoy life and feels he cannot die young.  But then he finds the author, Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson).

1041416,A7NRL3R5C0AL4,B000LXH0AE,"Maeri ""Marysz""","[1, 2]","This is a film about the loneliness that comes with intellectual perfectionism. It begins with the voice of an off-screen female narrator as we watch IRS auditor Harold Crick start his rigidly prescribed daily routine. The film's plot turns on the fact that Harold, along with us, can hear the woman's overbearing voice, and can't help wondering if he or she is driving the events in his life. In fact, he's a character in her novel. It's reminiscent of The Truman Show, where Jim Carrey plays a similar role as an unwitting character in a reality TV show. Fortunately, playing Crick, Will Ferrell can convey real emotional depth along with his humor and his nuanced acting gives the film its emotional resonance.The novelist writing Crick's story, Kay Eiffel,  has writer's block because she sets too high standards for herself. Prof. Jules Hilbert, who Crick goes to for advice about narrative fiction, is a schlump of a guy who's constantly eating and fidgeting in an abject way that's at odds with his lofty intellectual ideals. Cricks's also a perfectionist (and very smart) in his own OCD way, but at least he doesn't suffer from Eiffel and Hilbert's sense of pompous self-importance.Crick falls in love with a woman he's assigned to audit--Ana, a Harvard dropout who runs a bakery. She's bought out of the academic and literary rat race that Eiffel and Hilbert are so invested in. But she has a rigidly left-wing political philosophy that's led her to withhold her taxes--she could end up in jail. Crick and Ana's love for each leads them to make a healthy compromise in their relationship and love each other despite their tempramental differences.Eiffel and Hilbert, both dowdy and unattached, serve as a cautionary tale to the younger Harold and Ana--this is what they could turn into if they don't unbend and accept their own and other's intellectual and personal imperfections.

The writers have to be very young to think this stuff has weight, but therein lies the charm of the film.  Stranger Than Fiction is a blast from the past for middle-agers like me. It is glimmer from a time when you any thought seemed brilliant, and just the fact that you were asking the big questions was exhilarating. Pure nostalgia, in other words.The central conceit of the film is rather trite, and inconsistently utilized, but provides a vehicle for a pretty nice bit of romance between Will Ferrell and a remarkably sexy Maggie Gyllenhaal. With Ferrell looking defiantly youthful, and Gyllenhaal looking sweet, but haggard, they come out feeling about the same age, and there's some nice dialogue and chemistry between the two. Dustin Hoffman does a nice turn as a rather gross English professor, despite having to muddle through mainly half-baked and incoherent expositions that serve no purpose other than to force the movie to press ahead to its conclusion.The conclusion, sadly, is a maudlin and monumental failure, redolent of Hallmark and American Express commercials. It fishes up the old cliches about what gives life meaning, and spoons them back to us in big, syrupy chunks. Sadly, it diminishes everything that came before, and left me feeling more queasy than redeemed or enlightened.I think Stranger Than Fiction deserves a 3 for some nice acting, but a largely forgettable script dampens the whole affair.",3,Lightweight philosophy of the mildly amusing sort.,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,1569,"['Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'kind', 'profound', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'trenchant', ""'ve"", 'had', 'chance', 'sober', 'up', 'writers', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'young', 'think', 'stuff', 'weight', 'therein', 'charm', 'film', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'blast', 'past', 'middle-agers', 'glimmer', 'time', 'when', 'thought', 'seemed', 'brilliant', 'just', 'fact', 'were', 'asking', 'big', 'questions', 'was', 'exhilarating', 'Pure', 'nostalgia', 'other', 'words.The', 'central', 'conceit', 'film', 'rather', 'trite', 'inconsistently', 'utilized', 'vehicle', 'pretty', 'nice', 'bit', 'romance', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'remarkably', 'sexy', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Ferrell', 'looking', 'defiantly', 'youthful', 'Gyllenhaal', 'looking', 'sweet', 'haggard', 'come', 'out', 'feeling', 'same', 'age', 'nice', 'dialogue', 'chemistry', 'two', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'nice', 'turn', 'rather', 'gross', 'English', 'professor', 'having', 'muddle', 'mainly', 'half-baked', 'incoherent', 'expositions', 'serve', 'purpose', 'other', 'force', 'movie', 'press', 'ahead', 'conclusion.The', 'conclusion', 'sadly', 'maudlin', 'monumental', 'failure', 'redolent', 'Hallmark', 'American', 'Express', 'commercials', 'up', 'old', 'cliches', 'what', 'life', 'meaning', 'spoons', 'back', 'big', 'syrupy', 'chunks', 'Sadly', 'everything', 'came', 'left', 'feeling', 'more', 'queasy', 'redeemed', 'enlightened.I', 'think', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', '3', 'nice', 'acting', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'script', 'whole', 'affair']",N/A

Will Ferrell is so extroverted I did not see how he could play this part. So much for type casting, for Will Ferrell actually brought his character to life, Harold Crick. An IRS Auditor whose life is numbers. He wakes up one morning and hears his life is being narrated and he comes to realize that he has no control of his fate.Maggie Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job as Ana Pascal, a baker that Harold Crick has to audit. Dustin Hoffman seemed to have fun playing Professor Jules Hilbert an expert of literature who knows that great literature lives on forever and gives advice to Harold. Queen Latifah plays the narrator's very professional assistant Penny Escher, which brings a great dynamic between her and Emma's character. Emma Thompson, playing a famed author who is actually writing a novel about Death and Taxes, is the narrator and her brilliance as an actor is obvious in this film.There are many levels to this film; it is a drama that has some light moments, a tapestry of comedy and tragedy. The story is engaging and worth watching. To share more of the plot and the deeper meaning I found in it pertaining to life and literature I feel would ruin the first viewing pleasure of this film.

He's so boring that he counts the number of times he brushes his teeth in the morning and the number of steps he takes.All that changes one Wednesday.  When he wakes up that morning, he hears a voice narrating his every action.  Of course, this creeps him out, and his co-workers begin to notice his odd behavior.  But things get even worse on his way home from work when the voice predicts his imminent death.Harold doesn't relish that idea, so he begins to look for help with his problem.  Eventually, he comes in contact with English professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who tries to help him figure out what to do from a literary standpoint.Meanwhile, famed novelist Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is trying to figure out how to end her latest book, DEATH AND TAXES.  She's got everything except how to kill off her main character, Harold Crick.As far as I can remember, I've only seen one other Will Ferrell movie.  Most of the previews look too over the top for my taste.  This one intrigued me, however, so I set aside my prejudices and went to see it.  I'm glad I did.To be honest, I expected a funnier movie.  This isn't Ferrell's normal over the top gag fest.  It is funny, and I laughed through most of it.  Just not as often as I thought I would.That's because there's an underlying pathos to the story.  Facing death, Harold realizes that he's never really lived.  This gives him the boldness to go for some things he's always wanted to do and make some friends.  The performances by the entire cast wonderfully walk the balance between the comedy and the more elements of the film.Yeah, there were scenes that could have been funnier, but I like the final product.

Going into this movie, I expected classic Will Ferrell humor, but there was actually very little of that.  It was clearly his most serious role, and shows how versatile of an actor Will Ferrell can be.I've watched this movie several times, and the storyline still hasn't worn off for me.  The movie is very moving in terms of its plot.  There are parts of sad moments, funny moments, and confusing moments, but they all come together at the end.

1041427,A2HR0DJG4WMR8R,B000LXH0AE,"Maurice Williams ""mauricewms""","[15, 16]","""Stranger than Fiction"" opened the 42nd Annual Chicago International Film Festival. Dustin Hoffman, who plays one of the central characters in the film, was presented with the festival's Career Achievement Award and Will Ferrell participated in the ceremony.  This highly clever literary/cinematic dramady is about a writer of tragedy novels who struggles with how to end her latest.  As Kay Eiffel, played by Emma Thompson, imagines how to kill off her main character, her thoughts are in some way transmitted to a real man whose actual life is exactly the same as the character in the novel.  Sound Trippy?  Well it is; talk about being connected to your character!  Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, the main character.  Harold consults with a therapist for help, unsure if he's going crazy hearing the voice of a woman literally narrate his life.  Unconvinced of the therapist's diagnosis, he is referred to Dr. Jules Hilbert, played by Dustin Hoffman, for further analysis.  As the novel and Harold's life unfolds, Harold finds himself in a literally literary struggle to have a life by saving his life.This film works on so many levels.  First, it is a skillful display of the writing process and the importance of knowing your character - literally getting in his head.  The film also displays the often talked about attachment that writers can have to their characters even though that attachment could cloud the creative process necessary to finish the novel.  Skillful writers are able to create characters that are so real and believable that killing them is nearly impossible.  Is it the characters that drive a good story or are they subordinate to the story that they serve?Stranger than Fiction is smart, funny, and thought provoking; I hope that this artsy release enjoys a wide viewing audience.  There's as much in it for literary types and there is for film lovers and if you're both, well you're in for an extra special treat.  I can usually predict the likelihood of Oscar nominations and awards for films in the festival with a high degree of accuracy.  While ""Stranger than Fiction doesn't"" have ""Oscar written all over it"", it should get a nod in the original screen play category.  I'm highly recommending this one.

This film is sharp, creative, and beautifully crafted. It's likable and ultimately a tad sentimental as well. Novelist Karen ""Kay"" Eiffel (Emma Thompson) narrates the story of Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), a methodical, mathematical IRS agent whose life has never deviated from its precise routine until this Wednesday. On Wednesday, two things changed: Harold began to hear a voice in his head narrating his every move. And Harold's wristwatch stopped. When Harold hears the narrator say that this would ""result in his imminent death"", he panics. The narrator has never been wrong before. He goes to a psychiatrist, who assures Harold that he's schizophrenic. So he turns to a professor of literature, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who, through a series of questions and experiments, tries to help Harold figure out what sort of story he is in.""Stranger Than Fiction"" is funny and sweet, clever and thoughtful. It comments on the writing process in a new way, seeing the creation of character and story from both the writer and character's point of view. Being both an actress and a writer herself, Emma Thompson is the obvious and perfect woman for the role of Kay Eiffel. Great films need great supporting casts, and Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Tony Hale deliver the goods. We're not sure if Harold Crick is real or not, but Zach Helm's screenplay keeps us wondering. I was struck by the locations, production design, and visual effects that define Harold's universe, so I wasn't surprised to find that Marc Forster directed this film. He is obsessive about visual information and found fantastic locations in Chicago to express Harold's ordered universe. Harold's preoccupation with numerical data is made visible through a simulated graphic user interface, which blends seamlessly with his environment.I'm probably one of few people who has never liked Will Ferrell's comic performances. This relatively quiet dramatic role with lots of good humor suits Ferrell perfectly. It's his best role on the big screen yet. Harold somehow finds a way to be heroic though he doesn't control his own life. Kay struggles to find the courage to kill off her character where nerve has never failed her before. We have two interlaced tales of how Harold relates to the world and how a writer relates to her character. For a movie that is as good-natured as this is, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is awfully smart.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2007): Bonus features include an extended version of the Book Channel interview with Karen Eiffel, a deleted scene of a Book Channel interview with Peter Allen Prothero, and 5 featurettes. ""Actors in Search of a Story"" (18 min) includes interviews with director Marc Forster, producer Lindsay Doran, writer Zach Helm and the actors discussing characters, with a section on each character.

It's a bit of a challenge, because I felt impatient with it in the beginning, wanting it to move along faster, but its plodding pace is for a purpose, I believe. It's also challenging to watch Will Farrell be so restrained, and yet I now realize what a brilliant acting job he does, because his character IS so restrained. I desperately wanted him to break out of this ""normal"" character and be zany, and maybe that's why the director chose him, because audiences expect him to be this wild life-embracing character we've seen him portray time and time again. But here he plays an average Joe who has consigned himself to life's mundanity. And when he does decide to try to break from his mold, it's in a quiet way. I'm still taking in this nuanced performance, because it really was lovely.The film itself has many wonderful performances: Emma Thompson is simply brilliant. Queen Latifah is a rock of support, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is gorgeously incandescent. She is the shining light of this piece.The message of how we create our lives and the choices we make was gloriously strong, and my first response upon the film's end was that I wanted to see it again.

I had no idea what to expect, and it was a nice movie. I am not entirely sure why, but I rather enjoyed the creative and quirky plotline.Harold Crick, (Ferrell), is an IRS agent who is pretty much ruled by numbers and is a bit of a whizz at maths. His relatively normal life gets a shift into left field when he starts hearing a voice narrate his life in his head. The narrator is author Karen Eiffel, (Thompson), whose latest novel revolves around the main character, Harold Crick. Harold's attempts to deal with the voice and his life are the unfolding story.With a cast of pretty famous faces, ""Stranger than Fiction"" poses some interesting questions and hyoptheticals to think about. It is a creative and interesting premise that had a lot of potential for exploitation, which I think the movie did rather well.I was, like another reviewer, a bit disappointed with the end. It seemed a little forced, though I will not spoil the ending for other potential viewers. I just thought a variant ending would have worked in better with the movie's overall direction.That issue aside, I thought it was a fine movie, and one of Will Ferrell's better ones.

The story is about Harold Crick (Ferrell), a rather lonely and way too fastidious IRS agent. Harold lives an unremarkable life, ruled by his wristwatch, until one day, he begins hearing a voice in his head (Emma Thompson). The voice quite accurately narrates everything he is doing and thinking. At first, Harold considers this simply a nuisance. That is, until the voice mentions his ""imminent death."" (That catches his attention.) Harold immediately begins to try and figure out who the voice is and how he can avoid his sad fate. He goes to Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), a literature teacher, for help. Together, he and Jules identify that he's in a tragedy written by a reculsive (and nearly suicidal) author. Harold tracks down his author, introduces himself as her main character, and begs for his life.When this movie came out, I remember hearing (and thinking) that it sounded eerily reminscent of The Truman Show, but I was wrong, wrong. It is quirkier, and I think ultimately better. It's about the creative process - the author creates a character that is VERY real, and then she is faced with killing this person. And is she really just writing these novels (in which the main character ALWAYS dies) as a way to deal with her own self-destructive tendencies? And, were she to save Harold Crick, what would that mean? Her novel (the story) would fall apart, but Harold would live. I saw a brief interview with the director, and he said he thought the movie was about saving lives - how people save each other's lives every day by doing little things that open up their worlds and encourage people to really live.It was an interesting, entertaining, superbly-cast film, and I encourage you to see it as soon as possible.

1041453,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B000LXH0AE,One More Option,"[7, 7]","This is a movie about an author's choices, and how they effect her life and the lives of those around her.  The casting is perfect.  The tone of each acting performance is sublime.  The plot is not intended to amaze as much as it is intended to inspire.  The title to this review is a quote by Maggie Gyllenhaal's character, Ann Pascal, who attended Harvard Law School, but realized she was appreciated as a baker, and decided her life's work would be tweaking great recipes and fashioning pleasing baked goods.Will Ferrell plays Harold Click, an ordinary, unremarkable person.  Ferrell plays the role straight, unlike the other ""type"" roles he has been associated with.  He never winks at the camera or breaks character, and he never goes for the ""cute"" or ""sappy.""  He proves his acting chops and shows his amazing intelligence to imbue a character with pathos.""Harold, you miss the point.  The intent is to break the rules,"" Ann tells Harold, after he innocently suggests to her a way she can use a loophole to avoid breaking the tax laws she is intentionally protesting.  Harold knows her design and intent, but he still wants to keep her out of harm's way.  He knows he is making decisions that will lead to his death a few hours later, and he chooses to spend his final hours trying to help her, an innocent boy, and another friend from work in the best ways he can think of.The movie asks questions like:  If you knew you had to die in order save another person's life, would you?  If you knew you were not going to live for very long, would you treat anyone around you differently?  And if ""greatness"" required you to write a good person out of your story, would you?Emma Thompson's character, Kay Eiffel, is extraordinarily talented and has always been able to write beautiful tragic novels.  But her ability to craft tragedies becomes more difficult as she gets older and learns more about her characters and the characters around her.  She struggles with whether she still wants to craft her tragedies, or whether she will break the rules in order to avoid them.Some people are like Harold Crick.  They are not extremely talented and they don't control major parts of their own fate.  But even when they know their ending will likely be tragic, they do what they can do, and they bring assorted flours to people who can create, can bake, are talented, and have the ability to change the world.Roger Ebert wrote an excellent review, as always, of this movie (3.5 stars), titled ""Who's telling your life story?""  I respect that as Roger Ebert has battled serious, life-threatening illness, he has placed higher priority on his life's work, writing quality film reviews, than on appearing on television.  I love Roger Ebert.  He cares about movies, ideas, and thoughtful criticism.  He puts his time and heart where his long term, universal focuses are.  He says that ""Such an uncommonly intelligent film does not often get made. It could have pumped up its emotion to blockbuster level, but that would be false to the premise, which requires us to enter the lives of these specific quiet, sweet, worthy people.""",5,"""I just figured if I was going to change the world, I'd do it with cookies.

1041454,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000LXH0AE,Only-A-Child,"[2, 2]","""Stranger Than Fiction"" (2006) fits into the tiny sub-genre of recent ""the tax-man needs love too"" films, which includes ""Exotica"" (1994) and ""Off the Map"" (2003). And since nothing of real consequence happens in this moral tale of a film, you could make a case for it being like Eric Rohmer's ""My Night With Maude"" (insert sequences of serio-comic triviality here). Although I can see why some people compare it to ""The Hours"" (2002) it is really a variation on ""Adaptation"" (2002) and its various allegorical elements.As in ""Adaptation"" you have a stalled character going to a literary professional for advice. Instead of troubled screenwriter Charlie Kaufman seeking advice from adaptation guru Robert McKee, you have IRS agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) contacting literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Which serves as an excuse to utilize a vast store of insider jokes about screen writing/fiction writing.Maggie Gyllenhaal was in both films. In ""Stranger Than Fiction"" she plays Harold's love interest, Ana Pascal, the irreverent owner of a bakery. This is one of the all-time best film romances and it owes a lot Director Marc Forster's casting of these two actors. It's a quirky and sideways path to romance and is sold by Ferrell's trademark lack of guile and Gyllenhaal's way of teasing a role.As in ""Adaptation"" the wrapped too tight hero might be schizophrenic; but instead of a fast living unpretentious twin brother, Harold hears a woman author's narration in his head; and she is narrating a highly accurate account of Harold's day-to-day existence. The voice is actually that of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a slightly suicidal author struggling with writer's block. Her prior books have all ended with the death of her main character (insert ""The Hours"" here) and she is struggling with just how to dispatch Harold in the book she is currently writing. Harold is clued to his ultimate fate when her narration uses the phrase ""little did he know"". Both Kay and Jules nicely display the dichotomy between the passion of their creativity and the reserve of their analysis and critique.Once he knows his fate Harold begins making positive changes in his life style, which culminates in his romance with Ana. So you get the standard ""stop and smell the roses"" theme, a bit of a ""free will vs destiny"" theme, and finally the principal question: If the novel Kay is writing would be a masterpiece only if it ends in Harold's death, what right does he have continue his life? And the secondary question once Kay understands the implications of a tragic ending: Can she assume the responsibility of sacrificing another life as the necessary cost of producing a masterpiece?The production design in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is nothing to get excited about but it does not distract from the story. There is some distraction by the effects people who periodically overlay cute little graphics to illustrate Harold compulsive need to count things and set things in order. But it is all in the service of  character development.Then again, what do I know?

1041457,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000LXH0AE,Peter Shermeta,"[2, 3]","Will Ferrell is Harold Crick, an auditor for the IRS whose life could hardly be more routine and mundane. As he adheres strictly to that routine he begins to hear a woman's voice. She does not tell him what to do, but rather she offers a detached, third-party narration as he goes about his day. With the help of a professor of literature, who is deemed to be more helpful than his psychiatrist, Harold is able to solve the mystery of the voice's origin. But what he finds may not be what he wants to hear.I was skeptical -- at the very least -- of Will Ferrell's involvement in this movie. While not altogether a ""serious"" movie, I still felt that this role might be too much for him. As it turns out, I was wrong. I was worried that he would try too hard to shun his class-clown nature to be more adaptable to a wide range of film. He was very likeable in this role, but I would not say that he was great. I just don't think the part was that strong, but he did well enough in it.Emma Thompson was excellent in her neurosis as she was deconstructed by her writer's block.Maggie Gyllenhaal has been a tough nut to crack for me. In the few performances of hers that I have seen, she has seemingly played the same character over and over. I felt she brought that same character to Stranger Than Fiction, but it just fit better here than in other movies. Because of that, or whatever else, Maggie was at her most charming in Stranger Than Fiction.With all of these performances from a cast of notable names, the highlight was Dustin Hoffman. Looking back at the film's credits I guess I can't be too surprised that Hoffman stole the show, but I guess I hadn't expected it. He was funny, intelligent, mysterious, compassionate, quirky...he was all over the place. And he was great.There was an arguably unnecessary visual effect used for most of the movie. To really hammer home how Harold Crick's mechanical and mathematical mind worked, the movie continuously featured on-screen effects to show protracted angles, measurements and percentages. The movie probably didn't need these effects, but I loved them. They were an added emphasis on the attention to detail which I appreciate so much.I am not sure if it was in any way related to my expecting so little from this movie, but I really loved Stranger Than Fiction. The story was incredibly creative and everyone who contributed, both cast and crew, made it an enjoyable movie to watch.

In the course of the movie-novel, Crick undergoes something of an awakening, the character of which has a bittersweet quality because of foreshadowing of Crick's death at the conclusion of the novel.  Some of themes pursued are the nature of art and free will versus determinism.  This is generally done well, though the film is a bit too much of a conventional romantic comedy.

1041464,AAC2GHQF1TG4I,B000LXH0AE,"Ramon Thomas ""Professional Speaker""","[0, 0]","This is story of ordinary man who becomes involved in an extraordinary tale. Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS Agent who lives a monotonous and mundane life. But one day starts hearing the voice of a women with an British accent narrating his life. He really wakes up to the reality of the situation when the narrator says that he will die. After seeking some help from a psychologist and eventually a literature professor, Jules Hilbert, played by the ever brilliant Dustin Hoffman, he begins to explore a life he only dreamed of living. And as with all the best stories there is a love story at the epicentre of this tale.Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the contemptuous and rowdy Ana Pascal, a direct opposite of Harold Crick. She tempts him, teases him and confronts him. They begin a love affair that drives Harold's life into new territory. Because he actually begins to care about his life. He enjoys is now because he is living his dreams. And he is having an adventure.Some of the best moments in this film is when Professor Hilbert instructs him to determine certain outcomes. Like whether he is in a comedy or a tragedy. And also whether he is in control of the plot or the writer/narrator. And while he spends the whole day in his house, not even going to the bathroom or answering the phone, the dreaded answer is revealed. A crane smashes through his living room as the complex is about to be demolished. The conclusion - it turns out the writer is in control and Harold has to accept his destiny.There is moments of madness, moments of laughter, and moments of angst coupled with beautiful cinematography in this film. And it reminded me so much ofThe Truman Show (Special Collector's Edition)Truman Show with Jim Carrey.Anyway this is a film that stretches the imagination just a little bit. You may discover you are in fact the writer of your own destiny. So like Harold Crick take action. Don't wait until it's to late.

Just wonderful all around and a great, impressive movie.Now, I found the story even more interesting because I am a writer. Not only because the movie deals with an author and his/her characters but it also illustrates how Harold is a character written by an author and neither of them have much of a life. Both are people who go about their lives but don't really live. Hell, the author spends her time thinking about death more than life. It's funny, romantic (in a very real and strange way - no canned romantic lines but a very real feeling interaction between two very real characters), touching, visually interesting, a little fantastical, and all around perfect.I really liked this movie a lot.

1041468,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B000LXH0AE,R. Kyle,"[1, 1]","Why else do you think writers write?  Probably one of the ultimate dreams is having their worlds come to life. The theme's been addressed in book, song, and film. First time I encountered this phenomena was ""Typewriter"" by L. Ron Hubbard, a story where the protagonist did his best to take over the story.  ""Where Failure Goes"" is a 70's song by Rupert Holmes which talks about where the characters from his failed songs ended up.  ""Stranger than Fiction,"" carries on that theme.Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS agent, who lives by the numbers, from counting how many times he brushes each of his thirty-two teeth twice a day, to how many seconds he saves tying a single Windsor knot instead of a double each day (43, according to his watch, which bears silent witness to Crick's life every day and personally thinks the double would look better on him).  When Crick starts to hear voices, he contacts a shrink, who tells him he's schizophrenic.  Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffmann) a notable expert on literature has a different take on Crick's experience based on four words he can remember...""Little did he know...""Since this is third-person omniscient, Crick may well be the character in a novel and the narrator he's hearing is a novelist. The prof designs a 23 question survey to determine who is writing the story. Crick only has a matter of time, because the narrator has revealed to him that he's going to die.Meanwhile, Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) can't seem to finish her contractual obligations.  She's sent an aide from the publisher (Queen Latifah) who works to break the logjam of her writer's block so she can kill her character and get the book published.The result is a funny, very revealing look at writers and the way they write and think.  This movie took a bit for me to warm up to.  In my opinion, the front portion of the film is somewhat slow to set up and grab your attention, but once it does, you want to know what's going to happen to both Crick and Eiffel.  This is definitely worth a watch if you are a writer, enjoy the process, or just like something really different once in a while.",4,Writers are control freaks...,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,2118,"['Why', 'else', 'do', 'think', 'writers', 'write', 'Probably', 'one', 'ultimate', 'dreams', 'having', 'worlds', 'come', 'life', 'theme', 'been', 'addressed', 'book', 'song', 'film', 'First', 'time', 'encountered', 'phenomena', 'was', 'Typewriter', 'L.', 'Ron', 'Hubbard', 'story', 'where', 'protagonist', 'did', 'best', 'take', 'over', 'story', 'Where', 'Failure', 'Goes', '70', 'song', 'Rupert', 'Holmes', 'where', 'characters', 'failed', 'songs', 'ended', 'up', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'theme.Harold', 'Crick', 'Ferrell', 'IRS', 'agent', 'who', 'numbers', 'counting', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'thirty-two', 'teeth', 'twice', 'day', 'how', 'many', 'seconds', 'tying', 'single', 'Windsor', 'knot', 'instead', 'double', 'day', '43', 'according', 'watch', 'silent', 'witness', 'Crick', 'life', 'day', 'personally', 'double', 'would', 'look', 'better', 'When', 'Crick', 'hear', 'voices', 'shrink', 'who', 'schizophrenic', 'Dr.', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Dustin', 'Hoffmann', 'notable', 'expert', 'literature', 'different', 'take', 'Crick', 'experience', 'based', 'four', 'words', 'can', 'remember', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'third-person', 'omniscient', 'Crick', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'character', 'novel', 'narrator', 'hearing', 'novelist', 'prof', '23', 'question', 'survey', 'determine', 'who', 'writing', 'story', 'Crick', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'narrator', 'revealed', 'going', 'die.Meanwhile', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'finish', 'contractual', 'obligations', 'sent', 'aide', 'publisher', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'break', 'logjam', 'writer', 'block', 'can', 'kill', 'character', 'get', 'book', 'published.The', 'result', 'funny', 'very', 'revealing', 'look', 'writers', 'way', 'write', 'think', 'movie', 'took', 'bit', 'warm', 'up', 'opinion', 'front', 'portion', 'film', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'set', 'up', 'grab', 'attention', 'once', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Crick', 'Eiffel', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'are', 'writer', 'enjoy', 'process', 'just', 'something', 'really', 'different', 'once', 'while']",N/A

Emma Thompson plays a novelist who is attempting to finish a novel, but she continues to have problems with the ending. Enter Will Ferrell. He starts to hear a voice when he is brushing his teeth. It is the writers' voice he hears. He doesn't know where the voice is coming from, but he is determined to find out.Marc Forster, who directed Johnny Depp to an Oscar nomination in 'Finding Neverland', clearly works well with actors. Thompson, Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal (excellent as Ferrell's girlfriend), Dustin Hoffman (Ferrell' mentor), and Queen Lativah all give great performances (even Tom Hulce and Linda Hunt have effective cameos).I was reading some of the negative reactions to this film. Forget that Forster directed the Oscar nominated 'Finding Neverland'. Forget that Forster directed the Oscar-winning 'Monster's Ball'. 'Stranger than Fiction is truly one of the best films of 2006. Maybe those viewers need to watch this marvelous film a second time. The script, and Ferrell should have been nominated for Oscars.Those of you who are familiar with Ferrell's work knows he tends to chew the scenery most of the time. But this is not Ferrell who you're used to. But after watching 'Stranger Than Fiction', I really believed in his 'ficticious' character. It's a sad but comical performance.Remember how Jim Carrey was ignored by the Academy for his performance in 'The Truman Show' (even though he was nominated for a Golden Globe), Ferrell was also nominated for a Golden Globe, and ignored.For those who didn't like STF, you may want to give it a second chance and allow it to grow on you. It sports one of the best scripts in some time (certainly not since 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' have we seen it's like - hey, didn't 'Eternal' win for best screenplay).This movie, unlike most of today's garbage - I hate to sound harsh, but it's true - will challenge you.

1041471,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000LXH0AE,Roland E. Zwick,"[14, 25]","***1/2Like many a successful comic before him, Will Ferrell goes for his own ""Truman Show""-like bid at legitimacy with ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" a high concept comedy/drama, written by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Foster, about a man who discovers that he's actually a fictional character in an author's yet unfinished novel.Harold Crick is a straight-arrow, stuffed-shirt IRS agent who lives a life of highly regimented solitude completely cut off from any real social interaction with the people around him.  One day he begins hearing the voice of an unidentified woman portentously intoning the details of each of his actions as he goes about the business of living out his daily life.  As it turns out, the voice belongs to Kay Eiffel, a neurotic, reclusive novelist who is suffering from severe writer's block as she attempts to complete her latest work of literary fiction.  Blissfully unaware that the character she has created has actually taken form as a flesh-and-blood human being, Eiffel plots ways to kill him off in the final scene.  When Harold finally figures out what is happening to him, he seeks advice from a local English professor (Dustin Hoffman) who comes to believe Harold's bizarre predicament and tries to help him avoid his preordained fate before it's too late.Highly reminiscent of such reality-bending movies as ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" among others, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" earns points for pushing the envelope in terms of storytelling, but its themes - of a man finding meaning in his humdrum existence and of an author realizing that preserving real life is more important than preserving art - are so retrograde and shopworn at this late date that the movie comes across as far less cutting-edge and innovative than its post-modernist premise would lead one to expect.  There are some very sharp and amusing moments in the film, but often we feel as if the movie's creators found themselves at a loss as to what to do with the clever idea once they came up with it.  In short, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" feels more like an outline for a movie than a fully worked-out film in its own right.Nevertheless, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is worth seeing for the low-keyed performance by Farrell who never steps out of character as the socially backward but essentially warmhearted schnook Eiffel has invented for her printed page.  The resplendent Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the tax-cheating ultra-liberal storeowner whom Harold is sent to audit and who opens his eyes to the possibility of true love for the first time in his ""life.""  Their scenes together are genuinely well-played, touching and romantic.  With her stiff-upper-lip British accent and crisp enunciation, Thompson is perfect as the frazzled narrator and author desperate to break through her writer's block and bring closure to her literary creation.  Queen Latifah effectively underplays the role of the rational assistant sent to help Eiffel find a way to kill off her character, while Hoffman, in a wonderfully playful mood, gets to deliver most of the screenplay's funniest lines.There's a great deal of poignancy in the final act as Eiffel has to decide between literally killing off her creation to preserve her work or letting her creation live even if that means spoiling a potential literary masterpiece.  It is at this moment that Eiffel learns the true burden of being God - or at least the demi-god that artists automatically become through the nature of their work. It's a shame that the movie slouches along for so much of its running time on its way to the finale.",3,interesting idea that feels underdeveloped,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,3639,"['***1/2Like', 'many', 'successful', 'comic', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'own', 'Truman', 'Show', 'bid', 'legitimacy', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'high', 'concept', 'comedy/drama', 'written', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'directed', 'Marc', 'Foster', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'fictional', 'character', 'author', 'yet', 'unfinished', 'novel.Harold', 'Crick', 'straight-arrow', 'stuffed-shirt', 'IRS', 'agent', 'who', 'life', 'highly', 'regimented', 'solitude', 'completely', 'cut', 'off', 'real', 'social', 'interaction', 'people', 'One', 'day', 'hearing', 'voice', 'unidentified', 'woman', 'portentously', 'intoning', 'details', 'actions', 'business', 'living', 'out', 'daily', 'life', 'out', 'voice', 'belongs', 'Kay', 'Eiffel', 'neurotic', 'reclusive', 'novelist', 'who', 'suffering', 'severe', 'writer', 'block', 'complete', 'latest', 'work', 'literary', 'fiction', 'Blissfully', 'unaware', 'character', 'created', 'actually', 'taken', 'form', 'flesh-and-blood', 'human', 'being', 'Eiffel', 'plots', 'ways', 'kill', 'off', 'final', 'scene', 'When', 'Harold', 'finally', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'advice', 'local', 'English', 'professor', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'believe', 'Harold', 'bizarre', 'predicament', 'tries', 'help', 'avoid', 'preordained', 'fate', 'too', 'late.Highly', 'reminiscent', 'such', 'reality-bending', 'movies', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Adaptation', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'others', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'points', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'terms', 'storytelling', 'themes', 'man', 'finding', 'meaning', 'humdrum', 'existence', 'author', 'realizing', 'preserving', 'real', 'life', 'more', 'important', 'preserving', 'art', 'are', 'so', 'retrograde', 'shopworn', 'late', 'date', 'movie', 'across', 'far', 'less', 'cutting-edge', 'innovative', 'post-modernist', 'premise', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'expect', 'are', 'very', 'sharp', 'amusing', 'moments', 'film', 'often', 'feel', 'movie', 'creators', 'found', 'loss', 'what', 'do', 'clever', 'idea', 'once', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'feels', 'more', 'outline', 'movie', 'fully', 'worked-out', 'film', 'own', 'right.Nevertheless', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'worth', 'seeing', 'low-keyed', 'performance', 'Farrell', 'who', 'never', 'character', 'socially', 'backward', 'essentially', 'warmhearted', 'schnook', 'Eiffel', 'invented', 'printed', 'page', 'resplendent', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'tax-cheating', 'ultra-liberal', 'storeowner', 'whom', 'Harold', 'sent', 'audit', 'who', 'eyes', 'possibility', 'true', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'genuinely', 'well-played', 'touching', 'romantic', 'stiff-upper-lip', 'British', 'accent', 'crisp', 'enunciation', 'Thompson', 'perfect', 'frazzled', 'narrator', 'author', 'desperate', 'break', 'writer', 'block', 'bring', 'closure', 'literary', 'creation', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'effectively', 'role', 'rational', 'assistant', 'sent', 'help', 'Eiffel', 'find', 'way', 'kill', 'off', 'character', 'Hoffman', 'wonderfully', 'playful', 'mood', 'deliver', 'most', 'screenplay', 'funniest', 'lines.There', 'great', 'deal', 'poignancy', 'final', 'act', 'Eiffel', 'decide', 'literally', 'killing', 'off', 'creation', 'preserve', 'work', 'letting', 'creation', 'live', 'even', 'spoiling', 'potential', 'literary', 'masterpiece', 'moment', 'Eiffel', 'true', 'burden', 'being', 'God', 'least', 'demi-god', 'automatically', 'become', 'nature', 'work', 'shame', 'movie', 'along', 'so', 'much', 'running', 'time', 'way', 'finale']",N/A

Martel""","[0, 0]","Stranger Than Fiction has an interesting premise; that some of us are only characters in a book being written by a writer who has no idea that we are real.  However instead of taking this for a dark spin (like ""Secret Window"" or ""The Dark Half"") director Marc Forster spins it into a drama with comic overtones.His cast is up to the challenge.  Will Farrell plays the likable but kinda clueless Harold Crick.  Its an everyman role, but Farrell adds subtle nuances that make the character real.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is excellent as the spunky Ana Pascal.  Her chemistry with Farrell makes their romantic entanglements believable.  Emma Thompson as the writer Karen Eiffel, does an impeccable job of playing the eccentric and tortured artist.  Of course the film has plenty of great supporting actors like Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Tom Hulce, Linda Hunt, and Tony Hale in a great part as Harold's nerdy friend Dave.The script is well written and thought out.  The direction works very well.  Pacing was a little slow, but I think I was deceived by the commercials that give the impression that this is a hilarious comedy.  Parts of it are funny, but the movie is more of a drama, and Farrell's acting skills suit both parts well.  The score and soundtrack are also memorable and fit the movie like a glove.All in all, I was completely entertained by the movie.  It proves that Farrell can jump into more dramatic roles (if he cares to).

1041474,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000LXH0AE,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","Will Ferrell is Harold crick, an astoundingly precise and boring man who inexplicably finds that he's become the protagonist of a tragic masterpiece.  Working at the IRS, Will is a savant of numbers (his favorite word is ""integer"").  And then, without any warning, he comes to hear the words of a narrator, one who describes his life as he knows it (""but with a better vocabulary"", he tells a sympathetic psychiatrist).  We soon learn that the voice belongs to a reclusive and morose author named Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who suffers from writer's block and has know idea that the victim of her latest stillborn book is a living, breathing and wholly non-fictitious man.  How Eiffel has bridged the chasm between the fictional and the real (lets put aside the myriad puns here) is the least of Her and Crick's problems.  Eiffel is obsessed with tragedy, which requires her books to end in death.  Even before Crick identifies his executioner, he's already learned of his pending (if unspecified) death.Unable to accept a psychological reason for his problem, he finds a college writing professor who (after some initial reservations) agrees to help Crick identify what kind of book he's in and perhaps avert an otherwise inevitably tragic end.  Played by Dustin Hoffman, Jules Hilbert boils Cricks' predicament down to either comedy or tragedy.  (Though facing death, working at the IRS skews things toward comedy.)  Not content to let the plot just come to him, Harold takes his quickly ending life by the horns - taking a vacation, learning how to play the guitar and hooking up with the victim of one his latest audits, a brash anarchist baker named Ana Pascal.  (Played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Ana seems determined to withhold %22 of her income taxes, the amount she generously believes goes to corporate bailouts and defense spending rather than building parks and filling potholes.)WHAT WE THOUGHT: ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a beguiling work, which is the polite way of saying that we had no idea whether to like it or not.The idea of being the unwilling hero of a tragic novel by an oblivious author is an fascinating idea, but the holes in the conceit are soon revealed: Kay knows everything about Harold except for the part about Harold that knows that he's being ""protagonized"", and is oblivious about how much of her plot is driven by the fact of her narrative.  (In a great scene, Kay writes of Harold ""Cursing the heavens in futility""; ""No I'm not! I'm cursing you, you stupid voice!"")  This becomes a plot hole when Harold responds by making life changes reflected in Kay's work, even though Kay has no idea that Harold is in on it.  The phrase ""little did he know"" used by Kay becomes a major plot point because Harold soon finds himself knowing more than Kay does.  Hilbert is a fun character, though the script makes him uninteresting for a big chunk of it, though giving him some of the weightiest and profound observations by the end.  ""You have to die"", he tells Harold - everybody dies, but the story will go on.  The script wisely goes further than you'd expect for a Hollywood movie - with Harold motivated to fall in love with Ana and otherwise shake off his stultifying anticlimactic life.  These things do happen, but ""Stranger than Fiction"" is smarter than that, becoming a meditation on why writers narrow stories down to either tragic or comic, and the ends that they will go to stay within those bounds.  The major flaw of the story is that the concept (man learns he's a doomed fictitious character, and responds) is funnier and more engaging in the flick's first half.  Billed as a comedy, even its funnier moments are droll and slow.WHAT WE LOVED.  Even when the story loses its steam, we still have great characters and great actors living them.  Gyllenhaal is great as Ana, compulsively combative as much as lovable.  Like one of her cookies, she's yummy and crunchy at the same time.  Will Ferrell is also a revelation as Crick - it's a world away from his other manic characters, and Ferrell inhabits him perfectly.I may never decide whether I hated this flick or not, but I gave it four stars because, unlike other movies, I will never regret the time I spent watching it.",4,A tragic-comic meditation on laughing at sad people,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,4211,"['Will', 'Ferrell', 'Harold', 'crick', 'astoundingly', 'precise', 'boring', 'man', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'become', 'protagonist', 'tragic', 'masterpiece', 'Working', 'IRS', 'Will', 'savant', 'numbers', 'favorite', 'word', 'integer', 'then', 'warning', 'hear', 'words', 'narrator', 'one', 'who', 'life', 'better', 'vocabulary', 'sympathetic', 'psychiatrist', 'soon', 'learn', 'voice', 'belongs', 'reclusive', 'morose', 'author', 'named', 'Kay', 'Eiffel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'writer', 'block', 'know', 'idea', 'victim', 'latest', 'stillborn', 'book', 'living', 'breathing', 'wholly', 'non-fictitious', 'man', 'How', 'Eiffel', 'bridged', 'chasm', 'fictional', 'real', 'lets', 'put', 'aside', 'myriad', 'here', 'least', 'Her', 'Crick', 'problems', 'Eiffel', 'obsessed', 'tragedy', 'books', 'end', 'death', 'Even', 'Crick', 'executioner', 'already', 'learned', 'pending', 'unspecified', 'death.Unable', 'accept', 'psychological', 'reason', 'problem', 'college', 'writing', 'professor', 'who', 'initial', 'reservations', 'help', 'Crick', 'identify', 'what', 'kind', 'book', 'perhaps', 'avert', 'otherwise', 'inevitably', 'tragic', 'end', 'Played', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Cricks', 'predicament', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'facing', 'death', 'working', 'IRS', 'things', 'comedy', 'Not', 'content', 'let', 'plot', 'just', 'come', 'Harold', 'quickly', 'ending', 'life', 'horns', 'taking', 'vacation', 'learning', 'how', 'play', 'guitar', 'hooking', 'up', 'victim', 'one', 'latest', 'audits', 'brash', 'anarchist', 'baker', 'named', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Played', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Ana', 'determined', 'withhold', '%', '22', 'income', 'taxes', 'amount', 'generously', 'corporate', 'bailouts', 'defense', 'spending', 'rather', 'building', 'parks', 'filling', 'potholes', 'WHAT', 'WE', 'THOUGHT', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'beguiling', 'work', 'polite', 'way', 'saying', 'had', 'idea', 'like', 'not.The', 'idea', 'being', 'unwilling', 'hero', 'tragic', 'novel', 'oblivious', 'author', 'fascinating', 'idea', 'holes', 'conceit', 'are', 'soon', 'revealed', 'Kay', 'everything', 'Harold', 'part', 'Harold', 'being', 'protagonized', 'oblivious', 'how', 'much', 'plot', 'driven', 'fact', 'narrative', 'great', 'scene', 'Kay', 'Harold', 'Cursing', 'heavens', 'futility', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', ""'m"", 'cursing', 'stupid', 'voice', 'plot', 'hole', 'when', 'Harold', 'making', 'life', 'changes', 'reflected', 'Kay', 'work', 'even', 'Kay', 'idea', 'Harold', 'phrase', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'used', 'Kay', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'Harold', 'soon', 'knowing', 'more', 'Kay', 'Hilbert', 'fun', 'character', 'script', 'uninteresting', 'big', 'chunk', 'giving', 'weightiest', 'profound', 'observations', 'end', 'have', 'die', 'Harold', 'everybody', 'story', 'will', 'go', 'script', 'wisely', 'further', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Harold', 'motivated', 'fall', 'love', 'Ana', 'otherwise', 'shake', 'off', 'stultifying', 'anticlimactic', 'life', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'smarter', 'becoming', 'meditation', 'why', 'writers', 'narrow', 'stories', 'down', 'tragic', 'comic', 'ends', 'will', 'go', 'stay', 'bounds', 'major', 'flaw', 'story', 'concept', 'man', 'doomed', 'fictitious', 'character', 'responds', 'funnier', 'more', 'engaging', 'flick', 'first', 'half', 'Billed', 'comedy', 'even', 'funnier', 'moments', 'are', 'droll', 'slow.WHAT', 'WE', 'LOVED', 'Even', 'when', 'story', 'steam', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'actors', 'living', 'Gyllenhaal', 'great', 'Ana', 'compulsively', 'combative', 'as', 'much', 'lovable', 'one', 'cookies', 'yummy', 'crunchy', 'same', 'time', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'also', 'revelation', 'Crick', 'world', 'away', 'other', 'manic', 'characters', 'Ferrell', 'perfectly.I', 'may', 'never', 'decide', 'hated', 'flick', 'not', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'because', 'other', 'movies', 'will', 'never', 'regret', 'time', 'spent', 'watching']",N/A

Here we have Will Ferrell playing the generic everyman.  He has no life, no direction, and no goal.  This is a morality play where Ferrell shows character and integrity and eventually heroism.  Emma Thompson in a voice over performs as the Greek Chorus and then as the Author she plays the Goddess who uses Ferrell as a pawn.  Dustin Hoffman plays another God who reviews Ferrell's pleas for mercy and help but decides that Ferrell must die because his death would be glorious.  In the meantime the Goddess gives Ferrell the future and love that he desires but like in any Greek Tragedy the Gods raise up those whom they would destroy so Ferrell's fate is sealed.  However, like Hector he is given the choice to avoid his fate or to be the Hero and die a hero's death.  At the end we are told that the man (like Hector) who knows he is going to die but still does his duty is truly a hero.This is an excellent film.  It is unusual and has a few semi-funny scenes but it isn't a comedy but then is the death of a true hero a tragedy?  I think this was a very good film and I recommend it highly.

I was right to want to see it, I found it to be amazing.The story being narrated sounded like a really good story and the way the character tries to find out what kind of a story he is in is funny and interesting.  My boyfriend's mom thought the character of the writer, played by Emma Thompson, was too strange to comprehend.  To me she seemed familiar.  The weird ways in which she tries to understand her writing and the torture of a ten-year writer's block all seems comfortable and normal to me.  I recognize myself in her as well as other writers I have known.The most amazing part is the idea that her character is a real person, existing in the same world that she does.  If you have not written fiction then I can probably never explain to you the feeling that the characters you are writing about are real people.  Most people, though, have at least tried writing, so maybe you do know what I mean.  They come to me almost fully formed, asking me to tell their story, to share their story with others.  I often feel on the very edge of sanity as these imaginary people speak to me and share their lives with me.  Any failing in my writing is through my own ability and not because of them.  Even if they do not exist in the same sense that you and I do, they are still real. This movie understands that.It also explores the interesting idea of what price artistic integrity might come at.  Is the story more important than everything else?I doubt that people who have never had the urge to write fiction will like this movie.  And it should be noted that this is not the typical Will Ferrel movie.  He won't be zany and weird as he is in so many other films, but he will also play his more serious role a lot better than he did in Bewitched.",5,Captures the writer's experience,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,1900,"['boyfriend', 'mom', 'house', 'yesterday', 'finally', 'saw', 'movie', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'wanted', 'see', 'as', 'soon', 'first', 'saw', 'ad', 'was', 'right', 'want', 'see', 'found', 'be', 'amazing.The', 'story', 'being', 'narrated', 'sounded', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'way', 'character', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'kind', 'story', 'funny', 'interesting', 'boyfriend', 'mom', 'thought', 'character', 'writer', 'played', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'was', 'too', 'strange', 'comprehend', 'seemed', 'familiar', 'weird', 'ways', 'understand', 'writing', 'torture', 'ten-year', 'writer', 'block', 'comfortable', 'normal', 'recognize', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'writers', 'have', 'known.The', 'most', 'amazing', 'part', 'idea', 'character', 'real', 'person', 'existing', 'same', 'world', 'have', 'not', 'written', 'fiction', 'then', 'can', 'probably', 'never', 'explain', 'feeling', 'characters', 'are', 'writing', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'Most', 'people', 'though', 'have', 'least', 'tried', 'writing', 'so', 'maybe', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'come', 'almost', 'fully', 'formed', 'asking', 'tell', 'story', 'share', 'story', 'others', 'often', 'feel', 'very', 'edge', 'sanity', 'imaginary', 'people', 'speak', 'share', 'lives', 'failing', 'writing', 'own', 'ability', 'not', 'Even', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'same', 'sense', 'do', 'are', 'still', 'real', 'movie', 'that.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'idea', 'what', 'price', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'might', 'come', 'story', 'more', 'important', 'everything', 'else', 'doubt', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'urge', 'write', 'fiction', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'not', 'typical', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'zany', 'weird', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'will', 'also', 'play', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'lot', 'better', 'did', 'Bewitched']",N/A
1041481,A6FIAB28IS79,B000LXH0AE,Samuel Chell,"[1, 8]","Less a story or cinematic experience, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is scarcely more than a flimsy premise for a weak romantic comedy, ultimately distinguished by a didactic voice-over that seems to go on moralizing forever at the film's end.  As a romantic comedy, the film succeeds to the degree the viewer finds Harold Crick's life story as interesting as Will Farrell's persona.  To reviewers not particularly drawn to  Farrell's understated role, his conflict between a life controlled by a digital wrist watch vs. one proceeding from his own free and autonomous will is what the film comes down to.  Of course, as a parable it attempts to make some ""deeper"" statement about the tragic narratives we regrettably mistake for the banality of actual living which, though no more profound than a bad rock & roll lyric, is something we can be grateful for: after all, it's ""real life.""  Deal with it, and forget about living the fictionalized existence of some protagonist in a heightened, tragic drama. (It's at this point that the screenplay tries--far too hard and to an embarrassing degree--to excuse itself from looking ""anti-cultural."")For some viewers, Harold's salvation from his automated routine will be sufficient pay-off to make his mundane existence (now spiced up by his slightly wild and tattooed but sweet, newfound love) seem exceedingly preferable to the extermination of the artist and her pretentious fictional ""masterpieces.""  But certainly there is nothing in the film more believable and disturbing than the self-destructive, neurotic-verging-on-psychotic Emma Thompson (she's Peter O'Toole more hung over than usual!) as the ""great author""--until she shows up at the end of the film cleaned-up, repentant, well-groomed and gentle spoken--saved, presumably, from her own creative vices.The moral of the story?  Simply this: ""you're lucky to be alive.""  And that's more than you could say for Lear, Othello, Macbeth, Hamlet, and Butterfly, all of whom are killed off by their creators.  As far as movies go, this one is to literature what ""Patch Adams"" was to medicine.  Stop being a hi-brow or a fuddy-duddy.

1041482,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000LXH0AE,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 8]","It's hard not to smile at ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" a sweet-smelling potpourri of dry comedy, romance and ""get-busy-livin'"" philosophy. I wanted to dislike it for its faulty logic and gimme-a-hug sentiment, but it's just too well-executed to be trapped by its shortcomings.I laughed (a little) and rooted for Will Ferrell to get the girl. On this day, in this cinematic wasteland, it'll do. Think of it as a witty chaser to the craziness of ""Borat.""Ferrell is Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who has reduced his life to numbers: brushstrokes on his teeth, steps to the bus stop. Director Marc Forster cleverly illustrates Harold's fixation with helpful white graphics that flash before the screen. It's needless and a little repetitive, but it's a nice touch and the better to distract you from the story written by Zach Helm.At some point, Harold's life begins to intersect with a novel written by Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who has unknowingly made Harold her main character. Harold hears her voice narrating the events of his life in his head, and it drives him nuts.[...].So he visits a couple of doctors, who think he has schizophrenia. He is eventually directed to literature professor Jules Hilbert, played by Dustin Hoffman, who agrees to help. If some author is narrating his life, Hilbert tells Harold, he should first figure out if the story's a tragedy or comedy.Eiffel, of course, is intending a tragedy - all of her main characters die - but she has writer's block. She can't think of a way to kill Harold.Is it possible to enjoy a movie while mentally eviscerating its logic?""Stranger Than Fiction"" makes about as much sense as a 4-foot giraffe. How did Harold end up in Kay's book? If she has writer's block and has theoretically already written the narration Harold's hearing, why is he hearing it now? Why does the narration disappear for half of the movie?The inevitable comparison is to Charlie Kaufman's works, including ""Adapation,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Put simply, Kaufman's better at it; his scripts create a device - whether it's a portal or a memory-erasing program - that, while unreal, at least give the audience some ground rules.""Stranger Than Fiction"" really has none. In some scenes Harold works outside the narration, while in others he's living out the narration. But he's only doing that because ? oh, never mind. ""Minority Report"" it isn't. Just flow with it.Ferrell is low-key and funny, and he surprisingly generates chemistry with Gyllenhaal, who is asked to make a speech about cookies sound sexy. And she does it, twisting ""macadamia"" into erotic prose. Forster gives Hoffman some freedom to make an eccentric character. Thompson looks awful, but plays miserable pretty well.It's easy to sense where the script is going. It goes there, there's a false climax then a real one, and then it arrives the kind of charity and goodness that is totally inexplicable, yet warm and gooey-centered.""Stranger Than Fiction"" has a sharp visual polish and keeps slipping asides in its narrative to keep the jokes fresh.It's a professional effort - handsome, even. It debases the theories of quantum physics, but if a movie takes the time to put on a suit, mix in some nifty music and have one of those collage endings that feels like the sun rising again, well, shoot - put me down for two boxes of the Shortbreads and one box of the Thin Mints.",3,"Sweet, but illogical and dry.",1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,3415,"['hard', 'not', 'smile', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'sweet-smelling', 'potpourri', 'dry', 'comedy', 'romance', 'get-busy-livin', 'philosophy', 'wanted', 'dislike', 'faulty', 'logic', 'gim', '-a-hug', 'sentiment', 'just', 'too', 'well-executed', 'be', 'trapped', 'shortcomings.I', 'laughed', 'little', 'rooted', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'get', 'girl', 'day', 'cinematic', 'wasteland', ""'ll"", 'do', 'Think', 'witty', 'chaser', 'craziness', 'Borat', 'Ferrell', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'IRS', 'auditor', 'who', 'reduced', 'life', 'numbers', 'brushstrokes', 'teeth', 'steps', 'bus', 'stop', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'cleverly', 'Harold', 'fixation', 'helpful', 'white', 'graphics', 'flash', 'screen', 'needless', 'little', 'repetitive', 'nice', 'touch', 'better', 'distract', 'story', 'written', 'Zach', 'Helm.At', 'point', 'Harold', 'life', 'intersect', 'novel', 'written', 'Kay', 'Eiffel', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'unknowingly', 'made', 'Harold', 'main', 'character', 'Harold', 'voice', 'narrating', 'events', 'life', 'head', 'nuts.', '[', ']', 'couple', 'doctors', 'who', 'think', 'schizophrenia', 'eventually', 'directed', 'literature', 'professor', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'played', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'help', 'author', 'narrating', 'life', 'Hilbert', 'Harold', 'should', 'first', 'figure', 'story', 'tragedy', 'comedy.Eiffel', 'course', 'intending', 'tragedy', 'main', 'characters', 'die', 'writer', 'block', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'kill', 'Harold.Is', 'possible', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'mentally', 'eviscerating', 'logic', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'sense', '4-foot', 'giraffe', 'How', 'did', 'Harold', 'end', 'up', 'Kay', 'book', 'writer', 'block', 'theoretically', 'already', 'written', 'narration', 'Harold', 'hearing', 'why', 'hearing', 'now', 'Why', 'narration', 'disappear', 'half', 'movie', 'inevitable', 'comparison', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'works', 'including', 'Adapation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Put', 'simply', 'Kaufman', 'better', 'scripts', 'create', 'device', 'portal', 'memory-erasing', 'program', 'unreal', 'least', 'give', 'audience', 'ground', 'rules', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'really', 'none', 'scenes', 'Harold', 'works', 'narration', 'others', 'living', 'out', 'narration', 'only', 'doing', 'oh', 'never', 'mind', 'Minority', 'Report', ""n't"", 'Just', 'flow', 'it.Ferrell', 'low-key', 'funny', 'surprisingly', 'chemistry', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'asked', 'make', 'speech', 'cookies', 'sound', 'sexy', 'twisting', 'macadamia', 'erotic', 'prose', 'Forster', 'Hoffman', 'freedom', 'make', 'eccentric', 'character', 'Thompson', 'awful', 'miserable', 'pretty', 'well.It', 'easy', 'sense', 'where', 'script', 'going', 'there', 'false', 'climax', 'then', 'real', 'one', 'then', 'kind', 'charity', 'goodness', 'totally', 'inexplicable', 'yet', 'warm', 'gooey-centered', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'sharp', 'visual', 'polish', 'slipping', 'asides', 'narrative', 'keep', 'jokes', 'fresh.It', 'professional', 'effort', 'handsome', 'even', 'theories', 'quantum', 'physics', 'movie', 'time', 'put', 'suit', 'mix', 'nifty', 'music', 'have', 'one', 'collage', 'endings', 'feels', 'sun', 'rising', 'again', 'well', 'shoot', 'put', 'down', 'two', 'boxes', 'Shortbreads', 'one', 'box', 'Thin', 'Mints']",N/A

He even counts the brush strokes while brushing his teeth and has the single slip knot tie science down.One day he finds he has a narrator and discovers he is the main character in a novel, by a woman (Emma Thompson as Kay Eiffel) who's trying to figure out how to kill him off but she can't get rid of her writer's block.As she chain smokes and downs vodka in an attempt to discover the proper way to wrap the plot, Crick finds that he must stop this author at all costs.  His life depends on it.  As the narrator gets loud and he's the only person who can hear it, he yells at it, looks for it, and finally begs for help to figure out who is narrating his life before it's too late.Interesting premise by screenwriter Zack Helm harkens to a story I recall reading from L. Ron Hubbard, published back in the 1940s called Typewriter in the Sky (Typewriter in the Sky).Both books pertain to a guy who finds himself living a fictional story.  Both characters are struggling with not dying but trying to change the plot before their respective authors kill them off.  And of course they both have occupations that no one likes:  Pirate and a Tax Collector.Well, as an analogy, Isaac Asimov's galactic empire and George Lucas' Star Wars galactic empire are similar as well.  [Compare:The Foundation TrilogyandStar Wars TrilogyThe stories between Zach's and Hubbard's are overall dissimilar in many other ways.  Harold Crick has actually come to life in modern times, actually meets his author and attempts to change his fate and then comes to accept it as the only way.  But it plays out differently and has a cute ending which I won't reveal of course.Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie - 25th Anniversary Edition) plays the literary professor who at first thinks Harold is nuts but then plays along and finds that perhaps Harold actually is hearing a narrator.  The professor is convinced that Harold must die for the good of the plot.It's a lot of fun seeing the character changing before the viewer's eyes.  Harold was introverted, alone, methodical and on a rat race treadmill.  When the treadmill was shaken he did all he could to build a better mouse trap.Philosophically, we can look at the tale as a disregard for fate, that we are not predestined to lead a certain path but can choose our own paths.Ferrell, with Maggie Gyllenhaal (she's great as the romantic lead, Ana, and you've seen her in:The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy with Exclusive Steelbook Packaging) ~ Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Aaron Eckhart (DVD - Dec 9, 2008)) and Queen Latifa (Bringing Down The House (Widescreen Edition)) make for a fun cast.The humor is there, dark at times, and a bit of toilet humor (it is 2006 after all) make for an entertaining picture that you really must see.The DVD has plenty of features, several extended and deleted scenes and interviews with the cast and crew that really show the love they had for this film.I really liked the music as well -- ""Give a little time for the child within you.""

1041489,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000LXH0AE,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 4]","Many beloved ""Saturday Night Live"" comic actors have tried to break out from pure comedy into more dramatic roles.  Dan Aykroyd (""Driving Miss Daisy""), Bill Murray (""Lost in Translation,"" ""Rushmore""), and even John Belushi (""Continental Divide"") have proven that it can be done.  But it is undeniably a risk.Therefore it is with kudos that we greet Will Ferrell's performance as Harold Crick, seriously unfunny IRS auditor, in Marc Forster's ""Stranger than Fiction.""  Harold is obsessed with numbers, brushing each tooth an equal number of times every day, counting the number of steps it takes to make it to the same bus, etc.  Harold takes no vacation, and has no real friends.  His life is maddeningly static, and empty.  When Harold dies, his tombstone will have nothing more than his name and the only two significant dates of his life - birth and death.And then one day, Harold starts hearing a voice in his head, narrating his life.  This is worrisome, but becomes downright frightening when the voice refers to Harold's impending demise.  The voice is of author Karen Eiffel (Emmma Thompson), a nerve-wracked, chain-smoking recluse, a gifted writer suffering through writer's block as she tries to figure out how to kill Harold.  The metaphysics of Karen writing a novel about a man who actually exists are never explained, but the set-up works regardless.Harold, faced with impending doom, first seeks help from a shrink.  The shrink, stumped by Harold's delusions but grasping on to Harold's description of the voice ""narrating"" his story, tells him to seek out an expert in literary theory.  Enter Dustin Hoffman as Professor Jules Hibbert, who dismisses Harold until Harold says that the narrating voice uses the phrase, ""little did he know.""  Jules is fascinated - ""I've taught whole seminars on 'little did he know.'""The story then turns to how Harold deals with his impending demise and learns to live his life again.  Enter Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a heavily-tattooed baker who is the subject of one of Harold's audits.  Harold is charmed by her, but has not the first clue how to go about pursuing this beauty.  The scenes with Ferrell and Gyllenhaal are not realistic (a tax-protesting free-spirit baker would never fall for this auditor, especially when his opening line is ""I want you""), but the two actors handle their scenes with such care and tenderness that disbelief is suspended.  Their most charming scene involves Ana introducing Harold to his first home-baked cookies, and Ferrell is quite surprising.""Stranger than Fiction"" could have been played as broad slapstick, and indeed that is what I had expected.  But there is nothing along the lines of the ""Baby Jesus"" speech in ""Talladega Nights"" for madcap comedy here.  What comedy there is in this movie is quiet, calm, and heart-felt.  Strong performances fill out what could have been a mere trifle of a film, and Thompson and Ferrell particularly shine.""Stranger than Fiction"" is far from a laugh-out-loud comedy, but it has its comic moments.  It is an unconventional story about conventional people, and if its ultimate conclusions about living life to the fullest are pure vanilla, that doesn't mean that it isn't a delicious vanilla.  Just like a well-baked cookie.",4,"Will Ferrell breaks from ""Old School"" and ""Ricky Bobby"" in solid performance",1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,3259,"['Many', 'beloved', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'comic', 'actors', 'have', 'tried', 'break', 'out', 'pure', 'comedy', 'more', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Rushmore', 'even', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Continental', 'Divide', 'have', 'proven', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'undeniably', 'risk.Therefore', 'kudos', 'greet', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'performance', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'seriously', 'unfunny', 'IRS', 'auditor', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'Harold', 'obsessed', 'numbers', 'brushing', 'tooth', 'equal', 'number', 'times', 'day', 'counting', 'number', 'steps', 'make', 'same', 'bus', 'etc', 'Harold', 'vacation', 'real', 'friends', 'life', 'maddeningly', 'static', 'empty', 'When', 'Harold', 'tombstone', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'more', 'name', 'only', 'two', 'significant', 'dates', 'life', 'birth', 'death.And', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'Harold', 'hearing', 'voice', 'head', 'narrating', 'life', 'worrisome', 'downright', 'frightening', 'when', 'voice', 'refers', 'Harold', 'impending', 'demise', 'voice', 'author', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'Emmma', 'Thompson', 'nerve-wracked', 'chain-smoking', 'recluse', 'gifted', 'writer', 'suffering', 'writer', 'block', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'kill', 'Harold', 'metaphysics', 'Karen', 'writing', 'novel', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'set-up', 'works', 'regardless.Harold', 'faced', 'impending', 'doom', 'first', 'seeks', 'help', 'shrink', 'shrink', 'stumped', 'Harold', 'delusions', 'grasping', 'Harold', 'description', 'voice', 'narrating', 'story', 'seek', 'out', 'expert', 'literary', 'theory', 'Enter', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Professor', 'Jules', 'Hibbert', 'who', 'Harold', 'Harold', 'narrating', 'voice', 'phrase', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'Jules', 'fascinated', ""'ve"", 'taught', 'whole', 'seminars', ""'little"", 'did', 'know', 'story', 'then', 'how', 'Harold', 'deals', 'impending', 'demise', 'live', 'life', 'again', 'Enter', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'heavily-tattooed', 'baker', 'who', 'subject', 'one', 'Harold', 'audits', 'Harold', 'charmed', 'not', 'first', 'clue', 'how', 'go', 'about', 'pursuing', 'beauty', 'scenes', 'Ferrell', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'tax-protesting', 'free-spirit', 'baker', 'would', 'never', 'fall', 'auditor', 'especially', 'when', 'opening', 'line', 'want', 'two', 'actors', 'handle', 'scenes', 'such', 'care', 'tenderness', 'disbelief', 'suspended', 'most', 'charming', 'scene', 'Ana', 'introducing', 'Harold', 'first', 'home-baked', 'cookies', 'Ferrell', 'quite', 'surprising', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'broad', 'slapstick', 'indeed', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'nothing', 'lines', 'Baby', 'Jesus', 'speech', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'here', 'What', 'comedy', 'movie', 'quiet', 'calm', 'heart-felt', 'Strong', 'performances', 'fill', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mere', 'trifle', 'film', 'Thompson', 'Ferrell', 'particularly', 'shine', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'far', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'comic', 'moments', 'unconventional', 'story', 'conventional', 'people', 'ultimate', 'conclusions', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'are', 'pure', 'vanilla', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'delicious', 'vanilla', 'Just', 'well-baked', 'cookie']",N/A

It is almost nothing like his usual style. Instead of playing a ridiculous buffoon through a series of cheap jokes, Ferrell is part of an intelligent, emotionally engaging film this time.Harold Crick is an obsessively neat loner who works as an auditor for the IRS. Crick is very good at his job, which is a good thing, because that's nearly all he does. He has no social life and almost no outside interests, besides his unvarying routine. (Brush each tooth 35 times up and down, 35 side to side. Count the steps on the way to the bus.)All of this changes when Crick starts hearing a voice narrating his actions. The voice describes exactly what he's doing as he's doing it. This understandably throws Crick off balance, and his work, among other things is negatively affected. Losing his cool, professional stance, he finds himself very attracted to the owner of a bakery who happens to be one of his auditees. (Hearing a voice carefully describe sexual fantasies about a woman present while trying to keep his mind on other things would be difficult for any man.)Already worried, Crick becomes downright panicked when the voice announces his imminent death. Attempting to understand this strange experience, he consults with a professor of literature. (Professor Jules Hilbert is played by Dustin Hoffman. Hilbert is very reminiscent of his role as the existential detective in I Heart Huckabees.)Paralleling all of this is the dilemma of Karen Eiffel, an author desperately trying to find an ending for her new novel. Her biggest problem is how exactly she's going to kill off Harold Crick.Crick finally discovers exactly who is narrating his life (and death) and meets up with Eiffel. I won't ruin the ending, but I'll just say it's satisfying, if not perfect.The script for this movie is fantastic, repeatedly flowing in directions that evade the audience's expectations. The entire cast puts in excellent performances. I, who am not a fan of Ferrell's usual style, was very pleasantly surprised by his genuine talent. Some people found the occasional CGI animations overlaid on the action distracting, but I thought they illustrated Crick's precise thought processes well. There are a few stray bits of plot that don't feel filled out very well, but nothing that detracts from the overall effect of this movie.This is a great example of something we see far too rarely today: an intelligent, well-played comedy for grown-ups.

Some feel it is a schizophrenic break, but he feels it is something more...something deeper, regarding his very destiny.  Could he be living the life of a fantasy character of someone else?  A full life he's never ever been able to create himself?  He's terribly agitated by the voices, but more so, when he hears that he is about to be terminated.  It is in this revelation, that he finally learns to become a man, face his fears, and remove the boundaries that have always surrounded him.  In doing so, Maggie Gyllenhal's rebellious, tax evading character, with a fair share of tattoos, enters the picture.  The unlikely relationship that evolves between them is, simply adorable.  He is left to wonder, though, whether their relationship will play out as 'a comedy,' or 'a tragedy,' as someone else is writing his script, which is accelerating beyond his control.You become a serious fan of Harold Crick and the developing relationship with the tattooed baker; this lonely guy who has never even had a homemade cookie.  But, destiny plays a large part of this film.  Will he be saved by the author, or become the unlikely, martyred hero?  You'll have a very enjoyable time finding out.  By the end of the film, you are so drawn in, you are willing to accept Harold's fate---wherever it may take him. The good, or the bad of it, this is the first taste of real life Harold Crick has ever experienced.Emma Thompson's character, as the author with writer's block, is brilliant.  She appears on the verge of madness, herself, as she plots and schemes different ways to off her chief protagonist, Harold.This is simply a lovely film, one that we talked about at dinner the next evening, because it left a significant imprint.

The movie I saw seemed like a poorly constructed Twilight Zone episode, not at all a Charlie Kauffman type film.In my opinion, the film quickly falls apart under the shaky rules it establishes. The central problem--in addition to this seeming like a cliche from a Carol Burnett show--is that the writer herself lives in the same world as her creation.  This poses all sorts of questions.  For instance, if she's writing about his job/apartment, how did he come to gain employment and a job in an office in the real world?  Is the office where he works also her creation? Is the apartment building?  Since she also seems to control the romance between Ferrell and Maggie Gillengall(sp?), does that mean Gillengall is another character she dreamed up? If not, why does Gillengall do exactly what the author tells her to do when describing the romantic scene between Gillengall and Ferrell?Perhaps the film might have worked better if the author created the character and he then stepped into the real world (ala Woody Allen's ""Purple Rose of Cairo""), but even so, the prose the writer puts out is laughably amateurish.

1041495,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B000LXH0AE,S. K. Harrell,"[2, 3]","I must admit:  I'd rather wash dishes than watch a film with Will Ferrell.  Wrapped as he was around Maggie Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, I put down the dishrag and gave it a chance.  The premise is that Harold Crick's life is being narrated and only he can hear the narration, which portends his soon death.  A rather methodical and predictable man, on his quest to isolate the circumstances behind this fate he enlists the help of a literary professor who attempts to sort out what sort of plot Crick's life may be.  As the duo rifle through the criteria comprising great literary works Crick meets the woman whom he feels is writing his destiny. The issue here is that this renowned author is known for always killing off her main characters.  As Crick endures the meltdown of unraveling his destiny, the linear way in which he lives becomes more organic, more fulfilling.  Although the conclusion becomes somewhat predictable the journey to that resolution is nothing short of humorous and thought-provoking.The plot of this film is unique.  To observe the twists and witticisms along the way is worth the watch.  I'd like to have seen more of Gyllenhaal's character.  She was very well developed but not really used to her potential.  Her more bohemian way of living was to be that of a foil to Crick's organized method.  The culmination there was clear, but it just didn't give her character enough screen time.  That said, the stellar cast surrounding Ferrell mellowed his usual take on comedy, elevating it to rather smart repart&eacute;e on all counts.  The film moves quickly, pacing consistently throughout, it ending no less a sudden powerful impact.

If someone shoots two numbers at them, he will multiply them instantly with the correct answer. He has a wristwatch that he depends on everything for. He wakes up, gets on the bus to go to work, and falls asleep all at precise times down to the second that if he misses, his day will be forever messed up. His schedule repeats every single day of his life. Oh yeah, and Harold hears voices too. It's almost as like someone is narrating his dull life...not telling him what will happen, but what already happened. This voice comes and goes at seemingly random times. One day Harold is re-setting his wristwatch after it randomly shut off while waiting for the bus when the voice says ""Little did he know, this simply seeming innocent act would result in his imminent death."" When Harold hears this, he begins to fear his death obsessively. But he is not sure what to do.It turns out the voice is real. It is the voice of author Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who has a bad case of writer's block and a heavy addiction to smoking. She is writing a new novel about an IRS agent named Harold Crick who is very good with numbers. Little did SHE know, Harold Crick was a real person, and just by writing the book, she was controlling his life. Oh yeah, and she wanted to kill off Harold in the book at the end. Fortunately, her writer's block makes the voices Harold hear go away temporarily, and he lives his life in his control. This drives her to hire the expert writer's assistant Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) who vows to help her finish the book and kill Harold Crick.Harold sees a psychiatrist who recommends him to the acclaimed English literature expert Jules Hibbert (Dustin Hoffman). Together, they try to find out if this voice--who they don't know is a real author writing a real book about Harold--is trying to write a comedy, or a tragedy. So Harold begins to keep track of issues in his life to find out. In the meantime, Harold falls helplessly in love with a young woman who works at a bakery (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who he just happens to be auditing. As you can probably guess, issues revolving around that ended up around the ""tragedy"" column.Stranger Than Fiction is by far one of the best films of 2006, and I think Will Ferrell's best film yet. The acting is phenomenal: Will Ferrell is in his best role EVER. Emma Thompson is spectacular and soars above many of her other roles in her incredibly realistic portrayal of an author with writer's block. Maggie Gyllenhaal and legend Dustin Hoffman do a fantastic job as well.Stranger Than Fiction has one of the most unique stories I've ever seen, if not THE most unique. I was SHOCKED after watching this to know this was completely ignored by the Academy, including a Best Original Screenplay award that would've totally locked sabers with Little Miss Sunshine. Hell, this is one of the most original screenplays I've ever had the pleasure of watching. You won't believe your eyes and ears that someone can actually write a movie like this.

1041502,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000LXH0AE,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[0, 1]","The Amazon synopsis and several other reviews already say enough about the film's plot, so I'll focus on other specific elements of the film.  I couldn't help thinking of Jim Carrey's ""The Truman Show"" while viewing this story of a guy who hears a voice in his head narrating his life.  It's a very different story than Carrey's film, but you can't help feeling the connection to it.  It's original in that the voice is a real author who writes novels in which she kills off the main character unexpectedly and often in some gruesome manner.  Will Ferrell's character sets out to ""find the voice"" and stop her from killing him off and seeks the help of a literary scholar played by Dustin Hoffman.This is a strange film in that like most comedy-dramas you aren't always sure where to laugh.  It can be awkward at times, but overall, I did like the quirkiness of the film.  It does move a bit slow though at times and I found myself restless at points.  There are a lot of shots of people just ""thinking"" and that can get tedious.  However, the film is cleverly shot at various times making my criticisms seem small here.  One of my favorite scenes in the film is Ferrell's coversation on the bus with the woman he is auditing, Gyllenhaal.  The camera angles enhanced the awkwardness both characters were feeling at that moment.  Of course, the solid acting by Ferrell and Gyllenhaal make that scene as good as it is.Ferrell is terrific in this very subdued role and it clearly shows that he does have some acting chops when given the right material.  While this isn't necessarily a ""dramatic"" role, it is a great departure for him from his farsical side.  I am no fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal and have found most of her prior performances to be mediocore at best, but she gives a very winning performance here.  I found myself liking both her character and her as an actress in this film.  Emma Thompson, however, nearly steals the film from everyone as the kooky author who develops writer's block and needs the watchful eye of her publisher's assigned assistant played by Queen Latifah who is toned down like Ferrell in this film.  She brings an air of eloquence that you would have expected Thompson to bring, but one can't help but wonder what sparked her interest to be in this film and in such a minor role.  Another well toned down performance is given by Dustin Hoffman as the literary scholar trying to assist Ferrell character in figuring out where his life might be going.  He still adds his trademark quirkiness wherever he can and that benefits this film as many of the characters are quiet and or dark in some manner.In the nutshell, this was a very interesting and satisfying film that I think most, when they give it a chance, will enjoy.  It is not a ""mainstream"" film and the actors are not acting in a way that most of us are used to seeing them, but that is the joy of this film.",4,"Not Quite Original, But Refreshing Fun Nevertheless!",1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,2895,"['Amazon', 'synopsis', 'several', 'other', 'reviews', 'already', 'say', 'enough', 'film', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'other', 'specific', 'elements', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Truman', 'Show', 'viewing', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'voice', 'head', 'narrating', 'life', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'Carrey', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'connection', 'original', 'voice', 'real', 'author', 'who', 'novels', 'main', 'character', 'unexpectedly', 'often', 'gruesome', 'manner', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'out', 'find', 'voice', 'stop', 'killing', 'off', 'help', 'literary', 'scholar', 'played', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman.This', 'strange', 'film', 'most', 'comedy-dramas', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'sure', 'where', 'laugh', 'can', 'be', 'awkward', 'times', 'overall', 'did', 'quirkiness', 'film', 'move', 'bit', 'slow', 'though', 'times', 'found', 'restless', 'points', 'are', 'lot', 'shots', 'people', 'just', 'thinking', 'can', 'get', 'tedious', 'However', 'film', 'cleverly', 'shot', 'various', 'times', 'making', 'criticisms', 'seem', 'small', 'here', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'film', 'Ferrell', 'coversation', 'bus', 'woman', 'auditing', 'Gyllenhaal', 'camera', 'enhanced', 'awkwardness', 'characters', 'were', 'feeling', 'moment', 'course', 'solid', 'acting', 'Ferrell', 'Gyllenhaal', 'make', 'scene', 'as', 'good', 'terrific', 'very', 'subdued', 'role', 'clearly', 'have', 'acting', 'chops', 'when', 'given', 'right', 'material', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'dramatic', 'role', 'great', 'departure', 'farsical', 'side', 'am', 'fan', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'have', 'found', 'most', 'prior', 'performances', 'be', 'mediocore', 'best', 'very', 'winning', 'performance', 'here', 'found', 'liking', 'character', 'actress', 'film', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'however', 'nearly', 'film', 'everyone', 'kooky', 'author', 'who', 'writer', 'block', 'watchful', 'eye', 'publisher', 'assigned', 'assistant', 'played', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'toned', 'down', 'Ferrell', 'film', 'air', 'eloquence', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Thompson', 'bring', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'sparked', 'interest', 'be', 'film', 'such', 'minor', 'role', 'well', 'toned', 'down', 'performance', 'given', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'literary', 'scholar', 'trying', 'assist', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'figuring', 'out', 'where', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'still', 'trademark', 'quirkiness', 'can', 'benefits', 'film', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'quiet', 'dark', 'manner.In', 'nutshell', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'satisfying', 'film', 'think', 'most', 'when', 'give', 'chance', 'will', 'enjoy', 'not', 'mainstream', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'acting', 'way', 'most', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'joy', 'film']",N/A

1041505,A1RD2TSQ2IE5LW,B000LXH0AE,Steven Sabin,"[2, 2]","I was not too sure what to expect from this movie.  Perhaps because of Will Ferrell I assumed a sort of romatic comedy.  It was light-hearted, but I wouldn't quite call it a comedy.  It had its romatic moments, but I wouldn't quite call it a romance either.  It was really just a story about how a man breaks out of his routine and finds himself in the process.The movie chronicles the life of Harold Crick, played by Ferrell - an IRS auditor in Chicago who lives a very regimented, almost obsessive/compulsive existence where he counts everything (steps to the bus stop, numbers of strokes with his toothbrush, minutes/seconds in his lunchbreak, etc.). His life is one of lonely monotony where he has few friends and almost no life outside of his job.  One day, he begins hearing a woman's voice as he's getting ready for work - a voice that is narrating his every move in life.  He breaks out of his day-to-day routine as he tries to find the writer (played by Emma Thompson) who is narrating his life, eventually learning that her name is Karen Eiffel and confronting her face-to-face.  There, he learns that in her previous eight novels that the main character always dies tragically at the end of the book.  Crick must then come to grips with the strange reality that his life is being crafted by someone else and that his own death has been pre-ordained.  Meanwhile, Eiffel comes to grips with the fact that her latest novel is actually deciding the fate of a living, breathing human being - not just a figment of her imagination.  She has a dilemma: decide between publishing her best book ever with her signature ending of tragedy, or settle for a mediocre ending where she allows her main character to live on ""happily ever after"" for the first time - all while understanding that her pen will decide the fate of the real Mr. Crick.I won't spoil the ending - you'll just have to watch to see whether it's a tear-jerker or a ray of sunshine, but rest assured that either way, it results in a delightful story.The real star here was Zach Helm (the writer) who put together a truly charming screenplay that, although quirky, was very touching without being sappy.  But equally deserving of praise was Ferrell who played the part of Harold Crick perfectly, giving us a shy, withdrawn, and lovable character who is completely unlike his over-the-top stand-up comedic persona.  And, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who delivers a very nice performance as a counter-culture bakery owner that Crick is sent to audit.  Her character ends up having a major influence in Crick's life, and vice-versa.  Because I grew up in a counter-culture town (Ashland, Oregon), I've seen my share of counter-culture folks and Gyllenhaal plays the role of earthy, politically outspoken, counter-culture restaurant owner with an attitude to a ""T"" - replete with tatoos, socialist leanings, and probably a pair of Birkenstock sandals hiding in her closet somewhere.Surprisingly, Hoffman and Thompson play lesser roles in this film, and I found myself somewhat surprised that Hoffman in particular actually agreed to such a small part.  But I think that is testimony to the extraordinary strength of Helm's screenplay.  Indeed, in the ""extras"" feature on the DVD, Thompson comments on this and notes that she wasn't 3 pages into the script before she wanted in.It was a delightful, satisfying way to spend a couple hours.  I found it wholesome and redeeming as Crick is truly a good-hearted fellow who we grow to love as the film progresses through his good-natured and selfless manner.  It has none of the zaniness that we've come to expect from Ferrell and established him as a very capable dramatic actor.",4,Charming,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,3676,"['was', 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'assumed', 'sort', 'romatic', 'comedy', 'was', 'light-hearted', 'would', ""n't"", 'quite', 'call', 'comedy', 'had', 'romatic', 'moments', 'would', ""n't"", 'quite', 'call', 'romance', 'either', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'story', 'how', 'man', 'routine', 'process.The', 'movie', 'life', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'played', 'Ferrell', 'IRS', 'auditor', 'Chicago', 'who', 'very', 'regimented', 'almost', 'obsessive/compulsive', 'existence', 'where', 'everything', 'steps', 'bus', 'stop', 'numbers', 'strokes', 'toothbrush', 'lunchbreak', 'etc.', 'life', 'one', 'lonely', 'monotony', 'where', 'few', 'friends', 'almost', 'life', 'job', 'One', 'day', 'hearing', 'woman', 'voice', 'getting', 'ready', 'work', 'voice', 'narrating', 'move', 'life', 'day-to-day', 'routine', 'find', 'writer', 'played', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'narrating', 'life', 'eventually', 'learning', 'name', 'Karen', 'Eiffel', 'confronting', 'face-to-face', 'previous', 'eight', 'novels', 'main', 'character', 'always', 'tragically', 'end', 'book', 'Crick', 'must', 'then', 'come', 'grips', 'strange', 'reality', 'life', 'being', 'crafted', 'someone', 'else', 'own', 'death', 'been', 'pre-ordained', 'Meanwhile', 'Eiffel', 'grips', 'fact', 'latest', 'novel', 'actually', 'deciding', 'fate', 'living', 'breathing', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'just', 'figment', 'imagination', 'dilemma', 'decide', 'publishing', 'best', 'book', 'ever', 'signature', 'ending', 'tragedy', 'settle', 'mediocre', 'ending', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'first', 'time', 'understanding', 'pen', 'will', 'decide', 'fate', 'real', 'Mr.', 'Crick.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'tear-jerker', 'ray', 'sunshine', 'rest', 'assured', 'way', 'results', 'delightful', 'story.The', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'was', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'writer', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'truly', 'charming', 'screenplay', 'quirky', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'being', 'sappy', 'equally', 'deserving', 'praise', 'was', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'perfectly', 'giving', 'shy', 'withdrawn', 'lovable', 'character', 'who', 'completely', 'over-the-top', 'stand-up', 'comedic', 'persona', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'very', 'nice', 'performance', 'counter-culture', 'bakery', 'owner', 'Crick', 'sent', 'audit', 'character', 'up', 'having', 'major', 'influence', 'Crick', 'life', 'vice-versa', 'grew', 'up', 'counter-culture', 'town', 'Ashland', 'Oregon', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'share', 'counter-culture', 'folks', 'Gyllenhaal', 'role', 'earthy', 'politically', 'outspoken', 'counter-culture', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'attitude', 'T', 'replete', 'tatoos', 'socialist', 'leanings', 'probably', 'pair', 'Birkenstock', 'sandals', 'hiding', 'closet', 'somewhere.Surprisingly', 'Hoffman', 'Thompson', 'play', 'lesser', 'roles', 'film', 'found', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'Hoffman', 'particular', 'actually', 'agreed', 'such', 'small', 'part', 'think', 'testimony', 'extraordinary', 'strength', 'Helm', 'screenplay', 'Indeed', 'extras', 'feature', 'DVD', 'Thompson', 'comments', 'was', ""n't"", '3', 'pages', 'script', 'wanted', 'in.It', 'was', 'delightful', 'satisfying', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'found', 'wholesome', 'redeeming', 'Crick', 'truly', 'good-hearted', 'fellow', 'who', 'grow', 'love', 'film', 'good-natured', 'selfless', 'manner', 'none', 'zaniness', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Ferrell', 'established', 'very', 'capable', 'dramatic', 'actor']",N/A

It made me care about the main character.  Harold Crick has a problem.  He's hearing a voice that narrates his every move.  As irritating as this may be, it gets worse once the voice announces that he is going to die.And so the plot has been set in motion.  Harold is an IRS agent, a nice enough guy, but lonely, and hated by the people he must audit to do his job.  You can't help but feel sorry for him, and even root for him.  He really is one of the most likeable characters I've seen in a while.  Will Ferrell surprised me with his ability to evoke sadness and was better than I expected.  I was thinking while watching him how Jim Carrey could have easily filled the role as well, only because it reminded me of his character in Eternal Sunshine, but but it was nice to see that Ferrell can act as well.The rest of the cast did fine, but none of them really had much to sink their teeth into.  Hoffman didn't really have to do anything, he was just himself.  Emma Thompson was adequate as the alcoholic author with writer's block.  She looked terrible but her voice is very pleasant as the narrator.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is adorable so it's easy to see why Harold falls for her.Overall, a well crafted story.

His character, Harold Crick, a stiff, lifeless, almost robotic IRS agent, comes to life as he falls in love with a bohemian baker, Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)  Emma Thompson is believable as a neurotic but brilliant novelist suffering from writer's block.  Dustin Hoffman carries water as a literature professor who helps Harold figure out what is happening to him.  There's not a bad performance in the film.You will see the outcome from a mile away.  Or at least you think you can.  There's enough doubt about which way the story's going to keep your attention.Stranger Than Fiction is very funny but not in the way that most Hollywood ""comedies"" are.  It's full of off-beat humor a la Rushmore.  Don't rent (or buy) it expecting Old School or anything like Will's Saturday Night Live bits.  The humor's more subtle than that.Besides being unique - the story is a breath of fresh air given that Hollywood only seems to excel these days at remaking old movies and TV shows - it is beautifully filmed.  One of the most enjoyable aspects, for me, of this movie is that it was shot right in downtown Chicago.  There's a lot of life and art - beautiful architecture and urban landscapes - in the setting.  The GUI (graphic user interface) bits give the film another visual dimension.All in all, Stranger Than Fictions' a nice movie.

1041510,A2A2SUY3IOQKY1,B000LXH0AE,TawnTawn,"[3, 5]","We are introduced to Harold Crick by Karen Effiel, who is writing a novel with him as the hero, or perhaps it is his watch that is the hero as she ascribes human feelings to it. Harold is an IRS agent who lives in a beige apartment and brushes his teeth the same amount of minutes each morning. He counts his steps and is very good at math. He apparently doesn't try anything  new. While brushing his teeth, he hears Karen narrating what he's doing. This narrating continues while he walks, works, etc. He's advised by a doctor to go to a literature professor. He goes to see one played by Dustin Hoffman, who reprises his role of the offbeat character he played in ""I Heart Huckabees"" and to a lesser degree, ""Meet the Parents II"".Harold accidentally hears Karen talking on a tape on the professor's television, and identifies her voice. She says she's writing a novel and describes Harold's life. The professor tells him that the tape is 10 years old and the author always kills her heroes. This disturbs Harold Crick as he tries to figure out how to meet her and get her to change her ending. The professor also tells Harold that he does not control his life, and Harold agrees with that. So who does control it - the author of the book? It appears so.In the meantime, he's come to the realization that it's time to live. He romantically pursues a bakery owner who didn't pay all of her taxes (for moral reasons), learns to play the guitar, and gives a present to a friend so that he can fulfill his dream.When he meets Karen, she becomes a little (more) unhinged. She's already finished the book, but hasn't typed it. She gives him the yellow legal pad papers and he takes it to the professor to read. He finishes is and tells Harold that he has to die, that it is a great death, and the book would not work without it. His death gives meaning to his pointless life. Harold reads it, sadly agrees it's fantastic, and resigns himself to die.Karen meets with the professor and discusses changing the ending. He dissuades her from this, extolling the book as one of the greatest ever written. Since she's been reading the whole thing throughout the movie, I didn't think so. It's extremely pedestrian, and since it's about Harold's life, it's boring. Just because there is a ""magnificent"" (or stupid and unnecessary) death as the ending, that does not mean that the book is good.Throughout the movie, of which the acting was wonderful, I was expecting some great revelation at the end. Were Harold and the other characters (such as the bus driver and the stupid brat who can't ride a bike) in the book and his life really real? Because of course we are not shown any scenes of life prior to the narrating of the novel. I thought the ending would be something mystical and uplifting, perhaps explained by a parallel universe, a spiritual meeting of the minds, or something else out of the ordinary.Instead, the ending ruins the movie. It cheapens it, it mainstreams it, and it was disappointing after the great buildup.However, what the movie is trying to say is: live now.

1041512,A1MZNOE1OABAQK,B000LXH0AE,thecableguy,"[0, 0]","I have a friend who is a writer. Several years ago, while working as an inventory clerk, I went crazy. I told my doctor I felt like my friend was ""writing me."" My doctor, like Harold Crick's doctor in this film, suspected I was schizophrenic. Unlike Harold Crick, I believed my doctor. He prescribed some pills that turned me into a zombie. Also unlike Harold, I didn't end up meeting someone like Maggie Gyllenhaal's Ana Pascal, I spent two years unemployed, living with my grandmother, who baked me cookies every day.Eventually I found a therapist who helped get me on less disabling medication. In the meantime, my writer friend, who I'd lost touch with due to zombiness, had published a story with a character who seemed very similar to myself. I wrote my friend, sending congratulations, then talked about my bad experience, figuring if there were a connection between her story and my lost sanity, my friend would at least mention the weirdness of the timing. We communicated for a while; the weirdness was never brought up. Instead, I mostly complained about my situation, saying that living with my grandmother sometimes made me feel as if I was in ""Harold and Maude.""  Then, all of a sudden, I went crazy again.A few weeks after I got out of the hospital, I see my friend has published another story, again with a character that seems like he possibly could've been modeled after me.  It's part of the illness, I thought. I'm just being paranoid. No need to come off as a psycho more than I already have. So I let it go. Communication was cut off. It's not worth my time, I said.Then I see ""Stranger Than Fiction."" And I'm very mad at my doctor.""Harold Crick isn't ready to go. Period,"" states the film's tagline. I'm mad at myself: ""You mean, all this time, instead of popping pills and moping around with my therapist, I could've been hanging out with Dustin Hoffman discussing literature, tracking down Emma Thompson to save my life, finally learning to play guitar, eating Maggie Gyllenhaal's cookies, with Spoon songs chiming in to emphasize every pivotal moment?! What signpost did I miss?!"" It's a little infuriating.I may not be like Harold, but at least I'm not as mad at my parents now, and I've fixed that nasty stalking habit. I also smile more. But I can't help thinking that if the filmmakers are indeed telling the truth, as the title implies, maybe schizophrenics never really need medication. I know,""It's only a movie,"" but there have been too many real life coincidences to keep me from not wondering.I submitted this review for anyone feeling a little crazy who has a writer friend. Be sure to check with them before going to the doctor. If they're a little defensive, try being a little more up front with them. It's a give and take thing. You might save a lot of time and money, and you may even get to keep a friend. Even if it doesn't work out, at least you'll have someone to blame.

Will Ferrell stars as Harold Crick, a lonely IRS agent whose mundane existence is transformed when he suddenly hears a mysterious voice narrating his life.  With the assistance of Prof. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), Harold discovers he's the main character in a novel-in-progress and that the voice belongs to Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), an eccentric author famous for disposing of her characters in unusual ways.  Harold must quickly track down Eiffel and stop her before she conjures up a way to kill him.Director Mark Forster creates a fascinating world within a world in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and has elicited top performances from Ferrell and especially Hoffman, who looks as if he's having a ball with the role.  Unfortunately Queen Latifah, who can shine on screen in the right roles, is pretty much wasted here as Eiffel's assistant.

1041516,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000LXH0AE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 7]","thornhill woke up early that Saturday, eager to watch a new film he hoped would prove memorable. His alarm went off, far too early for it had been a hectic week and his mind needed rest, but it reminded him of the possible treasure awaiting. Completing his normal morning chores much more quickly than usual; the feel of the water washing away dirt and beard shavings, the smell of the cat food nauseating him just slightly, the bark of his neighbor's dog as he left his apartment and headed out to the car park were all familiar sights and sounds, just experienced at a slightly accelerated pace.The matinee was early, much earlier than he would normally attend, but because it was at an acceptable local theater, right in the midst of his normal Saturday morning routine, thornhill decided to give it a go. Upon his arrival, he was disappointed to find the movie was screening on one of the multiplexes smaller screens, not the large screen downstairs. Didn't the film open this weekend? These theaters are small and boxy and not at all to the intrepid movie reviewer's liking. But thornhill made a commitment, planned his day, and there was no turning back.Rushing into the theater, thornhill missed one of the trailers, but managed to catch the remaining nine. Thankfully, because he was a few minutes late, he missed the requisite Sprite, cell phone-that-can-play-your-favorite-songs and new violent video game ads that were now a part of the movie going experience. No wonder so many have given up the theater experience completely to view most of their films at home, on DVD. But thornhill would never give up on theaters, not completely, because a large part of the movie experience is hearing the reactions of your neighbors, heightening your experience and theirs.As the first few frames of ""Stranger than Fiction"" rolled, thornhill knew he was in for something special. Despite the shadow of an exterior light on one side of the screen (he would surely have to forsake this particular screen in the future), he began to enjoy the film, its wacky story and off-center characters.As thornhill watched, Will Ferrell's character, Harold Crick, an IRS auditor with a very regimented life, began to take form. As Emma Thompson's dulcet tones narrated, he learned a lot about Harold and his life, how little variation or excitement it held. Both Ferrell and director Marc Forster (""Finding Neverland"", ""Monster's Ball"") accomplish the brilliant feat of breathing life into this character. Ferrell's performance is so low key; he is extremely believable as a government employee who works at possibly one of the most mind numbing jobs imaginable. As thornhill watched the performance, he realized Ferrell hit every note perfectly. At lunch, Harold reads calculator catalogs, his apartment is drab and monotonous, he spends the exact same amount of time every day at lunch and on his coffee break, and counts the number of steps from his house to the bus stop.Then, he begins to hear the narration of his life. Initially, he thinks he is going crazy, but soon learns the voice belongs to author Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) and through more investigation, realizes he is the subject of her new book. The voice becomes a commonplace occurrence, something he is only mildly annoyed with and then begins to accept.Then one day, while waiting for the bus, Kay mentions Harold must die. Naturally, Harold isn't happy to hear this and tries to find Kay and save his life. During this same time, he meets Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the owner of a bakery. Harold is auditing her and Kay's narration is spot on, he can't help but imagine what Ana would look like in a bathtub. But as he is her auditor, the chance of romance is slim.thornhill watched the movie with glee, very happy with the tone and feel of the film. In the opening moments, and throughout, director Forster shows us what Harold's life is like by giving us a view of what his character sees. As Kay's narration explains, Harold walks the same way from his house to the bus, always running the last few steps to catch the same bus. As she speaks, we see a superimposed map appear before Harold's eyes. When he is brushing his teeth, we see a counter appear, helping him keep track of the number of brushstrokes on every tooth. Throughout the film, various maps, diagrams, etc. appear to help Harold maintain the rigidity of his life.Then he meets Ana and she throws him for a loop. Attracted to her, she initially loathes him because he represents the government and is auditing her. But Harold's life is less sound, as he is experiencing something he has never experienced before. Caused by two factors, his new found love and the narration of his life informing him that he must die. When he hears this, Harold decides to live his life like he has never lived it before.As thornhill watched ""Fiction"", the film continued to expand and grow, beyond just the Ferrell and Gyllenhaal characters. Yes, they are both very good and the film would probably be fine with just them, but there is more going on in this film.Thornhill was pleased to see Emma Thompson in a fine role in this film. Her voice proved to be the perfect accompaniment to Harold's life. Then, when we meet Kay Eiffel, we realize she is a real mess. She uses the guise of her writing to investigate ways to commit suicide, but we aren't fooled. First, we watch her standing on a roof top, weaving her hand through the air, contemplating what it would be like to jump off. This reverie is interrupted by the arrival of her new assistant (Queen Latifah), a publisher appointed helper meant to help Eiffel get past her writer's block and stay on target. For many a writer, including thornhill, writer's block is a bad thing and Kay has it bad. She can write, but she can't figure out how to kill Harold Crick and without that, the book will meander, the quality will suffer, so this prevents her from writing. For Eiffel, writer's block makes her even more neurotic and nervous, causing her to chain smoke throughout the day.Harold goes to see a psychologist (Linda Hunt) who insists the voices in his head could be quieted by prescription drugs. But he doesn't want to go that route. Instead, he visits a Professor of Literature Theory, Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who insists he can't help either until Harold explains the narrator in his head uses a common phrase. When the professor hears this, he realizes something strange is happening to Harold. The professor treats him like a student pursuing their doctorate and they begin working together.thornhill was very pleased to see Hoffman back in form. Every time we see Professor Hilbert meeting with Harold, he is drinking coffee, or eating. At one point, he buys a cup of coffee from vending machine and as soon as they arrive in his office, the professor pours another cup from a small brew pot. It seems to be his nervous tick, a way to keep his hands occupied. The performance is interesting, quirky and completely at place in this universe.As the film continued, thornhill realized the characters were perfectly matched to their environments, another example of the top notch production team working to create an interesting, wacky landscape for the film. Harold's apartment is dominated by off-white and Spartan, with no decoration. Kay's apartment is sparse, but disorganized, to reflect her life. Ana's bakery is homey, cozy and welcoming even to a man who talks to himself and accepts handouts from the baker. The IRS offices are predominantly white, filled with cubicles and numbers and ready to sap the life out of one and all. At one point, Harold stays with his work buddy, Dave, who dreams of going to Space Camp and is clearly a Star Trek nerd. His apartment is all lozenge shapes and stone, built in the mid 70s. In fact, most of the architecture seems to be from the mid 80s, giving the film a stylized look perfectly complimenting the wacky nature of the story.Throughout the film, thornhill delighted at director Marc Forster's off-beat sensibilities. Shortly after Harold meets Ana, he rides a double length bus to his next appointment and listens as the narrator mentions a fate meeting with Ana, who then boards the bus. This is shortly after they have met, so Ana still loathes the IRS Auditor. She refuses his offer of a seat next to him, and tries to get as far away as possible, but the bus lurches, catching her off guard and she lands in a seat directly facing him. As they make small talk, the bus continues on it's course. Because Harold is sitting in the seat positioned in the accordion webbing connecting the two buses, and the camera remains stationary, looking at Ana, every time the bus turns, Harold moves back and forth. This is a brilliant and slightly wacky way of showing how Harold feels about Ana and his relationship with her. He can't quite decide and keeps going back and forth about it.thornhill left the theater very happy but then a thought occurred; many people are probably expecting ""Fiction"" to be a raucous, laugh a minute comedy based on Ferrell's previous work. Hopefully, they will be able to look past this and appreciate the film for what it is, a wry, well-made dark comedy with some very funny moments.Very funny moments, indeed. Thornhill is still amused.",4,Almost Perfect Comedy,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,9305,"['thornhill', 'woke', 'up', 'early', 'Saturday', 'eager', 'watch', 'new', 'film', 'hoped', 'would', 'prove',

1041518,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000LXH0AE,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","STRANGER THAN FICTION is a movie that feels very much like a Charlie Kaufman picture (the writer of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, ADAPTATION, etc.), but it isn't. Unlike most of the films Kaufman has penned, STRANGER THAN FICTION is lighter, more subdued, not quite as surreal, and actually more realistic.The film stars Will Ferrell as an IRS agent accountant named Harold Crick. Harold loves numbers. He counts everything from how many times he brushes his teeth each morning to how many steps he takes in a day to the amount of liquid in the soap dispensers in the men's restrooms. Harold is very quiet, patient, and subdued. He lives alone and only has one friend, a guy at work named Dave (the delightful Tony Hale). In short, Harold is the perfect IRS agent. One morning as Harold gets up for his morning routine he begins hearing a British female voice that is narrating his life. He tries to get the voice to stop, but proves unsuccessful. He seeks the advice of a psychiatrist and eventually that of a famed literature critic and teacher, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Hoffman reaches the conclusion that Harold is caught up in a tragedy and the best way he can avoid his fate is to start living his life more fully. Harold buys a guitar and starts dating a cute little baker, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who he had just audited. Life seems to have turned into a comedy. But little did Harold know that the woman he hears narrating his life is a reclusive author who has gained fame and notoriety for writer wonderful works of fiction where the protagonist dies at the end. She hasn't written anything for a decade but will soon finish her latest work, an epic of American fiction, the great American novel about an IRS agent named Harold Crick. Sometimes truth is much stranger than fiction.Will Ferrell gives one of the better acting performances of his career. However, he does so without really acting. Imagine all the funny things Ferrell has done and take that all away. Imagine a Ferrell who is completely under control and who keeps his emotions from turning into unnecessary sight-gags. That is the Will Ferrell in STRANGER THAN FICTION. It's a change of pace for Ferrell, yet at the same time the character was perfect for him to play. It is one of the best performances of his career, but it is not Oscar worthy. It does show, however, that Ferrell is capable of more than just being a funny man.Maggie Gyllenhaal portrays Harold's love interest, Ana. I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Gyllenhaal. I think much of her work has been overrated. However, I really did like Ana. Gyllenhaal gives a fine performance, giving Ana the wit, sensuality, rebellious nature, and a tiny bit of perkiness that makes her the type of woman that any reasonable and sensible single man would find attractive. Ana is such an unusual character that her attraction to Harold doesn't seem unusual at all.Emma Thompson gives a strong performance as the author who is writing what she believes to be a work of fiction, Kay Eiffel. Thompson is almost always enchanting on screen and her presence is as strong as ever (even without wearing any makeup). Dustin Hoffman is also a good fit as the English professor, Jules Hilbert, who tries to help Harold.I found STRANGER THAN FICTION to be a somewhat strange, but enjoyable movie. I related to the film on several different levels. For instance, I've done some writing (though none published) and can relate to Eiffel's writer's block and her struggle in attempting to stay true to the story and not let her love of her character (Harold) overcome the story and make it into a clich&eacute;. However, the big thing that STRANGER THAN FICTION caused me to think about was heroes and the nature of a hero. The movie gives a different twist on the classical idea of what a hero is and what happens to a hero. It's helped me to understand that real-life heroes are better than the ones we read about in literature and often see in movies. Real life heroes are the kinds of people we wish there were more of in the world, even if they do live somewhat mundane lives. The truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's often more interesting and exciting as well.",5,Life Is More than Just Death and Taxes,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,4199,"['STRANGER', 'THAN', 'FICTION', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'picture', 'writer', 'BEING', 'JOHN', 'MALKOVICH', 'ADAPTATION', 'etc', ""n't"", 'Unlike', 'most', 'films', 'Kaufman', 'penned', 'STRANGER', 'THAN', 'FICTION', 'lighter', 'more', 'subdued', 'not', 'quite', 'surreal', 'actually', 'more', 'realistic.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'IRS', 'agent', 'accountant', 'named', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Harold', 'numbers', 'everything', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'teeth', 'morning', 'how', 'many', 'steps', 'day', 'amount', 'liquid', 'soap', 'dispensers', 'men', 'restrooms', 'Harold', 'very', 'quiet', 'patient', 'subdued', 'alone', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'guy', 'work', 'named', 'Dave', 'delightful', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'short', 'Harold', 'perfect', 'IRS', 'agent', 'One', 'morning', 'Harold', 'up', 'morning', 'routine', 'hearing', 'British', 'female', 'voice', 'narrating', 'life', 'get', 'voice', 'stop', 'unsuccessful', 'advice', 'psychiatrist', 'eventually', 'famed', 'literature', 'critic', 'teacher', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Hoffman', 'conclusion', 'Harold', 'caught', 'up', 'tragedy', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'avoid', 'fate', 'start', 'living', 'life', 'more', 'fully', 'Harold', 'guitar', 'dating', 'cute', 'little', 'baker', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'audited', 'Life', 'have', 'turned', 'comedy', 'little', 'did', 'Harold', 'know', 'woman', 'narrating', 'life', 'reclusive', 'author', 'who', 'gained', 'fame', 'notoriety', 'writer', 'wonderful', 'works', 'fiction', 'where', 'protagonist', 'end', ""n't"", 'written', 'anything', 'decade', 'will', 'soon', 'finish', 'latest', 'work', 'epic', 'American', 'fiction', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'IRS', 'agent', 'named', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Sometimes', 'truth', 'much', 'stranger', 'fiction.Will', 'Ferrell', 'one', 'better', 'acting', 'performances', 'career', 'However', 'so', 'really', 'acting', 'Imagine', 'funny', 'things', 'Ferrell', 'done', 'take', 'away', 'Imagine', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'completely', 'control', 'who', 'emotions', 'turning', 'unnecessary', 'sight-gags', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'STRANGER', 'THAN', 'FICTION', 'change', 'pace', 'Ferrell', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'was', 'perfect', 'play', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'not', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'show', 'however', 'Ferrell', 'capable', 'more', 'just', 'being', 'funny', 'man.Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Harold', 'love', 'interest', 'Ana', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Gyllenhaal', 'think', 'much', 'work', 'been', 'overrated', 'However', 'really', 'did', 'Ana', 'Gyllenhaal', 'fine', 'performance', 'giving', 'Ana', 'wit', 'sensuality', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'tiny', 'bit', 'perkiness', 'type', 'woman', 'reasonable', 'sensible', 'single', 'man', 'would', 'find', 'attractive', 'Ana', 'such', 'unusual', 'character', 'attraction', 'Harold', ""n't"", 'seem', 'unusual', 'all.Emma', 'Thompson', 'strong', 'performance', 'author', 'who', 'writing', 'what', 'be', 'work', 'fiction', 'Kay', 'Eiffel', 'Thompson', 'almost', 'always', 'enchanting', 'screen', 'presence', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'even', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'also', 'good', 'fit', 'English', 'professor', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'who', 'help', 'Harold.I', 'found', 'STRANGER', 'THAN', 'FICTION', 'be', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'related', 'film', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'instance', ""'ve"", 'done', 'writing', 'none', 'published', 'can', 'relate', 'Eiffel', 'writer', 'block', 'struggle', 'attempting', 'stay', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'let', 'love', 'character', 'Harold', 'overcome', 'story', 'make', 'clich', 'eacute', 'However', 'big', 'thing', 'STRANGER', 'THAN', 'FICTION', 'caused', 'think', 'was', 'heroes', 'nature', 'hero', 'movie', 'different', 'twist', 'classical', 'idea', 'what', 'hero', 'what', 'hero', 'helped', 'understand', 'real-life', 'heroes', 'are', 'better', 'ones', 'read', 'literature', 'often', 'see', 'movies', 'Real', 'life', 'heroes', 'are', 'kinds', 'people', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'world', 'even', 'do', 'live', 'somewhat', 'mundane', 'lives', 'truth', ""n't"", 'just', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'often', 'more', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson fans will be gravely disappointed. Some very clever ideas, especially visual, but it falls apart because of its overall lack of appeal. A more attractive, more romantic lead with comedic overtones and a funny sidekick would have worked better than trying to make Ferrell play it straight and romantic, with only the oddity of his situations to get him laughs. And Thompson is downright depressing. Dustin Hoffman is interesting but still less-than-spectacular as the lit. prof.

I would like to pump a million babies into her.While I was expecting this movie to have some sort of romance aspect, I didn't think it would be her character right away. Yet her presence was well observed by me from the first frame of her lovely face. What a sweet, sweet baker, Ana Pasquel.I dug this movie, as I knew I would. However it is not as dark as I expected it to be.

Although, much of the same, bizzare, somewhat silly, mind screw situations that made all of those movies great.Will Ferrel is great as HArold Crick. A man who is a succsesful IRS auditor, who has no intention of falling out of his day to day routine. That is, until he starts to hear a voice in his head, narrating his life.Eventually the voice tells him that a malfunction from his wrist watch, is going to result in his imminent death, and this eventually causes him to do away with his standard day to day routine, and make some changes. Also to find out what the deal is with the voice.By the end, you may notice in the back of your head, that certain questions never get answered in this film- but I won't tell you whatt those are, because its all part of the fun. There are a few different character plots.. like the one of the actual woman who is in the process of writing the book about Harold Crick, who is a very strange woman, but an equally enjoyable character.If you like movies that fall off the beaten path, and into a mindbending sort of acid trip, than you will dig this movie... although it does stay shy of getting too dramatic... this one is just for fun.

I know I'm in the minority here, but when a six year old boy acts like a six year old boy, it's cute. When a grwon man does it, it's vaguely diturbing....so for me, Ferrell never delivers. Make that rarely...Because here at last is proof that not only can he be funny, but he has the acting chops to boot. Casting aside the ludicrous and by now formulaic persona he inhabits in other films, here he plays a lead character with heart, sincerity and all the subtleties and nuance to make it ""pop"" The entire cast if wonderful, but you should expect that of them, so it really is Ferrell that makes this such a surprise. Add to that the fact that he actually steals the show, and even manages to steal the show from Dustin Hoffman (where did that come from?), and this is a treat.The story itself is fantastic also. Very well written, so that the twists manage to still surprise you a little, while giving the viewer easy signposts to follow. Other reviews have covered the synopsis, but I will add that to see a movie, much less a comedy with a story again was refreshing to say the least. Very well concieved and reaized, this is a grand exploration of literature, choices and the ways we can affect one another. But, if you're looking for lame gross out shtick and shock value, go rent one of the interminable and tired Scary Movie flicks, because here you'll find another, more subtley realized comedy, and one that is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud, if you're paying attention.Overall, the first comedy in a long time to get five stars from me, and far and away the best movie Ferrell has ever done!

For example, his life is entirely based on his wristwatch. Harold is assigned to audit Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal). She is purposely not paying her taxes, because she simply does not believe in paying taxes. During this process, Harold hears a women's voice. Every time he does something that is routine, he can hear the lady's voice. He is unable to communicate with the voice. In being concerned about this, Harold decides to see university professor Jules Hilbert (Justin Hoffman). Jules comes to the same conclusion that a psychologist would come to. Harold's life is so dull; it is unlikely for it appear in any novels. Jules encourages Harold to determine (if indeed his life is a character from a novel) if he is a work of tragedy or comedy, to help find the author.As Harold audits Ana, slowly he falls in love with her, and she also. However, when Ana offers cookies to Harold, he refuses saying they could not be used on the count of bribe. Ana is angered by this, and she tells him to leave.Harold returns to his apartment and while he is watching TV, a crane crashes through his apartment symbolizing that he has no control of his life.Overall, ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a great film, that is writing wonderfully well by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Forster.",4,Do you have control of your life?,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,1530,"['What', 'would', 'life', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'was', 'control', 'life', 'How', 'one', 'live', 'not', 'knowing', 'sure', 'making', 'own', 'decision', 'not', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'IRS', 'agent', 'Harold', 'Crick', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'very', 'routine', 'based', 'life', 'example', 'life', 'entirely', 'based', 'wristwatch', 'Harold', 'assigned', 'audit', 'Ana', 'Pascal', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'purposely', 'not', 'paying', 'taxes', 'simply', 'not', 'believe', 'paying', 'taxes', 'process', 'Harold', 'women', 'voice', 'time', 'something', 'routine', 'can', 'hear', 'lady', 'voice', 'unable', 'communicate', 'voice', 'being', 'concerned', 'Harold', 'see', 'university', 'professor', 'Jules', 'Hilbert', 'Justin', 'Hoffman', 'Jules', 'same', 'conclusion', 'psychologist', 'would', 'come', 'Harold', 'life', 'so', 'dull', 'unlikely', 'appear', 'novels', 'Jules', 'Harold', 'determine', 'indeed', 'life', 'character', 'novel', 'work', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'help', 'find', 'author.As', 'Harold', 'audits', 'Ana', 'slowly', 'love', 'also', 'However', 'when', 'Ana', 'cookies', 'Harold', 'saying', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'count', 'bribe', 'Ana', 'angered', 'leave.Harold', 'returns', 'apartment', 'watching', 'TV', 'crane', 'crashes', 'apartment', 'symbolizing', 'control', 'life.Overall', 'Stranger', 'Fiction', 'great', 'film', 'writing', 'wonderfully', 'well', 'Zach', 'Helm', 'directed', 'Marc', 'Forster']",N/A

Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","Stranger Than Fiction is the story of a straight-laced IRS agent who wakes up one morning to find that he can hear a narrator detailing his every action and thought. Suffice it to say he's ""weirded out"", until the voice mentions that his immenint death is approaching. At this point, he sets out to find out who the narrator is and why he's going to die.Will Ferrell continues to expand his film repertoire. In Stranger Than Fiction, he proves he's got the dramatic capability to handle deep emotions and a bland character without becoming boring. This shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone who's seen any of Farrell's other movies. Even during slapstick comedy, there's a hint of a genuine human behind the character's Farrell creates.The rest of the cast is equally strong. Maggie Gyllenhaal (although only given a passing notice in the trailer) is actually the other half of the romantic duo in this romantic dramedy... if that's what it can be classified as. She creates a very real person out of what could have been an over-the-top tax-evading ultra-liberal bakery owner. The chemistry between Farrell and Gyllenhaal is great.Emma Thompson brings the drama back to the film with her depressed writer character and Dustin Hoffman seems to be reprising his role from I Heart Huckabees as a linguistics professor seeking to help Farrell figure out what's happening to him. Why is Queen Latifah in this movie? I guess the questions the producers asked was ""why not?"" Other than that, I have no answer, but her character is pretty nondescript and she manages to play it in a pretty nondescript way. Really, it could have been anyone. Tony Hale, of Arrested Development fame, makes a small, seemingly forgettable character into a thrill to watch.The story is a little convoluted and there are plenty of points that could be brought up questioning the randomness with which some of Harold Crick's actions are described directly by the narrator, while some obviously are not (such as talking to the writer himself, because she's obviously not writing while he's talking to her). Overall, though, the film is so genuinely enjoyable that it's not worth questioning the finer points.There are plenty of extras on this DVD.

She's up there in the top two of my favorite actor list, back and forth in slot one. Okay, and I was once married to an IRS man, and I've been involved with those uptight OCD types... and I am a baffled creative writer mind, too... so this became just too irresistable to pass up.Not disappointed. Not one bit. ""Stranger Than Fiction"" was just too much fun. From grand opening line to grand twisted if not overly surprising finish, loved every screen shot, every line of literary dialogue. Or monologue (Thompson's voice narrates the life of her character, predicting his imminent death, all of which he hears as a voice coming out of nowhere). Emma Thompson (as blocked award-winning writer Karen Effiel) makes a terrific eccentric novelist, Ferrell (as Harold Crick, her main character) won points with me as a more serious, wacky, neurotic auditor, perhaps only the romantic side story got a sapped out wince out of me at moments.
