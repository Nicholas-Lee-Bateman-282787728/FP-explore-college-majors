But what a nice surprise to discover what must be one of B.B.'s better live shows! The sound is superb and the camerawork was great. B.B. was obviously in top form on the date this show was recorded ('90 or '91, I'm guessing). He sounds really good and has a very talented band, too. It's obvious that the audience was happy to become a part of the show on several of the tracks. Even if you're not a B.B. King fan, you should enjoy this concert.",5,Outstanding presentation!,1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,537,"['Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'priced', 'so', 'inexpensively', 'what', 'nice', 'surprise', 'discover', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'B.B', 'better', 'live', 'shows', 'sound', 'superb', 'camerawork', 'was', 'great', 'B.B', 'was', 'obviously', 'top', 'form', 'date', 'show', 'was', 'recorded', ""'90"", ""'91"", ""'m"", 'guessing', 'really', 'good', 'very', 'talented', 'band', 'too', 'obvious', 'audience', 'was', 'happy', 'become', 'part', 'show', 'several', 'tracks', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'B.B', 'King', 'fan', 'should', 'enjoy', 'concert']",N/A

1027440,A12S5XTMAHYYME,B000JJSL6M,Perry Celestino,"[24, 24]","This DVD was delayed in its release for some reason, but we are glad to have it. Material on the ""Chairman of the Board of the Blues"" is getting a bit hard to find. B.B. has had some recent releases such as ""By Request"" and ""The Jazz Channel Presents"" but they show an older, slower player who is still delightful, but not the man we have seen over the years.This set is fantastic. B.B. is standing during the entire performance and he has the tight fantastic band he toured with for about 15 years. It features many great musicians including the dancing trumpet player (James Bolin) and excellent bass player (Michael Doster) and his nephew Walter King as the Musical Director. The show was filmed in Atlantic City in the early 1990s at the Trump Hotel. B.B. is in great form and goes through a selection of his most famous tunes such as ""Why I Sing The Blues"",""Paying The Cost To Be the Boss"",  ""Let The Good Times Roll"" and ""The Thrill is Gone"". And also some less known ones such as ""I'll Still Be Around"" and ""I'm A Poor Man But I'm A Good Man (an old Delta tune)"".This DVD is a must for Blues lovers. B.B. is now over 80 and this concert along with ""Live At Nick's"" and ""Blues Master: Performances"" are just about his best filmed work. His most interesting set is ""Live In Africa"" with a colossal Big Band (0ver 30 pieces) and Larry Carlton on second guitar. His interpretation of ""Sweet Sixteen"", to me, is B.B.'s best ever filmed tune. I have a rare clip from VHS of B.B. doing ""Don't Cut Your Hair"" at the Cafe au GoGo in NY in the 1960s-I wish we could get that one! Also his original TV performance on Jazz Casual PBS in the US is very worthwhile. Mr King is a musical treasure and more archival material needs to be found and released on him in his prime (we need the Fillmore concerts put out with everyone like B.B., Albert and Freddie King).However, for now, this is a journey into the recent past with a healthier and younger B.B. King playing to an enthusiastic and appreciative audience. The sound is good and the set is about 62 minutes.",5,B.B.

1027441,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000JJSL6M,Phil S.,"[0, 0]","Very good show, well-captured by a very competent crew - and somebody actually decided to use alot of close-ups of B.B.'s dexterous, melodious picking. Typically, though, the audience is not realy integrated into the experience. (Maybe a good choice - seems the audience was heavily composed of Blackjack losers).This set contains more instrumentalizing than usual, but this nod to the more jazz-oriented fans wil not be found objectionable to the fan/record collector.B. B. sings well, though more in a mellow mode, as if he's conserving energyfor a midnite show. Either way, ""Guess Who"" is magic.Another highlight is Trade Martin's ""Peace To The World"", a classic Inspirational Rocker, just a taste away from the blues.Great ""extra"" - a 1985 audio interview with the superstar.",4,"B.
