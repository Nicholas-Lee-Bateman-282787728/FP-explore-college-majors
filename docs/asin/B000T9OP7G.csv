The Sarah Connor Chronicles does NOT pretend T3 doesn't exist, it addressed one of major issues in the film in its first 2 episodes.  And since this is sci-fi, complete with time travel, there's no reason that history (even future history) can't be re-written.To the folks who think the action is ""great...for a t.v. show,"" I can only assume they haven't been watching t.v. in the last 10 years or so.  There have been several shows that far eclipse what is being done in movies (Buffy, Alias, two more girl-power shows just off the top of my head).What really surprised me about the show is how faithful it is to the first and second movies.  In just this shortened (9 episodes) first season, we've seen the following characters from the films appear: Miles Dyson's widow and son, Dr. Silverman, Enrique and Kyle Reese.As for the cast, Lena Headly is no Linda Hamilton, but her voice-overs became more and more convincing and even poignant as the episodes progressed.  And of course, what sci-fi geek didn't salivate over the news ofFirefly - The Complete Series's Summer Glau being cast in the pivotal role of female cyborg Cameron.  And considering John Connor has been played by 3 different actors, Thomas Decker acquits himself quite well.  He's less irritating than Edward Furlong, by a long shot.If the show has a flaw, it's that at times it does feel a little too familiar.  One has to wonder how long the writers will be able to sustain Sarah and John's journey, without really damaging the integrity of the film series.  And I realize CGI is the norm for special effects these days, but give me a REAL metal (or at least plastic that looks like metal) endoskeleton over this computer-generated mess any day.I think The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a fine continuation of the Terminator universe.  No, it's not that rare series that's actually BETTER than the movies (OK, it's not THAT rare in sci-fi...seeStargate SG-1 - The Complete Series CollectionorBuffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)), but it's certainly among the best t.v. adaptations of movie storyline.

Jones is very good as the FBI agent who senses there is much more behind all this.If you don't take this all too seriously (who does?) you're in for a ride.Of course I would have wanted more episodes in this season but because of the writers strike there are none. Well, less is more. Better this way than having a few more but written by amateurs.Blu-ray is state of the art. Also the extras are nice to watch.

1088761,A1VJ0V58N0698J,B000T9OP7G,"Angel_Pen ""angel_rising""","[2, 20]","The only value to gain from watching this series is that the writing is so bad, you wish Sky-Net would take over the world sooner.I never make a negative comment on a brand new concept because at least it is an experiment in entertainment, but, the Terminator formula is not new, it is a very basic plot about a relentless killing machine which travels through time to kill a human. The fact that the machine has no feelings, looks scary and it is unstopable makes the first Terminator a succesful story, and even though one would think that replicating the same formula would be easy as pie, yet, sequel after sequel, year after year, new untalented writers and producers manage to pitch their idiotic ideas and alter the original plot to the detriment of Terminator fans. This TV series is a perfect example of how you can take a good concept (The original Terminator) and turn it into garbish.I don't really blame the actors, I can see how they are trying their earnest while the director and the writers are pissing the Terminator franchise away, not hard to do after Terminator 3. In any case, starting an episode with a cheesy dream sequence is stuff I have not seen since my first year in film school. No imagination.Months ago, when I saw this pilot at Comic-Con and it was awful. After a second viewing on TV, it realized it was worse than I thought.Watching the free pilot on Amazon was great because it allows you to fast-forward over all the bad parts, that is 90% of the show just to see Summer Glau, the only reason why anyone would want to see this mess is her. Poor Summer Glau does not look at all like a Terminator, the laws of physics go out the window when she fights heavier meaner robots, because of her natural sweetness she is clearly a misguided casting choice, the role of a mean killing machine may end up killing her career. She does not handle it as well as she did on Serenity and I truly hope she makes a difficult professional choice and quits this series before it is too late and get a job doing something more suitable for her.There is so much that is wrong with the execution of the Chronicles, for starters the ""concept"" is completely misguided, a series about Sarah Connor and her son, no exactly an interesting pair. The fact is nobody cares about this pair of dysfunctional misfits getting shot at every five minutes (unless you are a misfit who gets shot at all the time). When they aren't docking bullets, there is lots of repetitive filler chit-chat between them, it is a soap opera, just not a very good one as it could have been.Of course, if you came here to buy something that you can get for free on your TV, then your definition of ridiculous could be different from mine, and you may love this show. For the other half of the population, I would say stay away and do not support bad television.There is only one reason to watch this show, and it is of course Summer Glau, who is still yummy eye candy even while surrounded by the absolute mediocrity created by the writers. To what she would probably say: ""Take a picture it will last you longer.""I just watched the last episode ""The Devil's Hand"" for free on TV just to see if there were any improvements or merciful evolution in quality, and it was just as bad if not worse. On this one they have Summer learning ballet! I am sorry but if Arnold had danced ballet on the original movie...no one would have come to see the movie and there would not be a series.Of course, the series has been inexplicably renewed despite the bad reviews, not surprisingly since it was renewed by the same people that made the mistake of making it in the first place. (Fox is notorious for dragging a dead horse until there is nothing left to squeeze out of it) Don't think that because Fox hasn't canceled the show that means it has good rating, all it means is that it is cheap to produce and the actor are been payed miserably. ""Galactica"" is a perfect example of a show that no one saw when it was on cable and now they are trying to shove down your throat.Remember, if you don't buy this episodes then you are forcing them to write better shows in the future...no pun intended.",1,Almost as Bad as Battlestar Galactica,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,4165,"['only', 'value', 'gain', 'watching', 'series', 'writing', 'so', 'bad', 'wish', 'Sky-Net', 'would', 'take', 'world', 'sooner.I', 'never', 'make', 'negative', 'comment', 'brand', 'new', 'concept', 'least', 'experiment', 'entertainment', 'Terminator', 'formula', 'not', 'new', 'very', 'basic', 'plot', 'relentless', 'killing', 'machine', 'time', 'kill', 'human', 'fact', 'machine', 'feelings', 'scary', 'unstopable', 'first', 'Terminator', 'succesful', 'story', 'even', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'replicating', 'same', 'formula', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'pie', 'yet', 'sequel', 'sequel', 'year', 'year', 'new', 'untalented', 'writers', 'producers', 'manage', 'pitch', 'idiotic', 'ideas', 'alter', 'original', 'plot', 'detriment', 'Terminator', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'can', 'take', 'good', 'concept', 'original', 'Terminator', 'turn', 'garbish.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'actors', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'trying', 'earnest', 'director', 'writers', 'are', 'pissing', 'Terminator', 'franchise', 'away', 'not', 'hard', 'do', 'Terminator', '3', 'case', 'starting', 'episode', 'cheesy', 'dream', 'sequence', 'stuff', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'year', 'film', 'school', 'imagination.Months', 'ago', 'when', 'saw', 'pilot', 'Comic-Con', 'was', 'awful', 'second', 'viewing', 'TV', 'realized', 'was', 'worse', 'thought.Watching', 'free', 'pilot', 'Amazon', 'was', 'great', 'fast-forward', 'bad', 'parts', '90', '%', 'show', 'just', 'see', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'mess', 'Poor', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'not', 'look', 'Terminator', 'laws', 'physics', 'go', 'out', 'window', 'when', 'heavier', 'meaner', 'robots', 'natural', 'sweetness', 'clearly', 'misguided', 'casting', 'choice', 'role', 'mean', 'killing', 'machine', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'career', 'not', 'handle', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Serenity', 'truly', 'hope', 'difficult', 'professional', 'choice', 'series', 'too', 'late', 'get', 'job', 'doing', 'something', 'more', 'suitable', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'execution', 'Chronicles', 'starters', 'concept', 'completely', 'misguided', 'series', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'son', 'exactly', 'interesting', 'pair', 'fact', 'nobody', 'cares', 'pair', 'dysfunctional', 'misfits', 'getting', 'shot', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'misfit', 'who', 'shot', 'time', 'When', 'are', ""n't"", 'docking', 'bullets', 'lots', 'repetitive', 'filler', 'chit-chat', 'soap', 'opera', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been.Of', 'course', 'came', 'here', 'buy', 'something', 'can', 'get', 'free', 'TV', 'then', 'definition', 'ridiculous', 'could', 'be', 'different', 'mine', 'may', 'love', 'show', 'other', 'half', 'population', 'would', 'say', 'stay', 'away', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'bad', 'television.There', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'watch', 'show', 'course', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'who', 'still', 'yummy', 'eye', 'candy', 'even', 'surrounded', 'absolute', 'mediocrity', 'created', 'writers', 'what', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'Take', 'picture', 'will', 'last', 'longer', 'just', 'watched', 'last', 'episode', 'Devil', 'Hand', 'free', 'TV', 'just', 'see', 'were', 'improvements', 'merciful', 'evolution', 'quality', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'not', 'worse', 'one', 'have', 'Summer', 'learning', 'ballet', 'am', 'sorry', 'Arnold', 'had', 'danced', 'ballet', 'original', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'movie', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'series.Of', 'course', 'series', 'been', 'inexplicably', 'renewed', 'bad', 'reviews', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'renewed', 'same', 'people', 'made', 'mistake', 'making', 'first', 'place', 'Fox', 'notorious', 'dragging', 'dead', 'horse', 'nothing', 'left', 'squeeze', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Fox', ""n't"", 'canceled', 'show', 'good', 'rating', 'cheap', 'produce', 'actor', 'are', 'been', 'payed', 'miserably', 'Galactica', 'perfect', 'example', 'show', 'one', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'cable', 'now', 'are', 'trying', 'shove', 'down', 'throat.Remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'then', 'are', 'forcing', 'write', 'better', 'shows', 'future', 'pun', 'intended']","Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 1"

To me, the series' main accent was not on the action, but on the questions such as determinism vs free will, interaction and comparison between a human and an AI, and ethical questions arising in a guerrilla-style warfare.The character development in the series is a guilty pleasure.  John Connor grows from a rebellious teenager to an unwilling leader, terminator Cameron - from a blunt instrument to a machine trying to understand and experience human emotions, Catherine Weaver - from T-1001 to a mother of one machine and one human child, and John Henry - from a computer program to play chess to the artificial intelligence that values human life.Last but not least, TSCC portrays a fascinating place where the terminators cite the Biblical parables to justify or explain actions.  One of my ( many ) favorite moments is when Cameron explains to Sarah the Biblical reference to the story of the brothers of Nablus.  Another great moment is when John Henry asks his terminator &#34;mother&#34; Catherine Weaver about the story of Cain and Abel.  There are quite a few other references, which may be interesting to a man of faith.In conclusion, TSCC is one of my favorite shows.

Watching the &#34;Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 1 without commercials made the show much more enjoyable for me.  The continuity was just &#34;there.&#34;  I saw Season 1, for the most part, when it ran on TV.  I did not initially appreciate Sarah (Lena Headey) because she was always worried.  Well, I have learned that her character has to be worried - she is trying to avoid an apocalypse. None-the-less, it wasn't until I genuinely appreciated her the 2nd time I saw Season 1 without commercials.  Season 1, John Connor (Thomas Dekker) was a boy.  As the young John Connor, I believed.  He was a great kid and knew he was meant for greater things and, I believed.  Cameron (Summer Glau) is amazing in anything she does.  Her dancing skill took her into the Terminator role with perfection.  She was a child in Fire Fly but as Cameron she is a female Terminator.  James Ellison was such a kick for me to see back on the Tube! I loved him (Richard T. Jones) in Judging Ammy as Bruce Van  Exel.  As James Ellison, he had the right stuff to match Cameron as well as Sarah.  He is just FUN to watch in this scifi series.  Garret Dillahunt as Cromartie was exciting but as John Henry, he was amazing.  The interaction between Ellison and John Henry was fabulous and the quality of their dialog was, again just FUN ! Sorry I blended Season 1 and Season 2 with Ellison and John Henry.  Season 1 and Season 2 are seamless with Amazon Prime.  We just joined again for the second time - I love Amazon Prime particularly when they throw in some freebees I didn't know about.  Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 1 - EXCELLENT ! ! !

Her offbeat character in ""Firefly"" makes Summer Glau the perfect cyborg choice to protect young John Connor who is destined to fight machines who will take over the world in the future.A writers strike during the first season left only 9 episodes in the can but well worth the DVD purchase.

I saw almost all of the episodes on TV and just missed so much trying to follow along week to week. Then I purchased the DVD season 1.Wow! This series is just amazing. The writing is some of the best I can remember seeing in a Sc-Fi TV series in a long time since possibly Star Gate SG-1 or Firefly. Sure it's not a perfect tie-in to the movies, but the movies lost me after #2. Movie #3 is good, but #4 was puzzling. This DVD series makes up for all of that.The final episode was so incredibly moving. I can't imagine that I would have felt it as deeply watching each episode one week at a time. Watch these back to back to back and it will have so much more of an impact on you.

This was a great fist two seasons and was getting better each show. The directing, acting, production and casting is the equal of any great SiFi series you may know like BSG or Stargate Universe, IMHO.Lena Headey playing Sarah Connors is adequate although I prefer Linda Hamilton. I think this is just a matter of taste on my part. Thomas Dekker playing John Conner I find more convincing with more screen presence than Edward Furlong in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I find Furlong spends too much time screaming in a way I find very annoying in Judgement Day. This could be the fault of the directing I suppose. Nick Stahl as Connor in The Rise of the Machine was far better than either Furlong or Dekker. I thought Stahl was perfect for John's part . . . moody, introverted but with the ability to take on a commanding presence when needed which Dekker doesn't really seem to have.Speaking of The Rise of the Machine, Clair Danes is a wonderful addition to the cast of The Rise of the Machines, IMO. And what about Arnold. Well . . . there is only one Arnold.An interesting alternative supplied in The Sarah Conner Chronicles is Cameron Phillips playing the helpful Terminator. Summer Glau is a screen stealer in almost every episode. She is cold, calculating, lethal and everything a Terminator should be.The excellent cast continues with the acting of Richard Jones as FBI agent James Ellison, and Brian Austin Green as Derik Reese, cousin to Kyle Reese, father of John Conner.Everything considered this was looking like a winner for several more seasons.

Summer Glau, always the expert at playing emotionally distant characters, makes for a great terminator. The special effects on the terminators are good enough to be convincing for a TV show.Where the show falters though is in the overarching story. Individual episodes are good at keeping your attention, but the overarching story is a bit fuzzy. Sarah Connor's goal is of course to stop Skynet, but that goal seems so distant in most episodes as to be irrelevant. The plot has a lot of dead ends and character development comes in fits and spurts. In some cases there are more immediate concerns, such as saving yet another person who is important to the Resistance in the future, but it's hard to become too invested in these arcs knowing the outcome.In short, this is a fun series, but it's not clear that this is a story that needed a TV show.",4,interesting take on the Terminator,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,1205,"['Sarah', 'Connor', 'Chronicles', 'very', 'different', 'Terminator', 'movies', 'Where', 'were', 'self-contained', 'movies', 'single', 'terminator', 'series', 'multiple', 'interweaving', 'story', 'lines', 'multiple', 'terminators', 'However', 'show', 'generally', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'actually', 'compelling', 'Sarah', 'Connor', ""n't"", 'quite', 'look', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'always', 'expert', 'playing', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'characters', 'great', 'terminator', 'special', 'effects', 'terminators', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'convincing', 'TV', 'show.Where', 'show', 'though', 'overarching', 'story', 'Individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'keeping', 'attention', 'overarching', 'story', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'goal', 'course', 'stop', 'Skynet', 'goal', 'so', 'distant', 'most', 'episodes', 'be', 'irrelevant', 'plot', 'lot', 'dead', 'ends', 'character', 'development', 'fits', 'spurts', 'cases', 'are', 'more', 'immediate', 'concerns', 'such', 'saving', 'yet', 'person', 'who', 'important', 'Resistance', 'future', 'hard', 'become', 'too', 'invested', 'arcs', 'knowing', 'outcome.In', 'short', 'fun', 'series', 'not', 'clear', 'story', 'needed', 'TV', 'show']","Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 1"

But, after having watched many shows with 26 episodes per season and wishing some of those episodes hadn't been made (Star Trek: The Next Generation, for example), this show comes across as tightly written and focused. A shorter season forces the writer(s) to make every episode great.  When you've got to bang out 26 episodes, you're bound to get some clunkers, which isn't the case here.The show starts with Sarah and John Connor hiding in middle America, where they live with Sarah's unsuspecting boyfriend, a nice guy who knows nothing about Sarah and John's past.  Pretty soon, a ""bad"" Terminator rolls into town and attempts to take John out at his high school, where he's helped by a ""good"" Terminator, played by Summer Glau.  That pretty much sets up the start of the show, with the Connors and the ""good"" Terminator taking flight.  I won't spoil the story for you, but only say that the pace picks up from there.Screenwriter Josh Friedman has done a good job fleshing out the gap between Terminators 2 and 3 here.  Lena Headey (Sarah), Thomas Dekker (John), Summer Glau (Good Terminator), Richard T. Jones (FBI agent), Garrett Dillahunt (Bad Terminator), and Dean Winters (the boyfriend) all do a fantastic job.  Glau is especially convincing in one episode where she contemplates killing one of John's high-school friends.  Most surprising is Brian Austin Green of ""90210"" fame.  He plays Kyle Reese's older brother and appears to have matured from his younger days into a solid actor.I didn't see any cool liquid-metal action in the first season.

As such I'm more open-minded than most, and I've noticed more than a few things about this series that others have been missing.First off the premise, and the descriptions given by others, can be very misleading. This series is by no means a 'true sequel to T2', nor does it replace or ignore T3. This series is really a sequel to the established story. It alters the timeline from a previous point and causes the entire story to scew into something completely new. If you really want to get the most out of this series, watch it after viewing the films (and if you want, playing the games).Secondly, the series itself does have some flaws that could be deal breakers to some. For one thing, you'd best be a fan of modern 'indy' filming. The series will barrage you with a series of split second shots and unsteady camera work. Most of the time you won't really be able to tell what's going on. Some people like the energy this style has, others find it confusing and even annoying.The acting is solid all around, but the writing can be so-so. The series bounces between action sci-fi with a well developed plot and a soap opera for teens. It quickly becomes clear that the reason they set the series in modern day and violated the timeline was so they could focus on John's struggle with puberty. As such there will be times that Sara and Co. will be fleeing and fighting various Cyborg death machines and uncovering conspiracies, and other times we watch as John goes to school, feels awkward, and tries to get friends (mostly to get laid). It does have the spirit of the films, but it also has a strong vein of 90210, Beverly Hills, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.It's still a great show, especially by modern standards.

1088823,A319SKSB556033,B000T9OP7G,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[4, 18]","As much as fans eventually hated it, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines [Blu-ray] is lights years ahead of this tedious show. You might end up wondering how the timeline in this show can exist considering the story of T3, but if you consider that this was Skynet's fourth attempt at killing John Connor AFTER the TX failed then it would create a tangent timeline in which the events of T3 would never happen.The show doesn't even attempt to explain this to us, however. I hate exposition as much as the next viewer, but TSCC has no sense of time, character or importance of event. Nothing is clearly presented to the audience and it's hard to keep with the barely interesting story. It's bad writing, plain and simple. And the constant in-jokes (a robot called Cameron, a character called William Wisher) are another sign of lazy writing which leads me to believe that the show is written by fanboys instead of qualified writers. Even this I could turn a blind eye to if they stayed true to the original story, but they tamper with too much of James Cameron's history. For example; Kyle Reese says he grew up after the nuclear war inThe Terminator [Blu-ray], but here we see him and his previously unmentioned brother playing baseball on Judgment Day (now moved to 2011). And why didn't Skynet send back another T1000 instead of the old T800? It's not model 101 this time since Arnie wouldn't embarrass himself with trash like this, but it would have made sense to send a mimetic poly-alloy instead of the metal endo-skeleton surrounded by living tissue.However, doing it that way might have ended the show on day one, and the folks at the WB need to s-t-r-e-t-c-h this junk out as far as possible.Lena Headey is visually similar to Linda Hamilton, but I never liked the direction they took the character inTerminator 2: Judgment Day [Blu-ray], where she becomes hardcore warrior (almost a human terminator herself) who narrates every scene with a pointless and pretentious voice-over. There's very little to like about her in this show, mostly because she never displays any kind of affection for anyone around her, even her son.Summer Glau is the only reason for watching this. Any scene that does not feature her threatens to kill the series dead on the spot. Some of this stuff is really painful, especially the Dr. Silberman plot. Not only is it incredibly disrespectful to what James Cameron had created, but they didn't even get Earl Boen back. Instead they got someone who looks and acts nothing like him. It feels like a totally different person and you can tell that he's only in there to stretch the lumbering story out further. Even composer Bear McReary seems frightened of using Brad Fiedel's iconic Terminator theme (and, let's be honest, it was the only noteworthy theme in Feidel's lackluster career). The score for the show is instead made up of noises and sound effects with the slightest of themes repeated in each episode with no variation. Plus, the existence of the Terminators after the destruction of Cyberdyne is still not clearly explained either.I know a lot of shows struggle during their first season, maybe this is why the network gave TSCC the benefit of the doubt and ordered a full second season. But this nine episode Blu Ray is only worth the money if your a serious fan, and even then you're likely to be disappointed.The Blu Ray features a 1.78:1 1080p picture that doesn't impress a helluva lot and an adequate sound design with lots of extras I couldn't care less about.",2,Poorly written drivel that barely manages to stay afloat thanks to the brand name,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,3510,"['As', 'much', 'fans', 'eventually', 'hated', 'Terminator', '3', 'Rise', 'Machines', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'lights', 'years', 'ahead', 'tedious', 'show', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'how', 'timeline', 'show', 'can', 'exist', 'considering', 'story', 'T3', 'consider', 'was', 'Skynet', 'fourth', 'attempt', 'killing', 'John', 'Connor', 'AFTER', 'TX', 'failed', 'then', 'would', 'create', 'tangent', 'timeline', 'events', 'T3', 'would', 'never', 'happen.The', 'show', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'explain', 'however', 'hate', 'exposition', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'viewer', 'TSCC', 'sense', 'time', 'character', 'importance', 'event', 'Nothing', 'clearly', 'presented', 'audience', 'hard', 'keep', 'barely', 'interesting', 'story', 'bad', 'writing', 'plain', 'simple', 'constant', 'in-jokes', 'robot', 'called', 'Cameron', 'character', 'called', 'William', 'Wisher', 'are', 'sign', 'lazy', 'writing', 'believe', 'show', 'written', 'fanboys', 'instead', 'qualified', 'writers', 'Even', 'could', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'stayed', 'true', 'original', 'story', 'tamper', 'too', 'much', 'James', 'Cameron', 'history', 'example', 'Kyle', 'Reese', 'grew', 'up', 'nuclear', 'war', 'inThe', 'Terminator', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'here', 'see', 'previously', 'unmentioned', 'brother', 'playing', 'baseball', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'now', 'moved', '2011', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Skynet', 'send', 'back', 'T1000', 'instead', 'old', 'T800', 'not', 'model', '101', 'time', 'Arnie', 'would', ""n't"", 'embarrass', 'trash', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'send', 'mimetic', 'poly-alloy', 'instead', 'metal', 'endo-skeleton', 'surrounded', 'living', 'tissue.However', 'doing', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'show', 'day', 'one', 'folks', 'WB', 'need', 's-t-r-e-t-c-h', 'junk', 'out', 'as', 'far', 'possible.Lena', 'Headey', 'visually', 'similar', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'never', 'liked', 'direction', 'took', 'character', 'inTerminator', '2', 'Judgment', 'Day', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'where', 'hardcore', 'warrior', 'almost', 'human', 'terminator', 'who', 'scene', 'pointless', 'pretentious', 'voice-over', 'very', 'little', 'like', 'show', 'mostly', 'never', 'kind', 'affection', 'anyone', 'even', 'son.Summer', 'Glau', 'only', 'reason', 'watching', 'scene', 'not', 'feature', 'threatens', 'kill', 'series', 'dead', 'spot', 'stuff', 'really', 'painful', 'especially', 'Dr.', 'Silberman', 'plot', 'Not', 'only', 'incredibly', 'what', 'James', 'Cameron', 'had', 'created', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'Earl', 'Boen', 'back', 'Instead', 'got', 'someone', 'who', 'nothing', 'totally', 'different', 'person', 'can', 'tell', 'only', 'there', 'stretch', 'lumbering', 'story', 'further', 'Even', 'composer', 'Bear', 'McReary', 'frightened', 'using', 'Brad', 'Fiedel', 'iconic', 'Terminator', 'theme', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'only', 'noteworthy', 'theme', 'Feidel', 'lackluster', 'career', 'score', 'show', 'instead', 'made', 'noises', 'sound', 'effects', 'slightest', 'themes', 'repeated', 'episode', 'variation', 'existence', 'Terminators', 'destruction', 'Cyberdyne', 'still', 'not', 'clearly', 'explained', 'either.I', 'know', 'lot', 'shows', 'struggle', 'first', 'season', 'maybe', 'why', 'network', 'gave', 'TSCC', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'ordered', 'full', 'second', 'season', 'nine', 'episode', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'only', 'worth', 'money', 'serious', 'fan', 'even', 'then', ""'re"", 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', '1.78:1', '1080p', 'picture', ""n't"", 'impress', 'helluva', 'lot', 'adequate', 'sound', 'design', 'lots', 'extras', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less']","Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 1"

It can give some depth to John himself It can build around him some family or connections. He gets an uncle from the future. It can play on time and that uncle can look at himself in 2007 when he was still a kid playing baseball. It also gives some density to the mother who was pretty shallow in the films. It can show more about these cyborgs, a good one who protects John and the bad ones. The list would be long of all the good points of this series. It has a shortcoming though. In a story that relies a lot on believing in the vast ellipses it uses, if you want to get down to gritty details you may run into some contradictions. And we do. We need the FBI agent, for some still unknown reason. So he is saved twice. Once by Sarah Connor herself and the other time by a hostile cyborg. Why? We do not know. It does not though bring anything new to the story. It just brings some pleasure by discovering the deeper personalities of characters we liked and we could not explore enough, like John Connor for one. In this first series they avoided the absence of Schwarzenegger by sending a cyborg who was supposed to be the sister of the very young John Connor, hence his age and the other sex for it to be less suspicious, especially when they are not all the time together. I am expecting the second series some day to see the next stage in that slow travel towards Terminator 3, especially since we left them with a car exploding with John's cyborg sister in it.

While I enjoyed T1 and T2, Terminator 3 left me traumatized. I finally broke down and rented the first DVD of Season 1.The acting was intense and it immersed me into their world.Character development: Some things are rightfully never explained, but inferred. Summer Glau's performance as Cameron (a Terminator) is a prime example, Cameron seems capable of putting on emotions like a person would put on clothing, sometimes they are dressed to the nines, other times not so much. Yet as a viewer I'm not watching Summer Glau. Not really. I'm watching Cameron, I'm watching her behave and try out emotional responses. Her transitions are subtle and often eerie... a machine trying to appear human at times and trying to become human at others. There are differences between her and the other Terminators such as she can make her eyes glow blue (obvious difference) and that her visual display is often fully color instead of the other terminators using infrared. Her motives though stated become giant questions in my mind, after watching her as a Terminator skillfully lie to those she claims to serve and protect.The pacing of character development appears to be a rule adhered throughout the series, no matter which writer wrote an episode or which director directed. Wonderfully crafted.I could write pages about all of the characters and the thought that went behind them. The actors did an amazing job (Lena Headey shows a great mix of being incredibly strong and emotionally vulnerable, you'll believe that she's on the brink of despair and giving up, but it's only her willpower and strength that keeps things going).The individual episodes are for the most part extremely well written and directed. The choreography of the fight scenes are pretty good for a TV series (and re-affirms the Terminators bash each other into things motif from T2) and are completely believable.All in all.. this is surprisingly awesome.I bought both Seasons on DVD and have purchased about 6 copies of Season 1 which I've given away to some of my other friends so that they can watch it too.",5,Surprisingly Awesome.,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2184,"['never', 'watched', 'season', 'was', 'TV', 'Friends', 'recommended', 'feelings', 'were', 'Meh', 'enjoyed', 'T1', 'T2', 'Terminator', '3', 'left', 'traumatized', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'rented', 'first', 'DVD', 'Season', '1.The', 'acting', 'was', 'intense', 'immersed', 'world.Character', 'development', 'things', 'are', 'rightfully', 'never', 'explained', 'inferred', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'performance', 'Cameron', 'Terminator', 'prime', 'example', 'Cameron', 'capable', 'putting', 'emotions', 'person', 'would', 'put', 'clothing', 'sometimes', 'are', 'dressed', 'nines', 'other', 'times', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'viewer', ""'m"", 'not', 'watching', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'Not', 'really', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Cameron', ""'m"", 'watching', 'behave', 'try', 'out', 'emotional', 'responses', 'transitions', 'are', 'subtle', 'often', 'eerie', 'machine', 'trying', 'appear', 'human', 'times', 'trying', 'become', 'human', 'others', 'are', 'differences', 'other', 'Terminators', 'such', 'can', 'make', 'eyes', 'glow', 'blue', 'obvious', 'difference', 'visual', 'display', 'often', 'fully', 'color', 'instead', 'other', 'terminators', 'using', 'infrared', 'motives', 'stated', 'become', 'giant', 'questions', 'mind', 'watching', 'Terminator', 'skillfully', 'serve', 'protect.The', 'pacing', 'character', 'development', 'be', 'rule', 'adhered', 'series', 'matter', 'writer', 'wrote', 'episode', 'director', 'directed', 'Wonderfully', 'crafted.I', 'could', 'write', 'pages', 'characters', 'thought', 'went', 'actors', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'great', 'mix', 'being', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', ""'ll"", 'believe', 'brink', 'despair', 'giving', 'up', 'only', 'willpower', 'strength', 'things', 'going', '.The', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'choreography', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'TV', 'series', 'Terminators', 'bash', 'other', 'things', 'motif', 'T2', 'are', 'completely', 'believable.All', 'all..', 'surprisingly', 'awesome.I', 'bought', 'Seasons', 'DVD', 'have', 'purchased', '6', 'copies', 'Season', '1', ""'ve"", 'given', 'away', 'other', 'friends', 'can', 'watch', 'too']","Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 1"

1088829,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000T9OP7G,Jason,"[11, 12]","To be honest, I have no clue what people can be complaining about with this series.  IF you like Terminator, you should like this.  There's no way Arnold S. and Linda H. were going to sign on for a TV series, so we get their capable replacements instead.The timeline of this series is obviously after the second of the three Terminator movies.  In the second, the viewer is essentially left with all Terminator entities being destroyed, and Sarah Connor protecting her 10-year old son while preparing him for his destiny. Leaving Cyberdyne Systems in ruins, they enlist the help of Miles Dyson to destroy his own research that would eventually lead to Skynet and Judgement Day.In the Sarah Connor Chronicles, Sarah (Lena Heady) and her teenage son John (Thomas Dekker) are fugitive nomads, moving from one remote town to another in order to stay under the radar, not only from the possibility of other Terminators, but also law enforcement.  However, that's not enough, and eventually a new Terminator model named Cameron (Summer Glau) meets up with the mother and son.  Luckily, Cameron is a newer T800 model - obviously prettier than all previous Terminators - sent by John to protect John.Wonderfully cast, with great special effects and acting, the story and drama follows the original storyline smoothly.  Since insiders have noted that this series is in a different timeline than T3, the story-arc can be eliminated for confused linear thinkers.It's very easy to become immersed in the plot for this series, and I'm already hooked.  There are years and years between John's childhood and his ascension to ""Leader of Mankind"", and the only thing in between this series and greatness is a lack of imagination.  The questions left by the first two movies (and even the blank spot between the second and third on that timeline) will be slowly answered, and John's formative years will vividly display how he learns to fulfill his destiny and become the wise, revolutionary leader of all future humankind.Highly recommended for action fans.",5,An answer to whether leaders are born or made - watch the making of John Connor,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,2041,"['be', 'honest', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'complaining', 'series', 'IF', 'like', 'Terminator', 'should', 'like', 'way', 'Arnold', 'S.', 'Linda', 'H.', 'were', 'going', 'sign', 'TV', 'series', 'get', 'capable', 'replacements', 'instead.The', 'timeline', 'series', 'obviously', 'second', 'three', 'Terminator', 'movies', 'second', 'viewer', 'essentially', 'left', 'Terminator', 'entities', 'being', 'destroyed', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'protecting', '10-year', 'old', 'son', 'preparing', 'destiny', 'Leaving', 'Cyberdyne', 'Systems', 'ruins', 'enlist', 'help', 'Miles', 'Dyson', 'destroy', 'own', 'research', 'would', 'eventually', 'lead', 'Skynet', 'Judgement', 'Day.In', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'Chronicles', 'Sarah', 'Lena', 'Heady', 'teenage', 'son', 'John', 'Thomas', 'Dekker', 'are', 'fugitive', 'nomads', 'moving', 'one', 'remote', 'town', 'order', 'stay', 'radar', 'not', 'only', 'possibility', 'other', 'Terminators', 'also', 'law', 'enforcement', 'However', 'not', 'enough', 'eventually', 'new', 'Terminator', 'model', 'named', 'Cameron', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'up', 'mother', 'son', 'Luckily', 'Cameron', 'newer', 'T800', 'model', 'obviously', 'prettier', 'previous', 'Terminators', 'sent', 'John', 'protect', 'John.Wonderfully', 'cast', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'story', 'drama', 'original', 'storyline', 'smoothly', 'insiders', 'have', 'noted', 'series', 'different', 'timeline', 'T3', 'story-arc', 'can', 'be', 'eliminated', 'confused', 'linear', 'thinkers.It', 'very', 'easy', 'become', 'immersed', 'plot', 'series', ""'m"", 'already', 'hooked', 'are', 'years', 'years', 'John', 'childhood', 'ascension', 'Leader', 'Mankind', 'only', 'thing', 'series', 'greatness', 'lack', 'imagination', 'questions', 'left', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'even', 'blank', 'spot', 'second', 'third', 'timeline', 'will', 'be', 'slowly', 'answered', 'John', 'formative', 'years', 'will', 'vividly', 'display', 'how', 'fulfill', 'destiny', 'become', 'wise', 'revolutionary', 'leader', 'future', 'humankind.Highly', 'recommended', 'action', 'fans']","Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 1"

Luckily that is not the case here.This show takes place after T2, and follows John and Sarah as they try and survive and keep a low profile, while avoiding terminators.One day something happens, they are spotted, and they meet a new terminator, sent back in time by John.  This terminator is to protect John, this terminator is played by the beautiful Summer Glau.This show is explosive and pretty big budget.  The special effects look really good, the fight scenes are amazing, and the show has a pretty good cast.  The guest stars are really good too.After you get to episode 4, the show starts getting even better, it settles into more of a series feel.  The first 2-3 episodes feel more like a big movie, then it gets into series territory, and it does a good job.What I did first was put in my terminator blu-ray and watched it, followed by T2.  I forgot how good these movies were, and how awesome Arnold was.  When I watched the first episode of SCC I wasn't sure how this show was going to play out, would it be John and Sarah on the run, trying to avoid Terminators, or would it be something else?  Luckily it is something else, but also some running, the show surprised me, and went places I didn't think they would go, and they do a very good job doing it.  This is a pretty good series, unlike the guy below me, please view more episodes, try and make it to at least episode 5, by then you should be hooked!The video quality is really good.  I'm impressed.  The audio is fantastic.  I love the menus, and the show has some pretty cool special features.

In some like T2, the camera slows down some, music begins, the Terminator comes out, and Sarah is terrified. To me, that's well done. In the series, it's just boring old fights, nothing too exciting to see. Not blaming the show, but it seems like a lot of newer shows and movies has this ""fast pace"" action or something that it looks sped up, and not at normal speed. I hate that. Plus, why SO close to the action? It's too close to enjoy it.

1088854,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B000T9OP7G,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[4, 5]","Have TV shows left behind episodic TV to take on the trappings of the novel? TV is now full of shows that have a vision of the series as a whole with a beginning, middle and end fully plotted before they even hit the screen. Shows like Lost, Hero's, Mad Men, and The Sarah Connor Chronicles have changed how we look at TV shows, and maybe the way we should think about them as well.I have to admit that when the first season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles went on I was excited, being as I'm a fan of The Terminator movies but as I watched the first couple of episodes I lost interest. Then I applied for a job as book reviewer for an ezine and they also wanted the book reviewer to review a science fiction TV series as well, so I picked The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I didn't get the gig reviewing books for that particular ezine but I watched the entire first season in one or two sittings and was able to view it as  a whole and saw the emerging themes and directions the creators of the show were trying to take, and I got excited about the possibilities they were exploring.The Sarah Connor Chronicles picks up after the second Terminator movie. Sarah and John have settled down a bit, Sarah in love and living with a paramedic in Colorado, but they're still doing their best to stay off the grid and not attract attention to themselves. A Terminator shows up at John's school one day as a substitute teacher with a gun implanted in his thigh. When he opens fire and chaos ensues John is saved by Cameron, the cute new girl sitting next to him in class, who seems to be able to take a bullet pretty well. John escapes to the parking lot with the teacher terminator hot on his trail and just as John is cornered Cameron comes out of nowhere with a truck and runs down the terminator, and reveals herself to be a terminator sent by the future John Connor to save his teenage self. John and Cameron find Sarah but the police and the not quite terminated terminator are in hot pursuit of the three of them. Cameron leads them to a bank vault a seeming dead end, but the future John Connor has been planning ahead (or is it behind?) and he's been sending emissaries back in time to set up an infrastructure to protect himself in the past. Cameron rips open safety deposit boxes and starts assembling a device, a time machine, Cameron is going to hide John and Sarah in the future!After the escape to the future John convinces Sarah and Cameron that they can do more than wait for judgment day that they can again go after Skynet and destroy it before it can be built. They also discover that the terminator after John at the school got caught in the time vortex they went through so he's still after them, although he's a bit beat up and needs to reconstitute himself. Another antagonist FBI agent James Ellison is introduced, a police detective who believes Sarah Connor killed some police officers, and this addition has kind of The Fugitive feel to it and never really develops anything passed that.Sarah soon discovers a computer prototype called The Turk that could become Skynet and built by a computer geek Andy Good, but she is able to torch it and unfortunately Andy's dreams. But John Connor isn't the only one salting away things in the past to change the future, Skynet is also stashing things such as a type of steel to build terminators. Sarah discovers that Andy has rebuilt The Turk and she runs off to destroy it (again) but finds she's too late that The Turk has been stolen and Andy Good has been killed by Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle who came back in the first Terminator movie to save her. Derek joins Sarah and John but is distrustful of Cameron and her motives because she is terminator but also because he knew her in the future and isn't convinced she doesn't have a hidden agenda, and some of her actions might indicate she has something to hide, Derek and Sarah discover that Cameron has kept a chip from a terminator but is she keeping it for Skynet's agenda? Or does she have a secret mission from the future John Connor?In one of the more interesting episodes Bruce Davison plays another of his characters bordering on insanity. He's the psychiatrist at the mental institution Sarah escaped from in the second movie and he's stolen a hand from a terminator and Sarah is in a race to retrieve it before FBI agent Ellison does. In the penultimate episode of the season the doubts about Cameron finally come to the surface when it is discovered she saved the chip she was supposed to destroy. Cameron's motivations and actions increasingly are under scrutiny by Sarah. In the final episode Sarah and gang are offered the chance to buy the Turk for half a million dollars, and Sarah's love interest returns, and in the cliffhanging last scene Cameron is blown up by a truck bomb.I hadn't heard of most of the cast before The Sarah Connor Chronicles but in researching this review I found that most of them have pretty solid television credibility having appeared on Hero's, Firefly, and The 300, all pretty solid shows with reputations for smart episodes, so it seems the cast was picked well. The acting is uniformly good it doesn't delve into kitsch or melodramatics and the possibility always exists for those roads to be taken. Brian Austin Green who started his career in the great Spelling schmaltz factory of 90210 had me worried when he came into the show in the third or fourth episode as Derek Reese but he has consistently shown that he has the capabilities of good acting and has even carried the dramatics in a couple of the episodes.Allusion and metaphor aren`t found in a lot of TV shows, in a smartly written show you can find one or the other but not usually both. In the Sarah Conner Chronicles chess is used as a metaphor, and yes, I know chess is an overused metaphor in a lot of things but they didn't belabor the point and it worked in the context of the episode. The themes that are explored in The Sarah Conner Chronicles are more ambitious than in the Terminator movies. The show explores do the terminators cause people to act more machine like? Can machines learn to love man enough to need them? Can man love (come to terms with) his need for machines?Each of the three DVD's have bonus features that are quite a fun enhancement to the set. I enjoyed the actor audition video's especially Lena Headey's. She's an English actress and she effects an American accent quite well and believably but as soon as she drops out of character her English accent is noticeable and almost undecipherable!I think anyone who liked The Terminator movies and wants to explore that world a little deeper will certainly enjoy this series, as well as someone not all that knowledgeable about The Terminator world.",4,Terminated; Episodic TV?,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,6752,"['Have', 'TV', 'shows', 'left', 'behind', 'episodic', 'TV', 'take', 'trappings', 'novel', 'TV', 'now', 'full', 'shows', 'have',

1088859,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000T9OP7G,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 1]","This version of the Terminator narrative is much more sedate, much less driven by the chase, than prior versions; yet it retains important atmospheric qualities.  It features an enemy that our heroes cannot defeat, only outlast.  It maintains T2's ""fight the future"" quality, yet emphasizes the original film's ""keep one step ahead"" pessimism.  Even Bear McCreary's musical themes utilize emotions built up from the first two films' struggle.But the dense atmospherics signal that this series doesn't just recycle the films.  Whereas the classic originals occur substantially at night, with a gloomy noir ambiance, this series makes contrasts between night and day, as between good and evil.  Even while characters like Derek Reese muddy moral boundaries, this series emphasizes that morality does exist, and we have an obligation to fight for our beliefs and our ethics.The introduction of religious themes, never used in the movies, gives this series a depth not previously plumbed.  Sometimes this gets silly, as when Agent Ellison and Doctor Silverman debate whether Sarah Connor is a prophet.  But it also gives the characters a concrete purpose; they don't just keep fighting because they must, or to prevent hypothetical catastrophe, but because they know the fight is, in itself, right.But this alternate to the fatally absurd T3 marks a powerful switch to the franchise mythology.  Since Terminators still drop into Sarah Connor's life, fate appears inevitable.  There really is a fate other than what we make, Sarah.  Moving Judgment Day from the T2 date to a new timeline requires some adjustment to the prior narrative, yet emphasizes that destiny can only be postponed, not overthrown.  Pretty pessimistic.Therefore this creates a distinct modern mythology, in which morality exists, but God only participates part-time.  Humankind fights for right, but we have only vague parameters, and we define rightness on a situational basis.  Thus different moralities, like Derek Reese's versus Charlie Dixon's, or Agent Ellison's versus Sarah Connor's, assume equal weight, and when they come into conflict, we must subjectively identify which ""right"" applies to which situation.Thus, despite utilizing prior Terminator narrative, this series creates an entirely new experience.  Instead of letting social mythology poke through excitement and adrenaline, this show's cerebral, character-driven story gives way to moments of stirring excitement.  It demands that we watch it differently than the films, which have been inconsistent at best.  And it provides rewards that will outlast the show's unfortunately brief network run.",4,Dark Religion,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,2633,"['version', 'Terminator', 'narrative', 'much', 'more', 'sedate', 'much', 'less', 'driven', 'chase', 'prior', 'versions', 'important', 'atmospheric', 'qualities', 'enemy', 'heroes', 'can', 'not', 'defeat', 'only', 'outlast', 'T2', 'fight', 'future', 'quality', 'yet', 'original', 'film', 'keep', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'pessimism', 'Even', 'Bear', 'McCreary', 'musical', 'themes', 'utilize', 'emotions', 'built', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'struggle.But', 'dense', 'atmospherics', 'signal', 'series', ""n't"", 'just', 'recycle', 'films', 'classic', 'originals', 'occur', 'substantially', 'night', 'gloomy', 'noir', 'ambiance', 'series', 'contrasts', 'night', 'day', 'good', 'evil', 'Even', 'characters', 'Derek', 'Reese', 'moral', 'boundaries', 'series', 'morality', 'exist', 'have', 'obligation', 'fight', 'beliefs', 'ethics.The', 'introduction', 'religious', 'themes', 'never', 'used', 'movies', 'series', 'depth', 'not', 'previously', 'plumbed', 'Sometimes', 'silly', 'when', 'Agent', 'Ellison', 'Doctor', 'Silverman', 'debate', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'prophet', 'also', 'characters', 'concrete', 'purpose', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'keep', 'fighting', 'must', 'prevent', 'hypothetical', 'catastrophe', 'know', 'fight', 'right.But', 'alternate', 'fatally', 'absurd', 'T3', 'powerful', 'switch', 'franchise', 'mythology', 'Terminators', 'still', 'drop', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'life', 'fate', 'inevitable', 'really', 'fate', 'other', 'what', 'make', 'Sarah', 'Moving', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'T2', 'date', 'new', 'timeline', 'adjustment', 'prior', 'narrative', 'yet', 'destiny', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'postponed', 'not', 'overthrown', 'Pretty', 'distinct', 'modern', 'mythology', 'morality', 'God', 'only', 'part-time', 'Humankind', 'fights', 'right', 'have', 'only', 'vague', 'parameters', 'define', 'rightness', 'situational', 'basis', 'Thus', 'different', 'moralities', 'Derek', 'Reese', 'versus', 'Charlie', 'Dixon', 'Agent', 'Ellison', 'versus', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'assume', 'equal', 'weight', 'when', 'come', 'conflict', 'must', 'subjectively', 'identify', 'right', 'applies', 'situation.Thus', 'utilizing', 'prior', 'Terminator', 'narrative', 'series', 'entirely', 'new', 'experience', 'Instead', 'letting', 'social', 'mythology', 'poke', 'excitement', 'adrenaline', 'show', 'cerebral', 'character-driven', 'story', 'way', 'moments', 'stirring', 'excitement', 'watch', 'differently', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'inconsistent', 'best', 'rewards', 'will', 'outlast', 'show', 'unfortunately', 'brief', 'network', 'run']","Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 1"

Relative unknowns have been cast in main roles. I'd say the girl playing Sarah Connor is OK, the girl playing Cameron (the terminator) is good... and that's the worse end of the stick. Guys take the cake on this one. Young J.Connor, Agent Alison, and Derek Reese, Cromartie are played amazingly.I like the music in the show, too.

1088867,A2YWEG35UMPBJ3,B000T9OP7G,"L. Harris ""skytag""","[0, 1]","I didn't see this when it was airing, and I resisted buying it for fear it would be a disappointment, but I finally broke down and I'm glad I did. It's good entertainment. Note: A few spoilers follow.The pros:- Good acting and casting. Summer Glau is the star of the show in my opinion. A real gem in this season is the episode in which she gets to show off her dancing skills. She's quite good.- The story line is generally good, though I have to wonder if it would have been possible to do an extended series with such a limited basis for stories. After all, the only two main plots seem to be a) not dying at the hands of a terminator, and b) sabotaging anything that could eventually evolve to become Skynet. It's a recipe for lots of running, looking over their shoulders, killing people, and blowing stuff up. The question is, how long could such a formula carry a show, and unfortunately the answer seems to be, about a season and a half.- The video is very good overall. There are a few soft scenes that disappoint, but more scenes that show off why we love Blu-ray so much.- Audio is excellent, better than the audio in the Blu-ray version ofTerminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition)in my opinion. I have a nice audio system, so good audio (with solid bass that isn't overdone in the case of material like this) is a real plus for me, and this has that.- The scene where Derek takes John to the park for his birthday is a real gem in my opinion.The cons:- The writing is weak at times. In one episode Sarah and Derek go to city hall at night to plant a virus in the traffic control system. Is anyone stupid enough to buy the idea that the LA traffic control system runs unattended all night (the whole department is deserted)? When that doesn't work, John and Derek access the system at a traffic light and sabotage it. Traffic everywhere (this is Los Angeles, after all), but John is sitting on the sidewalk with his computer connected to a traffic light box for several minutes. No passersby, no one comes up and asks what he's doing. The show obviously requires some suspension of belief, but there should be rules. If any aspect of reality can be discarded at will to deal with a problem then where's the challenge? Where's the suspense?- John's character seems unrealistic to me. He knows the threat, he knows the dangers, he knows what he does in the future, he's lived with rebel guerrillas learning to fight, he's barely escaped being killed multiple times. And what personality has this created? A whiny teenager who complains as if the worst thing in his life is not being able to hang out at the mall. His brooding and self-pity get old after a while. Sorry, but his persona just doesn't seem consistent with someone who has his knowledge and life experience. Maybe he'd gain a little perspective if he readAnne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.- Only nine episodes. Granted, the price is right, especially if you pick it up used or on sale, but you can watch the whole ""season"" in an evening. Just about the time it really gets interesting it's over. I'll be getting the second season and thankfully it's longer.That said, thank goodness for DVD. Before we could buy TV shows on DVD a show needed three full seasons to have enough episodes to go into syndication (reruns). Less than that and you never saw it again. That's why the write-in campaign to keep Star Trek TOS on the air for a third season was so critical to its longevity. Without it, there would have been only two seasons, no reruns, and the show would have disappeared.

A desire or greed to know all about the little details and the stuff between narration. But this isn't the first time I am left disappointed and weary of the truth (think Matrix sequels or the Star Wars prequels). There was a reason why some exposition was left untold and why some backstory was left to the imagination. Most of the time its better to be left alone.Even still, what happens in the Sarah Connor Chronicles might have been worth knowing, had the glaringly obvious been obvious: had it been written by the same people and directed by James Cameron who created the original films. As it stands, the chronicles are the BS story of impostors and fraudsters who have no right to tell us `what happens'.The terminator saga was a science fiction too big for a puny FOX TV show. And what we get is a derivative prime hour of generic script writing in the same vein as shows like `prison break' or `heroes'. Not that there isn't a place for these shows but ultimately the original terminator story is stripped of its flesh and bones. What was an explosive cinematic experience is left to soak and fade. With unforgivable flaws like...A completely non-threatening pin up girl posing as the terminator. Irrespective of her appropriateness in firefly, and even irrespective of the idea that this could actually be feasible. This was a blatant attempt to appease the pimple popping generation that ever since Buffy have forgotten what being a Geek is all about: The science fiction.A hot mom who is more bang-able than believable. Someone like James Cameron had enough foresight to cast Sigourney Weaver in Aliens or Linda Hamilton as the original Sarah Connor. Linda may not have had feminine model features but she had a rugged bruising presence. And when I saw her doing her pull ups or screaming in the mental house: I could believe it. In contrast her `desperate housewife' counterpart continuously reminds you that this is a TV series in every sense.The tension, the action and the progression of the story is watered down and uneventful.The terrifying power of the cyborgs are glossed over. Indestructible in one scene, then weak at the knees in another. In contrast to the massive presence of T1000 or the leather strapped Arnie.Maybe I wouldn't be so harsh if this was another `Alias' or `Jericho' which has its place in the entertainment medium.

I was disappointed that it, like many shows, had to cut down on episodes due to the writer's strike.  However, upon a second viewing on Blu-Ray, the show seemed to get even better.  Thomas Dekker takes over the reigns as John Connor, and Lena Headey replaces Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.  Both do well.  Summer Glau is a real treat as Cameron Phillips.  Upon first viewing, I thought that the writers had really screwed up writing Cameron, regressing her ability to act human quite a bit after the pilot episode.

1088886,A3NQI2JLNPFOF8,B000T9OP7G,"nico_laos ""nico""","[2, 2]","As this series neared its premier, I was absolutely positively certain that the show would be unspeakably bad.  And perhaps this is why it was canceled after its second season.  I feel that so many people (especially Terminator fans) had already made up their mind before hand and never really gave the show a chance.  I gave it a chance and watched the premier; then promptly abandoned the entire show.  As it turns out, the premier episode was the weakest of the season.  In fact, at episode three, the show suddenly goes from just 'decent' to 'awesome'.  And it was these stories about how the plot develops that I was constantly hearing from those that stuck with the show that convinced me that I needed to give it a second chance; and I'm so glad I did.First of all, this isn't entirely a reboot.  It follows the continuity of the first two movies quite nicely, but exists outside the story line developed by T3 and Terminator Salvation.  It's an 'alternate version of events', so to speak.{John Conner}  The character was done perfectly.  Gone is the 'most annoying kid in the world' attitude.  Here it's obvious that he's grown up watching his back at every turn.  He's sick of running; and with the arrival of a Terminator protector, he feels it's time to start fighting back.  His technical skills are also more impressive and a little more believable than previous interpretations.{Sarah Conner}  She is, after all, the star of the show and often narrates each episode.  She's motherly but never forgets her mission to protect her son and stop Skynet before it's built.  Her days of paranoia and erratic behavior are over.  What's great about her portrayal here is she rarely ever seems to be afraid.  She's calm, cool, collected, and just plain awesome.{Cameron}  John's Terminator protector and was initially the hardest part of the show for me to like.  I groaned during her scenes in the premier.  However, as the show developed, her character quickly grew on me.  Her scene as she looks on in fascination at the robot at the chess tournament, in particular, was remarkably directed.{Terminators}  The rest of them are also well done.  We really get the feeling that just one of these guys is nearly unstoppable.  The initial Terminator from the pilot, Cromartie, appears to have been 'terminated' at the end of the premier.  However, the majority of this season he is seen as constantly rebuilding himself in order to complete his mission, suggesting that no matter what kind of damage a Terminator sustains, it will...never...stop.  Another example of this is when John attempts to hack an extracted Terminator CPU in which John see glimpses of the world through it's visual memory bank giving a fascinating yet disturbing look into their behavior.  At one point the CPU comes back online attempts to complete his mission despite not having a body.Trust me, I was one of the hardest people to convince that this would ever be good.  But it is.  It's incredible.  Give it a chance to develop and grow on you and there's a good chance you'll gain as much appreciation for it as I have.~nico~",5,I was wrong.,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,3106,"['series', 'neared', 'premier', 'was', 'absolutely', 'positively', 'certain', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'unspeakably', 'bad', 'perhaps', 'why', 'was', 'canceled', 'second', 'season', 'feel', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'especially', 'Terminator', 'fans', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'hand', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'show', 'chance', 'gave', 'chance', 'watched', 'premier', 'then', 'promptly', 'abandoned', 'entire', 'show', 'out', 'premier', 'episode', 'was', 'weakest', 'season', 'fact', 'episode', 'three', 'show', 'suddenly', 'just', ""'decent"", ""'awesome"", 'was', 'stories', 'how', 'plot', 'was', 'constantly', 'hearing', 'stuck', 'show', 'convinced', 'needed', 'give', 'second', 'chance', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did.First', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'reboot', 'continuity', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'quite', 'nicely', 'story', 'line', 'developed', 'T3', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', ""'alternate"", 'version', 'events', 'speak', 'John', 'Conner', 'character', 'was', 'done', 'perfectly', 'Gone', ""'most"", 'annoying', 'kid', 'world', 'attitude', 'Here', 'obvious', 'grown', 'up', 'watching', 'back', 'turn', 'sick', 'running', 'arrival', 'Terminator', 'protector', 'time', 'start', 'fighting', 'back', 'technical', 'skills', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'impressive', 'little', 'more', 'believable', 'previous', 'interpretations', 'Sarah', 'Conner', 'star', 'show', 'often', 'episode', 'motherly', 'never', 'mission', 'protect', 'son', 'stop', 'Skynet', 'built', 'days', 'paranoia', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'are', 'What', 'great', 'portrayal', 'here', 'rarely', 'ever', 'be', 'afraid', 'calm', 'cool', 'collected', 'just', 'plain', 'awesome', 'Cameron', 'John', 'Terminator', 'protector', 'was', 'initially', 'hardest', 'part', 'show', 'like', 'groaned', 'scenes', 'premier', 'However', 'show', 'developed', 'character', 'quickly', 'grew', 'scene', 'fascination', 'robot', 'chess', 'tournament', 'particular', 'was', 'remarkably', 'directed', 'Terminators', 'rest', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'get', 'feeling', 'just', 'one', 'guys', 'nearly', 'unstoppable', 'initial', 'Terminator', 'pilot', 'Cromartie', 'have', 'been', ""'terminated"", 'end', 'premier', 'However', 'majority', 'season', 'seen', 'constantly', 'rebuilding', 'order', 'complete', 'mission', 'suggesting', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'damage', 'Terminator', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'example', 'when', 'John', 'hack', 'extracted', 'Terminator', 'CPU', 'John', 'see', 'glimpses', 'world', 'visual', 'memory', 'bank', 'giving', 'fascinating', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'look', 'behavior', 'one', 'point', 'CPU', 'back', 'online', 'attempts', 'complete', 'mission', 'not', 'having', 'body.Trust', 'was', 'one', 'hardest', 'people', 'convince', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'good', 'incredible', 'Give', 'chance', 'develop', 'grow', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'gain', 'much', 'appreciation', 'have.~nico~']","Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 1"

I missed the first two episodes though and that's the main reason why I just have to have this on DVD. I'm also a huge fan of the original movies, especially ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", which is one of my favourite movies ever.I love the way the 'protective' Terminator this time round is a teenage girl and Summer Glau deserves an award for the way she carries off the emotionless, steely-eyed glare of the cyborg Cameron, (so named in honour of James Cameron, the director of the two first movies, I read somewhere), trying to pick up more human traits the more she spends time with them. Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker as Sarah and John Connor respectively are okay and all but it was really Cameron I tuned in to see every week. I get a huge kick out of seeing strong women on screen and Cameron kicks a**!Basically, the story is still the same. Cyborgs are still being sent back in time; one to kill John Connor and another to protect him and on the one hand, it's pure cheese and pure escapism but it's also a whole lotta fun. I suppose it's possible one could watch the series and enjoy it without having watched all three of the Terminator movies (there are references all over the place) but I doubt it. I can't wait to see this again on DVD and I'm already gagging for season two!So why only four stars? Well, with only nine episodes (two of which I missed), I was left a bit wanting.

1088889,AHF97M45JFCB,B000T9OP7G,ONENEO,"[2, 2]","I did something with Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (TSCC) that I rarely do: I purchased the complete show on DVD without so much as watching a single episode during its run on broadcast television or reading even one review.  The reason for such a brash move? Well I've always enjoyed the franchise in its feature film form and figured that the weekly format would be a spectacular medium in which to fill in the gaps between the films.As such TSCC does just that.  In fact the series could be viewed as Terminator 2.5 if the motion-picture timeline is one's gauge of measurement.  If you'll recall, Terminator 2: Judgment Day ended with Sarah Connor, her young son John (with the help of the 800 ""Swartz"" Series Terminator) manage to destroy both the liquid-metal T-1000, as well as the arm and chip from the first film's 800 Series Terminator.  The film was set in the year 1995 with a then ten-year-old John Connor.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines jumped ahead to 2004 where a nineteen-year-old John Connor is living ""off the grid"" in the areas surrounding Los Angeles after the death of his mother.  It turns out that Judgment Day did not occur in 1997 as had been predicted in the first film due to mankind's intervention to the timeline, which postponed the prophesied events.  As is the robots of the future's way, another Terminator has been sent back in time (this time the female T-X unit) in effort to pick off Connor's future lieutenants in the human Resistance.TSCC begins in 1999 with a fourteen-year-old John Connor still living with his mother on constant run from both destiny and evil cyborgs. Following the movie-formula, the duo finds themselves pursued by a T-888 Terminator unit but aided by Cameron, a female (800 Series) Terminator that has been re-programmed and sent back through time to protect John.But before you go and get used to life circa 1999, the crew make a desperate escape by time traveling to the year 2007 and in the process jump right over the time where cancer should have claimed the life of Sarah Connor.  The Terminator in pursuit in 1999 uses the eight years of their absence to reconstruct his damaged chassis and is quite alive and well by the time 2007 rolls around.It gets worse still for our protagonists once they discover that that Skynet has in fact sent many Terminators back to the year 2007 for a whole variety of missions ranging from the execution of key resistance members to the physical construction of the network and facilities that will eventually become Skynet.The bottom line is, and like the movies, our heroes have their hands full in what boils down to present day in effort to change future-history.  The good news is, as an hour-long episode format, it works.  The shows build with absolutely beautiful pacing, intense action sequences, and solid scientific explanations without tech overload.I wasn't sure what to expect going in; after all, many of the films demanded an R rating to tell their tale not to mention boasted budgets that put even the ritziest television budgets to shame.  I can state with confidence that producer Josh Friedman recognized these limitations and went about crafting the source material into a television effort with style and grace.The acting is well above what's typically associated with made-for-television action drama efforts and the effects, while slightly pale compared to the efforts of the last two feature films, are easily on par with (and at times surpass) the visuals of the first two.More impressive than the acting and visuals however would have to be the story/ plot structure itself which manages to take many of the elements that have made the films so enduring, and interweaves them with a slightly more dramatic feel than that of the movies (which were typically mass-destruction chases).My only complaint lies not with the show in particular but rather some of the typical snafus and paradoxes that the series (and time travel in general) call to mind.  Questions of predestination and multiple (parallel) existences can detract from an already difficult-to-follow timeline if the viewer allows themselves the distraction of pondering such things.  As has been the case with all of the Terminator incarnations thus far, it is best perhaps to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy the ride.The show was one of those that suffered due to the writer's strike and hence consists of only 9-episodes for the first season.  Coming in at a total runtime of 394 minutes, the show spans 3-discs and contains a healthy dose of extras including staff commentaries over three episodes, audition clips, gag reels, and several deleted ""Terminated"" scenes. The second season was boosted to 22-episodes before ultimately meeting its untimely demise from television.  A shame really, as the show managed to surpass most of my expectations.  I'm working on the second season now and will review that one upon completion as well.",4,"Exceeded Expectations, Terminated All Doubts",1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,4943,"['did', 'something',

I originally only watched the first half of the pilot and a little of the later season one episodes before I panned this show as ""Robo210"".  Cough...cough.  I was horribly unfair.  This thing's got depth, nuance, smarts, and a big helping of heart & soul.  I watched every episode of Season 2 as it was airing, and must say I'm floored.In about 30 hours, Fox Television Network will officially announce whether Terminator - The Sarah Connor Chronicles gets picked up for a third season.  After having purchased the first season and being utterly consumed by it now, all I can say is Fox executives will need their heads examined if they cancel this.I've got one friend working on Dollhouse.  I have another who worked on the first few episodes of Glee.  I'd gladly trade a hundred Dollhouses, Glees, and Prison Breaks for at least one more season of Terminator.  There's certainly precedent for Fox doing stupid things, though.  Hell, they canceled Family Guy early on, even though you had to be lobotomized to not realize it was genius.I'd thought Fox had learned the error of their ways.  After all, they did finally bring Family Guy back, then rewarded the writers with a spin off at least as good: American Dad.  It's not as if this is Twin Peaks, you know, with the murder solved and the plot getting meandering.  I think ABC's cancelation of that show actually caused the last few episodes to finally go somewhere.Terminator has huge oodles of potential left.  I get the sense the writers have more to say.  The characters are just heading up their arcs.  The show feels like something great right in its infancy.  It's a shame they moved it to Friday night in an effort to prop up Dollhouse's ratings, but it's done.

1088906,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000T9OP7G,Robert Moore,"[15, 21]","The first season of TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES was a good one.  Though fans are now brooding over whether the series will be picked up for a second season -- this is, after all, FOX, killer of shows -- the ratings overall were good, especially in the 18-49 demographic.  While I would be the first to acknowledge that you should never underestimate FOX's ability to kill a good show, even FOX will hesitate to cancel a show doing this well in the most desired demographic.  If the series is cancelled, it would definitely rank as the most dim-witted cancellation in FOX's history.  At least some of the other very good shows that it cancelled were struggling with ratings.  My guess is that they will bring it back in the fall and pair it with 24 on Monday nights.A lot of fans of the original two TERMINATOR films (we can all pretty much ignore the third TERMINATOR film, which even the makers of the forthcoming Christian Bale-as-John Connor film is not going to treat as canonical) were bugged to no end with minor or (in their minds) major chronology issues.  My response is:  who cares?  First, we are talking about two very good SF films, but they are not the cinematic equivalent of WAR AND PEACE.  Second, fans of the TERMINATOR films need to learn the same sensibility that fans of comic superheroes have learned:  change is good.  I mean, what is canonical in Batman?  What cannot be allowed in Iron Man?  There have been so many variants in comics that if it weren't allowed, there would be no comics.  Besides, in the history of story telling there have been an almost uncountable versions of various stories throughout history.  If TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES plays around with thee films' chronology, this is the biggest ""no big deal"" of all time.  The question is whether the adjustments lead to some great storytelling.  I believe it does.Casting is incredibly important in a series like this.  Although by the end of the season more characters are introduced than one might have initially imagined, this is mainly a three-person show.  Lena Headley, who is best known to mainstream American TV viewers from the film 300 (though she has been in a very large number of other films and TV series), does a great job in the title role, with one exception.  She looks the role, acts the role, comes across as tough in the role.  I completely buy her.  But I really hope in Season Two that they decide to dispense with the opening narrations.  Though she is a good actress, she doesn't sell the narration.  Kristen Bell on VERONICA MARS and now on GOSSIP GIRL makes it seem so effortless, as does Jim Dale on PUSHING DAISIES.  But it is an easy to underestimate skill.  No doubt the writing hinders Headley in her narration.  It comes across as too self-conscious, too aware of itself, too unnatural.Thomas Dexter, who most know from a controversial character from early Season One HEROES (his character was initially Claire the cheerleader's gay best friend -- but when Christian groups started complaining about a gay character, they suddenly un-gayyed him -- I wonder if people who are so obsessed about saving America from gays and the dangers gays represent to marriage [though I've never quite grasped the connection between keeping two dudes getting married and how that is going to make heterosexual marriages healthier] spent more time working on their own marriages if the Bible Belt, which currently has the highest divorce rate in America, would have more successful marriages, heterosexual or otherwise), does a very creditable job as John Connor, the sixteen-year-old version.  The challenge of playing John is that it has to be made creditable that this kid would sometime become the kind of leader who could lead a resistance.  My major complaint with T2 is that this wasn't done.  I think Dekker by the end of the season started doing that.  Early in the season he seemed more rebellious, headstrong teenager.  But by the end of the season he had started maturing.The producers of the show say that they created the role of Cameron with Summer Glau in mind.  To show how crucial she was in their conception of what they wanted to do, she was offered the role outright, instead of auditioning people for it.  And it is obvious that they knew why they wanted her:  they'd obviously seen FIREFLY and SERENITY and saw how she played the on-the-edge insane River Tam, who is simultaneously a genius, a psychic, a highly honed killing machine, and a crazy person.  There is some legitimate complaint about her performance in the Pilot, but it is the fault of the writing and directing and not Glau.  In the Pilot when we first see her, she is a super friendly, socially smooth, chipper, giggly high school girl in the first episode.  But the rest of the season she seems to have the same social skills that Arnold did in his turn as your friendly neighborhood terminator.  Once they got past the pilot, however, Cameron became one of the best things in the show.  Most robots on TV are clearly persons, even if they are not human.  Data, for instance, was clearly, for all his lack of emotion, a person.  Sharon on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA clearly is, as is Caprica Six.  Even the Doctor on STAR TREK: VOYAGER is clearly a person.  There is a famous thought experiment known as The Turing Test, from a thought experiment proposed the famous Cambridge mathematician and super genius John Turing.  He imagined a test in which a human being and a computer were separated from a questioner by a wall.  A series of questions would then ensue.  If the questioner couldn't, by the answers that were given, tell which respondent was the computer, then, Turing reasoned, that computer could be considered a person.  Cameron is the first important TV cyborg, robot, or android since Robot on LOST IN SPACE who probably couldn't pass the Turing test.Let me expand a bit on this.  Although Cameron can attend school, hang out with people, and basically pass for human, she constantly exposes the gap between her and humans.  This is incredibly unusual for television.  As a result, this could end up being one of the most important cyborg characters in the history of TV, at the very least the one that could inspire some interesting reflection.  She is the first cyborg character on TV who truly seems to be completely devoid of compassion.  Early in the season, when a girl she has ""befriended"" is about to jump off a roof in a public act of suicide, Cameron refuses John's entreaties that they do something to help her.  Later in the season she promises a ballet instructor, from whom she seems genuinely interested in learning some ballet (it helps that Summer Glau is a real life prima ballerina -- her first acting job was on an episode of ANGEL as a ballerina and she and ANGEL creator Joss Whedon are reportedly working together on a ballet film), that she will save both her and her brother from the people seeking to kill them if they will give her information that she is seeking.  They give her the information, but instead of helping them, she coldly (not cruelly -- Cameron does not seem capable of cruelty, just as she is incapable of compassion) exits the building.  When asked later why she didn't help them, she replies that it wasn't part of the mission.  When John asks her if she lies, she admits that she does, even to him.  And the season is filled with some wonderful Cameron moments, such as when she one minute complains about their looking for the remains of a dead girl, because she a dead human is merely ""meat and bones,"" and a few minutes later is found sitting beside John, talking with him, as she applies pink polish to her nails.  Her character is filled with incongruities.  Oh yeah, she is blown up at the end of Season Two, but no one really believes that she won't be back, do they?I liked the patience of the show in Season One.  They very gradually brought along three supporting characters.  Dean Winters in the Pilot played Sarah's fianc&eacute; Charly and I fully expected the guy I think of as The Beeper King (from his role as Liz Lemon's boyfriend on 30 ROCK) to immediately disappear from the show.  Instead he has reappeared in several episodes.  My guess is either that he will be killed off or he will end up as part of Sarah and John's little army of supporters.  I'm guessing the same will be true of Richard T. Jones's Agent Ellison, who started off as someone after Sarah because he considered her a mere murdered, but as the season has gone alone has come to believe that she was not lying when she claimed to be chased by robots from the future.  The finale saw Ellison and a substantial group of FBI agents attack and get mauled by the terminator after John.  I would lay money on Charly in the first episode of Season 2 taking Ellison to meet Sarah and having him become another member of her cadre.  The third character to emerge was Brian Austin Green as Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle Reese from the first TERMINATOR movie and therefore the uncle of John.  I didn't much care for his character by the end of Season One, but that is mainly because he was so gruffly written.  I also got tired of his endless suggestions that something needed to be done about Cameron, that she was a killing machine that couldn't be trusted, bladdy blah blah.  I hope they either kill him off or deepen his character in Season Two.  I suspect they will take the latter route.My last comment is that this show managed to do what any good show need to:  it got better as it went along.  I enjoyed the first episode, but with each successive episode I liked the show more and more.  I am very much looking forward to Season Two.  And completely confidant that there will be one.  Not even FOX would be so stupid as to cancel it.",5,One of the better new shows of 2008,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,9801,"['first', 'season', 'TERMINATOR', 'SARAH', 'CONNOR', 'CHRONICLES', 'was',

In this episode it is exactly that they are faced with when Sarah learns of a young man that in the past interned with Miles Dyson and has now gone on to build a super computer capable of beating other super computers in chess.Nearing a competition that will have this computer, known as the Turk, Sarah must decide whether or not to allow the Turk's creator to live.The writers take time out from the usual run-for-your-life storyline and attempt to add some humor into the show. Of course the main focus for a lot of the laughs is Cameron, who Sarah has called the Tin Man. Cameron's stiffness and ignorance to the human condition can at times make her a target for ridicule and jokes, but Cameron isn't just a construct of metal and wires, she is also very smart and capable of turning jokes around on those who tell them. Her dry wit is also funny in itself as she uses it to poke fun at those who aren't expecting it.A great third episode that continues to advance the storyline.

Then comes 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles' and that question was answered.  Though with the recent movie being Terminator 3, the thought of the writing or anything like how that movie was done was in the back of my mind hoping that the show wouldn't be like how that movie turned out.  Surprisingly after nine episodes of the first season I was like this has to be one of the best shows out there and more interesting than most shows especially when it comes to any live action show out there these days.The 'Pilot' episode was well done and it was like 'WOW!  This show definitely has promise and FOX would have to be idiots to screw it up.'.  Each episode it tells about how Sarah and John are trying to find a way to keep Skynet from being built however they can go about doing so.  In the process they find out the machines are back and making their fight that much more important as an attempt to stop Judgment Day from happening.  The premise is similar to that of the second film where there's one 'Terminator' sent back to kill John and one to protect him, but that's not all.  When being taken to the year 2007 they soon find out there's a 'Terminator' with a specific mission to carry out to help Skynet be ready for when the war starts.  It's interesting to see that they make nods to the first two movies like 'Cameron' for example named after 'James Cameron' along with other things.Sure that this season is only nine episodes long not as long as other shows like this, but long enough to get a story going to set itself up for a second season, which that was longer.  All in all only nine episodes I want to say that they were good, almost perfect possibly, but that's only me.  One of the things is that the episode 'Demon Hand' does have a extended cut of the episode with this release.

You can't make a TV show out of this, not a good one any way. Boy, was I wrong!!!I watched the first show to see how horrible it was going to be. By the second show, I was COMPLETELY hooked.The actors are fantastic! They draw you into their lives and you care about what happens to them.Lena Headey (I hope I spelled that right) from the movie 300 and others breathes new life in the character of Sarah Connor. She let's you see different emotional levels of Sarah, From a loving mother that truly cares for her son John, that she's still a tender person inside although it now comes hard for her while still being the kick ass protector of her son and therefore the future. She is AWSOME!I never thought much of Brian Austin Green. That opinion has now CHANGED!!! Please watch it to see what I mean. He Doesn't disappoint! Quite the opposite! He is AWSOME!Summer Glau...Is, well, Summer Glau! Beautiful, sexy and tough as HELL! She makes you feel for the terminator she plays. Not just because that beautiful face of hers can engender tons of sympathy. There is great skill in the way she portrays Cameron. Not overdone. Just enough here and there to make her character literally come alive and make you care about her. A wonderful actress. She is AWSOME!Thomas Dekker...Where the hell did he come from? It's like they needed an incredibly skilled actor to play John Connor, so they just grew one in a test tube, and there he was. By acting verbally or with only facial expressions, he brings out the inner turmoil that John Connor is suffering. I watch him and I feel a catch inside. How can this poor young man live like this? I know I couldn't. It really gets to me. He gets to me. Thomas engenders such a feeling of love and care for his character, that it's griping. He is AWSOME!Can you tell that I think this show is AWSOME :o)This is the first season...You have to watch it! The second season just started and is into it's third show. I encourage everyone who likes good drama, good action and good sci-fi to record the second season, while you get the first season, watch it (it's doesn't have many episodes) and then get into the second season.

1088935,A3NQSMTG612AF,B000T9OP7G,TheTruthHurts,"[1, 6]","To put it in plain English (to eliminate any vocabulary-based confusion), this TV show sucks, and I hope that its second season is short-lived and that it never sees the light of day again (as its fanboys continue to drop off, it's inevitable; I'd wage everything I own on season two being less than thirteen episodes...).Allow me to explain; while I generally believe that anything with ""Terminator"" in the title that doesn't involve James Cameron should be banned and subsequently expunged from society, I was perfectly willing to give this show a fair chance, since, after all, it's TV, and quality is generally expected to be below average in relation to any film counterpart that preceded it [T3 excluded...it's far worse than this show (read my review if you care]). The first episode, however, made me cringe for more reasons than I care to remember.Take, for example, the performance by Lena Headley (Headey...? eh, who cares). Basically, I thought it was as completely devoid of any real emotion as could be humanly possible. There was no rage, no anger, no fear, and far too much smiling and go-lucky attitude; basically, everything that Linda Hamilton portrayed so well in the films (again, I don't consider T3 part of the ""series"") managed to disappear in her ""performance."" Don't tell me it's a ""revisioning"" of the character; it's bad acting and a failure to connect with the character that James created. Don't tell me it's a ""revisioning"" of the series, and that it's ok for her character to be happy-go-lucky, because it's nonsense, and you know it.Next on the list is the incredibly drab characterization of the next hero Terminator (naturally, a teenage girl...what else should we have expected from a TV show aimed at Joe Sixpack), performed by some girl from Serenity (I think...never seen it, but almost certainly equally awful and fanboy-supported while it was on). Does she look good? Decent. Does she portray an interesting envisioning of the T-800? I think not.Next, we have the kid that was on Heroes in Season One (now there's a good sci-fi show, if you need a comparison). Well, he's ok in this show too, but not quite the prepubescent vision of John Connor that we might expect. At least he's a competent actor...?Finally (at least regarding characters and the ""actors"" that portray them), we have (and this was, by far, the most nausea-inducing experience I suffered through before I gave up completely on this drivel) none other than Mr. 90210 himself...Mr. Donna Martin...Brian Austin Green. ""Oh...my...God."" If I had a nickel for every person who muttered those words at exactly the same moment that I did, well, ...I'd use it to find and purchase a decent Terminator script, or to buy off whoever has the power to pull this show from our airwaves now instead of a few months down the road. Of all people...Brian Austin Green? This was unquestionably the precise moment when this show went from being simply poorly written and acted to absolutely riotous...and fanboys, I know you're with me on at least this point (don't even try denying it).Moving on from the ""characters,"" let's discuss the ""plot."" Ok, that's it.In summation, what ""Terminator - The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" brings to the table is little more than a failed attempt to rehash a dead series (it died with Cameron), or as others have said, ""...rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic."" Much like T3, and almost certainly the upcoming trilogy (again, with no input from Cameron...but at least Bale is involved), this dog deserved a quick death, and it's somehow found its way to a second season (as others have mentioned, most likely only as a buzz leader for the upcoming films). Here's to hoping that someone puts it out of its misery in some kind of timely fashion (again, I'm guessing within thirteen episodes).Edit: 9/15/08 Ouch! Maybe it won't even last thirteen, with the season two opener garnering only 6.3 million viewers (just over 2% of the population  check Nielsen Wire if you don't believe it)!Edit: 9/17/08 Down to 5.5 million this week...as I predicted, the fanboys are dropping off like flies! Unless it rebounds, and quickly, its fate is sealed. Good riddance.Edit: 9/30/08 Unfortunately, as the show has dropped out of the top ten (Monday Prime-time), its ratings are no longer displayed on Nielsen Wire. Does anyone know of a ratings source for shows that are about to be cancelled? ;)Edit: 11/12/08 Well, I stand corrected; they've decided to go ahead and finish the complete season, against the forecast of virtually anyone who'd been following the ratings of the show. I can see, however, as the fanboys have stopped replying to my review, that they honestly believed that the game was over as well. It is, in fact, but not yet; we'll (true Terminator fans) have to endure yet another few months of this mediocrity before it's banished from our airwaves (and memory). Let's only hope that ""Terminator: Salvation"" is relatively close to the standard set by the first picture...Edit: 4/14/09 It's official, kiddies: kiss this show goodnight...Edit: 5/18/09 Ok, so it's *official* as of yesterday; I'd like to leave with one parting comment...""Terminator: Salvation,"" based on reviews received thus far, isn't going to salvage much from the wreck that the

1088937,AA78TCLHXPJOK,B000T9OP7G,Timothy G. Berntsen,"[4, 5]","This show is excellent. Many of us, I'm sure, were hesitant to see an Arnold-less Terminator TV show, with a new actress filling the shoes of the iconic Sarah Connor, after being immortalized by Linda Hamilton. Well, as both a long time Terminator fan, and someone who is very picky about which TV shows they watch, I can safely say that this show delivers the goods in ways I couldn't have imagined.The cast for this show is excellent. The producers wisely opted not to simply cast Sarah Connor based on how well the actress resembled Hamilton, but by how well she portrayed the character. Lena Headey is friggin' close to perfect for the role, and that was something that I was not expecting at all when I first found out they were making the show. Thomas Dekker as John Connor bears a stronger resemblance to his Terminator 2 counterpart, but more importantly he fills the role very well. Given that the Connors are the only Terminator 2 veterans who appear regularly in the series, it was fundamental to the show's success that they cast them properly, and thankfully they did.The real show stealer though, is Summer Glau as the new character ""Cameron."" She's John's new cyborg protector from the future, and it's no surprise that she is rapidly becoming a fan favorite. The role of Cameron is much more complicated than simply an emotionless robot, because she's more than a regular Terminator, as the series slowly reveals. She's a machine that is slowly becoming more human-like, and Summer Glau is the perfect actress to convey both aspects of Cameron's personality. She's definitely one of my favorite aspects of the show, and I can't wait to see how she develops in future episodes.The writing in the show is well done too. There are a few continuity errors in some episodes that you may or may not pick up on depending on how closely you pay attention, but those aren't really what's important. What is important is that the story actually makes you care about the characters, and eager to find out what happens next. Sometimes I would literally throw things at my TV when a commercial break started just because I was so hooked. They did an excellent job selling that these are the same John and Sarah Connor from Terminator 2, but the writers now have the opportunity to expand their characters a lot further than was possible in a 2.5 hour long movie.If you are a Terminator fan, you owe it to youself to buy this set. The visual quality for the Blue-Ray is amazing, and it even comes with a slightly extended cut of the pilot, and a greatly extended cut of one of the later episodes that sheds even more light on Sarah Connor's character.

Luckily, I was completely wrong on all counts. ""Chronicles"" manages to be engaging, expand on the first three films and be terrifically entertaining. Show developer Josh Friedman (""War of the Worlds"") establishes its own identity for the show.The image quality for the transfer of the DVD looks good but could look better. I'd like to see what the Blu-ray has to offer. Audio sounds quite good with a nice dramatic score and a nice surround mix.Following Sarah Connor(Lena Heady), her son John (Thomas Dekker) and Cameron (Summer Glau) a cyborg sent from the future to protect them the series focuses on their attempts to prevent Skynet from being built. They're also being pursued by a variety of Terminators sent into the past to eliminate them.The set comes with deleted scenes and a number of commentary tracks featuring Friedman, actors Thomas Dekker, Brian Austin Green, Lena Heady Summer Glau and others. The commentary tracks aren't very revealing with the actors, writers and producers focusing more on the dramatic content than the behind-the-scenes production information.We also get a gag reel, deleted scenes, a three part documentary on the production of the show that DOES provide us with plenty of behind-the-scenes info about the series. One of the best extras is an extended episode of ""The Demon Hand"" (Both a reference to the hand of one of the Terminators AND Harlan Ellison's ""The Outer Limits"" episode ""Demon with A Glass Hand"" which was one of the inspirations for James Cameron's ""The Terminator"". The character of Ellison played by Richard T. Jones is also a tip of the hat to Ellison)which has deleted scenes that gives us information on the childhood of Sarah Connor's character.""Chronicles"" is a well made, well thought out drama and it will be interesting to see how the series develops over the next 22 episodes of season two.

I watched with great interest being that I am a Terminator fan, and I have to say that it's a departure that I'm in favor of. I like the fact that they didn't go for the copy of Arnold or try like hell to be as good as the movie. I think this one takes a departure that is worth waiting for. You want to know how Summer Glau's character is different from other Terminator Models.Some of the plot they borrowed from one of the Terminator Books that I read, but that's ok. I liked that book. I guess that I would say that I hope they allow the show to unfold enough to find its audience.

I didn't know what to expect, cause we all know The Terminator franchise is a lot to live up to. But this show simply delivers in all categories. It has action thanks to Sarah Conner and Cameron(the terminator). Drama between John and everyone who wants to protect him. Suspense cause you never know when they will be attacked next. As well as mystery cause to be honest, you think you know what's going on. But you really don't.Also since it's a series you have way more character development, than you would have in the movies. So even thou the show is called Sarah Conner Chronicles. It's really about John Conner and how he develops into the man that will eventually lead us to victory over the machines.",4,You'll just love getting your weekly dose of Terminator,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,768,"['Surprisingly', 'series', 'actually', 'good', 'heck', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'cause', 'know', 'Terminator', 'franchise', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'show', 'simply', 'delivers', 'categories', 'action', 'thanks', 'Sarah', 'Conner', 'Cameron', 'terminator', 'Drama', 'John', 'everyone', 'who', 'protect', 'Suspense', 'cause', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'attacked', 'next', 'As', 'well', 'mystery', 'cause', 'be', 'honest', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'really', ""don't.Also"", 'series', 'have', 'way', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'movies', 'So', 'even', 'thou', 'show', 'called', 'Sarah', 'Conner', 'Chronicles', 'really', 'John', 'Conner', 'how', 'man', 'will', 'eventually', 'lead', 'victory', 'machines']","Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Season 1"
