I googled her just to see if anyone else thought she sucked (they did), and though there was barely any info online about her, what there WAS was shocking. She's actually acted in other films!! How?! The male main character is no Robert Deniro himself but he gives an Oscar worthy performance in comparison to his female counterpart's. I really think she should be forced legally to give anyone who paid to watch this their money back, plus twenty bucks. She plays a struggling actress who can't get cast in anything, which I wish were only true. The girl playing the psychic is totally overdramatic and just as awful so no saving grace there. Decent storyline though- why I needed to see them walk around a ghost town for twenty minutes, pretending to be stuck in a jail, I don't know, however. The director is awful in all ways visible, including his acting.

1497390,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005QBSRUI,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The film centers on a young couple in California. He writes ""real"" ghost stories from interviews, but needs to do a rewrite. She is a waitress who ""can't buy a job"" as an actress and during their first conversation, you will know why. He put in a bid on a secluded ranch which he got, and the next moment they are ready to occupy, driving off in the Bimmer with an air mattress.They take turns filming stuff along the way and thank goodness the producers had enough insight to also use the old fashion motion picture camera mounted on a tripod. Their journey was a waste of our time as it failed to build any character. You can fast forward through this aspect, get popcorn etc. It is sufficient to know they are both shallow airheads. You can fast forward until they get to the ranch. Really, you won't miss anything at all.The film moves fast when it should be slow and slow when it should be fast. If you read the Amazon review or the title, you know cold creepy feeling things happen in the house that require an exorcism. After the first night, they opt to call their psychic exorcist friend who can be there the next day. Instead of wasting all that film shooting California yucca plants, Kurlander should have build up the cold creepy feeling slowly. The time the couple spends on the Internet...way too long. Get yourself a real film editor. We know your Idiot-Savant group did the sound track from the credits, was the additional plug necessary? Was that a trance or sleep walking Chloe was doing in her panties and boots? Did she sleep with those boots on? Looked a bit odd. Was that sunlight coming through the window in the night time bar scene or was the outdoor lighting nova bright?I have dated women who have acted more possessed than Lisa Younger (sorry Terry, I told.) I was most shocked by the fact these people had other acting credits to their name. The scary part of the movie didn't last long and there was no explanation as to what happened, just bad hints. Keith Kurlander used himself and his own family as the ghost family, perhaps the most scary convincing thing on screen for all of 10 seconds. Keith Kurlander wrote, directed, acted in, produced, edited, etc. etc. this film. If you see Keith, he now owes me $2.F-Bomb, sex, nudity (thank you Lisa Younger)",1,MORE IDIOT THAN SAVANT,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,2286,"['film', 'centers', 'young', 'couple', 'California', 'real', 'ghost', 'stories', 'interviews', 'needs', 'do', 'rewrite', 'waitress', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'job', 'actress', 'first', 'conversation', 'will', 'know', 'why', 'put', 'bid', 'secluded', 'ranch', 'got', 'next', 'moment', 'are', 'ready', 'occupy', 'driving', 'off', 'Bimmer', 'air', 'mattress.They', 'take', 'turns', 'filming', 'stuff', 'way', 'thank', 'goodness', 'producers', 'had', 'enough', 'insight', 'also', 'use', 'old', 'fashion', 'motion', 'picture', 'camera', 'mounted', 'tripod', 'journey', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'failed', 'build', 'character', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'aspect', 'get', 'popcorn', 'etc', 'sufficient', 'know', 'are', 'shallow', 'airheads', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'get', 'ranch', 'Really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'all.The', 'film', 'moves', 'fast', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'slow', 'slow', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'fast', 'read', 'Amazon', 'review', 'title', 'know', 'cold', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'things', 'happen', 'house', 'require', 'exorcism', 'first', 'night', 'opt', 'call', 'psychic', 'exorcist', 'friend', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'there', 'next', 'day', 'Instead', 'wasting', 'film', 'shooting', 'California', 'yucca', 'plants', 'Kurlander', 'should', 'have', 'build', 'up', 'cold', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'slowly', 'time', 'couple', 'Internet', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Get', 'real', 'film', 'editor', 'know', 'Idiot-Savant', 'group', 'did', 'sound', 'track', 'credits', 'was', 'additional', 'plug', 'necessary', 'Was', 'trance', 'sleep', 'walking', 'Chloe', 'was', 'doing', 'panties', 'boots', 'Did', 'sleep', 'boots', 'Looked', 'bit', 'odd', 'Was', 'sunlight', 'coming', 'window', 'night', 'time', 'bar', 'scene', 'was', 'outdoor', 'lighting', 'nova', 'bright', 'have', 'dated', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'acted', 'more', 'possessed', 'Lisa', 'Younger', 'sorry', 'Terry', 'told', 'was', 'most', 'shocked', 'fact', 'people', 'had', 'other', 'acting', 'credits', 'name', 'scary', 'part', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'was', 'explanation', 'what', 'happened', 'just', 'bad', 'hints', 'Keith', 'Kurlander', 'used', 'own', 'family', 'ghost', 'family', 'perhaps', 'most', 'scary', 'convincing', 'thing', 'screen', '10', 'seconds', 'Keith', 'Kurlander', 'wrote', 'directed', 'acted', 'produced', 'edited', 'etc', 'etc', 'film', 'see', 'Keith', 'now', '2.F-Bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Lisa', 'Younger']",Cold Creepy Feeling: Paranormal Exorcism
