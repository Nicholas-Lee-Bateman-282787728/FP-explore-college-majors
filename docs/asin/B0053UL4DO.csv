I really didn't need both, although I enjoyed going to those places again. I couldn't get enough of the scenery on these.I'll confess that when I bought the first VirtualActive DVD, I wasn't sure I would enjoy this Johnny Pearman guy who was our guide. It turns out that he is excellent with motivation, encouragement, praise, but keeps his comments few and far between. He pretty much stays out of the way of the view. The locations are spectacular choices. I couldn't be happier with them. They make my workout a pleasure. Each time I finish one, I set another one up for the next day so I can look forward to it. I've done a lot of travel and the great thing about these DVDs is, they take you places you might not get to go and you see more of it than most tourists see when they are there. Not bad with a fun workout thrown in as well. I may be out of new ones to try. I hope they make more soon. La Jolla, California would be nice. What about some of the Greek Islands? You make them and I will buy them.",5,"Gorgeous Locations, Motivating Music, and a Great Guide!",1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1134,"['have', 'number', 'VirtualActive', 'DVDs', ""'m"", 'little', 'embarrassed', 'got', 'Northern', 'Italy', 'Run', 'Northern', 'Italy', 'Hike', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'enjoyed', 'going', 'places', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'scenery', 'these.I', ""'ll"", 'confess', 'when', 'bought', 'first', 'VirtualActive', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'enjoy', 'Johnny', 'Pearman', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'guide', 'out', 'excellent', 'motivation', 'encouragement', 'praise', 'comments', 'few', 'far', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'view', 'locations', 'are', 'spectacular', 'choices', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'make', 'workout', 'pleasure', 'time', 'finish', 'one', 'set', 'one', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'can', 'look', 'forward', ""'ve"", 'done', 'lot', 'travel', 'great', 'thing', 'DVDs', 'take', 'places', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'go', 'see', 'more', 'most', 'tourists', 'see', 'when', 'are', 'there', 'Not', 'bad', 'fun', 'workout', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'new', 'ones', 'try', 'hope', 'make', 'more', 'soon', 'La', 'Jolla', 'California', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'What', 'Greek', 'Islands', 'make', 'will', 'buy']",N/A

The music is good--it has a good beat.  The scenery is interesting.  However, I like to run for an hour and this video is only 30 minutes long and then they go into a cool down.

However, the guy will tell you to go a little slower here and a little faster here, but the beat of the music is the same. It would seem that it is an inately human trait to move to the beat. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if you want me to get to the &#34;cool down&#34; part, then slow down the beat.",3,"Beautiful scenery, but...",1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,373,"['mentioned', 'title', 'scenery', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'However', 'guy', 'will', 'tell', 'go', 'little', 'slower', 'here', 'little', 'faster', 'here', 'beat', 'music', 'same', 'would', 'seem', 'inately', 'human', 'trait', 'move', 'beat', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'just', 'want', 'get', '34', 'cool', 'down', '34', 'part', 'then', 'slow', 'down', 'beat']",N/A
1440712,AON5AKAK7X63Q,B0053UL4DO,vote4serenity2,"[0, 0]","I have a number of Virtual Active dvds and this is amongst my favorites!  Good music, encouraging guide, and nice scenery (Venice, countryside, or coastal.)  I tend to chose the guided run, where Johnny provides supportive comments such as to stay hydrated, relax and breathe, or to take shorter strides during a climb. This run is quite challenging, beginning with a very steep climb right away (and then again about three-fourths into the workout.)  I appreciate little reminders telling me to relax my arms or to take long, slow breaths. While this was filmed predominantly in Venice, you do see other surrounding locals and some water, too!  I found it fun to be riding in a boat down the canal at one point in the cooldown or to be running along a beach.  And, during the steep climbs you're on a coastal cliff path or running with a beautiful mountain backdrop in the country.  One reviewer commented that she made the mistake of buying both hike/run Italy dvds and I am so glad to have each. The hike covers different locations than you will see here, like some tunnels and other coastal areas!  I love all of my VA dvds!",5,Awesome locations and a great run!,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,1128,"['have', 'number', 'Virtual', 'Active', 'dvds', 'amongst', 'favorites', 'Good', 'music', 'encouraging', 'guide', 'nice', 'scenery', 'Venice', 'countryside', 'coastal', 'tend', 'chose', 'guided', 'run', 'where', 'Johnny', 'supportive', 'comments', 'such', 'stay', 'hydrated', 'relax', 'breathe', 'take', 'shorter', 'strides', 'climb', 'run', 'quite', 'challenging', 'beginning', 'very', 'steep', 'climb', 'right', 'away', 'then', 'again', 'three-fourths', 'workout', 'appreciate', 'little', 'reminders', 'telling', 'relax', 'arms', 'take', 'long', 'slow', 'breaths', 'was', 'filmed', 'predominantly', 'Venice', 'do', 'see', 'other', 'surrounding', 'locals', 'water', 'too', 'found', 'be', 'riding', 'boat', 'down', 'canal', 'one', 'point', 'cooldown', 'be', 'running', 'along', 'beach', 'steep', 'climbs', ""'re"", 'coastal', 'cliff', 'path', 'running', 'beautiful', 'mountain', 'backdrop', 'country', 'One', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'made', 'mistake', 'buying', 'hike/run', 'Italy', 'dvds', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'have', 'hike', 'covers', 'different', 'locations', 'will', 'see', 'here', 'tunnels', 'other', 'coastal', 'areas', 'love', 'VA', 'dvds']",N/A
