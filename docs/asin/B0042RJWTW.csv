1383618,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0042RJWTW,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Perry Mason Season 5 Volume 2These fifteen TV shows from 1962 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ""ropers"", rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Mason's tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on today's broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The titles begin with ""The Case of The"". A story adapted from a novel has the year.Shapely Shadow (1960) 1-6-1962; Captain's Coins  1-13-1962;Tarnished Trademark  1-20-1962; Glamorous Ghost (1955) 2-3-1962.Poison Pen Pal  2-10-1962; Mystified Miner  2-24-1962;Crippled Cougar  3-3-1962; Absent Artist  3-17-1962.Melancholy Marksman  3-24-1962; Angry Astronaut  4-7-1962;Borrowed Baby  4-14-1962; Counterfeit Crank  4-28-1962.Ancient Romeo  5-5-1962; Promoter's Pillbox  5-19-1962;Lonely Eloper  5-26-1962.",5,The Original Courtroom Drama,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,2309,"['Perry', 'Mason', 'Season', '5', 'Volume', '2These', 'fifteen', 'TV', 'shows', '1962', 'are', 'based', 'novels', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'books', 'are', 'more', 'complete', 'informative', 'tell', 'life', 'not', 'experienced', 'most', 'people', 'books', 'explain', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'films', 'only', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'books', 'tell', 'ropers', 'rough', 'smooth', 'shadows', 'how', 'evade', 'surveillance', 'avoid', 'leaving', 'back', 'trail', 'questioned', 'legality', 'ethics', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'tactics', 'stories', 'were', 'written', 'modern', 'legal', 'rules', 'background', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'America', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'today', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'hero', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'was', 'founder', 'Court', 'Last', 'Resort', 'sought', 'free', 'unjustly', 'convicted', 'Gardner', 'sought', 'use', 'scientific', 'means', 'find', 'guilty', 'rather', 'using', 'hunches', 'alone.The', 'seeming', 'reality', 'stories', 'due', 'part', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'original', 'stories', 'were', 'modified', 'TV', 'theme', 'music', 'typical', 'late', '1950s', 'Note', 'style', 'clothing', 'culture', 'ladies', 'wore', 'white', 'gloves', 'People', 'seldom', 'lock', 'doors', 'prices', 'date', 'films', 'One', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'many', 'automobiles', 'era', 'How', 'many', 'can', 'identify', 'Note', 'slimness', 'people', 'smoking', 'familiarity', 'pistols', 'Watch', 'how', 'actors', 'express', 'emotions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'camera', 'sharpness', 'quality', 'excellent', 'films', 'have', 'higher', 'contrast', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'stories', 'often', 'use', 'misinterpretation', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'provide', 'dramatic', 'effects', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'usually', 'Preliminary', 'Hearings', 'often', 'tell', 'law', 'titles', 'begin', 'Case', 'A', 'story', 'adapted', 'novel', 'year.Shapely', 'Shadow', '1960', '1-6-1962', 'Captain', 'Coins', '1-13-1962', 'Tarnished', 'Trademark', '1-20-1962', 'Glamorous', 'Ghost', '1955', '2-3-1962.Poison', 'Pen', 'Pal', '2-10-1962', 'Mystified', 'Miner', '2-24-1962', 'Crippled', 'Cougar', '3-3-1962', 'Absent', 'Artist', '3-17-1962.Melancholy', 'Marksman', '3-24-1962', 'Angry', 'Astronaut', '4-7-1962', 'Borrowed', 'Baby', '4-14-1962', 'Counterfeit', 'Crank', '4-28-1962.Ancient', 'Romeo', '5-5-1962', 'Promoter', 'Pillbox', '5-19-1962', 'Lonely', 'Eloper', '5-26-1962']",N/A

It's the only show that I have literally watched from the time I was able to actually watch TV and know what was happening.  ""Perry Mason"" was early television, made during a period in history (an all too short period) when the focus was on quality and not as much on moneymaking.  If ever there was a TV actor who earned his paychecks, it was Raymond Burr - and actually that goes equally for William Hopper, William Talman, Barbara Hale, and Ray Collins.  Those guys really knew how to bring it.  Although the shows followed a formula, and most of them have the same flavor, they never fail to keep our attention.  The best episodes are like short movies, and the average ones are still as good today as any of the best courtroom/legal shows (although most of the ones after ""Matlock"" just suck.)  I am also a huge fan of ""Twilight Zone"" and for almost every episode of Perry Mason, an actor who also worked on ""Twilight Zone"" could be found.  I'm not sure if the same casting directors worked on both shows but if so, it wouldn't surprise me.  ""Twilight Zone"" rarely miscast a role and they only hired the best actors around - and for the most part, ""Perry Mason"" did as well.  My favorite regular Perry actors include Robert H. Harris (short, balding guy often cast as a slimy crook), Vaughn Taylor (who was in the pilot episode), S. John Launer (frequent judge), Ben Cooper, Ruta Lee (both Ben and Ruta did about six episodes where they played actually very weird people), Bill Erwin (played a variety of roles including coroner as well as crook), and a young and gorgeous Karl Held (about 10 episodes as Perry's assistant David Gideon, but they discontinued the character unfortunately.)  Karl and his future wife actress Sarah Marshall did an episode together.As for this DVD set - I'd say that it doesn't get much better than this.  Sadly, DVD came around too late, so the possibility of doing commentaries or interviews with the actors/writers/producers was impossible because almost all of them are gone now and the few who are alive probably don't remember much, although everyone I've ever talked with who worked on that show had nothing but good things to say about Burr and Hale, thatthey were very nice and very professional at all times.  Perhaps on future season releases there will be some special features?  Let's hope.  The picture quality and menus are excellent.  The DVDs for Season 1 had one major problem - there was no 'play all' feature and the menu had the theme song loopingconstantly.  But they fixed those things in Season 2.  They changed the packaging - wisely - with the Season 3 releases and hopefully they'll keepit the same from here on out (with all discs in one case.)I was so stoked when Perry was released, finally, on DVD - and thankfully it ran for 9 years so the episodes are almost endless.",5,It Rocks My World - And Has for 31 years!,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,2911,"[""'m"", '35', 'years', 'old', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'was', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'only', 'show', 'have', 'literally', 'watched', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'actually', 'watch', 'TV', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'was', 'early', 'television', 'made', 'period', 'history', 'too', 'short', 'period', 'when', 'focus', 'was', 'quality', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'moneymaking', 'ever', 'was', 'TV', 'actor', 'who', 'earned', 'paychecks', 'was', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'actually', 'equally', 'William', 'Hopper', 'William', 'Talman', 'Barbara', 'Hale', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'guys', 'really', 'knew', 'how', 'bring', 'shows', 'followed', 'formula', 'most', 'have', 'same', 'flavor', 'never', 'fail', 'keep', 'attention', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'short', 'movies', 'average', 'ones', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'today', 'best', 'courtroom/legal', 'shows', 'most', 'ones', 'Matlock', 'just', 'suck', 'am', 'also', 'huge', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'almost', 'episode', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'actor', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'could', 'be', 'found', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'same', 'casting', 'directors', 'worked', 'shows', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'rarely', 'miscast', 'role', 'only', 'hired', 'best', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'favorite', 'regular', 'Perry', 'actors', 'include', 'Robert', 'H.', 'Harris', 'short', 'balding', 'guy', 'often', 'cast', 'slimy', 'crook', 'Vaughn', 'Taylor', 'who', 'was', 'pilot', 'episode', 'S.', 'John', 'Launer', 'frequent', 'judge', 'Ben', 'Cooper', 'Ruta', 'Lee', 'Ben', 'Ruta', 'did', 'six', 'episodes', 'where', 'played', 'actually', 'very', 'weird', 'people', 'Bill', 'Erwin', 'played', 'variety', 'roles', 'including', 'coroner', 'as', 'well', 'crook', 'young', 'gorgeous', 'Karl', 'Held', '10', 'episodes', 'Perry', 'assistant', 'David', 'Gideon', 'discontinued', 'character', 'unfortunately', 'Karl', 'future', 'wife', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'did', 'episode', 'together.As', 'DVD', 'set', ""'d"", 'say', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Sadly', 'DVD', 'came', 'around', 'too', 'late', 'possibility', 'doing', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'actors/writers/producers', 'was', 'impossible', 'almost', 'are', 'gone', 'now', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'alive', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'talked', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'had', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'Burr', 'Hale', 'thatthey', 'were', 'very', 'nice', 'very', 'professional', 'times', 'Perhaps', 'future', 'season', 'releases', 'will', 'be', 'special', 'features', 'Let', 'hope', 'picture', 'quality', 'menus', 'are', 'excellent', 'DVDs', 'Season', '1', 'had', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'was', ""'play"", 'feature', 'menu', 'had', 'theme', 'song', 'loopingconstantly', 'fixed', 'things', 'Season', '2', 'changed', 'packaging', 'wisely', 'Season', '3', 'releases', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'keepit', 'same', 'here', 'out', 'discs', 'one', 'case', 'was', 'so', 'stoked', 'when', 'Perry', 'was', 'released', 'finally', 'DVD', 'thankfully', 'ran', '9', 'years', 'so', 'episodes', 'are', 'almost', 'endless']",N/A

For those who put down all black and white television, the quality of these videos shows you the nuances that are not quite captured with the distraction of color.
