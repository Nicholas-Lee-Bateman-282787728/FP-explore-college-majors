Too many films of the Second World War have the feel of modern times that just happen to be set in the past; and don't affect one viscerally to any significant extent.  1940s Britain, particularly when that island stood alone, is a hard mood to capture, but this film succeeds herein.  Contrary to some other reviewers here, this film isn't propagandistic (in the manner that that term is usually viewed).  It simply presents the gravity of the era (1939-1941) in which it was shot (1942) in almost real time; when Britain was hanging on precariously as the Royal Navy kept it afloat, so to speak.  Showing bravery, British mettle, and presenting British resistance against Hitler's Nazism is patriotic sure, but not propagandistic as well.  Sometimes issues are Black & White, contrary to those who desire to see shades of gray in everything as a matter of self-perceived personal intellectual superiority.  To show Britain fighting valiantly is not akin to Goebbels championing German braveness.  The night of long knives, the state-sanctioned racism, the holocaust, the brutality of the Germans in occupied lands do not have equivalents on the British side. Certainly not in relation to the Second War War.  ""In which we Serve"" is simply a fine film which captures an era & for anyone who wants to understand that era (viscerally even) one would be well served by giving it some of your time.

This movie goes into a great deal of detail about the life of the destroyer, her majesty's ship Torrin, and the crew on her. There is some action during fights with airplanes and ships, but most of the movie is centered on reflecting back on times aboard ship and on shore with families after the ship is sunk. These memories occur while they are trying to survive in a lifeboat while being strafed by German bombers. You genuinely feel you know what it was like for British Naval families when the movie is over. The level of detail is incredible. You will feel like you are right there with them. This seems a little bit like a documentary story but it does have live action throughout. You will see numerous familiar faces if you are a fan of classic British cinema.

Made while the issue was still in doubt you had to understand that by producing and starring in this film Noel Coward, author, playwrite and actor, felt he could contribute to the British War effort. A bit stodgy and firmly steeped in the pretension of the English caste system this film attempts to show the lives of men who fight on small ships in a wide and hostile sea.  Coward gives a wonderfully understated performance that epitomizes ""stiff upper lip"". Combine this with a wonderful supporting cast and even handed direction and you've a near classic. While I like this film I do not love it. It's clearly propaganda and I don't knock it for that, I much prefer a more realistic view of the conflict as found in ""The Cruel Sea"".  Jack Hawkins' portrayal of what naval combat does to a man is diametrically opposed to Coward's and to me, much more believeable.

Its drama and characterizations make it so.  Here are reasons to watch it still:--The focus on ""the ship"" from the time its keel was laid until it sinks beneath the waves after a bombing attack provides a thoughtful framework for the film.  Here, ""the ship"" is both the machine and the crew.--Among film portrayals of naval leadership (by, say, Jack Hawkins in ""The Cruel Sea,"" or Russell Crowe in ""Master and Commander,"" or Charles Laughton, Trevor Howard, and Anthony Hopkins in the films on the Bounty mutiny) Noel Coward as ""Captain D"" presents another role model -- outwardly stiff, undemonstrative, and tightly self-disciplined, but caring for the crew on a ""happy and efficient"" ship.  Noel Coward modeled his performance after Lord Louis Mountbatten at the time that HMS Kelly was sunk off Crete in 1941.--The scenes of Royal Navy gun crews, wardrooms and messes, signalmen, and crew coordination make up for the film's lack of special effects and modern action sequences.

788895,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B0000YEE4E,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Based mostly on the experiences of Lord Mountbatten on HMS Kelly, IN WHICH WE SERVE is a classic British flag-waver from 1943, attesting to the bravery and sheer grit of captain and crew as they struggle to survive after their ship has been sunk by a German torpedo.  Structured as a series of flashbacks, the narrative focuses on different members of the crew from different socio-economic backgrounds: the bourgeois Captain Kinross (Noel Coward) leading a comfortable family life with his wife (Celia Johnson), and two children (Daniel Massey, Ann Stephens); the middle-class Chief Petty Officer Hardy (Bernard Miles), living with his wife (Joyce Carey) and her mother; and the working-class Ordinary Seaman Blake (John Mills) living in a modest terraced house with his family.  While the film is redolent of the class-consciousness characteristic of that period (there is little no possibility of anyone wanting to improve themselves), it depicts a changing world in which everyone pulls together, both on the battle-front and at home.  The loyalty and dedication of Kinross' crew is quite admirable, even under adverse circumstances: when one member (Richard Attenborough) steps out of line and neglects his duty, he is sternly admonished and never does it again.  On the Home Front the crew members' wives and families stoically endure the pain of separation, while realizing that such experiences have to be endured during wartime.  Even when Hardy loses his wife and mother (both victims of the Blitz), he vows to carry on at his post regardless.  As Kinross, Noel Coward is a model of rectitude, as he tries to do the best for his crew; yet from the clever use of close-up, we understand the depth of emotion lurking underneath that British reserve, especially at the end when he says goodbye to his crew-members.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is noticeably unsentimental in its approach: co-directors Coward and David Lean are not frightened to represent the seamier sides of life in World War II, while paying tribute to the bravery of everyone, whether on active service or remaining at home.

Noel Coward hero worshipped Mountbatten who was present for some of the filming.  By that stage of the (real) war it was well known that aircraft would sink anything still in sight in daylight.  Mountbatten stayed off Crete in daylight when he expressly knew he should not and paid the inevitable price.  In reality Mountbatten was NOT sent back to sea or given another sea command.Historically the film is interesting for the close ups of real WWII desroyer weapons systems in action and some impressive action shots.It is also interesting in the context of propaganda/morale raising of the period.

788905,A20QYY9BECJKMA,B0000YEE4E,Jennifer,"[1, 1]","In Which We Serve is a 1942 British patriotic war film directed by Nol Coward. Beautifully restored by DigicomTV. The audio and visual quality are excellent!The screenplay by Coward was inspired by the exploits of Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was in command of the destroyer HMS Kelly when it was sunk during the Battle of Crete.The film opens with the narration: &#34;This is the story of a ship&#34; and the images of shipbuilding in a British dockyard. The action then moves forward in time showing the ship, HMS Torrin, engaging German transports in a night-time engagement during the Battle of Crete in 1941. However when dawn breaks, the destroyer comes under aerial attack from German bombers.Eventually the little ship receives a critical hit following a low-level pass. The crew's company abandon ship as it rapidly capsizes. Some of the officers manage to find a Carley float as the survivors are intermittently strafed by passing German planes. From here, the story is told in flashback using the memories of the men on the float. The first person to reveal his thoughts is Captain Kinross (Coward), who thinks back to the summer of 1939 when the Royal Naval destroyer HMS Torrin is being rushed into commission as the possibility of war becomes a near certainty.The ship's company spends a relatively quiet Christmas in the north of Scotland during the Phoney War. But by 1940, the Torrin is taking part in a naval battle off the coast of Norway. However during the action, a young terrified sailor (Attenborough) leaves his station, while another (Mills) returns to work his gun after its crew is knocked unconscious by a torpedo strike on the ship. With the Torrin damaged it is towed back to port, all the time being targeted by dive-bombers.Safely back in harbor, Captain Kinross tells the assembled ship's company that during the battle nearly all the crew performed as he would expect; however one man didn't. But he tells everyone present they may be surprised to know that he let him off with a caution as he feels as Captain he failed to make the young man understand his duty.The film then returns to the present as the survivors watch the capsized Torrin slowly take on water. It becomes clear that the badly damaged ship will sink. Once again, the raft is strafed by German planes. Some men are killed, and &#34;Shorty&#34; Blake (Mills) is wounded.The Torrin participates in the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force, (portrayed in the film by the 5th Battalion of the Coldstream Guards). Meanwhile the nightly Blitz is taking its toll on British towns.The flashback ends as the survivors on the life raft watch the capsized Torrin finally sink. Captain Kinross leads a final &#34;three cheers&#34; for the Torrin when suddenly another passing German plane rakes the raft with machine gun fire, killing and wounding more men. Soon after, a British destroyer appears and begins to rescue the men. On board, Captain Kinross talks to the survivors and collects addresses from the dying. He tells the young man who once left his post that he will write and tell the boy's parents that they can be proud that he did his duty; the critically injured young man smiles and dies peacefully.From here, the stories run concurrently until the end of the film.

Noel Coward's energies, always remarkable, were redoubled during the second World War, and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism, which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is still worth watching, but it's nowhere as appealing as either CAVALCADE or THIS HAPPY BREED, and its focus on the ""life and death of a ship"" (the HMS Torrin) is strangely monomaniacal, almost constructivist.  Over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away, symbols of brute strength like something from a Soviet film.  The ship goes up.  The ship goes down.  A new ship rises out of the water.  And in between Coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat, till our interest settles on three--Bernard Miles as Hardy, with his striking, long, hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it--he should have played Ichabod Crane--John Mills as Blake, a tiny little pipsqueak who's feisty in the standard Mickey Rooney-Jimmy Cagney manner, and Noel Coward himself as Captain Kinross, tranquil with class privilege and, in the background, his glamorous marriage to the ineffable Celia Johnson (so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums).Hitchcok's LIFEBOAT had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical, but without Coward's complicated flashback structure.  Coward stalwarts Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh show up as the love interests for Miles and Mills respectively--Carey, in this movie and in BRIEF ENCOUNTER as well, treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth, nor good-looking in any way, who's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest.  She must have kissed the ground every time Noel Coward walked on it.  Who else would have written such roles for her?The movie is trying indeed when it goes ""serious,"" and yet that's half the fun of it, seeing how often Coward plays the ""race"" card--""we are an island race"" indeed.  I teared up, of course I did, during the Blitz as the V-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on London households, leading to the death of several favorite characters, and again when Coward leads his naval boys into Dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude British soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of Kool-Aid.  Outside of these scenes, however, the movie is marred by its agitprop and by David Lean's tiresomeness, in showing everything at such a glacial pace.PS, the film was shot by Ronald Neame who later became a director himself and whose ""masterpiece,"" THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of IN WHICH WE SERVE.",4,Island Race,1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,2898,"['How', 'did', 'have', 'time', 'write', 'picture', 'co-direct', 'act', 'everything', 'else', 'write', 'score', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'energies', 'always', 'remarkable', 'were', 'redoubled', 'second', 'World', 'War', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'excuse', 'show', 'off', 'patriotism', 'wore', 'second', 'skin', 'slummy', 'upbringing', 'IN', 'WHICH', 'WE', 'SERVE', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'nowhere', 'as', 'appealing', 'CAVALCADE', 'THIS', 'HAPPY', 'BREED', 'focus', 'life', 'death', 'ship', 'HMS', 'Torrin', 'strangely', 'monomaniacal', 'almost', 'constructivist', 'see', 'unattributed', 'bare', 'arms', 'hammmering', 'away', 'symbols', 'brute', 'strength', 'something', 'Soviet', 'film', 'ship', 'up', 'ship', 'down', 'new', 'ship', 'water', 'Coward', 'hardest', 'keep', 'interested', 'lives', 'men', 'clinging', 'lifeboat', 'till', 'interest', 'settles', 'three', 'Bernard', 'Miles', 'Hardy', 'striking', 'long', 'hatchet', 'face', 'deep', 'voice', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'John', 'Mills', 'Blake', 'tiny', 'little', 'pipsqueak', 'who', 'feisty', 'standard', 'Mickey', 'Rooney-Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'manner', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'Captain', 'Kinross', 'tranquil', 'class', 'privilege', 'background', 'glamorous', 'marriage', 'ineffable', 'Celia', 'Johnson', 'so', 'beautiful', 'till', 'mouth', 'bits', 'teeth', 'wobble', 'gums', '.Hitchcok', 'LIFEBOAT', 'had', 'same', 'concentration', 'handful', 'downed', 'wet', 'actors', 'playing', 'nautical', 'Coward', 'complicated', 'flashback', 'structure', 'Coward', 'Joyce', 'Carey', 'Kay', 'Walsh', 'show', 'up', 'love', 'interests', 'Miles', 'Mills', 'respectively', 'Carey', 'movie', 'BRIEF', 'ENCOUNTER', 'as', 'well', 'treated', 'very', 'unusually', '1940s', 'woman', 'not', 'first', 'youth', 'good-looking', 'way', 'who', 'given', 'nevertheless', 'fullblooded', 'physical', 'romantic', 'interest', 'must', 'have', 'kissed', 'ground', 'time', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'walked', 'Who', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'such', 'roles', 'movie', 'trying', 'indeed', 'when', 'serious', 'yet', 'fun', 'seeing', 'how', 'often', 'Coward', 'race', 'card', 'are', 'island', 'race', 'indeed', 'teared', 'up', 'course', 'did', 'Blitz', 'V-1', 'rockets', 'drop', 'bomb', 'bomb', 'London', 'households', 'leading', 'death', 'several', 'favorite', 'characters', 'again', 'when', 'Coward', 'naval', 'boys', 'Dunkirk', 'again', 'panoply', 'half-nude', 'British', 'soldiers', 'sipping', 'tea', 'what', 'enormous', 'vat', 'Kool-Aid', 'scenes', 'however', 'movie', 'marred', 'agitprop', 'David', 'Lean', 'tiresomeness', 'showing', 'everything', 'glacial', 'pace.PS', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Ronald', 'Neame', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'director', 'masterpiece', 'THE', 'POSEIDON', 'ADVENTURE', 'sometimes', 'shot', 'shot', 'remake', 'disaster', 'sequences', 'IN', 'WHICH', 'WE', 'SERVE']",N/A

When the picture gets bleary for one more recalled memory, you may struggle to suppress a laugh or a groan--but, darn it, the movie works.  The ship emerges from the Scottish ship yard, goes to sea as war breaks out, and suffers casualties at sea, and, shockingly, ashore.  It takes a pretty hard heart not to shed a tear when Noel Coward says goodbye to his crew.

According to most accounts, Noel Coward was determined to make his own contribution to the war effort. His objective was to improve morale by celebrating that which he believed the English people have traditionally cherished most: ""king and country,"" family, teamwork, human dignity, and courage. He wrote the screenplay, composed the musical score, and starred in a film whose leading character, Captain Kinross (played by Coward), was inspired by Lord Louis Mountbatten. The film's structure was significantly influenced by Citizen Kane, a film which Coward greatly admired. What a cast! In addition to Coward, others include John Mills, Celia Johnson, Richard Attenborough, Bernard Miles, Michael Wilding, and James Donald. Although identified as co-director, Coward entrusted most of the work to David Lean with whom he had carefully studied Welles' film before going into production. Here's the basic situation: Captain Kinross and a few survivors cling to life in a dinghy after their destroyer, H.M.S. Torrin, has been sunk by Luftwaffe dive-bombers. As the shipmates bob in the water, they reminisce about loved ones at home with whom they shared so many happy moments. And then....In addition to assembling an outstanding cast, Coward also enlisted the superb talents of Ronald Neame (cinematographer) and Thelma Myers (editor). Those who have at least some familiarity with Coward's talents as a writer and performer should not be surprised that In Which We Serve has such a well-written screenplay and is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. However, if they have not as yet seen this film, they may be surprised to learn that Coward displays none of the mannered sophistication which is so evident, for example, during his appearances on television, in other films, and in musical reviews on Broadway and (especially) in casinos at Las Vegas. Captain Kinross is the archetypical English naval officer, portrayed by Coward without glitz or glamor. His upper lip remains appropriately stiff until the final, unforgettable scene but there is no doubt whatsoever about his inherent decency. His love and respect for those under his command are obvious, as are theirs' for him. Recognizing the risk of misleading anyone who reads these brief remarks, I hasten to add that In Which We Serve also offers an abundance of riveting action as H.M.S. Torrin and her crew engage the enemy.

Because all 3 were made at the start of the war (early 40's) when England stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt Hitler and aggresive facism. Invasion fears were rife, the war effort looked hopeless at times as in Europe, Hitler opposing country after country fell to the German aggressors (not to mention the rampage going on in Africa at the hands of Rommel  aided by the Italian forces under Mussolini's instruction).  England's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed, starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day.

In which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly, inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of British life.For a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made (1942), and I guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely Coward's plan.An absolute gem and a must see, I weep every time I watch it.",5,There a 3 films made in WW2 in England...,1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,1484,"['simply', 'HAVE', 'see', 'Mrs', 'Miniver', 'being', 'one', 'little', 'known', 'film', 'dealing', 'fictitious', 'German', 'invasion', 'sweet', 'English', 'Village', 'Went', 'day', 'well', 'film.Why', 'so', '3', 'were', 'made', 'start', 'war', 'early', '40', 'when', 'England', 'stood', 'very', 'much', 'alone', 'fight', 'agaisnt', 'Hitler', 'aggresive', 'facism', 'Invasion', 'fears', 'were', 'rife', 'war', 'effort', 'looked', 'hopeless', 'times', 'Europe', 'Hitler', 'opposing', 'country', 'country', 'fell', 'German', 'aggressors', 'not', 'mention', 'rampage', 'going', 'Africa', 'hands', 'Rommel', 'aided', 'Italian', 'forces', 'Mussolini', 'instruction', 'England', 'small', 'island', 'identity', 'stood', 'alone', 'threat', 'was', 'bombed', 'starved', 'demoralised', 'feeling', 'invasion', 'could', 'happen', 'day', 'was', 'quite', 'possibly', 'darkest', 'times', 'English', 'History', 'three', 'films', 'capture', 'flavour', 'dispondancy', 'equally', 'might', 'will', 'survive', 'protect', 'realistic', 'perfection', 'serve', 'more', 'personally', 'know', 'based', 'truth', 'characters', 'become', 'dear', 'well', 'rounded', 'quite', 'quickly', 'inspiring', 'care', 'folk', 'many', 'walks', 'British', 'life.For', 'modern', 'audience', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'stoic', 'sentimental', 'times', 'place', 'emotion', 'context', 'year', 'was', 'made', '1942', 'guarantee', 'will', 'view', 'aching', 'sense', 'fear', 'hope', 'was', 'precisely', 'Coward', 'plan.An', 'absolute', 'gem', 'must', 'see', 'weep', 'time', 'watch']",N/A

This was a movie with only rudimentary special effects.  The actors have to ACT!  I found it very enjoyable.

It is on a DVD-R, and the sound and video quality leave very much to be desired. 4 Stars for the film, 2 stars for the audio & video quality. As this is a 'public domain' film, any distributor can duplicate it without troubling themselves with royalties. Unfortunately, that means that all the copies are probably not remastered in any way. I checked The Criterion Catalog, but it was only released on Laser Disc. Although, it is available on DVD in a Criterion Box Set, 'David Lean Directs Noel Coward.'
