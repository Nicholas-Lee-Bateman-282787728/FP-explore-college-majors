Also the real father who was the subject on the book by Baglio served as a consultant for this production, so instead of the whole hoopla you see in movies like ""The Exorcist"", ""The Rite"" goes into a more real thing, and tries to avoid going into mindless tactics of scary stuff that are made up (like turning heads on 360 degrees or vomiting pea soup, and makes even a remak on it) . As for the movie itself, it has as always its share of creeps and scary tactics, but the most important thing is that delivers a positive message. Good always triumph over evil. As a catholic I was impressed to the fact that the movie opens with a real phrase from John Paul II.

I read the book which the movie is ""loosely based"" and after reading it wasn't sure how a movie could be made of it. I don't recommend judging one based on the other. The book is somewhat dry....the movie....is Intriguing. I have read a lot on my own about exorcism and I'm a Roman Catholic. I was impressed by the research that was obviously done in making this movie. The story of the young American skeptic priest sent to Rome to learn about exorcism is compelling. I thought the acting wad First Rate. My only criticism was the ""red eyed mule"" and some of the other special effects that reminded me too much of the Amityville Horroror Poltergeist. There  is enough in the book that it wasn't necessary. Sir Anthony Hopkins I agree, is restrained in his role, but I don't think it hurts the film.The movie was publicized in such a way as to suggest some kind of anti-priest role for Mr. Hopkins and his role is clearly ""NOT"" which I'm sure earned the movie the ""panning "" it received from the critics, in large part.In terms of ""fright"" in my opinion the movie ""Exorcist"" Better....in terms of giving the viewer more of a background on exorcism itself, this movie is superior and thankfully was not used as a vehicle to slam the priesthood.

1398537,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004EPYZO4,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","The Rite is an *extremely* slow-moving -but ultimately very satisfying- horror film.  If I were to judge it based solely on the first hour, I'd have to say it lacks considerably in the suspense category.  However a horror film THIS well made has to be allowed an appropriate amount of time to develop and careful attention and patience on the part of the viewers is a requirement in order to witness its greatness.Basically the storyline is about a seminary student who travels to Italy and initially questions the existence of the devil but well... without spoiling what happens, let's just say, he changes his tune eventually.  At first he finds himself involved in an exorcism that a young pregnant woman is forced to persevere, and we witness some pretty decent acting on the part of the woman when her voice changes and the actual supposed devil takes over her mind and body.Now some might find her behavior laughable if you've never seen an exorcism and don't understand (or believe) any of this stuff, and let's be honest, nothing will ever beat the original horror classic the Exorcist released in the mid 70's so her behavior wasn't *nearly* as frightening as the little girl who portrays the devil in that film, however for basically a repeat of what was better presented in the Exorcist, this is decent enough.One problem with the movie is that for every suspenseful moment, there'd be several minutes of not so suspenseful (or in other words, downright boring) segments that accomplish very little of anything.  The second half of the movie is *clearly* when the film improves dramatically, and especially when Anthony Hopkins' character becomes the center of attention at the very end.  Without this segment, the film surely wouldn't have stood a chance of receiving more than a 3 out of 5 from me.  This is when the suspense increases almost to a boiling point which is amazing, and the way Anthony's character communicates with the seminary student and reveals to him things that nobody else could have possibly known are MAJOR highlights.Basically the storyline is about making a believer out of someone who's too convinced the devil isn't real.  You will get to witness his journey and gradual change of thinking as the film rolls along (with scattered moments of suspense and a few exorcisms to boot).

1398542,AOJQ4MJARK7V3,B004EPYZO4,Book Junkie,"[1, 1]","The Rite is a very good movie despite the horrible critic reviews.  Having missed it in theaters I rented it on Amzon's video on demand.  Like the Exorcism of Emily Rose, this is not a horror film.  If you are looking to be scared, this is not the movie for you. Though most horror films are more disgusting than scary.The Rite begins with the character of who Michael Kovac fed up with working in his father's mortuary. He wants to leave but can't pay for college. So he decides to join the seminary so as to get a college education for free, even though he personally believes in nothing.  When he graduates, Micheal attempts to resign, but the priest he sends his resignation to is not fooled and indirectly threatens to force him to pay back the cost of his education.  He doesn't do this out of spite, but because he sees something in Micheal that Micheal doesn't see in himself.  Reluctantly, Micheal agrees to go to Rome for two month to study exorcism with the notion that if when he gets back and still wants to resign, he can without repercussions.While in Rome, Michael challenges the professor of the exorcism course thereby publicly announcing his own doubts.  He is later sent to work with an older priest, Father Lucas, who is an exorcist and has been in the trade for some time. Lucas immediately shows Michael a possessed pregnant girl as proof of the existence of the devil. They continue to work on saving the possessed girl, who later dies in the movie. I like the scene where they first meet.  Fr. Lucas doesn't waste time with chit chat, he just immediately gets into the matter. Also, Michael meets a female reporter named Angeline while in Rome. They connect and become friends. At least the script writers decided to not put a romantic interest between them. Alice Braga does a good job of playing the professional reporter who connects with Michael as she too searches for the truth and has something in common with him.As the movie progresses Michael is forced to face his inner demons. The flashbacks in the movie let the viewer know that he lost his faith when his mother died, but had obviously hung on to a bit of it as he has spent his whole life searching for the truth about God and the Devil. Colin O'Donoghue does an excellent job playing the doubting Michael as he is forced to face actual cases of possession and admit that maybe the devil is real. Never once did I think his performance was forced. He was able to display the character's inner turmoil and the fact that Michael truly cares about these people that Lucas takes him to. At one point he challenges the older Fr. Lucas saying that the pregnant girl needs a psychiatrist more than a priest. Even though you can tell that even he is wondering if maybe she is possessed as she knows things about his past that no one knows about.Anthony Hopkins does a superb job as Father Lucas. When you first meet him he is a get down to business type and seems a bit off putting.  As the movie continues Hopkins manages to demonstrate the emotional side of the character without it seeming cheesy or forced. There is a scene in which Father Lucas is clearly distraught over the young girl's death. It is a very emotional scene that even you will feel Fr. Lucas' pain as he breaks down and cries and pleads with Michael to not let the devil destroy his soul like he destroyed the girl's. Hopkins also does a great job portraying the demonic taking over of the older priest until the final exorcism scene at the end. In that scene Hopkins puts a certain amount of class into it. Whereas in the Exorcist and in Emily Rose the final exorcism scene immediately starts with screaming and cussing and anything shocking that Hollywood can throw in; in The Rite, the final showdown with the devil starts off with the possessed Fr. Lucas displaying a certain amount of calm and class that only Hopkins can provide. He gets in Micheal and Angeline's heads instead on yelling insults at them.  Then, he slowly progresses into a more antagonistic character until he physically assaults Michael and the female reporter.Naturally the movie ends with Lucas being purified of his demons, which is good because I hate sad endings. Michael takes his vows and maintains his newfound belief in God and the reality of the devil/evil. I like the parting scene between Micheal and Fr. Lucas. It's not overly sentimental, but there is a chemistry between the characters & actors where they have a newfound respect for each other as they have both witnessed something few ever see.Like I said, the movie is not scary. I found it to be more of a spiritual journey type film that concerns Michael and Lucas as they both face their own failings and learn to accept that evil does exist and only with God can it be fought. But the movie also does not ignore science. Even the character of Lucas admits that there are a lot of supposed possession cases where the person is truly mentally ill. The exorcist is there when science can't explain what's wrong with an individual. The movie does leave it up to you the viewer to decide if you believe in the devil, or  science. It does provide believable resolution for the characters as they accept what's happened and move on with their lives.The quality of the movie was very good.  I rented the SD version on video on demand. It loaded quickly and there were no problems with playback. Not once did it look pixelated. It actually felt like I was watching a DVD.  I may buy this on DVD when the price goes down some.  I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good drama and isn't expecting another Exorcist movie.  Understand that there is no pea soup, spinning heads, or masturbating 12 year old girls.",4,"Good Movie, Not Horror",1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,5709,"['Rite', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'horrible',

I loved the story(truthfully I only write about the stories I love or like or completely suck).  The plot was easy to follow.  Both the story and Anthony Hopkins' performance deserved a five but Colin O'Donoghue's performance was thin and since he's the main character I summoned up a four.  His acting wasn't painful but with the clearly complex character that he had been given he missed the mark.  His performance was mediocre.  Anthony Hopkins gave a stellar performance as always.  By the end of the movie he made the hair stand up on my arms and sent chills down my spine.  When it was finished it was my bed time.

1398545,A28HQDUE9R846F,B004EPYZO4,BSXX,"[1, 2]","This movie is worth watching, it had potential, it had its moments, but suffered from self-inflicted wounds that were easily avoidable. The lead actors were fine, the writing was not. You would expect Hopkins to contribute a good performance and he did, the young priest was good as well. Without speaking a word, his facial expressions perfectly conveyed his skepticism and frustration with the old priest. These scenes were very well done, unfortunately those were his best scenes, the writing was such that his spoken lines were typical shallow Hollywood cynicism and rarely advanced the story.Internal conflict and self-doubt within the minds of the characters is realistic and result in good drama. But there is a difference between a conflicted character, and a cynical character. Realistic conflict gives life to the story, cynicism creates exasperation in the viewer (or reader). The young priest did not quite cross over into cynicism, but he was close, and in my mind the movie suffers from this and never fully recovers.....although it tried.This movie couldn't make up its mind - it didn't take itself serious enough to deliver a convincing outcome. The first 3/4 of the movie was typical Hollywood skepticism and levity about God and Christianity. During this time they threw cold water on their subject and characters, including plenty of ill-timed ""wit"", and then tried to ""pull a rabbit out of the hat"" in the end. It was forced, awkward, unsatisfying, and entirely self-inflicted.In otherwise good movies, the ill-timed use of ""wit"" has caused more damage than any other blunder (this includes books as well). I'm not against it, and if used correctly it is fine, but in a supernatural drama, a subject so somber and serious, where you are trying to build up to a dramatic climax, every instance of ""wit"" and levity should be scrutinized VERY closely, and probably eliminated unless there is a noticeable contribution to the story. (I did laugh at the cell phone scene in spite of myself.)A example of the proper use of wit and humor is the classic ""Jaws"". There was plenty of humor, wit and oddball characters, which all fit naturally within the story and were perfectly believable.Worth watching. I love Hopkins.

We get to see a young pregnant chick speak in a crazy voice and watch her body distort in unnatural positions.  Freaky for some, but you've probably seen it done before in a much more gruesome, intense fashion.  An actual possession would of course be a terrifying thing to witness, but here the battle of good vs. evil never really seems to materialize.  We witness Baal throwing out a few dark personal secrets while the priests toss back some holy water, but it stops well short of the horror element it could have registered.This movie has some irritating elements--a few cheap jump scares that might work on some but they fiercely grate on my nerves.  The dream sequences are an overdone gimmick as well.  We also witness a demonic mule and some hellacious frogs that I thought were pretty silly.Now for the good.

Basic story is you have a young man who comes from a religious background and the family business is a mortuary.  He decides to go into the seminary, get an education and become a priest, the only problem is that he doesn't have the faith he needs to make the final committment and only realizes it when he's supposed to take his final vows.  An older priest sees more in him than he does in himself and arranges for him to go to Rome for an intensive course on exorcism.  He goes to Rome, attends classes and expresses his doubts in class to his instructor.  The instructor arranges for him to meet an unorthodox priest who performs exorcisms and he goes along for the ride.

1398553,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EPYZO4,C. Sawin,"[104, 117]","The Rite looked like it would be a mixed bag right from the start. The film seemed to suffer the same fate many other films before it fell victim to and that's giving away too much of the storyline in the trailers. On top of that, it was a film that revolved around exorcism which is a subject that usually leads to disappointing results. Expectations would lead one to believe that The Rite would have enough momentum to reel you in only to drop the ball during its finale similar to last year's The Last Exorcism (except hopefully without the appearance of a neon red, glow in the dark fetus). Luckily, the film has a few surprises up its sleeve.The cinematography in the film is probably the first thing you'll notice visually. The opening of the film makes things like dripping embalming fluid, a swing set on a playground, and an overturned shopping cart seem more interesting than they really are. Rain is an element used fairly often in the film to usually signify when something has gone wrong or is about to. Whether the camera is placed up high to make it seem like you're looking down on the cast from the heavens or down low as if you're looking up at them from the depths of the earth, the rain sequences in the film are definitely some of the most memorable due to the camera work.This is probably a pretty obvious statement, but the film is worth seeing for Anthony Hopkins alone. It's not that Colin O'Donoghue does poorly since he certainly has a strong screen presence and does a fantastic job carrying the film, but Hopkins just manages to trump that while stealing every scene he's in and rightfully so. Father Lucas Trevant is the strongest and creepiest role Hopkins has played since Hannibal Lecter and his best role overall in years. It's just amazing seeing a man in his seventies give a performance that's this physical and this absorbing. Speaking of distinguished actors, it was nice seeing Rutger Hauer as well even if it was just for a small role.The dream sequences and hallucinations in the film may have been my hands down favorite. I've always been a fan of the surreal, the imaginative, the creative, and the things that don't seem to make sense at first but gain meaning as the film or story progresses. I never thought I'd find myself intrigued with the actions of a mule or that frogs could have an even deeper meaning than what you're probably expecting, but The Rite accomplishes this very well.Thankfully, The Rite delivers an exorcism film that is actually worth seeing. It'll probably be forgotten about in a year filled with so many blockbuster film releases, but considering that January and February are usually filled with such monstrous duds at the box office The Rite manages to surpass expectations. While the film does seem rather reminiscent of The Last Exorcism and borrows the atmosphere from the Heath Ledger film The Order, The Rite is actually a better experience overall. With an engrossing performance by Anthony Hopkins along with a fairly strong cast all around, its fantastic cinematography, surreal dream sequences, and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't hint at a sequel, The Rite is actually a surprisingly decent film all around.",3,Anthony Hopkins at his best,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,3197,"['Rite', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'mixed', 'bag', 'right', 'start', 'film', 'seemed', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'fell', 'victim', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'storyline', 'trailers', 'top', 'was', 'film', 'revolved', 'exorcism', 'subject', 'usually', 'disappointing', 'results', 'Expectations', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'Rite', 'would', 'have', 'enough', 'momentum', 'reel', 'only', 'drop', 'ball', 'finale', 'similar', 'last', 'year', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'hopefully', 'appearance', 'neon', 'red', 'glow', 'dark', 'fetus', 'Luckily', 'film', 'few', 'up', 'sleeve.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'probably', 'first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'visually', 'opening', 'film', 'things', 'dripping', 'embalming', 'fluid', 'swing', 'set', 'playground', 'overturned', 'shopping', 'cart', 'seem', 'more', 'interesting', 'really', 'are', 'Rain', 'element', 'used', 'fairly', 'often', 'film', 'usually', 'signify', 'when', 'something', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Whether', 'camera', 'placed', 'up', 'high', 'make', 'seem', ""'re"", 'looking', 'down', 'cast', 'heavens', 'down', 'low', ""'re"", 'looking', 'up', 'depths', 'earth', 'rain', 'sequences', 'film', 'are', 'definitely', 'most', 'memorable', 'due', 'camera', 'work.This', 'probably', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'statement', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'alone', 'not', 'Colin', ""O'Donoghue"", 'poorly', 'certainly', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'fantastic', 'job', 'carrying', 'film', 'Hopkins', 'just', 'trump', 'stealing', 'scene', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Father', 'Lucas', 'Trevant', 'strongest', 'creepiest', 'role', 'Hopkins', 'played', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'best', 'role', 'overall', 'years', 'just', 'amazing', 'seeing', 'man', 'seventies', 'give', 'performance', 'physical', 'absorbing', 'Speaking', 'distinguished', 'actors', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'well', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'small', 'role.The', 'dream', 'sequences', 'hallucinations', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'hands', 'down', 'favorite', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'surreal', 'imaginative', 'creative', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'sense', 'first', 'gain', 'meaning', 'film', 'story', 'progresses', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'find', 'intrigued', 'actions', 'mule', 'frogs', 'could', 'have', 'even', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'what', ""'re"", 'probably', 'expecting', 'Rite', 'very', 'well.Thankfully', 'Rite', 'delivers', 'exorcism', 'film', 'actually', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'forgotten', 'year', 'filled', 'so', 'many', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'releases', 'considering', 'January', 'February', 'are', 'usually', 'filled', 'such', 'monstrous', 'duds', 'box', 'office', 'Rite', 'surpass', 'expectations', 'film', 'seem', 'rather', 'reminiscent', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'atmosphere', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'film', 'Order', 'Rite', 'actually', 'better', 'experience', 'overall', 'engrossing', 'performance', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'fairly', 'strong', 'cast', 'around', 'fantastic', 'cinematography', 'surreal', 'dream', 'sequences', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'hint', 'sequel', 'Rite', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'film']",N/A

1398561,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004EPYZO4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 6]","THE RITE (2011, dir. Mikael Hafstrom, 1:55) is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Truly, one of the worst. Obviously it must be well known by now that it is about the Catholic Church and exorcism ... and let me say up front, the two versions, both laughable, of the original EXORCIST prequel were far better than this limp rag of a film. (Vid.Dominion - Prequel to the Exorcist,Exorcist: The Beginningand both my reviews.)Let me give you the synopsis of this meandering and pointless story, cobbled together from discarded scraps of old Church urban myth: young man Michael Kovac (horrendously acted, if you can call it acting, by Colin O'Donoghue) becomes a seminarian, annoys the hell out of everyone, gets sent to Rome to be trained as an exorcist as a reward, meets an exorcist (Father Lucas Trevant by Sir Anthony Hopkins) who then becomes possessed. Guess who has to save the poor old exorcist.Get the picture? ""Youth, come and save the Church from itself.""Hopkins takes on a role that I thought Sir Ben Kingsley ought to have had, considering Kingsley's track record. (But he gets possessed, see, so they needed old Hannibal Lector one more time.) Fr. Trevant is a comical, eccentric old Welsh priest living in Rome: Fr. Brown of the Church of Rome incarnate. His attempted pithy one-liners sound junior high school-level at best, like the rest of the dialogue.Rutger Hauer as Michael's father Istvan is totally wasted here, as is Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Father Xavier the exorcist-trainer. Michael's gradeschool kid wardrobe is not the only thing this film ripped off of HARRY POTTER. Sad. In an important scene, Fr. Trevant blesses Michael and makes the sign of the cross backward: that is just one of many unbelievably stupid things in this film. Possibly it was one of Hopkins' famous practical jokes that was inadvertently kept in the film; Hopkins admitted in an interview that he had no idea what he was doing and needed coaching from a real Catholic priest. But then this could have been homage to Hopkins' dual role inBram Stoker's Dracula, as Father Cesare. RITE makesThe Orderlook like Oscar material.I have to say, Hopkins' Italian is perfect, even though his lines in Italian were as stupid as the rest of the dialogue. I was angered and offended by the possessed pregnant girl and the young boy who suffered Satanic hoofmarks all over his body. A total creep show ... for what? To scare us?With its Wikipedia dialogue of silly arguments and confrontations, the thing could have at least restrained itself a little with the demonic elements and made it more cerebral. The attempts to make demonic possession seem like a worthy cerebral exercise remind me of the questions I see on the sophomoric Yahoo!Answers.This thing was released on the heels of the real-life situation with the Church needing exorcists and trying to train a new generation of priests to perform exorcisms. As it touts itself to be based on actual events, all I can say is I think I know upon whom the characters of Michael and Fr. Trevant are based. I say, I THINK I know.

1398562,A2GPRA9HHLOC4B,B004EPYZO4,Eric L. Willard,"[1, 1]","I definately enjoyed the movie The Rite. Some people may say, exorcism movies are cliche, they have done it all before but in this case, we are given a side (or plot line) involving a young seminary student named Michael Kovak (who moonlights as a mortician) that, just as he is deciding that this is not the path for him, some extreme, life altering occurances make him rethink his decisions. Now, as he decides to accept the exorcism course in Rome and see for himself if he is making the right choices, he is still undecided and it will take Anthony Hopkins (Father Lucas) to shed some light (or dark) onto the situation in order to help Michael Kovak finally decide, does he truly believe in the path he is on? Even guidance from his Dad, played by Rutger Hauer isn't helping him.Personal notes:Why couldn't we get Rutger Hauer and Anthony Hopkins on the same screen? That would be history.Without spoiling it, the twist ending that I saw where/how Michael Kovak finally decides his path was excellent. Fine writing and fine acting. Michael's character, even in the opening scenes, show you that he cares for the individual deep down inside.The acting by the woman possessed (Marta Gastini) was excellent as well. I will be looking for more films with her.One of the best lines that was good foreshadowing:  Father Lucas, ""Be careful Michael, choosing not to believe in the devil doesn't protect you from him.""This is not Anthony Hopkins' finest work but it is worth the watch.I suggest buying it for the fan of dark, religious movies that still have a story to be told.",4,Can't quite give it 5 but it's worth the watch,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,1574,"['definately', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Rite', 'people', 'may', 'say', 'exorcism', 'movies', 'are', 'cliche', 'have', 'done', 'case', 'are', 'given', 'side', 'plot', 'line', 'involving', 'young', 'seminary', 'student', 'named', 'Michael', 'Kovak', 'who', 'moonlights', 'mortician', 'just', 'deciding', 'not', 'path', 'extreme', 'life', 'altering', 'occurances', 'make', 'rethink', 'decisions', 'Now', 'accept', 'exorcism', 'course', 'Rome', 'see', 'making', 'right', 'choices', 'still', 'undecided', 'will', 'take', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Father', 'Lucas', 'shed', 'light', 'dark', 'situation', 'order', 'help', 'Michael', 'Kovak', 'finally', 'decide', 'truly', 'believe', 'path', 'Even', 'guidance', 'Dad', 'played', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', ""n't"", 'helping', 'him.Personal', 'notes', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'same', 'screen', 'would', 'be', 'history.Without', 'spoiling', 'twist', 'ending', 'saw', 'where/how', 'Michael', 'Kovak', 'finally', 'path', 'was', 'excellent', 'Fine', 'writing', 'fine', 'acting', 'Michael', 'character', 'even', 'opening', 'scenes', 'show', 'individual', 'deep', 'inside.The', 'acting', 'woman', 'possessed', 'Marta', 'Gastini', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'more', 'films', 'her.One', 'best', 'lines', 'was', 'good', 'foreshadowing', 'Father', 'Lucas', 'Be', 'careful', 'Michael', 'choosing', 'not', 'believe', 'devil', ""n't"", 'protect', 'not', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'finest', 'work', 'watch.I', 'suggest', 'buying', 'fan', 'dark', 'religious', 'movies', 'still', 'have', 'story', 'be', 'told']",N/A

1398567,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004EPYZO4,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","Matt Baglio's book THE RITE: MAKING OF A MODERN EXORCIST is described as 'In 2007, the Vatican's chief exorcist revealed an initiative to install an exorcist in every diocese worldwide.  Three days later, the Vatican denied the story. Father Gary Thomas was working as a parish priest in California when church leaders asked him to travel to Rome for training in the rite of exorcism. In Rome, as an apprentice to a veteran Italian exorcist, his eyes were opened to a darker side of the Catholic faith he had never known, and he came to see the battle between good and evil as never before. Journalist Matt Baglio had full access to Father Gary over the course of his training, and the astonishing story he found reveals that the phenomena of possession, demons, the Devil, and exorcism are not merely a remnant of the archaic past, but remain a fearsome power in many people's lives even today.  The inspiration for the movie The Rite, starring Anthony Hopkins, this book provides a uniquely intimate glimpse into the chilling world of a real-life Roman Catholic exorcist.'And so with a few name changes to protect the innocent Michael Petroni adapted this book for the screen and in doing so developed a very understandable survey of the 'rite' of exorcism.  In the film the student is Michael Kovak (Colin Donaghue, a new young Irish actor) whose indecisions about things clerical harken back to his childhood when while living in a house used as a mortuary he is trained by his father Istvan (Rutger Hauer) and is forced to examine his mother's corpse being prepared for burial.  Knowing that Michael only choices for career were mortician or priest he opts, unconvincingly, for the  latter. After completely seminary but before taking his vows as a priest, Michael resigns form the seminary, only to be encouraged to proceed on a different course by his mentor Father Matthew (Toby Jones) who sends him off to Rome to learn exorcism because of a new demand for priests trained in that rite.  Michael goes to Rome and in classes given by Father Xavier (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) is found to be an outspoken and sent to study with a brilliant exorcist, Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins).  Michael learns during several exorcisms on a young pregnant girl (Marta Gastini) that in order to perform exorcism the priest must believe in not only God but also the devil.  Michael meets  journalist Angeline (Alice Braga) in his classroom who asks to accompany Michael on exorcisms (this is probably meant to be author Baglio's role), and in her presence we witness the transformation of Michael into a believer - with a few surprises arising!Director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m paces this film well and while there are no truly new insights into the field of exorcism, he does manage to make the acts appear fairly credible.  Hopkins gives his usual bravura performance and the rest of the cast thankfully underplays their roles.  Some of the scenes are fairly gruesome so it is not a film for the weak of heart.  And if the viewer is expecting a docudrama of Baglio's book, there will be some disappointment.  It is a movie and as a movie it is entertaining.

1398570,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B004EPYZO4,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[0, 2]","Anthony Hopkins is one of the finest actors that I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  It's interesting that many people would call his ""Silence of the Lambs"" role as Hannibal Lecter quite possibly his finest piece of acting, and it was brilliant, but my favorite role was the job he did as Van Helsing in Bram Stoker's Dracula.  While not honoring the book, Hopkins added flavor and brilliance to the role.  So, when I heard that Hopkins was in the movie called ""The Rite"", I knew that I had to watch it.  ""The Rite"" is a movie about the exorcists, and that's right up my alley.In ""The Rite"", a young man decides to enter the seminary after spending his life observing his father as a mortician.  Wanting no part of life as an undertaker, but feeling limited to the life of a priest or an undertaker, the young man, Michael, chooses the priesthood, but for selfish reasons.  Michael has a faith problem, and while there are those who believe in him in his ability to be a priest, Michael just wanted to steal an education.  Ultimately, Father Superior talks Michael into taking a course in Rome on exorcisms.  When the instructor, Xavier, finds Michael snotty little atheistic attitude to be revolting, he decides to send Michael and his doubts to see a real exorcist in action, Father Lucas, played exceptionally well by the aforementioned Anthony Hopkins.As it turns out, Michael is not as smart as he thinks, but he holds on to his doubts with all his might even when his doubts and skepticism becomes rather obtuse in light of the facts present before him.  At this point, Michael actually tries to intervene on a possessed girl's behalf in a medical way and overrule Father Lucas.  This proves costly.  So, the basic battles here are the old ones between science and religion and good and evil and the role of Satan's deception of the human condition.  Query, where does Michael's faith lie?  Can Father Lucas show him the error of his ways?  Will Satan win yet another battle and destroy more souls?  Is demonic possession real or is just a medical condition that these people suffer from?  Michael wrestles with these questions and what he chooses to believe in will ultimately decide the fates of several lives.""The Rite"" starts out well with a lot of interesting questions about exorcists and demonic possession and the question of faith and how it relates to the human condition--I like this much about ""The Rite"".  However, I thought that the creators of this movie went in the wrong direction with regard to plot direction.  ""The Rite"" is supposedly inspired by true events, and while that may be so, that does not shield the movie from warranted criticisms.  Indeed, ""The Rite"" is very reliant on Michael's character and to be quite frank not reliant enough on Anthony Hopkins' character, Father Lucas.  Indeed, I was not very impressed with that actor who portrayed Michael.  Surely, they could have done a better job picking someone with superior acting ability, but they did not, and this hurts the movie.  Anthony Hopkins was brilliant, however, and the scenes with Hopkins present are the most interesting scenes of the movie, so not only does Hopkins' acting ability overshadow everyone else's, but also the scenes of the movie with Hopkins present clearly overshadow the rest of the action of the movie.  Indeed, ""The Rite"" left me wanting more Hopkins' scenes, but perhaps most importantly, I did not like the rash direction (that I saw coming a mile away--very predictable) that movie chose to go in about 2/3 of the way through the movie.  I cannot analyze this much further as it would involve spoilers, but I just found this particular decision by the creators of this movie to be ineffective, anti-climactic and a bit over the top.  This decision creates a rather anti-climactic ending and severely cripples the movie as it became predictable and boring at this point and sadly, it became rather silly in my opinion which goes against the grain of what this type of movie is all about.The plot execution was decent notwithstanding limitations in the acting, but there is no question that this movie did not live up to its potential.  Even though ""The Rite"" is a decent movie about demonic possession and Catholic act of exorcism, the movie fails to deliver in spots, and left me wanting more.  I thought that the scenes involving the exorcisms could have been much more effective.  No one expects ""The Rite"" to be able to match up with the seminal classic movie on demonic possession and exorcisms called ""The Exorcist"" (maybe my favorite movie of all-time), but they could have spent more time with the dialogue between priest and demons and the exorcism scenes were clearly not very dynamic.  The action flowed fairly well notwithstanding the uneven acting, the atmosphere was lacking at times and very inconsistent and while ""The Rite"" has style, it could have done more in the substance department.  ""The Rite"" was suspenseful at times, but even though the movie is rated PG-13, I couldn't help but notice that ""The Rite"" is simply not a very scary movie at all.  I would call ""The Rite"" a very light horror movie.In conclusion, ""The Rite"" is an interesting movie about demonic possession and the Catholic act of exorcism, but it is lacking in vital areas like atmosphere, suspense at times, very light on scares and while the execution was good the story itself takes a rash turn that cripples the movie's effectiveness.  Last but not least, ""The Rite"" relies too much on the actor who plays Michael, and he's simply not up for the role.  Too much Michael in this film and not enough of Father Lucas, ""The Rite"" proves to be a very interesting movie that grabs the viewer early on and builds on that promise, but ultimate begins to fade and crashes down to a miserable conclusion by the movie's end.  Still, it's not without value as it is interesting, but do not over expect with this very mediocre movie.",3,"2.5 STARS:  Started out well, but falters towards the end...left me wanting more and

The possession and exorcism rite are executed with much more believable subtlety than many exorcism films, and we benefit as a result (though Hopkins still gets to chew some scenery in the climax). We also benefit from the beautiful scenery of Rome, a visually inspired and fitting change of setting for such a film. All of the performances are top-rate, although the talented supporting cast (Rutger Hauer, Ciaran Hinds, Toby Jones) are underused. In the end, the audience is left with all the right questions regarding faith, doubt, the impact of life circumstances on belief, and the spiritual world.

1398573,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B004EPYZO4,J from NY,"[3, 6]","""The Rite"" isn't a terrible film--I certainly enjoyed it a bit more than the Vatican II bashing propaganda book upon which it is based--but it derives so heavily fromThe Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray] andThe Exorcist IIIthat it is enough to make one blush.  They attempt to replicate both of these films in one with only a touch of irony: any fan of these two demonic classics--perhaps, along with theAmityville II: The Possession, still the best in this huge genre--will know what I'm talking about.  Father Luckacs (Anthony Hopkins having fun) is Father Merrin in the first half and Father Colin, the young doubting priest, is Father Damien Karras.  When the nails have been spit out and a few (sparse) meaningful conversations about certainty are exchanged between the two, Father Luckacs gets possessed.  He becomes Father Damien Karras in The Exorcist III--the possessed saint who needs to be freed from his bindings.The visions, hallucinations, that kind of thing were appealing (if you're a fan of this genre) but the thesis set forth isn't really convincing at all.  In Italy there is a higher rate of demonic possession than anywhere else, yes, and you will see more priests performing the ritual.  Italy also has a high rate of sexual abuse with young women and incest than almost anywhere else in the country.  Spitting out nails and coins doth not a possessed person make, not even close.  Talk to any nurse who works at an ER and they will tell you that mentally disturbed people regularly swallow coins, even sharper materials like glass and cigarette lighters.  And they spit them out.  I do believe demonic possession is possible and has happened, but overall this conservative hatred of Vatican II and the freedom it created has translated into these kind of unconvincing book to movie deals.  I enjoyed the movie, though, because I'm a Catholic.

1398575,A1Q9DNHFEEZ47T,B004EPYZO4,Joel S. Peters,"[18, 27]","I had just finished reading the book, _The Rite_, about two or three months before this movie came out in theaters. The book was fascinating, provocative, informative, and often riveting, so when news of the impending release of ""the movie version"" came to my attention I was thrilled at the prospect of seeing it. In the interim, though, I found out about a significant plot discrepancy in the movie (I won't spoil it for you) that sufficiently disgusted me--to the point where I chose not to see the movie in the theater but rather wait until it came out on DVD. On a whim, I ended up buying the DVD ($20) before I had bothered to take the time renting it first from a local Red Box rental machine ($1).  My mistake.The first clue that the movie may not be faithful to the book's contents was its opening statement that it was ""Inspired by True Events."" This is not the same thing as saying ""Based on True Events,"" and there's good reason why the former statement was used instead of the latter: the movie has virtually nothing to do with the book. The movie is quite fresh in my mind (I literally just finished watching it), and the extent to which it bears any resemblance whatsoever to the book is as follows: (1) It has the same name. (2) A possessed woman who spits up nails occurs in both, though in the book she was not pregnant. (3) A priest goes to Rome to learn about exorcism from a seasoned, older exorcist. (4) The real life senior exorcist, Fr. Carmine DeFilippis (who happens to be mentioned in the movie), and Fr. Lucas (once, early in the movie) tapped people when the exorcism was done. That's where any and all parallels end.The movie's plot is fairly straightforward. It involves a young Catholic seminarian named Michael Kovak who goes to Rome to learn about exorcism from an older, experienced exorcist named Fr. Lucas. While there, Michael wrestles with his own theological doubts as well as unsettling memories and unresolved issues from his childhood. He meets a female reporter whom he befriends, and she serves as a kind of sounding board for Michael.  Both of them ""want to know the truth""--he about God, and she about reporting facts--so their mutual journey proves to be a kind of revelation for them, both in their individual ways and simultaneously about the existence of the supernatural.The main problems with the movie vis-&agrave;-vis the book are significant:(1) The movie revolves in a big way around the fact that the seminary student (he's not yet even a priest, for crying out loud), Michael Kovak, is someone who doubts God's existence. I would even go so far as to say he is portrayed as an outright unbeliever, which is quite odd given that he is a seminarian. The writers were clearly more intent on showcasing this doubt/lack of faith than other aspects of the storyline, and it smacks of near ridicule of belief in the supernatural. I can only guess that perhaps the writers intended to show a progression of the character's own spiritual journey from doubt to belief, but it just comes across as contrived and plastic. In fact, Michael doesn't even come to believe in God until about ten minutes before the end of the movie.(2) Except for a few dramatic scenes that occasionally punctuate the storyline, the movie trudges along at what I found to be a painfully slow pace. I kept looking at the elapsed time display on my DVD player to see how far along the movie was, hoping that ""any time now"" the movie would pick up and sustain its pace. I was still waiting for that to happen more than an hour into it.(3) There are so many details in the book that were ignored, distorted, and/or misrepresented in the movie that made the movie lose most of its credibility. From where (in a cramped room that could barely fit four people at most), how (often using Latin prayers taken out of the Roman Ritual of Exorcism), and how often (usually more than a dozen times in a single day) the real-life Fr. Carmine DeFilippis performs exorcisms to where and how he lives (not discussed in the book but portrayed prominently in the movie), the movie takes all kinds of liberties. Here's another small example that demonstrates the director's inattention to detail. The real-life Michael Kovak, a priest named Fr. Gary Thomas, actually served as a consultant for this movie. He specifically instructed Anthony Hopkins to form the Sign of the Cross as up-down-left-right, but in the movie we still see Fr. Lucas doing it up-down-right-left. It may sound like an insignificant detail, but since the Sign of the Cross is such a major Catholic sign, and since it plays such a prominent role in exorcisms, to do it the opposite way is just ridiculous and careless.(4) SPOILER ALERT! The most egregious element of the movie is when Fr. Lucas himself becomes possessed. This plot detail is absolute, utter nonsense compared to the book, which not only didn't even HINT at such a prospect but if anything strongly implied the absurdity of it. For the writer and/or director to put such an element in the movie was proof positive that the movie was fiction, not fact.(5) The ""update information"" provided before the end credits, which normally adds credibility to the movie and provides continuity with the present, is clearly meant for dramatic effect and nothing more. It just isn't accurate. The first blurb reads, ""Father Michael Kovak is one of 14 exorcists practicing in the United States today. He now works out of his parish near Chicago."" The fact is that Fr. Gary Thomas went back to his parish in the Diocese of San Jose, CA and continues to serve as its exorcist. As far as the number of exorcists in the U.S. goes, it's hard to know for sure. Their identities are usually not publicized. However, it is safe to say that there is definitely a shortage of them compared to the demand for them. There *should* be one exorcist per diocese, and there are 197 dioceses in the U.S. Pope John Paul II really did emphasize the need to train more exorcists, but their number surely is not what it should be. The second blurb reads, ""Father Lucas Trevant has performed over two thousand exorcisms. He continues to practice in a township outside of Florence."" Fr. Carmine DeFilippis, who mentored Fr. Thomas, continues to serve as a exorcist in Rome, and though I don't recall the book specifically mentioning the number of exorcisms he has performed to date, based on the number he performs daily (which *is* mentioned in the book) coupled with the fact that he's been an exorcist for 24 years, I'd say that 2,000 is a very low estimate--in fact, distortedly low. By comparison, Fr. Gabriel Amorth, Rome's chief exorcist who has been performing exorcisms for about 2 years longer than Fr. Carmine, has dealt with 70,000 cases of demonic possession.As other reviewers have accurately pointed out, Anthony Hopkins' performance is wonderful, and the cinematography is exquisitely done.  For me, however, those elements are overshadowed by how much of a travesty of the book this movie is. If you choose to watch it, I highly recommend that you rent it or borrow it from your library before you buy it. That way you can make a more informed decision about whether or not to plunk down your hard-earned cash. If you want to see a high-paced, provocative movie about exorcism that is based on real-life circumstances, I recommend you watch ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" Though some liberties were also taken with that movie, the essential details of the actual case are portrayed accurately, as are the elements of demonic possession.",1,Profoundly Disappointing and

Many critics had panned it, but what tipped the scales for me was the tour de force performance by Anthony Hopkins, one of his best in years. His range of voice, the make-up, his facial expressions, everything controlled and perfectly modulated. I felt as if I were in the hands of a master actor.Michael Kowak (Colin O'Donoghue) is a young man who works at his father's mortuary. He and his father have an adversarial relationship. The son decides to go to a seminary for four years. He is ordained a priest, but then he has serious doubts and is skeptical of his faith. After submitting his resignation, he witnesses an accident in which a young woman and his superior priest are injured. The woman is dying, and she begs Father Kowak to give her the last rites. He hesitates for some moments, and decides to give the rites. The other priest witnesses this. Later he cajoles Michael not to resign immediately but to take a course in exorcism in Rome. (A little monetary blackmail is involved in the superior's request.)In Rome Michael begins the course with Father Xavier (Ciaran Hinds). After a time the teacher decides that Michael is a hard case so he assigns him to Father Lucas Trevany (Anthony Hopkins), a longtime experienced exorcist.The cinematography in this film is excellent especially the street scenes in Rome and the strange courtyard of Trevant's house with its run-down features, iconography, and its typical army of Roman cats.The film wisely concentrates on two cases of people who have been co-opted by the devil. One is young pregnant woman, and one is a young boy. Father Trevant is trying to exorcise the devil from each of them, but in order to do so he must find out the name the devil is using. You'll be entranced by the use of the mule in this film. Both of the possessed people reveal stuff that only Michael would know or which give him great pause.Angela Braze plays a reporter named Angelina who becomes a witness to Satanic possession. Michael's character becomes more complex as we go further into the movie. Who in the movie is possessed and who is not?The scenes of exorcism are gripping and scary. I found the movie very involving, with superior acting by all involved in this finely crafted plot. Hearkening back to that earlier movie about exorcism, Father Trevant says, ""What did you expect, pea soup?""",5,Anthony Hopkins: A Triumph!,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,2466,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Rite', 'was', 'very', 'well-done', 'suspenseful', 'engrossing', 'movie', 'well', 'viewing', 'Many', 'critics', 'had', 'panned', 'what', 'tipped', 'scales', 'was', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'one', 'best', 'years', 'range', 'voice', 'make-up', 'facial', 'expressions', 'everything', 'controlled', 'perfectly', 'modulated', 'felt', 'were', 'hands', 'master', 'actor.Michael', 'Kowak', 'Colin', ""O'Donoghue"", 'young', 'man', 'who', 'father', 'mortuary', 'father', 'have', 'adversarial', 'relationship', 'son', 'go', 'seminary', 'four', 'years', 'ordained', 'priest', 'then', 'serious', 'doubts', 'skeptical', 'faith', 'submitting', 'resignation', 'accident', 'young', 'woman', 'superior', 'priest', 'are', 'injured', 'woman', 'dying', 'Father', 'Kowak', 'give', 'last', 'rites', 'moments', 'decides', 'give', 'rites', 'other', 'priest', 'Later', 'Michael', 'not', 'resign', 'immediately', 'take', 'course', 'exorcism', 'Rome', 'little', 'monetary', 'blackmail', 'involved', 'superior', 'request', 'Rome', 'Michael', 'course', 'Father', 'Xavier', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'time', 'teacher', 'Michael', 'hard', 'case', 'so', 'Father', 'Lucas', 'Trevany', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'longtime', 'experienced', 'exorcist.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'excellent', 'especially', 'street', 'scenes', 'Rome', 'strange', 'courtyard', 'Trevant', 'house', 'run-down', 'features', 'iconography', 'typical', 'army', 'Roman', 'cats.The', 'film', 'wisely', 'two', 'cases', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'co-opted', 'devil', 'One', 'young', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'one', 'young', 'boy', 'Father', 'Trevant', 'trying', 'exorcise', 'devil', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'must', 'find', 'out', 'name', 'devil', 'using', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entranced', 'use', 'mule', 'film', 'possessed', 'people', 'reveal', 'stuff', 'only', 'Michael', 'would', 'know', 'give', 'great', 'pause.Angela', 'Braze', 'reporter', 'named', 'Angelina', 'who', 'witness', 'Satanic', 'possession', 'Michael', 'character', 'more', 'complex', 'go', 'further', 'movie', 'Who', 'movie', 'possessed', 'who', 'not', 'scenes', 'exorcism', 'are', 'gripping', 'scary', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'involving', 'superior', 'acting', 'involved', 'finely', 'crafted', 'plot', 'Hearkening', 'back', 'earlier', 'movie', 'exorcism', 'Father', 'Trevant', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'pea', 'soup']",N/A

The young priest passes from doubt to Faith only when a demon has a hand round his throat - but he *does* pass the test. The End.The Rite is the sort of film Hollywood would produce regularly if there were a powerful Roman Catholic bloque in Tinseltown. Like Mel Gibson'sThe Passion of the Christ (Full Screen Edition), The Rite is a movie ideally suited for Roman Catholics and the majority of Christians. Unlike The Passion of the Christ, The Rite is not a powerful film. Unlike The Passion of the Christ, I feel The Rite could have been much better with a little more attention to detail. Attention to plot, for example. Since I'm engaging in rampant similes in this review, here's another: The Rite is similar toGladiatorwith Russell Crowe in that both films really hang upon the outstanding performances of the lead characters: here, Anthony Hopkins.

I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...The Rite (2011) is a movie that is ""inspired by true events"", NOT ""based on a true story"", as many people erroneously believe. To me, this movie has been done several times before. It's basically a mixture of some elements from The Exorcist (1973) and The Exorcist III (1990), with some elements of the Omen movies and other exorcism/demonic possession movies, such as The Last Exorcism (2010) sprinkled in. Really. I won't include any spoilers for these movies in this review, in case you haven't seen them. Trust me - the story for The Rite is different, yet similar to these previous movies, if that makes sense. It seems that these demonic possession movies are all pretty much the same. As far as pacing goes, the movie drags quite a bit, but things pick up more later on in the movie. Anthony Hopkins does a good job acting. Really, the whole cast does a good job. The movie has a couple of humorous moments, some laugh-out-loud moments of camp, and some jump-out-of-your-seat moments. I prefer suspense rather than a sudden scare that comes out of nowhere, but whatever...The musical score is decent. As I mentioned previously, this movie was inspired by and borrowed from the Exorcist and Omen movies, except these movies were done better, on the whole. Overall, I can't give a strong recommendation for this movie.

1398581,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B004EPYZO4,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[1, 3]","If you're looking for Hannibal Lecter, look elsewhere. The ad shows the face of Anthony Hopkins in a Lecter-like mask with a Lecter-like demeanor, but this is no Lecter. This is Father Lucas, an exorcist, whose job it is to perform the rite that will free victims of their demons. However, even Father Lucas becomes possessed by a most notable demon and must be freed in ""The Rite,"" a dark and shadowy nod to the netherworld filled with dark and scary beings.Although the film is entitled ""The Rite,"" I see it as a film of faith and belief despite the whole scabrous condition of sin and its need for forgiveness, evil and its opponent goodness, doubt and its reversal into belief. For it is the story of opposites that finally convinces Young, Maybe-Soon-to-Be Father Michael (played convincingly by Colin McDonough) that he is capable of fulfilling his role and obligations.In-between comes the conflict between priest and demon with the outcome a victory for winner and possible death of life for the victim. Sixteen-year-old Rosie is pregnant by her abusive father yet shudders to admit it. The young priest watches and listens to Rosie's horrible ejaculations of hate and filth and becomes convinced she is psychologically unbalanced and needs a psychotherapist, not an exorcist. Yes, Michael is a doubter on the brink of resigning the priesthood before he becomes a priest. His seminary mentor sees in the young man a potentially beneficial priest and convinces him to undergo a two-month course in exorcism at the Vatican. ""Two months in Rome can't be that bad,"" he uses as a selling point.The story is that Michael Kolvak is the son of a mortician and knows his father will not send him to college. His family has produced only morticians and priests, so he goes to the seminary with the plan of opting out of the priesthood after he gets a degree. His religious beliefs are practically non-existent, yet he goes to Rome.During his first class he questions the concept of exorcism. In fact, one of the major premises of the entire film is the ability to question, to think out our beliefs, to learn our place in in the Big Picture. The director goes on ""to say"" that if we don't reach our own conclusions, our faith can falter and even vanish.The film is set up with increasing tension, darker shadows, ever greater pulsating evil, and terrors both within and without. Even in the face of these apparent evils, he still hesitates. It's only when Father Lucas, who claims to be an ordinary man subject to his own periods of doubt and disbelief is possessed does Michael step forward to practice the rite of exorcism as he has observed Father Lucas perform it.The only jarring note, for me, in the film occurs the day after the exorcism. Father Lucas is so blase he does not mention it. It's as if it never happened.Does Anthony Hopkins still have ""it""? Most definitely. When he explains his own disappearing faith after so many encounters with demons, he pauses, then with a little smile, says, ""But I come back into the light.""Note: I deducted one star because the director infused the possessed priest (Hopkins) with Lecter behavior and speech during his possessed state.

Our story begins with a Catholic mortician (Rutger Hauer) and his young son, Michael (Colin O'Donoghue).  Fast forward about 10 years, Michael is a man and leaves the Kovak & Son family business to study to become a priest.  Four years later, Michael is graduating the seminary college but is very confused about his future.  He has not taken his final vows when he is sent to Rome for two weeks training on The Rite of Exorcism.  When he is encouraged to meet the less orthodox Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins), he sets out on a path of understanding that far exceeds his expectation that demonic possession is just a psychological condition.This slightly less than 2 hour film is well done, sufficiently scary, suspenseful, and reminds us that Satan is the master of illusion.  It is also a film about the importance of having faith.  Sir Anthony is outstanding in his role as a priest who has been performing exorcisms for some time in Rome. Although I rated the movie an overall ""4,""  Sir Anthony deserves a ""10"" for his acting (as usual).  He not only gets into a role, he BECOMES the role.  Colin does a very nice job as the priest candidate whose beliefs are challenged as he meets some of Satan's demons for himself.

There were a few moments in this movie when I thought of that old film and even it's sequels, but this is a very differant movie, and a very differant story. Nothing will ever compare to that old classic, quite possibly the scariest movie ever made, so let's forget it. It's not a competition.This movie as a stand alone film about possesion was very well acted, very well written, and beautifly shot in Rome. There were a few jump scrares and better than that a few psychological scares. I hate cheap jump scares because any directer can do it. You have a nice quiet scene and then boom, something jumps at the screen and you jump too. But a psychological scare is very hard to come by and this movie has them.In that old film, when regan spins her head slowly 360, it's a slow, stomach turning fright. Those are the scares I love and cherish, and this film has them. 4 stars out of 5 in my book.Being a digital age movie, the Blu-ray looks outstanding. The only special features are deleted scenes.

1398592,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B004EPYZO4,K. Ostrowski,"[2, 2]","I had this film recommended to me by an apologist I like, and honestly, I can see why he liked it so much.  It's a nice, strong, faithful Catholic horror movie about the rite of exorcism.First let me say that this movie is not for the squeamish.  It is a genuine horror movie, and contains genuinely-horrific scenes and imagery, made all the more horrific by the fact that, unlike over-the-top horror movies like ""Exorcist"" or ""The Shining,"" there's no excessive fixation on advanced graphics, dynamic visual sights or impossible contortions on the part of those possessed.This film contains most things that people find objectionable.  Violent, demonic behavior, hate-filled exchanges between characters, the suffering of the innocent, blood, sexual innuendos and the most offensive curses (as near as I can tell) in our language.  Rest assured, this film is for those with strong stomachs only.  In fact, just to be on the safe side, I'd treat this film as though it were rated R, if I were you.That having been said, I loved it.A young seminarian named Michael, who only really joined the seminary to get away from his father, is sent to Rome for training on how to become an exorcist.  While there, he makes the acquaintence of an older priest named Father Lucas (played wonderfully by Anthony Hopkins,) who knows how the whole exorcism thing is done.  The two attend some exorcisms together, but Michael remains skeptical, until someone dies, and he begins to see visions himself; and realizes that someone new has been possessed.The role of faith in the job of an exorcist is underscored throughout the whole second half of the movie, as is the reality of Satan and evil, and all of this plays into the final confrontation between the aspiring young exorcist and his enemy.This film distinguishes itself by not only making the Catholic Church the good guys, but doing it in a realistic and sober way.  As I said, the toning down of the visuals usually popular in exorcism films is both more real and more terrifying than if they'd been included, and it hits much closer to home as a result of that.  The film ultimately ends on a high note; with the validation of sin, of the concept of the state of grace, and the importance of the sacrament of confession in maintaining it.I can perfectly understand if horror movies aren't your cup of tea.  Most very religious people don't, as a rule, like them, and vice versa, but as a religious person myself, and a thoroughly non-squeamish person, I think this is one of the finest horror movies I've ever seen, from both a religious and moviegoing perspective.  It's not afraid to slap skepticism across the face, it doesn't take things easy on you, and it validates the beliefs of Catholicism in the process.  It was very intense, but also very good.",4,"I'd Have Rated This Film R.

As far as he can tell, he can walk away from the church prior to his ordination - no harm, no foul as far as he can see it.His advisor, Father Matthew, see more in Michael and informs him that he has two choices, either convert his expenses incurred at the seminary into a student loan or go to the Vatican and take additional classes.  Father Matthew tells Michael of the rise of demonic possessions every year and that the Church needs more exorcists.This is where the movie turns creepy.

Doyle ""film buff""","[39, 44]","THE RITE may well have produced some mixed reviews, but I have to admit that having just seen it at my local multiplex theater, I found it a gripping enough experience although I was not particularly fond of the limp ending. The script should have provided a more satisfying conclusion.ANTHONY HOPKINS, manages to create a full-bodied character from some very thin material. Matching him every step of the way as a young priest who is beginning to have too many doubts about his faith is COLIN DONOGHUE. He holds his own in every scene with Hopkins, who gives his creepiest performance since ""Silence of the Lambs.""A major asset is the film's cinematography, especially for the scenes in and around Rome, and whether photographed in rain or shine. The film, in fact, owes a lot of its spellbinding power to the fantastic camerawork and the delicately haunting background score with its occasional uses of strong chords for shock value.But it's Hopkins who anchors the film with his very ambiguous portrait of a priest who specializes in exorcism. The main victim is a young girl and her scenes of Devil possession are strikingly handled for maximum effect, but decidedly more low-key than the startling effects in ""The Exorcist.""If you lean towards films about the paranormal or occult, handled with Gothic flourishes, you should find THE RITE a rewarding experience.

Well, for the most part my hopes were met.The movie is very well directed and put together in such a way that it just flows and it is quite entertaining to the viewer. Anthony Hopkins is actually kind of a funny character. Though the movie is quite serious, there were many parts, more in the beginning, which had my friends and I chuckling. Anthony Hopkins plays a great character, which is very devout, however doesn't seem to care anymore. He has a quite different approach to the whole exorcism thing than others do and this is why a Michael, a young student who is teetering on dropping out of seminary, is sent to visit Father Lucas. Michael doubts Father Lucas's motives and abilities. Michael is searching for a more scientific or medical evidence approach and less leaning towards religion.The movie is very entertaining and fun to watch. A few parts will make you jump and squirm in your seat, but in the end it is nothing out of the ordinary for an exorcist like film and uses too many clich&eacute;s. The acting is great and everyone works quite well together. Anthony Hopkins eventually starts to play a very creepy role and will freak you out.Picture quality is perfect. There are some light scenes and many dark scenes and all look great. The audio is amazing. There are many little creaks and moans from the surrounds and the sounds and dialogue is crystal clear.The extras were decent with the deleted scenes, however the Alternate Ending was the best part. The Alternate Ending should have been left in the film, as well as some of the deleted scenes, which greatly would have helped with character development and over-all interest in the film.Over-all I should have Netflix'd The Rite and waited until it dropped to the $10 bin, however I blind bought it and I am sticking with it. It was very entertaining and I will watch it again. The over simplified clich&eacute;s started to get annoying and almost took the scariness away from the whole exorcist thing. It almost makes it seem like it is not as big a deal as it really is. I hated that aspect of the film. If you rent or buy this make sure you watch the Alternate Ending and the deleted scenes. I wish they were in the film however they made me appreciate the film a little more. Based on the deleted scenes it seems as though someone (director, producers, writer) wanted this film to go a little deeper and in a different direction than the movie actually turn out.

But drat it, he owes too much on student loans. He is also a questioning rationalist who is unable to buy any of this 'God made the world in six day' hokum, so his superiors decide that sending him away to exorcism school in Rome for a few months will cure him of his skepticism. Sure it will..And I'm the pope.There amoungst the marble archways and impressive study halls, he goes to class like only three times or something and looks at slide shows of people who live at my local mission. He also learns the signs of possession which are, apathy, trembling limbs, knowledge of something that they shouldn't know, stink eye, yoga contortions, baggy eyelids, and a voice like Al Pacino's.Several times the film does a flash back into pretty boys past just to show that his father was a creepy mortician who traumatized him as a young boy with the embalmed corpse of his dead mother. In the car ride to the funeral, the boy glares in hatred at the dangling rear view mirror crucifix and bends the one he is holding behind his back when his mothers casket is being lowered into the ground. The part of the flash back that they left out was when he became a preteen goth and arm slicer.According to The Rite, in order to banish a demon you have to at first know the demons name. What the teachers forgot to tell pretty boy, is that you can only perform an exorcism in dingiest most ill lit room available. This was actually covered in the exorcism schools evening classes on Satanic Home Decorating Design. Unfortunately, pretty boy was too busy hop scotching around with Anthony Hopkins to go to any of his classes anyway.Pretty boys first hands on introduction to exorcism was in treating this rather flirtatious pregnant Italian chick who says things like 'Judas cross, and lickity split'. She also spreads her legs a lot while liking her lips like a porn star and saying the come on line of 'rape me'. I half expected Pretty boy to do a Leslie Neilson impersonation by suddenly undoing his priest collar and robe while delivering the line.""If it's this consensual, it's not rape.""There is also this possibly possessed little boy who speaks of seeing a red eyed mule, but like all little kids in The Rite, he is unceremoniously kicked to the curb like yesterdays news. I mean seriously, pretty boy and his (If I wasn't a celibate monk I would be getting it on with her) female side kick character go through all the trouble of exorcising a major demon out of Anthony Hopkins, and then just go on their merry way to live happily ever after. They just forget all about the little boy who is still seeing red eyed mule demons and getting the tar kicked out of him every night by them. The one thing you will come away with from The Rite, is that little children really do have it rough in this feature. If you don't believe me just ask the little girl that got back handed by Anthony Hopkins for having the nerve to ask him to bless her teddy bear.In the end, the exorcism of Anthony Hopkins turns into a comedy roast from hell. Anthony Hopkins transforms himself alright, into one part Hannibal Lecter and two parts Triumph The Insult Comic Dog. The real comedy clincher was having pretty boy stop being an atheist on a dime, only to fallow his heart so he can't be wrong. That's what did it folks, that's what saved the day in this film. One second pretty boy didn't believe in the 6,000 year old world story and Anthony Hopkins was all in his face doing 'The Linda Blair' thing, and then the next second, pretty boy had suddenly found his faith right next to his missing bic lighter and ball point pen. Just like that Anthony Hopkins was cured...'Lickity split' as the Italian pregnant chick had said.Now that I know how easy it is to change, I will never left a finger to do any actual real work towards self improvement ever again. I will believe in every diet fad and home exercise gimmick on the market before just taking a pill.

1398618,AQR22MPF45M3P,B004EPYZO4,Rachel Ford,"[0, 4]","I'm the type of viewer who can generally accept just about any initial premise for a film as long as one basic rule is followed: no matter how outrageous or silly the idea, do NOT try to explain it unless you can actually convince me - in other words, I'm willing to watch and enjoy things that can't happen so as long as you don't give me a terrible explanation of why the thing that can't happen can (a good explanation, of course, is even better, but not needed).The Rite failed that test. (Spoilers) The film follows a young man, Michael Kovak,  (Colin O'Donoghue) who is studying to become a priest, despite his absence of faith. He is sent by his mentor to exorcism school at the Vatican, in the hopes of rekindling that faith. When he starts making too much sense there - providing logical replies to everything the priest claims - he is sent to shadow a real-life exorcist, Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins). Like the exorcism teacher, Hopkins cannot rationally challenge anything his student can offer. Perhaps the most memorable line of the film is O'Donaghue's ... ""It's gets complicated when no proof of the devil is somehow proof of the devil."" At any rate, there are various encounters with people who are presumably possessed - or in need of mental health checkups - ending with the death of a young, pregnant woman. By now, Kovak is convinced that the devil is not real, and the exorcism business is a crock. Until the devil takes issue with his disbelief and decides to prove to him that he is in fact real (despite his ultimate goal being to stay hidden). Thus begins the possession of Father Lucas; and the eventual ""redemption"" of Kovak and defeat of the devil.The shining star of this film was the acting - all involved did a wonderful job. The script (aside from the plot) was good, as was most else...except for the story. That was laughable. Again, the premise - whether it's that demonic possession is a reality, or anything else - is fine; but offer me a ridiculous explanation, and you've lost anything you had going for you. Explaining the cure to demonic possession as the belief of and handiwork of a mortal who follows a god who is (obviously) too weak to rid the possessed of the devil himself is absurd. So too is the idea that demonic possession is the product of a lapse in belief in an all powerful, merciful god who relies on mortals to do his dirty work - a god who leaves the helpless to their fate, should a mortal man whose been to exorcism school not be around. In fact, the very idea of this all powerful and yet pathetically weak and useless god who relies on humankind to fight his battles for him is at the same time contradictory and idiotic. It is unfortunate that the film came to such a ridiculous conclusion...because, up until that point, it was decent enough. As it is, though, The Rite (especially with its claim to be based on true events) basically concludes that reason is irrelevant in the face of medieval superstition, and explains away the unbelievable by invoking religion.

Unfortunately, it falls flat on both.In a nutshell, a candidate for the priesthood (Colin O'Donoghue) who has faith issues (as well as a few other personal ones) is sent to exorcism school at the Vatican before he decides to give up the priesthood altogether.  His mentor in the intricacies of demonic possession is Father Lucas (admirably played by Anthony Hopkins).The movie adds nothing new to the debate about demonic possession vs mental instability and we, of course, get the requisite demonic possession antics: twisting in weird positions, speaking in a smoker's voice, the VERY tacky (and rather tired) practice by demons of pouncing on one's weak spots and spitting them back with unbridled ferocity, still the usual church attitude regarding exorcism as a necessary evil/dirty little secret despite the fact that the call for exorcisms has risen recently blah, blah, blah, concluding with the horrible Hollywood tactic of sewing up everything nice and neatly at the end with everyone living happily ever after.This is probably the movie's biggest fault (and the most insulting.) Perhaps if the audience had been allowed to decide for themselves just what choice the troubled priest-in-training made instead of deciding it for us, this alone would have dramatically improved the film.The performances, however, are actually quite good, especially that of Anthony Hopkins and Colin O'Donoghue and it is because of this, the film is not a total wash out.  Colin is most effective as the brooding (and festive) priest with doubts contrasted by the usually very strong performance by Hopkins in his element as a seasoned but troubled priest himself.

Has nobody ever told him that belief in devils is a Properly Basic Belief for which no evidence is required?There is also an instantly forgettable female journalist, and a few children who provide the typical ""look, I'm possessed"" stunts that about 90% of modern teenagers can probably do.  Add an unsurprising plot twist and a happy ending, and that's it.

The ""possessed"" people depicted undergo physical contortions, to be certain, but none beyond the capability of the human body i.e. no heads spinning around.  Therefore the viewer is still free to interpret the events as non-demonic psychological and/or physical phenomena.  Nevertheless, because of the degree of contortion and vocal changes, the viewer is led to ""believe"" that the unfortunate individuals in question are truly demon-possessed.As both the exorcist-supremo and ultimate victim, Hopkins does his usual good job.  Still this film misses the genuine creepiness that I suspect the directors hoped to create.It is interesting, however, to view the subject of present day ""demon possession"" and supposed exorcism in light of the history of the Roman Catholic Church.  Amazon offers a fascinating book, ""Malleus Malificarum"" [Hammer of Witches] which I have reviewed on Amazon.  It was written by two Catholic clerics and Inquisitors in the late 1400s and is an exhaustive study of how to identify--and punish--witches, warlocks and the demon-possessed.  Yes, demon possession was regarded as a terrible problem back in those days and the 'therapy' wasn't exorcism.  It was interrogation and oftentimes torture accompanied by burning at the stake.

In the book titled ""The Rite"", the lead characters were the reluctant exorcist trainee priest and the inquisitive and open-minded female journalist.After watching this movie the second time at around 2-3 AM in the morning of 8th August 2012, I decided to add another star rating to this review. I guess this story must be told in visual imagery since most modern folks seem too lazy to read books these days.Anthony Hopkins a great actor alright, but could do better if he had spent a little more time being a little more reverent in the actions of his priestly character. The movie would probably be best if it followed the storyline of the book. The graphics look realistic enough, not too many CGI embellishments.Colin O'Donoghue plays the skeptical trainee priest quite well.I immediately spotted two mistakes in this movie while watching it:(1) The script writers had Anthony Hopkins say in front of the young priest intraining: ""I absolve you of your error(s)."" This is erroneous. No Catholicpriest will say this because adherence to error is an act of will on the partof the sinner. A function of a priest in confession is to ""absolve you ofyour SINS in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.""Replace the word ""error"" with ""sin"" and the movie would have gotten it right.(2) The 2 lead actors were playing Roman Catholic priests, not from the EasternRite. The sign of the cross should be placed from left to right, not fromright to left as shown in this movie.Apart from those 2 errors in the movie, the rest of the scenes were OK. Some scenes were very moving and successfully reinforced the point that God and the supernatural world DO exist! If you believe the existence of evil (most people do), then you must automatically believe in the existence of the Ultimate Good, and vice versa.

He doesn't want to be an undertaker, so he joins the priesthood. After a four year free education, Michael decides he doesn't have faith and wants to opt out. He is informed if he doesn't become a priest, he will be billed for his education, about $100,000. He is then ""convinced"" to go to Rome to learn to become an exorcist, something he has even less faith about. In order to enhance Michael's faith, he is sent to see a priest who looks a lot like Hannibal Lecter. Father Lecter (Lucus) is performing his daily exorcism on a very pregnant 16 year old girl. She says things to Michael that only Michael would know, proof she is possessed by the Amazing Kreskin, or some demon. The girl snarls, rolls around on the floor, does a contortion act during the exorcist, which was ineffective in Latin, but worked better in English, God's native tongue. It soon becomes apparent that the devil is after Michael, but it is confusing as the theme is that the devil doesn't want us to believe he exists by going out of his way to convince us that he does. Father Lucus makes house calls as it appears possession is 9/10ths of Rome.Michael also meets a female reporter who he confides in about his doubt and experiences.

1398639,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B004EPYZO4,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","""The Rite"" had a terrific coming-attraction playing on TV the week before the movie's theatrical release.  Anthony Hopkins was prominently featured with an assortment of creepy expressions, and quick cuts showed a woman contorting her body, the horrified reaction of a young priest, and some shots of Rome.  With Hopkins' star power and a dramatic plot involving humans possessed by the devil, this looked like, finally, a good, old-fashioned horror film geared to scare the wits out of an audience.Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) has just finished four years of seminary school and is on the verge of taking his final vows, but has issues with his own faith.  When the Pope sends down an edict requiring every diocese to have a resident exorcist, Michael's superiors see this as an opportunity to show him the power of faith.  They send him to Rome for a two-month intensive course to prepare him for the role.In Rome, he is introduced to Father Lucas, an elderly priest currently attempting to exorcise evil from a 16-year-old girl who was impregnated by her father.  When Michael witnesses one session, with the girl flailing, twisting her body, and speaking English (a language she doesn't know), he is convinced mental illness is at the root of the girl's behavior.The rest of the movie is a philosophical dialogue on the presence of the devil in the modern world and how the devil is empowered by people's disbelief in him.  Hopkins is given plenty of opportunity to ham it up, channeling his Hannibal Lecter character and turning Father Lucas into the antithesis of what we believe an exorcist should be.  He's glib, tosses out one-liners, takes cell phone calls in the midst of an exorcism, makes joking references to scenes in a famous horror film, and treats his job with a laid back manner, with occasional outbursts, in the never ending battle of Good and Evil.The audience approaches a movie about possession with certain expectations.  We've seen a myriad of possession films, from ""Child's Play,"" in which a doll absorbs the personality and modus operandi of a murderer, to ""The Omen,"" in which the cherub-faced spawn of the devil goes on a killing spree to insinuate himself into a position of power.  What these films have in common is action, and plenty of it -- a feature blatantly absent in ""The Rite,"" which is far too tame.  The primary problem is the film's fence-balancing PG-13 rating, which doesn't allow for intense content, graphic visuals, or strong language.  In other words, this is a possession film for those who think they're too scary.Director Mikael Hafstrom is not great with pacing.  At 114 minutes, the movie drags considerably and never has a payoff worth waiting for.  It's sort of like having field seats to the seventh game of the World Series and having the umpires call the game a tie.  Totally unacceptable.We already know that Hopkins, given solid material, can be wonderful, but with mediocre stuff like ""The Rite,"" he compensates for drama on the page with histrionics, nervous tics, and ominous stares.  Scares are the easy kind -- an unseen cat suddenly jumping into frame and meowing, loud musical chords that attempt to amp up the tepid ""shock"" moments, and a camera that dances all over the place, trying to pick out an angle that will make the viewer shudder.Colin O'Donoghue, who makes his screen debut in ""The Rite,"" is adequate and manages to make his Michael Kovak sympathetic, but he becomes practically invisible as Hopkins upstages their every scene together.If you're in the mood for a superior film about possession, rent ""The Exorcist"" and see it done right.

It does not, however, but one event makes him hang on to the faith he was almost ready to wash his hands of. Further, one priest decides that this person would make a good candidate for something new - a program of sorts. Exorist; something the church has decided it needs more of. The problem is that faith does not return that easily and that the priest is given an assignment to hang with another, older exorist and this leads to questions about many things. Amongst those is one thqat borders on a teen girl and the demon he says lives inside of her.Is it really real?The whole possession subgenre had suffered as of late, having few movies to truly hang its hat on. That was one of the reasons that this movie really made an impact, and why it was great to see a star like Anothy hopkins enter the ring. From the beginning you really wondered what, if anything, was happening to the main characters and if the ideas were being fed by over-zealous people or by truly hideous crimes. Making things better was the fact that the acting hid everything and that moments in the film really clouded the outcome. There were times when I thought that a slight-of-hand was happening and there were times when I thought that dreams were too strange to be real. This was countered by the teen and some of her comments, and by what seemed to be speaking through her. It had me on the fence.I personally liked that because movies have problems standing this way. And when the answer comes it seems great - and better if you have some nice speal effects playing off every moment.There are a lot of horror movies out there and a lot of things might seem to pull a person away from a movie like this. I was honestly surpised when I saw it being released, and I was not really thrilled about it - at first. Then I saw it and I liked it, thinking it would lose out only because it did not have a lot of hype and that the movies had hurt this because of how bad some were. Its sad to think that, but its even sadder when it is true.Fans of the horror genre should enjoy this. Fans of Hopkins might also enjoy this.

1398643,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004EPYZO4,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 14]","Don't expect a horror film here. The subject matter of a new Anthony Hopkins film is Catholic exorcism, but, as his character Father Lucas Trevan says, you are not going to see pea soup in ""The Rite."" The film opens with the all-too-familiar ""inspired by true events"" announcement, and it seems the filmmakers mean it.A young seminary student Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue), undetermined as to his future, is sent to a new training course for exorcism in the Vatican. Contrary to what most of us would expect, the class does not look much different with very modern teaching equipment.There, Father Xavier (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), a lecturer of the course, suggests that Michael meet Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins), a hermit-like priest living with cats, performing an exorcism on a pregnant girl..Director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m takes an interesting approach to the subgenre of exorcism with more believable situations and characters. We are not perfectly sure Father Lucas is really a reliable person. Michael, who is losing his faith, remains skeptic about him naturally. Despite the obvious flaws - overlong introduction wasting Rutger Hauer as Michael's mortician father, an underwritten role for Alice Braga and the film's overall slow pace - his approach works pretty well, with some interesting details. (During his exorcism, Father Lucas receives a call on his cell phone and he takes it.)Unfortunately, in the second half the film takes a different course, which is a more conventional one. Without spoiling much, I can say we have seen a similar storyline before in a much better film. Anthony Hopkins delivers his over-the-top acting (which I enjoyed), overshadowing Colin O'Donoghue's weak performance.""The Rite"" is not a terrible film. It offers an intriguing premise with a unique (some say realistic) views of exorcism, which is refreshing to see.

1398647,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B004EPYZO4,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[9, 10]","The Rite promised to be good cheesy fun if nothing else but the film is little more than a puzzle with all the right pieces put together by a blind person; it has all the right pieces but none of them are in order and the person organizing them has no idea what they SHOULD look like. Essentially The Rite is a remake of ""The Exorcist"" with a director that has no ability to make us see the horror hiding in the ordinary world and, well, without pea soup.Priest Michael Kovak  (Colin O'Donoghue)hasn't taken his final vows and has sent a letter to his advisor Father Mathew (Toby Jones) resigning because he feels he doesn't have the faith necessary to do the job. So Father Mathew responds by sending Kovak for exorcist training in Rome.  It seems the church wants to have an exorcist in key areas because of the rise of complaints about demonic possession. His trainer Father Xavier (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) recommends that Kovak who believes most people requiring an exorcism require psychological help because they aren't possessed by a demon spent time with Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins) the leading living exorcist to assist him and learn from him. Trevant shows Kovak otherwise and when Trevant becomes possessed he must rely on Kovak to exorcise him.Based on Father Gary Thomas' training as an exorcist and the book by journalist Matt Baglio who ended up chronicling Thomas' journey from priest to exorcist in his book The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist, the film tackles the same themes as William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty's film (and Blatty's novel of the same name itself inspired by true events as this film claims to be)and even takes a somewhat similar approach to the material without any of the tension, power or influence of Friedkin's classic film.The problem isn't that we've see everything in The Rite before (we have) but that we've seen it done better; there's nothing new brought to the table. Heck, I'm surprised that Warner wasn't tempted to label this as a sequel of sorts to The Exorcist as it would have attracted more people to its theatrical showing. The film performed dismally at the box office grossing $33 million and that's no surprise. With a PG-13 rating there's not much the director could do to construct a horror film that balanced drama with gross out effects to attract modern audiences. It also meant that director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m (1408) didn't get the chance to make the film he probably wanted to--an edgy horror film that continues to examine the role of faith in a modern society beset by evil all around. All the film had was Anthony Hopkins who plays weird old guys really well and his role here was to act kind of crazy or, at the very least, inscrutable. While Hopkins is a terrific actor with the right material he isn't given anything to truly sink his teeth into here and without crossing the line into cheesy, the film has nothing else going for it. It plays like a TV movie knock off that we might have seen on the illiterately titled Syfy Channel.The Rite looks decent on Blu-ray but with a bit rate hovering around 22 on average, it could look quite a bit better. Night scenes are a bit murky looking although detail and color appear solid enough. Still, the overall transfer for a film this new isn't all that great considering how new it is.Audio sounds quite nice with a richly detailed 5.1 mix although most of the activity is in the front end less in the surround speakers.The copy that I purchased blindly (a mistake I'll admit) is the single disc edition of the film. It includes deleted scenes but nothing else which should give those of you interested in the film an idea as to how well Warner regarded the film. There is a deluxe edition that features a DVD as well as an alternate ending and a featurette on the priest that inspired the film but neither one has a commentary track.Unfortunately this film doesn't have The Rite stuff when it comes to scaring people. It also doesn't offer anything new. The drama is only mildly interesting and while Hopkins does the best with the material he's given, he isn't the real star here--that is O'Donoghue --  and there isn't enough screen time devoted to him in the film (he doesn't appear until 25 minutes into the movie). Hopkins may have taken the role in The Rite for a paycheck unfortunately his performance doesn't pay off in a film that doesn't scare nor does it bring anything new to the table.",2,Doesn't have The Rite Stuff,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,4441,"['Rite', 'promised', 'be', 'good', 'cheesy', 'fun', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'puzzle', 'right', 'pieces', 'put', 'together', 'blind', 'person', 'right', 'pieces', 'none', 'are', 'order', 'person', 'organizing', 'idea', 'what', 'SHOULD', 'look', 'Essentially', 'Rite', 'remake', 'Exorcist', 'director', 'ability', 'make', 'see', 'horror', 'hiding', 'ordinary', 'world', 'well', 'pea', 'soup.Priest', 'Michael', 'Kovak', 'Colin', ""O'Donoghue"", ""n't"", 'taken', 'final', 'vows', 'sent', 'letter', 'advisor', 'Father', 'Mathew', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'resigning', ""n't"", 'have', 'faith', 'necessary', 'do', 'job', 'So', 'Father', 'Mathew', 'sending', 'Kovak', 'exorcist', 'training', 'Rome', 'church', 'have', 'exorcist', 'key', 'areas', 'rise', 'complaints', 'demonic', 'possession', 'trainer', 'Father', 'Xavier', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'Kovak', 'who', 'most', 'people', 'requiring', 'exorcism', 'require', 'psychological', 'help', 'are', ""n't"", 'possessed', 'demon', 'spent', 'time', 'Father', 'Lucas', 'Trevant', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'leading', 'living', 'exorcist', 'assist', 'learn', 'Trevant', 'Kovak', 'otherwise', 'when', 'Trevant', 'possessed', 'must', 'rely', 'Kovak', 'exorcise', 'him.Based', 'Father', 'Gary', 'Thomas', 'training', 'exorcist', 'book', 'journalist', 'Matt', 'Baglio', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'chronicling', 'Thomas', 'journey', 'priest', 'exorcist', 'book', 'Rite', 'Making', 'Modern', 'Exorcist', 'film', 'same', 'themes', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'William', 'Peter', 'Blatty', 'film', 'Blatty', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'film', 'be', 'even', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'approach', 'material', 'tension', 'power', 'influence', 'Friedkin', 'classic', 'film.The', 'problem', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'see', 'everything', 'Rite', 'have', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'nothing', 'new', 'brought', 'table', 'Heck', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Warner', 'was', ""n't"", 'tempted', 'label', 'sequel', 'sorts', 'Exorcist', 'would', 'have', 'attracted', 'more', 'people', 'theatrical', 'showing', 'film', 'performed', 'dismally', 'box', 'office', 'grossing', '33', 'million', 'surprise', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'not', 'much', 'director', 'could', 'do', 'construct', 'horror', 'film', 'balanced', 'drama', 'gross', 'out', 'effects', 'attract', 'modern', 'audiences', 'also', 'meant', 'director', 'Mikael', 'Hfstr', 'ouml', '1408', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'make', 'film', 'probably', 'wanted', 'edgy', 'horror', 'film', 'examine', 'role', 'faith', 'modern', 'society', 'beset', 'evil', 'film', 'had', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'weird', 'old', 'guys', 'really', 'well', 'role', 'here', 'was', 'act', 'kind', 'crazy', 'very', 'least', 'inscrutable', 'Hopkins', 'terrific', 'actor', 'right', 'material', ""n't"", 'given', 'anything', 'truly', 'sink', 'teeth', 'here', 'crossing', 'line', 'cheesy', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'going', 'TV', 'movie', 'knock', 'off', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'illiterately', 'titled', 'Syfy', 'Channel.The', 'Rite', 'decent', 'Blu-ray', 'bit', 'rate', 'hovering', 'around', '22', 'average', 'could', 'look', 'quite', 'bit', 'better', 'Night', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'murky', 'looking', 'detail', 'color', 'appear', 'solid', 'enough', 'Still', 'overall', 'transfer', 'film', 'new', ""n't"", 'great', 'considering', 'how', 'new', 'is.Audio', 'quite', 'nice', 'richly', 'detailed', '5.1', 'mix', 'most', 'activity', 'front', 'end', 'less', 'surround', 'speakers.The', 'copy', 'purchased', 'blindly', 'mistake', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'else', 'should', 'give', 'interested', 'film', 'idea', 'how', 'well', 'Warner', 'regarded', 'film', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'alternate', 'ending', 'featurette', 'priest', 'inspired', 'film', 'one', 'commentary', 'track.Unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'Rite', 'stuff', 'when', 'scaring', 'people', 'also', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'drama', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'Hopkins', 'best', 'material', 'given', ""n't"", 'real', 'star', 'here', ""O'Donoghue"", ""n't"", 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'devoted', 'film', ""n't"", 'appear', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Hopkins', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'role', 'Rite', 'paycheck', 'unfortunately', 'performance', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'film', ""n't"", 'scare', 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'table']",N/A
