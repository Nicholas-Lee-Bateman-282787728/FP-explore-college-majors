Elwes eventually gets a real life testing of the Bradley.  This movie is so funny it can be taken as serious action/drama movie , yet  it's a comedy too!

It was satirical and darkly funny, and even a little worrisome that events such as what is shown could be happening inside the halls of the Pentagon, but I'm just a civilian without much inside knowledge.On that note, the movie was based on real events. It is a story about the latter stages of development of the Bradley armored vehicle which was featured in the Gulf War and Air Force Officer, Colonel James Burton, whose task, by Congressional edict, was to sign off on the final testing of the vehicle. Without his approval the Bradley could not go into production. What he finds out is that what would make great fiction happens every day within the ranks of the higher-ups in the military. The General, overseeing the production of the Bradley, is constantly trying to pull the wool over the Colonel's eyes to get the Bradley into production.Now as another note, this film has a lot of 'Hollywood' moments. I would very much doubt that high ranking officials - at least I hope so - would never try to push through a death trap as the Bradley is shown in the movie or that a General would be so contemptuous towards Congress as the General played by Kelsey Grammer shows himself to be.But take it with a grain of salt or sugar and think of it as the comedy with a dark, but not too dark, message.

The story is about the almost incredibly prolonged and massively costly development of the not-very-good Bradley fighting vehicle.  It's not as much of a deathtrap as a Humm-Vee, but it still cost far too much money to develop, and the end result is the product of a series of compromises designed to fit the whims of whichever bunch of generals happened to be responsible for deciding what it should be for at any given time.The Bradley is in service in Iraq and the best thing that can be said about it is that in the first Gulf War, it destroyed more Iraqi armoured vehicles than the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank - which in turn doesn't say very much for the Abrams.  In the current war, it has proven to be vulnerable to guerrilla tactics, such as attacks by individuals armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers.  It is not nearly as good as it could have been, and this film is an only lightly fictionalised version of how American soldiers came to be going into battle in an expensive and not very good vehicle.  (Compare the Israeli Merkava tank, designed with the emphasis not on lots of groovy features but on crew survivability.)It's a funny film, with fine work by Cary Elwes and a pre-West Wing Richard Schiff, with also some top-grade scenery chewing by Kelsey Grammar.  But it's also depressing.  Military incompetence is alive and well, and it's dwelling at the heart of the US military right now.

G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[2, 2]","HBO Films has turned out a lot of films worth owning in its time - AND THE BAND PLAYED ON, CONSPIRACY, WHEN TRUMPETS FADE, BARBARIANS AT THE GATE - and this movie definitely stands in that company. It's a witty, well-written, well-acted movie that takes a big swing at the greed, stupidity, arrogance and corruption that festers at the heart of our military-industrial complex...and if it doesn't knock the ball clean over the fence, it's good for an in-the-park home run.THE PENTAGON WARS is the fictionalized-but-mostly-true story of Lt. Col. James Burton (Cary Elwes), an up-and-coming young Air Force officer assigned to the Pentagon to serve as an independent evaluator for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, which at the time story takes place (the earlyish 1980s) had already been in development for something like 17 years. Elwes is quickly introduced to his blustering, pompous boss, General Partridge (Kelsey Grammer), who presents the Bradely as a fait accompli and implies that Burton's job is to look busy and do nothing. Burton doesn't take the hint, and tries mightily to learn everything he can about the Bradley, only to discover that Partridge's minions Col. Bock (John C. McGinley) and Major Sayers (Tom Wright) are stonewalling him at every turn - it turns out, with good reason. The Bradley, which is about to go into mass production, is actually a death trap that has been protected at every stage from the sort of tests which would have exposed its many weaknesses. Why? Because of the cozy relationship between the Pentagon brass and the defense contractors. The generals endorse expensive weapons systems that don't work, and in return, get awarded cushy, lucrative private-sector jobs upon their retirement. It's a terrific system...so long as there's no war. ""I always knew the Pentagon was about cash flows and egos,"" he laments. ""But I always thought that when it came down to it, the men came first.""Just how wrong Burton is he discovers when, emboldened by documents handed to him by a ""Deep Throat"" within the Pentagon (Richard Schiff) he pushes for live-fire testing, and discovers that not only has the Bradley been protected, all the previous testing has been faked, by such devious means as using shells loaded with sand, filling the gas tanks of the vehicle with water instead of gasoline, and rewriting negative reports using language so confusing that nobody can understand it. When, after a brutal bureacratic struggle, during which Burton is forced to engage in a lot of cloak-and-dagger shennanigans and endure the wrath of his superiors, he finally gets the tests he asks for, the results are...explosive.THE PENTAGON WARS combines serious dramatic elements with wry cynicism, black humor and not a little farce. The sequences where Burton chases a truckload of dead sheep across a military base, where Col. Bock kicks dirt on him like an enraged baseball manager, or where hot plates are placed all over a vehicle to help guide an infared missle to the target, are all right out of M*A*S*H. It is probably a bit unfair to the military (the role that Congress plays in this sort of sordid backroom dealmaking is deliberately ignored), but in the end, its heart is in the right place.

42589,A5QE86H97FDJA,0783112645,Mynameisthis,"[15, 37]","No question there were alot of funny moments in this film based on the book by Col. Burton but as you can easily guess, if it's an HBO film, there will be more fiction than fact.Here's some info from a military analyst who saw the film:&quot;1) How accurate was the movie?Not at all.  I was driven to take notes after the first few minutes and got over sixty substantive errors.  The producers took Col. Burton's simplistic but compelling memoir, dumbed it down, took dramatic licence with a lot of things that didn't need it, goofed around with the chronology, and apparently had a head-on collision with an office full of libel lawyers who demanded even more blurring than there already was. Theresult is a mockery both of the very real issues surrounding the Bradley and of Burton's very genuine display of moral courage.I'd say it was also a piss-poor excuse for a comedy, but I'm a military historian, not a movie critic.2) What were the actual problems with the Bradley and how were they resolved?Most of the actual problems with the Bradley - aside from mechanical teething problems that any armored vehicle has - arose from the fact that no one really had a clear idea of what an infantry fighting vehicle was supposed to do at the time the project was started in 1964 - it wasn't even called that at the time; all that was really clear was that current armored personnel carriers and armored infantry doctrine weren't going to be well-suited to the armor-rich, artillery-rich, and likely nuclear/biological/chemical battlefield environment expected in a putative European war versus the Warsaw Pact.This uncertainty led to incredible amounts of bureaucratic muddle and intraservice chest-thumping within the Army - the movie version of _The Pentagon Wars_ at least manages to get a little of that across, in spirit, anyway - and kept the project on the back burner all through Vietnam, when the Army wasn't paying a lot of attention to mechanized infantry issuesanyway.  This problem was exacerbated by a parallel muddle on the armor side of the service, which had repeatedly failed to field a satisfactory vehicle for its armored cavalry units.By this time (~1975) both branches were faced with block obsolescence of their existing vehicles, so they had to meld their requirements into what was essentially a single vehicle, which became the Bradley. Incorporating all the necessary capabilities into a single chassis that had originallybeen built to tight dimensional limits due to rather questionable airportability concerns and an equally questionable requirement for amphibious capability required a lot of tradeoffs that didn't satisfy purists very much.How were these problems dealt with?  A number of ways.  Some of them were doctrinal: the Army looked for ways to exploit the capabilities of the vehicle and nurse its limitations.  Some were technological: in particular, various survivability enhancements were added at a cost in weight and money.  Some were simply bureaucratically defined out of existence.  How successful these measures has been is still the subject of debate, some of it in this very newsgroup; see Deja News fordetails.For that matter &lt;ahem&gt; you can also see W. Blair Haworth, Jr., _The Bradley and how it got that way: mechanized infantry organization and equipment in the U.S. Army_ (unpub diss, Duke University, 1995; available through UMI)3) Did any Bradley's sustain hits from enemy fire in the Gulf war and how did they and the crew survive those hits?It's a hard question to answer meaningfully; BFVs of various marks served in the theater, and a good number were hit in combat, often by weapons and at aspects that wouldn't be survivable by main battle tanks - Bradleys took more friendly fire than any other vehicle type. In general, they stood up to what they were designed to stand up to; the debate is still whether the design requirements were appropriate.&quot;Lastly, anyone that would try and draw a correlation between the BFV and a national missile defense system would find themselves comparing apples to oranges since we had an accurate and functional ABM system for a number of years until eliminated by the ABM treaty.",2,"Funny, but not accurate",1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,4187,"['question', 'were', 'alot', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Col.', 'Burton', 'can', 'easily', 'guess', 'HBO', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'fiction', 'info', 'military', 'analyst', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'quot', '1', 'How', 'accurate', 'was', 'movie', 'Not', 'was', 'driven', 'take', 'notes', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'got', 'sixty', 'substantive', 'errors', 'producers', 'took', 'Col.', 'Burton', 'simplistic', 'compelling', 'memoir', 'dumbed', 'down', 'took', 'dramatic', 'licence', 'lot', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'chronology', 'apparently', 'had', 'head-on', 'collision', 'office', 'full', 'libel', 'lawyers', 'who', 'demanded', 'even', 'more', 'blurring', 'already', 'was', 'Theresult', 'mockery', 'very', 'real', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'Bradley', 'Burton', 'very', 'genuine', 'display', 'moral', 'courage.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'also', 'piss-poor', 'excuse', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'military', 'historian', 'not', 'movie', 'critic.2', 'What', 'were', 'actual', 'problems', 'Bradley', 'how', 'were', 'resolved', 'Most', 'actual', 'problems', 'Bradley', 'aside', 'mechanical', 'teething', 'problems', 'armored', 'vehicle', 'arose', 'fact', 'one', 'really', 'had', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'infantry', 'fighting', 'vehicle', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'time', 'project', 'was', 'started', '1964', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'called', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'clear', 'was', 'current', 'armored', 'personnel', 'carriers', 'armored', 'infantry', 'doctrine', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'well-suited', 'armor-rich', 'artillery-rich', 'likely', 'nuclear/biological/chemical', 'battlefield', 'environment', 'expected', 'putative', 'European', 'war', 'Warsaw', 'Pact.This', 'uncertainty', 'led', 'incredible', 'amounts', 'bureaucratic', 'muddle', 'intraservice', 'chest-thumping', 'Army', 'movie', 'version', '_The', 'Pentagon', 'Wars_', 'least', 'manages', 'get', 'little', 'across', 'spirit', 'anyway', 'kept', 'project', 'back', 'burner', 'Vietnam', 'when', 'Army', 'was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'lot', 'attention', 'mechanized', 'infantry', 'issuesanyway', 'problem', 'was', 'exacerbated', 'parallel', 'muddle', 'armor', 'side', 'service', 'had', 'repeatedly', 'failed', 'field', 'satisfactory', 'vehicle', 'armored', 'cavalry', 'time', '~1975', 'branches', 'were', 'faced', 'block', 'obsolescence', 'existing', 'vehicles', 'had', 'meld', 'requirements', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'single', 'vehicle', 'became', 'Bradley', 'Incorporating', 'necessary', 'capabilities', 'single', 'chassis', 'had', 'originallybeen', 'built', 'tight', 'dimensional', 'limits', 'due', 'rather', 'questionable', 'airportability', 'concerns', 'equally', 'questionable', 'requirement', 'amphibious', 'capability', 'required', 'lot', 'tradeoffs', 'did', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'purists', 'very', 'much.How', 'were', 'problems', 'dealt', 'number', 'ways', 'were', 'doctrinal', 'Army', 'looked', 'ways', 'exploit', 'capabilities', 'vehicle', 'nurse', 'limitations', 'were', 'technological', 'particular', 'various', 'survivability', 'enhancements', 'were', 'added', 'cost', 'weight', 'money', 'were', 'simply', 'bureaucratically', 'defined', 'existence', 'How', 'successful', 'measures', 'been', 'still', 'subject', 'debate', 'very', 'newsgroup', 'see', 'Deja', 'News', 'fordetails.For', 'matter', 'lt', 'gt', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'W.', 'Blair', 'Haworth', 'Jr.', '_The', 'Bradley', 'how', 'got', 'way', 'mechanized', 'infantry', 'organization', 'equipment', 'U.S.', 'Army_', 'unpub', 'diss', 'Duke', 'University', '1995', 'available', 'UMI', '3', 'Did', 'Bradley', 'sustain', 'hits', 'enemy', 'fire', 'Gulf', 'war', 'how', 'did', 'crew', 'survive', 'hits', 'hard', 'question', 'answer', 'meaningfully', 'BFVs', 'various', 'marks', 'served', 'theater', 'good', 'number', 'were', 'hit', 'combat', 'often', 'weapons', 'aspects', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'survivable', 'main', 'battle', 'tanks', 'Bradleys', 'took', 'more', 'friendly', 'fire', 'other', 'vehicle', 'type', 'general', 'stood', 'up', 'what', 'were', 'designed', 'stand', 'up', 'debate', 'still', 'design', 'requirements', 'were', 'appropriate.', 'quot', 'Lastly', 'anyone', 'would', 'try', 'draw', 'correlation', 'BFV', 'national', 'missile', 'defense', 'system', 'would', 'find', 'comparing', 'apples', 'oranges', 'had', 'accurate', 'functional', 'ABM', 'system', 'number', 'years', 'eliminated', 'ABM', 'treaty']",N/A

42591,A1DE6049MCZ3CE,0783112645,Roy Gordon,"[50, 52]","This movie was a real surprise.  I rented it on vacation when neither my son, my wife, nor myself could agree.  I just saw that Olympia Dukakis and Richard Benjamin were in it and he directed.  And, it was a comedy.But this film is the blackest of comedies.  And the very scenes that were the most hilarious were also those that engendered outrage in me, gradually at first, and then with a rushing forward.It is the true story of the latter stages of development of the Bradley armoured vehicle which was featured in the Gulf War, and the Air Force officer, James Burton, whose task, by Congressional edict, was to sign off on the final testing of the vehicle.  Without his approval the Bradley could not go into production.The film is based on his book.What he discovered was that the Bradley's design had evolved from a fast troop transport to a mish-mash of everything, making it unsuitable for each of its now numerous and contradictory roles.Worse, however, was that the vehicle was an obvious death trap.  If the paper-thin armour didn't get you, then the poisonous fumes would.  And if they didn't do it, then the exploding of the vehicle's gas tank would finish off the job.The army would not test the vehicle, except for those that they rigged--knowing full well what the results would be.  Israel bought some, but seeing right off the bat that the vehicle as designed was a death trap, insisted on modifications.So, there were two production lines: one for the Israeli version and one for the death trap US version: produced by its own country with the knowing enthusiasm and approval of military brass.Contractor production of sub-standard military equipment is a very old story.  Nothing new here.  But what infuriated the officer was that here was the US Military knowingly trying to push through a vehicle that was an obvious tomb for American soldiers.Well, this sounds (and is) pretty grim.  But the film is played primarily as comedy.  Obviously very black comedy, but still comedy.The general and leader of the project is Kelsey Grammar.  The questioning Congressional chairperson is Olympia Dukakis, and Richard Benjamin is Caspar Weinberger, Reagan's secretary of defense.  He's always finding out the bad news from the morning's Washington Post since all his military people are just blandly reassuring him that it's all proceeding grandly: not a single glitch in the project.The light tone and jaunty pace keep the film moving along.  The villains not quite verge on buffoonery.  Grammer is obviously completely disdainful of the Congress people and their questioning, yet reining it in so he can (almost) appear to take them seriously, so they'll go away.I would have prefered it if Grammer had been more restrained and a bit more subtle about it.  The generals we see at hearings on TV are much more straight-faced.  But perhaps it wouldn't have been possible to keep the tone of the film nor to exhibit their disdain nor to make plausible the supposedly true incidents, each new one more ludicrous and implausible than the one before.As the film ended I was very upset.  I'm not at all hawkish in my politics.  But I do believe that when we commit Americans to fight that they should have equipment that serves them the best.  I was laughing as the film proceeded as one outrageous and hilarous incident succeeded another.  I did want to know whether the &quot;Office of Ruminant Procurement&quot; really did come into existence or was it Hollywood taking liberties with the text.As with Colonel Burton, though, the knowledge that US brass would push enthusiastically for a death trap vehicle is a bit much for me.",5,Hilarious but soberly outrageous--often simultaneously,981676800,"02 9, 2001",2001,3640,"['movie', 'was', 'real', 'surprise', 'rented', 'vacation', 'when', 'son', 'wife', 'could', 'agree', 'just', 'saw', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'were', 'directed', 'was', 'comedy.But', 'film', 'blackest', 'comedies', 'very', 'scenes', 'were', 'most', 'hilarious', 'were', 'also', 'engendered', 'outrage', 'gradually', 'first', 'then', 'rushing', 'forward.It', 'true', 'story', 'latter', 'stages', 'development', 'Bradley', 'armoured', 'vehicle', 'was', 'featured', 'Gulf', 'War', 'Air', 'Force', 'officer', 'James', 'Burton', 'task', 'Congressional', 'edict', 'was', 'sign', 'off', 'final', 'testing', 'vehicle', 'approval', 'Bradley', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'production.The', 'film', 'based', 'book.What', 'discovered', 'was', 'Bradley', 'design', 'had', 'evolved', 'fast', 'troop', 'transport', 'mish-mash', 'everything', 'making', 'unsuitable', 'now', 'numerous', 'contradictory', 'roles.Worse', 'however', 'was', 'vehicle', 'was', 'obvious', 'death', 'trap', 'paper-thin', 'armour', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'then', 'poisonous', 'fumes', 'would', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'then', 'exploding', 'vehicle', 'gas', 'tank', 'would', 'finish', 'off', 'job.The', 'army', 'would', 'not', 'test', 'vehicle', 'rigged', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'what', 'results', 'would', 'be', 'Israel', 'bought', 'seeing', 'right', 'bat', 'vehicle', 'designed', 'was', 'death', 'trap', 'insisted', 'modifications.So', 'were', 'two', 'production', 'lines', 'one', 'Israeli', 'version', 'one', 'death', 'trap', 'US', 'version', 'produced', 'own', 'country', 'knowing', 'enthusiasm', 'approval', 'military', 'brass.Contractor', 'production', 'sub-standard', 'military', 'equipment', 'very', 'old', 'story', 'Nothing', 'new', 'here', 'what', 'infuriated', 'officer', 'was', 'here', 'was', 'US', 'Military', 'knowingly', 'trying', 'push', 'vehicle', 'was', 'obvious', 'tomb', 'American', 'soldiers.Well', 'pretty', 'grim', 'film', 'played', 'primarily', 'comedy', 'Obviously', 'very', 'black', 'comedy', 'still', 'comedy.The', 'general', 'leader', 'project', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'questioning', 'Congressional', 'chairperson', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'Caspar', 'Weinberger', 'Reagan', 'secretary', 'defense', 'always', 'finding', 'out', 'bad', 'news', 'morning', 'Washington', 'Post', 'military', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'blandly', 'reassuring', 'proceeding', 'grandly', 'not', 'single', 'glitch', 'project.The', 'light', 'tone', 'jaunty', 'pace', 'keep', 'film', 'moving', 'along', 'villains', 'not', 'quite', 'verge', 'buffoonery', 'Grammer', 'obviously', 'completely', 'disdainful', 'Congress', 'people', 'questioning', 'yet', 'reining', 'can', 'almost', 'appear', 'take', 'seriously', ""'ll"", 'go', 'away.I', 'would', 'have', 'prefered', 'Grammer', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'restrained', 'bit', 'more', 'subtle', 'generals', 'see', 'hearings', 'TV', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'straight-faced', 'perhaps', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'keep', 'tone', 'film', 'exhibit', 'disdain', 'make', 'plausible', 'supposedly', 'true', 'incidents', 'new', 'one', 'more', 'ludicrous', 'implausible', 'one', 'before.As', 'film', 'ended', 'was', 'very', 'upset', ""'m"", 'not', 'hawkish', 'politics', 'do', 'believe', 'when', 'commit', 'Americans', 'fight', 'should', 'have', 'equipment', 'best', 'was', 'laughing', 'film', 'proceeded', 'one', 'outrageous', 'hilarous', 'incident', 'succeeded', 'did', 'want', 'know', 'quot', 'Office', 'Ruminant', 'Procurement', 'quot', 'really', 'did', 'come', 'existence', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'taking', 'liberties', 'text.As', 'Colonel', 'Burton', 'though', 'knowledge', 'US', 'brass', 'would', 'push', 'enthusiastically', 'death', 'trap', 'vehicle', 'bit', 'much']",N/A

The film shows the exact same PR tactics and lying ""spin"" the Army and DoD use to put people second and their programs/promotions first. The depiction of how the Army will cheat on tests to masquerade that ""all is well"" with a program is common as seen by the recent efforts to deceive the public by flying overweight lav3strykers a short distance by C-130 aircraft with less fuel inside to compensate--exactly how in the movie the Bradley's fuel tanks were filled just with the minimum fuel to drive in front of the audience grandstands and to the aim point for the test anti-tank weapon to hit it.The tragedy is that after 2 decades, the Army today is rushing the lav3stryker deathtrap into production without ANY live-fire testing against fully fueled and ammo loaded vehicles fired at by RPGs or 14.5mm heavy machine guns thanks to a loophole in DoD procurement. Too bad Colonel Burton wasn't on duty now in the Pentagon.

This movie tells the tale of a military colonel (Cary Elwes) who is put in charge of a Pentagon project to build a new tank. Elwes is the most recent in a long line of men who have overseen this boondoggle since 1968. Kelsey Grammar plays the General who just wants the damn thing built despite any problems that it may have. He forces his underlings to falsify test results and even tries to get Elwes fired. Schiff, who has a fair amount of screen time, plays the original project director who never fought against the big guns, but still opposes the tank because of its design flaws. He helps Elwes get to the truth.
