I wish movie makers & those responsible for getting the movies released on DVD would remember that sometimes films have wings beyond the box office & they still have fans that love them. hope ya caught my wings reference lol, that said it's really a 4 and a half star movie, but I'm rating the DVD not the movie itself. last DVD note it up-scales nicely in a blu-ray player, & the format is in wide-screen.Fun curious Q why didn't the Mother go to look for her son? what mother would just let her son go like that not knowing if he had landed safely or was cared for? get the DVD if you don't know what I'm asking :)",3,Radio Flyer DVD review,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1735,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'years', 'ago', 'teen', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'liked', 'know', 'what', 'still', 'even', 'years', 'pastI', 'thought', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'were', 'So', 'cute', 'performances', 'were', 'great', 'too', 'loved', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'narrating', 'yes', 'had', 'small', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'work', 'felt', 'sad', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'abuse', 'scenes', 'aside', 'sad', 'moments', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'moments', 'movie', 'too', 'fact', 'liked', 'whole', 'general', 'mood', 'film', 'gave', 'fun', 'nostalgic', 'feeling', 'sure', 'movie', 'not', 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganza', 'great', 'little', 'appreciated', 'film', 'simple', 'yet', 'great', 'quality', 'also', 'different', 'ending', 'say', 'different', 'not', 'usual', 'sort', 'ending', ""'d"", 'see', 'most', 'films', 'typePlease', 'note', 'gave', 'DVD', '3', 'stars', 'Disk', 'not', 'have', 'extras', 'No', 'audio', 'commentary', 'No', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'think', 'film', 'deserved', 'good', 'DVD', 'release', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'proper', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'sigh', 'wish', 'movie', 'makers', 'responsible', 'getting', 'movies', 'released', 'DVD', 'would', 'remember', 'sometimes', 'films', 'have', 'wings', 'box', 'office', 'still', 'have', 'fans', 'love', 'hope', 'ya', 'caught', 'wings', 'reference', 'lol', 'said', 'really', '4', 'half', 'star', 'movie', ""'m"", 'rating', 'DVD', 'not', 'movie', 'last', 'DVD', 'note', 'up-scales', 'nicely', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'format', 'wide-screen.Fun', 'curious', 'Q', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Mother', 'go', 'look', 'son', 'what', 'mother', 'would', 'just', 'let', 'son', 'go', 'not', 'knowing', 'had', 'landed', 'safely', 'was', 'cared', 'get', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'asking']",N/A

Abusers often select one child for the abuse and use the terror of possible abuse to keep the others in line.  We never see the original abandoning/abandoned father either, which speaks to the possibility that he was cut from the same cloth as King and mom was as much a perpetrator as a victim in her choice of abusive spouses.I am confused by the ending but if suicide was the choice, the child could have seen the inevitable future and decided to take control of the means of his end: in hope rather than dispair.This is a film about the quite desperation of being a prisoner in one's own home with the terror that it brings.  Sanity can only be found in fantasy and imagination.  Remember that Jennie in the film Forest Gump wanted to be a bird and fly away from her abuser as well.  She too self destructed.

However, this does not mean that Radio Flyer is bad or unwatchable, for any weakness in the script is transcended by the beautiful chemistry of Joseph Mazzello and Elijah Wood.

They give the film its heart, and had any other young actors appeared in their place, the picture would have failed miserably. But to watch these two young actors at work is a truly mezmerizing experience.

Judging by the title, &quot;Radio Flyer&quot;, I would have never thought of what was in the film to be in the film.  Initially, I was not too keen about the issues contained in this film.  Then as the years went by, I understood completely why the way things were.As many know, there are several issues in this film, that as a child are curious about.  Believe me, I was one of them.  This film has its many ups and downs.  It explores elements brotherhood, happiness, normality, and abuse.  Domesticity was an enormous problem shared in the hands of two innocent brothers, Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello, their biological mother, Lorraine Bracco, and their intoxicated and abusive stepfather, Adam Baldwin.I don't want to give other people a horrible impression of this movie due to how I started this out.  As electrifying and courageous this film is, it proves that two brothers can help each other out and be there for each other.  Also, I say this film is unexpected because of the conclusion.  Courage is the key word to not just the ending, but to the film as a whole.  It tells audiences to get out there and take a chance.Although there are many, memorable moments of laughter, sadness, and excitement, this film also asks us all a question, &quot;CAN THIS BE DONE IN REAL LIFE?&quot;This film has my absolute blessing to be passed onto another !",5,An emotional and unexpected turn out ! !,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,1467,"['was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'Truthfully', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'got', 'older', 'Judging', 'title', 'quot', 'Radio', 'Flyer', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'what', 'was', 'film', 'be', 'film', 'Initially', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'issues', 'contained', 'film', 'Then', 'years', 'went', 'understood', 'completely', 'why', 'way', 'things', 'were.As', 'many', 'know', 'are', 'several', 'issues', 'film', 'child', 'are', 'curious', 'Believe', 'was', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'ups', 'downs', 'elements', 'brotherhood', 'happiness', 'normality', 'abuse', 'Domesticity', 'was', 'enormous', 'problem', 'shared', 'hands', 'two', 'innocent', 'brothers', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'biological', 'mother', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'intoxicated', 'abusive', 'stepfather', 'Adam', 'Baldwin.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'other', 'people', 'horrible', 'impression', 'movie', 'due', 'how', 'started', 'out', 'electrifying', 'courageous', 'film', 'two', 'brothers', 'can', 'help', 'other', 'out', 'be', 'there', 'other', 'Also', 'say', 'film', 'unexpected', 'conclusion', 'Courage', 'key', 'word', 'not', 'just', 'ending', 'film', 'whole', 'audiences', 'get', 'there', 'take', 'chance.Although', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'laughter', 'sadness', 'excitement', 'film', 'also', 'question', 'quot', 'CAN', 'THIS', 'BE', 'DONE', 'IN', 'REAL', 'LIFE', 'quot', 'film', 'absolute', 'blessing', 'be', 'passed']",N/A

You overanalyze the plot and themes of this movie and deem it unacceptable because it doesn't apply to real life and that it should be portrayed in better points leading up to child abuse. This movie may comprise of many points, but it is very simple. Two brothers struggle to overcome the stepfather's constant abuse and finally find a solution to cease it. This movie is blended very perfectly on two strong points: child abuse and imagination.  A 6-year old still gets creeped out by scary movies and monsters, yet he's got the real monster living in his house, and he still manages to hold on to his imagination and depends on his older brother for solace and protection. What better plot than that? It shows that people still have shreds of dignity and self-respect inside them, and that there is always a way out.  I think the reason why &quot;The King&quot;'s face wasn't shown is because it was portrayed in both boys' minds- they don't want to see his face. They would rather look at his body instead of his face. If his face was shown, this movie would actually be butchered. The entire movie is just shown in both boys' realms of imagination and memories, and it's sad when you guys think differently. You have forgotten what it was like to be a child. The 6-year-old is encountered with a problem even most adults can't bear to resolve, and still manages to hold on the fact that there still is hope, that he can fly away... were you watching this movie with a closed mind? Tell you what: watch this movie again with a very open mind, and i'll just see about forgetting that there are shallow people in the world.  I admire Bobby for his courage and ability to hold on his imagination-too many people forget imagination too soon, and are left with a very boring life. :)As for me, I'll treasure this movie.

What it dwells on is young Bobby's inventiveness and innocence, and his love for flight. Unlike most young  Hollywood actors, Joseph Mazzelo is apparently unaffected by fame and gives  a realistic performance of a first grader, instead of coming off like a  child-puppet with a hidden microphone through which a squeaky-voiced adult  is speaking.Through the thick and thin, Bobby (portrayed by the highly  esteemed Joseph Mazzelo) struggles to remain whole, to fend of attacks from  The King (his mother's new husband) and to live up to the expectations of  his two-years-older brother, Mikey (played by a young Elijah Wood).  Dramatic only in the sense that adults may feel some sense of loss for the  beauty that is childhood, Radio Flyer is an uplifting excursion into the  awed fantasies of a little boy. James Horner was the right man for the  soundtrack, the cast was well-chosen, and there are enough humorous spots  to deflect the attention from the more painful accounts of beating and  belting.

It always made me very sad to see the abuse that happened on screen, when I saw it was on cable, I decided to watch it.  I was not watching it too closely, but I came on Amazon.com and read some reviews that opened my eyes to what the content of this film really is about and made me see the film in a new light.  When watching this, I was often confused by the end, but upon reflection, it makes a lot more sense.The story is about Mickey and Bobby. Two brothers who live their mother, their stepfather, and a dog, and later a pet turtle as well. Bobby is being abused by the stepfather so together Bobby and Mickey work to make an escape for him out of a Radio Flyer wagon that they make into a flyer.The children's performances are fantastic! Both Elijah Wood and Joseph Marzello are absolutely amazing, and it is worth seeing the movie just for their performances alone.  If you're a fan of Elijah Wood and have not seen this, I highly recommend finding a copy of this as soon as possible! If you have seen it, watch it again, and bear in mind that ""History is in the mind of the teller, truth is the teller.""So you be the judge of what the movie and the ending are. :DThis deals freely with domestic abuse so if those sorts of themes disturb you, you may want to steer clear of this film as it is one of the central themes.God Bless ~Amy",5,"""History is in the Mind of the teller....""",1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,1398,"['had', 'seen', 'movie', 'couple', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'always', 'made', 'very', 'sad', 'see', 'abuse', 'happened', 'screen', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'cable', 'decided', 'watch', 'was', 'not', 'watching', 'too', 'closely', 'came', 'Amazon.com', 'read', 'reviews', 'opened', 'eyes', 'what', 'content', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'see', 'film', 'new', 'light', 'When', 'watching', 'was', 'often', 'confused', 'end', 'reflection', 'lot', 'more', 'sense.The', 'story', 'Mickey', 'Bobby', 'Two', 'brothers', 'who', 'live', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'dog', 'later', 'pet', 'turtle', 'as', 'well', 'Bobby', 'being', 'abused', 'stepfather', 'so', 'together', 'Bobby', 'Mickey', 'work', 'make', 'escape', 'Radio', 'Flyer', 'wagon', 'make', 'flyer.The', 'children', 'performances', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Joseph', 'Marzello', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'just', 'performances', 'alone', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'highly', 'recommend', 'finding', 'copy', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'have', 'seen', 'watch', 'again', 'bear', 'mind', 'History', 'mind', 'teller', 'truth', 'teller', 'be', 'judge', 'what', 'movie', 'ending', 'are', 'DThis', 'deals', 'freely', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'so', 'sorts', 'themes', 'disturb', 'may', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'film', 'one', 'central', 'themes.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

The plot is not so merry, rather sad, but things like that sadly do happen in reality.The film is about one single mum's straggles after her husband leaves her, and she has to raise two sons alone. Then she meets a man she falls in love with, but sadly, she never knows how bad he treats her sons, especially the youngest one, who gets beaten from time to time. But the children keep it secret from mum because they want her to be happy. How beautiful is it? However, after a while they find a way of escape for the youngest brother to avoid leading this unbearable living.This film contains powerful messages to the people. The strongest one is about how important it is to keep an eye on your children and never let them suffer, because they can never tell you until it is too late... And that you can actually loose them.This film is a deeply touching one, you get to see one of the yearly works by Elijah Wood, which is stunning.

The film is great until the last ten minutes or so.  I am writing this because many people view the ending as a metaphor for suicide (many of the other reviews here have stated that or alluded to it).It occurs to me that, as astounding as the performances and as well-written as the film is, I can't recommend this motion picture, it completely gives the wrong message.The film is about two little boys who are being emotionally and physically abused by their step-father.  They kept it to themselves and attempt to solve the problem in their own way.  They could have told their mother, they could have told the policeman, or even the post man who delievered their potion.  They didn't.  Then, before the credits roll, the producers of the film, after having laid out the moral &quot;put your problems in your own hands&quot;, gives a hotline number for abused children.  It simply was irresponsible.

316138,A27QLYGAM9AU3M,6302492939,Mike Sobocinski,"[8, 11]","A problem with this film is that since Hollywood today is always presenting impossible events as real, most viewers of this film will probably be kids and will not understand what it appears the original writer was trying to do.  If we take for granted that toy wagons do not actually fly, then it makes sense that our young hero met the same fate, or worse, as the original daredevil from years ago.  Thus, the flyer symbolizes escape, and the story is a tragic one befitting its subject matter well.  On the other hand, though, the film then presents two additional minutes of ""evidence"" claiming that the flight was not simply a childish rationalization, since postcards are supposedly being received for years afterward to confirm that an escape actually occurred.  This is of course absurd and should not be believed, and yet Hollywood has dished up that kind of garbage so much that I actually think the original writer had one idea in mind, but that the producers/director tacked on a phony ""feel-good"" ending that contradicts the original intentions of the script.  Inane feel-good fantasy endings have been dished out countless times before (including Donner's own ""The Goonies"") and so I need to see additional evidence in the film that the metaphor as presented really holds together.  Fellow reviewers have commented that the abuse could have caused a dissociative disorder.  This would be an ingenious wrap-up to the film if there were clear evidence for it in Tom Hanks' character.  Instead, we have him making a trivial ""pinky promise"" on the whim of the kid even though he'd just spent two hours telling them not to make promises lightly.  Frankly, I just think the filmmakers' and test audiences couldn't handle the power of the script, and felt it needed toning down.  Fans of the film later can find clever ways after the fact to have the story fit together in a way that makes sense, just as people keep reading things into the Bible to try to fit it together, but we should see some evidence that such things are truly a part of the film, although I agree that they might have been intended by the original storywriter.If we keep the shot of the dog staring after the flyer, and then remove most of the material following it, retaining only Hanks' saying two things: (1) that history is in the mind of the teller, and (2) That's why a promise is so important, and then the credits roll, then the film remains really powerful and consistent, rather than self-negated.  Otherwise, we need to see in the mother's face that the narrator has constructed a second personality to attribute the abuse to, or at the very least to see that Tom Hanks was affected in some way that hints at mental illness.  As it stands, it isn't clearly demonstrated to me that the filmmakers intended or understood that interpretation of the script, assuming that the original writer of the film really did do such a brilliant job (screenwriter David Mickey Evans' other credits are not nearly so impressive).  If the original script was really so ingenious as elements of this film suggest, and people assume that the director, Richard Donner, is literate enough to relay its sophistication properly, then we should also find Donner or Evans effectively doing other films that have similar potential.  Instead, Donner's other projects are effective purely as action/thriller types of works with little or no literary significance (Lethal Weapon, Superman, The Omen).The film Radio Flyer at it is contains a number of juvenile aspects that clumsily subvert the effectiveness of what should be an adult-oriented script.  The result is messy, but with better editing that makes the tragic elements clearer to viewers, or with a clearer presentation of script elements, a brilliant film can be salvaged from it.  However, the performances by the youngsters and the mother are ASTONISHINGLY good and are mainly what sustains the whole film through its flaws.",4,High-potential; fatal flaws need editing,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,3949,"['problem', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'always', 'presenting', 'impossible', 'events', 'real', 'most', 'viewers', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'kids', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'original', 'writer', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'take', 'granted', 'toy', 'wagons', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'fly', 'then', 'sense', 'young', 'hero', 'met', 'same', 'fate', 'worse', 'original', 'daredevil', 'years', 'ago', 'Thus', 'flyer', 'escape', 'story', 'tragic', 'one', 'befitting', 'subject', 'matter', 'well', 'other', 'hand', 'though', 'film', 'then', 'two', 'additional', 'minutes', 'evidence', 'claiming', 'flight', 'was', 'not', 'simply', 'childish', 'rationalization', 'postcards', 'are', 'supposedly', 'being', 'received', 'years', 'afterward', 'confirm', 'escape', 'actually', 'occurred', 'course', 'absurd', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'believed', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'dished', 'up', 'kind', 'garbage', 'so', 'much', 'actually', 'think', 'original', 'writer', 'had', 'one', 'idea', 'mind', 'producers/director', 'tacked', 'phony', 'feel-good', 'ending', 'original', 'intentions', 'script', 'Inane', 'feel-good', 'fantasy', 'endings', 'have', 'been', 'dished', 'out', 'countless', 'times', 'including', 'Donner', 'own', 'Goonies', 'so', 'need', 'see', 'additional', 'evidence', 'film', 'metaphor', 'presented', 'really', 'together', 'Fellow', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'abuse', 'could', 'have', 'caused', 'dissociative', 'disorder', 'would', 'be', 'ingenious', 'wrap-up', 'film', 'were', 'clear', 'evidence', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'Instead', 'have', 'making', 'trivial', 'pinky', 'promise', 'whim', 'kid', 'even', ""'d"", 'just', 'spent', 'two', 'hours', 'telling', 'not', 'make', 'promises', 'lightly', 'Frankly', 'just', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'test', 'audiences', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'power', 'script', 'felt', 'needed', 'toning', 'down', 'Fans', 'film', 'later', 'can', 'find', 'clever', 'ways', 'fact', 'have', 'story', 'fit', 'together', 'way', 'sense', 'just', 'people', 'keep', 'reading', 'things', 'Bible', 'try', 'fit', 'together', 'should', 'see', 'evidence', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'truly', 'part', 'film', 'agree', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'original', 'storywriter.If', 'keep', 'shot', 'dog', 'staring', 'flyer', 'then', 'remove', 'most', 'material', 'following', 'retaining', 'only', 'Hanks', 'saying', 'two', 'things', '1', 'history', 'mind', 'teller', '2', 'why', 'promise', 'so', 'important', 'then', 'credits', 'roll', 'then', 'film', 'really', 'powerful', 'consistent', 'rather', 'self-negated', 'Otherwise', 'need', 'see', 'mother', 'face', 'narrator', 'constructed', 'second', 'personality', 'attribute', 'abuse', 'very', 'least', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'affected', 'way', 'hints', 'mental', 'illness', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'filmmakers', 'intended', 'understood', 'interpretation', 'script', 'assuming', 'original', 'writer', 'film', 'really', 'did', 'do', 'brilliant', 'job', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Mickey', 'Evans', 'other', 'credits', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'impressive', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'really', 'so', 'ingenious', 'elements', 'film', 'suggest', 'people', 'assume', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'literate', 'enough', 'relay', 'sophistication', 'properly', 'then', 'should', 'also', 'find', 'Donner', 'Evans', 'effectively', 'doing', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'similar', 'potential', 'Instead', 'Donner', 'other', 'projects', 'are', 'effective', 'purely', 'action/thriller', 'types', 'works', 'little', 'literary', 'significance', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Superman', 'Omen', '.The', 'film', 'Radio', 'Flyer', 'number', 'juvenile', 'aspects', 'clumsily', 'effectiveness', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'adult-oriented', 'script', 'result', 'messy', 'better', 'editing', 'tragic', 'elements', 'clearer', 'viewers', 'clearer', 'presentation', 'script', 'elements', 'brilliant', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'salvaged', 'However', 'performances', 'youngsters', 'mother', 'are', 'ASTONISHINGLY', 'good', 'are', 'mainly', 'what', 'whole', 'film', 'flaws']",N/A

Sometimes I think Hollywood movie makers become a little too obtuse or purposely ambiguous.  Scorsese does this too.  Perhaps that was done here as well.  I first saw this film 15 years ago when it was released, no one I spoke to at that time understood the ending, although everyone enjoyed the movie.  I saw it the second time just a few days ago.  I see what some reviewers are getting at with the two boys actually being different facets of one person.  Looked at that way, the ending (yes, as a metaphor) makes more sense.  Still, I disagree that there are many clues, and evidently that was not what the movie maker was shooting for.  There are too many scenes where there is no ambiguity about the presence of two distinct boys, both to the mother and to others.  At the end, with Samson the turtle still on-board with Bobby, one wouldn't know what became of him.  Yet, at the very end, Tom Hanks' two screen sons ask if that is how they ""got Samson"".  Another ambiguity.  (We know the dog jumped out to defend the boys.)Anyway, ambiguity aside, the two boys' performance is astonishingly good.  If only current movies aimed at teens had equally excellent acting.  They really, really are quite good.  The dog comes in a close second.  He played the best dog someone could ever have, and he played it well.The message of the movie provoked some observations.  Although this would not be the case in every instance in real life (thank god), my experience has been that the typical woman portrayed as their mother would have, again and again, taken this man back.  The psychodynamics and dysfunction which explains that is too much to go into here.  Or, having finally rid herself of this individual, she would find someone like him to take his place.  The efforts of social agencies, the police, the courts, well-meaning friends and family--all are of no avail in so many tragic cases.The film is well worth watching.  It is useful in making us more aware of child abuse.

Of course, perhaps because the families invariably were white (though obviously intended to represent some ""universal"" human experience), my more diverse family was spared this sort of insanity.  I don't know.  I do know that there are some things I don't care to see on film or otherwise, abuse of children (and animals) being among them.  Still, I gave ""Radio Flyer"" a chance, in part because it was directed by the underrated Richard Donner.  Overall, I found the film well-conceived, with a relationship between the brothers that was both warm and convincing.  Much is made of Elijah Wood, who seems to overact in a few scenes; his co-star, Joseph Mazzello, is far sturdier as the younger brother, Bobby, as is Tom Hanks, voicing the adult version of Wood's Mike.  Lorraine Bracco plays the typical featherbrained mother who is both largely ignorant of her children's suffering and divided in her loyalties to them and the psychotic meathead (Adam Baldwin) that gets drunk and knocks them around.  And what to make of the ending?  I understand there is debate about how literally it should be taken, as well as whether one of the brothers is real or a literary construct; I won't spoil it, but will say that in some ways, the ending may seem both obvious and a copout to anyone who has read more than three issues of ""The New Yorker.""  And though I wouldn't recommend the film for children--its Disney moments are contrasted with a few more appropriate for Scorsese--I will say it made the subject matter palatable.",4,Better Than I Expected,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,1852,"['are', 'times', 'when', 'think', ""'m"", 'only', 'person', 'America', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'abused', 'parents', 'students', 'frequently', 'write', 'such', 'things', 'books', 'such', 'matters', 'top', 'bestseller', 'lists', 'Hollywood', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'helped', 'reinforce', 'belief', 'spate', 'films', 'child', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'flooded', 'theaters', 'course', 'perhaps', 'families', 'invariably', 'were', 'white', 'obviously', 'intended', 'represent', 'universal', 'human', 'experience', 'more', 'diverse', 'family', 'was', 'spared', 'sort', 'insanity', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'know', 'are', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'film', 'otherwise', 'abuse', 'children', 'animals', 'being', 'Still', 'gave', 'Radio', 'Flyer', 'chance', 'part', 'was', 'directed', 'underrated', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Overall', 'found', 'film', 'well-conceived', 'relationship', 'brothers', 'was', 'warm', 'convincing', 'Much', 'made', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'who', 'overact', 'few', 'scenes', 'co-star', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'far', 'sturdier', 'younger', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'voicing', 'adult', 'version', 'Wood', 'Mike', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'typical', 'featherbrained', 'mother', 'who', 'largely', 'ignorant', 'children', 'suffering', 'divided', 'loyalties', 'psychotic', 'meathead', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'drunk', 'around', 'what', 'make', 'ending', 'understand', 'debate', 'how', 'literally', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'brothers', 'real', 'literary', 'construct', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'will', 'say', 'ways', 'ending', 'may', 'seem', 'obvious', 'copout', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'more', 'three', 'issues', 'New', 'Yorker', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'children', 'Disney', 'moments', 'are', 'contrasted', 'few', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Scorsese', 'will', 'say', 'made', 'subject', 'matter', 'palatable']",N/A

The story conveys a mundane magic and sense of wonder that seems impossible - until you look at the little guys around you, and see them living it out.This movie captures some of that magic. It's a hard world, too, with things in it that should never happen to any child. But, if you think that commitment and love have to wait until they grow up, you got it all wrong. These boys love their mother more than she can know, and prove it in their lives and actions. That dedication, even if mistaken, stands as one of the miracles of everyday life.In the end, boyish invention and adventure win out.
