1078089,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B000QXDEGS,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[130, 136]","This drama set in a small town in Ireland is less significant for its substance than for the days-gone-by nostalgia feel of it. It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity.  As the series begins we come to know an attractive pub owner who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born.  In time she begins to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development. The program encourages us to take sides between the traditionalist (sometimes selfish) church of the past, and a more lively (but less absolute) version of it, as evinced by this young priest from afar who stirs up this town a bit. It's not at all a religious program, mind you; just an overly unrepresentative portrayal of idyllic Ireland in which you cannot fail to include religion.  Full disclosure: I like this show, but I also have Irish blood. I say this because this really is a program which appeals to a particular sort of individual; to one who either has Irish blood and/or for those whom Ireland has some draw. Ireland has an inherent appeal to many such people from around the world. Even if you have never visited it, can you not right now visualize vast green fields and rolling hills bordered by stone walls, snugly cozy pubs filled with glasses of Guinness raised, and smiling faces? Of course, I'm exaggerating here, but you must grant that Ireland is a far more attractive place than many others, at least in a theoretical quality-of-life sort of way. It's thought of as the sort of place where stress is not as prevalent as where one finds oneself; having a bygone character to it (notwithstanding this not to be as true in actuality, but like in many other things, imagination often persists over reality).  If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's public radio show, ""A Prairie Home Companion"" (Saturdays at 6 pm across the USA), Ballykissangel is to Ireland what the fictional town of ""Lake Woebegone"" is to the American heartland. I recommend both. Both evince what a part of us long for (if you are a nostalgic sort of person, regardless of your age--even a 25 year old can long for previous eras) and even though such may not suit us, it does make us inclined to enjoy programs like ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Ballykissangel"".This show though, like a brain, has two lobes of sorts, with the dividing line between the first 3 seasons  (26 episodes) and the 2 seasons following them (24 episodes); with season 6 (an abbreviated season of 8 episodes) pretty much standing alone.  (And whether you will enjoy season six comes down to the sort of person you are; whether you relish variety or prefer the TV shows, musical artists, actresses you like to be recognizably the same over their runs, careers. The answer to that will determine whether you easily accept the loss of 3 huge cast members---one of whom passed away in real life necessitating major changes---with 3 other supporting players moving on as well---that series six  tries to recover from, and thus is not especially representative of the proceeding years of this still welcoming program to watch, but at one and the same time, just not the same anymore absent the fulcrum (raison d'tre even) of the whole program.)Season four, in this sense, is not just the fourth year of this program, but really is just the first of several attempts to digest huge cast changes. Bit players Liam & Donal who did their job well as hapless hired hands to the focal character of the show (Brian Quigley) have had their roles upped several fold during this year. Thus we see them dredge for gold balls in one of the water hazard's at Quigley's golf course. One of them mysteriously (with no explanation) becomes the guardian of a ""pet"" bear;  a bear, who obviously then wreaks a bit of havoc. New faces are also introduced. The town has a new priest (who brings his sister), a new farmer (with his teenage daughter), and the old farmer's presence is complicated by the arrival of his nephew (also a young adult who predictably catches the eye of the new gal in town). In short, a lot is new herein & it takes a bit to absorb all of it since all 5 newcomers are introduced en masse. 3 of these, incidentally, are flat-out successful in the roles and add much to providing much needed ballast after the 3rd season lost the program's 2 central characters. Father Aidan, as the new understudy to Father Mac, helps to re-center the plot and his sister provides much needed liveliness.  Change in series 5 is represented by the arrival of a new police Guard to town, and the character is a winning one---a woman this time, going by the name of Frankie, but she's attractive and capable in the role; but also rather more of a ""tough guy"" than Guard Egan (though also likable) ever was during the first 4 years. Ambrose Egan's widow, the aforementioned Niamh (who interestingly too, was Father Aidan actor Don Wycherley's real-life sister-in-law, providing an extra dose of natural emotion in this warm-hearted program & who can be seen in the fine Irish drama by the title of ""The Hanging Gale"" with the fabulous Michael Kitchen starring)  is the star of this season. Tony Doyle, who plays her father Brian Quigley remains the character around whom the show really revolves; or his schemes, doings, etc. are responsible for many happenings in this series, as per the norm with previous seasons of BallyK.After having viewed this series several times I am almost tempted to suggest newcomers to the series to start with season 4 and then ""flashback,"" in effect, to the first 3 seasons so as to end with the most dramatic episodes of the entire series (which are the last 2 of season 3).P.S.  In case you're in the Dublin area one day, do take the time to visit the ""set"" of Ballykissangel, which isn't one at all actually; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occasionally commandeered for filming. It's not that far from Dublin, where you can have a glass of stout in Fitzgerald's Bar ; and/or visit BallyK's church,  as you walk into ""the program,"" so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar.  (And, if you haven't seen it yet, do treat yourself to seeing Assumpta's Leo in the very Irish and funny film ""Waking Ned Devine"".)

I could see all kinds of possibilities for this premise and I was not disappointed for 3 seasons while Father Peter was there.  However, the decision to end the 3rd season so abruptly was very jarring, since the two principal characters disappeared in a most disturbing manner and the interplay of characters that had been so engrossing up to then took a drastic turn downward. The importation of an Irish priest destroyed the original premise and no strong or compelling storyline evolved thereafter.  Less significant characters came and went and none had the strong appeal of the first cast working together on a relatively cohesive plot.

1078092,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B000QXDEGS,FYI,"[9, 10]","I extend a thank you to the other reviewers here, for their accurate descriptions of this series. It's not simply twee, but a complex micro-universe of human issues played out in a beautiful setting. It happens to be a great deal, as each episode is a full hour long. The work and care that went into the production is evident at every turn. The Irish landscape is a starring character. We loved watching rickety Eamon playing musicals in his barn and singing to his pigs.Seasons 1-3 stand out. Sadly, after that, the narrative of the priest and his faith diminishes quite a bit. Too bad the focus on the tensions of faith weren't explored in more depth as the series progressed. Inexplicably, way too much time is spent following the antics of Liam and Donal, they're boring versions of Laurel & Hardy, focused on monetary schemes and rip-offs. This lacks the depth of the first seasons. The actors do what they can with the material, and Season 4 has some interest with family feuds, but Season 5 disintegrates into soap-opera, with inexplicable character behavior/changes, teenage angst, and marriage dramas a la ""Knots Landing"" or ""Desperate Housewives."" The first 3 seasons created a potential momentum for the remainder of the series, that was lost. Episode 2 of Season 6 is a throw-away, reiterating the chaotic financial slapstick of seasons 4-5. The priest is faced with the an unconvincing version of romance. The whole thing ends quite abruptly. But at least it is filmed in Ireland, with better quality acting than most television series.The idyllic Irish village is beautiful. Requited love, domestic abuse, death, loneliness, child neglect, teenage pregnancy, tensions in the Church in Ireland, secular vs. religious views are covered. I wish it had actually been more spiritual and less soap-opera; there was way too much focus on the ""Laurel & Hardy"" slapstick.You would likely enjoy the following DVDs as well:The Secret of Roan InishThe Quiet Man (Collector's Edition)The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a MountainA Child's Christmas in WalesMillions",3,Guinness Extra-Stout On Tap,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2080,"['extend', 'thank', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'accurate', 'descriptions', 'series', 'not', 'simply', 'twee', 'complex', 'micro-universe', 'human', 'issues', 'played', 'out', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'be', 'great', 'deal', 'episode', 'full', 'hour', 'long', 'work', 'care', 'went', 'production', 'evident', 'turn', 'Irish', 'landscape', 'starring', 'character', 'loved', 'watching', 'rickety', 'Eamon', 'playing', 'musicals', 'barn', 'singing', 'pigs.Seasons', '1-3', 'stand', 'Sadly', 'narrative', 'priest', 'faith', 'diminishes', 'quite', 'bit', 'Too', 'bad', 'focus', 'tensions', 'faith', 'were', ""n't"", 'explored', 'more', 'depth', 'series', 'progressed', 'Inexplicably', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'following', 'antics', 'Liam', 'Donal', ""'re"", 'boring', 'versions', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'focused', 'monetary', 'schemes', 'rip-offs', 'depth', 'first', 'seasons', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'material', 'Season', '4', 'interest', 'family', 'feuds', 'Season', '5', 'disintegrates', 'soap-opera', 'inexplicable', 'character', 'behavior/changes', 'teenage', 'angst', 'marriage', 'dramas', 'la', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'created', 'potential', 'momentum', 'remainder', 'series', 'was', 'lost', 'Episode', '2', 'Season', '6', 'throw-away', 'reiterating', 'chaotic', 'financial', 'slapstick', 'seasons', '4-5', 'priest', 'faced', 'unconvincing', 'version', 'romance', 'whole', 'thing', 'quite', 'abruptly', 'least', 'filmed', 'Ireland', 'better', 'quality', 'acting', 'most', 'television', 'series.The', 'idyllic', 'Irish', 'village', 'beautiful', 'Requited', 'love', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'death', 'loneliness', 'child', 'neglect', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'tensions', 'Church', 'Ireland', 'secular', 'vs.', 'religious', 'views', 'are', 'covered', 'wish', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'more', 'spiritual', 'less', 'soap-opera', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'slapstick.You', 'would', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'following', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'InishThe', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Englishman', 'Who', 'Went', 'Hill', 'Came', 'Down', 'MountainA', 'Child', 'Christmas', 'WalesMillions']",Ballykissangel: The Complete Collection
