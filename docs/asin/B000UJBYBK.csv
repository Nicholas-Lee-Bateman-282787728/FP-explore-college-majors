1095197,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000UJBYBK,Artist & Author,"[2, 3]","In many ways this is a predictable movie - the long shot underdogs come out on top after a lot of hard work, discipline and devotion to following the rules.  Still, it is a very satisfying movie, especially knowing that it is based on a real group of South Bronx grade school kids.  On the other hand, if after watching the movie you learn that the kids are still losers, you would feel cheated, so being predictable isn't really that bad.The unusual quality of the movie is that it is focused on chess, somewhat unusual for a movie.  [See also the Wonderworks program, 'The Mighty Pawns,' 'The Luzhin Defence,' and the comedy, 'Hatley High,']  We graded the movie down slightly because there are a few swear words, once by the teacher, but otherwise only from the junkies and losers with whom the kids have to deal.  If you like chess, you'll probably like this movie.  Even if you don't understand chess, you'll be glad you watched it, especially when reading the things the kids wrote about how chess changed their lives.",5,"Predictable, But Satisfying",1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,1024,"['many', 'ways', 'predictable', 'movie', 'long', 'shot', 'underdogs', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'discipline', 'devotion', 'following', 'rules', 'Still', 'very', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'especially', 'knowing', 'based', 'real', 'group', 'South', 'Bronx', 'grade', 'school', 'kids', 'other', 'hand', 'watching', 'movie', 'learn', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'losers', 'would', 'feel', 'cheated', 'being', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad.The', 'unusual', 'quality', 'movie', 'focused', 'chess', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'movie', 'See', 'also', 'Wonderworks', 'program', 'Mighty', 'Pawns', 'Luzhin', 'Defence', 'comedy', 'High', 'graded', 'movie', 'down', 'slightly', 'are', 'few', 'swear', 'words', 'once', 'teacher', 'otherwise', 'only', 'junkies', 'losers', 'whom', 'kids', 'have', 'deal', 'like', 'chess', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'movie', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'chess', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'watched', 'especially', 'when', 'reading', 'things', 'kids', 'wrote', 'how', 'chess', 'changed', 'lives']",Knights of the South Bronx

1095200,A1FNW6H983I87V,B000UJBYBK,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[0, 0]","The film begins with former engineer businessman Richard Mason (Danson) showing up at an inner-city school for what he thought was to be his first day teaching sixth grade. It turns out to be fourth grade and they're not very interested in learning. Based on true events, Mason, a chess master, finds common ground with the students in teaching them the game of chess in a way that challenges and motivates them to want to be the best. Mason, dealing with his own demons at home, finds a new life in the classroom and so do the students. While the plot and ending may be somewhat predictable, the film feels true and realistic. There is always room for one more well done story of someone who thinks outside the box to change their world and those around them for good. May their tribe increase! Very entertaining and family friendly.

He takes a class room of kids that haven't got a clue about what education do for them and transforms their thinking and gives them ideas about the future!

It shows how one or even a few people can make a difference in the lives of those who are not only less fortunate but living in dangerous situations.  This is the case of the fourth grade kids in the class of Richard Mason, a former corporate engineer, and chess champion.  He teaches them to appreciate the game by comparing it to a battle, which a lot of them are already used to, like the kid, Jimmy who is always getting beaten up by some teenage thugs.  Not only do the fourth graders as well as the kindergartner, brother of Renee, Dawson become proficient at the game, their school performance also improves.  So much for following lesson plans, finally the principal actually gets it and becomes supportive of this group of kids that go on to chess tournaments and eventually win the support of people outside of the school district.
