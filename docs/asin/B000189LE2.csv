However, when the entire world sees this movie, they'll start to understand a little more about what made her tick.This movie is based on the true story of how Guerin, an Irish reporter, galvanized her country into implementing stricter drug laws and cracking down on drug-related crimes and drug abuse. It spans a period of two years, from Guerin's decision to take down Dublin's drug overlord, to her eventual assassination. (I'm not revealing any secrets - she's shot at the beginning before the movie flashes back).

We see violence on television and in the movies so much that, in large measure, we continually creep toward a fatalistic acceptance of it.  Or we simply try not to concern ourselves with it so long as it does not directly affect us.  Representations of it on the screen are viewed---we see someone shoot another, say, but the terror of such violence is rarely conveyed skillfully enough for us to actually feel as if we ourselves are the ones being subjected to such gastly behavior.  That's the problem with Hollywood: it serves up platefuls of violence without inculcating in us viewers any revulsion to it.  It's not real, anyway; It's the movies, or television, etc., goes the refrain.  But violence ISN'T entertainment.  If we are to be subjected to expressions of it, I'd argue, the least we should expect---except perhaps in military epics---is that the director should present it for what it is and/or attempt to at least show the horror of it from the victim's perspective.  Is that too much to ask?  Fortunately, director Joel Schumacher, in this film does just that.  A particular scene in this biopic has reporter Veronica (most ably portrayed by Cate Blanchett) coming to knock on the door of a gangster.  What follows, as you can well imagine, is a confrontational exchange.  And the reason this film is a fine effort is that the rage of the (heretofore, under-the-radar) gangster is made as apparent herein as the fear with which his victim cowers from it.  The scene is as unpleasant to watch as it is important for understanding what the real Veronica Guerin persevered through.  And we---figuratively placed in her shoes thanks to skilled filmmakers---are left to ponder why, in fact, she continued to soldier on in the face of such; how she could recover from the blows she received---particularly the psychological one of almost being scared to death.  (One can learn more about this scene which, incidentially---like most in this film---actually occurred, by listening to the director's audio commentary available on this DVD. The producer and writing team offer 2 additional commentaries for the especially interested.)  Do consider this (more like 3 star) film. And contrary to what the editorial review says above, the first attempt at making this story into a film---""When the Sky Falls""---is not half as successful as ""Veronica Guerin.""

794715,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B000189LE2,C McGhee,"[1, 1]","Veronica Guerin a movie like many others based on a true story of criminal activity. Set in Ireland in the mid 1990's about a newspaper reporter that became involved in the drug war. How the events changed what she wrote about, fulfilled her desire to make a difference, affected her family & her country. All these things we've heard before but I was singularly struck by the realism used to tell this one.I'm not going to discuss the cast. The acting speaks louder than anything I could say.Crime is a virus that uses the living systems of society to maintain itself & breed others like itself. It mimics our social strata & our financial hierarchy in a deadly parade of life that at times gains a foothold in our respectable world. When it has recreated itself to the point that those not actively participating in crime are willing to accept crime as an acceptable part of society we are on the verge of the chaos that Ireland & Veronica faced in this show.The reasons people get involved in fights like these are shown in this movie. The free & often misunderstood flow of information from one to the other side as they try to out manipulate each other is shown here too. When does the story move from a professional project to an unbending challenge? I don't know that answer but I'm just as sure it does. The family, its struggles, the cause & the home butt heads again & again. We have however as I said seen this before. Never in this relaxed, realistic, honest & even disconcerting way though. It is the simple honest depiction of what happened during this tense time period that makes this movie stand out from others of its kind.In the end we see the great & undeniable good that arises from Veronica's murder & the sacrifice she made. It is rolled down the screen as those that did her & Ireland harm are brought to justice. The people of Ireland come together & force laws to change so law officers can do their job more efficiently. The land most definitely becomes a safer & cleaner place to live. We see the story of evil creating its own foe. One willing to pay any price for justice & we need that reminder.What we don't see is the immediate replacement of those that were jailed, by others now wise to the need to hide their activities. They, just like a corporation, replace an executive that dies, retires or moves on. Crime is a virus & mimics real life. The underworld shows here that when it is given an open place in society then it will take the death of a righteous person to stir society to action. They understand that. It's a major reason they want us to wink at their existence. If we leave this movie in celebration of Veronica Guerin's life that is well done, unless we leave it believing she won our battle. She showed us where the battle lies but it is for each age, nation & people to realize the fight is always on.Let the credits roll & think on that number of journalists killed doing their chosen job in just 6 more years after Veronica's death. 5 stars!",5,A Woman's Life,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,2995,"['Veronica', 'Guerin', 'movie', 'many', 'others', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'criminal', 'activity', 'Set', 'Ireland', 'mid', '1990', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'became', 'involved', 'drug', 'war', 'How', 'events', 'changed', 'what', 'wrote', 'about', 'fulfilled', 'desire', 'make', 'difference', 'affected', 'family', 'country', 'things', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'was', 'singularly', 'struck', 'realism', 'used', 'tell', 'one.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'discuss', 'cast', 'acting', 'speaks', 'louder', 'anything', 'could', 'say.Crime', 'virus', 'living', 'systems', 'society', 'maintain', 'breed', 'others', 'social', 'strata', 'financial', 'hierarchy', 'deadly', 'parade', 'life', 'times', 'gains', 'foothold', 'respectable', 'world', 'When', 'recreated', 'point', 'not', 'actively', 'participating', 'crime', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', 'crime', 'acceptable', 'part', 'society', 'are', 'verge', 'chaos', 'Ireland', 'Veronica', 'faced', 'show.The', 'reasons', 'people', 'get', 'involved', 'fights', 'are', 'shown', 'movie', 'free', 'often', 'misunderstood', 'flow', 'information', 'one', 'other', 'side', 'try', 'out', 'manipulate', 'other', 'shown', 'here', 'too', 'When', 'story', 'move', 'professional', 'project', 'unbending', 'challenge', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answer', ""'m"", 'just', 'sure', 'family', 'struggles', 'cause', 'home', 'butt', 'heads', 'again', 'again', 'have', 'however', 'said', 'seen', 'Never', 'relaxed', 'realistic', 'honest', 'even', 'disconcerting', 'way', 'simple', 'honest', 'depiction', 'what', 'happened', 'tense', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'others', 'kind.In', 'end', 'see', 'great', 'undeniable', 'good', 'Veronica', 'murder', 'sacrifice', 'made', 'rolled', 'down', 'screen', 'did', 'Ireland', 'harm', 'are', 'brought', 'justice', 'people', 'Ireland', 'come', 'together', 'force', 'laws', 'change', 'so', 'law', 'officers', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'more', 'efficiently', 'land', 'most', 'definitely', 'safer', 'cleaner', 'place', 'live', 'see', 'story', 'evil', 'creating', 'own', 'foe', 'One', 'willing', 'pay', 'price', 'justice', 'need', 'reminder.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'immediate', 'replacement', 'were', 'jailed', 'others', 'now', 'wise', 'need', 'hide', 'activities', 'just', 'corporation', 'replace', 'executive', 'moves', 'Crime', 'virus', 'mimics', 'real', 'life', 'underworld', 'here', 'when', 'given', 'open', 'place', 'society', 'then', 'will', 'take', 'death', 'righteous', 'person', 'stir', 'society', 'action', 'understand', 'major', 'reason', 'want', 'wink', 'existence', 'leave', 'movie', 'celebration', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'life', 'well', 'done', 'leave', 'believing', 'won', 'battle', 'showed', 'where', 'battle', 'age', 'nation', 'people', 'realize', 'fight', 'always', 'on.Let', 'credits', 'roll', 'think', 'number', 'journalists', 'killed', 'doing', 'chosen', 'job', 'just', '6', 'more', 'years', 'Veronica', 'death', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Of course, Cate Blanchett is a tour de force of her own, playing the lead role with both depth and sensitivity. The supporting cast all live up to expectations, portraying their characters with genuine believability. What I liked most about this movie was it's ability to show drugs not as some glamorous or farcical society inconvenience, but rather the kind of thing that drives people over the edger either with greed, addiction, or lunacy. Throughout the movie, violence and madness pervade people's motivations, driving them to do terrible things either to get high or make money. The senselessness of it is laid bare. I appreciated this bit of realism as opposed to the usual car chase/gun fight scenes. Veronica Guerin was a brave women to take on this challenge, a reporter not so naive as idealistic. In the end she was vindicated, something the movie handles in a brief montage near the end. Nonetheless, she paid the ultimate price, something not lost on those around her.

794718,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000189LE2,Deborah Earle,"[6, 7]","This review of Joel Schumacher's homage to the martyred Irish journalist is written to honor her on the tenth anniversary of her death.Cate Blanchett is riveting as the title character, who faces down incredible danger, not only to herself, but to her family as well, as she tries to make her job as a journalist more substantial by reporting on Dublin's growing drug problem, rather than sticking with comparatively minor stories such as church scandals. I feel her performance had more substance than that of Joan Allen's in another film based on Guerin's life.Brenda Fricker is Veronica's likeable and concerned mother, and the other standout performances are by Ciaran Hinds and Gerard McSorley as Guerin's two main nemeses.Guerin's tragic end, although foreseen at the beginning can make a viewer reel. But the equally powerful aftermath is noteworthy, too. It was literally and figuratively a case of ""getting the Irish up"", and  the decrease in the drug problem, and the persecution of the drug lords, and the confiscation of their ill-gotten gains.Perhaps Guerin could be considered the unofficial Patron Saint of journalists. This film magnificently captures the grittiness and terror of the underworld, and Guerin's bravery in facing it.As Christ left an imprint on the cloth with which Guerin's presumed Patron Saint wiped His face along the Via Dolorosa, so too, did this Veronica leave a powerful imprint upon her country and help change it for the better. The name, ""Veronica"" means ""true image"", and she definitely held a mirror up to her countrymen and women and made them see and face up to an unflattering truth about a specific problem in their country.

I'm not saying she should have stopped what she was doing, but there had to have been other ways for her to get the story without as much personal risk to her and her family.I crystallized this conclusion when I saw the scene where Ms. Guerin approaches Mr. Galligan, basically the top man in the crime syndicate, at his estate, which is expansive and includes a horse ranch.  By this point Ms. Guerin has already been shot once (at her son's birthday party!) and had her family's life threatened.  Yet she, without a wire or other police assistance, walks right up to Mr. Galligan's door and asks him point blank how he can afford his life when he has no obvious source of income.  This of course results in her getting the [...] kicked out of her.  What did she expect, milk and cookies?For all the chutzpah Ms. Guerin showed when approaching the crime lords face to face, I would have expected her to pull at least a Buffy or two.  When you ask the cheeky questions in dangerous situations, you better either have a big bodyguard or be able to take care of yourself.  She had neither, and, in a way, invited the physical abuse upon herself.Again, I don't mean to put down Ms. Guerin's real-life accomplishment in terms of calling attention to the drug problem thus starting its eradication, but the Veronica Guerin portrayed in this film was no doubt meant to appear strong, confident, and passionate about her cause; she came across instead as headstrong and reckless, placing her and her family's life in jeopardy.",3,Passionate or Naive?,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,2098,"['So', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'depiction', 'real-life', 'events', 'life', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'determined', 'expose', 'seedy', 'underbelly', 'organized', 'crime', 'group', 'Dublin', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'disrespect', 'Ms.', 'Guerin', 'work', 'did', 'country', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'depicting', 'motivations', 'life.I', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'personally', 'threatened', 'who', 'had', 'family', 'threatened', 'who', 'survived', '[', ']', 'attempt', 'would', 'continue', 'pursue', 'goal', 'dogmatically', 'as', 'recklessly', 'Ms.', 'Guerin', 'did', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'there', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'ways', 'get', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'personal', 'risk', 'family.I', 'crystallized', 'conclusion', 'when', 'saw', 'scene', 'where', 'Ms.', 'Guerin', 'Mr.', 'Galligan', 'basically', 'top', 'man', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'estate', 'expansive', 'horse', 'ranch', 'point', 'Ms.', 'Guerin', 'already', 'been', 'shot', 'once', 'son', 'birthday', 'party', 'had', 'family', 'life', 'threatened', 'wire', 'other', 'police', 'assistance', 'walks', 'right', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Galligan', 'door', 'point', 'blank', 'how', 'can', 'afford', 'life', 'when', 'obvious', 'source', 'income', 'course', 'results', 'getting', '[', ']', 'kicked', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'milk', 'cookies', 'chutzpah', 'Ms.', 'Guerin', 'showed', 'when', 'approaching', 'crime', 'lords', 'face', 'face', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'pull', 'least', 'Buffy', 'two', 'When', 'ask', 'cheeky', 'questions', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'better', 'have', 'big', 'bodyguard', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'yourself', 'had', 'way', 'invited', 'physical', 'abuse', 'herself.Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'put', 'down', 'Ms.', 'Guerin', 'real-life', 'accomplishment', 'terms', 'calling', 'attention', 'drug', 'problem', 'thus', 'starting', 'eradication', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'portrayed', 'film', 'was', 'doubt', 'meant', 'appear', 'strong', 'confident', 'passionate', 'cause', 'came', 'across', 'instead', 'headstrong', 'reckless', 'placing', 'family', 'life', 'jeopardy']",N/A

794726,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B000189LE2,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[4, 4]","Veronica Guerin, an Irish journalist and a woman of courage, was murdered in June 1996, at the age of 36, while conducting an investigative expose of drug lords in Dublin. Apparently Ms. Guerin's interrogatory tactics, investigative techniques and determination threatened her subjects more than the local police. She was shot dead at the wheel of her car by a hired killer on a motorcycle as a result of her persistence in discovering and writing the truth.Director Joel Schumacher's somber and factual bio-film portrays a woman who was determined to rid Dublin's streets of the pervasive drug dealing and heroin consumption so lethal to the city's youth. Ms. Guerin was repeatedly warned by her colleagues, underworld contacts and drug kingpins to back-off. She was shot in the leg and beaten in the line of duty. Her husband and young son were threatened and yet she persisted. Whether she was too reckless, too obsessed, is for the viewer to determine. However, her murder galvanized the Irish people to take to the streets and march against the criminal drug trade. Within a week of Ms. Guerin's death, during an emergency session of Parliament, the government passed a law to freeze the assets of suspected drug barons. The Irish Constitution was amended so that authorities could pursue drug-traffickers more aggressively. A Criminal Assets Bureau was created, as a result of her writing, (and her death), which has been aggressively confiscating money and property suspected of coming from criminal activities. Ireland's first witness protection program was formed to encourage informers to come forward. Her murderer was brought to trial, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.Cate Blanchett's gritty performance as Veronica Guerin is outstanding and she is the backbone of the film. Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, who plays informant John Traynor, does a superb job as he walks the line between the sympathetic informer with a tremendous ego, who is both Veronica's dubious ally and the vicious criminal who finally gives her up. Gerard McSorley excels as drug tzar John Gilligan. His presence is so terrifying and menacing that it's difficult to believe that Guerin did not back down immediately after listening to his graphic threats. I would have left the country after meeting him. Her relationships with other journalists, (those both friendly and critical of her work), the police, drug-dealers and their cohorts, prostitutes, and drug-addicts on the streets of Dublin provide some excellent entertainment and more insight into her feisty character.This film gives the viewer an exciting and thoughtful glimpse into politics and investigative journalism - just as &quot;All The President's Men&quot; did in the 1970s. Veronica Guerin is one of many reporters who gave their lives, and continue to do so, in pursuit of exposing injustices and crime in our society. This film commemorates the life and career of one woman but does serve to remind us of the many others who walk her path.

Veronica was a reporter for an Irish newspaper where she used to publish the results of her investigations .  The investigative reports by Veronica were often laughed upon by other reporters, but the articles were also feared by those who were investigated.  The truth had to be heard and Veronica was one of those brave souls that fought the war of injustice for those who could not through the power of the pen.  The story of Veronica is based on a true story and her courage will echo through time as others like her are committed to spread the word of truth.The story begins with Veronica (Cate Blanchett) being freed of charges as she had compiled a large number of speeding tickets.  Veronica exits the courthouse and begins her drive home while calling her mother and a police officer to let them know that she is back on the road.  When Veronica stops at a red light someone drives up next to her and crashes her window to her car.  This is followed by a flashback to what lead up to the current event as Veronica followed up on a lead regarding the excessive amount of heavy drugs on the streets of Dublin.The film depicts the dark side of Dublin before Veronica pushed the law enforcement into action.  This is told in one long flashback that leads up to the current moment in the film.

Seeing the movie made me want to better myself as a person and made me leave the theater believeing in the heroics of everyday people.Veronica Guerrin is a women that no one in Ireland will ever be able to forget... her courage, heroism, and death led to the change of Ireland's consitution. During the 80s and 70s Ireland was known for it's infamous drug lords, gangs, and drug thugs that virtually ran the streets of Dublin. Veronica Guerrin a well-known reporter for her stories on church scandals decides to take them on... writing about the people who sell drugs and the thugs that push them. Her decision takes a toll on her friendships, her family, and even herself... everyone discouraging her for the simple fact of fear. Veronica's family and friends have every reason to worry when the story is published and Veronica is shot at and recieves multiple death threats. Despite this- she still continues her crusade. Unfornately she ended up dying for her cause. Her death inspired politicans in Dublin to take action and right an anti- drug clause into the Irish constitution. Making this women a true hero for Ireland.It's amazing the impact of this movie... similiar to movies ""Schindler's List"" or ""Hotel Rwanda"" by the end of the movie you will have find yourself totally inspired and want to better yourself and the world around you. The final scene when Veronica was killed I couldn't help but cry... I still cry each time I watch it. It is a story that will stick in your heart long after you watch it...While many critics claim the movie will go on forgotten people fans of the person and the movie will stand by it. It makes you- wish you could change the world and the amazing thing about it is after hearing Veronica's story is you will believe you can- if you only take the time...

794733,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000189LE2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","On the off chance that you do not know what this film is about, &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; begins with the title character surviving a court date for parking and speeding tickets before her car is stopped at a light and two guys come along side on a motorcycle and knock out her window with a gun.  The actual assassination comes later, but clearly Veronica Guerin (Cate Blanchett) is going to get blown away, so when the film fades to black and we then find ourselves two years earlier, we understand that we will learn what who wanted this reporter dead and why.  In case we do not understand, there is a fair amount of background details provided on screen.For an American audience, at least, this 2003 film fits into an established genre, in which an intrepid reporter fights to get the story.  What is more difficult to appreciate is that when Guerin was killed in 1996 she was the first journalist murdered in Ireland.  That makes a difference because even though in this film Guerin is motivated by a mixture of outrage over young kids doing drugs and the desire to make a name as a journalist, one of the other defining elements is that she is rather reckless.  Even after she is shot, in the most serious of the early warnings for her to stop investigating the Dublin drug trade, you still have the feeling that she does not think anybody will go so far as to kill her.  Not because of the repercussions for crossing that line but more because nobody has ever done so before.  Indeed, before she is killed the worst thing that happens to her is not the savage beating administered by the drug kingpin, John Gilligan (Gerard McSorley), but rather his unveiled threat as to what he will do to her son.Still, it is possible to read Guerin's culpability in her own death as being due more to naivatee rather than any act of hubris, even though dismissing her police guard was obviously not a smart move.  Certainly family and business associates both try to disuadde her from from courting danger, but we know they do not make movies about reporters who give up, so Joel Schumacher's film is going to play out this drama to the end.  There are also aspects of libel laws in Ireland that force nicknames to be used for the major criminal figures, that have to be taken into account because it means having your name in the paper means something quiet different over there.  But still, our expectations for this genre overwhelm the unique qualities of this particular story, which gets played out by the numbers, including the requisite epilogue that serves to enumerate why Guerin's death was not in vain.  This is a good film, but given its subject matter you have to think it should have been more inspiring.One of the interesting aspects of this film from a cinematic perspective is that we have seen some of the characters and the story before.  Martin Cahill (Gerry O'Brien), the infamous &quot;General&quot; of Guerin's stories is the subject of John Boorman's 1994 film &quot;The General,&quot; with Brendan Gleeson as Cahill.  Then there is John Mackenzie's 2000 film &quot;When the Sky Falls,&quot; which fictionalizes this story as that of Sinead Hamilton, played by Joan Allen.  It seems &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; is the least regarded of the three, which speaks well for the other two films (which I intended to view shortly) in that this film is pretty good.  Blanchett's performance as Guerin is solid enough, and if she lost out on an Oscar nomination it might be because votes for her were split between this film and &quot;The Missing.&quot;",4,Cate Blanchett as the infamous murdered Irish journalist,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,3565,"['off', 'chance', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'quot', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'quot', 'title', 'character', 'surviving', 'court', 'date', 'parking', 'speeding', 'tickets', 'car', 'stopped', 'light', 'two', 'guys', 'come', 'along', 'side', 'motorcycle', 'knock', 'out', 'window', 'gun', 'actual', 'assassination', 'later', 'clearly', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'going', 'get', 'blown', 'away', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'black', 'then', 'find', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'understand', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'who', 'wanted', 'reporter', 'dead', 'why', 'case', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'fair', 'amount', 'background', 'details', 'provided', 'screen.For', 'American', 'audience', 'least', '2003', 'film', 'fits', 'established', 'genre', 'intrepid', 'reporter', 'fights', 'get', 'story', 'What', 'more', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'when', 'Guerin', 'was', 'killed', '1996', 'was', 'first', 'journalist', 'murdered', 'Ireland', 'difference', 'even', 'film', 'Guerin', 'motivated', 'mixture', 'outrage', 'young', 'kids', 'doing', 'drugs', 'desire', 'make', 'name', 'journalist', 'one', 'other', 'defining', 'elements', 'rather', 'reckless', 'Even', 'shot', 'most', 'serious', 'early', 'warnings', 'stop', 'investigating', 'Dublin', 'drug', 'trade', 'still', 'have', 'feeling', 'not', 'think', 'anybody', 'will', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'kill', 'Not', 'repercussions', 'crossing', 'line', 'more', 'nobody', 'ever', 'done', 'so', 'before', 'Indeed', 'killed', 'worst', 'thing', 'not', 'savage', 'beating', 'administered', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'John', 'Gilligan', 'Gerard', 'McSorley', 'rather', 'unveiled', 'threat', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'her', 'son.Still', 'possible', 'read', 'Guerin', 'culpability', 'own', 'death', 'being', 'due', 'more', 'naivatee', 'rather', 'act', 'hubris', 'even', 'dismissing', 'police', 'guard', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'smart', 'move', 'Certainly', 'family', 'business', 'associates', 'try', 'disuadde', 'courting', 'danger', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'movies', 'reporters', 'who', 'give', 'up', 'so', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'film', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'drama', 'end', 'are', 'also', 'aspects', 'libel', 'laws', 'Ireland', 'force', 'nicknames', 'be', 'used', 'major', 'criminal', 'figures', 'have', 'be', 'taken', 'account', 'having', 'name', 'paper', 'something', 'quiet', 'different', 'there', 'still', 'expectations', 'genre', 'unique', 'qualities', 'particular', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'numbers', 'including', 'requisite', 'epilogue', 'enumerate', 'why', 'Guerin', 'death', 'was', 'not', 'vain', 'good', 'film', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'have', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'inspiring.One', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'cinematic', 'perspective', 'have', 'seen', 'characters', 'story', 'Martin', 'Cahill', 'Gerry', ""O'Brien"", 'infamous', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'Guerin', 'stories', 'subject', 'John', 'Boorman', '1994', 'film', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Cahill', 'Then', 'John', 'Mackenzie', '2000', 'film', 'quot', 'When', 'Sky', 'Falls', 'quot', 'story', 'Sinead', 'Hamilton', 'played', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'quot', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'quot', 'least', 'regarded', 'three', 'well', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'intended', 'view', 'shortly', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'Blanchett', 'performance', 'Guerin', 'solid', 'enough', 'lost', 'out', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'might', 'be', 'votes', 'were', 'split', 'film', 'quot', 'Missing.', 'quot']",N/A

Its total immersion into the Irish culture and the cinematography make Ireland jump to life.  The universal thematic aspects of the film make it a timeless classic: a woman who fights for truth against the odds, the scourges of drugs, the lack of caring for the poor, and the feminist aspect of a female journalist in a man's world.  There is so much meat in this film that if it were a meal, it'd be a thick juicy steak.Schumacher's pacing for the film works well.  The film told in flashback allows the audience to prepare for the inevitable ending without the despair of tragedy, but with hope engendered by courage and bravery.  Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Veronica is studied, heartfelt, and on the money.  Showing the woman with flaws and all emphasizes the reality of the piece.  The DVD sequence of the deleted scene of Blanchett as Veronica receiving an award and then the replay of the real-life Veronica Guerin receiving the same award demonstrates how fine a portrayal Blanchett has accomplished.The Irish supporting cast offer fine performances by Brenda Fricker as the mother, Gerry O'Brien as Martin Cahill, Alan Devine as &quot;the monk,&quot; Ciaran Hinds (The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover &amp; Lara Croft Tomb Raider) as John Traynor and Gerald McSorley's chilling John Gilligan.  Colin Farrell who Schumacher directed in &quot;Tigerland&quot; &amp; &quot;Phone Booth&quot; has an excellent cameo that is essential to the plot.The biographical nature of the film married to its great theatricality makes this essential viewing for those who like their cinema well done.

Even though she won no award, Blanchett infuses Veronica Guerin with a smoldering passion, a strong sense of commitment and perseverance, and a loving mother and wife, whose actions endanger all of them, but she sticks to it.  Cate has so many moments of excellence, one can't really elucidate on them without going on and on; suffice to say, Cate is magnificent.Director Joel Schumacher leaves his action film techniques behind and crafts an envigorating yet sad film.  Blanchett is supported by a tremendous cast:  Gerard McSorney as John Gilligan is one of the most vile characters on celluloid and McSorney's performance is frightening and powerful.  The scene where he attacks Veronica and beats her to a pulp is one of the most disturbing scenes I've witnessed in a long time.  Ciaran Hinds (SUM OF ALL FEARS) is brilliant as Veronica's informant and eventual executioner.  One can see how he is torn and yet remains selfish enough to save his own hide.  Don Wycherley as police inspector Chris Mulligan hits the right note of being a good policeman and friend to the controversial Guerin; Brenda Fricker in a small role as Veronica's mother is good in a controlled, yet highly emotive performance; Barry Barnes as Veronica's husband is strong, supportive, yet frustrated at the possibility of losing his wife; Paudge Behan as the self proclaimed stud Barry is chilling in a small, yet effective performance; and of course, in a cameo role, Schumacher favorite Colin Farrell plays a tattooed young man whose one brief scene establishes the humanity of Guerin.VERONICA GUERIN doesn't really give us the whole story, but Cate Blanchett gives us her entire being in a riveting, gut-wrenching performance.Highly recommended.",5,THE MAGNIFICENT CATE,1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,2064,"['CATE', 'BLANCHETT', 'marvelous', 'actress', 'one', 'dexterity', 'playing', 'kind', 'role', 'e.g', 'THE', 'GIFT', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'elevate', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'class', 'actress.Cate', 'overwhelming', 'portrayal', 'journalist', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'nothing', 'brilliant', 'was', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'Oscar', 'who', 'usually', 'up', 'kind', 'performance', 'Even', 'won', 'award', 'Blanchett', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'smoldering', 'passion', 'strong', 'sense', 'commitment', 'perseverance', 'loving', 'mother', 'wife', 'actions', 'endanger', 'Cate', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'excellence', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'elucidate', 'going', 'suffice', 'say', 'Cate', 'magnificent.Director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'action', 'film', 'techniques', 'crafts', 'envigorating', 'yet', 'sad', 'film', 'Blanchett', 'supported', 'tremendous', 'cast', 'Gerard', 'McSorney', 'John', 'Gilligan', 'one', 'most', 'vile', 'characters', 'celluloid', 'McSorney', 'performance', 'frightening', 'powerful', 'scene', 'where', 'Veronica', 'pulp', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'long', 'time', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'brilliant', 'Veronica', 'informant', 'eventual', 'executioner', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'torn', 'yet', 'selfish', 'enough', 'save', 'own', 'hide', 'Don', 'Wycherley', 'police', 'inspector', 'Chris', 'Mulligan', 'right', 'note', 'being', 'good', 'policeman', 'friend', 'controversial', 'Guerin', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'small', 'role', 'Veronica', 'mother', 'good', 'controlled', 'yet', 'highly', 'emotive', 'performance', 'Barry', 'Barnes', 'Veronica', 'husband', 'strong', 'supportive', 'yet', 'frustrated', 'possibility', 'losing', 'wife', 'Paudge', 'Behan', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'stud', 'Barry', 'chilling', 'small', 'yet', 'effective', 'performance', 'course', 'cameo', 'role', 'Schumacher', 'favorite', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'tattooed', 'young', 'man', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'humanity', 'Guerin.VERONICA', 'GUERIN', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'whole', 'story', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'entire', 'being', 'riveting', 'gut-wrenching', 'performance.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Veronica Guerin,the Irish celebrated investigative journalist was such a person.The growing unchecked drugs situation that has plagued Ireland, and the tragic scenes she witnessed of young lives lost and the blatant exploitation by gangs, drove her relentlessly to expose the men behind it all.She meddled as a result with a very sinister and dark world the public at large was seldom aware of, and she paid a very hefty price for her unwanted intrusion.Yet her death which shocked the nation was certainly not in vain, for it pushed the government and the public to act swiftly for the first time against the drug dealers.It is only a pity that throughout history generally brave people had to sacrifice their lives for any change to occur.This is the story of the real Veronica Guerin and the film that faithfully tells her story.The success of the film does not solely rely on how touching, tragic and real the story of Veronica Guerin is and her lasting impact, but also on Schumacher's fine direction,by far his best film since Falling Down: totally sympathetic with his subject yet managing to his credit to avoid the trap of sentimentality such a film would easily fall into.Credit should also go to producer Bruckheimer,who is a rare breed of his kind ,equally concerned with the artistic quality of his picture as well as numbers and balance sheets.Veronica Guerin's success also is due to superb acting, especially Gerard McSorley and the wonderful Ciaran Hinds who has such a imposing and charismatic presence on screen..and of course there is Cate Blanchett.No one could have played the Irish fallen heroine better than her. Her performance is simply awesome, well researched and faithful.I don't know what it is with Aussie actresses and accents..why it is that they always perfect whatever accent they are talking with..From Nicole Kidman, Toni Colette, Naomi Watts, Judy Davis, and Ms Blanchett, who in Veronica Guerin speaks in a flawless Irish tongue.There are some very powerful scenes in the film that will totally captivate you, especially the confrontation  between Blanchett and the mob boss McSorley..it is sudden,shocking,and brutal, one you will not easily forget!The DVD extras are interesting as there is footage of the real Ms Guerin speaking about the problem of drugs, the threat she received and her pledge never to stop her personal crusade which is as touching to see as the film itself.Veronica Guerin is a must see film, one that you engage you and stay with you long after you watch it.It is a must buy, a very small and symbolic personal tribute from the viewer to one of those who dared to speak out.",5,A Gripping tribute to a Fallen Martyr,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,3152,"['did', 'not', 'know', 'better', 'going', 'see', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excused', 'guess', 'was', 'directed', 'politically', 'socially', 'sensitive', 'European', 'director', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'Jim', 'Sheridan.I', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'therefore', 'know', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'were', 'behind', 'such', 'masterpiece', 'realism', 'grittiness', 'powerful', 'tribute', 'rare', 'breed', 'humans', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'right', 'conscience', 'are', 'never', 'intimidated', 'even', 'paying', 'ultimate', 'price', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'Irish', 'celebrated', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'was', 'such', 'person.The', 'growing', 'unchecked', 'drugs', 'situation', 'plagued', 'Ireland', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'witnessed', 'young', 'lives', 'lost', 'blatant', 'exploitation', 'gangs', 'drove', 'relentlessly', 'expose', 'men', 'meddled', 'result', 'very', 'sinister', 'dark', 'world', 'public', 'large', 'was', 'seldom', 'aware', 'paid', 'very', 'hefty', 'price', 'unwanted', 'intrusion.Yet', 'death', 'shocked', 'nation', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'vain', 'pushed', 'government', 'public', 'act', 'swiftly', 'first', 'time', 'drug', 'dealers.It', 'only', 'pity', 'history', 'generally', 'brave', 'people', 'had', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'change', 'occur.This', 'story', 'real', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'film', 'faithfully', 'story.The', 'success', 'film', 'not', 'solely', 'rely', 'how', 'touching', 'tragic', 'real', 'story', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'lasting', 'impact', 'also', 'Schumacher', 'fine', 'direction', 'far', 'best', 'film', 'Falling', 'Down', 'totally', 'sympathetic', 'subject', 'yet', 'managing', 'credit', 'avoid', 'trap', 'sentimentality', 'film', 'would', 'easily', 'fall', 'into.Credit', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'producer', 'Bruckheimer', 'who', 'rare', 'breed', 'kind', 'equally', 'concerned', 'artistic', 'quality', 'picture', 'as', 'well', 'numbers', 'balance', 'sheets.Veronica', 'Guerin', 'success', 'also', 'due', 'superb', 'acting', 'especially', 'Gerard', 'McSorley', 'wonderful', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'who', 'imposing', 'charismatic', 'presence', 'screen..and', 'course', 'Cate', 'Blanchett.No', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Irish', 'fallen', 'heroine', 'better', 'performance', 'simply', 'awesome', 'well', 'researched', 'faithful.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Aussie', 'actresses', 'accents..why', 'always', 'perfect', 'accent', 'are', 'talking', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Ms', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'flawless', 'Irish', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'film', 'will', 'totally', 'captivate', 'especially', 'confrontation', 'Blanchett', 'mob', 'boss', 'McSorley..it', 'sudden', 'shocking', 'brutal', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'easily', 'forget', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'interesting', 'footage', 'real', 'Ms', 'Guerin', 'speaking', 'problem', 'drugs', 'threat', 'received', 'pledge', 'never', 'stop', 'personal', 'crusade', 'touching', 'see', 'film', 'itself.Veronica', 'Guerin', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'engage', 'stay', 'long', 'watch', 'it.It', 'must', 'buy', 'very', 'small', 'symbolic', 'personal', 'tribute', 'viewer', 'one', 'who', 'dared', 'speak', 'out']",N/A

794749,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000189LE2,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","A bit like an Irish version of ""Silkwood,"" ""Veronica Guerin"" is the true-life tale of a woman who was shot down in cold blood for daring to do the right thing.  No martyr by intent, Guerin was a Dublin newspaper journalist who, sickened by what she saw happening to the youth of her country at the hands of drug dealers and petty gangsters, wrote damning exposes of this criminal underworld in her columns, at great personal risk to her family and herself.  For that, Guerin ended up paying the ultimate price, but the city in which she lived and worked became a better place for her sacrifice.Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Joel Schumacher have wisely opted to tamp down their normally hurdy-gurdy filmmaking style, taking instead a straightforward, streamlined, almost too conventional an approach to the story.  This seems appropriate since the material itself is so compelling that any attempt to gussy it up with hyped-up editing techniques and high tech flash would be both dishonest to the facts and disrespectful to the woman at its core.  Cate Blanchett does a superb job inhabiting this character, displaying all the moral tenacity and hardheaded feistiness necessary to make us understand why Guerin does what he does.  The risk with a character like Guerin is that she will come across as too saintly on screen, but Blanchett and the filmmakers are careful to keep her life-sized and down-to-earth at all times.  In addition to her courage, idealism and inextinguishable determination to do what's moral and right, we also get to see her less admirable traits such as her abrasiveness and recklessness, as well as her most humanizing trait of all: her fear.  This allows the character to be both heroic and real at the same time.There are excellent supporting performances from Gerald McSorley, Carian Hinds and Brenda Flicker, as well as a rather pointless cameo appearance by Colin Farrell, whose name does not even appear in the final credits.  This sudden, unexpected appearance of a major star amidst this generally unfamiliar cast of first-rate character actors succeeds only in undercutting the verisimilitude of the piece.",4,compelling tale of a true life martyr,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2151,"['bit', 'Irish', 'version', 'Silkwood', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'true-life', 'tale', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'cold', 'blood', 'daring', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'martyr', 'intent', 'Guerin', 'was', 'Dublin', 'newspaper', 'journalist', 'who', 'sickened', 'what', 'saw', 'happening', 'youth', 'country', 'hands', 'drug', 'dealers', 'petty', 'gangsters', 'wrote', 'damning', 'exposes', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'columns', 'great', 'personal', 'risk', 'family', 'Guerin', 'ended', 'up', 'paying', 'ultimate', 'price', 'city', 'lived', 'worked', 'became', 'better', 'place', 'sacrifice.Producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'have', 'wisely', 'opted', 'tamp', 'down', 'normally', 'hurdy-gurdy', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'taking', 'instead', 'straightforward', 'streamlined', 'almost', 'too', 'conventional', 'approach', 'story', 'appropriate', 'material', 'so', 'compelling', 'attempt', 'gussy', 'up', 'hyped-up', 'editing', 'techniques', 'high', 'tech', 'flash', 'would', 'be', 'dishonest', 'facts', 'disrespectful', 'woman', 'core', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'superb', 'job', 'inhabiting', 'character', 'displaying', 'moral', 'tenacity', 'hardheaded', 'feistiness', 'necessary', 'make', 'understand', 'why', 'Guerin', 'what', 'risk', 'character', 'Guerin', 'will', 'come', 'too', 'saintly', 'screen', 'Blanchett', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'careful', 'keep', 'life-sized', 'down-to-earth', 'times', 'addition', 'courage', 'idealism', 'inextinguishable', 'determination', 'do', 'what', 'moral', 'right', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'less', 'admirable', 'traits', 'such', 'abrasiveness', 'recklessness', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'humanizing', 'trait', 'fear', 'character', 'be', 'heroic', 'real', 'same', 'are', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Gerald', 'McSorley', 'Carian', 'Hinds', 'Brenda', 'Flicker', 'as', 'well', 'rather', 'pointless', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'name', 'not', 'even', 'appear', 'final', 'credits', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'appearance', 'major', 'star', 'amidst', 'generally', 'unfamiliar', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'character', 'actors', 'only', 'undercutting', 'verisimilitude', 'piece']",N/A

I remember hearing about the execution-style killing of Veronica Guerin on the evening news and my heart ached for this senseless killing. Now with the aid of this film individuals can learn the story behind the life and career of Veronica that ultimately led to her premature death.After witnessing the horrific effects of heroin use on teenagers and children in a rundown housing complex veteran reporter Veronica Guerin decides to refocus her attention on the prevalence of crime in Dublin. Outraged that nobody is covering the drug trade she jumps headfirst into this underground economy and doesn't hesitate to immediately make some powerful enemies. Cruising around in her bright red car through the Dublin streets Veronica fails to back down even after her life is repeatedly threatened and she is brutally attacked. Even the pleading of her family and her work colleagues fail to change her mind.It is encouraging to know that the efforts of Veronica Guerin were not in vain. Her journalistic accounts of Dublin's drug trade and her subsequent unsympathetic murder has resulted in the passing of several laws such as stripping the assets of suspected drug dealers.

Then, the action goes back and starts revealing how the journalist got to that point. Veronica Guerin was a journalist that felt empty when writing casual and non-critical articles, so when she is assigned to the crime section, she finds a cause she can embrace. In Ireland, the drug trade has driven crimes rates to a record high, and a myriad of youngsters are living in the streets, having only one desire...to get high. Veronica's quest consists in connecting the drugs to the crime lords and bring the organization down. To do this she starts relentlessly pursuing these dangerous people and gets her family and herself into dangerous situations. &quot;The Monk&quot;, &quot;The Coach&quot; and &quot;The General&quot;, among others, are getting nervous.While watching this movie you will find yourself cheering for the heroine, and getting worried and scared for what may happen to her and her family. Cate Blanchett has a stellar performance, which makes the character even more likable. This actress focuses a good part of her time on plays, but I would really love if she decided to devote a larger part of her time to movies, which is what I usually have access to.",5,Uplifting and sad at the same time,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,1923,"['movie', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'Irish', 'journalist', 'Sunday', 'Independent', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'uplifting', 'sad', 'unison', 'found', 'amazed', 'courage', 'shown', 'woman', 'facing', 'organized', 'crime', 'Ireland', 'fighting', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'exposing', 'people', 'other', 'side', 'sad', 'know', 'quest', 'had', 'nefarious', 'results', 'family', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'knowing', 'events', 'really', 'happened', 'lifts', 'level', 'me.The', 'movie', 'shooting', 'Veronica', 'out', 'court', 'where', 'was', 'facing', 'charges', 'twelve', 'hundred', 'parking', 'violations', 'couple', 'speeding', 'tickets', 'going', 'one', 'hundred', 'miles', 'hour', 'Then', 'action', 'back', 'revealing', 'how', 'journalist', 'got', 'point', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'was', 'journalist', 'felt', 'empty', 'when', 'writing', 'casual', 'non-critical', 'articles', 'so', 'when', 'assigned', 'crime', 'section', 'cause', 'can', 'embrace', 'Ireland', 'drug', 'trade', 'driven', 'crimes', 'rates', 'record', 'high', 'myriad', 'youngsters', 'are', 'living', 'streets', 'having', 'only', 'one', 'desire', 'get', 'high', 'Veronica', 'quest', 'connecting', 'drugs', 'crime', 'lords', 'bring', 'organization', 'down', 'do', 'relentlessly', 'pursuing', 'dangerous', 'people', 'family', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'quot', 'Monk', 'quot', 'quot', 'Coach', 'quot', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'others', 'are', 'getting', 'nervous.While', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'cheering', 'heroine', 'getting', 'worried', 'scared', 'what', 'may', 'happen', 'family', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'stellar', 'performance', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'likable', 'actress', 'good', 'part', 'time', 'plays', 'would', 'really', 'love', 'decided', 'devote', 'larger', 'part', 'time', 'movies', 'what', 'usually', 'have', 'access']",N/A

794754,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000189LE2,Stephanie De Pue,"[7, 9]","""Veronica Guerin"" (2003), a biographical/true crime/drama/thriller, is set in recent times in Dublin, Ireland, tells an Irish story, has a largely Irish cast, but appears to have been largely American-made.  And that's only one of the puzzling things about this movie.  Story and screenplay are credited to Carol Doyle; direction is by Joel Schumacher; Jerry Bruckheimer, with his typical largesse - the brightest colors, and the most possible action-- gets the production credit.  The film received one Golden Globes nomination.The movie plays like a hagiography of its title character, (Cate Blanchett), a crusading journalist, determined to wipe out the Dublin drug trade. Brenda Fricker plays her worried mother, Bernie Guerin.  For the other side, Gerald McSorley gives us a chilling portrait of gangster boss John Gilligan; Ciaran Hinds, a seedy street level thug, John Traynor.  (From the tough, hard-edged performances given us by these gentlemen, it seems possible that a quiet class antagonism underlies some of the violence in the picture.)  Further, Colin Farrell turns up in a brief cameo as a tattooed young man, without billing, who knows why.Blanchett, remarkable cheekbones and all, gives us an intense, highly watchable performance as Guerin.  Is she too pretty for the character?  Too delicately made?  How true is the movie to life?  That's puzzling, too.  The film seems to portray its leading character as reckless to a foolhardy degree.  She's a daughter, a sister, a wife, and the mother of a young child, yet she ignores threats on her life, and the child's, an actual beating, and a gun-shot wound.  (The film opens with her assassination; so I don't think I can be spoiling it for anyone by discussing it.)  We have recently developed the concept of ""suicide by cop;"" that is, a person has had enough of it all but hasn't the courage to pull the trigger and end it.  So he creates a situation in which a cop will have to do it.  Seemed to me Guerin was almost going for ""suicide by gangster,"" creating confrontations with people she knew to be violent.Her assassination does lead to hearings held, laws changed, ill-gotten gains confiscated, perhaps a dozen men imprisoned, and a blip in the drug trade.  For that, she paid a high price, as did her family.  On a quite recent trip to Ireland, several people mentioned, without prompting, that the drug problem among the youth of the country is still severe.  Observers might think that this drug use is caused by widespread social problems the country has yet to solve, and that, where there's a market, ways will be found to supply it.",3,Troubling Hagiographic Bio-Pic,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,2613,"['Veronica', 'Guerin', '2003', 'biographical/true', 'crime/drama/thriller', 'set', 'recent', 'times', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'Irish', 'story', 'largely', 'Irish', 'cast', 'have', 'been', 'largely', 'American-made', 'only', 'one', 'puzzling', 'things', 'movie', 'Story', 'screenplay', 'are', 'credited', 'Carol', 'Doyle', 'direction', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'typical', 'largesse', 'brightest', 'colors', 'most', 'possible', 'action', 'production', 'credit', 'film', 'received', 'one', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'nomination.The', 'movie', 'plays', 'hagiography', 'title', 'character', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'crusading', 'journalist', 'determined', 'wipe', 'out', 'Dublin', 'drug', 'trade', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'worried', 'mother', 'Bernie', 'Guerin', 'other', 'side', 'Gerald', 'McSorley', 'chilling', 'portrait', 'gangster', 'boss', 'John', 'Gilligan', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'seedy', 'street', 'level', 'thug', 'John', 'Traynor', 'tough', 'hard-edged', 'performances', 'given', 'gentlemen', 'possible', 'quiet', 'class', 'antagonism', 'violence', 'picture', 'Further', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'up', 'brief', 'cameo', 'tattooed', 'young', 'man', 'billing', 'who', 'why.Blanchett', 'remarkable', 'cheekbones', 'intense', 'highly', 'watchable', 'performance', 'Guerin', 'too', 'pretty', 'character', 'Too', 'delicately', 'made', 'How', 'true', 'movie', 'life', 'puzzling', 'too', 'film', 'portray', 'leading', 'character', 'reckless', 'foolhardy', 'degree', 'daughter', 'sister', 'wife', 'mother', 'young', 'child', 'threats', 'life', 'child', 'actual', 'beating', 'gun-shot', 'wound', 'film', 'assassination', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'be', 'spoiling', 'anyone', 'discussing', 'have', 'recently', 'developed', 'concept', 'suicide', 'cop', 'person', 'had', ""n't"", 'courage', 'pull', 'trigger', 'end', 'situation', 'cop', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'Seemed', 'Guerin', 'was', 'almost', 'going', 'suicide', 'gangster', 'creating', 'confrontations', 'people', 'knew', 'be', 'violent.Her', 'assassination', 'lead', 'hearings', 'held', 'laws', 'changed', 'ill-gotten', 'gains', 'confiscated', 'perhaps', 'dozen', 'men', 'imprisoned', 'blip', 'drug', 'trade', 'paid', 'high', 'price', 'did', 'family', 'quite', 'recent', 'trip', 'Ireland', 'several', 'people', 'mentioned', 'prompting', 'drug', 'problem', 'youth', 'country', 'still', 'severe', 'Observers', 'might', 'think', 'drug', 'use', 'caused', 'widespread', 'social', 'problems', 'country', 'yet', 'solve', 'where', 'market', 'ways', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'supply']",N/A

794758,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B000189LE2,Timothy Michael Resh,"[3, 8]","I sat down to watch VG last night with no expectations and very little information about the film or the subject, only having seen a trailer or two and knowing that the classy and beautiful Cate Blanchett was the star.  I knew that I was in trouble when the words, ""Directed by Joel Schumacher"" flashed up in the credits--as in, the man who destroyed the Batman franchise with blacklit motorcycle gangs and a [appealing] batsuit.Neither Blanchett or Schumacher disappointed.  Blanchett was brilliant, and Schumacher was terrible.  The storytelling in the film followed a basic chronology, and failed to captialize on the great emotional depth of Guerin's struggle with journalistic integrity over self-interest.  Some of the most intensely emotional moments are glossed over in favor of multiple angle transitional shots of Guerin's red sportscar zipping through the countryside.It was getting late as I watched this, and after about an hour of slogging along through Schumacher's shabby storytelling, began to fast forward the DVD to get to the conclusion.  The only thing that makes this vulgar and violent film remotely watchable is Blanchett.  Even the ""coda"" section that describes the positive measures that VG's work precipitated is done in an unenthusiastic, disinterested voiceover.  Without Blanchett's excellent performance, no one would have noticed this film, which is troubling considering that it is a tribute to a courageous journalist.Speaking of the real VG, there is some nice archival footage of her speaking at an awards banquet.  Strangely, the parallel scene in the film is the one deleted scene included on the disc.

794759,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000189LE2,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","If I give four stars to this film, that's simply because of Cate Blanchett.  The story of Veronica Gurerin, who was killed during the determined jounalistic jobs about drug business, has been already covered in a thinly disguised version &quot;When the Sky Falls&quot; (with Joan Allen), but to be frank with you, this &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; could be much better with another director and producer.  Why Joel Shumacher and Jerry Bruckheimer?The story is smoothly told, with a good opening sequence, but you can't expect a &quot;bio-pic&quot; in &quot;Veronica Guerrin,&quot; in which you are shown not many things that would tell us about the inner life of her.  Veronica, writer for the Sunday Independent, begins her crusade against the drug lord in Dublin, who is responsible for the appalling conditions of the life of the kids there.  As she goes on, she is threatened by unseen forces, possibly the henchmen of the underworld, but she stubbornly keeps on her course until she meets the inevitable result.Cate Blanchett's superb acting (Golden Globe nominated) almost hides it, but what the film's screenplay offers is treated with Shumacher's by-the-number direction.  I really hate the moment, for instance, in which the camera lingers on the bloody crime scene, as if to put emphasis on the tragic nature of the story, in the worst Hollywood fashion.  We can easily feel, from Cate's perfect acting (with perfect Irish accent), the magnitude of what she did, and what happened to her.  So, why not leave it to her?The villainous acting of Ciaran Hinds (&quot;Persuation&quot;) is also great, but his character also suffers from too familiar elements seen in many crime films.  These two leading actors are so compelling that you forget and forgive the fact the film fails to explain the inaptitude of the laws and the police (which &quot;When the Sky Falls&quot; showed), the very thing the death of the jounalist ironically revealed to the public.With beautifuly shot locations, &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; is another showcase for Cate Blanchett's incredible acting talent.  (And you get an amusing cameo from the star of &quot;Phone Booth&quot;)  But after watching it (and that ride was pretty fast), I still couldn't understand why she risked her life, and possibly her family, in order to uncover the story.  I still couldn't see why some of other journalists, as this film shows us, while drinking in the bar, tell us that they don't like Veronica or her jobs.  Most importantly, why did she act alone when she knows it's very dangerous?  There MUST be another story, perhaps a better one, hiding in the answers to these questions.  Unfortunately (for me, I say) the director didn't think about that possibilty, even though I know the film is not obliged to do it.",4,(In fact 3.5)Superb Cate Blanchett Redeems Unfulfilled Story,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,2783,"['give', 'four', 'stars', 'film', 'simply', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'story', 'Veronica', 'Gurerin', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'determined', 'jounalistic', 'jobs', 'drug', 'business', 'been', 'already', 'covered', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'version', 'quot', 'When', 'Sky', 'Falls', 'quot', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'be', 'frank', 'quot', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'quot', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'director', 'producer', 'Why', 'Joel', 'Shumacher', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'story', 'smoothly', 'told', 'good', 'opening', 'sequence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'quot', 'bio-pic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Veronica', 'Guerrin', 'quot', 'are', 'shown', 'not', 'many', 'things', 'would', 'tell', 'inner', 'life', 'Veronica', 'writer', 'Sunday', 'Independent', 'crusade', 'drug', 'lord', 'Dublin', 'who', 'responsible', 'appalling', 'conditions', 'life', 'kids', 'there', 'threatened', 'unseen', 'forces', 'possibly', 'henchmen', 'underworld', 'stubbornly', 'course', 'inevitable', 'result.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'superb', 'acting', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominated', 'almost', 'what', 'film', 'screenplay', 'offers', 'treated', 'Shumacher', 'by-the-number', 'direction', 'really', 'hate', 'moment', 'instance', 'camera', 'bloody', 'crime', 'scene', 'put', 'emphasis', 'tragic', 'nature', 'story', 'worst', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'can', 'easily', 'feel', 'Cate', 'perfect', 'acting', 'perfect', 'Irish', 'accent', 'magnitude', 'what', 'did', 'what', 'happened', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'leave', 'her', 'villainous', 'acting', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'quot', 'Persuation', 'quot', 'also', 'great', 'character', 'also', 'too', 'familiar', 'elements', 'seen', 'many', 'crime', 'films', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'compelling', 'forget', 'forgive', 'fact', 'film', 'explain', 'inaptitude', 'laws', 'police', 'quot', 'When', 'Sky', 'Falls', 'quot', 'showed', 'very', 'thing', 'death', 'jounalist', 'ironically', 'revealed', 'public.With', 'beautifuly', 'shot', 'locations', 'quot', 'Veronica', 'Guerin', 'quot', 'showcase', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'incredible', 'acting', 'talent', 'get', 'amusing', 'cameo', 'star', 'quot', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'quot', 'watching', 'ride', 'was', 'pretty', 'fast', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'risked', 'life', 'possibly', 'family', 'order', 'uncover', 'story', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'other', 'journalists', 'film', 'drinking', 'bar', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Veronica', 'jobs', 'Most', 'importantly', 'why', 'did', 'act', 'alone', 'when', 'very', 'dangerous', 'MUST', 'be', 'story', 'perhaps', 'better', 'one', 'hiding', 'answers', 'questions', 'Unfortunately', 'say', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'possibilty', 'even', 'know', 'film', 'not', 'obliged', 'do']",N/A
