They got excited when they began seeing balloon characters they recognized. Then I watched it with extended family over the Thanksgiving holiday and everyone from the 1 and 1/2 year old to the 70+ year-old enjoyed it. There is amazing footage of early parades as well as behind the scenes shots of modern parades. The pace and the voice over are lively, which helps hold your interest. Well worth the price.",5,The Kids Liked It Too,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,477,"['showed', 'second/third', 'grade', 'class', 'were', 'enthalled', 'got', 'excited', 'when', 'began', 'seeing', 'balloon', 'characters', 'recognized', 'Then', 'watched', 'extended', 'family', 'Thanksgiving', 'holiday', 'everyone', '1', '1/2', 'year', 'old', '70+', 'year-old', 'enjoyed', 'amazing', 'footage', 'early', 'parades', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'shots', 'modern', 'parades', 'pace', 'voice', 'are', 'lively', 'hold', 'interest', 'Well', 'price']",Inside Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade
