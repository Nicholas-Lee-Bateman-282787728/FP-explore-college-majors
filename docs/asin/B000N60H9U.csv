After collecting the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy, and both volumes of the ""Spin City"" DVD's, this collection was an economical way to expand her back catalog of films Michael J. Fox has starred in.4 movies for under $15 ?  How can you go wrong?  One can only hope that someday soon ""Light Of Day"", the movie he starred in with Joan Jett will be made available on DVD. That, and the entire ""Spin City"" series.

1053885,A24F1UX8ZT5IXY,B000N60H9U,C.J. Hustwick,"[0, 3]","There can be little doubt that one film is at the center of the entire set -- and that is ""The Secret of my Success"" (no one's going to be shelling out a nickel in 2012 for any of these other movies). It's essentially ""Marty McFly goes to the big city"", where a cute, well-meaning, eternally optimistic kid takes on the world and comes out winning. It is one of the signature films of the decade and was a monster hit for Michael J. Fox, not to mention a film I watched many times growing up. It's a huge guilty pleasure.What we have hear is an energetic, sporadically funny, consistently corny, Pepsi-fied comedy that was the perfect vehicle for the maturing Alex P. Keaton. And let's face it, twenty-five years ago there were very few cities that could even begin to compete with New York as far as energy, skyscrapers, and all the rest -- and as contrived as this film is it actually is a great love letter to an amazing and challenging city. Many of the little vignettes are pulled straight from situations from my life moving there from Oregon -- although they are totally glossed over as one might expect. Others are just cheesy. Still, my first real job in Manhattan after graduating from NYU was working in the bowels of a law firm in the Met Life building (a couple of blocks away from where this was shot), sorting through stacks of paper and delivering letters to people upstairs. This part of the film is superficially accurate (although Fox's mailroom comrade-in-arms has to deliver some of the worst lines ever spoken in a major motion picture).But as is so often the case in movies like this one -- problems start arising in the second act. This is where Brantley (Fox) starts to hatch his ridiculously conceived, preposterously executed, highly unethical, and mostly unfunny plan to impersonate a corporate executive. Brantley's assuming the identity of ""Carleton Whitfield"" is nothing short of corporate espionage and requires the utmost stupidity of the characterless ""suits"" who populate the film to work. Umm... and in New York (and most everywhere else) you don't get to just ""disappear"" from your regular job for hours at a time during the day -- if that were the case then management would quickly figure out the gaping hole in its budget and the overstaffing would be eliminated posthaste. Obviously, many a screwball comedy of yesteryear was built on such flimsy premises but TSOMS isn't clever enough to pull this off with much style -- so Michael J. saves the day time and again with his likability and charisma -- so much that he didn't leave much ""Mr. Cute"" in the bank for subsequent outings. The little shot where he breezes past the cubicle of a pretty girl, then doubles back, peeking around the partition and says ""good morning"" with a little eyebrow raise was played over and over and over on cable lead-ins. Looks like M.J.F. also was obviously hitting the weight machine OT because we get lots and lots of gratuitous nudity from him throughout -- including a shameless muscle flex in the elevator which he must have LOVED.Where things get just agonizing is in the third act -- where Brantley wins over the titans of the financial markets and engineers a hostile takeover of a multinational corporation. It's all in good fun I suppose -- but it's also some of the weakest filmmaking you're ever likely to see. Basically, in the absolute worst 1980s tradition, this entire sequence is put to David Foster music and we don't even hear one exchange between Brantley and these men! It's beyond cheesy and simply moronic. So for the entire film all we hear about is how Brantley want to make it big, and that he's some kind of business genius, and that's he's just a good guy who wants to save jobs. What a load of BS... and the movie pretty much makes us buy it hook line and sinker -- up until the end when everyone gets to wear tuxes and has ""conquered"" the city. The thing is that the film actually DOES spend about half of its running time trying to make Fox's scheme believable -- it's just too bad they cheap out on any of the key encounters and details. It's pure bubble gum.But the film is still enjoyable -- and is helped tremendously by the late, great Richard Jordan as the CEO of the company. Jordan was one of America's finest actors and stole the show from everyone a couple of years later in ""The Hunt For Red October"".  Here, he plays the consummate New York jerk and is a truly intimidating presence on screen. I love, love, love Richard Jordan and the film is worth watching for him alone. Margaret Whitton also gets in a lot of good lines as the CEO's wife, and it's nice to see her treated as the gorgeous woman she was / is rather than play second banana to Kim Bassinger as she had to in 9 1/2 Weeks. Unfortunately, the sweet but untalented actress, Helen Slater, once again proved she was unsuited to carry a movie. She seems like a nice enough person, and I am a Supergirl fan (where's the sequel?!), but yikes... take come night classes at the Actor's Studio, lady!In the end, this is a silly movie which totally glosses over the brutal realities of New York, and can even be seen as something of an apologia for Wall Street scumbags. It's the anti-Wall Street (which came out the year before). Fleabag apartments really aren't that funny -- they frequently involve disease-carrying rodents, cockroach infestations, illegal subleases, violent neighbors, and the loss of one's sanity. Long Island wives and corporate executives rarely are as stupid or have the hearts of gold that are portrayed here. Brantley would more than likely have wound up in jail. And other than the comically ""mean"" boss in the mailroom, Michael J. pretty much skates around a group of the most benign New Yorkers one could ever hope to encounter. Ah yes, TSOMS It's a great piece of '80s capitalist propaganda and part of the world I grew up in.",3,The Secret of My Success,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,5878,"['can', 'be', 'little', 'doubt',

1053888,AY12DBB0U420B,B000N60H9U,Gary Peterson,"[3, 5]","Michael J. Fox is a pleasant and personable chap and I've seen him on TV a few times recently, but I had never seen any of his movies. As such, I found a ""Michael J. Fox Comedy Favorites Collection"" on the bargain rack at my local Ross Store and I picked it up. Four movies resided in a nicely presented packet of three CDs (two movies were on one of the CDs). I've been viewing them as late-night entertainment over the past few weeks. I have mixed feelings about the packet. All the movies have high production values, I should add. And Michael J. Fox has a large following of fans. I just didn't care all that much for the movies, especially two of them. I reviewed all of the movies under their individual titles and this review is for the total package.""The Hard Way"" was one of the Funnier selections. Fox played a TV tough-guy cop (somewhat like Dirty Harry) who needed to get his act brightened up and paired with a real live Dirty-Harry-Style NYC detective, much to the detectives disgust. It had it's humorous moments. Perhaps the best of the movies was ""Greed"" in which Fox teamed up with Kirk Douglas in an examination of family values. It was funny, but also half serious. I saw both of these movies as being four-star rated. ""The Secret Of My Success"" had Fox as a mail-room boy who manipulated himself into the upper corporate ranks. It just wasn't believable. ""For Love or Money"" had Fox as an upper-scale hotel concierge. This movie lacked believability also. In these latter two movies. the last third of the movies really dragged and I had trouble finishing them. I rated them as threes and twos. All in all, the movie set was a mixed experience and I doubt that I would buy further Fox DVDs, although he certainly has a large contingent of fans who enjoy his offerings.Gary Peterson",3,"A Mixed Experience.
