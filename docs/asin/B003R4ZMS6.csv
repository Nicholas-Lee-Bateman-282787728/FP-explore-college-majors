I have seen three episodes of this show and it is getting better and better.  Kathy, played by Laura Linney, has stage 4 melanoma cancer and has been given a year to live.  Linney does an excellent job with this role.  She has a radical change in perspective and especially in the way she has been spending her time.  Everyone handles cancer in his or her own way and her way is believable.She separates from her husband because he has been draining her and now she has no more time to waste on being drained by someone else.  She doesn't tell him of her cancer so he is completely baffled as to why his juvenile antics don't amuse her anymore.  She has one son at home, a teenager, and suddenly she has no more patience with his antics either.  She is determined to help him grow up in a hurry. She hasn't told him yet either about her cancer.Four other characters are the best support though.  One is her black student with a huge overweight problem.  Kathy sets about saving her life.  This is the actress who was in ""Precious"" and she does a wonderful job. The other is her brother, a guy who lives homeless by choice and is crusading against everything. The third is her cranky neighbor who slowly becomes her best friend for the coming ordeal.

Gilmore ""Mad Modeler""","[0, 2]","My wife recently endured ""The Big C"" herself in real life and wanted to see this show, so I bought the first season for her to view.  Having gone through her ordeal with her (and thus being labeled a ""caretaker""...who really took care of whom?, is my question) I sat down and watched these DVDs with her.  This is a very entertaining series!  Bravo, ShowTime, for creating a great show!  However, this woman has problems.  She's in denial, she wants no one to help her, she doesn't want other people to know about her condition...the exact opposite of what my wife endured.  My wife let EVERYBODY know that she had cancer, and as a result friends and family came rushing to her aid; her support group meant everything to her and made her ordeal that much easier to handle.  Three years later she's not only a survivor, and meaner than ever at that (I'm proud to say that I'm back to getting my much deserved weekly beatings), but she's an advocate for other cancer patients who do not have the friends and family to support them in their time of need.  Perhaps the moral of this series is that no one can suffer the disease alone...everyone needs a support group...and by denying her condition to herself and others she's doing herself a disservice.

1360693,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003R4ZMS6,Grady Harp,"[32, 41]","THE BIG C started this week as a Showtime series for television opposite the controversial WEEDS in the late evening, subjects for mature audiences time slot.  Most viewers will have mixed feelings about this first episode, so loaded with new characters with whom we have little time to understand, all edgy, and yet all surrounded by the unifying theme of how one woman deals with being told she has Stage 4 Malignant Melanoma but who decides to not inform anyone of her diagnosis, instead going after the outrageous way of living that has always been foreign to her obsessive/compulsive teacher personality.There are few actresses who could pull this off: Laura Linney, one of our finest actresses on the screen today, is the perfect choice for making this unbelievable character credible AND charismatic.  As Cathy Jamison, she is married to a bumbling irresponsible joker Paul (Oliver Platt, again an actor in the top echelon) who is currently out of the house over some disagreement with Cathy, and is mother to naughty boy Adam (Gabriel Basso), lives across the street from a elderly curmudgeon Marlene (Phyllis Somerville) with whom Cathy finally agrees to accept and to like, is a sister to a freaky psycho brother Sean (John Benjamin Hickey), is attended by her diagnosing just-fresh-out-of-residency naive physician Dr Todd (Reid Scott), and carries on teaching a classroom with bored students, including one sassy, arrogant and overweight Andrea (Gabourey Sidibe).  Life is full of surprises and they pop by so quickly that we barely can tell where the series is going.  As for this viewer, though not impressed with the structure of the show, staying around for the pleasure of watching Linney and Platt will be worth it - hopefully!

A Bowen ""tabithajab""","[6, 12]","Cathy Jamison (Laura Linney) is a Midwestern,  middle-class, somewhat jaded teacher whose life is coasting along in neutral (except that she's recently thrown out her Peter-Pan syndrome husband Paul -- the always likable Oliver Platt -- for his frat boy histrionics) -- when she finds out she has stage 4 malignant melanoma.Much has already been written about the somewhat infuriating way Cathy's reaction to this news plays out in the series.  We are given to believe that a wife and loving mother would be able to keep a secret of such magnitude to herself.  All of the characters surrounding Cathy -- her self-righteous homeless brother Sean (John Benjamin Hickey), her spoiled but very vulnerable son Adam, her pining husband -- accept her extremely strange, out-of-character behavior with a little more than a scratch of the head and a shrug of the shoulders. Her handsome young doctor, who breaks all kinds of ethical boundaries in his relationship with Cathy, tries desperately to get her to tell her loved ones, even as she pushes away all thought of treatment because ""I've always really loved my hair.""  Here is where the series really pushes the bounds of believability.  Any mother who loved her child as much as Cathy appears to would, I believe, try just a tad harder to bargain for more time.Even with all these gigantic flaws, somehow the series works.  Again, the ensemble cast does a terrific job.  Some of the characters are a little too stock-sitcom-like, with her neighbor Marlene (Phyllis Somerville) as a crusty old lady fighting Alzheimer's and her student Andrea (Gabourey Sibide)coming to mind here.Idris Elba has a guest-starring role as a sexy painter, and this is the best I've seen him since ""The Wire.""  Cynthia Dixon also appears as Cathy's long-lost college friend, and she is as keyed-up and hard to take as Miranda was in ""Sex and the City"", albeit in a different way.But I find the series to be entertaining and of course, Linney is top-notch in the role.  While most of the cable series push the boundaries of reality, this one may be one that pushes it the hardest.  Take a large dose of literary license, sit back, and enjoy the ride.

All the characters are pretty awful and unpleasant and elicit absolutely no sympathy.

1360702,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003R4ZMS6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 3]","There is no show that I thought had more promise than ""The Big C."" The premise is spot-on compelling, the cast impressive, and Laura Linney is one of the greats! And while I found the first episodes a bit chaotic, I held out hope. With Linney as the centerpiece, there was no way ""The Big C"" could fail. As the show progressed, however, there became less and less consistency, more and more lunacy, and a complete lack of believability that chilled my goodwill beyond reason. I expect I'll get all kinds of negative feedback for this commentary, but I watch and enjoy all of Showtime's female centric comedies--""Weeds"" (once great, but struggling creatively), ""Nurse Jackie"" (solid, if somewhat overpraised), and ""The United States of Tara"" (uneven, but improving)--and ""The Big C"" definitely stands out in comparison, but not in a good way. Contrived for maximum ""hilarity,"" its over-the-top antics were almost unbearable in their preciousness.It's difficult to be critical of ""The Big C"" because there are some viewers that will inherently embrace its very real emotional core. However, I contend that the show uses the concept but doesn't develop it beyond slapstick shenanigans. That might even be fine if the show was humorous (it tries more often than not for shock) and the characters were likable or even remotely believable. Not so. Linney plays a uptight wife and mother who discovers she has cancer. Her decision, initially, is to keep the secret, resist treatment, and live out her remaining time embracing life. This has the potential to be so funny and so moving--neither word would I use to describe ""The Big C.""As control-freak Linney, from episode one, starts behaving completely against type (so we're told)--no one really even notices. Her husband, son, and brother continuously reference this straight laced character she was, but don't seem to acknowledge that she's flipped her lid. Maybe they're too busy playing over-the-top quirk (as every character hails from the planet of Quirk) to notice. Oliver Platt, as her husband, is fun--but his character is so inconsistent that you never identify him as real or their relationship as sustainable. There is also a sassy student (Gabourey Sidibe) and a wacky neighbor (Phyllis Somerville) on hand to spar with Linney. They don't ground the action--they just increase the nuttiness. Somerville, a great actress, is particularly stranded. Some weeks she is emotional support, other times crazy as a loon (she went from being violently racist one week to hugging a homeless person the next). Which leaves the most obnoxious and unbelievable character yet--Linney's brother (John Benjamin Hickey, another good actor) as a homeless activist. Hickey may just be saddled with one of the most patently ridiculous characters on TV.This leaves Linney. As the heart and soul of the show, she starts out as the solid center. But as the episodes progress, she devolves like everyone else. I wanted to be a part of her journey but I was consistently alienated by the show's overdrive lunacy. ""The Big C"" needs to be grounded. I understand it's goal is to be somewhat controversial in presenting this subject matter in a different way--but we need characters that we can believe in if there is to be any real emotional payoff. At the end, many people think the season's final revelations are enough to forgive the entire series of its inconsistencies, but I'm not a believer. The single biggest disappointment of my TV season--but I'll look forward to Linney in the next big project!

In ""Weeds"", Nancy Botwin is pot dealer, and in ""Dexter"", Dexter's a 'good' serial killer. In ""Nurse Jackie"", Jackie is a drug addict/adulterer.In ""The Big C"", Laura Linney plays a mother and wife, who has spent her whole life doing things for others. She's sacrificed what resemblance of a life she once had for her family. That is, until she figures out she has terminal Stage 4 Melanoma. But instead of having family feel sorry for her, and doing treatment, she decides to live it up. She, at first, tells nobody in her spoiled family about her diagnosis, she kicks her selfish husband out, and decides to make the rest of her life be about her, as well as to find the humor in the disease.This show is 30 minutes, which should be the length of a comedy. However, there is unexplainable depth to ""The Big C"". Linney, originally a stage actress, brings undeniable, and unavoidable enthusiasm to the role of Cathy Jamison. While the show has a phenomenal supporting cast, she's the standout in every episode. She has a theatrical presence, however, she never over-sells anything, and everything is always believable, because of her knack for bringing gusto to both the comedic and dramatic scenes.And, I think ""The Big C"", having a first season of only 13 shows, is one of the best first-seasons in the history of television, and here's why. It ends up being something completely different than what it started as. The writers clearly knew where they wanted to do with the characters, as well as the plot. There's real character development here. There's relatable characters that feel like actual human beings, rather than caricatures. Every character is flawed, in a way that works, and it's about them trying to find a middle ground in their ways, and their lives.""The Big C"" asks us to become attached to a character who is...let's face it, eventually going to die. They make the character of Cathy to be so colorful and dynamic, and strong. The first season alone has made me laugh, cry, and feel real emotion for these characters.

Instead of absolutely adoring Cathy and cracking up at everything she said, I wanted to reach through the TV and smack her. She became such a selfish, self-absorbed, spoiled brat. Fortunately, the show reeled Cathy back in and the final few episodes were incredibly good. I still don't understand the surprise death of a supporting character in the second to last episode...that could have been drawn out for a long time, at least another season. I am thrilled that Cynthia Nixon returns as Cathy's BFF, Rebecca, in the season finale, and hopefully she'll be back for most of next season (series regular, anyone?).

The only realistic portrayal in this show is when the teenage son wants to spend all his time with friends, texting his girlfriend and continuously asks for money.  Oh, and also the neighbor, Marlene, is somewhat believable. They were stupid for getting rid of her. I loved the way she looked and dressed, she was a cute character.I've never been a fan of Laura Linney.  In the Big C, as Kathy, she displays many stereotypical traits of a certain kind of TV mom.  The most glaring of these traits is her quest to find fulfillment by having flirtations and/or sex with men she's just recently met.  To think that numerous men find this 40 year old woman that sexy is shear fantasy. And why is she turning to people she barely knows in a time of crisis? It's also weird that this woman has no strong, lasting friendships with anyone her own age. However, she renews contact with a friend whom she hasn't seen in 15 years (played excellently by Cynthia Nixon who lights up the screen). But Kathy lacks much depth.It's also bizarre that Kathy spews out words like penis and vagina around her family members as if she were saying ear or elbow. I have lots of family yet we do not have these kinds of crude and vulgar conversations.Here's the reality: when you receive this kind of diagnosis, you don't go around acting so frivolous.  It's a fantasy to think you throw caution to the wind and do whatever you please. There are very heavy, dramatic emotions you deal with.  People always say, oh, what would you do if you knew your time was limited? as if it would be a pass to do all the things you always wanted to do but never have.
