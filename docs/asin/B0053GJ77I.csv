I am a fan of Rebecca Kochan's, and while it was great seeing her in this movie, she isn't given near as much fun things to do here as in the Eating Out series. I now have a crush on David Moretti, who plays Pierce in Finding Mr. Wright. I had already seen him in The Lair, but here he is playing a really good character and his acting has improved. Also, he is so sexy and dreamy while wearing those glasses! And I like his hair, too! Anyway, Finding Mr. Wright is worth watching if you like romantic-comedies. I was just hoping that it would have been funnier, and a David Moretti butt shot wouldn't have hurt.",3,"David Moretti Has The ""Wright"" Stuff",1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,684,"['Finding', 'Mr.', 'Wright', 'typical', 'romantic-comedy', 'predictable', 'yet', 'sweet', 'am', 'fan', 'Rebecca', 'Kochan', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'given', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'things', 'do', 'here', 'Eating', 'Out', 'series', 'now', 'have', 'crush', 'David', 'Moretti', 'who', 'Pierce', 'Finding', 'Mr.', 'Wright', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'Lair', 'here', 'playing', 'really', 'good', 'character', 'acting', 'improved', 'Also', 'so', 'sexy', 'dreamy', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'like', 'hair', 'too', 'Anyway', 'Finding', 'Mr.', 'Wright', 'worth', 'watching', 'like', 'romantic-comedies', 'was', 'just', 'hoping', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'David', 'Moretti', 'butt', 'shot', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt']",Finding Mr. Wright

1438422,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0053GJ77I,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[12, 15]","Clark Townsend (Matthew Montgomery) is a talent agent, whose most time-consuming client (also his best friend) is actress Eddy Malone (Rebekah Kochan, most would remember primarily from the ""Eating Out..."" videos), whose self-destructive partying is threatening to end her career before it really gets established.  The time and efforts Clark puts into keeping Eddy out of trouble cost him any chance of a social life of his own, and he has long ago burned out on the guys he meets there in West Hollywood.  At a party of business associates, Eddy's feisty lesbian publicist, TJ, brings along her gay buddy Pearce Wright (David Moretti, who was featured in the made-for-gay-cable series ""The Lair""), who takes an immediate interest in Clark, although Clark is obviously closed off to such possibilities.  A life coach who specializes in helping his clients adopt a more healthy and productive lifestyle. Pearce suggests that Eddy would benefit from a ""wilderness therapy weekend"" ... and everyone ends up going, including Clark's ex and his fledgling porn star new boyfriend, who immediately aim their sights on Pearce and Clark, respectively.  It's a strange weekend, looking for love and new beginnings, while dealing with lots of old baggage that just won't let go.Directed and produced by Nancy Criss, who has a lot of experience in television, this film has a ""sitcom"" feel to it, not necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect groundbreaking cinema.  To her credit, she does a commendable job with a rather complex story with many character interactions, and gets a credible performance out of the main actors. A bit uneven in parts, some very minor sound problems, but otherwise an amusing and enjoyable diversion, appropriate even for a mixed gay/straight gathering.  There are no DVD extras except two versions of the trailer, and the film is unrated (PG would likely suffice, as there is no full nudity or simulated sex.)
