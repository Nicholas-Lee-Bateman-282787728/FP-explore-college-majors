Ryder stars as Patty Vare, a woman who was thrown from her horse while riding and knocked unconscious.  She is discovered by two young boys from a local boys' prep school.  The young boys get help from John &quot;Sonny&quot; Baker, an older boy at the school, played by Lukas Haas.  Patty hides out in John's room while John does his best to keep her hidden from his friends and the administrators.Unknown to John, Patty is hiding a dark secret.  She was at a party the night before her riding accident and a police officer, played by John C. Reilly, has been coming around and asking a lot of questions.  Patty was introduced to Bud Valentine (Skeet Ulrich).  Bud is a star baseball pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The two have a little too much to drink and end up stealing a car.  Patty then sees a picture in the car and recognizes who the car belongs to from the picture.  She decides that she wants out, and this is where the accident occurs.Meanwhile, John has developed strong feelings for Patty.  He takes one of the school's cars and they go to the county fair.  However, officer Curry is there and he questions John about Patty.  John talks to Patty about this, and Patty takes John to the scene of the accident.  Later, the police take Patty to headquarters for questioning, along with John and his family.  At the end, John and Patty leap into the elevator together and drive away.I thought this movie was good overall, but I found it hard to follow.  Patty's flashbacks to the party took away from the plot a little, and I didn't care for John's friends too much.  I still think people would like this movie, it's just not one of Ryder's best works.",3,"Good, But Hard to Follow in Some Parts",1044316800,"02 4, 2003",2003,1803,"['Winona', 'Ryder', 'film', 'woman', 'dark', 'secret', 'who', 'ultimately', 'love', 'young', 'prep', 'school', 'boy', 'Ryder', 'Patty', 'Vare', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'thrown', 'horse', 'riding', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'discovered', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'local', 'boys', 'prep', 'school', 'young', 'boys', 'get', 'help', 'John', 'quot', 'Sonny', 'quot', 'Baker', 'older', 'boy', 'school', 'played', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Patty', 'out', 'John', 'room', 'John', 'best', 'keep', 'hidden', 'friends', 'administrators.Unknown', 'John', 'Patty', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secret', 'was', 'party', 'night', 'riding', 'accident', 'police', 'officer', 'played', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'been', 'coming', 'around', 'asking', 'lot', 'questions', 'Patty', 'was', 'introduced', 'Bud', 'Valentine', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'Bud', 'star', 'baseball', 'pitcher', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirates', 'two', 'have', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'end', 'up', 'stealing', 'car', 'Patty', 'then', 'picture', 'car', 'recognizes', 'who', 'car', 'belongs', 'picture', 'out', 'where', 'accident', 'occurs.Meanwhile', 'John', 'developed', 'strong', 'feelings', 'Patty', 'one', 'school', 'cars', 'go', 'county', 'fair', 'However', 'officer', 'Curry', 'there', 'questions', 'John', 'Patty', 'John', 'talks', 'Patty', 'Patty', 'John', 'scene', 'accident', 'Later', 'police', 'take', 'Patty', 'headquarters', 'questioning', 'John', 'family', 'end', 'John', 'Patty', 'leap', 'elevator', 'together', 'drive', 'away.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'overall', 'found', 'hard', 'follow', 'Patty', 'flashbacks', 'party', 'took', 'away', 'plot', 'little', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'John', 'friends', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'Ryder', 'best', 'works']",N/A

Haas goes to an all boy school and he tries to hide her from his classmates...he doesnt like school. Ryder is hiding from the cops because their investigating on a baseball player named Bud Valentine, played by Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Chill Factor) and the last person to see him was Ryder and also threw the movie we see flashbacks from her night with Ulrich and what happened to him. Alright story has its lulls here and there but what anchors it is the performances by Haas and Ryder but the ending sorta is put on for a happy yay feeling which I didnt like.

It has a ""Graduate"" kind of humor about an unconventional love story, though a younger boy lead.  Lucas Haas, Skeet Ulrich, Chris Cooper, Jessica Harper, Catherine Keener, John C. Reilly., and others make a great cast. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it and liked the unpredictable ending.Maybe the politically correct monitors dumped on this movie to make it less than it was. Maybe that is why no one saw it.
