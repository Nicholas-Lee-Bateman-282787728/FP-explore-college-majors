She then falls down the rabbit hole and finds herself in Wonderland, where she eventually talks back to the Queen and then finds herself trapped on the other side of the mirror. Thisis when Alice must find her way to the eigth square where she will become a queen, and be able to return home to her family.Steve Allen's music and songs are a match to this wonderfully enjoyable adaptation of the ALICE tales. Gregory is so cute as Alice, and the all-star cast make this very interesting, humorous and dramatic. The sets are gorgeous, and the photography and direction is spectacular. An amazing treat and some day, I think this deserves a DVD treatment.",5,Alice in Wonderland (1985),1067212800,"10 27, 2003",2003,848,"['One', 'best', 'version', 'classic', 'story', 'date', 'two-part', 'miniseries', 'entitled', 'ALICE', 'IN', 'WONDERLAND', 'stars', 'Natalie', 'Gregory', 'girl', 'who', 'determined', 'find', 'known', 'grown-up', 'then', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'Wonderland', 'where', 'eventually', 'back', 'Queen', 'then', 'trapped', 'other', 'side', 'mirror', 'Thisis', 'when', 'Alice', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'eigth', 'square', 'where', 'will', 'become', 'queen', 'be', 'able', 'return', 'home', 'family.Steve', 'Allen', 'music', 'songs', 'are', 'match', 'wonderfully', 'enjoyable', 'adaptation', 'ALICE', 'tales', 'Gregory', 'so', 'cute', 'Alice', 'all-star', 'cast', 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'dramatic', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'direction', 'spectacular', 'amazing', 'treat', 'day', 'think', 'DVD', 'treatment']",N/A

There were so many actors and actresses from the 80's too numerous to mention.  But it was Natalie Gregory that played Alice who stole the show.  She was such a talented little actress.  It's great that these films were released as a gift-set.  I will say the only reason that i gave this film four stars instead of five was because there are parts that lag, more so in the second part (through the looking glass).  This is probably because there were so many actors and actresses that need to be featured as their characters.  Even though their are some boring parts, there are also some suspenseful ones as well.  Especailly when Alice is being chased by possibly the scariest monster in a family film... the JABBERWOCKY.  Looking back on it now, it does look kind of hoaky but it is definetly something you won't forget.  It's right up there with the Wicked Witch of the West.  It is still a wonderful film and I am so happy that this film was released when i was a kid because it gave me good memories.  Overall, this is a must have for the Alice, fairy tale or family film collector!!!",4,A Starstruck Version of the Timeless Story,1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,1167,"['saw', 'bits', 'pieces', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', '80', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'was', 'Natalie', 'Gregory', 'played', 'Alice', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'was', 'such', 'talented', 'little', 'actress', 'great', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'gift-set', 'will', 'say', 'only', 'reason', 'i', 'gave', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'was', 'are', 'parts', 'lag', 'more', 'so', 'second', 'part', 'looking', 'glass', 'probably', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'need', 'be', 'featured', 'characters', 'Even', 'are', 'boring', 'parts', 'are', 'also', 'suspenseful', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'Especailly', 'when', 'Alice', 'being', 'chased', 'possibly', 'scariest', 'monster', 'family', 'film', 'JABBERWOCKY', 'Looking', 'back', 'now', 'look', 'kind', 'hoaky', 'definetly', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'right', 'there', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'still', 'wonderful', 'film', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'kid', 'gave', 'good', 'memories', 'Overall', 'must', 'have', 'Alice', 'fairy', 'tale', 'family', 'film', 'collector']",N/A

Unfortunatly, the tape was not ours and I somewhat forgot all about this version of the story.  For some reason, I remembered it and was thrilled when I saw Amazon was selling it (the giftset is a GREAT deal).  The buyer recieves both ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"".  The songs, cast, costuming, and emotional rollercoaster of Alice (along with all the other crazies), is a delight.  This is the best version of ""Alice..."" that i have ever watched (and i am a big Disney fan)!  I recommend this to anyone with an imagination and open-mind.",5,Love this movie!,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,657,"['many', 'others', 'had', 'recorded', 'copy', 'television', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'child', 'Unfortunatly', 'tape', 'was', 'not', 'ours', 'somewhat', 'forgot', 'version', 'story', 'reason', 'remembered', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'saw', 'Amazon', 'was', 'selling', 'giftset', 'GREAT', 'deal', 'buyer', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Alice', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'songs', 'cast', 'costuming', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'Alice', 'other', 'crazies', 'delight', 'best', 'version', 'Alice', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'i', 'am', 'big', 'Disney', 'fan', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'imagination', 'open-mind']",N/A
340467,A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1,6302842506,Melissa,"[21, 22]","I remember watching this as a child about 1985, one of my favorite years that I remember well. When I saw the ads for this on TV I was excited, and I loved it even more as a child. Then I rediscovered it one day at Amazon and had to get the copy! Of course I had forgotten it continued to &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; however I bought both copies. Through this day I love it. I read the Alice in Wonderland book and the first part is pretty darn close to the book itself. Granted its a Hollywood version but I think that's what makes it more fun. You can learn of some of the old Hollywood actor's as well as some new actors and actresses. Some of my favorite scene's where the Sammy Davis Jr. (Catepillar scene), and the Mad Hatter and March Hare scene's.&quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; Is just as great as the first one. If not better. I loved the cast and the songs and the dancing. It almost reminds you in a way of the broadway show. It's interesting to see some of the Hollywood Actors/Actresses at the time of their younger years. I think they had much fun making this movie as well.I still enjoy watching these movies in my twenties. Also because I adore the Alice in Wonderland stories by Lewis Carrol. The Disney version is good, but too me this is better. Because I think it follow's the books written by LC really well. I didn't even realize till I saw this movie that the story continues in two parts. And I started reading everything there was to Alice in Wonderland and Lewis Carrol.It's a definate must see for all ages.
