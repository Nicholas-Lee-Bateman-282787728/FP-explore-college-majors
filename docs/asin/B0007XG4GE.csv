893930,AG0H4OWCYMFFZ,B0007XG4GE,ByteME,"[20, 50]","SO here we go again, yet another attempt to rip us, the FANS, off.I don't care what novice reviewer has to type, I checked my old VHS tapes for Homicide episodes and the picture was 100% clearer then what is released on DVD.Sure some douche will spring up, ""the picture was made to be grainy"" , no kidding Holmes, but to compare what was released on TV and from a VHS source to the UPDATED DVD format, there is no contest.NBC and A&E; have done a piss poor job at releasing the series onto DVD.First off last season which was arguably the best of the shows run, was a waste of money.SEASON 6 included two, TWO-HOUR double episodes.The first SOMETHING SACRED dealing with the murder of priests, which was originally shown in a two hour block, but was split for DVD. Ok...that one was on the house.The most painful of the two was FALLEN HEROES. What was originally released in two parts, was re released at the beginning of Season 7 in a two hour movie which included some really awesome footage put back in. Including a scene introducing Gharty's wife and which also included more violence which added to the horror of the what was happening.But what were we given for $99 bucks, (at Best Buy) the best of the series SPLIT in two without the inclusion of those scenes.I mean in each box set, which aren't that cheap mind you, we're treated to a boring behind the scenes and some thrown together commentary...which doesn't even include cast members.I think season 5 had Clark Johnson but he was commenting more from a directors stand point.And finally a dumb thrown together ""MUSIC from the show"" menu. Which anyone who is a fan or admirer of the show has already gotten from someones else's WEBSITE while the show was still on the AIR!Oh and NO DELETED SCENES? My ass.I mean we're not even treated to a GREAT PICTURE let alone a truly surround sound experience.I mean...was that too much to ask? Were the other cast members too busy right now to join up for 45 minutes to talk about the show?I mean where is all that footage from the Homicide conventions that happened?I mean this is one of the greatest if not the GREATEST police shows ever to be produced and yet they don't care enough to produce a great DVD.Oh but CHARLES IN CHARGE SEASON 1 gets the works.I mean compared to THE SHIELD, Homicide looks like blues clues, but is still amazing to watch and to see how the show progressed, even then was ahead of it's time. Homicide was one of the first to include music as a drive for scenes which many have copied newer example being COLD CASE.So now here we are with Season 7 DVD box set.Of course I will waste my hard earned dough for the set, only because this is the only way to get them. But is it really worth the price tag? NO.Better luck finding complete episodes on VHS and copy your own to DVD.And you can truly say you've put more time and energy into it than A&E; or NBC has.Sorry for those of you who find this negative, but after Season 6 being cut short, never to have those full length shows again...I feel cheated and used.I mean I even had to make my own SOUNDTRACK because there never was one released.Oh but if you want, rush out and pick of the JOAN OF ARCADIA soundtrack...gimme a break.Hope this was helpful.B.",1,5 Stars for the Show 1 for the DVD's,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,3234,"['SO', 'here', 'go', 'again', 'yet', 'attempt', 'rip', 'FANS', 'off.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'novice', 'reviewer', 'type', 'checked', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'Homicide', 'episodes', 'picture', 'was', '100', '%', 'clearer', 'then', 'what', 'released', 'DVD.Sure', 'douche', 'will', 'spring', 'up', 'picture', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'grainy', 'kidding', 'Holmes', 'compare', 'what', 'was', 'released', 'TV', 'VHS', 'source', 'UPDATED', 'DVD', 'format', 'contest.NBC', 'A', 'E', 'have', 'done', 'piss', 'poor', 'job', 'releasing', 'series', 'DVD.First', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'shows', 'run', 'was', 'waste', '6', 'included', 'two', 'TWO-HOUR', 'double', 'episodes.The', 'first', 'SOMETHING', 'SACRED', 'dealing', 'murder', 'priests', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'two', 'hour', 'block', 'was', 'split', 'DVD', 'one', 'was', 'house.The', 'most', 'painful', 'two', 'was', 'FALLEN', 'HEROES', 'What', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'two', 'parts', 'was', 're', 'released', 'beginning', 'Season', '7', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'included', 'really', 'awesome', 'footage', 'put', 'back', 'Including', 'scene', 'introducing', 'Gharty', 'wife', 'also', 'included', 'more', 'violence', 'added', 'horror', 'what', 'was', 'happening.But', 'what', 'were', 'given', '99', 'bucks', 'Best', 'Buy', 'best', 'series', 'SPLIT', 'two', 'inclusion', 'scenes.I', 'mean', 'box', 'set', 'are', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'mind', ""'re"", 'treated', 'boring', 'scenes', 'thrown', 'together', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'even', 'include', 'cast', 'members.I', 'think', 'season', '5', 'had', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'was', 'commenting', 'more', 'directors', 'stand', 'point.And', 'finally', 'dumb', 'thrown', 'together', 'MUSIC', 'show', 'menu', 'Which', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'admirer', 'show', 'already', 'gotten', 'someones', 'else', 'WEBSITE', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'AIR', 'Oh', 'NO', 'DELETED', 'SCENES', 'ass.I', 'mean', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'treated', 'GREAT', 'PICTURE', 'let', 'alone', 'truly', 'surround', 'sound', 'experience.I', 'mean', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'Were', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'too', 'busy', 'right', 'now', 'join', 'up', '45', 'minutes', 'talk', 'show', 'mean', 'where', 'footage', 'Homicide', 'conventions', 'happened', 'mean', 'one', 'greatest', 'not', 'GREATEST', 'police', 'shows', 'ever', 'be', 'produced', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'produce', 'great', 'DVD.Oh', 'CHARLES', 'IN', 'CHARGE', 'SEASON', '1', 'works.I', 'mean', 'compared', 'THE', 'SHIELD', 'Homicide', 'blues', 'clues', 'still', 'amazing', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'progressed', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'Homicide', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'include', 'music', 'drive', 'scenes', 'many', 'have', 'copied', 'newer', 'example', 'being', 'COLD', 'CASE.So', 'now', 'here', 'are', 'Season', '7', 'DVD', 'box', 'set.Of', 'course', 'will', 'waste', 'hard', 'earned', 'dough', 'set', 'only', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'really', 'price', 'tag', 'NO.Better', 'luck', 'finding', 'complete', 'episodes', 'VHS', 'copy', 'own', 'DVD.And', 'can', 'truly', 'say', ""'ve"", 'put', 'more', 'time', 'energy', 'A', 'E', 'NBC', 'has.Sorry', 'who', 'find', 'negative', 'Season', '6', 'being', 'cut', 'short', 'never', 'have', 'full', 'length', 'shows', 'again', 'feel', 'cheated', 'used.I', 'mean', 'even', 'had', 'make', 'own', 'SOUNDTRACK', 'never', 'was', 'one', 'released.Oh', 'want', 'rush', 'out', 'pick', 'JOAN', 'OF', 'ARCADIA', 'soundtrack', 'gim', 'break.Hope', 'was', 'helpful.B']",Homicide Life on the Street - The Complete Season 7
893931,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0007XG4GE,calvinnme,"[3, 5]","At the end of season six, Bayliss has taken a bullet for his partner Frank Pembleton, and the resulting trauma has caused Frank to resign from the force, although I am never completely satisfied with his reasonings. Also at the end of season six, while being drilled in ""the box"", Mike Kellerman is finally tripped up over the issue of drug dealer Luther Mahoney's shooting having been on the level - it wasn't. Giardello, not wanting Kellerman to go to jail and to have the other two detectives involved (Stivers and Lewis) see their careers ended, gives Mike a way out - resign from the force. He takes this option, and two fine Homicide castmembers have exited stage left.For the first time, the squad room has been redecorated. I guess the network suits thought that the show's abysmal ratings were because of ambience versus the abysmal time slot (Friday 10pm) that the show was stuck in plus changes in scripting and casting that the network itself had insisted upon. At any rate, sporting soft pastels and potted plants, the squad room now resembles a travel agency more than a suitable home for the murder police.While the network suits were prettying up the place, they decided to bring in Michael Michele as ex-beauty queen/detective Rene Sheppard, who proceeds to do as good a job of helping this show jump the shark as Ted McGinley could have ever hoped to do. Batting her eyes, and even losing her gun to a suspect at one point in the season, she goes around pouting about how nobody wants to work with her. A more solid addition to the cast is Giancarlo Esposito as Al Giardello's son, Mike, who is liason between the Baltimore PD and the FBI, for whom he works. Esposito is a good actor, but the age separation is just not there between Al and Mike, and neither is any semblance of a believable family connection. The two come across more as brothers with a wide age separation and years of estrangement between them than father and son.Notable individual episodes include those that wrap up Mike Kellerman's story after his exile at the end of season six - the two-parter ""Kellerman P.I"". Kellerman, now a private investigator, becomes involved with his coworkers again as they clash over the investigation of the murder of an infant at a motel. Another interesting episode is ""The Twenty Percent Solution"", in which Clark Johnson is given an opportunity to direct. That episode involves a man naming the person who killed him on videotape, the problem is that there is no body and no crime scene. The final of the Law & Order cross-overs, ""Sideshow"", is the least enjoyable and preachiest of the bunch. It is basically a heavy-handed message about the abuse of power of independent prosecuters and a thinly disguised statement on what was going on with the President at the time (remember this was the 1998-1999 season) more than it was a homicide investigation. In ""Lines of Fire,"" a father is holding his son and stepdaughter hostage and will only speak to Mike Giardello. The scenes between the father and Mike Giardello have the tension and tight scripting that is reminiscent of previous and better seasons.Tim Bayliss, the character featured in the very first episode of the series, is the one to bring everything to a close. Bayliss has converted to Buddhism following his brush with death in season six, and becomes ""The Zen Detective"". This ushers in some episodes that further his character development where he is forced to shoot the killer of a Buddhist monk in self defense in ""Zen and the Art of Murder"". The other storyline concerning him involve episodes on the Internet killer, who is released on a technicality but vows to Bayliss that he will kill again. These two storylines - the Internet killer being freed and Tim discovering that he can kill if he has to - collide in the excellent series finale ""Forgive Us Our Trespasses"". This sets everything up for the Homicide movie that airs in February 2000.Season seven of this once great TV show is largely forgettable. Although Homicide had some excellent actors that worked well together, even during this final season, it could just not recover from losing the glue that held it all together - Frank Pembleton. He was the squad's best detective and the thinker of the group, famous for his Shakespearean musings. For better or worse, he was the star of this show, and when he left ""Homicide"" was living on borrowed time.As an aside, if you are thinking about purchasing any season of ""Homicide"", you might want to purchase the ""Homicide Life on the Street - Complete Series Megaset"" that has all seven seasons, the Law and Order cross-over episodes, and the movie.

However after Seasons 1-5 had been released on DVD, I checked them out from the library because I wanted to see what the earlier episodes were all about -- and after watching the first few episodes of the series I could barely force myself to sit there and watch the rest of the early seasons and I returned it to the library the very FIRST chance I got!Although I now own those seasons on DVD since I bought the [ASIN:B002BLNGTS Homicide: Life on the Street Complete Series set]] in my book, Season 6 and 7 (as well as some episodes in Season 5) are the only ones worth watching, and I have literally never even touched any of the Season 1-4 DVD discs -- they have never been taken out of its case, even once!Though I enjoyed some of the episodes in Season 5, I have to say, out of all the seasons of this show, Season 6 & 7 were my FAVORITES!I could not stand the characters in the earlier seasons. Even though I liked Pembleton post-stroke, before it, I thought he was unbearably arrogant, bossy, cocky, and downright irritating. I didn't like Kay Howard, or Felton, or Bolander either. Bayliss was okay, but like Pembleton, I liked him much better later on. Russert was okay too. I would not have minded if she had stayed on for Seasons 6, and 7. I would have liked to seen how she got along with my fave characters like Ballard, Falsone, Sheppard and Stivers.Although I HATE Gharty, and wish that he had not been added to the regular cast in Seasons 6 and 7, I LOVE Ballard, and Falsone, and think that they made an ADORABLE couple.

Rene Sheppard (Michael Michele) was a great infusion of an aggressive yet sometimes vulnerable female character, and the character of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), was a nice addition to show the kind of alliances that occur in real life between federal and local police agencies.As a huge fan ofLaw & Order(though mainly onlySeason 4,Season 5,Season 6,Season 7,Season 8andSeason 9) I also LOVED the HLOTS/L&O; crossover episodes including the interactions between Briscoe & Munch, Briscoe & Ballard, Curtis & Falsone, Curtis & Sheppard, as well as McCoy & Danvers, and all the L&O; characters with the HLOTS characters.The HLOTS-L&O; crossovers are just the ""icing on the cake"" of why I think Season 6 & 7 are the BEST!!",5,One of the BEST 2 Seasons of the Show!!,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,2798,"['have', 'strongly', 'STRONGLY', 'disagree', 'who', 'have', 'said', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'shadow', 'show', 'former', 'brilliance', 'people', 'will', 'buy', 'set', 'only', 'recall', 'how', 'far', 'show', 'fell', 'greatness', 'terms', 'series', 'sad', 'end', 'what', 'greatest', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'made', '.Because', 'got', 'intoHomicide', 'Life', 'Streetvery', 'late', 'series', '6th', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', 'However', 'Seasons', '1-5', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'checked', 'out', 'library', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'were', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'series', 'could', 'barely', 'force', 'sit', 'watch', 'rest', 'early', 'seasons', 'returned', 'library', 'very', 'FIRST', 'chance', 'got', 'now', 'own', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'bought', '[', 'ASIN', 'B002BLNGTS', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'Complete', 'Series', 'set', ']', ']', 'book', 'Season', '6', '7', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'Season', '5', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'watching', 'have', 'literally', 'never', 'even', 'touched', 'Season', '1-4', 'DVD', 'discs', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'taken', 'case', 'even', 'once', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'Season', '5', 'have', 'say', 'seasons', 'show', 'Season', '6', '7', 'were', 'FAVORITES', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'characters', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Even', 'liked', 'Pembleton', 'post-stroke', 'thought', 'was', 'unbearably', 'arrogant', 'bossy', 'cocky', 'downright', 'irritating', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kay', 'Howard', 'Felton', 'Bolander', 'Bayliss', 'was', 'okay', 'Pembleton', 'liked', 'much', 'better', 'later', 'Russert', 'was', 'okay', 'too', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'minded', 'had', 'stayed', 'Seasons', '6', '7', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seen', 'how', 'got', 'along', 'fave', 'characters', 'Ballard', 'Falsone', 'Sheppard', 'Stivers.Although', 'HATE', 'Gharty', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'added', 'regular', 'cast', 'Seasons', '6', '7', 'LOVE', 'Ballard', 'Falsone', 'think', 'made', 'ADORABLE', 'couple', 'also', 'think', 'addition', 'season', '7', 'Det', 'Rene', 'Sheppard', 'Michael', 'Michele', 'was', 'great', 'infusion', 'aggressive', 'yet', 'sometimes', 'vulnerable', 'female', 'character', 'character', 'Mike', 'Giardello', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'was', 'nice', 'addition', 'show', 'kind', 'alliances', 'occur', 'real', 'life', 'federal', 'local', 'police', 'agencies.As', 'huge', 'fan', 'ofLaw', 'Order', 'mainly', 'onlySeason', '4', 'Season', '5', 'Season', '6', 'Season', '7', 'Season', '8andSeason', '9', 'also', 'LOVED', 'HLOTS/L', 'O', 'crossover', 'including', 'interactions', 'Briscoe', 'Munch', 'Briscoe', 'Ballard', 'Curtis', 'Falsone', 'Curtis', 'Sheppard', 'as', 'well', 'McCoy', 'Danvers', 'L', 'O', 'characters', 'HLOTS', 'characters.The', 'HLOTS-L', 'O', 'crossovers', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'why', 'think', 'Season', '6', '7', 'are', 'BEST']",Homicide Life on the Street - The Complete Season 7

893936,AK7IDQJN31163,B0007XG4GE,Ryan,"[29, 32]","There is nothing worse for a diehard fan of a truly great television series than to see their favorite work spiral from top quality to bottom-of-the-barrel. Many reviewers have already said it and it is very true; Homicide's final season was, by far, its weakest. The most obvious reason was, of course, due to the departure of Emmy winner Andre Braugher as the moralistic and intense centerpiece of the show, Frank Pembleton, but one also can't overlook the damage done by Reed Diamond's exit as the turbulent Mike Kellerman. The absence of these two genuine characters, succeeding the departures of other greats like Kay Howard, Stan Bolander, Juliana Cox, Beau Felton and Megan Russert, was just too much for the series to take.But its not only the lack of decent characters that hurt the show; bad writing and gimmicky plots further drove Homicide downward. There is no better evidence of this than the introduction of Lt. Al Giardello's son Mike (Giancarlo Esposito) as an FBI liaison to the Baltimore police department. The conflict between father and son is supposed to be compelling, but the two actors and characters are so different and share so little chemistry that its impossible to regard their ongoing struggle to reconnect as little more than a bad soap opera subplot, not worthy of Homicide's past creative achievements. The other new face is Det. Renee Sheppard (Michael Michele.) She is little more than just a new face. She has no personality and adds nothing to the group dynamic of the show. Other players from the previous year (Gharty, Falsone and Ballard) take center stage in this season. They were tolerable before, but their personal relationships and watery portrayals only show why a good ensemble drama needs good actors and authentic characters to be successful. There's a third and final crossover with Law & Order, but it tries to press too many political buttons in the midst of the Lewinsky/Starr scandal and comes off as too heavy-handed and manipulative for its own good.Despite the final season's many obvious flaws, there's just enough to bring diehard fans like me back for the finish. The two-part ""Kellerman, P.I."" gives us some closure to Mike Kellerman's character that we won't find in the subsequent movie. Several other noteworthy episodes include ""Lines of Fire,"" ""The Same Coin,"" ""Homicide.com,"" ""Self-defense,"" and ""Truth Will Out."" Old Homicide veterans like Munch, Lewis and Giardello Sr. still put in quality performances, though they aren't as effective when they're not given good stories and actors off which to play. Tim Bayliss is one of the few compelling characters that remains, though he is a mixed bag for much of the season. After returning from his near-fatal shooting in the sixth season finale, he seems to be adrift without Pembleton and clings to Buddhism for comfort. This comes off as clich&eacute; and cornie for much of the season, but his strange trip is worth the pay-off in the excellent series finale, ""Forgive Us Our Trespasses,"" when Bayliss ends his series arc in a dark and disturbing fashion. Viewers left hanging can find some answers in the Homicide movie, though it too suffers from its own problems.The extras are sparse in this set, though not necessarily as bare as previous offerings. The panel interview is insightful and the commentary is pretty good. This DVD set may not be worth 100 bucks, but its really necessary to complete the collection of an otherwise excellent and vastly under-rated network series. If the price tag puts you off, just do what I did and buy it used. Enjoy the great series finale and the few other gems in this season and thank David Simon, Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson for bringing us this truly outstanding television program.",3,Homicide's Fall From Grace,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,3749,"['nothing', 'worse', 'diehard', 'fan', 'truly', 'great', 'television', 'series', 'see', 'favorite', 'work', 'spiral', 'top', 'quality', 'bottom-of-the-barrel', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'very', 'true', 'Homicide', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'far', 'weakest', 'most', 'obvious', 'reason', 'was', 'course', 'due', 'departure', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'moralistic', 'intense', 'centerpiece', 'show', 'Frank', 'Pembleton', 'one', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'damage', 'done', 'Reed', 'Diamond', 'exit', 'turbulent', 'Mike', 'Kellerman', 'absence', 'two', 'genuine', 'characters', 'succeeding', 'departures', 'other', 'greats', 'Kay', 'Howard', 'Stan', 'Bolander', 'Juliana', 'Cox', 'Beau', 'Felton', 'Megan', 'Russert', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'series', 'take.But', 'not', 'only', 'lack', 'decent', 'characters', 'hurt', 'show', 'bad', 'writing', 'gimmicky', 'plots', 'further', 'drove', 'Homicide', 'downward', 'better', 'evidence', 'introduction', 'Lt.', 'Al', 'Giardello', 'son', 'Mike', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'FBI', 'liaison', 'Baltimore', 'police', 'department', 'conflict', 'father', 'son', 'supposed', 'be', 'compelling', 'two', 'actors', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'share', 'so', 'little', 'chemistry', 'impossible', 'regard', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'reconnect', 'little', 'more', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'subplot', 'not', 'worthy', 'Homicide', 'past', 'creative', 'achievements', 'other', 'new', 'face', 'Det', 'Renee', 'Sheppard', 'Michael', 'Michele', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'new', 'face', 'personality', 'nothing', 'group', 'dynamic', 'show', 'Other', 'players', 'previous', 'year', 'Gharty', 'Falsone', 'Ballard', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'season', 'were', 'tolerable', 'before', 'personal', 'relationships', 'watery', 'portrayals', 'only', 'show', 'why', 'good', 'ensemble', 'drama', 'good', 'actors', 'authentic', 'characters', 'be', 'successful', 'third', 'final', 'crossover', 'Law', 'Order', 'press', 'too', 'many', 'political', 'buttons', 'midst', 'Lewinsky/Starr', 'scandal', 'off', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'manipulative', 'own', 'good.Despite', 'final', 'season', 'many', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'just', 'enough', 'bring', 'diehard', 'fans', 'back', 'finish', 'two-part', 'Kellerman', 'P.I', 'closure', 'Mike', 'Kellerman', 'character', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'subsequent', 'movie', 'Several', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'episodes', 'include', 'Lines', 'Fire', 'Same', 'Coin', 'Homicide.com', 'Self-defense', 'Truth', 'Will', 'Out', 'Old', 'Homicide', 'Munch', 'Lewis', 'Giardello', 'Sr.', 'still', 'put', 'quality', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'effective', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'good', 'stories', 'actors', 'off', 'play', 'Tim', 'Bayliss', 'one', 'few', 'compelling', 'characters', 'mixed', 'bag', 'much', 'season', 'returning', 'near-fatal', 'shooting', 'sixth', 'season', 'finale', 'be', 'adrift', 'Pembleton', 'clings', 'Buddhism', 'comfort', 'off', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cornie', 'much', 'season', 'strange', 'trip', 'pay-off', 'excellent', 'series', 'finale', 'Forgive', 'Us', 'Trespasses', 'when', 'Bayliss', 'series', 'arc', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'fashion', 'Viewers', 'left', 'hanging', 'can', 'find', 'answers', 'Homicide', 'movie', 'too', 'own', 'problems.The', 'extras', 'are', 'sparse', 'set', 'not', 'necessarily', 'as', 'bare', 'previous', 'offerings', 'panel', 'interview', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'pretty', 'good', 'DVD', 'set', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'worth', '100', 'bucks', 'really', 'necessary', 'complete', 'collection', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'vastly', 'under-rated', 'network', 'series', 'price', 'tag', 'off', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'buy', 'used', 'Enjoy', 'great', 'series', 'finale', 'few', 'other', 'gems', 'season', 'thank', 'David', 'Simon', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'bringing', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'television', 'program']",Homicide Life on the Street - The Complete Season 7
