How pampered can you be when you gripe about the lack of surround sound ON MATERIAL THAT HAD NONE TO BEGIN WITH?  Give me a break!Ooh, poor you, who can't bear to watch this for what it is - a fairly fascinating look at the advertising methodology and techniques used back in the day.  Some of these are more than fifty years old, so if the black and white doesn't look razor sharp on your HDTV, grow up and get over it and go watch 'The Matrix' for the thousandth time.This set runs around three bucks a disc, for ten hours worth of programming.  That sounds to me like a pretty decent bargain.  So what if they're 'downloadable' from another website?  I actually have a job, so I don't have time to sit and burn blank DVDs that would cost more than this set did to begin with.The 'wow' factor, or the ""I had one of those"" phrase comes to mind quite often, especially in the disc involving toy commercials.  In addition to the toy disc, you get a disc of cigarette commercials, celebrity commercials, a 'miscellaneous' disc, a disc of car commercials, and a disc of food and beverage commercials.Oh, and one more thing - the fast forward button isn't all that difficult to manage.  Sorry that the DVD authors didn't put chapter stops on every single one of the more than six hundred commercials here.  But, if watching thirty and sixty second pieces of video is too time consuming for you in the first place, this probably isn't the set for you.",4,"Decent, especially for the price",1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,1536,"['First', 'off', 'what', 'are', ""'reviewers"", 'who', 'complain', '5.1', 'surround', 'How', 'pampered', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'gripe', 'lack', 'surround', 'sound', 'ON', 'MATERIAL', 'THAT', 'HAD', 'NONE', 'TO', 'BEGIN', 'WITH', 'Give', 'break', 'Ooh', 'poor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'watch', 'what', 'fairly', 'fascinating', 'look', 'advertising', 'methodology', 'techniques', 'used', 'back', 'day', 'are', 'more', 'fifty', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'black', 'white', ""n't"", 'look', 'razor', 'sharp', 'HDTV', 'grow', 'up', 'get', 'go', 'watch', ""'The"", 'Matrix', 'thousandth', 'time.This', 'set', 'three', 'bucks', 'disc', 'ten', 'hours', 'programming', 'pretty', 'decent', 'bargain', 'So', 'what', ""'re"", ""'downloadable"", 'website', 'actually', 'have', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'sit', 'burn', 'blank', 'DVDs', 'would', 'cost', 'more', 'set', 'did', 'begin', 'with.The', ""'wow"", 'factor', 'had', 'one', 'phrase', 'mind', 'quite', 'often', 'especially', 'disc', 'involving', 'toy', 'commercials', 'addition', 'toy', 'disc', 'get', 'disc', 'cigarette', 'commercials', 'celebrity', 'commercials', ""'miscellaneous"", 'disc', 'disc', 'car', 'commercials', 'disc', 'food', 'beverage', 'commercials.Oh', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'manage', 'Sorry', 'DVD', 'authors', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'chapter', 'stops', 'single', 'one', 'more', 'six', 'hundred', 'commercials', 'here', 'watching', 'thirty', 'sixty', 'second', 'pieces', 'video', 'too', 'time', 'consuming', 'first', 'place', 'probably', ""n't"", 'set']",TV Commercials: The Ultimate Collection

For those of us who lived through the time of these commercials, it is a fun experience to watch the way the things were and consider how far technology has come.  The visual quality and sound are as good as one can expect from forty-to-fifty-year-old archives. I watch these dvds while I'm washing dishes and cleaning the kitchen. If I miss a word here or there, it is of no great consequence.  Invariably, whenever I watch one of these dvds in my kitchen, I will look around and find that one or more children have gathered around and are more than willing to help clean up as they watch.",5,Looking back and smiling,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,644,"['plenty', 'nolstalgic', 'amusement', 'set', 'who', 'lived', 'time', 'commercials', 'fun', 'experience', 'watch', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'consider', 'how', 'far', 'technology', 'come', 'visual', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'forty-to-fifty-year-old', 'archives', 'watch', 'dvds', ""'m"", 'washing', 'dishes', 'cleaning', 'kitchen', 'miss', 'word', 'here', 'there', 'great', 'consequence', 'Invariably', 'whenever', 'watch', 'one', 'dvds', 'kitchen', 'will', 'look', 'find', 'one', 'more', 'children', 'have', 'gathered', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'help', 'clean', 'up', 'watch']",TV Commercials: The Ultimate Collection

Sure, as others have stated, you can find a lot of these commercials for free on the internet - I've seen them - but I've got better things to do than sit around for days on the computer searching for the 613 commercials included in this set, downloading them, and then compiling them myself. Then there are those that complain that the picture or sound quality is not up to current standards. For gawd's sake, these things are old, and I doubt that the original source material was as well taken care of as, say, ""Citizen Kane"". No 5.1 sound? Give me a break!
