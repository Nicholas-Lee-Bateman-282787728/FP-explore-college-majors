So, we have to suspend our disbelief when he takes off for New York to woo a supermodel. Alright, I can do that. But then we have to add in a bit of a subplot with the old mom going for evening strolls with the good-looking football player. It was really one too many impossible relationships for me to buy into. The movie went all over the place, and not in a good way. Felt like they were BSing their way through to the end of the movie. And all the flashback/hallucinations got tiresome fast.

983070,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000F4RHAM,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 7]","It's a nice idea to take the standard cliche-driven movie concept of a dying boy's last wish and turn it on its head into something emotionally resonant and blackly humorous. But unfortunately, something goes awry in this oddly dissatisfying 2006 movie. The major problem is that director Alex Steyermark and screenwriter Barry Stringfellow never find a consistent tone to their story as it uneasily blends elements of ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Six Feet Under"" into an unappetizing concoction. That's a shame since a cast of solid actors has been recruited by agents I'm sure were convinced of the film's appeal.The plot focuses on an incurably ill sixteen-year old named Dylan Jameison living with his widowed mother Karen in a Philadelphia suburb. Granted a last request by a ""Make a Wish""-type foundation, he goes for the more socially acceptable wish of taking a fishing trip with his favorite football player, Jason O'Malley, but he reveals during the media event that his real wish is to spend a weekend alone with supermodel, Nikki Sinclair. As it turns out, Nikki is on a nihilistic, drug-addled and alcohol-soaked slide and badly in need of a PR makeover, so her savvy agent takes advantage of the situation and turns it into a photo opportunity. An off-the-cuff comment encourages Dylan, now a media darling, to visit Nikki in New York, and the rest of the story, as you can guess, takes care of itself.Not just focusing on Dylan and his buddies, the narrative also tracks Nikki's buried past and the reasons behind her current diva behavior, as well as Karen's burgeoning relationship with Jason. Instead of adding texture to the story, these story threads feel extraneous and compound the plot contrivances. What's more, Dylan's two buddies, Ricky and Slap, are so interchangeable in look and hormone-driven behavior that they become tiresome quickly, and it is basically left to Michael Angarano to hold the movie on his shoulders.Luckily, Angarano is winning as Dylan. Most familiar to me as Jack's level-headed, biological son Elliot on ""Will & Grace"", he latches onto the heart of the character without getting either cloying or manipulative about his mortality. Sunny Mabrey does what she can as Nikki, but her character arc feels elliptical and disjointed. As Dylan's mother, Cynthia Nixon effortlessly finds her maternal instinct here, a role quite similar to the one she played in ""Little Manhattan"". Her well-honed skills at camaraderie, developed over the years on ""Sex in the City"", are what make her scenes with Angarano work well. Sadly though, Stringfellow shoves her character into a ridiculously conceived romance.For an indie film, there are a surprising number of high profile people in smaller roles - an uncredited Ethan Hawke in flashbacks and dream sequences as Dylan's father; the welcome Gina Gershon as Nikki's agent; Brian Stokes Mitchell, Broadway's favorite troubadour, as Dylan's caring doctor; hip-hop maestro Wyclef Jean as a mystical cab driver; and Michael Rispoli (also uncredited) as an urban savior heavy into mysticism. But none of them are helped by the distracting clash between the sentimental and the raucous that the filmmakers seem intent upon forcing on the actors.Released less than three weeks after its theatrical release (an arguable marketing tactic), the DVD contains a thoughtful commentary track from Steyermark, which is frankly better than listening to the film's misbegotten dialogue; a worthless series of outtakes; and the trailer which frankly says enough about the film if you want to avoid it entirely. There is a half-hour featurette of the film, mainly interviews with Steyermark and the principals, moderated by smug, self-absorbed film critic Robert Wilonsky as part of his ""HDNet Higher Definition"" series.",2,A Winning Angarano Not Enough to Offset the Uneasy Blend Between Sentimental and Raucous,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,3812,"['nice', 'idea', 'take', 'standard', 'cliche-driven', 'movie', 'concept', 'dying', 'boy', 'last', 'wish', 'turn', 'head', 'something', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'blackly', 'humorous', 'unfortunately', 'something', 'awry', 'oddly', 'dissatisfying', '2006', 'movie', 'major', 'problem', 'director', 'Alex', 'Steyermark', 'screenwriter', 'Barry', 'Stringfellow', 'never', 'find', 'consistent', 'tone', 'story', 'uneasily', 'elements', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'Six', 'Feet', 'unappetizing', 'concoction', 'shame', 'cast', 'solid', 'actors', 'been', 'recruited', 'agents', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'convinced', 'film', 'appeal.The', 'plot', 'incurably', 'ill', 'sixteen-year', 'old', 'named', 'Dylan', 'Jameison', 'living', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Karen', 'Philadelphia', 'suburb', 'Granted', 'last', 'request', 'Make', 'Wish', '-type', 'foundation', 'more', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'wish', 'taking', 'fishing', 'trip', 'favorite', 'football', 'player', 'Jason', ""O'Malley"", 'media', 'event', 'real', 'wish', 'spend', 'weekend', 'alone', 'supermodel', 'Nikki', 'Sinclair', 'out', 'Nikki', 'nihilistic', 'drug-addled', 'alcohol-soaked', 'slide', 'badly', 'need', 'PR', 'makeover', 'savvy', 'agent', 'advantage', 'situation', 'photo', 'opportunity', 'off-the-cuff', 'comment', 'encourages', 'Dylan', 'now', 'media', 'darling', 'visit', 'Nikki', 'New', 'York', 'rest', 'story', 'can', 'guess', 'care', 'itself.Not', 'just', 'focusing', 'Dylan', 'buddies', 'narrative', 'also', 'Nikki', 'buried', 'past', 'reasons', 'current', 'diva', 'behavior', 'as', 'well', 'Karen', 'burgeoning', 'relationship', 'Jason', 'Instead', 'adding', 'texture', 'story', 'story', 'threads', 'feel', 'extraneous', 'compound', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'What', 'more', 'Dylan', 'two', 'buddies', 'Ricky', 'Slap', 'are', 'so', 'interchangeable', 'look', 'hormone-driven', 'behavior', 'become', 'tiresome', 'quickly', 'basically', 'left', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'hold', 'movie', 'shoulders.Luckily', 'Angarano', 'winning', 'Dylan', 'Most', 'familiar', 'Jack', 'level-headed', 'biological', 'son', 'Elliot', 'Will', 'Grace', 'heart', 'character', 'getting', 'cloying', 'manipulative', 'mortality', 'Sunny', 'Mabrey', 'what', 'can', 'Nikki', 'character', 'arc', 'feels', 'elliptical', 'disjointed', 'Dylan', 'mother', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'effortlessly', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'here', 'role', 'quite', 'similar', 'one', 'played', 'Little', 'Manhattan', 'well-honed', 'skills', 'camaraderie', 'developed', 'years', 'Sex', 'City', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'scenes', 'Angarano', 'work', 'well', 'Sadly', 'Stringfellow', 'character', 'ridiculously', 'conceived', 'romance.For', 'indie', 'film', 'are', 'surprising', 'number', 'high', 'profile', 'people', 'smaller', 'roles', 'uncredited', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'flashbacks', 'dream', 'sequences', 'Dylan', 'father', 'welcome', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'Nikki', 'agent', 'Brian', 'Stokes', 'Mitchell', 'Broadway', 'favorite', 'troubadour', 'Dylan', 'caring', 'doctor', 'hip-hop', 'maestro', 'Wyclef', 'Jean', 'mystical', 'cab', 'driver', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'also', 'uncredited', 'urban', 'savior', 'heavy', 'mysticism', 'none', 'are', 'helped', 'distracting', 'clash', 'sentimental', 'raucous', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'intent', 'forcing', 'actors.Released', 'less', 'three', 'weeks', 'theatrical', 'release', 'arguable', 'marketing', 'tactic', 'DVD', 'thoughtful', 'commentary', 'track', 'Steyermark', 'frankly', 'better', 'listening', 'film', 'misbegotten', 'dialogue', 'worthless', 'series', 'outtakes', 'trailer', 'frankly', 'enough', 'film', 'want', 'avoid', 'entirely', 'half-hour', 'featurette', 'film', 'mainly', 'Steyermark', 'principals', 'moderated', 'smug', 'self-absorbed', 'film', 'critic', 'Robert', 'Wilonsky', 'part', 'HDNet', 'Higher', 'Definition', 'series']",N/A

This one just isn't up to par.Michael Angarano plays Dylan Jameison, a teenager with terminal cancer. A 'make a wish' type foundation has arranged for him to meet his favorite Phillies quarterback, but during the televised shindig he changes his request to spending a weekend, alone, with super model Nikki Sinclaire who has more baggage than United Airlines. She acquiesces, but more out of need for positive p.r. than any caring for him. She spends just enough time with him to grab a photo op, but he heads to New York to work on her. Interesting things happen.I like Angarano. I've seen him in a few movies and he's just a likable guy. Cynthia Nixon is good as the grieving mom. Most of the other actors do a stand up job, save for Gina Gershon who couldn't seem to locate her character. The problem here lies at the script level. The focus of the story is on Dylan and Nikki, but they spend almost no time together. He does a lot of goofing off with his buds and she suffers angst from the death of an old boyfriend she blew off. There was also a lot of sinchronicity which might have been part of the mystical, afterlife aspect of the story. For me it was a weak device. And what about the quarterback befriending Dylan's mom. They hint but don't resolve. This was just a jumpy, unsatisfying watch. I would like to recommend it but I can't.

983073,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000F4RHAM,Grady Harp,"[19, 23]","The concept for this little Indie film - the dying wish of a teenager opening spiritual doors - is far from original, but Barry Stringfellow's strong script as directed by Alex Steyermark (whose only other directorial venture was 'Prey for Rock and Roll', though he has been on the crew of some very fine films like 'Pieces of April' etc) results in a far from ordinary drama.  For those who have not seen Cynthia Nixon expand beyond her 'Sex and the City' role, this performance will be enlightening!Dylan (Michael Angarano) is a young teenager diagnosed with terminal cancer, a fact that he shares with his loony buddies (Gideon Glick and Matt Bush) who support him with silly but genuine companionship.  Dylan's mother Carol (Cynthia) is still reeling from her husband's death (Ethan Hawke) and facing the loss of the one remaining part of her family is devastating but her strength of character keeps a positive support for Dylan.  When Dylan is informed by his doctor (Brian Stokes Mitchell) that further radiation and chemotherapy are useless, Dylan places his desire for living on one last thing...he is on a TV show where dying wishes are granted, and rather than the asking for expected fishing trip with football hero Jason (Johnny Messner), he opts for a weekend alone with supermodel Nikki Sinclair (Sunny Mabrey).  Nikki, we discover, has problems and demons of her own and her agent Arlene (Gina Gershon), in trying to rescue her faltering career, advises the reluctant Nikki to visit Dylan in his home in Pennsylvania - for positive PR purposes.  Once they meet Dylan is determined to have his one last thing, gains money and a room (a gift from Jason) in New York and travels with his sidekicks to the Big Apple to cash in on his prize.  The Nikki he finds is the wasted girl down at heels and though she feels tenderness toward Dylan she tells him to just go home. Dylan's disease progresses to the point of final hospitalization when Nikki re-enters the sad room and changes things.The power that changes this predictable story lies in the extraordinarily sensitive performances of Michael Angarano, who plays Dylan with a twinkle in his eye and allows us to feel his burden without resorting to bathos, and the always-impressive Cynthia Nixon whose performance as Dylan's mother is the most understated and heart wrenching on film.  She owns the screen whenever she is on. The supporting cast is strong (though Gideon Glick and Matt Bush are allowed to become obnoxious and would have benefited from some stronger direction).  In all, this is a  striking, simple, compelling film that rises well above its premise to become an important statement about death and dying and the power of hope and love and family.

983074,A25R2VZXZ5X6Y3,B000F4RHAM,larry-411,"[7, 7]","Since the earliest days of theater, tragedy and comedy often go hand-in-hand, and it's at the heart of this story. As they say, ""you'll laugh, you'll cry."" The power of this film comes from the script by Barry Stringfellow and a brilliant cast, led by Michael Angarano. Arguably the most sought-after teenage actor in America, Angarano is finally beginning to tackle some powerful leading roles. As Sky High's Will and Lords of Dogtown's Sid we saw just a hint of the powerful range of Angarano's abilities, and in One Last Thing he uses both his comedic talents as well as dramatic ones in a way that we haven't really seen before. If you liked Sid, you'll love Dylan.Angarano has an uncanny ability to make us laugh when we want to cry and to make us cry when we want to laugh. It's a real gift, and one which is evident in films like Dear Wendy and Lords of Dogtown. But here is able to use that gift from opening to closing credits. Anyone who has seen his films will not be surprised at how elegantly he slips into this character, but no doubt others who are not as familiar with his body of work will discover what many already know.To say that this is a film about a boy's carnal desires in his last days is to miss the point. Even more than that, One Last Thing is about coping with loss - a son's loss of his father and a mother's loss of her son. It's also about the search for love. ""Carpe diem,"" if you will. The mother here is Cynthia Nixon, who is absolutely heartbreaking in a performance that can only come from deep within. This is a role that lesser actors would find daunting. Who among us hasn't experienced a similar loss? On the other hand, nothing can compare to seeing your child go before you do.The ""love object"" (of Dylan - there are others here) is played by Sunny Mabrey. She is the image that has been but a poster on his wall, and his quest to fulfill his dream is only as powerful in its resolution as Mabrey is in her ability to make a petulant supermodel a sympathetic character. But she pulls it off effortlessly. Dylan's partners in crime are his two best buds, Slap and Ricky (Gideon Glick and Matt Bush), who provide much of the comic relief in what would otherwise have threatened to be a heavy-handed statement on death and spiritual belief. Their lines elicit the most laughs and the fact that these were two ""real"" teenagers, both acting in their first film, gives their performances a ring of truth which more jaded veterans might actually have had to fight to find.But what struck me more than anything was just how incredibly economical Steyermark and editor Michael Berenbaum are in their work. This is one of the most efficiently constructed films I've ever seen. The tendency lately seems to be to build slowly, sometimes spending up to a third of the film on character development before you begin to see the story unfold. Not here. The basic plot is presented in the very first scene, literally in the opening minutes of the film. From that point on not a moment is wasted - not a shot, not a line, not a frame. Every second here is valuable to the story and yet nothing feels rushed.

It may have moved a bit slow for some, but I tend to watch movies when I am relaxing anyway, so I can be a little more patient. I wonder what some expect from a story about a dying teen. I think it was handled very well.For Dylan to make jokes and poke fun made it just a little easier to accept the fact he was dying. He did have sick moments and you could see that they were no laughing matter. Overall he had a good grasp on his situation, and at times made it easier on his mother because of that. This character for me was easy to like, and admire. I liked the fact he seemed to look at the big picture instead of being pigeon holed by circumstance. He faced things he did not understand, yet kept reaching for his wish. I think he had courage, a good sense of humor, and a strength that kept not only him going, but people around him too. This movie is a bit different, yet I enjoyed it. I liked the way this subject was handled, and I was relieved that it did not show long periods of suffering.

Dying, loss, death, hope, faith, doubt, suffering, these are all part of the movie, but are used so thoughtlessly. Pearls are cast before swine and made to plastic. The characters are grossly undeveloped and the relationships as plastic as the themes. The marque relationship consists of two people who share three minutes of camera time and 100 words.

At a Make-A-Wish-type organization, Dylan is expected to ask to spend a day fishing with a professional football player he has idolized for years. Prompted by a conversation with his two best friends earlier, Dylan instead wishes that he would like to spend one evening alone with supermodel Nikki Sinclaire (Sunny Mabrey). The foundation people are shocked as is Dylan's mother, Carol (Cynthia Nixon). However, the announcement quickly makes Dylan a mini-celebrity for having the balls to ask for something that apparently every guy on the planet would want. Eventually, Carol goes along with her son's wish and does everything she can to help him see it become a reality. Meanwhile, Nikki's life is in major turmoil. She's gained the reputation of being a diva and no amount of booze, drugs, or sex with her current boy toy seem to help. She's dropped from a major gig. Her publicist, after hearing of Dylan's request, sees it as the perfect PR opportunity for Nikki to revamp her career. They meet and greet and take a photo and leave. Everyone's happy, right? Not quite. Dylan's determined to spend an evening with Nikki and leaves for a trip with his two friends to New York City to convince her to spend one evening with him. Of course, all the while Dylan's headaches are getting worse and he keeps seeing images of his dead father.I'll give ONE LAST THING credit for trying to be a resonant film full of dark comedy that doesn't treat its subject matter lightly. Dylan is going to die and the film goes into detail exploring how the boy faces death.However, despite this attempt ONE LAST THING really doesn't work and I did not enjoy it very much. It got better half-way through, but it never did grab my attention. One might wonder why because the cast is excellent, the writing is decent, and there is both witty comedy and serious drama involved. The pacing feels right and the look of the film doesn't seem out of the place.Nevertheless, the movie never really gels; it never finds a consistent tone. If the film were a novel one would say that the authors fail to show any sign of an original style. The filmmakers behind ONE LAST THING are relatively new, so style isn't an issue, yet, but tone is. The movie deals with some important issues and has some black humorous moments, but the two never mesh. One moment the movie feels like a serious drama, the next it seems like it longs to be a dark comedy. Back and forth. Up and down. There is no consistency.It should also be noted that even though the movie has sometimes been promoted as having a ""spiritual"" message, it does not. Several times in the movie Dylan is given an opportunity to explore spirituality, but he rejects each attempt. He makes it very clear that he doesn't believe in God. Yet, when he dies he appears to go to Heaven where his earthly father is waiting. To some it might appear that this is a spiritual moment, but in reality it is not. It is a blatant promotion of universalism.",2,Lacks Consistency,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,3068,"['ONE', 'LAST', 'THING', 'Dylan', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'teenager', 'who', 'dying', 'terminal', 'brain', 'illness', 'Make-A-Wish-type', 'organization', 'Dylan', 'expected', 'ask', 'spend', 'day', 'fishing', 'professional', 'football', 'player', 'idolized', 'years', 'Prompted', 'conversation', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'earlier', 'Dylan', 'instead', 'would', 'like', 'spend', 'one', 'evening', 'alone', 'supermodel', 'Nikki', 'Sinclaire', 'Sunny', 'Mabrey', 'foundation', 'people', 'are', 'shocked', 'Dylan', 'mother', 'Carol', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'However', 'announcement', 'quickly', 'Dylan', 'mini-celebrity', 'having', 'balls', 'ask', 'something', 'apparently', 'guy', 'planet', 'would', 'want', 'Eventually', 'Carol', 'along', 'son', 'wish', 'everything', 'can', 'help', 'see', 'become', 'reality', 'Meanwhile', 'Nikki', 'life', 'major', 'turmoil', 'gained', 'reputation', 'being', 'diva', 'amount', 'booze', 'drugs', 'sex', 'current', 'boy', 'toy', 'seem', 'help', 'dropped', 'major', 'gig', 'publicist', 'hearing', 'Dylan', 'request', 'perfect', 'PR', 'opportunity', 'Nikki', 'revamp', 'career', 'meet', 'greet', 'take', 'photo', 'leave', 'Everyone', 'happy', 'right', 'Not', 'quite', 'Dylan', 'determined', 'spend', 'evening', 'Nikki', 'trip', 'two', 'friends', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'convince', 'spend', 'one', 'evening', 'course', 'while', 'Dylan', 'headaches', 'are', 'getting', 'worse', 'seeing', 'images', 'dead', 'father.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'ONE', 'LAST', 'THING', 'credit', 'trying', 'be', 'resonant', 'film', 'full', 'dark', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'treat', 'subject', 'matter', 'lightly', 'Dylan', 'going', 'die', 'film', 'detail', 'exploring', 'how', 'boy', 'death.However', 'attempt', 'ONE', 'LAST', 'THING', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'got', 'better', 'half-way', 'never', 'did', 'grab', 'attention', 'One', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'cast', 'excellent', 'writing', 'decent', 'witty', 'comedy', 'serious', 'drama', 'involved', 'pacing', 'feels', 'right', 'look', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'out', 'place.Nevertheless', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'gels', 'never', 'consistent', 'tone', 'film', 'were', 'novel', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'authors', 'fail', 'show', 'sign', 'original', 'style', 'filmmakers', 'ONE', 'LAST', 'THING', 'are', 'relatively', 'new', 'so', 'style', ""n't"", 'issue', 'yet', 'tone', 'movie', 'deals', 'important', 'issues', 'black', 'humorous', 'moments', 'two', 'never', 'mesh', 'One', 'moment', 'movie', 'feels', 'serious', 'drama', 'next', 'be', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Back', 'forth', 'Up', 'down', 'consistency.It', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'even', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'been', 'promoted', 'having', 'spiritual', 'message', 'not', 'Several', 'times', 'movie', 'Dylan', 'given', 'opportunity', 'explore', 'spirituality', 'attempt', 'very', 'clear', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God', 'when', 'go', 'Heaven', 'where', 'earthly', 'father', 'waiting', 'might', 'appear', 'spiritual', 'moment', 'reality', 'not', 'blatant', 'promotion', 'universalism']",N/A
