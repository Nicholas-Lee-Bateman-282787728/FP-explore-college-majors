Three individual dvd's @ 100 minutes apiece. One complete series 300 minutes. It's definitely kid oriented ... well, 99%(Jennifer). One thing i did like was how the subtitles for the opening credits would alternate between English and Japaneses. Commentaries from series creator, & the one of the voice actors. The story made itself different enough from the game to keep me interested. My only complaint with the story was the never gave closure to the one episode. Who or what was that person really, & what was Mid-boss's connection? A second season would be nice. This is definitely a buy for anyone who is a fan, or just couldn't get into the game, & wanted to finish up the story. The game's advantage is different endings. Now that's a thought for dvd/blu-ray. Imagine as special feature home viewing you could choose how the story could progress, & perhaps end ...",4,disgaea anime review,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,980,"['simply', 'collection', 'three/3', 'disgaea', 'dvd', 'one', 'package', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'more', 'Do', 'math', 'Three', 'individual', 'dvd', '@', '100', 'minutes', 'apiece', 'One', 'complete', 'series', '300', 'minutes', 'definitely', 'kid', 'oriented', 'well', '99', '%', 'Jennifer', 'One', 'thing', 'i', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'how', 'subtitles', 'opening', 'credits', 'would', 'alternate', 'English', 'Japaneses', 'Commentaries', 'series', 'creator', 'one', 'voice', 'actors', 'story', 'made', 'different', 'enough', 'game', 'keep', 'interested', 'only', 'complaint', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'gave', 'closure', 'one', 'episode', 'Who', 'what', 'was', 'person', 'really', 'what', 'was', 'Mid-boss', 'connection', 'second', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'definitely', 'buy', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'game', 'wanted', 'finish', 'up', 'story', 'game', 'advantage', 'different', 'endings', 'Now', 'thought', 'dvd/blu-ray', 'Imagine', 'special', 'feature', 'home', 'viewing', 'could', 'choose', 'how', 'story', 'could', 'progress', 'perhaps', 'end']",N/A

The way it should be.Start-up ads can't be skipped, annoying!Special Features:Disc 2: Clean open/close. Trailers(Previews) - Ragnarok and Sgt. Frog were okay. Soul Eater, Tsubasa (actually season 2 + OVAs), Full Metal Alchemist (actually Part 3) are useless to tell what the story is about. Kaliedo Star (actually Season 2 + OVA) is almost as useless. FLCL was not good, but the series is confusing enough that trying to describe it is probably beyond the limited abilities of whoever made the ad anyway. ;pThis is an anime based on a video game (series of games actually). Unlike most in this ""class"" of anime, this one was actually very good. It didn't run like watching someone play the video game on your TV. Plot, character development and story developed well. Animation was a bit older/""kiddie"" (think Pokemon) but the writing and direction were great. Mid and backgrounds were often excellent art. One opinion: Laharl laughs maniacally early in the series... it is one of the most pathetic maniacal laughs I've heard. You sort of get used to it as the series goes on though. Otherwise the voice acting and direction are great.Overall I greatly enjoyed this, but I wasn't a great fan of the ending chosen. It was good, but a little unexpected. Not necessarily a bad thing I guess and it may grow on me with further viewing. As game based animes, it is one of the best I have seen and may change my mind on the whole sub-genre which I generally avoid.The story is about Laharl, a demon and heir to the throne of the demon world who was placed into a 2  year sleep by an attempt to poison him. During an attempt by an angel in training to assassinate him (thinking it was his father) he is awakened and begins his quest to take his rightful place as ruler. Laharl, the angel and an impish female demon begin the search for the castle and the book of demons required to declare Laharl ruler. They are aided, or sometimes hindered, by the Prinneys, penguin-like souls seeking redemption and who always end their sentences with ""dood!"".While based on a video game, this one (as an anime) would be at least T for Teen, so probably isn't suitable for children unfortunately. Some is situational but mostly language.",5,New outlook on game based anime for me.,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,2431,"['Ratings', 'are', 'guesstimate', 'usually', 'safe', 'side', '.Sub-genre', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi/Fantasy', 'romanceSituations', 'PGLanguage', 'Probably', 'PG+Nudity', 'PGViolence', 'PGLanguage', 'options', 'Dub', 'Sub', 'separate', 'on/off', 'option', 'way', 'should', 'be.Start-up', 'ads', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'skipped', 'annoying', 'Special', 'Features', 'Disc', '2', 'Clean', 'open/close', 'Trailers', 'Previews', 'Ragnarok', 'Sgt', 'Frog', 'were', 'okay', 'Soul', 'Eater', 'Tsubasa', 'actually', 'season', '2', '+', 'OVAs', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'actually', 'Part', '3', 'are', 'useless', 'tell', 'what', 'story', 'about', 'Kaliedo', 'Star', 'actually', 'Season', '2', '+', 'OVA', 'almost', 'useless', 'FLCL', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'series', 'confusing', 'enough', 'trying', 'describe', 'probably', 'limited', 'abilities', 'made', 'ad', 'anyway', 'pThis', 'anime', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'games', 'actually', 'most', 'class', 'anime', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'watching', 'someone', 'play', 'video', 'game', 'TV', 'Plot', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'developed', 'well', 'Animation', 'was', 'bit', 'older/', 'kiddie', 'think', 'Pokemon', 'writing', 'direction', 'were', 'great', 'Mid', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'often', 'excellent', 'art', 'One', 'opinion', 'Laharl', 'maniacally', 'early', 'series', 'one', 'most', 'pathetic', 'maniacal', 'laughs', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'sort', 'get', 'used', 'series', 'Otherwise', 'voice', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'great.Overall', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'fan', 'ending', 'chosen', 'was', 'good', 'little', 'unexpected', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'guess', 'may', 'grow', 'further', 'viewing', 'game', 'based', 'animes', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'may', 'change', 'mind', 'whole', 'sub-genre', 'generally', 'avoid.The', 'story', 'Laharl', 'demon', 'heir', 'throne', 'demon', 'world', 'who', 'was', 'placed', '2', 'year', 'sleep', 'attempt', 'poison', 'attempt', 'angel', 'training', 'assassinate', 'thinking', 'was', 'father', 'awakened', 'quest', 'take', 'rightful', 'place', 'ruler', 'Laharl', 'angel', 'impish', 'female', 'demon', 'begin', 'search', 'castle', 'book', 'demons', 'required', 'declare', 'Laharl', 'ruler', 'are', 'aided', 'sometimes', 'hindered', 'Prinneys', 'penguin-like', 'souls', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'who', 'always', 'end', 'sentences', 'dood', '.While', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'one', 'anime', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'T', 'Teen', 'so', 'probably', ""n't"", 'suitable', 'children', 'unfortunately', 'situational', 'mostly', 'language']",N/A

1388149,A182VTJIIEVM37,B00477VLZU,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 1]","I love Disgaea 1 of course, but I don't usually do anime that are based on the game because it usually ends badly (not counting Pokemon). The anime takes its own spin on the game changing things up. However by doing so, some things don't end well. Etna for the most part is pretty useless now and she's just as much as a damsel in distress as Flonne is (though it's stretching it given Flonne isn't completely helpless in any of the games). Some arcs were taken out and swapped around to make room with many filler arcs. Gordon, Jennifer and Thursday are just the Team Rocket of the anime always blasting off because of some inconvenience.Looking back now though, the episode with Maharl is funny given that the new Disgaea game Dimension 2.0 is taking that plot and putting it in the game and making it more realized (and I'm going to even say that its going to end up the same way as this anime episode).I think the Red Moon episode is the most emotional episode in the series and makes it just as depressing. Add to the fact Mid-Boss is here makes it even more tragic.But the ending...let's just say that they thought it would be great to take the normal ending and use it for the anime with a twist never mind that every other continuity whether it be the game or manga or novel says the good ending is canon. The normal ending is just used for shock value and disappointing people who wanted a happy ending and lowers the score.Overall, a good anime to watch but prepare to be disappointed with the last episode (there should be more action too but...)",4,Good Anime Based Game But Crappy Ending,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1557,"['love', 'Disgaea', '1', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'do', 'anime', 'are', 'based', 'game', 'usually', 'badly', 'not', 'counting', 'Pokemon', 'anime', 'own', 'spin', 'game', 'changing', 'things', 'up', 'However', 'doing', 'so', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'Etna', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'useless', 'now', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Flonne', 'stretching', 'given', 'Flonne', ""n't"", 'completely', 'helpless', 'games', 'arcs', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'swapped', 'make', 'room', 'many', 'filler', 'arcs', 'Gordon', 'Jennifer', 'Thursday', 'are', 'just', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'anime', 'always', 'blasting', 'off', 'inconvenience.Looking', 'back', 'now', 'episode', 'Maharl', 'funny', 'given', 'new', 'Disgaea', 'game', 'Dimension', '2.0', 'taking', 'plot', 'putting', 'game', 'making', 'more', 'realized', ""'m"", 'going', 'even', 'say', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'way', 'anime', 'episode', 'think', 'Red', 'Moon', 'episode', 'most', 'emotional', 'episode', 'series', 'just', 'depressing', 'Add', 'fact', 'Mid-Boss', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'tragic.But', 'ending', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'take', 'normal', 'ending', 'use', 'anime', 'twist', 'never', 'mind', 'other', 'continuity', 'be', 'game', 'manga', 'novel', 'good', 'ending', 'canon', 'normal', 'ending', 'just', 'used', 'shock', 'value', 'disappointing', 'people', 'who', 'wanted', 'happy', 'ending', 'score.Overall', 'good', 'anime', 'watch', 'prepare', 'be', 'disappointed', 'last', 'episode', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'action', 'too']",N/A
