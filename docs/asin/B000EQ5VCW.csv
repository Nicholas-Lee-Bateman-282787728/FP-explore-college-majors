They haven't written any new stuff yet, but if you're a fan, I strongly suggest you write their website, to give them a bit of a push. If you like Kerry's theme music for this DVD's menu section, (as well as the last), then you'll realise just what an interesting prospect a debut CD might be! And, having heard ""Free Hand"", on their website, I can assure you that Kerry, Gary and Malcolm haven't slipped one bit, either! And... Who knows? Perhaps some of the other guys, (who never would have envisioned this happening), might just decide to come back into the fold, as well!Now, about this DVD...

GG at the GG is PURE GOLD! The videos promoting ""Interview"" are priceless, and the videos for the ""Giant For A Day"" album made me appreciate those songs much more than I did when they were originally released.The real treat is the BBC live concert from Golders Green! GG is in top form belting out some of their best works from ""Free Hand"", ""The Power And The Glory,"" and gems from ""The Missing Piece"" as well as other classics. The sound and video are both excellent! I found myself dancing and singing along with song after song!This wonderful DVD proved to me what I always knew about GG. Their music didn't need any huge stage production of the kind their (less gifted) contemporaries put on. The music was all you needed. King Crimson was the only contemporary band of that time that deserved to be compared to GG, and I loved GG more. All of the other ""progs"" were overblown pretenders to the throne.While I wish GG had achieved the fame and tons of money they so richly deserved, I will always think of GG as the extraordinary group that blew me away at that intimate little club all of us GG fans attended. That smokey little jazz bar by the warf where you could here the haunting voices of sirens in a song called ""His Last Voyage,"" as Gary Green's solo chills the spine with the cries of drowning sailors.Many thanks to Kerry Minnear for the wonderful NEW music added to the menus.

I bought every album but never got to see them live. Well, this was everything I expected - and more! This DVD has excellent picture quality considering these films were made during the 70s and the audio also sounds great. I really enjoyed the videos as well as the concert. Watching these guys play proves they were one of the best bands of the 70s and sadly overlooked. Derek Schulman has an incredible voice and should have gone on to perform on the same level as Peter Gabriel or Phil Collins. He had that kind of power and control in his voice that really displays intense emotions. I really miss these guys and I'm very glad to see them releasing this DVD. It said in the liner notes that Kerry recorded the keyboard music and used some previous session drumming from John during the menu display.

977239,A2ZKAK8WNWCYEF,B000EQ5VCW,"W. Dent ""Life Lover""","[8, 8]","At the time that Gentle Giant's first album was released, I believe the average age of the band members was early twenties. I and my musical counterparts were only a year or two younger than they yet the music Gentle Giant played was so far above our own abilities. Technical prowess, versatility and youth aside, their talent to write and play like no one had written or played before or since was astounding. Originality was never a stumbling block for this band...NEVER! So given these credentials, one would expect a live performance from this band to be every bit as amazing and in so assuming, one would be correct. From the very first notes of Two Weeks in Spain to the last in Mountain Time, Gentle Giant (GG) are ON! Time ceases to exist as we are presented with ageless music, relevant to any decade. Unlike other bands from that era (Yes and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer for instance), GG's music is not dated. There is something about this music that just doesn't attach itself to any era and is as at home in 2006 as it was in 1978, when this performance was recorded. That each player is a virtuoso in his own right goes undisputed. That each member tosses off his ""main"" instrument for another which he plays, it seems, just as well, with the ease that most of us change shirts, is, well, amazing! That GG's music gives each his many opportunities to show off his abilities is obvious to the listener. With all of the flash each carefully crafted song gives off, perhaps the wonder of it all is contained in the subtleties. That which seems to capture my imagination is the once played and not to be repeated, perfect little guitar line so integral to the song that in its' absence, the song would be an entirely different matter....yet it appears only once and for less than ten seconds, its' understated importance nonetheless in tact! GG's songs are full of these ""understated"" elegant segments when woven together and stamped with that beautiful smiling face of THE Giant (whose face adorns so much of the band's work), make for the most interesting music (my opinion) ever written. What this DVD does is to confirm that GG was every bit the talented group of musicians as their records made them out to be. This was not a band that needed to hide behind studio gimmics. Their live performances were even more exciting than their studio albums. Audiences could see that these musicians could play with conviction and dynamic (with soul if you will) these difficultpieces of music and be downright funky while doing it (see 'Playing the Game' for proof). In all, the twelve songs which make up the 'concert' portion of the DVD are incredibly played, impeccably captured by the cameras, and are perfectly transported per the extraordinary sound engineering which never betrays the live feel of the band. When the last note had faded, I sat with the same exhillaration I felt after seeing the band in concert (live and in person) back in 1978. That's when it hit me that watching this DVD is as close to experiencing GG live in concert as most will ever get. For my money, it is definitely worth it and then some!
