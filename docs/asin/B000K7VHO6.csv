The disciples were too militant!The plot was completely RIDICULOUS! The movie focused solely on the Romans search for the ""Black Nazarene"", and none of Jesus' teachings or miracles were touched on. When Mary asked Joseph, ""Do they want to kill him because he's black!!!!"" ended it for me.  The rest of the movie from that point was garbage.  Someone mentioned that the Ressurection should have been touched on, too.  All I have to say in response to that (and in response to my OWN review) is that you can't really delve into the more pertinent aspects of the life of Jesus because this movie so poorly focused on race.  This was trash!I have no problem with modernizing historical stories (prime examples Romeo and Juliet, and Othello), but to add a modern ""controversy"" and keep all other aspects of the story the same just didn't work for me.The best part of the movie to me is the Final Supper.

1031743,A3AGZNJMFJ8XUA,B000K7VHO6,"Itani Mullik ""Redd""","[7, 12]","First things first, speaking as a man of African, European, and Native American descent...I appreciate this work of art not because it's one of the first theatrical releases based on the life of Christ depcting Him as a ""dark-skinned Nazarene,"" but because it, in my opinion, challenges the racial biases, mindsets, and walls that have divided Christians(and people in general for that matter) for ages with the depiction of Jesus Christ(bka Yeshua Ha Meshiach) as a Black Jew. Looking at other reviews, particularly those that renounce the possibility of Jesus being black as being a modern day invention and false, I have to disagree because there are mid-eastern people who are blacker than black, and it's a confirmed fact that there are Jews of darker shades (from Africa, Asia, India,etc), so I'm prompted to acknowledge the fact that this film also addresses the racial stigmas that exist within Judaism to this day(ie, Ethiopic Jews are not welcomed by some ""traditional"" Jews because they resemble the descendants of Cush or are accused of being halfbreeds like the Samaritans of Jesus' time who were half Jewish/half Babylonian). I feel that the question posed is whether or not the Church abroad would accept the 2nd coming if Jesus didn't share her racial features? If you ask me...we have a long way to go.As far as my critique of the film, as is proposed, we have as good and classical a presentation of the life of Christ as ever, particularly His last 48 hrs(a la Passion of the Christ). I enjoyed the spin put on by the racial implications(not as overwhelming as I'd expected), I even enjoyed the fact that Joseph was alive throughout Jesus' ministry(it actually is disputed nowadays whether or not Jospeh died during Jesus' childhood as is traditionally taught),good acting, and a good Semitic feel. My only qualms are with the portrayal of Mary Magdala, yet again, as a prostitute by trade(via Pope Gregory's splicing together of accounts of women anointing Jesus' feet) and the fact that we see a Christ Who didn't seem to expect a resurrection...as a matter of fact, He doesn't resurrect in this film at all...I feel the resurrection of an ethnic Christ would've enhanced the message...that faith is more than skin deep. STILL...good movie, not for the religiously boxed-in or for the culturally biased. If your love for Christ is unconditional, you'll appreciate just because He's the Way.

Tarin ""EveryoneIsBlindnDeaf""","[6, 10]","Well as if this movie wasn't yet another lame attempt at portraying Jesus wasn't bad enough the acting and production is one of the worst ever.  The real blunder is what seems to be the norm in these movies, like The Passion, Jesus of Nazareth, is that it bring you up to the cross, then takes maybe a step after, then ""blink"" the movie is over.  As if this was just another senseless murder that has gone on through history.Look, if your going to make a movie about a man who, its clear if you just read his story in the gospels, clearly said he came to die, and that everything ""everything"" that he is focusing on while here on earth is all about the resurrection.The gospels are only the start of the New Testament, then it goes on was longer after that.  With plenty of information and stories about after the resurrection.Now, you don't have to believe in it, that is your free will.But this is ""His"" story, and how it's told.  So if you're going to do a movie on ""Him"" then you can't just clip out one half.The Cross is one half; the resurrection is the other half.You can't have one without the other.It's as simple as that.Do it right or leave it alone.( ps, if you want to really laugh and I mean really bust a gut, see ""the Green Pastures""  its just out on DVD.  look it up here in amazon.  I found this on accident and well, its about a black heaven, and its made along time ago, but its so wordy, you will have to stop the dvd all the time because because you are laughing so hard you miss what they say next.
