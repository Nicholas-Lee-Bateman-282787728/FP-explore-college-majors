1389107,A26FPHC71C5IX3,B00488YCOA,Aryael de Kaprii,"[1, 2]","So this film is a little different, erotic fantasy type film about a cute blond guy who has to be sexually penetrated very hard to see visions. Visions of what? That I am not too sure about. He thinks that he is connecting to his twin brother, and it seems the premise of this film is that he is in search of this missing brother. He is a ""rent boy"" and seems to be easily manhandled and open for sexual abuse to anyone walking by because his focus is on searching for this brother. Someone mentioned that this film is about the exploitation of young attractive men by the gay porn industry, I didnt really see that in this film, but I will say that there seems to be a underlying critism of bareback gay pornographic films. While this movie could have been a lot better, I have to admit the eye candy was quite pleasant, however if good looking guys is all one is looking for, I would think that your money could be better spent on a film that is made specifically for sexual titilation. There is something about this film that I found interesting outside of the shallow attractiveness of the actors. There are some obscure literary references and some issues that spark thought. I would like to reference the any truth behind the story of the man who like Jack the Ripper killed prostitutes, however this man killed attractive young men that worked the street corners. This movie has little things that pop up every now and then that are fascinating, but the main character Paul is nice to look at none-the-less.",4,Underlying Message?,1307491200,"06 8, 2011",2011,1514,"['So', 'film', 'little', 'different', 'erotic', 'fantasy', 'type', 'film', 'cute', 'blond', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'sexually', 'penetrated', 'very', 'hard', 'see', 'visions', 'Visions', 'what', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'connecting', 'twin', 'brother', 'premise', 'film', 'search', 'missing', 'brother', 'rent', 'boy', 'be', 'easily', 'manhandled', 'open', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'anyone', 'walking', 'focus', 'searching', 'brother', 'Someone', 'mentioned', 'film', 'exploitation', 'young', 'attractive', 'men', 'gay', 'porn', 'industry', 'didnt', 'really', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'there', 'be', 'underlying', 'critism', 'bareback', 'gay', 'pornographic', 'films', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'have', 'admit', 'eye', 'candy', 'was', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'however', 'good', 'looking', 'guys', 'one', 'looking', 'would', 'think', 'money', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'spent', 'film', 'made', 'specifically', 'sexual', 'titilation', 'something', 'film', 'found', 'interesting', 'shallow', 'attractiveness', 'actors', 'are', 'obscure', 'literary', 'references', 'issues', 'spark', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'reference', 'truth', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'killed', 'prostitutes', 'however', 'man', 'killed', 'attractive', 'young', 'men', 'worked', 'street', 'corners', 'movie', 'little', 'things', 'pop', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'are', 'fascinating', 'main', 'character', 'Paul', 'nice', 'look', 'none-the-less']",Seeing Heaven

1389109,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00488YCOA,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[2, 2]","Paul is a beautiful young escort in the UK, who is searching for his long lost twin brother, Saul.  When Paul is having sex with a client, he sometimes gets visions of his brother somewhere in danger, and the visions are more acute the more dangerous and enthusiastic the action is.  When he gets an offer to do a ""tasteful"" porn film with a young director to whom he is referred, he senses a possible connection to his brother there, and goes for it, despite his initial misgivings about it. Paul is afraid about how dark and dangerous his encounters are getting, but feels this is the price he needs to pay to save his brother from whatever danger he is witnessing in his visions.This is not an easy film to watch, not just because of the dark content, but also because of the quick shifts to scenes for seconds at a time, occasional mumbled dialogue, and - at first - an overall vibe that makes the film seem like a cross between a DeCoteau ""boys in briefs"" horror schlockfest and a softcore porn film. But stay with it, as the plot (such as it is) becomes clearer as the film goes on, and there is actually a significant amount of suspense surrounding the eventual solution.  The camera loves newcomer Alexander Bracq, who shows significant talent in the tough lead role as Paul.  DVD includes cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes and a video diary.
