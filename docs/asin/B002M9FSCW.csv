1277965,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B002M9FSCW,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 2]","END GAMEWhen I first heard about this movie I was a bit surprised by it, Kurt Angle starring in a movie. Of course you know I had to have it so I went out and got it, actually I had a friend pick it up for me, still my money. Now I am not to sure how I should of spent that money, this film is really not what it should have been. Don't get me wrong I love Kurt Angle, he is one of the best wrestlers to ever live. I mean both in amateur and pro so he has a lot going for him, and to be honest for his first real film he is not bad [he was in a short film previous to this].The film is about a deranged serial killer who likes trick his victims into a comfort zone with him, and then takes them out. His name is Brad Mayfield [Angle] and he has been living this life taken out female victims for his own pleasure. That is until Officer Dan Burk [Eric Wright] is assigned to the case is on the hunt for the killer. But the killer starts to hunt him back a little and even brings his family into it. As the stakes rise and the killer becomes more obsessed with the cop after him then film starts to move along.Now let me say from the start that I was pleasantly surprised by Angle playing the killer here, it was a very villains role for him to play. With that said the cover of this film makes you thing he will be the hero or something along the lines of your typical action film a pro wrestler would star in. not the case here, and to be honest while he seems a bit wooden at times as the film goes along he quickly becomes the best actor in this film. No where near Oscar worthy but he has the potential to be real good.As far as every one else it is kinda hit and miss and more so on the miss, Eric Wright is just straight bad. Now if he was told to do a very over the top yet wooden performance then he is the greatest actor out there. Like Angle he seems like he has some skill even to do something good acting wise but unlike Angle he doesn't really show it here. Also his character is supposed to be the hero here but he starts to cheat on his wife one of the victims after her roommate is killed early in the film.Everyone else does alright here looking like the are just happy being in a movie, but I must say that  George Drennen did a great job here for the minute he was in it as the hotel manager. Seriously he actually acted and it is one of the better scenes in the movie. But other than that writer McCartney James should have put more time into this script, the story is good but the dialogue and character development could have been stronger. Director Bruce Koehler has some more films starring Angle coming so here's to hoping they will be better. Also to be honest this is one of those films that if you accept that it is bad then you may actually enjoy it. Also it would have been great to hear an audio commentary on this film, director, writer, producer, and star talking about it. Or any one or mix of those.",3,I'LL GIVE IT 3 FOR KURT,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,2933,"['END', 'GAMEWhen', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'Kurt', 'Angle', 'starring', 'movie', 'course', 'know', 'had', 'have', 'so', 'went', 'out', 'got', 'actually', 'had', 'friend', 'pick', 'up', 'still', 'money', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'should', 'spent', 'money', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Kurt', 'Angle', 'one', 'best', 'wrestlers', 'ever', 'live', 'mean', 'amateur', 'pro', 'so', 'lot', 'going', 'be', 'honest', 'first', 'real', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'short', 'film', 'previous', ']', '.The', 'film', 'deranged', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'trick', 'victims', 'comfort', 'zone', 'then', 'out', 'name', 'Brad', 'Mayfield', '[', 'Angle', ']', 'been', 'living', 'life', 'taken', 'out', 'female', 'victims', 'own', 'pleasure', 'Officer', 'Dan', 'Burk', '[', 'Eric', 'Wright', ']', 'assigned', 'case', 'hunt', 'killer', 'killer', 'hunt', 'back', 'little', 'even', 'family', 'stakes', 'rise', 'killer', 'more', 'obsessed', 'cop', 'then', 'film', 'move', 'along.Now', 'say', 'start', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Angle', 'playing', 'killer', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'villains', 'role', 'play', 'said', 'cover', 'film', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'hero', 'something', 'lines', 'typical', 'action', 'film', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'would', 'star', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'be', 'honest', 'bit', 'wooden', 'times', 'film', 'quickly', 'best', 'actor', 'film', 'where', 'near', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'potential', 'be', 'real', 'good.As', 'far', 'one', 'else', 'kinda', 'hit', 'miss', 'more', 'so', 'miss', 'Eric', 'Wright', 'just', 'straight', 'bad', 'Now', 'was', 'told', 'do', 'very', 'top', 'yet', 'wooden', 'performance', 'then', 'greatest', 'actor', 'there', 'Angle', 'skill', 'even', 'do', 'something', 'good', 'acting', 'wise', 'Angle', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'here', 'Also', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'hero', 'here', 'cheat', 'wife', 'one', 'victims', 'roommate', 'killed', 'early', 'film.Everyone', 'else', 'alright', 'here', 'looking', 'are', 'just', 'happy', 'being', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'George', 'Drennen', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'minute', 'was', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Seriously', 'actually', 'acted', 'one', 'better', 'scenes', 'movie', 'other', 'writer', 'McCartney', 'James', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'more', 'time', 'script', 'story', 'good', 'dialogue', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'Director', 'Bruce', 'Koehler', 'more', 'films', 'starring', 'Angle', 'coming', 'so', 'here', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'Also', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'films', 'accept', 'bad', 'then', 'may', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'hear', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'director', 'writer', 'producer', 'star', 'talking', 'one', 'mix']",End Game
1277966,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B002M9FSCW,"Jeff Johnson ""Jeff Johnson""","[1, 2]","A sadistic killer is on the loose and he's very thorough about picking his victims and covering his tracks. After his first victim, he wipes out everyone else that ever knew her. If that at all sounds thrilling or interesting, that gets stomped out within the first minute.Former Olympic gold medalist, Kurt Angle is the star of this movie and his first line was, ""It's cheap, so I can burry the body."" That one line sums up the movie perfectly. This clearly looks like it was a college project on a $1,000 budget. The credits were over in 30 seconds.The blank expressions of the actors on the cover sum up the acting ability in this movie.Everyone is awkward and monotone. The best actor was a glorified extra with 4 lines. It's obvious no one had any acting experience, which can't be true considering Kurt Angle has been on television every week for the past decade.This should have been a ""tour de force"" for Kurt. He gets to use disguises (one is a clown named Buffo), different voices, and different tense situations when dealing with cops, his victims and the roommate of the first victim who gets targeted as ""the next victim."" Unfortunately for Kurt's acting career, it's just like a mannequin with a different wig. Those tense moments I mentioned are never actually tense. It's just another scene with a pair of mannequins standing there.Everyone that meets the killer seems to die... People that knew the first victim, an office tryst. The detective's wife is left alive. Kurt probably figured she'd die of laughter when Kurt was dressed as Buffo the clown and said, ""Hello Mrs. Burke I was hired by your daughter's dad Mr. Burke.""When the detective's daughter is kidnapped, the 6 year old just goes right along with it. She looked bored. Then when the killer murders someone right in front of her, there is zero reaction from the girl. They mention later she's a special needs child, but in the end... want to know who puts a stop to the killer by shooting him??? I'll spoil it. The 6 year old! She was only in 4 scenes, one of which she was asleep.Maybe she had to do it, because there's no one to cheer for in this movie. Your choices are the killer, ""the next victim"" who is a placeholder or the police detective that cheats on his wife with ""the next victim."" ""The next victim"" is very gullible and she first meets the killer when he's posing as a police detective with a trench coat disguise, and then meets him later at a bar. Maybe she was inebriated from drinking, but she ends up on a boat with him. It made me think how did we go from him meeting her at a bar to them vacationing on a boat with a man she just met? A clever twist would have been that she agreed to it knowing he was the killer so she could get revenge on him for killing her roommate so she could sleep safe at night. The police protection she was under didn't seem to mean much anyway.The camera shots were LONG. Like one camera angle per 2 minutes. Because of this, it really felt like each scene had 2 actors standing around. That's why all other movies have different angles like tight on this actor's face, close up on that actor, have them walking as they're talking, have a slew of extras to give a set life.Outside of the poorly delivered raunchy dialog in the first 4 minutes, there's nothing to justify an R rating. Even the warning says ""BRIEF language."" There's no blood and even the strip club scene leaves everything to your imagination.",1,One of the blandest movies ever made.
