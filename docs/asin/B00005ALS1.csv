First thing I'd like to say is that the two Oscar winners in the movie, in my opinion, are the weakest parts of this movie.  Kevin Spacey is a wonderful actor, but his melodrama in this movie is nauseating, and Helen Hunt does not pull off the &quot;drunken mother&quot; role at all.  I felt the strongest parts of this movie were Jim Caviezel's homeless man and the story of Jay Mohr trying to find out where this all started.I've heard countless people say the following:a.  It has a good message.b.  The ending is so sad.c.  I wish this could really happen.Here are my answers to these:a.  The message is good, but if all you're looking for is a message, pick up a bible.b.  The ending isn't that sad.  The movie itself was so cliched, you can almost expect the ending.c.  If you want this to really happen, stop wishing it and go out and do a good deed.That's my 2 cents worth.  Don't waste your time with this movie.  The great actors that are in it have all done better stuff.

577769,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005ALS1,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","This movie is pure sentimental saccharine schmaltz, in the line of Ron Howard yet not as effective or as expertly handled, but I still gobble it up like it were peach cobbler and sob like a baby who lost his binky.  I mean, this movie is simultaneously forced and honest, and that is thanks to the splendid acting and the contrived script.The base prose for `Pay it Forward' is quite simple.  A young kid with bid ideas finds that his new teacher has motivated him to put into play a plan that could alter the face of the world.  Asked to come up with an idea that could change the world, young Trevor decides that if he were to do something to help three people and those three people helped three other people (and so on and so forth) then the world could be a better place for everyone.  Trevor immediately sets his sights on his mother, an alcoholic struggling to take care of her son, and a junkie in need of a fresh start.Where the film goes wrong, for me, is in trying to make too much of this `idea'.  The idea should have been a metaphor for what young Trevor was experiencing at home, in his life, struggling to find something better and pay himself forward so-to-speak.  The film tries to go that way in parts (the natural development of his mother, played brilliantly by Helen Hunt, is one thing this film nails) but the way it handles the phenomenon that this idea became kind of relinquishes the effect it should have had to a mere punch line.  It loses a lot of its weight and emotional power by spreading it too thin.Yes, the ending is crafted for the sole purpose of bleeding your tear ducts, but I wouldn't have changed it.The best thing about this film is, by far, the performances.  Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment have all been better, but that doesn't mean that they don't work this material over very well here.  Osment has to kind of carry the film, for he needs to sell us on his childlike innocence as well as his matured sense of understanding, and he does so beautifully.  Kevin Spacey is an actor who I really like, a lot.  He manages to take a gimmicky character (burn victim/inspirational teacher) and make him human (that whole ""my father"" scene just broke my heart).  But, just like in `As Good As It Gets', best in show awards can be showered upon only one person, and that is Helen Hunt.  She is outstanding as Trevor's emotionally unstable mother.  Her frailties are beautifully tempered by her overly assertive sense of strength.  She tries so hard and yet falls so far, and it is seen all over the creases in her face.The film is as schmaltzy as they come, and it doesn't try to hide that fact.  It is designed to do one thing, make you cry, and it does that with ease.  I would have loved this subject to have been dissected and tackled with a little more earnest grit (and honest realism), since the performances truly deserved it, but in the end I am more than satisfied with the way this film pans out.",4,Get ready to cry...,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,2959,"['movie', 'pure', 'sentimental', 'saccharine', 'schmaltz', 'line', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'yet', 'not', 'effective', 'as', 'expertly', 'handled', 'still', 'gobble', 'up', 'were', 'peach', 'cobbler', 'sob', 'baby', 'who', 'lost', 'binky', 'mean', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'forced', 'honest', 'thanks', 'splendid', 'acting', 'contrived', 'script.The', 'base', 'prose', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'quite', 'simple', 'young', 'kid', 'bid', 'ideas', 'new', 'teacher', 'motivated', 'put', 'play', 'plan', 'could', 'alter', 'face', 'world', 'Asked', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'could', 'change', 'world', 'young', 'Trevor', 'were', 'do', 'something', 'help', 'three', 'people', 'three', 'people', 'helped', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'then', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'everyone', 'Trevor', 'immediately', 'sights', 'mother', 'alcoholic', 'struggling', 'take', 'care', 'son', 'junkie', 'need', 'fresh', 'start.Where', 'film', 'wrong', 'trying', 'make', 'too', 'much', 'idea', 'idea', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'metaphor', 'what', 'young', 'Trevor', 'was', 'experiencing', 'home', 'life', 'struggling', 'find', 'something', 'better', 'pay', 'forward', 'so-to-speak', 'film', 'tries', 'go', 'way', 'parts', 'natural', 'development', 'mother', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'nails', 'way', 'phenomenon', 'idea', 'became', 'kind', 'relinquishes', 'effect', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'mere', 'punch', 'line', 'lot', 'weight', 'emotional', 'power', 'spreading', 'too', 'thin.Yes', 'ending', 'crafted', 'sole', 'purpose', 'bleeding', 'tear', 'ducts', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'changed', 'it.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'far', 'performances', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'have', 'been', 'better', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'material', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'Osment', 'kind', 'carry', 'film', 'sell', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'as', 'well', 'matured', 'sense', 'understanding', 'so', 'beautifully', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'lot', 'take', 'gimmicky', 'character', 'burn', 'victim/inspirational', 'teacher', 'make', 'human', 'father', 'scene', 'just', 'broke', 'heart', 'just', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'best', 'show', 'awards', 'can', 'be', 'showered', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'outstanding', 'Trevor', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'mother', 'frailties', 'are', 'beautifully', 'tempered', 'overly', 'assertive', 'sense', 'strength', 'so', 'hard', 'yet', 'falls', 'so', 'far', 'seen', 'creases', 'face.The', 'film', 'as', 'schmaltzy', 'come', ""n't"", 'try', 'hide', 'fact', 'designed', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'make', 'cry', 'ease', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'subject', 'have', 'been', 'dissected', 'tackled', 'little', 'more', 'earnest', 'grit', 'honest', 'realism', 'performances', 'truly', 'deserved', 'end', 'am', 'more', 'satisfied', 'way', 'film', 'out']",N/A

577772,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B00005ALS1,Anthony Hinde,"[11, 11]","I don't know whether professional reviewers are jaded with life or just naturally cynical but they seem to dismiss far too many films as overly sentimental or contrived. ""Pay It Forward"" is an emotional film, it will make you cry but that does not make it corny. I am not suggesting you have to open your heart and close your mind to enjoy this film. All you need do is not close yourself off to your soul, because Mimi Leder's film has enough soul of its own for your's to recognize.Based on a book by Catherine Ryan Hyde, which was unpublished when the script was written, ""Pay It Forward"", has now become a worldwide movement; and after seeing the film, that should come as no  surprise. The story has no hint of religious denomination, nor does it try to preach at us but it nonetheless sends us out of the theatre wanting to do good, to try and make the world a little [better] for someone. It manages this miracle by taking a simple plot and peopling it with characters that are memorable, flawed and likable.The cast is top class. Haley Joel Osment plays Trevor McKinney, the originator of the pay-it-forward idea. While the impact of his performance was not as great as it was in Sixth Sense, I think we can attribute that to higher expectations. Helen Hunt did make a big impression. As Trevor's Mother, Arlene, she makes Erin Brockovich look like a socialite. She is an alcoholic, single mother who works two Vegas jobs to pay the rent. In her spare time she makes and breaks promises to her son and occasionally allows her ""Ex"" back into the house, for a little drinking and abuse.Trevor's seventh grade sociology teacher, Eugene Simonet, is played by Kevin Spacey. He is one of those  quiet, thoughtful, caring teachers that sometimes inspire their students to great heights. At the same time, he is a man who is self-conscious about a disfiguring facial burn, to the point where he has settled for a life with little social interaction at all. He has his classroom and his tidy little home and his love of learning. Mr Simonet has long ago given up the hope for a lager life because hope grows more and more painful the longer it goes unrealized.On the first day of school, Mr Simonet sets his class an extra-credit assignment for the year. They must, ""Think of an idea to change our world - and put it into action!"" Trevor takes this challenge to heart and develops an idea, which he soon tries to put into action. He plans to help three people. It must be something big, that they could not do for themselves. Those three are then encouraged to pay it forward by helping three other people, instead of trying to return the favor. In this way, Trevor hopes that the idea, and its good acts, will spread and grow. Sadly, he fails to successfully help even one person, despite pouring every effort into the project. But what he doesn't know is that he has helped more than it seems, and his idea is more infectious than he could have hoped.We get to explore the cascade effects of pay-it-forward through the eyes of a freelance reporter, Chris  Chandler, played with casual enthusiasm by Jay Mohr. At the start of the film we witness him receiving his helping hand and its pay-it-forward injunction. His interest stimulated, Chris sets off to track down the source of the movement. As he backtracks the trail, we switch back and forward in time, following Trevor as he tries to make his idea fly, all the time knowing, through Chris, that it must succeed.This is a powerful story. The idea itself is wonderful but as a film, it rides on the fact that all of the major characters go through significant personal changes. In a way, Trevor is a modern day messiah. Where he goes, people repent and recover the best parts of themselves. He is not a grandiose figure, just a young boy who has a lot of faith, passion and persistence. We can all learn a lot from this film and remember, if it does affect you deeply, pay it forward.",4,"Do yourself a favour, watch this film.",995068800,"07 14, 2001",2001,3938,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'are', 'jaded', 'life', 'just', 'naturally', 'cynical', 'seem', 'dismiss', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'contrived', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'emotional', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'not', 'make', 'corny', 'am', 'not', 'suggesting', 'have', 'open', 'heart', 'close', 'mind', 'enjoy', 'film', 'need', 'do', 'not', 'close', 'off', 'soul', 'Mimi', 'Leder', 'film', 'enough', 'soul', 'own', 'recognize.Based', 'book', 'Catherine', 'Ryan', 'Hyde', 'was', 'unpublished', 'when', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'now', 'become', 'worldwide', 'movement', 'seeing', 'film', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'story', 'hint', 'religious', 'denomination', 'try', 'preach', 'nonetheless', 'theatre', 'wanting', 'do', 'good', 'try', 'make', 'world', 'little', '[', 'better', ']', 'someone', 'miracle', 'taking', 'simple', 'plot', 'peopling', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'flawed', 'likable.The', 'cast', 'top', 'class', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Trevor', 'McKinney', 'originator', 'pay-it-forward', 'idea', 'impact', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'think', 'can', 'attribute', 'higher', 'expectations', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'did', 'make', 'big', 'impression', 'Trevor', 'Mother', 'Arlene', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'look', 'socialite', 'alcoholic', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'two', 'Vegas', 'jobs', 'pay', 'rent', 'spare', 'time', 'breaks', 'promises', 'son', 'occasionally', 'Ex', 'back', 'house', 'little', 'drinking', 'abuse.Trevor', 'seventh', 'grade', 'sociology', 'teacher', 'Eugene', 'Simonet', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'one', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'caring', 'teachers', 'sometimes', 'inspire', 'students', 'great', 'heights', 'same', 'time', 'man', 'who', 'self-conscious', 'disfiguring', 'facial', 'burn', 'point', 'where', 'settled', 'life', 'little', 'social', 'interaction', 'classroom', 'tidy', 'little', 'home', 'love', 'learning', 'Mr', 'Simonet', 'long', 'ago', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'lager', 'life', 'hope', 'more', 'more', 'painful', 'longer', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'Mr', 'Simonet', 'class', 'extra-credit', 'assignment', 'year', 'must', 'Think', 'idea', 'change', 'world', 'put', 'action', 'Trevor', 'challenge', 'heart', 'idea', 'soon', 'put', 'action', 'help', 'three', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'big', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'three', 'are', 'then', 'encouraged', 'pay', 'forward', 'helping', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'instead', 'trying', 'return', 'favor', 'way', 'Trevor', 'idea', 'good', 'acts', 'will', 'spread', 'grow', 'Sadly', 'successfully', 'help', 'even', 'one', 'person', 'pouring', 'effort', 'project', 'what', ""n't"", 'know', 'helped', 'more', 'idea', 'more', 'infectious', 'could', 'have', 'hoped.We', 'get', 'explore', 'cascade', 'effects', 'pay-it-forward', 'eyes', 'freelance', 'reporter', 'Chris', 'Chandler', 'played', 'casual', 'enthusiasm', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'start', 'film', 'witness', 'receiving', 'helping', 'hand', 'pay-it-forward', 'injunction', 'interest', 'stimulated', 'Chris', 'track', 'down', 'source', 'movement', 'trail', 'switch', 'back', 'forward', 'time', 'following', 'Trevor', 'make', 'idea', 'fly', 'time', 'knowing', 'Chris', 'must', 'succeed.This', 'powerful', 'story', 'idea', 'wonderful', 'film', 'fact', 'major', 'characters', 'go', 'significant', 'personal', 'changes', 'way', 'Trevor', 'modern', 'day', 'messiah', 'Where', 'people', 'repent', 'recover', 'best', 'parts', 'not', 'grandiose', 'figure', 'just', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'lot', 'faith', 'passion', 'persistence', 'can', 'learn', 'lot', 'film', 'remember', 'affect', 'deeply', 'pay', 'forward']",N/A
577773,AHYPS5FZPVSEW,B00005ALS1,"Azra Mandzuka ""amanh""","[2, 4]","With a superior cast - Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osment, and Jim Caviezel - and a unique story with good plot, it is very unfortunate this film was so underrated. I remember when it came out in theatres and it just seemed to fizzle out of existence. I myself never had the chance to see it in the theatre but rather rented it a few years ago one boring Sunday afternoon and I tell you, I am glad I saw it. It was just brilliant.Helen Hunt plays a single mother who lives with her son (Haley Joel Osment) in Las Vegas, Nevada. She is separated from her sons's father, (Jon Bon Jovi - in a suprisingly good performance)a lush and wife-beater who one day up and left them. Hunt works two jobs to make ends meet and tries to raise her son as best as she can despite her alcoholism.The story begins with Osment's first day of sixth grade.  His first class is social studies and the teacher is none other than Kevin Spacey - with a distorted right side to his face. You immediately wonder what happened to him and what the significance of it is. You will, of course, learn that later in the movie. Osment's social studies teacher is rather extraordinary in that he actually talks to and treats his students like young adults and not just kids. He takes his job seriously and expects the same from his class. He challenges them to an extra-credit assignment by using ""the realm of possibility that exists in your mind"" and make it reality. Osment rises to the challenge by coming up with a concept of paying good deeds forward to others instead of back to their originators. He actually applies it and puts it into action. What he does and the consequences of each action produce a domino-like affect.The movie opens up with characters unrelated to Hunt, Spacey, and Osment but you must give it a chance to realize the connection. Just keep watching and don't give up; I almost wanted to, but just then it all begins to come together.I won't go into any further detail of this movie. Besides, I am sure that by now you have read other reviews of this movie and have a general idea of what it's all about. Some reviewers have given away too much, I think, and it just spoils the whole thing. But you just must watch it. You have to see for yourself the transitions each character (major and minor) goes through.You will enjoy.By the way, without even knowing it, this is the first movie I saw with a semi-unknown actor by the name of James Caviezel. He plays the role of Jesus in Mel Gibsons's ""Passion of the Christ.""  I was so surprised and astonished to learn that Caviezel is the homeless guy in this movie that Osment's character brings home as his first deed of paying it forward. Despite Caviezel's dirty and grubby appearance in this film, I still thought he was good-looking. And boy am I right! Jim Caviezel is a fine specimen of a man - and quite an actor, too. I have since seen all of his films and am impressed.Anyway, this is a brilliant film with a brilliant message. Imagine the possibility: if we all pay it forward. Just imagine.

It seems like it may be based on a true story, and I have indeed heard the expression ""pay it forward"" for some time now. It would be beautiful to think there was a real little boy who was represented by Trevor (Haley Joel Osment). He's a genuinely likable kid.Trevor lives in Los Vegas with his mother, a stacked blonde of no great education or intellect who works two jobs, one as a change-maker in a gambling parlor and one as a cocktail waitress in something (presumably a casino) very tourist-ridden. Clearly, her good looks have gotten her both jobs, but she's doing the best she can for her son. They have a relatively middle-class house that probably hasn't been cleaned in a long time, and Mama has a drinking problem. So does Papa, when he shows up, and Grandma. Never found out anything about Grandpa.Trevor's first day in middle school (he's 11), his social science teacher is something of a shocker. His face and neck are all scarred from what are evidently burns. But he's smart and he's a good teacher, and the kids get used to him. He sets them an assignment to figure out something they can do to make the world a better place, and take action. He says this assignment is for the entire school year.Trevor is the only one with a seriously good idea. He decides he's going to help three people, do something ""really big"" that they cannot do for themselves, and then rather than ask them to pay it back, tell them to pay it forward: help three other people and tell them to pay it forward, etc. The point being these good deeds would multiply quickly.From Trevor's point of view, it mostly doesn't seem to be working very well, but there's a reporter on the story for an odd reason. He was at a crime scene and the getaway car (SUV, really) was rammed right into his Mustang, completely trashing it. A gentleman with an exotic breed of dog on a leash comes out of the pouring rain and asks if he's having car trouble. When the reporter acknowledges that he is, the stranger gives him the keys to a luxury sports car. Tells him to pay it forward.Of course, a reporter can't just drop a story like this, and so he digs. I'll let you follow the path of the digging so as not to ruin the surprises involved.Back at Trevor's house, he moves along looking for things he can do to help people, and finding his expected results don't pan out too well. But when we see the people he has helped as they move on, we find he has started a wave of benevolence that may indeed circle the globe.It's a very inspiring movie. So next time somebody does something to help you.

This film is false, manipulative garbage, and the group of genuinely talented people who made it should be ashamed of themselves.Haley Joel Osment, who plays all his roles so seriously that it's almost impossible to imagine what he'd be like alongside regular 11-year-olds when he's not ""perfecting his craft,"" stars here as Trevor, a warm-hearted little boy who tries to make the world a better place. Sob. He takes in a homeless man, only to see the homeless man go back on drugs. Sniffle-sniffle. His bleach-blonde, alcoholic mom Helen Hunt is hiding bottles of liquor around the house. (Hunt, by the way, played more convincing drug addicts in her Afterschool Specials. At one point, she takes a swig and acts all drunk before she even has time to swallow.) Boohoo. His dad, Jon Bon Jovi, has left him. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. And his teacher, Kevin Spacey, has a horribly burned face and is cynical. OK, hand me a tissue.Spacey and Hunt, two Oscar winners, do no such caliber work here, where Mimi Leder's leaden direction or the just-plain-awful script don't help them out much.

Angie Dickinson crawls herself out of the grave to play Helen Hunt's mother in a creepy cameo.Someone above described the movie as ""warm-hearted.""

The star clearly is Haley Joel Osment who we all loved in 'Sixth Sense' with Bruce Willis.  He is still the lovable precocious child who can manipulate the adults to do as he wants and think it was their idea in the first place.  Trevor has an unhappy childhood with an absent dad and an uneducated waitress mother played by Helen Hunt, a marvelous actress.  His 7th grade teacher, the highly intelligent Kevin Spacey thinks he is playing a game when he directs his students to be do-gooders.  Only Trevor takes him seriously.  This is the basic pyramid scheme like a chain letter.The children must do good deeds for three people, who in turn do good things for three other people.  These nine must ""pay it forward"" ad infinitum.  It was a game of ""do-good""ing which could change the world into a nicer place.  The teacher becomes Trevor's pawn in the game of chance whereby Trevor maneuvers to pair him up with his single mom.  Both adults are scarred inwardly and outwardly, and Trevor's attempts show how low-class becomes high class.This was based on the book written by Catherine Ryan Hyde, which I look forward to finding at the library.

I was not completely expecting the depressing, heavy handed, ironic mess that it is.  With the front cover of the movie, I had my doubts (which by the way depicts a level of happiness and satisfaction that you will never reach watching this).  I should have also considered that it was also a vehicle for Spacey, Hunt, and Osment, which should have said something to me.  It also had the same director as Deep Impact, which was one of the most depressing and cold money makers to come out in a while.  Well now you know what is going on here - a movie, that early on, demolishes any potential it may have had and draws an audience on Osment's cuteness, Spacey's reputation, and Hunt's ongoing winning streak that began with &quot;Good as it gets&quot;.  It was sold in the trailer as a funny, heartfelt family film and ended up being the exact opposite.  It reminds me of how &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot; (another Spacey film) was billed as a &quot;hilarious&quot; comedy and was even placed in the comedy section at the video store.  It turned out to be a twisted, dark, and massively unfunny film that only ex exec assistants might find slightly humorous.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[10, 11]","Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) is in his first day as a Las Vegas middle-schooler (7th grade) and his class is introduced to their new social studies teacher, Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey). And it's quite a stunning introduction, because Mr. Simonet has visible scars that run up his neck and onto his face. Are they burn scars?Mr. Simonet engages his class from day one by giving them an extra credit assignment that the students can do throughout the entire school year: think of a way to change the world and put it into practice. Most of the students see this as just teacher hype, but Trevor takes it literally and starts putting an idea into play; he decides to do three incredibly nice but difficult things to three separate people (strangers) and then ask them not to pay him back, but to ""Pay It Forward."" His first is to bring home a homeless man where his mother, Arlene McKinney (Helen Hunt) finds him and pretty much freaks out.The second thing Trevor does is to try and get his teacher, Mr. Simonet, into a relationship with Arlene, Trevor's mother. And as this unfolds we begin to see more of this screwed up microcosm of souls. Trevor's mom works two jobs (one waiting tables at a strip club and the other as a change girl in a casino), is battling alcoholism, and is trying not to turn Trevor into a latchkey kid.Mr. Simonet begins to fall in love with Arlene but holds back for reasons unknown. Do those scars go deeper than the surface?Trevor's third ""Pay It Forward"" attempt is to help prevent a fellow student from being beat up by the school bullies all the time. And this event will play a pivotal and surprising role in the end of the film.Can a kid really teach everyone to ""Pay It Forward""?******************************************************************************There's an unforseen quality to this film that leaks out to the audience. After watching it with some friends, there were many differing takes on it:""It's schmaltzy trash,"" one said.""At least it's trying to get a valid message across without going into triteness,"" another commented.""It's got too many religious overtones,"" someone else piped in.""It had a lot of downers,"" said someone else.""Really? I thought it was quite uplifting,"" said another.As you can see from this cross section of comments, there's a lot going on in the film and I think this speaks pretty highly of how the message of the film (i.e., helping out strangers without any expectations of remuneration) was given to the viewer. This definitely is NOT a feel-good film. There's cursing and mild nudity and drug use and alcoholism and child abuse and even (gulp!) murder. But through these not-so-appealing items the film garners much of its strength.And it's a message that really needs to be gotten across to humanity (especially around this time of the year ...which is to say, everyday).",4,Pay It Forward Is Worth Your Money ...And Time,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,2857,"['Trevor', 'McKinney', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'first', 'day', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'middle-schooler', '7th', 'grade', 'class', 'introduced', 'new', 'social', 'studies', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Simonet', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'quite', 'stunning', 'introduction', 'Mr.', 'Simonet', 'visible', 'scars', 'run', 'up', 'neck', 'face', 'Are', 'burn', 'scars', 'Mr', 'Simonet', 'class', 'day', 'one', 'giving', 'extra', 'credit', 'assignment', 'students', 'can', 'do', 'entire', 'school', 'year', 'think', 'way', 'change', 'world', 'put', 'practice', 'Most', 'students', 'see', 'just', 'teacher', 'hype', 'Trevor', 'literally', 'putting', 'idea', 'play', 'do', 'three', 'incredibly', 'nice', 'difficult', 'things', 'three', 'separate', 'people', 'strangers', 'then', 'ask', 'not', 'pay', 'back', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'first', 'bring', 'home', 'homeless', 'man', 'where', 'mother', 'Arlene', 'McKinney', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'pretty', 'much', 'freaks', 'second', 'thing', 'Trevor', 'try', 'get', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Simonet', 'relationship', 'Arlene', 'Trevor', 'mother', 'begin', 'see', 'more', 'screwed', 'microcosm', 'souls', 'Trevor', 'mom', 'two', 'jobs', 'one', 'waiting', 'tables', 'strip', 'club', 'other', 'change', 'girl', 'casino', 'battling', 'alcoholism', 'trying', 'not', 'turn', 'Trevor', 'latchkey', 'kid.Mr', 'Simonet', 'fall', 'love', 'Arlene', 'back', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'Do', 'scars', 'go', 'deeper', 'surface', 'Trevor', 'third', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'attempt', 'help', 'prevent', 'fellow', 'student', 'being', 'beat', 'up', 'school', 'time', 'event', 'will', 'play', 'pivotal', 'surprising', 'role', 'end', 'film.Can', 'kid', 'really', 'teach', 'everyone', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'unforseen', 'quality', 'film', 'out', 'audience', 'watching', 'friends', 'were', 'many', 'differing', 'schmaltzy', 'trash', 'one', 'said', 'least', 'trying', 'get', 'valid', 'message', 'going', 'triteness', 'commented', 'got', 'too', 'many', 'religious', 'overtones', 'someone', 'else', 'piped', 'had', 'lot', 'downers', 'said', 'someone', 'else.', 'Really', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'uplifting', 'said', 'can', 'see', 'cross', 'section', 'comments', 'lot', 'going', 'film', 'think', 'pretty', 'highly', 'how', 'message', 'film', 'i.e.', 'helping', 'out', 'strangers', 'expectations', 'remuneration', 'was', 'given', 'viewer', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'feel-good', 'film', 'cursing', 'mild', 'nudity', 'drug', 'use', 'alcoholism', 'child', 'abuse', 'even', 'gulp', 'murder', 'not-so-appealing', 'items', 'film', 'garners', 'much', 'strength.And', 'message', 'really', 'be', 'gotten', 'humanity', 'especially', 'time', 'year', 'say', 'everyday']",N/A

I think it's something that would truly change the world if it would only catch on. I was thrilled to see Haley Joel Osment playing such a role. He is a true &quot;wunderkind&quot; or perhaps an &quot;Indigo Child&quot; as they are often referred to today. He carries with him such an air of mystique and prophecy that I just know that his movies hold valuable messages for all of us. It surprises me that other reviewers couldn't focus long enough to realize that the sub-plots were all intended to connect via the &quot;pay it forward&quot; context, as we realize that Trevor's homework assignment has influenced people, events and places far beyond his own awareness. Yes, Helen Hunt looks like a witch, but she's playing an alcoholic -- they're rarely pretty, but often good-hearted. She's also a battered woman, and a brutally honest confrontation with Trevor's teacher forces her to question her self-destructive loyalty to the father of her son -- a loud and clear message to women who may be putting their children at risk by paying too much respect to fathers who don't deserve it. Even Trevor himself dreads his father's return, and father's rights advocates could benefit from the realization that sometimes children *don't* need fathers who hurt them and/or their mothers.Paying it forward is about taking risks for others, risks that are hard, challenging, and scary. Trevor himself honors the courage it took his mother to forgive her mother for the childhood that caused her such pain. It takes courage -- and that is why the end is as powerful as it is. I won't spoil it, but I want to say that it was a statement that underscored the kind of courage it takes to change the world.I wasn't too crazy about the final scenes, they were anti-climactic and stretched the point.

He's constantly taking care of himself while his single mother (Helen Hunt, pitch perfect) works job after job and he's continually having to battle her with her alcohol problem, she hides bottles and he finds and drains them.  This story of mother-son relationship is the heart of 'Pay it Forward', the actual paying it forward (a school project Trevor comes up with) is in many ways the sub-plot here, not the other way around.  You see, Trevor is a bright young boy (about 11 or so) whose new teacher (Kevin Spacey, always brilliant) gives them a 'beginning of the year' assignment to come up with a way to change the world, for the better.  He doesn't feel any of the kids will actually come up with anything substantial, but then again he's never had a student quite like Trevor.  Trevor comes up with a plan, a utopian idea (now look that up :P) where one person will do something good for 3 people who in turn will do something good for 3 more people, never the same people, always someone different, and the idea, as rediculous as it may sound actually worked for word of it got out and reached a struggling news reporter (Jay Mohr) who decides to do a story on Trevor and his idea.  Like I said, all of this is nothing more than a sub-plot.  The heart and soul of this story is the bond that forms between these 3 unlikely souls.  A mother whose always trying so hard to do the right thing but for the life of her can't make the right choices.  A teacher who is afraid to change for fear of hurting anymore than he already does and a boy caught in the middle with a heart of gold.  That is your story and what a touching and moving story it is.  Helen Hunt is on top of her game in this beautiful story of learning to love, and Kevin Spacey, always brilliant, is convincing and heart breaking in his sicerity.  Young Haley Joel Osment is a brilliant young actor and I'm sure, with the promise he showed in movies like this one, A.I. and his oscar nominated performance in the Sixth Sense, that he will come back guns blazing once he's through with the awkward stages of those teenage years!

In spite of his own self-perceived failures, he inadvertently starts a movement that begins sweeping across the nation, changing lives one at a time.This movie has many unexpected twists and turns as the life story of many people begin to unravel in explanation of the secrets each pocesses. Incredible performance by a bright young actor in a very well written story. Assisted by co-stars Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt, both of whom portray their characters in their usual professional manner, the story comes to life in a way that is certain to touch the heart of every viewer. A very thought provoking movie which this reviewer finds quite refreshing and unique. There are a few things I would like to have seen a bit different, such as perhaps a little less use of profanity, but for the most part I give this movie a big two thumbs up. Sometimes I think we forget that not everyone's life is the life of a status-quo normal person in search of the great American dream. This film, unlike others does not glamourize drugs, alcoholism, crime and violence. It merely exposes it in a manner that reminds the viewer that such a way of life exists in today's world for a lot of people who have found themselves in situations that went a little further over the edge than they intended to go, and need a helping hand to turn things around.

577806,A1ZU731IFILMV4,B00005ALS1,"Demonic Kelvin ""Dark""","[5, 6]","This movie is excellent. It contains an extreme wonderful story line.Basically, this movie is about a little boy, Trevor McKinney(Haley Joel Osment)who lives in a single-parent family. His father is a jerk and had went off(drunk and always beats his wife) and his mother (Helen Hunt)is an alcholic. Trevor's mother didn't really paying much attention on him because she had to work two jobs a day to support the family and Trevor dislike her for she always drinks. So, the world just seems like a big dissapointment for the young Trevor who is just 11 years old. When his seventh grade social studies teacher, Eugene Simonet(Kevin Spacey) gave him an assignment entitled ""Look at the world around you and fix what you don't like -put it into ACTION"", he figured out an idea, a really EXQUISITE one, known as 'Pay It Forward'(the title).This idea works in the way where he will do 3 great favors to 3 needy people but he didn't want a payback, he wanted them to pay it forward to 3 other people each. It will sums up to 9 people and they will continue to pay it forward to the others. His 3 deeds are towards a total stranger, his mother(Arlene) and his teacher(Eugene Simonet) and his classmate who often got bullied. At first, all his deeds seem to be a failure but actually they are working. His hope then came true and he got an interview from a news reporter who had been searching the source of the pay it forward idea. At last, he's brave enough to save his friend from the bullies. VERY UNFORTUNATELY, he got stabbed with knife by one of the bullies and DIED(the saddest scene). Countless of people came to show their appreciation and gratefulness of his noble and hard efforts after his death being reported in the news.Well, although this movie has some script errors(an 11 years old kid not supposed to be in the seventh grade) but it brings out the message of 'Nothing is impossible if we try' and 'A noble effort could actually change the cynical world'. Besides, this movie overall is delightfully touching(especially the scene where Trevor died). I can say nothing much about how touching it is because I CRIED everytime I watch this movie. This proves how good is the movie and my heart certainly got moved by it. It's ending is unexpectable and it is very sad.I am upmost delighted by the extreme performence by the great actors such as Spacey, Helen and especially the young Haley Joel Osment.Well, I have to say that Haley is very special and talented in acting just like in his other movies(The Sixth Sense, Artificial Intelligence). He's amazing despite of his young age. Their wonderful performence capture my entire attention while watching this movie.This movie by Mimi Leder is indeed an outstanding masterpiece and I hardly praised it with any words.

Helen Hunt play the mother of ""The Sixth Sense's"" Haley Joel Osment.The characters in this picture are amazingly baggage laden. Hunt's character, Arlene McKinney, is an alcoholic, who repeatedly lets her son Trevor's alcoholic father come back to their home. Spacey's character, Mr. Eugene Simonet, is heavily scared both mentally and physically from a less-than-ordinary childhood.Mr. Simonet, assigns quite the idealistic project when he asks his kids on their first day of the seventh grade, for extra credit of course, to come up with an idea to change the world. Trevor takes this assignment to heart and comes up with the idea of ""paying it forward."" Simply stated, you do something for a person, something that they themselves are incapable of doing but instead of paying that person back for the favor, you pay the favor forward to three people. Trevor decides to do three favors for three people. . . and the story goes on from there.This movie is a profound piece of work. The cast is phenomenal.

While 'Pay It Forward' is a great social concept, the movie takes a very cynical approach to the world, thus creating depressing scene, after depressing scene, interspliced with optimism. Haley Joel Osment was an expert at these type of roles, where he basically was the shining light in all these dark depressing movies in 1999, 2000, and 2001, and he alone makes you care about the movie. Kevin Spacey also puts up a fine performance, but again, his character seems to be wrapped up in all this depression. Helen Hunt's character on the other hand seems to be the cause of most of this depression.What makes this movie so depressing?

577823,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005ALS1,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 3]","""Pay It Forward"" is not a great film, but at least it has a good heart.  I have been very critical of the film industry for it's irresponsible attitude towards filmmaking.  Films like ""Fight Club"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" that glorify anarchy and mayhem send the wrong message to society.  Other films like ""Scary Movie"" and ""Road Trip"" rely on humor that is so degrading that it lowers the general standard of societal norms by dulling our sense of revulsion at crass behavior.  ""Pay It Forward"" sends a positive message to the masses and despite its unexceptional screenplay, I am gratified to see the effort.The story centers on Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment), a schoolboy who takes quite literally his teacher's challenge to change the world.  He decides to do three favors for people and tells them that instead of paying the favor back, that they should pay it forward; they should do three favors for others.  The concept is wonderfully idealistic and it is the kind of message we should be sending to society, rather than the hedonistic and nihilistic themes that pervade cinema today.The screenplay itself meanders about without the discipline to stay on point.  A good portion of the film is wasted on the romantic relationship developing between Trevor's mother (Helen Hunt) and his teacher (Kevin Spacey), which is a complete non sequitur.  From a marketing perspective, I can understand the necessity of giving the audience a good bit of screen time with box office magnets rather than building the story on Osment and the main theme.  However, only giving a few examples of how the favors were paid forward dilutes the true impact of that theme.  A more effective way to structure the film would have been through a succession of vignettes that travel around the country and perhaps return to Trevor.The ending failed to deliver the message intended.  While I surmise that the writer intended that the ending convey the power and impact of goodness and kindness, ironically it sends the message that no good deed goes unpunished, slipping once again into the nihilistic realm of ""why bother?""The acting is consistently good.  Kevin Spacey is an enormously talented actor and once again creates a compelling and complex character with extensive range.  Helen Hunt is really miscast as the middle class mom.  She comes across as so bright that it is hard to dumb her down enough to seem normal.  Moreover, the romance between the two had all the chemistry of a PTA meeting.  Haley Joel Osment is proving himself to be quite a talent after a riveting performance in ""The Sixth Sense"".  Once again he plays a difficult part with ease.Despite structural flaws, I rated this film a 7/10 on the strength of the message.  I would recommend it to anyone who has not given up hope that the world could be better.",4,A film with its heart in the right place,995241600,"07 16, 2001",2001,2815,"['Pay', 'Forward', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'least', 'good', 'heart', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'critical', 'film', 'industry', 'irresponsible', 'attitude', 'towards', 'filmmaking', 'Films', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'glorify', 'anarchy', 'mayhem', 'send', 'wrong', 'message', 'society', 'Other', 'films', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'Road', 'Trip', 'rely', 'humor', 'so', 'degrading', 'general', 'standard', 'societal', 'norms', 'dulling', 'sense', 'revulsion', 'crass', 'behavior', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'positive', 'message', 'masses', 'unexceptional', 'screenplay', 'am', 'gratified', 'see', 'effort.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Trevor', 'McKinney', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'quite', 'literally', 'teacher', 'challenge', 'change', 'world', 'do', 'three', 'favors', 'people', 'instead', 'paying', 'favor', 'back', 'should', 'pay', 'forward', 'should', 'do', 'three', 'favors', 'others', 'concept', 'wonderfully', 'idealistic', 'kind', 'message', 'should', 'be', 'sending', 'society', 'rather', 'hedonistic', 'nihilistic', 'themes', 'pervade', 'cinema', 'today.The', 'screenplay', 'meanders', 'discipline', 'stay', 'point', 'good', 'portion', 'film', 'wasted', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'developing', 'Trevor', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'teacher', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'complete', 'non', 'sequitur', 'marketing', 'perspective', 'can', 'understand', 'necessity', 'giving', 'audience', 'good', 'bit', 'screen', 'time', 'box', 'office', 'magnets', 'rather', 'building', 'story', 'Osment', 'main', 'theme', 'However', 'only', 'giving', 'few', 'examples', 'how', 'favors', 'were', 'paid', 'forward', 'true', 'impact', 'theme', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'structure', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'succession', 'vignettes', 'travel', 'country', 'perhaps', 'return', 'Trevor.The', 'ending', 'failed', 'deliver', 'message', 'intended', 'surmise', 'writer', 'intended', 'ending', 'convey', 'power', 'impact', 'goodness', 'kindness', 'ironically', 'message', 'good', 'deed', 'unpunished', 'slipping', 'once', 'again', 'nihilistic', 'realm', 'why', 'bother', 'acting', 'consistently', 'good', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'enormously', 'talented', 'actor', 'once', 'again', 'compelling', 'complex', 'character', 'extensive', 'range', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'really', 'miscast', 'middle', 'class', 'mom', 'across', 'so', 'bright', 'hard', 'dumb', 'down', 'enough', 'seem', 'normal', 'Moreover', 'romance', 'two', 'had', 'chemistry', 'PTA', 'meeting', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'proving', 'be', 'quite', 'talent', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Once', 'again', 'difficult', 'part', 'ease.Despite', 'structural', 'flaws', 'rated', 'film', '7/10', 'strength', 'message', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'better']",N/A

577829,A1Y8IUMN7TBKS,B00005ALS1,Groovy Vegan,"[0, 0]","I consider ""Pay it Forward"" to be a must-see movie for adults and teens.  As pointed out by many reviewers, it's brilliantly acted by Kevin Spacey (Mr. Simonet - cranky social studies teacher with personal issues and a heart of gold), Helen Hunt - (Alcoholic single mom with two jobs struggling to support her 7th-grader son, Trevor), Haley Joel Osment - (7th grader who comes up with the ""Pay it Forward"" idea to improve the world, one favor at a time and works hard to impliment it), and the supporting cast including Angie Dickenson, Jon Bon Jovi, and James Caviezel.But the movie has far more than mere entertainment value.  Unlike most other movies, it doesn't just entertain, but makes you think.  And more importantly, has gone beyond that and inspired people to take action to begin doing everything from random acts of kindness to major ""Pay it Forward"" life saving/life changing favors for others.The plot has been well summarized in other reviews, so I won't repeat that here.  Some reviewers are troubled by the bleakness portrayed which includes  alcoholism, drug addiction, bullying, violence, and homelessness.  My take on this is, that rather than taking place in the idyllic setting of a Walgreen's Christmas commercial, the movie portrays the far less than perfect real world.  Indeed Trevor's ""Pay it Forward"" idea came straight out of his troubled life in the lower middle class and while it seemed to quickly peter out, mushroomed to people in all walks of life from the homeless to the ultra wealthy.  Unlike the year 2000 when the movie took place, today's world is on the brink of another Great Depression.  While your life might not include addiction and violence, in today's world it's even more important to help others.Others are unhappy about a disturbing plot twist and believe it detracts from the movie.  IMO, this actually add to the movie, but arguing that point would require me posting some spoilers.  Let's just say that in the real world, one must be discerning of how one helps others.  Sometimes one may have to call 911 rather than personally intervene.  Do what you can to help others as you never know how much time you've got.Another reviewer doesn't like that the plot jumps around a bit.  I enjoyed watching seemingly unrelated ""Pay It Forward"" favors, but without knowing how the characters tied together until later.  It made the movie into more of an entertaining mystery, and placed the emphasis where it should be--on the helping other people, rather than the chronology of where each person was in the helping chain.The bottom line is, this is a must see/must discuss movie for everyone teenage and older.

Even a fantastic actor like Kevin Spacey couldn't breathe any reality into words which just lacked real feeling and sincerity.  Nonetheless, Spacey gives a fine albeit occasionally overacted performance.Plus I felt like the writing, save for the 1st half hour, was pretty lame.  The first half hour is incredibly intelligent and engaging.And is it just me or does Jay Mohr seem to be particularly irritating in every role he plays or what?Helen Hunt was quite impressive both in her performance and her appearance.

I thought it would be corny, clunky trash (which it is very briefly in a couple of scenes) but it was mostly a very good cinematic experience, not quite a masterpiece that the cast might of come up with, but Pay It Forward is still a perfectly watchable drama.Young Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment), troubled by his mother's (Helen Hunt) alcoholism and fears of his abusive but absent father, is caught up by an intriguing assignment from his new social studies teacher, Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey). The assignment: think of something to change the world and put it into action. Trevor conjures the notion of paying a favour not back, but forward--repaying good deeds not with payback, but with new good deeds done to three new people. Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself, his mother and his physically and emotionally scarred teacher, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him.The film starts awkwardly, but in the middle, it becomes absorbing and intriguing as Trevor's idea thrusts itself through the plot, and in the end, your left reaching for a million hankies at the same time. An all-star cast deliver stunning performances, Spacey's turn as the loveable but burned teacher is stunning, his performance burns in memory, just as his character's scars burn on his face. Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment are both perfectly cast as two troubled family members going through a rough patch, and I really liked the way the script started with the present, went back to the past and then strang itself together nicely. Also, the music, which I could never forget, done by Thomas Newman (American Beauty) is stunning, and earns Pay It Forward points and puts it as one of the front-runner's for top music of the year.The mournful look on Osment's face sometimes tires, and about 15 minutes could've been cut off the running time, but none-the-less, this is still a brutal, honest, real and emotionally moving piece of film, well worth your time.",4,Surprisingly moving.,984787200,"03 17, 2001",2001,2096,"['Pay', 'ForwardScore', '74/100Oh', 'how', 'film', 'surprised', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'corny', 'clunky', 'trash', 'very', 'briefly', 'couple', 'scenes', 'was', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'not', 'quite', 'masterpiece', 'cast', 'might', 'come', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'still', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'drama.Young', 'Trevor', 'McKinney', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'troubled', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'alcoholism', 'fears', 'abusive', 'absent', 'father', 'caught', 'up', 'intriguing', 'assignment', 'new', 'social', 'studies', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Simonet', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'assignment', 'think', 'something', 'change', 'world', 'put', 'action', 'Trevor', 'notion', 'paying', 'favour', 'not', 'back', 'forward', 'repaying', 'good', 'deeds', 'not', 'payback', 'new', 'good', 'deeds', 'done', 'three', 'new', 'people', 'Trevor', 'efforts', 'make', 'good', 'idea', 'bring', 'revolution', 'not', 'only', 'lives', 'mother', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'teacher', 'ever-widening', 'circle', 'people', 'completely', 'unknown', 'him.The', 'film', 'starts', 'awkwardly', 'middle', 'absorbing', 'intriguing', 'Trevor', 'idea', 'plot', 'end', 'left', 'reaching', 'million', 'hankies', 'same', 'time', 'all-star', 'cast', 'deliver', 'stunning', 'performances', 'Spacey', 'turn', 'loveable', 'burned', 'teacher', 'stunning', 'performance', 'burns', 'memory', 'just', 'character', 'scars', 'burn', 'face', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'two', 'troubled', 'family', 'members', 'going', 'rough', 'patch', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'script', 'started', 'present', 'went', 'back', 'past', 'then', 'strang', 'together', 'nicely', 'Also', 'music', 'could', 'never', 'forget', 'done', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'American', 'Beauty', 'stunning', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'points', 'one', 'front-runner', 'top', 'music', 'year.The', 'mournful', 'look', 'Osment', 'face', 'sometimes', '15', 'minutes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cut', 'off', 'running', 'time', 'none-the-less', 'still', 'brutal', 'honest', 'real', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'piece', 'film', 'well', 'time']",N/A

So rarely do we see a movie that will tug at our heart strings and make us want to do something with humanity- ""Pay it Forward"" does just that. Thank God we lucked out and Hollywood gave us ""Pay It Forward."" After watching it I found myself questioning the person I had become and the person I wanted to be.In this movie it starts out when a teacher(Spacey) gives an assignment to his students ""How will you change the world,"" the best concept comes from Hayley Joel Osment who comes up with the ""Pay it forward"" method do 3 acts of kindness for people and then instead of them paying YOU back they do 3 acts of kindness for 3 other people thus, creating a continual circle of kindness. It's a brillant concept and believe or not the people he chooses to help actually continue the chain. Osment helps his mother and teacher find love, helps a hobo, and his friend who never sticks up for himself. Before Osment knows it ""pay it forward"" has gone across the nation and a reporter has been searching for him throughout the movie. Never had, I seen such a movie with such a clear purpose of trying to make the auidience look deep within themselves to see if they could do any good with the world.

Where Eugene Simonet(Kevin Spacey) a slightly disfigured teacher is speaking to his students about a project to change the world. They all find the enormity of the project overwhelming. Although for one of his students, Trevor McKinney(Haley Joel Osmet), who comes up with the idea that he can help 3 people, who will hence help out 3 other people, and so the chain begins. When Arlene(Helen Hunt) Trevor's mom gets wind of where his idea came from when it starts affecting her home life, she has it out with his teacher. Arlene and Eugene soon begin seeing much more of each other.While the concept behind the film is excellent, it's execution on film often comes across a bit dry and stale. There are wonderful touching and charming moments all throughout the film, and like I said in the title, the concept is grand and well worth thought, if we could only find a way to make it real. Even though there are wonderful and charming moments wrought throughout the film, there are times when it feels so dry and stagnant, not to the fault of Hunt, Spacey, or Osmet.The film's real saving grace comes in its finale.

577867,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005ALS1,Lawyeraau,"[100, 110]","I found this movie to be a compelling and moving cinematic experience, with outstanding, well nuanced performances by Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment, and James Caviezel. It is a bona fide tearjerker. Those who enjoy that genre of film should love this one.The movie opens up with a hostage scene being played out in a residential neighborhood, with cops everywhere. A reporter arrives on the scene only to have the cops try and give him the bum's rush. While the cops are distracted by the reporter, the perpetrator leaves the scene in a sports utitlty vehicle, but not before crashing into and totalling the reporter's car. A mysterious stranger materializes and hands the reporter the keys to a new jaguar, saying that he is giving it to him, no strings attached, since he seems to have run into a little car trouble.The movie then cuts to a scene four months earlier. The viewer is taken to a seventh grade class room where, in a wonderful scene, student, Trevor McKinney, played by Haley Joel Osment, takes his teacher's assignment of doing something that could potentially change the world to heart. His teacher, an intelligent and controlled man, played by Kevin Spacey, whose burn scarred face masks the scars on his heart, gives out this assignment cavalierly, not really expecting that any of his students will come up with something of real note.It turns out that Trevor, intelligent and introspective, comes up with an idea whereby he performs a potentially life changing good deed for each of three people. They in turn each do the same for three people. He calls his idea &quot;pay it forward&quot;.  It is your basic pyramid scheme with a twist. Some of the things he does will tug at your heart strings. Some of them will tickle your funny bone. One thing is for sure, unless you are made of stone, you will be moved.Meanwhile Trevor's stressed out mom, played by Helen Hunt, is a single parent, holding down two jobs. An alcoholic in the throes of a recovery, she does the best that she can. Split from Trevor's dad, himself an alcoholic who used to batter her, she is struggling to keep on even keel. When Trevor's execution of his teacher's assignment results in what appears to be a potentially life threatening situation, it causes his mom to hit the roof and go to the school, where she confronts the baffled teacher.Ultimately, Trevor's mom and his teacher are brought together, through the contrivance of Trevor. What initially seemed impossible, becomes a reality, and a relationship blossoms. It turns out that they have more in common than was initially thought. Meanwhile, Trevor's plan is catching on, and a number of wonderful scenes in the film illustrate this.What happens in this film will, at times, thrill and delight you. At other times, what happens will surely move you to tears. Some may call the movie manipulative and schmaltzy. It is simply just an old fashioned tearjerker.",5,FIVE HANKY TEARJERKER...,993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,2928,"['found', 'movie', 'be', 'compelling', 'moving', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'outstanding', 'well', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'bona', 'fide', 'tearjerker', 'who', 'enjoy', 'genre', 'film', 'should', 'love', 'one.The', 'movie', 'up', 'hostage', 'scene', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'residential', 'neighborhood', 'cops', 'everywhere', 'reporter', 'scene', 'only', 'have', 'cops', 'try', 'give', 'bum', 'rush', 'cops', 'are', 'distracted', 'reporter', 'perpetrator', 'scene', 'sports', 'utitlty', 'vehicle', 'not', 'crashing', 'totalling', 'reporter', 'car', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'materializes', 'reporter', 'keys', 'new', 'jaguar', 'saying', 'giving', 'strings', 'attached', 'have', 'run', 'little', 'car', 'trouble.The', 'movie', 'then', 'scene', 'four', 'months', 'earlier', 'viewer', 'taken', 'seventh', 'grade', 'class', 'room', 'where', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'student', 'Trevor', 'McKinney', 'played', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'teacher', 'assignment', 'doing', 'something', 'could', 'potentially', 'change', 'world', 'heart', 'teacher', 'intelligent', 'controlled', 'man', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'burn', 'scarred', 'face', 'masks', 'scars', 'heart', 'out', 'assignment', 'cavalierly', 'not', 'really', 'expecting', 'students', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'real', 'note.It', 'out', 'Trevor', 'intelligent', 'introspective', 'up', 'idea', 'whereby', 'potentially', 'life', 'changing', 'good', 'deed', 'three', 'people', 'turn', 'do', 'same', 'three', 'people', 'idea', 'quot', 'pay', 'forward', 'quot', 'basic', 'pyramid', 'scheme', 'twist', 'things', 'will', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'will', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'are', 'made', 'stone', 'will', 'be', 'moved.Meanwhile', 'Trevor', 'stressed', 'out', 'mom', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'single', 'parent', 'holding', 'down', 'two', 'jobs', 'alcoholic', 'throes', 'recovery', 'best', 'can', 'Split', 'Trevor', 'dad', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'used', 'batter', 'struggling', 'keep', 'even', 'keel', 'When', 'Trevor', 'execution', 'teacher', 'assignment', 'results', 'what', 'be', 'potentially', 'life', 'threatening', 'situation', 'mom', 'hit', 'roof', 'go', 'school', 'where', 'baffled', 'teacher.Ultimately', 'Trevor', 'mom', 'teacher', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'contrivance', 'Trevor', 'What', 'initially', 'seemed', 'impossible', 'reality', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'out', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'was', 'initially', 'thought', 'Meanwhile', 'Trevor', 'plan', 'catching', 'number', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'film', 'illustrate', 'film', 'will', 'times', 'thrill', 'delight', 'other', 'times', 'what', 'will', 'surely', 'move', 'tears', 'may', 'call', 'movie', 'manipulative', 'schmaltzy', 'simply', 'just', 'old', 'fashioned', 'tearjerker']",N/A

There are certainly flaws in this movie, but overall the impact of the simple story of a group of people whose lives have all been broken in some way carries you over the errors in filming.This is a story that relies on flashbacks to connect the seemingly unrelated &quot;good Samaritan&quot; who helps a reporter (Jay Mohr) to an adolescent in Las Vegas, who has innocently but purposefully started this tale of giving, the acts of &quot;Paying it forward&quot; that propel the tale.  Haley Joel Osment and Helen Hunt are believable as a casino worker and her son who are just hanging on to existence from day to day until Trevor's imagination and belief take them into a phase of their lives together that make the past disappear.  Hunt struggles a little to adopt the language, style and weariness of a single mom with few hopes and aspirations.  Osment gives a solid performance as her 12 year old son; wanting to believe in her, but finding it difficult when she can't seem to give up the bottle.Enter Spacey as the kind of teacher each of us had once in junior high....strange looking, nerdish, with charisma meaningful only to adolescents.  He helps the students see beyond the classroom and understand that it is just a bridge into the world beyond them.  His singular existence in Las Vegas, of all places, is hard to understand and his loneliness and caring position him to befriend and become an integral part of Trevor's &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; machinations.  I'm way too big a Spacey fan to review his performances...in each, it appears to me that he creates a role, and they build a screenplay around him, so real and believable are his characterizations.Unbilled in the factors that make the film so moving are the unique and appealing score and the scenic backdrop that director Leder and her cameramen have provided of the Las Vegas area.  Caught in the contrast between glitzy casinos and rundown and worn residential and transient areas is the arresting view of the deserts and mountains that surround the city.  Leder has successfully translated the strange mix of beauty and hopelessness that the city evokes to her film.It is really the only solid praise I have for Leder.  Not sure if the final scene, which was totally out of place in the movie, was due to her direction or poor screenwriting (or both), but the film deserved a very different ending; one whose simplicity evoked the theme of the movie.  Throughout the film, ways of &quot;seeing&quot; the scene and the characterizations of those who could have been important (Bon Jovi, Dickinson) were poorly woven into the central story.

It would be great if humans were noble, altruistic, and kind enough to make an idea like this work, and a few people are, but they're in the minority, a very small minority, which is of course why humans need ideas like this in the first place. Unfortunately, I don't believe that is the case. One only needs to look at the sad state of the world to understand that.

577885,A3R6XTCAE182S,B00005ALS1,"Mary J. Alderdice ""geek, book lover, craft fiend""","[1, 1]","I really enjoyed this movie for a number of reasons. First, it has a number of actors I adore. Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osment, and Helen Hunt, in order of adoration. Second, it is (in part) about a teacher who makes a difference. I'm very much into teachers who make differences movies. Finally, the &quot;pay it foward&quot; concept has always been a favorite of mine. It immediately resonated with me when I first read it in print in the works of Spider Robinson, and I was thrilled that a movie was being made revolving around this concept. (Yes, I know about the book, but I haven't read it yet. But the concept remains the same.)For those who abhor obviously, unapologetically sentimental movies, this is probably one for you to avoid. But for those who don't mind having the heartstrings tugged upon, this story has a number of promising elements.Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) is an obviously physically (and almost as obviously emotionally) scarred intermediate school teacher who forces his students to think and to observe the world around them. As a year-long project, Simonet tells his class that they much each come up with a project that will change the world. At first they disbelieve, but are soon caught up in the idea. One student, Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment), comes up with an idea that is stunning in its simplicity. How much better of a place could the world be if you did a profoundly important favor for three different people, and instead of accepting repayment, you tell the person to pay it forward, to do their own set of three profoundly important favors?This movie follows Trev's attempts at carrying out his own idea, which he does without explaining the project to his mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt). This leads to any number of stressful situations, as does Arlene's battle with alcoholism and family tensions involving Trev's father.I found the chronology of parts of the story (mostly those involving the reporter as he traces Trev) to be rather confusing, and actually watched it a second time to work it all out. The confusion probably came from my rather inattentive movie-watching style and not through any inherent flaw in the movie, however.I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and recommend it, with the caveats included above.",4,How would *you* change the world?,1022371200,"05 26, 2002",2002,2271,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'number', 'reasons', 'First', 'number', 'actors', 'adore', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'order', 'adoration', 'Second', 'part', 'teacher', 'who', 'difference', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'teachers', 'who', 'make', 'differences', 'movies', 'Finally', 'quot', 'pay', 'foward', 'quot', 'concept', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'immediately', 'resonated', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'print', 'works', 'Spider', 'Robinson', 'was', 'thrilled', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'revolving', 'concept', 'Yes', 'know', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'yet', 'concept', 'same', 'who', 'abhor', 'obviously', 'unapologetically', 'sentimental', 'movies', 'probably', 'one', 'avoid', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'heartstrings', 'tugged', 'upon', 'story', 'number', 'promising', 'elements.Eugene', 'Simonet', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'obviously', 'physically', 'almost', 'obviously', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'intermediate', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'students', 'think', 'observe', 'world', 'year-long', 'project', 'Simonet', 'class', 'much', 'come', 'up', 'project', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'first', 'disbelieve', 'are', 'soon', 'caught', 'up', 'idea', 'One', 'student', 'Trevor', 'McKinney', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'up', 'idea', 'stunning', 'simplicity', 'How', 'much', 'better', 'place', 'could', 'world', 'be', 'did', 'profoundly', 'important', 'favor', 'three', 'different', 'people', 'instead', 'accepting', 'repayment', 'tell', 'person', 'pay', 'forward', 'do', 'own', 'set', 'three', 'profoundly', 'important', 'favors', 'movie', 'Trev', 'attempts', 'carrying', 'out', 'own', 'idea', 'explaining', 'project', 'mother', 'Arlene', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'number', 'stressful', 'situations', 'Arlene', 'battle', 'alcoholism', 'family', 'tensions', 'involving', 'Trev', 'father.I', 'found', 'chronology', 'parts', 'story', 'mostly', 'involving', 'reporter', 'Trev', 'be', 'rather', 'confusing', 'actually', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'confusion', 'probably', 'came', 'rather', 'inattentive', 'movie-watching', 'style', 'not', 'inherent', 'flaw', 'movie', 'however.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'recommend', 'caveats', 'included']",N/A

PAY IT FORWARD is a scam, a heartfelt scam, detouring our opposition of the world and our selfishness, and regaurding us with a worthy responsibility and loyalness to family and strangers.  The idea is that if you do something big and extravagant (a deed almost insane -in a good way-) for three someones, anyone, then they will do something excellent for three other people as a payment, which is the concept: ""PAY IT FORWARD"", and continuing follows a string of people who are doing favors and more favors, eventually until the world is populated with generous and giving people.  It is an idea that would literally change the world, that is if the entire world followed with the scam.That's the gist of the pudding in this jello bowl film which stars HALEY JOEL OSMENT as Trevor, a seventh grade boy whose social studies assignment is to do something that will effect the entire world, resulting as a phenomenon (big or small).  The assignment is delivered by his new teacher, Eugene Simonett (KEVIN SPACEY), a severly abused, burned, and scarred man, but a good one at that his undefiant skill as a person is captivating and mysterious.  Trevor lives in a tidy home in Vegas with his alcoholic single mom (HELEN HUNT) who works at a cocktail bar and also a small cafe.  The relationship between her and Trevor never strikes up anything other than mostly depression and tiredness, considering their is no liable father, only an abusive one who comes in and out for short periods of time divided by lengthy periods of time.  After Trevor's idea takes its starting mark when he invites a homeless man, Jerry (JIM CAVIEZEL), into his house for a day to eat and sleep, his miraculous idea soars as he does something for someone, and Trevor continues to work his magic with his second choice which is where the soap suds pour on in and the sparkle seems to die out in a dark drama with drooling performances, a thick message, but no screenplay.Trevor feels his mom and Mr. Simonett will feel better if they are together, and sets them up on a date that the two don't realize they're participating in, through writing the fake notes and giving the false messages.  That's where the focal point of the film falls in the trash can and the story treads through the relationship of Trevor's mom and teacher.  Mr. Simonett likes his mom, but is ashamed of his body, and Trevor's mom wants him bad but doesn't say what she should.  Then of course, the drunk father returns, Trevor's plan falls apart, there's more depression and sadness, and we're back at square number one.Through the alcohol abuse, the hitting, the cursing and fighting, the runaways, the student bullies (more depicted as juvenile delenquints), the dying relationships, the favor-plan falling apart, and sadness of everyone, PAY IT FORWARD owes more to the audience than it can bare.  It's depicted as an uplifting drama with brilliance beyond comepare, but it is really much more emotionally violent and depressing than war films.The depression only increases when the predictability and cliche increases.  HUNT and SPACEY reunite, HALEY becomes a media phenomenon, HUNT gives up alcohol, the abusive father leaves, SPACEY finally tells the story of how he was severely burned, and then the soap suds finish their business.

577888,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005ALS1,Matthew Horner,"[4, 9]","Pay it Forward is a movie I really was looking forward to. It had a great cast, a good director and what looked to be an interesting plot. Alas, the greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment when a movie doesn't work for you. The problem is that the story, which stumbles several times, ends on a false and manipulative note. I felt used.Haley Joel Osment plays Trevor, a bright but troubled kid. He lives in Las Vegas with his mother, Arlene [Helen Hunt], an alcoholic cocktail waitress. She's a caring mother, but she's having a hard time kicking her addiction. Her husband has long since departed, and Trevor has good reason to hope he stays away. At school, Trevor has a new social studies teacher. His name is Eugene [Kevin Spacey], an excellent teacher whose face is badly scarred. His past and his disfigurement are enough to keep Eugene living in his own controlled little world. The teacher gives the class an year-long assignment. The students must come up with an idea that will change the world. Trevor decides that he will help three people and tell them they should pay the favor forward to three other people. He figures that if everyone aids three others, the world will be a better place. He starts with a drug addict [James Caviezel] whom he lets live in his garage. When Arlene finds out, she naturally throws the guy out. (Wouldn't you?) Next Trevor vows to keep his nerdish best friend from getting beaten up. Finally, he decides that Eugene is the perfect match for his Mom. His efforts continue on interestingly enough until the aforementioned climax.The cast does what it can; in fact, the three leads display an earnestness that is touching. If only the material had been worth their efforts! Joel Haley Osment affirms that his performance in The Sixth Sense was no fluke. If he is this good at age twelve, will he be even better in ten years or will he burn out? Helen Hunt always seems to shine in working mother roles. Kevin Spacey can do no wrong in my book, if you take into account that no actor in history has ever had a perfect record in choosing scripts.I liked director Mimi Leder's previous efforts. She has stated that Pay it Forward is the kind of movie she expected to direct in the first place. Ironically, her other movies were about such things as nuclear weapons and killer asteroids [The Peacemaker, Deep Impact]. She proved that a female director can successfully helm a thriller. Perhaps she should keep that genre in mind in the future.",2,The definition of a Bad 'Feel good' Flick,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,2498,"['Pay', 'Forward', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'good', 'director', 'what', 'looked', 'be', 'interesting', 'plot', 'Alas', 'greater', 'expectations', 'greater', 'disappointment', 'when', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'problem', 'story', 'several', 'times', 'false', 'manipulative', 'note', 'felt', 'used.Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Trevor', 'bright', 'troubled', 'kid', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'mother', 'Arlene', '[', 'Helen', 'Hunt', ']', 'alcoholic', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'caring', 'mother', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'kicking', 'addiction', 'husband', 'long', 'departed', 'Trevor', 'good', 'reason', 'hope', 'away', 'school', 'Trevor', 'new', 'social', 'studies', 'teacher', 'name', 'Eugene', '[', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', ']', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'face', 'badly', 'scarred', 'past', 'disfigurement', 'are', 'enough', 'keep', 'Eugene', 'living', 'own', 'controlled', 'little', 'world', 'teacher', 'class', 'year-long', 'assignment', 'students', 'must', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'Trevor', 'will', 'help', 'three', 'people', 'tell', 'should', 'pay', 'favor', 'forward', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'everyone', 'aids', 'three', 'others', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'drug', 'addict', '[', 'James', 'Caviezel', ']', 'whom', 'live', 'garage', 'When', 'Arlene', 'out', 'naturally', 'guy', 'out', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Trevor', 'vows', 'keep', 'nerdish', 'best', 'friend', 'getting', 'beaten', 'up', 'Finally', 'Eugene', 'perfect', 'match', 'Mom', 'efforts', 'continue', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'aforementioned', 'climax.The', 'cast', 'what', 'can', 'fact', 'three', 'leads', 'display', 'earnestness', 'touching', 'only', 'material', 'had', 'been', 'worth', 'efforts', 'Joel', 'Haley', 'Osment', 'performance', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'fluke', 'good', 'age', 'twelve', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'ten', 'years', 'will', 'burn', 'out', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'always', 'shine', 'working', 'mother', 'roles', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'book', 'take', 'account', 'actor', 'history', 'ever', 'had', 'perfect', 'record', 'choosing', 'scripts.I', 'liked', 'director', 'Mimi', 'Leder', 'previous', 'efforts', 'stated', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'kind', 'movie', 'expected', 'direct', 'first', 'place', 'Ironically', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'such', 'things', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'killer', 'asteroids', '[', 'Peacemaker', 'Deep', 'Impact', ']', 'proved', 'female', 'director', 'can', 'successfully', 'helm', 'thriller', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'keep', 'genre', 'mind', 'future']",N/A

Don't get me wrong I like Helen, but her makeup and trampy clothing just looked ""staged"", didn't look natural on her.Then there was Kevin Spacey, who plays a school teacher who is disfigured from a fire.

I wish a  director would give this kid aim.The story just never comes together, I knew the message of the film, and I liked the message, but it just never materializes.The best acting is by James Caviezel as a junkie (in a small role), Angie Dickinson (as the homeless alcoholic mother to Helen Hunt), and Jay Mohr as the reporter trying to track down ""pay it forward"" to its founder.The premise is , you do a random good deed for someone, and in turn they help out 3 people , so on, so on...Great idea.

When the teacher (Spacey) gave an assignment to his students, Trevor came up with a simple idea. Paying a favor not back, but forward, and not to one person but to three.  Not only he gained the attention of his teacher, but also his mother who is the most important person in his life. Initially he thought it was a failure.

Throw in some domestic violence, alcoholism, single-motherhood, and child abuse and you've got yourself Pay it Forward.The movie is fun to watch, but seems a bit too long and is definitely overly melodramatic in some scenes.  The final scene with the thousands of mourners driving up to the house with that Calling All Angels song is just begging for tears.

Especially in pessimistic times like today, it's easy to dismiss the idea that everyone will help each other out like all the characters do without a second thought.  But that also works to this movie's benefit.Kevin Spacey portrays Mr. Simonet, a junior high social studies teacher who gives his students an assignment to think of a way to change the world for the better, and put it into action.  Haley Joel Osment plays Trevor, a student who decides to do a pyramid system, in which he helps three people in a big way, and those three help three people each, those nine help three people each, and so on.  Trevor helps his mother (Helen Hunt), by setting him up with his teacher and being there for her through her struggle with alcoholism, a homeless man Jerry by letting him stay at his home and giving him some money for nice clothes, and finally, he helps a bullied friend at school in a way that can only be seen to be believed.  Also, while that is going on, a newspaper reporter who has been on the receiving end of the ""Pay it Forward"" system is working his way up the ladder to find out how it all began.The movie really makes you feel good while you watch it, if only because you wish that life was that simple.  Admittedly, the script isn't very literate, and as I said before, the result shown in the movie is not exactly believable by real world standards.  Finally, the biggest shortcoming of the movie is that the ending is not exactly uplifting for a movie that should make you feel good.  It's realistic, and I give it props for that, but for a movie that's supposed to put a smile on your face, it's really out of place.All and all, though, there's more to recommend than condemn.

His mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt) is a recovering alcoholic, his father Ricki (Jon Bon Jovi) is an absent, abusive deadbeat and they live in a run-down house with nothing but sadness around them.  Trevor is inspired by his teacher, Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey), who has a struggle not so easy to hide from others. He has burn scars on his face that often scare others away and this has made him so self conscious, his only friends are his students and he avoids contact (romantic or otherwise) with adults for fear of rejection.Eugene proposes taking the Golden Rule (&quot;do unto others....&quot;) to action - so that every time someone does something for you, you do something for someone else you don't even know.  Trevor decides to push the first domino by doing good deeds for those he doesn't know and before you know it, it has become a nation-wide trend to &quot;pay it forward.&quot;Behind the scenes, Trevor becomes a little matchmaker. He knows his mother needs a caring man to take care of her and that Eugene needs a caring woman to take care of him. He sees potential in them for romance,  while keeping his teacher as his mentor instead of leaving him behind as he advances to the next grade level.There is a lot of schmaltz in this film, everyone is either a demon or a philosopher.

Along with Trevor, we meet his 7th grade Social Studies teacher, Mr. Simonet.  Mr. Simonet stretches the youth imaginations as far as they want to take them with elongating their vocabulary and then making an assignment for extra credit....to come up with a way to make an influence and better society.Trevor's life thus far has been a hard one thus far with an alcoholic mother (Helen Hunt), an alcoholic and a living in the street grandmother (Angie Dickinson) and an alcoholic and abusive dad (Jon Bon Jovi).

If a marketing genius wants to sell a film like this why don't they start off by saying this story will never happen in real life, it's just for fun-show that in the previews-it's all a joke everybody! I would've been more happy with that! The entertainment value of this film would have meant something. Unfortunately, this film tries to take itself too seriously in almost every scene, offering layer upon layer of melodrama until you're either left with balling your brains out or becoming stark raving mad over having just paid $8 of your hard earned money and 2 hours of your time you will never see again sitting in a theatre with nothing to do but look at the equivalent of a blank screen.

577936,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00005ALS1,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","Pay It Forward (2000)Drama, Romance, 123 minutesDirected by Mimi LederStarring Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel OsmentPay It Forward follows two storylines. The first is introduced in the opening scene when a reporter sees a car crash into his own while it is parked. A complete stranger throws him the keys to a brand new Jaguar. The second story begins four months earlier when 11-year-old Trevor (Osment) is given a school assignment by his teacher, Mr. Simonet (Spacey).Here's the assignment:""Think of an idea to change our world - and put it into ACTION!""That sounds simple enough, doesn't it? The assignment is designed to inspire the students to make some small attempt to change something within their power, but Trevor takes it literally. He finds a homeless man, takes him home, feeds him, and allows him to sleep in the garage. His alcoholic mother, Arlene (Hunt), meets the man the following morning when Trevor invites him in to use the shower. Arlene is not pleased.People just don't take those kind of chances in the real world. The homeless man is a junkie and his arms are covered in needle marks. What if he is violent or mentally ill? But, what if he's just down on his luck and one small act of kindness could change his life? How do we know the results of our own actions? One smile or kind word at the right time could change someone's mood or make a much bigger difference.Trevor's idea isn't that simple. He vows to help three people, but these acts of kindness have to be something big. He tries to set up Mr. Simonet with his mother and wants to prevent a friend from being bullied at school. Simonet and Arlene provide the romantic element in the movie. Simonet has burns all over his face and Arlene works two jobs and struggles to stay sober. These characters are deeply flawed, but Trevor thinks he can improve both their lives.The second part of the idea requires the three people he helps to each do favors for three other people. He calls it paying it forward. We see some of the people who are helped and watch them try to help others. We're also shown the other story thread as the reporter follows the trail back to Trevor. Some of the revelations are quite astounding.In a way, this idea is similar to advertising. If you help someone and ask them to help others in return, you can't be sure that they will honor your request. If they do honor it, there's no guarantee you will ever know. It could happen months or years in the future. The idea is planted like a seed, just like an advertisement. Have you ever bought something months later because of an advertisement you once saw or heard about?It's unusual to see Spacey play such a regular guy. He's not cast as a cool criminal, an angry boss, or a rebellious employee; he's unsure of himself and a bit of a loser. Hunt doesn't exactly look glamorous either. The relationship seems authentic because these two people desperately need somebody in their lives. Angie Dickinson makes a brief appearance, but plays her role convincingly.Some of the best ideas in history seemed simple. Couldn't pay it forward really work if we just allowed ourselves to believe? Doesn't everyone have some good in them? It's been 12 years since the movie was made and the world seems the same, so I can only assume that the idea hasn't caught on. But for two hours, why not allow yourself to believe that it's possible? Some of the stories are touching and remarkable, while others are extremely sad.Mimi Leder tells a very human story and gives us characters who seem real. The acting is as good as you would expect from the exceptional talent on display. Another key ingredient is Thomas Newman's score, which reminds me of his work on American Beauty, also starring Spacey.Pay It Forward is a touching emotional drama with a strong story.",5,One small act can impact the whole world,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,3819,"['Pay', 'Forward', '2000', 'Drama', 'Romance', '123', 'minutesDirected', 'Mimi', 'LederStarring', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'OsmentPay', 'Forward', 'two', 'storylines', 'first', 'introduced', 'opening', 'scene', 'when', 'reporter', 'car', 'crash', 'own', 'parked', 'complete', 'stranger', 'keys', 'brand', 'new', 'Jaguar', 'second', 'story', 'four', 'months', 'earlier', 'when', '11-year-old', 'Trevor', 'Osment', 'given', 'school', 'assignment', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Simonet', 'Spacey', 'assignment', 'Think', 'idea', 'change', 'world', 'put', 'ACTION', 'simple', 'enough', ""n't"", 'assignment', 'designed', 'inspire', 'students', 'make', 'small', 'attempt', 'change', 'something', 'power', 'Trevor', 'literally', 'homeless', 'man', 'home', 'sleep', 'garage', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Arlene', 'Hunt', 'man', 'following', 'morning', 'when', 'Trevor', 'use', 'shower', 'Arlene', 'not', 'pleased.People', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'kind', 'chances', 'real', 'world', 'homeless', 'man', 'junkie', 'arms', 'are', 'covered', 'needle', 'marks', 'What', 'violent', 'mentally', 'ill', 'what', 'just', 'down', 'luck', 'one', 'small', 'act', 'kindness', 'could', 'change', 'life', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'results', 'own', 'actions', 'One', 'smile', 'kind', 'word', 'right', 'time', 'could', 'change', 'someone', 'mood', 'make', 'much', 'bigger', 'difference.Trevor', 'idea', ""n't"", 'that', 'simple', 'help', 'three', 'people', 'acts', 'kindness', 'have', 'be', 'something', 'big', 'set', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Simonet', 'mother', 'prevent', 'friend', 'being', 'bullied', 'school', 'Simonet', 'Arlene', 'provide', 'romantic', 'element', 'movie', 'Simonet', 'burns', 'face', 'Arlene', 'two', 'jobs', 'stay', 'sober', 'characters', 'are', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'Trevor', 'can', 'improve', 'lives.The', 'second', 'part', 'idea', 'three', 'people', 'do', 'favors', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'paying', 'forward', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'helped', 'watch', 'try', 'help', 'others', ""'re"", 'also', 'shown', 'other', 'story', 'thread', 'reporter', 'trail', 'back', 'Trevor', 'revelations', 'are', 'quite', 'way', 'idea', 'similar', 'advertising', 'help', 'someone', 'ask', 'help', 'others', 'return', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'will', 'honor', 'request', 'do', 'honor', 'guarantee', 'will', 'ever', 'know', 'could', 'happen', 'months', 'years', 'future', 'idea', 'planted', 'seed', 'just', 'advertisement', 'Have', 'ever', 'bought', 'something', 'months', 'later', 'advertisement', 'once', 'saw', 'heard', 'unusual', 'see', 'Spacey', 'play', 'such', 'regular', 'guy', 'not', 'cast', 'cool', 'criminal', 'angry', 'boss', 'rebellious', 'employee', 'unsure', 'bit', 'loser', 'Hunt', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'look', 'glamorous', 'relationship', 'authentic', 'two', 'people', 'desperately', 'need', 'somebody', 'lives', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'brief', 'appearance', 'role', 'convincingly.Some', 'best', 'ideas', 'history', 'seemed', 'simple', 'Could', ""n't"", 'pay', 'forward', 'really', 'work', 'just', 'allowed', 'ourselves', 'believe', 'Does', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'have', 'good', 'been', '12', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'world', 'same', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'idea', ""n't"", 'caught', 'two', 'hours', 'why', 'not', 'allow', 'believe', 'possible', 'stories', 'are', 'touching', 'remarkable', 'others', 'are', 'extremely', 'sad.Mimi', 'Leder', 'very', 'human', 'story', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'real', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'would', 'expect', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'display', 'key', 'ingredient', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'score', 'work', 'American', 'Beauty', 'also', 'starring', 'Spacey.Pay', 'Forward', 'touching', 'emotional', 'drama', 'strong', 'story']",N/A

This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time...My cousin and I decided to challenge our boredom and watch a movie the other day. I left my house with high hopes of ridding myself of redundancy but never expected that one movie could change my whole perception of an all-too-corrupt world. The title of this brilliant artwork is Pay it Forward. Although it features a list of talented actors who without-a-doubt add to the movie's success, the poise of this movie lies in the plot. A quick summary would never be enough to pay tribute to the movie's excellence, but carries out the message nonetheless.A local social studies teacher, Mr. Simonet, seems to have his life in perfect order. This perfection, his facade, is put to the test when he assigns his class a project: to think of one way to better our world. One of his students, Trevor, takes the assignment seriously and comes up with a beautifully sorted utopian idea. He presents his idea to the class and the teacher is impressed but not convinced of it's effectiveness. Pay it Forward is easy to understand. When someone does something for you that you could not achieve yourself, you must do something good for three other people. Then it's their turn to &quot;pay it forward.&quot;I think the message in this movie was beyond motivational. What I love most about this movie is that Trevor's idea is possible to achieve. This practice could start off as a mere chain but can eventually turn into an unconscious good-for-all event. People might even start doing good deeds because it comes from the heart, rather than to complete &quot;their part of the deal&quot; like the original concept of Pay it Forward implies. Overall, the movie is realistic and the concept is admirable. We can only hope that this movie's script will be acted out in our everyday lives.",5,Don't Forget to Pay It Forward,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,1857,"['THIS', 'MOVIE', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'cousin', 'decided', 'challenge', 'boredom', 'watch', 'movie', 'other', 'day', 'left', 'house', 'high', 'hopes', 'ridding', 'redundancy', 'never', 'expected', 'one', 'movie', 'could', 'change', 'whole', 'perception', 'all-too-corrupt', 'world', 'title', 'brilliant', 'artwork', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'list', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'without-a-doubt', 'add', 'movie', 'success', 'poise', 'movie', 'plot', 'quick', 'summary', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'enough', 'pay', 'tribute', 'movie', 'excellence', 'out', 'message', 'nonetheless.A', 'local', 'social', 'studies', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Simonet', 'have', 'life', 'perfect', 'order', 'perfection', 'facade', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'class', 'project', 'think', 'one', 'way', 'better', 'world', 'One', 'students', 'Trevor', 'assignment', 'seriously', 'up', 'beautifully', 'sorted', 'utopian', 'idea', 'idea', 'class', 'teacher', 'impressed', 'not', 'convinced', 'effectiveness', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'easy', 'understand', 'When', 'someone', 'something', 'could', 'not', 'achieve', 'must', 'do', 'something', 'good', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'Then', 'turn', 'quot', 'pay', 'forward.', 'quot', 'think', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'motivational', 'What', 'love', 'most', 'movie', 'Trevor', 'idea', 'possible', 'achieve', 'practice', 'could', 'start', 'off', 'mere', 'chain', 'can', 'eventually', 'turn', 'unconscious', 'good-for-all', 'event', 'People', 'might', 'even', 'start', 'doing', 'good', 'deeds', 'heart', 'rather', 'complete', 'quot', 'part', 'deal', 'quot', 'original', 'concept', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'Overall', 'movie', 'realistic', 'concept', 'admirable', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'movie', 'script', 'will', 'be', 'acted', 'out', 'everyday', 'lives']",N/A

I DO try to impress upon you when a great film comes to the fore.Pay It Forward is a Hollywood production (usually the Kiss Of Mediocrity), that took a step forward. As if you could lose casting Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt together, you now have Haley Joel Osment as the catalyst. The so altuistic idea of doing something nice for someone BEFORE you need to, has been around since the earliest Greek plays.  The Greeks just never presented a script as perfect as this.While the underlying story of Spacey(Osment's school teacher whom Osment arranges to fall in love with Hunt, Osment's mother) and Hunt (Osment's mother who is a recovering alcholic with a missing husband) have both been played before, there is a magic between the two. Both have their abusive demons controlling their lives (Spacey's character has a bit of a surprise). Each has such a loneliness unique to themselves, but shared. But it is all truly surpassed by the touching and powerful performance of Osment. Ever since The Ususal Suspects, I've known Spacey was good. And I have been in love with Hunt since Mad About You. But Osment is something special. This young man proved himself in 6th Sense. How do you follow that character? How do you avoid the sophmore jinx? You take the role of Trevor McKinney, an altruistic child who believes the world should be, and can be made better, by doing right by someone without their asking. Osment conveys emotion, as do Spacey and Hunt, but his performance surpasses theirs.Most reviews ruin the movie by giving away the story. I won't do that. I think the word of mouth from those who have seen it will give most viewers an idea of the plot. It is the FEELING from these actors that left the screen and enveloped me. There was such a range of emotion, that I was completely drawn in. Jon Bon Jovi as the abusive husband is well cast (yes, he CAN act) and Angie Dickenson should have won the Academy Award for best supporting actress as Hunt's alchoholic mother.I refuse to reveal the plot or story like most reviewers. It would sully the effect. You will watch this film, you will not get up to get a snack, and you will cry at the end. Men, I mean you too. You will watch the credits wondering if the Pay It Forward idea would really work. Do NOT pass on this movie if your wife or girlfriend suggests it. This is not a chick flick.

It's a feel-good film until then, and the hokey scene of all the cars with their headlights on snaking up the drive to the McKinney house is stolen right from the ending of Field of Dreams---which was a much better movie.  Kevin Spacey delivers his usual crafted, intelligent work.  Helen Hunt is out of her depth as the alcoholic mom, and nobody on her level of income would live that well.  Haley Joel Osment proves once again that he is an outstanding actor; let's hope he can make the transition to adult roles when he grows up.

577944,AW9ERFQZBVCO6,B00005ALS1,The Night Falcon,"[1, 1]","Since other reviewers have done a good job summarizing the story of this film, I want to add the following:This has got to be one of the sweetest stories I've ever seen told on film.  The real driving force behind this story is young actor Haley Joel Osment.  While his performance in ""The Sixth Sense"" was intense, his intensity and pathos delivery is far from lacking in this story as well. The story is about a young boy who comes up with a way to help the world remember the joy that comes in giving to others, especially total strangers.  The interaction between Kevin Spacey's character and that of Helen Hunt is a reminder that some of us wear our scares on the outside, while others wear them on the inside.  Good character development in this film: Just great for the whole family to watch.  The only violent scene is at the end when young Trevor, played by Haley Osment, is stabbed by another school kid and dies a martre for a great cause of love and giving. This is a film well worth watching that talks about the brokeness of the human condition and how all of us can make a difference in this broken world of ours.  Better buy a box of tissues for this one if you are prone to cry, because this one will make the tears fall from your eyes; partly out of joy and partly out of saddness as you embrace this well made production.The only real disappointment was the commentary section on the DVD done by the Director Mimi Leder.  The director could have offered far more information, but mostly stayed silent through most of the film while offering some insight into the making of the film.  Otherwise it still gets a 5 star rating from me for story content, acting and character development.  The cinematography and night lighting work is also very good in this production.",5,Thumbs up for a great message!,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1785,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'summarizing', 'story', 'film', 'want', 'add', 'following', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'sweetest', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'told', 'film', 'real', 'driving', 'force', 'story', 'young', 'actor', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'performance', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'intense', 'intensity', 'pathos', 'delivery', 'far', 'lacking', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'way', 'help', 'world', 'remember', 'joy', 'giving', 'others', 'especially', 'total', 'strangers', 'interaction', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'reminder', 'wear', 'scares', 'outside', 'others', 'wear', 'inside', 'Good', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'Just', 'great', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'only', 'violent', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'young', 'Trevor', 'played', 'Haley', 'Osment', 'stabbed', 'school', 'kid', 'martre', 'great', 'cause', 'love', 'giving', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'talks', 'brokeness', 'human', 'condition', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'broken', 'world', 'ours', 'Better', 'buy', 'box', 'tissues', 'one', 'are', 'prone', 'cry', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'tears', 'fall', 'eyes', 'partly', 'joy', 'partly', 'saddness', 'embrace', 'well', 'made', 'production.The', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'was', 'commentary', 'section', 'DVD', 'done', 'Director', 'Mimi', 'Leder', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'offered', 'far', 'more', 'information', 'mostly', 'stayed', 'silent', 'most', 'film', 'offering', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'still', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'story', 'content', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'cinematography', 'night', 'lighting', 'work', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'production']",N/A
577945,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005ALS1,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[3, 3]","Director:  Mimi LederCast:  Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment, Jay Mohr, James Caviezel, Jon Bon Jovi, Angie Dickinson, David Ramsey, Gary Werntz.Running Time:  123 minutesRated PG-13 for mature thematic elements including substance abuse/recovery, some sexual situations, language and brief violence.A deceptively dark, yet extremely moving film that seems light-hearted and somewhat fun on first glance, but just keeps on emotionally evolving as it progresses. Trevor McKinley (Haley Joel Osment) is fresh into middle school. His new teacher is a strange, disfigured man named Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) and the class has been given an assignment to come up with a logical idea. Trevor is a normal kid, a little on the punky side. However he comes up with an idea called paying it forward. Help someone, then ask only that they help someone and then it continues.Mr. Simonet likes the idea and Trevor wants to try it out. After coming up with three people to use for the experiment he begins. Trevor's mom, Arlene (Helen Hunt) is troubled and an alcoholic. Trevor first wants to try and hook up his mom with Mr Simonet. His second is to help a homeless man named Jerry (James Caviezel) get back on his feet.  Through the trials, Trevor's plans seem to be failing but little does he know that slowly Mr. Simonet and Arlene are falling for one another and Jerry is trying to get back on track even after leaving. Will Trevor's idea be successful in a world wide helping idea.  The message from this movie is one everyone should listen to: help others even when it is unwanted or unknown. Haley Joel Osment is good in an odd role of a punky kid. Helen Hunt is startling good as the drunken mother trying to get her life together and Kevin Spacey is just plain awesome as the troubled teacher.To compliment the talented cast is director Mimi Leder (whose earlier works include the George Clooney and Nicole Kidman thriller ""The Peacemaker"" and Morgan Freeman's ""Deep Impact). In ""Pay it Forward"", Leder does a near perfect job of directing a story with a lot of depth and realism and keeps the flow of the film interesting and doesn't let the film get caught up in boring or uninspired dialogue, but that could be because the material and ideas she had to work with were so captivating.  Leslie Dixon should also be thanked because her screenplay was intelligent and really holds your interest and won't let go. Haley Joel Osment is good in an odd role of a punky kid. Helen Hunt is startling good as the drunken mother trying to get her life together and Kevin Spacey is just plain awesome as the troubled teacher.The trio make for an effective elixir in our jaded times manifest and displays their acting muscles flexing and chomping at the bit but falters in the closing moments of an other wise exemplery attempt in re-instilling the concept of mankind being humane.
