1267553,A14COU5OWHU5RT,B002GIBVQ6,Allen,"[7, 12]","The premise of Wild Child is simple. A spoilt dirty-rich American teen is shipped off to an all-girls boarding school in England to try and knock some sense into her. From the word go this film is so clich&eacute;d it's a painful viewing.The film advertises itself as a teen comedy, but is aimed at the Hannah Montana Disney Channel youth of today who can relate to the squealing glittery Emma Roberts on screen. Even the mundanely-dressed schoolgirls are irritating and giggly. The flaw of this film is that it does not appeal to any other age group unlike classic teen comedies such as Mean Girls and Clueless, which can be enjoyed by many. The only people who would be seen dead at this film are eight to twelve year old girls.Wild Child is a fluffy ball of cringe-fest, predictable and downright annoying, only to be appreciated by pre-teens.",1,Same old......,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,846,"['premise', 'Wild', 'Child', 'simple', 'spoilt', 'dirty-rich', 'American', 'teen', 'shipped', 'off', 'all-girls', 'boarding', 'school', 'England', 'try', 'knock', 'sense', 'word', 'go', 'film', 'so', 'clich', 'eacute', 'painful', 'viewing.The', 'film', 'teen', 'comedy', 'aimed', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'youth', 'today', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'squealing', 'glittery', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'screen', 'Even', 'mundanely-dressed', 'schoolgirls', 'are', 'irritating', 'giggly', 'flaw', 'film', 'not', 'appeal', 'other', 'age', 'group', 'classic', 'teen', 'comedies', 'such', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Clueless', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'dead', 'film', 'are', 'eight', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'girls.Wild', 'Child', 'fluffy', 'ball', 'cringe-fest', 'predictable', 'downright', 'annoying', 'only', 'be', 'appreciated', 'pre-teens']",N/A
1267554,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002GIBVQ6,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Wild Child is probably a weak 4-star rating due to 20 minutes of horrible writing near the middle that I'll explain below, but the good news is that the movie makes up for that lousy part by its conclusion.When a spoiled, stuck up California blondie is sent to a British boarding school by her father for misbehaving and being out of control, she has to adjust to an entirely new situation with different culture and people than she's accustomed to.  This is actually a fantastic idea for a storyline.  However there's a few flaws that prevent it from ever reaching greatness, and almost making me regret giving it 4 stars.  It's honestly more deserving of 3 stars, but perhaps such an original concept is enabling me to be more forgiving.The biggest problem is that this boarding school is NOT strict enough.  The teachers (well, teacher- can't remember seeing any other authority figures unless you count the laundry lady) are really lenient towards the kids whenever they step out of line, which strikes me as highly unusual.  Even the same type of schools here in America are pretty strict, so it seems likely that the British ones are either equally or perhaps *more* strict.  Time and time again this American girl would disrespect the teacher and her classmates and yet, no disciplinary action would ever occur.  Odd!  Don't tell me everyone's being forgiving just because she's American?  I'd like to think they'd be even more harsh then!  hahaAnyway, the problem I have is that halfway through, the girl eventually becomes close with the other British girls, and they escape the school in a car and head out to have fun by pretending to be old enough to buy liquor, getting their hair done and the worst part of all- involving themselves in some kind of dance where they have WAY too much fun, and it's completely overblown and unncessary writing in my opinion (not to mention 20 minutes too long).However the movie redeems itself by the ending, thankfully.  This is when the American girl appears to have been set-up by someone determined to make her look guilty concerning a matter (that I won't spoil).  The writing is really sincere and the positive message at the end is really good.  Just ignore that one horrible lengthy stretch of bad writing in the middle and especially the fact this is the nicest, most forgiving boarding school in existence, and you'll have yourself a really good movie.",4,don't ever be wild in other countries,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2408,"['Wild', 'Child', 'probably', 'weak', '4-star', 'rating', 'due', '20', 'minutes', 'horrible', 'writing', 'middle', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'good', 'news', 'movie', 'up', 'lousy', 'part', 'conclusion.When', 'spoiled', 'stuck', 'up', 'California', 'blondie', 'sent', 'British', 'boarding', 'school', 'father', 'misbehaving', 'being', 'control', 'adjust', 'entirely', 'new', 'situation', 'different', 'culture', 'people', 'accustomed', 'actually', 'fantastic', 'idea', 'storyline', 'However', 'few', 'flaws', 'prevent', 'ever', 'reaching', 'greatness', 'almost', 'making', 'regret', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'honestly', 'more', 'deserving', '3', 'stars', 'perhaps', 'such', 'original', 'concept', 'enabling', 'be', 'more', 'forgiving.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'boarding', 'school', 'NOT', 'strict', 'enough', 'teachers', 'well', 'teacher-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'other', 'authority', 'figures', 'count', 'laundry', 'lady', 'are', 'really', 'lenient', 'kids', 'whenever', 'step', 'line', 'highly', 'unusual', 'Even', 'same', 'type', 'schools', 'here', 'America', 'are', 'pretty', 'strict', 'likely', 'British', 'ones', 'are', 'equally', 'perhaps', '*more*', 'strict', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'American', 'girl', 'would', 'disrespect', 'teacher', 'classmates', 'yet', 'disciplinary', 'action', 'would', 'ever', 'occur', 'Odd', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'everyone', 'being', 'forgiving', 'just', 'American', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'even', 'more', 'harsh', 'then', 'hahaAnyway', 'problem', 'have', 'halfway', 'girl', 'eventually', 'close', 'other', 'British', 'girls', 'escape', 'school', 'car', 'head', 'have', 'fun', 'pretending', 'be', 'old', 'enough', 'buy', 'liquor', 'getting', 'hair', 'done', 'worst', 'part', 'all-', 'involving', 'kind', 'dance', 'where', 'have', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'completely', 'overblown', 'unncessary', 'writing', 'opinion', 'not', 'mention', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'ending', 'thankfully', 'when', 'American', 'girl', 'have', 'been', 'set-up', 'someone', 'determined', 'make', 'look', 'guilty', 'concerning', 'matter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'writing', 'really', 'sincere', 'positive', 'message', 'end', 'really', 'good', 'Just', 'ignore', 'one', 'horrible', 'lengthy', 'stretch', 'bad', 'writing', 'middle', 'especially', 'fact', 'nicest', 'most', 'forgiving', 'boarding', 'school', 'existence', ""'ll"", 'have', 'really', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

Though she's handed credit cards with unlimited balances and surrounded by countless hangers on, Poppy can't escape the mounting frustration she feels with her family situation and she makes sure everyone knows it. After an over-the-top prank pushes her father (Aidan Quinn) one step too far, Poppy is shipped off to an England/English boarding school.Finding herself in a foreign world of early curfews, stern matrons, and mandatory lacrosse, the United States|American princess has finally met her match: a school of British girls who won't tolerate her rebellious ways. Under the watchful eye of the school's headmistress (Natasha Richardson) and surrounded by a new circle of friends (Josie, Kate, KiKi & Drippy), Poppy begrudgingly realises her bad-girl behavior will only get her so far. But just because she must grow into a fine young lady doesn't mean this Wild Child won't be spending every waking hour shaking up a very proper system. Poppy Moore starts Abbey Mount as she means to go on-her way,or no way.Realising her Dad's not coming back to get her, and having nowhere to fit in, room-mate Kate tells Poppy she'll have to get herself expelled. Later that night, Poppy reads a book (Alice In Wonderland - her punishment for fighting) with a lighter when her room-mates sneak up on her with torches, and offer their help. They give their ideas on how she can get expelled, and act on them as a group, and let her take the blame. This brings the girls closer, but Poppy still wants to leave. When none of the plans to get Poppy expelled are working the girls realise they will have to go all out and hit the headmistress closer to home by snogging her son Freddie, which is completely forbidden by the school. After some flirting, Freddie asks Poppy out on a date, during which they kiss. Before going out with Freddie, Poppy is so excited she doesn't log off the computer, and runs off. Harriet takes her revenge on Poppy by rewriting her emails to best friend Ruby, and sticks one on the girls' door, suggesting that Poppy is just using them and is faking the friendship. Harriet also rewrites an email about Freddie, stating Poppy's plan to kiss him only to get expelled and that she thinks he is a loser.Coming back from her night out, Poppy is ready to confess she's actually happy, to find the girls upset. They read the email to her and leave. Upset, Poppy goes to see Freddie but he has found the email about him also and feels betrayed. Poppy, with no one else to turn to, sneaks down to the cook's room to use the phone and rings Ruby, who it turns out is sleeping. Even more alone, Poppy starts playing with her lighter, setting a curtain alight. Hearing footsteps, she quickly puts out the fire and runs off. A few minutes later, she looks out her window to see a fire, and wakes Kate and the rest of the school. After the fire is put out, Freddie looks at the damage and finds her lighter. He gives it back to her, refusing to listen to what happened. Poppy goes to the headmistress and confesses. Poppy also asks Mrs. Kingsley to give a letter to Freddie apologizing and confessing her feelings about everything.While waiting for the Honour Court which will decide if she should be expelled, she finds a picture of her Mum and the lacrosse team. Poppy sits with the picture when Freddie finds her crying. After a heart to heart, they are friends again. At the Honour Court, Poppy tells her story while her room-mates find out Poppy was out with Freddie when the email was sent, and Harriet was the only one around. Going to the court,they get the whole school to confess they were present at the fire. Harriet then lets slip about Poppy's lighter being used to start the fire, which only Poppy and Freddie knew about, and accidentally confesses to restarting the fire after Poppy successfully put it out. Poppy is innocent.

1267570,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B002GIBVQ6,Kate McMurry,"[1, 2]","Poppy (Emma Roberts, daughter of Eric Roberts and niece of Julia Roberts) is a spoiled, Malibu ""Mean Girl."" Her widowed father's indulgence of her bad behavior comes to an abrupt end when she destroys the property of his girlfriend who is moving into their ocean-view mansion. He ships off Poppy to a prim and proper, old-fashioned boarding school in England led by a kind but firm headmistress (Natasha Richardson in her final role before her untimely death) in hopes that the school can whip his wayward daughter into shape.This movie is rather formulaic: An angry, alienated teenage girl with superficial, materialistic values learns the sterling attributes of integrity, loyalty and teamwork. I doubt that many adults roped into watching this film with their children or grandchildren will enjoy it any more than I did. I myself found it rather boring and Poppy more aggravating than sympathetic. I also had trouble with her father's and the headmistress's inexplicable failure to inform the rebellious Poppy of the emotional significance of the boarding school for her personally. Poor Poppy only found out this crucial information by stumbling upon it by accident. If she had known it from the beginning, it would have eliminated a huge percentage of her conflict-creating anger and resentment, rendering the entire, main story conflict one that could have been resolved by a single, heartfelt conversation.Adult opinions aside, however, I think that preteen and young-teen girls will very much enjoy this movie, and reviewing it from their perspective, as the intended audience, I am giving it four stars. It is also a G-rated film that is suitable for girls of all ages.Emma Roberts does a good job with a limited, stereotyped role, and the girls who play her new British friends are cute and funny.

1267574,AYMVQD757T4ZS,B002GIBVQ6,"Kody ""ParisHiltonFan""","[6, 10]","There's no doubt about it, Wild Child is not a film for the male populace. So far this year I've had a surprisingly rewarding experience with chick flicks, usually finding at least something positive to cling onto during the course of the feature, and at times even enjoying the movie as a whole. Yet today was not one of those days, as sadly enough, my male attributes got the better of me. With all of this said however, despite my obvious problem with connecting to any of the characters on the screen, I found it hard to believe that anyone could do so regardless of gender, age or anything else; Wild Child is formulaic, dumb, mawkish and irksome not just through it's nave, inane plot but more importantly, through its -just as- banal characters. Devoid of any real likable personalities or interesting, original characterisation, director Nick Moore's feature length debut neither sustains any entertainment value nor offers any significant insight into the script's themes. Younger, female audiences will probably appreciate it a little better than me, but not by much.I don't know what's worse; watching lead character Poppy (Emma Roberts), a supposed rebellious Buddhist fashion queen of Malibu prance around for the first half of the movie playing the same ""Eww! England is so dirty and medieval!"" note, or seeing the British antagonised once again as stuffy, snobbish, dirty, monarchist morons that have never heard of an iPhone. Told in two polarising halves, the story here attempts to tell the tale of someone becoming a better person and coming of age by leaving behind their spoiled, bourgeois lifestyle behind for a much more disciplined and simpler life. Instead however, what Wild Child achieves is a sort of cartoon annoyance that's only real intent seems to be to rehash countless other similar stories whilst at the same time demoralising every act and line of dialogue that comes out of all the characters' mouths. It's transparent and utterly drab, never truly conveying the difference in cultures between the British and Americans with relevance or even comic effect; I wonder if you have ever seen Wife Swap? If so, it's a bit like that, only with more cheese at the end of the race.The first half of the movie with its black and white ethics and cultural insight tinged with humourless jokes and crass characterisation is thankfully the weaker half, but this still doesn't say much for the second. Following Poppy as she and her new friends attempt to get her expelled from the boarding school so that she can travel back home to Malibu, it's of no surprise that soon Poppy -through trying to escape- finds she doesn't want to leave. Not only is it predictable and without any original flavours whatsoever, but it's overlong and tiresome. The working in of a seedy antagonist set out to take revenge on Poppy for the sheer sake that she's always been the queen of the school and now Poppy looks to steal her thunder, is just as tedious and useless. In the end all these elements come together in the form of a ridiculous school court hearing, judging the fate of a certain character and at this point it's clear just how derivative and mawkish the whole affair is. Of course it all climaxes in a super happy ending for everyone but the evil antagonist that actually presumes you thought it was going to end up anywhere else, yet doesn't ever lead you to do so beforehand.This just about sums up the entire feature; it's anticlimactic, mundane and lazy with only slight glints of interest to be seen over the course of the superfluous runtime. One underused strength in particular is the relationship dynamic between Poppy and her father, yet sharing only a few scenes together, nothing much is achieved or capitalised on. Instead the film occupies most of its time making sure to throw in tired jokes about the differences in culture that presumably exists between America and Britian, which, if you've ever been to both countries, you'll know isn't as caricature as it is portrayed here. Of course, cultural stereotypes can be funny, but that's not the case here; it's hum-drum humour filtered through characters that you don't even want to laugh with. I suppose if I was to state one clear coherent aspect of the film, it would be Michael Price's score. Yet I hope you can see that with a movie such as this, when the music captures your attention more than anything else that is going on, you've got trouble. Lame, sappy and pretentious, it certainly won't help to see this if you're a guy, but even if you're not, I advise you give it a miss anyway; this isn't a chick flick, it's a nobody flick.",1,"This isn't a chick flick, it's a nobody flick",1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2010,4628,"['doubt', 'Wild', 'Child', 'not', 'film', 'male', 'populace', 'So', 'far', 'year', ""'ve"", 'had', 'surprisingly', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'chick', 'flicks', 'usually', 'finding', 'least', 'something', 'positive', 'cling', 'course', 'feature', 'times', 'even', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'whole', 'today', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'days', 'sadly', 'enough', 'male', 'attributes', 'got', 'better', 'said', 'however', 'obvious', 'problem', 'connecting', 'characters', 'screen', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'anyone', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'regardless', 'gender', 'age', 'anything', 'else', 'Wild', 'Child', 'formulaic', 'dumb', 'mawkish', 'irksome', 'not', 'just', 'nave', 'inane', 'plot', 'more', 'importantly', '-just', 'as-', 'banal', 'characters', 'Devoid', 'real', 'likable', 'personalities', 'interesting', 'original', 'characterisation', 'director', 'Nick', 'Moore', 'feature', 'length', 'debut', 'entertainment', 'value', 'significant', 'insight', 'script', 'themes', 'Younger', 'female', 'audiences', 'will', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'little', 'better', 'not', 'much.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'worse', 'watching', 'lead', 'character', 'Poppy', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'supposed', 'rebellious', 'Buddhist', 'fashion', 'queen', 'Malibu', 'prance', 'around', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'playing', 'same', 'Eww', 'England', 'so', 'dirty', 'medieval', 'note', 'seeing', 'British', 'antagonised', 'once', 'again', 'stuffy', 'snobbish', 'dirty', 'monarchist', 'morons', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'iPhone', 'Told', 'two', 'polarising', 'halves', 'story', 'here', 'tell', 'tale', 'someone', 'becoming', 'better', 'person', 'coming', 'age', 'leaving', 'spoiled', 'bourgeois', 'lifestyle', 'much', 'more', 'disciplined', 'simpler', 'life', 'Instead', 'however', 'what', 'Wild', 'Child', 'sort', 'cartoon', 'annoyance', 'only', 'real', 'intent', 'be', 'rehash', 'countless', 'other', 'similar', 'stories', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'demoralising', 'act', 'line', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'mouths', 'transparent', 'utterly', 'drab', 'never', 'truly', 'conveying', 'difference', 'cultures', 'British', 'Americans', 'relevance', 'even', 'comic', 'effect', 'wonder', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Wife', 'Swap', 'so', 'bit', 'only', 'more', 'cheese', 'end', 'race.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'ethics', 'cultural', 'insight', 'tinged', 'humourless', 'jokes', 'crass', 'characterisation', 'thankfully', 'weaker', 'half', 'still', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'second', 'Following', 'Poppy', 'new', 'friends', 'attempt', 'get', 'expelled', 'boarding', 'school', 'can', 'travel', 'back', 'home', 'Malibu', 'surprise', 'soon', 'Poppy', '-through', 'trying', 'escape-', 'finds', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'Not', 'only', 'predictable', 'original', 'flavours', 'whatsoever', 'overlong', 'tiresome', 'working', 'seedy', 'antagonist', 'set', 'out', 'take', 'revenge', 'Poppy', 'sheer', 'sake', 'always', 'been', 'queen', 'school', 'now', 'Poppy', 'steal', 'thunder', 'just', 'as', 'tedious', 'useless', 'end', 'elements', 'come', 'together', 'form', 'ridiculous', 'school', 'court', 'hearing', 'judging', 'fate', 'certain', 'character', 'point', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'derivative', 'mawkish', 'whole', 'affair', 'course', 'climaxes', 'super', 'happy', 'ending', 'everyone', 'evil', 'antagonist', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'anywhere', 'else', 'yet', ""n't"", 'ever', 'lead', 'do', 'so', 'beforehand.This', 'just', 'sums', 'entire', 'feature', 'anticlimactic', 'mundane', 'lazy', 'only', 'slight', 'glints', 'interest', 'be', 'seen', 'course', 'superfluous', 'runtime', 'One', 'underused', 'strength', 'particular', 'relationship', 'dynamic', 'Poppy', 'father', 'yet', 'sharing', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'together', 'nothing', 'much', 'achieved', 'capitalised', 'Instead', 'film', 'most', 'time', 'making', 'sure', 'throw', 'tired', 'jokes', 'differences', 'culture', 'presumably', 'America', 'Britian', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'countries', ""'ll"", 'know', ""n't"", 'as', 'caricature', 'portrayed', 'here', 'course', 'cultural', 'stereotypes', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'hum-drum', 'humour', 'filtered', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'laugh', 'suppose', 'was', 'state', 'one', 'clear', 'coherent', 'aspect', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Michael', 'Price', 'score', 'hope', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'such', 'when', 'music', 'attention', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'going', ""'ve"", 'got', 'trouble', 'Lame', 'sappy', 'pretentious', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', ""'re"", 'guy', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'advise', 'give', 'miss', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'chick', 'flick', 'nobody', 'flick']",N/A

If you are looking for a young chick flick with with a dash of romance, this one is a great choice.This movie has been done before... A LOT. What sets this film apart is the stellar cast.  It is the last movie made by Natasha Richardson and casting Alex Pettyfer as the love interest doesn't hurt.  The lead is played by Emma Roberts (the daughter of actor Eric Roberts and Julia Robert's niece), who obviously has taken some pointers from family members.  She shines in this role as a snotty rich kid who transforms into the young woman she was meant to be.  She got caught up in the fast lane of California living after her mother passed and when her dad has had enough, she gets carted off to her mom's old boarding school - in England!  There is an obvious clash of cultures as she has to find her way in a foreign school with it's own caste system.  Enter the mean girls and a handsome son of a headmistress and there's your plot.  You know how it ends but getting there is pure fun!We all know what is going to happen but isn't that half the reason we watch this kind of movie?  As a viewer, you are not looking at this dvd as an option and thinking -- I want to watch award winning cinema!  You know you are getting a lighthearted teen romp.  You'll discover a young woman finding herself, real friends and love as she searches for meaning in her life.
