The celebrity guest stars are top-notch, and Lisa Kudrow - and everyone - is so great at improvising! The plot moves along nicely in the footage added to the web series content. You would never guess that segments of a single episode were filmed two or three years apart. One of the best shows on right now!",4,HILARIOUS!,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,367,"['second', 'season', 'show', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'celebrity', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'everyone', 'so', 'great', 'improvising', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'nicely', 'footage', 'added', 'web', 'series', 'content', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'segments', 'single', 'episode', 'were', 'filmed', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'apart', 'One', 'best', 'shows', 'right', 'now']",Web Therapy: Season 2

Kudrow is fantastic in her role as Fiona Wallace, and her choices for guest stars on this series is spot-on.  A real highlight is Lily Tomlin as Fiona's mother.

Lisa Kudrows character is hilarious, and as appalling as her behavior is, you find yourself drawn to her and want her to come out on top.  The rest of the cast is just as funny.  How can you go wrong with Lilly Tomlin, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Meryl Streep, together on the same show?",4,So original,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,320,"['ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'series', 'Lisa', 'Kudrows', 'character', 'hilarious', 'as', 'appalling', 'behavior', 'find', 'drawn', 'want', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'funny', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Lilly', 'Tomlin', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'together', 'same', 'show']",Web Therapy: Season 2
