It's a delightful interpretation of what Twain's lecture series performances would have been like. I particularly enjoy this performance because of the artistry of Mr. Holbrook's interpretation and delivery of Twain: Twain was supposedly the master of the comic pause for effect, and Holbrook seems a fine practitioner of that art.Much of the material was familiar to me from reading Twain. Yet the performance certainly adds another dimension to one's enjoyment of Mark Twain's high art of civilized comedy and truthful commentary on the human condition. It is a comedy that is merciful to what is sincere and merciless to what is false - always seasoned with humility. It is a comedy, that with exceptions such as Garrison Keillor, modern America has forgotten. Twain's honesty, perspicacity, humility, and irreverence were what made him the luminary he was: The majority of modern comics only score one out of four on that list. If watching this performance motivates you to read one of Twain's books, I highly commendRoughing It. My only caveat about this program is you may subsequently feel betrayed and defrauded by all the ""comedians"" and ""humorists"" you have listened to before, and subsequently find it odious to return to their company.

And this 90-minute DVD of a 1967 CBS television broadcast is as close to the real thing as you're ever going to get to experiencing Twain's lecture platform performance.Hal Holbrook faithfully recreates Twain's look, his mannerisms, and his material. Drawing chiefly from Twain's published works, Holbrook tells of his boyhood, his experiences as a steamboat pilot, his world travels and excerpts from his greatest novel. Holbrook is an acknowledged Twain expert and Ken Burns featured him in his 2002 documentary ""Mark Twain.""I have each of my students perform a dramatic reading from ""Huck Finn,"" and use the ""Huck & Jim"" chapter from this DVD to illustrate how it is possible to breathe life into these characters. [My only disappointment is that the ""Lynching"" chapter is not the Col. Sherburn lynching scene from ""Huck Finn."" I have a  two-cassette edition of Holbrook's performance, however, that does include this dramatic scene.]The customers who have posted lackluster reviews need to realize that Twain was not a stand-up comedian. He was a humorist. A satirist. He chose his words carefully. (It took nearly seven years to complete ""Huck Finn,"" for crying out loud!) As Twain himself once said: ""I am not 'an' American. I am 'the' American."" This presentation gives you a glimpse of one of this country's greatest Americans.Holbrook is 85 now and still touring, but even at the tender age of 40 he was Mark Twain incarnate.

Adams,"[12, 12]","Those of us old enough to have seen Holbrook do his one-man Twain show in the 1960's, and to have owned the original cast recordings ""Mark Twain Tonight"" and ""Encore: More Mark Twain Tonight"" know that this 1967 television version featured second-rate material. Yet second-rate Twain is still better than most comic/philosophical writing. (There was also an original cast recording of this show released.) Now there is a CD on Columbia Legacy called ""Mark Twain Tonight"" which combines some producer's idea of the best of each of the three older records. I would have picked some different bits if I had the task, but overall that is pretty good and well worth the money. Since this DVD is the only thing available showing Holbrook as Twain when Hal was still young, playing Mark at the age of 70, it will have to do. If you are a real Twain fan, or a real fan of one-person stage offerings, this should be in your collection...but get that CD also, before it goes out of print, for some even better material. In the TV show, the one mistake was spending too many of the 90 minutes on the more ""serious"" side of Twain---the anti-war social criticism aspect of his works. Don't sit down to watch this and expect it to be all laughs, all the time.",4,"Not his best material, but still a great performance...",1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,1245,"['old', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'Holbrook', 'do', 'one-man', 'Twain', 'show', '1960', 'have', 'owned', 'original', 'cast', 'recordings', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Tonight', 'Encore', 'More', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Tonight', 'know', '1967', 'television', 'version', 'featured', 'second-rate', 'material', 'second-rate', 'Twain', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'comic/philosophical', 'writing', 'was', 'also', 'original', 'cast', 'recording', 'show', 'released', 'Now', 'CD', 'Columbia', 'Legacy', 'called', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Tonight', 'producer', 'idea', 'best', 'three', 'older', 'records', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'different', 'bits', 'had', 'task', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'well', 'money', 'DVD', 'only', 'thing', 'available', 'showing', 'Holbrook', 'Twain', 'when', 'Hal', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'playing', 'Mark', 'age', '70', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'are', 'real', 'Twain', 'fan', 'real', 'fan', 'one-person', 'stage', 'offerings', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'get', 'CD', 'also', 'print', 'even', 'better', 'material', 'TV', 'show', 'one', 'mistake', 'was', 'spending', 'too', 'many', '90', 'minutes', 'more', 'serious', 'side', 'Twain', '-the', 'anti-war', 'social', 'criticism', 'aspect', 'works', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'expect', 'be', 'laughs', 'time']",N/A
