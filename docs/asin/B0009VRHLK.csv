It's not just ""shots of his head and the windshield"" (even though there is alot of that); There are lots of different, interesting shots, nicely done and it's not just his own turmoil; others' are shown as well.  It's a compassionate film.  Is it vain? So what if it is; it's his movie; if he wants to make a movie and watch himself so be it; nobody else has to watch it. I think he's an interesting looking and intrigueing enough person, just like Chloe.  This is basically a travelog, no different from what thousands of Americans have shot. I've driven cross country 4 times alone and it's pretty much exactly like this.  It also has some jarring emotional angles thrown in to make it a movie.  As far as Chloe's involvement, hey, if it strokes his ego to have thee Chloe suck him off, and Chloe is willing to do it,  good for him- the thing is is that he has spendt most the movie giving us time to think n' wait, thus giving the filmic catharsis weight.

On the way he meets women that share the same pain that he has. When he finally arrives in California we get to witness some of the best film making (not talking about the explicit oral scene for which this movie is famous for)in American Cinema History.Vincent Gallo's ""Brown Bunny"" is one of those films that is heavily bashed during its opening and then 5-10 years later is looked back on as a masterpiece.The Brown Bunny was said to be ""the worst film in the history of the Cannes Film Festival"", by Roger Ebert. But then after it's release in the states and after Roger Ebert interviewed Vincent Gallo, He gave it a 3 out of 4 stars.The problem is that the press hates Vincent Gallo, they think he is conceded and obnoxious and a jerk, but after they meet him and sit down for a one-on-one interview they find out that he is one of the smartest and coolest people on earth.His first indie breakthrough film ""Buffalo '66 was also  bashed at the cannes Film Festival and then later labeled as ""the best independent film of the last 10 years.""I really hope that Vincent Gallo continues his career in Directing because he really is a genius and there is no one else in this world like him.I also hope that this DVD includes the full unedited version(with commentary) that was shown at Cannes because I have yet to see that version.",5,"FINALLY, This masterpiece will be Released in the US!!",1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,1579,"['Almost', 'year', 'US', 'launch', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'Gallo', 'Bud', 'Clay', 'Motorcycle', 'racer', 'who', 'countryto', 'next', 'race', 'find', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'Daisy', 'way', 'women', 'share', 'same', 'pain', 'When', 'finally', 'California', 'get', 'witness', 'best', 'film', 'making', 'not', 'talking', 'explicit', 'oral', 'scene', 'movie', 'famous', 'American', 'Cinema', 'History.Vincent', 'Gallo', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'one', 'films', 'heavily', 'bashed', 'opening', 'then', '5-10', 'years', 'later', 'looked', 'back', 'masterpiece.The', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'worst', 'film', 'history', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'then', 'release', 'states', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'interviewed', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'gave', '3', '4', 'stars.The', 'problem', 'press', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'think', 'conceded', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'meet', 'sit', 'down', 'one-on-one', 'interview', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'smartest', 'coolest', 'people', 'earth.His', 'first', 'indie', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'Buffalo', ""'66"", 'was', 'also', 'bashed', 'cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'then', 'later', 'labeled', 'best', 'independent', 'film', 'last', '10', 'years', 'really', 'hope', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'career', 'Directing', 'really', 'genius', 'one', 'else', 'world', 'him.I', 'also', 'hope', 'DVD', 'full', 'unedited', 'version', 'commentary', 'was', 'shown', 'Cannes', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'version']",The Brown Bunny

For crying out loud, when we say performance, baby, you got to PERFORM.  This is what has been missing from art all of these decades, real make-believe realism.The rest of Vincent Gallo's film is from the Gus Van Sant school of ""watching paint dry"" cinema.  Introduced in the 60's by Andy Warhol, who filmed a man sleeping all night and also focused a stationary camera trained on the Empire State Building for a full day,  these cinematic exercises in tedium had actual idiots sitting through their entire 8 or 12 hour presentations.  I suppose they thought it was art.  Well, Gus and Vincent seem to be attracting the same type of intellect.So, if your idea of entertainment, or enlightenment even, is to watch a gloomy narcissist endlessly driving across country, with intermittent inane encounters; if you deplore actual dialogue with purpose, characters with depth, and a dramatic strucure that illuminates artistic intent and insight; if you prefer the cinema of turning on a camera and letting it run, this is the flick for you.For the curious, ninety percent of the film is this boring drivel of shooting out the windshield as Gallo drives, or motorcycle races, or dumb mumbling with vapid women, and Vince doesn't get his k shine until the last 10 or 20 minutes of the film, so you can skip ahead if that's what you want.

913944,ATC2WM08ZF9C1,B0009VRHLK,book worm,"[11, 15]","This movie has a lot of moments that can make the viewer feel awkward or uncomfortable, with very slow pacing and, especially towards the end, with material that seems more [...] (I don't think it could have possibly been a real body part, by the way). One starts to wonder what is this all leading up to? This movie, however, needs to be seen in its entirety and then all of its parts will make sense, nothing is really done without reason; only then will the viewer realize what a masterpiece it is.It is kind of like a retelling of Huckleberry Finn, the plot consisting of nothing more than a journey, except in this film, with the loss of childhood innocence. It is interesting to note that when the young Bud and Daisy first made their way to the wonders of California, escaping the drudgery of their life in rural Buffalo, NY, they really ended up in the same place from where they started, back to suburbia hell, except this time with palm trees and smaller houses. One can also look at this movie as a retelling of the Great Gatsby, as well.Pay close attention to the different narrative styles. Throughout much of the film, Vincent Gallo's character is telling his story, which is really more narrated to himself than to an audience; the filming is very choppy and at times out of focus or some of the action is actually off-screen (so much so that it makes you think that Gallo just set up the camera and is actually doing all the filming himself). There's not a whole lot of talking, as he travels from one motor bike race to another. He seems almost lost, even though he knows the route. At the end of the film, when he meets up with Daisy and they talk together, for the first time we see Vincent Gallo's character and much of the action  in clear focus in the full frame and there's more of a dialogue. Gallo has done an excellent and thoughful way of presenting the characters, by portraying inner and personal dialogues, feelings, thoughts, emotions that all go on inside the person versus an outside perspective, how one appears to others from the outside, that can still be revealing about a person.I thought the female actreses were all great, especially Cheryl Tiegs and Chloe Sevigny. Gallo uses the ""flower"" girls/women cleverly to represent the different stages of Daisy's life, and yet shows that as a person, Daisy is irreplacable.Gallo has made an incredible film, exploring an area of life most directors wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, and yet affects us all, or at least some aspects of it.",5,Ingenious,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2524,"['movie', 'lot', 'moments', 'can', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'very', 'slow', 'pacing', 'especially', 'end', 'material', 'more', '[', ']', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'real', 'body', 'part', 'way', 'One', 'wonder', 'what', 'leading', 'up', 'movie', 'however', 'be', 'seen', 'entirety', 'then', 'parts', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'nothing', 'really', 'done', 'reason', 'only', 'then', 'will', 'viewer', 'realize', 'what', 'masterpiece', 'kind', 'retelling', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'plot', 'consisting', 'nothing', 'more', 'journey', 'film', 'loss', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'interesting', 'note', 'when', 'young', 'Bud', 'Daisy', 'first', 'made', 'way', 'wonders', 'California', 'escaping', 'drudgery', 'life', 'rural', 'Buffalo', 'NY', 'really', 'ended', 'up', 'same', 'place', 'where', 'started', 'back', 'suburbia', 'hell', 'time', 'palm', 'trees', 'smaller', 'houses', 'One', 'can', 'also', 'look', 'movie', 'retelling', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'well.Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'different', 'narrative', 'styles', 'Throughout', 'much', 'film', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'character', 'telling', 'story', 'really', 'more', 'narrated', 'audience', 'filming', 'very', 'choppy', 'times', 'focus', 'action', 'actually', 'off-screen', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'Gallo', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'camera', 'actually', 'doing', 'filming', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'talking', 'one', 'motor', 'bike', 'race', 'almost', 'lost', 'even', 'route', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'up', 'Daisy', 'talk', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'character', 'much', 'action', 'clear', 'focus', 'full', 'frame', 'more', 'dialogue', 'Gallo', 'done', 'excellent', 'thoughful', 'way', 'presenting', 'characters', 'portraying', 'inner', 'personal', 'dialogues', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'go', 'person', 'outside', 'perspective', 'how', 'one', 'others', 'outside', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'revealing', 'person.I', 'thought', 'female', 'actreses', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'Cheryl', 'Tiegs', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Gallo', 'flower', 'girls/women', 'cleverly', 'represent', 'different', 'stages', 'Daisy', 'life', 'yet', 'person', 'Daisy', 'irreplacable.Gallo', 'made', 'incredible', 'film', 'exploring', 'area', 'life', 'most', 'directors', 'would', ""n't"", 'touch', 'ten', 'foot', 'pole', 'yet', 'affects', 'least', 'aspects']",The Brown Bunny
913945,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B0009VRHLK,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[14, 18]","Warning: This review may contain some spoilers for the uninitiated.For those readers remotely familiar with Vincent Gallo's Buffalo 66, I need not really say much to pat the man on his back. Buffalo '66 film had layers of dark humor, lots of heart, & quirkiness to make us fall in love with his craft.Gallo returns with a another love story of sorts but there is really no dark humor or quirkiness here whatsoever. This time around he introduces us to a lonely, lost soul by the name of Bud Clay traveling solo on the highway after just finishing a bike race. Along the way back to California, he meets three different women who all appear to be lacking what it seems he longs for. Love.In between the meetings of these three unique women, we see many long shots of driving while hearing rather somber music while often iinclude shots of rain which prolong this deep feeling of sadness that our protagonist can't seem to shake.Thus, Brown Bunny is essentially a lugubrious ballad placed on film about the journeys we sometimes make only to find that we can never go back to what we once had. Gallo shows us how much we really want to have hope even though our heart has all but convinced us that there is literally no hope to be found.Contrary to what reviewers have written, Brown Bunny is a very soft if not slow moving film with very tender scenes much like some of the moments in Buffalo '66. Although the ending will burn you for a long time, the film does have a tremendously huge heart & the ideas Gallo presents here will stay with you long after the final frame.Brown Bunny itself has two basic meanings although I'm sure each viewer will pick up something totally different. Bud Clay's girlfriend left a pet bunny with her mother when she moved to California & never came back for it. My interpretation: Bud felt like he'd abandoned his love interest when she needed him the in the most crucial moments. Also, Clay had given his girlfriend a chocolate bunny for Easter which she had eaten completely (or so we learn through dialog) & thrown up shortly afterwards. In the most heartfelt dialogue between the two main characters , we learn that he kissed her anyway because he truly loved her even after she vomited.And now the part you've been waiting for. There is a very graphic oral sex scene at the end of the film (the last ten minutes to be exact) but I personally didn't feel this took anything away from the film. The ending was intended to be very dramatic, emotional, & raw.

It just shows Bud wallowing in his own loneliness and detachment as he travels across the country to his next race. You're left wondering what has left him so flustered. This stagnant narrative is actually a perfect setup, it all culminates in an ending that is so emotionally searing, so graphically shocking and sad, I'm still trying to recover.***SPOILERS***The end has an explicit oral sex scene performed by Chloe Sevigny. The Amazon editorial review labeled this graphic scene as completely unneccessary. I understand their opinion, but I think they might be overlooking a startling point.

So, The Brown Bunny is not terrible. But it is tedious and unfulfilling. Even after the almost 30 minute cut that separates the Cannes Film Festival version from this one, the movie still feels about 25 minutes too long.

913953,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0009VRHLK,Cubist,"[5, 7]","After the critical acclaim of Buffalo '66, there was a certain amount of anticipation for what its writer/director/star Vincent Gallo would do next. He responded with The Brown Bunny, a film that, to put it mildly, polarized critics and audiences at the Cannes Film Festival. It met with harsh criticism and cited by some as the worst film ever to be shown in competition. This was largely in response to the film's notorious ending with co-star Chloe Sevigny and Gallo that outraged many. The film's deliberately slow pacing also didn't endear it to audiences. Gallo, not one to back down from a fight, engaged Roger Ebert in a highly publicized war of words that got quite nasty. Now that the dust has settled and the film has been quietly released on DVD, people can see for themselves what the fuss was all about.Stylistically, Gallo favours long, static takes, often holding on a shot for as long as he feels is necessary. In some respects, it's a throwback to the minimalist cinema of Monte Hellman, specifically Two-Lane Blacktop with its judicious use of dialogue and no frills production values. Gallo certainly has an ear for the right piece of music for the right scene, like the sad, wistful music of Gordon Lightfoot (""Beautiful"") and Jackson C. Frank (""Milk & Honey"") playing over shots of the road to create a particular mood.It would be so easy to dismiss Gallo's film as a vanity project run amok. After all, he wrote, directed, edited, produced, shot and stars in it. The Brown Bunny lacks Buffalo '66's humour and this seems to be a conscious decision on Gallo's part. In every respect, this movie is the antithesis to anything Hollywood is producing. Like Gus Van Sant's Gerry, Gallo's film is a cinematic endurance test-can you watch a man drive around for close to 90 minutes with the occasional interaction with other people? Yet, there is a certain poetry to The Brown Bunny, a certain simple beauty in observing every day things, like someone eating dinner or shopping for a rabbit or just driving cross-country. There are no intense car chases that defy physics or CGI-generated worlds.",4,The complete antithesis to anything Hollywood is making,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,2112,"['critical', 'acclaim', 'Buffalo', ""'66"", 'was', 'certain', 'amount', 'anticipation', 'what', 'writer/director/star', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'would', 'do', 'next', 'responded', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'film', 'put', 'mildly', 'polarized', 'critics', 'audiences', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'met', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'cited', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'be', 'shown', 'competition', 'was', 'largely', 'response', 'film', 'notorious', 'ending', 'co-star', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Gallo', 'outraged', 'many', 'film', 'deliberately', 'slow', 'pacing', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'endear', 'audiences', 'Gallo', 'not', 'one', 'back', 'down', 'fight', 'engaged', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'highly', 'publicized', 'war', 'words', 'got', 'quite', 'nasty', 'Now', 'dust', 'settled', 'film', 'been', 'quietly', 'released', 'DVD', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about.Stylistically', 'Gallo', 'long', 'static', 'often', 'holding', 'shot', 'as', 'long', 'necessary', 'respects', 'throwback', 'minimalist', 'cinema', 'Monte', 'Hellman', 'specifically', 'Two-Lane', 'Blacktop', 'judicious', 'use', 'dialogue', 'frills', 'production', 'values', 'Gallo', 'certainly', 'ear', 'right', 'piece', 'music', 'right', 'scene', 'sad', 'wistful', 'music', 'Gordon', 'Lightfoot', 'Beautiful', 'Jackson', 'C.', 'Frank', 'Milk', 'Honey', 'playing', 'shots', 'road', 'create', 'particular', 'mood.It', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'Gallo', 'film', 'vanity', 'project', 'run', 'amok', 'wrote', 'directed', 'edited', 'produced', 'shot', 'stars', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'Buffalo', ""'66"", 'humour', 'be', 'conscious', 'decision', 'Gallo', 'part', 'respect', 'movie', 'antithesis', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'producing', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Gerry', 'Gallo', 'film', 'cinematic', 'endurance', 'test-can', 'watch', 'man', 'drive', 'close', '90', 'minutes', 'occasional', 'interaction', 'other', 'people', 'Yet', 'certain', 'poetry', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'certain', 'simple', 'beauty', 'observing', 'day', 'things', 'someone', 'eating', 'dinner', 'shopping', 'rabbit', 'just', 'driving', 'cross-country', 'are', 'intense', 'car', 'chases', 'defy', 'physics', 'CGI-generated', 'worlds']",The Brown Bunny
913954,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,B0009VRHLK,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[1, 2]","by Dane Youssef""THE BROWN BUNNY"" plays out like an Andy Warhol-inspired exercise that was warped into a vanity project. It's like a home movie on a family road trip where nothing is really going on and whoever has the camera is just killing time out of boredomSome moments are quietly effective and inspire little musings in our heads. But far too much feels like something little that a brown bunny left behind... that's also brown.Either the bunny or Gallo. He serves as writer, director, producer, composer and cinematographer. I think there's more, but I just don't have time.The film stars Gallo as Bud Clay, a professional motorcycle racer going on one big long odyssey on the road to his old haunts to rediscover himself.He will uncover a lot of things along the way, particularly that he is trapped inside a movie that just plain isn't very good.Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" is a self-indulgent exercise in futility. Although Gallo may consider this a compliment, I mean the making of the film itself, not this hero's story. So masturbatory, I actually wished I was blind before I was even 1/4 of the way through.But it could have been. If Gallo had cut more of the scenes (and I don't just mean a few), put some music down on the soundtrack, shown more of the beautiful outdoor landscapes... and less of the interior of the car, Gallo himself just sitting there, preening. Striking a model-like pose in long, long, unbroken shots that feel endless.Like they're a half-hour long. Gallo is a strikingly good-looking European man, but not nearly so that we can watch him for that long without getting itchy and restless.You kind of wish the filmmaker (and there's only one--Gallo himself) had conjured up more music and put it on the soundtrack. Some more music might have helped pump up a lot stillborn scenes.My description of the the first 3/4's of the film torturous boredom doesn't even begin to do it justice. Gallo keeps the entire ""Brown Bunny"" moving at the pace of moss growing on a tree or rock.There's a lot of flat, still dialouge with a lot of dramatic pauses (in a pathetic attempt to pump it up), the acting isn't much (except for Gallo and Sevigny) and the long, unbroken static shots with Gallo is staring off into the distance (which there are more than TOO MUCH of) inspired me to itch so much, I thought I came down with a horrible rash.Hell, at one point, I actually wanted to throw things right at the screen. No lie, it actually came to mind--I would rather see some of the lowest points of ""Howard The Duck"" than look at Gallo's god dammed face for three more seconds.Yes, that's how bad it got.I know that the cut of the movie that was screened at Cannes (the film was not finished yet, but Gallo was pushed into releasing it) was indefinitely worse. But although I think that much of the editing was for the better (from what I've heard, it was vital), Gallo still needed to cut a few more scenes out of the movie and lay some more music here and there.Despite talent on Gallo's part and some ambition to tell a worthwhile story, ""Brown Bunny"" moves at the pace of moss growing, no one throughout the film as a character is particularly intriguing or well-developed, not even Gallo's own character (the exception is Chloe Sevigny) and there are too many slow spot where we're just waiting for something, anything to happen.We don't have any idea exactly what Bud is thinking most of the time (or God help us, Gallo even). Maybe we're supposed to figure it out for ourselves. Perhaps Gallo wants our minds to speculate and wander. Is he leaving the thoughts of this odyssey up to our imagination? Or did he just not think this one through.I was often bored and shifting back-and-forth in my seat, all throughout (except for the ending). I thought the movie needed more scenes of dialouge, more moments where Bud and those he encounters on his journey interact.Also, much of the dialouge throughout every scene throughout the film was written is so badly recorded, I couldn't understand a word they were saying. I had to turn on the SUBTITLES just to understand what the hell they were saying.I'm capable of appreciating a deep, slow-paced movie. But this one isn't just slow, it's d.o.a.Many European filmmakers know how to make a slow movie work like a chess match or a staring contest, so that even when nothing is happening, it FEELS like Hell itself is breaking loose. Gallo obviously hasn't mastered that himself. He should have seen more of their work and studied it before putting ""The Brown Bunny"" into effect.The late, great Stanley Kubrick himself defined and cornered the market on quietly brooding, suspenseful films. I would suggest Gallo pop in some of HIS movies in if he ever wants to make another movie in this vein.But Gallo himself has admitted he is no filmmaker--or artist. In any sense of the word. He is a hustler. A Midnight Cowboy of sorts. He has acted, modeled, directed, wrote, painted... have I painted enough of a picture myself?He is a man of innumerable talents. But he has no major. He hawks his skills to whatever at any given moment. He may not be a household name, but those that do know his name... look at him as something a little more than mortal.Ted Curson, Jackson C. Frank, Vincent Gallo are credited for the musical score. At least Gallo admitted he needed some outside help there.Reformed supermodel Cheryl Diggs doesn't really provide anything else but filler to kill the static. Hey, maybe she serves a vital purpose after all.Chloe Sevigny (""Kids"" and ""Trees Lounge"") is such a good actress and has such a touching character, it's a damn crime against cinema she doesn't have more scenes. She should have been such a more sustantial part of the film. She is a part of the fourth act where the comatose ""Brown Bunny"" almost bursts to life.At the end of it all, there is the smallest ray of hope. Not just for Gallo's character, but for Gallo. And us. And his film. And what of that brown bunny that sits in the cage? That holds the film's prominent title? What of it? What's it's story?I would have loved to see this world through it's eyes.

913959,A2XFE5V76H6JMD,B0009VRHLK,Flubjub,"[32, 42]","Yes, well, of course most people don't like this movie. If people don't realize by now that Brown Bunny is aimed at a limited audience--especially after all the hullabaloos (hullabali?) raised by this film--I don't know what to say about the movie-viewing public. The following are the facts of the matter; let them serve as either a warning or invitation to prospective viewers.(1) The film is (materially) uneventful. By this, I mean that nothing much ""happens"" as far as dialogue, events, or otherwise obvious Hollywood razzmatazz. There are no car chases, explosions, fist fights, cute romantic foibles, jokes, sight gags, or secret government plots. What there is, is a lot of driving--of a van, across the U.S. There are minor, nearly wordless encounters scattered around, but the film is predominantly a mood piece, meditative, allusive, cathartic, evocative... If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then by all means save yourself the hassle and avoid this film like the plague. But to all those who think this is nth degree in a director's self-indulgence, this movie doesn't even come close. See a movie like Goodbye Dragon Inn or, for that matter, any of the major Taiwanese directors, and then you'll see a slow movie! (But not necessarily a bad one, however.)(2) The movie is brutally depressing. If you make it all the way through (and many will not), you'll unlikely be whistling a merry ditty or feeling particularly chipper. It is certainly not a feel-good movie; in fact, it might qualify as a feel-very-bad movie, which I prefer anyway. A lot of people complain about depressing movies--they would rather watch something light and diverting. But here's the discrepancy: this isn't the cinematic version of Muzak, here to pacify the populace; it is art--which may (fear or fears!) be distressing at times. Life's like that. Get used to it. We have more than enough ""entertainment"" around to neutralize us into thoughtless zombies... pop music, magazines, TV, sports, and (ahem) the internet, just to name a few.(3) Okay, here's another doozy, and this is the reason the movie has gotten any public notoriety whatsoever. There is an actual sex scene containing actual oral sex (apparently anyway) between Vincent Gallo and Chloe Sevigny. But, if you are visiting this page, you probably already know this. After all, why would 95% of people be visiting this page? If you are thinking of watching this film for the erotic factor, skip it. There are countless adult films better formulated to satisfy your needs. This scene is hardly what I would consider titillating. It's more sad, in a way. And, no, Chloe Sevigny hasn't destroyed her career by doing this, nor has she made an especially bad choice. (Notice that not many people accuse Vincent Gallo of destroying his career by doing the same thing. But of course many people strongly dislike Vincent Gallo anyway. I myself don't like his right-wing politics, but I still love this film.)Okay, those are the three main obstacles preventing most casual viewers from ""enjoying"" (is that even the right word?) this film. If one or more of them seems unappealing to you, then save yourself the ninety minutes. It's as simple as that.It was very appealing to me, however, and I imagine that some other people out in the world will find this film as important, moving, and meaningful as I have.",5,Maybe even 6 out of 5 stars.

I'd say it is much better than hundreds of one star reviews on the Netflix movie's site lead you to believe. I personally agree with Vienalle Film Festival that awarded to ""The Brown Bunny""  FIPRESCI Prize ""For its bold exploration of yearning and grief and for its radical departure from dominant tendencies in current American filmmaking"". In  exploring loss, regrets, yearning, grief, loneliness, inner numbness as the way to cope with pain caused by guilt, longing for the contact and inability to communicate, Vincent Gallo, writer/director/star/cinematographer/editor for ""The Brown Bunny"", definitely drove his point across (no pun intended). I think that Gallo found the right way to create a mood of quiet and unbearable desperation. The movie brought to my mind the line from one of the poems by  Paul Verlen, French poet of the 18th century, ""I walked, accompanying my own grief"".  Grief was the passenger in Bud's van and kept him company on the long journey across America, from New Hampshire to California. They had a lot to talk about but their conversations were speechless - that's why there is so much silence in the movie and only shots of Bud's face and his eyes.Many viewers (and reviewers) mention in their comments the notorious explicit scene of oral sex between Bud Clay (Gallo) and Daisy (Chloe Sevigny), the one true love of his life. Those who dismissed the movie as totally worthless say that without the scene, nobody would every bother watching ""The Brown Bunny"". I would not speak for everyone but I would've liked the film even without two minutes of graphic sex  that in the context of the film is appropriately more disturbing and sad than anything else. With all due respect to the opinions of the viewers who dislike and even hate Vincent Gallo's movie, I found it interesting, compelling and satisfying.",4,Journey across America with Grief on the passenger sit,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,2190,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Director', 'cut', 'film', 'had', 'created', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'press', 'screening', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'prompted', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'make', 'statement', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'was', 'worst', 'film', 'history', 'festival', '92', 'minutes', 'long', 'version', 'Gallo', 're-edited', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', ""'d"", 'say', 'much', 'better', 'hundreds', 'one', 'star', 'Netflix', 'movie', 'site', 'lead', 'believe', 'personally', 'agree', 'Vienalle', 'Film', 'Festival', 'awarded', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'FIPRESCI', 'Prize', 'bold', 'exploration', 'yearning', 'grief', 'radical', 'departure', 'dominant', 'tendencies', 'current', 'American', 'filmmaking', 'exploring', 'loss', 'regrets', 'yearning', 'grief', 'loneliness', 'inner', 'numbness', 'way', 'cope', 'pain', 'caused', 'guilt', 'longing', 'contact', 'inability', 'communicate', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'writer/director/star/cinematographer/editor', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'definitely', 'drove', 'point', 'pun', 'intended', 'think', 'Gallo', 'found', 'right', 'way', 'create', 'mood', 'quiet', 'unbearable', 'desperation', 'movie', 'brought', 'mind', 'line', 'one', 'poems', 'Paul', 'Verlen', 'French', 'poet', '18th', 'century', 'walked', 'accompanying', 'own', 'grief', 'Grief', 'was', 'passenger', 'Bud', 'van', 'kept', 'company', 'long', 'journey', 'America', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'California', 'had', 'lot', 'talk', 'conversations', 'were', 'speechless', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'silence', 'movie', 'only', 'shots', 'Bud', 'face', 'eyes.Many', 'viewers', 'reviewers', 'mention', 'comments', 'notorious', 'explicit', 'scene', 'oral', 'sex', 'Bud', 'Clay', 'Gallo', 'Daisy', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'life', 'who', 'dismissed', 'movie', 'totally', 'worthless', 'say', 'scene', 'nobody', 'would', 'bother', 'watching', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'would', 'not', 'speak', 'everyone', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'film', 'even', 'two', 'minutes', 'graphic', 'sex', 'context', 'film', 'appropriately', 'more', 'disturbing', 'sad', 'anything', 'else', 'due', 'respect', 'opinions', 'viewers', 'who', 'dislike', 'even', 'hate', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'movie', 'found', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'satisfying']",The Brown Bunny

Graphic yes, but if you've ever seen a porno in your life it's not much of a big deal. I found her desciption of being abused by some other men more disturbing.

It is also at this late date of this 90 minute film that that you find out what has been ailing the morose Bud Clay all along. He is mourning the lost of the love of his life Daisy (Chloe Sevigny), certainly a respectable subject for any work of art. She gets resurrected, of course, to perform the sex on Clay.The actors to a person mumble-- if they talk at all-- the first 10 minutes or so of the movie are about a motorcycle race with no dialogue at all. In much of the movie we see the director/actor Vincent Gallo driving across the U. S. with shot after shot of a closeup of his profile that covers about 1/3 of the screen. Then we have a section where all we see are the windshield wipers against out-of-focus rain. The camera often jumps as well. Even in so-called ""art"" films, shouldn't whoever is shooting have the technical skills necessary to do a professional job? This movie reminds me of something an acquaintance showed me he had made in a beginning film class. I was embarrassed when I watched the film since he was so proud of his creation and expected compliments. About the only good thing about the entire movie is the soundtrack, particularly the song by Gordon Lighfoot.Supposedly because of negative reviews after this film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, Mr. Gallo edited it, thus producing a better Bunny.

Gallo is a one-of-a-kind actor/director, and I was early awaiting his latest offering on DVD, especially if it was sensationalist and scandalous.  If you check this movie out, be prepared for some veeeeeery slow action for 99% of the film.  We get many scenes of driving--driving at night, driving during the day, driving with a bug-splattered windshield, driving through small towns, driving past truckstops, driving in the mountains, and more.  You will definitely ""get it"" and feel like you are on an endless, monotonous car trip with no point.  My recommendation for surviving the driving scenes is to make judicious use of the ""skip ahead"" button once you've seen the first few minutes of driving.All of the action happens in the last 20 minutes of the movie.  There is a brilliant plot twist that actually comes close to making the film worth it, and there is the infamous *real* oral sex performed by Ms. Chloe Sevigney.  The scene is actually the climax of the movie, because the conversation they have during the interlude highlights everything going on in their relationship.All in all, I'm glad I saw this movie, if only because it was made famous by the insults traded back and forth between Gallo and Robert Ebert.

Not that the sex scene itself was good but knowing that when the sex scene comes on the screen, there is only ten minutes left of this awful film. I don't know what Vincent Gallo was smoking when he wrote this film but he needs to get a better supplier because this film is bad. There is hardly any dialogue in the film and what dialogue there is you can barely hear it. The film is mostly made up of camera shots of Gallo driving along the highway and along city streets. And the camera work is awful. There are lingering out of focus shots of nothing for extended periods of time.

913975,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0009VRHLK,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[21, 26]","This movie is hard for me to review. One of the hardest films I've ever written a review for in fact. I didn't notice Vincent Gallo until this film came out and I heard about the big Chloe Sevigny oral sex scene. I was intrigued and wanted to see this movie for a long time. Then I stumbled upon the movie 'Buffalo 66' and thought it showcased a talented filmmaker (Gallo)and someone with enormous potential. Buffalo 66 was a movie shrouded with mystery and left you questions. It showed you a story and gave no explanation for it. So when I finally bought 'The Brown Bunny' I knew it was going to be weird. Hell, this is the movie that Roger Ebert called the worst film in the history of the Cannes Film Festival. Although he later recanted this when Gallo re-edited the movie. Well, here is 'The Brown Bunny'. Written, Produced, Directed, Edited, and Shot by Vincent Gallo. Yes, he's even the Director of Photography. This movie is odd. It's unlike anything, even 'Buffalo 66'. All the shots in the movie are way too closeup or too far away or too grainy. But that's the look of the movie, so It's OK. That's the way the movie needed to look. Then there's the storyline. This film is 92 minutes long with very little dialouge. It's almost as if someone put a camera in someone's van and just let it film them as they drove across the country. Except, there's no radio in their van. There's nothing. This movie really is dull and seemingly uninspired; but that's what Gallo wants it to be. It's not a just a movie showing us a lonely guy...It wants us to feel his loneliness. Gallo plays Bud Clay, whom we meet as he competes in a motorcycle race which he loses. He gets in his van, with the bike in the back and drives. He stops at a gas station and meets an attendant named Violet. He tells Violet he's going to California. She mentions that she's always wanted to go to California. He says ""go with me"". She says ""I don't know you"". He says ""go with me"".Then she's in the car. He leaves her at her house and continues to drive.He eventually meets a woman named Lilly. Well, kind of...He doesn't meet her. He sees her sitting on a bench looking as lonely as he does, so he sits next to her. Then he gets back in his car and drives. This is pretty much how the film goes until 75 minutes in, Bud ends up at the motel to see the love of his life Daisy (Sevigny) and we've all heard a thousand times what happens at this point. A lot of people, especially viewers but a lot of critics too, see this movie as a film maker who thought he was making a masterpiece who instead makes a boring, slow, ridiculous movie. This movie is boring, there's barely even a plot. But, as I said, that's what Gallo wants it to be. Unlike 'Buffalo 66' our questions are answered at the end of the movie for the most part...But that doesn't mean we're given a resolution. Just an explanation. Bud is a lonely guy, suffering a devastating loss and if the movie continued to follow him we'd no doubt watch Bud Clay finally committ suicide. This movie is not for everyone. This movie is not a movie you rent Friday night, kick off your shoes with some popcorn and watch. This is an art-house film that takes some tolerance from the viewer. The fact is, the most powerful scenes of the movie occur in the last 15 minutes. During and after the oral sex scene. This is not just a pointless sex scene Gallo wanted to put in to intrigue people. This scene needs to be in here, in it we see the pain of a man.If the moments leading up to these final minutes had been more entertaining and less dull; a lot more people would like this movie. But, it's simply not so.So, yeah. I liked this movie. In the end it becomes a beautiful and poignant film. I'm not saying you'll like it or even agree with what I've said in this review. But, this is life, love, and loneliness told in the most painstaking boring way possible. It's Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"".GRADE: B+",4,"Not for Everyone, But an Interesting Vision",1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,3937,"['movie', 'hard', 'review', 'One', 'hardest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'written', 'review', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'film', 'came', 'heard', 'big', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'oral', 'sex', 'scene', 'was', 'intrigued', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'Then', 'stumbled', 'movie', '66', 'thought', 'showcased', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'Gallo', 'someone', 'enormous', 'potential', 'Buffalo', '66', 'was', 'movie', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'left', 'questions', 'showed', 'story', 'gave', 'explanation', 'when', 'finally', 'bought', ""'The"", 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'weird', 'Hell', 'movie', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'called', 'worst', 'film', 'history', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'later', 'recanted', 'when', 'Gallo', 're-edited', 'movie', 'Well', 'here', ""'The"", 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'Written', 'Produced', 'Directed', 'Edited', 'Shot', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'Yes', 'even', 'Director', 'Photography', 'movie', 'odd', 'anything', 'even', '66', 'shots', 'movie', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'closeup', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'too', 'grainy', 'look', 'movie', 'OK.', 'That', 'way', 'movie', 'needed', 'look', 'Then', 'storyline', 'film', '92', 'minutes', 'long', 'very', 'little', 'dialouge', 'almost', 'someone', 'put', 'camera', 'someone', 'van', 'just', 'let', 'film', 'drove', 'country', 'radio', 'van', 'nothing', 'movie', 'really', 'dull', 'seemingly', 'uninspired', 'what', 'Gallo', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'showing', 'lonely', 'guy', 'feel', 'loneliness', 'Gallo', 'Bud', 'Clay', 'whom', 'meet', 'motorcycle', 'race', 'van', 'bike', 'back', 'drives', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'named', 'Violet', 'Violet', 'going', 'California', 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'California', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'go', 'car', 'house', 'drive.He', 'eventually', 'woman', 'named', 'Lilly', 'Well', 'kind', ""n't"", 'meet', 'sitting', 'bench', 'looking', 'as', 'lonely', 'next', 'Then', 'back', 'car', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'film', '75', 'minutes', 'Bud', 'up', 'motel', 'see', 'love', 'life', 'Daisy', 'Sevigny', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'thousand', 'what', 'point', 'lot', 'people', 'especially', 'viewers', 'lot', 'critics', 'too', 'see', 'movie', 'film', 'maker', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'making', 'masterpiece', 'who', 'instead', 'boring', 'slow', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'movie', 'boring', 'barely', 'even', 'plot', 'said', 'what', 'Gallo', 'be', '66', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'end', 'movie', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'re"", 'given', 'resolution', 'Just', 'explanation', 'Bud', 'lonely', 'guy', 'suffering', 'devastating', 'loss', 'movie', 'continued', 'follow', ""'d"", 'doubt', 'watch', 'Bud', 'Clay', 'finally', 'committ', 'suicide', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'rent', 'Friday', 'night', 'kick', 'off', 'shoes', 'popcorn', 'watch', 'art-house', 'film', 'tolerance', 'viewer', 'fact', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'occur', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'oral', 'sex', 'scene', 'not', 'just', 'pointless', 'sex', 'scene', 'Gallo', 'wanted', 'put', 'intrigue', 'people', 'scene', 'be', 'here', 'see', 'pain', 'man.If', 'moments', 'leading', 'up', 'final', 'minutes', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'less', 'dull', 'lot', 'more', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'simply', 'not', 'so.So', 'yeah', 'liked', 'movie', 'end', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'ll"", 'like', 'even', 'agree', 'what', ""'ve"", 'said', 'review', 'life', 'love', 'loneliness', 'told', 'most', 'painstaking', 'boring', 'way', 'possible', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'Brown', 'Bunny', '.GRADE', 'B+']",The Brown Bunny

913980,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009VRHLK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 14]","I suspect most people end up viewing ""The Brown Bunny"" because of the controversy surrounding it, because writer-director-actor Vincent Gallo's 2003 film is not exactly the sort of film you are going to stumble across.  If you are a fan of Chlo Sevigny or Cheryl Tiegs that might be the case, but given how earnestly the promotion of this film courts the controversy that will almost invariably be the conduit by which most people come to see it.  The teaser trailer has the scathing line from ""Entertainment Weekly"" that ""No one in America will ever see a frame of this film,"" shows us only Gallo in profile driving his van, lists the main actors, and then fades to white with the final enticement ""ADULTS ONLY.""  The other, second, trailer should be avoided because it gives away the twist at the end of the movie and what is the point of having a twist if you see it coming?  Rethinking the movie in terms of that new knowledge is a retroactive experience, or something that should be reserved for a second viewing, and not anything that should spoil the first viewing.However, the controversy that is being stoked is somewhat disingenuous at this point because after the disastrous screening of ""The Brown Bunny"" at Cannes, which initiated the angry exchange between Gallo and the critic Roger Ebert, the director re-edited his film and cut out 26 minutes of the film.  So this version is not the original version, and apparently everyone who has seen both versions (including Ebert) finds this version to be superior.  One choice example can explain why: when Gallo's character, motorbike racer Bud Clay visits the Bonneville Salt Flats he takes out his bike and rides off into the distance.  Originally there was a shot of him coming back as well, which could well produce a laugh at the rather pointlessness of the exercise.  See Bud go.  See Bud come back.  But by simply letting Bud disappear in the distance before resuming his cross-country trek gives the scene more weight.At the beginning of the film Bud finishes a motorcycle race, shot in long distance so that sometimes the sound fades away, and then decides to head for California to race.  Before he goes he does two things.  First, he persuades the young girl at the convenience store where he buys gas to come with him, only to abandon her when they stop at her house for her to pick up a few things.  Second, he visits an elderly couple and tries to get them to remember that he used to live next door.  Together these two scenes provide our initial oblique cues as to what this journey is about.  But it is hard to know if a character is running away or running towards something or someone if you do not know the reference point, and therein lies the maddening quality of watching this film.""The Brown Bunny"" is what I would most decidedly call an art film, based mainly on Gallo's preference for leaving the camera in place and letting action take place on the other side of the car window with the characters not always adequately captured by the frame.  However, this style matches the substance of the film, because these moments in Bud's trip across the country are neither clearly seen nor completely understood.  Consequently it is not surprising that many people would give up on watching the film because they find it to be so tedious, while others will look at the same thing and find it indulgent.I picked up on a key clue regarding the twist when Daisy (Savigny) appears in Bud's hotel room, but I did not see it coming and I have to say that it was more Gallo's performance at the end that bothered me that the sex or the final revelation.  He says so little for most of the film that when we finally get to the point where he talks he whispers and then he whines.  The former is unsettling once you understand what he is saying to Daisy and since the latter sets up a jarring contrast between their tones that reflects the dynamic.  So if a film intends to provoke an emotional response adn does so, that would speak to some level of success.Finally, is the sex scene gratuitous?  No, because throughout his journey Bud has essentially been saving himself for this moment.  Is the graphic depiction necessary?  I would argue yes, provided that it is indeed a prosthetic, because then I can see it as fitting into the twist.  If not, then it is an example of gross indulgence.  Despite the claims of some that it was real I think the fact there is no difference between the before and after shots (which may be a telling clue in itself), and that Gallo avoids rendering the whole question moot by showing the point of connection, confirms my suspicions.  More importantly, if it is really real then it destroys the illusion Gallo works so hard to craft in the climactic scene of his film.

913981,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0009VRHLK,Linda Linguvic,"[6, 12]","This is an odd and haunting independent film, the brainchild of Vincent Gallo, who wrote it, directed it and stars in it.  He's saying something in this film, something that seems a bit distorted.  But he says it well and because of this, there is a discomfort in watching it.This is the story of Bud Clay, who we meet as he loses a motorcycle race in New Hampshire.  He puts his motorcycle in is van and then takes off for California, where he is scheduled to participate in another motorcycle race.  We ride with him in that van, long stretches of roads through middle America.  And we also feel his pain about something although it takes a while for us to understand that he is obsessed with the loss of his true love, Daisy.  Mr. Gallo could be called a homely man.  His features are craggy and awkward, his nose looks misshapen.  But he has deep and sorrowful eyes and his fine acting makes his character seem real.I understand the film has been cut from the original and now runs a mere 90 minutes or so.  This is good because even though there is not much action I was never bored as I watched this long journey.  Along the way he meets some women, but he just can't get over his love for Daisy.  And then, just as I thought that Daisy was a mirage and never existed at all, we meet her.  Chloe Sevigny plays this role and even though she is on screen for just a short time, she is wonderful.  There's a scene then that probably has caused this film to be banned in many places because it is extremely explicit and violates whatever censorship rules are usually in place.  And yet, it is sad and very real and necessary to the film.How it all turns out is not pleasant as I realized that the whole film was a mix of reality and fantasy.  I will probably never forget it.  I thought it was a small piece of art even  though it is too weird for the average viewer.  Some will be bored.  Some will be disgusted.  And many will be sad.  So don't bother with this film unless you're prepared for something very different with an overtone of melancholy.

Scene after scene of roadside travelogue with breaks of awkward interaction with people all makes sense in the last scene of the film.  A heck of a last scene it is too.  Yes, it has a graphic oral sex scene but it's really sad when you realize what haunts Bud (Vincent Gallo).  We discover that Bud's obsession with his old girlfriend carries deep emotional scars.  Apparently, she was an addict and not even being pregnant could curb her habit.  Bud's anger over this leads to an even more troubling event.  We see exactly what haunts Bud as he relives the moment when he's revisited by his old flame.  This version was heavily edited by Gallo from the original 102 minutes film festival version that caused such a sensation.  I gather the film was improved by this cutting and perhaps more editing would have made an even better film.  I get it, Bud did nothing when action was needed and now he prefers to squander the rest of his life without anything happening.  Or, he is so wounded that he cannot move past it and that makes for a very poignant moment.  But this brief flash of brilliance does not make up for the vastly dull and numbing travelogue provided beforehand.  Except for his random make-out sessions with lonely women (which is heartbreaking as he attempts to reconnect), everything else is mundane.  What's up with those drawn out close-ups of the back of Bud's head, or frames of just his ear, or countless other mind numbing moments?

It's notoriety surrounding an on-screen fellatio scene stunned (and disgusted some) audiences at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival that blacklisted it and the director. Gallo's war of words with Roger Ebert soon followed, giving 'The Brown Bunny' a tainted reputation. I'm never one to tell people who disagrees with an opinion on a film that they just don't get it.

Gallo superbly and powerfully captures the emotional state of sadness of a man on the run to no where with breathtaking scenes of the American highways.

But at times, the snail's pace lets the viewer absorb what is happening and digest it, letting the emotion of the movie bloom in full.The movie works best as a road trip film.  I enjoyed going across the country with Vincent in his van.When it came time for various characters to sit around talking to each other, I started to tune out.  None of the characters were nearly as interesting as the American landscape as seen from Vincent's van windows.  Yet the only dialog scene that brought the movie to a dead stop was the scene with the grandparents (and the title bunny).  It actually took awhile for me to get back into the movie after an eternity of sitting around the kitchen table with these elderly people who had nothing to say.  I wish this scene had been cut out entirely, or at least trimmed to a quarter of it's current length.I did enjoy the interaction with Daisy at the end of the movie.  And the controversial oral sex scene did not disrupt the film for me... it just seemed like what those two characters would do at that point in the story.  It did not de-rail the film and it was refreshingly honest.Though not really pulled off with a lot of filmmaking expertise, I did like what the final (flashback) scenes of THE BROWN BUNNY were trying to say.Gallo's DIY filmmaking is wonderfully daring, but I wish he would let others in on the process from time to time.  I appreciate the freedom he has as an artist, but perhaps surrounding himself with more crew would add more quality to his film.

913995,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B0009VRHLK,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[69, 81]","Since this movie is known most for the controversy, I am going to start and finish with it to reflect people's habit of starting and ending their impressions of something with a scene out of context. It wasn't porn, and my argument for that comes completely from the context... what happens directly before and after that moment. Basically, people have been angry at Gallo for being self-involved in this movie, especially that scene, but during that scene the self-involvement is literally the point. It's masturbatory, but the key is that it drains him, just like masturbation. One thing the DVD box says about it is that it's one of the ""frankest portrayals of male sexuality on film"" and so let's be frank here.His sexual confusion is part of his grief, and part of grief is the habit of trying to deny it actually happened. So when he starts acting dominant during that scene with what's happening, it's his subconscious trying to throw a sort of male sexual dominance over something he doesn't understand and hasn't allowed himself to accept. But when it drains him, he's forced to admit that he doesn't only grieve for her but hates her for forcing him into that grief, and from there comes probably one of the best conversations (or inner dialog) I've seen in film in a long time.But does it necessarily need to be ""shown"" rather than implied?Well yes. Because the character's focus is so involved on it, it literally is all his mind is allowing him to care about in that moment. Basic rule of a close-up: if the camera focuses on something like that, then the director is trying to point something out. If it's porn, it's meant to arouse... but this scene isn't arousing, especially because of its context.But enough of that, because I want to discuss something else about this movie. Partly because of the controversy around this movie, and partly because of the publicity, I had the initial impression that Gallo was an abrasive and over-masculinized character in this film. Wow, complete opposite... I totally related to his character. Of course, his short relationships with those women don't seem to work at first, but once we get an idea of where he's coming from in his grief (and men's general dislike of expressing it or asking for help), the relationships make perfect sense in terms of being representational (thus the obvious motif of all of their flower names and his name as ""Bud""). Basically, the first woman fits what he's looking for courteously, the second emotionally, and the third emotionally, but none of them match the full attraction he has to the only woman he's ever loved. I liked it.And the long continuing imagery of the road trip was really neat too, as it actually really captured that introspective feeling of it. Most roadtrip movies show the car in moments of time from the exterior... which kind of changes the perspective of what a roadtrip is. This movie shows it literally from the passenger seat, complete with the dirty/smudged window and the long road stretched ahead. I think there was only one shot that was actually an exterior of the van when on the freeway, the rest of the exteriors were when the van was parking or he was stopped somewhere. I find it very lovely, ultimately, and as my mother once said, ""The road trip is something of a rite of passage amongst American males. It's a moment when they take on as much of the world as they feel necessary all on their own."" Gallo seems to have the same idea, though there is a major American film genre built around that idea as well: the road as a literal transfiguration of self-discovery.So, going back to the controversy, it really disappoints me that this film has to be known for that when there is so much more art and beauty and innocence it has to offer. I also find the controversy rather inconsistant, considering most people have absolutely no trouble with the female body in various states of arousal, yet as soon as ""the male gender"" is shown, it's pornographic! The funny thing is, it contributes to that very male sense of fear and dominance they feel they must assert sexually. So I guess I could make an argument that Gallo did that scene to attack that inconsistant form of sexual censorship, but if I didn't already know that basically Sevigny and he agreed to do it because, ""Why not, we were in a relationship, we did it before, might as well just show it!""--PolarisDiB",5,An introspective film,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,4396,"['movie', 'known', 'most', 'controversy', 'am', 'going', 'start', 'finish', 'reflect', 'people', 'habit', 'starting', 'ending', 'impressions', 'something', 'scene', 'context', 'was', ""n't"", 'porn', 'argument', 'completely', 'context', 'what', 'directly', 'moment', 'Basically', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'angry', 'Gallo', 'being', 'self-involved', 'movie', 'especially', 'scene', 'self-involvement', 'literally', 'point', 'masturbatory', 'key', 'just', 'masturbation', 'One', 'thing', 'DVD', 'box', 'one', 'frankest', 'portrayals', 'male', 'sexuality', 'film', 'so', 'let', 'be', 'frank', 'here.His', 'sexual', 'confusion', 'part', 'grief', 'part', 'grief', 'habit', 'trying', 'deny', 'actually', 'happened', 'So', 'when', 'acting', 'dominant', 'scene', 'what', 'happening', 'subconscious', 'trying', 'throw', 'sort', 'male', 'sexual', 'dominance', 'something', ""n't"", 'understand', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'accept', 'when', 'forced', 'admit', ""n't"", 'only', 'grieve', 'forcing', 'grief', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'conversations', 'inner', 'dialog', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'long', 'time.But', 'necessarily', 'need', 'be', 'shown', 'rather', 'implied', 'Well', 'yes', 'character', 'focus', 'so', 'involved', 'literally', 'mind', 'allowing', 'care', 'moment', 'Basic', 'rule', 'close-up', 'camera', 'something', 'then', 'director', 'trying', 'point', 'something', 'out', 'porn', 'meant', 'arouse', 'scene', ""n't"", 'arousing', 'especially', 'context.But', 'enough', 'want', 'discuss', 'something', 'else', 'movie', 'Partly', 'controversy', 'movie', 'partly', 'publicity', 'had', 'initial', 'impression', 'Gallo', 'was', 'abrasive', 'over-masculinized', 'character', 'film', 'Wow', 'complete', 'opposite', 'totally', 'related', 'character', 'course', 'short', 'relationships', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'first', 'once', 'get', 'idea', 'where', 'coming', 'grief', 'men', 'general', 'dislike', 'expressing', 'asking', 'help', 'relationships', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'terms', 'being', 'representational', 'thus', 'obvious', 'motif', 'flower', 'names', 'name', 'Bud', 'Basically', 'first', 'woman', 'what', 'looking', 'courteously', 'second', 'emotionally', 'third', 'emotionally', 'none', 'match', 'full', 'attraction', 'only', 'woman', 'ever', 'loved', 'liked', 'it.And', 'long', 'continuing', 'imagery', 'road', 'trip', 'was', 'really', 'neat', 'too', 'actually', 'really', 'captured', 'introspective', 'feeling', 'Most', 'roadtrip', 'movies', 'show', 'car', 'moments', 'time', 'exterior', 'kind', 'changes', 'perspective', 'what', 'roadtrip', 'movie', 'literally', 'passenger', 'seat', 'complete', 'dirty/smudged', 'window', 'long', 'road', 'stretched', 'ahead', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'shot', 'was', 'actually', 'exterior', 'van', 'when', 'freeway', 'rest', 'exteriors', 'were', 'when', 'van', 'was', 'parking', 'was', 'stopped', 'somewhere', 'find', 'very', 'lovely', 'ultimately', 'mother', 'once', 'said', 'road', 'trip', 'something', 'rite', 'passage', 'amongst', 'American', 'males', 'moment', 'when', 'take', 'much', 'world', 'feel', 'necessary', 'own', 'Gallo', 'have', 'same', 'idea', 'major', 'American', 'film', 'genre', 'built', 'idea', 'as', 'well', 'road', 'literal', 'transfiguration', 'self-discovery.So', 'going', 'back', 'controversy', 'really', 'film', 'be', 'known', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'art', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'offer', 'also', 'find', 'controversy', 'rather', 'inconsistant', 'considering', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'absolutely', 'trouble', 'female', 'body', 'various', 'states', 'arousal', 'yet', 'as', 'soon', 'male', 'gender', 'shown', 'pornographic', 'funny', 'thing', 'very', 'male', 'sense', 'fear', 'dominance', 'feel', 'must', 'assert', 'sexually', 'guess', 'could', 'make', 'argument', 'Gallo', 'did', 'scene', 'attack', 'inconsistant', 'form', 'sexual', 'censorship', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'basically', 'Sevigny', 'agreed', 'do', 'Why', 'not', 'were', 'relationship', 'did', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'show', 'PolarisDiB']",The Brown Bunny

913998,AZVTZVW7RJX48,B0009VRHLK,"RHC ""TemporaryOne-1""","[6, 9]","The Brown Bunny is a radiant metaphorical film about the nebulous landscape of intimacy.The camera follows Bud Clay - a man of indeterminate age whose demeanor is heavily  imbued with sadness and insecurity - as he travels cross-country to reach California.Melancholy, haunting music, and smoldering, impressionistic images of cityscapes and  countryscapes during the dusk and nightfall convey to viewers the tangled emotions Clay is  tormented with as he finds his way to California.The further Bud drives forward towards California, into the future, the further back in time  Bud's mind and emotions travel as he relives painful memories of a young woman he once  loved; Bud is nostalgically reliving the same cross-country journey he once had with the young  woman in his memory, reliving all the emotions and twists and turns.Brief, tenuous encounters with three lonely, alienated women (who represent different aspects  of the woman he loved) further confuse Bud and hinder his ability to escape memories that  plunge him into a synthesized, emotionally arresting knot of anger and impassiveness and  resentment and emotionless.After Bud reaches California and enters a hotel room he once shared with the woman he  loved, we realize that Bud has been trying to break free of her memory by diminishing her and  her love: he has been trying to delegitimize her life and her love for him, and he has even  emasculated himself in order to justify his anger and resentment and confusedness towards  her, and to justify eliminating her memory.But in the afterglow, we know that Bud will never eliminate her memory, she will always be in his mind, his past actions (or lack thereof) will infinitely haunt him, the sum total of their acts will engulf him, and his mind will circuitously evolve around his memory in the same manner that the sun rises and the roads turn and the sun sets - ad infinitum.Magnificiant cinematography and use of desaturated colours, haunting soundtrack score  (Come Wander With Me, The Dying Song [which should have been played in the film]),  flawless acting and direction by Vincent Gallo, courageous choice by Chlo Sevigny; this film  is the pinnacle artpiece of Gallo's career and oneof the most underrated, underappreciated, and misunderstood films of the 21st century.",5,Your Beautiful Life For Me,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2299,"['Brown', 'Bunny', 'radiant', 'metaphorical', 'film', 'nebulous', 'landscape', 'intimacy.The', 'camera', 'Bud', 'Clay', 'man', 'indeterminate', 'age', 'demeanor', 'heavily', 'imbued', 'sadness', 'insecurity', 'cross-country', 'reach', 'California.Melancholy', 'haunting', 'music', 'smoldering', 'impressionistic', 'images', 'cityscapes', 'countryscapes', 'dusk', 'nightfall', 'convey', 'viewers', 'tangled', 'emotions', 'Clay', 'tormented', 'way', 'California.The', 'further', 'Bud', 'forward', 'towards', 'California', 'future', 'further', 'back', 'time', 'Bud', 'mind', 'emotions', 'travel', 'painful', 'memories', 'young', 'woman', 'once', 'loved', 'Bud', 'nostalgically', 'reliving', 'same', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'once', 'had', 'young', 'woman', 'memory', 'reliving', 'emotions', 'twists', 'turns.Brief', 'tenuous', 'encounters', 'three', 'lonely', 'alienated', 'women', 'who', 'represent', 'different', 'aspects', 'woman', 'loved', 'further', 'confuse', 'Bud', 'hinder', 'ability', 'escape', 'memories', 'plunge', 'synthesized', 'emotionally', 'arresting', 'knot', 'anger', 'impassiveness', 'resentment', 'emotionless.After', 'Bud', 'California', 'enters', 'hotel', 'room', 'once', 'shared', 'woman', 'loved', 'realize', 'Bud', 'been', 'trying', 'break', 'free', 'memory', 'diminishing', 'love', 'been', 'trying', 'delegitimize', 'life', 'love', 'even', 'emasculated', 'order', 'justify', 'anger', 'resentment', 'confusedness', 'justify', 'eliminating', 'memory.But', 'afterglow', 'know', 'Bud', 'will', 'never', 'eliminate', 'memory', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'mind', 'past', 'actions', 'lack', 'thereof', 'will', 'infinitely', 'haunt', 'sum', 'total', 'acts', 'will', 'engulf', 'mind', 'will', 'circuitously', 'evolve', 'memory', 'same', 'manner', 'sun', 'rises', 'roads', 'turn', 'sun', 'ad', 'infinitum.Magnificiant', 'cinematography', 'use', 'desaturated', 'colours', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'Come', 'Wander', 'Me', 'Dying', 'Song', '[', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'film', ']', 'flawless', 'acting', 'direction', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'courageous', 'choice', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'film', 'pinnacle', 'artpiece', 'Gallo', 'career', 'oneof', 'most', 'underrated', 'underappreciated', 'misunderstood', 'films', '21st', 'century']",The Brown Bunny
913999,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0009VRHLK,RMurray847,"[54, 65]","Bud is sad.  The motor-cycle racer played by Vincent Gallo is carrying some sort of grief.  We know this because he spends a lot of time driving his van cross country and looking unhappy.  He conveys this unhappiness much of the time by rubbing his face in a way that demonstrates world-weariness.  Do we know WHY he's sad?  Nope, although we suspect pretty strongly it has to do with a girlfriend named Daisy.If you want to see a movie about a sad man...here you go.  We see the sad man put gas in his van.  We see him purchase a cola at a roadside rest-stop...putting in about 8 coins.  We get to see him drink a bit of it.  We get to see him take his motorcycle out of his van and ride in on the salt flats in Utah.  We even get to see him use a urinal and at one point...take a shower!!  The whole shower we get to experience...and it includes a LOT of face rubbing and pausing to look contemplative.My favorite scene involves Bud stopping at a little house in California.  He goes to the door and knocks on it.  He waits.  Knocks again.  Waits.  Looks in the window.  Waits.  The scene takes (no exaggeration) at least two minutes.  It tells us Bud can wait long past the time most of us would have given up.  That's how sad he is.Finally, near the end, Bud checks in to a hotel and we're led to understand that he may be visited by Daisy.  Sure enough, she shows up and they have some dialogue (which is very exciting, because up until now we've had five minutes of dialogue stretched across 70 minutes of film).  The dialogue allows us to learn some things about their relationship, and then we are able to see them kiss a lot and then Daisy (Chloe Sevigny) explicitly performs a sex act on Bud.  It is graphic and not faked.  It is also distinctly unappealing, because Bud berates Daisy throughout the act.  When it's over, we get to finally find out what the ""secret"" Bud has been carrying around is. And the secret, when we understand it, is squalid, sad, and deeply uninteresting.I hope you get some idea of the movie now before you run out to see it because you want to see two semi-well-known personalities engage in a sex act.  This curiosity factor aside, there is no GOOD reason to see the film.  It would only be to see for yourself just how bad a movie made by someone who actually knows how to make films can be.Don't believe the reviewers who say their ten year old brothers could do the same.  It takes a REAL ego to actually make some of the stuff that's on this film.  There's a scene with a truly sad looking Cheryl Tiegs that nearly made me want to weep for her, because she is so dreadfully abused as a performer.  Her part mostly consists of looking sad and then kissing Vincent Gallo for minutes on end because apparently he's just so darn irresistible.  Don't believe the people who claim the film is saying something about male relationships with women and that it is some expose of how men really feel.  It is simply a movie about a guy who is sad and feeling guilty and having a hard time dealing with it.  Rather than tell us his story (except in the last 10 minutes) or reveal something about grief and how it can affect others, it simply shows how a person who is sad would actually look sad and move in a slow manner to suggest sadness.It also shows a lot of boring countryside through a bug-splattered van window.  Minute after endless minute of that.And Gallo himself is supremely annoying.  He has a singularly unappealing, whiny voice.  In an early scene, he is exhorting a convenience store clerk to go with him to California.  The dialogue is:  ""Go with me to California.""  Pause ""Please.""  Pause  ""Please.""  Pause ""Please Go With me!""  He says this while staring intensely at her...so naturally she agrees to immediately throw away her life to leave with this complete stranger.  And the great thing is this...his voice sounds like Alvin Chipmunk whispering.  Imagine yourself throwing your life away for that!!!I hate this movie.  Chances are very, very good that you will too.

914000,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0009VRHLK,Robert I. Hedges,"[5, 9]","Chlo Sevigny is a very talented actress. What is she doing in this movie?I was given this DVD as a gift after I very foolishly gave Roger Ebert's latest book, ""Your Movie Sucks,"" to a fellow film buff. Ebert and Gallo had extremely heated exchanges about this film, which Ebert loathed. Ebert was right to loathe it, and apparently this is a more streamlined, better edited, version than the viewers at Cannes had to endure. I pity the French.The story concerns Gallo as motorcycle racer Bud Clay, as he drives in a van from one coast to the other. Of the 93 minute running time, probably a good 70 minutes are nothing but shots of the road taken from the van. There is one exciting scene in which we get to see Gallo take his bike out of the van and run it at high speed across the Bonneville Salt Flats. While that would ordinarily be boring, it livens up this movie. Gallo is haunted by an anguished relationship with Daisy, the love of his life, played by Sevigny. The actual resolution of the disparate plot points at the end of the movie partially redeems the film, although the controversial scene immediately preceding that wrap up, which evidently involves a stand in (of sorts) for Gallo, isn't worth all the fuss. By that point I was just screaming ""End...End!"" in futility at the television.Along his journey, Gallo meets three other women, Violet, Lilly, and Rose. Nothing furthering the plot happens with any of these women, they are there simply to demonstrate Gallo's generalized angst about romantic relationships, and possibly to demonstrate his love of horticulture given their obvious floral monikers. (I'm sure it is no coincidence that Gallo's character name is Bud, an immature flower...) I thought the women were all quite good in their roles. Sevigny was strong as Daisy, Cheryl Tiegs is good as a silent lost soul at a rest stop, and Anna Vareschi was great as Violet, the gas station attendant. I thought that Mary Morasky as Daisy's mother was excellent and provided just the right amount of pathos in a difficult scene.This excremental movie is amongst the most boring things ever made. I didn't so much hate this movie as I was relentlessly bored by it. It is oddly framed (how many close-ups of Gallo's ungroomed sideburns do we really need?), in dire need of severe editing, and generally amateurish in every respect except for the acting in the female roles. The final ten minutes do provide some thematic enlightenment, but by then it's too late to save.I have learned two lessons from this movie. First, if Roger Ebert says that something is awful, pay close attention; second, I really should be careful who I send Ebert's books to.",1,Does Gallo Need A Psychiatrist Or A Florist?,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,2668,"['Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'What', 'doing', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'DVD', 'gift', 'very', 'foolishly', 'gave', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'latest', 'book', 'Movie', 'Sucks', 'fellow', 'film', 'buff', 'Ebert', 'Gallo', 'had', 'extremely', 'heated', 'exchanges', 'film', 'Ebert', 'loathed', 'Ebert', 'was', 'right', 'loathe', 'apparently', 'more', 'streamlined', 'better', 'edited', 'version', 'viewers', 'Cannes', 'had', 'endure', 'pity', 'French.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Gallo', 'motorcycle', 'racer', 'Bud', 'Clay', 'van', 'one', 'coast', 'other', '93', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'probably', 'good', '70', 'minutes', 'are', 'nothing', 'shots', 'road', 'taken', 'van', 'one', 'exciting', 'scene', 'get', 'see', 'Gallo', 'take', 'bike', 'van', 'run', 'high', 'speed', 'Bonneville', 'Salt', 'Flats', 'would', 'ordinarily', 'be', 'boring', 'up', 'movie', 'Gallo', 'haunted', 'anguished', 'relationship', 'Daisy', 'love', 'life', 'played', 'Sevigny', 'actual', 'resolution', 'disparate', 'plot', 'points', 'end', 'movie', 'partially', 'film', 'controversial', 'scene', 'immediately', 'preceding', 'wrap', 'up', 'evidently', 'stand', 'sorts', 'Gallo', ""n't"", 'worth', 'fuss', 'point', 'was', 'just', 'screaming', 'End', 'End', 'futility', 'television.Along', 'journey', 'Gallo', 'meets', 'three', 'other', 'women', 'Violet', 'Lilly', 'Rose', 'Nothing', 'furthering', 'plot', 'women', 'are', 'there', 'simply', 'demonstrate', 'Gallo', 'generalized', 'angst', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'possibly', 'demonstrate', 'love', 'horticulture', 'given', 'obvious', 'floral', 'monikers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'coincidence', 'Gallo', 'character', 'name', 'Bud', 'immature', 'flower', 'thought', 'women', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'roles', 'Sevigny', 'was', 'strong', 'Daisy', 'Cheryl', 'Tiegs', 'good', 'silent', 'lost', 'soul', 'rest', 'stop', 'Anna', 'Vareschi', 'was', 'great', 'Violet', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'thought', 'Mary', 'Morasky', 'Daisy', 'mother', 'was', 'excellent', 'provided', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'pathos', 'difficult', 'scene.This', 'excremental', 'movie', 'amongst', 'most', 'boring', 'things', 'ever', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'hate', 'movie', 'was', 'relentlessly', 'bored', 'oddly', 'framed', 'how', 'many', 'close-ups', 'Gallo', 'ungroomed', 'sideburns', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'dire', 'need', 'severe', 'editing', 'generally', 'amateurish', 'respect', 'acting', 'female', 'roles', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'do', 'provide', 'thematic', 'enlightenment', 'then', 'too', 'late', 'save.I', 'have', 'learned', 'two', 'lessons', 'movie', 'First', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'something', 'awful', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'second', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'careful', 'who', 'send', 'Ebert', 'books']",The Brown Bunny

Then there are movies like The Brown Bunny. It's one of those movies that everything within was telling me wasn't good, but yet I felt there was some pretentious urban coffeeshop connoiseur in a tight retro t-shirt and coke bottle glasses somewhere sniveling at the ignorance of people like me for not understanding the genius of this film.So I pondered it for a while and decided that, while there are certainly aspects to respect, in the over-simplified classification of good-or-bad, I still have to lean toward the bad.When done well, excessively long, silent shots can work very well to subtly further a story or emotion while drawing the viewer into its rhythm. I cite ""Goodbye Dragon Inn"" as an example. While I appreciated the desperation and loneliness conveyed by the lingering shots in Bunny, after a while I felt as though they had nothing more to convey, and they worked to the detriment of their initial impact.While I appreciated the twist of his ditching his first flower-named female while she was packing (preventing a predictable storyline to follow), as well as the inner turmoil evidenced throughout, I didn't ultimately feel as though the message of the movie was really profound enough to justify the plodding build-up to get to it - it didn't pay off for me.And as for the sex stuff at the end, I can't really believe people still make a big deal about seeing that stuff.

It's hard...","[2, 2]","I'll admit that I came to this film with a pretty heavy prejudice, having read a ton about it beforehand.  My overwhelming pre-viewing impression was that this was a screamingly indulgent film--hyped for its one crucial, highly aruably groundbreaking scene--so I struggled mightily to give it a fair shake.  In the end, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  Indulgent?  You betcha.  But that's just about a given for a true art film, and that's what you've got here.  Gallo is putting out some extremely personally meaningful art here, but the main problem is that I'm having trouble deciphering it.Good art makes you think, though, and I've been cogitating on this film's story and its characters for the past two days, and I've got to admit now that the story is entirely plausible, and very intriguing.  The payoff comes only in the final minutes, which retroactively recasts the entire film.  Watching it again knowing its secret seriously alters the intake of the preceding 90 minutes, but it still drags, quite a bit.I'll also admit to very frequent glancing at the DVD minute counter, wathcing it creep slowy to 92 minutes, so I could be done with it.  I don't remember the last movie I did this with...no wait, it was that wretchedThe Love Guru.Synopsis: Motorcycle racer Bud Clay drives his van from New Hampshire to Los Angeles as he struggles very, very deeply with loss, guilt, denial, his views and expectations of women, his past, his future, etc.  This poor guy really, really needs some professional help.I found little enjoyable about this movie, not even Sevigny's famous oral sex scene, as that notable part is really quite ugly and non-erotic.  It's some mighty powerful filmmaking, you betcha, but what exactly is the point?  I keep wondering how that scene developed from writing to script, to Gallo discussing it with and then convincing Sevigny that the scene truly was integral to the story and his artistic vision.  He managed to do that, obviously, although it escapes me how this very arguably brave (on both Gallo's and Sevigny's part) act of filmmaking is crucial to the story.This film is all about our central figure, Bud, played by writer/director/editor/producer Vincent Gallo.  He struck me as a cross between Woody Harrelson, with that jutting cro-magnon profile and the sunken eyes and searching, melancholy allure of Viggo Mortensen, but with the eyes a bit more sunken, just on the wrong side of normal-looking.  Bud looks downright greasy in every single shot.  We do get to see him shower, thankfully, but he comes out with his hair all gnarly once again, and he puts on stained clothing.Kissing is a big deal in this film, and he does a lot of it, with a few different ladies.  But, the endless, groping face-pawing during the kissing was massively distractive, with Gallo's big ol' hands and just about creepy-long fingers.  Both Bud and the girls just pawed each other's faces constantly, like they were petting--blech.And what of this brown bunny, then?  Early on Bud drops in to visit Daisy's parents, and Bud is either at the wrong house, they don't know what's happened, or they're in just as much denial about the ugly truth as he is.  Later Daisy talks about eating a giant chocolate bunny...well, that's a brown bunny, too, so what is the crucial meaning that has it titling the film?  Beats the hell out of me.Bottom line: this is a movie that I really didn't enjoy watching, but now having thought about it for a few days and taking another look, am slowing warming to.  It was slow, visually dull and repetitive, and ultimately very, very unhappy.  The main reason I can think of to recommend watching this film is so that if and when it ever comes up in conversation, you can say that you have, in fact, seen it.",3,"A Deep, Indulgent, Often Plodding Art Film",1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,3780,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'came', 'film', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'prejudice', 'having', 'read', 'ton', 'beforehand', 'overwhelming', 'pre-viewing', 'impression', 'was', 'was', 'screamingly', 'indulgent', 'film', 'hyped', 'one', 'crucial', 'highly', 'aruably', 'groundbreaking', 'scene', 'so', 'struggled', 'mightily', 'give', 'fair', 'shake', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Indulgent', 'betcha', 'just', 'given', 'true', 'art', 'film', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'here', 'Gallo', 'putting', 'out', 'extremely', 'personally', 'meaningful', 'art', 'here', 'main', 'problem', ""'m"", 'having', 'trouble', 'deciphering', 'it.Good', 'art', 'think', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cogitating', 'film', 'story', 'characters', 'past', 'two', 'days', ""'ve"", 'got', 'admit', 'now', 'story', 'entirely', 'plausible', 'very', 'intriguing', 'payoff', 'only', 'final', 'minutes', 'retroactively', 'entire', 'film', 'Watching', 'again', 'knowing', 'secret', 'seriously', 'intake', 'preceding', '90', 'minutes', 'still', 'quite', 'bit.I', ""'ll"", 'also', 'admit', 'very', 'frequent', 'glancing', 'DVD', 'minute', 'counter', 'wathcing', 'creep', 'slowy', '92', 'minutes', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'movie', 'did', 'wait', 'was', 'wretchedThe', 'Love', 'Guru.Synopsis', 'Motorcycle', 'racer', 'Bud', 'Clay', 'van', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'very', 'very', 'deeply', 'loss', 'guilt', 'denial', 'views', 'expectations', 'women', 'past', 'future', 'etc', 'poor', 'guy', 'really', 'really', 'professional', 'help.I', 'found', 'little', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'Sevigny', 'famous', 'oral', 'sex', 'scene', 'notable', 'part', 'really', 'quite', 'ugly', 'non-erotic', 'mighty', 'powerful', 'filmmaking', 'betcha', 'what', 'exactly', 'point', 'keep', 'wondering', 'how', 'scene', 'developed', 'writing', 'script', 'Gallo', 'discussing', 'then', 'convincing', 'Sevigny', 'scene', 'truly', 'was', 'integral', 'story', 'artistic', 'vision', 'managed', 'do', 'obviously', 'how', 'very', 'arguably', 'brave', 'Gallo', 'Sevigny', 'part', 'act', 'filmmaking', 'crucial', 'story.This', 'film', 'central', 'figure', 'Bud', 'played', 'writer/director/editor/producer', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'struck', 'cross', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'jutting', 'cro-magnon', 'profile', 'sunken', 'eyes', 'searching', 'melancholy', 'allure', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'eyes', 'bit', 'more', 'sunken', 'just', 'wrong', 'side', 'normal-looking', 'Bud', 'downright', 'greasy', 'single', 'shot', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'shower', 'thankfully', 'out', 'hair', 'gnarly', 'once', 'again', 'stained', 'clothing.Kissing', 'big', 'deal', 'film', 'lot', 'few', 'different', 'ladies', 'endless', 'groping', 'face-pawing', 'kissing', 'was', 'massively', 'distractive', 'Gallo', 'big', 'ol', 'hands', 'just', 'creepy-long', 'fingers', 'Bud', 'girls', 'just', 'pawed', 'other', 'constantly', 'were', 'petting', 'blech.And', 'what', 'brown', 'bunny', 'then', 'Early', 'Bud', 'drops', 'visit', 'Daisy', 'parents', 'Bud', 'either', 'wrong', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', ""'re"", 'just', 'much', 'denial', 'ugly', 'truth', 'Later', 'Daisy', 'talks', 'eating', 'giant', 'chocolate', 'bunny', 'well', 'brown', 'bunny', 'too', 'what', 'crucial', 'meaning', 'titling', 'film', 'hell', 'me.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'now', 'having', 'thought', 'few', 'days', 'taking', 'look', 'am', 'slowing', 'warming', 'was', 'slow', 'visually', 'dull', 'repetitive', 'ultimately', 'very', 'very', 'unhappy', 'main', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'so', 'when', 'ever', 'up', 'conversation', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'fact', 'seen']",The Brown Bunny

Imagine that kind of movie, only with the eventful 'van washing' sequence removed. What's left amounts to: shots of the highway set to folk music, vince gallo riding a motorcycle, vince gallo visiting a pet shop, laughable scenes between vince gallo and some women, and the infamous and graphic ending. Keep in mind that the highway shots appear between all other sequences.Firstly, I really didn't mind those highway bits - at first. In general I liked the music in this movie and the highway shots were fairly nice, but they might work better projected onto a wall in your house while you're doing something else. Something like the film equivalent of ambient music.Secondly, the movie is excrutiatingly boring. I can't stress that enough. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate long movies, or subtle ones, but this is too much. You can only watch Vince Gallo bury his face in his hands so many times...Thirdly, no matter what you read by Roger Ebert, the ending IS graphic and excessive. I'm not a prude and I think Tipper Gore is an idiot - but I did not need to see Chloe Sevigny give Vince full service. It doesn't serve the 'plot' either.Lastly, once you see the ending (in which Vince Gallo's acting is a bit whiny and weak), the rest of the film makes sense and you ALMOST want to forgive it.

914014,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,B0009VRHLK,Tristan,"[1, 1]","It has taken me eight years to be able to even begin to embrace this film. I've disliked this film immensely for the past several years, and when I re-watched it recently to be able to properly write this review, I dragged my feet on the ground until I wore a hole in my shoe. My sister warned me it was awful, but I didn't heed her warning. The first time I ever saw it was when it came out on DVD. It was unavailable at most video stores, and the ones that did carry it tended to always have their copies rented out, and most other stores just stuck it in the ADULT section. Being underage, that would've made renting it out from those stores impossible, so I ended up just buying the DVD from a local Borders. I was about sixteen years old at the time, but luckily I knew the clerk who sold it to me. He was (and still very much is) a queer like me who knew I was always on the prowl for challenging films with intense subject matter. I also knew that he hated this film but really was eager to know what I thought about it. I had seen Buffalo '66 prior to this and loved it, and I was already familiar with Vincent Gallo as an actor with films like The Funeral and Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trickbaby. When I sat down and watched The Brown Bunny, I was completely put off by Gallo apparently just like most moviegoers who saw the picture tended to be. The Brown Bunny is an infuriating experience, full of awkward scenarios of uncomfortable and, frankly, inhuman behavior that resembles the worst and the most banal aspects of everyday reality. I remember telling my Borders friend exactly those words. Oh boy did I hate this film. Sitting through it was so difficult for me, in fact, that I ended up injuring my right shoulder due to how much I was cringing and squirming throughout. I had to remove all of my clothing because the picture was making me feel like I was about to have an anxiety attack. If there is one thing that I can safely say about The Brown Bunny, it's among one of the most difficult films to actively sit through. If you're going into it thinking it'll JUST be a meditative, hypnotic experience that puts a microscope above everyday human behavior, prepare to be greatly disappointed. This film is deliberately pessimistic, angry, creepy, and emotionally and staggeringly hateful. Just about the only kind words to say about it is that its more light-hearted and more entertaining than Gus Van Sant's Gerry. This was my reaction the first time I viewed The Brown Bunny.Since 2005, when I first viewed The Brown Bunny, I have watched the picture six times. That's five more times than I've seen Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. To put that into a more honest perspective, I've seen Atom Egoyan's Felicia's Journey roughly around twelve or thirteen times, all of these viewing in the span of a good two years when I was utterly obsessed with the movie. I've watched the William Hurt film The King about eighteen times total. I've attempted to watch Gosford Park about ten different times. I still haven't finished it. The point is, I love to re-watch strange art films that are difficult to swallow. The stranger the better. I can hardly wait to re-watch Wendy and Lucy, which to me is a similarly troubling film that I reacted very similarly to as I did The Brown Bunny. The Brown Bunny is one film that I have a difficult time re-watching. I've only ever watched it by myself, which is honestly probably the best way to watch it I feel. Every time I've watched it, it puts me through the emotional ringer. There's nothing that makes me more uncomfortable than emotional dysfunction, I've come to realize upon my latest re-watch. The Brown Bunny is not only a film about that, but it also explores it in what could be the most horrific way to explore material like this. Each time I've viewed this film, I've appreciated it slightly more and more. The first time I viewed this film, obviously as you can tell from above, I hated every aspect of it. Couldn't even begin to appreciate any element or scene of it. To me, it was just one big embarrassment. I refuse to call the picture a vanity project. A vanity project implies that the end result holds some sort of beauty, whether subjective or objective, and I don't even think defenders of this film can say that the subject matter or the imagery of this film isn't ugly. It's beautifully shot, sure, and it's beautifully presented, but do the ideas hold any kind of beauty to them? I don't know, I guess it depends on the person. The second time I watched it, I found the finale of the picture itself to be rewarding, but the fact that it takes place at the end of such an agonizing and humiliating experience of a film somehow made it feel futile to even begin to try and embrace. The third time I watched it, I was struck a lot more by the weight of the circumstances of the main character, Bud, who spends the whole movie driving his truck, occasionally stopping to re-visit and speak to acquaintances, drive his motorcycle, and have bizarre and cruel interactions with random females, before ultimately confronting an old girlfriend of his played by Chl&ouml;e Sevigny.The forth and fifth time, I found myself enjoying more and more of the hypnotic imagery. The sixth time, I found the combination of long, meditative shots and intense emotional quality to be more interesting, but couldn't get past the dry atmosphere. The seventh time I watched it, I began to understand its darker elements a lot more, but was still put off by the sheer anger of the presentation. Now I've seen it again, back in late July of 2013. I am now starting to truly realize why I have such a difficult time with the picture, and why it is such a brilliant work of art. Make no mistake, the experience of The Brown Bunny is one that gets me shaking with fear, but now I can properly put into words what specifically makes it so off-putting and ugly. Vincent Gallo very much bared his heart and soul into this picture, and the reason why I initially rejected it is because I, along with many other men out there, have a deep personal fear of showing emotion and showing any sort of fragility. This is a film that explores the inherent weakness in men in the most personal way possible. It is a film that explores why masculinity will truly be the death of us all. I am ashamed to really say this, but as of writing this I am in my mid-twenties and I still sometimes feel like I've never grown up and am afraid that I never will. What does it mean to grow up? Who we have in this film is Bud, and I think the film makes it fairly obvious that he has not grown up nor does he have the mind of a typical adult. I think his behavior in this film is mostly childish, and he still very much shows a genuine fear of women through all the weird and disturbing behavior he exhibits throughout the story. He loved his ex-girlfriend Daisy (Chl&ouml;e Sevigny) so much because she represented someone who could actually take care of him and raise him like some kind of child still. He could act and behave like an adult, and even be in love with her and find her attractive and would even be willing to engage in sexual intercourse, but when it came to having a healthy relationship with no strings attached and no complications, he was a genuine failure. That's what makes the finale so heart pounding to me. He is completely lost and aimless in this world without another woman to take care of him. He is, I'm afraid, representative of many of the men out there. Many men haven't truly grown up and feel the need to have a woman in their life because they feel that's the only way that they can have any sort of guidance. Unfortunately, in the case of Bud, Daisy was a drug addict and was extremely self-destructive, and that's why this film is so troubling. We're watching a despicable man pursue an interaction with a woman who we all know is not healthy for him, and his understated obsession with her is what makes this film so deeply disturbing and difficult to sit through for me. I can think of hundreds of films that are all about the loneliness of the road and how much of a lie the American dream is, but I cannot think of as many films that are so damn bitter about it as this one is. If it were starring a woman and directed by a woman, critics and audiences would embrace it and celebrate it because that's what they expect. Here, the only thing that gets exploited in The Brown Bunny is Vincent Gallo himself. Even in the infamous hardcore blowjob scene, it is Sevigny who is very much in power and in control. Gallo spends the entire film laying bare everything that is physically wrong with himself. His large chin, his lanky frame, his high-pitched voice, his birdlike scowl, all are on display for about 75% of the film's runtime, and in the end he ultimately is exploring the idea of how it is the weakness of men and their libidos and their constant desire to adhere to tradition and dignity that has destroyed America the most. He presents this idea in the most non-elegant way possible. He paints a portrait of a man who cannot accept death or the idea of someone dying, and it is that kind of inability to move on that leads to the destruction of the human soul and the degradation of the human body.To make matters worse, Bud is a scumbag. The women he picks up throughout the film all look and appear angelic. I'll give you one example of how painful this film is. The first girl, a teenager, has a striking resemblance to many girls that I know and grew up with. She has simplistic facial features. She is one of the most realistic looking girls I've seen in film. Her facial features have an unusual kind of beauty to them. Bud, with his creepy facial features, gets her to fall in love with him by showing a vulnerable, scared side of himself. He plays a different character, essentially. Then he ditches her at her home after he convinces her to quit her job and run inside to get clothes for the road. The scene is one of the scariest scenes in the film, for you almost fear that she'll run out of her home and see Bud drive away. The look on her face, in your mind, will be a look of tragic disappointment and shame. Luckily, she doesn't come running out, however, her face continues to haunt you for you just know that she'll look upset and sad, and seeing such a cute face with such crushed disappointment is an uncomfortable and utterly maddening feeling. You start to wish she had so that you could at least have a look of disappointment that doesn't match the horror you picture in your mind. It's almost as if the sadness of the scene itself could never match the tragedy your mind conjures up. That is, I feel, where the true horror of the film lies. It's the Taxi Driver syndrome. The feeling of wishing to see graphic images so that you can take your mind off of the image in your head of a character you care about crying and having an emotional breakdown. As powerful as this film is, The Brown Bunny will always be an uncomfortable, awkward, and creepy experience and always will be. The Brown Bunny is basically the Merchant-Ivory version of The Passion of the Christ. Both could be viewed by some as pornographic pictures that exploit the men rather than the woman. The only difference is that The Passion is slightly more S&M-themed;.",3,"Hate it, but its slowly growing on me",1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,11336,"['taken', 'eight', 'years', 'be', 'able', 'even',

914015,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009VRHLK,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 7]","Written, directed, and produced by Gallo, `The Brown Bunny' not surprisingly stars Gallo himself. When a film is made this way, people would naturally think that the film is all about Gallo and his life. In brilliantly original `Buffalo 66' it worked. In `The Brown Bunny' it fails because of the now notorious love scene, which is not only pointless but shows Gallo's ego-tripping film-making.Gallo plays Bud Clay, a professional bike racer who is heading for California. In the rather lengthy opening scene, we see him riding a bike on the race course, making a circle again and again, suggesting the hero's never-ending search for something.For Bud, 'something' is Daisy his love. But we are not allowed to know anything about his and Daisy's past until the last 20 minutes. Instead, during the road movie style narrative, Bud keeps on driving, going to the west, occasionally meeting girls whose names are all those of flowers.And finally, the oral love scene with Daisy played by Chlo Sevigny. If you can find any meaning in this embarraing scene, (I mean, not in `love' but in 'oral'), please let me know. Explicit sex scenes (which I do not particularly dislike) often blur the other merits of the film, and this is exactly the case here. As you know, Gallo decided to cut the film by about 30 minutes after the debacle at Cannes Film Festival, but the sex scene remained in the film. What made Gallo include that part? Or what made Sevigny accept the role in the first place?For all its self-indulgence, I like certain part of the film. The film beautifully captures the bleak atmosphere of the roadside in America, and though you may not agree with me, I don't find Gallo's acting so awful. But that may be because I now come to think that Gallo is always playing himself, a coolest guy with sad eyes who knows he would never be in the mainstream, and if you like Gallo (like my cousin), you would not hate him whatever he does.Still, even avid fans of Gallo should admit that his recent films are not as good as pre-`Buffalo' era including amusing `Palookaville.'

Chloe Sevigny actually has a career, appearing in such films as ""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""American Psycho,"" ""Dogville"" and ""Shattered Glass."" She's now with Bill Murray in the indie ""Broken Flowers"" (2005), so she may have a chance. As for that ill-tempered rebel bad boy Vincent Gallo, he's solely to blame for the infinite boredom of this film. He's its star, director, writer, producer, editor, publicist and photographer.Gallo's adroitly cast 1998 indie ""Buffalo 66"" stirred some interest, but only that. Previously he had bits in a good film (""Goodfellas""), a bad one (""The House of the Spirits""), and a dozen you never heard of; he's now got three in the pipeline you also may never hear of. In any organized effort, after ""The Brown Bunny"" we never would expect to hear from him again. But independent moviemaking is disorganized. Anything can happen. And although nothing happens in ""The Brown Bunny,"" Gallo might yet resurrect himself.It's about a moody motorcycle racer driving a minivan to California. He's moody because of a life-traumatizing episode we learn about at the very end. Until then, he drives across America, rain or shine, on freeways and through towns. That's it. Sleeping, showering, pumping gas, buying Cokes or take-out, chatting with stray women, these are major events in this movie. In a motel room, Sevigny performs oral sex on him, a gratuitous but explicit act (no faking here) that is the film's real reason for existing and it's only excitement.And also its only suspense. Will the self-indulgent star of ""The Brown Bunny"" (how to phrase it?) rise to the occasion? Hey, it's cool. The writer, editor, publicist, photographer, producer and director all told him to stick to the script.

So, as I watched the final scene I felt a great deal of sentimental and physical electricity pouring from the television screen. It was quite visceral.

Now, I know I've avoided the sum of Gallo's work here (other reviewers here have ably handled that); quite simply, Chloe's act is demo material for any woman curious as to what looks hot while getting down.

I find it rather ironic, that Bud Clay loved Daisy despite the fact that she didn't make sense, and in the end he was haunted by her.In any case, the Brown Bunny is a film about a motorcycle racer who travels across country for his next race which happens to be in California, near where the love of his life, Daisy, lives. There is little more I can say about the film without giving away spoilers, for this is a film with a minimalist plot. Bud does meet some women across the way; women he is attracted to, yet, who are not Daisy.Many say that the Brown Bunny is junk, but it did a lot for me. Here goes...First, the scenes with Bud and the woman were some of the best man - woman interaction I have seen on film. With little to no words, I felt myself attracted to them. Gallo does a marvelous job of using the camera to convey attraction. Despite the quirkiness of the 3 flowers, Rose, Lilly and Violet, I found myself oddly attracted to them. This was due to the filmmaker and the acting between Gallo and said actresses. In these 3 minimalistic scenes, Gallo shows us everything that can be good about film romance, and everything that Hollywood is missing. Call it a lesson on chemistry, if you will.Second, the film felt familiar. It felt like my journey, and a journey I have taken. The journey built up suspense as to what Bud was up too, and in the end delivered. But more than that, the journey is familiar because each of us (or most of us) have had those confusing days where a relationship has wavered and we are trying to figure life out. Bud's journey is our journey, and the Brown Bunny, despite using little words, conveys that well. Those who have never had a dysfunctional or soul mate-gone-wrong relationship might think this point is silly.Third, the acting was brilliant. The immersion, off the scale. The intangibles were huge. Often the camera seemed to say a thousand words when the dialog said little. The silence spoke volumes. Sunsets, scenery and sadness.Lastly, I walked away from the film thinking and feeling. It made me think about love, and live, and those I have yearned for but lost. I went to bed a ball of mixed emotions. Few films do this.In the end, Brown Bunny is minimalistic with little dialog, but it is a movie well worth seeing. It makes you think, makes you feel, makes you wonder, and leaves  glad you watched the film, for better or for worse. Just like Bud Clay.I loved it. I hated it. I loved it. If you don't understand dysfunction, Bud Clay, or the movie, you won't understand why I say this.Total Score (out of 100) = 9047 (out of 50). Enjoyment.
