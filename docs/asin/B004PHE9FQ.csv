Also the characters (all of them) were shallow and boring.So, why did I give this movie 4 stars? It's the same story, only Loki isn't stupid and inconsistent.  Odin is still a slightly out of it pacifist who only fights when necessary - and we get to see him fight here.  The addition of dark elves was a nice touch.  The warriors three and Sif and the Valkiryie were stupid in both movies - for differing reasons.  And given Thors age, the plot makes a lot more sense, Thor is already showing signs of stoicism and wisdom, not just hot headed arrogance.  AND the movie is great for kids.

This takes place long before he becomes the superhero most of us know him as.This is also a brilliant piece of animated storytelling to boot.******  *********  ***********As someone who has bought and loved comics as a kid and more recently as a buyer of Alex Ross' ""graphic novels,"" THOR has always been an enigma for me.  I don't ever remember as a kid ANY issue of Thor where they talked about his background.  Every issue was an epic battle with Loki.  Those stories got old REAL quick.  After awhile, I only ran into Thor when he was with the Avengers.In THOR: TALES OF ASGARD, my many questions have been answered.  This is a phenomenal animated movie.  If you're familiar Nordic or Northern European folklore, many of the characterizations are present here.This film is not in any way like a take on a television animated, this has the feel of a Disney feature.  The concept was well thought out and each character/ community had very distinct personalities from the people of Asgard, to the Valkyries, to the Frost Giants.No superheroic, super powered feats, this is a story of a father and son and the boundaries that are crossed into manhood.For Thor, his rite of passage means to stow away aboard the ""Warriors Three"" ship in search of the magical Lost Sword of Sutur.  Along the way there's a bar fights, flying horses, trespassing on distant lands, long treks up glacial mountain tops, snow sprites and ferocious Frost sentries, leagues of Amazonian maiden warriors, a flaming sword, an avenging Dark Elf and armies marching upon the grounds of Asgard.I don't miss the Thor of the comic book pages, this is like an illustrated page from The Lord of The Rings with all of the pomp and adventure.In addition to this hour and fifteen minute movie is a fascinating documentary on the Making of.This is a great introduction to the comic book hero, but unfortunately it's so good that any other Thor has to be reworked in light of it.THOR: TALES OF ASGARD, 5 very, very big stars.",5,"Thor, Like You've Never Seen Him!

Yet, upon watching it in its' finished form, I have to say it was a rather enjoyable feature...despite the fact that Thor and Loki are just teenagers. At least, it was alot more enjoyable than Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow.The story tells of Thor, who's hungry for adventure, and his brother Loki hiding aboard The Warriors Three boat. They, along with The Warriors Three, look for the Sword of Surtur. What starts out harmless quickly turns deadly, as Thor must now prove himself worthy by saving Asgard itself.While I agree with Cindy White of IGN stating, ""When it comes to content made just for DVD, DC and Warner Bros. have consistently edged out Marvel with their series of original animated movies.""; I believe Lionsgate and Marvel Animation have upped their game with the story in Thor: Tales of Asgard.

I know quite a bit about the mythological one, but I've never really been into the comic books.So I went into ""Thor: Tales of Asgard"" with a fairly open mind. This cartoon is a pretty average for its first half (much coming-of-age-and-learning-responsibility plot), and the animation is not exactly great even at its best moments. But the plot is well handled, the characters are well written, and the climactic battle between Asgard, the Ice Giants, and a wild card with an unstoppable weapon.Teenage Thor is shocked when he's told that he only wins against Asgard's greatest warriors because they have to let him, and that nobody respects him. So after Odin forbids him to go out in search of adventure, he and his reluctant brother Loki stow away on the Three Heroes' ship. Their goal: To find the legendary sword of the Fire Giant Surta, lost in the frozen wastes of Jotunheim.Unfortunately, Odin soon discovers that not only have his sons left Asgard against his orders, but they're causing lots of mayhem wherever they go. And after finding the sword, Thor accidentally sparks off a war between Asgard and the Frost Giants, leading an army to lay siege to his home city. Now not only must the five travelers find a way home, but they must somehow avert a massive war -- and stop a deadly foe in their own number.""Thor: Tales of Asgard"" isn't the best comic book movie I've seen -- definitely not on the level of most Batman animated movies, or the Green Lantern ones. This is mainly because of the animation, which is very Saturday-morning cartoon. Simple forms, solid sheets of hair, very thick cylindrical calves, and angular figures, and pretty interchangeable faces (especially the women!).But the rest of it is actually pretty well done. Lots of flashy battle scenes, some clever foreshadowing (Loki's comfort with Jotunheim's weather), and some genuinely dramatic moments (Thor's horror at some of the Frost Giants actually getting KILLED). While the first half is fairly standard coming-of-age story, the second half has a very dramatic, epic feel, which is only added to by the formal language used in the script.However, there WERE a few things that confused me. For instance, who was that woman teaching magic to Loki at the beginning? It seems like she's going to be a corrupting influence on him, but... she never appears again.But they do give some very nice character development to Thor and Loki. One is brash, arrogant but good-hearted, and must be taught the true price of his actions; the other is intelligent and cautious, but has a definite dark streak hinting at what he will do someday.

1423609,A3ABSJBA8EHW34,B004PHE9FQ,Ellen P. Lafleche-christian,"[1, 1]","Thor: Tales of Asgard is all about Thor and Loki (his brother) as teenagers. Odin (their father) was grooming both boys to eventually compete to hold his throne. Loki is more into intellectual and magical pursuits while Thor is more into the fighting aspect of it all.One day, Thor is sparring with another warrior (a girl) and looses. Of course, being a boy and a teenager, he's pretty upset with this especially when she tells him that he isn't anywhere near as tough as he thinks he is because everyone is going easy on him because of who he is. Thor and Loki decide to go off and prove they can become real warriors by finding the Sword of Surtur. The Sword of Surtur is supposed to burn hot enough to kill frost giants. They follow Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun on their adventures and learn they aren't really what they're claiming to be and end up having to save Asgard themselves.I haven't seen the new Thor movie so I can't say how this fits in with it. But if you have kids who love Marvel comics or super hero type cartons, you need to see this one. It's a neat viewpoint to see Thor and Loki as teenagers instead of adults. Die hard Thor fans will probably be a bit put out seeing Thor with a sword instead of a hammer. I got quite the lecture from my husband who is a HUGE Marvel fan about there NOT being a sword before the hammer.Being a super hero cartoon, you have to expect some amount of violence so be careful if you plan on watching it with little children. The movie isn't rated at this point but I'd probably give it a PG. It's probably going to really appeal to the child/tween crowd more than older kids and adults who will probably more appreciate the feature film. It's a great way to let younger kids enjoy a Thor movie that's suitable for them while older kids/parents are enjoying the PG-13 feature film.",5,Before the hammer came the sword!

Alford,"[0, 0]","For the last of the Marvel Animation's movie line with Lionsgate, it was decided to do a story of the younger days of the Thunder God during his awkward teenage years. Slightly based on the Thor: Son Of Asgard comic book mini-series, this was originally supposed to come out around Fall 2009, but instead Lionsgate held onto it for a 1 1/2 years to coincide with the Thor live-action movie. The wait really shows though as the animation could've use a little glossing over as compared to the previous Marvel animated movies like Planet Hulk.Set possibly a few centuries ago, Thor realizes that all the matches he's has against the Asgardian honor guard were all rigged. Hoping to regain some bit of his street cred, Thor convinces his ""brother"" Loki to go with him and search for the fabled Sword of Surtur, which was used to defeat the Ice Giants in a war with the Dark Elves. The brothers stowaway on the flying ship of the Warriors Three, but instead of going to the realm of Jotunheim where the trio brag they've been too, they instead end up in a boarding house bar, where they all get into a fight with several other dieties. The presence of the Greek gods here was especially here. The five of them then sail to Jotunheim, and actually manage to find the Sword. It uncontrollably destroys two Ice Giant soldiers, and the heroes are on the run from the rest of the colossal fridges. They go to Thor's wouldbe girlfriend Sif who is training with the Valkyries, in an attempt to get some winged horses back to Asgard. All of them are captured by the misandric Brunhilde and her warrior women, but the Ice Giants interrupt them, which allows Thor and the others to escape with Sif. They encounter their ally Algrim, who was the last of the Dark Elves that was befriended by Thor's father Odin. Algrim takes the Sword, and unexpectedly betrays Thor. Algrim goes back to Asgard with the Sword, and confronts Odin, who he blames for not stopping the war between the Dark Elves and the Ice Giants, which lead to the destructionof his kind. Thor shows up back in Asgard, and stops Algrim, but Loki uses the Sword to barbecue Algrim, revealing a more darker edge to him. Thor then hands the Sword over to the Ice Giants in order to keep the peace between Jotunheim and Asgard.This movie was somewhat lacking in some of the more dynamic-styled animation of the earlier Marvel animated made-for-video movies. There is some reasonable action in this, although considering that it has viking, valkyries, giants, and werewolves, you'd expect a little more on the level of a Conan kind of flick.

""Thor: Tales of Asgard"" is an animated tale of mini-Thor (Matthew Wolf) before he became the Renaissance-festival spouting, opera-dressing, hammer-wielding Norse god we've all come to know and love.The first thing fans will notice is the wide-eyed, clean animation of ""Tales of Asgard.""  The colors are vibrant, the details few, and the movement just above being a choppy distraction.  This is the animation that you'll likely see on Saturday morning cartoons, but when one character claims that the only thing more frigid than Nilfheim is the land of the Valkyries it's clear this is meant for a PG-13 audience. It's kind of like hearing a swear word come out of your twelve year old.The second is that this tales is firmly set in a fantasy realm, which essentially makes it like a session of Dungeons & Dragons. There's the sorcerer who's just learning to use his magic (Rick Gomez as Loki), the perpetually grumpy fighter (Paul Dobson as Hogun), the huge lover of mead and meal (resident dwarf-like character Volstagg played by Brent Chapman), and the lover of women (the bard role played by Alistair Abell as Fandral).  They're all lovable lunks in their own way - Loki's a weakling, the Warriors Three are carousing blowhards.  Then there's Sif (Tara Strong)Thor's rival in arms and affection, who finds offense in the Einherjar's deference to Thor in combat.  In short, Thor is a royal brat.When he realizes that everyone is catering to him, Thor decides to strike out on his own by capturing Surtur's sword, a flaming blade capable of leveling mountains.  He is pursued by Frost Giants, Odin's soldiers, and finally a drow named Algrim (Ron Halder).  With his long pointed ears and white hair it's clear that the dark elf is right at home in Thor's mythology.  That's right, ""Tales of Asgard"" is so D&D; it even features a dark elf!Thor rarely gets to use a hammer, a running joke through the film.

Tales of Asgard revolves around a young, arrogant Thor before he ever wields Mjolnir, and finds the young thunder god on a trek with his brother Loki, as well as The Warriors Three, to recover the Sword of Surtur before it falls into evil hands.  Things don't go so well naturally, and we're treated to some dynamite animation, action sequences, voice acting, and even a great musical score to boot.  What Tales of Asgard fails to do however is really hold your interest.  More often than not it feels like it drags on and on, which is far from a good thing when the feature length run time is only 70-some odd minutes.  That and the fact that this young Thor is very, very hard to like as well.

In this storyline, Thor & Loki explore the ups and downs of life as well as how to handle the power that they have as the sons of Odin.  The action in this video is intense & does not leave the viewer bored.  This movie would definitely be a great companion to the Thor movie in theaters too.
