793649,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00015HX5E,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","David Spade's signature apathetic sarcasm gets my funny-bone every time.  I find his comedic style hilarious.  I think it's the tone of his voice, the way each comment rolls out of his mouth with this tinge of arrogance that makes him one of the funniest comedians working today.  Even when his films are ridiculous and utterly pointless (which, honestly, a lot of his films are) he is still on point and delivers the goods.  In `Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star' he fails to disappoint yet again, serving up one hilarious gag after another.  While there are parts of `Dickie Roberts' that don't fit for me, as a whole I actually think this comedy works rather well.  Sure, Spade has a lot to do with that, but plot wise too; it's actually quite an interesting concept.The story is that of Dickie Roberts, you guessed it, a former child star.  Now all grown up and feeling the after effects of fame gone `bye-bye', Dickie strives to once again capture the hearts of the American public.  The only problem is that Dickie didn't have a normal childhood.  He was famous at a very young age, abandoned by his mother after his show was canceled and thus doesn't know what it's like to be a normal person.  That drawback makes it impossible for him to land any substantial parts because he can't play `normal'.  So, to fix this problem he does something so very un-normal and hires a family to `his' family so that he can get a feel of what it's like to be a normal kid.  That said family is the Finney's; George and Grace and their two kids Sam and Sally.It's apparent right off the bat that, while the Finney's are kind of storybook they still have some real problems; clich&eacute;d problems if you will.  George is a workaholic who has become disinterested in his wife; Grace is the kindhearted `golden' mother, the kind that Dickie didn't have; Sam is the nerdy kid who's bullied at school and Sally is the slightly obnoxious little girl who has a heart of gold.A lot of what happens in `Dickie Roberts' is predictable if not a little `out there' but it's all presented in a way that makes it easy and fun to swallow.  A lot of the gags are delivered effortlessly and are quite entertaining (the whole `demon rabbit' scene alone is worth the price of the DVD) and Spade is always one to keep his dialog (no matter how dense) fresh and funny (it's all about delivery).David Spade really understands Dickie mostly because I think there is a lot of Spade in Dickie.  Mary McCormack is beautiful and sincere as Grace, but there are some issues I have with her character (mainly the whole `Dickie likes Grace, Grace likes Dickie' thing).  She's the picture perfect mother, and she is one major clich&eacute;, but she makes it work the best she can.  Scott Terra and Jenna Boyd do a fine job playing typical kids, if not a little exaggerated and Craig Bierko is pretty good as the very unlikable father George.  Alyssa Milano is hilarious as Dickie's ex-girlfriend Cyndi and John Lovitz continues to get laughs as Dickie's hard working agent.The ending is very `Hollywood' but what else did you expect; you could guess the ending from watching the trailer.  I still give it a solid three, three and a half stars.  It serves up the laughs, plenty of them actually, and never grows stale.  With cameo's by a slew of former child stars not to mention some pretty famous faces, `Dickie Roberts' is funny, witty, entertaining and all around enjoyable.",3,"A little (ok, a lot) predictable but still delivers the laughs...",1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,3440,"['David', 'Spade', 'signature', 'apathetic', 'sarcasm', 'funny-bone', 'time', 'find', 'comedic', 'style', 'hilarious', 'think', 'tone', 'voice', 'way', 'comment', 'mouth', 'tinge', 'arrogance', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedians', 'working', 'today', 'Even', 'when', 'films', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'honestly', 'lot', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'point', 'goods', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'Former', 'Child', 'Star', 'disappoint', 'yet', 'again', 'serving', 'up', 'one', 'hilarious', 'gag', 'are', 'parts', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'whole', 'actually', 'think', 'comedy', 'rather', 'well', 'Sure', 'Spade', 'lot', 'do', 'plot', 'wise', 'too', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', 'concept.The', 'story', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'guessed', 'former', 'child', 'star', 'Now', 'grown', 'up', 'feeling', 'effects', 'fame', 'gone', 'bye-bye', 'Dickie', 'once', 'again', 'capture', 'hearts', 'American', 'public', 'only', 'problem', 'Dickie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'normal', 'childhood', 'was', 'famous', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'thus', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'be', 'normal', 'person', 'drawback', 'impossible', 'land', 'substantial', 'parts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'normal', 'So', 'fix', 'problem', 'something', 'so', 'very', 'un-normal', 'family', 'family', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'be', 'normal', 'kid', 'said', 'family', 'Finney', 'George', 'Grace', 'two', 'kids', 'Sam', 'Sally.It', 'apparent', 'right', 'bat', 'Finney', 'are', 'kind', 'storybook', 'still', 'have', 'real', 'problems', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'problems', 'will', 'George', 'workaholic', 'who', 'become', 'disinterested', 'wife', 'Grace', 'kindhearted', 'golden', 'mother', 'kind', 'Dickie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Sam', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'who', 'bullied', 'school', 'Sally', 'slightly', 'obnoxious', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'heart', 'gold.A', 'lot', 'what', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'predictable', 'not', 'little', 'there', 'presented', 'way', 'easy', 'fun', 'swallow', 'lot', 'gags', 'are', 'delivered', 'effortlessly', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'demon', 'rabbit', 'scene', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD', 'Spade', 'always', 'one', 'keep', 'dialog', 'matter', 'how', 'dense', 'fresh', 'funny', 'delivery', '.David', 'Spade', 'really', 'Dickie', 'mostly', 'think', 'lot', 'Spade', 'Dickie', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'beautiful', 'sincere', 'Grace', 'are', 'issues', 'have', 'character', 'mainly', 'whole', 'Dickie', 'Grace', 'Grace', 'Dickie', 'thing', 'picture', 'perfect', 'mother', 'one', 'major', 'clich', 'eacute', 'work', 'best', 'can', 'Scott', 'Terra', 'Jenna', 'Boyd', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'typical', 'kids', 'not', 'little', 'exaggerated', 'Craig', 'Bierko', 'pretty', 'good', 'very', 'unlikable', 'father', 'George', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'hilarious', 'Dickie', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Cyndi', 'John', 'Lovitz', 'get', 'laughs', 'Dickie', 'hard', 'working', 'agent.The', 'ending', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'what', 'else', 'did', 'expect', 'could', 'guess', 'ending', 'watching', 'trailer', 'still', 'give', 'solid', 'three', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'up', 'laughs', 'plenty', 'actually', 'never', 'grows', 'stale', 'cameo', 'slew', 'former', 'child', 'stars', 'not', 'mention', 'pretty', 'famous', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'funny', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'around', 'enjoyable']",Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star
793650,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00015HX5E,Austin Somlo,"[1, 7]","Viewed: 7/07Rate: 17/07: Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is one of the shallowest pictures I've seen. I don't know why David Spade is still being allowed to make movies. In my book, he is seriously one of the most despicable actors, and having to watch him play like an arrogant SOB, I'm getting ticked off further. Everybody, except for Rob Reiner, who did the movie is at the lowest point of their careers. Think of everybody. They all used to be somewhat famous, and they've reached the bottom of the toilet in Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. The movie per se has no story to begin with, is infested with bad messages, and spews out unintelligible lines. If Dickie Roberts wore those gloves for ten years or so, then his hands should have been infinitely white. How the film ended is per****ed and sick. It turned out to be the opposite, yet alike, of the Oedipus complex. Dickie decides to advertise and offer twenty grand to a family who will take him in and treat him like a kid. The family takes a gamble on him. It ends up with the mother and her two young kids watching over Dickie Roberts, who is probably at least 35 years old. He teaches profanity to the kids, nearly entices them to drink alcohol, and says things like, ""I want to bang your mother"" or ""I bet your mom is hot in bed."" In the end, he ends up marrying the mother after being predictably granted a divorce. The lead character is somebody I could care less than an ant. The story is drivel at best. It takes a five year old moron to think of the subplots because obviously they are done at one point or another in a variety of movies. The first thing that comes to my mind while watching Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is Going Overboard. Ironically, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star happens to be produced by Adam Sandler. Go figure. The former Who's the Boss? star Alyssa Milano...wow man, as anorexic as she looks, she is literally ready to be shrunken by the screen. The other person of worthy mention is Corey Feldman, who is also an arrogant SOB. He finally has been reduced to a joke. Boy, cheerleading has changed over the years. Possibly an eight year old girl gives an audition as if she is ready to become a future stripper. I am also surprised that the choreographer allowed her to do that. I wonder if the autobiography book of Dickie Roberts would have had any negative influence on the mother of two kids. If it doesn't, how shocking. Is that poker scene supposed to be a derivation from Sunset Boulevard where Norma Desmond played with Buster Keaton and the other two forgettable stars? The only part of the movie that I find a bit amusing is the bike stunts, especially the one where David Spade (or a stuntman) flipped the bike over a car, smashing the front windshield. The rest of the picture, the drowsy feel engulfs me. Sometimes, I feel seasick as if I am actually watching Going Overboard, and to the end, I squirm around a lot, praying for the end. It doesn't surprise me that the father is the most underdeveloped character of the movie, so Dickie Roberts can make his slimy moves towards to his wife without a resistance. Every time I say Dickie Roberts, I keep thinking Dickie Thon of the Philadelphia Phillies on Topps cards. Anyway, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is among the worst films I've seen because of its inappropriateness with poorly constructed plot and my inability to relate to the characters.",1,Disgusting.,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,3423,"['Viewed', '7/07Rate', '17/07', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'Former', 'Child', 'Star', 'one', 'shallowest', 'pictures', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'David', 'Spade', 'still', 'being', 'allowed', 'make', 'movies', 'book', 'seriously', 'one', 'most', 'despicable', 'actors', 'having', 'watch', 'play', 'arrogant', 'SOB', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ticked', 'off', 'further', 'Everybody', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'who', 'did', 'movie', 'lowest', 'point', 'careers', 'Think', 'everybody', 'used', 'be', 'somewhat', 'famous', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'bottom', 'toilet', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'Former', 'Child', 'Star', 'movie', 'se', 'story', 'begin', 'infested', 'bad', 'messages', 'out', 'unintelligible', 'lines', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'wore', 'gloves', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'then', 'hands', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'infinitely', 'white', 'How', 'film', 'ended', 'per****ed', 'sick', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'opposite', 'yet', 'alike', 'Oedipus', 'complex', 'Dickie', 'advertise', 'offer', 'twenty', 'grand', 'family', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'treat', 'kid', 'family', 'gamble', 'up', 'mother', 'two', 'young', 'kids', 'watching', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'who', 'probably', 'least', '35', 'years', 'old', 'profanity', 'kids', 'nearly', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'things', 'want', 'bang', 'mother', 'bet', 'mom', 'hot', 'bed', 'end', 'up', 'marrying', 'mother', 'being', 'predictably', 'granted', 'divorce', 'lead', 'character', 'somebody', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'ant', 'story', 'drivel', 'best', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'moron', 'think', 'subplots', 'obviously', 'are', 'done', 'one', 'point', 'variety', 'movies', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'watching', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'Former', 'Child', 'Star', 'Going', 'Overboard', 'Ironically', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'Former', 'Child', 'Star', 'be', 'produced', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Go', 'figure', 'former', 'Who', 'Boss', 'star', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'wow', 'man', 'as', 'anorexic', 'literally', 'ready', 'be', 'shrunken', 'screen', 'other', 'person', 'worthy', 'mention', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'who', 'also', 'arrogant', 'SOB', 'finally', 'been', 'reduced', 'joke', 'Boy', 'cheerleading', 'changed', 'years', 'Possibly', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'audition', 'ready', 'become', 'future', 'stripper', 'am', 'also', 'surprised', 'choreographer', 'allowed', 'do', 'wonder', 'autobiography', 'book', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'negative', 'influence', 'mother', 'two', 'kids', ""n't"", 'how', 'shocking', 'poker', 'scene', 'supposed', 'be', 'derivation', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'where', 'Norma', 'Desmond', 'played', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'other', 'two', 'forgettable', 'stars', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'find', 'bit', 'amusing', 'bike', 'stunts', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'David', 'Spade', 'stuntman', 'flipped', 'bike', 'car', 'smashing', 'front', 'windshield', 'rest', 'picture', 'drowsy', 'feel', 'Sometimes', 'feel', 'seasick', 'am', 'actually', 'watching', 'Going', 'Overboard', 'end', 'squirm', 'lot', 'praying', 'end', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'father', 'most', 'underdeveloped', 'character', 'movie', 'so', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'can', 'make', 'slimy', 'moves', 'towards', 'wife', 'resistance', 'time', 'say', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'keep', 'thinking', 'Dickie', 'Thon', 'Philadelphia', 'Phillies', 'Topps', 'cards', 'Anyway', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'Former', 'Child', 'Star', 'worst', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'inappropriateness', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'plot', 'inability', 'relate', 'characters']",Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star

793656,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00015HX5E,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[2, 2]","Sometimes it's okay to have a little fun. Sometimes it's okay to laugh and snort a little. But should you admit it to the world when the film is DICKIE ROBERTS FORMER CHILD STAR? I'm going to but that's only because I'm a tad bit brave and I sure time will tell and many will come to embrace this fun movie.Dickie Roberts (David Spade, The Adventures of Joe Dirt) was a former child star. At the age of 6 he had the whole world screaming ""This is Nucking Futz"" his signature line. After the show got cancelled poor Dickie was left out in the cold by everyone he loved. He grew up to be a valet at a trendy LA restaurant.Now Dickie wants more out of life and he thinks that begins with a role in a new Rob Reiner film. So to make a long story short he hires a family, to relive his childhood, so he can prepare for the role. This is when the fun and frivolity begins.DICKIE ROBERTS is the best thing that has come out of Happy Madison productions. It's smart and funny, and for the most part tries to keep the laughs coming. It's also the only Happy Madison film not to feature Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider. Hmm??What works in the film far outweighs what doesn't. I loved the celebrity-boxing match with Emmanuel Lewis; the stilt dance, and even the slip and slide scene. They all work, and make you laugh. Spade himself brings that lovable sarcasm and caustic wit to the screen. It's the best he's ever done, without Chris Farley.What doesn't work is that it gets incredibly bogged down with sentimentality. Who is the guy in Hollywood saying that these movies need all this fake drama? That the music needs swell, and lessons need to be learned? I just want a funny movie. DICKIE ROBERTS in not the worst offender, but it teeters pretty close to that line.Mary McCormack (Private Parts) is delightful as Grace, the mother with a heart of gold. She's the kind of actress that lights up screens and is vastly underrated. She has so much charisma and raw power. I wonder why Hollywood doesn't use her more. If I were a power player she's would be making 20 million and Julia Roberts would be a supporting player.Even the kids (Scott Terra and Erin Murphy) are pretty good. Murphy is far better than Terra but he has some really great scenes that work.I do question a scene in which a girl, who can't be more than ten, slinks around like a slut. I understand why the scene is in the movie. I just thought it was tacky and went on far too long. It's made everybody in my party squirm.But other than that, I recommend DICKIE ROBERTS for what it is. A fun movie, I also recommend you stay for the closing credits, you'll get to hear Marsha Brady well... I won't tell you. But the scene also shows Fred ""Rerun"" Perry getting down. Some of the best closing credit moments I've ever seen and it beats having to watch stupid outtakes.If you're in the mood for a little light fun DICKIE ROBERTS FORMER CHILD STAR is a good movie for you.***1/2 out of 5",4,Fun...FUN,1063065600,"09 9, 2003",2003,2943,"['Sometimes', 'okay', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'okay', 'laugh', 'snort', 'little', 'should', 'admit', 'world', 'when', 'film', 'DICKIE', 'ROBERTS', 'FORMER', 'CHILD', 'STAR', ""'m"", 'going', 'only', ""'m"", 'tad', 'bit', 'brave', 'sure', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'many', 'will', 'come', 'embrace', 'fun', 'movie.Dickie', 'Roberts', 'David', 'Spade', 'Adventures', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'was', 'former', 'child', 'star', 'age', '6', 'had', 'whole', 'world', 'screaming', 'Nucking', 'Futz', 'signature', 'line', 'show', 'got', 'cancelled', 'poor', 'Dickie', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'everyone', 'loved', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'valet', 'trendy', 'LA', 'restaurant.Now', 'Dickie', 'more', 'life', 'role', 'new', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'film', 'So', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'family', 'relive', 'childhood', 'can', 'prepare', 'role', 'when', 'fun', 'frivolity', 'begins.DICKIE', 'ROBERTS', 'best', 'thing', 'come', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'productions', 'smart', 'funny', 'most', 'part', 'tries', 'keep', 'laughs', 'coming', 'also', 'only', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'film', 'not', 'feature', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Hmm', 'What', 'film', 'far', 'what', ""n't"", 'loved', 'celebrity-boxing', 'match', 'Emmanuel', 'Lewis', 'stilt', 'dance', 'even', 'slip', 'slide', 'scene', 'work', 'make', 'laugh', 'Spade', 'lovable', 'sarcasm', 'caustic', 'wit', 'screen', 'best', 'ever', 'done', 'Chris', 'Farley.What', ""n't"", 'work', 'incredibly', 'bogged', 'down', 'sentimentality', 'Who', 'guy', 'Hollywood', 'saying', 'movies', 'need', 'fake', 'drama', 'music', 'swell', 'lessons', 'need', 'be', 'learned', 'just', 'want', 'funny', 'movie', 'DICKIE', 'ROBERTS', 'not', 'worst', 'offender', 'pretty', 'close', 'line.Mary', 'McCormack', 'Private', 'Parts', 'delightful', 'Grace', 'mother', 'heart', 'gold', 'kind', 'actress', 'up', 'screens', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'so', 'much', 'charisma', 'raw', 'power', 'wonder', 'why', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'use', 'more', 'were', 'power', 'player', 'would', 'be', 'making', '20', 'million', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'would', 'be', 'supporting', 'player.Even', 'kids', 'Scott', 'Terra', 'Erin', 'Murphy', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Murphy', 'far', 'better', 'Terra', 'really', 'great', 'scenes', 'work.I', 'do', 'question', 'scene', 'girl', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'ten', 'slinks', 'slut', 'understand', 'why', 'scene', 'movie', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'tacky', 'went', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'made', 'everybody', 'party', 'squirm.But', 'other', 'recommend', 'DICKIE', 'ROBERTS', 'what', 'fun', 'movie', 'also', 'recommend', 'stay', 'closing', 'credits', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hear', 'Marsha', 'Brady', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'scene', 'also', 'Fred', 'Rerun', 'Perry', 'getting', 'down', 'best', 'closing', 'credit', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'having', 'watch', 'stupid', 'outtakes.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'little', 'light', 'fun', 'DICKIE', 'ROBERTS', 'FORMER', 'CHILD', 'STAR', 'good', 'movie', '***1/2', '5']",Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star

This film tells the tale of Dickie Roberts(Spade), a former child celebrity who once was the most popular stars of the early 1970's and now down on his luck. When he heard that Rob Reiner(who portrays himself)is looking for the lead actor for his upcoming film, Dickie would do anything for his carrer to be resurrected. At the advice of Reiner, Dickie re-live his childhood and moves in with a Los Angeles family and turns their lives upside down. The cameo appearances by Emmanuel Lewis(Webster), Dustin Diamond(Saved By The Bell), Danny Bonaduce(The Partridge Family), Corey Feldman(The Lost Boys), Leif Garrett and other former child stars was a ture treat for any fan of the classic TV shows. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the film, deleted scenes of the film, a Comedy Central special of Dickie Roberts, an extended version of the music video featuring a cast of former child stars including Erin Moran(Happy Days), Todd Bridges(Diff'rent Strokes), Tony Dow(Leave It To Beaver), Butch Patrick(The Munsters), and others as well as trailers for other Paramount film favourites.

I especially liked him as the voice of Kuzko in the Emperor's New Groove. Here he plays Dickie Roberts: (former) Child Star, a kid at the top, but a man at the bottom and absolutely desperate for a comeback.His agent (John Lovitz) cannot find him any work outside of celebrity boxing, his girlfriend has dumped him and Dickie's main source of income is parking cars. You get the picture, he's a completely fallen star.Rob Reiner has a role that Dickie would love to get his hands on but Rob wont touch him because it requires an actor who knows 'normal', someone who knows how to be an adult, someone who had a proper childhood. Desperate to get the part, Dickie hires an ordinary middle-class family (dedicated mum, workaholic dad, bullied son, wishful daughter) to look after him like proper parents.Trouble naturally follows. But Dickie's hijinks lessen and his new family's tolerance increases. Yes, they do learn from each other and become better people (yadda yadda) but there is just so much fun and craziness along the way and some genuine character moments.There are loads of celebrity cameos (Tom Arnold, Corey Feldman, Brendan Fraser, Dustin Diamond) and lots of biting satire and the movie industry but the bulk of the film relies upon Dickie learning family values and having fun with the kids, being a kid. Proof positive that he's still the best (former) SNL star.The only bad thing I can mention is Adam Sandler's involvement as executive producer, something that seriously tarnishes the film and prevents it from having any real class.The DVD is in great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound and quite a few extras.",4,This is knucking futs!,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,1833,"['David', 'Spade', 'one', 'fave', 'SNL', 'stars', 'made', 'better', 'movies', 'rest', 'old', 'pals', 'Pat', 'Coneheads', 'Master', 'Disguise', 'are', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'especially', 'liked', 'voice', 'Kuzko', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'Here', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'former', 'Child', 'Star', 'kid', 'top', 'man', 'bottom', 'absolutely', 'desperate', 'comeback.His', 'agent', 'John', 'Lovitz', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'work', 'celebrity', 'boxing', 'girlfriend', 'dumped', 'Dickie', 'main', 'source', 'income', 'parking', 'cars', 'get', 'picture', 'completely', 'fallen', 'star.Rob', 'Reiner', 'role', 'Dickie', 'would', 'love', 'get', 'hands', 'Rob', 'wont', 'touch', 'actor', 'who', ""'normal"", 'someone', 'who', 'how', 'be', 'adult', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'proper', 'childhood', 'Desperate', 'get', 'part', 'Dickie', 'ordinary', 'middle-class', 'family', 'dedicated', 'mum', 'workaholic', 'dad', 'bullied', 'son', 'wishful', 'daughter', 'look', 'proper', 'parents.Trouble', 'naturally', 'Dickie', 'hijinks', 'lessen', 'new', 'family', 'tolerance', 'increases', 'Yes', 'do', 'learn', 'other', 'become', 'better', 'people', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'craziness', 'way', 'genuine', 'character', 'are', 'loads', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Dustin', 'Diamond', 'lots', 'biting', 'satire', 'movie', 'industry', 'bulk', 'film', 'Dickie', 'learning', 'family', 'values', 'having', 'fun', 'kids', 'being', 'kid', 'Proof', 'positive', 'still', 'best', 'former', 'SNL', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'mention', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'involvement', 'executive', 'producer', 'something', 'seriously', 'film', 'prevents', 'having', 'real', 'class.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'looking', '2.35:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sound', 'quite', 'few', 'extras']",Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star

But how can such a grown-up who has had no childhood learn what it is to be a child ? The film is rather hilarious even if at times it is a little bit gross. It also reflects a little bit on what kind of straight jacket society imposes onto children, particularly about the famous four-letter words, forgetting that  nucking futs  are immediately translated by all kids in what they really are.

Spade has made a career of playing characters that are somewhat petulant and childish, and therefore playing the part of a former child star seeking to return to his previous fame comes as no stretch to his acting talents.  He is though, sadly let down by a weak script that, after setting up an interesting concept, never quite delivers on it's promise. The plot is clich&eacute;d and blindingly obvious, and yet manages to be strangely and unexpectedly touching in the end.  However, the middle part of the film grate as trite and pointless set pieces and one-liners are strung together in ever-increasingly ridiculous fashion.  An example of this lies in the treatment of the former child stars that the movie drags out.  As every clich&eacute; about excess and vanity is spat out, the former child stars ham it up for the camera in a way that, while supposedly mocking the ""I'll do anything to be famous again!!"" streak displayed by many ex-famous people, instead appears to be a desperate cry of ""I'll do anything to be famous again!!""  It's demeaning, it's tasteless and in many cases (the sing-a-long at the end for example) it's just cruel, and painful to watch.  Someone should've put these people out of their misery loooong ago, and dragging them out every year to poke fun at them is as vulgar as it is unnecessary.Overall Spade is good, watchable and likable, and the two actual child actors help him carry the film better than might be expected.

Add to this the flurry of 70s &amp; 80s nostalgia specials airing daily on VH1 and E! and I began to look forward to seeing &quot;Dickie Roberts.&quot;But, sadly, the movie basically never gets off the ground.  The viewer knows right away that this is going to be a movie where the potential was wasted.  A brief send-up of &quot;The E! True Hollywood Story,&quot; which starts the film, has a couple of funny lines, but not nearly enough to indicate that the rest of the film will keep you interested.  Like &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; (and any number of SNL-alum movies), the central character in &quot;Dickie Roberts&quot; is basically a sad-sack who yearns for love from those around him, and most importantly, his own family.  However, after years of movies like this, in the year 2004, you're simply just asking yourself, &quot;Again?&quot; as the paperthin plot is revealed.The movie *almost* redeems itself (kinda) with the &quot;We are the World&quot;-type closing credits video, &quot;Childhood Actors of your TV,&quot; performed by the likes of Maureen McCormack, Barry Williams, Corey Feldman &amp; Corey Haim, Screech (sorry, Dustin Diamond), and Haywood Nelson.  Haywood Nelson should get his own movie.  Who didn't love Doowayne?  Anyway, even this great premise falls flat, and instead of a laugh riot (which it very well should have been), it's cringeworthy watching Adam Rich and some of the other childhood actors recite their lines.But, if you have seen and like this movie, I will recommend you getting the DVD as there are a lot of extra features, from commentaries, to deleted scenes, to an extended-video of &quot;Childhood Actors on your TV&quot; and more.  I give the movie 1 star, but the camp and train-wreck that I consider &quot;Childhood Actors on your Television&quot; to be gets 3 stars.

A couple people commented the young girl dancing was too sexual - but the actress has been on stage before as a sort of mini Britney Spears, so what's new?Although there are a large handful of extras on the DVD, both commentaries (one by director, one by Spade and the writer) were rather lackluster.

More than all the scandalous stuff, there's also that very simple question of how you succeed as a grown-up when you've already achieved the highest levels of fame as a child, and the very process of adolescence and maturity robbed you of what gave you that fame, when the cute little kid in that TV show becomes...(in this example) a guy who looks like David Spade? So, former child actors face that hurdle, and some choose to just get out of show business altogether (the ""Brady Bunch"" kids mostly did this, though some have since come back). This movie addresses all that in a very comedic way.TV child star of the '70s, Dickie Roberts is now 35 and parking cars at a trendy Los Angeles resturaunt. Craving to regain the spotlight, he auditions for a role of a normal guy in the new Rob Reiner film, but the director quickly sees he is anything but normal. Desperate to win the part, Dickie hires a family to help him replay his childhood and assume the identity of an average, everyday kid.This all makes for a very clever, extremely funny, and highly entertaining comedy. This is a cute film with Spade in top form--it's nice to see there are still roles for him. It's all very predictable, but makes for fun family viewing (despite some innuendo).

793681,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00015HX5E,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 5]","With American soldiers fighting over in Iraq and problematic situations across the world flashing across American television screens everyday, it is no wonder why the comedy has become the genre of choice amongst the movie-going public. Sitting back in a comfortable theater seat and learning to laugh once again has such an enlightened quality that we crave so much now. If only the comedies that were offered were worth laughing at, in a good way. Spring offerings like Shanghai Knights, Bringing Down the House, and Anger Management weren't worthy of the moderate acclaim and box office dollars they brought in. The summer season had much more tempting features with the likes of Bruce Almighty and Freaky Friday with only the gross-out third installment of the American Pie series, American Wedding, really paying off in the long run. Now as the box office begins to slow down after the last hurrah of the summer (Labor Day weekend), one has to wonder if any new releases can resurrect this failing genre.This is the story of Dickie Roberts, one of the most famous television child stars Hollywood had ever seen and how quickly he fell from the pinnacle of stardom. Dickie Roberts, at the age of six, became an over night sensation with his role on a charming television show thanks in part to his crooked smile and repetitive catch phrase ""That's nucking futs"". But once the hit television was cancelled by the network, Dickie Roberts fell from the mind of the public and lost his career in the process. Now thirty years later, he desires to have the fame and love he once had so long ago but being a valet for a restaurant doesn't get you too much publicity. When the role of a life time becomes available to the former child star, he is willing to do anything to get it including hiring a family to live out the childhood he missed. But when the ""perfect"" family he hires is less then enthusiastic about his stay, Dickie must learn not only learn to be a child again but must also learn to love again to help his ""foster"" family. The story of Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star makes a mockery of the E! True Hollywood Story. The fact that just one episode of the acclaimed series is ten times more entertaining then this film should come as an embarrassment to the filmmakers. The more embarrassing fact is that the parody song that plays during credits is more humorous then the other eighty-two minutes of this feature. No wonder they tacked it on at the end! They featured all those child stars in order for the hate mail to go to them and not the studio.The cast of this live action film plays out much like one of a made for television feature, which is not always a good thing. Poor David Spade! The former Saturday Night Live! cast member, after the dud that was Joe Dirt, has become the John Lovitz of comedies. As an added bonus John Lovitz himself stars in the film along side Spade adding unnecessary emotional sadness to the film. But seriously for a moment, Spade, who is also a writer for the film, works out pretty well in the beginning but screeches (No pun intended for another former child star) around the half-way point. Granted he blurts out some humorous lines every now and again but he loses his charm and becomes corny and cheesy. Another sad sight in the film was Alyssa Milano's role as Dickie Roberts' on/off girlfriend. With such a wonderfully entertaining role on the WB's Charmed, it boggles the mind why such horrible roles are offered to her or why she even accepts them. Jon Lovitz isn't featured in this film as much as he probably should have and when he is seen, he really isn't funny. Now on to Dickie's ""foster"" family with each role being diagnosed instead of the performers as their names aren't recognizable (and with the film as it is, it is better for their careers that they aren't mentioned). The children are amazingly annoying from the beginning with crappy lines like ""stranger danger"" and ""schiats"" beings spoken by these sickingly cute kids every five seconds. More could be said about the family but nothing good, so better to take a breather from the constant ranting.Overall, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is a horrible disaster from beginning to end. Though not as disastrous as The Hulk and 2 Fast 2 Furious, the film doesn't give too many good qualities to talk about. How can this feature be called a comedy when barely a snicker was blurted out during the film's nearly two hour run? Any slightly entertaining moment that does peek out has been used in every trailer and television ad so many times that all charm is squeezed out of it. The creators of this feature should not only be labeled as failures but as perverts as well with a disturbing scene involving a twelve year old girl (who had obviously not reached maturity yet) sexually dancing to ""I Want to be Bad"". Dickie Roberts does have its charming family moments but they are so few and far between that they really aren't worth mentioning. The bottom line is that Dickie Roberts makes a night watching Nick at Nite and TV Land look like must attend event. Here's hoping that the fall season isn't as disappointing as the first outing away from the summer heat.",2,The Moose Hole - 'Dickie Roberts': Current Wash-up,1073692800,"01 10,

Now, as an adult, he lands an audition in a Rob Reiner film to play a ""normal"" kid.  Unfortunately, he's anything but normal.  So Dickie hires a family to teach him a few things about being a kid.  He puts an ad in the paper and receives several calls back.  Dickie picks the ""low maintenance"" family, the Finney's.This family includes a mom Grace, a dad George, their two kids Sam and Sally, and a dog named Popeye.  Grace is interested in interior design, and because her husband George dismisses the idea and makes her feel guilty about it, their marriage is on the rocks.  George is never home and probably knows nothing about his kids.  Sam gets bullied at school and Sally is in competition with the popular girl at school, and both are auditioning to be on a team.Dickie stays with the Finney's for a month.  He teaches Sally a dance routine for the school talent show.  He talks to Sam and gives him advice to talk to a girl he likes.There are so many great scenes in this movie.  One of my favourite scene is when the family dog Popeye digs up the neighbour's dead rabbit and brings it to Sam and Sally.  Of course, everyone thinks that the dog killed it.  They all bring the dead rabbit in the house and wash it and before the neighbours come back, they put the rabbit back in the cage.

793695,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00015HX5E,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","'Dickie Roberts -- Former Child Star' starts with a wonderful mocumentary style, which cleverly uses the 'archives' of the title role Dickie Roberts (played by David Spade), who was a popular child star on TV back in the 70s.  Now, having lost everything, he dreams of the comeback, and today he joins in the celebrity boxing match with Emmanuel Lewis.  And Dickie  loses.In spite of a good support from Jon Rovitz, the film then begins to falter because of its contrived plot with a sugary and predictable ending in view.  The film tells how desperate Dickie can be, trying to get a role in the new film by Rob Reiner (who appears as himself).  Rob kindly asks the former child star to 're-live your childhood.'  Which means, Dickie Roberts must learn to live a normal life in a perfectly all-American family in suburbia (with the mother Mary McCormack), and teach something about life to the kids, or be taught by them.Now David Spade keeps the ball rolling anyway, doing impersonations of ... er ... jet-ski or motorbike, which are very energetic but unfunny.  Still, he carries the show pretty well though never showing better ideas than the opening sections, in which you can see several cameos including Tom Arnold and Brendan Fraser (Dickie insists on saying 'Fraijarr)'.  And you can also see Alyssa Milano (who was the little daughter of the star of 'Commando')Perhaps you might be most interested in the end credits, where a group of real-life former child stars appear and sing a comic song.  You want to see the Brady Bunch kids?  Here they are.  And a bit of Corey Feldman or Corey Haim singing together.  But of course, it is the film itslef that really matters, and that is done by Sam Weisman of run-of-the-mill 'The Out-of-Towners' and 'What's the Worst That Could Happen?.'

793696,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00015HX5E,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","In DICKIE ROBERTS: FORMER CHILD STAR, David Spade took an idea he originally had for a Saturday Night Live sketch that never aired and revamped it to portray the title character, Dickie Roberts, a child star of a family sitcom in the 1970s who entered the phrase ""Nuckin' Futs"" into the American lexicon.  Dickie's success kept him from having even a semblance of a normal childhood and after the sitcom ended, he soon found himself down and out and unable to get cast in any worthwhile projects.  Dickie Roberts was just another child actor whose life became tainted by his former celebrity.  In his mid-30s he finds himself parking cars and competing in a ""former stars"" wrestling event just to pay the bills.  Dickie learns about a project, a movie, that he believes will help him re-launch his career.  The director thinks Dickie might be good for the role, but doesn't think he can relate to normal people.  Desperate to win the role in the much covenanted film, Dickie hires a family, the Finneys, to expose him to everything he missed out on in his childhood.  Mother Grace (Mary McCormack) isn't very excited about the venture, but Dad George (Craig Bierko) won't look a money-making opportunity in the mouth.  As for kids, Sam (Scott Terra) and Sally (Jenna Boyd), they aren't very happy at first about the arrangements either.  However, mother and children are able to overcome their initial hesitation and reluctance and find in Dickie a companion soul that's really just looking for the family love he never received while growing up.  Yet, even though the Finneys appear to be a normal family, they have problems of their own, problems that become exasperated by Dickie's presence.  Dickie has to decide to continue in his research or to help heal the wounds of his hired family.Child actors have an incredible difficult time in life when they grow up.  Most grow up secluded from the world outside of Hollywood and by the time their shows are cancelled or they are no longer cute enough to be cast in movies, they usually have a difficult time adjusting to a world without fame.  It's a sad commentary about the evil of show business.Yet, it's also an area that was ripe for being parodied.  I just wasn't sure David Spade was the right guy to do it.  After all, since the death of his partner in comedy, Chris Farley, David Spade has become an actor that tends to be more grating than he is entertaining.  He's made a few bearable movies since Farley passed away, such as JOE DIRT, but for the most part he has ruined every project he has starred in, e.g. 8 SIMPLE RULES FOR DATING MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER.  Of course, Spade does have a very fast and witty charm to him that ended up making him perfect for the role of Dickie Roberts.The movie has a few clich&eacute;s, yet it's basically a homage dedicated to all the former child stars of Tinseltown.  The movie parodies their lives, yet gives them a portion of dignity, too.  That's not to say the movie is all social commentary and not funny, because there are some very funny parts.  It's just that the movie comes off as being more of a humorous movie of affection rather than a disrespectful laughing shamefest.Overall, I liked DICKIE ROBERTS: FORMER CHILD STAR.  It was a better movie than I thought it would be and wasn't as disrespectful as I had been led to believe.

Honestly, I had absolutely no intention of seeing this movie, but it was important to a friend of mine and somehow she convinced me to go with her. I like comedies, but I don't like things that are slap-stickish or that are geared solely for the pleasure of 12 year old boys.I was pleasantly surprised with Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. This movie was incredibly funny and I loved watching Barry Williams, Leif Garrett, Corey Feldman, Danny Bonaducci, and Screech playing poker. Every game they play, Barry raises the stakes by adding souveniers from the Brady Bunch episodes telling them they can easily make money on ebay.The movie is slightly absurd but it is hilarious. For me, it is funny because there honestly are people who think and act like Dickie does. They got so into the idea of fame that they would do absolutely anything to ""make a comeback"" even ride around in a baby stroller and go ""ga-ga goo-goo"".I also enjoyed the children in the movie. They are so smart and witty and really hold their own against Dickie. They open up a whole world to him that he's never experienced before: a normal childhood. In the beginning, they hate him and make fun of him, but as they get to know eachother, the children learn from Dickie how to be self-confident and Dickie learns the value of love.While some of the jokes are crude, they work for David Spade in a way that another actor would find it hard to get away with. David is able to combine a childlike wonder and innocence with vulgarity in such a way that you never completely dislike Dickie. There is enough hope and sincerity that you find yourself pushing for him even though he goes over the top to get what he wants.Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is also filled with wonderful oddities like a celebrity wrestling match between David Spade and Emmanuel Lewis (of Webster fame), visits to AA and Lamaze, the Barry Williams poker games, and a witty song at the end featuring various child-stars from the 70's and 80's.Quite enjoyable!",5,Good surprise,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,2038,"['first', 'saw', 'theater', 'Honestly', 'had', 'absolutely', 'intention', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'important', 'friend', 'mine', 'somehow', 'convinced', 'go', 'comedies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'things', 'are', 'slap-stickish', 'are', 'geared', 'solely', 'pleasure', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boys.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Dickie', 'Roberts', 'Former', 'Child', 'Star', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'loved', 'watching', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'Leif', 'Garrett', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Danny', 'Bonaducci', 'Screech', 'playing', 'poker', 'game', 'play', 'Barry', 'stakes', 'adding', 'souveniers', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'telling', 'can', 'easily', 'make', 'money', 'ebay.The', 'movie', 'slightly', 'absurd', 'hilarious', 'funny', 'honestly', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'act', 'Dickie', 'got', 'so', 'idea', 'fame', 'would', 'do', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'make', 'comeback', 'even', 'ride', 'around', 'baby', 'stroller', 'go', 'ga-ga', 'goo-goo', '.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'children', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'smart', 'witty', 'really', 'hold', 'own', 'Dickie', 'open', 'up', 'whole', 'world', 'never', 'experienced', 'normal', 'childhood', 'beginning', 'hate', 'make', 'fun', 'get', 'know', 'eachother', 'children', 'learn', 'Dickie', 'how', 'be', 'self-confident', 'Dickie', 'value', 'love.While', 'jokes', 'are', 'crude', 'work', 'David', 'Spade', 'way', 'actor', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'get', 'away', 'David', 'able', 'combine', 'childlike', 'wonder', 'innocence', 'vulgarity', 'such', 'way', 'never', 'completely', 'dislike', 'Dickie', 'enough', 'hope', 'sincerity', 'find', 'pushing', 'even', 'top', 'get', 'what', 'wants.Dickie', 'Roberts', 'Former', 'Child', 'Star', 'also', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'oddities', 'celebrity', 'wrestling', 'match', 'David', 'Spade', 'Emmanuel', 'Lewis', 'Webster', 'fame', 'AA', 'Lamaze', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'poker', 'games', 'witty', 'song', 'end', 'featuring', 'various', 'child-stars', '70', ""80's.Quite"", 'enjoyable']",Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star
