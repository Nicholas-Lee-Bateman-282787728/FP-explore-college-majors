Wilkins ""star gazer""","[0, 0]","I tend to agree that this one, despite its potential to be much better is not.The voices are top notch, and are not the problem but the artwork could have used some help and the script could have been better. Even very little ones these days are more sophisticated enough to handle something more meaty than this rendering. I will admit the songs do grow on you and while I did like the ""Sea of Time""-unfortunately it was the ""Titan Song"" that got stuck in my head-and wouldn't go away.I did like both the Hercules series and the Xena series when they were on, and I still miss them. I was looking forward to something fairly exciting, and while this did have the potential to be better than it was- potential was that was all that it had.Lets just say that this did not do any justice to the actors-or to those watching.",3,Silly...,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,821,"['tend', 'agree', 'one', 'potential', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'not.The', 'voices', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'are', 'not', 'problem', 'artwork', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'help', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Even', 'very', 'little', 'ones', 'days', 'are', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'handle', 'something', 'more', 'meaty', 'rendering', 'will', 'admit', 'songs', 'do', 'grow', 'did', 'like', 'Sea', 'Time', '-unfortunately', 'was', 'Titan', 'Song', 'got', 'stuck', 'head-and', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'away.I', 'did', 'Hercules', 'series', 'Xena', 'series', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'miss', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'something', 'fairly', 'exciting', 'did', 'have', 'potential', 'be', 'better', 'was-', 'potential', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'actors-or', 'watching']",N/A

I like a good Hercules/Xena collaboration as much as the next guy, but there was something funny about this movie (and I mean that ironically). Apparently, this is the 1st time we see Hera's face, before they cast Meg Foster (Evil-Lyn from the low budget Masters of the Universe movie), before that as many fans will tell you, she was just a disembodied set of eyes who would occasionally send a lightening bolt, or peacock feather down to earth. However, there's just something strange about this animation. Is it just me, or did anyone else who saw this think. &#34;This is a little too Ren & Stimpy&#34;? I mean, the way the characters are drawn and their expressions, such as when Hercules is straining and his teeth are clenched and you hear little pings when his veins start to pop out. I know, the live action show doesn't take itself too seriously, but this was defintely more goofy, than witty. Maybe it's just me, I guess I prefer perennial Hercules & Xena foes like Echidna and Callisto. (Yes, even though Echidna was pretty much reformed).

53343,AXYESYR1GNGM0,0783225806,DavisJes,"[5, 9]",I bought this becuase it was a xena movie but was extermely disappointed. I am thankful they kept the original cast but I seriously think the writters and amination artist were smoking something. The Story line is not that great but it could have worked if it were live action. I think it would have been cool to see the titans as we saw many other creatures on the shows. I loved both the shows and will watch them whenever I can but have not watched this again since the first time I got it. I was hoping that they would make a Xena live action movie beucase after all Herc got four live action movies. A good Xena movie will never happen becuase Xena is 'dead' and Kevin Smith sadly died. But they could always make a Xena movie to clear up somethings from the past and Gabby could alway wear a wig or it could be something from the last seasons. Sorry I strayed but there is not anything good about this movie. Even for a die hard Xena fan it is a snooze to watch.

In this tale, Hercules and Iolaus, and Xena and Gabrielle must work together to stop Hera from taking over the world with her Titans and to free Hercules' mother, Alcheme. The voice cast was superb, Kevin Sorbo, Lucy Lawless, Renee O'Connor, Michael Hurst, the late Kevin Smith and Alexandra Tydings were at their best as animated versions of their respective characters.

Most of the characters, in my opinion, don't look anything like they really do - but then that's typical of most cartoons.  Take it for what it is.  If you like Hercules, Xena and Gabrielle, Ares, Aphrodite, and watching the Gods meddle and get SOME of what's coming to them - it's a good thing to watch. Don't expect a &#34;Xena&#34; episode or a &#34;Hercules&#34; episode.  It's not that.  It's a Saturday morning cartoon version of Herc and Xena.But honestly, I enjoyed it. But then I'm nutty over Herc and Xena.  Love both shows.  And I like all the characters and I like all the actors.  And I actually happen to like cartoons.  Yes, I'm an adult and I like cartoons - sue me.  :)If you don't expect a typical episode or a movie - you'll like it.  But truly, if you can't stand cartoons - or never liked the shows - don't buy it.  This is something good for the fans who do like those things.Again - not the greatest graphics, but typical for that time period.  And the story, as I said, is actually not bad.  Gabrielle and some of the Gods are turned into animals.  And it's up to Hercules and Xena to figure out a way to get them back.  Xena gets pissed, of course, and she sings in this - so it was worth it for me to buy it just for that - Lucy has a great voice.

53351,A31TVT9DSU5HL1,0783225806,Paul Jutras,"[0, 0]",The fact Universal DVD came out on DVD around the time Disney Hercules hit theaters it pretty obvious this was an attempt to ride on the success of Hercules Legendary Journeys and Xena Warrior Princess shows and try to one up it. Especially since both Disney and this movie had an Olympian Gods vs Titans theme to it. Though while the Disney version of the titans were less human and more monsters I'm surprise that the naked human with color skin appearance of the titans in this movie got past the censor boards.I'm not going to put fault on the animation since I'm sure with the live series aimed at ages 20 and up that Universal wanted to aim for a younger target group in this movie and I find no fault at that.  I did find fault on Gaberille loosing her voice when Artimus transforms her into a giant eagle.  I felt like the actress that played Xena side kick in the live series got short changed with the lack of voice acting lines she had in this movie.  It was nice to twist with Hercules mother in the movie story plot and always found Hercules and Xena butting heads to be good in both live show and this movie.,4,Hercules For Kids,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,1122,"['fact', 'Universal', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'time', 'Disney', 'Hercules', 'hit', 'theaters', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'was', 'attempt', 'ride', 'success', 'Hercules', 'Legendary', 'Journeys', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'shows', 'try', 'one', 'Especially', 'Disney', 'movie', 'had', 'Olympian', 'Gods', 'vs', 'Titans', 'theme', 'Disney', 'version', 'titans', 'were', 'less', 'human', 'more', 'monsters', ""'m"", 'surprise', 'naked', 'human', 'color', 'skin', 'appearance', 'titans', 'movie', 'got', 'censor', 'boards.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'put', 'fault', 'animation', ""'m"", 'sure', 'live', 'series', 'aimed', 'ages', '20', 'up', 'Universal', 'wanted', 'aim', 'younger', 'target', 'group', 'movie', 'find', 'fault', 'did', 'find', 'fault', 'Gaberille', 'loosing', 'voice', 'when', 'Artimus', 'giant', 'eagle', 'felt', 'actress', 'played', 'Xena', 'side', 'kick', 'live', 'series', 'got', 'short', 'changed', 'lack', 'voice', 'acting', 'lines', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'twist', 'Hercules', 'mother', 'movie', 'story', 'plot', 'always', 'found', 'Hercules', 'Xena', 'butting', 'heads', 'be', 'good', 'live', 'show', 'movie']",N/A
