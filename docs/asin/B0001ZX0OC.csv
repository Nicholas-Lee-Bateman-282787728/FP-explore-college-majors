I never saw this in the theater and I am glad that I waited.The characters Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are excellent.  Throughout the movie because of Clint Eastwood's style of directing you feel as though you know who really did what and it makes sense but when you find out the truth you realize that that was the more sane explanation.  It is a real intellectual thriller.The extras are good on this movie especially the commentary by Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.  WATCH OUT though, if you are watching the movie for the first time, don't use the commentary because they give away the plot and critical themes before the end of the movie.  They are pretty hilarious and that gives you a better understanding of the movie.  It helps you catch things that you would not have notice like the only time that Tim Robbins character tells the truth.I would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy intellectual thrillers.  It's not a lot of blood and guts but gives you many emotional turns from happy, to sad, to revenge, to helplessness.",4,"Good extras, excellent film",1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,1116,"['one', 'best', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'enjoy', 'while', 'never', 'saw', 'theater', 'am', 'glad', 'waited.The', 'characters', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'are', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'style', 'directing', 'feel', 'know', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'what', 'sense', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'realize', 'was', 'more', 'sane', 'explanation', 'real', 'intellectual', 'thriller.The', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'movie', 'especially', 'commentary', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'WATCH', 'OUT', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'commentary', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'critical', 'themes', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'better', 'understanding', 'movie', 'catch', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'notice', 'only', 'time', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'truth.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'intellectual', 'thrillers', 'not', 'lot', 'blood', 'guts', 'many', 'emotional', 'turns', 'happy', 'sad', 'revenge', 'helplessness']",N/A
819121,A3HWXY0IMXOBFB,B0001ZX0OC,Adam Dustin,"[1, 6]","""Mystic River"" is not a movie without flaws, but achieves a level of acting unsurpassed by any movie in recent years. The story revolves around the murder of a man's daughter which brings together a group of three friends who grew up together in south Boston.  These three friends are played brilliantly by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and the underrated performance by Kevin Bacon.  These three actors reveal a side of humanity that is inside everyone.  Brilliantly directed by Clint Eastwood, ""Mystic River"" deals with the human emotions of grief and despair occuring from the loss of family and innocence.  Kevin Bacon plays the detective on the case of Penn's murdered daughter while Robbins plays a possible suspect as he returns home the night of the murder covered in blood.  All three portray different types of emotion, but they all come together in a brilliant ensemble performance made even stronger by the supporting roles of the women of the film.As I said before, ""Mystic River"" is not without flaws, when you discover how and why the daughter was murdered, it seems to be contrived and unbelievable, but it is a small factor that doesn't hinder an extremely powerful film.",4,A Triumphant Performance of Humanity!,1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,1182,"['Mystic', 'River', 'not', 'movie', 'flaws', 'level', 'acting', 'unsurpassed', 'movie', 'recent', 'years', 'story', 'murder', 'man', 'daughter', 'together', 'group', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'south', 'Boston', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'underrated', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'three', 'actors', 'reveal', 'side', 'humanity', 'everyone', 'Brilliantly', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Mystic', 'River', 'deals', 'human', 'emotions', 'grief', 'despair', 'occuring', 'loss', 'family', 'innocence', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'detective', 'case', 'Penn', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'Robbins', 'possible', 'suspect', 'home', 'night', 'murder', 'covered', 'blood', 'three', 'portray', 'different', 'types', 'emotion', 'come', 'together', 'brilliant', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'made', 'even', 'stronger', 'supporting', 'roles', 'women', 'film.As', 'said', 'Mystic', 'River', 'not', 'flaws', 'when', 'discover', 'how', 'why', 'daughter', 'was', 'murdered', 'be', 'contrived', 'unbelievable', 'small', 'factor', ""n't"", 'hinder', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'film']",N/A

It has the pacing of ""In the Bedroom"", and towards the end, the same tragic spiral down effect of ""Requiem for a Dream."" It's plotted in such a way that we are given one false clue after another (as in Bloodwork) keeping you on the edge of conclusion until we are at the last moment given a huge reveal that shatters everything we have learned prior. At the core, it's a woven tragedy.The acting is tremendous, as you have no doubt read about from many major critics. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and the often underated Kevin Bacon (check out ""Stir of Echoes"") are very dependable actors still deep into their prime. All of them do their part's more than justice, though other projects in their massive acting career's have had them in my opinion, at a more difficult level. (Dead Man Walking, Jacobs Ladder, The Shawshank Redemption.)I bought the three disc set of Mystic River specifically because I wanted the best edition out there. The video and sound quality are as good as I hoped for. The saturated filming is downright vibrant in its murkiness, the same way as Se7en. If you don't want to spend the extra ten bucks to have bonus material (though educational from almost every aspect), and the soundtrack then you should be happy with the single disc edition. (check out ""A perfect World"", Eastwood at his best.)

819123,A3IAP2JMTP5YBN,B0001ZX0OC,"adriana ""alisa""","[6, 8]","Mystic River is the type of movie I really wanted to like. And ten minutes into the whole thing, I was prepared to do just that.But after those brief ten minutes flew by, all my hopes went out the window, and I spent the rest of the two hours simply trying to pay attention.I think that everyone is familiar with the plot by now, no? But even if not, I don't want to spoil it for those who want to see it still(because I personally hate when that happens).For me, I found many different things wrong with this movie.For one thing, and this is something I'm getting quite used to comming across, the acting was way overrated.Don't get me wrong, it was ""good""&lt; but there was very little about the performances here that moved me.Sean Penn give a totally mediocre performance.His acting is just all over the place; one minute he's a loving devoted father,the next he's stiff as a tree, and the next he's a foul-mouthed gangster.I get that people have ""dimension"", but this was just too much.I also find myself feeling very little during his ""grieving"" scenes for his dead daughter.He went over the top, AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY see his making an effort to burst into tears.I'm gonna pretend to find it funny that one reviewer compared Penn to Marlon Brando.He's as much of a Marlon Brando as Sarah Michelle Gellar is Merryl Streep. Kevin Bacon had nothing much to work with, and throughout he just looked lost.Also, the sub plot with his wife who kept calling and not saying anything was dumb, unnecessary, and annoying.Tim Robbins, I think, gave the only believable performance of the bunch.Throughout he was commited and ""inside"" his character if you know what I mean.As for the supporting cast-Lawrence Fishburne has a nice screen presence, and does good because he's not given much to work with.Marcia Gay Harden-although I never really got to know her character, or her motives, I thought her acting was pretty good, if not a little whiny during some of the emotional scenes.And why the heck was Laura Linney even in this?As Penn's wife, not only was her character cold and unlikeable, she's given about five minutes of screen time, and then she shows up in the end with this big Macbeth speech that runs for about ten minutes!What?Also, he Boston accent was laughable.I happen to like many of the actors here on a regular basis, so something tells me the spotty acting had something to do with the direction-which fails to set a definitive tone for the film, and like the acting jumps all over the place.I also found this movie emotionless.Like, during Penn's grieving scenes,or the scene where Penn's daughter is found dead, among others(so as not to spoil the plot), I didn't feel a thing.I also had to laugh at the people who said this  film was thought-provoking, and ""deep"".What exactly is deep or thought provoking about it?What does it manage to say that hasn't been said thousands of times before?Not only are its themes not particularly original, the whole film is executed in an even less compelling way-making you simply not care about what it is trying to say,let alone what happens along the way.The ending could not have been more unfullfilling.The movie never seems to go anywhere-when a good film ends, you're supposed to feel something-anything.I felt nothing when Mystic River wrapped up.I also thought the film was awfully paced-most of it is very slow and uneventful-and then these big climax like events are thrown at you and you're supposed to give a damn.A couple minor glitches were the atrocious, overwrought,and out of place score which sounded like it should belong in Titanic.And the setting which everyone kept talking about looks like your average studio setting to me.Mystic River isn't an awful film,but its got some major flaws, and not much on the good side.It is a film with little depth, little emotion,bad pacing, and very overrated acting.Totally

The film revolves around three childhod friends(Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon) and two horrible incidents, one in their childhood and one in their adulthood, that forever link them and change them. Sean Penn gives an excellent performance, best of his career, as an ex-con whose daughter dies at the beginning of the film. The scene where he realizes his daughter is dead is amazing and heartwrenching. Tim Robbins also gives a career best performance as a man trapped in a past he can't forget and his performance is the most haunting of the three main complex characters. Kevin Bacon is a homicide detective and does a great job showing the pain his character feels over his wife leaving him and his inability to communicate and share his feelings make his charcter very interesting. Bacon also delivers a career best performance. Laurence Fishburne also does a great job as Bacon's partner, a man who wants to solve the murder and feels like Bacon's character is too close to the case. Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden also have excellent performances as the wives of Penn and Robbins, and they both will be nominated at Oscar time.

819130,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0001ZX0OC,Alex Udvary,"[1, 3]","As pointed out by so many others ""Mystic River"" is a powerful, emotional, well acted, well written film directed by Client Eastwood (""Unforgiven"", ""Play Misty For Me""). Without question this is one of the year's best films. And what about the performance by Sean Penn! Of all the movies I've seen this year Penn delivers the best performance I've seen as actor give this year. Unless something really amazing comes out in the next month Penn better win the Oscar. Tim Robbins is right on target as well. He delivers an Oscar caliber performance. Other note worthy aspects of the film include the cinematography, the editing, and the adapted screenplay by Brian Helgeland based on Dennis Lehane's novel.""Mystic River"" tells the story of three young boys growing up in Boston. One day a traumatic event occurs leaving a permant emotional scar on one of the boys. Fast foward 30 years later now yet another terrible event occurs. The death of one of their daughters, bringing the demons of the past up front again as they now deal with new demons. And who knows what's the come in the future. All of these characters seemed scarred for life. There is a bleak feeling one gets by the end of the movie.The childhood friends grow up to become Sean Penn (Jimmy Markum), the one who loses his daughter. Tim Robbins (Dave Boyle) and Kevin Bacon (Sean Divine) who has become a cop and is assigned to the case. As I said before there is wonderful acting here. The three men turn in fine performances by almost everytime Penn was onscreen I had goosebumps. Now, I don't say that just to offer idle praise. I'm being sincere. Penn shows a very wide range of emotions in this movie.One of the only faults I have with this movie is it seems to be the men's movie all the way. You have two very talented actresses in Marica Gay Harden and Laura Linney and they are not used properly. I admit more time is given to Harden but they seemed to have forgotten Linney. Now naturally I can't speak for everyone but I thought Linney was great in ""You Can Count On Me"". I find her to be an extremely talented person. But she has just about nothing in this movie. Her only really good scene where she has more than two lines is at the end of the picture! I just wish they could have given her a better role. Other than that I've no complants.Also spot Eli Wallach, Eastwood's old buddy in ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" in a delightful cameo.Bottom-line: An emotional powerhouse of a film. Great acting, good script and fine directing by Eastwood.

The plot is solid, full of undercurrents, implications, and moral questions.  There are some interesting twists here and details that really make you sit up straighter as you try to puzzle them out.I won't spoil anything in this film for you and other reviews have discussed the premise, etc.  But, I will add that the characters show elements of people YOU know all throughout the film.  You catch glimpses of behavior you see in the people you know and love... things you've maybe never noticed before now.  You find yourself trying to imagine yourself in the shoes of this character and then that one...  What would I do?  What would I think?  How would I feel?This is a film you watch ACTIVELY.

819135,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B0001ZX0OC,Amazon Customer,"[5, 13]","I'm not going to be half-hearted about it. For my money, ""Mystic River"" is as close to a perfect movie as practically any Hollywood film I've ever seen. Not only is it based on a novel - by Dennis Lehane - that already seems to have considerable depth, it's also superbly adapted by Brian Hegeland with a screenplay that seems to add to the complexity, and it's flawlessly directed by Clint Eastwood.The film, set in blue collar Boston, opens with three boys playing street hockey and then deciding to scribble their names in some wet cement. They are seen by two men who claim to be plainclothes cops. One of the boys, Dave, is ordered into their car while the others watch. The men abduct him, lock him in a cellar and sexually abuse him for four days. He escapes but he never fully recovers. Nor do his friends Sean and Jimmy. Their guilt over standing by as he was taken away stays with them as adults.The boys grow up. Jimmy as an adult is played by Sean Penn. He's an ex-con who has settled down to run a local store. He has a nineteen year old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) from a first marriage than ended with his wife's death while he was doing time. He also has two younger daughters from a second marriage Annabeth (Laura Linney). Katie leaves one night to spend the night with her friends. She is found murdered the next day.Sean (Kevin Bacon), long estranged from his other two childhood friends, is the detective assigned to the case - with partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne). Dave (Tim Robbins) becomes a prime suspect. He's still visibly damaged by his past, although now married and a father. He came home on the night of Katie's death with his clothes covered in blood, a fact that his wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) keeps to herself for as long as she can, finally revealing it with tragic results.I can't say much more about the story, because I don't want to give too much away. I'm so enthusiastic about this movie that my review should really consist of the words, ""See this film"" repeated over and over like a mantra.As a director, Eastwood veers between superbly assured films and other ones that don't really quite work. I liked ""The Unforgiven"", the improving adaptation of ""Bridges of Madison County"", ""True Crime"" and ""Bird. I was much less keen on ""Blood Work"" and ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"". Suffice it to say that he has never been better than in his direction of ""Mystic River"". Tom Stern's cinematography keeps things looking gritty and down to earth, often leaving much of the screen in darkness. The editing by Joel Cox, particularly at the beginning, knows exactly when to cut away from things , when to leave a pause for breathing space or reflection.Some might find ""Mystic River"" gets off to a slightly slow start. Don't concentrate on the story. Watch the characters. And watch the performances that Eastwood has coaxed from everyone. Every single actor inhabits his or her part. And characters that might at first seem to be minor are ultimately used to devastating effect.As a crime movie, as a study of three wounded men, as a meditation on themes of responsibility and guilt, ""Mystic River"" is a success on many levels.

I love a film that captures the darkness in life.  That said, there is a fine line a film must be cautious not to cross before it loses the naturalness needed to convey the raw emotions it is attempting to stir up.  `Mystic River' is so dark and so stern in its delivery that it becomes pretentious.The film tells the story of three friends, born and raised Boston, who witness (and suffer) a terrible crime in their youth that leaves them all scarred to varying degrees.  In their adulthood, they have all taken separate paths but they are soon all going to be thrown back into one another's lives when a murder shakes their community, and their families, to the core.  After the murder the lives of these three men (two of them in particular) spirals out of control in a sea of crime, abuse, accusations and murder.From beginning to end, this film wears an impenetrable frown.One of the films major disappointments comes in the form of its `all too highly praised' cast.  The acting in this film is far from three-dimensional, which is a big detraction from this film.  A film of this nature (one that is drenched in turmoil) needs to have characters that feel real and relatable and fully fleshed out.  Outside of Dave Boyle (portrayed with ambiguous fervor by Tim Robbins), this film is inhabited with mere caricatures.  Actresses Laura Linney and Miss Harden (two VERY fine actresses) are saddled with characters who seem stuck in one solitary note, never wavering from their immediate emotional stance.  Kevin Bacon has one of the films more poignant character arcs, yet his character is given nothing more than a side-glance by the director, who seems less concerned with allowing us to feel the weight of the story's core and more concerned with lathering us up with wet and sticky distress.  And then you have OSCAR WINNER Sean Penn who hams up the screen with such an uneven and unfocused variation of emotional disturbance.  I'm actually offended at the praise this performance has garnered, for it lacks any and all subtlety, which is needed to make this character remotely believable.  Instead of layering Jimmy, Penn went to `easy' route and just saddled him with expected emotional outbursts that diminish his character's authenticity.This film kind of makes me mad the more I think about it.In the end, I just can't muster up a reason to recommend this to anyone.

819139,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0001ZX0OC,Andy Orrock,"[2, 7]","""Mystic River"" is Director Clint Eastwood's movie.  His fingerprints are all over it.  The framing of the two shots of Dave Boyle's drives in the backseat of a car - one at age 11, the other in adulthood - are great pieces of craft.  When Dave accepts that second ride, you know the day's going to end up badly for him.The other thing to say here is that somebody has done their homework on Southie life.  The little things like the corner store filling up after Sunday mass, the parents hanging out on the porch listening to the Red Sox, bringing over a case of beer to help the mourning process...these are all pitch perfect.Now, on the other hand, everyone wants to have a go at the Boston accent, and the results are mixed.  Robin Willams won an Oscar, after all, misplacing his R's in Good Will Hunting, even though he famously mangled his sentences beyond recognition.  In ""Mystic River,"" the attempts are all over the map.  The men - Bacon, Robbins, Penn, Fishburne - give it a decent go (that's a rough ranking order).  Of course, every time one of these guys interacts with a true Bostonian (they're easy to spot), you get a feel for how much of the richness and flavor they've left out.The women are a different story.  Marcia Gay Harden is difficult to judge because of the role.  She's in a perpetual state of fright/shock/fear that masks the accent.  Cool.  The role calls for that and she delivers.But, whoo!  Laura Linney!!  Man, oh, man.  I mean, I love Laura Linney (esp. ""You Can Count on Me"") but her accent here is, as they say in professional cycling, ""beyond category.""  At one point during her ""Lady Macbeth"" scene towards the end, she's telling Sean Penn ""I can feel yo-uh hot, Jimmy.""  She said this a couple of times.  My wife and I looked at each other...""What the heck is she saying?""  Oh!!  ""Heart!  She's trying to say 'heart'!""  Talk about weird.  Out of nowhere, the movie gets all Shakespearean on us.  Linney's character - part of the woodwork until this very late point in the movie - starts telling Jimmy that ""you can run this town.""  I understand the implied tie-in to Boston's famous Bulger case, but I think the whole thing could have been more subtly done.  I mean, Linney's character is named ""Annabeth"" for crying out loud.",4,Good story marred by over-the-top Lady Macbeth ending,1067299200,"10 28, 2003",2003,2266,"['Mystic', 'River', 'Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'fingerprints', 'are', 'framing', 'two', 'shots', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'drives', 'backseat', 'car', 'one', 'age', '11', 'other', 'adulthood', 'are', 'great', 'pieces', 'craft', 'When', 'Dave', 'second', 'ride', 'know', 'day', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'badly', 'him.The', 'other', 'thing', 'say', 'here', 'somebody', 'done', 'homework', 'Southie', 'life', 'little', 'things', 'corner', 'store', 'filling', 'up', 'Sunday', 'mass', 'parents', 'hanging', 'out', 'porch', 'listening', 'Red', 'Sox', 'bringing', 'over', 'case', 'beer', 'help', 'mourning', 'process', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect.Now', 'other', 'hand', 'everyone', 'have', 'go', 'Boston', 'accent', 'results', 'are', 'mixed', 'Robin', 'Willams', 'won', 'Oscar', 'misplacing', 'R', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'even', 'famously', 'mangled', 'sentences', 'recognition', 'Mystic', 'River', 'attempts', 'are', 'map', 'men', 'Bacon', 'Robbins', 'Penn', 'Fishburne', 'give', 'decent', 'go', 'rough', 'ranking', 'order', 'course', 'time', 'one', 'guys', 'interacts', 'true', 'Bostonian', ""'re"", 'easy', 'spot', 'get', 'feel', 'how', 'much', 'richness', 'flavor', ""'ve"", 'left', 'out.The', 'women', 'are', 'different', 'story', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'difficult', 'judge', 'role', 'perpetual', 'state', 'fright/shock/fear', 'accent', 'Cool', 'role', 'whoo', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Man', 'oh', 'man', 'mean', 'love', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'esp', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'accent', 'here', 'say', 'professional', 'cycling', 'category', 'one', 'point', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'scene', 'end', 'telling', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'can', 'feel', 'yo-uh', 'hot', 'Jimmy', 'said', 'couple', 'times', 'wife', 'looked', 'other', 'What', 'heck', 'saying', 'Oh', 'Heart', 'trying', 'say', ""'heart"", 'Talk', 'weird', 'nowhere', 'movie', 'Shakespearean', 'Linney', 'character', 'part', 'woodwork', 'very', 'late', 'point', 'movie', 'telling', 'Jimmy', 'can', 'run', 'town', 'understand', 'implied', 'tie-in', 'Boston', 'famous', 'Bulger', 'case', 'think', 'whole', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'subtly', 'done', 'mean', 'Linney', 'character', 'named', 'Annabeth', 'crying', 'out', 'loud']",N/A

Watching this film I felt as if I was watching a dark daytime soap opera. There is nothing creative about this film at all. You'd think that Eastwood would have picked up a few things in his youth from working with Sergio Leone.Sean Penn gives a very dry performance. I just didn't feel anything in his character. Kevin Bacon is the same Kevin Bacon in every movie. Tim Robbins is just way over the top. His character goes from not even being albe to think strait one moment to Kevin Spacey from the Usual Suspects the next. I didn't mind Lawrence Fishbourne though. Usually I can't stand him but in this film he's probably the most convincing.The only thing I found interesting in this film was Eastwoods decision to cast his old buddy Eli Wallach as the aged liqoure store clerk. I love Eli Wallach. It's funny to see him cast as a store clerk who was robbed. Though this was a too obvious attempt at irony. For those of you who've seen The Good The Bad And The Ugly you'll remember the scene where his character Tuco robbs an aged store clerk. The scene even plays like a an old spaghetti western scene where a bar tender or hotel owner is being questioned by a sheriff or a bounty hunter of some sort.This film gets one star for Eastwood casting Eli Wallach.

819144,A2EL3990HXOMZB,B0001ZX0OC,Antonio Robert,"[3, 7]","""Mystic River"" is not an easy film to watch and to understand -- particularly actions of some characters. This is a movie about how complicated creature a man (or a woman, for that matter) is and how unpredictable his actions are at times.Director Clint Eastwood has another potent film under his belt, following his western homage ""Unforgiven"" and classic romance ""The Bridges of Madison County"", to name a few. This time, he deals with how child trauma can affect people after many years -- even witnesses, not only those hit directly -- and how a small East Coast city unofficial laws often recall those of wild wild west.The story finds three friends a few decades after an appalling thing happens to one of them while the two are left with the question: what if it was me...? After years, the one of the two has to cope with murder of his first-born daughter and the other is a policeman assigned with the case. The third one -- the very victim of child molestation years ago -- is a suspect...The film has a haunting atmosphere -- the script was written by L.A. Confidential's Brian Helgeland -- but the screenplay here is not so action-packed, rather elegiac, yet suspense abounds.Clint Eastwood also wrote the main music motive for the film, which indicates that it must have been a labour of love -- the score may not be the main asset of the film, but works still. And it should, indeed -- Eastwood's cast is splendid. Sean Penn shines as Jimmy Markum in his ruggedly emotional, dynamic portrait of revengeful father. Tim Robbins is convincing as Dave Boyle, the man haunted by horrible past, as is Marcia Gay Harden as his frightened wife. Kevin Bacon with his stony face is also a good choice for policeman Sean Devine, whose seemingly neat life also has some painful deep currents. And Laura Linney (playing Annabeth Markum) almost steals the show at the end in a spine-tingling scene with Penn.Despite the obvious film quality certainly worthy of many awards, the movie displays eloquent violence in some of its key scenes. But it has its considerable visual poetry and Eastwood's directing is trademark. The picture drags a bit in the second half, yet the multilayered ending makes it well worth the wait.",4,Eastwood's New England Crime Story,1071187200,"12 12, 2003",2003,2220,"['Mystic', 'River', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'understand', 'particularly', 'actions', 'characters', 'movie', 'how', 'complicated', 'creature', 'man', 'woman', 'matter', 'how', 'unpredictable', 'actions', 'are', 'times.Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'potent', 'film', 'belt', 'following', 'western', 'homage', 'Unforgiven', 'classic', 'romance', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'name', 'few', 'time', 'how', 'child', 'trauma', 'can', 'affect', 'people', 'many', 'years', 'even', 'witnesses', 'not', 'only', 'hit', 'directly', 'how', 'small', 'East', 'Coast', 'city', 'unofficial', 'laws', 'often', 'recall', 'wild', 'wild', 'west.The', 'story', 'three', 'few', 'decades', 'appalling', 'thing', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'left', 'question', 'what', 'was', 'years', 'one', 'two', 'cope', 'murder', 'first-born', 'daughter', 'other', 'policeman', 'assigned', 'case', 'third', 'one', 'very', 'victim', 'child', 'molestation', 'years', 'ago', 'suspect', 'film', 'haunting', 'atmosphere', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'screenplay', 'here', 'not', 'so', 'action-packed', 'rather', 'elegiac', 'suspense', 'abounds.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'also', 'wrote', 'main', 'music', 'motive', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'labour', 'love', 'score', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'main', 'asset', 'film', 'still', 'should', 'indeed', 'Eastwood', 'cast', 'splendid', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'shines', 'Jimmy', 'Markum', 'ruggedly', 'emotional', 'dynamic', 'portrait', 'revengeful', 'father', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'convincing', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'man', 'haunted', 'horrible', 'past', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'frightened', 'wife', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'stony', 'face', 'also', 'good', 'choice', 'policeman', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'seemingly', 'neat', 'life', 'also', 'painful', 'deep', 'currents', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'playing', 'Annabeth', 'Markum', 'almost', 'show', 'end', 'spine-tingling', 'scene', 'Penn.Despite', 'obvious', 'film', 'quality', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'many', 'awards', 'movie', 'eloquent', 'violence', 'key', 'scenes', 'considerable', 'visual', 'poetry', 'Eastwood', 'directing', 'trademark', 'picture', 'bit', 'second', 'half', 'multilayered', 'ending', 'well', 'wait']",N/A

819148,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,B0001ZX0OC,Barry C. Chow,"[17, 22]","""Mystic River"" aspires to transcend its genre so boldly that I found myself overwhelmed by its audacity. Those who expect a plot driven murder mystery or a crime story will be sorely disappointed. In this film, the plot recedes into insignificance. Like all great works of art, the heart and soul of this work is not its plot, but its characters and its themes. The result is one of the most powerful explorations of tragedy to come out of modern cinema.Clint Eastwood has crafted a film of unique scope, examining multifaceted aspects of tragedy with a mix of depth and simplicity that, on the one hand, relentlessly examines themes of sin, guilt, victimization and vengeance, while on the other, combines directing and acting so clean and uncluttered that we are not so much audiences to a narrative as we are witnesses to broken lives.This film cannot be approached lightly. It is unsparing in its intensity. Characters are trapped in the arc of tragedy as inevitably as in a Greek play, unrelieved by either redemption or reprieve. The darkness of the story does not result from some self-indulgent existential auteurism. Rather, it arises out of an uncompromising sense of authenticity. Eastwood takes this tragedy to its honest conclusion and does not give in to the Hollywood hankering for happy endings. This is an intelligent film for mature people who refuse to put up with cop-outs.The acting is nothing short of inspiring. Sean Penn is unforgettable as a tormented Jimmy who claws his way out of evil through the love of his daughter, only to sink back deeper than ever in the aftermath of her murder. Tim Robbins, in a similarly pitch-perfect performance, is tormented by even crueller demons, and never finds any sort of relief, save for transient moments of grace with his son. Kevin Bacon gives a subtle and restrained performance as a cop who acts as our disjointed moral sense, never sure of guilt or innocence, counting on the law to separate good from evil, and silently praying that that will prove sufficient. The supporting women, from Laura Linney to Marcia Gay Harden turn in performances in every way equal to those of the lead male characters. Character flaws abound, suspicion builds to blind fury, events unfold and vengeance compounds into tragedy until we arrive at an ending nothing short of Shakespearean.It's a shame that the typical film synopsis leaves the impression that this is another who-dunnit. This film is no more about story than ""Hamlet"" is just about some guy out to catch his father's murderer. In both cases, focusing on the plot is to entirely miss the point. This film is a modern work of art, sharing a deeper kinship to masterful psychological studies like ""Heart of Darkness"" or ""Crime and Punishment"" than to any crime story.

I went to see it because the cast that director Clint Eastwood assembled is incredible, and the story is motivated by character-rooted actions and decisions.Still, I was underwhelmed by MYSTIC RIVER.Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant playing a neighborhood ex-con who becomes a successful businessman, yet he cannot escape his past when his daughter is brutally murdered. It's a role that seems like the sort of part Penn has played well before, yet there are layers to his character that are fascinating to watch. Still, at the same time, his character Jimmy never really surprised me with any of his actions. I saw where the film was pretty much going from its opening moments, and it went exactly in that direction.Tim Robbins, playing an adult survivor of a childhood abduction and molestation, does incredibly well at creating a suspicious yet sympathetic character. He, though, is also saddled with a plot contrivance that was brought in from the book, where he doesn't share crucial information at a point when you would expect him to, even when he can. That's an incredibly frustrating thing to watch in any film, where you feel that the characters are withholding information merely to service the film's plot.Kevin Bacon, playing the third lead character, has far less to do in the film. He's saddled with a strangely-filmed subplot involving his wife, who calls on the phone throughout the film but doesn't speak and whose face is never shown. His character, as well, isn't as well-rounded as the other leads.In supporting roles, the amazing Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden play the spouses of men caught up in a bizarre murder mystery. Linney's closing speech at the end of the film is so good that I wished the film had more moments with her in them. Harden's final scene is compelling and heartbreaking.All in all, I thought MYSTIC RIVER was an incredibly acted, flawed mystery film.",4,"Good acting, interesting story.

No. Do the ""bad guys"" pay? No. It is difficult for me to say just how much this movie sucks without giving away the ending. Suffice to say that no one wins, innocent people get screwed over, and in the end - no one really learns anything.

In contrast, ""Mystic River"" has enough of a plot to keep things moving, and it's interesting.Second, you must have a good script.  Oftentimes ""character-driven"" movies are tedious at best, because the characters have nothing to say.  Here, the screenwriter really created some memorable characters and great dialogue.  I am sure that Robbins, Bacon and Penn had a lot to do with that, too.That leads into point three - you must have great actors to breathe life into your characters, when your characters are your movie.

This elite cast is directed by Clint Eastwood.  The story is meaty and suspenseful.  Can't miss, right?It can and does miss, in my opinion.  What makes it just miss is an acting fundamental that most did not pay attention to, and that is diction and enunciation.  These actors use sotto voce too much, fake Boston accents with varying degrees of accuracy and precision, and generally speak as though they have a mouth full of marbles.  I had to turn my TV volume to 48 to hear some of the dialogue.  That dialogue is usually important in a movie or play, and in this film, it is critical.  As any high school drama teacher will tell you...if the audience can't hear you, you are cheating them.This is generally the only mar on an otherwise fine film.  All of the actors turn in very good performances, particularly Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Marcia Gay Harden.  Robbins plays David Boyle, a man who cannot escape the horror and trauma of his rape by pedophiles at a young age.  He carries himself with sadness, and his internal rage and confusion show in his face and body.  His wife Celeste is capably played by Marcia Gay Harden.  Her fear grows as she comes to believe that her husband may have murdered a 19 year old girl. In a panic, she turns to the murdered girl's father (Jimmy) and tells him that she believes that her husband is the killer.  In this scene of ultimate betrayal, Harden is at her best.  We see it all...relief to have unburdened herself, but guilt and fear knowing that she has likely signed the death warrant of her own husband.  Finally, there is Sean Penn's portrayal of Jimmy.  Jimmy is an ex-con, who lost a wife as he was going to prison, and then loses the daughter of that wife. He is a man trying desperately to hold it together and operate within the legal rules of society.  In the end, his desire for street thug retribution wins out, and his guilt is palpable.  Penn turns in a great performance.So, the movie basically goes from 5 stars to 3 stars because a director didn't insist on clear speech.

At its core it is a murder mystery, but one that is shrouded by a tragedy that befalls the three main characters as young boys.  The movie starts when Jimmy Markam, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle are small boys playing in the street.  Jimmy, the ""hard case"" of the bunch entices his pals to write their name in wet cement where the sidewalk is being repaired.  Two men posing as cops drive up and abduct the boy that seems to be the most weak willed - Dave.  Dave is abused but eventually escapes.  These episode forever changes the lives of all three.Years later Jimmy's daughter is murdered brutally and the mystery behind her death is shrouded by a confluence of events that bring the three together again but in a rather odd fashion.  Sean is now a cop, Jimmy an ex-con, and Dave obviously behaves a bit oddly as a result of his boyhood trauma.  The mystery that emerges and the triangle between these three men is very well directed and acted.

819168,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0001ZX0OC,C. B Collins Jr.,"[7, 8]","There are several outstanding features of Mystic River; the superb acting by the three male lead actors, the twisted unfolding plot, and the underlying theme of revenge and justice. I will discuss all three below.You can not beat Sean Penn's acting in this film. He portrays a rough man of the streets, trying to hold a family together and run a business, in a working class blue-collar neighborhood. He is fully alive in this role, as protective father seeking the murderer of his elder daughter while simultaneously dealing with his intense grief. His wife, Laura Lenney, describes him best in the final minutes of the film, when she emotionally absolves him of the murder of a childhood friend he mistakenly believes killed his daughter. She evokes the Jungian archtype of the king as she tells him he is a king who protects his family and home and that he acted on the best evidence he had, even if that evidence is flawed.Tim Robbins was amazing as the odd adult male who is still damaged by the childhood rapes he endures for 4 days at the hands of two male pediophiles. He now sees himself as a child continually trying to escape from the werewolves, which are the memories of the molestation he experienced. His oddity however marks him as a suspect for the murder of a 19 year old girl.Kevin Bacon plays the tight competent policman, trying to control his emotions under all circumstances when we see evidence that this strategy drove his wife from him.The story-line unfolds gradually, tragedy after tragedy, misunderstanding after misunderstanding, like a house of cards falling apart in slow motion. The interaction of the three main actors form the structure around which all the tragedy flows. Clint Eastwood paced this film very well, never rushing and never boring the audience.Underlying the plot however is the themes of justice, revenge, and our connectedness in a web of relationships. The film asks whether justice can ever be obtained and is it right to take justice into our own hands. In this case we see two men try to take justice into their own hands, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, and the tragedy that unfolds because of that.However the film also displays our interconnectedness in that the dynamics of the tragedy are in the past and the tragedy continues into the future. As you watch, notice how much the murder of Just Ray by Sean Penn sets up the dynamic whereby Sean refuses to have his daughter date the son of Just Ray - a dynamic that begins the current tragedy of his daughter's death. So it is not just the molestation of Tim Robbin's character that sets the stage, it is also Sean Penn's murder of an old friend who betrays him that sets in play the death of his own daughter. On the day of her funeral, Sean Penn sits on his backporch, and addressing the trees and spirit of his daughter he says ""I know that somehow I am responsible for your death, but I don't know how.""  The film reveals to him and to us  how he was responsible.The film does not end on happy note, for Sean Penn kills again and this time it is a damaged man, also a secret killer. In the final scenes a softball parade goes through town, the characters lock eyes, knowing that an impure justice has occurred with which they all must live and the young son of the deceased Tim Robbins, sitting on a float in his softball uniform, implies that it will cycle through again, unresolved, because justice and revenge are structures of human interaction and relationship, not absolutes.",5,A film about impure justice and misguided revenge,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,3489,"['are', 'several', 'outstanding', 'features', 'Mystic', 'River', 'superb', 'acting', 'three', 'male', 'lead', 'actors', 'twisted', 'unfolding', 'plot', 'underlying', 'theme', 'revenge', 'justice', 'will', 'discuss', 'three', 'below.You', 'can', 'not', 'beat', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'acting', 'film', 'rough', 'man', 'streets', 'trying', 'hold', 'family', 'together', 'run', 'business', 'working', 'class', 'blue-collar', 'neighborhood', 'fully', 'alive', 'role', 'protective', 'father', 'seeking', 'murderer', 'elder', 'daughter', 'simultaneously', 'dealing', 'intense', 'grief', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Lenney', 'best', 'final', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'emotionally', 'murder', 'childhood', 'friend', 'mistakenly', 'killed', 'daughter', 'Jungian', 'archtype', 'king', 'king', 'who', 'family', 'home', 'acted', 'best', 'evidence', 'had', 'even', 'evidence', 'flawed.Tim', 'Robbins', 'was', 'amazing', 'odd', 'adult', 'male', 'who', 'still', 'damaged', 'childhood', '4', 'days', 'hands', 'two', 'male', 'pediophiles', 'now', 'child', 'continually', 'trying', 'escape', 'werewolves', 'are', 'memories', 'molestation', 'experienced', 'oddity', 'however', 'suspect', 'murder', '19', 'year', 'old', 'girl.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'tight', 'competent', 'policman', 'trying', 'control', 'emotions', 'circumstances', 'when', 'see', 'evidence', 'strategy', 'drove', 'wife', 'him.The', 'story-line', 'unfolds', 'gradually', 'tragedy', 'tragedy', 'misunderstanding', 'misunderstanding', 'house', 'cards', 'falling', 'apart', 'slow', 'motion', 'interaction', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'form', 'structure', 'tragedy', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'paced', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'never', 'rushing', 'never', 'boring', 'audience.Underlying', 'plot', 'however', 'themes', 'justice', 'revenge', 'connectedness', 'web', 'relationships', 'film', 'justice', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'obtained', 'right', 'take', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'case', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'try', 'take', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'tragedy', 'that.However', 'film', 'also', 'interconnectedness', 'dynamics', 'tragedy', 'are', 'past', 'tragedy', 'future', 'watch', 'notice', 'how', 'much', 'murder', 'Just', 'Ray', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'up', 'dynamic', 'whereby', 'Sean', 'have', 'daughter', 'date', 'son', 'Just', 'Ray', 'dynamic', 'current', 'tragedy', 'daughter', 'death', 'not', 'just', 'molestation', 'Tim', 'Robbin', 'character', 'stage', 'also', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'murder', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'sets', 'play', 'death', 'own', 'daughter', 'day', 'funeral', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'backporch', 'addressing', 'trees', 'spirit', 'daughter', 'know', 'somehow', 'am', 'responsible', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'film', 'reveals', 'how', 'was', 'responsible.The', 'film', 'not', 'end', 'happy', 'note', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'again', 'time', 'damaged', 'man', 'also', 'secret', 'killer', 'final', 'scenes', 'softball', 'parade', 'town', 'characters', 'lock', 'eyes', 'knowing', 'impure', 'justice', 'occurred', 'must', 'live', 'young', 'son', 'deceased', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'sitting', 'float', 'softball', 'uniform', 'will', 'cycle', 'again', 'unresolved', 'justice', 'revenge', 'are', 'structures', 'human', 'interaction', 'relationship', 'not']",N/A

""cscotts""","[5, 6]","One of the most critically received films of 2003, MYSTIC RIVER came across to me like a fairly diverting murder mystery dressed up as a ""prestige"" film, the latter fact more thanks in large part to the pedigree of the cast and the film's director than the assumption that it's a great movie(it,in fact,is not).  The central plot revolves around the murder of Sean Penn's daughter in the film, which ultimately reunites him with two childhood friends, played as adults by Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. There are flaws throughout the film, not the least being that it's very slow going throughout.  The other major misstep for me was the use of Laura Linney's character, seen very little thoughout the movie, but then brought on at the end like something out of a Greek tragedy to convince Penn that he should take his rightful place as a ""king""--I'm sorry, what?  I'm going to make a very big assumption that there is more to the Linney character in the book(which I have not read) and leave it at that.  Still, the acting is fairly seamless across the board--Penn is excellent, though frankly was better in 21 GRAMS, but fellow Oscar winner Robbins' performance didn't move me whatsoever.  The two best performances for me were from Marcia Gay Harden(as Robbins' conflicted wife) and Bacon(who makes understatement a perfected art here).

The idea here is, three boys in their pre-pubescent ages were best friends until a particular incident led to assault and abuse by horrid people disguised as police officers, and then we are led to many years later, all of them with a history and grown apart.  Sean Penn is the owner of a liquor store/convenience store in the heart of Boston, Tim Robbins is a married loner, who is a bit slow and a bit messed up, and Kevin Bacon is a detective.  Meanwhile, Sean Penn's daughter is out on the town with a few friends barhopping, when suddenly she goes missing, and is found dead, and the evidence all points to the same man, Tim Robbins!  We are carried into a web of a man distraught, using any bounds possible to find the killer of his daughter, a detective trying his best to follow the rules and find the killer for his former friend, and the emotional loner, unfairly pigeonholed as the killer.  As we wind down we are brought to a sad and shocking ending...This type of movie has been done before.  I'm not going to make believe this is some sort of original situation, but the incredible acting by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins touches at all your emotions.  Kevin Bacon is still great as the detective, Laura Linney is great as Jimmy's overbearing wife, and Marcia Gay Harden is impressive as Dave's submissive wife.  All the characters are terribly realistic, and human, and that's what makes this movie great.  There are no super heroes here.  And furthermore, this movie touches upon the ongoing violence occurring with teenagers.

If the score wasn't so sappy and some of the editing wasn't so 'made for TV movie,' Mystic River could have had a chance at being the best film of 2003. First and foremost, the ensemble cast is just incredible. Sean Penn and Tim Ribbons are the big dogs as two emotionally disturbed men who use violence as a way to heal past harms. Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne are terrific as two Boston staties on the search for the murderer of Penn's daughter. Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden round out the A-List cast as cousins who are the wives of Penn and Robbins respectively, strongly contrasting emotionally. The story, based on a book by Dennis Lehane, is not far off from an episode of CSI, but it plays out in an unmistakably cinematic and melancholy fashion that elevates it from simple TV drama.

While this is not egregious in melodrama, it is so in drama. Yet, a large portion of film today is pure melodrama. I think of highly lauded films like Michael Mann's Heat as melodrama incarnate.Another truism in regard to films is that actors turned directors tend to not be very good. Mel Gibson, Ron Howard, and Kevin Costner (Academy Award winners in direction) come to mind, as does Clint Eastwood (another Oscar winner). Perhaps the only actor-cum-director who has proven his chops artistically, though, is Woody Allen, although he was really a stand up comedian, not an actor. Actors tend to direct very ham-handedly, with static camera work, and no real sense of film's visual aspect, and even less skill at understanding what constitutes good story structure. Eastwood is very much in this vein. In his highly lauded Mystic River Eastwood shows that he has everything it takes to direct tv movies of the week, but not serious art. This film is larded with poorly framed scenes, bad lighting, very pedestrian angles, color-strained, as well as bad performances, a horridly unrealistic script, banal music, and too many red herrings.... There are some nice touches- like abused Dave's name drying half-finished in the cement, but they are too little in depth and too few. More often the script, by Brian Helgeland, merely allows wallowing for the actors, and denies them any real chance to show real emotion. Like the poor In The Bedroom, Mystic River had a chance to be an adult meditation on grief, rather than a plot reject from a 1970s cop tv show like Kojack or Starsky And Hutch.The basic problem is that most moviegoers simply do not understand nor appreciate good writing- everything is homogenized down into a lowest common denominator plot mulch. I've read other critics state that Eastwood is a jazzy director, in that he tends to just riff. Well, maybe so in other films but in this one he's at his Director's 101 worst.

The character of Jimmy, who's daughter was murdered, is very unlikeable. He is basically an ex-con with a very shady past, who associates with thugs. He gave me the creeps.I agree with another reviewer: Might does not make right. Also, Dave is pitiful enough, and I empathised with him for all the horror he went through as a child, but he seemed rather dim-witted. Didn't his parents ever tell him not to get in a car with strangers? And why didn't his friends try to help him, like tell him to run? I didn't think that excused what he did later as an adult, and despite other's opinions, I don't blame his wife in the least for not trusting him and being afraid of him, but she would've been wiser going to the police instead of a thug like Jimmy with her suspicions.As for Sean, he was the most likeable up to a point, until you find out what a corrupt cop he is or maybe just too wimpy and intimidated by Jimmy to do what's right in the end. It seemed like the two of them were agianst Dave from the beginning. This story was disturbing at the most, and very disappointing. There are numerous crime movies that are better with more likeable and believable characters.

819190,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,B0001ZX0OC,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[8, 12]","It is said the further the Irish get from the holy soil of Erin the crazier they get.  Since the immigrations from Ireland following the Great Hunger, there are more ""Irish"" in America than there are in the Emerald Isle.  Given that most ""Irish"" families have been American families for several generations now and the high rate of marriage with members of other ethnic groups, it is of some note that customs and attitudes from the old country persist.  All three main characters are sons of Ireland living in the New World.  .  But their ""Irishness"" is also not an accident.  Others liken MYSTIC RIVER to a cinematic dissection of middle class life.  But this misses the point.  Instead of keeping the people in this film at a distance and offering contempt for modern American life, MYSTIC RIVER holds these men in sympathy and respect while mediating on the theme of justice.There are three notions of justice working themselves out in the imponderables of the murder of a teenage girl.  Sean is a policeman who works in a world of correct processes, written and codified rules, and a system of rights created to replace the justice of revenge and ""eye for an eye"".  Crimes are no longer committed against an individual but are transgressions against the modern civil society itself.  Civil justice replaces the hot-blooded execution of revenge with the detached, cool tempered administration of law.  Civil law is seen as more rational and humane-replacing the perpetual war between clans.  Families and individuals cannot be trusted to carry out ""justice"" because their real interest lies in personal vindication and protection for which there are no clear limits in pursuing those ends.  Civil justice labors to protect the accused from miscarriages of justice-swearing it is better 10 guilty go free than to wrongly punish one innocent.  The dark side of civil justice is that the guilty frequently escape punishment.Much older is the unwritten code of tribal justice.  This justice is so old that it seems bred into the bone--appearing almost phantomlike from the deep forests of primordial memory.  It is blood for blood.  Wound for wound.  Tribal justice sees revenge not as an evil but a duty full-blooded men and women must fulfill.  Taking revenge is a sacred duty that sates personal rage and is an obligation.  Honor must be defended.  The blood of a loved one must not be spilt without vindicating his memory.  But wrong blood may be spilt.  The innocent may be punished.  The guilty may be punished beyond measure.  Vindication and revenge often stop at nothing.  Yet in spite of all the advances in the administration of civil justice, it is the rare human being who does not hear the call of tribal justice.But there is another justice that is unnamable and more savage at work in spite of the efforts and safeguards of human justice.  Call it karma or fate, there is a far older, ancient justice ineffable to human understanding.  It is a power that flows into the lives of men and women from some unknown place whose purposes are never understood but rules far more ruthlessly and pitilessly than we can withstand.  Like a mighty river, it cannot be stopped; yet the smallest gestures can change its course.MYSTIC RIVER is a tale of these three modes of justice weaving in and out.  Sean the policeman knows of the revenge murders Jimmy has committed yet keeps these secrets to himself.  Jimmy experiences crippling guilt after carrying out revenge only to find out it was the wrong man.  A horrendous crime has ruined Dave's life-but neither civil nor tribal justice provided vindication-so his past drives him insane.  Several times during the story, characters ask themselves ""what if I had done something different long ago"" questions.  But these questions are unanswerable and cannot change the past.  At end of the movie, primordial righteousness has wrecked its justice in the lives of Sean, Dave and Jimmy.  In an odd way, everything has been put aright.  The price of justice is far too high; but it will be paid and not always to our betterment.  Against heartless fate, we can only tender apologies, ask for forgiveness, and offer absolution.  More surely than justice, these change hearts and afford mercy.Sean does not act against Jimmy's crimes because they were not done with ""criminal"" intent.  Jimmy was carrying out the demands of tribal justice and not merely to advance his own self-interest.  Sean is all too aware of the imperfections of civil justice.  The biggest thieves are honored while the little thieves are left to rot in prison all their days.  Sean does not justify what Jimmy did; but he will not destroy and further damage the effected families and community just to satisfy the demands of civil justice.Likewise, Jimmy's wife responds to his crimes with love and forgiveness because she sees Jimmy's great heart and love for his family.  As she says, Jimmy is a king and a king must do what he must.  If he made a mistake it was out of love and not malice.  She clings to Jimmy because she trusts his heart.Dave's wife has no such fortune.  She has no such ground to cling to Dave.  She cannot trust either his motives or his word.  His crime redeemes no one and does not vindicate anything more than his own personal demons.  While we have sympathy for him, Dave's own madness destroys him and threatens to take down all whom he loves.The mysterious justice symbolized by the Mystic River rolled on and has done its work.  Its justice is inexplicable and unsettling.  Its judgments are final and undisclosed to us.  Yet in the face of all this, the most powerful words spoken are ""I want you to know I'm sorry"" by Sean.  And it is these words that bring his life out of unhappiness into a new and gentle place.",5,TO LOVE MERCY MORE THAN JUSTICE,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,5768,"['said', 'further', 'Irish', 'get',

819193,A2G0KS2DQPFI9U,B0001ZX0OC,"cybergel78 ""cybergel""","[5, 5]","This film is all about the actors. The premise, or so it is called, is paper-thin. Any hallmark tv movie can beat that to it. Instead of devolving into a mundane murder mystery, this film adds a new dimension right from the beginning. Three childhood friends playing on the streets of their small provincial town nearly got absconded by two pedophiles in a car. One of them was not that lucky, Dave (adult role played by Tim Robbins).Dave escaped four days later but was so traumatized by the event, he remained a ""basket case"" for the rest of his life. His wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden), being insecure and overly suspicious, didn't help matters either.The Macguffin of this film which inevitably draws all three childhood friends together was the murder of Jimmy's (Sean Penn) 19 year old daughter, played by a pre-Phantom of the Opera Emmy Rossum. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is the investigating officer for the case. Somehow or rather, through a series of incredible coincidences, Dave became a prime suspect and...I don't wish to spoil the ending. But for those who have seen the film, read on. In a way, all of the main characters contributed to Dave's death in the end. Although Jimmy was physically responsible, Celeste was indirectly responsible, for telling Jimmy about Dave, Sean and his Sergeant (a dominant Laurence Fishburne) for placing their suspicions on Dave. In a way, Dave is this sad little tragic Greek figure in a tragedy where fate has sealed his destiny and despite himself, he cannot save himself from the inevitable.In closing, I would like to point out that Laura Linney's character deserved special mention. Even though, she barely had any screentime, 10 minutes or so, her last scene shared with Sean Penn, evoked such powerful emotions that she reminded me of Lady Macbeth, in a conniving manner, using subterfuge, she convinced Jimmy that what he had done (murdering Dave) was the right and moral thing to do, using reasons such as protecting his family and domain as ""what a king would do"", those were her exact words. This was followed by a parade sequence where she and Marcia's character would exchange wordless glances that speaks all.

I wanted to say that first because it's such a hollywood tradition to drastically change a novel when creating a film adaptation that they rape it of everything that made it special in the beginning.  I'm glad to hear that Eastwood did not do that to Dennis Lehane's masterpiece (or so I hear that it is a wonderfull novel)  That said, I was surprised at how well this movie was done.  I mean, when a film is that glorified it better be perfect, and I really was expecting to be let down, but to my shock I was not, not at all.  The acting I must admitt was amazing, especially on the part of Tim Robbins who plays Dave Boyle, the grown man still trapped in the mind of the child he once was.  The story revolves around three friends years after one of them was molested.  That one was Dave.  Now they are all grown and have moved on.  Jimmy Markham (Penn) is a one time crook (or is it one time) who is now married and has a beautiful daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum from Phantom of the Opera).  Dave is also married to Marcia Gay Harden's charactor and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) is now a police detective.  All three of these men have rarly kept in touch (especially Kevin Bacon's charactor) but are all forced to interact after Jimmy's daughter is brutally murdered, Dave becomes the prime suspect and Sean has to investigate.  The story itself is gripping and the whole charactor study was wonderfully exicuted.  Both Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden did wonderful jobs as supporting and yet greiving wives, one as she deals with the loss of a daughter and the other while she struggles with the idea that her husband is a killer.

It truly lived up to the hype that had surrounded it for the months that I failed to see it in the theaters.  Flawlessly directed by Clint Eastwood, _Mystic River_ has all of its bases covered-great filmmaking, directing, script, actors, etc.  In the end, however, this movie comes down to the quality of the acting.  Everyone is in this film.  And I mean everyone.  While Sean Penn steals the show in my book, his character has to compete with Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney.  Everyone does a superb job and together they create a film that will quickly become a classic.Many have knocked the film for its ""unsatisfying"" ending.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  One has to wonder what these audience members expected-a happy, Hollywood ending where everyone joins hands and dances around the Maypole?  Had _Mystic River_ fallen to these stale devices, the film would have blown up and taken hits for wasting all of its potential.In my opinion, faulting this film for not having a ""satisfying"" ending is just to fundamentally disagree about what ""satisfying"" entails.  If you want a ""popcorn"" flick that satisfies your desire to turn off your heart for ninety minutes, do not rent this film-it will not ""satisfy"" you.  But if you want an original film with a compelling storyline and complex morality, this film definitely ""satisfies.""  The emotions in this film are real.  The actors are real.  The performances are real.  Robbins haunting performance at the end of the film is real.  Are there loose ends?  Yeah.  Does the film leave you wondering?  Sure.  Is it a happy ending?  No way.

She spends the whole episode trying to figure it out the mystery.  I watch the opening moments, meet all the characters, and think about it for a moment and of course I call the outcome 90% of the time.  It doesn't mean that I don't enjoy sitting through a good mystery.  It's just after a while it becomes more difficult for me not to figure out what happens in the end.That's the problem I had with Clint Eastwood's (Blood Work) new film MYSTIC RIVER. It's a riveting and tense thriller, it's one of the best films of year and of course I went and ruined it for myself by figuring out the outcome about an hour before the movie ended.  Was it the ""Old Economy of Characters"" that made it so easy? Not really!  I think it's just the film has one logical ending and if you miss the clues you'll kick yourself in the head.The story follows three friends in South Boston.  They are Jimmy (Sean Penn, I Am Sam), Dave (Tim Robbins, Bob Roberts), and Sean (Kevin Bacon, Wild Things).  As kids, Dave was kidnapped and raped by some guys dressed liked cops, they kept him in a dirty cellar for four years until he escaped. He got home but he never quite recovered.  Jimmy grew up to be a petty thief, served two years in prison, and is now a legitimate shopkeeper is his neighborhood, and Sean is now a detective with a marriage that's almost non-existent.  These three friends are forced to come to grips with their friendship when Jimmy's daughter (Emmy Rossum, Songcatcher) winds up murdered.MYSTIC RIVER is about the sins of our past, mistaken identities, and those small moments that change our lives forever.  It's about what ties us all together, how we face our demons, and the bonds of friendship and family.  It's also about flawed people forced to face the demons.  It's probably the best-acted film I've seen all year.Sean Penn gives the performance of a lifetime.  I finally forgive him for the travesty that was I AM SAM and I'm hoping that he moves on as well.  There is a powerful moment, as he must tell his wife (Laura Linney, The Life of David Gale) that his daughter (From a first marriage) is dead.  The two of them look at each other for a moment and then embrace.  This kind of scene is very rarely powerful, in most films it's almost laughable, but all I could think was ""Wow!""  For once it wasn't mucked up.  For once a director allowed raw power to move a scene and not harsh swelling music.Clint Eastwood has proved once again that with the right material he can direct a film that is smart and well told.  He has a very shaky track record, for every UNFORGIVEN, there are messes like TRUE CRIME and BLOOD WORK.  MYSTIC RIVER is better than UNFORGIVEN, but these two films will be considered classics.I liked MYSTIC RIVER.  I liked how it unfolded.  I just wish I could have shut my brain down because I hate it when I call the end of a good mystery.  It reminded me of the moment when I called the end of THE OTHERS.  Of course I loved the film, but I felt cheated by my own cleverness.  I sometimes wish I could enjoy a movie like the masses.  But since I can't,  I will sing MYSTIC RIVER'S praises, and beseech the Academy to nominate Penn for this performance, he deserves it.So, If you're looking for a taught thriller with lots of mystery give MYSTIC RIVER a chance.  It's well worth two hours of your time.****1/2  (out of 5)",5,A Powerful Modern Classic!!,1066262400,"10 16, 2003",2003,3411,"['Fianc', 'eacute', 'like', 'watch', 'LAW', 'ORDER', 'TV', 'whole', 'episode', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'watch', 'opening', 'moments', 'meet', 'characters', 'think', 'moment', 'course', 'call', 'outcome', '90', '%', 'time', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'sitting', 'good', 'mystery', 'just', 'while', 'more', 'difficult', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'end.That', 'problem', 'had', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Blood', 'Work', 'new', 'film', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'riveting', 'tense', 'thriller', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'course', 'went', 'ruined', 'figuring', 'out', 'outcome', 'hour', 'movie', 'ended', 'Was', 'Old', 'Economy', 'Characters', 'made', 'easy', 'Not', 'really', 'think', 'just', 'film', 'one', 'logical', 'ending', 'miss', 'clues', ""'ll"", 'kick', 'head.The', 'story', 'three', 'friends', 'South', 'Boston', 'are', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Am', 'Sam', 'Dave', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Bob', 'Roberts', 'Sean', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Wild', 'Things', 'kids', 'Dave', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'raped', 'guys', 'dressed', 'liked', 'cops', 'kept', 'dirty', 'cellar', 'four', 'years', 'escaped', 'got', 'home', 'never', 'quite', 'recovered', 'Jimmy', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'petty', 'thief', 'served', 'two', 'years', 'prison', 'now', 'legitimate', 'shopkeeper', 'neighborhood', 'Sean', 'now', 'detective', 'marriage', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'forced', 'come', 'grips', 'friendship', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Songcatcher', 'up', 'murdered.MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'sins', 'past', 'mistaken', 'identities', 'small', 'moments', 'change', 'lives', 'forever', 'what', 'ties', 'together', 'how', 'face', 'demons', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'family', 'also', 'about', 'flawed', 'people', 'forced', 'face', 'demons', 'probably', 'best-acted', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.Sean', 'Penn', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'finally', 'forgive', 'travesty', 'was', 'AM', 'SAM', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'as', 'well', 'powerful', 'moment', 'must', 'tell', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Life', 'David', 'Gale', 'daughter', 'first', 'marriage', 'dead', 'two', 'look', 'other', 'moment', 'then', 'embrace', 'kind', 'scene', 'very', 'rarely', 'powerful', 'most', 'films', 'almost', 'laughable', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'Wow', 'was', ""n't"", 'mucked', 'up', 'once', 'director', 'allowed', 'raw', 'power', 'move', 'scene', 'not', 'harsh', 'swelling', 'music.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'proved', 'once', 'again', 'right', 'material', 'can', 'direct', 'film', 'smart', 'well', 'told', 'very', 'shaky', 'track', 'record', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'are', 'messes', 'TRUE', 'CRIME', 'BLOOD', 'WORK', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'better', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'two', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'classics.I', 'liked', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'liked', 'how', 'unfolded', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'shut', 'brain', 'hate', 'when', 'call', 'end', 'good', 'mystery', 'reminded', 'moment', 'when', 'called', 'end', 'THE', 'OTHERS', 'course', 'loved', 'film', 'felt', 'cheated', 'own', 'cleverness', 'sometimes', 'wish', 'could', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'masses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'will', 'sing', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'praises', 'beseech', 'Academy', 'nominate', 'Penn', 'performance', 'it.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'taught', 'thriller', 'lots', 'mystery', 'give', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'chance', 'well', 'worth', 'two', 'hours', 'time', '****1/2', '5']",N/A

Penn as Jimmy the family minded gangster puts in a magnificent performance, easily the best work I have seen from him.  Robbins as the haunted Dave, who struggles to overcome child abuse tears at you throughout.  Many of the scenes captivate you as you helplessly watch the tragedy unfold, Dave's face looking back from the car window is a graphic example.

819202,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B0001ZX0OC,David E. Levine,"[0, 0]","Clint Eastwood recently won the Oscar for best director in Million Dollar Baby and, in this earlier effort, he showed how superb he is. He had won an Oscar also, in 1992, for Unforgiven and this movie was snadwiched between the two and, truthfully, was as solid an effort as the other two were. Meanwhile, both Sean Penn, winning best actor, and Tim Robbins, winning best supporting actor, were totally convincing. The odd man out was Kevin Bacon, who played a boyhood friend of the other two and was now a police detective. As great as he was, his role did not appear to be as demanding as those of Penn, who plays a low level hood in working class Boston, and of Robbins, who is an emotionally damaged victim of a kidnapping/sexual abuse episode decades earlier when he was a child.The story revolves around the three who are brought together following the brutal murder of Jimmy's daughter. Robbins, whose character's name is Davey, seems pretty much to be a nonentity. He is emotionally damaged from his horrible childhood experience and he is pretty much just a guy who hangs out in the neighborhood. Although he has a wife and son, he bears the scars of the earlier event. There are questions about Davey, however. The detective, played by Bacon and his partner, played by Laurence Fishburne investigate information that Davey was one of the last people to see Jimmy's daughter, the night she was killed after she came into a bar while Davey was drinking. Before long, the possibility that it was Davey is written off. However, Davey, haunted by his past, is uneasy about that night. Was he involved in the killing after all or, perhaps, did something unrelated happen? This is the mystery which must be solved.Ulitimately, there is a resolution but, this is no feel good movie so, this resolution is not necessarily satisfying. But then again, often life isn't always satisfying and what is portrayed is a gritty realism. I can't reveal any more about the events without ruining the suspense but I can add that at the very end, there is a parade scene and Jimmy's life seems to be getting on, almost as if he is able to compartmentalize and not be deeply effected by events. This emotional distance is a bit disturbing as there seems to an unforgivable detachment. But then, like I said, in real life, endings are not always what we wish them to be.Now, some editorial comment. There is often debate as to whether an actor should be nominated for an Oscar as best actor or best supporting actor. Robbin's role was major yet, he was nominated for and won best supporting actor. If he had been nominated in the best actor category, he would have lost to Penn. Penn's role was the pre-eminent role but, Robbins played a role that was nearly as pivotal. It is certainly a wonder as to how the academy splits hairs between a lead role and a supporting role. It could easily be argued that Penn, Robbins and Bacon shared the lead roles and were not supporting actors. A little more editorial comment: Penn and Robbins are among the most politically outspoken members of the Hollywood elite. On a personal basis, I do not like either one. Having said that, I have the deepest respect for their acting abilities and my personal feelings do not weigh in.

819204,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0001ZX0OC,David Hugaert,"[7, 16]","When John Keats said ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever"", he obviously wasn't referring to ""Mystic River"" - a film whose plot contains more holes than a block of swiss cheese. Once the opening shots of the city of Boston and the banks of the Charles River were displayed on the silver screen, the average moviegoer would most likely have thought, ""Hmm, I'm in for a real treat"". After the first five minutes, one's sense of delight will more than likely turn to a sense of shock and disappointment. The reason for this sudden change of emotion, is that when ""Mystic River""'s storyline progresses, it becomes more bloated and overwraught with no real sense of direction, thus driving one into a deep sleep (and possibly into severe depression). Of all that this film has going against it, the most obvious trait would be that the script lacks any real focus and direction, causing the characters portrayed in the movie to constantly ask themselves: ""Is a murder really taking place here, and do we really care?"". Furthermore, not only is this ""mystery"" extremely evasive, it appears as if at least ten people actually committed a single murder - making it very difficult to pinpoint who the actual killer is. Also, the entire cast of actors look extremely tired and could have just bothered to have not shown up and just phone in their lines. Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn looked as if they were just going through the motions, and spoke their parts as if both have just run a ten mile marthon, and, as a result, were both verbally monotone throughout the movie. As far as the acting is concerned, both Penn and Bacon are much more capable, as their past performances (when compared to their moribund performances here) would attest. It would take only a single viewing of this low-caliber pile of rubbish to make a clear-cut analysis. Due to the limited insight of ""Mystic River""'s storyline overall, it appears that director Clint Eastwood was given very little room to work with, and this directorial display doesn't bring out the full scope of his talent. How could it, since there were hardly any action scenes on display here, and the physical structure of movement was so extremely limited and elementary, that the entire project was an insult to Mr. Eastwood's directorial prowess and an insult to the entire acting ensemble as well, as the talents of both ""Mystic River""'s main stars Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn were clearly wasted. To show proof that Clint Eastwood was involved in a project that was truly beneath his abilities, it appears that all he had to say to the actors was ""Okay, you stand here and you say and do this and that"". Everyone knows Clint is FAR more capable than directing something that's on the level of a high school play, that is, if this movie even qualifies to graduate at THAT level, if to any rank at all. The only other good scene in this movie, were the ""cameo"" appearances of an ""arificial"" ""Spongebob Squarepants"" and ""McGruff The Crime Dog"", whereby, if the latter character took a bite out of ""Mystic River"", he would upchuck the contents in the Charles River (Sorry, no offense, Bostonians!), and go straight to the nearest detox center to have all of the impurities cleaned out of his delicate system. To sum it all up, ""Mystic River"" is not one body of water worthy of journeying through by boat, much less taking a swim in. Sorry, but this ""...River"" flows against the current, and only gets two stars - one, for its theme, and two, for its director.

Oh, how I wished I had read the spoilers first!It was tightly directed, though with a style and feel that echoed a much better film, A Perfect World.

Worse, it has no remorse, and that is SO sad, no redemption.Bacon, Penn, and Robinson put in strong performances in their going nowhere roles.  I admired Eastwood's flair in A Perfect World, an emotional film that touched you on all levels.  Only this movie...well, you want to wash after watching it.  You cannot empathize with Penn's character, even though the murder of his 19-year-old daughter is the focal point of the film.  Sorry, to point all the problems of this film one would have to go into spoilers left and right (I wish someone had told me the spoilers before!).  There are devises that have no place in the film, that do nothing to further the storyline, just Eastwood's sense of quirky?  Quirky worked in A Perfect World, quirky worked in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Quirky in this films was an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  I have loved Eastwood since his Rowdy Yates days, and marveled all the films he has starred in or directed ever since.  But this one just is so pointless.

819211,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0001ZX0OC,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 6]","Clint Eastwood does a great job of getting the best out of some very fine actors in this urban working class instant classic.  Sean Penn, reminding me of some of the best work by such stars as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, is absolutely authentic as Jimmy Markum from the mean streets of Boston, a guy who brushed with the law, went straight, and then, when his beloved daughter comes up murdered, is tested and found...All too human.He is supported by Tim Robbins as his boyhood chum Dave Boyle, a man tottering on the edge of sanity, a man haunted by a childhood abduction by pedophiles, one of whom flashes a priest's ring.  Penn won an academy award in 2004 as Best Actor, and Robbins won as Best Supporting Actor.  Best film that year went to Lord of the Rings, but Mystic River couldn't have been far behind in the voting.Kevin Bacon, the third of the boyhood pals who have gone their separate ways in adulthood, plays Sean Devine, a homicide detective with the Boston police.  He also does a great job.  His sidekick is played by Laurence Fishburne who brings the very familiar black police detective role to a new level of excellence with his balanced and realistic portrayal.  Also excellent is Marcia Gay Harden as Celeste Boyle, Dave's wife, who through stupidity, fear, and a misreading of human grief, makes a fatal mistake in judgment, a mistake that leads to a needless murder.The story itself is riveting.  Eastwood's direction is tight, focused, always believable, and atmospheric.  The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, is nothing short of mesmerizing.  This movie is that good.  It reminds me a little of some great mafia classics like The Godfather in the way it depicts east coast urban America: the family ties and betrayals, fateful acts born of anger and frustration, stupidity and human frailty, and most notably in the high quality of all aspects of the production, especially the most important ones, story, character and veracious setting and atmosphere.A couple of other things set this film apart.  One is the interesting and deep psychological situations that some of the characters find themselves in.  Detective Sean Devine has an estranged wife who calls him but doesn't speak; Jimmy has dark secrets in his past known only to himself; Dave Boyle does something that nobody knows about until the end, something totally in keeping with his character; and finally, the boyfriend of Jimmy's daughter, Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) knows something that solves the murder in his mind, but he doesn't want to tell it just yet.The second is, even as Brendan runs home to confirm what he knows, you'll never guess who murdered Jimmy's daughter.  Only in the next scene as the film nears its climax, is it clear what happened and why.  And the difficulty isn't anything artificial as is so often the case in movie thrillers.  The difficulty results from a beautifully constructed story based on a realistic and believable plot that makes us feel when the truth finally comes out, that it is right and understandable although almost impossible to guess beforehand.See this for Clint Eastwood who, with this film, can take his place alongside Hollywood's great directors, and for Sean Penn who gives the performance of his life.",5,Outstanding,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,3282,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'great', 'job', 'getting', 'best', 'out', 'very', 'fine', 'actors', 'urban', 'working', 'class', 'instant', 'classic', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'reminding', 'best', 'work', 'such', 'stars', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'absolutely', 'authentic', 'Jimmy', 'Markum', 'mean', 'streets', 'Boston', 'guy', 'who', 'brushed', 'law', 'went', 'straight', 'then', 'when', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'up', 'murdered', 'tested', 'found', 'too', 'human.He', 'supported', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'boyhood', 'chum', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'man', 'tottering', 'edge', 'sanity', 'man', 'haunted', 'childhood', 'abduction', 'pedophiles', 'one', 'whom', 'priest', 'ring', 'Penn', 'won', 'academy', 'award', '2004', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Robbins', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Best', 'film', 'year', 'went', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Mystic', 'River', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'far', 'voting.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'third', 'boyhood', 'pals', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'separate', 'ways', 'adulthood', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Boston', 'police', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'sidekick', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'very', 'familiar', 'black', 'police', 'detective', 'role', 'new', 'level', 'excellence', 'balanced', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Also', 'excellent', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Celeste', 'Boyle', 'Dave', 'wife', 'who', 'stupidity', 'fear', 'misreading', 'human', 'grief', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'judgment', 'mistake', 'needless', 'murder.The', 'story', 'riveting', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'tight', 'focused', 'always', 'believable', 'atmospheric', 'script', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'nothing', 'short', 'mesmerizing', 'movie', 'good', 'little', 'great', 'mafia', 'classics', 'Godfather', 'way', 'east', 'coast', 'urban', 'America', 'family', 'ties', 'betrayals', 'fateful', 'acts', 'born', 'anger', 'frustration', 'stupidity', 'human', 'frailty', 'most', 'notably', 'high', 'quality', 'aspects', 'production', 'especially', 'most', 'important', 'ones', 'story', 'character', 'veracious', 'setting', 'atmosphere.A', 'couple', 'other', 'things', 'set', 'film', 'apart', 'One', 'interesting', 'deep', 'psychological', 'situations', 'characters', 'find', 'Detective', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'estranged', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Jimmy', 'dark', 'secrets', 'past', 'known', 'only', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'something', 'nobody', 'end', 'something', 'totally', 'keeping', 'character', 'finally', 'boyfriend', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'Brendan', 'Harris', 'Tom', 'Guiry', 'something', 'murder', 'mind', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'just', 'yet.The', 'second', 'even', 'Brendan', 'home', 'confirm', 'what', ""'ll"", 'never', 'guess', 'who', 'murdered', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'Only', 'next', 'scene', 'film', 'climax', 'clear', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'difficulty', ""n't"", 'anything', 'artificial', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'movie', 'thrillers', 'difficulty', 'results', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'story', 'based', 'realistic', 'believable', 'plot', 'feel', 'when', 'truth', 'finally', 'out', 'right', 'understandable', 'almost', 'impossible', 'guess', 'beforehand.See', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'film', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'alongside', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'directors', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'performance', 'life']",N/A

The movie was 130 minutes and for 120 minutes it was riveting, emotional, AND had you on the edge of your seat.  I was fully enthralled with all the characters and the plot development.  All the performances were excellent (with the exception of Laura Linney -- see minuses) and it was a great cast. I liked Laurence Fishburne's portrayal, as he was the extreme opposite of Kevin Bacon, being the unbiased, hard nosed cop, while Bacon had emotional ties to the case and his old friends to deal with. Sean Penn was superb, but I'm not sure about him being Oscar worthy.MINUSES: Laura Linney's Boston accident was horrible!!

That's what makes Mystic River so extraordinary.From the very first scene, Mystic River induces the viewer into a gripping tale that revolves around Jimmy Markum, Dave Boyle, and Sean Devine; three childhood friends who reunite as grown men when Markum's daughter is tragically murdered.Sean Penn stars as Jimmy Markum, the grieving father who swears vengeance for his daughter's death. An ex-con, Markum utilizes his criminal ties to seek out the identity of his daughter's killer, with intentions to enforce his own justice. Penn succeeds in realistically portraying the emotionally unstable Markum, which can possibly earn him his first Oscar after falling short on three previous opportunities.Tim Robbins plays the soft-spoken Dave Boyle, whose social disability is a result of being a victim of a disturbing crime as a child. Although he hasn't received as much acclaim as Penn, Robbins is equally effective, if not, better at times in his performance on camera.The last of the three friends is Kevin Bacon's character, Sean Devine; a detective whose job conflicts with personal life when he takes on the murder case of Markum's daughter. Despite being billed high in the credits, Bacon receives limited screen-time and is often times overshadowed by Laurence Fishburne, who plays his partner, Whitey Powers.This is one of several lapses that occurred when adapting Dennis Lehane's novel into a motion picture screenplay. The blame lies with the editing department more so than Academy Award-winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland, whose chosen dialogue keeps the audience hooked for the 137 minute duration.Without the superb deliverance of the script by the actors, however, Helgeland's work may have been overlooked.  Rounding out the stellar cast is Laura Linney and Academy Award-winner Marcia Gay Harden, who plays Robbin's wife, Celeste Boyle.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the filmmaking of Mystic River is what really puts it over the top. Eastwood combines challenging shots with his self-composed score to construct breathtaking scenes that otherwise, would have been less memorable.Mystic River contains all the components one wants to experience when watching a film; a compelling story, talented acting, and visual excitement.

Nonetheless, as someone who was born and raised in the Boston area, I can attest to the accurate rendering of personalities by the actors.

Further, the actors accurately rendered speech, mannerisms, and the (noteworthy) Boston accent of the area.It is a tragic and sad story, which is why I didn't enjoy it.

Having read the book shortly before seeing the movie, I was impressed with Eastwood's faithfulness to the letter and spirit of Lehane's story.Sean Penn plays Jimmy Markham (Marcus in the book), a small time hood who did a stint in prison almost two decades earlier.  Jimmy now owns a grocery store, is a loving family man, and seems to have given up his criminal ways.  As a child, Jimmy was a close friend of Sean Devine, who grew up to become a homicide detective, and Dave Boyle, played by the wonderful Tim Robbins.  Boyle endured a terrible trauma as a child, and he is tortured by horrifying thoughts that he can never escape.  When Jimmy's nineteen-year-old daughter, Katie, is found brutally murdered, Sean investigates with his partner, played by Laurence Fishburne, and the lives of the three old friends intersect once again.The stellar cast of ""Mystic River"" is amazingly effective.  Each actor completely inhabits his or her character.  Sean Penn's performance is brutal and heart-rending, and Tim Robbins convincingly plays a man on the brink of madness.  Supporting these fine actors are Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden, as Jimmy's and Dave's wives.Eastwood wisely shot his film on the streets of Boston, and Tom Stern's atmospheric and skillful cinematography contribute to the film's realistic and dramatic look.  ""Mystic River"" is a powerful drama about how desperate people react when they are under tremendous emotional pressure.  This mythic tragedy proves Faulkner's dictum, ""The past is never dead.  It's not even past."" The mistakes we make and the injuries that we suffer are always with us in one way or another.

819230,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0001ZX0OC,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[0, 0]","Wow! That basically sums up the entire review so why the heck am I going to waste time to write a full review for this. I'll tell you why. Because this movie was just so amazing and so great, that I want to explain to you in details what made it like that. My initial thoughts about this film, before I went to see it, would be that I would either think it was incredible and possibly one of the best films of the year, or it would be a terrible waste of time, money, and talent. I was glad that I was wrong about the latter.Although ""Mystic River"" was not the best movie of the year, it will most positively be in the top ten, if not five, top twenty five movies of the year 2003. This is a movie on the list of this years classics of ""Matchstick Men,"" ""Open Range,"" ""Chicago,"" ""Adaptation,"" and many more. It's a thriller with just enough action to satisfy that group of people, just enough suspense to satisfy the people who are looking for that, and just enough drama to sadden the veiwer to the point where they just have to make sure the end of the movie has resolution, while more suspense is being thrown out. This movie had better suspense and a better storyline then most dramatic thrillers out there now. It sounds a little like ""In the Cut,"" without all the sex. ""Mystic River,"" was only rated R for it's profanity and some scenes of violence.The ensamble cast was terrific. The main character probally is Jimmy Markum, who has the most conflict. His nineteen year old daughter Katie was murdered by the unknown. He sets it upon himself to find the guy who did it, and then kill him. But this is way ahead of myself. It begins with Jimmy and his friends Dave and Sean, all as kids. Writing their name is wet cement is one thing, but when two men posing as cops yell at them is another. Because they take Dave, claiming to bring him to his mother's house for ruining wet cement. Dave is missing for four days and when they catch the pedofiles, Dave becomes a little messed up. An unknown amount of years later pass and we see all of them grown up. Jimmy is Sean Pean, Dave is Tim Robbins, and Sean is Kevin Bacon. Jimmy is married to Annabeth, with a criminal record in his past, Sean is a policemen working with his partner Whitey, and Dave....well Dave is messed up. Married to Celeste and with a kid, he is still crazy about when he was abducted many years back. Jimmy's daughter Katie is killed. Sean and Whitey are the detectives who try to find out who did it. The three of them all reunite, from the abduction which seprated them apart from each other. They have their own lives, and their own secrets.Celeste becomes a little confused about Dave. The night of Katie's murder, Dave came home in the middle of the night, blood covering his chest. He claims he beat up a mugger and killed him, but Celeste never finds anything about a dead mugger in the newspaper, AND Dave's story rapidily changes as the movie continues. Plus the viewer knows for a fact that Dave saw Katie when she was murdered, so Dave becomes the prime suspect in the investigation. Things begin to change, and revolations are told that begin to shift gears, all to the explosive conclusion that I seriosuly did not figure out. Crafty Clint Eastwood directs a mind boggler of a picture, what a guy!The lighting of the movie gave off a dark, dismal, look on life. It made me think. It scared me, moved me, interested me, and wanted it to not end. No storng violence is present, mostly implied, by the profanity is a little strong. I look forward to reading the book.I loved ""Mystic River."" I loved everything about it. The storyline that although is present in many movies that I have seen, is incredible. The acting plays off from the storyline strongly, making the movie oddly depressing, when in the end the message is hope. You hope for everything to end up alright, you hope for all of these sick people to stop taking young children, you hope to stop the murders, and you hope of stop the violence and the everlasting battles between bad guy and good guy. What a movie! I loved it! Definintly one of the best films of the year, and one of the best films that I have seen. See ""Mystic River"" now!

Parts of Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth intertwine in a lower middle income Roman Catholic neighborhood of Boston. But what stuck with me the most was the ending, without which I think the film's meaning would have been much simpler.

819234,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B0001ZX0OC,Emily Todd,"[8, 13]","""Mystic River"" is, by far, one of Clint Eastwood's finest films to date.  Adapted for the screen by Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential, Payback, Blood Work) from the book of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the writers take what typically would have been a simplistic murder mystery/thriller and turned it into one of the most engrossing, fascinating, and heartbreaking films I've seen all year.  Essentially, ""Mystic River"" is about how the past never leaves us and how the events in our past, especially in our childhood, affect us as we grow older and lastly, how grief affects people differently, in both good and bad ways.The movie follows the individual fates of three childhood friends and their families, Jimmy Marcus (Sean Penn), Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), whose lives were forever changed by a nightmarish childhood incident.  The pain resulting from this incident and another that occurs to one of their children when the friends are adults is a metaphor for the river of grief (thus the title) that, unbeknownst to them all, binds each of these men together.  Grief, as it always does, brings each of the men closer together, but ultimately results in tragedy for everyone involved.Hands down, this is one of the finest casts ever to be assembled on screen.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney.  Wow, can it get any better than that?  And it's not as if these actors are all just thrown together with no chemistry whatsoever.  They all work together so well and none of the actors end up stealing the spotlight.  Each actor disappears into their roles with startling ease, leaving their big Hollywood names behind and truly becoming their characters, Boston accents and all.My only problem with this film is its last act.  Fore me, it simply did not live up to the high caliber artistry of the rest of the movie.  I was so engrossed in this film and was expecting an ending to match it, but found myself ultimately dissatisfied with the solution the writer offered.  I felt as if he'd ""taken the easy way out"".",5,"""Maybe someday you'll forget what it's like to be human...""",1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,2101,"['Mystic', 'River', 'far', 'one', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'finest', 'films', 'date', 'Adapted', 'screen', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Payback', 'Blood', 'Work', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'writers', 'take', 'what', 'typically', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'simplistic', 'murder', 'mystery/thriller', 'turned', 'one', 'most', 'engrossing', 'fascinating', 'heartbreaking', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Essentially', 'Mystic', 'River', 'how', 'past', 'never', 'how', 'events', 'past', 'especially', 'childhood', 'affect', 'grow', 'older', 'lastly', 'how', 'grief', 'affects', 'people', 'differently', 'good', 'bad', 'ways.The', 'movie', 'individual', 'fates', 'three', 'childhood', 'friends', 'families', 'Jimmy', 'Marcus', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'lives', 'were', 'forever', 'changed', 'nightmarish', 'childhood', 'incident', 'pain', 'resulting', 'incident', 'one', 'children', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'adults', 'metaphor', 'river', 'grief', 'thus', 'title', 'unbeknownst', 'men', 'together', 'Grief', 'always', 'men', 'closer', 'together', 'ultimately', 'results', 'tragedy', 'everyone', 'down', 'one', 'finest', 'casts', 'ever', 'be', 'assembled', 'screen', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Wow', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'not', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'thrown', 'together', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'work', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'none', 'actors', 'end', 'up', 'stealing', 'spotlight', 'actor', 'roles', 'startling', 'ease', 'leaving', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'names', 'truly', 'becoming', 'characters', 'Boston', 'accents', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'last', 'act', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'caliber', 'artistry', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'engrossed', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'ending', 'match', 'found', 'ultimately', 'dissatisfied', 'solution', 'writer', 'offered', 'felt', ""'d"", 'taken', 'easy', 'way']",N/A
819235,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B0001ZX0OC,Erica Anderson,"[3, 7]","I just caught the evening matinee show of ""Mystic River"" at my local movie theater tonight. The complex storyline and gritty cinematography truly is worthy of praise by film critics and moviegoers alike. I haven't read the book yet because I wanted to see the movie first and not ruin the entire movie experience. The three main characters played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon were so well written, if not well calculated. All three characters were traumatized and still haunted by the abduction of their best friend Dave. Dave never recovered from his abduction by two slimeballs who passed themselves off as cops. The emotional damage of being molested for four days leaves Dave Boyle permanently damaged emotionally and psychologically. Tim Robbins put in a rich performance as the tormented Dave. Although grown up and was married, he was clearly still haunted by the events of his childhood. Who wouldn't? Marcia Gay Harden put in a wonderful performance as Dave's wife Celeste who believed that Dave was responsible for the murder of Jimmy's eldest daughter from his first marriage. I never really took Kevin Bacon very seriously as an actor however I thought this was the best performance as Sean I have seen from Kevin. Laurence Fishbourne (whom I forgot to mention earlier) was equally wonderful as Sean's partner. I thought his performance was more subtle and lo-key which was fine since the focal point of the movie was around Dave, Sean, and Jimmy. Of all the actors/actresses in the film, I thought Sean Penn put in the most compelling performance as the ex-con Jimmy Marcus whose 19 year old daughter is brutally murdered. When he discovers that the body the cops found was his daughter, I immediately felt the hairs on my arms stand up straight. I never got the chills like that in any movie until now. Sean may be a difficult actor but the performances he puts in truly shines, especially in ""Mystic River"". As a result of his daughter's death, Jimmy is reunited with his old childhood friends Dave and Sean. The death of Jimmy's daughter quickly unravels and immediately has an explosive effect on the three childhood friends. I would have loved to have seen how the death of Jimmy's daughter effected his other daughters but that might have been a distraction from the story. I loved Laura Linney as Jimmy's wife. Her performance was just as subtle as Laurence Fishbourne which is why I like Laura so much, she doesn't overact like most major Hollywood actresses today. Marcia Gay Harden is wonderful in this film. I hope one or both of the actresses are recognized for their performances in ""Mystic River"" when Oscars roll around. I immensely enjoyed the twists and turns in the film. There wasn't anything about this movie that I didn't like. The cinematography was excellent. It truly fit the mood of the movie. ""Mystic River"" certainly ranks as one of, if not the best film of 2003.

819239,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B0001ZX0OC,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[3, 14]","Mystic River is not what I thought it would be ... yet, the film is current and contemporary ... and fascinating  ... in a disturbing sort of way. It is based on events that are all too common in modern times and boldly stated in the headlines of newspapers in large cities: a murder victim, a 19 year old female is found dead in a park. This film grabs the psyche of the audience and shakes it vigorously to feel and experience a wide range of emotions. The film gradually unfolds the psychological impact of this crime on relatives and friends in the working class neighborhood where it occured. With subtlety, slowly ... the viewer is given details about the lives of various suspects and the backgrounds of possible suspects, who could have done the deed or had some motive based on the past. The film explores family loyalties and strained friendships which arise from suspicions and doubts. Katie, the victim, and her boyfriend, were planning to meet secretly, against her father's wishes. In the beginning of the film, we learn her father had a grudge against the young man, for reasons unknown but which are revealed toward the end of the film.The audience is introduced to three of the main characters, Jimmy, Sean and Dave, when they were about 6 or 7 years old, playing field hockey in the streets in the 1970s. A terrible personal tragedy occurs to one of the boys, who is taken away by two men in an unmarked car. Initially, the youngsters were reprimanded by the men for writing their names in freshly poured cement. Afterwards, one of them, Dave is forced into the car by what seems like an undercover policeman who tells Dave he will be driven home. One of the saddest scenes in the film is Dave's tear-stained face as he looks at his friends from out of the back window when he is driven away. In several film clips we discover, the boy was taken to a cellar and the intimation is that unspeakable acts were performed on him by the adult men. Fortunately, the viewer is spared the details but the implication is there. Dave manages to escape ... The next scene occurs when Dave is an adult, playing baseball with his son. Dave is slightly slow and ""different"" ... As his character is revealed in the movie, he shows signs of being negatively affected by the unspeakable event which occured to him in the past. Eventually his wife becomes suspicious of Dave for the possible murder of Katie, but she knows nothing of Dave's past abuse. As adults, the three friends grew apart and went on totally separate pathways in life: Jimmy, became a corner grocery story owner with crimnal connections but he appears to have gone straight. He was in prison for a couple of years in the past for theft. Sean, became a criminal investigator and detective. The film explores the depth of passion that Jimmy experiences due to the murder of his daughter. With revenge as his goal, Jimmy has two cousins, thugs, investigate and question everyone who saw or knew anything about Katie's activities the night of her disappearance. Eventually, the police investigators narrow down the murder suspects to two people, Dave and Katie's boyfriend, Brendan. It turns out, on the night of the crime, Dave had arrived home with bloody hands and a deep cut on one of his hands, although the police know nothing about this because his wife provided him an alibi. However, the police find inconsistentcies in his responses to how he sustained the injury noting, both he and his wife are exhibiting peculiar behaviors,  as if they were guilty or hiding something. Part of the mystery of this film revolves around the abuse that Dave experienced as a child and the suspicion that it created some potential psychological damage to him from which he did not recover. The other mystery pertains to the missing father of Katie's boyfriend who was involved in a crime. The boyfriend's dad mysteriously disappeared but it is never quite clear whether he is alive or not. The complex lives and relationships of the main characters in this film create unusual depths which are plumbed in unsuspecting ways as the film draws to a close. While the film was not what I expected, my appreciation grew for the subject matter as suspense built and as subtle details, provided throughout the film, came together and made sense. At the end, there remain many unsettled questions although the murderer is identified and captured. The viewer is left feeling that something very sinister still remains unsolved -- it is hanging in the air ... like at the end of an Alfred Hitchcock movie.Besides the contemporary subject matter, this film has enormous appeal due to the wide range of emotional reactons expressed by its most powerful actor, Sean Penn. His performance was deeply intense and highly charged with emotion throughout the film -- totally appropriate to the situations. I can only compare him to Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman at their finest moments. The next most impressive actor was Tim Robbins' portrayal of the psychologically disturbed Dave. He provided just the right facial expressions and body language to appear creepy and suspicious at times. Marsha Gay Harden, who played Dave's wife Celeste, is the next in line for impressive performance. Her portrayal of vulnerability and betrayal were superb. Both Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne displayed fine qualities in their respective portrayal of criminal investigators but their performances fell within the realm of expectation, othing special in my estimation. The other characters by their very nature provided a wider range of development for the respective actors and actresses who played them. Overall, this film is highly recommended if the viewer is willing to feel strong conflicting emotions and able to tolerate disturbing images required for the plot and storyline.

819240,A84UFSF2SZS2W,B0001ZX0OC,"EriKa ""E""","[1, 6]","At the particular point in Mystic River when Sean Penn grieves about his murdered daughter, ""I know in my soul I contributed to your death..."", the viewer can only assume this is because of his misplaced guilt and anger at his loss. What parent would not try to blame him or herself in such a case? What we don't know is that Penn's character, a basically reformed ex-con, is partly responsible. The way in which he and his past bear responsibility unfolds throughout the course of the film, which for all its intricacies and entertainment value and raw emotive power (the actors in this film are all excellent), still somehow leaves me frustrated and not quite completely satisfied. That is not to say this film is not excellent. It is excellent. Sean Penn is excellent because he is natural and comfortable in the skin of this character (and indeed all his characters). Tim Robbins is excellent because he conveys what the entire undertone of the film is: discomfort, never quite feeling or being oneself again in the face of tragedy. I enjoy films that have an underlying tone, and I got an ominous feeling from the way the events of the film unfolded.Still, as another reviewer pointed out, there are points when critical information could be revealed but the plot just won't allow for it (would kill the suspense and the story). When a character has vital information that could in fact save him/her, he/she should reveal it. Sure, maybe Robbins, as a result of the childhood trauma he suffered, maybe is damaged and never recovers and therefore cannot communicate information readily.Still with the stellar cast in excellent roles, I would recommend this film.",4,"""I know in my soul I contributed to your death...""",1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,1666,"['particular', 'point', 'Mystic', 'River', 'when', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'know', 'soul', 'contributed', 'death', 'viewer', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'misplaced', 'guilt', 'anger', 'loss', 'What', 'parent', 'would', 'not', 'try', 'blame', 'case', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Penn', 'character', 'basically', 'reformed', 'ex-con', 'partly', 'responsible', 'way', 'past', 'bear', 'responsibility', 'course', 'film', 'intricacies', 'entertainment', 'value', 'raw', 'emotive', 'power', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'still', 'somehow', 'frustrated', 'not', 'quite', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'excellent', 'natural', 'comfortable', 'skin', 'character', 'indeed', 'characters', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'excellent', 'what', 'entire', 'undertone', 'film', 'discomfort', 'never', 'quite', 'feeling', 'being', 'again', 'face', 'tragedy', 'enjoy', 'films', 'have', 'underlying', 'tone', 'got', 'ominous', 'feeling', 'way', 'events', 'film', 'unfolded.Still', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'points', 'when', 'critical', 'information', 'could', 'be', 'revealed', 'plot', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'would', 'kill', 'suspense', 'story', 'When', 'character', 'vital', 'information', 'could', 'fact', 'save', 'him/her', 'he/she', 'should', 'reveal', 'Sure', 'maybe', 'Robbins', 'result', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'suffered', 'maybe', 'damaged', 'never', 'recovers', 'therefore', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'information', 'readily.Still', 'stellar', 'cast', 'excellent', 'roles', 'would', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

But, I'm not saying it was a bad film.  Eastwood has hit home runs in the last several outings and he has aged his talents to a finely honed formula that rarely dissappoints.  I am not familiar with the book that this is based on and frankly I don't want to know: the movie was upsetting enough.A good drama should move you, should make you feel shaken and this film delivers.  The script is very good, the actors all excellent.  While the film seems to linger just a wee bit too long at the end, it caps off the story without leaving anything unsaid.  Having said this, it also does not tie up every single loose end; we are left to figure it out for ourselves and the ambiguity that this invokes is acceptable.Sean Penn gives a tremendous performance that is worthy of all the accolades.  Following close to him is the evocative and always disturbing impressions we see in Tim Robbins' character.  The themes of this film are nasty and not for the weak of heart or constitution.  While it is not pleasant these things do happen and the story is told in a believable way.While I am a big fan of all the main actors and of Eastwoods movies in general, the depth of pain this film oozes just makes me glad I watched it once and I think I'll take a very long rain check on seeing it again; at least for quite a while.

Instead, he is put through four days of hell and finally manages to escape.Years later, David comes home late one night covered in blood, telling his wife Celeste a story about being attacked.  Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter is brutally murdered the same night, and he begins his own investigation into her death, sometimes messing up the investigation led by Sean who now works for the Boston Police Department.Tim Robbins gives one of the finest performances of the film as the older David Boyle, a man haunted by events of the past.  Marcia Gay Harden is equally fine as his wife Celeste, unsure of her husband's fragile mental state in light of Jimmy's daughter's murder.  Sean Penn is good as Jimmy, but sometimes seems to go over-the-top with the portrayal of a father devastated by the murder and determined to take matters into his own hands.  Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon make a great team, working well as two cops on the trail of a killer.Clint Eastwood's direction is good, but he should have ended the movie sooner than he did.

It was an excellent movie, without question. I'm an old-line, long-term Clint Eastwood fan and I found this movie to be amazing. It was so far removed from Eastwood's early ""Man With No Name"" and ""Dirty Harry"" movies as to be almost unrecognizable. Here, Eastwood not only directed the film but he is even credited for the music. His professional growth over his long career has been astounding.In this  film, three Boston-aea boyhood friends experience tragedy in a variety of stunningly different ways resulting in the death and probable imprisonment of two. It's a stirring long-term story and exceptionally well done. The movie is a tense police drama that is totally unlike Eastwood's early police work in the form of Dirty Harry. Here, the police  race to solve a very unfortunate murder mystery, before a small vigilante committee takes matters into their own hands. The police fail, by a narrow margin. The  results are deeply tragic in every way, and yield a crushing emotional ending to a superb movie. It's not a comfortable movie to watch, I might add.Everything about this movie is good. The acting is excellent. The filming is first rate. The musical background is excellent. The story is gripping. The emotional impact is stunning. Good movie!

Tim Robbins as a tortured soul, the survivor of a tragic episode in his childhood, is both disturbing and haunting.

Sean Penn, plays the other large role, a man who feels that life continues to bring brutal luck and tragedy,  I believe that he is truly one of the more underrated actors of our time.  For those who still think of him as the actor in Bad Boy and At Close Range, you need to see this film, if for any reason, just to see the true maturation of a brilliant actor.

819252,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001ZX0OC,Grady Harp,"[5, 9]","MYSTIC RIVER ranks with the finest films created in the past few decades.  Clint Eastwood directs this harrowing story with a quiet brilliance that cuts right to the message of the film: everyone has an inner darkness which propels us to surprising acts at unexpected times.  This film is more Theater than movie in its intensity: the story and character development are primary and the visuals and camera work, though spellbindingly superb, are tools for Eastwood's commitment to finding the psychological core of every aspect of a group of people whose lives intersect in this almost unbearably bitter bit of truth.Three boys playing street hockey on the neighborhood street in the Flats near Boston share a commitment and comraderie that is so strong that it doesn't need dialogue. During a simple act of mini-vandalism (writing their names - Jimmy, Sean, Dave - in the wet cement of their neighborhood sidewalk), one of the three is 'hauled away' by what appears to be a cop but in reality is a pedophile who subjects young Dave to four days of catpture and molestation.  Flash to the present and the three bonded boys are now middle-aged men who have little contact with each other and even less in common.  The mature Dave is haunted by his past which is never discussed but left to fester as a poisonous nidus.  Jimmy is an ex-con who operates a gang-like existance and Sean is a Boston cop whose wife has deserted him for reasons unknown.  The three are brought back together by the murder of Jimmy's daughter leading to a series of events and consequences which bring to the surface all the damage inflicted by the encounter that opens the story.  The suspense and development of the crime investigation are so razor sharp that revealing the ending would be a crime against those who have not yet experienced this movie.The cast is impeccable and under Eastwood's direction gives some of the most thoroughly realized, brilliant performances on film.  Yes, individual performances can be singled out - Timothy Robbins as the mentally fragmented and fragile Dave is extraordinary, Sean Penn as Jimmy gives a performance of passionate power and pain and anguish, Kevin Bacon's understated protrait of Sean the investigating cop is the epitome of subtlety, Marcia Gay Harden shines as Dave's terrified, tremulous wife, and Laura Linney is steely perfection in the small role of Jimmy's embittered yet supportive second wife.  All of the cast, including Laurence Fishburne as Sean's cop partner, have successfuly adopted the Boston accent.  Every member of the supporting cast is exceptional and Eastwood knows how to pull natural acting from people whose experience is to this point limited.The ""look"" of the film - that grimy, Mystic River grit atmosphere - is consistently captured by the cinematographer and the dialogue of the peerless screenplay never drops below perfect.  This is an emotionally devastating film to watch but, like the performance of a symphony that plumbs the depths of the soul, it is in the end an achievement that deserves a Bravo! - even in the muted silence as you exit the theater.",5,A Staggeringly Brilliant Achievement in American Film,1065657600,"10 9, 2003",2003,3116,"['MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'finest', 'films', 'created', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'harrowing', 'story', 'quiet', 'brilliance', 'right', 'message', 'film', 'everyone', 'inner', 'darkness', 'surprising', 'acts', 'unexpected', 'times', 'film', 'more', 'Theater', 'movie', 'intensity', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'primary', 'visuals', 'camera', 'work', 'spellbindingly', 'superb', 'are', 'tools', 'Eastwood', 'commitment', 'finding', 'psychological', 'core', 'aspect', 'group', 'people', 'lives', 'intersect', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'bitter', 'bit', 'truth.Three', 'boys', 'playing', 'street', 'hockey', 'neighborhood', 'street', 'Flats', 'Boston', 'share', 'commitment', 'comraderie', 'so', 'strong', ""n't"", 'need', 'dialogue', 'simple', 'act', 'mini-vandalism', 'writing', 'names', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'Dave', 'wet', 'cement', 'neighborhood', 'sidewalk', 'one', 'three', ""'hauled"", 'away', 'what', 'be', 'cop', 'reality', 'pedophile', 'who', 'young', 'Dave', 'four', 'days', 'catpture', 'molestation', 'Flash', 'present', 'three', 'bonded', 'boys', 'are', 'now', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'contact', 'other', 'even', 'less', 'common', 'mature', 'Dave', 'haunted', 'past', 'never', 'discussed', 'left', 'fester', 'poisonous', 'nidus', 'Jimmy', 'ex-con', 'who', 'gang-like', 'existance', 'Sean', 'Boston', 'cop', 'wife', 'deserted', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'three', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'together', 'murder', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'leading', 'series', 'events', 'consequences', 'bring', 'surface', 'damage', 'inflicted', 'encounter', 'story', 'suspense', 'development', 'crime', 'investigation', 'are', 'so', 'razor', 'sharp', 'revealing', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'crime', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'experienced', 'movie.The', 'cast', 'impeccable', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'most', 'thoroughly', 'realized', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'film', 'Yes', 'individual', 'performances', 'can', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'Timothy', 'Robbins', 'mentally', 'fragmented', 'fragile', 'Dave', 'extraordinary', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Jimmy', 'performance', 'passionate', 'power', 'pain', 'anguish', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'understated', 'protrait', 'Sean', 'investigating', 'cop', 'epitome', 'subtlety', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'shines', 'Dave', 'terrified', 'tremulous', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'steely', 'perfection', 'small', 'role', 'Jimmy', 'embittered', 'yet', 'supportive', 'second', 'wife', 'cast', 'including', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Sean', 'cop', 'partner', 'have', 'successfuly', 'adopted', 'Boston', 'accent', 'member', 'supporting', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'Eastwood', 'how', 'pull', 'natural', 'acting', 'people', 'experience', 'point', 'look', 'film', 'grimy', 'Mystic', 'River', 'grit', 'atmosphere', 'consistently', 'captured', 'cinematographer', 'dialogue', 'peerless', 'screenplay', 'never', 'perfect', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'film', 'watch', 'performance', 'symphony', 'depths', 'soul', 'end', 'achievement', 'Bravo', 'even', 'muted', 'silence', 'exit', 'theater']",N/A

819256,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0001ZX0OC,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[6, 7]","This is a great film, but it is very depressing and probably the bleakest film of Eastwood's career.  Many have said that Clint's film, Million Dollar Baby, was depressing.  That film was sad, but there was a sort of transendence at the end of it.  This film has nothing like that.  The 3 boyhood friends, played by Penn, Robbins, and Bacon, have all gone their seperate ways in life when they are reunited when Penn's daughter is murdered.  After an inital meeting where they all share their grief, the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds.  Robbins is especially good (and deserving of his Academy award) as the man who was molested as a young man, and who is permanently scarred because of it.  While at first you feel sympathy for Penn's character, you realise slowly that Penn is really a cruel, brutal man.  Bacon is very good as the detective, the only character of the three who really seems to be balanced, even though his wife has left recently, and he is a typically cynical detective.  The film ends brilliantly on an ambiguous, dark note, with Kevin Bacon giving Penn a ""I know what kind of person you really are"" at the end of the film.  This is a disturbing, brooding film, one of Eastwood's darkest (even darker than Unforgiven), but it's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received.  It has the marks of a great tragedy, because like all tragedies, things never worked out for the best, they seemed to have worked out for the worst, but we're really not sure.

819259,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0001ZX0OC,Haunted Flower,"[1, 1]","Mystic River DVD Review2 Disc Widescreen Edition (2003)Mystic River cleaned up and won Academy awards for Best Actor - Sean Penn, and Best Supporting Actor - Tim Robbins and was nominated for everything else you can think of. It did not, however win Best Picture. Directed by Clint Eastwood from the novel written by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River is about three childhood friends who after a tragic incident grow up to be a cop, a victim, and a suspect.This movie can feel very slow in the pacing and action. It takes a while for events to pick up and characters to start opening up. The feel of the movie and accuracy helps set the location very well. Everything is dark and in blues like the river. The ensemble cast is a big who's who of a generation in Hollywood. Since Clint Eastwood prefers to get everything done in one or two shots, you know actors had to step up their game and that makes the performances a little more impressive.I'm a fan of Tim Robbins, mostly because of The Shawshank Redemption. He just always finds a way to look so.......haunted. He plays a quiet, kinda crazy guy who was sexually abused as child when he was kidnapped and held prisoner in a cellar for four days. Now he's grown with a wife and child and comes home at 3 a.m. one night with blood on his hands. His facial expressions and tone of voice are so eerie. His character is a pathological liar because the time he told the truth when his friends lied, he was made into a victim. Now in any threatening situation, he lies to stay safe and it makes him even more of a suspect.Sean Penn's daughter played by Emmy Rossum (who is beautiful and innocent as always, this was her first notable role in a big film) is found to have been murdered. Penn does a heart-breaking job screaming over and over again, ""Is that my daughter in there?"" Honestly, he gets it in about ten times and has to be restrained by like seven guys to avoid going to see her body where they found it. He brings out the raw emotion at the drop of a hat and his performance is very compelling.Their other childhood friend, Kevin Bacon is one of the investigating cops along with Laurence Fishburne and they (of course) try to piece together the puzzle and find out what happened. There's a side mystery of his silent wife who calls him and says nothing which is sad but unessential to the core of the film. Bacon walking the line between victim's parent and suspect being his childhood friends is quite the feat. While they are not close any longer, under every conversation is a vast canyon of history that is addressed in subtext.Marcia Gay Harden plays Tim Robbins's wife and stays in the background looking worried and scared most of the movie. Laura Linney plays a great grieving stepmother and makes a big character turn that comes out of left field at the end of the movie. To avoid any spoilers for those who haven't seen it, the movie really could have ended after the main action when Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon were talking in the street. But no, it continues to show more aftermath conversations and a parade. I guess it is to set up the audience choosing in their minds what happened to the characters later, but it's really so ambiguous it feels like overkill. The comparison of marital relationships from which is most loving to which is most likely to last is interestingly ironic.This movie is good....but it just isn't THAT good. It has some beautiful individual performances but as a package, loses my interest at points. I guess the Academy and I have different standards......then again, it didn't win Best Picture now did it?DVD Extras:There are two featurettes, ""Beneath the Surface"" and ""From Page to Screen"" that go over the casting of the movie, production details, Eastwood's one-take style of directing, and the accuracies of where they shot the movie. The writer points out that they started shooting about a block and half away from where he wrote the book. Also the writer was very concerned that all these Hollywood actors would sound different than how he heard his characters in his head, but that they mastered their accents and characters well to his imagination. There are full-length interviews from ""The Charlie Rose Show"" that into detail with Clint Eastwood, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins. No Sean Penn? The part of the extras I enjoyed the most was commentary with Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. I always enjoy actor commentary the most since I have a background in acting in theatre and film myself. They break down some of the scenes and reveal a little more about motivations for why certain things were done and are just interesting to listen to if you are fans of their work.

Every single aspect of it is thought through and in line with the whole.Yes, there is violence in the story, but does that make the movie a violent ""show"", as one review claims? Definitely not, much of the violence happens off screen or is not shown in a full and direct way. There is no violence peeping, no gloating in sordid details.

Truly a moving film, Mystic River never lets your eyes wander from the screen as you're completely focused on this very disturbing story. A film capturing the adult lives of once childhood friends, played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon, you watch as they come together once again after what appears to be many years of brief and intermittent run-ins with each other.Sean Penn plays somewhat of a wise, yet immature loose cannon of a man, Kevin Bacon as a MPD (Massachusetts) detective and Tim Robbins as the man whose life was forever altered because of a shocking childhood trauma, these three play off of each other very well. I wanted to reach out to each of them. There are moments where some may see Kevin Bacon's character as a bit flushed out, but it appears that this is more effective than not. We jump from age 10 to probably late 30's, early 40's of these three men and we learn little about them that helps to explain so much.After Penn's daughter is brutally murdered, Bacon and Laurence Fishburne (a fine choice to partner with Bacon) take on the case to find her killer. The three friends are all shaken up (obviously Penn is destroyed over hiss loss) and the mystery seems to unfold quite rapidly. This is definitely one of the most intriguing mystery films I've seen in a long time.Fans of those earlier mentioned should really enjoy this film. There are also some excellent and shocking performances by Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden. I highly recommend this film. Its disturbing and almost heart-wrenching (perhaps even angering) subject will attract any looking for a solid dramatic mystery with some very memorable characters.

Then, for no known reason, Clint Eastwood cancelled and we were left to wait another six months for the film to be released nationwide.Was it worth the wait. Well, while I've never doubted Eastwood's talents behind the camera (I really liked Absolute Power) there is just something in this film that fails to connect with me.The story of three childhood friends (Penn, Robbins, Bacon) torn apart as adults after one of them is abducted is intriguing.Penn is the thug father with a loathsome and heartless wife (Laura Linney), Robbin's is the meek and humble dad with a loving (but totally traitor) wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and Bacon is the investigating Cop who's wife has run away. All of them perform very well, especially Robbin's who has always struggled to shed his 'nice but dim' typecasting. And Eastwood's direction takes its time and builds the story at a deliberate, unrushed pace.But as soon as Sean Penn's daughter is murdered I lost all sympathy for them. The story falls into darkness as suspicions and tensions mount. Every character gets what they deserve. I had no connection with Marcia Gay Harden at all and her panic and denial at the end is her own fault. Her character was the wife of Tim Robbins' for what appears to be over a decade, she simply would have known her husband wasn't a killer, should never have confided in Sean Penn. Tim Robbins is also to blame for telling lies about how he came home bleeding and shaken.Sean Penn's character also gets what's coming to him (though it's a bit of a let-down we don't actually see it). He's a bad man and despite his brilliant acting and grief at the loss of his daughter, why on earth would I care about such a despicable man?Basically, many horrors and tragedies could have been avoided in this story if people just told the truth. Fair enough, there wouldn't BE a story if that were so but the result is a film that I cannot engage with and in the end I just don't care.The DVD is in great-looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are 2 extra discs worth of features (one of them is a soundtrack CD) if you can't get enough. I've had my share of this movie.

When any movie starts back about 30 years ago with some traumatic event, and then flashes forward to the present, where we see the youngsters all grown up, a light bulb immediately goes up in my head: LOUSY EXPOSITION!!! Well, not always, but the level of cornyness to which this device is put to in this movie is really goofy. From the minute you see one of the youngster get in a car with a strange man who purports to be a cop, you can practically predict half the movie. Then there's Sean Penn, doing his Robert DeNiro imitation; he even had a Robert DeNiro haircut, circa 1985 or so. I guess he's at the same age when DeNiro was doing lots of his really good work The trouble is we've seen all that ""truth in acting"" stuff and it's an actor's job to connect with the character.  It amazes me when people kvell over the ""wonderful performance"" in a movie.  Well, that's what actors are trained to do: act! I know.  I've done lots of it.  And Sean Penn does the same level of work, albeit good work, that thousands of actors do if they're doing their work well. That doesn't warrant an academy award.  Then the scene when Sean Penn is restrained by about 50 police officers.  His primal scream was authentic, but so what! There's a phony zoom-out long shot showing how big the crowd around Penn gets to restrain him, melodramatically rendered to communicate: ""look at the agony of this man."" He is in so much pain! Either than or perhaps he had a very bad case of constipation. There's nothing wrong with depicting personal tragedy on screen, but there's nothing new here. Then we have Kevin Bacon, in one of those typical interrole conflict situations; a friend of Sean Penn's character, but now a detective a bit higher in social status than the New England working class milieu of his humble beginnings. Thus, we have the tired predicament of the friend who has to maintain professional distance. What's more insulting is the ""black sidekick"" detective.  Every cop movie these days seems to have to have a ""black sidekick"" to announce to the audience how inclusive the world of the movie is.  How about a Chinese Sidekick? or an Orthodox Jew for that matter: not much originality here.  Then poor Tim Robbins, having to look morose. He does a good job, but again, it's another stock character in a stock movie.",2,"Good movie?

819270,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B0001ZX0OC,James D. Leverton,"[6, 8]","""Mystic River"" is an instant classic with phenomenal performances by its entire cast, from the star trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon, all the way down to the three youngsters who play them as children in the opening sequence.If director Clint Eastwood never made another movie, ""Mystic River"" would serve as the same kind of cinematic swan song John Wayne achieved with ""The Shootist.""  Meticulously crafted and perfectly cast, the film packs an incredible wallop, from the beautifully shot opening scenes that set up the incredible tragedy to follow, to the well-staged parade sequence that leads to a haunting fade-out.  One thing is certain: it is impossible not to think about and discuss all that has been witnessed, and that's what great films are all about.  Yes, Eastwood and screenwriter Brian Helgeland leave out one crucial piece of dialog from Dennis Lehane's novel, and yes that omission leaves the viewer in limbo as to the story's outcome, but it is done on purpose, since what happens between Penn's and Bacon's characters in the future is not important.  What is important is what has happened to that point.  It should come as no shock to anyone that Eastwood's favorite film (as he has said in the past) is ""The Ox-Bow Incident,"" which explores the futility of violent revenge and mob justice, since his two masterworks, ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"" both deal with this very issue.Actually, I am avoiding discussing the plot for good reason:  for once I don't want to spoil a single moment of a film for anyone.  Suffice it to say, it is one of the most eloquent statements against child abuse and for the importance of dealing with childhood trauma I have ever seen, embodied by the sad, broken shell of a man played beautifully by Robbins.  He is matched by the epitomy of uncontrolled fury that is Penn's Jimmy Markum.  Whether or not you believe Penn's performance is the best in decades, like some critics have suggested, one thing is certain:  he and Eastwood have achieved the kind of legendary collaboration that evokes the memory of Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront"" or, more recently, Martin Scorcese and Robert DeNiro in ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Mean Streets"" and ""Raging Bull.""  And the rest of the cast is on the same level:  Bacon and Laurence Fishburne as police detectives investigating the murder of Penn's daughter, former child star Tom Guiry, in an eye-opening role as chief suspect and boyfriend of the dead girl, and, especially, Laura Linney and Oscar nominee Marcia Gay Harden as Penn's and Robbins' wives.  Linney, in particular, has the film's knockout (and most discussed/maligned) scene in which she evokes the spirit of Lady MacBeth to justify Penn's actions, while Harden beautifully underplays the role of tortured spouse who suspects her husband of a heinous act.As far as Eastwood's direction, it is simply beyond reproach, justifying his ""Unforgiven"" Oscar.  In fact, these two films make a great double feature, since the themes are similar.  Helgeland skillfully adapted Lehane's novel with economy and impeccable instincts on what to leave intact and what to streamline.  Joel Cox's editing is crisp and professional, and the production design is stunning--notice how everything, including the clothing and interior furnishings are in colors of blue and dark gray, to reflect the ever-present river in which all the secrets of the film are buried.  This color scheme is so subtle that while it's obvious the film has a blue hue to it, it wan't until a second viewing that I noticed why.  And while many viewers hate the Eastwood-penned music, I find it absolutely inobtrusive and appropriate to the mood of the piece.In all, ""Mystic River"" is an absolute masterpiece and one of the few films in recent memory that deserves to stand alongside the great dramas of the early '70's, including ""Chinatown"" and ""The Conversation."" (""The House of Sand and Fog"" is another.)As far as the DVD goes, splurge and buy the three-disc special edition, which includes a beautiful wide-screen transfer, a CD with Eastwood's score (and two great jazz tracks by son Kyle), and a disc of extras including two informative documentaries and complete Charlie Rose interviews with Bacon, Robbins and Eastwood that were recorded at the film's release.  Also, Robbins and Bacon contribute a commentary track where they discuss Eastwood's directorial style, which they found refreshing and beyond reproach.  The non-special edition DVD simply contains a widescreen (or pan-and-scan) print and nothing else, so it's hardly worth the effort.  Verdict:  ***** for the film and the special edition DVD; ***1/2 for the regular edition (film *****, DVD **)",5,An instant classic with phenomenal performances,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,4706,"['Mystic', 'River', 'instant', 'classic', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'star', 'trio', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'way', 'three', 'youngsters', 'who', 'play', 'children', 'opening', 'sequence.If', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'never', 'made', 'movie', 'Mystic', 'River', 'would', 'serve', 'same', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'swan', 'song', 'John', 'Wayne', 'achieved', 'Shootist', 'Meticulously', 'crafted', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'film', 'incredible', 'wallop', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'opening', 'scenes', 'set', 'up', 'incredible', 'tragedy', 'follow', 'well-staged', 'parade', 'sequence', 'haunting', 'fade-out', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'impossible', 'not', 'think', 'discuss', 'been', 'witnessed', 'what', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'Yes', 'Eastwood', 'screenwriter', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'leave', 'out', 'one', 'crucial', 'piece', 'dialog', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'novel', 'yes', 'omission', 'viewer', 'limbo', 'story', 'outcome', 'done', 'purpose', 'what', 'Penn', 'Bacon', 'characters', 'future', 'not', 'important', 'What', 'important', 'what', 'happened', 'point', 'should', 'come', 'shock', 'anyone', 'Eastwood', 'favorite', 'film', 'said', 'past', 'Ox-Bow', 'Incident', 'futility', 'violent', 'revenge', 'mob', 'justice', 'two', 'masterworks', 'Unforgiven', 'Mystic', 'River', 'deal', 'very', 'issue.Actually', 'am', 'avoiding', 'discussing', 'plot', 'good', 'reason', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'single', 'moment', 'film', 'anyone', 'Suffice', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'eloquent', 'statements', 'child', 'abuse', 'importance', 'dealing', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'embodied', 'sad', 'broken', 'shell', 'man', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Robbins', 'matched', 'epitomy', 'uncontrolled', 'fury', 'Penn', 'Jimmy', 'Markum', 'Whether', 'not', 'believe', 'Penn', 'performance', 'best', 'decades', 'critics', 'have', 'suggested', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'Eastwood', 'have', 'achieved', 'kind', 'legendary', 'collaboration', 'memory', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Waterfront', 'more', 'recently', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'rest', 'cast', 'same', 'level', 'Bacon', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'police', 'detectives', 'investigating', 'murder', 'Penn', 'daughter', 'former', 'child', 'star', 'Tom', 'Guiry', 'eye-opening', 'role', 'chief', 'suspect', 'boyfriend', 'dead', 'girl', 'especially', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Penn', 'Robbins', 'wives', 'Linney', 'particular', 'film', 'knockout', 'most', 'discussed/maligned', 'scene', 'spirit', 'Lady', 'MacBeth', 'justify', 'Penn', 'actions', 'Harden', 'beautifully', 'role', 'tortured', 'spouse', 'who', 'husband', 'heinous', 'act.As', 'far', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'simply', 'reproach', 'justifying', 'Unforgiven', 'Oscar', 'fact', 'two', 'films', 'make', 'great', 'double', 'feature', 'themes', 'are', 'similar', 'Helgeland', 'skillfully', 'adapted', 'Lehane', 'novel', 'economy', 'impeccable', 'instincts', 'what', 'leave', 'intact', 'what', 'streamline', 'Joel', 'Cox', 'editing', 'crisp', 'professional', 'production', 'design', 'stunning', 'notice', 'how', 'everything', 'including', 'clothing', 'interior', 'furnishings', 'are', 'colors', 'blue', 'dark', 'gray', 'reflect', 'ever-present', 'river', 'secrets', 'film', 'are', 'buried', 'color', 'scheme', 'so', 'subtle', 'obvious', 'film', 'blue', 'hue', 'wa', ""n't"", 'second', 'viewing', 'noticed', 'why', 'many', 'viewers', 'hate', 'Eastwood-penned', 'music', 'find', 'absolutely', 'inobtrusive', 'appropriate', 'mood', 'piece.In', 'Mystic', 'River', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'stand', 'great', 'dramas', 'early', ""'70"", 'including', 'Chinatown', 'Conversation', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'As', 'far', 'DVD', 'splurge', 'buy', 'three-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'beautiful', 'wide-screen', 'transfer', 'CD', 'Eastwood', 'score', 'two', 'great', 'jazz', 'tracks', 'son', 'Kyle', 'disc', 'extras', 'including', 'two', 'informative', 'documentaries', 'complete', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'interviews', 'Bacon', 'Robbins', 'Eastwood', 'were', 'recorded', 'film', 'release', 'Also', 'Robbins', 'Bacon', 'contribute', 'commentary', 'track', 'where', 'discuss', 'Eastwood', 'directorial', 'style', 'found', 'refreshing', 'reproach', 'non-special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'simply', 'widescreen', 'pan-and-scan', 'print', 'nothing', 'else', 'hardly', 'worth', 'effort', 'Verdict', '*****', 'film', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', '***1/2', 'regular', 'edition', 'film', '*****', 'DVD', '**']",N/A
819271,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0001ZX0OC,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[1, 7]","Clint Eastwood takes his 24th turn in the director's chair with ""Mystic River."" Eastwood has become an exceptional filmmaker and this movie, although flawed at times, is one of his best. He also composed the film's melancholy score. Oscar-winning screen writer Brian Helgeland has done an exceptional job at adapting Dennis Lehane's superb novel. And with a super all-star cast of actors, how can one go wrong? This film is a must-see movie for 2003.The film kicks-off with a chilling incident. Three adolescent boys are scratching their names in wet cement on a neighborhood street in Boston. A man, who appears to be a plain-clothes cop, approaches them and gives them grief about messing up the sidewalks. He orders one of the kids into his car, saying he'll drive him home where he belongs. The boy disappears for four days. When he finally does go home, it is only after escaping from a basement where he has been held and sexually abused. This incident will forever link the lives and destinies of the three.Fast-forward twenty-five years - same cast of characters, now three grown men and same Irish-American Boston neighborhood. Jimmy, (Sean Penn), went to jail for robbery when he was 21. Now he runs a convenience store. Sean, (Kevin Bacon) is a detective with the Massachusetts State Police whose wife has just walked out on him. Dave, (Tim Robbins), never really recovered from his experiences in the basement and appears emotionally numb. He's married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden). They have a nine year-old son who Dave is apparently devoted to. The men rarely get together anymore but the events of a seemingly innocent Saturday night on the town, it's prelude and violent, tragic aftermath, bring the three back together again. This intense tale of friendship, loyalty and revenge left me with a feeling of disquiet for hours after it ended.The acting is powerful. Sean Penn's Jimmy, whose grief and seething rage lie beneath a calm exterior, is the most interesting of the movie's characters. Kevin Bacon plays the good detective who wants to do right by his friend and also conduct a professional investigation. But the camera returns to Dave, time and again, as the tension builds. Dave, a lost soul, looks as if he is hanging-on to sanity by a fragile thread. Although Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden are talented actors they have relatively little face time in the movie.The film's ending is somewhat anti-climatic. The mystery builds to a crescendo but the ending doesn't pack a wallop.

819274,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B0001ZX0OC,Jason Bean,"[2, 4]","I'll admit it's been a while since I've seen Mystic River in the movie theater. While initially my impression of the film was disgust(especially with the ending) I've recently picked up the DVD and watched it again with a new perspective. Mystic River is pretentious with it's self-importance and some will still argue whether or not the hype (and subsequent Academy Awards) is justified, however the honesty and emotions running through the film make it one of the more memorable films of it's time.Mystic River is basically a melodramatic tragedy about three friends and how their actions effect the people around them. Sean's a cop, Jimmy's an ex-con, and Dave's their friend who was sexually molested when they were all kids. The movie centers around the murder of Jimmy's daughter and the actions the three friends take to deal with it. There's alot more to the story of these damaged characters and the film mostly focuses on their personal lives rather than the murder investigation itself. The movie's very raw and there is no happy ending for any of these characters. It's a very cynical story, but Clint Eastwood films Mystic River like an overbearing melodrama with over-the-top acting, camera work and music which at times is really unnecessary and gives the movie an accelerated sense of self-importance (which in my opinion is VERY annoying). I think Mystic River would've benefited with a more documentary approach and better shots of Boston (the movie's called 'Mystic River', why not show more of it?).The acting, while sometimes over-the-top is very solid and believeable. Sean Penn is well cast as Jimmy and while the scene of him finding out his daughter's dead is waaaaaay over-blown his quiet intensity rings true through the rest of the film. Tim Robbins is perfectly sympathetic as the tortured Dave and you really feel terrible about what happens to him at the end of the movie. Kevin Bacon is a great actor but I felt Sean was a bit under-used as a character, though I can understand since most of his actions in the novel focused on him investigating Jimmy's daughter's murder and the film is more about the character's personal lives.The one bit of this movie that feels like a giant misfire is in how the ending is handled. SPOILER ALERT!----------As I said in my opening I was disgusted and quite outraged with the ending of the film because in a lot of ways it seems to try and justify Jimmy's actions. Jimmy isn't supposed to be likeable despite the fact he really feels he's doing the right thing. I also hated how it de-humanized Dave and made his murder at Jimmy's hands seem ""all for the best"" with Sean's dismissiveness (in the novel Sean's much more progressive about the situation). It sort of gives the feeling that Dave deserved to die simply for being a child-rape victim. It certainly didn't help when Laurence Fishburne's character claiming Dave should be locked away simply for being a victim of sexual abuse. Sort of spreads the message that sexual abuse victims are less than human.I like to think this was just a misstep on the filmmakers part thanks to Clint Eastwoods more sensationalist direction. I like to think what happens to Dave in the end is just part of the human tragedy of the story and NOT trying to justify Jimmy's actions as a concerned parent. I don't think Jimmy and Sean's actions in the end are unbelieveable though. Jimmy's already murdered someone before so obviously what he did isn't going to haunt him for too long. Sean's too caught up with his wife and kid and despite knowing what Jimmy did feels no matter what he does now can only make a bad situation worse by going after Jimmy(or maybe he does? The ending's a bit ambiguous). It's not a satisfying ending nor do I think it's meant to be. It is however very believeable and I think that's what the filmmakers were trying for.So while Mystic River is far from the flawless masterpiece it claims to be it is a very powerful film. I can't say everyone will enjoy it, but it's a movie that no one will forget.",4,Pretentious but powerful tragedy....,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,4034,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mystic', 'River', 'movie', 'theater', 'initially', 'impression', 'film', 'was', 'disgust', 'especially', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'watched', 'again', 'new', 'perspective', 'Mystic', 'River', 'pretentious', 'self-importance', 'will', 'still', 'argue', 'not', 'hype', 'subsequent', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'justified', 'however', 'honesty', 'emotions', 'running', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'films', 'time.Mystic', 'River', 'basically', 'melodramatic', 'tragedy', 'three', 'friends', 'how', 'actions', 'effect', 'people', 'Sean', 'cop', 'Jimmy', 'ex-con', 'Dave', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'sexually', 'molested', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'movie', 'centers', 'murder', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'actions', 'three', 'friends', 'take', 'deal', 'alot', 'more', 'story', 'damaged', 'characters', 'film', 'mostly', 'personal', 'lives', 'rather', 'murder', 'investigation', 'movie', 'very', 'raw', 'happy', 'ending', 'characters', 'very', 'cynical', 'story', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'Mystic', 'River', 'overbearing', 'melodrama', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'camera', 'work', 'music', 'times', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'movie', 'accelerated', 'sense', 'self-importance', 'opinion', 'VERY', 'annoying', 'think', 'Mystic', 'River', 'would', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'more', 'documentary', 'approach', 'better', 'shots', 'Boston', 'movie', 'called', ""'Mystic"", 'River', 'why', 'not', 'show', 'more', '.The', 'acting', 'sometimes', 'over-the-top', 'very', 'solid', 'believeable', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'well', 'cast', 'Jimmy', 'scene', 'finding', 'out', 'daughter', 'dead', 'waaaaaay', 'over-blown', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'rings', 'true', 'rest', 'film', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'perfectly', 'sympathetic', 'tortured', 'Dave', 'really', 'feel', 'terrible', 'what', 'end', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'great', 'actor', 'felt', 'Sean', 'was', 'bit', 'under-used', 'character', 'can', 'understand', 'most', 'actions', 'novel', 'focused', 'investigating', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'murder', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'personal', 'lives.The', 'one', 'bit', 'movie', 'giant', 'misfire', 'how', 'ending', 'handled', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'said', 'opening', 'was', 'disgusted', 'quite', 'outraged', 'ending', 'film', 'lot', 'ways', 'try', 'justify', 'Jimmy', 'actions', 'Jimmy', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'likeable', 'fact', 'really', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'also', 'hated', 'how', 'de-humanized', 'Dave', 'made', 'murder', 'Jimmy', 'hands', 'seem', 'best', 'Sean', 'dismissiveness', 'novel', 'Sean', 'much', 'more', 'progressive', 'situation', 'sort', 'feeling', 'Dave', 'deserved', 'die', 'simply', 'being', 'child-rape', 'victim', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'character', 'claiming', 'Dave', 'should', 'be', 'locked', 'away', 'simply', 'being', 'victim', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'Sort', 'spreads', 'message', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'victims', 'are', 'less', 'human.I', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'misstep', 'filmmakers', 'part', 'thanks', 'Clint', 'Eastwoods', 'more', 'sensationalist', 'direction', 'like', 'think', 'what', 'Dave', 'end', 'just', 'part', 'human', 'tragedy', 'story', 'NOT', 'trying', 'justify', 'Jimmy', 'actions', 'concerned', 'parent', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'actions', 'end', 'are', 'unbelieveable', 'Jimmy', 'already', 'murdered', 'someone', 'so', 'obviously', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'going', 'haunt', 'too', 'long', 'Sean', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'wife', 'kid', 'knowing', 'what', 'Jimmy', 'did', 'feels', 'matter', 'what', 'now', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'bad', 'situation', 'worse', 'going', 'Jimmy', 'maybe', 'ending', 'bit', 'ambiguous', 'not', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'do', 'think', 'meant', 'be', 'however', 'very', 'believeable', 'think', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'for.So', 'Mystic', 'River', 'far', 'flawless', 'masterpiece', 'be', 'very', 'powerful', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'forget']",N/A

Moments in time in which our lives and the lives of others are altered by one singular movement, one phrase, or that one hockey shot that was just out of reach. Nothing is more true when it comes to the lives of Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins). Mystic River is an emotional and amazing film about the reconciliation of three friends and their wives by the tragic murder of Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie Markum (Emmy Rossum). This rough Boston suburb that lies on the bank of the Mystic River is thrown into sorrow and misery over the loss. Jimmy (Penn) makes a vow to find the killer of his daughter and end him and throw him into the Mystic.The story is superb. Twists and turns and changing plot lines makes this story brilliantly unpredictable. It proves nothing is what it seems. Dealing with issues of child abduction and the effects it has on the future, Mystic River watches and deals with the change n the course of someone life. What something would be like if Dave hadn't gotten into that strangers car? Katie Markum would never had been born to be murdered.The acting is bar none and has been recognized by the Academy by awarding Sean Penn and Tim Robbins best actor and best supporting role at the Oscars. Sean Penn was incredible in this film. He was so into his character. An angry gangster trying to move on with his life, and get out of his life of crime and deceit. To love his children and to be the best father he can be. Strong and determined, hard and angry he tries to deal with the grief of the loss of his last real memory of his late first wife. Penn is perfect in performing this role. Tim Robbins is also and incredible actor. A man who had been abused neglected. Finally admitting to himself of the abuse he felt. He kept himself bottled and up. An angry and almost psychopathic man, who is doing his best to try and overcome the terrors he experienced by hopping in the car. An ensemble cast also included: Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Haden, Laurence Fishburn.Mystic River is truly amazing. Clint Eastwood is an incredible director.

819280,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,B0001ZX0OC,Jeremy Berman,"[4, 6]","Over the years, director Clint Eastwood has slowly amassed a collection of film credits that are as eclectic as they are impressive. He has tackled everything from commercial potboilers (Absolute Power), romantic tearjerkers (The Bridges of Madison County) and somber westerns (the Oscar winning Unforgiven) with equal degrees of thoughtfulness and visual flair. Additionally, Kevin Bacon has gone on record as saying that Eastwood runs ""the classiest set"" in Hollywood and is adept at getting complex and engaging performances out of ensemble casts. In the mesmerizing Mystic River, Eastwood uses his considerable talents to tell a haunting and thought-provoking story about the ramifications of violence in a cruel and unjust world. Rather then pummel his audience with gratuitous images of carnage and slaughter, the director has brilliantly analyzed the psychological consequences of aggression and brutality on those who witness it and those who become its victims.The story centers on the fates of Jimmy Marcum (Sean Penn), Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) and Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), three childhood friends who became distant from one another after David was abducted and raped by two mysterious men. They are brought back together when Jimmy's daughter Katie is brutally murdered outside a bar and Sean (now a police detective) comes to believe that Dave might be a suspect.Each of the main characters has been warped and disturbed by violence, and the bulk of the film is devoted to the gripping examination of their defects. Dave's childhood experiences transform him into a listless, despairing ""zombie"" who can't find purpose or meaning in his life and is forced to work almost incessantly to keep his suppressed rage at humanity from coming to the surface. Sean has found a more productive calling in law enforcement, but the endless barrage of anger and killings that he encounters in his line of work have made him cold and desensitized to human suffering (to the point where his wife has left him). To him, the chance to investigate the murder of someone he was at least somewhat acquainted with is an opportunity to re-awaken his human compassion and sensitivity. The death of Jimmy's daughter rekindles the values of his former criminal career, changing him from a mild-mannered family man into a heartbroken avenger who is more than angry enough to harm the former friend who might be responsible for his pain. Penn, Bacon and Robbins each explore every nuance and motivation of their characters with depth and sensitivity, and in a perfect world they would all would have received Oscar nominations. In reality, the subtle resonance of Bacon's characterization was overlooked in favor of the flashier turns by Penn and Robbins.The provocative question that Mystic River poses to its audience is whether violence is a legitimate response to other forms of violence that seem to threaten those you love. Sean and his partner Whitey (a charmingly cynical Laurence Fishburne) have devoted their lives to a profession that believes it isn't, but Jimmy's wife Annabeth (the stunning Laura Linney) is more than willing to risk a few dead bodies if it ensures the safety of her children and the stability of her household. Ultimately, it is ability of Mystic River to get average people talking about the justifications for violence and the morality of revenge that guarantees that this film will be regarded as one of the first true masterpieces of new millennium.",5,Eastwood's Crowning Achievement,1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,3473,"['years', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'slowly', 'amassed', 'collection', 'film', 'credits', 'are', 'as', 'eclectic', 'are', 'impressive', 'tackled', 'everything', 'commercial', 'potboilers', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'romantic', 'tearjerkers', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'somber', 'westerns', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Unforgiven', 'equal', 'degrees', 'thoughtfulness', 'visual', 'flair', 'Additionally', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'gone', 'record', 'saying', 'Eastwood', 'classiest', 'set', 'Hollywood', 'adept', 'getting', 'complex', 'engaging', 'performances', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'mesmerizing', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Eastwood', 'considerable', 'talents', 'tell', 'haunting', 'thought-provoking', 'story', 'ramifications', 'violence', 'cruel', 'unjust', 'world', 'then', 'pummel', 'audience', 'gratuitous', 'images', 'carnage', 'slaughter', 'director', 'brilliantly', 'analyzed', 'psychological', 'consequences', 'aggression', 'brutality', 'who', 'witness', 'who', 'become', 'victims.The', 'story', 'centers', 'fates', 'Jimmy', 'Marcum', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'three', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'became', 'distant', 'one', 'David', 'was', 'abducted', 'raped', 'two', 'mysterious', 'men', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'together', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'Katie', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'bar', 'Sean', 'now', 'police', 'detective', 'believe', 'Dave', 'might', 'be', 'suspect.Each', 'main', 'characters', 'been', 'warped', 'disturbed', 'violence', 'bulk', 'film', 'devoted', 'gripping', 'examination', 'defects', 'Dave', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'transform', 'listless', 'despairing', 'zombie', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'life', 'forced', 'work', 'almost', 'incessantly', 'keep', 'suppressed', 'rage', 'humanity', 'coming', 'surface', 'Sean', 'found', 'more', 'productive', 'calling', 'law', 'enforcement', 'endless', 'barrage', 'anger', 'killings', 'line', 'work', 'have', 'made', 'cold', 'desensitized', 'human', 'suffering', 'point', 'where', 'wife', 'left', 'chance', 'investigate', 'murder', 'someone', 'was', 'least', 'somewhat', 'acquainted', 'opportunity', 're-awaken', 'human', 'compassion', 'sensitivity', 'death', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'values', 'former', 'criminal', 'career', 'changing', 'mild-mannered', 'family', 'man', 'heartbroken', 'avenger', 'who', 'more', 'angry', 'enough', 'harm', 'former', 'friend', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'responsible', 'pain', 'Penn', 'Bacon', 'Robbins', 'explore', 'nuance', 'motivation', 'characters', 'depth', 'sensitivity', 'perfect', 'world', 'would', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'reality', 'subtle', 'resonance', 'Bacon', 'characterization', 'was', 'overlooked', 'favor', 'flashier', 'Penn', 'Robbins.The', 'provocative', 'question', 'Mystic', 'River', 'audience', 'violence', 'legitimate', 'response', 'other', 'forms', 'violence', 'seem', 'threaten', 'love', 'Sean', 'partner', 'Whitey', 'charmingly', 'cynical', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'have', 'devoted', 'lives', 'profession', ""n't"", 'Jimmy', 'wife', 'Annabeth', 'stunning', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'more', 'willing', 'risk', 'few', 'dead', 'bodies', 'safety', 'children', 'stability', 'household', 'Ultimately', 'ability', 'Mystic', 'River', 'get', 'average', 'people', 'talking', 'justifications', 'violence', 'morality', 'revenge', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'first', 'true', 'masterpieces', 'new', 'millennium']",N/A

I for one was deceived into seeing it by the hype. The trailers were enticing as well. But immediately after having seen it I was left with an emptiness and months later, I still find no quality in it that deserves the praise, ""Best movie of the year.""Many reviewers here have already rehashed the plot and commented on the acting. Some have said it's a valuable critique of vigilante justice. I don't find that. To me, it seems as if director Clint Eastwood is getting more and more postmodern in his art and political musings. Eastwood's postmodern shift started most noticeably with Unforgiven, which I do regard as an excellent movie, but through the rest of the '90s and up to the present, Clint has left me dissatisfied with movies like True Crime and Bloodwork. Even the wonderfully filmed Bridges of Madison County left me uneasy with its ambiguous moral lesson.Mystic River is a low point. It starts out well, with deep characterization and gripping emotions, but it fails to deliver what viewers want: resolution. Or are we supposed to be satisfied with an ending that makes right and wrong relative? That what happens to Tim Robbins' character is karmic destiny? I left the theater appalled at the lack of justice in the story. Am I being unrealistic? Don't we all strive for justice and are not satisfied without it?Considering the socio-political leanings of actors Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, and to some degree Kevin Bacon, this was probably a fitting vehicle for their worldview.",2,"Tsk, tsk, Clint",1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,1579,"['movie', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'hype', 'got', 'critics', 'lemming-like', 'fans', 'one', 'was', 'deceived', 'seeing', 'hype', 'trailers', 'were', 'enticing', 'as', 'well', 'immediately', 'having', 'seen', 'was', 'left', 'emptiness', 'months', 'later', 'still', 'find', 'quality', 'praise', 'Best', 'movie', 'year', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'rehashed', 'plot', 'commented', 'acting', 'have', 'said', 'valuable', 'critique', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'postmodern', 'art', 'political', 'musings', 'Eastwood', 'postmodern', 'shift', 'started', 'most', 'noticeably', 'Unforgiven', 'do', 'regard', 'excellent', 'movie', 'rest', ""'90s"", 'up', 'present', 'Clint', 'left', 'dissatisfied', 'movies', 'True', 'Crime', 'Bloodwork', 'Even', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'left', 'uneasy', 'ambiguous', 'moral', 'lesson.Mystic', 'River', 'low', 'point', 'out', 'well', 'deep', 'characterization', 'gripping', 'emotions', 'deliver', 'what', 'viewers', 'want', 'resolution', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'right', 'wrong', 'relative', 'what', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'karmic', 'destiny', 'left', 'theater', 'appalled', 'lack', 'justice', 'story', 'Am', 'being', 'unrealistic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'strive', 'justice', 'are', 'not', 'satisfied', 'Considering', 'socio-political', 'leanings', 'actors', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'degree', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'probably', 'fitting', 'vehicle', 'worldview']",N/A

The viewer is delivered straight into the scene of a horrifying child abduction and it is hard not to share empathy and/or trauma with the onscreen characters.About 30 yrs after the abduction we witness takes place is when the real story begins- a story of three neighborhood friends, one the shell shocked survivor of the earlier abduction (Tim Robbins), one a Boston homicide detective (Kevin Bacon)and one a former thug turned local shop owner (Sean Penn).When Sean Penns late teen daughter is murdered, the three former buddies are reunited in the gritty Boston neighborhood of their chidhood.There are some great moments here- director Clint Eastwood recreates the shock and disbelief that comes with unspeakable tragedy very well and he does an excellent job illustrating a fathers trauma and the very sad and surreal hours after the initial murder.Mystic River failed me several ways. For such a compelling opening and build-up you will likely be disappointed by the plot turns the script takes. Implausible chains of events, past relations and a ""perfect storm"" timeline that confuses investigators. If the plot is examined realistically (Occams Razor anyone?) it becomes improbable and something more suited for a Cinemax straight-to-video erotic thriller. Minus the erotic of course.Film budget and maybe more could have been saved by shooting Mystic River without the three big stars in the three big roles. Unknown or little know talents could have brought more credibility to the roles, particularly of Sean Penns New England tough guy act that wears thin and Tim Robbins basket case abuse victim who is good at affecting the facial expression of a damaged and lost soul but little else. Again, casting botches by trying to push the ""versatility"" of the leads when they could have made a better film even with known entities like Denis Leary or Chazz Palmenteri.There are some great support roles. Marcia Gay Harden is first rate as the troubled wife of a troubled man whose inner fears and loyalty clash with every move of her eyes.Laurence Fishburne is very buyable as Kevin Bacons homicide detective partner who provides a certain clarity because of his lack of connection to the neighborhood crime scene.

For those who have read the book, and thus know the outcome of the mystery, the story's tragic dimensions are even more striking.  But those who watch it knowing nothing, it is a gripping, powerful who-dunit that goes far deeper into the psyches of the characters than almost any other mystery you can think of. I have to give Helgeland and Eastwood tremendous credit for finding graceful ways to deposit the bits and pieces of exposition that are essential to fully appreciating the story.  There are a lot of facts you learn about each character, and while some things are necessarily left out (most crucially, the plot line having to do with Katie's previous boyfriend, which is one of the reasons she's so determined to leave town), the film's creators find a way to compress the information and action without destroying the underlying logic of the story, or allowing it to become too talky.As I write, Sean Penn was just awarded the Oscar for best actor--it is entirely deserved.  As good as he's been in films ranging from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" to ""Dead Man Walking,"" this movie is his personal best.  Tim Robbins, another winner, is perhaps even slightly better, and more surprising.  Too bad there wasn't room for another award for Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden or Laurence Fishburne, all of whom do great work. The more obscure character actors who play the Savage brothers are incredibly believable.  Laura Linney's part probably suffers from too little screen time--another area where the creators had to make cuts they probably would've rather avoided, because the character Linney plays (Sean Penn's wife) is one of the most surprising in the book.The ultimate star of this movie, however, is the great Clint Eastwood.  I cannot imagine someone doing a better job of bringing together an ensemble like this to inhabit such a realistically-portrayed world.

However the movie is incredible in my opinion, Sean Penn delivers one of the best performances of his career and yet is STILL blown away in my humble opinion by Tim Robbins. Now I am going to dance around certain issues here to make sure I do not give away any twists and turns in the movie, and believe me there are quite a few. Penn does an amazing job as portraying a rough and tough guy whereas Tim Robbins comes across as a softer, little more gullible man. The movie starts off with a story from the past about the three men as boys and then pans to the present where the three men's (Penn, Robbins and Bacon) lives are intertwined once again through a very tragic circumstance. One though I should warn about is that this is not one of the feel-good movies of the year, although the story itself is amazing and Clint Eastwood in my opinion delivers his most stellar performance so far, I have to urge you not to see this movie if you are not in the mood for something heavy, and don't expect to be leaving the theater, or in the future, turning off your DVD player without actually feeling sad and feel like something heavy is weighing on you.

819299,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0001ZX0OC,Joseph Haschka,"[1, 3]","MYSTIC RIVER may win Clint Eastwood an Oscar for Best Director, but I'd be surprised if the film wins Best Picture because it concludes with too many loose ends and thus fails as a conventional morality play. A rough justice of sorts was at least served in Clint's Oscar-winning UNFORGIVEN.In the opening sequence, three boyhood pals - Jimmy, Dave and Sean - are playing on the streets of Boston. Jimmy goads the other two into defacing a freshly-poured square of concrete sidewalk. A car pulls up, apparently carrying two plain-clothes cops, one of whom berates the lads for their antisocial behavior. Ultimately, Dave is carried off by the police, ostensibly to be driven home and reported to his mother. In fact, the officers are child molesters in disguise, and Dave is cruelly abused in a cellar for four days before he escapes.Decades later, the three still live in Boston. Jimmy (Sean Penn), now a tough-guy ex-con, runs a neighborhood convenience grocery. He's married with three daughters, the oldest being Katie (Emmy Rossum), the apple of his eye. Dave (Tim Robbins), a handyman, is married with one son. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a homicide investigator with the Boston PD.Late one night, Dave arrives home with a mangled hand and a superficial slash across his stomach. He claims he was attacked by a mugger, and in the ensuing struggle perhaps killed his assailant. The next morning, the police receive report of an abandoned car with a bloodied interior  and a bullet hole in the driver's seat back. The vehicle turns out to be Katie's, and her corpse is soon found in a nearby park. She's been brutally beaten and fatally shot after, apparently, being pursued by her killer. Sean is assigned as lead investigator.Dave's wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) scans the dailies expecting to find report of the dead mugger. Such never appears, and a corrosive doubt eats at her mind. Whom did Dave really kill?The three principals in this gritty, take-no-prisoners piece (Penn, Robbins, and Bacon) give three noteworthy performances. Those of Penn and Robbins are particularly excellent, and surely merit Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nominations respectively.The core of MYSTIC RIVER is not the procedural identification of Katie's killer. Indeed, there are glaring logic lapses as both Jimmy and Sean seek the answer. Moreover, the involvement of the latter and the BPD serve only as the socially acceptable and expected counterpoint to a plot that has little to do with a legal resolution to the crime. Rather, it's an unrelentingly dark tale of deep emotional disturbances resulting from severe childhood trauma, and the potential for extra-legal, primal violence inherent in the philosophy &quot;a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do&quot;. I found the film's ending unsatisfying because of its loose ends. But that's not overly important, because the unsettling nature of Eastwood's message is embodied in the Getting There and not the Destination.You might think that MYSTIC RIVER is a Guy Flick. But that the female of the species also has a role to play in tribalism is indicated by the message given Jimmy by his wife Annabeth (Laura Linney) in the last minutes of the film.

Perhaps I was more sympathetic to Tim Robbins' character's sincere efforts to control his urges than I was to Sean Penn's manic rages, but one need not be conflicted to sense that something is morally and ethically amiss. There is never really any doubt (at least for the audience) of Dave Boyle's innocence of the murder of Jimmy Marcus's daughter, yet Marcus' thuggish character over-rides any such concerns. Marcus coerces a ""confession"" from Boyle after telling him he will let him live, and then once Marcus' pre-conceived notion is thus confirmed, he kills Boyle anyways. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) shows up just in time to tell Marcus that he has killed an innocent man, and Marcus' reaction can be summed as a ""so what."" The end of the film doesn't ask any gray moral or ethical questions--quite the contrary. Devine and Marcus wave and smile at each other, as if justice was served--the daughter was an innocent, Boyle was innocent, and they're both dead. It all ""evens out"" in some warped way. The pathetic Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) the only person who apparently cared if Boyle lived or died, is left unnoticed and marginalized. The last ten minutes of the film, thus, makes what transpired before filmmaking mendacity.What exactly was the message Clint Eastwood was trying to convey here?

819301,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B0001ZX0OC,Josh Hitchens,"[16, 20]","Adapted from Dennis Lehane's critically acclaimed novel, Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" is a masterful achievement. It does nothing less than elevate contemporary working-class Boston into the realm of Shakespearean tragedy. The film is superbly crafted by screenwriter Brian Helgeland and may turn out to be Clint Eastwood's crowning masterpiece as a director. It also helps that Eastwood has assembled one of the finest ensemble casts in years to act out this deep, gripping story. When you have Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney in the same movie, there isn't a lot that can go wrong. And very little does.""Mystic River"" is the story of three men and the past events that haunt them in adulthood. Jimmy (Penn), Sean (Bacon), and Dave (Robbins) were friends when they were children, until one day Dave is abducted by two men pretending to be police officers. They sexually abuse him and he manages to escape four days later. The story then shifts to the present day, where the three have grown apart from one another. Then the murder of Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter brings them back together.Sean Penn gives a furious, impressive performance here, for which he won the Oscar for Best Actor. His Jimmy Markham is toughened by the prison time he has done, but will do anything to protect his wife and children. Although there are moments when Penn seems to be showing off how good of an actor he is and going slightly overboard, there is an intensity in his characterization that is mesmerizing. The scenes where Jimmy mourns his murdered daughter are some of the most moving depictions of grief I have ever seen on film.As the severely disturbed Dave Boyle, Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career. Dave is haunted by what happened to him as a child, and he can do nothing to escape his memories of it. Robbins is astounding to watch, his body sagging with the weight of a lifetime, his eyes filled with fear and shame. It's no wonder that Robbins won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Marcia Gay Harden also turns in solid work as Dave's troubled wife Celeste, who thinks her husband might be a killer. Harden spends much of the film on the edge of hysteria, wracked with guilt. It could have been a thankless role, but Harden makes it count.With all of the emoting from Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, it would be easy to dismiss Kevin Bacon's work here. As Sean, a homicide detective who has recently been deserted by his wife, Bacon has the least flashy of the three main roles. But with admirable subtlety, Bacon skillfully etches a portrait of a man whose non-nonsense exterior conceals a deep well of pain. As his partner, Laurence Fishburne provides the solid support needed to make the murder investigation plot work.Mention must also be made of Laura Linney's superb performance. As Jimmy's wife Annabeth, Linney seems to be always in the background, observing. In fact, she barely seems to be in the movie at all. Then she has an astonishing scene at the end of the film, a simple dialogue with her husband where she reveals the Lady Macbeth-like depths of her character. It makes your jaw drop. It is a compliment to Laura Linney's extreme talent as an actress that she almost steals the movie with about ten minutes of screen time.""Mystic River"" is a dark, brooding, masterpiece of a film.

I was completely down for personal retribution for the murder of the daughter. I felt his pain. I even cried with him. I, too, thought Tim Robins was a little suspect. But I get hung up on this simple scene from the movie: When Penn was in the morgue looking at the daughter, he swore he would avenge the daughter's death. Swore on his own life. Did he do that?

Personally I felt that this movie was a well made film but I think it got more praise than it deserved.  I'm really glad that it only won its Oscars for its acting because when it came down to the story it was just an above average crime drama.  What makes the movie above average is that it doesn't just deal with the ""whodunnit"" factor, it really incorporates the characters into the story. There is so much character development that it really shows the audience the true darkness of human nature.  Everybody was praising Clint Eastwood for this movie when all the credit should go to the actors and actresses in the picture.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Marcia Gay Harden (I still can't figure out how someone can get a name like that) all gave stellar performances. I really feel that it was overrated.  It is one of the greatest crime dramas out there its just that so is Se7en, and so is Life of David Gale.  A great movie that had so much support from the critics that it ended up being loved by everybody.VIDEO: Very nice transfer from warner that really handles the dark scenes very well.AUDIO: The 5.1 mix is a little soft in places but overall decent.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: This review is pertaining to the 3 disc edition.  The Digipak comes in a slip sleeve and folds out into three segment. In the center you have the feature disc, and on the right you have the other two discs overlapping each other in a design that was done with the Pink Panther Film Collection. The left flap is just printed cardboard.  Disc 1 just has a commentary. Disc 2 has a platter of really ""movie buff"" extras.  First up is the standard making of, a 23 minute featurette called Mystic River- Beneath the Surface.  Next is an 11 minute segment titled Mystic River- From Page to Screen, mainly dealing with the actors.  Then there are The Charlie Rose Show Interviews. Eastwood's interview is 42 minutes, Robbins' is 50 minutes, and Bacon's is 19 minutes. These are not bull interviews but real good conversations about the movie. Disc 3 is the soundtrack to the film, which I was not a fan of. I really think Eastwood shouldn't have composed the soundtrack because I felt that it was too unemotional.  Maybe he wanted it that way so that all the emotion could come from the fine acting, but I just felt that it didn't support the tone of the movie as well as it could have. Overall it's a 2-disc version with the soundtrack attached. Definately worth buying versus the single disc edition.

Who is the murderer is not the question that prompts the movie forward but it is our inquisitive notion for the character's behavioral process that keeps our mind churning.Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted by Brian Helgeland, it tells the story of three childhood friends who will forever retain a traumatic memory of the abduction and sexual abuse of one of them. Jimmy, Sean, and Dave will never forget that bleak day in an Irish neighborhood in Boston when two men impersonating as cops apprehends Dave into their vehicle after they witness the boys violating public property.

819310,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0001ZX0OC,Kenji Fujishima,"[2, 5]","Well, since i see a lot of reviews having already been written for a DVD that hasn't been released yet, I might as well add my own take to this mostly wonderful film.I saw this in the theater many months ago, so some of the film's details may be fuzzy. But the memory of the film's tangle of powerful emotions, as well as its great performances and tragic ending, have remained vivid in my mind.While the destination is devastating and even chilling, the journey itself isn't perfect. For some reason, I never warmed to Clint Eastwood's music score---it sounded like a third-rate Aaron Copland imitation, and it was insufficient at highlighting emotions the way Eastwood clearly intended. I was disappointed that the solution to the mystery of who killed the Markums' daughter was so arbitrary, not to mention arbitrarily handled throughout the film. Yes, I understand that, in the final analysis, the mystery and its solution doesn't truly matter as much as the tangled emotions it arises in its main characters. Still, I found it a small disappointment (although perhaps that same solution is in Dennis Lehane's novel; I wouldn't know, since I, alas, have not read it). As for the subplot involving Sean Devine's wife---who is always silent whenever she calls him until the end---I concede that it is debatable as to whether it serves any justifiable purpose in the film, although I will also admit that I was hardly bothered by it at all while watching it.Maybe that is an indication as to what a powerful film this is cumulatively. Despite the aforementioned missteps, Clint Eastwood gets the big things right: particularly the performances, but also the mood, the texture, and the elucidation of the major themes. Sean Penn may be the more flamboyant actor (not that his sheer power detracts from his performance here at all), but Tim Robbins has the pivotal role as the child abuse-scarred Dave Boyle (it is, the way I see it, the story of Dave's personal tragedy above all else), and he comes through with a heartbreaking performance that is fully worthy of the Best Supporting Oscar he won at this past year's ceremony. In fact, in its overall impact, MYSTIC RIVER was really the best of the five Best Picture Nominees this past year. Certainly it has more authentic humanity than anything in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy (impressive though they were technically, although really the two are not in contention).In short, MYSTIC RIVER may not be perfect, but it is still a great and powerful film, one definitely worth seeing at least once.",4,"Imperfect along the way, but the destination is devastating",1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,2548,"['Well', 'i', 'see', 'lot', 'reviews', 'having', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'yet', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'add', 'own', 'take', 'mostly', 'wonderful', 'film.I', 'saw', 'theater', 'many', 'months', 'ago', 'film', 'details', 'may', 'be', 'fuzzy', 'memory', 'film', 'tangle', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'performances', 'tragic', 'ending', 'have', 'remained', 'vivid', 'mind.While', 'destination', 'devastating', 'even', 'chilling', 'journey', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'reason', 'never', 'warmed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'music', 'score', '-it', 'sounded', 'third-rate', 'Aaron', 'Copland', 'imitation', 'was', 'insufficient', 'highlighting', 'emotions', 'way', 'Eastwood', 'clearly', 'intended', 'was', 'disappointed', 'solution', 'mystery', 'who', 'killed', 'Markums', 'daughter', 'was', 'so', 'arbitrary', 'not', 'mention', 'arbitrarily', 'handled', 'film', 'Yes', 'understand', 'final', 'analysis', 'mystery', 'solution', ""n't"", 'truly', 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'tangled', 'emotions', 'main', 'characters', 'Still', 'found', 'small', 'disappointment', 'perhaps', 'same', 'solution', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'novel', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'alas', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'wife', '-who', 'always', 'silent', 'whenever', 'end', '-I', 'concede', 'debatable', 'justifiable', 'purpose', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'admit', 'was', 'hardly', 'bothered', 'watching', 'it.Maybe', 'indication', 'what', 'powerful', 'film', 'cumulatively', 'aforementioned', 'missteps', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'big', 'things', 'right', 'particularly', 'performances', 'also', 'mood', 'texture', 'elucidation', 'major', 'themes', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'flamboyant', 'actor', 'not', 'sheer', 'power', 'detracts', 'performance', 'here', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'pivotal', 'role', 'child', 'abuse-scarred', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'way', 'see', 'story', 'Dave', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'else', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'fully', 'worthy', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Oscar', 'won', 'past', 'year', 'ceremony', 'fact', 'overall', 'impact', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'was', 'really', 'best', 'five', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Nominees', 'past', 'year', 'Certainly', 'more', 'authentic', 'humanity', 'anything', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'trilogy', 'impressive', 'were', 'technically', 'really', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'contention', 'short', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'still', 'great', 'powerful', 'film', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once']",N/A

Sean Penn gives his best performance in MYSTIC RIVER, and Tom Robbins is also unforgettable.  Poor Kevin Bacon on the other hand is saddled with a ludicrous role as the policeman whose wife has gone AWOL, and when this storyline resolves with a final phone call, you could hear people in the theater break into derisive laughter for it is so cheeseball.In general the women are not as well served as the men, and Laura Linney in particular is badly miscast as a sour, nearly unreadable Boston Lady Macbeth.  Meanwhile Marcia Gay Harden is running all over town casting glances of loathing and suspicion at her poor husband, telegraphing his ending a mile away.  I wonder if this film isn't Clint's allegory for Cold War politics, with Harden playing one of those called by HUAC who wound up ""naming names.""  The three boys who play Penn, Bacon and Robbins as little boys are remarkable like their adult counterparts, a sign of the care Eastwood displays throughout every minute of this vital, leathery tale of revenge and displacement.",3,Dark Allegory,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1440,"['Eastwood', 'always', 'get', 'good', 'performances', 'actors', 'set', 'totally', 'relaxed', 'yet', 'super', 'efficient', 'several', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'would', 'take', 'most', 'other', 'directors', 'days', 'apiece', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'completed', 'one', 'day', 'exhilaration', 'almost', 'roller', 'coaster', 'feel', 'when', 'compared', 'ordinarily', 'glacial', 'pace', 'most', 'bug', 'studio', 'filmmaking', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'best', 'performance', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'Tom', 'Robbins', 'also', 'unforgettable', 'Poor', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'other', 'hand', 'saddled', 'ludicrous', 'role', 'policeman', 'wife', 'gone', 'AWOL', 'when', 'storyline', 'final', 'phone', 'call', 'could', 'hear', 'people', 'theater', 'break', 'derisive', 'laughter', 'so', 'cheeseball.In', 'general', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'served', 'men', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'particular', 'badly', 'miscast', 'sour', 'nearly', 'unreadable', 'Boston', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'Meanwhile', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'running', 'town', 'casting', 'glances', 'loathing', 'suspicion', 'poor', 'husband', 'telegraphing', 'ending', 'mile', 'away', 'wonder', 'film', ""n't"", 'Clint', 'allegory', 'Cold', 'War', 'politics', 'Harden', 'playing', 'one', 'called', 'HUAC', 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'naming', 'names', 'three', 'boys', 'who', 'play', 'Penn', 'Bacon', 'Robbins', 'little', 'boys', 'are', 'remarkable', 'adult', 'counterparts', 'sign', 'care', 'Eastwood', 'displays', 'minute', 'vital', 'leathery', 'tale', 'revenge', 'displacement']",N/A

Eastwood brings out the drama through thorough character development by creating a connected history for the characters that continues throughout the film.  The cinematography is well balanced with terrific performances by the cast (including Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne and many others), which displays a realistic atmosphere.  This atmosphere creates a clash between the screen and the viewer as the story depicts some disturbing elements.  The disturbing elements provide a suspenseful tension that does not let go even after the end credits.The story begins with one of the three main characters being kidnapped and molested as a child by two strangers.  This traumatic experience plays an essential role in the story as it connects the main characters and attributes to their personalities.  This attribution of personal characteristics pulls the audience into an unwanted, yet unavoidable direction.

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[6, 10]","Mystic River opens in a dreary lower middle-class suburb of Boston in the 1970s, where 3 young friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave are killing time just being boys, playing street hockey and getting up to minor mischief. One of them, Dave, is then kidnapped in front of his friends, by a pair of child molesters masquerading as plainclothes police. We then learn that he escaped from their clutches after four days of sexual abuse at their hands, but was obviously deeply scarred mentally. The film then flashes forward to the same area, but in the present day.The three guys, though they have drifted apart, are still living in the same neighbourhood. The daughter of one of the three, Jimmy Markum, played by Sean Penn (I am Sam, Thin Red Line, Dead Man Walking), has been murdered recently. One of the other three, Sean, played by Kevin Bacon (Footloose, Flatliners, Hollow Man) is the investigating police officer. The remaining member of the trio, Dave, played by Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Arlington Rd) is the prime suspect in the case.Mystic River is a good, old-fashioned murder mystery in which the tension and plot thickens effectively over the duration of the film. There are plenty of plot twists and red herrings to keep the viewer guessing till the last few minutes. The film is ably directed by the great Clint Eastwood, at the helm of his 24th film. In this film, like in just about all his films, he doesn't try anything flashy or groundbreaking at the helm but is sensitive and competent and builds and maintains a good pace and tension. Despite his long career in action based films, Eastwood seems particularly at ease directing (and acting) in films with a strong focus on characters rather than simply action.This is primarily a dialogue driven story, with powerful acting from the three leads, supported ably by some great actors including Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney. Indeed, the performances of Penn and Robbins garnered them the Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. This was the first time since Ben-Hur in 1959 in which the two awards have been won in the same film.",5,A Powerful Movie,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,2148,"['Mystic', 'River', 'dreary', 'lower', 'middle-class', 'suburb', 'Boston', '1970s', 'where', '3', 'young', 'friends', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'Dave', 'are', 'killing', 'time', 'just', 'being', 'boys', 'playing', 'street', 'hockey', 'getting', 'up', 'minor', 'mischief', 'One', 'Dave', 'then', 'kidnapped', 'front', 'friends', 'pair', 'child', 'molesters', 'masquerading', 'plainclothes', 'police', 'then', 'learn', 'escaped', 'clutches', 'four', 'days', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'hands', 'was', 'obviously', 'deeply', 'scarred', 'mentally', 'film', 'then', 'forward', 'same', 'area', 'present', 'day.The', 'three', 'guys', 'have', 'drifted', 'apart', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'same', 'neighbourhood', 'daughter', 'one', 'three', 'Jimmy', 'Markum', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'am', 'Sam', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'been', 'murdered', 'recently', 'One', 'other', 'three', 'Sean', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Footloose', 'Flatliners', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'investigating', 'police', 'officer', 'remaining', 'member', 'trio', 'Dave', 'played', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Arlington', 'Rd', 'prime', 'suspect', 'case.Mystic', 'River', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'murder', 'mystery', 'tension', 'plot', 'thickens', 'effectively', 'duration', 'film', 'are', 'plenty', 'plot', 'twists', 'red', 'herrings', 'keep', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'ably', 'directed', 'great', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'helm', '24th', 'film', 'film', 'just', 'films', ""n't"", 'try', 'anything', 'flashy', 'groundbreaking', 'helm', 'sensitive', 'competent', 'builds', 'good', 'pace', 'tension', 'long', 'career', 'action', 'based', 'films', 'Eastwood', 'particularly', 'ease', 'directing', 'acting', 'films', 'strong', 'focus', 'characters', 'rather', 'simply', 'action.This', 'primarily', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'story', 'powerful', 'acting', 'three', 'leads', 'supported', 'ably', 'great', 'actors', 'including', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Indeed', 'performances', 'Penn', 'Robbins', 'garnered', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'respectively', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Ben-Hur', '1959', 'two', 'awards', 'have', 'been', 'won', 'same', 'film']",N/A

Years later, Jimmy (Penn) is an ex-con with a loving family, Sean (Bacon) is a cop with marital woes, and Dave (Robbins), forever damaged by his childhood trauma, is barely clinging to reality.  When Jimmy's daughter is murdered, Sean investigates, Jimmy vows vigilante justice, and Dave is a prime suspect.The lead actors are outstanding here.  Penn is utterly convincing as the former thug and grieving father.  Robbins displays his acting chops in the performance of a lifetime, showing a fragile man dealing with such pain that he can no longer function rationally.

Of course we know this is not true. It wasn't true for General Rommel any more so than it was or Sean, Jimmy and Davey when at about the age of 12, Davey is kidnapped by 2 pedophiles off the apartment bordered avenue where the three friends are playing 'street hockey' where they lived in south Boston.There's a remarkable scene at the end of the movie when Sean Devine, a State Police Detective, asks Jimmy Markham if he's seen Davey? Jimmy turns to Sean and says ""I haven't seen Davey for 25 years, since he disappeared in that car.""This is a dark movie from a dark book by Dennis Lehane of the Patrick and Angie series. The book was a painful look at people, for the most part normal people or at least people we are familiar with, traumatized by an event so miniscule that it nearly goes unreported with no room on the agenda of the Rathers and the Brokaws, but sufficient enough to last a lifetime for the three boy-men.In the middle of the movie Sean Penn, who is brilliant, explains how he got together wth the mother of his now murdered daughter, Katie. The mother was apparently well above the social strata of the then 19 year old Jimmy. Penn says, ""I get into that car when we're kids, I'd never have the juice to ask her out.""Clint Eastwood does an extraordinary job just following the book. It is scary and haunting with wounded has beens acting heroic and heroes making awful mistakes. Everyone knows their part, Laurence Fisburne as Kevin Bacon''s Sergeant is excellent, Tim Robbins as the adult Dave Boyle's superior performance nearly won him a best supporting; and Sean Penn is positively the best I've ever seen.The endings remain the same; perhaps there is more to the final scenes in the book as Lehane wrote it, yet Eastwood does a remarkable job in juxtaposing one scene against another.

And no film I've ever seen was less deserving of the awards it won. Aside from an average story and murky Boston location shots, there was little else good to say about this film, whose principal theme was eerily familiar to another bad movie, ""Ghost Story"".The acting, in particular, was poor. Had Marcia Gay Harden not portrayed an interesting, multidimensional character, there'd have been nothing good to say about any of them.Sean Penn played the same role he has played since ""Falcon and the Snowman"" and ""Bad Boys"" -- the brooding, insolent killer with bad judgment -- yet somehow won an Academy Award for this image. This says more about the Motion Picture Academy and its processes than about this film, which is full of bad acting and direction.Sadly, Penn's lack of subtlety was only the beginning of the mess. Tim Robbins, who also won an Academy Award as a pitiful victim, was so miscast as a Boston resident it was laughable. The direction given Robbins, Penn, Lawrence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon -- especially in the use of their Boston accents -- was stilted and resulted in unbelievable characterizations.Boston lifers must have laughed out loud listening to these dimbulbs try to speak Beantownese. No one could be expected to suspend disbelief to that extent!The fault for this overacting, bad langauge and one-dimensional acting belongs to director Clint Eastwood, a Hollywood insider on scale with ""Pretty Woman"" Julie Roberts and California Gov. Arnold ""Terminator"" Schwarzenegger. Had a lesser director or an independent like Spike Lee or John Favreau done this, no Hollywood entity would have rushed forward to reward their effort with awards.It's great to be Clint Eastwood, I guess. He could at least have used his influence to bring a language coach to the set. One of the elements that makes ""The Sopranos"" the best program in television history is its language coaching, especially the on-set coach for star James Gandolfini. Even with that, this film would still have been average but would have been more believable had a coach instructed these dummies in the proper use of Boston English. Hell, they even did that with the Louisiana Cajuns in ""Southern Comfort""!Among the movie's other vagueries was the telephone relationship with Bacon's ex-wife. It put a smile on Bacon's face after two hours but played no role in the film.

819327,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001ZX0OC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 5]","I was fortunate that I went to see &quot;Mystic River&quot; today knowing nothing more than that Sean Penn headed an impressive cast in a film directed by Clint Eastwood.  Consequently, I watched this story unfold without any preconceptions whatsoever and was able to get into the flow of the movie to the point that when Penn's Jimmy Markum declares that he knows that he had a hand in the twists of fate that led to the murder of his 19-year old daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum), I knew that this was a pivotal line in the film and a key to unraveling the mystery.&quot;Mystic River&quot; begins with a past that is prologue.  The only real clue is that Luis Tiant is the Boston Red Sox pitcher under discussion by the guys on the front porch.  Three young boys are interrupted while writing their names in drying cement by evil wearing a false face of authority.  We learn enough of the details to understand how all three boys are scarred, in different ways, and that when circumstances bring them together a couple of decades later, what happened way back when is a material part of their present realities when Jimmy's world is shattered by his daughter's violent murder.Beyond that I am not inclined to get into much more detail regarding the plot.  The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, does a good job of laying out the clues and false leads.  I found that I was just far ahead enough of the dual investigations, one by the cops Jimmy (Kevin Bacon) and Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), the other by local thugs Val (Kevin Chapman) and Nick Savage (Adam Nelson), to know they were getting closer but not putting the pieces together the right way.  However, even though I know that telling such a story in a world where modern forensics turns a pint of blood in the trunk of a car into a mountain of damning evidence, the holes in the story's logic did not prove a distraction and my only serious comment would be that I would have changed the motive of the murder to conform better with Jimmy's self-incriminating epiphany.  The film plays fair with the audience and ultimately it is the characters that captivate us.It is only November but it is not too early to talk about Eastwood and this film getting nominated for Academy Awards.  Sean Penn is almost certainly going to get an Oscar nomination for his performance and I would expect the same for the eerily sedate Tim Robbins, although I suspect it will be in the Supporting Actor category.  But the performances of the entire cast are outstanding and it is easy to believe that these people all grew up in this neighborhood and are indeed feeling the pains that force them to make the life altering decisions they do in the course of this film.  The film's tagline--&quot;We bury out sins, we wash them clean&quot;--is not paraphrased until the climax, but we recognize the truth of that idea long before that point.This is also a film that successfully hints at the depth of the novel, no more so when Jimmy's second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney) delivers what is essentially the films benediction and provides a new perspective on the events that have transpired, putting them rather unexpectedly on a larger level.  As I turn over this film in my mind my final question is whether &quot;Mystic River&quot; is more akin to a Shakespearean tragedy or an ancient Greek tragedy.  Either way, Clint Eastwood has presented a film that tells of tragedy on a grand scale even if it is played out in a small corner of South Boston.",5,"&quot;We bury our sins, we wash them clean...&quot;",1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,3517,"['was', 'fortunate', 'went', 'see', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'today', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'more', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'headed', 'impressive', 'cast', 'film', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Consequently', 'watched', 'story', 'unfold', 'preconceptions', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'flow', 'movie', 'point', 'when', 'Penn', 'Jimmy', 'Markum', 'had', 'hand', 'twists', 'fate', 'led', 'murder', '19-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Katie', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'knew', 'was', 'pivotal', 'line', 'film', 'key', 'unraveling', 'mystery.', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'past', 'prologue', 'only', 'real', 'clue', 'Luis', 'Tiant', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'pitcher', 'discussion', 'guys', 'front', 'porch', 'Three', 'young', 'boys', 'are', 'interrupted', 'writing', 'names', 'drying', 'cement', 'evil', 'wearing', 'false', 'face', 'authority', 'learn', 'enough', 'details', 'understand', 'how', 'three', 'boys', 'are', 'scarred', 'different', 'ways', 'when', 'circumstances', 'bring', 'together', 'couple', 'decades', 'later', 'what', 'happened', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'material', 'part', 'present', 'realities', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'world', 'shattered', 'daughter', 'violent', 'murder.Beyond', 'am', 'not', 'inclined', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'regarding', 'plot', 'script', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'good', 'job', 'laying', 'out', 'clues', 'false', 'leads', 'found', 'was', 'just', 'far', 'ahead', 'enough', 'dual', 'investigations', 'one', 'cops', 'Jimmy', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Whitey', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'other', 'local', 'thugs', 'Val', 'Kevin', 'Chapman', 'Nick', 'Savage', 'Adam', 'Nelson', 'know', 'were', 'getting', 'closer', 'not', 'putting', 'pieces', 'together', 'right', 'way', 'However', 'even', 'know', 'telling', 'story', 'world', 'where', 'modern', 'forensics', 'pint', 'blood', 'trunk', 'car', 'mountain', 'damning', 'evidence', 'holes', 'story', 'logic', 'did', 'not', 'prove', 'distraction', 'only', 'serious', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'motive', 'murder', 'conform', 'better', 'Jimmy', 'self-incriminating', 'epiphany', 'film', 'fair', 'audience', 'ultimately', 'characters', 'captivate', 'us.It', 'only', 'November', 'not', 'too', 'early', 'talk', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'getting', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'almost', 'certainly', 'going', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'would', 'expect', 'same', 'eerily', 'sedate', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'category', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'outstanding', 'easy', 'believe', 'people', 'grew', 'up', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'indeed', 'feeling', 'pains', 'force', 'make', 'life', 'altering', 'decisions', 'do', 'course', 'film', 'film', 'tagline', 'quot', 'bury', 'out', 'sins', 'wash', 'clean', 'quot', 'not', 'paraphrased', 'climax', 'recognize', 'truth', 'idea', 'long', 'point.This', 'also', 'film', 'successfully', 'depth', 'novel', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'second', 'wife', 'Annabeth', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'what', 'essentially', 'films', 'benediction', 'new', 'perspective', 'events', 'have', 'transpired', 'putting', 'rather', 'unexpectedly', 'larger', 'level', 'turn', 'over', 'film', 'mind', 'final', 'question', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'more', 'akin', 'Shakespearean', 'tragedy', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'way', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'presented', 'film', 'tragedy', 'grand', 'scale', 'even', 'played', 'out', 'small', 'corner', 'South', 'Boston']",N/A

That the ending of this film is supposed to condone Jimmy's actions. Jimmy isn't supposed to be a righteous hero. The message isn't that that justice was served. Just the opposite, it's just showing us more pointless, demoralizing misery. Just another punch in the jaw to the audience.This movie is a meaningless, hateful film that's only message seems to be ""life sucks"". Call me kooky, but I don't see movies so that I can feel even worse about humanity and life in general. I knew this movie was going to be heavy subject matter but this is just a gratuitous portrait of misery. I expected something deeper, some kind of sense of spirituality, of humanity. Instead it seems to think misery is all the meaning and reason it needs. But for some bizzare reason it seems to think it's very important. It's so overblown it's ridiculous. The movie is filled with crappy people living crappy lives. If I want to deal with people this nasty and worthless I don't need to go to the movies. No one ever traumatised by anything is going to get anything positive out of the portrayal of Dave. It's skewed disgustingly and is downright irresponsible. The ending is just plain STUPID. When I saw it I couldn't believe that this sloppy lameness was what the mystery had ""unraveled"" as. The acting's decent. Big deal. It takes more than solid acting to impress me, and the acting is overrated anyway. Tim Robins would probably be better off on the stage. There are technical flaws in the way the movie was shot. The sound is HORRIBLE.But what it really comes down to is that there's really nothing positive you can get out of this movie. See it if you want to give up on life. Some would say that the fact that the film moved me enough to make me deeply miserable makes it a ""good"" movie. I say my ass. To just grab the audiences' emotions and abuse them and then let them drop is wrong. There's enough trauma in people's lives without leaving them with an artificial trauma to deal with.

The film's theme is more than the mystery of who committed a horrible crime.  It's about sin and redemption and the effect of a crime in the past on a different crime in the present. My emotions were stirred by the very real human condition which it depicted.The story begins in the past in a working class area of Boston. Three friends are playing hockey one day when, suddenly, one becomes the victim of a horrible crime.  Even though he survives and grows to adulthood, he will always bear its scars as an adult.  This adult role is played by Tim Robbins and his performance is so outstanding that he didn't even seem to be acting.  Sean Penn is cast as his friend who was present that day in the past and remembers what happened.  Now, in the present, his own life is shattered when his 19-year old daughter is brutally murdered.  We all get to feel his grief as he has to identify her body in the morgue.  And we all can identify with his feelings of rage and helplessness.  He's a petty criminal with ties to unsavory characters as well as some secrets of his own from the past and is determined to find the killer himself. He's a good actor and I found myself thinking about his performance during the film.  Perhaps this was because his performance was just a little bit too &quot;over the top&quot;.  Or perhaps the role he was playing and his skill in playing it had to display grief so deep that it was just too difficult to watch.  Kevin Bacon is cast in the role of the third friend with memories of the past crime.  Now he's a cop who has to investigate his friend's daughter's murder.  It's an understated role and calls for him to make some serious decisions about what is right and wrong.The supporting actors were excellent too.  Mary Gay Harden plays Tim Robbins' wife.  She loves her husband but is suspicious when he comes home late one night with a cut on his hand.  Laura Linney is Sean Penn's wife.  She plays a small role until one of the last scenes where she is instrumental in creating closure.  Laurence Fishburne is cast as a cop investigating the crime and sometimes has to push into places where his partner, Kevin Bacon, does not want to go.  His role is instrumental but this particular acting assignment wasn't as challenging as it was for the other cast members.The film held my interest throughout, kept me guessing, and kept picking up velocity. And the conclusion solved the crime but also provided food for thought about some very difficult choices and the human condition.

I even got mad at myself watching this because I thought I was pretty sharp...but....oh well.This film is well crafted and very intricate in the story. I really admire Kevin Bacon's (Footloose, Wil & Grace, Apollo 13, The River Wild) for his performance as the straight lace detective of the group of three boys who grew up with a very common episode that happened in their lives as kids.Sean Penn (I Am Sam, State of Grace, Thin Red Line) give an incredible performance as a father who has a tragedy happen to him and makes choices that affect everyone's life. He is scary in this film.Tim Robbins give a stellar performance the boy with the past who haunts his future and creates a situation that he can not control. He is a nut - with a twist...and the stunning performance by his wife played by -Marcia Gay Harden (Space Cowboys, Flubber) makes you feel even more creepy.Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix 1,2 & 3, Event Horizon) gives a great compliment to being Kevin bacons partner.It is truly a mystery within a mystery.

They all live in a fantasy world where the plot of this movie makes sense and is acceptable.  This movie is one of the crappiest pieces of dog mess that I have ever had the displeasure of watching.Let's forget the overacting for a minute.  No, let's not.  That scene in the beginning Sean Penn crying and being restrained by the cops did not, and I repeat DID NOT qualify as Oscar material.  I laughed at it.  This movie was completely over the top.O, did I mention that I fell asleep the first time?Anyways, I'm not going to say that this had potential b/c to give it potential would be to scrap this entire script.  Nothing in it makes sense.  I am truly fighting the urge to spoil it (well, some reviewers already did). I just want to say this: I thought it was very traitorous how Celeste sold out Dave to Jimmy. ESPECIALLY since she didn't even know for sure if he killed Katie.  And then at the end, she's concerned when he goes missing.  Well duh!  You sold your husband and your son's father out to a known convict.  Also, it sickened me how they set Dave up.  I'm really mad how Jimmy lied to him and made him think that if he said he did it, he'd live.  Dave didn't even die with dignity. Geez. And somehow we're supposed to cheer Jimmy on for ""serving justice.""  He should be locked up and the key to his cell should be thrown in the Mystic!And then at the end when Kevin Bacon finds out that Jimmy offed Dave. Does nothing about it.  We are treated to a phone call by his wife that served no relevance to the movie.  Give me a break.  A man just died and we are served to smiles and happy times by all characters involved in an ending coverup.  Celeste at the end deserved what she got, but not Dave's son (who was on the float upset b/c his dad wasn't there).Unfreakin' believable that Sean Penn kills Dave, goes home and tells his wife, and then she appeases this murderer by saying he did what he had to do and it's ok if he wants to do it again.  And then we are treated to a tasteless shot of her getting ready to satisfy him.

Three young neighborhood boys, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn), Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), and Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins) grow up with a bad memory of a day that changed their lives forever.  As young boys, they played in the streets enjoying carefree time together.  Two strange men, one posing as a policeman force Dave into their car and kidnap him for four long horrific days.This point in time changed their lives forever.Mystic River brings the grown men together with the murder of Jimmy's 19 year old daughter.  Sean has become a cop and had grown apart from Jimmy, who had spent some time in jail for criminal activity.  Laurence Fishburne plays Sean's partner and they are puzzled by the strange and violent murder of Jimmy's daughter. The clues show she was planning on getting married to a neighbor boy that Jimmy cannot stand.  There are secrets to Jimmy's hatred of the boy, and secrets around him and his mute, dependant younger brother.Meanwhile, Dave is living in the neighborhood too, with a young son and lovely wife, but carries the dark memories of his childhood constantly on his shoulders.  He has never been the same since his car ride and imprisonment by two pedophiles for four days.  Slowly, Julie's death is connected to Dave by some odd circumstances, and paranoia starts to run high with Jimmy.  Dave changes his alibi the night of the murder several times, and Jimmy fears he had something to do with it.The movie gradually peels away the layers of hurt, past friendships, family ties and the sad story of lost innocence.Mystic River is deeply moving and powerful.",4,Dark and Powerful,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,1640,"['Mystic', 'River', 'dark', 'powerful', 'tale', 'lives', 'lost', 'Three', 'young', 'neighborhood', 'boys', 'Jimmy', 'Markum', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'grow', 'up', 'bad', 'memory', 'day', 'changed', 'lives', 'forever', 'young', 'boys', 'played', 'streets', 'enjoying', 'carefree', 'time', 'together', 'Two', 'strange', 'men', 'one', 'posing', 'policeman', 'force', 'Dave', 'car', 'kidnap', 'four', 'long', 'horrific', 'days.This', 'point', 'time', 'changed', 'lives', 'forever.Mystic', 'River', 'grown', 'men', 'together', 'murder', 'Jimmy', '19', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Sean', 'become', 'cop', 'had', 'grown', 'apart', 'Jimmy', 'who', 'had', 'spent', 'time', 'jail', 'criminal', 'activity', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Sean', 'partner', 'are', 'puzzled', 'strange', 'violent', 'murder', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'clues', 'show', 'was', 'planning', 'getting', 'married', 'neighbor', 'boy', 'Jimmy', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'are', 'secrets', 'Jimmy', 'hatred', 'boy', 'secrets', 'mute', 'dependant', 'younger', 'brother.Meanwhile', 'Dave', 'living', 'neighborhood', 'too', 'young', 'son', 'lovely', 'wife', 'dark', 'memories', 'childhood', 'constantly', 'shoulders', 'never', 'been', 'same', 'car', 'ride', 'imprisonment', 'two', 'pedophiles', 'four', 'days', 'Slowly', 'Julie', 'death', 'connected', 'Dave', 'odd', 'circumstances', 'paranoia', 'starts', 'run', 'high', 'Jimmy', 'Dave', 'alibi', 'night', 'murder', 'several', 'times', 'Jimmy', 'fears', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'it.The', 'movie', 'gradually', 'away', 'layers', 'hurt', 'past', 'friendships', 'family', 'ties', 'sad', 'story', 'lost', 'innocence.Mystic', 'River', 'deeply', 'moving', 'powerful']",N/A

The story centers around three childhood friends that are reunited 25 years later when the daughter of one is murdered.

Tim Robbins' acting was moving and I thought he was the best part of the movie. Kevin Bacon was also very good as the cop investigating the murder. The supporting cast added little to the movie and the actress that played Sean Penn's wife was irritating to say the least. Even when she wasn't speaking, she was irritating.

819337,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B0001ZX0OC,"Maine Writer ""David""","[2, 5]","Mystic River is an predictable thriller than ends up being saved--actually, more than saved--by bravura performances from almost all of its stars.  The best performance comes from Sean Penn, who seems to be channelling a young Robert DeNiro.  Indeed, if there was a flaw with Penn's performance it is that there may be a bit too much DeNiro in it.  But it would be foolish to complain about that.  The other actors who stand out are Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne (notwithstanding the Matrix Reloaded, the guy can act), and Marcia Gay Harden as a simple, troubled spouse (which is often a hugely difficult kind of role for many actors).  Tim Robbins is close to the top, but doesn't quite pull off the role, relying far too much on a brooding quietness that doesn't always work.I could hardly review the film without pointing out some of its weaknesses.  First, the dialogue is inconsistent, forcing characters to deliver lines that seem far too intelligent or ""on the nose"" for them.  This problem forces you out of the story at times and seems to be a crutch for advancing the story or ""educating"" the audience.  There simply was no need for it.  The story was also predictable, at times seeming spoon-fed.  Finally, there were a number of throwaway subplots that seemed, well, fake.  For example, Kevin Bacon's runaway wife added little and seemed contrived, rather than natural.  Part of it had to do with the manner in which her fleeting appearances were filmed.  She had little or nothing to do with the story, and her role added nothing to Bacon's character warranted distracting from the narrative line.Overall, Mystic River is an intense, involving movie.  Sean Penn may well receive the Oscar he deserves.",3,"Solid acting, not so solid story",1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,1716,"['Mystic', 'River', 'predictable', 'thriller', 'up', 'being', 'saved', 'actually', 'more', 'saved', 'bravura', 'performances', 'almost', 'stars', 'best', 'performance', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'be', 'channelling', 'young', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Indeed', 'was', 'flaw', 'Penn', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'DeNiro', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'complain', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'notwithstanding', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'guy', 'can', 'act', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'simple', 'troubled', 'spouse', 'often', 'hugely', 'difficult', 'kind', 'role', 'many', 'actors', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'close', 'top', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'relying', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'brooding', 'quietness', ""n't"", 'always', 'work.I', 'could', 'hardly', 'review', 'film', 'pointing', 'out', 'weaknesses', 'First', 'dialogue', 'inconsistent', 'forcing', 'characters', 'deliver', 'lines', 'seem', 'far', 'too', 'intelligent', 'nose', 'problem', 'story', 'times', 'be', 'crutch', 'advancing', 'story', 'educating', 'audience', 'simply', 'was', 'need', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'predictable', 'times', 'seeming', 'spoon-fed', 'Finally', 'were', 'number', 'throwaway', 'subplots', 'seemed', 'well', 'fake', 'example', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'runaway', 'wife', 'added', 'little', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'rather', 'natural', 'Part', 'had', 'do', 'manner', 'fleeting', 'appearances', 'were', 'filmed', 'had', 'little', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'role', 'added', 'nothing', 'Bacon', 'character', 'warranted', 'distracting', 'narrative', 'line.Overall', 'Mystic', 'River', 'intense', 'involving', 'movie', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'may', 'well', 'receive', 'Oscar']",N/A

The method he is using is masterful and unique, and you probably have to have some sort of film or theatre background to truly appreciate it. It's called naturalism, and there ain't no bells and whistles in naturalism, folks. That's because you don't need any bells and whistles to communicate a story of such natural narrative force as &quot;Mystic River&quot;.Eastwood does the only thing a truly talented and knowledgable director could do with this forceful story -- he stands back and lets it happen. Those looking to be hit over the head with Spielbergian emoting and Schwarzeneggerian posturing will need to look elsewhere. In other words -- subtlety, not Hollywood explosions/special effects and bombastic acting, is the key in this film.This style of directing worked well in &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and it works doubly-well in &quot;Mystic River&quot;.The only complaint I have with this film (this is the reason I gave it 4, not 5, stars) is the silly &quot;wife who won't talk&quot; moments in the film.

He has done a fine job with several other films as well, but in Mystic River Clint signals a full maturity in his gift as a director.He began with a stellar cast, and I won't waste anyone's time being the ten millionth person to praise Sean Penn's stunning performance.  A cast that breathes life into this sorrowful tale surrounds him.  Tim Robbins returns on-screen in a role that is perhaps the most difficult and complex one of the movie, and he seems believable every moment.  Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne make good cop-partners.  The wives of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are played by Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden, and they are both heart-breakingly good.None of us are perfect, and this is a theme that runs through this story of abuse, suffering and death.  We are perhaps least perfect when we let our passions rule us and we go off half-cocked when things would probably turn out better if we had our emotions and facts straight.  Many things are not quite as they seem.There are many virtuoso sequences in the film as two simultaneous events are juxtaposed upon each other.  Note snippets of visual information we are given in the early sequence that alternates between the first communion of one of Sean Penn's daughters, and the crime scene investigation where the police will eventually discover that the eldest daughter has been murdered.  Note also later on the climactic confrontation between Sean Penn and Tim Robbins on the banks of the Mystic River while at the same time Bacon and Fishburne confront the former boyfriend of the dead daughter.This film leaves you with a little pit in your stomach.  But it does that with consummate skill, and I admire it for that.  I watched the movie first in the theater, then last night on DVD.  I pose this question to viewers:  After the events of the end of the movie, what do you think is the response of the Laurence Fishburne character?",5,Clint Eastwood knows how to make a movie...,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,2068,"['did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'directed', 'Unforgiven', 'good', 'was', 'obviously', 'well', 'steeped', 'legend', 'lore', 'Western', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'well', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Clint', 'full', 'maturity', 'gift', 'director.He', 'began', 'stellar', 'cast', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'anyone', 'time', 'being', 'ten', 'millionth', 'person', 'praise', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'stunning', 'performance', 'cast', 'life', 'sorrowful', 'tale', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'on-screen', 'role', 'perhaps', 'most', 'difficult', 'complex', 'one', 'movie', 'believable', 'moment', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'make', 'good', 'cop-partners', 'wives', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'are', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'are', 'heart-breakingly', 'good.None', 'are', 'perfect', 'theme', 'story', 'abuse', 'suffering', 'death', 'are', 'perhaps', 'least', 'perfect', 'when', 'let', 'passions', 'rule', 'go', 'off', 'half-cocked', 'when', 'things', 'would', 'probably', 'turn', 'out', 'better', 'had', 'emotions', 'facts', 'straight', 'Many', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'are', 'many', 'virtuoso', 'sequences', 'film', 'two', 'simultaneous', 'events', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'other', 'Note', 'snippets', 'visual', 'information', 'are', 'given', 'early', 'sequence', 'first', 'communion', 'one', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'daughters', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigation', 'where', 'police', 'will', 'eventually', 'discover', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'been', 'murdered', 'Note', 'also', 'later', 'climactic', 'confrontation', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'banks', 'Mystic', 'River', 'same', 'time', 'Bacon', 'Fishburne', 'confront', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'dead', 'daughter.This', 'film', 'little', 'pit', 'stomach', 'consummate', 'skill', 'admire', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'theater', 'then', 'last', 'night', 'DVD', 'pose', 'question', 'viewers', 'events', 'end', 'movie', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'response', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'character']",N/A
819344,A30TW9R3R0NODW,B0001ZX0OC,Mark Kittell,"[21, 29]","I found this film mildly gripping until the last act, and then I was sickened. Perhaps I was more sympathetic to Tim Robbins' character's sincere efforts to control his urges than I was to Sean Penn's manic rages, but one need not be conflicted to sense that something is morally and ethically amiss. There is never really any doubt (at least for the audience) of Dave Boyle's innocence of the murder of Jimmy Marcus's daughter, yet Marcus' thuggish character over-rides any such concerns. Marcus coerces a ""confession"" from Boyle after telling him he will let him live, and then once Marcus' pre-conceived notion is thus confirmed, he kills Boyle anyways. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) shows up just in time to tell Marcus that he has killed an innocent man, and Marcus' reaction can be summed as a ""so what.""  The end of the film doesn't ask any gray moral or ethical questions--quite the contrary. Devine and Marcus wave and smile at each other, as if justice was served--the daughter was an innocent, Boyle was innocent, and they're both dead. It all ""evens out"" in some warped way. The pathetic Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) the only person who apparently cared if Boyle lived or died, is left unnoticed and marginalized. The last ten minutes of the film, thus, makes what transpired before filmmaking mendacity.What exactly was the message Clint Eastwood was trying to convey here? The only one that makes sense to me is  Dirty Harry-type vigilantism where colateral damage is a fact of life is acceptible under certain situations.

Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption), Kevin Bacon (Apollo 13), Sean Penn (Dead Man Walking) and Marcia Gay Harden (Miller's Crossing) all appear in other films I really liked, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.Basically I had two big problems with Mystic River. First of all, with the heavy Boston accents, it's quite difficult to comprehend some of the lines. But by far the bigger problem was the ""coincidence"" of two separate acts of malfeasance involving Robbin's and Penn's characters AT THE SAME TIME. Talk about your astronomical odds ! Even if I could buy into this extreme possibility, the reward at the end left me dissatisfied. I don't mind a little tragedy, but in this case it was totally senseless and the other character's reactions were also quite unbelievable. (I'd like to believe that Penn's character and his two slimy mobster friends were all arrested immediately after the parade at the end of the movie !)My advice is to rent this DVD if you're a die hard fan of any of the main characters, as the acting really is good.

819346,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0001ZX0OC,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","I wasn't sure what to expect with MYSTIC RIVER. I know that Clint Eastwood is a highly underrated director. I know that the stars were all part of a generation of actors known for the quality of their work. But something about this movie never made me want to rush to see it. I'm glad that I finally got to it.The film opens with three young friends playing on the street, scraping their names in fresh cement. A police detective gives the kids a hard time for what they are doing and takes the one who doesn't live in the nearby houses home. The truth though is that this is not a policeman and he doesn't take him home. Rather young Dave Boyle is abducted by two pedophiles that he escapes from later.The movie then jumps forward to present day where one of those youngsters now grown, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) owns his own market and watches as his daughter goes out for the night before his other daughters first communion. It is the last time he will see her alive. The next day she is found, murdered.This sets about a chain of events and a reunion of sorts for the boyhood pals. The third member of the three is Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) who is now a detective for the State Police. And the murder falls under his jurisdiction.Young Dave has grown (Tim Robbins) and is still haunted by the experiences of his past. And the night that Jimmy's daughter was murdered Dave saw her and also came home covered in someone else's blood. Putting these items together, Dave's wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) begins to wonder about her husband. He claims to have been mugged and to have beaten the mugger to death. But no newspaper articles make her doubt his story.The main portion of the movie moves across the stories of the individuals involved. Jimmy wants vengeance and will do anything to find and kill the person responsible for his daughter's murder. Dave grapples with the demons of his past. And Sean just wants to believe that his friends can't be involved in the murder as he searches for the real killer.  Each becomes a piece of the puzzle, the answer of which is not revealed until films end. But by then, the world is turned upside down and facts are misplaced.While some might have thought this was a simple murder mystery, a whodunit put together by Eastwood, it is much deeper than that. It is a look into the psyche of three very different people who grew up together, who were affected by their past. The inner struggles of all three are different, but all tied into their past as well. And this makes for a drama unlike any mystery could hold.Perhaps the biggest thing that this film offers is a ton of outstanding performances that will be hard to match in any current film. An assembly of talent such as this is rare in today's films. Most notable is Sean Penn as the father in turmoil. All accolades he received were well deserved.Make a point of renting this one. You won't be disappointed. And the discovery of just who the killer is, whether it is Dave or perhaps Jimmy's daughter's boyfriend or someone else, makes for a fitting together of clues that mold well.

It is also an actor's dream. Containing at least a half dozen excellent roles, it provided Sean Penn a Best Actor Oscar, as well as one for Tim Robbins as Best Supporting Actor.`Riveting' is a good word to describe the story. At the start, three boyhood friends are playing games on the sidewalks of a working-class Boston neighborhood. Two men, allegedly cops, abduct one of the boys. He is found a few days later in a cellar. He has been sexually molested and, naturally, is traumatized. The movie implies that no one knows how to deal with what has happened to the boy. It's a working-class, Catholic neighborhood. Life just goes on.Flash forward about thirty years later to the present. Each boy's life has taken a different path. Jimmy [Sean Penn] has become the operator of a successful neighborhood grocery store - but only after a stretch in prison for armed robbery. He still hangs out with the local thugs. Sean [Kevin Bacon] has become a detective with the Boston police department. His professional life is fine but his personal life is a shambles. Dave [Tim Robbins], the one who was kidnapped, lives life as best he can. When Jimmy's teenage daughter is brutally murdered, the three boyhood friends reunite on a chaotic collision course which leads to tragedy.This is not a movie for people with short attention spans.

819351,AFJCOP0GKZH6C,B0001ZX0OC,M. B. Trapp,"[4, 5]","Eastwood's latest is a fantastic drama with a terrible ending. I'm not sure I've seen a movie in five years that made me as mad as this one. Eastwood mixes a plotline that explores the complexity of human emotions and human relationships with some outstanding performances by Penn, Robbins, and Bacon. Perhaps the most potent aspect of the movie is its portrayal of the devastation caused by sexual abuse.As the climax of the film unfolded, I understood that I was watching a tragedy that had been earlier masked as a crime mystery. For a transient moment I thought the film was going to turn into a classical tragedy, complete with the downfall of the tragic hero due to his inherent character flaw. But there is no payoff. The tragic character is Penn's, and just when we expect him to receive the terrible rewards of the havoc his flaw hath wrought, we are treated to scenes of moral mish-mash and the seeming triumph of the tragic hero - not over his failure - but over any moral system which would brand his actions wrong. Eastwood gives the viewer just a phantom's hope that there will be some moral resolution to the conflict, but no more.

819352,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0001ZX0OC,M. Burns,"[3, 6]","Don't ask me why, but there are some movies that work better on the small screen than the large one. To my wonderful surprise, watching Mystic River last night, I discovered that Clint Eastwood's gorgeous, mournful drama/mystery is one of them. There's something about the downsized visuals of the movie combined with the intimacy of home viewing that just makes the movie click even more. And if you have seen it in theaters, I urge you to give it another viewing, for the ensemble acting of the movie is - no question - the finest of the year. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, and Kevin Bacon all form unforgettable characters that truly feel real - just pay close attention to gestures; Linney lighting a cigarette and beckoning the cops inside, the icy torrent of fear that runs through Gay-Harden's body language, and the rigid but broken body and soul of Penn (who now, more than ever, shows that he deserved the Oscar over Bill Murray).And River actually moves faster than I remembered, mostly thanks to the film's first hour which still is difficult to watch in its unflinching look at tragedy and grief. The whole scene where Penn discovers his daughter's body is a masterpiece of timing and camerawork: when it finally hits him, the omnipotent lens pulls back into the heavens, letting Penn's grief echo as Eastwood's score swells. My favorite shot of the film is a pull-away from the scene of the crime into the Boston sky that floods the screen with white light. In fact, throughout the entire film (especially in its explosive final act) there is so much craft in the direction and acting that it's easy to overlook the film's flaws. Helgeland's screenplay becomes showy occasionally, while Laurence Fishbourne's cop is just annoying and could have been written (and, sorry Larry, acted) better. But even Psycho has a few things I'd rather overlook, and that's why Mystic River, a standard by which other movies will be judged in the future, deserves nothing less than a GRADE: A",5,"A haunting, elegiac film that is more effective on DVD...",1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,2016,"['Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'are', 'movies', 'work', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'large', 'one', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'watching', 'Mystic', 'River', 'last', 'night', 'discovered', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'gorgeous', 'mournful', 'drama/mystery', 'one', 'something', 'downsized', 'visuals', 'movie', 'combined', 'intimacy', 'home', 'viewing', 'just', 'movie', 'click', 'even', 'more', 'have', 'seen', 'theaters', 'urge', 'give', 'viewing', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'movie', 'question', 'finest', 'year', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'form', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'truly', 'feel', 'real', 'just', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'gestures', 'Linney', 'lighting', 'cigarette', 'beckoning', 'cops', 'icy', 'torrent', 'fear', 'Gay-Harden', 'body', 'language', 'rigid', 'broken', 'body', 'soul', 'Penn', 'who', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Bill', 'Murray', '.And', 'River', 'actually', 'faster', 'remembered', 'mostly', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'still', 'difficult', 'watch', 'unflinching', 'look', 'tragedy', 'grief', 'whole', 'scene', 'where', 'Penn', 'daughter', 'body', 'masterpiece', 'timing', 'camerawork', 'when', 'finally', 'omnipotent', 'back', 'heavens', 'letting', 'Penn', 'grief', 'echo', 'Eastwood', 'score', 'swells', 'favorite', 'shot', 'film', 'pull-away', 'scene', 'crime', 'Boston', 'sky', 'screen', 'white', 'light', 'fact', 'entire', 'film', 'especially', 'explosive', 'final', 'act', 'so', 'much', 'craft', 'direction', 'acting', 'easy', 'overlook', 'film', 'flaws', 'Helgeland', 'screenplay', 'showy', 'occasionally', 'Laurence', 'Fishbourne', 'cop', 'just', 'annoying', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'sorry', 'Larry', 'acted', 'better', 'even', 'Psycho', 'few', 'things', ""'d"", 'rather', 'overlook', 'why', 'Mystic', 'River', 'standard', 'other', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'future', 'nothing', 'less', 'GRADE']",N/A

Clint Eastwood is to be commended for his superb direction, getting remarkable performances from his outstanding cast.  Those who didn't like this movie probably aren't the kind who like a slower moving film, and one that can ultimately only end tragically, with no resolutions firmly established.  I found it to be a moving, disturbing film, one that would have won more Oscars had it not been up against the Lord of the Rings Return of the King.  Apples and oranges...those two films are so different it's hard to compare their excellences.  While The Return of the King is a fantastic film, MYSTIC RIVER is equally impressive but for different reasons.Sean Penn, Cinema's ultimate bad boy, brings a depth to the character of Jimmy Markham that I would not have imagined.  Overacting?  How can a parent not over-react to the terrible tragedy of losing his oldest daughter.  Penn shows the inner torment, the guilt of having spent time in prison and losing his wife, and trying to discover his daughter.  A man who is a devout Catholic, ironically has chosen a life of crime to support his family.  Penn devastates with his performance and deserved his Oscar, hands down.Tim Robbins as Dave is likewise brilliant and he too deserved his supporting Oscar.  His scene with his wife in discussing vampirism and how he likens it to his life is chilling.  ""Sometimes it gets in you, and you can't get rid of it.""  The devastating effects of his childhood abduction have shaped his life, and shamed him enough that he won't tell the truth about where he was on the night of Katie's murder.Kevin Bacon, one of our most underappreciated actors, shines in his role as Sean, the third of the boyhood friends, who as a homicide detective has to confront old pains in finding out who killed Penn's daughter.  His own failed marriage is exemplified in the telephone conversations with his wife who won't even talk to him.  Bacon deserved a nomination, but his role isn't quite as showy as the other two.Oscar winner and nominee Marcia Gay Harden is heartbreaking as Robbins' wife who finds herself confused at her husband's behavior and the blood on his body the night of Katie's murder.  Her ultimate fear and confession to Penn leads to tragedy.  Harden's scene where she waves frantically to her young son in the final parade scene is heartbreaking.Laura Linney, one of our finest actresses, shines in the role of Annabeth, Jimmy's supportive and ambitious wife.  She deserved a nomination but again since her role wasn't too flashy and she didn't have a lot of screen time, she was overlooked.  But feast in Linney's talent in the scene where she tells Jimmy he could be king and rule their world.  Her own agenda and ambition are coldly captured, and Linney is superb in conveying that.Also excellent in smaller roles are Thomas Guiry as Brandon, the boyfriend of Katie, who was going to run off with her to Las Vegas, and Laurence Fishburne as Bacon's cynical hardboiled partner.The entire cast is perfect, and the movie packs an emotional wallop rarely captured in today's youth-oriented cinema.MYSTIC RIVER is a cinematic experience of immeasurable power, and does justice to a most exceptional novel.

Completely character driven and full of tension, drama and danger, &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a cinematic experience that shouldn't be passed up.  For those 130+ minutes, I was intrigued and amazed.  It's a film that doesn't rely on action or senseless non-stop violence, but it relies only on the characters.Jimmy, Dave and Sean were best friends when they were kids, but something terrible happened.  Dave was abducted by two strangers posing as cops one day, only to be held captive and abused (physically, and by &quot;other&quot; means).  He did manage to escape, but the experience has forever scarred him.  Years later when all three are grown up, they are reunited when a horrible crime arises--Jimmy's nineteen-year-old daughter ends up murdered.  Sean's a cop who is on the case and Dave, still deeply disturbed by the past, is acting very strange and suspiciously.  The childhood past that these three had has paved the paths of their lives today, which has set in motion these chain-of-events.  It is a sad story that can only end in tragedy that will affect all three in unimaginable ways.On the surface, this seems like a mystery/thriller when it is anything but that.  True, it is a murder mystery, but the murder is not what the movie is really about.  It's about how the past can never be forgotten and how these three individuals have turned out as a result.  You see the characters and how they deal with the tragedy that has befallen them.  The mind frame, the course of action, and the need of closure all play a very important role in this tension-filled drama.  It's one of those rare films where you could've watched it unfold forever.  Clint Eastwood has done a marvelous job of directing this masterpiece of human tragedy and loss.It has to be said.  The cast is PHENOMENAL.  The cast could've really made this film a complete and utter failure if the wrong people were chosen, but that is not the case here.  Everybody was outstanding.  Sean Penn and Tim Robbins give it their all in making their roles come to life.  I now know why the two won Academy Awards, and they deserve them very much.  Kevin Bacon is terrific and comes off more than just a simple cop.  Laurence Fishburne was a complete joy to watch, as well.  I didn't even know that he was in this until I bought the DVD, and he was brilliant in a stand-out role.  What it all comes down to is that the complete cast is terrific.  Not one wasted talent can be found in this entire film.There are two versions of this movie you can buy--not counting the widescreen/full screen versions.  You can either buy the &quot;bare bones&quot; version that has absolutely no special features whatsoever, or you can buy the &quot;Deluxe Edition,&quot; which is three discs.  I bought the &quot;Deluxe Edition.&quot;  While it is a pretty nice package, I wouldn't really call this edition of the movie &quot;Deluxe.&quot;  Special features included are two making-of featurettes, Charlie Rose interviews with Eastwood, Robbins and Bacon (all separate interviews), two trailers and audio commentary given by Robbins and Bacon.  The third disc is a CD that is the soundtrack to the movie with the score composed by Clint Eastwood.  Like I said, nice package, but nothing really &quot;Deluxe&quot; about it.  It's up to you whether you want to get a version that has no extras in sight or pay a little more for a couple of nice features.&quot;Mystic River&quot; is an unforgettable, heart-breaking and overwhelming film that really can show you how fantastic a movie can be if you have the characters and the emotion.  Not everyone will enjoy it, as it isn't action-packed, but for those who love character development are in for a real treat.  If you haven't seen it yet, I really recommend checking it out.  It's definitely one of the better movies to come out of 2003.  It's a shame it had to come out the same year as &quot;Return of the King,&quot; otherwise I really think this film could've won a few more awards. -Michael Crane",5,"&quot;Sometimes, I think all three of us got in that car...&quot;",1086739200,"06 9, 2004",2004,4093,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'directed', 'masterpiece', 'most', 'likely', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'Completely', 'character', 'driven', 'full', 'tension', 'drama', 'danger', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'passed', 'up', '130+', 'minutes', 'was', 'intrigued', 'amazed', 'film', ""n't"", 'rely', 'action', 'senseless', 'non-stop', 'violence', 'only', 'characters.Jimmy', 'Dave', 'Sean', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'something', 'terrible', 'happened', 'Dave', 'was', 'abducted', 'two', 'strangers', 'posing', 'cops', 'one', 'day', 'only', 'be', 'held', 'captive', 'abused', 'physically', 'quot', 'other', 'quot', 'did', 'manage', 'escape', 'experience', 'forever', 'scarred', 'Years', 'later', 'when', 'three', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'are', 'reunited', 'when', 'horrible', 'crime', 'arises', 'Jimmy', 'nineteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'up', 'murdered', 'Sean', 'cop', 'who', 'case', 'Dave', 'still', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'past', 'acting', 'very', 'strange', 'suspiciously', 'childhood', 'three', 'had', 'paved', 'paths', 'lives', 'today', 'set', 'motion', 'chain-of-events', 'sad', 'story', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'tragedy', 'will', 'affect', 'three', 'unimaginable', 'ways.On', 'surface', 'mystery/thriller', 'when', 'anything', 'True', 'murder', 'mystery', 'murder', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'how', 'past', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'how', 'three', 'individuals', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'result', 'see', 'characters', 'how', 'deal', 'tragedy', 'befallen', 'mind', 'frame', 'course', 'action', 'need', 'closure', 'play', 'very', 'important', 'role', 'tension-filled', 'drama', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'could', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'unfold', 'forever', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'done', 'marvelous', 'job', 'directing', 'masterpiece', 'human', 'tragedy', 'loss.It', 'be', 'said', 'cast', 'PHENOMENAL', 'cast', 'could', ""'ve"", 'really', 'made', 'film', 'complete', 'utter', 'failure', 'wrong', 'people', 'were', 'chosen', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Everybody', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'give', 'making', 'roles', 'come', 'life', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'two', 'won', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'deserve', 'very', 'much', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'terrific', 'off', 'more', 'just', 'simple', 'cop', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'was', 'complete', 'joy', 'watch', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'brilliant', 'stand-out', 'role', 'What', 'down', 'complete', 'cast', 'terrific', 'Not', 'one', 'wasted', 'talent', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'entire', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'can', 'buy', 'not', 'counting', 'widescreen/full', 'screen', 'versions', 'can', 'either', 'buy', 'quot', 'bare', 'bones', 'quot', 'version', 'absolutely', 'special', 'features', 'whatsoever', 'can', 'buy', 'quot', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'quot', 'three', 'discs', 'bought', 'quot', 'Deluxe', 'Edition.', 'quot', 'pretty', 'nice', 'package', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'edition', 'movie', 'quot', 'Deluxe.', 'quot', 'Special', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'two', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'interviews', 'Eastwood', 'Robbins', 'Bacon', 'separate', 'interviews', 'two', 'trailers', 'audio', 'commentary', 'given', 'Robbins', 'Bacon', 'third', 'disc', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'score', 'composed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'said', 'nice', 'package', 'nothing', 'really', 'quot', 'Deluxe', 'quot', 'up', 'want', 'get', 'version', 'extras', 'sight', 'pay', 'little', 'more', 'couple', 'nice', 'features.', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'unforgettable', 'heart-breaking', 'overwhelming', 'film', 'really', 'can', 'show', 'how', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'have', 'characters', 'emotion', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', ""n't"", 'action-packed', 'who', 'love', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'really', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'come', '2003', 'shame', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'quot', 'Return', 'King', 'quot', 'otherwise', 'really', 'think', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'won', 'few', 'more', 'awards', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A
819362,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B0001ZX0OC,Michael J. Mazza,"[1, 9]","&quot;Mystic River,&quot; directed by Clint Eastwood, is a powerful drama set in Boston.  The film stars Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon as three men who were childhood friends.  Their lives and relationships with each other are impacted when a killing occurs.  The film follows the quest to uncover the truth behind the crime.A shocking prologue sequence establishes the tone for a dark psychological crime story with plenty of twists and intriguing clues.  The ensemble is truly a dream cast, and also features Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney as the wives of Robbins' and Penn's characters, and Laurence Fishburne as the partner to Bacon's police detective.  Every one of these fine artists is at the top of his or her form; these portrayals alone make the film worth seeing.  Harden and Robbins are particularly haunting as a troubled couple.  Bacon brings a world-weary gravitas to his character, and has strong chemistry with the compelling Fishburne.  And Penn is superb in his rich, multifaceted role.The film has a raw, gritty feel--at times it's almost like a documentary.  The setting is integral to the story; Eastwood takes you into the homes, bars, and other places that these characters inhabit and really makes you feel like a fly on the wall.  Ultimately, I found the film's vision extremely bleak.  In a way it reminded me of the film &quot;In the Bedroom,&quot; another crime drama with an amazing ensemble cast that left me thinking, &quot;Superb performances and direction, but what was the point?&quot;  Still, it's a powerful tale of death, guilt, secrecy, and the quest for justice.",4,"A dark, gripping drama",1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,1616,"['quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'powerful', 'drama', 'set', 'Boston', 'film', 'stars', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'childhood', 'friends', 'lives', 'relationships', 'other', 'are', 'impacted', 'when', 'killing', 'occurs', 'film', 'quest', 'uncover', 'truth', 'crime.A', 'shocking', 'prologue', 'sequence', 'tone', 'dark', 'psychological', 'crime', 'story', 'plenty', 'twists', 'intriguing', 'clues', 'ensemble', 'truly', 'dream', 'cast', 'also', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'wives', 'Robbins', 'Penn', 'characters', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'partner', 'Bacon', 'police', 'detective', 'one', 'fine', 'artists', 'top', 'form', 'portrayals', 'alone', 'make', 'film', 'seeing', 'Harden', 'Robbins', 'are', 'particularly', 'haunting', 'troubled', 'couple', 'Bacon', 'world-weary', 'gravitas', 'character', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'compelling', 'Fishburne', 'Penn', 'superb', 'rich', 'multifaceted', 'role.The', 'film', 'raw', 'gritty', 'feel', 'times', 'almost', 'documentary', 'setting', 'integral', 'story', 'Eastwood', 'homes', 'bars', 'other', 'places', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'really', 'feel', 'fly', 'wall', 'Ultimately', 'found', 'film', 'vision', 'extremely', 'bleak', 'way', 'reminded', 'film', 'quot', 'Bedroom', 'quot', 'crime', 'drama', 'amazing', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'left', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Superb', 'performances', 'direction', 'was', 'point', 'quot', 'Still', 'powerful', 'tale', 'death', 'guilt', 'secrecy', 'quest', 'justice']",N/A

I still find the ending hateful, but I've come to realize that's the movie's whole point. ""Mystic River"" depicts lives blighted by tragedy, and it's honest enough to carry its tragedy through to the bitter, unresolved end, offering its characters and the audience no solace. Eastwood and screenwriter Brian Helgeland, adapting Dennis Lehane's novel, know how sin--particularly sins of violence--can come home to roost in insular communities; they also know how tragedy and hard living can warp your moral perspective, so that your attempts to avenge injustice may instead only perpetuate and compound it. Meanwhile, Eastwood's direction is lovingly detailed, Helgeland's dialogue is spot-on, and the ensemble cast is nothing short of brilliant--in the cases of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, Oscar-worthy. ""Mystic River"" is hard to watch in places, and its ending is as painful as a bullet in the gut.

They grew up together in the blue collar neighborhood of East Buckingham in Boston. One day Dave got into a stranger's car and didn't return for four days, and that event would prove to change the course of his life from that point onward. 25 years later, Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a shop owner,  a reformed ex-con, and a family man. Dave (Tim Robbins) is married and has a son himself. And Sean (Kevin Bacon), who left the old neighborhood to become a cop, is now homicide detective. When Jimmy's teenaged daughter is found murdered and Sean is assigned to the case, the lives of these three childhood friends become intertwined once again. And the past proves not to be so distant after all.""Mystic River"" was adapted by Brian Helgeland from the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. The film was directed by Clint Eastwood. This is a character study and a Greek tragedy masquerading as a murder mystery. Unfortunately, it's also a melodrama. The cast is all very talented, and the performances are competent, but the characters are overwrought to say the least. Even Sean, the least histrionic of the three men, manages a bit of exaggeration. The most impressive performances come from Marcia Gay Harden as Dave's wife Celeste and Laura Linney as Jimmy's wife Annabeth. Annabeth's startling speech and Celeste's behavior in the last minutes of the film do more than anything else to bring home the story's major ideas. But too many idiosyncratic characters and behaviors make ""Mystic River"" seem contrived and pretentious. And too much melodrama makes it insipid. So, in spite of this talented cast, I have to say that the film has the most success with its murder mystery. The murder is mysterious; the detective work is interesting; there is real suspense; and when we finally understand what has happened, it is truly affecting. I haven't read the novel on which ""Mystic River"" is based, so I don't know if the mystery or the character studies are its focus. But in the film, the mystery serves as a vehicle for gritty melodrama. And the vehicle proves better than its objective.Critics swoon whenever an actor demonstrates competence at any craft other than acting. Consequentially, ""Mystic River"" has been somewhat overrated because Clint Eastwood directed it. Eastwood did a good job, but the film isn't earth-shattering. Sean Penn's performance has been widely praised, but this isn't even close to being Penn's best work. ""Mystic River"" has a lot to recommend it: A talented cast, a good mystery, excellent supporting performances. But be prepared for manipulative and overwrought characterizations.

As time passes the three friends drift apart, but are unexpectedly reunited after Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum)is murdered. Sean is now a police detective and is assigned to head the investigation along with his partner Whitey Powers ( Laurence Fishburne). The main suspect in the murder is Jimmy and Shawn's friend Dave, because he came home the night of the murder covered in blood spinning a half baked story about being attacked by mugger. However, as the film progresses, the question of Dave's guilt comes more and more into question. Now it is up to Shawn to find the murderer and to keep Jimmy from gaining revenge for his daughter's death.In my opinion, Mystic River is the best film of 2003. I was literally blown away at how good this film turned out to be. Clint Eastwood shows once again that he is an amazing director. Mystic River is definately his best film since Unforgiven. The reason Mystic River is so great, is because the mystery of the killer is extremely well done. Tim Robbins did an excellent job as Dave and deserved his academy award for best supporting actor. His actions throughout the film are extremely questionable, but you are never quite sure if he is the killer. When the killer is finally revealed, it will shock you. Sean Penn gave one of the best performances I have seen in a while. His character Jimmy is a hardened ex-con who is attempting to lead an honest life. But the murder of his daughter pushes him towards his old lifestyle. Penn's performance was filled with emotion and intensity. The scene where he learns about his daughter's death will blow you away. Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney are all great in their roles as well.Mystic River is a well thought out and emotional murder mystery. The entire cast is phenomenal, and the ending is extremely satisfying. It is a shame that Mystic River did not beat Return of the King for best picture, because even though Return of the King was a good movie, I personally thought that Mystic River was a better film.A solid 5 stars...",5,Moving and Powerful film!!,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,2239,"['Mystic', 'River', 'film', 'set', 'Boston', 'story', 'three', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Jimmy', 'Marcus', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'time', 'three', 'friends', 'drift', 'apart', 'are', 'unexpectedly', 'reunited', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'Katie', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'murdered', 'Sean', 'now', 'police', 'detective', 'assigned', 'head', 'investigation', 'partner', 'Whitey', 'Powers', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'main', 'suspect', 'murder', 'Jimmy', 'Shawn', 'friend', 'Dave', 'came', 'home', 'night', 'murder', 'covered', 'blood', 'spinning', 'half', 'baked', 'story', 'being', 'attacked', 'mugger', 'However', 'film', 'question', 'Dave', 'guilt', 'more', 'more', 'question', 'Now', 'Shawn', 'find', 'murderer', 'keep', 'Jimmy', 'gaining', 'revenge', 'daughter', 'death.In', 'opinion', 'Mystic', 'River', 'best', 'film', '2003', 'was', 'literally', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'once', 'again', 'amazing', 'director', 'Mystic', 'River', 'definately', 'best', 'film', 'Unforgiven', 'reason', 'Mystic', 'River', 'so', 'great', 'mystery', 'killer', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Dave', 'deserved', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'actions', 'film', 'are', 'extremely', 'questionable', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'killer', 'When', 'killer', 'finally', 'revealed', 'will', 'shock', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'character', 'Jimmy', 'hardened', 'ex-con', 'who', 'attempting', 'lead', 'honest', 'life', 'murder', 'daughter', 'towards', 'old', 'lifestyle', 'Penn', 'performance', 'was', 'filled', 'emotion', 'intensity', 'scene', 'where', 'daughter', 'death', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'great', 'roles', 'well.Mystic', 'River', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'emotional', 'murder', 'mystery', 'entire', 'cast', 'phenomenal', 'ending', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'shame', 'Mystic', 'River', 'did', 'not', 'beat', 'Return', 'King', 'best', 'picture', 'even', 'Return', 'King', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'personally', 'thought', 'Mystic', 'River', 'was', 'better', 'film.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",N/A

A powerful film that uses textured, mature acting and a story that cuts at its characters as its probes its own plot. Director Clint Eastwood is may bot be the most flashiest filmmaker out there, but his style feels as if it has evolved with experience and trial and error. Each shot looks and feels as if it has been set up by a skilled master of the game, and one who knows how to handle the story of &quot;Mystic River,&quot; adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane.Three friends from urban Boston (a dynamic acting trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon) share a history. One that involves kidnapping and sexual abuse. As adults they have drifted apart, but when Jimmy's (Penn) daughter is discovered murdered, they come back together again as Sean (Bacon) is the cop assigned to the case Dave (Robbins) slowly becomes the prime suspect. Surprisingly, there is a lot of ground to cover, detailing Jimmys' chekered past as well as Dave dealing with his own wicked experience as a boy. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland (L.A.Confidential) does so with a clarity and even-handedness that proves invaluable. No major plot detail goes without being explained, and in a way that doesn't distract from the main murder mystery.Eastwoods' supporting cast is equally stellar as the three leads. Marcia Gay Harden is haunting as Dave's wife, exuding subtle terror and fear that preludes the film's tragic two-pronged climax. Laura Linney has but a small part as Jimmey's wife but she makes an impact in the parade scene that ends the movie. The one real surprise of the film is Laurence Fishburne. For all of us who thought he was the walking dead in the ill-advised &quot;Matrix&quot; sequels, here he is a sly, humorous partner for Bacon, as well as being a great foil for the star in the scenes they share. Eastwood, however, makes the film. His style, though workmanlike, is masterful. He knows how to use the actors at his disposal and when he is at his best, he knows how to make a story deeply emotionally resonant, especially here with Helgeland's shrewd script. &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a film that you may not see often anymore, but it's one to be remembered.",5,"Astute, Chilling Adult Drama",1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,2241,"['quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'kind', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'anymore', 'powerful', 'film', 'textured', 'mature', 'acting', 'story', 'characters', 'probes', 'own', 'plot', 'Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'may', 'bot', 'be', 'most', 'flashiest', 'filmmaker', 'there', 'style', 'feels', 'evolved', 'experience', 'trial', 'error', 'shot', 'feels', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'skilled', 'master', 'game', 'one', 'who', 'how', 'handle', 'story', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Dennis', 'Lehane.Three', 'friends', 'urban', 'Boston', 'dynamic', 'acting', 'trio', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'share', 'history', 'One', 'kidnapping', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'adults', 'have', 'drifted', 'apart', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'Penn', 'daughter', 'discovered', 'murdered', 'come', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'Sean', 'Bacon', 'cop', 'assigned', 'case', 'Dave', 'Robbins', 'slowly', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Surprisingly', 'lot', 'ground', 'cover', 'detailing', 'Jimmys', 'chekered', 'as', 'well', 'Dave', 'dealing', 'own', 'wicked', 'experience', 'boy', 'Screenwriter', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'L.A.Confidential', 'so', 'clarity', 'even-handedness', 'invaluable', 'major', 'plot', 'detail', 'being', 'explained', 'way', ""n't"", 'distract', 'main', 'murder', 'mystery.Eastwoods', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'stellar', 'three', 'leads', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'haunting', 'Dave', 'wife', 'exuding', 'subtle', 'terror', 'fear', 'film', 'tragic', 'two-pronged', 'climax', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'small', 'part', 'Jimmey', 'wife', 'impact', 'parade', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'real', 'surprise', 'film', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'walking', 'dead', 'ill-advised', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'sequels', 'here', 'sly', 'humorous', 'partner', 'Bacon', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'great', 'foil', 'star', 'scenes', 'share', 'Eastwood', 'however', 'film', 'style', 'workmanlike', 'masterful', 'how', 'use', 'actors', 'disposal', 'when', 'best', 'how', 'make', 'story', 'deeply', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'especially', 'here', 'Helgeland', 'shrewd', 'script', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'often', 'anymore', 'one', 'be', 'remembered']",N/A

Tim Robbins won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Both actors were astonishing. Marcia Gay Harden was also superb as Robbins wife torn between what she hopes and what she believes. Her facial expressions alone made for a brilliant performance. Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, and Laura Linney all round out the cast providing note worthy support.

The performances are nothing short of superb, with Penn and Robbins both earning their Oscars, and Marcia Gay Harden (as Dave's wife) earning her Oscar nod.

I have tendencies to want to go back and watch it for reasons i can't explain, the atmosphere, etc.  every once in a while, butreally i'm not sure what the movie takes itself so darn seriously for.sean penn ends up playing ironically a temperamental jerk in this role, eventually.not a bad movie.  i'm just not sure what it was trying to say or if it was just supposed to beself-righteous and 'admirable'.",4,annnnnnnnd i'm BACKKKKK !

819386,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B0001ZX0OC,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[52, 71]","Directed by double Academy Award winner Clint Eastwood (Best Director and Best Picture, ""Unforgiven"" (1992)) from a screenplay by Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential""), based on a bestseller by ace mystery writer Dennis Lehane, and starring such respected, actorly heavyweights as Sean Penn (""I Am Sam""), Tim Robbins (""Mission to Mars""), Kevin Bacon (""Flatliners""), Laurence Fishburne (The ""Matrix"" films), Marcia Gay Harden (""Meet Joe Black""), and Laura Linney (""The Mothman Prophecies""), ""Mystic River"" has as unimpeachable a pedigree as any American studio film in history. And though it may not quite be the masterpiece that the early buzz suggests, it certainly makes the most of the tremendous talents at its disposal. A mournful meditation on revenge and guilt, ""Mystic River"" is perhaps Eastwood's most mature and moving examination yet of what has always been his great subject: the peculiarly American juxtaposition of vigilante violence and official justice.The film flows from two linked moments of violence, which, in turn, beget other violence -- one moment that pulls three childhood friends apart and another, 30 years later, that brings them back together. ""Mystic River"" opens in the '70s (the period established by a transistor radio broadcasting a Red Sox game with Luis Tirant on the mound), in a working-class neighborhood, as three boys play street hockey. There's Dave, who seems a little slow, Jimmy, a reckless kid who wants to steal a neighborhood car for joyriding, and Sean, a cautious kid who frowns on Jimmy's plan. Finding a slab of sidewalk where the concrete is still wet, the boys begin writing their names only to be confronted by two older men posing as cops, who take Dave away in the back of their car, where he is kept for several days and sexually abused before escaping. Flashing forward to the same neighborhood decades later, Dave (Robbins) is an introverted husband and father who doesn't seem to have quite recovered from his childhood ordeal. Jimmy (Penn) is an ex-con who runs a corner grocery store in the neighborhood but is still crime-connected. And Sean (Bacon) is now a Boston homicide detective, an outsider in the old neighborhood, working his beat with an astute African-American partner named Whitey (Fishburne). Jimmy and Dave are still friends -- Jimmy's ice-queen wife Annabeth (Linney) is a cousin of Dave's warm but (understandibly) skittish wife Celeste (Harden) -- but all three friends are brought together when Jimmy's 19 year-old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) turns up missing, and later dead, on the same night that Dave returns home late covered in someone else's blood. A distraught Jimmy, not waiting for the legal system to work, has a couple of his neighborhood goons out looking for the killer, while Sean is assigned to work the case. (The parallel police and underworld investigations might be a nod to Fritz Lang's serial-killer masterpiece 'M', which would only be a beginning to the debt ""Mystic River"" owes to Lang's artful police procedurals.) As Sean and Whitey investigate the case, dual clues point strongly to two suspects: Dave, one of the last people to see Katie alive, and a neighborhood boy whom she had been dating.By acclimation, ""Mystic River"" is Clint Eastwood's finest film since 1992's Oscar-winner ""Unforgiven"", and you'll find no argument here. A handsome, old-fashioned film, it's so stately, so measured, and so elegant that it acts as a formal rebuke to most other contemporary studio takes on this kind of material. ""Mystic River"" is a mystery spiked with deep emotion and considerable gravitas. It has a tremendous feel for its location, for this almost tribal old-school neighborhood on the brink of gentrification. It's marked by a tight vocabulary of formal elements -- sure crosscutting and sweeping pans over the film's title waterway. Most of all, it seems intentionally driven by a vast series of doubles and rhymes: two wives, two mute witnesses, two murders, two investigations, two friends whose lives go in opposite directions, two heartbreaking shots -- 30 years apart -- of Dave in the backseat of a car being taken away. And this matches the film's series of actorly one-on-one confrontations: Dave and Celeste, Dave and Jimmy, Celeste and Jimmy, Jimmy and Sean, Jimmy and Annabeth. But Eastwood's precise, conservative direction makes room for occasional visual flourishes, such as the operatic matching aerial shots that show Katie's bloodied, beaten body, found in a park, and nearby Jimmy howling as he's held back by a phalanx of cops.As one might expect, ""Mystic River"" is as much an actor's film as it is a director's. Its performances are uniformly excellent, with Sean Penn's and Tim Robbins' showy turns perhaps bested by Marcia Gay Harden, whose doting but doubtful wife is perhaps the film's most tragic figure. ""Mystic River"" isn't perfect. Laura Linney's underwritten part makes Annabeth's sinister, ruthless late transformation seem awkward and abrupt, and sometimes Eastwood reaches a little too much for effect (or for the Oscar) when the generally understated music swells more than necessary. But these are just quibbles.""I'm gonna find him. I'm gonna find him before the police do and I'm gonna kill him,"" Jimmy says as he stands over Katie's lifeless body. His insistence on keeping that promise is the source of Eastwood's most effective critique yet of American vigilante justice. ""Mystic River"" ends with a patriotic neighborhood parade, all the film's major characters in the crowd. It looks welcoming and friendly, but for one character it's a moment of horror and loss that brings ""Mystic River"" full circle. In conclusion, a powerful cast and superb direction by Clint Eastwood makes this story of violence and justice an unforgettable one.

The story also focuses too much on issues that arose between the characters in the past that have absolutely no manifestation or relevance with their present dilemmas: they might as well have been complete strangers and the story would have had the same impact: none. Although critics praise the film as a complex exploration into the human psyche one never really gets that impression from the film. The characters and plot are too poorly developed to comprise a meaningful character study. What does Tim Robbins' past as a victim of pedophilia have to do with anything in this story? Absolutely nothing. Although it functions as a plot technique for suspense, it could have been just about any other traumatic experience to make the character seem odd, evasive, and suspect. The film focuses too much on this and makes it appear an important element when it really has very little relevance. In sum, the film's plot and theme are poorly woven: they have little to no logical relationship to each other and comprise little else than big a non-sequitur in logical reasoning.This film is but a shallow, if not dry, river bed of a story with no character or thematic depth whatsoever. This by far has to be the most over-rated film of 2003.

He could do a stand-up act where he talks to an empty chair.Sorry, but I don't get it. Mystic River was an unpleasant script with unlikable characters. It was not entertaining. It was painful to watch. It was formulaic. When Sean Penn's daughter left the store, you already knew she was going to die and Sean Penn would blame her boyfriend.The ending was a total sell-out. Bacon is portrayed as a level-headed, competent, honest, and dedicated FBI agent who doesn't jump to wild conclusions and who tells his partner with believable conviction that he will go where the evidence leads. In the end, Bacon jumps the shark, fails to do his job, and turns out to be just one more corrupt cop.Roger Ebert says there was great suspense. There was only tediousness. Yes, the acting was strong, but it went nowhere except straight to an unsatisfying ending that was so predictable you could turn it off 30 minutes into the movie and miss nothing.Then there was the message in this movie: If you are sexually molested as a child, your life is over and you're better off dead because staying alive just makes your family and friends miserable.The only remotely interesting thing in the entire movie is why a black FBI agent's nickname would be ""Whitey"".

819393,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B0001ZX0OC,OverTheMoon,"[12, 20]","I missed this film twice in the cinema and only got around to watching it on DVD after all these months. Since word of mouth and the reviews had tooted this murder-mystery drama vehicle as Clint Eastwood's best thing since ""Unforgiven"" and with a cast to die for, Mystic River seemed like the kind of film that I would actually prepare my day around watching. Mystic River was not only a major disappointment but begs to ask questions about how this film got such acclaim? Was it on the bases of the book's following? Is this a case of what looks good on the page not translating to the screen? No it is more than just that - the acting is a way Over The Top (wait for Sean Penn to start crying out for his daughter in a crowd of officers) and at times appears as if the actors and actresses are aware of the camera (wait until the last scene to see this at its most distracting). Okay so we could live with a little OTT, but not only is the story really overacted but it is just plain bad and is terribly, terribly, slow (and this is coming from someone who watches Tarkovsky - no problem). So when I say slow I mean S-L-O-W is a sort of Steve McQueen ""Bullet"" sort of way where things are almost done in real time and nothing happens for up to ten minutes on end. People in the room fell asleep while watching this. Yes Eastwood manages to give us one of these long five minute shots where people sit around talking about grief - then in the next scene does exactly the same again! We where waiting maybe one hour and twenty minutes after the murder for something to happen, and it does, but it is just pointless at that moment because you don't care and just want to get this soppy completely dull viewing over and done with and Eastwood put back in the old folks home as soon as possible. Mystic River is a low-budget direct to DVD release that has someone managed to get itself `stars' and put itself on the silver screen. Without the stars the story is JUNK, television network quality screenwriting. It seems that a domino effect may have occurred with all the actors signing on one after the other like lemmings.The story, which I tried hard to avoid to read about(and wish I didn't) seems complex on the outside but is thoroughly hollow with some extraordinary scenes that totally break any realism that the film tries to employ. I would recommend Penn movie ""The Pledge"" or even ""Sleepers"" over this one any day of the week.Sean Penn plays Jimmy Markum, an ex-con with a family, Annabeth (Laura Linney who turns up for about four small scenes), a daughter who winds up dead in the side of the road battered to death with a bullet in her head, a detective, Kevin Bacon playing Sean Devine, who is hot on the case with Laurence Fishburne, Whitey Powers. Tim Robbins, playing Dave Boyle, comes home one night with blood all over him and a strange story about possibly killing a mugger. His wife Celeste, Marcia Harden, believes that Dave may have murdered Jimmy's girl. Tom Guiry plays Brendan Harris, son of a criminal who was connected to Jimmy and who wants to run away with Jimmy's daughter and to leave his deaf and dumb brother and friend behind. Jimmy, Sean and Dave used to grow up together in the neighbourhood but Dave was abducted and abused when he was younger.Sounds good right? Yeah this sounds like the makings of a really good crime drama, but it is all fake with the central plot revolving around Dave and Celeste's marriage breaking up and Celeste telling Jimmy what she 'thinks' she knows. So you can guess where this probably all goes in the end, but it is pointless because it is just so dull, lifeless and ultimately this movie GOES NOWHERE with an ending that is sprung from the pages of how to write a clich&eacute;d script. It is all bad bar the acting, but even at times the big names fail to bring us anything engaging by possibly trying to be too smart about something that wasn't.Bottom line in this thing is that it is a disappointment and drawn out slowly over a very thin plot with cornflakes box characters.Avoid and pretend that you never saw the REAL Mystic River that you heard about.

It's 3 kids, working-class poor, whose lives were changed the day one of them was abducted by a pedophile. That opening scene doesn't take long, but it's riveting with menace and seems to last forever. Then, flash forward maybe 3 decades. The boys are now men, each chasing his own demons.Dave, the man who was abused as a child is married with a child of his own, but he's an emotional shell, vulnerable in his arrested development. Jimmy, the brash one as a kid, is still brash. He did 2 years in prison for a petty crime and is now a devoted father of 3 daughters and owner of a corner store in the old neighborhood. Sean is an unemotional homicide detective whose job it is to notify Jimmy of his daughter's death and find her killer.The three have long ago drifted apart. Then Jimmy's 19yo daughter from a first marriage is murdered. And somebody's got to pay. Turns out they all pay in different ways.The directing by Clint Eastwood is superb; those who have read the excellent book will be pleased at how carefully he stays true to it. The acting is beyond superb; the three men are so perfectly cast that you completely forget they're acting. In this respect, the movie belongs to Sean Penn, an actor who's kept getting better and better and better over the years till now: and now, he's perfect. The plot is crafty and convoluted. The setting, shot in a working-class Boston neighborhood, is realistic.There are only a couple of oddly weak spots, and they're not weak enough to deserve the loss of a rating star. But Sean (the cop) had a nameless, faceless, estranged wife who keeps calling him and not speaking - and this is left unexplained. And Laura Linney plays Jimmy's wife (the only questionable bit of casting, IMO) who has this rather long speech near the end that's kind of out of nowhere and pretty over-the-top.Still, five solid stars and at least one Oscar nomination, for sure.

This is an intensive psychological murder mystery.  It is a roller coaster ride that starts out fast and never slows down.  This is a movie that explores the lives of three men deeply (in degrees) affected by a savage event of their youth.  As we see them as adults, we note the different directions that their lives have led and how they become intertwined again.  The development of the numerous essential characters in the story is outstanding yet it is done so well that the action never seems to slow down.  The acting is superb with special kudos to Sean Penn who seemed to reach new heights in his already impressive career.  There is such an array of subtlety, innuendo and shock that special recognition has to be paid to the Director; Clint Eastwood.  I know that he has directed before and won the Academy Award for &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;.  However, this movie has set a new standard for him as well.  The editing somehow missed an Oscar nomination but I can't see why in as much as the movie moves along so well.  If there is a criticism, it would be the ending.  I have no dispute with how the movie ends, I just think it falls a bit short of everything that led up to it.  I have not read the book but, knowing that the book is usually better than the movie, I'll certainly have to in this case.  This is not a movie for the whole family since the subject matter is probably too intense and, hopefully, incomprehensible for pre and early teens.  The violence and profanity is not over done as seems to happen so often these days.  This is a complex story told in a kaleidescope of imagery.  We get to know most all of the characters in such a way as to be involved in their pain and suffering.  The spouse of Dave is especially pathetic in a moving manner.  I don't necessarily watch movies to become emotionally exhausted.

One of the kids (Tim Robbins as Davey) is abducted by 2 men in a car who look like detectives. Davey is returned to the streets after 3 long days of torture and most likely sexual abuse. Jimmy (Sean Penn) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) are grateful Davey's back... but Davey's forever different. Years later, the children are now adults, and are for the most part living their separate lives. Jimmy is a corner grocery store owner with a strong love for his family. He's very rough around the edges... with his talk, his tattoos and his smoking and drinking. Sean is a detective for the state of Massachusetts and his lonely life is falling apart (no kids, wife has left him). Davey wanders from job to job and his wife (played by Marcia Gay Harden) supports him, tho often points the finger at him. Present day in ""Mystic River"" finds Jimmy's 19 year old daughter murdered... and this dark story tries to uncover what happened and more importanly who did it. Suspicion begins to rip all of them apart. Several Oscar nominations and 2 big Oscer winners for Penn & Robbins - all were well-deserved. Clint Eastwood did a great job directing (Oscar nominated). The city streets of Boston never looked better. Sean Penn turns in a great performance (perhaps of a lifetime)... especially the scene when he discovers his daughter's murder and he has to be restrained by what seemed like the entire Boston police force. Tim Robbins is wonderful as the moody, mysterious, and borderline-mad Davey. Does this movie deserve to be in the top class of movies  from 2003; including ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""Last Samauri"", ""Seabiscuit"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Master & Commandor"", ""Cold Mountain""? Yes it does. Two reasons why this DVD gets four stars... 1st being the actors attempts at authentic Boston accents (Laura Linney - ugh!); 2nd is due to NO worthwhile extra features on this DVD.

While Marcia Gay Harden seems to overact in places, and Sean Penn's powerful acting can sometimes feel overwhelming, the outstanding ensemble holds up its end of the bargain. What makes the movie work, though, is a clever screenplay that forces the viewer to again and again reconsider the motives of the characters.This is the story of a murder, that of Sean Penn's daughter. It is the story of secrets between friends, and of how one terrible event can haunt the lives of everyone involved, whether participant or bystander. And, while there are holes, and a few red herrings (particularly one involving Bacon's estrangement from his wife, whose face isn't fully shown through most of the movie), it is a story that resonates.Robbins is outstanding; the initial off-putting nature of his character is part of the remarkability of his performance. And Linney works magic in her limited screen time; her final scenes drive an icy dagger through the heart of the film and, more than anything else, give the ending its murky character.

When Jimmy's daughter, Kate, is murdered, Sean is called in to investigate and becomes a key part of the investigation process because of his involvement with Jimmy.From there, the story flies forward with heavy emotion and a great deal of suspense as Jimmy begins to go mad with rage and David exibits his own symptoms of madness.

Claster ""rjclaster""","[1, 3]","Although this much praised film is graced by strong acting and solid, craftsmanlike direction by Eastwood, its power as a story is fundamentally undercut by several factors, first by its failure to make any sense of Dave's refusal to come clean with his wife. Why, on one hand, he would tell her that he thought he killed a man, but not divulge the real reason behind his action.  Secondly, why did Kevin Bacon as a supposedly ethical policeman appear to give a pass to someone who he knew had murdered an innocent man? The fact that he had been a childhood companion of the murderer hardly seems like a credible reason, especially this was also equally true of his relationship with the victim. Finally, the vengeance taken lacks ultimate tragic power in that it is willful instead of something that the situation requires.  By contrast, in the Unforgiven, arguably Eastwood's magnum directorial opus of the previous decade, the deadly vigilante type violence his character displayed in avenging the murder of his friend is not only understandable but necessary to effect justice, much as one might recoil from what the protagonist did, given that the murderer was the town sheriff in a frontier setting lacking any alternative legal means of recourse.Alhthough this film is worth watching for its strengths, I find it fundamentally flawed in terms of both its credibility and dramatic power.",4,Powerful but flawed,1071014400,"12 10, 2003",2003,1393,"['much', 'praised', 'film', 'graced', 'strong', 'acting', 'solid', 'craftsmanlike', 'direction', 'Eastwood', 'power', 'story', 'fundamentally', 'undercut', 'several', 'factors', 'first', 'failure', 'make', 'sense', 'Dave', 'refusal', 'come', 'clean', 'wife', 'Why', 'one', 'hand', 'would', 'tell', 'thought', 'killed', 'man', 'not', 'divulge', 'real', 'reason', 'action', 'Secondly', 'why', 'did', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'supposedly', 'ethical', 'policeman', 'appear', 'give', 'pass', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'had', 'murdered', 'innocent', 'man', 'fact', 'had', 'been', 'childhood', 'companion', 'murderer', 'hardly', 'credible', 'reason', 'especially', 'was', 'also', 'equally', 'true', 'relationship', 'victim', 'Finally', 'vengeance', 'taken', 'lacks', 'ultimate', 'tragic', 'power', 'willful', 'instead', 'something', 'situation', 'contrast', 'Unforgiven', 'arguably', 'Eastwood', 'magnum', 'directorial', 'opus', 'previous', 'decade', 'deadly', 'vigilante', 'type', 'violence', 'character', 'displayed', 'avenging', 'murder', 'friend', 'not', 'only', 'understandable', 'necessary', 'effect', 'justice', 'much', 'one', 'might', 'recoil', 'what', 'protagonist', 'did', 'given', 'murderer', 'was', 'town', 'sheriff', 'frontier', 'setting', 'lacking', 'alternative', 'legal', 'means', 'recourse.Alhthough', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'strengths', 'find', 'fundamentally', 'flawed', 'terms', 'credibility', 'dramatic', 'power']",N/A

819417,A1RCAZWJQJ1767,B0001ZX0OC,Robert Lopez,"[4, 6]","First off this 2:31:1 Widescreen Edition DVD comes with absolutely NO extras whatsoever, just the basic subtitles. (Not even a commentary.) After that dissappointment I was ready to view the film.Incredible. Some of the best male performers today. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins deservedly earned those Oscars. Man, I was impressed. The story centers on 3 young best friends who are torn apart by a horrendous crime. Years later these friends are thrown together, by yet another horrendous crime. It seems their lives have been drastically altered by the incident that befell their childhood friend, Dave, and none of them have been the same since.I don't want to go through the plot, like so many have, but this film was extremely effective. Mainly because of the strong script, and unbelievably amazing actors to create this heartbreaking story. I read through most of these reviews and most people are either extremely for it, or against it in every sense of the word. Talks of horrible directing, unclear motivations, and a poor script. I, personally, completely disagree. This film was amazing for the simple fact of the strong character analysis. A strong beginning, a steady and suspensely middle, and a powerful ending. Each person had struggle and purpose. They were passionate, grieving, loving, confused, in denial, frustrated, all of the multifascited feelings to convey in a beautiful array of levels and deliveries.**SPOILERS**Some people didn't understand this picture and certain scenes where Dave (Robbins) got into the car with the brothers, and so forth. Simply put, when Dave was abducted as a child, he denied that he was sexually assaulted by the assailents and has kept this horrible experience hidden deep within him for nearly thirty years. This is emphasized in the scenes when Bacon's character told his partner that &quot;Dave wasn't sexually assaulted,&quot; and also when Dave tells his wife the name's of the kidnappers and she doesn't know what he's talking about. This means that Dave never really spoke to his wife about his abduction, and never went in detail about his 4 days in hell. Dave had held all these feelings in and wasn't even able to tell his wife the truth about who he really killed that evening. If he exposed the truth about killing a pedophile while saving the teenager it would have come out that Dave, was indeed raped all those years ago. Dave was ashamed and was trapped inside himself and was falling further and further in. (Also to answer the question why did Dave get into the car with the brothers... Well Dave grew up with Jimmy (Penn) and the brothers, so he's known them his whole life...why WOULDN'T he get into the car with them??)Penn's character was a handful from the start of the film, causing trouble out of boredom. After the incident with Dave, Jimmy's life seemed to crumble along with him. He sort of blamed himself for what happened to Dave, since he was the one who innitiated the writing in the cement. He seemed to distance himself from people. He was constantly getting into trouble and associating himself with the wrong crowd, earning some jail time. His daughter was the only thing that kept him from completely crossing over into the crime scene. Now he is a family man who loves his children more than anything in the world. And the unusual scene at the end of the film when his wife &quot;seduces&quot; him after he tells her they killed Dave, was a scene to calm his nerves and assure him that they all would know that Jimmy only killed Dave because he was the number one suspect of his daughters murder, and even Dave's wife agreed. Jimmy's wife needed him to go on and provide for the family he still has. She wanted him to continue to be the &quot;King&quot; of the streets to love and protect them at all cost. She wanted everyone to know that to mess with his family is the wrong thing to do. And since Dave's wife even thought that Dave killed the girl, that is every reason to rid the world of a lunatic, that was bound to commit a crime due to his horrific past.Bacon's character was the one who couldn't stay in a stable relationship with his wife. He was lost and alone, and didn't know how to deal with this otherwise typical situation. The ending almost seemed that now that Dave, the hurtful part of their life, was gone they were all able to move on with their lives and forget about the past that had been weighing them down all these years. They were both ready to start over again.**END OF SPOILERS**These are the things that I observed and analysed while watching the film. Most people will think otherwise, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But never the less, this is a film that should be seen and experienced first hand, if not for the text, for the amazing performances, including the amazingly subtle Marica Gay Harden as Dave's tormented wife.",4,"Movie Gets 5 Stars, DVD gets 1 Star",1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,4863,"['First', '2:31:1', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'just',

819418,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001ZX0OC,Robert Moore,"[3, 7]","This is in my opinion the apex of Clint Eastwood's career as a director.  In a way, I believe the standard Clint Eastwood character has sometimes obscured the moral ambiguity at the heart of many of his films.  In some, it becomes more obvious, as in UNFORGIVEN and TIGHTROPE, but usually the characters he plays misleadingly gives the films more moral clarity than exists.  But with no roles appropriate for his age, this film is tremendously strengthened by his not appearing in the film.It is impossible to over praise the acting in this film.  Many have opined that Sean Penn should win an Oscar for his performance, but I think a group Oscar by Best Performance by an Ensemble Cast would be more appropriate.  No one does a bad job, but the performances by Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, and Marcia Gay Harden stand out.  Each one of them brings a level of believability and pathos to his or her character, and while Penn is getting well deserved attention for his performance, I believe Robbins does just as well in his tormented, disturbed character.A couple of reviewers have suggested this isn't a mystery film, but that isn't quite right.  It certainly isn't a whodunit, but it is very definitely about the mysteries of the human psyche, of the monsters that we sometimes become because of the horrors that afflict us.  Tim Robbins's character mentions often werewolves and vampires, and what each has in common is that in each case they become monsters because of things that have happened to them against their will.  So too he intimates that he is a bit of a monster because of the events recounted early in the film.  I haven't read the novel upon which the film is based, but the plot bears some resemblance to the plots of the novels of Ross MacDonald, in which the causes for crimes in the present are often to be found in the past.  Or, as Yeats put it in &quot;Leda and the Swan,&quot; when Zeus rapes and impregnates Leda, who will give birth to Helen, he &quot;engenders there/The broken wall, the burning roof and tower/And Agamemnon dead.&quot;  So too, Dave's getting into the car and Jimmy and Sean's not getting into the care created the possibilities that unfolded in the course of this film.Unlike some of the reviewers who have complained about the ending, I think it is the ending that makes this film the minor masterpiece that it is.  The crucial scene is the one with Laura Linney in the bedroom near the end explaining to Sean Penn what role he has to play.  Without giving away any plot, I will just hint that that scene provides the key with which to understand everything touching the end of the film.This is a powerful and impressive film, and will represent one of the highpoints of the careers in all the principals involved.",5,"Disturbing, wonderfully complex, and dark as sin",1069545600,"11 23, 2003",2003,2766,"['opinion', 'apex', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'director', 'way', 'believe', 'standard', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'sometimes', 'obscured', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'heart', 'many', 'films', 'more', 'obvious', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'TIGHTROPE', 'usually', 'characters', 'misleadingly', 'films', 'more', 'moral', 'clarity', 'exists', 'roles', 'appropriate', 'age', 'film', 'tremendously', 'strengthened', 'not', 'appearing', 'film.It', 'impossible', 'praise', 'acting', 'film', 'Many', 'have', 'opined', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'should', 'win', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'think', 'group', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Performance', 'Ensemble', 'Cast', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'one', 'bad', 'job', 'performances', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'stand', 'out', 'one', 'level', 'believability', 'pathos', 'character', 'Penn', 'getting', 'well', 'deserved', 'attention', 'performance', 'believe', 'Robbins', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'tormented', 'disturbed', 'character.A', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'have', 'suggested', ""n't"", 'mystery', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'whodunit', 'very', 'definitely', 'mysteries', 'human', 'psyche', 'monsters', 'sometimes', 'become', 'horrors', 'afflict', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'mentions', 'often', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'what', 'common', 'case', 'become', 'monsters', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'will', 'So', 'too', 'bit', 'monster', 'events', 'recounted', 'early', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'plot', 'resemblance', 'plots', 'novels', 'Ross', 'MacDonald', 'causes', 'crimes', 'present', 'are', 'often', 'be', 'found', 'past', 'Yeats', 'put', 'quot', 'Leda', 'Swan', 'quot', 'when', 'Zeus', 'rapes', 'impregnates', 'Leda', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'birth', 'Helen', 'quot', 'engenders', 'there/The', 'broken', 'wall', 'burning', 'roof', 'tower/And', 'Agamemnon', 'dead.', 'quot', 'So', 'too', 'Dave', 'getting', 'car', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'not', 'getting', 'care', 'created', 'possibilities', 'unfolded', 'course', 'film.Unlike', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'complained', 'ending', 'think', 'ending', 'film', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'crucial', 'scene', 'one', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'bedroom', 'end', 'explaining', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'what', 'role', 'play', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'will', 'just', 'hint', 'scene', 'key', 'understand', 'everything', 'touching', 'end', 'film.This', 'powerful', 'impressive', 'film', 'will', 'represent', 'one', 'highpoints', 'careers', 'principals', 'involved']",N/A
819419,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B0001ZX0OC,Robert Morris,"[4, 12]","I have been fascinated by Eastwood's evolution as a director from Play Misty for Me (1970) through The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and Unforgiven (1992) to Mystic River. The development and refinement of his skills behind the camera are even more impressive, given the fact that he struggled as a film actor, gained some celebrity from his role as Rowdy Yates in the television series Rawhide (1959-1965), and was offered major roles in U.S. films only after starring in several ""Spaghetti Westerns"" (1964-1966) filmed abroad.Opinions of Mystic River are somewhat mixed. My own is that it is among Eastwood's greatest achievements as a director. The acting and cinematography are also outstanding. Sean Penn (Jimmy Markum) and Tim Robbins (Dave Boyle) received and deserved their Academy wards. I was also impressed by all of the other performances, notably those by Marcia Gay Harden (Celeste Boyle), Kevin Bacon (Sean Devine), Laurence Fishburne (Whitey Powers), and especially Laura Linney (Annabeth Markum). This is an intense film, with both menace and rage never far below the surface of mutually endured civility. All of the leading characters seem to be hauling enough ""baggage"" to fill a C5A cargo jet. Eastwood is considered to be a ""tidy"" director in that he wastes little time preparing for and then filming his scenes (usually with only one or two takes) and generously allows his actors to develop their own interpretations of the characters they portray. Through brilliant editing, he also allows the plot to develop at what seems to me to be a natural pace. He neither forces the action nor allows it to dawdle.My one issue with Mystic River is its climax, but not its conclusion which seems plausible, given prior events. (I have not read Dennis Lehane's novel on which Brian Helgeland's screenplay is based.) In any event, the revelation in the kitchen is disappointing because it seems facile and contrived. Almost perfunctory. Most of the tension in the film develops after the murder of Katie Markum and builds to that revelation. For me, the climax doesn't work. One man's opinion. That said, I think this is a great film in all other respects and look forward to seeing again.",5,One of Eastwood's Most Impressive Achievements,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,2197,"['have', 'been', 'fascinated', 'Eastwood', 'evolution', 'director', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', '1970', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', '1976', 'Unforgiven', '1992', 'Mystic', 'River', 'development', 'refinement', 'skills', 'camera', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'given', 'fact', 'struggled', 'film', 'actor', 'gained', 'celebrity', 'role', 'Rowdy', 'television', 'series', 'Rawhide', '1959-1965', 'was', 'offered', 'major', 'roles', 'U.S.', 'films', 'only', 'starring', 'several', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', '1964-1966', 'filmed', 'abroad.Opinions', 'Mystic', 'River', 'are', 'somewhat', 'mixed', 'own', 'Eastwood', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'director', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'are', 'also', 'outstanding', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Jimmy', 'Markum', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'received', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'wards', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'other', 'performances', 'notably', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Celeste', 'Boyle', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Whitey', 'Powers', 'especially', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Annabeth', 'Markum', 'intense', 'film', 'menace', 'rage', 'never', 'far', 'surface', 'mutually', 'endured', 'civility', 'leading', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'hauling', 'enough', 'baggage', 'fill', 'C5A', 'cargo', 'jet', 'Eastwood', 'considered', 'be', 'tidy', 'director', 'little', 'time', 'preparing', 'then', 'filming', 'scenes', 'usually', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'generously', 'actors', 'develop', 'own', 'interpretations', 'characters', 'portray', 'brilliant', 'editing', 'also', 'plot', 'develop', 'what', 'be', 'natural', 'pace', 'action', 'dawdle.My', 'one', 'issue', 'Mystic', 'River', 'climax', 'not', 'conclusion', 'plausible', 'given', 'prior', 'events', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'novel', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'screenplay', 'based', 'event', 'revelation', 'kitchen', 'disappointing', 'facile', 'contrived', 'Almost', 'perfunctory', 'Most', 'tension', 'film', 'murder', 'Katie', 'Markum', 'builds', 'revelation', 'climax', ""n't"", 'work', 'One', 'man', 'opinion', 'said', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'other', 'respects', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again']",N/A
819420,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,B0001ZX0OC,Rocco Dormarunno,"[0, 0]","One thing must be kept in mind: making a screen adaptation from a best-selling novel is hell. For those who thought this movie was too dark, Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name has such a bleak outlook on life that it sometimes makes you wish you hadn't read it. As I have said in a review of the book, it almost makes you wish you were never born. It was no easy task for Eastwood & Co. to make this palatable to the movie-goer. And it is to their credit that this film is so engrossing, so absorbing without being overbearing.""Mystic River"", as has been pointed out, is Eastwood's tour-de-force. The pacing is swift and, it seems, he allowed his actors a lot of room to explore. And why not? With a cast like this, let them run with their roles. (Laura Linney's Lady Macbeth-like performance was something to behold!)As far as the extras/special features went, they were a plus.

819421,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,B0001ZX0OC,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[8, 11]","...that title remains with Unforgiven.Mystic river is a good movie, not a great one. It has a great story and great characters - with a good screenplay by Brian Helgeland, based on Dennis Lehane's book. The directing is solid, while not really bringing anything special to the film, yet pacing it prefectly in building the tension around the murder.What is outstanding about this film is the acting. Sean Penn gives yet another inspired performance as a working class father from Boston who just lost his oldest daughter to a horrific murder. Although the scenes that most people seem to remember (and that are shown in the trailer) show his *exaggerated* response to his daughter's death, the rest of the performance is more subdued and restrained.Tim Robbins' performance is also of note, as Penn's disturbed boyhood friend who shows up covered in blood the same night of the murder, making his frightened wife (Marcia Gay Harden) start to doubt his story and to believe that he is in fact the murderer.The rest of the cast give solid performances in somewhat limited characters, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne as the cops asigned to the case, and Laura Linney as Penn's second wife.However, there are a few things about the film that rubbed me the wrong way; the whole sub-plot about Bacon's wife calling him on his cell phone and not speaking? What was that suppossed to bring to the movie? Or Linney's (apparently) sudden transformation into Lady MacBeth, telling Penn's character that he should do whatever needed to be done?

819423,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001ZX0OC,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 5]","Lovers of great acting had best not pass up ""Mystic River,"" Clint Eastwood's powerful, award-laden adaptation of Dennis Lehane's best-selling novel.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon play three working class Bostonians forever bound together by a mutual childhood tragedy that has since gone on to define the kind of people they`ve become and the kind of lives they`ve led.  The film begins with a brief prologue as we see the three youngsters - Jimmy, Sean and Dave - out playing in the street one day, when they are confronted by a pedophile who, posing as a policeman, tricks one of them, Dave, into getting into the car with him and another man.  Fast forward to the present as we pick up the trio as grown men who have, for all intents and purposes, gone their separate ways.  Penn is Jimmy Markum, a former petty thief who spent two years in the slammer but who has since turned straight and now owns a neighborhood liquor store.  When Jimmy's daughter from his first marriage turns up murdered, the three men's lives intersect in ways they could never have imagined.  Bacon is Sean Divine, a homicide detective assigned to the case, and Robbins is Dave Boyle, a sporadically employed man who may be a prime suspect in the murder.  Dave still lives with the trauma of that earlier soul-shattering experience, while Jimmy and Sean wrestle with why they managed to escape the cruel finger of fate that pointed so grimly at their hapless playmate.  The film is about how the events of our early lives (and, in the case of Jimmy, it doesn't stop at this one incident) can end up coming back to haunt us later down the road.The Brian Helgeland screenplay makes the pain that each of these men experiences vivid and palpable.  The grief Jimmy feels over the loss of his beloved child, the psychological torment Dave suffers as a result of his abuse, and the bewilderment and loneliness Sean experiences from a failed marriage all become integral to this dark tale of bitterness, revenge and attempted healing.  At times, we do find ourselves wishing that the script would concentrate less on the details of the murder investigation and more on the inner workings of the three main characters.  Too often we feel as if we are only scratching the surface of the roiling psychological torment taking place deep in the bowels of these men.  The plotting, particularly towards the end, often feels more contrived than it needs to be, with heavy-handed ironies and obtruding parallelisms that don`t seem to know when to leave well enough alone.  Laura Linney, as Jimmy's second wife, has a key Lady Macbeth moment late in the film that might have been effective had we been more fully prepared for it and had her character been more thoroughly developed throughout the course of the film.  As it is, the scene seems to come out of nowhere and leaves us both bewildered and hanging.Still, these are minor quibbles when it comes to a movie as finely acted and directed as this one is.  Penn hits all the right notes as a man facing the worst experience life could possibly throw at a person - the murder of one's child - trying to make sense of a tragedy that defies any rational explanation.  Robbins beautifully underplays the role of a man scarred forever by what happened to him in his youth, now endeavoring to function as an adult when he was robbed of any semblance of a childhood.  Bacon is excellent as the man who attempts to put all the pieces together, not only of the case but of the shattered lives he and his two buddies have been living all these years, and Marcia Gay Harden is outstanding as Dave's loving wife who struggles with what is perhaps the greatest moral dilemma faced by any character in the movie.  Linney, Lawrence Fishburne and Tom Guiry offer fine supporting performances.As director, Eastwood allows his superb cast ample time to develop their characters, never hurrying the proceedings along and always allowing the conversations to play themselves out.  He recognizes the quality of the material and feels no need to gussy it up with self-conscious camera angles or fancy editing.  He also uses the bleak settings of blue collar Boston as an effective backdrop to the stark, chilly tale he is telling.Perhaps it is just an odd coincidence that three of the very best movies of 2003 - ""21 Grams,"" ""The House of Sand and Fog"" and ""Mystic River"" - all suffer from the same tendency on the part of the filmmakers to move away from reality and towards melodrama and contrivance in the final act.  Of the three, ""21 Grams"" and ""The House of Sand and Fog"" are harmed less by this than ""Mystic River"" because they have a somewhat deeper thematic base and richer character development than does the Eastwood film.  Still, ""Mystic River"" is a mighty impressive achievement for those who made it and a rich, memorable experience for those who see it.",4,falls short of greatness but powerful

Movies like Mystic River, which break the rule, can be brilliant or disturbing.In the opening scene, three boys are playing street hockey.  A stranger impersonating a cop orders one of them into a car. The other two watch helplessly as their friend is abducted.The movie then joins the three in adulthood: abduction victim Dave (Tim Robbins), ex-con turned family man Jimmy (Sean Penn), and detective Sean (Kevin Bacon).  How will the three characters, past and present, fit together?  We expect friendship, but that clich&eacute; is quickly trampled.  When Jimmy's daughter is murdered, the childhood bond isn't so strong that Sean and his partner can't investigate.  And while Dave still lives in the neighborhood, he's a suspect preoccupied with his own problems.  Friendship seems to have died the day of the abduction, so these guys might do anything to each other.Mystic River inhabits a real, day-to-day universe.  Characters make off-task remarks and struggle to find the right words.  That makes the tragic scenes all the more disturbing: the body at the murder site, the father's anguish, the body at the morgue, the body at the funeral home . . . enough with the body!  I wanted to leave at that point, but the mystery drew me in.  Not the whodunit kind of mystery, for the detectives are sharp and evidence is everywhere.  The mystery of how and when the pieces will come together.Other clich&eacute;s and assumptions get trampled along the way.  We're unsure who to grieve or cheer for.  Victims can hide their own misdeeds.  Good guys can hide the truth.Everything seems so real.  What better complement can be paid to the acting?  A few moments of going overboard perhaps challenge the reality effect.  Jimmy's anguish could use an occasional interruption, and Michael's suspicious wife is too blatant at times.  But those are imperfections of script, not acting.If you believe in the evil/goodness rule, you might not like the ending.  Mystic River is true to its own rules, and consistent with its own universe.

819432,A6FIAB28IS79,B0001ZX0OC,Samuel Chell,"[7, 9]","I'm on vacation, had already seen &quot;Anchor Man,&quot; and had no interest in making a 40 mile-round trip to see Spider Man, Will Smith's Robot movie, or the latest Mat Damon blockbuster. So it was off to a nearby truck stop with a very limited selection of DVD's for sale. Turned out to be a no-brainer when one was by my 2nd favorite director, Clint Eastwood (never try to view a Robert Altman movie except in a big theater with state-of-the-art sound).Eastwood really is at the top of his game with this one. The theme of the tortured loner needing to reconcile with his past, the use of film noir framings and muted textures in a color film, the Greek-like preference for action off rather than on-screen (there was only one violent scene in the whole 150-minute movie, which felt half that length), and the transforming of potential character types into human beings of great subtlety and depth--they're all here. The film has a strong attachment to place (Boston), yet the shots and narrative continuity are so tight that watching them on a small computer screen did not detract from the film's compelling hold. And despite themes of priestly pedophilia (notice the ring finger of the abductor), rape, fratricide, blood revenge--it all works at a deep and universal level because Eastwood manages to leave most of it to the spectator's imagination. The past Eastwood aims to trace is part of the present, which ultimately proves inseparable from the past. The child is father of the man, and in the end Eastwood's innocents retain enough innocense to make them recognizable from their limited time on screen in the film's opening shots.Neither the title nor the image of water should be taken lightly. Besides linking the lives of the three principals and their later convergence, it serves as a symbol of both destruction and life, of disposal and retribution. More significantly, Eastwood's archetypal association of the movement of water with mystical oneness places the story within every human's quest--as a flight from death by water and return to its role as the origin of new life. (It's tempting but I won't invoke &quot;The Wasteland&quot; here, lest it appear as off base as Ebert's Lady MacBeth comparison). All of the performances deserve praise, though my wife disagreed with me over Kevin Bacon, who looked a bit young and slight to me. (Despite overcompensating mightily to take on a Bogart edge, he's not quite a match for his detective partner Lawrence Fishburne's strong screen presence); Robins is a sympathetically lost, non-directed personality, someone who is always slightly out of focus to himself; Penn, for the first time, comes across as a genuine actor with range, not merely as a James Dean wannabe or former Madonna boyfriend. He deserves the Oscar for his portrayal of the torn (but hardly guiltless) father.And Eastwood keeps you guessing throughout this entire mystery, reminding me of that little gem--&quot;Tight Rope&quot;--which he did in the mid-80's. (Wish he had directed &quot;Cruisin',&quot; which William Friedkin didn't get quite right.) In &quot;Tight Rope&quot; we're not sure until the final scene that the sexual pervert and serial killer isn't Clint himself--as he continually manages to imply and implicate the darkness that lies within us all (has any director ever had a better understanding of original sin?). For me, the one slight disappointment of &quot;Mystic River&quot; (or perhaps two) is the double &quot;happy ending,&quot; which feels forced and dramatically unmotivated, sort of a nod to family values, though I suppose it's possible to reconcile it with the Lethean cleansing suggested by the film's title. If it helped with the popular success of this singularly mature and worthwhile movie, I won't complain too loudly.",5,Life's Mysterious Streams and Mystic Outcomes,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,3796,"[""'m"", 'vacation', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'quot', 'Anchor', 'Man', 'quot', 'had', 'interest', 'making', '40', 'mile-round', 'trip', 'see', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Robot', 'movie', 'latest', 'Mat', 'Damon', 'blockbuster', 'was', 'off', 'nearby', 'truck', 'stop', 'very', 'limited', 'selection', 'DVD', 'sale', 'Turned', 'out', 'be', 'no-brainer', 'when', 'one', 'was', '2nd', 'favorite', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'never', 'try', 'view', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'movie', 'big', 'theater', 'state-of-the-art', 'sound', '.Eastwood', 'really', 'top', 'game', 'one', 'theme', 'tortured', 'loner', 'needing', 'reconcile', 'past', 'use', 'film', 'noir', 'framings', 'muted', 'textures', 'color', 'film', 'Greek-like', 'preference', 'action', 'rather', 'on-screen', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'violent', 'scene', 'whole', '150-minute', 'movie', 'felt', 'half', 'length', 'transforming', 'potential', 'character', 'types', 'human', 'beings', 'great', 'subtlety', 'depth', ""'re"", 'here', 'film', 'strong', 'attachment', 'place', 'Boston', 'yet', 'shots', 'narrative', 'continuity', 'are', 'so', 'tight', 'watching', 'small', 'computer', 'screen', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'film', 'compelling', 'hold', 'themes', 'priestly', 'pedophilia', 'ring', 'finger', 'abductor', 'rape', 'fratricide', 'blood', 'revenge', 'deep', 'universal', 'level', 'Eastwood', 'manages', 'leave', 'most', 'spectator', 'imagination', 'past', 'Eastwood', 'aims', 'trace', 'part', 'present', 'ultimately', 'inseparable', 'past', 'child', 'father', 'man', 'end', 'Eastwood', 'innocents', 'retain', 'enough', 'innocense', 'make', 'recognizable', 'limited', 'time', 'screen', 'film', 'opening', 'title', 'image', 'water', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'linking', 'lives', 'three', 'principals', 'later', 'convergence', 'symbol', 'destruction', 'life', 'disposal', 'retribution', 'More', 'significantly', 'Eastwood', 'archetypal', 'association', 'movement', 'water', 'mystical', 'oneness', 'story', 'human', 'quest', 'flight', 'death', 'water', 'return', 'role', 'origin', 'new', 'life', 'tempting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'invoke', 'quot', 'Wasteland', 'quot', 'here', 'lest', 'appear', 'off', 'base', 'Ebert', 'Lady', 'MacBeth', 'comparison', 'performances', 'deserve', 'praise', 'wife', 'disagreed', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'looked', 'bit', 'young', 'slight', 'overcompensating', 'mightily', 'take', 'Bogart', 'edge', 'not', 'quite', 'match', 'detective', 'partner', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'Robins', 'sympathetically', 'lost', 'non-directed', 'personality', 'someone', 'who', 'always', 'slightly', 'focus', 'Penn', 'first', 'time', 'across', 'genuine', 'actor', 'range', 'not', 'merely', 'James', 'Dean', 'wannabe', 'former', 'Madonna', 'boyfriend', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'torn', 'hardly', 'guiltless', 'father.And', 'Eastwood', 'guessing', 'entire', 'mystery', 'reminding', 'little', 'gem', 'quot', 'Tight', 'Rope', 'quot', 'did', 'mid-80', 'Wish', 'had', 'directed', 'quot', 'Cruisin', 'quot', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'quite', 'right', 'quot', 'Tight', 'Rope', 'quot', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'final', 'scene', 'sexual', 'pervert', 'serial', 'killer', ""n't"", 'Clint', 'continually', 'imply', 'implicate', 'darkness', 'director', 'ever', 'had', 'better', 'understanding', 'original', 'sin', 'one', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'two', 'double', 'quot', 'happy', 'ending', 'quot', 'forced', 'dramatically', 'unmotivated', 'sort', 'nod', 'family', 'values', 'suppose', 'possible', 'reconcile', 'Lethean', 'cleansing', 'suggested', 'film', 'title', 'helped', 'popular', 'success', 'singularly', 'mature', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'loudly']",N/A
819433,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0001ZX0OC,Samuel McKewon,"[13, 17]","Infused with near-biblical power, Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" is a straight hard drink of masculine theory, a journey into the world's dark, vengeful crevices, where the strong eat the weak, yet are not spared by God, and pay dearly for the feast. Beginning in the streets of Boston during the 1978 baseball pennant race and ending 25 years later on the banks of the title river, Eastwood transforms Dennis Lehane's novel into a portrait on the permanence of tragedy and untidy justice.The seams of the plot burst wide open in the film's final 20 minutes, but by then the hooks are in us as much as they are three dye-in-the-wool Irishmen - Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) - caught in a storm of fate that starts to churn when they're 12 years old, as Dave is molested by men pretending to be cops. Dave escapes them after four days, but he's marked - the adult Dave likens it to the undead state of a vampire - and by that adulthood he's lost touch with Jimmy, a shrewd, anguished ex-con running a corner grocery market, and Sean, a square-jawed homicide detective.But their lives intersect again when Jimmy's oldest daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum), is murdered in a nearby park. Dave - who returned home to his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) awash in blood and a gash across his belly - is a likely suspect, as is Katie's secret boyfriend (Tom Guiry), who had planned to elope with her to Las Vegas and has more ties to Jimmy than it first seems. Sean and his sharp, no-nonsense partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne, nicely low key) lead the murder investigation. Jimmy, meanwhile, has his own team of interrogating thugs.Eastwood, always for substance over plot, wisely pushes the emotional intangibles of Lehane's novel, bearing his camera down on these haunted men and their frailties, while offering Penn free reign to chew whatever scenery he sees fit: His Jimmy is a smart, passionate man, capable of deep love and deep hate, and always mindful of a criminal side he can tap in a flash.Penn has always been a mannered, showy actor, and this performance might be filled with more dramatic blarney than any of his celebrated roles, but he is magnetic in scene after scene; when one character suggests Jimmy could rule the town, we believe it. Penn is a lock for every award nomination they've got to give.The rest of the cast is informed by Penn's work, and equally good. Robbins is perfectly cast as a sad-eyed, shut down giant stalked by his own shadow.  Dave isn't stupid - watch how swiftly he turns the tables on Sean and Whitey during one interrogation - but broken, and hardly comforted by his timid wife, played by Harden as a bundle of nerves barely holding herself together. Bacon essentially inhabits the Joe Friday role, though his character is wrapped up in a bizarre subplot with a long-estranged wife who calls him up only to say nothing. Guiry is fine as the boyfriend, and Laura Linney, in a small role as Jimmy's wife, Annabeth, is given a rather cruel, unlikely speech in the movie's final moments that nonetheless hammers home the have/have-not theme on which the movie thrives.As a director, Eastwood is notoriously quick and economical; as a result, some of his more recent films - ""Absolute Power,"" ""True Crime"" and ""Blood Work"" - have been thin and visually flat. But the 73-year-old is up to this material, and much like his masterpiece ""Unforgiven,"" Eastwood has the strong script (from ""LA Confidential"" writer Brian Helgeland) and actors to tackle a fast shoot.  ""Mystic River"" is stark and naturally lit. The few flourishes it takes - a God's eye view of the murder scene, a screen of pure white during the movie's climax, helicopter tours of the dark, velvet river - are masterful touches.""Mystic River"" is such a tense, moving experience for much of its running time that the ending, which includes a left-field suspect and a turn of events that fly in the face with judicial reality, is a bit of disorienting letdown. Linney's speech, and that final, cocky shot of Penn, is likely to draw a few looks of disbelief. But the movie has so enforced the idea of lifelong spiritual debt that, while ""Mystic River"" ends, there is a distinct sense that the characters have not finished their penance. As one character says: ""God says you owed another marker. He came to collect.""",4,"Uncompromising, grueling.

Not that it will change the mystery, but so you can fully appreciate what the actors and filmmakers achieved with this movie.It an old plot line of tragedy occurring in the bloom of youth that affects the lives of a group of friends later in life, but Mystic River goes far deeper than most of the stories that follow this path.  I haven't been this overwhelmed by this particularly downtrodden plot since Lorenzo Carcaterra's ""Sleepers"" (the book, NOT the movie).Jimmy, Dave, and Sean (played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon respectively) were childhood friends growing up in a ""working man"" neighborhood, when a cop stops to confront them about carving their names into fresh cement on the sidewalk.The ""cops"" take Dave away, but they weren't cops; they were child molesters.  Dave is held captive by these monsters for four days, until he manages to escape.The movie then skips to present time, roughly thirty years later, and picks up on the lives of the boys.  Dave is married, marginally employed, with a young son of his own and dark memories of his past.  Sean is a detective, with an absent wife that telephones him at odd hours and says nothing.  Jimmy is married, three daughters, and owns a corner store.  Jimmy also has a criminal past, and an active relationship with the Savage Boys, neighborhood tough guys.Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter, Katie, is brutally murdered, and while Sean heads the investigation of her death, Dave retracts more into his own world, hiding a dark secret.Is Mystic River a riveting movie?  No.  Is Mystic River the kind of mystery that has you on the edge of your seat?  No.Although there is a pleasant twist in the ending, there are no surprises and no biting of fingernails.What you will feel is that tingle of dread creeping along your spine, a vague horror constructed of real life tragedy, a shivering echo of ""what if"", all portrayed superbly by this stellar cast.  Tim Robbins is always great, but his portrayal of Dave's tortured mind is provocative and stunningly realistic; this may be Robbin's greatest performance to date.And I never expected Sean Penn to develop into such an exceptional actor, Mystic River really is his finest hour on screen.So yes, the movie unfolds at a slow pace, but at no point did I find myself bored or loosing interest in the storyline.  The acting was inspired, the storyline is a fresh twist on a used plot, the mystery enough of an unknown to keep the pace, the dialogue believable, and the horror kept well hidden in the shadowy corners of your own imagination.Over all, I highly recommend this movie.

However, every once in a while it happens to me that while watching a film I think that I would like to read the novel too. This was the case with ""The Shipping News"", and it was also the case with ""Mystic River"". When I watched this production, I was constantly thinking that the story was so perfect, that the book must be great. I hope I get a chance to confirm this suspicion soon.Anyway, going back to the movie, the story evolves around the lives of three childhood friends that went through a traumatic experience when one of them, Dave, was bullied into a car by two adults posing as police officers. He was abused for days until he could finally escape, but something broke inside him, and all three friends where affected as a result.Now, Jimmy (Sean Penn) owns a convenience store and is still involved with some dangerous men from his days as a delinquent, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police officer who was abandoned by his wife six months ago and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a married man that lives a quiet life but still has ghosts from his past that visit him. These three men have not really been in contact with each other over the last few years, even though they live in the same city.When Jimmy's oldest daughter is murdered, Sean is the detective in charge of the investigation. Also, Dave was in the bar Jimmy's daughter went to the night of her death, and he later came home to his wife bearing a knife wound and alleging that he was mugged by a man that he had to kill. Once the path of the three friends converges, we find ourselves in the middle of a craftily constructed story, which has all the elements that make a great mystery.Besides the script being incredibly good, it allows the actors to show their best aptitudes by having very powerful scenes and a lot of interesting exchanges. If you have seen this movie it should come as no surprise that both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for their performances in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor respectively. I really found no drawbacks in this film, but understand that some people may find the story somewhat disturbing. I still think that it is worth seeing by anyone that is not extremely sensitive to murder and violence.",5,"""All three of us got in that car""",1103068800,"12 15, 2004",2004,2276,"['general', 'rule', 'like', 'read', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'However', 'once', 'while', 'watching', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'read', 'novel', 'too', 'was', 'case', 'Shipping', 'News', 'was', 'also', 'case', 'Mystic', 'River', 'When', 'watched', 'production', 'was', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'perfect', 'book', 'must', 'be', 'great', 'hope', 'get', 'chance', 'confirm', 'suspicion', 'soon.Anyway', 'going', 'back', 'movie', 'story', 'lives', 'three', 'childhood', 'friends', 'went', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'when', 'one', 'Dave', 'was', 'bullied', 'car', 'two', 'adults', 'posing', 'police', 'officers', 'was', 'abused', 'days', 'could', 'finally', 'escape', 'something', 'broke', 'three', 'friends', 'where', 'affected', 'result.Now', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'convenience', 'store', 'still', 'involved', 'dangerous', 'men', 'days', 'delinquent', 'Sean', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'abandoned', 'wife', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'Dave', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'married', 'man', 'quiet', 'life', 'still', 'ghosts', 'past', 'visit', 'three', 'men', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'been', 'contact', 'other', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'even', 'live', 'same', 'city.When', 'Jimmy', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'murdered', 'Sean', 'detective', 'charge', 'investigation', 'Also', 'Dave', 'was', 'bar', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'went', 'night', 'death', 'later', 'came', 'home', 'wife', 'bearing', 'knife', 'wound', 'alleging', 'was', 'mugged', 'man', 'had', 'kill', 'path', 'three', 'friends', 'converges', 'find', 'middle', 'craftily', 'constructed', 'story', 'elements', 'make', 'great', 'script', 'being', 'incredibly', 'good', 'actors', 'show', 'best', 'aptitudes', 'having', 'very', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'lot', 'interesting', 'exchanges', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'won', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'Lead', 'Actor', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'respectively', 'really', 'found', 'drawbacks', 'film', 'understand', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'story', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'still', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'not', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'murder', 'violence']",N/A

819445,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B0001ZX0OC,S. Harris,"[0, 0]","""Mystic River"" is based upon Dennis Lehane's fine novel of the same name.  Eastwood does a good job with what it is basically a faithful retelling of the book.  Unfortunately, probably out of necessity, the novel's depths are often given a shorthand treatment that relies a great deal on its actors.  And for the most part this works.  Penn as Jimmy is terrific.  Anguished and angry, his intensity simply jumps off the screen.  He deserved the Oscar.  But just as good is Tim Robbins, as the damaged Davey.  To some extent his role is the more difficult one.  Sexually abused as a child, a middle aged failure who has nevertheless succeeded at being a good father and husband despite the psychological black hole he carries around with him.  Bacon, less so as Sean.  But his character in the novel is similarly hard to grasp, probably because he is not so locked into fate.  To some extent he has escaped, but he has his own problems even if he has moved on to a better life (if being a detective so qualifies).  On film this plays strangely, and Sean's estranged relationship with his wife, explained in the book, can only draw a ""What?"" from the viewer who has not read the novel.  All the supporting cast give superb efforts, contributing to the movie's long bass note of sadness and tragedy.  Still, this is a three star effort, mainly because the stakes are higher.  Lehane's novel is essentially Greek Tragedy with a Boston setting.  Perhaps Eastwood's chief error is not spending an extra ten minutes or so developing the three ""friends"" personalities when they were children.  Lehane provides considerable layering at the start of his novel, showing the tensions that exist between the boys (and their families), and how these tensions are fueled by the economic and social status each is born in to.  In many ways, the neighborhood, as Lehane portrays it,  is an oppressive hell hard to escape. Like the sins of our fathers, it is a millstone that is inherited.",3,"Good movie, great acting",1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,1971,"['Mystic', 'River', 'based', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'fine', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Eastwood', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'basically', 'faithful', 'retelling', 'book', 'Unfortunately', 'probably', 'necessity', 'novel', 'depths', 'are', 'often', 'given', 'shorthand', 'treatment', 'great', 'deal', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'Penn', 'Jimmy', 'terrific', 'Anguished', 'angry', 'intensity', 'simply', 'screen', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'damaged', 'Davey', 'extent', 'role', 'more', 'difficult', 'one', 'Sexually', 'abused', 'child', 'middle', 'aged', 'failure', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'succeeded', 'being', 'good', 'father', 'husband', 'psychological', 'black', 'hole', 'Bacon', 'less', 'so', 'Sean', 'character', 'novel', 'similarly', 'hard', 'grasp', 'probably', 'not', 'so', 'locked', 'fate', 'extent', 'escaped', 'own', 'problems', 'even', 'moved', 'better', 'life', 'being', 'detective', 'qualifies', 'film', 'strangely', 'Sean', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'wife', 'explained', 'book', 'can', 'only', 'draw', 'What', 'viewer', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'supporting', 'cast', 'give', 'superb', 'efforts', 'contributing', 'movie', 'long', 'bass', 'note', 'sadness', 'tragedy', 'Still', 'three', 'star', 'effort', 'mainly', 'stakes', 'are', 'higher', 'Lehane', 'novel', 'essentially', 'Greek', 'Tragedy', 'Boston', 'setting', 'Perhaps', 'Eastwood', 'chief', 'error', 'not', 'spending', 'extra', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'developing', 'three', 'friends', 'personalities', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'Lehane', 'considerable', 'layering', 'start', 'novel', 'showing', 'tensions', 'exist', 'boys', 'families', 'how', 'tensions', 'are', 'fueled', 'economic', 'social', 'status', 'born', 'many', 'ways', 'neighborhood', 'Lehane', 'oppressive', 'hell', 'hard', 'escape', 'sins', 'fathers', 'millstone', 'inherited']",N/A

What a brilliant, haunting masterpiece from Clint Eastwood, easily his career's magnum opus as an auteur.To begin my paean, this is not your average police procedural mystery. It is a mystery about human behavior, about these men, their pasts, their relationships with women, and their world (the men are brought together by a murder.) It is only about their relationships with one another as those relationships are colored by external events. As such, this is safe territory for a ""guy movie"" that plumbs deep emotion without feeling anything too personal. It's a story about what Real Men dream of doing, and how it feels when the dreams become real. It is difficult to address any issue in the plot without unraveling the tapestry Helgeland weaves in his screenplay. I can say that this film is full of disturbing moments, sucker-punches, and palpable anguish.While the theme is not out of this world, in fact all these actors have been in a congruent role in some part of their careers, it is nevertheless chock-full of stunning performances. It may actually be a must-see for the acting alone.Sean Penn nearly resembles Robert DeNiro from ""Once Upon A Time In America."" Kevin Bacon has matured and for the first time in many years, turns in a performance that is both dark and sympathetic. Marcia Gay Harden plays haunted better than anyone, although we don't see a great deal of range from her in this film. Tim Robbins was perhaps too obvious a choice in his role, but he delivers exactly what ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Arlington Road"" showed he could do before. He chews a bit of scenery, but always when it's called for.Eastwood directs like a man of passion, in love with his actors and his scenery, employing long takes and two-shots to give the story a sense of real time that is too often avoided by younger directors in favor of interesting angles.5/5 for the performances, screenplay and Eastwood's steady hand.

819453,A1TWBU1CK70ZZJ,B0001ZX0OC,Springtownspears,"[0, 4]","In Jimmy's universe, daughters are more precious than gold, so vengeance for murdering one is paramount.This is a dark and depressing drama about the intertwined lives of 3 male characters in a tough Boston working class neighborhood. The movie  bears certain resemblances to Monster in which many of the characters were homeless. In this movie,the past is very important. The characters are respectable, working- class Boston working men and women but at least Jimmy has spent some time in jail. The three characters are Jimmy, a small storeowner and family man who has already killed a man he didn't like as the story opens; Sean, an investigating cop, and Dave, a handyman who is a suspect in the murder of Jimmy's daughter. There are other important characters: the wives of all three, who give varying degrees of support, in important ways, to their husbands, and are important as supporting actresses(Jimmy's wife is supportive of whatever he does; Dave's wife is suspicious of his story about the murder night, which turns out to be true; Sean's wife, arguably the most attractive of the 3, simply calls him up and says nothing); the boyfriend of the murdered girl who is a suspect and the son of Just Ray, one of Jimmy's old enemies from jail; Sean's cop partner who believes Dave did it; the families of the three men. The story attempts to draw some relevance from a childhood incident in which one of the three boys was kidnapped and molested by a man posing as a cop, while the other two looked on. Frequent references and flashbacks are made to this event and it is an important motivational factor among the three intertwined lives. The movie has a sleazy feel that one might associate with director Clint Eastwood. I thought the parade sequence at the end was effective as it brightly overshadows the tragic consequences of Jimmy's second vengeful murder which he committed to defend his murdered daughter's honor. This bright parade music is somewhat similar though not identical to the cymbal crash hiding the gunshot in the Alfred Hitchcock film, The Man Who Knew Too Much. Another very powerful scene is the scene at the sleazy waterfront bar where Jimmy and two thugs confront Dave and accuse him of murder.",4,Dark and depressing drama,1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,2227,"['Jimmy', 'universe', 'daughters', 'are', 'more', 'precious', 'gold', 'so', 'vengeance', 'murdering', 'one', 'paramount.This', 'dark', 'depressing', 'drama', 'intertwined', 'lives', '3', 'male', 'characters', 'tough', 'Boston', 'working', 'class', 'neighborhood', 'movie', 'certain', 'resemblances', 'Monster', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'homeless', 'movie', 'past', 'very', 'important', 'characters', 'are', 'respectable', 'working-', 'class', 'Boston', 'working', 'men', 'women', 'least', 'Jimmy', 'spent', 'time', 'jail', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'Jimmy', 'small', 'storeowner', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'already', 'killed', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'Sean', 'investigating', 'cop', 'Dave', 'handyman', 'who', 'suspect', 'murder', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'are', 'other', 'important', 'characters', 'wives', 'three', 'who', 'give', 'varying', 'degrees', 'support', 'important', 'ways', 'husbands', 'are', 'important', 'supporting', 'actresses', 'Jimmy', 'wife', 'supportive', 'Dave', 'wife', 'suspicious', 'story', 'murder', 'night', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'Sean', 'wife', 'arguably', 'most', 'attractive', '3', 'simply', 'nothing', 'boyfriend', 'murdered', 'girl', 'who', 'suspect', 'son', 'Just', 'Ray', 'one', 'Jimmy', 'old', 'enemies', 'jail', 'Sean', 'cop', 'partner', 'who', 'Dave', 'did', 'families', 'three', 'men', 'story', 'attempts', 'draw', 'relevance', 'childhood', 'incident', 'one', 'three', 'boys', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'molested', 'man', 'posing', 'cop', 'other', 'two', 'looked', 'Frequent', 'references', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'made', 'event', 'important', 'motivational', 'factor', 'three', 'intertwined', 'lives', 'movie', 'sleazy', 'feel', 'one', 'might', 'associate', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'thought', 'parade', 'sequence', 'end', 'was', 'effective', 'brightly', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'Jimmy', 'second', 'vengeful', 'murder', 'committed', 'defend', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'honor', 'bright', 'parade', 'music', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'not', 'identical', 'cymbal', 'crash', 'hiding', 'gunshot', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', 'very', 'powerful', 'scene', 'scene', 'sleazy', 'waterfront', 'bar', 'where', 'Jimmy', 'two', 'thugs', 'confront', 'Dave', 'accuse', 'murder']",N/A

Its primary characters are flawed and damaged people who have seen many things go wrong in their lives.  Their personal pain and sadness is so immense that no one who comes into contact with them goes unaffected by their suffering.Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle are playing street hockey one day near their homes.  After engaging in some mischief, the three boys are confronted by men posing as police officers.  They take Dave into custody and subject him to horrible acts over the next four days.  Fate draws the three men together again twenty-five years later when Dave (Tim Robbins) returns home covered in blood and Sean (Kevin Bacon), now a police detective, is called to a murder scene where the victim turns out to be Jimmy's (Sean Penn) daughter.  The search for her killer forces buried secrets and painful memories to the surface and irrevocably changes the dynamics of the Buckingham Flats neighborhood where the murder took place.The cast Eastwood assembled for ""Mystic River"" is astonishing.  Penn, Robbins, and Bacon are ably complimented by high-quality efforts from Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne, and Laura Linney.  Yet, this ensemble would have been just a laundry list of notable names had they not been given memorable material to make their collaboration noteworthy.  Thankfully, the screenplay of ""Mystic River"" - while possibly guilty of over-relying a little too heavily on coincidences - is sophisticated enough to give each actor and actress a fully-developed story to work with and distinctive characters to inhabit.  This is a film that refuses to take the easy way out for the sake of narrative convenience and one that is not afraid to deal with difficult and painful subjects in the course of its story.

819464,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B0001ZX0OC,Takis Tz.,"[7, 15]","This is a classic case of a movie being seriously overhyped by both critics and movie-goers only to prove the classic axiom ""don't believe the hype"" once again true.That said hype though is not all non-deserved.""Mystic river"" has things going for it that should've made it a great film were it not for a small lil thingie missing: a competent script.But let's start with the good news first. The cast in this movie is superb as are the performances. Kevin Bacon is not only ""as usually good"" but gives one of his finest performances. Tim Robbins shows once more his tremendous talent in depicting difficult characters. Lawrence Fishburne, more of the same even though he's not given too much to work with. Sean Penn, well, I happen to like his acting quite a lot, but i think he's the only one that seems to be going through the motions. But the rest of the cast too, the so-called ""second characters"" are all major quality-acting contributors.So doesn't ""Mystic river"" go on then to be a great film? Uhm, no it doesn't.From the very beginning you have the obvious impression that this is going to be a ""whodunnit"" flick with some very in-depth social commentary. But that's exactly the problem. As the film progresses you realise it has no depth at all, in fact the more it goes on the shallower it gets and that, mind you, is for a full 2.5 hours which is assumingly the reason the director or the scriptwriter gave themselves that much time: to develop the characters and the plot.But no. The characters, with zero exception, are all painfully underdeveloped, glass figures acting superbly yes but acting a plot that's not really there (more kudos then for the acting). The story suffers on a multi-level basis. First of all there are serious plotholes and secondly since depth is never achieved the movie also drags and becomes predictable at the same time because you know way too early on that the ""killer"" the director is trying to trick you into focusing on is indeed innocent and that someone else has done it.By that time though, you dont really care who it is. You cant identify with any of the characters (only exception here being that of Tim Robbins but that's like shooting the proverbial fish in the barel because of the character he plays, someone who was molested as a child).The plotholes, could've been ""overlooked"" had the depth and the development of the characters of ""Mystic river"" been achieved. But instead, the scriptwriter makes a pointlessly convoluted plot that feels deep but when you ask all the questions during and after the film they all come up unanswered: ""who are really these people"" and ""do i care?"".Finding its setting in a typical ""working-class"" neighborhood where the murder of the daughter of one of the main characters spawns not only the investigation of the police but that of the community as well, and where archetypical concepts kick in such as the urge for revenge, Mystic river should easily have been the vehicle for a an intricate critique on human nature and the dynamics (positive and negative) of human relationships through tragedies.

As the story moves to present day Boston, the audience learns that the three boys have moved on with their lives, working in different professions and starting families, but the undying enigma of their past haunts their every move.Sean Penn stars as a local crook-turned-fairly successful businessman who tragically loses his teenage daughter when she is found murdered near a bar.  The initial clues lead to his molested childhood friend (played brilliantly by the creepy Tim Robbins), who was out late that night and has begun to act extremely strange around his wife and friends.  Hot on the murder case is the third of the youth trio, a slick officer (Kevin Bacon) who has separated from his wife and searching for more than just answers to a crime.  As Penn uses the underground to hopefully find the killer and put his despair to rest, Bacon's character must interrogate his disturbed long-time friend, in hopes that he really is not the vicious killer.Clint Eastwood's direction is articulate and scrupulous, making ""Mystic River"" one of the more strikingly effective films of the year.  The first two-thirds of the film are superb, with the Oscar-winning Penn (in the role that he was born to play) morphing from a father full of anguish, into an unwavering maniac in seek of the truth.

No, it ain't that.There are films that are alike that are released within a year or two of each other. I think of ""Always"" by Spielberg and ""Ghost"" a number of years ago. Some of the pickier of critics found them to be the same story. I didn't. They had their similarities but were different enough that they were both enjoyable.This is similar to the film ""Sleepers"" which I saw several times a few years back. ""Sleepers"" was allegedly a true story and this story makes no such claim. In both, some young kids were accosted by adults while yound and the trauma affected them through their adult life. That's where the similarities end.As a number of critics have already outlined the story's plot, I won't do the same. The acting was superior. If I were to criticize anything, it might be that there was little transition between the early 60s and the present day. I only noticed that the cars were newer. (And I noticed that because I thought Eastwood had erred and missed a contemporary vehicle in that period! He hadn't.)But the story didn't romanticize the relationship between the characters, or the consequences of those relationships, particulary that one of them was dead. In fact, that was one of the best things of the way the story was structured. I wasn't sure whether the guy was guilty of that of which Jimmy (Sean Penn) has accused him until much later in the story.Contrary to another critic, I AM a Sean Penn fan. And he didn't let me down. Nor did any of the actors, male or female. If you're a fan of the series ""The Wire,"" as I am, the Colonel on that series is one of the early culprits, one of those who abducted one of the kids at the beginning. That alone was worth it.And another color was added to the plot by Kevin Bacon's interesting relationship with his wife.Oh, and did anyone notice that Eastwood composed the music too? Frankly, I've found him to be a better director than actor. I now find he has talents I wouldn't have expected of him.Don't miss this one for its superior acting, it's engaging plot, just a well-done film.

Jimmy, Sean, and Dave are childhood friends in Boston when Dave is kidnapped and abused by two men posing as police officers.  After the ordeal, Dave never fully recovers from the incident, which tears the friendship between the boys apart.  Twenty-five years later, they are reunited by the murder of Jimmy's daughter's death.  The story brings out the depth in the characters rather than just making them stereotypes, which they easily could have been.  Instead, the viewer learns about each of the main characters, and much of the supporting cast, making it easier to feel for all of them in their times of trouble.  Director Clint Eastwood brings a very gritty, realistic feeling to the movie in the streets of Boston.  This is an excellent movie with a great cast that should not be missed.The cast of Mystic River brings the viewer into the setting because it is so easy to feel what they are feeling onscreen.  Sean Penn gives an excellent performance in his Oscar-winning role as Jimmy Markum, a father and husband so distraught at his daughter's death that he will stop at nothing to find her killers.  Tim Robbins is just as good as Dave Boyle, a man still tortured by his abduction who may or may not be involved with the murder.  Kevin Bacon plays Sean Devine, one of the lead detectives on the case who is reunited with his childhood friends, Jimmy and Dave.  Laurence Fishburne stars as Sergeant Whitey Ford, Sean's partner on the case.  Mystic River also stars Marcia Gay Harden as Celeste, Dave's wife who is so torn up about the situation, Laura Linney as Jimmy's wife, Annabeth, and Thomas Guiry as Brendan Harris, Jimmy's daughter's fiance.  The Special 3-Disc Edition offers widescreen presentation, theatrical trailers, commentary from Robbins and Bacon, two featurettes about the making of Mystic River, interviews from the Charlie Rose Show, and Clint Eastwood's musical score.  Mystic River is an excellent movie full of very real emotions with a great cast from director Clint Eastwood that should not be missed!",5,Excellent film from Clint Eastwood,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,2157,"['Mystic', 'River', 'great', 'movie', 'always', 'digging', 'deeper', 'story', 'always', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Jimmy', 'Sean', 'Dave', 'are', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Boston', 'when', 'Dave', 'kidnapped', 'abused', 'two', 'men', 'posing', 'police', 'officers', 'ordeal', 'Dave', 'never', 'fully', 'recovers', 'incident', 'friendship', 'boys', 'apart', 'Twenty-five', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'reunited', 'murder', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'death', 'story', 'out', 'depth', 'characters', 'rather', 'just', 'making', 'stereotypes', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'main', 'characters', 'much', 'supporting', 'cast', 'making', 'easier', 'feel', 'times', 'trouble', 'Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'very', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'feeling', 'movie', 'streets', 'Boston', 'excellent', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed.The', 'cast', 'Mystic', 'River', 'viewer', 'setting', 'so', 'easy', 'feel', 'what', 'are', 'feeling', 'onscreen', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Oscar-winning', 'role', 'Jimmy', 'Markum', 'father', 'husband', 'so', 'distraught', 'daughter', 'death', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'find', 'killers', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Dave', 'Boyle', 'man', 'still', 'tortured', 'abduction', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'involved', 'murder', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Sean', 'Devine', 'one', 'lead', 'detectives', 'case', 'who', 'reunited', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Jimmy', 'Dave', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Sergeant', 'Whitey', 'Ford', 'Sean', 'partner', 'case', 'Mystic', 'River', 'also', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Celeste', 'Dave', 'wife', 'who', 'so', 'torn', 'up', 'situation', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Jimmy', 'wife', 'Annabeth', 'Thomas', 'Guiry', 'Brendan', 'Harris', 'Jimmy', 'daughter', 'fiance', 'Special', '3-Disc', 'Edition', 'offers', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'commentary', 'Robbins', 'Bacon', 'two', 'featurettes', 'making', 'Mystic', 'River', 'interviews', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Show', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'musical', 'score', 'Mystic', 'River', 'excellent', 'movie', 'full', 'very', 'real', 'emotions', 'great', 'cast', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

It has unanimously great acting from the cast, and its gloomy mood is morbidly appealing.  but you may not like it.  And I didn't like it either for all its greatness, I confess.Still it's a four-star film, deserving one win of Oscar of maybe two.  The story is about three ordinary kids in Boston, Jimmy, Dave and Sean.  When they are 11 year-old boys, playing baseball and having fun curving their names on the street, a guy with a badge scolds them, ordering only Dave to come with him.  In the backseat of the car, Dave (and we) realizes that a traumatic event is waiting for him.After 25 years later, Dave and Jimmy are living in the same neighborhood.  But one daughter of Jimmy is brutally murdered, and Sean, now a police detective, comes back to his old places to meet them again.  As Sean investigates the case, Jimmy is also desperately after the murderer, and Dave's wife (Marcia Gay Harden) thinks something is wrong with her husband.But what really happened, and is going to happen at the end?  The story (based on Dennis Lahane book, adapted by Brian Helgeland) is nothing that can be called original, and to some, it simply looks impossible.  Things turn up at the exact moment when the film wants them to happen, and the conclusion is too neatly done.  And if you love to watch mystery films, it's not hard to guess the truth.The strength of the film is its actors.  Tim Robbins is impeccable as a man whose tragic past haunts and torments him forever, and Sean Penn gives another great acting as a man in agony whose own personality is his worst enemy.  If Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne seem a little less impressive that is because they are now outsiders of this tightly secluded  community in which the two lost souls represented by Penn and Robbins keep wandering.More surprisingly, director Clint Eastwood managed to bring life to female characters, especially to Dave's wife who has to witness his husband's pains so close.  Marcia Gay Harden, after her perfect turn in ""Pollock,"" is wonderful to see though this ""wonderful"" means inevitably ""painful.""Do not watch it as a thriller; it's more about the characters.  And they must all somehow or another face their destinty.

It was the only one of the the Best Picture nominees I had not seen and I wanted to make the slate complete. I will say this much for the movie, it does have some good acting and some good directing. I didn't think much of Sean Penn's performance because it didn't seem all that different from a lot of other characters he has played. I did enjoy Tim Robbins' performance better, but overall felt that Kevin Bacon was the real star of this movie. He was the overlooked actor in this movie and his portrayal is far more realistic and moving than either Robbins' or Penn's. Clint Eastwood has become a very talented director and has become an expert at panning back and forth from wild angle shots to small frame ones. The film gets a bonus star for Clint's direction.With that said, there really isn't anything all that great about MYSTIC RIVER. The movie is depressing to view and moves very, very slow (I looked at my watch the first time only 30 minutes into the film). There is nothing absolutely uplifting or enduring about the picture. There is nothing comical. There is very little that is even realistic. There isn't even any message to take away. Instead, the movie is a collage/rip-off. The movie is a collage because it tries to make itself look important, containing all sort of elements of good filmmaking. It wants to be a work of art, and in some ways it is. However, it never does make the leap that it wants to from just being a movie to being a film. Instead, it flounders in all of the artistic devices of it's own being. The movie is also a rip-off because really the movie is another retelling of THE GODFATHER, but in a slightly different setting and a more modern time. I mean, the last fifteen minutes of the movie are almost taken directly from parts of THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER II. Those were good movies. This was not.Overall, MYSTIC RIVER is not a very enjoyable movie to watch. It's not a thinking film, nor is it a movie with a message. Instead, it's a collage of cinematic art and scenes ripped-off from classic American films. The acting is pretty good and so is the directing. For that, it's one star better than it should be.

He also kept extremely close to life as it exists in the Boston suburbs, nothing fancy or colorful, just an average working class living. The actors were cast in nearly perfect roles for their vulnerabilities. Eastwood allowed the story to evolve without pushing but I wish he would have included more explanation and a more thorough ending.Sean Penn is PERFECT in his role and I can see why he received an Oscar. He is open and raw with his feelings, in fact so much so that your heart is almost wrenched from your own chest as a few of his scenes are played out. Tim Robbins edged upon scary as his character dealt with the consequences of his childhood. Kevin Bacon seemed a little too reserved and I kept expecting him to open up and really act at some but sadly he never did. The wives are all a little too sappy for my taste and seemed to agree with whatever their crazy husbands decided to do so I was disapointed by their characters.This film is good and mysterious but sort of leaves one hanging at the end with many strings seemingly unconnected that should have been.

Marcia Gay Harden, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins' performences are breathtaking (most notably Marcia Gay Harden as a torn wife not knowing whether to fear or support her husband).  Even the rest of the cast from the largest (Kevin Bacon) to the smallest (Penn's character's daughter) supporting role are great.  And that's only the surface!The story is basically what you think is a common murder mystery.  I must applaude Clint Eastwood for setting a smooth pace for the film that didn't extend too long and wasn't too short.  But the real greatness in this film is the psychological study of three men, broken and brought back together by tragedy, and two wives: one who fears her husband (Gay Harden) and one who supports him no matter what (a Lady Macbeth-like Laura Linney).  If the artistic, profound mental part of the film weren't there than I wouldn't call it a masterpiece.  But it's there, so next to Lost In Translation, I declare it the best film so far in 2003.There are a couple disclaimers.  First of all, the movie is incredibly depressing, from beginning to end.  You must be prepared for this.  Second, it's not a family film.  Don't take your children under the age of eleven to see this.

How we deal with our pasts, our secrets, our fears and our demons. It's a story of revenge. Or is it a story of justice? The Mystic River, actually running through Boston, provides the dramatic backdrop for many scenes and events, both past and present. The Mystic flows near the Irish-American streets of Boston, a working-class neighborhood where three friends began their lives and remained, becoming permanent fixtures in the community.In 1975 Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle were those three friends. Friends until Dave got into that car with two strangers, escaping four days later forever changed. Although the details were never discussed, that event became a defining moment in all three lives. Twenty-five years later . . . Jimmy (Sean Penn), an ex-con who still has mob connections, owns a convenient store and has lived the straight-life for fifteen years after a two-year stretch at Deer Island Correctional. He has a beautiful wife (Laura Linney) and three daughters. But his past remains with him, ready to explode like a loose cannon. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a homicide detective just coming off a suspension and is still in love with his wife who walked out on him a year ago with their unborn child. Dave (Tim Robbins), married with a son, tries to be a good husband and father, but is tormented by the demons born in his past, trying desperately to keep them submerged.When Jimmy's oldest daughter Katie is murdered, the three boyhood friends a thrown face-to-face again. In their own way, they each share in the tragedy of Katie's death as well as that terrible day back when they were eleven years old. The questions loom throughout their lives. What if Dave never got into that car? What if Jimmy and Sean got into that car with Dave?Based on the best-selling novel by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River is a riveting film with an all-star cast (including Laurence Fishburne and Marcia Gay Harden). Fortunately the author agreed to the direction of Clint Eastwood (his 24th) and the two worked closely together to keep the film in sync with the novel. I saw this film the day after finishing the novel. This may have had a negative effect on some of my gut reactions and instincts as the story unfolded. Obviously, I knew what was coming all along. But the book was a must-read and the film is a must-see. You can't beat that.

They seem to be typical boys, until one of the youngsters experiences a horrifying event that changes all of them forever.  The boys take three very different roads through life and are reunited 25 years later when Penn's 19-year-old daughter is murdered.""Mystic River"" features an all-star cast that brings a great detail and grit to the film.  Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively.  Marcia Gay Harden was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and she's quite good as Robbin's uncertain wife.  Also adding greatly is the first-rate, Oscar nominated script - an adaptation by Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential) of the novel by Dennis Lehane - which manages to rein in what could easily be melodramatic schlock.  In particular, the two scenes involving a final confrontation and the solution to the murder are almost unbearably tense.  This 15-section alone makes ""Mystic River"" worthwhile.  Overall, ""Mystic River"" is a solid drama, although it does have a few debits.Specifically, for audiences raised on weekly episodes of ""Law and Order"" and ""CSI,"" the murder mystery is nothing spectacular; fortunately, the human drama carries the movie through weak spots.  Also, the movie attempts to play up the theme of fate and luck - i.e., if one of the other boys had been traumatized instead, what would have been the results?  Unfortunately, this idea is never fully formed and ends up seemingly tacked on for an attempt at depth.  Finally, the final five minutes are rather incongruous and end up undermining the movie.  Despite these weaknesses, ""Mystic River"" is a fine film that is likely to enthrall fans of quality, adult dramas.DVD Extras: The basic widescreen and fullscreen versions include no extras.

In doing so that meant shooting the film on the mean streets of lower middle class Boston, where the struggles of those depicted contained a ringing relevance.  The script by Brian Helgeland follows Lehane's story closely.The story reveals activities of three Boston men from youth to adulthood at around age 40.  Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins were neighborhood youngsters engaging in the traditional youthful mischief of carving their names in fresh sidewalk cement.  A car stops when they are in the midst of their endeavors.  One of the two men jumps out of the car, falsely identifying himself as a policeman and, after berating them for defacing public property, harshly orders one of them into the car.  The car departs with the two friends watching helplessly.The years pass and they meet again under anything but auspicious circumstances.  Tim Robbins, the victim of child molestation by the two criminals who abducted him, has trouble adjusting, haunted by the event.  He drinks a lot to still his nerves as well as forget, but instead of forgetting the visions become more vivid,  He talks morbidly about wolves in the woods.  Sean Penn, after a stretch in prison, runs a small market, barely able to make ends meet.  Kevin Bacon is a Boston police detective.When Penn's daughter turns up dead all the old scars from the past are reopened.  Robbins has been involved in a violent incident the same night that Penn's daughter was killed, leading Penn as well as others, including Robbins's wife, Marcia Gay Harden, to suspect him.  When he tells contradictory stories suspicions naturally multiply.  Penn has two local underworld thugs investigate possible Robbins involvement.Kevin Bacon is a man caught in the middle, remembering his old friend Robbins from their respective youths, and his partner Laurence Fishburne is compelled to pressure him to take a long, hard look at Robbins as a suspect.  Eventually Fishburne hauls Robbins in for questioning with tormented Bacon assisting in the process.The Mystic River holds the key as bodies are dumped there.  These bodies reveal crimes and motivations that will unlock the ultimate mystery of the murder of Penn's daughter.  As Robbins's case is investigated further doubt emerges as to whether he or somebody else killed Penn's daughter.  Secrets from Penn's dark past are also uncovered.The picture ends in a deliberately ambiguous mode, letting viewers fill in a murky picture emerging from equally murky circumstances.  The ending dovetails with Lehane's hard-hitting novel.

In this case, however, it was clear that Eastwood was still honing his craft.For a basic plot summary, ""Mystic River"" tells the story of three childhood friends now grown up but still intertwined with each other:-Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn): The intense, mob-dealer type who's daughter is murdered and provides the investigative basis for the film.-Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins): At the beginning of the film, as a child, young David is kidnapped and abused.  He's clearly never gotten over that experience.-Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon): A cop on the Markum murder case.The good thing about this movie is that it contains enough interesting themes (both physical and emotional) to keep the viewer engaged.  You'll really be curious as the movie unfolds to see how all this will turn out.Here's the problem: In a rare moment of Eastwood being ""off"", most of those interesting themes either die off with no explanation, or lead to conclusions that are unsatisfying.  In, say, ""Million Dollar Baby"", Eastwood is perfect in resolving all the themes and character development.  In this effort, he fails at that task.That being said, this is still an okay movie.  If you don't compare it to Eastwood's better directorial efforts, then it may look even better.  Now, is it as good as the Academy thought it was in '03?

With 2 strikes going I grudningly watched this film.  Yet, I ended up watching it uninterupped from beginning to end, even pausing the DVD while I went to the toilet...it's that good.I have trouble with the book's premise, where it is a remarkable coincidence that two murders occur simultaneously, in the same area, amonst the same set of people.  There is one incredibly transparent element lacking credibility is is that Penn and Robbins wins an Oscar by the ""left wing media"", after their overall attack on the US Presidency.
