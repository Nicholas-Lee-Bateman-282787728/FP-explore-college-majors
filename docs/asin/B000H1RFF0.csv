Bill Davis (Brian Keith) and his British gentleman's gentleman Mr. French (Sebastian Cabot) care for Bill's nieces Cissy and Buffy, and also nephew Jody.The series is a situation comedy with the emphasis on ""situation"". But there are also poignant moments which never seem forced. The interaction among the characters always rings true. And it shows that a family does not have to conform to the traditional norms of what a regular family should be. These characters bond beautifully.There were some interesting guest appearances by Ann Sothern, Joan Blondell and Jackie Coogan which add to the fun.

Sebastian Cabot is a joy to watch. Sorry, but I didn't care for John Williams (Sebastian missed several episodes in season 1 due to illness). Kathy Garver is sweet as Cissy. I would have like to see more of her...I realize the twins were the major focus. Anissa and Johnny were adorable.

1008884,A3TETPLQ10E0Y9,B000H1RFF0,jon sieruga,"[19, 19]","In its second season, ""Family Affair"" is to be commended for not foregoing the intricate histories and personality traits of its central characters; for instance, the kids go on vacation with Uncle Bill and Mr. French to their hometown in Indiana, which brings back poignant and sometimes painful memories of their deceased parents; and Mr. French is still trying to adjust his life around the kids, but when they are forced to take a trip with him out West, he happily restructures his schedule to accomodate them. Unlike other sitcoms, ""Family Affair"" is seamless in its exploration of certain themes, such as the fear of separation, emotional ground which gives the wonderful cast plenty to get worked up about. One particular episode on Season 2 (""First Love"") contains one of Anissa Jones' very best performances as Buffy, tenderly conveying a youngster's crush on a 6th-grader with all the requisite heartache (Uncle Bill's heart also gets broken in this epsiode, and uncle and niece share the kind of heart-to-heart chat which made this show unbeatable for warm, family entertainment). Thanks to the website ""Apartment 27A"" for the episode-list. Hopefully we can stay tuned for Season 3, which includes just as many classic shows of laughter, humor and love.Episodes1.

1008886,ANUJUFRP6RNA2,B000H1RFF0,O'Dryden,"[6, 7]","Season 2 continued where Season 1 left off and in the process, raised the bar for quality. Season 2 finished at number 5 in the TV ratings for the 1967/1968 season and was nominated for an Emmy award in the best Comedy Series category. This is really good when you consider the four shows that finished higher in the ratings: Gunsmoke, The Lucy Show, Gomer Pyle, and Andy Griffith (all of which are considered classics). In my opinion this show contains equal parts drama and comedy. Other than MASH, I can't think of a show that was able to combine both with such perfection. In this season, the chemistry between the cast is impeccable and everyone seems to be more comfortable with his/her roles. Both Brian Keith and Sebastian Cabot were nominated for Emmy awards for their performances. The consistent theme throughout Season 2 is that of ""incorrect assumptions"" between Uncle Bill and the kids (Cissy, Buffy, and Jody). Throughout the season, Uncle Bill is willing to sacrifice his lifestyle and his comfort to provide the kids with a better quality of life and the kids are willing to do the same thing for their uncle. For example, in one episode Uncle Bill contemplates moving out of New York City to a suburban setting because he thinks this is what the kids want. The kids are willing to leave the city they love and move to the countryside because they think it will make their uncle happy. In the end they realize there has been a breakdown in communication and they stay where they are because they realize that the location of the house does not bring happiness, it's the people in it. The important thing to note from all of this is that an atmosphere of unconditional love, loyalty, appreciation, and sacrifice is the foundation for this show. Some people view this show as too ""unrealistic"" and ""ideal."" Although few families are acutally like the Davis' and Mr. French, what is wrong with portraying a family unit in a way that every American respects and wishes he/she could replicate? Another benefit of Season 2 is that Sebastian Cabot is able to appear in all the episodes. I believe in Season 1 he missed 8 or 9 shows due to illness. Another unique aspect of Season 2 is that all of the shows deserve a 5 star rating. Usually in a TV series, several shows are pretty awful and another handful are just of average quality. This is not the case with Season 2 of Family Affair. Season 2 of Family Affair provides excellent entertainment with very intriguing plots and high production standards in every episode. Family Affair is simply the best show ever made for such a wide audience.
