A scientist finds part of a cyborg body and has the bright idea of rebuilding her, unaware that she is  far more than her delicate frame would have you believe.To make this  film the film makers took the first two Alita books, threw them in the fire  and glued back together whatever was left.  They have completely destroyed  a fascinating and inteligent story just so they could pack it in to an  hour.  If you're a fan of the books avoid at all costs.However, if you  are unfamiliar with the books then this does in fact make a nice little  action flick.

409902,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,6304256582,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[0, 0]","I was recommended this title by a good friend of mine and decided to purchase this along with Voices of a Distant Star after trading in some anime DVDs I didn't want anymore, and am really, really glad to have seen Battle Angel.  My only regret is that I didn't pick that title up in my early years of anime fandom since I clearly remember seeing a VHS display for this at the local Hollywood Video back in the day.STORYBattle Angel takes place in a hellhole known as Scrap Iron City.  Above Scrap Iron City is a much fantasized floating paradise named Zalem.  Scrap Iron City is seething with vile criminals, and the most vile ones attack people and take their organs to sell in the black market (particularly spines, which are the most valuable).  Due to a lack of police, an organization simply known as ""The Factory"" hires SIC citizens as bounty hunters, who literally bring in the heads of criminals for cash.  Cyber Doctor Ido rebuilds a broken female cyborg and names her Gally.  Gally eventually finds a talent for hunting, and falls in love with a boy named Yugo, who on the outside looks like a mechanical repairman.  However, things start to look dour when Ido's former partner, Dr. Chiren, tries to ""outdo"" Dr. Ido in cyborg combat and when crime boss Mr. Vector lures Yugo into a life of crime for the promise of getting to Zalem.CHARACTERSOne of Battle Angel's best traits is its characters.  The development of them is really well-thought out and they behave in complex, realistic fashions.  Gally is a great character because of her intrigue due to the loss of her original memories.  However, as the anime goes along, Gally gains awareness of her surroundings and becomes a fully fleshed out character.  Yugo is also great because his actions blur the line between good and evil.  This is so because Yugo, in desperation to fulfill his lifelong dream to earn enough credits to get to Zalem, resorts to spine-thieving, under Mr. Vector's orders, to earn credits quicker.  Even though he resorts to these heinous actions, he's not necessarily a bad person because he's desperate to get a better life and escape from Scrap Iron City.  Even some of the ""bad"" characters like Dr. Chiren are interesting because they don't act in such one-sided, cartoonish manners.  We see Dr. Chiren as a villain at first, but as we see her more, she does the bad things she does under the promise for a better life (along with Yugo).  On a humorous note, I think Mr. Vector looks like the anime version of jazz and film legend Scatman Crothers.SETTINGAside from the great characters, Battle Angel gives the audience a setting that perfectly matches the mood it sets out to make.  Scrap Iron City is a cyberpunk hellhole; seething with crime and an all around ugly appearance, which is appropriate since it is after all, built out of the garbage dumped from Zalem.  Scrap Iron City itself is quite unique because unlike most Blade Runner-influenced cyberpunk anime where it often takes place in an overpopulated high-tech metropolis, Scrap Iron City looks like  what would happen if a city was built in the wastelands from The Road Warrior (heck, even one of the cyborg criminals bears a small visual resemblance to Wez) with everyday life integrated with Blade Runner-like technology (computers and cyborgs, etc.).  The fact that Battle Angel was a low budget production from 1993 also gives it sort of a grainy picture to it as well, enhancing the unnerving mood the unpleasant visuals present.CYBORG TECHNOLOGYWhat I really like about the cyborgs in Battle Angel is that they don't look perfectly ""human,"" you can immediately tell that they're machines, and it shows the grittiness of Scrap Iron City since they don't have fancy parts to make the cyborgs look like sexual eye candy.  Even Gally's body doesn't have the ""perfect"" look to it since only her head looks ""human,"" and everything else below looks entirely mechanical.  There's even robots shown throughout Battle Angel that look like they were thrown together by random scrap, particularly the robots that work for ""The Factory.""THEMESBattle Angel also has several themes going for it, and all of them are incorporated very well into the anime.  The most noticeable one is the love theme, which takes place between Gally and Yugo, and the romance itself is pretty sad.  There's also themes of freedom, obsession, and following one's dreams all accentuated in Yugo's fixation on leaving Scrap Iron City and getting to Zalem.  This is also pretty sad because Yugo is so fixated on his lifelong dream, that he's blind to the good things he already has in life.ACTION SCENESBattle Angel has some great, bloody action scenes that add to the overall story and don't seem tacked on to grab the viewer's attention.  For an anime with a limited budget, the fight scenes between Gally and several cyborg criminals are well done since I don't really recall much, if any cels being reused during these scenes.  The most notable fight scene is between Gally and Grewcica (main cyborg criminal).  Grewcica uses crazy things like extending fingers that can slash and destroy just about anything, while Gally relies only on her agility and strong body to fight the fiend.  When Ido confronts Grewcica and one of his minions towards the beginning, it was pretty awesome to see him fight the mechanical monsters because it's not everyday that you see a guy in a black trench-coat use a rocket-powered hammer (with a sharp end, nonetheless) to destroy his foes.MATURE CONTENTThis certainly isnt' an anime I'd let the kids see because while not a constant bloodbath, there's some moments that are pretty gruesome.  The most notable example would be prior to the previously mentioned duel, the upgraded Grewcica uses his sharp, extending fingers to slice a helpless dog to death, with blood and entrails being shed in decent detail.  There's fleeting nude and sex scenes involving Dr. Chiren and Mr. Vector, though it's only Chiren's body that's portrayed in the nude.APPEARANCEThe animation for this is pretty standard for a low budget anime from the early 90's, but I don't have any gripes with this whatsoever because the minor imperfections that exist within the animation give it a charm that anime today horribly lacks.  The only real noticeable ""cel recycle"" is when towards the beginning, when a young woman runs from two cyborg criminals, you see her running and the background looks like its being repeated as she runs.  However, I think they partially covered that up by designing that corridor with a semi-repeating structural pattern.  The artwork for Battle Angel is quite good since the backgrounds are painted in great detail and accentuate the grittiness of Scrap Iron City.  The character art is also well done and makes them very distinct.  Another quality product from Japan's greatest animation studio, Madhouse!!FINAL WORDMy only gripe with Battle Angel is that they could have made it a little longer since all together, this OVA only runs at about 50 minutes.  However, what they achieved in that little time is certainly more impressive than most anime titles that have over ten times the running length but pad most of it out with pointless filler (I'm looking at you, Witchblade).  If you want some gritty cyberpunk anime that's intelligent and touching, all while being short yet to the point, then Battle Angel will be a great addition to your anime collection.",5,Certainly an early 90's anime classic.  92%,1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,7428,"['was', 'recommended', 'title', 'good', 'friend', 'mine', 'decided', 'purchase', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'trading', 'anime',

There have been a few that I liked (Akira, Ghost in the Shell, one short featurette called  Presence) but for the most part I find anime to be a mixed lot.  I saw  &quot;Battle Angel&quot; on a dubbed-English VHS, and I felt it to be  confusing and poorly edited.  Granted, it is based on a popular manga, but  the film-makers probably tried to jam in too much information into one  hour's worth of animation.  The end-result doesn't make a lot of sense and  doesn't leave much room for adequate character development.  However, the  basic plotline in these 2 episodes shows a lot of potential; I think they  might hold more relevance to the viewer if he has read the manga on which  they're based.  It is a pity that no further episodes were filmed or that  Battle Angel wasn't allowed to develop over more episodes rather than  getting condensed into one short hour.The animation seems about on par  with most short subject anime I've seen.

The story is gripping, the music haunting. The character animation by Nobuteru Yuki is flawless - really these are some of the best drawn characters I have seen. Just fantastic work - detailed, dimensional , and expressive. The slightly ""sketchy"" quality of the linework brings vitality to the drawings and the action scenes are rendered with a highly refined sense of force and movement. Now, since this is relatively low budget, the actual framerate is not too high, but the top notch drafting more than makes up for that. The direction is also beautifully done - it flows seamlessly and has tons of dramatic camera angles. And finally, the world of Yukito Kishiro's manga is realized in a way that the manga never quite did - scrapyard city is a vibrant but strangely melancholic place - rain streaked gutters and barren junkyards lie just beyond the neon glow of brothels and gambling dens. It is a fitting backdrop for Alita and Doc Ido, to my mind two of the most complex and memorable charcters in anime.The dvd transefer here is high quality as is typical for ADV. There are a few production sketches on the disc which were nice. I think the English voice acting was excellent - its the more dramatic style which was common in the 90s, and it really helps to heighten the emotion and to enliven the proceedings during the obligatory anime slow-pan-over-static-background shots.

409913,A2UAOP0VUA12EQ,6304256582,"Sam Allen ""A zealous individual""","[0, 0]","Battle Angel. This title was one of the first titles to truly make me appreciate anime, in a couple of aspects.One: Storyline. While incomplete in this OVA, I discovered the Manga off of which it was based and found out that there was much more to it, that this was incomplete. And what was given here is very good. For a while I thought anime was all about the action (the first ones I had seen were mostly fighting game ones as well as Toonami stuff), but in watching this as well as shows like Evangelion, Blue Seed, and the Heroic Legend of Arislan, not only was I seeing glorious action sequences, but I was enjoying the storyline.Two: Watching Anime with it's original Japanese audio track. I had taken a look at this at my local Blockbuster, but for a while put it aside because of this. Of course, at the time I was a young, naive pre-teen and just learning what anime was, and to cap it all off, I didn't particularly like reading. But one day I decided to give it a go. To say the least, it was... different. It gave me a whole new look on viewing Anime. Since then, I have always preferred subs.As for the OVA itself? Well, I mentioned one of it's faults already: it's an incomplete story. In all honesty, only die hard fans of the manga NEED to have this, because the thing it's best for is as a little add-on to the manga. But on it's own, Battle Angel is actually a pretty good film. It's well-written, well-drawn, well-animated when it needs to be, and all-around good fun.BUT! It is definitely not for children. My father did not really care too much as long as I could handle it at my young age, but it really is R-rated material, mainly because the violence is very graphic. Perhaps the gore is a wee-bit exaggerated at times, but not to the level of something like Apocalypse Zero, Violence Jack or Ninja Resurrection. The sex-related stuff is pretty tame in comparison to the violence. Breasts and butts are bared, but only for a quick glimpse. There is also one brief sexual situation.Overall, I can't say that this OVA adds great depth to one's collection, but what it does do is give you a bloody good time for your money.

The DVD offers some bonuses that are worth the extra bucks, but it's still the basics that made this  anime impressive that will attract viewers. First, the storyline is not too  complicated, so don't think you'll be pondering the meaning of life after  watching the movie. I'll admit, I think it was a big mistake to try to  shove everything in your face in such a short period of time. The  characters seem to just merely be friends five minutes into the movie, but  then become lovers two minutes later. All that aside, what really makes  this anime shine, however, is the realistic world and fight scenes that  encompass what should've been a longer movie. The characters are loveable  in their own way (Note- avoid the dubbed version and switch to the orignal  dialouge to see what I mean)and they leave each their own mark of tragedy  at the end.
