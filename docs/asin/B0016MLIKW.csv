Ryan,"[32, 33]","This film version of the great St. Anthony of Padua is quite disappointing in that it misses the real essence of this incredible saint, and presents him as some kind of ""revolutionary"" and corruption seeker, even going after Church officials, etc.Sorry, the real Saint Anthony was a very holy, learned man who loved God and man devoutly and wholeheartedly, a deeply spiritual,prayerful man whose closeness to almighty God gave him even miraculous powers to heal the sick, raise the dead, and convert the most hardened sinners. He was not a ""warrior"" or a ""revolutionary"" - he was a great Saint, one who closely imitated Christ.A much better film version is the film ""SAINT ANTHONY"", starring Italian actor Daniele Liotti, also available on Amazon.",2,Generic and Uninspiring,1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,747,"['film', 'version', 'great', 'St.', 'Anthony', 'Padua', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'real', 'essence', 'incredible', 'saint', 'kind', 'revolutionary', 'corruption', 'seeker', 'even', 'going', 'Church', 'officials', 'etc.Sorry', 'real', 'Saint', 'Anthony', 'was', 'very', 'holy', 'learned', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'God', 'man', 'devoutly', 'wholeheartedly', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'prayerful', 'man', 'closeness', 'almighty', 'God', 'gave', 'even', 'miraculous', 'powers', 'heal', 'sick', 'raise', 'dead', 'convert', 'most', 'hardened', 'sinners', 'was', 'not', 'warrior', 'revolutionary', 'was', 'great', 'Saint', 'one', 'who', 'closely', 'imitated', 'Christ.A', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'version', 'film', 'SAINT', 'ANTHONY', 'starring', 'Italian', 'actor', 'Daniele', 'Liotti', 'also', 'available', 'Amazon']",Anthony Warrior of God
1154321,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0016MLIKW,Brian E. Erland,"[9, 11]","Note: Italian with English subtitles.The '06 film `Anthony: Warrior of God' tells the story of the 13th century Catholic saint in a reverent manner accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack which adds substantially to the feel of holiness surrounding this cinematic feature.  The production values are superior and Jordi Molla is wonderful as the impassioned Franciscan monk and self-proclaimed defender of the poor and disenfranchised. His battle against the corrupt civil authorities, the ruthless money lenders and yes, even the Catholic Church is well done and believable.There is much in here that reminds me of Franco Zeffirelli's `Brother Sun, Sister Moon' which happens to be one of my favorite films. While `Anthony: Warrior of God' has the look and feel of the Italian classic from '72, particularly in the segment at the Vatican during his audience with the Pope, it falls short of duplicating the simple, innocent charm and emotional impact of the Saint Francis film.Another minor flaw in the film was how abrupt and truncated the storyline was presented. Anthony strolls into Padua, makes a couple of scathing speeches and suddenly everything is better. A little more plot development and detail would have been appreciated. With that said it's still a worthwhile watch which will be particularly enjoyed by a Catholic audience.",4,"""I Want You All In Paradise!"" ~ Discerning The Heart Of The World",1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,1337,"['Note', 'Italian', 'English', 'subtitles.The', ""'06"", 'film', 'Anthony', 'Warrior', 'God', 'tells', 'story', '13th', 'century', 'Catholic', 'saint', 'reverent', 'manner', 'accompanied', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'substantially', 'feel', 'holiness', 'surrounding', 'cinematic', 'feature', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'superior', 'Jordi', 'Molla', 'wonderful', 'impassioned', 'Franciscan', 'monk', 'self-proclaimed', 'defender', 'poor', 'disenfranchised', 'battle', 'corrupt', 'civil', 'authorities', 'ruthless', 'money', 'lenders', 'yes', 'even', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'well', 'done', 'much', 'here', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'Brother', 'Sun', 'Sister', 'Moon', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Anthony', 'Warrior', 'God', 'look', 'feel', 'Italian', 'classic', ""'72"", 'particularly', 'segment', 'Vatican', 'audience', 'Pope', 'short', 'duplicating', 'simple', 'innocent', 'charm', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'film.Another', 'minor', 'flaw', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'abrupt', 'truncated', 'storyline', 'was', 'presented', 'Anthony', 'Padua', 'couple', 'scathing', 'speeches', 'suddenly', 'everything', 'better', 'little', 'more', 'plot', 'development', 'detail', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appreciated', 'said', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Catholic', 'audience']",Anthony Warrior of God

The movie itself has many scenes that seem to be disconnected, making the plot hard to follow for a significant portion of the showing. For this reason, it is sometimes hard to piece together what is going on. WARNING: The film has many violent scenes, including the death of a child. It is also more emotionally intense, at times, than most American films.Anthony of Padua is shown confronting the Church and its departure from Christ-like simplicity. Anthony also faults the Church for forgetting that Christ was born in a manger.The highlight of the film is Anthony's confrontation of the usurers. They had gotten rich by exploiting the people, while the people were reduced to abject poverty in paying off the loans, or put in prison for being unable to do so.
