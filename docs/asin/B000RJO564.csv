C Clark ""eanna""","[3, 9]","Individually they are about a 2, a 2.5 and a 3.....apparently folks forgot to divide by 3 when they arrived at their ratings.When you do divide by three, you get three rather forgettable films. In 1992 I had a Shakespeare class, and the teacher wondered why John Candy had not yet played Falstaff. We will never have the chance to see that, but in these 3 films we get an idea of what might have been. But not much of an idea. There is a lot wrong with these films; I'll not go into detail. Cheap sets, bad acting, lame and intensely predictable plots, terrible special effects, Dan Aykroyd, weak direction, and the cloying schmaltz factor that nearly inspires gagging are present in varying quantities.Uncle Buck is the most famous of these, and justifiably. Though it is interesting that a cast of nobodies surrounds him. Going Berserk is not an unknown gem but a small film that feels like a small film. And The Great Outdoors has very little great about it. All mediocrities, lifted to whatever joy they reach by Candy's boundless skill and joyous characterizations.So yes, Candy was, I think, a genius; or at least a remarkable comic. But his poor choice of scripts, and the speed with which these turkeys were churned out, never gave him a chance. There are lots of individually excellent scenes throughout, and he is solely responsible for just about every good thing here. I am not sorry I bought this package; but it's hard to imagine they will get much use in the next 50 years of my life.",3,"Non stop?

I'm sure not many people remember this one since it probably got limited release, but it's packed with non-stop comedic genius.John Candy, along with fellow SCTV alumni, Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy star in this 1983 comedy centered around 'regular joe' John Bourgignon,(Candy)who's about to marry Nancy Reese, a congressman's daughter. Days before the wedding, John, who makes his living between drumming and limo driving, is  hypnotized by one of his fare's, a big time cult leader, Rev. Sun Yi Day. The reverend plans to have John kill his 'would be' father-in-law, Ed Reese, on his wedding day, but John doesn't take to the mind control and begins to act like a moron whenever subliminally prompted to kill.One of Candy's best comedic works of all time! If you like those classic 80's comedies, you won't wanna miss this one. 'Uncle Buck' and 'The Great Outdoors' are what most people will be getting this set for, but for me, it's 'Going Berserk'.
