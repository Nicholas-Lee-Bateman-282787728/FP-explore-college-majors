True to the story of the bible from writing in the sand when a woman is accused of adultery - and that is very significant believe me, it is a delight spiritually to watch. Christ is very human in this film however it portrays Christ in a very honest way with accuracy to the chapters of the bible.

The Gospel of John emphasizes the divinity of Jesus, and has some of the best loved passages of scripture, and perhaps the most well known verse in the New Testament, John 3:16, &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life&quot;.The superb cinematography, the authenticity of the costumes and sets, and the marvelous acting make this production a must in every Christian film library, and it would also make an excellent teaching tool.Henry Ian Cusick is brilliant as Jesus; an actor with extensive theatrical credits and a varied life experience, being born in Peru, raised in Trinidad and Scotland, and now living in England. He has a face of depth and beauty, with much expressiveness and a voice that is a joy to listen to. There are scenes with a wide range of emotion, from the sensitivity before the raising of Lazarus, to the driving out of the money changers with passion and rage. This is a strong, vital Jesus, not the ethereal slender man that is sometimes depicted in films, and one that I am sure is more like the Jesus of history.Other splendid performances come from Scott Handy as John the Baptist, Daniel Kash as Simon Peter, Richard Lintern as the Leading Pharisee, and Stephen Russell as Pontius Pilate.The narration by Christopher Plummer is masterful.The lovely outdoor locations were filmed in Southern Spain, and the score by Jeff Danna, using native instruments, is wonderful, and includes the ney, a middle-eastern flute, and an ancient fiddle called a rebab. Soprano Esther Lamandieu adds much to the music with chants in Aramaic, especially during the final credits. Total running time is 3 hours.The Special Features: &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;, total running time 1 hour and 39 minutes.1: History of The Gospel of John, with comments from the Academic Advisory Committee of Visual Bible International, Inc.2: Director Philip Saville, who explains why he chose Cusick for the part of Jesus and the difficulty of filming a word-for-word script.3: Screenwriter John Goldsmith tells how the script was constructed and talks about the absurd charges that the Gospel of John is anti-semitic.4: Director of Photography Miroslaw Baszak.5: Production Designer Don Taylor, on building the sets and finding the outdoor locations.6: Costume Designer Debra Hanson on the 2,500 costumes, and the symbolism of the color palette used.7: Composer Jeff Danna in the recording studio.8: Hair and Makeup Designer Trefor Proud on the magic of his craft.9: Narrator Christopher Plummer.10: Henry Ian Cusick.",5,&quot;this was the real light&quot;,1080691200,"03 31, 2004",2004,2760,"['Using', 'American', 'Bible', 'Society', 'Good', 'News', 'Bible', 'word-for-word', 'production', 'meticulous', 'detail', 'exquisitely', 'acted', 'filmed', 'Gospel', 'John', 'divinity', 'Jesus', 'best', 'loved', 'passages', 'scripture', 'perhaps', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'verse', 'New', 'Testament', 'John', '3:16', 'quot', 'God', 'so', 'loved', 'world', 'gave', 'only', 'begotten', 'Son', 'whoever', 'Him', 'should', 'not', 'perish', 'have', 'everlasting', 'life', 'quot', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'authenticity', 'costumes', 'sets', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'make', 'production', 'must', 'Christian', 'film', 'library', 'would', 'also', 'make', 'excellent', 'teaching', 'tool.Henry', 'Ian', 'Cusick', 'brilliant', 'Jesus', 'actor', 'extensive', 'theatrical', 'credits', 'varied', 'life', 'experience', 'being', 'born', 'Peru', 'raised', 'Trinidad', 'Scotland', 'now', 'living', 'England', 'face', 'depth', 'beauty', 'much', 'expressiveness', 'voice', 'joy', 'listen', 'are', 'scenes', 'wide', 'range', 'emotion', 'sensitivity', 'raising', 'Lazarus', 'driving', 'money', 'changers', 'passion', 'rage', 'strong', 'vital', 'Jesus', 'not', 'ethereal', 'slender', 'man', 'sometimes', 'depicted', 'films', 'one', 'am', 'sure', 'more', 'Jesus', 'history.Other', 'splendid', 'performances', 'come', 'Scott', 'Handy', 'John', 'Baptist', 'Daniel', 'Kash', 'Simon', 'Peter', 'Richard', 'Lintern', 'Leading', 'Pharisee', 'Stephen', 'Russell', 'Pontius', 'Pilate.The', 'narration', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'masterful.The', 'lovely', 'outdoor', 'locations', 'were', 'filmed', 'Southern', 'Spain', 'score', 'Jeff', 'Danna', 'using', 'native', 'instruments', 'wonderful', 'ney', 'middle-eastern', 'flute', 'ancient', 'fiddle', 'called', 'rebab', 'Soprano', 'Esther', 'Lamandieu', 'much', 'music', 'chants', 'Aramaic', 'especially', 'final', 'credits', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '3', 'hours.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'quot', 'Scenes', 'quot', 'total', 'running', 'time', '1', 'hour', '39', 'minutes.1', 'History', 'Gospel', 'John', 'comments', 'Academic', 'Advisory', 'Committee', 'Visual', 'Bible', 'International', 'Inc.2', 'Director', 'Philip', 'Saville', 'who', 'why', 'chose', 'Cusick', 'part', 'Jesus', 'difficulty', 'filming', 'word-for-word', 'script.3', 'Screenwriter', 'John', 'Goldsmith', 'how', 'script', 'was', 'constructed', 'talks', 'absurd', 'charges', 'Gospel', 'John', 'anti-semitic.4', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Miroslaw', 'Baszak.5', 'Production', 'Designer', 'Don', 'Taylor', 'building', 'sets', 'finding', 'outdoor', 'locations.6', 'Costume', 'Designer', 'Debra', 'Hanson', '2,500', 'costumes', 'symbolism', 'color', 'palette', 'used.7', 'Composer', 'Jeff', 'Danna', 'recording', 'studio.8', 'Hair', 'Makeup', 'Designer', 'Trefor', 'Proud', 'magic', 'craft.9', 'Narrator', 'Christopher', 'Plummer.10', 'Henry', 'Ian', 'Cusick']",Gospel of John

803455,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0001FT50A,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 3]","This is a review of the quality of film making in this dramatization of the fourth Gospel in the Christian New Testament.The very best thing we can say about the film, as a tool for teaching the Bible, is that in the three hour unedited version, it has virtually every word from the Bible. This alone is worth three stars, because this is the first time I've seen such fidelity to the text. The second best thing is that for those scenes which are suitable to good dramatization, such as the trial scenes with Pontius Pilate, the direction is well done. Third, overall, the locations and set decorations and all other crafts which go into the look and feel of the movie are above average for an audience which is prepared to accept far less than Hollywood grade quality. The only place where they may have overplayed their hand is in the interiors for Pontius Pilate's Governor's quarters. Pilate was not a governor, he was a prefect (magistrate) and procurator (tax collector). That means it was a second rate position in a third rate posting for an Imperial diplomat. His business quarters would not have been quite so splendid.I was tickled by the fact that the one character who stood out ammong all others is Pontius Pilate. That may have been because he was only in the most dramatic scenes, or, the actor, Steven Russell, did a decent job. He was the perfect lower middle level Roman official. Imperious, but with far, far less gravitas than Ciar&aacute;n Hinds the actor who porttrayed Julius Caesar in HBO's series ""Rome"". But like his ""palace"", I suspect his wearing what appeared to be a Centurian's uniform was not appropriate to his role or posting. I beleive prefects wore togas similar to senators, but without the wide maroon stripe signifying their rank.Some scenes were weak, but that was due to the limitations of the narrative. The fourth Gospel has lots of long speeches by Jesus. The film presented this as being spoken while Jesus was on the road. Both I and my NT professor believe those would have been delivered around a campfire or a table.The one scene which required much imagination was the meeting between Mary Magdalene and the risen Jesus. Mary's mistaking Jesus for a Gardener is not handled very cleverly. He is partly hidden behind a bush he seems to be planting. I have seen a picture of this scene where the mistake is attributed to the way Jesus is dressed. It would have been really daring to picture this as a vision by Mary. At the very least, the director seems to have missed the sense that there was much confusion, appropriate to a dream or vision.Overall, this is a super production for presentation as part of a Bible study for virtually any grade or age.",4,All the words in the Gospel,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,2703,"['review', 'quality', 'film', 'making', 'dramatization', 'fourth', 'Gospel', 'Christian', 'New', 'Testament.The', 'very', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'tool', 'teaching', 'Bible', 'three', 'hour', 'unedited', 'version', 'virtually', 'word', 'Bible', 'alone', 'worth', 'three', 'stars', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'such', 'fidelity', 'text', 'second', 'best', 'thing', 'scenes', 'are', 'suitable', 'good', 'dramatization', 'such', 'trial', 'scenes', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'direction', 'well', 'done', 'Third', 'overall', 'locations', 'set', 'decorations', 'other', 'crafts', 'go', 'look', 'feel', 'movie', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'audience', 'prepared', 'accept', 'far', 'less', 'Hollywood', 'grade', 'quality', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'may', 'have', 'overplayed', 'hand', 'interiors', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'Governor', 'quarters', 'Pilate', 'was', 'not', 'governor', 'was', 'prefect', 'magistrate', 'procurator', 'tax', 'collector', 'was', 'second', 'rate', 'position', 'third', 'rate', 'posting', 'Imperial', 'diplomat', 'business', 'quarters', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'so', 'splendid.I', 'was', 'tickled', 'fact', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'stood', 'out', 'others', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'only', 'most', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'actor', 'Steven', 'Russell', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'was', 'perfect', 'lower', 'middle', 'level', 'Roman', 'official', 'Imperious', 'far', 'far', 'less', 'gravitas', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'actor', 'who', 'porttrayed', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'HBO', 'series', 'Rome', 'palace', 'suspect', 'wearing', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'Centurian', 'uniform', 'was', 'not', 'appropriate', 'role', 'posting', 'beleive', 'prefects', 'wore', 'togas', 'similar', 'senators', 'wide', 'maroon', 'stripe', 'signifying', 'rank.Some', 'scenes', 'were', 'weak', 'was', 'due', 'limitations', 'narrative', 'fourth', 'Gospel', 'lots', 'long', 'speeches', 'Jesus', 'film', 'presented', 'being', 'spoken', 'Jesus', 'was', 'road', 'NT', 'professor', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'delivered', 'campfire', 'table.The', 'one', 'scene', 'required', 'much', 'imagination', 'was', 'meeting', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'risen', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'mistaking', 'Jesus', 'Gardener', 'not', 'handled', 'very', 'cleverly', 'partly', 'hidden', 'bush', 'be', 'planting', 'have', 'seen', 'picture', 'scene', 'where', 'mistake', 'attributed', 'way', 'Jesus', 'dressed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'daring', 'picture', 'vision', 'Mary', 'very', 'least', 'director', 'have', 'missed', 'sense', 'was', 'much', 'confusion', 'appropriate', 'dream', 'vision.Overall', 'super', 'production', 'presentation', 'part', 'Bible', 'study', 'virtually', 'grade', 'age']",Gospel of John

I think this 'Gospel of John' (most recent of the 7 except for the very good animated 'Jesus: He Lived Among Us' (2011) is the best one. It takes all the guess work out of the inflection/meaning of the words, and one's visualization of the settings; it makes the story so perfectly clear that it helped me understand the meaning of Jesus' message much better, which [depending on your perspective] is THE most important thing to ever happen on earth. All the words spoken by people in the Gospel are recreated by the Jesus character and other actors, and the non-spoken words have really excellent resonant and easy-to-understand Narration by the great actor Christopher Plummer. *There is a brief interesting article on Wikipedia that tells about the production, and has links at the bottom to the other 2 word-for-word (NIV) productions of 'The Visual Bible: Matthew' and 'The Visual Bible: Acts' which I am anxious to see.

Henry Ian Cusick, FINALLY gets the Jesus of the Bible right, real & balanced, and the kind of Man/God-Man that you could imagine someone would follow or die for.Almost every attempt that Hollywood has tried gets Jesus Christ completely wrong & unbelievable. Henry Ian Cusick, however, must have studied Jesus well, and/or been very vary carefully directed to get this portrayal right. Only someone with intense courage could stand up to the religious hypocrites of Jesus' day and gotten right in their faces, yet still showed that he could care for them as people who mattered to God. Cusak does EXACTLY this. His courage in this film is what is described in all the written Gospels, and is so different than the Dreamy, Mysticical, and the androgynous Jesus in films like ""King of Kings"", ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", or even the embarrassingly two-dimensional Jesus of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" or ""Last Temptation of Christ"". Christopher Plummer's magnificent baritone voice adds weight and Dignity. And Jeff Danna's music is mysterious, captivating, and it captures the mystery, awe and a true Middle Eastern colouring. Astonishingly well filmed.I used to think that the only film about Jesus that even came CLOSE to the Jesus described in the Bible was ""Jesus of Nazareth"". Even so, with that film, Franco Zefferelli got it only ""half-way"" right; because Jesus still seems, at times other-worldly, and not capable of every HUMAN emotion; or of laughter! (Which is the whole point of the Gospels...Jesus, though God, was also a Man, capable of feeling joy, laughter, anger, sorrow and fear.) Zefferelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" was a breakthrough in showing honest, believable followers of Jesus Christ, and a magnificent, courageous Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. Still though, I felt even that film did not show the courage & bravery & sheer magnetism that Jesus must have had to make someone give up his or her life as a fisherman, prostitute or tax-collector. In ""The Gospel of John"", even Pilate is believable, and sees that Jesus had something about him brave enough, and honest enough to strike fear & doubt in someone who was a cynical ruler, who almost does the right thing. But in the end, believably, he tries to save his own skin.This film is as good as it gets. Buy this, or at least rent it. I'm sure and you'll actually believe someone like Jesus existed.

The movie was intresting enough to keep me watching with some sense of excitement. On the other hand, I would rather read the Gospel of John and see all the details and the exact words of the Lord Jesus Christ than watch a movie that paraphrases the holy words of our Savior.Overall, this movie tracked along with the Gospel of John. It showed many of the characters intorduced in the book and gave a bisic description of the life of Jesus. The movie showed Jesus healing the sick, raising Lazarus from the grave, saving the womans life who was caught in the act of adultry and many other stories taught in the Gospel of John. The movie showed the struggles that Jesus and his disciples faced while presenting the fact that He was the Messiah that those in times past prophecied about.I have been active in my church for my entire life. Because of that, I am very familiar with the Gospel of John. The movie, somewhat realistic, did not tell all the details associated with the story of Jesus Christ. Oner for example, What happened to John the Baptist. Another is after Judas betrays the Lord, the movie does not show him hanging himself because of the guilt he feels. One of the biggest, most important things left out was Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane praying and asking God to let this cup pass from him. This is one of the greatest parts of the story of Jesus.

803473,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B0001FT50A,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[1, 6]","The only worthwhile thing about this production which sought to ride the Passion of the Mel crest is the reading by Plummer. The rest as they say is history.The tip off that this was cashing in on the Mel craze is the opening rather lengthy disclaimer which wriggles and squiggles to avoid accusations of anti-semitism by placing the Gospel of John in an historical context of sectarian struggle amongst the Jews including the followers of Jesus Christ, which is then followed by the narration and dialogue which continually condemns the Jewish authorities rather than a blanket reference to &#34;the Jews&#34;. This of course will please no one, including those who are concerned about fine and traditional points of English translations. Mel sought to overcome this by using the original languages, including Aramaic.And I wish someone would tell the producers and directors of this and any other film that Jesus not only did not speak English but also did not speak in a phoney upper crust decadent British accent in which all vowels say AH= Mah fahthah wahs ah'wahlkahn dahn thah gahdahn pahth ahn hahse ahnd ah brahnch hahd ah fahll ahn . . . etc. In fact considering the slave trade, the sepoys, the military empire with attendant merciless colonialism, the arrogance and the genocide of the Irish, that is probably the least Christian of language communities in all the history of humanity.Please notice the alleged biblical and theological consultants cited by this production, using only the alphabet soup unspecified (and including BA's!) after their names, mainly from Toronto, and apparently mainly anglicans, as such important information as clerical state, observances, and even Faith are suppressed. We are left with no indication why these have any authority as Biblical consultants, aside from the unspecified alphabet soup.And then look at the bug-eyed stand-ins for actors, who look mainly like a collection of the dregs from Canadian biker bars, who believe the height of acting and emoting is not restraint but twisting the eyes widely as when tweaking on methamphetamines. They all look like they have not spent much time in the sunlight, out of doors, or in sandals rather than boots. Their head shots were probably great on paper, but the execution is atrocious.The Christ from first appearance comes across as smug and happy go lucky and arrogant, and so probably okay for the self-proclaimed evangelical sects currently in power in Washington, or for viewing by the Sunday school groups of young children first encountering the Gospel of John. In fact the first walk on by Jesus grinning to Himself by the stand'in Jordan reads more like a guy used to the frozen north enjoying a warm semi tropical vacation in sandals and no socks, wondering mischievously whether everyone else realizes he is not wearing underwear and loving it.Any other sophisticated viewer will be rightfully and rapidly bored and throwing socks at the television monitor. Only the voice of Plummer salvages anything from this atrocious B-movie production.I only got this to see how far we have gone beyond Pasolini. This production, like his, obviously does not employ trained actors. A SAG card does not an actor make. But Pasolini created eternal and solid art, truly and faithfully representing the Good News in the Gospel According to Saint Matthew. But after seeing all these Canadian actors popping their eyes, from Saint John the Baptist to the Samaritan woman at the well, I could look no more, and listened for Plummer instead. Yet the casual superficial supercilious reading by Our Lord's actor of the immortal Last Supper chapters from Saint John grew cold and long. Indeed Plummer could have phoned in his part, yet he delivers it with proper gravitas (not overdone) and inflection, emotion and wisdom. The actor who does Jesus, on the other hand, phones in his voice over of these Last Supper prayers with no indication he realizes what these central prayers really mean, without conviction, intelligence or feeling.We often discover most about someone by the way they advertise or imagine themselves to be. Thus we must notice on the case of this DVD the only blurbs which appear are from the industry promoter Variety weekly, which is quoted only as saying &#34;Dramatically Powerful&#34; (or was it &#34;powerfully dramatic&#34;?) Variety is paid to provide such meaningless yet overblown adverbs and adjectives, stripped of their context, paragraph, sentence or even noun. FOr all we know the surrounding sentence might have read: &#34;Pasolini's Gospel According to Saint Matthew is very dramatically powerful while this Book of John is soporific and sophomoric.&#34; The other blurb the producers chose for their case comes from the equally commercial Associated Press and, though again limited to two words (if we count the hyphen as creating one neologism), at least has a noun: &#34;Thought-provoking entertainment.&#34; Again we do not know the context, not even the sentence, but we can see the operative word is ENTERTAINMENT. Whatever thoughts it may provoke are at variance with the producer's intent. Notice that no theologian stepped up to the bat to provide an endorsement of this product.Beware, be very aware, and get the great Pasolini film instead. Or read the Book. It's way better.By the way, if this is the Gospel of John, why are incidents only in the Synoptics included? This movie cannot please the careful and conscientious reader.",1,what I really wish someone had warned me before I bought this unholy unwatchable turkey,1175817600,"04 6, 2007",2007,5470,"['only',

Cullmann,"[4, 4]","I've already had a few people ask me if this movie will ""ruin"", ""conflict"" or ""hurt"" Mel Gibson's movie ""The Passion"" (which will hopefully be released early next year). I even read a quote that said, ""There are other Jesus movies in preparation, but 'The Gospel of John' is the one that most Christians have been waiting for."" Folks, please forgive me for bluntly expressing my opinion but shame on any of us for thinking that way. Christians should be thrilled that there are a couple of movies portraying Jesus and his ministry coming soon to a theater near you. Just as there are four different Gospels with four different interpretations of Christ and his ministry, so can (and should) there be a multitude of distinctly different movies telling the truth about Jesus.I have seen Mel Gibson's movie ""The Passion,"" and it is a completely different story, focus and interpretation from ""The Gospel of John,"" so why would anyone think one would hurt the other or that one would be better than another? Isn't that the beauty of telling a story and that there are many different ways to do so? Hollywood is famous for releasing movies with similar themes and storylines around the same time. Just this summer we were inundated with comic book heroes from ""X2"" and ""The Hulk,"" futuristic heroes from ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Terminator: Rise of the Machines"" and within a week of each other we were given two very different pirate movies:  ""Sinbad:  Legend of the Seven Seas"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean:  The Curse of the Black Pearl."".At a time in our culture when Hollywood is most comfortable using Jesus' name as religious profanity in their movies, the church needs to rally behind the filmmakers who dare to give Jesus honor (and a platform) by making a movie about him. Provided they are good movies and the content is worthy of our money and patronage, let's pay each film, its director and producers the respect they deserve by supporting their movies and the ultimate ""good news"" message that will reach the world.Plot:  This is a three-hour epic feature on the story of Jesus' life as described by His disciple John from the New Testament book of John. It is the first major theatrical picture of an entire book of the Bible adapted on a word-for-word basis and narrated by the actor Christopher Plummer. Along with the narration, Jesus (Cusick) is shown interacting with his disciples John (Bunce) and Peter (Kash) as well as Andrew, Philip, Thomas and Judas. There are several scenes where Jesus clashes with the leading Pharisee (Lintern), goes through his trial with Pilate (Russell) and meets up with Nicodemus and John the Baptist.  Many will recognize familiar characters:  Jesus' mother Mary, the sisters Martha and Mary and their brother Lazarus, Mary Magdalene and the blind and lame men Jesus healed.Good:  I sat in awe while watching this movie because it took Scripture that I've been familiar with for most of my life and transformed the familiar into a profound and intimate look at Jesus. I came out of the screening appreciating Christ, his teachings and his radical personality on a whole new level. Cusick portrays Jesus as an intelligent, manly, charismatic soul who has a tender heart towards women (saving one from being stoned), compassion on those who are sick, lame and blind, a righteous indignation when money changers invade the temple and a bold authority that challenged the pious religious authorities of his day.  Scriptwriter John Goldsmith (""Victoria and Albert"", ""Return of the Saint"", ""Great Expectations"") unfolds the story of Jesus in an easy-to-understand language using the American Bible Society's Good News Bible translation combined with Saville's (""Metroland"", ""Hamlet"", ""Oedipus the King"") keen directorial talents. The result is an entertaining, compelling and inspirational movie about Jesus that clearly explains why Jesus and his followers were at odds with the religious leaders of his day. As Jesus makes his messianic claims before the Pharisees and Sadducees, it's like watching Shakespeare for the first time and actually understanding what the dialogue means. The impressive cast of about 75 principal actors from the Canadian and British stage and nearly 2,500 extras creates an international version of Jesus that doesn't have an ""American"" look to it but instead feels as if you're watching a documentary as it actually happened. The original score was recorded by the world-renowned Philharmonia Orchestra of London, using ancient instruments to achieve authentic sounds of the period. The music emotionally moves the film and is a perfect addition for this kind of story.",4,Gospel of John,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,4646,"[""'ve"", 'already', 'had', 'few', 'people', 'ask', 'movie', 'will', 'ruin', 'conflict', 'hurt', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'Passion', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'released', 'early', 'next', 'year', 'even', 'read', 'quote', 'said', 'are', 'other', 'Jesus', 'movies', 'preparation', 'Gospel', 'John', 'one', 'most', 'Christians', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'Folks', 'please', 'forgive', 'bluntly', 'expressing', 'opinion', 'shame', 'thinking', 'way', 'Christians', 'should', 'be', 'thrilled', 'are', 'couple', 'movies', 'portraying', 'Jesus', 'ministry', 'coming', 'soon', 'theater', 'Just', 'are', 'four', 'different', 'Gospels', 'four', 'different', 'interpretations', 'Christ', 'ministry', 'so', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'multitude', 'distinctly', 'different', 'movies', 'telling', 'truth', 'Jesus.I', 'have', 'seen', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'Passion', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'focus', 'interpretation', 'Gospel', 'John', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'think', 'one', 'would', 'hurt', 'other', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'better', ""n't"", 'beauty', 'telling', 'story', 'are', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'do', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'famous', 'releasing', 'movies', 'similar', 'themes', 'storylines', 'same', 'time', 'Just', 'summer', 'were', 'inundated', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'X2', 'Hulk', 'futuristic', 'heroes', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'Terminator', 'Rise', 'Machines', 'week', 'other', 'were', 'given', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'pirate', 'movies', 'Sinbad', 'Legend', 'Seven', 'Seas', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Curse', 'Black', 'Pearl', '.At', 'time', 'culture', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'comfortable', 'using', 'Jesus', 'name', 'religious', 'profanity', 'movies', 'church', 'rally', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'dare', 'give', 'Jesus', 'honor', 'platform', 'making', 'movie', 'Provided', 'are', 'good', 'movies', 'content', 'worthy', 'money', 'patronage', 'let', 'pay', 'film', 'director', 'producers', 'respect', 'deserve', 'supporting', 'movies', 'ultimate', 'good', 'news', 'message', 'will', 'reach', 'world.Plot', 'three-hour', 'epic', 'feature', 'story', 'Jesus', 'life', 'described', 'disciple', 'John', 'New', 'Testament', 'book', 'John', 'first', 'major', 'theatrical', 'picture', 'entire', 'book', 'Bible', 'adapted', 'word-for-word', 'basis', 'narrated', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'narration', 'Jesus', 'Cusick', 'shown', 'interacting', 'disciples', 'John', 'Bunce', 'Peter', 'Kash', 'as', 'well', 'Andrew', 'Philip', 'Thomas', 'Judas', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jesus', 'leading', 'Pharisee', 'Lintern', 'trial', 'Pilate', 'Russell', 'up', 'Nicodemus', 'John', 'Baptist', 'Many', 'will', 'recognize', 'familiar', 'characters', 'Jesus', 'mother', 'Mary', 'sisters', 'Martha', 'Mary', 'brother', 'Lazarus', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'blind', 'lame', 'men', 'Jesus', 'healed.Good', 'sat', 'awe', 'watching', 'movie', 'took', 'Scripture', ""'ve"", 'been', 'familiar', 'most', 'life', 'transformed', 'familiar', 'profound', 'intimate', 'look', 'Jesus', 'came', 'out', 'screening', 'appreciating', 'Christ', 'teachings', 'radical', 'personality', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Cusick', 'Jesus', 'intelligent', 'manly', 'charismatic', 'soul', 'who', 'tender', 'heart', 'towards', 'women', 'saving', 'one', 'being', 'stoned', 'compassion', 'who', 'are', 'sick', 'lame', 'blind', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'when', 'money', 'changers', 'invade', 'temple', 'bold', 'authority', 'challenged', 'pious', 'religious', 'authorities', 'day', 'Scriptwriter', 'John', 'Goldsmith', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'Return', 'Saint', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'story', 'Jesus', 'easy-to-understand', 'language', 'using', 'American', 'Bible', 'Society', 'Good', 'News', 'Bible', 'translation', 'combined', 'Saville', 'Metroland', 'Hamlet', 'King', 'keen', 'directorial', 'talents', 'result', 'entertaining', 'compelling', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'Jesus', 'clearly', 'why', 'Jesus', 'followers', 'were', 'odds', 'religious', 'leaders', 'day', 'Jesus', 'messianic', 'claims', 'Pharisees', 'Sadducees', 'watching', 'Shakespeare', 'first', 'time', 'actually', 'understanding', 'what', 'dialogue', 'impressive', 'cast', '75', 'principal', 'actors', 'Canadian', 'British', 'stage', 'nearly', '2,500', 'extras', 'international', 'version', 'Jesus', ""n't"", 'have', 'American', 'look', 'instead', 'feels', ""'re"", 'watching', 'documentary', 'actually', 'happened', 'original', 'score', 'was', 'recorded', 'world-renowned', 'Philharmonia', 'Orchestra', 'London', 'using', 'ancient', 'instruments', 'achieve', 'authentic', 'sounds', 'period', 'music', 'emotionally', 'film', 'perfect', 'addition', 'kind', 'story']",Gospel of John

It's a little long to see in one sitting--it's some three hours in length--but what's nice about the DVD is that you can shut it off and come back next time. This is the entire gospel, or 21 biblical chapters in total. It beats reading it on your own, and in three hours you have lived through a book of the Bible! Henry Ian Cusick is a bit serious for the part, as I'm not convinced Jesus was as dour as he portrays, but generally he does a fine job. The crucifixion portrayl is nowhere near as graphic as The Passion of the Christ, yet the DVD box says that it receives a ""PG-13"" rating because of ""violence involving the crucifixion."" However, I had no problem letting my three young girls see this film in the theater.One minor criticism is the choice of Bible translation that was used, which was the Good News Bible.

803487,A3P2ROVW7YWQGJ,B0001FT50A,Encompassed Runner,"[14, 15]","Here's a few reasons to get this movie--1.  Artistically, it's believable and well-done (only quibble: John the Baptist was portrayed not just rugged, but with crazy-looking eyes and came off a bit Charlie Manson-esque).  In contrast, 'The Gospel of Matthew' also by The Visual Bible, was unbelievably portrayed to the point of distraction.  I could not focus on the word for word (NIV) script since the acting  did not match the message of the words of the Gospel--for ex, in The G. of Matthew movie, Jesus wouldn't stop smiling--even when the message was sober, say pronouncement of ""you are in error,"" ""vipers,"" woes, or endtimes judgment or a showdown with religious hypocrites--He'd do a smiling, touchy feely shoulder or hand grasp, even kiss a Pharisee, then casually with a smile ( or occasionally choking back tears) quietly and quickly speak the words of rebuke.  But in 'The Gospel of John' the actions match the words.  No interjection of a suspiciously high amount of endearing gestures, child-cuddling or playfulness that would make the movie incredulous.  Nor are there obvious unbiblical, much less occult, influences or biases as there were with The Passion.  (Even though Gospel of John is marketed as being in the spirit of The Passion, it is not, it is more biblical, no hints of Catholicism or spiritism.).2.  Substantially, this Jesus film is based on John, the one New Testament gospel book (out of the 4) that so highlights Jesus' deity, includes Jesus outright claim to be Messiah, and strongly assures the believer that salvation is secure and cannot be lost.3.  Personal reason:  it worked for me!  I bear testimony:  When it came out in the movie theatres I was trying to get a deeper hold on John's gospel, so thought that taking in a visual and audio presentation of it might shed new light that reading did not. Sure enough, each of the 5 times I saw it before buying it a new insight came to me.

Jesus of Nazareth presents an unemotional Jesus, and while the flashbacks in The Passion of the Christ show an attractive Savior, they are not the focus of the film.  This film presents a Jesus that you would not only want to know, but would believe you could know, as he is so friendly and approachable.  The big disapointment for me was in the scenes between the Last Supper and Our Lord's arrest.  Mary Magdalene is prominently featured in these scenes, with the camera focusing more on her than on any of the eleven remaining apostles.  There is no mention in the Gospel of John of Mary being there at this time, and it seemed obvious that a statement was being made by focusing so much on her presence.  It also struck me as strange that if they wanted to include women, without the support of the gospel, then why not include more women?  Why just a token?  If I were not Christian, I would wonder what this individual's relationship with Jesus was that she would be the only of his female followers to be included.  Why use those scenes to make a statement about women, or about that woman in particular?

803491,A392AOA6ZHAK6R,B0001FT50A,filmflavor,"[10, 10]","What a wonderful movie made about Jesus. This is an extremely powerful and riveting film. It is a word-for-word adaptation of the 21 chapters of the Gospel According to John. Christopher Plummer narrates parts of the film. Henry Ian Cusick is the most realistic Jesus I have seen portrayed on film. My other favorite Jesus performance is by Robert Powell in ""Jesus of Nazareth"" - a mini-series that first appeared on TV in 1977 and is 382 minutes long. That is also an excellent movie and worth buying on DVD.The directing, acting and musical score are done extremely well. This is an inspirational movie with a positive message and I highly recommend it to everyone.I recently bought the 2-disc DVD set of ""The Gospel of John"". My only complaint about this new 2-disc DVD set is that they got rid of the 3-disc DVD set and replaced it with the 2-disc set. So far, the only difference between the two sets that I can see are that this new 2-disc set dropped the DTS audio track but kept the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Also, this new 2-disc set includes a new 2-hour version of the film plus the original 3-hour theatrical version. I have no idea why someone would want to only watch a cut up version of a ""word-for-word"" movie version of ""The Gospel of John"".  I'm assuming that because they included this chopped up version of the film, they dropped the DTS audio track to make room for this other version of the film. I tried to buy the 3-disc set version of this film but I waited too long. I cannot find it (brand new) even on the film's website. But I'm still glad I bought this 2-disc set - It's a lot less expensive than the 3-disc set was. I haven't finished watching everything on it yet so I hope it has all the extras that the original 3-disc set had. It seems to have most of the extras except the DTS soundtrack.This movie is HIGHLY recommended for anybody and everybody but especially those who prefer to SEE and HEAR the Gospel of John in a ""visual"" way in addition to reading and studying the Bible. It's a treasure to keep forever. I think the Gospel of Mark is coming soon to theaters made by the same people that did this movie.

I believe Jesus was poor but He had more ""presence"" when He came to this world in the flesh as being the Son of God.John the Baptist's character looks too old for the role, bearing in mind he was only months older than Jesus.Ok, I could let those details pass, but then, what is Mary Magdalene doing with the Apostles?...in the last supper?... She was one of Jesus' disciples but that doesn't mean she was following Jesus with the 12 Apostles.The Gospel of John doesn't mention if Magdalene was there with the Apostles during the last supper; however, Matthew (26:20) and Mark (14:17) DOES mention that; Jesus was there with 12 Apostles *only* so I don't see the *need* to include her at that private moment. This bothered me because this can make the assuming to some people that Magdalene could have been something ""more"" to Jesus which obviously she wasn't.

I did really enjoy the quality of this movie even though it didn't seem to fit the description of Christ. However having seen little to no previews about this movie I did grasp the whole concept pretty well. Jesus' character was so real and touchable he makes the viewer unable to resist wanting to know this Jesus of the Bible story. Overall, from the information I have received they did a great job of taking the Gospel of John and recreating it. In a very easy to understand format the gospel is given in power and love. The movie is rated PG-13 because of the violence of the crucifiction scene, but I don't believe there is anything in this movie that can't be viewed by all because it promotes compassion and understanding unlike what we see in the movies today. This would absolutely be the perfect movie for the whole family to see together. I feel that it is absolutely a reminder that all of us must remember the true teachings of Jesus Christ. As he resurfaced the point  in the movie that we must love one another. I hope that the message of this movie will reach everybody who watched it and change them for the good.

803513,A13FGQDHTDRV14,B0001FT50A,"John Wheeler ""Johanan Rakkav""","[7, 17]","Let me say first that I don't think ""Jesus films"" are a good idea at all; you'll find out why shortly. But because this one is better than most, let us proceed...Mostly because of the music featured on the Web site's original previews, I've seen THE GOSPEL OF JOHN -- both the movie (in theatres) and the DVD. Also, I'm very familiar with the recordings published by Esther Lamandier that were cited in the movie. I was pleased with the richness and diversity of Jeff Danna's film score, and thus bought the soundtrack (reviewed elsewhere).First, the positive qualities of the film: Henry van Cusick brings an energy and =joie de vivre= to his role that one doesn't often see in portrayals of Jesus. (He actually makes us believe that someone as skinny as I used to be could drive out the money-changers and their cattle from the Temple.) The other parts seem well-cast too; the chief Pharisee in the Sanhedrin (who carries so much of the film's villany) very nearly steals the show through his =gravitas=. Much attention to physical detail exists in the film, which (if you know what you're looking at) can be very educational. And by purely human standards, the film is very emotive and uplifting.Unfortunately, for me the negative qualities of the film are far more numerous. First, and most severely, portrayals of Jesus in art are clear violations of the Second Commandment -- something even the Catholic Church as late as Tertullian's time understood. Second, the portrayal we are offered is the same old skinny, long-haired, dirt-poor icon that was compiled centuries after the New Testament was written -- an icon which has nothing to do with the Bible or history (and which does not limit its errors to mere appearance). Third, many other historical details -- far too numerous to list here -- are completely overlooked by the film. Since when was the Passover celebrated with =leavened= pita bread, for example? All these lacks don't exactly build my faith in the film makers or in their supposedly expert consultants in religion and culture.One nit I especially want to pick is the way Mme. Lamandier's musical contributions are described. You may read a longer critique elsewhere, where the soundtrack is offered. Suffice it to say here that Mme. Lamandier's melodic renditions (contrary to advertisement) are almost entirely not in Aramaic, but in biblical Hebrew. The Hebrew melodies themselves were restituted from the Masoretic accentuation by Suzanne Haik-Vantoura, who thankfully is mentioned properly in the film credits. (See my reviews of the book and the recording called THE MUSIC OF THE BIBLE REVEALED, sold elsewhere on Amazon.com.)There are reasons why in antiquity, the Hebrew Bible was sung aloud (Ps. 119:54) and the Greek New Testament was read aloud (Rev. 1:1-3). One of them is that ""faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."" Faith typically doesn't come by seeing (as Jesus noted for Thomas' benefit!), let alone by seeing a false and self-limiting concept of Jesus. But at least this particular false concept of Jesus is less perverse than that given to us by THE PASSION.",4,"A decent film as such, but I much prefer the Book",1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,3121,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Jesus', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'idea', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'why', 'shortly', 'one', 'better', 'most', 'let', 'proceed', 'Mostly', 'music', 'featured', 'Web', 'site', 'original', 'previews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'THE', 'GOSPEL', 'OF', 'JOHN', 'movie', 'theatres', 'DVD', 'Also', ""'m"", 'very', 'familiar', 'recordings', 'published', 'Esther', 'Lamandier', 'were', 'cited', 'movie', 'was', 'pleased', 'richness', 'diversity', 'Jeff', 'Danna', 'film', 'score', 'thus', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'reviewed', 'elsewhere', '.First', 'positive', 'qualities', 'film', 'Henry', 'van', 'Cusick', 'energy', '=joie', 'de', 'vivre=', 'role', 'one', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'portrayals', 'Jesus', 'actually', 'believe', 'someone', 'as', 'skinny', 'used', 'be', 'could', 'drive', 'out', 'money-changers', 'cattle', 'Temple', 'other', 'parts', 'seem', 'well-cast', 'too', 'chief', 'Pharisee', 'Sanhedrin', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'villany', 'very', 'nearly', 'show', '=gravitas=', 'Much', 'attention', 'physical', 'detail', 'exists', 'film', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'educational', 'purely', 'human', 'standards', 'film', 'very', 'emotive', 'uplifting.Unfortunately', 'negative', 'qualities', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'numerous', 'First', 'most', 'severely', 'portrayals', 'Jesus', 'art', 'are', 'clear', 'violations', 'Second', 'Commandment', 'something', 'even', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'as', 'late', 'Tertullian', 'time', 'understood', 'Second', 'portrayal', 'are', 'offered', 'same', 'old', 'skinny', 'long-haired', 'dirt-poor', 'icon', 'was', 'compiled', 'centuries', 'New', 'Testament', 'was', 'written', 'icon', 'nothing', 'do', 'Bible', 'history', 'not', 'limit', 'errors', 'mere', 'appearance', 'Third', 'many', 'other', 'historical', 'details', 'far', 'too', 'numerous', 'list', 'here', 'are', 'completely', 'overlooked', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'Passover', 'celebrated', '=leavened=', 'pita', 'bread', 'example', 'lacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'build', 'faith', 'film', 'makers', 'supposedly', 'expert', 'consultants', 'religion', 'culture.One', 'nit', 'especially', 'want', 'pick', 'way', 'Mme', 'Lamandier', 'musical', 'contributions', 'are', 'described', 'may', 'read', 'longer', 'critique', 'elsewhere', 'where', 'soundtrack', 'offered', 'Suffice', 'say', 'here', 'Mme', 'Lamandier', 'melodic', 'renditions', 'contrary', 'advertisement', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'not', 'Aramaic', 'biblical', 'Hebrew', 'Hebrew', 'melodies', 'were', 'restituted', 'Masoretic', 'accentuation', 'Suzanne', 'Haik-Vantoura', 'who', 'thankfully', 'mentioned', 'properly', 'film', 'credits', 'See', 'reviews', 'book', 'recording', 'called', 'THE', 'MUSIC', 'THE', 'BIBLE', 'REVEALED', 'sold', 'elsewhere', 'Amazon.com', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'antiquity', 'Hebrew', 'Bible', 'was', 'sung', 'aloud', 'Ps', '119:54', 'Greek', 'New', 'Testament', 'was', 'read', 'aloud', 'Rev', '1:1-3', 'One', 'faith', 'hearing', 'hearing', 'Word', 'God', 'Faith', 'typically', ""n't"", 'come', 'seeing', 'Jesus', 'noted', 'Thomas', 'benefit', 'let', 'alone', 'seeing', 'false', 'self-limiting', 'concept', 'Jesus', 'least', 'particular', 'false', 'concept', 'Jesus', 'less', 'perverse', 'given', 'PASSION']",Gospel of John

803518,A37JKM7EFD0DIQ,B0001FT50A,K.H.,"[160, 166]","This movie, based on one of the modern langauage versions of the Gospel of John is fairly accurate and nicly filmed.  Christopher Plummer narrates and the actor portraying Jesus does a fine job.  The strength of the movie is that while it is filmed on a limited budget, the director, Eric Till, is up to the task of trying to get everything he can out of the sets, sights,and people in the movie.The movie does have some drawbacks, and since most reviews have focused on the positives,  I'm going to briefly mention a couple of negatives: (1) the casting of Mary is just downright poor.  The women is way to old and appears more like a great-grandmother than a mother.  After all, Mary was probably only 14-16 years older than Jesus and this puts a lot of things into historical context (albiet, probably not that important for this film); (2)  Refering to miracles as such and not as ""signs"" misses an important point.

It's like someone reading the entire book of John to you in a film with cast and everything in 3 hours.  This is the ministry edition.  I haven't seen the regular edition (under 2 hours), I guess much was cut to reduce it to under 2 hours.)This is by far the best gospel film; bible based, I've ever seen.  It out did Ten Commandments (not exactly to word).  It is also far better than the other two ""visual bible"" series--Matthew and Acts.The other 2 has problem in quality. (save it for another review).This one, has features on the DVD when a little sign comes on, you can click on it and look at the historical background information of what that scene or the particular statement means in the historical context.Extremely educational and very good for bible study classes.At first, I didn't like the cast starring Jesus.  But as the film (it's not a movie, in my opinion) progresses, I grew to like him and think he did a wonderful job portraying Jesus in this gospel.The director did a wonderful job blending the Biblical text with the different scenes and it just seems so smooth--all of the transitions.  It doesn't tell you like the other two films in the series, verse by verse.  It's a streamlined, smooth presentation of the entire gospel.I've seen it twice already in one week.  (I rented it from Netflix first, then I decided to buy a copy for myself because it is so good.)I think if I watch it once per month, it will help me memorize the book of John much better.The DVD sold at Amazon is above list price ($22), then it lowered to $19.99 (sometimes).  CBD is selling at $14.99 but I bought it at Amazon because I get free shipping with Prime membership.Buy this DVD.

The shortest of the four gospels in the New Testament, is the chronicles of the human and very Jewish Yeshua, the carpenter who made the most blasphemous claim ever in the history of the Jewish and Gentile world: of being the promised Messiah promised by Moses.This film hints at why there is such controversy over Yeshua still ... is the Christ merely a pagan inspired concoction of Roman pagan tales combined with Greek myths used by Rome to divide the Jews with their own religion? Was Yeshua truly the Messiah fortold in the Book of Isiah? Was Yeshua a carpenter from Galillea who was a rebellious rabbi? Did Yeshua really do those miracles and resurrect to trick an uneducated Jewish uderclass? Was Yeshua truly the Messiah for the fruits of his wisdom have become the worldwide religious phenomenon known as Christianity? Was Yeshua even real at all? The film doesn't answer these questions but does leave the viewer with an understanding of New Testament story, historical context of Yeshua, and an understanding of the Jewish context of where Christianity sprang. In the early days after Yeshua died, Jews were divided into beliver and non-believer, and only when Constantine became a Christian was the word ""Christian"" (Christos is Greek for the annointed one) began and marked the final severance of the Jewish origins of the faith...Which brings us back to The Gospel of John Film - which is a focus on the words of Yeshua, his teachings, his life, his deeds, and his humanity.

The movie takes from the Bible and that John's Gospel displays different passages for which of his disciple for the book of John New Testament. There are scenes where Pharisee and Jesus clash and he goes to meet up with Nicodemus and John. There are characters in the movie such as Mary who was Jesus mother and Mary Magdalene, and the blind men that Jesus also healed during the movie. This story displays many scriptures for example, the wedding where Jesus turns the water into wine, it also goes and shows where he picks who he wants for his disciples. People soon to realize that he is the messiah after all and that they did not know he was the person they were looking for all along. Jesus performed miracles and through the help of his Father God he was able to provide for his people and complete the test of faith. This movie showed how Jesus loved all regardless of where they came from or what they may have done in their lives. This movie portrayed the pain, suffering, and sacrifices that Jesus had to go through in order to be the ""Almighty"" Messiah of God. Jesus was a healer, performed miracles, saved lives with his teachings, and John the Gospel displayed this throughout the entire movie.Discussing the consistencies and inconsistencies with the stories recorded by the Gospels of ther Christian New Testament. This movie gave me a new insight not only on reviewing over the Bible but the scriptures and a new appreciation for Jesus alone for the struggles he went through for all human kind.

803534,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B0001FT50A,moviemusicbuff,"[14, 14]","I really love this DVD! The Gospel of John features an outstanding cast, most notably Henry Ian Cusick, an actor in his 30's who brings out the human side of Jesus but does it in such a reverent yet dynamic fashion. Here is a strong rather than wimpy Jesus. Here is a Jesus who is serious but who also laughs and shows his anger. This human portrayal of Christ does not detract from the divine side of Christ; rather it enhances it. The Bible speaks of Jesus Christ, both as the Son of God and the Son of Man - the Word who became flesh. Cusick makes the words of Christ come alive through his dynamic portrayal.Cusick's acting is just as outstanding as Robert Powell (Jesus of Nazareth) and James Caviezel (The Passion of the Christ).Another outstanding actor is Daniel Kash, who plays Simon Peter with a lot of feeling and passion.  He brings out the different sides of Peter.The only actors I felt were miscast were: the actress who played the Samaritan woman (she portrayed the Samaritan woman like a homeless person with a slight mental problem); the actress who played Mary the mother of Jesus (she looks more advanced in age than Mary seems to be).Even though this film is taken word-for-word from the Good News Bible, the actors speaking make the words flow dramatically so that it does not sound like people just reading a script in a play, they make it into a real feature-length movie. I also enjoyed Christopher Plummer's outstanding narration -- Plummer is a perfect choice as a narrator since he is so accomplished an actor both in film and in the theatre. His eloquent narration holds the whole narratives together and guides the viewer smoothly along the verses and chapters of the Gospel without distraction.This movie helped to give me a better appreciation of Jesus' work and teachings. It brought out the whole theme of the Gospel of John: Jesus truly is the Son of God; through believing in Him we may receive eternal life!I enjoyed the special features on the 3rd disc.  It offered interviews of Henry Ian Cusick and Christopher Plummer and also gave us a glimpse of how the movie was made.If you want a movie that does full justice in portraying Jesus according to what the Bible says, look no further.  This movie is excellent and gets better through repeated viewings.

Didn't think it would work. I was delighted to be proved wrong.Henry Ian Cusick plays Jesus Christ with great warmth and charisma. In this film adaptation of the most mystical of the gospels with its strong message of Jesus' divinity, Cusick's performance somehow suggests that divinity while at the same time showing Jesus as fully human and lovable, a man who relates to others with compassion, a man who preaches, feasts, shows grief, anger, and joy, is on the one hand a man who spends time with a circle of intimate friends and on the other hand a mysterious being, misunderstood by all, who unwaveringly claims that he is the son of God. I cannot praise Cusick's portrayal enough.Apart from his performance, the best things about this film are the haunting, evocative musical score, the detailed, fully realized world of first century Jerusalem, the narration by Christopher Plummer, and the deeply moving performances from the actors who play the disciples. The wonder, joy, and love on their faces as they realize who this man is who is gathering them together are priceless.St. John, because of his presumed youth, is traditionally portrayed as beardless and rather feminine looking. It's a nice change to see him here played by a man who, although youthful, is decidedly masculine.The actress who plays the Blessed Mother makes the most of her brief appearances. At the Wedding of Cana, she comes off as a delightful, gracious, sensitive woman, neither otherworldly nor vulgarized. A woman full of staunch faith in her son (and with probably excellent taste in wines!).My only complaint is that the other female performances were rather lackluster. Martha and Mary of Bethany seem a little deadpan for women who have just lost their beloved brother. Mary Magdalene's role at the Last Supper, as portrayed here, is theologically questionable. But these are small complaints.I am puzzled by the objection of one reviewer that this film is told from a Mormon point of view. It certainly is not. The Bible translation used is, I believe, a mainstream Protestant one and I had no idea the verse to which he objected was so controversial. I'm afraid he has misunderstood it.Incidentally, although in general I'm not a big fan of the more informal Bible translations, I do think the more conversational tone of this one worked very well in context.All in all, a moving and visually stunning film interpretation of my favorite gospel.

It's mostly a summary of Jesus, his teachings, through the eyes and perspective of John. This story being named The Gospel of John summarizes Jesus' life and presents the story of his life through the perspective of a disciple of sorts...and does show many of the most popular and well known stories such as the wedding Jesus and his disciples attended where he turns the water into wine, how he chose his disciples, his frustration with the people and the use of the temple when they were using it as a ""marketplace"" together with the story of many people in various areas discovering that he was in fact the Messiah that they had waited so long for. The narration was at first strange but helpful with many scenes that needed further interpretation. The movie also notes stories such as the crippled man waiting on his own miracle so he would be able to walk and Jesus healed him. There as a governmental official whose son was dying and Jesus was able to heal him. He was able to prove himself as the Messiah via his miracles he preformed. The story of the loaves and the fishes is one of the most famous stories of Jesus which is also noted in this film.  Through the help of God, he was able to provide, and perform miracles so that others could eat and drink without having to go without. All of these miracles were a complete test of faith. The entire movie is very emotional as Jesus is strongly trying to spread his word of love and it's a very interesting story line even for those who are not of the Christian faith. The movie is very easy to follow, and it's definitely authentic as to the teachings that are truly in the bible. The movie shows a very dramatic and attention-grabbing end to Jesus' life, via the crucifixion, and portrays the pain and suffering that he went through in order to act as the Messiah of God, and the earthly proxy to ""The Almighty"".

The only complaint I have is the interpretation of ""the sixth hour"" as ""about noon"" in the passion history. Cusick's performance is subdued, but lively when it needs to be-- driving the merchants from the temple, dealing with his enemies.In this movie, you will meet Jesus.

For a more up-to-date alternative, perhaps the New International Version would have worked well, too.  (As a Protestant, I preferred the NIV, although now, as a Roman Catholic, I wish the NIV would offer the seven, missing Old Testament books.)The depiction of Jesus, offered by Henry Ian Cusick, had merit with regard to possibly showing us at times a ""joyous"" Christ, but in short while it seemed to become excessive and turn into happy-go-luckiness.  I was distracted to the point of keeping track of the relatively few number of times when the (now annoying) smirk came off Cusick's face.  Consequently, the charaterization of Jesus became rather flat, or mono-dimensional, more like a hand-shaking, campaigning politician than a suffering servant.  In addition, Cusick's stature and physical carriage (that nonchalant gait and girlish waddle) were weak and unmasculine, I thought, lacking the single minded purposefulness of the Savior.  Across the board, The Passion's James Caivezel portrayed a more believably human (and more believably divine) Christ than did Cusick.Diana Berriman, as the Blessed Mother, was--to be quite blunt--rather ugly, old and stupid-looking in her appearance, and aloof from her Son in her behavior, in this film.  I'm not sure how much of this was intentional, as a kind of Protestant (and almost reflexively anti-Marian) rejoinder to The Passion's powerful, moving and believable depiction of the Virgin Mary by Maia Morgenstern.  If the goal of The Gospel of John was to politely denigrate Our Lady of Angels, then it definitely succeeded.  Berriman's Blessed Mother is a painful hue and cry short, for example, of the endearing portrait that the Church Fathers extract from the Canticle of Canticles.The oh-so politically correct, and unbiblical insertion of Mary Magdalen into the Last Supper and succeeding pre-Passion scenes does, as another reviewer obeserves, play right into Dan Brown's da Vinci Code nonsense.  The film took inordinate efforts, which I found quite bothersome, to frequently and centrally place the camera lens on Mary Magdalen where, when and how she didn't belong, serving more to solidify the nefarious fiction of Dan Brown than to advance the cause of the Gospel.  Perhaps another anti-Catholic ""hipshot""(?).  This was perhaps the most irritating element in the film for me, making me think: Are we selling the Gospel, or preaching it, here?Admittedly, my Catholic sensitivities were on high alert while I viewed this film--as they would be for any film portraying Jesus Christ.  Having countered Protestant attacks for some time now, I realize that much of what Protestants vehemently protest stems more often from an honest misunderstanding of the Catholic Church rather than a genuine hatred of Her.  Many anti-Catholic postures subconsciously sieze the mind of the Protestant detractor, such that he is usually unaware of when, why and even if at all he has come to assume one of them.  That much--which really isn't a whole lot--I do understand; pictorially fictionalizing the Gospel I do not understand.To reiterate, the film's basic premise--to literally follow St. John's Gospel--was excellent.  However, other choices for the scriptural text itself (-0.5 star), as well as better casting and more reverent and believable performances for Jesus and Mary (-1 star) would have, I think, done more justice to The Gospel of John.  Finally, the gratuitous pandering to political correctness and the witting, or unwitting, allegiance that this film gives to Dan Brown's absurd fiction about St. Mary Magdalen and Jesus was perhaps the last straw (-1.5 stars).I realize, too, that The Passion and The Gospel of John are different films, but the former did seem to get most things right with respect to its casting and direction whereas the latter seems to have gotten very few things, if anything, right.2 (beleaguered) Stars",2,"Good, but could have been Much, Much Better",1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,4528,"['idea', 'using',

At first I thought the actor who portrayed Jesus lacked sufficient seriousness or authority, but I liked him better as the film went on.  And the second time I watched I enjoyed it even more.  This film is not 100% Gospel of John but it comes close.  So if you are too lazy to pick up the book and read you should at least watch this film, and several times.Another reviewer wrote that Mary in the film was too old.  It is possible that she was only ca. 15 years older than He, however Jesus was likely born ca. 7 BC and so was near 40 before he was lifted up in 33 AD.  (See Luke 2:1.)  Additionally, realize that the vast majority of people in 33 AD did not live their lives like we do now, fat and sleek, living in plywood McMansions, driving in Lincoln Navigators with GPS and going to the beauty parlor every week.  These people lived off the land and their bodies showed it.Now, on the other hand I did not appreciate the 3rd DVD included with commentary from ""scholars.""  E.g. a ""scholar"" commented that the ""idea"" of the Messiah was ""around"" for about 500 years prior to Jesus' birth.  The ""idea"" was around much longer than that; it was first documented in Genesis 3:15.  See also Deut. 18:15.  But is this not exemplary of ""modern scholarship?""  ""Scholarship"" today is nothing more than purposeful obfuscation and if any of it is to be understood at all, often it is in contradiction with the fundamentals.

The material is adapted with fidelity as a self-contained work.  Seeing it as a complete story is much different than taking elements of the life of Jesus out of context.A lot can be said about the adaptation, directing, acting, production design and music -- but what stands out is that the sum of these parts is much greater than the separate elements.  Dare I say this is a work of inspiration?The role of Jesus in world history deserves consideration in the light of the extreme religious fanatacism rampant today from the so-called People of the Book.  Who was this person who claimed to be Son of God and Son of man?  Factually, the apostle John details only a few points in the life of the Man who conquered death.  But John says ""Believe in the resurrection and you have eternal life now.""  How radical is that?Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" was assailed even before its release as fomenting anti-semitism.  Yes, ""The Gospel of John"" does not shy away from a blunt account of the role of the Roman and Jewish powers in the murder of Jesus; however, ""The Gospel of John"" makes it abundantly clear why the Pharisees saw Jesus as a threat. In today's world He's still a threat to those who seek power alone.For me, what jumped out of the film and still echoes in my mind is the several times Jesus asks: ""Why do you hate me?"" That question reverberates in today's headlines.  What if for just one day, the world had a ""Love your enemies and do good to those who hate you"" day?  Wonder what would happen?In a politically correct world, we no longer have public conversations about the subjective truth of the life of Jesus.  Or the meaning of that solitary life.  With advances in quantum physics, we consider the fundamental nature of of matter, time, mind and existence itself. ""The Gospel of John"" touches on all these things with sublime power and insight.  But more than anything else, it's about Love with a capital L.Like in any other movie, this one richly rewards the suspension of disbelief.  Surrender to a remarkable film that will haunt you long after final fade out.  Finally I understand why those early followers of Jesus said: ""We are not as those who have no hope.""The original DVD (out of print) has three discs with detailed extras that cover all the major production elements.  A newer edition has both a two hour version (nicely edited from the three hour theatrical release) as well as the longer version.

I watch a lot of movies and ""The Gospel of John"" is among the best films I've seen in the year it was released.  It's actually about something profound and acutely relevant.  And it is rendered with style and grace.Don't believe the posted reviewers who mock this film.

Zwick,"[15, 32]","In all the furor over ""The Passion of the Christ,"" almost no one seemed to notice ""The Gospel of John,"" a film that slipped in and out of theaters without causing the slightest stir almost six months prior to the release of Gibson's controversial opus.  Using the Good News Bible as its source, this three-hour film is a near word-for-word adaptation of the book believed by many scholars to be the most theologically advanced and least historically reliable of the four canonical gospels.Although the idea of providing so doggedly literal a translation might have seemed like a good one on paper, the fact is that the concept fails for one very obvious reason - which is that the narrator (in this case Christopher Plummer) becomes utterly superfluous as a storytelling device.  Since film is largely a visual medium, the narrator keeps telling us things we can clearly see with our own eyes.  If Jesus is shown looking at his disciples, the narrator informs us that ""Jesus looked at his disciples""; if the crowd finds a grassy hill on which to sit down, the ubiquitous voice intones ""the hill was covered with grass and the crowd sat down.""  And this sort of pointless iteration of the obvious goes on throughout the duration of the film.  The result is that it not only draws the story out to an unconscionable length, but we actually find ourselves snickering at wholly inappropriate moments.  My own personal favorite comes when we see Jesus rising from a crouching position while the narrator enlightens us with the information that ""Jesus straightened up.""  Another problem with this approach is that the very words of Jesus, being entirely unedited, come out as turgid monologues.  Somehow, all these speeches don't seem quite so longwinded when you`re reading them.  (It should be noted that the ENTIRE text has not actually been reproduced in the screenplay, for we are at least spared most of the ""he said""- type fillers in the dialogue scenes).Henry Ian Cusick does what he can with the role of Christ, but since John's account provides us with the least ""human"" Jesus of the four, the actor has a difficult time bringing the Savior to life as a flesh-and-blood human being.  Many of the other actors - particularly Steven Russell as Pilate and a large number of the crowd-scene extras - turn in surprisingly amateurish performances.It would be interesting to see filmmakers take this same literalist approach with Matthew, Mark and Luke, if only to observe how they would deal with the discrepancies between John's account and the other three.  For instance, John sets the cleansing of the temple early on in Jesus' ministry instead of at the start of Passion Week as the Synoptic writers do.  Moreover, Matthew shows Mary Magdalene on Easter morning learning of Jesus' resurrection from an angel in the empty tomb, while John has her find out from Jesus himself.  The poor servant of the high priest who falls victim to Peter's sword, doesn't even get his ear reattached here, as he does in ""The Passion.""  The film also cheats a bit by showing Jesus being baptized, even though, in John's account, the event is neither mentioned nor recorded.The movie has been handsomely shot on location, and there are a few effective moments along the way, but the literal-minded rigidity of the exercise ends up draining all the life and passion out of the story (particularly in contrast to Gibson`s work).  The crucifixion here is so utterly mundane and undramatic that it`s hard not to be bored during the event (where are Matthew`s darkness, earthquake and resurrected bodies when you need them?)Like a cinematic version of Books on Tape, ""The Gospel of John"" might be appropriate for use as a Sunday school primer, but it has very little to offer in the way of either inspiration or entertainment.",2,Bible Literalism Run Amuck,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3804,"['furor', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'almost', 'one', 'seemed', 'notice', 'Gospel', 'John', 'film', 'slipped', 'theaters', 'causing', 'slightest', 'stir', 'almost', 'six', 'months', 'prior', 'release', 'Gibson', 'controversial', 'opus', 'Using', 'Good', 'News', 'Bible', 'source', 'three-hour', 'film', 'near', 'word-for-word', 'adaptation', 'book', 'believed', 'many', 'scholars', 'be', 'most', 'theologically', 'advanced', 'least', 'historically', 'reliable', 'four', 'canonical', 'gospels.Although', 'idea', 'providing', 'so', 'doggedly', 'literal', 'translation', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'good', 'one', 'paper', 'fact', 'concept', 'one', 'very', 'obvious', 'reason', 'narrator', 'case', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'utterly', 'superfluous', 'storytelling', 'device', 'film', 'largely', 'visual', 'medium', 'narrator', 'telling', 'things', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'Jesus', 'shown', 'looking', 'disciples', 'narrator', 'Jesus', 'looked', 'disciples', 'crowd', 'grassy', 'hill', 'sit', 'down', 'ubiquitous', 'voice', 'intones', 'hill', 'was', 'covered', 'grass', 'crowd', 'sat', 'down', 'sort', 'pointless', 'iteration', 'obvious', 'duration', 'film', 'result', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'unconscionable', 'length', 'actually', 'find', 'ourselves', 'snickering', 'wholly', 'inappropriate', 'moments', 'own', 'personal', 'favorite', 'when', 'see', 'Jesus', 'rising', 'crouching', 'position', 'narrator', 'information', 'Jesus', 'straightened', 'up', 'problem', 'approach', 'very', 'words', 'Jesus', 'being', 'entirely', 'unedited', 'come', 'out', 'turgid', 'monologues', 'Somehow', 'speeches', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'so', 'longwinded', 'when', 're', 'reading', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'ENTIRE', 'text', 'not', 'actually', 'been', 'reproduced', 'screenplay', 'are', 'least', 'spared', 'most', 'said', 'type', 'fillers', 'dialogue', 'scenes', '.Henry', 'Ian', 'Cusick', 'what', 'can', 'role', 'Christ', 'John', 'account', 'least', 'human', 'Jesus', 'four', 'actor', 'difficult', 'time', 'bringing', 'Savior', 'life', 'flesh-and-blood', 'human', 'being', 'Many', 'other', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Steven', 'Russell', 'Pilate', 'large', 'number', 'crowd-scene', 'extras', 'turn', 'surprisingly', 'amateurish', 'performances.It', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'same', 'literalist', 'approach', 'Matthew', 'Mark', 'Luke', 'only', 'observe', 'how', 'would', 'deal', 'discrepancies', 'John', 'account', 'other', 'three', 'instance', 'John', 'cleansing', 'temple', 'early', 'Jesus', 'ministry', 'instead', 'start', 'Passion', 'Week', 'Synoptic', 'writers', 'do', 'Moreover', 'Matthew', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Easter', 'morning', 'learning', 'Jesus', 'resurrection', 'angel', 'empty', 'tomb', 'John', 'find', 'Jesus', 'poor', 'servant', 'high', 'priest', 'who', 'victim', 'Peter', 'sword', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'ear', 'reattached', 'here', 'Passion', 'film', 'also', 'bit', 'showing', 'Jesus', 'being', 'baptized', 'even', 'John', 'account', 'event', 'mentioned', 'recorded.The', 'movie', 'been', 'handsomely', 'shot', 'location', 'are', 'few', 'effective', 'moments', 'way', 'literal-minded', 'rigidity', 'exercise', 'up', 'draining', 'life', 'passion', 'story', 'particularly', 'contrast', 'Gibson', 's', 'work', 'crucifixion', 'here', 'so', 'utterly', 'mundane', 'undramatic', 's', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'bored', 'event', 'where', 'are', 'Matthew', 's', 'darkness', 'earthquake', 'resurrected', 'bodies', 'when', 'need', 'cinematic', 'version', 'Books', 'Tape', 'Gospel', 'John', 'might', 'be', 'appropriate', 'use', 'Sunday', 'school', 'primer', 'very', 'little', 'offer', 'way', 'inspiration', 'entertainment']",Gospel of John
803554,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B0001FT50A,Russell Fanelli,"[0, 1]","The Gospel of John stays close to the original source material but strays from the original in the tone adopted by the director for some of the words Jesus speaks, particularly when dealing with various scribes and pharisees. Some moments do require righteous anger, such as when Jesus drives the money changers from the temple. However, when Jesus speaks with the scribes and the pharisees who challenge him for healng on the Sabbath, we can expect him to take a tone more appropriate for his title as rabbi; that is, to point out the errors in the scribes understanding of what is required in the law and to gently lead them toward the truth knowing that argument is futile and beneath him.In order to believe that Jesus is the Son of God we must posit three things. First, that he has perfect love for mankind. ""God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son to suffer and die for our salvation."" Jesus knew from the beginning that death on the cross was his mission and he accepted his mission to the end and forgave his enemies with some of his last words on the cross.Second, Jesus must be the most patient of men. He knows all things including the heart of man. He loved everyone in spite of what they might have done or might do in the future and he offered forgiveness to all right to the end when he said to the good thief that he would see him in paradise that very day.Third, Jesus is completey understanding. He loves uncondtionally and has the highest regard especially for sinners such as the prodigal son. Some might argue that what is required is for the sinner to turn to Jesus for forgiveness and that the scribes and pharisees are confirmed in their sin and are unable to repent. This point of view would be a Calvinistic interpretation of the Gospel and one not warranted by the film under discussion. For God to be God, God must be love and love does not condemn but seeks endlessly to forgive. God's love is so powerful and overwhelming (see The Hound of Heaven) that it is never possible to say that salvation is impossible for anyone.For this film to be accurate, Jesus must be completely without sin -- ""one like us in all things but sin."" To be strident in tone or impatient in action would be inappropriate for Jesus and the viewer must determine if the director properly demonstrates humility and love in all that Jesus says and does.""It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eyes.""

With ""The Passion"" coming just around the corner, ""The Gospel of John"" seemed a bit overshadowed by all of the hype Mel Gibson's movie was getting. Still, I did my research, being a fan of Jesus movies, and found some pretty good reviews. I still didn't expect it to be as good as it was, and as soon as I popped the DVD into my TV I was mesmerized for the entire three hours of the movie.Henry Ian Cusick is absolutely amazing in his role of Jesus Christ. His only competition would be Robert Powell of ""Jesus of Nazareth"", but Cusick's performance was unlike any I'd seen before (and I've seen ""Jesus"" the miniseries with Jeremy Sisto, ""Jesus"" with Brian Deacon, ""Matthew"" with Bruce Marchiano, ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" with Max Von Sydow, ""King of Kings"" with Jeff Hunter, ""The King of Kings"" with H.B. Warner, ""Jesus of Nazareth"" with Robert Powell, and both versions of ""Jesus Christ Superstar""). His potrayal of Christ is absolutely effortless, which is even more impressive considering the fact that he's speaking word for word from the book of John. Not only does he do wonders with the script, but his overall interpretation of Jesus is unique and, for me, very inspiring. Cusick's Christ knows his mission and carries it out with determination, and, most of all, authority; but this doesn't hold back his human side either, and he is very believable as a loving, caring Christ (the single tear running down his face during the raising of Lazarus was so touching and convincing that it made ME cry). Some may believe that his attitude toward the Pharisees was harsh, and I'll admit that I was a bit taken back when he raised his voice more than once throughout the movie-- but as it progresses, his emotions seem appropriate for someone desperately trying to teach a message of salvation that no one seems to want to accept.The special effects were very well-done. The scene where Jesus is walking on the water is finally convincing...The only problem I had with the movie was that it seemed to shy away from the crucifixion. I was a bit disappointed at the way the movie zipped through one of the most crucial parts of the Gospel, especially with Cusick's passionate performance throughout the first couple of hours of the movie. The end result is about two hours and thirty minutes of beautiful cinematography and brilliant acting, and a really ""blah"" finale. The directors really missed the chance to make an impression by failing to utilize the most dramatic part of Christ's life. Cusick could have worked wonders with it.As for the rest of the cast, each member was perfect. Even the minor roles were believable-- the Pharisees and the people on the street gave very in-depth, and occassionally passionate, performances.""The Gospel of John"" was one of the best potrayals of Christ I have ever seen.

I love the scenes at the wedding of Cana, the woman at the well, the healing of the lame and blind men, the feeding of the 5,000, and the interaction between Jesus and the Sanhedrin and Pilate after his arrest.  One gets to know the various disciples better in this film than most.Although never stated in the dialogue of the film, the film portrays Mary Magdaline as a former prostitute who gradually changes over time (all done by the clothes she wears).  Of course, no text in the Bible ever calls Mary a prostitute.  Mary is also portrayed as being present at the Lord's Supper.  That may have been true, but it is not mentioned in the Bible.The one negative critique I have is that the character of Jesus appears more confrontational than I have viewed him.  One can either read the biblical lines in a confrontational tone of voice, or in a pleading tone of voice.  Here the film tends to take a confrontational tone in the interaction between the Jesus and the Jewish leadership.  Either way would upset the religious leaders because of Jesus' attempt to point out the inconsistencies of the leaders.

Perhaps a non-essential detail to some, it does lend all the more credibility to the research that went into this version when all other lemming productions erroneously (imo) put the nails through the hand.Not everything is perfect. A few beefs with the script...Narration is always a risk. Overall, it works; it keep things moving from tension to tension without losing momentum, but then it stops where it's most needed. The scene in the garden, important as it is, feels like it will never end, destroying all the tension of the impending doom. There are also a few times when the voice-over is gratuitous. Either too much or not enough.It's all about John's supposed POV, but we're hardly ever aware of who John is on screen. We don't see through his eyes, but hear through his narrative voice. Odd & disjointed.The ad nauseum redundancy of ""I tell you the truth"" is tiring, but again Cusick's heartfelt portrayal saves it from driving the viewer too insane.Also, the best way to stomp on the emotions of the moment is to flash back to scenes already viewed, and it seems every story about Jesus' crucifixion does this, and this version is no different.Despite these shortcomings, it gets 4 stars, thanks mostly to the obvious care and consideration for the original text, both from a historical and a spiritual perspective.

803576,A31ACI0E88ORDE,B0001FT50A,The Great White Father,"[0, 0]","I'm willing to consider the possibility that I'm being unfair to this film, but one persistent problem that makes it hard for me to be objective about it (perhaps watching on mute might help--some).  That is the fact that the translation of Scripture to be found here is just poor.  There is no attempt at poetry, at making the language beautiful--it's as mundane as you please.  Perhaps the worst example--maybe not objectively the worst, but it's the most memorable because it's repeated so much--is Jesus saying, not ""Amen, Amen, I say to you"" or its equivalent, but ""I am telling you the truth.""  Even ""I tell you in truth"" would have been better.  The point is, Jesus is speaking on His own Authority, not saying ""As Rabbi so-and-so said....""  ""Amen"" means ""so be it"", and would usually come at the end of a sentence, so His putting it at the beginning is confirming what He says before He says it--talk about radical!  But ""I am telling you the truth"" sounds like He's trying to convince others of something that He doesn't trust them to believe--for me, honestly, it's not too far akin from making Him say ""I swear to God"", something which the real Jesus said NOT to do, but to let our ""yes"" mean ""yes"" and our ""no"" mean ""no"".Worse even than this is that the action onscreen doesn't always fit the narration: like the Temple guards don't fall on their faces like the narrator tells them to do.Having said that, however, this film does give the entire Gospel of John, in some form, and so has to do something in order to make it more cinematic: for example, Chapters 15-17 are Jesus speaking a lot of prayer and such, and while it's good to hear it all, it makes a movie tedious if all we got to see was Jesus saying it.  So instead, we see some black and white flashbacks of what we've seen before, recapping it before the Passion.  At least in theory that could easily be a good choice, driving home the point of what's about to happen.And there is other good to be found here: aside from the fact that John's Gospel contains some of my favorite tales from the Gospels, like the healing of the blind man and the encounter with the Samaritan woman (and I didn't think they did a bad job here), Jesus on the Cross honestly looks like He's suffering the death of a traitor to Rome.  Oftentimes in Jesus films, I don't get that (The Passion of the Christ being a notable exception), but here I winced at my own ankles when I saw the nails in Jesus's feet!  (It didn't help that the Roman soldier squeezed one of the other men's legs before breaking them either....  *shudder*)  Again, except for the script, the Passion narrative seems to be good here for the most part--certainly better than I'd expect from a Jesus movie that looks like this.  I'm only sorry this isn't the case for the beginning of the Resurrection (especially since John's Resurrection narrative is probably my favorite)--when Mary Magdalene doesn't recognize Jesus at first, He is squatting down (as if working in the garden) and His face is obscured by a plant.  I'm sorry, but that looks phony.  Couldn't they have done something else, like do an ""over the shoulder"" of Jesus so that we don't see it's Him until He says ""Mary!"" and she recognizes Him?Because of the good, I don't like to throw out the baby with the bathwater--but there is one major flaw right from the start.  It's not in the film itself, this change to the exact translation of Scripture is to make the meaning clearer, and I don't care about that--it might even be a good thing--but it's the disclaimer at the beginning.  The disclaimer almost seems to be apologizing for the movie to the population of non-Christian Jews.  It makes sure to say that crucifixion was a Roman form of execution, not a Jewish form of execution (even though the Romans wouldn't have crucified Jesus, Who was no threat to them, if the Jews hadn't persisted, as we see here), and that there was an unprecedented amount of conflict between the early Church and the Jewish establishment at the time the Gospel of John was written.  The words alone are of little consequence but to the uninitiated, it could give the false impression that it was the conflict that prompted John to be so harsh on unbelieving Jews here, rather than being faithful to God's inspiration.  We should never apologize for the Gospel, especially not to those who don't already believe it and follow it--how then do we expect them to take it seriously?  Do we want to facilitate the false and defamatory idea that the Gospel was about defaming the Jews rather than about the Son of God turning the greatest evil into the greatest good for the sake of everyone in the world, opening Heaven even to us sinners?The change to the exact translation from Scripture is that where there are phrases like ""for fear of the Jews"" or ""My followers would have fought to keep me from being handed over to the Jews"", this film substitutes ""Jewish authorities"", which is what was actually meant, as the Evangelist, John, was himself an ethnic Jew.  The film does keep the scene where Jesus says to some faithless Jews, ""You are of your father the Devil""--and there I'm glad that they didn't cut anything out of Scripture or change it beyond a bad translation, because today's climate would be so intolerant of that phrase being said to Jews that they might not be inclined to put it into its proper context.  These Jews had boasted that they were children of Abraham, and Jesus said that if they really were, they would have Abraham's faith and do what Abraham did--indicating that He knew they didn't do so.  The point is, these Jews thought their biological ancestry was enough without doing anything--something that moderns would probably call ""racism"", although it may not have been thought of as such back then.  Either way, Jesus was condemning it as of the Devil, and so it is.(And please don't make me put up disclaimers--I'm Catholic, and ethnically Jewish, but my ethnicity shouldn't matter.  While I don't accuse anyone of hostile intent, the idea that my ethnicity matters to what I'm saying is itself intolerant and therefore hypocritical.  What I say is either true or false, whoever is saying it.  I'm not bringing up my ethnicity to escape being called an ""anti-Semite"", at least I hope not, but to show that it isn't something only an anti-Semitic Gentile would say, lest you think I would be chummy with the Klan or the neo-Nazis unless I said so.  True equality between Jews and Gentiles means that Jews are just as capable of doing good as Gentiles--no more and no less--but Jews are also just as capable of doing evil as Gentiles, no more and no less.  Hitler would have been no more or less evil than he was, if he were Jewish instead of German.  To act as if it were somehow ""anti-Semitic"" to believe that Jews are capable of such evil is to put Jews on a pedestal above Gentiles--and so ironically to follow in the footsteps of those Jesus is condemning here.)But again, beyond the disclaimer, there is nothing here to indicate that this is the ""non-Christian Jew-friendly"" Gospel, and so the viewer might find the disclaimer easy to forget, which is why I didn't give the film an even lower rating just for the disclaimer alone.  The Gospel is for everyone, and should not be tailored to fit the whims of those who don't accept it anyway.  If you don't even follow the Gospel, what makes you think you have a say in the matter?  The faith is about shaking us out of our comfort zones anyway--even believers have no say in the matter, only whether we follow it or not.Still, even though I've seen this film more than once, I don't really know if my rating is accurate.  Why not see it yourself and decide what you think?God bless you and be with you all.",3,"I'm giving this three stars as default, because I honestly don't know what the right rating would

It is the the only non-synoptic gospel and is written in a style very different from the other three gospels. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN is a movie version of the book that translates the words on the page unto the screen word by word.The film is surprisingly well done. The cast is comprised of mostly ""nameless"" actors, but they do just as good a job as any ""name"" actor could ever do. Instead of the just playing characters on the screen, the cast actually seems to be playing real people. Every expression, gaze, and movement is vivid and real. The Bible truly seems to come alive upon the screen. Also, the music of the soundtrack is well done: it doesn't overshadow the action on screen, nor is it so minor that it is insignificant. Instead, it adds to the action going on, incorporating itself as an important part of the film.Besides the acting, the I was also impressed by the props, costuming, and scenery. The movie is very accurate with the details of the era in which Jesus lived. From the clothes the actors wear, to the boats in which the disciples fish, to the way in which Jesus is crucified, many of the details appear to be historical accurate. It is the way people dressed, walked, lived, and died.In the glory days of Hollywood, Bible movies used to be made on a routine basis. The media moguls of the day knew that the Bible was rich and ripe with material that would not only make great movies, but also appeal to a large part of the population and would not offend anyone. Then the 1960s came and everything changed. Hollywood stopped making Bible pictures. They were no longer seen as being ""content"" worthy. In the past few years, Movie Land has seemed to be testing the ground again. This resurgent interest in Bible films has been lead by small, independent companies trying to make high quality films without forsaking the messages of the Bible.
