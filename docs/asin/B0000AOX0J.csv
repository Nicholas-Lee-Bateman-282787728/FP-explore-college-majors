It works as pure entertainment & it works on another level---either perception or both it's a worthy rental or purchase. You could look at it symbolically or just watch for fun. A definate (not preachy) reminder that the way you look at things can change what things are, on the road of your life. See if you can spot all the cameos; I found myself wondering if I might have missed some.---After a second viewing (once I bought it) I like this movie even more. Don't let the slight cheeseness up front fool you. Once it warms up this is a great movie. A very entertaining story & a good reminder; the way we look at things effects what we see.",5,This is a great movie,1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,753,"['really', 'liked', 'film', 'wall', 'quirky', 'fine', 'amusing', 'moments', 'plenty', 'think', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'level', 'perception', 'worthy', 'rental', 'purchase', 'could', 'look', 'symbolically', 'just', 'watch', 'fun', 'definate', 'not', 'preachy', 'reminder', 'way', 'look', 'things', 'can', 'change', 'what', 'things', 'are', 'road', 'life', 'See', 'can', 'spot', 'cameos', 'found', 'wondering', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'some.', 'second', 'viewing', 'once', 'bought', 'like', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'slight', 'cheeseness', 'up', 'front', 'fool', 'up', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'story', 'good', 'reminder', 'way', 'look', 'things', 'effects', 'what', 'see']",N/A

It's even got a cameo with Michael J. Fox in it.  If you watch the extras on the DVD you'll understand WHY there are so many famous people in the movie.  (Because money-hungry Hollywood studios refused to make the movie unless it had big names in it).  Eventually, the movie got made and I'm so glad it did (even if it went straight to DVD).  This movie has got a lot more than just famous faces in it.  It's got heart and soul and everything in between!The movie is about a guy named Neil Oliver (James Marsden) who makes a wish on his birthday (see title of this review).  Little does his know, his wish will soon come true.  (enters: Mr. O(ne).W(ish). with the monkey pipe).  He starts seeing things that aren't there, like billboards that look blank (or are they?) to everyone but him.  He meets a guy who sends him on a job to deliver a package.  The package is to be delivered to a place called ""Danver""... to which Neil says ""It's spelled wrong.""  The guy (Christopher Lloyd) tells him it's not.  His mind is just tricking him to think it's supposed to be denver, not Danver.  He tells Neil to take Interstate 60 to get there.  But there is no I-60... atleast not on any map.  He eventually finds it and thus begins the unforgettable journey of his life.I'll try not to spoil the movie for you too much, but he has many adventures on this trip (a town owned by lawyers, with lawyers work and live there ... a town with a drug called ""euphoria"" which is legal, but the people who take it get highly addicted and therefore become slaves of the people who don't take the drug, in order to get money to buy the euphoria ... a museum of art fraud, that isn't quite what it seems ... a man with a neverending (black hole) stomach ... a magic eight ball (that's really magical) ... a guy who dispises (with a passion) lying ... love, laughs, fantasy: it's even a movie that makes you think!  What more could you ask for?  I couldn't ask for anything more.This movie has had a positive impact on my life.  How many movies can you say that about?  A lot of films that are made today lack a certain depth and quality ... this movie lacks absolutely nothing.

DESTINY and THE FAMILY MAN, add a dash of TWILIGHT ZONE and BACK TO THE FUTURE, throw in a healthy portion of THE WIZARD OF OZ, shake the mix vigorously, and you'll have the recipe for Bob Gale's wonderfully inventive fantasy, INTERSTATE 60, one of the best 'indies' of 2002.A comic American tall tale of half Leprechaun/half Indian O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman, who is totally terrific!) who grants individuals one 'wish', but has a wickedly funny way of fulfilling them literally, and the young man (James Marsden) he takes a liking to, INTERSTATE 60 satirizes truth in advertising, our fixations about sex and justice, 'legalizing' drugs, and the American 'Dream', without ever becoming 'preachy' or boring. The film is as adventurous and unpredictable as the title highway of the film.Marsden is Neal Oliver, a likable 22-year old who dreams of becoming a serious painter, reads comic books, peels his grapefruit, and has visions of a gloriously beautiful fantasy woman (Amy Smart). His girlfriend and father, however, have made different plans for him, involving law school, and a 'prestige' job. While trying to decide his future, Oliver takes an assignment from the mysterious 'Ray' (Christopher Lloyd, making a welcome return to the big screen) to deliver a package to 'Danver, Colorado', via the mysterious Interstate 60. Joined by the likable, if enigmatic Grant, the young man begins a journey that will determine his destiny.With cameos by Michael J. Fox, Kurt Russell, Chris Cooper, and Ann-Margret, INTERSTATE 60 is filled with so many quirky characters and oddball situations that you may want to view it a second time, just to catch things you may have missed, the first time around.This film is a gem, vastly underrated.

Schar,"[3, 9]","I was motivated to watch this after hearing Kurt Russell talk about it on the commetary track to ""Big Trouble in Little China,"" which is fantastic, and which you should buy immediately.This movie was shot, paced and directed like a TV show.  Indeed, it was so television-like that I turned to my wife 30 minutes into it and said, hey, this is a failed pilot!  It introduces the characters, sets up the rules of the road (as it were), gives us the McGuffin (the quest for ""the answer"", which, Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy-like, has no question), and a magic Magic 8-Ball that knows the future.  Indeed, toward the end of the movie, it popped into my head that ""Interstate 60"" is just ""Sliders,"" where the alternate realities are reached by car, not by time machine.  The Amazing Reality Jumping Machine is different; the concept is not.The TV-like nature of this enterprise is not the fault of the actors, who do their best with what they're given.  Rather, the lifeless and pedantic script (did we have to learn an Afterschool Special Life Lesson (tm) every 10 minutes), clunky direction, and bloated editing suck the energy out of this film.  The exceptions are the short performances by great actors like Christopher Lloyd, Michael J. Fox and Kurt Russell.  These guys are veterans who can turn in a great performance even with crummy material and bad direction.  Indeed, these performances make the rest of the movie look even worse by comparison.This isn't an awful movie; there are some good moments, and overall I didn't want to throw things at the TV when it was over and ask for two hours of my life back.  But this film does not represent the career high point of anyone involved.

Erland,"[0, 0]","Summary: The film opens with two college age males relaxing in a bar discussing the lack of an indigenous mythic, wish granting image in America. The tales of genies, leprechauns' and yes even Santa Claus all come to us from foreign lands. What does America have to offer to this urban legend genre?A stranger overhears their discussion and disrupts their theoretical musings with a tale challenging their hypothesis. The man shares a preposterous tale about a mysterious, mystical gentlemen named O. W. (one wish) Grant (Gary Oldman), an immortal, nomadic of Indian/white mixture who roams about the landscape occasionally granting a wish to an unexpected recipient. Who knows, you may have seen him yourself, red hair, bow-tie, smoking a pipe adorned by the carved face of a monkey? Well, maybe not.The scene changes and momentarily the viewers are introduced to Neil Oliver (James Marsden), a promising art school candidate who is being pressured by his overbearing Father to go to law school. In the midst of confusion and uncertainty over his future plans in steps O. W. Grant who asks Neil what he would wish for Neil responds ""I wish for an answer to my life"". Thus begins Neil's illuminating 'vision quest' down an imaginary highway, Highway 60 where he encounters individuals and situations that grow more and more absurd the further he travels.Is Neil delusional or is it all really happening? What awaits the intrepid traveler at the end of his journey and will it be the answer to his life he expected? Leave it up to that old Trickster O. W. Grant to have plenty of surprises for both Neil and the viewer!Critique: `Interstate 60' combines the best of what one finds in independent films with an accomplished, recognizable Hollywood cast; solid acting, wholly original storyline with thought provoking dialogue and lots of quirky happenings that will keep the viewer glued to the television screen from beginning to the end. `Interstate 60' is the kind of movie I could watch over and over again!

Next you realize it is a great movie and you wonder how you had not heard of it before and why you missed it when it was released. This is one of those movies. An indie that went direct to video and will give you pause as to how in the world it didn't get better media exposure. Certain road movies transcend just the college drinking, drugs, and debauchery and move to a higher plane where self awareness and lifes lessons are intertwined into a rewarding experience you will never forget. I know the first time I saw a movie like this it changed my outlook. Sure I enjoy the off the wall Harold and Kumar type road movies, but the road scholar movies like this one can't be beat. Afterall, along with teaching you to keep an open mind and tell the truth, it will hit your funny bone quite a few times as well.A young man takes a drive on a interstate highway that isn't really on any map and meets all kinds of interesting people and learns all kinds of lessons about life. He has the fortune to have common sense which helps him through some potential pot holes. It all started with a birthday wish for answers to his life. His interest are in art but his father would like him to be a lawyer. A Native American Leprechaun, O.W. Grant, grants him his one wish. But the means by which he learns the answers are unusual and his pitstops along the way result in clever and funny experiences. Excellent story, cast, camera work, and superb directing by Bob Gale of ""Back to the Future"" fame. James Marsden and Gary Oldman do stand out roles and really make the movie fun. Good cameos by Christopher Lloyd, Paul Brogren, Michael J. Fox, Kurt Russell, Mathew Edison, Chris Cooper, and Ann-Margret. I highly recommend you add this one to your library because I doubt the price will get better and this sleeper may go out of print. Excellent quality DVD with commentary and documentary. I give it four and half stars.

It's not on any map and it is a road that holds many intersting and unique towns. All that in a way take a look at his own life and what could be.After he meets with a mysterious man named Ray (Christopher Lloyd) he agrees to do a special delivery for him to a town named Danver. The only way to get there is by taking I-60. He recieves a simple magic 8 ball that will give him the answers to his questions. But his wish is far from over, once he gets on the interstate things have just begun. Along the way he meets the trickster himself, the girl of his dreams and towns that are filled with lawyers, drug addicts and people who demand only the truth and nothing but the truth or they will blow you up. Bob Gale comes up with some of the most creative characters ever and you really do get involved in the situations that James Marsden's character finds himself in. Every decision he makes leads to a new twist, every town he comes to makes him think of what it means in his own life and nothing is really what it seems.This movie is a lot of fun and a great watch. I truly enjoyed it and am glad I purchased it. The creator of the Back to the Future series still has it and even brought in Michael J. Fox for a cameo at the begining to add to the familiarity. Just the thoughts and ideas that they pass through this movie will make any watcher think of thier own lives and how they see things in our own reality. Many cameos and many stars fill up this movie. It's a shame it never was released in theaters as I truly think it would have been a sleeper hit. But it works just as well on DVD either way.Now it's time to take a ride on Interstate 60.. a journy on a roadway like no other.

Also, the film boasts a cast of several talented actors, several good actors I usually love to watch, and yet good performances are hard to find (aside from Michael J. Fox in to small of a role). I don't know if that's because this is Bob Gale's first time in the director's chair or if everyone was just phoning it in.

Well he figures why not and spills the beans to his family and O.W. (a waiter at the restaurant).  Neal has wished for an answer.Next thing he knows he's landed a mystery job, needs to find that mysterious highway, is looking for the girl of his dreams (also a mystery to him), is meeting characters he could have only dreamed of in situations no one would ever believe if he dared to recount them.

I don't mean that as an insult, believe it or not.  It just feels like this whole thing really was better suited as an ongoing tv show and this was meant to be the early first episodes, the ones you would have thought were really cool at first - until later in the series when you looked back and thought ""wow after they got the hang of what they were doing here they really improved"".  It's the realization that 'oh yeah, it's just a movie' that somehow makes it a 4 star instead of 5.  That it just ends here and they won't keep going and improve it any.Despite some of the cheesiness here and there.  Some of the acting that was less than stellar (forgivable somehow).  It works in the end.  And the end really was the cheesiest part of it.  It just feels as I said, like it's not supposed to be a movie, but a show.  Still, hey, they got Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both to appear.  Gary Oldman plays O.W. Grant brilliantly.And as with any wish themed show - be careful what you wish for.

However, after watching this gem three times within the past week (and getting more meaning out of it each time), I felt compelled to write this review even if it gets ONE person to watch it, then this was worthwhile.(THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW)Parts of the movie are narrated, which I feel ADDS to the experience.  The movie begins with a rather deep, metaphysical/philosophical quote:  ""Given an infinite universe and infinite time, all things will happen. That means that every event is inevitable, including those that seem impossible.""This movie is NOT your typical college kid(s) drive cross country/get high/pick up girls flick.  Actually, I don't recall as much as a nude breast being shown in any part of the movie.This movie is NOT a slasher/killer/stalker flick by any stretch of the imagination.This movie is UNLIKE any movie I know exists and I'm amazed it had VERY little, if any, box-office exposure.  Some reviewers say it's ""low budget.""  Well, I suppose we were watching two different movies because I found NOTHING low budget about the way this plays and looks.  Actually, I believe the cinematography is well done.  Also, did you look at the names of the actors in this?  That's NOT low-budget although some have short scenes.  They could have easily made two additional movies based on parts of THIS movie!  The idea of a town where a drug called ""Euphoria"" (I suppose it's supposed to be like a powerful form of Ecstasy), is LEGAL and anyone 13 or older is allowed to make all of their choices and has all the rights of an 18 or 21 y/o adult, could have been a great movie plot in itself.There's only one part of the movie I didn't care for (it's about lawyers in a town).  However, that part IS important to the movie as a whole (although I feel they made that small segment look way too silly.)There's a few mysteries cleverly hidden in this movie including an unknown killer that our main character is forewarned about towards the beginning of the film.  But who is the killer?  When will the killer strike?I wish I could tell you more, but I promised no spoilers would be in this review. I WILL say that TO ME, it is sort of a mix between the classic movie, AMERICAN BEAUTY and what would be a VERY modernized, serious update of THE WIZARD OF OZ, but nowhere as corny as The Wiz of Oz!This movie has some comedy, drama, surprises, plot twists, and more.  It can be viewed ""just for the fun of it"" or because there ARE plenty of lessons about life built in.  So, if you like to ""analyze"" things, this is for you, and if you don't like to analyze movies, this is for you as well.  It's your choice.  Just PLEASE give this a view.  Lastly, keep in mind this is not one of the great movie classics of all time.  It is what it is -- and what it IS is in a category by itself.  I gave it 5/5 stars not in comparing it to Gone With the Wind; Casablanca; or ANY ""classic"" film, but because of the impact it's had on me and most others who, according to their own reviews, simply loved this film.",5,"Please, Just Watch it!

Fox, Ann-Margret, Kurt Russell--plus the talents of writer Bob Gale (Back to the Future), that this would be a darn good movie. Well, unfortunately it ain't. Back to the Future worked really well because the stakes were high--AND the viewer could FEEL that the stakes were high, because Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, perfectly cast), definitely expressed that.But here in Interstate 60, Gale (who also directed) just doesn't raise the stakes high enough. As a result, this is a relatively easy going somewhat amusing, laid back fantasy that is a nice timekiller if you don't have much else to do, but not anywhere near as punchy or sharp as Back to the Future.Here, instead of time travel (BTTF) we have an alternate universe supplied by a wacky guy, O.W. Grant, played by Gary Oldman in one of his few genial roles (frankly, he does a lot better in serious or bad guy roles)--he's really a genie in human form who grants the one wish made by our hero played by James Marsden to find an answer to his life.So our hero travels down the titular highway, which doesn't exist on any normal map, running into wacky situations and characters--most of which, to be blunt, seem cartoonish or forced. But there are a few bright spots along the way. The opening scene with Michael J. Fox is good. Chris Cooper shows up as Mr. Cody, and he does a great job.

The director, Bob Gale, was the screenwriter for Back to the Future and the star of that series, Michael J. Fox, has a cameo in this far more independent and original film. When I say &quot;original&quot; I should qualify that by pointing out that some of the elements are common. A young man named Neal (James Marsden) wants to be an artist, but his father is pressuring him to go to law school. He is granted a wish by a magical man who is part leprachaun (Gary Oldman, who I would not have recognized if he hadn't been identified). Yet Interstate 60 takes this fairly standard light fantasy theme and weaves it into a very creative and unpredictable tale of eccentric characters and bizarre circumstances.  Neal's choice of a wish is rather general: he wants answers. So he is given an 8 Ball that is uncannily accurate (though it occasionally disappoints with answers like &quot;can't really say&quot;). Neal is given a package to deliver to someone in a city called Danver (not Denver). He must take Route 60, which is not on any map. He is also hoping to meet his dream girl, who keeps appearing on billboards that appear blank to everyone else, and avoid a mysterious killer of whom he has been warned. Along the way he meets many unusual people, including a woman who is collecting sexual conquests, a man with an obsession for telling the truth that borders on insanity and a whole town full of people hooked on a drug called Euphoria (this episode can be seen as a cautionary parody of what might happen if drugs are legalized). He also visits a town run by lawyers where everyone is suing everyone else and a  &quot;fake&quot; museum where the fakes are real. These descriptions, however,  don't do justice to the film. The &quot;episodes&quot; (under the film's title at the beginning is the caption &quot;Episodes of the Road&quot;) could have come across as heavy-handed morality tales, but here they are played out in a meandering, playful way where the outcome is never obvious. Neal's objective of reaching Danver and delivering the package is of secondary importance. Even the &quot;answers&quot; he finally receives at the end, which are quite obvious, are not half as important as the road he has to literally take to find them.",4,Very original &amp; entertaining,1066176000,"10 15, 2003",2003,2426,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'rented', 'description', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'rather', 'generic', 'low', 'budget', 'comedy', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'director', 'Bob', 'Gale', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'Back', 'Future', 'star', 'series', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'cameo', 'far', 'more', 'independent', 'original', 'film', 'When', 'say', 'quot', 'original', 'quot', 'should', 'qualify', 'pointing', 'out', 'elements', 'are', 'common', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Neal', 'James', 'Marsden', 'be', 'artist', 'father', 'pressuring', 'go', 'law', 'school', 'granted', 'wish', 'magical', 'man', 'who', 'part', 'leprachaun', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'recognized', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'identified', 'Interstate', '60', 'fairly', 'standard', 'light', 'fantasy', 'theme', 'very', 'creative', 'unpredictable', 'tale', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'Neal', 'choice', 'wish', 'rather', 'general', 'answers', 'given', '8', 'Ball', 'uncannily', 'accurate', 'occasionally', 'answers', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'quot', 'Neal', 'given', 'package', 'deliver', 'someone', 'city', 'called', 'Danver', 'not', 'Denver', 'must', 'take', 'Route', '60', 'not', 'map', 'also', 'hoping', 'meet', 'dream', 'girl', 'who', 'appearing', 'billboards', 'appear', 'blank', 'everyone', 'else', 'avoid', 'mysterious', 'killer', 'whom', 'been', 'warned', 'way', 'many', 'unusual', 'people', 'including', 'woman', 'who', 'collecting', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'man', 'obsession', 'telling', 'truth', 'borders', 'insanity', 'whole', 'town', 'full', 'people', 'hooked', 'drug', 'called', 'Euphoria', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'cautionary', 'parody', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'drugs', 'are', 'legalized', 'also', 'town', 'run', 'lawyers', 'where', 'everyone', 'suing', 'everyone', 'else', 'quot', 'fake', 'quot', 'museum', 'where', 'fakes', 'are', 'real', 'descriptions', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'title', 'beginning', 'caption', 'quot', 'Episodes', 'Road', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'heavy-handed', 'morality', 'tales', 'here', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'meandering', 'playful', 'way', 'where', 'outcome', 'never', 'obvious', 'Neal', 'objective', 'reaching', 'Danver', 'delivering', 'package', 'secondary', 'importance', 'Even', 'quot', 'answers', 'quot', 'finally', 'end', 'are', 'quite', 'obvious', 'are', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'important', 'road', 'literally', 'take', 'find']",N/A

Unfortunately, it's not the life that he wants. But not having the inner strength to choose his own path, is seemingly destined for the one his domineering father has set for him as a fellow corporate lawyer.Until he makes an unusual wish at his birthday party.A wish that is overheard by one who can grant such desires.The only descendant of a lecherous Irish Leprechaun and a native Cheyenne woman is Mr. One Wish Grant, or O.W. for short. An otherworldly being that broadly fits the definition of a djinn or genie.Not a particularly innovative script, but executed with decent energy. Gary Oldman as O.W. was spritely amusing. And as usual for James Marsden - his dalliances with overacting were numerous. He's typically an uneven performer so I'm pretty much used to it now.The journey that his character takes is one of self-discovery obviously. But told through a tale of modern mysticism and its American metaphor equivalent: The Road. More specifically - Interstate 60 - a road that doesn't exist. Not unless you're looking for that last frontier; a place for lost souls, independent malcontents and Life's socially unstructured individuals.My only complaints were two fold.First, no pun intended, I wish the filmmakers had explored a bit more of the darker side; revealing more of O.W.'s chosen few. There were hints of it as they meet the-man-with-a-bottomless-stomach, who explains his life to Neal after receiving his one wish. But there weren't enough of those moments to really give us the sense that, like all historical wish givers like djinns or supernatural spirits, one should avoid taking them up on their offer; their supposed blessing typically ending up more of a curse.Second, the film often crossed over into preachy. There's something to be said about subtlety. You can often make people hear you when you're not screaming your message. It was most successful when Neal was part of the story, rather than the outside observer making comment. A perfect example of that - when he visits the Art Fraud Museum. The film would've worked better taking that approach throughout the production.Overall, a lighthearted and enjoyable film to pass the time.Movie Note:- If you like this type of film, I highly suggest screening a little known gem titled ""Roadside Prophets"".
