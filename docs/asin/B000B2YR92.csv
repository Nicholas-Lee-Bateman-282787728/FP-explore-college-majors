In this movie, her character, Holly, is very complex, she's guarded, scared of how she feels about others, & never gets what she wants.  Hilary plays this role very well, I really admired her for it.  The plot is a little silly, but very cute all the same. There are a few jokes in this movie that older kids will appreciate, but might confuse the younger kids.  Parents, beware!  Overall, it was a very cute, light, and good-hearted movie.  I watched it twice, so that must be saying something, since I watch quite a few other movies in my spare time, but I actually liked this one enough to watch it twice.

To me, the previews were not enticing whatsoever and it appeared to advertise this movie as sort of a rip-off of THE PARENT TRAP and YOU'VE GOT MAIL.I saw an advanced screening of THE PERFECT MAN this past week and came out of it feeling very impressed.  This is a movie that shows young girls that there is no such thing as the perfect man, and the movie does not attempt to give us the usual fairly-tale ending.  There are many more twists and turns in the storyline, than the previews let on.THE PERFECT MAN is a multi-dimensional movie, showing us the tangled web between a man, a daughtor, and each one trying to fix one-another up with the men they care about.  The script is sometimes predictable, but the actors do their best to make it believable. I would reccomend this movie as one that moms and their daughtors should see together.",3,wow!

935664,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B000B2YR92,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[21, 25]","This is a cute enough movie with a cute enough premise. Hilary Duff plays Holly, a girl who, along with her little sister, keeps getting shuffled around the country by their mother (Heather Locklear), who leaves a town as soon as her latest relationship hits the rocks. She simply runs away, instead of actually confronting her problems. (Real good example she's setting for the kids, huh?)Holly is sick of moving around, especially after the latest breakup has landed them in, of all places, NYC. When her mother starts dating Lenny, whom Holly perceives to be a complete loser, she concocts a scheme to send her mother flowers and love letters from ""the perfect man"" to keep her mother from going out with Lenny. Holly is helped by Ben (Chris Noth, total heartthrob), a chef who feeds Holly nothing but cheesy advice about love. Holly then realizes how simple it is: Ben IS the perfect man! Now if only she hadn't given her mom pictures of Ben and all these love letters and flowers, because all this is unbeknowst to Ben! Of course there's a guy in there for Holly, too, but, like her mother, she's terrified of getting her heartbroken.Forget the perfect man. It's not really about finding the perfect guy, it's a movie about a mother and a daughter trying to find out who they are and what exactly they want. The whole time I was practically screaming at the TV because I just wanted the mother to give it up already and be happy by herself, at least for a while. The movie's biggest flaw is not clearly showing how the mother feels. Does she like Lenny? Does she think he's stupid? I wasn't quite sure. Her actions and her words are contradicting, and I find that quite annoying. But it's still cute, and it's especially good if you're hankering for some Mr. Big.

At some points it was amusing, in others, I was rolling my eyes because the scenes were so stupid and predictable. The Perfect Man is possibly Hilary's worst film to date because she isn't showing any growth in her roles. Raise Your Voice provided she do at least one drama scene, and a couple of sad scenes after that, and that's what made the film have a perspective, make it interesting for the viewers who aren't 9-15 year old girls, which is the majority of Hilary's fan base. I have to say, I didn't like this film much and would have given it a 2 star rating, except I read reviews from her fanbase, and they liked the film better then Raise Your Voice. So, I would recommend it to anyone in her fanbase that hasn't seen it yet because it's not a bad film. It just doesn't live up to its potential. And there are some things worth noting:1) Hilary and Heather- Apparently, they got along great on the set, I'm proud. And they both proved many times in the film that they CAN act, and are one of the only things that worked in the film.2) Running Away- Yes, I'm talking about Heather's character, runs away after every bad relationship. At points, that can be quite annoying, and maybe that didn't work so well because we only see her run away once. But Hilary's character, at least they made it so she's 17, just as scared and shy, but hasn't gone on dates or had boyfriends before, because in reality, shy people run away from that stuff and I think that's the only thing that worked in this plot.The Bad Things:The Plot- It's so weak and they don't build it up enough to make it interesting.The Other Actors- Yes, I found the gay sarcasm guy quite annoying. And Chris North's acting was stale.And the worst of all:The Ending- Oh my god, it was so lame, if your going to do a film like this, your suppose to build it up so that in the end, people like Heather's character have build up self esteem and they stop running away. But no, they went for the cheesy, oh maybe it'll work, relationship. And the Hilary almost break up scene with the supposable Mr. ""Right"", was just lame.Plus, add a bunch of cheesy twists to it, I personally didn't like it, but I think everyone in her fan base will, so I'll recommend it to them! And god bless, I hope Hilary changes her roles in the future because I want her to be around for a long time in this business, she doesn't even have to be the villain, just make it more entertaining then the same crap she keeps giving us.",3,A Tale with alot of Potential,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,2524,"['ways', 'liked', 'film', 'other', 'ways', 'hated', 'points', 'was', 'amusing', 'others', 'was', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'stupid', 'predictable', 'Perfect', 'Man', 'possibly', 'Hilary', 'worst', 'film', 'date', ""n't"", 'showing', 'growth', 'roles', 'Raise', 'Your', 'Voice', 'provided', 'do', 'least', 'one', 'drama', 'scene', 'couple', 'sad', 'scenes', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'have', 'perspective', 'make', 'interesting', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", '9-15', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'majority', 'Hilary', 'fan', 'base', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'given', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'read', 'reviews', 'fanbase', 'liked', 'film', 'better', 'then', 'Raise', 'Your', 'Voice', 'So', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'fanbase', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'are', 'things', 'worth', 'noting:1', 'Hilary', 'Heather-', 'Apparently', 'got', 'along', 'great', 'set', ""'m"", 'proud', 'proved', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'CAN', 'act', 'are', 'one', 'only', 'things', 'worked', 'film.2', 'Running', 'Away-', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Heather', 'character', 'away', 'bad', 'relationship', 'points', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'only', 'see', 'run', 'away', 'once', 'Hilary', 'character', 'least', 'made', '17', 'just', 'scared', 'shy', ""n't"", 'gone', 'dates', 'had', 'boyfriends', 'before', 'reality', 'shy', 'people', 'run', 'away', 'stuff', 'think', 'only', 'thing', 'worked', 'plot.The', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Plot-', 'so', 'weak', 'do', ""n't"", 'build', 'up', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting.The', 'Other', 'Actors-', 'Yes', 'found', 'gay', 'sarcasm', 'guy', 'quite', 'annoying', 'Chris', 'North', 'acting', 'was', 'stale.And', 'worst', 'Ending-', 'Oh', 'god', 'was', 'so', 'lame', 'going', 'do', 'film', 'suppose', 'build', 'up', 'so', 'end', 'people', 'Heather', 'character', 'have', 'build', 'up', 'self', 'esteem', 'stop', 'running', 'away', 'went', 'cheesy', 'oh', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'work', 'relationship', 'Hilary', 'almost', 'break', 'up', 'scene', 'supposable', 'Mr.', 'Right', 'was', 'just', 'lame.Plus', 'add', 'bunch', 'cheesy', 'twists', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'everyone', 'fan', 'base', 'will', 'so', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'god', 'bless', 'hope', 'Hilary', 'changes', 'roles', 'future', 'want', 'be', 'around', 'long', 'time', 'business', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'be', 'villain', 'just', 'make', 'more', 'entertaining', 'then', 'same', 'crap', 'giving']",N/A

This is what I have to say: I watched this film with my lovely fiancee; it was her turn to pick what we watched. Normally, I'm a kind of open minded guy. Maybe your boyfriend is, too. I even like ""chick flicks"" if they're good. This movie? Ehhh... this one wasn't that great for me. No action. No sex. No broad comedy. No suspense. But there's lots of discussion of women's difficulties in dating, and the romantic potential of different types of flowers, and there's a scene where all of the girls in the movie dance together in their socks (not sexy dance; cutesy dance). There's just not a lot here for the average guy to sink his teeth into, and a lot that will put him off.My advice is: find some other movie for your date night together--there are lot's of romantic comedies that both sexes can enjoy (do you know whether he's seen When Harry Met Sally yet?).

935680,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,B000B2YR92,Frodo,"[5, 5]","Firstly, don't get me wrong, I actually really like Hilary Duff. I think she's a nice enough person for someone who's young and got Young Hollywood at her command, and she IS actually a pretty good singer. But something that Hilary lacks is the ability to choose unique and diverse scripts. This must be the fifth or sixth movie she's made since she graduated from the hit Disney sit-com ""Lizzie McGuire"" and not once yet, has she portrayed anyone other than the teenaged damsel in distress.And this movie, ""The Perfect Man"" is no acception.The story is simple. Sixteen-year-old Holly Hamilton has spent her life shifting her life all over the United States due to her mother's inability to secure a good relationship. Now, in her latest zip code of Brooklyn, New York, Holly is dertermined for her, and her mother to stay grounded for at least a little while. WIth the help of her friends Uncle Ben, Holly creates for her mum the illusion of ""the perfect man"", but along the way finds that life isn't all that simple.Despite a great supporting cast - Chris Noth, who's most famously known as Mr Big on ""Sex and the City"", Heather Locklear, and ""Queer Eye's"" Carson Kressly - the film is swarming with tedious cliches and an unrealistic script. It mars the otherwise important message of the film - that running from your problems will only make things worse. Hilary Duff is a good actress, with a lot of potential, and many successful years ahead of her. I just wish she'd choose more meaty and original scripts that will bring her talent to life.However, I gave this movie three stars for a reason. It IS a fairly good film for a Friday night after a hard day's work. It's pleasant, no mistaking, and it WILL generate quite a few little giggles throughout. Carson Kressly is halarious as the gay bartender, whose real-life fashion expertise leaks through onto the screen. And I personlly, being a HUGE ""sex and the City"" fan, love seeing my Mr Big in films, so on that front I enjoyed it.""The Perfect Man"" suffers from predictability and a flawed script. However die-hard fans of Hilary Duff will love it and the array of loved recognisable faces will add a spark.

935681,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000B2YR92,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","THE PERFECT MAN is another one of those fluff romantic comedies that just keep recycling - single mom and pseudorebellious daughter make everything work after plotted plans go astray.  This is one of those films that you rent because the video store is closing and you need a somnolent-inducing DVD. But in the case of THE PERFECT MAN there are some nice surprises!Jean Hamilton (Heather Locklear) is a 40ish single mom who bakes specialty cakes and can't land a man.  Whenever she gets close to a commitment or when she is passed by, she runs, family in tow, to a new city, new friends, new opportunities to find a man before she is too old.  Her daughters Holly (Hilary Duff) age 16 and little Zoe (Aria Wallace) go along with the transplanting moves, understanding and supportive of their mother but yearning for some permanence.  The newest move is to Brooklyn: Jean is welcomed back to a bakery of friends, Holly finds reasons to like her new school (friends female and male) and Zoe starts on a run toward a spelling bee.  Since Jean is so desperate for a man, she is swept off her feet by a fellow baker who is sweet but otherwise fairly low on the food chain.  Holly and her new friend Amber (Michelle Nolden) plan a way to capture Jean's attention from a created secret lover, their information comes from Amber's restauranteur Uncle Ben (Chris Noth) who tells them the secrets to winning a woman's heart.Let the games begin: first flowers, then gifts, then letters, then email, then IM, and Jean feels as though there really is someone special out there who loves her.  But as all games go, this one has its successes and major failures and as Holly grows to understand her mother's dilemma, she finds her own in her reluctance to accept the fact that her friend Adam (Ben Feldman) has fallen for her and wants her around.  From that point it is a comedy of errors until the final frames where, as expected, all works out for the best for everyone.Shallow, yes. Been there, done that, yes. But the surprise is the growth of Heather Locklear as an actress!  She has come along ways from her 'Dynasty'/'Melrose Place' days as basically set decor and has accepted her age gracefully, coupling that with a nuanced acting ability that makes her a welcome 'newcomer' to the screen.  She is worth sitting through this little yawner, making it come alive every time she is on screen.

She is not a cheap Barbie doll of unbelieveable plastic proporsions, but a young woman with real feelings, and a heart that needs a man's love.Being a fan since her 'Come Clean' video, and even 'The Lizzy McGuire Movie', but without having seen any of her previous 'Lizzy McGuire' TV series. I am reminded of a scene in the film of a wet nature, that I find harps back to one of Hilary's similar moments in time. I also feel any new or continuing fans of Hilary Duff should look upon this film with a fresh approach. Just as we all clean ourselves daily either in the way of a bath or shower, I find it refreshing to mention and remember this music video. To me it is the time her sound became more mature and showed real promise as she metamorphosed before my very eyes and the world into music. It is still one of my favorite videos. This is unlike any Hilary Duff film you've seen before, yet still has the ever endearing quality that is part of Hilary Duff's lovable nature that I for one adore about her. Her body image is irresistible, and I wouldn't want her to change it for the world. There is so much to love about Hilary Duff. I can't imagine anyone willing to admit they absolutely hate her, and are not in the slightest bit interested in what it is that has cast so many loyal fans under her spell. A spell so potent, any fan would gladly follow her lead. With Hilary's ear so in tune with her loyal fans' thoughts, she will make music wherever she goes. In fact there is no magic involved, what you see is what you get. There is no facade when it comes to Hilary Duff. Take her or leave her. If you take her, like the red pill of 'The Matrix' films, you are in for a life altering experience, like something you might experience at parties. The only difference is Hilary Duff is a totally safe addiction for anyone. If you take the blue pill then nothing more then this review will try to convince you that this is the perfect film for you and that Hilary is the perfect woman for the role.I encourage you all to take Hilary's hand as she leads you the viewer into her character Holly's world. You'll think all of your Christmases have come at once, and you wont need a James Bond film or Denise Richards to convice you. 'The Perfect Man' is right here.No matter what made you fall in love with Hilary Duff to begin with, you are sure to fall in love with her again as she continues her journey into womanhood.Gone are Hilary's songs that so often have accompanied her latest films. You'd think this would spell the end of Hilary Duff's film career, but it is the lack of a hit song from her that makes this film stand out above her others. This is only one factoring change you'll find nestled into the fabric of 'The Perfect Man', to make this film better then the rest, depending on your opinions of her previous films. Every man in different, and so should every film.For anyone distressed at the lack of a hit single from Hilary Duff in this film remember she is a singer first, and an actress second. She will always have a new song out. No bad reviews will ever change that.Like the prom dress bodice like a luscious red rose, her character Holly longs to wear to a dance, Hilary Duff's acting is in full bloom here, and as such should be nurtured, and admired like a beautiful flower in a ray of sunshine, among dark rain clouds.The sky is really the limit for Hilary now, and it is no wonder to me she has gained superstar status, with a voice that's out of this world, and an acting career to match.So consider if you will, the appealing idea of Holly (Hilary Duff) going online and dealing with the untrustworthy world of the internet. All this for the benefit of her lonely, single mother Jean, (Heather Locklear) who just wants a man in her life, and will jump at the slightest hope of interest in her. Jean is so focused on getting a man, she is oblivious to the obvious embarrassment her daughter Holly suffers constantly thanks to her. Add the ever regular relocation adustments Holly must make every time one of her mother's relationships turns sour. Only then will you begin to see the basis of Hilary Duff's latest character, and hopefully appreciate the shades of gray, and choices she makes to get her life in order for everyone.I really think Heather Locklear could have stepped out from the end of her earlier film 'Uptown Girls' into this one. It's great to see. I'm glad I could find a theme for her previous character, even though this is a totally original film and not a sequel of any kind.Life can get complex and sometimes comic, and we don't always get things right, so we should draw from life's experiences and see where life draws us, and then untimately who it leads us to. I am thrilled to share the world with Hilary Duff. She'd be the perfect girl to wake up to every morning. I wouldn't want anyone to walk down the aisle of my wedding but Hilary Duff. I am The Perfect Man to her. It is however up to everyone who watches or owns this film, totally up to them who Hilary Duff might call her 'Perfect Man'. The fun of this being a film is it could be anyone, so no matter who Hilary Duff ultimately chooses in her real life, we'll all have a chance at being the one for this very special young woman. Until death do I part with your film Hilary...and not a moment before.",5,Everyone should find 'The Perfect Man' and the perfect woman in Hilary Duff,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,5689,"['fully',

This movie is quite relaxing, somewhat funny and of course, with a lot of romance in it.  Also, Hilary Duff suits to act this kind of relaxing and romantic movies.  Do you guys remember the movie ""A Cinderella Story"" one year ago?  This is just as relaxing as this, but just the movie type has changed.  Last year of ""A Cinderella Story"" is a totally relaxing teen, high school and a romantic movie.  But for this one, it is about the single mother family.  All right, let get it right down to main factors.  For the story, it is okay.  It talks about Hilary Duff (as Holly Hamilton) is tired to live with a single mom, she plans to help her single mom (Heather Locklear as Jean Hamilton) to plan to find a perfect man for her.  Holly finds out Uncle Ben (Chris Noth) and decides to know each other.  For the acting, Heather Locklear as Jean Hamilton is so-so.  However, Hilary Duff as Holly Hamilton is very good.  Just like her previous Cinderella movie, she can act it good in all her happy and sad looks.  Also, for Aria Wallace as Zoe Hamilton, she is okay but she can act a bit better.  For the direction, it is okay.  This movie see a total ""okay"" range so the direction wouldn't be bad or ""off the standard"".  Also, this movie gives me not much surprise for the visual.  As this movie is a romantic comedy, it is not bad.  I can say it is average.  However, for the music, it is totally a bomb.  It is quite good because it is like a good feeling in every scene when I hear it during movies and movies.  For the sound effects, not much surprise for me, it is in average.  So, since this movie is so relaxing and romantic, it is okay to watch it.  Nice movie.

Imagine a teenager lecturing this hardworking, single mom about the mom's self-centered attitude (""Why don't you ever think of ME?!!"") and then flying tearfully into her beautifully appointed room and going on line on her expensive laptop to write about her terrible mother on her ""blog"". You get the idea.Fraught with terrible dialog, dreadful mugging performances, unconvincing situations, more plot holes than pot holes on Riverside Drive in the Spring, this film caused even the teenagers watching with me to groan and writhe and predict the predictable events to come.Ms. Locklear's performance is flat and dull while Duff's performance is even worse than one might expect with her big, pouty mouth and her overly made up eyes constantly threatening a good cry. Well, bring it on you big spoiled baby because no one cares. Oh, and Chris North, who plays ""The Perfect Man"" looks more like a one man tribute to ""The Munsters"" as he lumbers cluelessly around his apartment like Herman while looking faintly like a younger version of Grandpa, (look at his face and project ahead 10 or 20 years and see if you don't see the resemblance).This film is cloying, pointless and anything but entertaining.

If you're okay with that, then you'll probably be able to enjoy this movie at least somewhat. However, if you're very anti-teen-movies, then you should probably sit this one out.Hilary Duff gets top billing in this film over costars Heather Locklear and Chris Noth. Duff plays Holly, a high school student who is forced to deal with a slightly flakey mother, Jean (Locklear). Every time one of Jean's relationships doesn't work out (which happens quite often), she packs up her two daughters and forces them to move across the country in search of a fresh start. Eventually Holly gets sick of all the moving and she decides to put a stop to things once her family gets settled in Brooklyn. With the help of her friend Amy (Vanessa Lengies) and Amy's uncle Ben (Noth), Holly invents a secret admirer for her mother in hopes of boosting her mom's confidence and keep the family grounded in one city for more than a couple of weeks. Holly has to resort to drastic measures to keep her scheme alive and protect Jean's happiness. To make matters more complicated, Holly soon discovers that Ben is actually a perfect match for her mother, but any chance of them getting together has been ruined because of Holly's lies and deception.There are some aspects of the film that really annoyed me. Locklear's character is incredibly wishy-washy and the movie failed to showcase her talents as an actress. Noth's character is charming, but it's a shame that he and Locklear only have about two minutes of screen time together. Also, Holly's seven-year-old sister Zoe is the freakiest little child on the planet and I cringed every time she popped up on the screen. Why did they have to cast such a creepy kid?!Overall, ""The Perfect Man"" is a cute little movie.

Heather Locklear is great, and while I'm generally not a fan of Hilary Duff, she's not so bad here, but I would've liked to have seen the little sister more often, which probably would have added a little more comedic relief if the writers had played their cards right.Either way, there's great chemistry between all the actors, which is part of what makes this movie so great, you really believe they're a family.Overall, this movie is fun and entertaining, it's a great way to spend a saturday or sunday afternoon.  While it's not exactly oscar material (then again, after this year's oscars, who knows...), but it's still a movie that's worth seeing.  It's a guaranteed good time.But while this movie is seemingly sweet, when you think about it, what at the same time makes this movie entertaining, fun and builds the drama to come, also gives this movie a somewhat creepy and relatively scary turn.I know that when there's these types of mother-daughter relationships, they're extremely close and become best friends (Gilmore Girls balances it out perfectly), here the daughter kind of crosses a certain line, actually become her mother's boyfriend and having intimate e-mail conversations with her, which for me is a little disturbing.  Also, you could ask why Locklear doesn't appear more concerned that some guy fell in love with her within a week and pretty much stalks her, and you could ask yourself why she doesn't seem more suspicious of the fact that he's never actually shown his face to her (sending a picture isn't really a great way to get validation that he's not a total psycho)There's also the underlying message that the internet isn't extremely safe either...the daughter passing as the man who's in love with the mother...message : anyone can pretend to be someone else.Also what surprised me with this movie is how forgiving the mother is, it didn't seem too realistic.Despite all of this, if you don't look too much into it and don't question the whole ""perfect man"" concept thrown in, I think you're in for a good time with this (relatively) innocent movie about mother-daughter relationships, which is rare in today's movies.",4,Somewhat less than perfect,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,2341,"['second', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'like', 'watch', 'movie', 'twice', 'get', 'bigger', 'picture', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'admit', 'really', 'liked', 'it.This', 'really', 'sweet', 'movie', 'Locklear', 'great', ""'m"", 'generally', 'not', 'fan', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'here', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'sister', 'more', 'often', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'little', 'more', 'comedic', 'relief', 'writers', 'had', 'played', 'cards', 'way', 'great', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'really', 'believe', ""'re"", 'family.Overall', 'movie', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'great', 'way', 'spend', 'saturday', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'not', 'exactly', 'oscar', 'material', 'then', 'again', 'year', 'oscars', 'who', 'still', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'guaranteed', 'good', 'time.But', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'sweet', 'when', 'think', 'what', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'drama', 'come', 'also', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'relatively', 'scary', 'turn.I', 'know', 'when', 'types', 'mother-daughter', 'relationships', ""'re"", 'extremely', 'close', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'balances', 'out', 'perfectly', 'here', 'daughter', 'kind', 'crosses', 'certain', 'line', 'actually', 'become', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'having', 'intimate', 'e-mail', 'conversations', 'little', 'disturbing', 'Also', 'could', 'ask', 'why', 'Locklear', ""n't"", 'appear', 'more', 'concerned', 'guy', 'fell', 'love', 'week', 'pretty', 'much', 'stalks', 'could', 'ask', 'why', ""n't"", 'seem', 'more', 'suspicious', 'fact', 'never', 'actually', 'shown', 'face', 'sending', 'picture', ""n't"", 'really', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'validation', 'not', 'total', 'psycho', 'also', 'underlying', 'message', 'internet', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'safe', 'daughter', 'passing', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'mother', 'message', 'anyone', 'can', 'pretend', 'be', 'someone', 'else.Also', 'what', 'surprised', 'movie', 'how', 'forgiving', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'realistic.Despite', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'whole', 'perfect', 'man', 'concept', 'thrown', 'think', ""'re"", 'good', 'time', 'relatively', 'innocent', 'movie', 'mother-daughter', 'relationships', 'rare', 'today', 'movies']",N/A

It's not that Jean is a perfectionist, because if that were her problem then it would be her doing the breaking up, but the men find a way to undermine and sabotage the relationship. In a subtler way, Locklear is subconsciously picking men who will disappoint her, not because they aren't perfect, but because they are bounders of one sort or another, fly-by-nights, heartbreakers. It can be argued that perfectionists find ways to undermine their own happiness by behaving in just this way, however, I believe Jean isn't that character. Furthermore, everyone knows - or should know - one doesn't need a ""perfect man"" to conquer this addiction, one needs to have the inner strength to tell this kind of man to take a hike and to be more aware and observant of the guys who aren't that way. I have found that therapy is the only way to go for someone like Jean who is as broken as they come.Then, the way it is handled here is just clumsy, not funny, and so unlikely that the suspension of disbelief requires the help of the same architects who designed the Golden Gate Bridge. Movies based upon mix-ups and misunderstandings are common, of course, as this trope has been used in books and plays for centuries, sometimes quite successfully. Here it looks threadbare. But the cruelty against the kids here is played for laughs, and that is because the screenwriters clearly don't think that there is an underlying, fundamentally sick quality to it. They think it's just always the case: women get screwed over by bad men, not that the women to whom this happens are not dealing with the fundamental problem of sabotaging themselves. Wait, I'm not through...A secret admirer who claims he is in love with a woman he has never spoken to and who knows nothing of him is called a stalker. This isn't the 1800's when women took a more innocent look at love, and further, trying to play Jean off as someone from another century doesn't work. Caroline Rhea enters a few lines from the real world about just this other side of things, not that it does any good. 2 stars only because I really like the Locklear girl.OK, I'm done.

935707,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000B2YR92,Terry Mesnard,"[3, 4]","Romantic comedies are hard beasts to review.  Romantic comedies staring Hilary Duff when you aren't in your pre-teens or teens are even harder to review.  And, to get my biases out of the way, add to this the fact that I don't particularly like most romantic comedies and you got yourself a problem.What we have is the basic lie structure for romantic comedies.  The one where someone tells a lie (see She's All That et al) that, in this case, was to help someone out.  And of course, we all know that if you tell one large lie you have to keep making up equally exagerated lies in order to keep your first lie from being found out.  And this, of course, finds the protagonist in various zany and increasingly hard to get out of situations.  And of course, there's the double love interests and the mid point where the lie finally backfires and they must pick up the pieces until ultimately they get back together and realize that they are all meant for each other (in this case a double set for both Hilary Duff and her mother, Heather Locklear).But what makes romantic comedies enjoyable is the ride from plot point to plot point.  Yes, almost all romantic comedies follow the very cliched and very formulaic plot structure (see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for one that doesn't exactly) but it is the ride and the coming together of the plot points that makes for an ""enjoyable"" (if one likes the genre) ride.  In this case, for the most part the ride isn't that great.It's merely an average film with a couple genuinely humorous moments.  But the plot and the ride it goes on is just too implausible as it continues to warrant a must see film.  It's simply a semi-enjoyable teenie film.Finally, what most (not all but 95% of them) romantic movies do offer is a situation that, in the end, resolves everything in a nice and neat bow.  And there's something to be said for a movie that offers a brighter future.  Yes, it may be cliched and the creative wells exhausted, but sometimes it's needed.  Sometimes, a movie where everything, regardless of the odds, all ends with everyone's feelings fixed.  If so, then you might find some enjoyment here.

Zoe, Locklear's youngest ""daughter"" is adorable and I can't wait to see her in more movies.It's a good heart warmer!",5,"Fluffy, Cute, and Heart Warming",1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,550,"['go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'fluffy', 'cute', 'heart', 'warming', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'are', 'expecting', 'dramatic', 'masterpiece', 'then', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'disappointed.I', 'needed', 'good', 'chick', 'flick', 'sit', 'down', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'too', 'perfect', 'worked', 'have', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'mom', 'make', 'good', 'team', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'movie', 'Zoe', 'Locklear', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'adorable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'more', 'movies.It', 'good', 'heart', 'warmer']",N/A

I was actually really looking forward to this movie, but after discovering what this movie has to offer through reviews, I probably will never see it, not even when it comes out in rental stores or the dollar theater.I'll give you my reasons:1. After reading the review on [...] I came to the conclusion that this movie should be rated PG-13 and is not really a family film.2.  There is a gay guy cast as one of the main characters and this kind of behavior should not be endorsed.3.  From what I've heard about this movie, it sounds bland, boring and a movie that should be skipped.So there are my reasons.  Please save your money and don't go see this movie.  Instead, see one of Duff's other movies such as Raise Your Voice, A Cinderella Story, Cheaper By the Dozen, Cadet Kelly, or Lizzie Mcguire.  I hope that the next time Hilary Duff will not compromise and be in a movie as terrible as this one.",1,"Yeah, whatever....",1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,937,"['am', 'actually', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'fan', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'discovering', 'what', 'movie', 'offer', 'reviews', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'out', 'rental', 'stores', 'dollar', 'theater.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'reasons:1', 'reading', 'review', '[', ']', 'came', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'not', 'really', 'family', 'film.2', 'gay', 'guy', 'cast', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'kind', 'behavior', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'endorsed.3', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'bland', 'boring', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'skipped.So', 'are', 'reasons', 'Please', 'save', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'Instead', 'see', 'one', 'Duff', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Raise', 'Your', 'Voice', 'A', 'Cinderella', 'Story', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'Cadet', 'Kelly', 'Lizzie', 'Mcguire', 'hope', 'next', 'time', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'will', 'not', 'compromise', 'be', 'movie', 'as', 'terrible', 'one']",N/A
