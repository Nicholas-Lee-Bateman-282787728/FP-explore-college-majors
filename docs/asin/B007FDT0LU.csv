1530226,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B007FDT0LU,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 3]","Once Upon A Time In Anatolia is a great film, and I want to end this review of it by returning to the idea that this is Ceylan's greatest film, and explaining why. Aside from the fact that, technically, its screenplay is the deepest and broadest, in terms of including great dialogue, and narrative ellipses, as well, the film has the most roiling narrative, and the best example of this is the fact that Ceylan employs, better than all but a few films, the Hitchcockian idea of the MacGuffin- or the seeming narrative element that propels the art (and its protagonist(s)) whereas, in reality, the real element that is central to the art is something else. Some critics have noticed this element in the film but have targeted the wrong MacGuffin, claiming that the murder itself is the MacGuffin, but it's clearly not, as the body is found 90 minutes into the film- over an hour from its end, therefore there has to be another element that acts as the de facto carrot for the narrative impulse. It is, like the claims that the film is a police procedural, simply false. The murder merely provides the milieu of the film for it becomes clear, within the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film that the characters are not really driven by the murder, and most, in fact, seem bored or disgusted or tired of it. They each have their own reasons for being there- mostly duty or remuneration. The real MacGuffin comes into the film in the form of the aforementioned gorgeous woman tale that rapts the prosecutor and doctor. It enters the film at the time that, in more plot driven works, a `big revelation' would be due. As would be expected in a lesser work, we get hints that the murder of the dead man is something more than portrayed, for we get a comment from the prosecutor about how women get their revenge on men, we get an even earlier comment on the negative nature of the dead man, implying that his murder was somehow justified (and may explain the doctor's later cover up of the actual cause of death re: the dead man's being buried alive), and we get to suspect that the dead man may have been abusive to the wife, which may have culminated in her presumed affair with Kenan- if he is to be believed that he is the father of the widow's child. But, unlike a Hollywood film, none of this is spelt out linearly, but implied, requiring Negatively Capable abilities to thread it together. But, the main point is that, sans the gorgeous woman trope, the viewer would not have the insights into those characters re: their own failures in sexual relationships, and their abilities and weaknesses in doing their own jobs. The film raises ambiguity to an artistic level because it's not ambiguity for its own sake, but as a tool to craft character, to move plot, and to deliver a philosophic message that goes beyond platitudes of depth and mystery and the like. In short, Ceylan learned from his Three Monkeys error of relying on a formula to get to the nub of a matter, and instead dive full bore into existence itself, to pull character out, and in turn craft narrative from. It is in this taffy twist of the artist that his art rose to new heights, and Once Upon A Time in Anatolia is a candy to stain the tongue. Here's hoping that future twists augur even greater rise.",5,Great,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,3276,"['Once', 'A', 'Time', 'Anatolia', 'great', 'film', 'want', 'end', 'review', 'returning', 'idea', 'Ceylan', 'greatest', 'film', 'explaining', 'why', 'Aside', 'fact', 'technically', 'screenplay', 'deepest', 'broadest', 'terms', 'including', 'great', 'dialogue', 'narrative', 'ellipses', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'most', 'roiling', 'narrative', 'best', 'example', 'fact', 'Ceylan', 'better', 'few', 'films', 'Hitchcockian', 'idea', 'MacGuffin-', 'seeming', 'narrative', 'element', 'art', 'protagonist', 'whereas', 'reality', 'real', 'element', 'central', 'art', 'something', 'else', 'critics', 'have', 'noticed', 'element', 'film', 'have', 'targeted', 'wrong', 'MacGuffin', 'claiming', 'murder', 'MacGuffin', 'clearly', 'not', 'body', 'found', '90', 'minutes', 'film-', 'hour', 'end', 'therefore', 'be', 'element', 'de', 'facto', 'carrot', 'narrative', 'impulse', 'claims', 'film', 'police', 'procedural', 'simply', 'false', 'murder', 'merely', 'milieu', 'film', 'clear', 'first', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'driven', 'murder', 'most', 'fact', 'seem', 'bored', 'disgusted', 'tired', 'have', 'own', 'reasons', 'being', 'there-', 'mostly', 'duty', 'remuneration', 'real', 'MacGuffin', 'film', 'form', 'aforementioned', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'tale', 'prosecutor', 'doctor', 'film', 'time', 'more', 'plot', 'driven', 'big', 'revelation', 'would', 'be', 'due', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'lesser', 'work', 'get', 'hints', 'murder', 'dead', 'man', 'something', 'more', 'portrayed', 'get', 'comment', 'prosecutor', 'how', 'women', 'get', 'revenge', 'men', 'get', 'even', 'earlier', 'comment', 'negative', 'nature', 'dead', 'man', 'implying', 'murder', 'was', 'somehow', 'justified', 'may', 'explain', 'doctor', 'later', 'cover', 'actual', 'cause', 'death', 're', 'dead', 'man', 'being', 'buried', 'alive', 'get', 'suspect', 'dead', 'man', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'abusive', 'wife', 'may', 'have', 'culminated', 'presumed', 'affair', 'Kenan-', 'be', 'believed', 'father', 'widow', 'child', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'none', 'spelt', 'out', 'linearly', 'implied', 'requiring', 'Negatively', 'Capable', 'abilities', 'thread', 'together', 'main', 'point', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'trope', 'viewer', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'insights', 'characters', 're', 'own', 'failures', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'abilities', 'weaknesses', 'doing', 'own', 'jobs', 'film', 'ambiguity', 'artistic', 'level', 'not', 'ambiguity', 'own', 'sake', 'tool', 'craft', 'character', 'move', 'plot', 'deliver', 'philosophic', 'message', 'platitudes', 'depth', 'mystery', 'like', 'short', 'Ceylan', 'learned', 'Three', 'Monkeys', 'error', 'relying', 'formula', 'get', 'nub', 'matter', 'instead', 'dive', 'full', 'bore', 'existence', 'pull', 'character', 'turn', 'craft', 'narrative', 'taffy', 'twist', 'artist', 'art', 'rose', 'new', 'heights', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'Anatolia', 'candy', 'stain', 'tongue', 'Here', 'hoping', 'future', 'twists', 'augur', 'even', 'greater', 'rise']",N/A

Instead, OUATIA is a Turkish inaction mesmerizer.Very little actually happens in the movie: a group of law officers drive through the nighttime countryside with two suspects, looking for a victim's body.  I won't disclose any more about the specifics of the plot than that, but it suffices to say that by the end of the movie, not much has actually happened.  Instead, OUATIA casts a spell over the viewer by slowing down time and inducing the state-of-mind that the human brain gets into at around 3am during an all-nighter.  When one's tired body is pulling the mind towards sleep, and the mind is not quite sure if the thoughts it is experiencing are reality or a dream or a hallucination - that is the state that OUATIA induces in the viewer.A key means of achieving this state is the cinematography of OUATIA, which beautifully captures the hauntingly spare countryside of Anatolia, Turkey at night.  To allow the scenery to cast its spell, Director Nuri Bilge Ceylan and his crew do not film the actors in harsh lighting, which would cause the background scenery to turn black by contrast.  Rather, the lighting on the subjects is dim, and they somehow cast or capture enough light on the background scenery to have it show up as a rich moving canvas, with grasses and leaves moving in the breeze.  The effect is truly mesmerizing.OUATIA is mostly concerned with the relationships between the men who set out on this journey.  Because of the setting, it almost seems as though this small band of men has embarked upon a journey together across the ocean, with no contact with the rest of humanity for an extended time.  Yet a strict hierarchy of roles is maintained.  There is also a major power shift between the police chief, the prosecutor and the doctor, as each in turn takes charge as the primary person leading the investigation.  The law enforcement officials have different views of the crime and the criminals, and whose view is ultimately correct is a matter of debate.  There is an interesting twist at the end which calls into doubt this entire quest for the truth.  It is left as an exercise for the viewer to determine why this twist happens and what it means.OUATIA casts a spell and expects the viewer to think and fill in the blanks.

When I saw that his latest movie hit the theatre, I couldn't wait to see it (saw it the Landmark E Street theatre in Washington).""Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"" (2011 release from Turkey; 150 min.) bring the (apparently based on true events) story of a group of men trying to finish off a murder investigation by locating the body of the victim in the Anatolian region of Turkey. The movie starts at dusk and covers the next 24 hrs. The group (traveling in 3 cars) go from one geographic area to the next as the confessed killer tries to remember where exactly he buried the victim, but he has trouble recalling the exact setting, as he was drunk when he murdered the victim. But eventually, they come to the right spot. The body is taken to the village for a final autopsy. I am leaving some details out, but that is pretty much the main story of the movie. Generally, I don't post the entire plot of the movie in my reviews but I make an exception here, because the story line is not the main point of the movie. Indeed, the movie is instead a study of characters, and simply observes. Check out the scene where, when the group takes a break and has dinner in a local outpost, the beautiful teenage daughter of the houselord brings out tea for the group. That scene alone (which probably takes about 10 min. or so) is worth watching the movie for in and of itself, just outstanding.I don't know how well this movie will translate onto DVD as seeing it in the theatre transfixes you on the incredible job that Ceylan does in bringing this character study into focus, and the Anatolian scenry plays a huge part in the movie and surely will get lost some on the small screen. With this movie, Ceylan takes ""slow developing"" to another level, but I thought it worked beautifully. This movie was a co-winner of the Grand Prix at the 2011 Cannes film festival (the other winner being Belgium's Le Gamin au Velo, check out that movie too!).

1530235,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B007FDT0LU,PJR,"[1, 2]","I really appreciated the night photography of lights and shadows in the first half of the film. It was beautiful and soulful, though very slow and lingering. This is the photographer in me writing and the main reason for wanting to rate it high. The photography in the second half in daylight was just fine and interesting, but not exceptional as in the first.This film was very slow and I think culturally imbedded and best for the ""foreign film"" audience and not just the ""art film"" audience. I had a lot of trouble relating to small town Turkey and I am sure I missed a great deal that I wanted to understand about the story itself. Part of that was that a lot was going on in people's faces as they talked and I needed to read the subtitles while they were talking and so could not pay as much attention to their expressions as the words were spoken as I felt I needed to.Yet I think enough did get through about rural Turkish sociology and psychology that the film was satisfactory and instructive even if I missed a lot of the implied reality beneath the surface. And I think that was one point of the film -- that there are layers of reality hidden beneath endless formalities and efforts to be polite.  As in poetry, a lot is left to the subverbal insights of the reader/viewer. This film was quite poetic in this sense, in my opinion.People were endlessly preoccupied with the ""form"" of things and how they should do this and that and what they should say and write and always looking to authority. And yet it was clear, to me at least, that this was in a sense ""adaptive"" in that it allowed them to just get on with lives that were commonly beneath it all sad, boring, confusing, and uncertain.I would just be guessing about what actually was going on under the surface in terms of ""plot"" or ""story.""  Part of my own difficulty is that the interactions were subtle and at critical points I was not sure if I should trust the translations in the subtitles. Maybe all this would not even be clear for all I can say if I were a Turkish viewer. Actually I doubt that even for sophisticated movie-going Turks this is a ""mystery movie"" in the American sense where a mystery is revealed and clues all fit together by the end, at least with a little thought or conversation over strong coffee after leaving the theatre. So I am not going to share my guesses here, because I am tending right now to think they (any!)would be idle speculation.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","Nuir Bilge Ceylon's ""Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"" is the complete antithesis to the conventional American crime drama, which routinely features detectives with matinee-idol looks, an assortment of plot twists and red herrings, and a series of breath-bating car chases to keep the masses from bolting for the exits.""Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"" has none of these. In fact, it features a cast of balding, sagging, middle-aged men - a police chief, a prosecutor, a doctor and two murder suspects - who have gone on a night-long search, through the dour planes of Turkey, in search of a buried body. As the night drags on, the men engage in a series of long, angst-ridden conversations that reveal how their constant exposure to and intimate involvement with the sordid and depraved aspects of  the human condition have made them pessimistic and cynical about life. Yet, in the end, at least one of the characters finds a way, through a bit of professional compromise, to bring a little less darkness into the world.Meanwhile, at every step in the drama, the movie drains the process of crime detection of all its ""glamour.""It's a long - 157-minutes long, in fact - methodical, and frequently ponderous journey into the heart of darkness, but fine performances and a complete lack of conventionality make it a trip worth taking.",4,The antithesis of the conventional crime movie,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,1326,"['Nuir', 'Bilge', 'Ceylon', 'Once', 'Time', 'Anatolia', 'complete', 'antithesis', 'conventional', 'American', 'crime', 'drama', 'routinely', 'detectives', 'matinee-idol', 'looks', 'assortment', 'plot', 'twists', 'red', 'herrings', 'series', 'breath-bating', 'car', 'chases', 'keep', 'masses', 'bolting', 'exits', 'Once', 'Time', 'Anatolia', 'none', 'fact', 'cast', 'balding', 'sagging', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'police', 'chief', 'prosecutor', 'doctor', 'two', 'murder', 'suspects', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'night-long', 'search', 'dour', 'planes', 'Turkey', 'search', 'buried', 'body', 'night', 'drags', 'men', 'engage', 'series', 'long', 'angst-ridden', 'conversations', 'reveal', 'how', 'constant', 'exposure', 'intimate', 'involvement', 'sordid', 'depraved', 'aspects', 'human', 'condition', 'have', 'made', 'pessimistic', 'cynical', 'life', 'end', 'least', 'one', 'characters', 'way', 'bit', 'professional', 'compromise', 'bring', 'little', 'less', 'darkness', 'world.Meanwhile', 'step', 'drama', 'movie', 'process', 'crime', 'detection', 'glamour', 'long', '157-minutes', 'long', 'fact', 'methodical', 'frequently', 'ponderous', 'journey', 'heart', 'darkness', 'fine', 'performances', 'complete', 'lack', 'conventionality', 'make', 'trip', 'worth', 'taking']",N/A
1530237,A1D9C4NC8TZ9Q2,B007FDT0LU,TJ Burnzley,"[0, 0]","Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (OUTA) is a slow-paced police procedural set in the Turkish countryside.  The title brings to mind another film, Once Upon a Time in the West, a slow-paced western from the 60's by Sergio Leone.  Leone slowed things down to heighten the suspense, and at the time of its release, the harshest criticism described the pacing as unbearable.  Most of the negative Amazon reviews of OUTA complain that it takes forever for nothing to happen. Yes, we seem to be watching things move in real time--the search for the body takes all night, we are required to sit through a tea break, we are made to wait until the autopsy room is prepared... But as Leone knew, we can learn so much by waiting, watching, and listening.  OUTA is really about people and an incident we would probably not read about in the newspaper, even if someone bothered to write the story.  Characters such as the victim, the wife and her son are insignificant, blending into the landscape, all buried alive.  While I am not an existentialist, I doubt that my passing will make for much more than that.  This film is about the everyday business of living and dying.  Whether this film is great or not depends on what a person likes in a movie, and to a degree, on what a person is expecting to see.  Director Ceylan, like Leone before him, has manipulated the genre film, for better or for worse, and given the viewer an intensely deep and thoughtful glimpse into the lives of a remote Turkish community, and I found some universal truth there.",4,"Not what most expect, and that's a good thing.",1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,1535,"['Once', 'Time', 'Anatolia', 'OUTA', 'slow-paced', 'police', 'procedural', 'set', 'Turkish', 'countryside', 'title', 'mind', 'film', 'Once', 'Time', 'West', 'slow-paced', 'western', '60', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Leone', 'slowed', 'things', 'down', 'heighten', 'suspense', 'time', 'release', 'harshest', 'criticism', 'described', 'pacing', 'unbearable', 'Most', 'negative', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'OUTA', 'complain', 'forever', 'nothing', 'happen', 'Yes', 'seem', 'be', 'watching', 'things', 'move', 'real', 'time', 'search', 'body', 'night', 'are', 'required', 'sit', 'tea', 'break', 'are', 'made', 'wait', 'autopsy', 'room', 'prepared', 'Leone', 'knew', 'can', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'waiting', 'watching', 'listening', 'OUTA', 'really', 'people', 'incident', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'read', 'newspaper', 'even', 'someone', 'bothered', 'write', 'story', 'Characters', 'such', 'victim', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'insignificant', 'blending', 'landscape', 'buried', 'alive', 'am', 'not', 'existentialist', 'doubt', 'passing', 'will', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'everyday', 'business', 'living', 'dying', 'film', 'great', 'not', 'what', 'person', 'movie', 'degree', 'what', 'person', 'expecting', 'see', 'Director', 'Ceylan', 'Leone', 'manipulated', 'genre', 'film', 'better', 'worse', 'given', 'viewer', 'intensely', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'remote', 'Turkish', 'community', 'found', 'universal', 'truth', 'there']",N/A
1530238,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B007FDT0LU,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia' first appears to be a police procedural, involving an investigation into a murder that occurred in a small town in central Turkey. A three car caravan consisting of Naci, the investigating police captain, his good-humored deputy, 'Arab', Cemal, the doctor who will eventually conduct the autopsy on the victim, Nusret, the district prosecutor, other officers, grave diggers, members of the gendamerie forces whose jurisdiction covers the rural area they're in and the two murder suspects, are all driving through the Anatolian steppes, searching for the body of the murder victim.The director, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, is really more interested in examining the lives of the men involved in the investigation into the murders, than dissecting the crime itself. The first half of the film takes place at night, with wildly atmospheric shots out in the 'sticks' near the Anatolian town of Keskin. Often, characters are speaking, but they're shot from a distance or in some cases, the dialogue is completely off screen and the camera focuses on other objects in the rural landscape. Despite the neat atmospherics, the plot moves along at a lumbering pace. Director Ceylan opts to draw things out, particularly in the scenes where the police question the victims as to the location of the body.The most interesting characters appear to be the police themselves. There are amusing, routine conversations inside the car over the merits of Buffalo Yogurt or the officers' prostate problems. Quite realistically, Naci loses his temper with the main suspect, Kenan, who can't seem to remember where the body is buried. Naci begins to beat Kenan, but the Prosecutor intervenes and reminds Naci that everyone has to be done by the book.The brooding Dr. Cemal contrasts nicely with the optimistic 'Arab' , when they have a conversation together, as the others are searching for the body at a particular location. Echoing a theme straight out of 'Ecclesiastes', Cemal points to the ultimate meaningless of life--a hundred years from now, all of us will be forgotten and everything we are now doing in the present, will no longer be relevant. Arab humorously objects, stating, 'Doctor, you've buried us already'. He goes on that their rather mundane activities of the investigation might prove to be fodder for a child's story for their grandchildren, dubbed 'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia'.After failing to locate the body, the group takes a break when they visit the Mayor of a local village, Mukhtar, who serves them food. Mukhtar is an interesting character, asking the Prosecutor whether he might intervene with local authorities so that the village might get some funding for municipal improvements. Suddenly there's a power failure and the Mukhtar calls for his young daughter to bring lamps, to light the room up. The group all seem to be mesmerized by the young girl's beauty as she serves them drinks, particularly Kenan, the prime suspect. Interestingly enough, the Mukhtar refers to his youngest daughter as an 'afterthought'.After the encounter with the young girl, Kenan suddenly remembers where the body is and reveals the circumstances of the killing. It seems while drunk, he reveals to the murder victim that he is real father of the man's child. A fight ensues along with Kenan's feeble-minded brother, and the victim is killed. Because the body won't completely fit into the trunk, they're forced to hogtie him, and then drive out and bury the body. Daylight has broken, and Kenan finally leads the police to the body.The Prosecutor also appears to be just as brooding as the grim-faced doctor. He tells a cryptic story to the doctor about a young woman who predicts her own death. It seems that the woman learns of her husband's affair with another woman during a drunken night of carousing. The woman seems to forgive the husband but then drops dead of a heart attack on the predicted date. The possibility of suicide is discussed and the doctor indicates that it could have been induced by a certain type of heart medication. The prosecutor admits that his father-in-law took the same medication and implies that the woman was actually his wife.The film's denouement takes place back in town where the doctor conducts the autopsy on the victim at the morgue. During the autopsy, it appears that the victim was buried alive but the doctor opts to not mention this fact in his official report as he perhaps seeks to spare additional anguish for the victim's widow.'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia' starts off way too slow and ends the same way. The autopsy scene takes an incredibly long time and when everything ends, even with the revelation that the victim may have been buried alive, there's not enough dramatic twists and turns, to hold our interest.'Anatolia' is on safe ground when it explores the ordinary lives of its common people (such as the police and the local mayor). The more upper class characters, the Doctor and the Prosecutor, are not as interesting, as they're loaded with 'angst' and are too downbeat, with all their brooding philosophizing and dark pasts. The Doctor is particularly a dull character, as we find out little about him, except for the fact that his divorce has turned him into a grim fellow indeed. The Prosecutor's story is interesting and I suppose it's a neat twist with the revelation that the woman who predicts her own death is his own wife. Nonetheless, the story is a two-edged sword, as the Prosecutor's character is defined by the downbeat story, and he becomes just as much as a brooding sad sack, as the doctor.'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia' is an interesting film worth seeing. But be prepared for the slow pace, which really diminishes its overall impact. Despite being a 'mixed bag', there's enough here to interest those film goers with multi-cultural perspectives.",3,"Interesting but slow-paced 'police procedural', as Turkish authorities investigate
