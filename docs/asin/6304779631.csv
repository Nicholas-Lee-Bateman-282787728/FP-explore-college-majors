It's far from being Sly's best, but together with &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; and &quot;Copland&quot;, it's actually one of his most effective from the 90s. (-Let's face it, the others he did that decade were pretty...  most of them, and his best movies are all from the 70s and 80s.) Don't make the mistake to judge Stallone-the-actor by this film; he's a much better actor than this movie tries to trick you into believing, he just needs better material to chew on. -&quot;The Specialist&quot; almost reduces him to merely some kind of a silent robot, literally sleepwalking through the scenery following Stone around. But for some strange reason the movie still works. Except for one brief scene. -The silly fight on the bus; it's totally out of place, and seem tacked on just for the sake of it. (-I'm pretty sure it was, actually.) Come to think of it, the erotic scenes between the two stars are also quite un-necessary, and only there to make those with cheap minds drool. Woods is his good old manic self, but the character he plays is so ridiculous and over the top it ends up being utterly unbelievable. Steiger is very good as the old mobster, but the way I see it, Roberts is the one who steals the show. Many actors don't improve with age, in fact many get worse as they get older, but Roberts seems to be the kind of actor that just gets better and better. He's so deliciously slimy here that without him the picture just drags, and you almost miss the dirty rotten scoundrel when he's not around. It's a good part, but sadly somewhat too small. The DVD looks great, and the trailer includes clips from shots not in the final film, like Stone slapping Steiger and the b/w flashback scenes in color.",3,Sylvester The Robot.,981158400,"02 3, 2001",2001,1777,"['movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'believe', 'far', 'being', 'Sly', 'best', 'together', 'quot', 'Cliffhanger', 'quot', 'quot', 'Copland', 'quot', 'actually', 'one', 'most', 'effective', '90s', 'face', 'others', 'did', 'decade', 'were', 'pretty', 'most', 'best', 'movies', 'are', '70s', '80s', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'judge', 'Stallone-the-actor', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'movie', 'trick', 'believing', 'just', 'better', 'material', 'chew', 'quot', 'Specialist', 'quot', 'almost', 'merely', 'kind', 'silent', 'robot', 'literally', 'sleepwalking', 'scenery', 'following', 'Stone', 'around', 'strange', 'reason', 'movie', 'still', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', '-The', 'silly', 'fight', 'bus', 'totally', 'place', 'seem', 'tacked', 'just', 'sake', '-I', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'actually', 'Come', 'think', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'un-necessary', 'only', 'there', 'make', 'cheap', 'minds', 'drool', 'Woods', 'good', 'old', 'manic', 'self', 'character', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'top', 'up', 'being', 'utterly', 'unbelievable', 'Steiger', 'very', 'good', 'old', 'mobster', 'way', 'see', 'Roberts', 'one', 'who', 'show', 'Many', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'improve', 'age', 'fact', 'many', 'get', 'worse', 'get', 'older', 'Roberts', 'be', 'kind', 'actor', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'so', 'deliciously', 'slimy', 'here', 'picture', 'just', 'drags', 'almost', 'miss', 'dirty', 'rotten', 'scoundrel', 'when', 'not', 'around', 'good', 'part', 'sadly', 'somewhat', 'too', 'small', 'DVD', 'great', 'trailer', 'clips', 'shots', 'not', 'final', 'film', 'Stone', 'slapping', 'Steiger', 'b/w', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'color']",N/A

The plot is paper-thin, and as I understand it, Stallone had too much clout in altering the dramatic impact of the  movie. I refer to two scenes in particular- the first fight with Woods  where Stallone insisted that his character won ( just for a change ) thus  diminishing the final come-uppance for the Woods character at the end of  the film, and secondly the gratuitous bus scene where Stallone ( just for a  change ) single-handedly sorts out some punks on a bus. Apparently the  scene was added at Stallone's insistence, just to make him look heroic (  just for a ... well you get the picture ! ) Anyway the film is stolen by  James Woods as usual, who probably could have done this film in his sleep!  Jimmy is obviously enjoying himself with various little ad-libs ( 'Get a  new shirt ! ) and is probably the only one on the set who realised just how  daft the whole thing was. Stone looks edible as usual, but her role is  little more than eye-candy despite her character supposedly being central  to the plot. The true horror of the movie however is Rod Steiger's accent!  What the hell has happened to this once great actor? I have seen less ham  at the local meat market! His scenes with Woods show a once great actor  being acted off the screen by another who needed the money to pay the rent.  ' Chew find him!' Chew? The only chewing was Woods chewing up the scenery  and walking off with the movie. I first saw the film at the cinema and the  audience was bored with a large proportion of it, but every time Jimmy  appeared, they all sat up, attentive again, because they knew SOMETHING was  going to happen.

435684,A3L2U581LL17EB,6304779631,Eric,"[3, 4]","Arguably Sylvester Stallone's last box office hit (unless you count Cop Land), The Specialist is not the typical Stallone testosterone fest. In fact, it remains a fairly atmospheric thriller revolving around obsession and revenge. But it's not as interesting as it may sound, thanks to the generally lackluster script and mostly unlikeable characters.Stallone plays Ray Quick, an ex-bomb specialist who works for hire. After the movie's requisite prologue, he's in Miami working for May Munro (Sharon Stone), who wants him to kill three mobsters, especially the head mobster's son, Tomas (Eric Roberts), because they murdered her parents when she was a little girl. Quick contacts her only by phone, they are to never meet, but he's admittedly intrigued by her and vice versa. However, she's actually working for Ned Trent (James Woods), Quick's former colleague who's out for revenge.Action fans expecting bombastic and over-the-top action sequences should steer clear, this movie will be too sluggish for them. The Specialist has no desire to function as a typical Stallone actioner. There are no large-scale gun battles, fisticuffs, or car chases. In fact, I gather Stallone received the role purely on the basis of his box office clout (and perhaps also his ability to brood and act generally depressed fairly well).So what is The Specialist, then? Is it a thriller? Yeah, sort of, there are a few suspenseful moments, mostly pertaining to Stallone using his bombs to knock off the mobsters. Surprisingly enough, the twist of having the hero kill the bad guys with explosives (Speed and Blown away came out the same year) works well enough, mostly because the villains' impending doom bears a certain inevitability that plays to the movie's advantage.But there's little else about the movie worth recommending. The story doesn't make much sense; as soon as it's revealed Roberts' murdered Stone's parents when she was a child, I scratched my head in confusion. He couldn't possibly be more than a year or two older than Stone, meaning he committed the murders when he was about, what, ten or eleven? More likely, it appears the filmmakers are trying to pass off Stone as a twenty-year old bombshell. Sure, Stone looks great (and I do mean great) in this film, but she can't even pass for thirty.The romance is unsurprisingly perfunctory and generic. As soon as the hero and heroine meet, they almost immediately tear their clothes off and go at it. This is neither romantic nor sexy, even with the undeniably hot Sharon Stone as part of this tryst. I've always kind of liked Stallone, subpar an actor as he may be. He's always had a fairly commandable screen presence, though he has yet to translate that to genuine charisma (which is what puts him considerably behind that other big lug, Arnold Scwarzenegger).Neither suspenseful nor exciting enough to recommend, The Specialist is of little interest to anyone except for Stallone and Stone fans (and maybe James Wood fans, who will either delight or wince at his maniacally over-the-top performance). I'm still waiting for Stallone to revive his career with a big-budget action blockbuster, but I don't see it happening.

I can see why THE SPECIALIST is now included in that group.  Sylvester Stallone has rarely been as buff as he is in the role of Ray Quick, an ex-CIA bomb specialist who has been hired as a bomb hit man to kill some thugs headed by Rod Steiger and Eric Roberts.  Stallone is as stone-faced as ever as he judiciously places small but powerful explosives to kill his victims.  Stallone as Quick sleepwalks through his screen time, but as I watched this movie for the third time, I realized that the movie that I saw was exactly the one that director Luis LLosa wanted: a paen to the power and destructive force of matchbook sized bombs.  Clearly, LLosa did not want anyone to take seriously the tale of a hired bomber who could kill in the hundreds and not arouse world wide attention.  There are so many explosions that each one works metaphorically to eradicate any serious consideration of a plot that has as much weight as one of Quick's plastic explosives.  The focus is less on Quick, but more on his supporting cast, Sharon Stone as the revenge-seeking woman who hires him and James Woods as the former CIA teacher spook who taught Quick all he knows about bombs.  Miss Stone is the leggy female counterpart to a Stallone whose primary acting skill is to grimace as if he expects a hook from Apollo Creed at any moment.  Stone walks around for most of her screen time in mini skirts while Stallone shows off his equally impressive pecs.  Yet, despite their physical symmetry, their screen chemistry barely registers on the cinematic Richter scale.  What keeps the film going is a balance between the incredible explosions (one of which allows a hotel floor to disengage itself from its structural base) and the superb acting of James Woods, who seems to be working as some kind of CIA spook with authority over the local police but is really on the pad of a crime boss, played shrilly by a balding Rod Steiger, who is guilty of badly overacting.  Woods does what he can to keep the disparate elements of an off-balanced movie like this one on track.  To his credit, he manages to give more than a note of authenticity even to the scenes that defy logic and analysis.  The relationship between Woods and Stallone on a reverse-buddy level is far more of note that the hoped for sexual sizzle between Stallone and Stone.  Essentially, THE SPECIALIST is predator prey film with Woods hunting Stallone, but the boundaries between the hunter and the hunted soon often blur.  Watching a film like this is a perversely enjoyable experience.  One does not expect any great statements about the Twisted Meaning of Life, but in the male bonding arena, nobody can top James Woods with his ability to make the audience feel the nervous agida as he closes in on his target.  Stallone, however, has never learned how to react when he is outside of the squared circle, but in THE SPECIALIST, I did not really care about that.",3,There is Trash--and Then There is The Specialist,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,3088,"['Most', 'big', 'budget', 'big', 'star', 'films', 'come', 'heavy', 'critical', 'panning', 'usually', 'contain', 'ludicrous', 'acting', 'parts', 'big', 'stars', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'SPECIALIST', 'now', 'included', 'group', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'rarely', 'been', 'as', 'buff', 'role', 'Ray', 'Quick', 'ex-CIA', 'bomb', 'specialist', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'bomb', 'hit', 'man', 'kill', 'thugs', 'headed', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Stallone', 'as', 'stone-faced', 'ever', 'judiciously', 'small', 'powerful', 'explosives', 'kill', 'victims', 'Stallone', 'Quick', 'screen', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'third', 'time', 'realized', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'exactly', 'one', 'director', 'Luis', 'LLosa', 'wanted', 'paen', 'power', 'destructive', 'force', 'matchbook', 'sized', 'bombs', 'Clearly', 'LLosa', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'anyone', 'take', 'seriously', 'tale', 'hired', 'bomber', 'who', 'could', 'kill', 'hundreds', 'not', 'arouse', 'world', 'wide', 'attention', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'explosions', 'one', 'metaphorically', 'eradicate', 'serious', 'consideration', 'plot', 'as', 'much', 'weight', 'one', 'Quick', 'plastic', 'explosives', 'focus', 'less', 'Quick', 'more', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'revenge-seeking', 'woman', 'who', 'James', 'Woods', 'former', 'CIA', 'teacher', 'spook', 'who', 'taught', 'Quick', 'bombs', 'Miss', 'Stone', 'leggy', 'female', 'counterpart', 'Stallone', 'primary', 'acting', 'skill', 'grimace', 'hook', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'moment', 'Stone', 'walks', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'mini', 'skirts', 'Stallone', 'equally', 'impressive', 'pecs', 'physical', 'symmetry', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'barely', 'registers', 'cinematic', 'Richter', 'scale', 'What', 'film', 'going', 'balance', 'incredible', 'explosions', 'one', 'hotel', 'floor', 'disengage', 'structural', 'base', 'superb', 'acting', 'James', 'Woods', 'who', 'be', 'working', 'kind', 'CIA', 'spook', 'authority', 'local', 'police', 'really', 'pad', 'crime', 'boss', 'played', 'shrilly', 'balding', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'who', 'guilty', 'badly', 'overacting', 'Woods', 'what', 'can', 'keep', 'disparate', 'elements', 'off-balanced', 'movie', 'one', 'track', 'credit', 'give', 'more', 'note', 'authenticity', 'even', 'scenes', 'defy', 'logic', 'analysis', 'relationship', 'Woods', 'Stallone', 'reverse-buddy', 'level', 'far', 'more', 'note', 'hoped', 'sexual', 'sizzle', 'Stallone', 'Stone', 'Essentially', 'SPECIALIST', 'predator', 'prey', 'film', 'Woods', 'hunting', 'Stallone', 'boundaries', 'hunter', 'hunted', 'soon', 'often', 'blur', 'Watching', 'film', 'perversely', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'One', 'not', 'expect', 'great', 'statements', 'Twisted', 'Meaning', 'Life', 'male', 'bonding', 'arena', 'nobody', 'can', 'top', 'James', 'Woods', 'ability', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'nervous', 'agida', 'target', 'Stallone', 'however', 'never', 'learned', 'how', 'react', 'when', 'squared', 'circle', 'THE', 'SPECIALIST', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'care']",N/A

You have Sharon Stone looking incredibly hot and at her peak of sexiness. And then you have... STALLONE. This peice of wood is the only person I know that can make a nude sex scene with Sharon Stone boring. He is so gassed up and that his lack of body fat has his face looking like a skeleton. The guy is a horrible actor. He was good in the first Rocky and man... he sucks in everything he is in (and don't tell me about Copland. He was horrible in that too).Watch Basic Instinct, Star 80, Pope of Greenwhich Village, or Runaway Train, Salvador and The Pawnbroker or Capone. This movie is just really bad. Why? Two words...

435708,AP3B615GM191G,6304779631,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","The first five minutes of this film give the impression that, unlike many other Sylvester Stallone action movies, it might have a bit more depth and a bit of an interesting plot.  Talk about false advertising.For a basic plot summary, ""The Specialist"" focuses on the theme of revenge.  When a woman (Sharon Stone) whose parents were killed by a mob broker (Eric Roberts) wants revenge, she draws out a former CIA bomb squad specialist (Stallone) to do the deed.  Trying to disarm the conflict (but also holding a personal agenda) is the head of the local police department (James Woods).To put it bluntly, this is a terrible movie in so many different ways:-The plot never finds an identity, trying to switch from thriller to cop drama to mob flick and never succeeding at any of them.-The acting is absolutely terrible.  Stallone's character has no depth, James Woods is, well, James Woods, and Eric Roberts is annoying to the point of just wanting to flick the whole TV set off.-Also, we get it that Sharon Stone is hot.  But, does that really need to almost completely dominate the second half of the film?Overall, I was originally intrigued by this movie's concept in the early goings, but by about the 30 minute mark is had completely unraveled and never gets wound up again.  If you like this fare, watch Assassins or Tango & Cash instead.  Those aren't great movies either, but at least they do some things right, which is more than can be said about ""The Specialist"".",1,"Nothing ""Special"" About It",1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,1475,"['first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'give', 'impression', 'many', 'other', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'action', 'movies', 'might', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'bit', 'interesting', 'plot', 'Talk', 'false', 'advertising.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Specialist', 'focuses', 'theme', 'revenge', 'When', 'woman', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'mob', 'broker', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'revenge', 'out', 'former', 'CIA', 'bomb', 'squad', 'specialist', 'Stallone', 'do', 'deed', 'Trying', 'disarm', 'conflict', 'also', 'holding', 'personal', 'agenda', 'head', 'local', 'police', 'department', 'James', 'Woods', 'put', 'bluntly', 'terrible', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', '-The', 'plot', 'never', 'identity', 'trying', 'switch', 'thriller', 'cop', 'drama', 'mob', 'flick', 'never', 'succeeding', 'them.-The', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'Stallone', 'character', 'depth', 'James', 'Woods', 'well', 'James', 'Woods', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'annoying', 'point', 'just', 'wanting', 'flick', 'whole', 'TV', 'set', 'off.-Also', 'get', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'hot', 'really', 'need', 'almost', 'completely', 'dominate', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'Overall', 'was', 'originally', 'intrigued', 'movie', 'concept', 'early', 'goings', '30', 'minute', 'mark', 'had', 'completely', 'unraveled', 'never', 'wound', 'up', 'again', 'like', 'fare', 'watch', 'Assassins', 'Tango', 'Cash', 'instead', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'movies', 'least', 'do', 'things', 'right', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Specialist']",N/A

After many years she still could not thru these terrible memories out of her mind. Night horrors were eating her up. Specially, due to the fact that she remembered the names and faces of the killers. Finally, she decided to hire a bomb specialist who would assassinate the killers, members of the Miami drug syndicate. This bomb specialist, Ray (Sylvester Stallone), a former CIA agent, did not want to take a job in the beginning. He stared following May everywhere in order to understand her motives. After a while Ray felled in love with May; he saw that these criminals were really bad guys, and eventually called May and agreed to tale the job. If you want to know the end of the story, you should watch the movie.What I liked the most about this movie is a beautiful and touching relationship between Ray (Sylvester Stallone) and May (Sharon Stone). They quickly felled in love with each other while speaking by phone.Every character in this film was extremely well developed. All cast was precisely selected. Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone looked really great together! This couple was ideally chosen! The acting was superb by all of the actors, especially by Sharon Stone. This film also has a great music you will not forget as well as great shots of Miami.There are not too many actions here. But it is a great thriller, and it is a beautiful love story. If you did not see it yet, you certainly should see it. Do not trust to anyone's opinion.
