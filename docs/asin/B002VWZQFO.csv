1296431,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B002VWZQFO,Happy Reader,"[7, 7]","This is Set Eight of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.This Set has three episodes, which originally aired in March and April of 1992. They were the three middle episodes, in the same order, in the BBC's original Series 6. (In England, they have ""series"", not ""seasons"".)Episodes:Happy FamiliesThe Death of the SelfAbsolute ConvictionHAPPY FAMILIES:It's Lady Emily Blacombe's birthday. Her friends and family are singing ""Happy Birthday"", but nobody, including Emily, looks the least bit happy. Her friend, Margaret Cliff, says, ""Everyone you love is here."" Emily cries, ""Not everyone"", which is greeted by rolling eyes and worse by her husband and sons.And what a husband and sons. Sir John is head of Curzon Engineering, one of the largest in England, and he got there by marrying the boss' daughter in exchange for his impoverished title. The sons, Harry and James, work with their father and live at home, spoiled by living in a castle with a moat and drawbridge, and a maid/cook in a tight black dress and saucy attitude. They can't wait to leave the birthday party, Sir John calling a conference with his sons. Harry has discovered James doing something fraudulent with the company, and he is furious that their father wants to cover it up.The next we see, Sir John is dead, his head bashed in, lying on the kitchen pantry floor. This is a very high-profile case. Chief Superintendent Strange is on vacation, Chief Superintendent Hornsby fills in, and he's a whole different kettle of fish. He calls Morse in to say, ""I have ambition, Morse. I see no point in denying the fact... This case, it will raise both our profiles... I want us to shine, Morse!""Morse: ""I'll do my best, Sir.""Hornsby: ""You'll be impeccable, Chief Inspector.""To make it worse, a particularly pushy reporter has decided to report the case through Morse. The first story appears benign, ""Gentleman Cop Hunts Top Man's Killer"", but it gets nasty from there. To the viewers' and Morse's dismay, Morse actually starts to worry about what the newspapers will say.Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on was a little fun this time. He's the tramp drinking from a bottle when the reporter is on a rooftop.DEATH OF THE SELF:A group of people stand around a fire, a beautiful Italian mansion in the background. As in a ritual, each person throws something on the fire, ending his/her comment with, ""I burn the past.""  One of them is opera soprano Nichole Burgess, expatriate Brit living in Italy, who hasn't been seen in concert for years due to a breakdown. She throws a shawl on the fire, saying, ""No more uncertainty, no more fear. I burn the past."" The group leader, Russell Clark, sends everyone to walk in the woods, reflecting on their new freedom. One of the participants is an English novelist, May Lawrence, who, unfortunately, manages to skewer herself on a tree spike.Back in England, at the Oxford inquest, May's husband acts and responds very oddly, including skipping the country back to Italy without completing the inquest. Given the husband's garbled talk of being pressured to do something and how sorry he is, the coroner demands a follow-up. Morse and Lewis head to Vicenza, Italy. Morse has a particular glint in his eye at the thought of meeting Russell Clark again. Clark was a con man extraordinaire when Morse put him away for three years for fraud.The Italian police, led by the impeccable Claudio Battisti, are sure the death was an accident, and resent Morse and Lewis poking around. It's not just the death. Morse cannot believe that Russell has gone straight. Fleecing rich people with psychobabble doesn't have the high stakes a man like Russell craves. But Morse does get to meet Nichole, whose recordings he owns. Can Russell do one good thing, and get her back on the stage?Trivia:  This episode was written by Alma Cullen, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is when he is the man seated three seats to Morse's left, in the closing opera scene. This is the 2nd of the only two episodes of ""Inspector Morse"" that were filmed outside of England. Russell Clark is played by Michael Kitchen, proving he can play sly and sinister as well as an honest copper. I highly recommend him inFoyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day, another extraordinary mystery series.Frances Barber, as the opera singer Nichole Burgess, does a good job of faking it, but the actual operatic singing is done by Janis Kelly. In an intimate night-club setting, Burgess sings as Gilda, from Verdi's opera ""Rigoletto"". The opera at the end of the episode is Puccini's ""Turandot"", with Burgess in the role of the slave girl, Liu.In ""The Story of Morse"" a 50 minute documentary special, Frances Barber talked about her turn as an opera singer. For the final scene, ""Turandot"" performed at the Roman amphitheater in Verona, now used now as an outdoor opera house, they filmed Frances actually singing the opera. (They added Kelly's singing in the studio, later). In the audience, the entranced Morse watches Nichole Burgess' big comeback, with tears in his eyes. Frances laughs about the memory. Her opera singing was very bad, and John Thaw teased her mercilessly that it was her singing that actually made him cry.Frances Barber also talks about one scene where she wears a low-cut green top while she strolls with Morse through a vineyard. ""I'd had another scene, where I'd worn a jacket with it [the green top] and it was supposed to be up there [she gestures high on the neckline] and the director says, ""Oh, it doesn't look very nice, put it on backwards."" But then, when we got to the vineyard, he said, ""Oh no, take the jacket off."" Of course, it was back to front. But, as a result of that faux pas, I was the pin-up for a battalion of soldiers in Belize. Who still write to me now!""ABSOLUTE CONVICTION:We're in the minimum security HMP Farnleigh (Her Majesty's Prison), when Alex Bailey (played by a young lean Sean Bean) finds himself locked in his room. Someone has it in for Bailey, but he remains cocky. He can afford to be. Bailey, Lawrence Cryer and Brian Thornton each got only 2 years in this ""country club"" prison for defrauding investors in the now-defunct Cryer Investments. No reparations were made, so Morse suspects that there's a lot of money tucked away somewhere, waiting for them when they get out of prison.Then Lawrence Cryer is killed in Bailey's cell, an induced massive heart attack. Morse and Lewis have to work with the Governor (= Warden) to discover, not only who killed Cryer, but how. There are lots of suspects to investigate. The other partners, not wanting to share the missing loot? Or how about Cryer's young wife, getting it on with Thornton's son, and wearing one of the worst hairstyles ever?Detective Sergeant Chatham, young and eager, helps Morse and Lewis. They're in Morse's office when Chief Superintendent Strange comes in with a greeting, ""Nice to see you, Chatham. Don't let Morse teach you any bad habits.""Trivia: This episode was written by John Brown, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is as one of the inmates in the prison chapel, listening to a sermon by I-found-religion Thornton.",5,"A Grotesque Family, Return of a Con Man, and a young Sean Bean!",1337212800,"05

1296437,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002VWZQFO,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.Set Eight contains three episodes:Happy FamiliesMorse and Lewis investigate the murder of the scion of one of England's prominent business families. Morse finds it odd that the dead man's relatives appear to be so unaffected about his death let alone horrified at his murder. Several other murders follow but this does not put off Morse in the least bit, in fact his trademark tenacity pays off when he is able to find the pivotal connection between the victims. Though not one of my favorite Morse episodes it does improve upon subsequent viewings.The Death of the SelfI would give the actual story four stars, but it gets another star for the lovely ambience and sights in Italy. This particular episode was shot on-location in Italy, and sees Chief Inspector Morse and DS Lewis traveling there to investigate a case where a woman was found crucified to a tree. Though her death was ruled an accident, her husband's emotional outburst at the inquest makes it appear there was more to her death than previously thought. The case becomes even more interesting when Morse discovers that the dead woman had been attending a psychotherapy course in Vincenza, a course conducted by a con man (played credibly by Michael Kitchen) who had been previously arrested by Morse, been found guilty, and imprisoned for some time. Needless to say, Morse is convinced that this con man is involved in the woman's death.Meanwhile, Lewis is initially reluctant to enjoy the splendors of Italy, worried he might not make it back home in time to see his son's sports performance. Morse on the other hand, is enjoying himself, and his love for the opera is further enhanced by his involvement with a beautiful woman who used to be a prominent opera star, and who is now attempting a comeback. Aside from the complex plot, the scenic sights in Italy enhance the viewing experience, making this an engaging episode.Absolute ConvictionThis episode is set in a minimum security prison where prisoners are afforded special treatment not found in other prisons. When a prisoner dies under suspicious circumstances, Morse and Lewis go behind bars literally to investigate. Not one of my favorite episodes because I could not care less about the secondary characters but Morse makes it special nevertheless.",5,John Thaw shines as Chief Inspector Morse,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2934,"['came', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'way', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'discovered', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'who', 'amazing', 'DI', 'Lewis', 'also', 'used', 'play', 'DS', 'Lewis', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'course', 'John', 'Thaw', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'investigative', 'dramas', 'Thaw', 'Morse', 'compelling', 'watch', 'listening', 'operatic', 'music', 'quality', 'pint', 'ale', 'easily', 'smitten', 'pretty', 'face', 'intelligence', 'meticulous', 'astute', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'Morse', 'consummate', 'detective', 'most', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'are', 'superior', 'quality', 'terms', 'writing', 'acting.Set', 'Eight', 'contains', 'three', 'episodes', 'Happy', 'FamiliesMorse', 'Lewis', 'investigate', 'murder', 'scion', 'one', 'England', 'prominent', 'business', 'families', 'Morse', 'dead', 'man', 'relatives', 'appear', 'be', 'so', 'unaffected', 'death', 'let', 'alone', 'horrified', 'murder', 'Several', 'other', 'murders', 'follow', 'not', 'put', 'off', 'Morse', 'least', 'bit', 'fact', 'trademark', 'tenacity', 'when', 'able', 'find', 'pivotal', 'connection', 'victims', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'Morse', 'improve', 'subsequent', 'viewings.The', 'Death', 'SelfI', 'would', 'give', 'actual', 'story', 'four', 'stars', 'star', 'lovely', 'ambience', 'sights', 'Italy', 'particular', 'episode', 'was', 'shot', 'on-location', 'Italy', 'sees', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'DS', 'Lewis', 'traveling', 'there', 'investigate', 'case', 'where', 'woman', 'was', 'found', 'crucified', 'tree', 'death', 'was', 'ruled', 'accident', 'husband', 'emotional', 'outburst', 'inquest', 'appear', 'was', 'more', 'death', 'previously', 'thought', 'case', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'Morse', 'dead', 'woman', 'had', 'been', 'attending', 'psychotherapy', 'course', 'Vincenza', 'course', 'conducted', 'con', 'man', 'played', 'credibly', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'previously', 'arrested', 'Morse', 'been', 'found', 'guilty', 'imprisoned', 'time', 'Needless', 'say', 'Morse', 'convinced', 'con', 'man', 'involved', 'woman', 'death.Meanwhile', 'Lewis', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'enjoy', 'splendors', 'Italy', 'worried', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'back', 'home', 'time', 'see', 'son', 'sports', 'performance', 'Morse', 'other', 'hand', 'enjoying', 'love', 'opera', 'further', 'enhanced', 'involvement', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'prominent', 'opera', 'star', 'who', 'now', 'attempting', 'comeback', 'Aside', 'complex', 'plot', 'scenic', 'sights', 'Italy', 'enhance', 'viewing', 'experience', 'making', 'engaging', 'episode.Absolute', 'ConvictionThis', 'episode', 'set', 'minimum', 'security', 'prison', 'where', 'prisoners', 'are', 'afforded', 'special', 'treatment', 'not', 'found', 'other', 'prisons', 'When', 'prisoner', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'go', 'bars', 'literally', 'investigate', 'Not', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'could', 'not', 'care', 'less', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Morse', 'special', 'nevertheless']",N/A
