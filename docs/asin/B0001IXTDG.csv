807723,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,B0001IXTDG,absent_minded_prof,"[6, 7]","I noticed this excellent film in my local video store, while I was looking for something to educate myself about Afghanistan.I would like to alert whoever reads this review to the fact that this film has nothing at all to do with Osama bin Laden.  Evidently, Osama happens a fairly common boy's name in Afghanistan, and the name was chosen for the subject of this film for that reason.  There isn't even a subtext or commentary about Osama bin Laden, as will become quite clear if you take time to view the terrific,""Sharing Hope and Freedom"" interview with the director, Siddiq Barmak.  The interview is included on the DVD, in the ""Bonus Features"" section.Right at the beginning of the film, a quote from Nelson Mandela is shown.  The quote is ""I cannot forget, but I can forgive.""  I have been trying to think of exactly why this quote is placed right at the beginning of the film, and all I can think is that it could be to provide a contrasting vision of what spirituality COULD be like, when it's not twisted beyond all recognition by a bunch of psychotic mutants like the Taliban.The little girl's mom works at a hospital, which is so underfunded that it literally must cut off oxygen supplies to dying patients.  The staff tries to keep the dying patients supplied with oxygen by fanning them, although they must stop fanning when Taliban troops pay a surprise visit, to make the women have their faces covered, etc.  For me, the hopelessness of fanning dying patients mirrored the later hopelessness of the little girl, as her wretched predicament is relentlessly exacerbated...  Soon after the scene with the oxygen tanks, there is a scene in which the little girl's beautiful long hair is cut, so she can imitate a little boy more effectively.  After her haircut, she gathers up some of her shorn locks, and plants them in a flowerpot, as if hoping they might grow again.  She even takes an IV drip apparatus from the hospital, to ensure a steady water supply to her hair (?!).  How precious her lost, burgeoning womanly beauty has become, when she must co-opt the incredibly rare supplies of an underfunded hospital into her own hopeless effort to grow back her own hair, in a dirty little flowerpot.Long segments of the film are shot in a discomfitting, on-again-off-again, stop-action slow motion.  I don't know the proper term for this effect, if there is one, but to me the effect was disturbing and dreamlike.  It was a little like walking underwater, in that everything seemed oddly slowed down and surreal.At times the soundtrack is a few seconds out of synch with the images.  This is a little disconcerting, but it's probably not so bad if you're prepared for it.  So, just brace yourself.Little Osama is just miserable and hopeless throughout this entire film.  She is not a fiesty heroine, but a wretched little girl who never wanted to play the part she must play.  All she wants to do is jump rope, like a normal little girl.This film made me think about what forces might exist in our own society, which may harm women's spirits, and women's lives.  We have nothing, of course, to compare with the horrendous Taliban oppression depicted here.  Still, it never hurts to be on guard.  I hope that this film inspires you to adapt a similarly thoughtful attitude, whoever reads this.Another reviewer, in a review posted here on October 13, 2004, mentioned that this film is reminiscent of post WWII Italian neo-realist cinema.  If you'd like to experience what he's talking about, see if you can find Vittorio de Sica's ""Miracle in Milan,"" (1951)  or ""The Bicycle Thief,"" (1948), also by Vittorio de Sica.Marina Golbahari is the name of the little girl who played the title role, Osama.  In my personal opinion, Marina is a strong candidate to be the next Sharbat Gula of Afghanistan, that is to say, the new face of young Afghan women.  Sharbat Gula was the girl with the arrestingly wild green eyes, and the haunted face, who appeared on the June, 1985 cover of ""National Geographic.""  The photo became very famous, but no one knew who the young woman was.  In 2002 the photographer, Steve McCurry, rediscovered Sharbat in a remote region of Afghanistan, and the story made international headlines.  But the point is, young Marina could well become the next Sharbat Gula.  Let us hope that she may use whatever power this could bring to her in a productive way.  And if you, whoever reads this, would like to channel your energy from viewing this film, into a productive vein, I would like to recommend that you go to your favorite search engine, and google the phrase ""Iniative to Educate Afghan Women.""",4,Praise Allah (or whomever) -- the Taliban are GONE!,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,4628,"['noticed', 'excellent', 'film', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'educate', 'Afghanistan.I', 'would', 'like', 'alert', 'whoever', 'review', 'fact', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'Evidently', 'Osama', 'fairly', 'common', 'boy', 'name', 'Afghanistan', 'name', 'was', 'chosen', 'subject', 'film', 'reason', ""n't"", 'even', 'subtext', 'commentary', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'will', 'become', 'quite', 'clear', 'take', 'time', 'view', 'terrific', 'Sharing', 'Hope', 'Freedom', 'interview', 'director', 'Siddiq', 'Barmak', 'interview', 'included', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'section.Right', 'beginning', 'film', 'quote', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'shown', 'quote', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'can', 'forgive', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'think', 'exactly', 'why', 'quote', 'placed', 'right', 'beginning', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'provide', 'contrasting', 'vision', 'what', 'spirituality', 'COULD', 'be', 'when', 'not', 'twisted', 'recognition', 'bunch', 'psychotic', 'mutants', 'Taliban.The', 'little', 'girl', 'mom', 'hospital', 'so', 'underfunded', 'literally', 'must', 'cut', 'off', 'oxygen', 'supplies', 'dying', 'patients', 'staff', 'keep', 'dying', 'patients', 'supplied', 'oxygen', 'fanning', 'must', 'stop', 'fanning', 'when', 'Taliban', 'pay', 'surprise', 'visit', 'make', 'women', 'have', 'covered', 'etc', 'hopelessness', 'fanning', 'dying', 'patients', 'mirrored', 'later', 'hopelessness', 'little', 'girl', 'wretched', 'predicament', 'relentlessly', 'exacerbated', 'Soon', 'scene', 'oxygen', 'tanks', 'scene', 'little', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'long', 'hair', 'cut', 'can', 'imitate', 'little', 'boy', 'more', 'effectively', 'haircut', 'up', 'shorn', 'locks', 'plants', 'flowerpot', 'hoping', 'might', 'grow', 'again', 'even', 'IV', 'drip', 'apparatus', 'hospital', 'ensure', 'steady', 'water', 'supply', 'hair', 'How', 'precious', 'lost', 'burgeoning', 'womanly', 'beauty', 'become', 'when', 'must', 'co-opt', 'incredibly', 'rare', 'supplies', 'underfunded', 'hospital', 'own', 'hopeless', 'effort', 'grow', 'back', 'own', 'hair', 'dirty', 'little', 'flowerpot.Long', 'segments', 'film', 'are', 'shot', 'discomfitting', 'on-again-off-again', 'stop-action', 'slow', 'motion', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'proper', 'term', 'effect', 'one', 'effect', 'was', 'disturbing', 'dreamlike', 'was', 'little', 'walking', 'underwater', 'everything', 'seemed', 'oddly', 'slowed', 'down', 'surreal.At', 'times', 'soundtrack', 'few', 'synch', 'images', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'probably', 'not', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'So', 'just', 'brace', 'yourself.Little', 'Osama', 'just', 'miserable', 'hopeless', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'fiesty', 'heroine', 'wretched', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'wanted', 'play', 'part', 'must', 'play', 'do', 'jump', 'rope', 'normal', 'little', 'girl.This', 'film', 'made', 'think', 'what', 'forces', 'might', 'exist', 'own', 'society', 'may', 'harm', 'women', 'spirits', 'women', 'lives', 'have', 'nothing', 'course', 'compare', 'horrendous', 'Taliban', 'oppression', 'depicted', 'here', 'Still', 'never', 'be', 'guard', 'hope', 'film', 'adapt', 'similarly', 'thoughtful', 'attitude', 'whoever', 'this.Another', 'reviewer', 'review', 'posted', 'here', 'October', '13', '2004', 'mentioned', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'post', 'WWII', 'Italian', 'neo-realist', 'cinema', ""'d"", 'like', 'experience', 'what', 'talking', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'Vittorio', 'Sica', 'Miracle', 'Milan', '1951', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', '1948', 'also', 'Vittorio', 'de', 'Sica.Marina', 'Golbahari', 'name', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'Osama', 'personal', 'opinion', 'Marina', 'strong', 'candidate', 'be', 'next', 'Sharbat', 'Gula', 'Afghanistan', 'say', 'new', 'face', 'young', 'Afghan', 'women', 'Sharbat', 'Gula', 'was', 'girl', 'arrestingly', 'wild', 'green', 'eyes', 'haunted', 'face', 'who', 'appeared', 'June', '1985', 'cover', 'National', 'Geographic', 'photo', 'became', 'very', 'famous', 'one', 'knew', 'who', 'young', 'woman', 'was', '2002', 'photographer', 'Steve', 'McCurry', 'rediscovered', 'Sharbat', 'remote', 'region', 'Afghanistan', 'story', 'made', 'international', 'headlines', 'point', 'young', 'Marina', 'could', 'well', 'become', 'next', 'Sharbat', 'Gula', 'Let', 'hope', 'may', 'use', 'power', 'could', 'bring', 'productive', 'way', 'whoever', 'would', 'like', 'channel', 'energy', 'viewing', 'film', 'productive', 'vein', 'would', 'like', 'recommend', 'go', 'favorite', 'search', 'engine', 'google', 'phrase', 'Iniative', 'Educate', 'Afghan', 'Women']",N/A

807725,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B0001IXTDG,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[0, 0]","When I saw this movie a few years ago, it completely bowled me over. Siddiq Barmak, at the age of 41, created a masterful Afghan film--the first to follow the Taliban's defeat--about Osama. In reality this ""boy"" is a 12-year-old girl (Marina Golbahari), forced after the Taliban conquers Kabul to disguise herself to get a job.Her mother is a hospital physician, widowed in the civil war. But the Taliban shut down her hospital and ban women from working outside their homes--or even walking alone, unaccompanied by a husband, father or brother. Her brother has also gone off to war, and she lives alone with her mother and grandmother.At first, the girl's mother gets by, visiting patients with escorts from male neighbors. Then that becomes too dangerous. Disguising herself gives the girl, her mother and grandmother their only chance to survive.Unfortunately, the Taliban before long rounds up all young boys in Kabul to train them for jihad. They are forcibly transferred from their homes and jobs to a madrassa, where they're drilled to memorize the Koran--and indoctrinated into a radical hate ideology.In this way, ""Osama"" finds herself in deep trouble. Surrounded by boys, day and night, she finds it increasingly difficult to keep her secret. She has one friend, Espandi, a boy who recognizes her from their prewar days, and protects her as best he can. Otherwise, she is completely alone, in a sea of hatred.The film is heartbreaking, not least for the forcible imprisonment of masses of women--covered from head to toe, their faces completely invisible behind net masks required by the Taliban--and banned from working or even so much as walking outside alone.Those who want to promote Western dialog with radical Islamic groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, and their terrorist offspring, should see this film. It's an unflinching portrait of the effects of the fully enforced Islamic law that radical Muslims seek to impose--worldwide.--Alyssa A.

The family not able to survive without the father in the family, mother unable to work as the hospital where she worked was closed by Taliban. Mother and Grandmother decide to disguise the daughter to a boy - of course not physiologically - but just by cutting her hair and putting her father's altered clothes - so that (s)he can work for their bread. The boy works for the friend's grocery shop, gets caught by the Taliban for training, the identity revealed and as a punishment gets prisoned and while ready for death by stones, escapes and gets married to an old man.The director (Siddiq Barmark) must be very artistic - some of the scenes are extra-ordinarily beautiful - especially the mother tearing the photos of the boy's youth hood in case he/she will be caught, the marriage function turning into a death one, the girl planting her hair, the granny telling the stories and meticulously taken - be it the barren street or the spokes and the exposed legs or the relationship between Osama and Espandi (Arif Herati), the only one who knows the secret - just a wow!The director must also be very bold to take this kind of movie - of course he could, as the Taliban regime is over, deserves real appreciation to bring this as a movie to reach the mass while all we were hearing through news channels.You cannot stop getting emotional when you see Osama getting caught for being identified as a girl. Even the strong hearts will cry for sure. The girl has done a fabulous job for the role - eyes filled with peril always - that she could be caught anytime. Be it in the religious training camp or while doing prayer or even while heading home, trying her best to talk in a male voice - she has lived the character.Interestingly the movie had a different kind of flavor too mixed - suspense - the audience is at grip always when her identity will be revealed. Sometimes the movie felt more like a documentary as it is based on facts - girl turning to boy has happened during the Taliban rule as the director recalls. Also the movie stands outstanding for the low budget involved - all the credit going to the amateur cast (Marina was a beggar in Afghanistan), bold and genius director, the editor for the pace, and the photographerThe movie deserves appreciation for exposing some of the bold facts of the Taliban rule - punishment through stoning, old guys marrying young girls, women least respected etc. The horrifying end for the journalist who takes the documentary remains a huge shock for a while.We feel happy that those women are at last free!",5,Shockingly Bold,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,2770,"['very', 'different', 'movie', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'ones', 'first', 'kind', 'Afghanistan', 'taken', 'Taliban', 'regime.The', 'story', 'girl', 'Marina', 'Golbahari', 'turning', 'boy', 'Osama', 'just', 'survival', 'family', 'not', 'able', 'survive', 'father', 'family', 'mother', 'unable', 'work', 'hospital', 'where', 'worked', 'was', 'closed', 'Taliban', 'Mother', 'Grandmother', 'decide', 'disguise', 'daughter', 'boy', 'course', 'not', 'physiologically', 'just', 'cutting', 'hair', 'putting', 'father', 'altered', 'clothes', 'so', 's', 'can', 'work', 'bread', 'boy', 'friend', 'grocery', 'shop', 'caught', 'Taliban', 'training', 'identity', 'revealed', 'punishment', 'prisoned', 'ready', 'death', 'stones', 'escapes', 'married', 'old', 'man.The', 'director', 'Siddiq', 'Barmark', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'artistic', 'scenes', 'are', 'extra-ordinarily', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'mother', 'tearing', 'photos', 'boy', 'youth', 'hood', 'case', 'he/she', 'will', 'be', 'caught', 'marriage', 'function', 'turning', 'death', 'one', 'girl', 'planting', 'hair', 'granny', 'telling', 'stories', 'meticulously', 'taken', 'be', 'barren', 'street', 'spokes', 'exposed', 'legs', 'relationship', 'Osama', 'Espandi', 'Arif', 'Herati', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'secret', 'just', 'wow', 'director', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'bold', 'take', 'kind', 'movie', 'course', 'could', 'Taliban', 'regime', 'deserves', 'real', 'appreciation', 'bring', 'movie', 'reach', 'mass', 'were', 'hearing', 'news', 'channels.You', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'getting', 'emotional', 'when', 'see', 'getting', 'caught', 'being', 'identified', 'girl', 'Even', 'strong', 'hearts', 'will', 'cry', 'sure', 'girl', 'done', 'fabulous', 'job', 'role', 'eyes', 'filled', 'peril', 'always', 'could', 'be', 'caught', 'anytime', 'Be', 'religious', 'training', 'camp', 'doing', 'prayer', 'even', 'heading', 'home', 'trying', 'best', 'talk', 'male', 'voice', 'lived', 'character.Interestingly', 'movie', 'had', 'different', 'kind', 'flavor', 'too', 'mixed', 'suspense', 'audience', 'grip', 'always', 'when', 'identity', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'Sometimes', 'movie', 'felt', 'more', 'documentary', 'based', 'facts', 'girl', 'turning', 'boy', 'happened', 'Taliban', 'rule', 'director', 'Also', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'low', 'budget', 'involved', 'credit', 'going', 'amateur', 'cast', 'Marina', 'was', 'beggar', 'Afghanistan', 'bold', 'genius', 'director', 'editor', 'pace', 'photographerThe', 'movie', 'appreciation', 'exposing', 'bold', 'facts', 'Taliban', 'rule', 'punishment', 'stoning', 'old', 'guys', 'marrying', 'young', 'girls', 'women', 'least', 'respected', 'etc', 'horrifying', 'end', 'journalist', 'who', 'documentary', 'huge', 'shock', 'while.We', 'feel', 'happy', 'women', 'are', 'last', 'free']",N/A

This is not a film for those hoping to wile away an hour or two watching some light-hearted entertainment. Yes the production values are extremely good and the acting is excellent, especially the performances of the young female star Marina Golbahari (Osama) as Osama and Arif Herati as her street peddler friend Espandi. However Siddiq Barmak did not make this film to entertain. This is a movie with a message and there's not confusion about what he's trying to convey.Everyone should see this film.

The movie ""Osama"" is entirely different from our world.  The old guy in the movie ends up taking a bath in a scene that is like a line from the Liz Phair song, ""Flower,"" on the CD ""Exile in Guyville,"" in which she sings, ""It's kind of like you're underwater.""  What is really outrageous is the kind of justice handed out near the end of the movie, in which ""Where are the witnesses?"" is not an official question; it is more like the opposite of the official proceedings in the ways that secret military tribunals might turn out to be the opposite of a trial.Courting disaster, the girl who is the main feature in the ""Osama"" story is forgiven for disguising herself as a boy, but the proceeding declares that she must marry a particular individual.  That is giving away the ending, but you can't imagine how awful that ending is unless you see these people and how that would stone anyone who is more like Liz Phair.  I like Liz Phair, compared to which everything in this movie seems incredibly primitive, but people ought to see this movie to keep them from harping about family values, which are stranger than hell in a religious and legal setting that expects a bunch of men to make the big decisions.Note on the reviewer:  I once spent a year in Nam and a week in Cambodia, compared to which the time spent watching this movie was brief, and I have only seen it once, so anything in this review should be obvious to anyone who has seen this movie one time through, because I am really not very perceptive, but damn, a movie like this can mess with your mind, particularly in the favorite jokes department.",5,"Justice and the ""Lola"" joke",1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,1872,"['have', 'song', 'civilized', 'world', 'girls', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'boys', 'boys', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'girls', 'mixed', 'up', 'world', 'joke', 'know', 'what', 'am', ""'m"", 'glad', 'am', 'man', 'so', 'was', 'Lola', 'maybe', 'was', 'know', 'what', 'am', ""'m"", 'man', 'so', 'was', 'Lola', 'movie', 'Osama', 'entirely', 'different', 'world', 'old', 'guy', 'movie', 'up', 'taking', 'bath', 'scene', 'line', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'song', 'Flower', 'CD', 'Exile', 'Guyville', 'kind', ""'re"", 'underwater', 'What', 'really', 'outrageous', 'kind', 'justice', 'handed', 'out', 'end', 'movie', 'Where', 'are', 'witnesses', 'not', 'official', 'question', 'more', 'opposite', 'official', 'proceedings', 'ways', 'secret', 'military', 'tribunals', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'opposite', 'trial.Courting', 'disaster', 'girl', 'who', 'main', 'feature', 'Osama', 'story', 'forgiven', 'disguising', 'boy', 'proceeding', 'must', 'marry', 'particular', 'individual', 'giving', 'away', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'awful', 'ending', 'see', 'people', 'how', 'would', 'stone', 'anyone', 'who', 'more', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'like', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'compared', 'everything', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'primitive', 'people', 'ought', 'see', 'movie', 'keep', 'harping', 'family', 'values', 'are', 'stranger', 'hell', 'religious', 'legal', 'setting', 'bunch', 'men', 'make', 'big', 'decisions.Note', 'reviewer', 'once', 'spent', 'year', 'Nam', 'week', 'Cambodia', 'compared', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'brief', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'anything', 'review', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'one', 'time', 'am', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'perceptive', 'damn', 'movie', 'can', 'mess', 'mind', 'particularly', 'favorite', 'jokes', 'department']",N/A

Her mother and grandmother, as despised, disgusting females, are not permitted to go outside or get a job, and therefore have no way to feed the family.  Brilliant idea:  cut off the young girl's hair and send her into the world and cross our fingers that everything'll be okay (provided that Islam even permits crossing of the fingers).Folks, after about 15 minutes of this movie, I was on the edge of my seat.  My copy is constantly being loaned out because it's such a gripping, eye-popping movie.  I haven't been able to see it twice because everybody keeps asking to borrow it.There's something that troubles me, though.  I suspect that the filmmakers had some behind-the-scenes American support somehow; I'm just too lazy to look into it.  I mean, the film is WAY too slick to have been truly a native product.  Doubtlessly someone loaned them the Panavision and helped them with the script.But there's something deeper I find fishy:  the film is remarkably well-tuned to Western (particularly American) sensibilities, so there's nothing in it that you will find untoward.  Hence I am skeptical that what I'm seeing truly represents the ""native voice"" -- so long muted -- of Afghani thinkers and women.I mean, think about it:  there are no bizarre cultural notes, the Taliban stands condemned, the women are seen as helpless victims, Islam is seen as a backwards and stultifying force, and the script hits every note that we expect.  It's suspiciously palatable, as if someone was coaching the filmmakers at every turn as to what the rest of the world would find savory and comprehensible, and to delete the rest.I don't know.

In Afghanistan, when the repressive Taliban regime declares that no woman may appear in public without being escorted by a male relative, and that no woman may work, a twelve-year-old girl (performed brilliantly by amateur Marina Golbahari) must do the unthinkable in order for her widowed mother and grandmother to survive: Disguise herself as a boy and find work.From that day on her life is in constant peril, as she must be extraordinarily careful not to be revealed...for as the film makes very clear, severe punishment--and sometimes death--awaits those who defy the fundamentalism of the Taliban. When she is &quot;recruited&quot; by the regime and sent to an all-male re-education camp, keeping her gender a secret becomes nearly impossible. The film's sudden ending--without a true resolution--is genuinely unnerving: Much is left up to your imagination, and given what you know about the Taliban, you know that a happy ending is unlikely.Searing, disturbing, powerful, and even uplifting, &quot;Osama&quot; reveals the utter subjugation of women--epitomized by the oceans of body-covering, formless blue burkas seen throughout the film--under the severity of Taliban rule: little is omitted or withheld by director Siddiq Barmak, who gives voice to the silent millions--both male and female--who suffered under the rigors of fundamentalism. Although fictional, Barmak's film is based on the ruthless reality of life under the Taliban. Barmak exposes the terror of their everyday lives, the fear and anguish that made living in Afghanistan pure hell. It's a difficult film to watch, as cruelty and hopelessness hold sway over much of the film. Barmak puts the viewer on an emotional roller-coaster: We are treated to both moments of savagery, desperation, and horror, to instances of love, peace, and hope. The director evokes excellent performances from his cast of amateurs. At the film's emotional center is Golbahari, who is a revelation as &quot;Osama,&quot; displaying a range and maturity rarely seen in someone so young. Equally good are Zubaida Sahar as her mother, and Arif Herati as the street urchin Spandi. Barmak--who was trained as a filmmaker in Iran--also shows subtlety when needed, often allowing scenes to speak for themselves, without dialogue. The impact and significance of this film cannot be underestimated. A Golden Globe winner for Best Foreign Language Film, &quot;Osama&quot; is a must-see film.(One last thing: This film has the probably unique status of being recommended by both George W.

Such was the case with the atrocious Eskimo film of a few years back called Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner. In a sense, Osama is merely an Afghani Atanarjuat. The story is virtually non-existent, save that the Taliban is bad, evil, etc. Can you say duh? Aside from that there is little else.

Unfortunately, the film never takes a stand politically, its screenplay is at a junior high school level, with some absurd symbolism- such as Osama jumping rope in prison, that is as hermetic as can be, unless we are to believe that this is the level of rebellion and hatred the Afghani populace can muster?

Karasik,"[1, 2]","Even though the brutal nature of Taliban rule in Afghanistan has been well publicized, it was still horribly shocking to see the cruel and bizarre punishments inflicted on citizens for conduct which we would not even characterize as offensive, much less criminal.  The heartlessness of these sentences is resonant of the beheadings occurring in Iraq, and yet when seen in this film, they at least have some cultural context.  One is forced to ask oneself why the public stoning of a female journalist seems so much more violent than other types of execution.  Perhaps it is because the victim realizes that she is at the mercy of a willing and vengeful public who enthusiastically inflict the fatal wounds.  Perhaps it is simply the primal image of humans hurling stones at a helpless woman buried up to her neck.  But, while I would never apologize for these acts, I am tempted to wonder whether we, in the West, are perhaps guilty of sanitizing killings and executions so that they ultimately becomes more palatable.  Violence aside, what moved me most about this film was the loving attention to the beauty of Afghanistan and its people.  The filmmaker (if I understood his interview in the special features correctly) used non-actors to depict this story of a young girl approaching puberty, with superb results.  (I am reminded of another excellent film, called &quot;Rabbit Proof Fence,&quot; about the oppression of Australian Aboriginal people by the English, which also uses non-actor children.)  The camera makes the most of the protagonist's exquisite androgynous face and expressive eyes.  The film's tendency to be slow-paced, which left me a bit distracted at the beginning, is actually a strength, as small details like a puppy in the street or a dry, dusty roadway become a real-time meditation on the texture of everyday life for a magnificent people who, one can only hope, will someday achieve an open and egalitarian society.",5,A beautiful people under a shocking regime,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,1945,"['Even', 'brutal', 'nature', 'Taliban', 'rule', 'Afghanistan', 'been', 'well', 'publicized', 'was', 'still', 'horribly', 'shocking', 'see', 'cruel', 'bizarre', 'punishments', 'inflicted', 'citizens', 'conduct', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'characterize', 'offensive', 'much', 'less', 'criminal', 'heartlessness', 'sentences', 'resonant', 'beheadings', 'occurring', 'Iraq', 'yet', 'when', 'seen', 'film', 'least', 'have', 'cultural', 'context', 'One', 'forced', 'ask', 'why', 'public', 'stoning', 'female', 'journalist', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'other', 'types', 'execution', 'Perhaps', 'victim', 'mercy', 'willing', 'vengeful', 'public', 'who', 'enthusiastically', 'inflict', 'fatal', 'wounds', 'Perhaps', 'simply', 'primal', 'image', 'humans', 'hurling', 'stones', 'helpless', 'woman', 'buried', 'up', 'neck', 'would', 'never', 'apologize', 'acts', 'am', 'tempted', 'wonder', 'West', 'are', 'perhaps', 'guilty', 'sanitizing', 'killings', 'executions', 'so', 'ultimately', 'more', 'palatable', 'Violence', 'aside', 'what', 'moved', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'loving', 'attention', 'beauty', 'Afghanistan', 'people', 'filmmaker', 'understood', 'interview', 'special', 'features', 'correctly', 'used', 'non-actors', 'depict', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'approaching', 'puberty', 'superb', 'results', 'am', 'reminded', 'excellent', 'film', 'called', 'quot', 'Rabbit', 'Proof', 'Fence', 'quot', 'oppression', 'Australian', 'Aboriginal', 'people', 'English', 'also', 'non-actor', 'children', 'camera', 'most', 'protagonist', 'exquisite', 'androgynous', 'face', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'film', 'tendency', 'be', 'slow-paced', 'left', 'bit', 'distracted', 'beginning', 'actually', 'strength', 'small', 'details', 'puppy', 'street', 'dry', 'dusty', 'roadway', 'become', 'real-time', 'meditation', 'texture', 'everyday', 'life', 'magnificent', 'people', 'who', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'someday', 'achieve', 'open', 'egalitarian', 'society']",N/A

A brutally honest view of an Afghanistan that was repressed under totalitarian rule. Wonderful organization and interpretation of life.Cons: (for some) no happy ending. Walking away feeling beaten up...almost hopeless.When I saw this movie, I thought that another Westerner was trying to play up the implied grievances of our current military operations. When I checked out the special features on the DVD and watched ""Sharing Hope and Freedom"" with the director, Siddiq Barmak, I realized that this was a movie made by one who knew Afghanistan, who lived in Afghanistan, and who (probably) saw the true face of the Taliban. This film has the power to affect your core so deeply when you understand that it is not necessarily fiction but a depiction of life in an oppressive and dark world.The film is based on a collaboration of stories that Barmak had seen or had heard of from friends over the course of the Taliban's reign. The movie itself seems to represent unfound and desired freedoms from behind veils and prisoner's locks. ""Osama"" traces the life of a girl who (unwillingly) changes her identity for the sake of her mother and grandmother. There is an air of hopelessness throughout the entire movie and no Hollywood style happy-ending is found within its breadth.What is communicated is the hardship that life can be under a tyrannical society whose doctrines have been mutated in such a way as to demean the worth of women for the sake of masculine prominence and power. Osama is more than a statement of how awful life can be for a women in a Muslim world that degenerates females, but truly how awful life is apart from the rightfully recognized dignity of human beings. In such a society, only those who have already obtained power retain their dignity, and their desires are acted out in such a way that selfish arrogance is pronounced in such a loud fashion as to portray them as monsters.Burmak's casting was phenomenal.  He sought out regular people to give the film a ""natural"" feel. These children don't seem as if they are acting as you can see that the fear of death and seclusion are still fresh on their hearts. The despair that you see in so many faces is what really exists in a nation that not only needs to rebuild its infrastructure and economy, but also its population's dignity (as Burmak states in his interview). These are a people who are rediscovering their worth.""Osama"" is the type of reality show that we won't normally see in a nation that enjoys freedom of speech and the protections therein. It's an awful kick to the stomach to see how lives are destroyed, manipulated, and demeaned for the sake of personal pleasure.

This was a world where womanhood was a terrible flaw, although it did have some utility for men - especially those in charge. If I didn't know that this dark, gritty film was based on fact, I would think it was horrifying science-fiction. The first movie produced after the fall of the Taliban regime, ""Osama"" has won many awards, culminating in the 2004 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film. Afghani filmmaker-director Siddiq Barmak portrays the grim reality of oppression in this stark, powerful piece.Young Marina Golbahari is outstanding as the 12 year old Afghani girl who is forced to masquerade as a boy in order to earn a living for her desperate family. Her facial expressions often communicate more than pages of dialogue could. Woman were forbidden to work under the Taliban, and those without husbands, brothers or fathers to provide for them starved. Golbahari, hair cut, dressed in her dead father's clothes and named Osama, has a widowed elderly grandmother and mother depending on her. She finds a simple job minding a complicit neighbor's store. Her disguise seems to work until the Taliban round up all the neighborhood boys, ""Osama"" included, to send to the local religious school, (Madrasa), which doubles as a military training camp for youths. The consequences are predictably catastrophic.This is one of the most extraordinary films I have seen in a long while. There are scenes that appear to have been shot with a hand held camera and look like something an undercover journalist might turn in for viewing outside the country. Since filming was forbidden, these jumpy, jerky shots, and images at odd angles, give a clandestine and extremely realistic feel. Many of the scenes are shot without words, and do not need language to communicate the fear, oppression and tension in just in walking down the street. In one sequence, a man is berated and threatened by the Taliban mullahs for allowing his wife to ride on the back of his bicycle, thereby exposing her ankles.The film is deceptively simple and may, at times, appear naive, but the message is a grim one - and heartbreaking. I thought I had some kind of basic understanding of what the women of Afghanistan went through. I wasn't even close.

""Schindler's List"", ""The Killing Field"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"" are some examples of those kind of films. These are not feel good kind of movies that will lift spirits and make you feel life is beautiful. But these are excellent documents on celluloid that bring to the public an understanding of the horrors that take place around this world and a how it all occurred. These are not the kind of things we may want to watch but they are films we need to watch to be aware of and better informed about what is taking place in this world of ours.""Osama"" is one of those movies. It is a touching but sad movie that was the first movie to be filmed in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban government. The movie is a look at the terrible repressive rule the Taliban inflicted on the Afghan people after they came into power in that country. While all suffered under their rule the worst to feel it were the women. Forced to wear burkas which covered women from head to toe, unable to walk in public unless attended by a male member of their family, not allowed to go to school or get any kind of education and not allowed to have a job. These were kind situations that women in Afghanistan had to live with while the Taliban were in power.The character Osama in this movie does not refer to Osama Bin Laden. Instead it refers to a young girl who lives with her mother and grandmother. Her mother is a doctor but due to the Taliban she is forbidden to practice medicine once they are in control and close down the hospital. Not allowed to work and with no males in the family to bring in an income the mother and grandmother come up with the plan to cut the young girls hair and dress her up as a boy so she can go out and get a job and keep the family from starving. Scared to death she might be caught by the Taliban and killed the young  girl nonetheless takes on the name Osama and ventures out into the world as a boy. ""He"" finds a job but before long faces the reality of the extreme rule of the Taliban. On day the Taliban come through the village rounding up all the boys there, including Osama, and take them off to school to learn the ways of the Taliban. Osama finds herself even more scared of having her secret revealed which eventually it is. I won't say much more to avoid any spoiler alerts.The young actress who plays the part of Osama is Marina Golbahari. She gives a great performance for one so young. She really acts with her eyes in this film. They display fright and fear. Anger and despair. She could say more with one look in this movie then many actors could say with a thousand words. Siddiq Barmak is the director of this film and does a very good job of telling this true story. This must have been a hard story for him to tell because it was about his homeland and what was being done to it while the Taliban was in power. The storytelling isn't perfect. It can drag a bit here and there but Barmak does a good job of showing the horror that was being committed at the hands of the Taliban. And I suspect what we are shown in this film is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg of what was really going on in Afghanistan during that time.The important concern in watching this film is that there are a lot of negative stereotypes that many people have about Moslems including that they are terrorists looking to kill innocent people. The actions of the Taliban certainly helped to promote that idea. Bu it is important to remember that while all Taliban are Moslems not all Moslems are Taliban. Moslems are just as much victims of the cruelty the Taliban inflicted, as is seen in this movie,  as well as by other Moslem extremists at those who are non-Moslems.Everyone needs to see this movie at least once. It is an important look at the kind of extremism we see in the world today by religious fundamentalist just  as ""Schindler's List"" was an important look at the extremism the Nazi's inflicted on Europe. We need films like ""Osama"" so that we never forget or never give in to such extreme thinking and brutality.",4,The Terror Of The Taliban,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,4167,"['so', 'often', 'movie', 'made', 'dark', 'moments', 'history', 'reveals', 'world', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Killing', 'Field', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'are', 'examples', 'kind', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'kind', 'movies', 'will', 'lift', 'spirits', 'make', 'feel', 'life', 'beautiful', 'are', 'excellent', 'documents', 'celluloid', 'bring', 'public', 'understanding', 'horrors', 'take', 'place', 'world', 'how', 'occurred', 'are', 'not', 'kind', 'things', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'are', 'films', 'need', 'watch', 'be', 'aware', 'better', 'informed', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'world', 'ours', 'Osama', 'one', 'movies', 'touching', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'be', 'filmed', 'Afghanistan', 'fall', 'Taliban', 'government', 'movie', 'look', 'terrible', 'repressive', 'rule', 'Taliban', 'inflicted', 'Afghan', 'people', 'came', 'power', 'country', 'suffered', 'rule', 'worst', 'feel', 'were', 'women', 'Forced', 'wear', 'burkas', 'covered', 'women', 'head', 'toe', 'unable', 'walk', 'public', 'attended', 'male', 'member', 'family', 'not', 'allowed', 'go', 'school', 'get', 'kind', 'education', 'not', 'allowed', 'have', 'job', 'were', 'kind', 'situations', 'women', 'Afghanistan', 'had', 'live', 'Taliban', 'were', 'power.The', 'character', 'Osama', 'movie', 'not', 'refer', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'Instead', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'mother', 'doctor', 'due', 'Taliban', 'forbidden', 'practice', 'medicine', 'are', 'control', 'close', 'hospital', 'Not', 'allowed', 'work', 'males', 'family', 'bring', 'income', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'cut', 'young', 'girls', 'hair', 'dress', 'up', 'boy', 'can', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'job', 'keep', 'family', 'starving', 'Scared', 'death', 'might', 'be', 'caught', 'Taliban', 'killed', 'young', 'girl', 'nonetheless', 'name', 'Osama', 'ventures', 'out', 'world', 'boy', 'job', 'long', 'reality', 'extreme', 'rule', 'Taliban', 'day', 'Taliban', 'come', 'village', 'rounding', 'up', 'boys', 'there', 'including', 'Osama', 'take', 'off', 'school', 'learn', 'ways', 'Taliban', 'Osama', 'even', 'more', 'scared', 'having', 'secret', 'revealed', 'eventually', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'avoid', 'spoiler', 'alerts.The', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'part', 'Osama', 'Marina', 'Golbahari', 'great', 'performance', 'one', 'so', 'young', 'really', 'eyes', 'film', 'display', 'fright', 'fear', 'Anger', 'despair', 'could', 'say', 'more', 'one', 'look', 'movie', 'then', 'many', 'actors', 'could', 'say', 'thousand', 'words', 'Siddiq', 'Barmak', 'director', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'true', 'story', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'story', 'tell', 'was', 'homeland', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'Taliban', 'was', 'power', 'storytelling', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'can', 'drag', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'Barmak', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'horror', 'was', 'being', 'committed', 'hands', 'Taliban', 'suspect', 'what', 'are', 'shown', 'film', 'only', 'tip', 'proverbial', 'iceberg', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'Afghanistan', 'time.The', 'important', 'concern', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'negative', 'stereotypes', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'Moslems', 'including', 'are', 'terrorists', 'looking', 'kill', 'innocent', 'people', 'actions', 'Taliban', 'certainly', 'helped', 'promote', 'idea', 'Bu', 'important', 'remember', 'Taliban', 'are', 'Moslems', 'not', 'Moslems', 'are', 'Taliban', 'Moslems', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'victims', 'cruelty', 'Taliban', 'inflicted', 'seen', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'Moslem', 'extremists', 'who', 'are', 'non-Moslems.Everyone', 'needs', 'see', 'movie', 'least', 'once', 'important', 'look', 'kind', 'extremism', 'see', 'world', 'today', 'religious', 'fundamentalist', 'just', 'Schindler', 'List', 'was', 'important', 'look', 'extremism', 'Nazi', 'inflicted', 'Europe', 'need', 'films', 'Osama', 'never', 'forget', 'never', 'give', 'such', 'extreme', 'thinking', 'brutality']",N/A

Obviously, Afghanistan is not known for cinema, yet the imagery that Barmak creates is worthy of the highest praise. This isn't some cheap student film, this is an accomplished work of art. The image of Osama skipping rope behind the bars of a jail, of her dangling in a well screaming, of the preparation for the stoning, and the final sequence--which I will not reveal, but is foreshadowed--these are better visualized than most of what Hollywood puts out when it &quot;tries&quot; to be &quot;dramatic&quot;.

At the beginning of the film, we see a mass demonstration of women in burkas who are demanding the right to work, since they're starving. Soon, the Taliban come and round up the demonstrating women and put them in trucks. Shortly thereafter, a widowed doctor dresses up her girl as a boy to work, going by the name Osama, and prevent starvation. Soon, she is rounded up with all the other Afghan boys for religious training. She is constantly struggling to keep her secret from getting out, and is bullied by the boys for her feminine features. I will not give away the ending, except to say that it is not a good one.One online reviewer said that Osama is not so much a story as a record of life during a particular period, and that's exactly what it is. The director Siddiq Barmak used no professional actors, and shot the whole film in Afghanistan, giving a ""you are there"" feeling. One really well-done aspect of ""Osama"" is that, though the Taliban do some very inhuman things, they are never portrayed as inhuman; they simply do what people would do when they enshrine religious fanaticism as the governing principle of society.

807751,ABP0RCZCVMRRG,B0001IXTDG,"J. DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[13, 26]","The film is about the plight of women in Afghanistan during the Talibans.  Osama is the name taken up by a young Afghan girl, who is forced to pretend she is a boy in order to earn money for her family (all men are gone or dead) so they would not starve to death. The Talibans have forbidden women to work, to go outside without a man, to go to school, or to do much of anything else, and they beat, torture, rape, and murder anyone who dares to oppose them, or be critical of them.  Little ""Osama"" lives amid this madness and cruelty, which the film captures -- only the heartless will fail to see and be moved (as with some radical-left reviewers here at Amazon).  She bravely ventures out onto the streets alone, dressed as a boy, and so the story goes from there, with little Osama finally being discovered and sold off into sexual slavery to a pedophile Mullah. It was made by native Afghans, and is authentic, giving the viewer a first-hand look into what life was like for girls, women, and honest men also under the Talibans. Anyone who today considers that ""nothing has changed"" since the American-led invasion should see this film -- forget Michael Moore's malicious fantasy, this is far more of a ""documentary"" than his flatulence -- to understand that even while women still wear the burka in many parts of Afghanistan, the fact that they can go out and hold a job, walk outside without a male relative escorting them, not be beaten up by bearded women-hating fanatics if they accidentally show a bit of skin, and regain substantial power over other basic life decisions, is nothing short of a major revolution.  And facts be known, in many parts of Afghanistan, the burka is being given up altogether. The Talibans are not completely gone, however, and both they and their cousins as embodied by the al-Qaeda car-bombers and assassins in Iraq (now in control of Fallujah, for example, where Sharia Law has been imposed) are deliberately targeting for murder all western-looking women, women's rights and education groups, voter registration activists, and virtually any and all Iraqi citizens who are happy enough to emulate the Western lifestyle, or merely to enjoy the new freedoms. This film will give you a background of the ordinary person's interaction with such religious fanatics as the Talibans, who make conservative Christians in the USA appear as flaming liberals!  For this reason, we find the ironic situation where liberal political groups in Iraq and Afghanistan, who are genuinely concerned for freedom, democracy, justice, human rights, freedom of speech and press, and women's liberation, are big supporters of the Bush policy (and of G.W. Bush personally) being very happy at the demise of the Talibans and Baathist murderers, at the same time liberal political groups in the USA (claiming interest in the same issues) are against the Bush policy and person.

Though the audience sees the wretchedness of life under Taliban rule, and the shameful way in which women are treated, the film as a whole lacks impact because the plot's thread of continuity degenerates into a series of vignettes without a substantive ending. The viewers' sympathies may remain detached. Not so with OSAMA.Osama (Marina Golbahari) is a pre-adolescent girl living with her mother (Zubaida Sahar) and grandmother (Hamida Refah). It's a family without men, both the mother's husband and brother having been slain in the war against the Soviets. Since women are not allowed out in public without a man, the mother - evidently a health worker by training - must earn money for the family by surreptitiously seeing patients. But that doesn't bring in enough to keep from starving. So, it's decided to cut Osama's hair, dress her as a boy, and send her out into society to get a job. For awhile, she works in a shop run by a kind and generous man that served in the war with her father. Then, one day, the Taliban does a sweep of the town, forcing all young boys to attend a school of fundamentalist Islamic instruction. In this all-male environment, Osama's false identity unravels with terrible consequences.I generally watch movies for their entertainment value. But there are films that serve as sobering instruction about the blighted corners and medieval practices of our planet, and this film is one of these. As a representative of this genre, OSAMA packs a big punch. The women-denigrating practices of a Taliban-dominated society rank right up there with enforced footbinding and female castration, and I can't imagine any person of ordinary sensitivity or conscience leaving the film unaffected. Indeed, a militant feminist may be tempted to lash out at the first man she encounters without thinking of first kissing the ground of the Western democracy she's fortunate enough to live in.The very last scene of OSAMA simply shows an old mullah taking a ritual cleansing bath, which seems innocent enough.

The only time woman are allowed to leave the home is when they are accompanied by a man, and then they must wear burkhas covering every inch of their body.  Women must not work, make money, or in any other way be in a position where they are self governing.  If a woman is caught by herself she risks being arrested by the Taliban, which could lead to her death, or even worse.  This puts the pre-adolescent girl and her family in a predicament as her father died in the Kabul war as a martyr, which means there is no male breadwinner in their home.  It means that the girl's mother must find a way to scrape together something to eat as they fear for their lives within the walls of their home.The mother and grandmother agree that a beardless man in a burkha could pass as a woman while a girl in a costume and short hair could pass as a boy.  This reasoning supports the women's idea to turn the girl into a young boy by cutting her hair and letting her wear the father's old costume after alterations.  The idea is excellent as the young girl is forced to become the family's new breadwinner as it seems to be the only way they could survive.  However, the girl is innocently unaware about the world as she turns her head in all directions and stares at Taliban members with obvious fear in her face.  It becomes painfully obvious that she in not ready to undertake this assignment for the welfare of her family, but they have no other choice.The girl turns into a boy, but remains a girl at heart as she returns home crying at night emotionally exhausted.  The girl always seems to fall asleep with her head in the lap of her grandmother who always tells the same story of a boy who wishes he was a girl.  The boy in grandmothers tale worked hard and he saw that the girls never worked as hard as he, which was the reason he wanted to be a girl.  The story becomes a source for how the girl perceives society as she believes that girls cannot work hard and that boys should work hard.  This reinforces the difficulty she has adapting to the Taliban society as a boy since she has been taught patriarchal values, which limits what she believes she can accomplish.  In a sense, it is a form of socially learned helplessness, which has been fostered through the tale from generation to generation.The day comes when she is forced to go to school with the boys, which becomes an eye opening experience for the girl.  The education, which is only for boys, becomes an indoctrination of the Taliban faith and rule, which is emphasizes on head bobbing hymns of the Koran and weapons training.  The girl has entered the boys world and the grass is not greener on the other side as grandma's tale suggests.  Instead her socially learned feeble femininity intensifies among these boys who have been brought up like strong boys by their families.  An example of the girl's helpless and dependent manners are exposed when she is climbing a tree during recess and she requires the the help of another boy to get down as fear petrifies her from climbing down.The only knowledge the girl had when she entered the man's world was her what mother and grandmother have taught her, which is not much in regards to the world and Islamic gender issues.  In addition, it is apparent that her fatherless upbringing has sheltered her from having a male role model in the home, which influences her view of men.  However, she is forced to learn through trial and error in order to acquire the experience to stay alive in a world where the woman's life belongs to the husband.Siddiq Barmak's story of Osama, which is the title of the film and the name a boy gives the girl, openly displays the patriarchal Taliban rule and the insignificance of womanhood.  The female insignificance is enhanced through the main character's namelessness as well as her constant covering with the burkha.  It is as if the identity of the woman has been erased and the Taliban laws of women helps to enforce the oppression of women through additional discriminating laws against women.  In the Taliban society a woman is what the man is, which means that if the woman is a widow she is not existent to the Taliban, which is the case with her family.  It should also be noted that the extremist Taliban rule is a narrow perspective and interpretation of the Koran and Islamic faith, which had dire consequences on the women of Afghanistan.Osama is a visually rich cinematic experience as it plays with visual symbolism.  One of the strongest shots of the girl is shot through prison bars while she is jumping ropes as the the camera pans across from left to right.  Jumping ropes is regarded as a girl activity in Afghanistan, but the powerful message is her happiness being a girl behind the bars where the bars symbolize the imprisonment of womanhood.  The film is full of similar symbolism and each moment is equally powerful.  When the girl gets stuck in the tree her feebleness might become overwhelming in a modern Western perspective, but it is a powerful depiction of the socially learned helplessness many girls acquire through childhood.  These intense scenes will bring about a distressing, yet marvelous, cinematic experience that must be pondered for sometime as women's rights must be considered throughout the whole world.",5,Brilliant Narration of the Taliban Imprisonment of Womanhood,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,5519,"['shadow', 'Taliban', 'rule', 'Afghanistan', '12-year', 'old', 'girl', 'true', 'name',

Filmed on a shoestring budget, the film is a composite of a number of true stories, coalescing into one. It is harrowing look at a feudal sort of government that equated women with little more than chattel.  Forced to be totally dependent on men, the question arises as to what would be their fate, if all the men in their world were to no longer be there for them.This is the issue that confronts one particular  woman, a widowed doctor, who treats patients in secret. Unfortunately, the hospital, if one can call it that, has not paid her for some time, and she can no longer work there. Moreover, it has become too dangerous for her to travel the streets, as she is a lone woman forbidden to travel the streets without the accompaniment of a member of the male sex.  As her household consists solely of three generation of women, having lost her husband and her brother, circumstances are dire indeed.She must devise some plan of getting or earning their daily bread,  if they are to survive. She turns to her young timid daughter, a girl on the cusp of womanhood. She decides that her beautiful daughter must disguise herself as a boy and go out into the world to help earn some food for the family, or they will die. Thus, the daughter is transformed into a boy called Osama. The mother then takes Osama  to see a kindly former comrade of  Osama's late father, who now runs a small  dusty shop. There, Osama is left to work, stirring cauldrons of steaming milk, scenes that are positively medieval.Passing as a boy, Osama is obliged to do those things that a male is expected to do. So, when the Taliban police come to the shop looking for boys for indoctrination at a mullah run school,  Osama has no choice but to go. Thus, begins the downfall of Osama. Despite the best efforts of Espandi, an enterprising street urchin who has befriended Osama and knows her secret, Osama is to continue a harrowing  journey that only one of her sex may travel.This is an intriguing film that, despite being somewhat choppy and disjointed in the telling,  provides a birds-eye view at what life was like for women under the Taliban.  The beautiful imagery of the film is a strong counterpoint to the harshness of Taliban rule. It is a mercy for women that the Taliban is no longer in power. This film certainly brings home the absolute cruelty of that regime towards women.Though the director uses non-actors for the roles in the film,  each one of them does a yeoman's job with the given role. Arif Herati, who plays the role of Espandi, has a great deal of screen presence. Marina Gobahan, who has the starring role of Osama, is excellent as the timid and shy girl who reluctantly cross dresses as a male in order to help her family. Her terror of being killed and her fear of the Taliban is palpable throughout the film. Her eyes are most expressive, world weary and infinitely sad. It were those very  eyes that drew the director to cast her in the role of Osama. This is a film that will leave its imprint on the viewer.The DVD offers little by way of special features, though it does offer a moderately interesting interview with the director that runs about twenty minutes in length.",4,A STUNNING INDICTMENT OF THE TALIBAN REGIME...,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,3387,"['2004', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'winner', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'film', 'directed', 'Afghani', 'Siddiq', 'Barmak', 'stunning', 'indictment', 'repressive', 'fundamentalist', 'Taliban', 'regime', 'treatment', 'women', 'Filmed', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'film', 'composite', 'number', 'true', 'stories', 'coalescing', 'one', 'harrowing', 'look', 'feudal', 'sort', 'government', 'equated', 'women', 'little', 'more', 'chattel', 'Forced', 'be', 'totally', 'dependent', 'men', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'fate', 'men', 'world', 'were', 'longer', 'be', 'there', 'them.This', 'issue', 'one', 'particular', 'woman', 'widowed', 'doctor', 'who', 'patients', 'secret', 'Unfortunately', 'hospital', 'one', 'can', 'call', 'not', 'paid', 'time', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'work', 'there', 'Moreover', 'become', 'too', 'dangerous', 'travel', 'streets', 'lone', 'woman', 'forbidden', 'travel', 'streets', 'accompaniment', 'member', 'male', 'sex', 'household', 'solely', 'three', 'generation', 'women', 'having', 'lost', 'husband', 'brother', 'circumstances', 'are', 'dire', 'indeed.She', 'must', 'devise', 'plan', 'getting', 'earning', 'daily', 'bread', 'are', 'survive', 'young', 'timid', 'daughter', 'girl', 'cusp', 'womanhood', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'must', 'disguise', 'boy', 'go', 'out', 'world', 'help', 'earn', 'food', 'family', 'will', 'die', 'Thus', 'daughter', 'transformed', 'boy', 'called', 'Osama', 'mother', 'then', 'Osama', 'see', 'kindly', 'former', 'comrade', 'Osama', 'late', 'father', 'who', 'now', 'small', 'dusty', 'shop', 'Osama', 'left', 'work', 'stirring', 'cauldrons', 'steaming', 'milk', 'scenes', 'are', 'positively', 'medieval.Passing', 'boy', 'Osama', 'obliged', 'do', 'things', 'male', 'expected', 'do', 'So', 'when', 'Taliban', 'police', 'come', 'shop', 'looking', 'boys', 'indoctrination', 'mullah', 'run', 'school', 'Osama', 'choice', 'go', 'Thus', 'downfall', 'Osama', 'best', 'efforts', 'Espandi', 'enterprising', 'street', 'urchin', 'who', 'befriended', 'Osama', 'secret', 'Osama', 'continue', 'harrowing', 'journey', 'only', 'one', 'sex', 'may', 'travel.This', 'intriguing', 'film', 'being', 'somewhat', 'choppy', 'disjointed', 'telling', 'birds-eye', 'view', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'women', 'Taliban', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'film', 'strong', 'counterpoint', 'harshness', 'Taliban', 'rule', 'mercy', 'women', 'Taliban', 'longer', 'power', 'film', 'certainly', 'home', 'absolute', 'cruelty', 'regime', 'towards', 'director', 'non-actors', 'roles', 'film', 'one', 'yeoman', 'job', 'given', 'role', 'Arif', 'Herati', 'who', 'role', 'Espandi', 'great', 'deal', 'screen', 'presence', 'Marina', 'Gobahan', 'who', 'starring', 'role', 'Osama', 'excellent', 'timid', 'shy', 'girl', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'cross', 'dresses', 'male', 'order', 'help', 'family', 'terror', 'being', 'killed', 'fear', 'Taliban', 'palpable', 'film', 'eyes', 'are', 'most', 'expressive', 'world', 'weary', 'infinitely', 'sad', 'were', 'very', 'eyes', 'drew', 'director', 'cast', 'role', 'Osama', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'imprint', 'viewer.The', 'DVD', 'little', 'way', 'special', 'features', 'offer', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'interview', 'director', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'length']",N/A

It's a sad and scary film and I had to pinch myself to remember that this kind of thing happened just a few short years ago.The film is cinematically impressive, opening with a shot of hundreds of women dressed in blue burkhas protesting the new rule of being forbidden to take jobs.  Soon the Taliban arrive and use hoses and bullets to stamp out the rebellion.  We see small children crying and women fleeing in terror.  Two of these women are a young 12-year old girl and her widowed mother.  The mother used to be a doctor but is no longer allowed to work.  She tries to earn a small amount money by caring for a former patient but she always has to have a male escort and even then the Taliban stopped them because, even though she was wearing a burkha, her toes were showing as her patient's father escorted her home on his bicycle.  When the patient dies, she has no work at all.Soon it becomes clear that the grandmother and mother will starve if the young girl does not go out to work.  They cut her hair and get her a job with a sympathetic former comrade of her father who died fighting the Russians.  Soon, though, all the young boys are rounded up to be trained as young soldiers for the Taliban.  The girl, who has taken the name ""Osama"", is thrust into a male-dominated world.I have seen several films with this common theme.  One of them was the Iranian film &quot;Baran&quot;.  The other was the American film ""Yentl"" where a young Jewish girl dresses as a boy in order to study.  In both of these films, there was a romance.  And ""Yentl"" was actually a comedy.  But as I sat in horror watching ""Osama"", it didn't take long for me to realize that this story was no ""Yentl.""When the young girl is finally discovered, the consequences are awful.  She is taken to a stadium where there is a woman being stoned to death.  The girl is saved, however, by an old man who agrees to marry her.  She is then taken to a sad home where he keeps many wives.  They are virtual prisoners for the rest of their lives and, even though some of them have children, there is no joy in that household.  As they prepare the girl for her wedding night, there is a feeling of hopelessness and desperation and we know she will never see her own mother or grandmother again.A film like this makes me again aware of the freedom and abundance I take for granted.  My heart goes out to the poor people who have suffered so much under the Taliban and for the grueling poverty under which they still live.",5,Sad and scary story set in the joyless world of the Taliban,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,2714,"['2003', 'film', 'made', 'post-Taliban', 'Afghanistan', 'horrors', 'awful', 'regime', 'tale', '12-year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'disguised', 'boy', 'can', 'find', 'work', 'support', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'sad', 'scary', 'film', 'had', 'pinch', 'remember', 'kind', 'thing', 'happened', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'ago.The', 'film', 'cinematically', 'impressive', 'opening', 'shot', 'hundreds', 'women', 'dressed', 'blue', 'burkhas', 'protesting', 'new', 'rule', 'being', 'forbidden', 'take', 'jobs', 'Soon', 'Taliban', 'arrive', 'use', 'hoses', 'bullets', 'stamp', 'out', 'rebellion', 'see', 'small', 'children', 'crying', 'women', 'fleeing', 'terror', 'Two', 'women', 'are', 'young', '12-year', 'old', 'girl', 'widowed', 'mother', 'mother', 'used', 'be', 'doctor', 'longer', 'allowed', 'work', 'earn', 'small', 'amount', 'money', 'caring', 'former', 'patient', 'always', 'have', 'male', 'escort', 'even', 'then', 'Taliban', 'stopped', 'even', 'was', 'wearing', 'burkha', 'toes', 'were', 'showing', 'patient', 'father', 'escorted', 'home', 'bicycle', 'When', 'patient', 'work', 'all.Soon', 'clear', 'grandmother', 'mother', 'will', 'starve', 'young', 'girl', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'work', 'cut', 'hair', 'get', 'job', 'sympathetic', 'former', 'comrade', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'fighting', 'Russians', 'Soon', 'young', 'boys', 'are', 'rounded', 'up', 'be', 'trained', 'young', 'soldiers', 'Taliban', 'girl', 'who', 'taken', 'name', 'Osama', 'thrust', 'male-dominated', 'world.I', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'films', 'common', 'theme', 'One', 'was', 'Iranian', 'film', 'quot', 'Baran', 'quot', 'other', 'was', 'American', 'film', 'Yentl', 'where', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'dresses', 'boy', 'order', 'study', 'films', 'was', 'romance', 'Yentl', 'was', 'actually', 'comedy', 'sat', 'horror', 'watching', 'Osama', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'story', 'was', 'Yentl', 'When', 'young', 'girl', 'finally', 'discovered', 'consequences', 'are', 'awful', 'taken', 'stadium', 'where', 'woman', 'being', 'stoned', 'death', 'girl', 'saved', 'however', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'marry', 'then', 'taken', 'sad', 'home', 'where', 'many', 'wives', 'are', 'virtual', 'prisoners', 'rest', 'lives', 'even', 'have', 'children', 'joy', 'household', 'prepare', 'girl', 'wedding', 'night', 'feeling', 'hopelessness', 'desperation', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'own', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'again.A', 'film', 'again', 'aware', 'freedom', 'abundance', 'take', 'granted', 'heart', 'out', 'poor', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'so', 'much', 'Taliban', 'grueling', 'poverty', 'still', 'live']",N/A

807763,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0001IXTDG,mirasreviews,"[5, 6]","Writer/director Siddiq Barmak made &quot;Osama&quot; in Afghanistan just after the Taliban fell from power. He employed a cast of non-professional actors and cinematographer Ebrahim Ghafori to weave this story of life under the oppressive Taliban regime. &quot;Osama&quot; is a fictional story focusing on the plight of women under Taliban rule, and was inspired by real experiences in Afghanistan. A family of women who have lost their husbands and brothers in various wars struggle to make ends meet in a society that won't allow them to earn a living. When the family's wage-earner (Zubaida Sahar) loses her job at a hospital that can no longer afford to pay her, she disguises her 12-year-old daughter (Marina Golbahari) as a boy so that she may find work and provide income for her family. But complications ensue.&quot;Osama&quot; is the second film featuring the work of cinematographer Ebrahim Ghafori to have a U.S. release. The first, 2001's &quot;Kandahar&quot;, also took place in Afghanistan and is remembered best for its striking use of simple composition and bold color. Ghafori's recognizable style makes an impact once again in &quot;Osama&quot;. It seems that he's fast creating Afghanistan's image to the world. It's remarkable that such an impoverished nation could be so photogenic.Having been inspired by real events and made by Afghani artists, I think it's safe to assume that the story of &quot;Osama&quot; is a realistic glimpse of working-class Afghani culture during the Taliban's reign. And that is probably the film's greatest value. The  title character is not strong or well-drawn. Young &quot;Osama&quot; is neither intelligent or stalwart. It would be a more engaging story if she were. The director may be trying to make the point that these people are all victims, and I'm sure they are, but watching victimhood for an hour and a half leaves something to be desired. Strong characters and interesting adaptive behavior, for example. The exception is an alternately annoying and charming street urchin named Espandi who is played by Arif Herati, a street kid himself. The boy's bold salesman personality jumps off the screen. &quot;Osama&quot; has the distinctly plodding pace that all films made in Afghanistan seem to have, which helps communicate this very foreign culture to frenetic Western audiences. It's not boring so much as it is lulling. In spite of weak characterizations, &quot;Osama&quot; is a beautiful film that offers insight into an interesting culture at an unfortunate period in its history.The DVD: There is a 20-minute interview with writer/director Siddiq Barmak in which he talks about the beginnings of his film career in Afghanistan and &quot;Osama&quot;'s inception, casting, and filming. It's worth seeing if you like the film.

The story is of a mother and daughter who are trying to make basic ends meet under Taliban's repressive and cruel rule, and this can be achieved if the young daughter,played with such simplicity and power by amateur Marina Golbahari, disguises herself as a boy to earn a living as women were forbidden to work.Soon enough, in a roundup of underage boys, similar to Mao's China, or Pol Pot's Cambodia, the very ideologies that the Mujjahedines were allegedly fighting against under the Soviets,the boys are forced to go to a religious and military brainwashing school, and 'Osama' mistaken for one is forced along.Not wishing to give too much of the film, save to say that the girl's identity is discovered and what follows is one of the most tragic and haunting development and ending I have seen in  a long while.I would like to stress that Osama first of all is not about Talibans, although quite naturally they figure prominently in the story, itself based on true events, nor it is about Afghanistan, although it perfectly reflects a society that was totally engulfed in darkness and secrecy,not unlike Hoxa's Albania or Stalin's Russia. Osama rather can be viewed as the very heartbreaking and tragic story of a young girl facing impossible odds and unable to fight the huge tide that has swept her country. It is about how desperation and poverty can push people to take huge risks, knowing very well the terrible consequences..I loved the fact that this young girl kept till the end her innocence mixed with fear and longing, that the Talibans eventually destroyed.I could not help comparing the film with Iranian cinema in terms of style and plot,and it is not surprising since Barmak was influenced and supported by none other than Makhmelbaf Snr.The cinematographer also is the excellent Ebrahim Ghafori who has shot some of the classics of Iranian cinema like The Apple, Blackboards, The Day I became I Woman and Kandahar.There were some similarities with Majidi's Baran, but unlike the Afghani refugee heroine of Baran who also dressed as a boy to earn a living after her father's accident but was relatively safe in Iran,'Osama' was totally trapped, faced danger and death every single minute, and did not have the opportunities however limited that Baran had.Osama therefore is a Must See film.It will capture your senses with its colors and themes, a story that reminds us that there are people not quite so fortunate,who face daily battles just to secure one meal, and take any risks to maintain a dignity and freedom that is constantly being stripped away from them.",5,Simply Extraordinary!!,1083110400,"04 28, 2004",2004,3103,"['When', 'Osama', 'won', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'had', 'suspicions', 'addition', 'being', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'award', 'was', 'also', 'kind', ""'encouragement"", 'support', 'first', 'film', 'come', 'Afghanistan', 'fall', 'Talibans.Watching', 'now', 'can', 'confidently', 'say', 'totally', 'deserved', 'win', 'artistic', 'merits', 'alone', 'wonder', 'why', 'earth', 'was', 'overlooked', 'Oscars', 'film', 'first', 'Afghani', 'director', 'Siddiq', 'Barmak', 'simply', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'mother', 'daughter', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'basic', 'ends', 'meet', 'Taliban', 'repressive', 'cruel', 'rule', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'young', 'daughter', 'played', 'such', 'simplicity', 'power', 'amateur', 'Marina', 'Golbahari', 'boy', 'earn', 'living', 'women', 'were', 'forbidden', 'work.Soon', 'enough', 'roundup', 'underage', 'boys', 'similar', 'Mao', 'China', 'Pol', 'Pot', 'Cambodia', 'very', 'Mujjahedines', 'were', 'allegedly', 'fighting', 'Soviets', 'boys', 'are', 'forced', 'go', 'religious', 'military', 'brainwashing', 'school', ""'Osama"", 'mistaken', 'one', 'forced', 'along.Not', 'wishing', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'save', 'say', 'girl', 'identity', 'discovered', 'what', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'haunting', 'development', 'ending', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'while.I', 'would', 'like', 'stress', 'Osama', 'first', 'not', 'Talibans', 'quite', 'naturally', 'figure', 'prominently', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'Afghanistan', 'perfectly', 'society', 'was', 'totally', 'engulfed', 'darkness', 'secrecy', 'not', 'Hoxa', 'Albania', 'Stalin', 'Russia', 'Osama', 'rather', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'very', 'heartbreaking', 'tragic', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'facing', 'impossible', 'odds', 'unable', 'fight', 'huge', 'tide', 'swept', 'country', 'how', 'desperation', 'poverty', 'can', 'push', 'people', 'take', 'huge', 'risks', 'knowing', 'very', 'well', 'terrible', 'consequences..I', 'loved', 'fact', 'young', 'girl', 'kept', 'end', 'innocence', 'mixed', 'fear', 'longing', 'Talibans', 'eventually', 'destroyed.I', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'comparing', 'film', 'Iranian', 'cinema', 'terms', 'style', 'plot', 'not', 'surprising', 'Barmak', 'was', 'influenced', 'supported', 'none', 'other', 'Makhmelbaf', 'Snr.The', 'cinematographer', 'also', 'excellent', 'Ebrahim', 'Ghafori', 'who', 'shot', 'classics', 'Iranian', 'cinema', 'Apple', 'Blackboards', 'Day', 'became', 'Woman', 'Kandahar.There', 'were', 'similarities', 'Majidi', 'Baran', 'Afghani', 'refugee', 'heroine', 'Baran', 'who', 'also', 'dressed', 'boy', 'earn', 'living', 'father', 'accident', 'was', 'relatively', 'safe', 'Iran', ""'Osama"", 'was', 'totally', 'trapped', 'faced', 'danger', 'death', 'single', 'minute', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'opportunities', 'however', 'limited', 'Baran', 'had.Osama', 'therefore', 'Must', 'See', 'film.It', 'will', 'capture', 'senses', 'colors', 'themes', 'story', 'are', 'people', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'fortunate', 'who', 'face', 'daily', 'battles', 'just', 'secure', 'one', 'meal', 'take', 'risks', 'maintain', 'dignity', 'freedom', 'constantly', 'being', 'stripped', 'away']",N/A

Osama, is absolutely breathtaking in that it tells about a mother and grandmother who makes a young girl become a boy- so they can survive. As we all know, women in Afghanistan were not allowed to work, play music, show themselves, or anything for fear of being sexually arousing to men. Anyhow, this young girl's life goes from jumping rope...to a spiraling fall into chaos...I was saddended. There's nothing more heartwretching to see a young girl be placed into a position in which she has no choice and then punished for that choice for the rest of her life.  I am not giving anything away...so you can go out there and rent it or buy it and see it for yourself.The dvd has a special feature of the director explaining why he did this movie...even sadder than the movie itself. The movie ends with sad feelings but the true story is even sadder. Yet, this movies teaches many things about rights, survival, and good people. Not everyone there was against the mother or the daughter. In some sense you wonder if the young girl's future would have been better...with death.

I'd just be repeating what you've already read.One of the things I'd like to comment on is the fact that this movie is actually rather tame. I didn't pay attention to the rating, but knowing the subject material I just assumed ""R"". It may sound strange to hear this, but this movie is a rather nice picture of the Taliban. Not that I mean it's sympathetic to them at all... we're not talking a Birth of a Nation type of movie here... but if you've ever been to the website of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan ([...]) and read the stories and seen the pictures and video footage, you know that the Taliban was far more cruel than is the depiction of their ways in this movie. I understand the reasoning behind this, though. I don't think this movie was really made for us... Americans or anyone who does not know life inside Afghanistan. I think this movie was made for the Afghan peoples... to give them a chance to see their world and lives on film. Let's face it, those people know the brutality. They don't need to see the one film of their land made in relative freedom in years and have it be a horrific nightmare that just re-ignites everything they have been living through for years. That doesn't mean this movie is flowers and rainbows, though. Far from it. It's just not the tortured, graphic nightmare that it truthfully could have been.I don't know for certain, but I would assume that this movie was made for very little money. It is quite an achievement, given that it was probably made for the price that a Hollywood production spends on catering. There is no sense of this movie being cheaply made or amateurish. It's a very well-crafted movie, and Marina gives quite a performance. When you look at her, it is at times frightening to imagine what her young eyes have seen in real life.One thing that caught me off guard the first time I saw it was the length of the movie. I looked quickly at the back of the case and thought it said 123 minutes, not one hour and 23 minutes. I was quite surprised where and when it ended, as I was expecting another half-hourish of movie. I like it... it wouldn't have hurt if there were more of it.I just hope that us outsiders don't take the making of this movie as some sort of sign that all is well and good in Afghanistan now. It's not. I'd urge everyone to keep up with what it's actually still like in Afghanistan. Go to the Human Rights Watch.org website ([...]) and read what continues to happen there. The first steps are not the whole journey.If you'd like to hear some of the musics of Afghanistan, you can pop over to the ""popular music"" page here and read my reviews of some great cds...

807773,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001IXTDG,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","I saw ""Osama"" on the same weekend in which Afghanistan held its first-ever free elections.  The contrast between that event and what we see in this film could not be more dramatic and striking.This is the first film made in the country since the fall of the Taliban regime.  It is a harrowing study of life under that brutal dictatorship as seen through the eyes of a terrified 12-year old girl.  The Taliban considered being a woman as almost akin to sinning against God.  As a result, women were not allowed to hold jobs, appear in public without male escorts, or show their face or any other part of their body when venturing outdoors.  ""Osama"" focuses specifically on the plight of war widows who were virtually forced into starvation as a result of these draconian rules.  The film tells the tale of a young girl whose mother loses her job at a local hospital.  To provide food for the table, the mother and the girl's grandmother devise an extremely dangerous plan to pass the youngster off as a boy, thereby allowing her to work as an assistant to a sympathetic shop owner.  Even though the penalty is death if she is caught, the young girl reluctantly accedes to the plot.  When she is rounded up with the other local boys to begin a program of religious indoctrination and military training, she must expend a great deal of effort to prevent her ruse from being uncovered.""Osama"" is a short film, and it doesn't intend to do anything more than offer a very small glimpse into what life was like under this tyrannical regime.  In that respect, the film provides an invaluable service to those of us in the West who find it hard to believe that such mind-numbing ignorance and cruelty can still exist in our modern world.  We see it, of course, every night on the news, but until an artist can translate it into recognizable human terms, the reality often doesn't hit us in the way that it should.  ""Osama"" really brings it home to us.  Through our experience with these characters, we come to understand how unutterably hopeless and miserable life can be for people trapped in a culture defined by a pre-scientific mindset of irrational bigotry and superstition.  The girl, who is dubbed by one of the other characters `Osama,' is no plucky little heroine who takes on the Bad Guys, indifferent to the dangers she is facing.

It is about a little girl who has to dress up as a boy to earn money because all the male members of her family have been lost to war and the taleban regime deems women to be basically illegal outside the home. The climax of this guise leads to the most harrowing scene I have ever seen in any film.

I base this on what I have seen from RAWA (Revolutionary Association of Women of Afghanistan) and what I have read of the main Sunni holy books (the hadith of Bukhari, Muslim) and their perversions of the Quran (a secondary man-made source of law in Sunni law whose meaning they alter to agree with Bukhari and Muslim). However, I would like to stress that most of the Sunni (especially in the Sunni majority countries) do not follow these laws to the extreme.

Based on a true story, this film follows the life of a 12-year-old Afghan girl and her mother. After the Taliban shut down the hospital that the mother works at she is desperate to find work but her efforts are bleak because she cannot go out in public without being escorted by a male. With no men in her family and no one else to help her the girl is transformed into a boy to help support the family. Aside from escorting her mother through the streets she finds work in a small foods shop. Each time she ventures outside she fears her life because if she is caught the Taliban will do serious harm to her. In addition, she fails to fully personify a boy since she speaks with a high voice, wears feminine slippers, and doesn't know the proper prayer rituals. But soon enough she is forced to join a Taliban school. During sessions of religious and military training her secret is close to being revealed. The only other boy who knows the truth names her Osama in an effort to try to ward off suspicions from the other boys. After her disguise is revealed and the Taliban has arrested her she is sure to suffer an unspeakable sentence for imitating a boy. Her future is bleak and desperate. There is no happy ending in this film, and the audience is left with a sad feeling of despair and shock. Surely we've all heard the atrocities committed by the Taliban since 9/11/01, but OSAMA enables the viewer to get a powerful glimpse of the horrendous events in Afghanistan under the Taliban. This is the first film to come out of this impoverished country since the end of the Taliban regime, but I hope it's not the last.

There is no need for such sentiments. No muslim would support hese kinds of acts. No human of any religion would. For this I think the director is brilliantly bold and honest in portraying such a reality that existed, and still exists today in many underdeveloped nations needing to come to grips with a true sense of morality.

It is interesting that it takes an Afghan filmmaker to make what is, in effect, the Moslim version of HITLERS CHILDREN, BEHIND THE RISING SON or GUILTY OF TREASON that starkly demonstrates the true horror of the Islamic barbarians by showing what such means to the common people who are powerless before the power of such evil. The film, very well done in every respect, is simply harrowing and unrelenting as the viewer is confronted with having to watch a young girl consigned to a nightmare existence that few in the United States could imagine and would prefer not be troubled over. It is tragic..very tragic..that if this film were made in the US today--and this is highly unlikely ---it would be critically evicerated, called Bush pro-war propaganda and racist. This is a cause of shame.To Hollywood, the victims of evil must look to themselves.The film is tremendously disturbing and that does not give the viewer any escape at all.

If this work were to be graded on art, scenary, and communication of mood it would garner an easy five stars.  There is a rich plot here too.  A war hero's family starving because there is no man to earn money, and the Taliban's religious police assure that women stay in doors or escorted by men.  The grandmother decides to cut the near-adolescent daughter's hair and dress her as a boy, so she can earn some food for the family.  Will she be discovered?  What will happen when all young men in the village are ordered to Taliban training school?  Yes, there is some suspense too.  What weighs Osama down is the incredibly slow pacing.  This is an 82 minute movie rich in detail, scenary, emotion and story--yet it drags.  There so little energy.  Even fear--the rawest and most pervasive emotion in the movie, is communicated with resignation and hopelessness.  Perhaps the slow heaviness was the reality of Taliban-era Afghanistan.  82 minutes seemed like a three hour documentary--imagine living through it!Bottom-line:  Osama is a powerful, artful condemnation of a horrific religious regime.

The fact is, the ""Osama"" is about a 12 year-old girl who must survive the life in Afganistan when the Taliban ruled the city with their rigid dogmas, prohibiting many things -- photoes, music, and women going out without a male accompanied, let alone working.[STORY] is about the unnamed girl whose family have no male relatives.  This means they cannot go out to work, and the girl takes a desperate remedy -- she has her hair cut, and disguises herself as a boy, in order to work at a kind milkman's shop.  Only a boy who sells scent in the street knows the truth, but how long can this trick go on when the Taliban regime seizes the power, ruling the place with fear?[DIRECTOR] Siddiq Barmak, born in Afganistan, learned the filmmaking in Russian school (then USSR), so ""Osama,"" often slow and quiet as it is, has a very sophisticated touch with the smooth camarawork.  If you are not accustomed to watching the non-English speaking films from, say, Iran, you find it a rather tough watching at first, but as the story goes on, the film gets more intense, drawing your attention to the film's world.[THE GIRL] is played by Marina Golbahari, who was literally ""found"" by the director when she was begging on the street to provide for the family.  In spite of the fact that she was an amateur (the Talibans banned any films), she is THE heroine the director was looking for, and you know it if you see her very sad eyes.  Actually, her eyes are strikingly pure, telling every emotion of the heroine so naturally.[ABOUT THE ENDING] Don't worry, no spoiler.  Still, you have to know that the director's first intention was different.  In the original version, the girl goes away into the ""rainbow.""  (That is why the grandmother's short story about the girl and the rainbow is included.)  But Director Barmak decided on deleting it completely, watching that Golbahari could not stop crying, remembering the painful past while shooting (her father was tortured by the Taliban).  So, the film ends with an open ending, which, unintentionally gives an impact, heightening the authentic tone of the film.""Osama"" is no political adenda though it will make you think about the gender, religion, and the US policies.  Above all, however, this is an intense drama about a girl's life.
