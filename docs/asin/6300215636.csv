While watching a movie on prime i few nights ago, i saw it was on prime and free for me to watch since i am a member of Amazon prime.I have not seen this movie in so long. I forgot the plot, who played in it, and what it was about. So it was like watching it for the first time. As the movie progressed, i remembered bits and pieces. And of course any guy who was a teen, or older in the 80's knows exactly who Virgina Madison was, same for the women with Craig Sheffer.The plot is nothing knew, a girl in a all girls catholic school and a boy in a corrections camp meet by chance, have a dance, fall in love despite that everything is against them, and rebel against the powers that be, to be together. Nothing new there. However, this movie really had, a young, but very talented cast that portray very real and believable roles on film. It is amazing how many names are in the credit on this single movie. At the time they were low list actors and actresses, today they are mainstream. This movie was one of many that slipped under the radar.

217447,A33FCLUEQSUD68,6300215636,Claire,"[3, 3]","I admit this is a corny love story that is so totally 80's one would have to have grown up in that time to appreciate it. I think I was about 12 when it came out and don't think it even played in movie theatres here in Charleston, S.C. The only reason I knew about it was because the video for the theme song ""Fire With Fire"" played a lot on MTV back in 1986 and I remember watching it and wondering why all we saw in the video was clips of the movie- we did not even see any footage of the band playing the song. Not sure why that was but I wasn't complaining since the scenes they showed from the movie (and they showed a LOT of them since there was nothing else to show!) had me mesmerized- Craig Sheffer was quite the eye candy back then. He had the David Boreanaz (""Angel"") look... I'm not sure why he never really went on to A-list status since he's a decent actor. He did do ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" after this but since then I pretty much only see him on Lifetime movies. Virginia Madsen is also a great actress who always seemed pretty underrated until ""Sideways.""Anyway, later in 1992, I remember ""Fire With Fire"" coming on HBO a lot and I finally got to see it in it's entirety and fell absolutely in love with it. I love movies where the young lovers run away without a care in the world leaving us not wanting to wonder realistically what happens to them when they realize they have no money, no education and presumably no where to go. Another 80's movie I love with the same scenario is ""Reckless"" (1984) with Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah who also run away to what they must hope are bigger and better things. I like to think this trend might have been influenced by Rod Stewart's video for ""Young Turks"" back in 1981.I'm assuming if you are buying this movie it can only be because you are a fan and maybe owned it on video waiting eagerly as I did for it to be released on dvd. I'm so thankful to Olive films for releasing it. As for the dvd itself, not surprisingly, there are NO extras, not even subtitles. But I didn't expect any miracles- it is miracle enough to just have this awesome movie on dvd. The picture looks great and the songs have remained intact- something that seems to not happen sometimes when movies are transferred to dvd- for some reason different songs are used in places. (The movie ""Shag"" (1988) comes to mind in this case.)This is a great little movie so I'm glad it's finally out on dvd since my VHS copy was starting to get worn out. Another movie I wish they would release on dvd is the 1988 Donovan Leitch movie called ""The In Crowd"" with a similar theme of young lovers running away. As for ""Fire With Fire"" I think the story is exciting, of course the script is flawed and the characters do dumb things like leave bacon burning on the stove catching the house on fire. But the scenery is beautiful and the songs are good. I love both lead actors as well as the supporting cast. I think it was a great little movie and worth the price but only if you are a real fan. I would never pay this much for a movie unless it was one I love and I do love this movie!",5,Finally on dvd!!!,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,3106,"['admit', 'corny', 'love', 'story', 'so', 'totally', '80', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'time', 'appreciate', 'think', 'was', 'about', '12', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'played', 'movie', 'theatres', 'here', 'Charleston', 'S.C', 'only', 'reason', 'knew', 'was', 'video', 'theme', 'song', 'Fire', 'Fire', 'played', 'lot', 'MTV', 'back', '1986', 'remember', 'watching', 'wondering', 'why', 'saw', 'video', 'was', 'clips', 'movie-', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'footage', 'band', 'playing', 'song', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'complaining', 'scenes', 'showed', 'movie', 'showed', 'LOT', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'show', 'had', 'mesmerized-', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'was', 'quite', 'eye', 'candy', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Angel', 'look', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'never', 'really', 'went', 'A-list', 'status', 'decent', 'actor', 'did', 'do', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'see', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'also', 'great', 'actress', 'who', 'always', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'underrated', 'Sideways', 'Anyway', 'later', '1992', 'remember', 'Fire', 'Fire', 'coming', 'HBO', 'lot', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'entirety', 'fell', 'absolutely', 'love', 'love', 'movies', 'where', 'young', 'lovers', 'run', 'away', 'care', 'world', 'leaving', 'not', 'wanting', 'wonder', 'realistically', 'what', 'when', 'realize', 'have', 'money', 'education', 'presumably', 'where', 'go', '80', 'movie', 'love', 'same', 'scenario', 'Reckless', '1984', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'who', 'also', 'run', 'away', 'what', 'must', 'hope', 'are', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'like', 'think', 'trend', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'video', 'Young', 'Turks', 'back', '1981.I', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'are', 'buying', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'are', 'fan', 'maybe', 'owned', 'video', 'waiting', 'eagerly', 'did', 'be', 'released', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'so', 'thankful', 'Olive', 'films', 'releasing', 'dvd', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'are', 'NO', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'subtitles', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'miracles-', 'miracle', 'enough', 'just', 'have', 'awesome', 'movie', 'dvd', 'picture', 'great', 'songs', 'have', 'remained', 'intact-', 'something', 'not', 'happen', 'sometimes', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'transferred', 'dvd-', 'reason', 'different', 'songs', 'are', 'used', 'places', 'movie', 'Shag', '1988', 'mind', 'case', 'great', 'little', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'out', 'dvd', 'VHS', 'copy', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'worn', 'out', 'movie', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'dvd', '1988', 'Donovan', 'Leitch', 'movie', 'called', 'Crowd', 'similar', 'theme', 'young', 'lovers', 'running', 'away', 'Fire', 'Fire', 'think', 'story', 'exciting', 'course', 'script', 'flawed', 'characters', 'do', 'dumb', 'things', 'leave', 'bacon', 'burning', 'stove', 'catching', 'house', 'fire', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'love', 'lead', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'little', 'movie', 'price', 'only', 'are', 'real', 'fan', 'would', 'never', 'pay', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'love', 'do', 'love', 'movie']",N/A

217449,A1RI3XMZHQXPD2,6300215636,C. Taylor,"[3, 6]","I am going to begin this review with the DVD release itself and not the movie. Fire with Fire was one of those movies that tragically got buried with little chance of resurfacing. Had it been made by an independent studio then they would have eagerly released it to every possible format. But it was produced by a major studio. Paramount Pictures. Paramount had been a success in the '70s with such films as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, The Godfather parts I and II, Chinatown, The Bad news Bears, Saturday Night Fever, Grease, The Warriors, and Meatballs. And they were about to enter one of their most successful decades with such 80s films as Airplane!, An Officer and a Gentleman, 48 Hrs, Flashdance, Trading Places, Footloose, Beverly Hills Cop, Pretty in Pink, Top Gun, Ferris Buellers day Off, Crocodile Dundee, The Untouchables, Fatal Attraction, Coming to America, The Naked Gun, Major League, and not to mention the Star Trek, Friday the 13th and Indiana Jones franchises. Fire with Fire was lukewarm at the box office. Paramount briefly released it on VHS for the rental shops, as they did with all their other movies. Then after the initial printing they forgot about it. All the other movies previously mentioned went on to be evergreens, meaning they were all extremely popular as home videos, and have remained in print from the first day each was released on VHS through right now where they are still being released on DVD and Blu-ray. And they continue to draw ratings on television. Paramount was making so much money with these films, along with their other hits from the 90s and 00s, that they simply did not have any reason to re-release one of their films that had failed.But Fire with Fire did have it's fans. About 3 million people saw it in the theaters. Another 20 million saw it as a rental over the years, and another 20 - 50 million have seen it when it had aired on television. It was one of those films that gradually built up it's own fan base, but, alas, not as much of a cult fan base as Eddie & the Cruisers had picked up. For decades fans of the film had to settle for the washed out VHS release, usually bought used on eBay from a rental shop that wore the tape out. There was very little chance of ever seeing an actual digital remastered version on DVD. That is until a small company called Olive Films convinced Paramount to allow them to release the movie on their label.Since this is the movie that almost no one has ever heard of, I am going to assume that the only reason why you are looking for it on Amazon is that you are one of the few who came across it years ago, and have been waiting patiently for years for a DVD release. You already made up your mind you like the film, so the only relevant review is the quality of the DVD release. First, the bad news. This is a bare bones release. There are no extras, and by that I mean NO EXTRAS. Not ever foreign language tracks or subtitles. Just the movie, and be thankful they even bothered to create a chapter menu. There are no deleted scenes, no ""Making Of"" documentary, no commentary track from Madsen and Sheffer, no music videos, no outtakes, no publicity photos and no trailers. My guess is that Paramount only agreed to sell Olive the DVD and Blu-Ray rights but withheld all the extras. If, for some reason, this was to become a home video hit, then Paramount would want the option of releasing a ""deluxe edition"". Yep, get ready to shell out another 20 bucks a year or two down the road. That is assuming this movie finds a market.So what it comes down to is the picture quality. Are you getting a better image that what you would get on the old VHS tapes? First, some more bad news. Those of you looking for a letterboxed version because you wanted to see parts of the film cropped off the edges will be disappointed. The film is letterboxed. But back in the 80s Paramount shot most of their movies open matted, meaning they were shot on film stock that was approximately the same dimensions as a television screen, and then later cropped the image for the theatrical release. In other words there is more of an image on the original VHS release. This is not the case with all films. Many letterboxed movies were shot using cameras that only create letterboxed images, and when those moves were shown on television the sides of the image needed to be cropped so that it would fill the screen. This usually resulted in characters disappearing off the edge of the screen, or text that was unreadable. shooting open matted allowed the studio to create films that did not need to be panned and scanned for television, but it often lead to such things as the boom mike appearing on the television version where it would not be seen on the theatrical release. Since this movie was intended to be widescreen, nothing vital is lost in the cropping, so only purists who wanted the original aspect ratio they remembered from television will be disappointed.The good news is that the image that does exist is far more clear then the washed out image on VHS and even the prior television broadcast prints. For example, in the scene where Madsen is floating like Ophelia in a pond, you can detect flesh color through the dress. In the previous VHS release those colors were washed out so that nearly the entire dress appeared white, and therefore, somehow dry above the water line. Additionally, you can detect more of her body and the dress below the water's surface, something that did not register on the VHS print. Colors are far more vibrant. In one shot of the camp at dawn you can see the slight orange hue caused by the sunrise. On the VHS this registers as a dull white sky. You can see more of the background during night scenes where the on the VHS most of it was not visible. The end result is a much more beautiful film than what was previously available. The soundtrack appears to have been remixed, but otherwise is far clearer that the slightly muted sound available on the previous versions.Now, on to the movie review. This is a very, very dumb film. But then again, what romance film has not been? Directed by the late Duncan Gibbins, the director who's previous claim to fame was the Glen Frey music video ""Smuggler's Blues"", it is filled with scenes highly contrived just to move the story along. Take the previously mentioned Ophelia scene. Duncan wanted a scene that not only set up the boy meets girl scenario, but wanted the audience to immediately understand why both characters would immediately fall in lust for each other on first sight. For the girls in the audience you have Craig Sheffer showing off his muscles in a nearly not there tank top, all sweaty from running through the woods. Sheffer is an inmate at a work camp for juvenile delinquents. The cam commandant ( Jon Polito ) makes such a big deal through the film as how no one escapes from his camp, that it makes no sense that the film opens up with him allowing the entire camp to play a game of man hunt in the woods unaccompanied. You would expect most, if not all of the inmates to keep running and never return, something that never occurs to them as they all return to the camp when the game concludes. The camp itself alternates from high security to lapse security depending on if any characters need to slip out undetected. It doesn't even seem to have a fence.Madsen is a student at a strict all girl catholic school, the kind that turns out more nuns that scholars. Gibbins has already made Sheffer sexually desirable to the females in the audience, now it is time to portray Madsen as the perfect wet dream. While evading the other inmates during the game of manhunt, Sheffer finds himself alone and above a cliff where he spots the body of a girl in the pond below. He climbs down the cliff for a closer look and sees Madsen in a soaking wet white dress floating on her back in the water. Sheffer accidentally snaps a twig, which causes Madsen to open her eyes, not only revealing that she is indeed alive, but allowing her to see the muscular sweating Sheffer peering at her from behind a tree. Embarrassed, Sheffer runs off. Madsen then closes her eyes, lifts her arms out of the water, and proceeds to squeeze a remote she is holding in one of her hands. It triggers a camera on the shore to snap pictures of her. We later find out that Madsen is a photographer, and had decided that day to take pictures of herself recreating the famous painting of Ophelia drowning. It is highly unlikely that a strict boarding school would allow one of it's girls to wander off into the woods unaccompanied, especially to do something that could potentially lead to an accidental drowning. And this is a school with a wandering armed guard.Now that boy has met girl, the plot has to come up with a reason for them to meet again. After realizing the boy she had seen is from the local prison camp, Madsen stands up in her class and suggests to the mother superior that they hold a school dance and invite the delinquents over. Somehow she makes an argument the otherwise strict nun agrees with, and the dance is held. The whole point of an all girl Catholic school, especially one segregated way off by itself in the woods, is to keep the girls as far away from boys as possible. Chaperoned or not, the nuns running the school would never agree to inviting boys over for a dance, especially if those boys were all convicted juveniles. The dance goes beyond allowing Madsen and Sheffer to meet face to face. From there they began planning rendezvous, finally getting caught in a cemetery mausoleum after having sex ( ugh! ). Predictably, the adults do not want them seeing each other again. Madsen's absent parents are coming to take her away, perhaps to send her to a more reclusive boarding school. Sheffer is sent to solitary and in the morning will be sent to the state penitentiary. But he escapes, then breaks Madsen out of her school, and together they run away into the mountains to live as fugitives. The film ends with a sort of spoiler, so I will say no more of the plot. But I will say it could have had a more dramatic ending had Paramount not gone for the obligatory happy ending instead.Okay, the movie is dumb, predictable and very contrived. The supporting characters are more comic book than realistic. But as long as you do not think about it, the movie seems to work. Gibbins succeeds in making both Madsen and Sheffer very sexually desirable, and there is effective chemistry between the two actors. That would make this movie a guilty pleasure. And judging by the multiple online requests over the years to release this movie on DVD, many have found this movie very pleasurable. The question is how many? It was not in the theaters that long, was only briefly on home video, and has aired very sporadically on television. This movie could have millions of fans, or just a few thousand. It is so far off the radar that no one knows yet how well this movie will sell. On the other hand, it does have the potential of finding a brand new fan base.  The Twilight films are every bit as dopey and are extremely popular. Substitute hunky teenage prison inmates for hunky teenage vampires and werewolves and you have the same basic formula. I could see Twilight fans adding this film to their library. And who knows, if they sell enough DVDs then maybe a deluxe DVD with all the extras will follow.",3,"Finally on DVD, but worth the wait?",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,11407,"['am', 'going', 'begin',

217457,A5GIYITYJPWN1,6300215636,"L P ""lilip""","[3, 10]","This movie was totally incoherent and all over the place. It went from being a serious thriller about abused prison inmates a la ""Full Metal Jacket"" in the first five minutes to something like  ""Stripes"" in the next 10 and then to 80s prom night teen flick and finally back to some ""The Fugitive"" type of thriller. It was just bizarre. One minute you got the prison guard unload a bunch of inmates in the woods making them chase one of their fellow inmates whom they give a 2 minute advantage to get a head start in a rather barbaric game, the next thing you see is the same overseer hanging out with the inmates laughing and joking and even taking them out on the town to the local movie theater. It was like going from ""Shawshank Redemption"" to ""Private Benjamin"" or something. It is almost as if the character have no self awareness or knowledge about who they are and what they did five minutes ago.The story is that of a girl from a strict catholic boarding school falling in love with one of the prisoners and their efforts to stay together: she by running away from home essentially and him escaping prison - even though he is about to be released in nine months. Isnt't that brilliant and oh so romantic? So they engage in all sorts of stupid, cringe-worthy actions, totally ruining their lives and chances of a future together, by trying to be together - right here, right now. It is supposed to be romantic, and I am all for romantic, feel good movies, but here it just felt supremely stupid and insincere. Like two dumb teenagers who know nothing of the world or love for that matter trying to successfully defy the evil cops. Ridiculous.It seemed like the writers wanted this movie to be too many things at the same time, such as love story, drama, teen flick, forbidden love, prison abuse, social statement about the effects of imprisonment, thriller etc - but explored none of those themes really. It just felt jumbled together from every aspect. The story is incoherent, character development non existent and portrayals completely unbelievable.  The premise couldn't also be any dumber, well maybe except for the ending where these two flop house toys are seen running towards the sunset to live happily ever after with no job, no money, no education and no future: just a runaway teenager and a con who escaped prison. Uh-huh.I fail to understand all the positive reviews as story and character wise this movie was low quality on every aspect. I am a big fan of cheesy, lightheaded 80s teenflicks but this was taking the notion of suspending disbelief to new heights, not to mention that it became nearly impossible to root for the characters and their plight.
