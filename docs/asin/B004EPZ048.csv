I agree with the majority here that Mars Needs Moms is a worthwhile family film, that-in my opinion-every family should share together. Heck, I even recommend it be purchased as it's definitely worth every penny. It's a brilliantly humorous touching tale.The story is about a young boy named Milo who finds out just how much he needs his mom when she is kidnapped by a group of aliens from Mars. Attempting to save her when she is abducted, Milo ends up coming along for the ride. Reaching Mars and being nabbed by the aliens, he gets some help from an unlikely friend named Gribble. Gribble and Milo make friends and set out on a crazy mission to save Milo's mom.While I feel the critics got it all wrong with this movie, I do feel that some movies just aren't meant to be released in theaters no matter how good they are. Let's face it, if it isn't a high profile CGI movie(like Toy Story, Shrek or Ice Age)--most movies of this type are doomed to fail. At least, with releasing it on DVD, it can be a moderate success if not a great success. I expect Mars Needs Moms to be of the latter, given time.Don't listen to the critics, though.

Velasquez,"[2, 2]","Most Disney films tend to have a positive message that matches with the overall mission of the Disney Empire itself, you know, this thing about the happiest place on earth. That's said, the colorful and fascinating ""Mars Needs Moms"" follows that path, this time the message being the love to our mothers.The film is based on a book by cartoonist Berkeley Breathed, who you may recognize for his comic strip Bloom County. We immediately meet Milo, a young boy who has a disagreement with his mother because he doesn't want to eat his vegetables. He tries to outsmart her and gets caught. He is reprimanded by his mother and sent to his room. Angry at her, he says, ""My life would be so much better if I didn't have a mom at all."" These words came at a bad moment, because it is precisely at that time that some Martians kidnap his mother to take her to their planet. Fortunately, Milo realizes what is happening, and, unbeknown to the Martians, gets inside the spacecraft just in time.Once in Mars, Milo tries to take his mother back to earth. For his good luck, he meets Gribble - who steals the movie --, who agrees to help him. It turns out that the Martians kidnapped Milo's mom because she has ""order and discipline."" Because of these qualities, they want to extract her memory, and are planning to take it out and put it in a nanny box (actually, the story is a little more complex). Furthermore, the surface of the planet is inhabited only by females, ruled by a little lady dictator named ""The Supervisor."" All the boys are sent underground to fend for themselves. So it is up to Milo and his friends to save his mother before she becomes victim of the Supervisor's plan.As I mentioned before, ""Mars Needs Moms"" is very colorful and it is truly a visual treat. It also has intense at moments, with a truly rewarding ending. It took a lot of effort and imagination to put this movie together, based on the simple premise that we should love our mothers. The Blu-ray and DVD edition of this film includes and extended opening, deleted scenes, a feature about life in Mars, and much more. Released August 9, 2011.

Big minus.Milo's mom look's more like a male then a female. Another big minus.Milo's mom get's next to no screen time. Huge plus.Cleaver gadgets That is both fun and interesting to watch.The martins are both fun and well animated with very expressive dialogue.The alien Ki is a very fun twist on a 60's style flower power girl.Gribble has brilliant dialogue to bad he is ruined by poor 3D animators.The story is very daring and best avoided by any one who thinks movies are real or believes every movie has a message.All in all this movie will not be a hit and will no doubt be a miss.Watch it? I'd say onceReplay value? Two times may be three?Worth it for the aliens? Yes if you can stand the crappy job on the humans.Should the studio take another stab at this movie?

1402773,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004EPZ048,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 7]","Simon Wells is known for his storyboard art work for ""Shrek 2"", ""Antz"", ""Madagascar"", as well as directing animated films such as ""An Americna Tail: Fievel Goes West"" and ""The Time Machine"".This time around, Wells joins filmmaker/producer Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future"" films, ""The Polar Express"", ""The Monster House"", ""Beowulf"") for the animated film ""Mars Needs Moms"".  A film based on the book of the same title by Berkeley Breathed.VIDEO:""Mars Needs Moms"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The film looks absolutely great in HD.  With the animation process that Robert Zemeckis used for ""Polar Express"", he tries to bring that realism to ""Mars Needs Moms"". There is great detail on the facial expressions, especially how the talent were motion-captured.  There is a sense of realism with the characters and I absolute love the CG detail for not only the characters but their surroundings.  And the detail really does show on Blu-ray.Because the film takes place on Mars, there is a good number of scenes that showcase fire, many reds, oranges and browns and for the most part, these vibrant colors really pop.  There is a lot of detail when it comes to the metallic parts, the gears, the weapons, the spacecraft,  computer displays, etc.But I know that for many people, the main contention of the CG animation is the overall look of the characters.  For one, ""Mars Needs Moms"" follows up the style that Zemeckis did with ""The Polar Express"" and that is CG animation with realism.  Disney is know for its Pixar films and there is a difference when it comes to their style of films.Personally, I enjoyed the look of Zemeckis' ""The Polar Express"" and even ""The Monster House"", especially how the technology was used on ""Beowulf"".  But for a children's film, the look might be too creepy.I showed it to my son and to me, he wasn't bothered by it.  He actually enjoyed the film , so I know critics have tried to come up with reasons of why the film didn't perform well in the box office and some point towards the animation but I personally don't think the animation was the problem.If anything, the CG looks great on Blu-ray and those who didn't watch the film in theaters, will definitely enjoy it in HD!As for teh DVD, the DVD is presented in widescreen (2:40:1 aspect ratio) - enhanced for 169 televisions.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Mars Needs Moms"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.The lossless soundtrack for ""Mars Needs Moms"" is fantastic!  From the blasts of the spacecraft, the sounds of Milo falling in the trash heap, the laser blasts to the sounds of the oxygen mask shattering, there is a good amount of surround sound usage in this film but also how there is slight echoes to the dialogue of characters depending on the rooms that they are at.So, while there is crystal clear dialogue and music coming from the front and center channels, the surround and rear surround channels are used very well throughout the film.  I was absolutely pleased by the lossless soundtrack.As for the DVD version, the DVD is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Mars Needs Moms: 2-Disc Combo Pack Edition"" comes with the following special features:Fun with Seth - (2:28) How Seth Green made things much more fun for the cast and crew behind-the-scenes.Martian 101 - (2:51) Developing the alien language for ""Mars Needs Moms"".Deleted Scenes with Simon Wells introductions - (28:51) Featuring the extended opening and deleted scenes.  Featuring the Full Motion-Capture experience.  Behind the scenes footage of the actors` performances are captured. 7 deleted scenes of which four are exclusive to the Blu-ray 2D release. Some cool scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. Now you can see them with introductions by director Simon Wells.EASTER EGG:Highlight ""Fun with Seth"" in Special Features and press up and you will see a panel show flowers.  Click and you will access the ""Flower Power"" easter egg.""Flower Power"" Easter Egg - (:51) the name of the show that Ki watched and learned English from.EXTRAS:""Mars Needs Moms: 2-Disc Combo Pack Edition"" comes with a Blu-ray and DVD version of the film and special features.  Also, included is a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:A fantastic family film with a good amount of action and adventure. ""Mars Needs Moms: 2-Disc Combo Pack Edition"" is absolutely wonderful on Blu-ray!""Mars Needs Moms"" despite its title that may make children think this is a film for daughters, the film is definitely for children who love action and adventure, and also add sci-fi to the mix!  The film was much more than I expected and watching it together with 8-year-old, we both enjoyed the film from beginning to end.Of course, I am aware of how the film did terribly in the box office.  As many critics have pointed the finger towards Zemeckis' and his use of the CG technology of realism not being for the children.  The fact is that many children's films tend to have featured on animals and or objects, Zemeckis' films use actual beings and tries to interject realism to those characters.We have seen the efficacy of films such as ""The Polar Express"" and ""Monster House"" and while not following the typical Disney formula of human characters that lack realism or not using animals or objects as its main characters, ""Mars Needs Moms"" in my opinion is not the animation that was at fault. Granted, some people may find the realism creepy, I didn't, my son didn't and I just don't think that the animation was at fault.I personally feel that the title had something to do with it.  Call it something else without ""Moms"" in the title or focus on the adventures that are taking place in Mars and it gives young kids a different idea of what the film is about.  Heck, call it ""Space Adventures in Mars"" and that would probably get children all excited.""Mars Needs Moms"" will definitely be an eye-opener for parents as we see the mom and child arguments (more like, children not wanting to listen and are being a bit more rebellious at the age of 8-years and older) and just that opening sequence alone shows you the mindset of children and children probably will not want a title with ""moms"", they may love their moms but as these kids grow older, the less they will publicly acknowledge it and probably will not want to be seen in a public theater watching a film about rescuing mom.The title also gives a feeling that the film is maybe for young little girls when in fact the film can be enjoyed by any child and families but not limited to a certain demographic.  So, it makes me wonder if the title was even tested with children to see what their reactions are.  Sure, we know that children love their moms but children at that age are also trying to be defiant and rebellious towards their moms as well.Regardless of what transpired in the box office, I do feel that this film can have new life on video.  The story is fun, the Blu-ray of ""Mars Needs Moms"" is absolutely gorgeous. There is a lot of detail, vibrant colors and for Disney Blu-ray fans, they know what to expect and that is quality when it comes to picture quality.  And for audio, once again...fantastic!  7.0 DTS-HD MA lossless soundtrack and you get an immersive soundscape.  Wonderful audio quality and once again, fans with a home theater system will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release!I do feel that Disney went a little lax on the special features.  Aside from deleted scenes, the other two features are only two minutes long.  An audio commentary would have been nice or even a gag reel.With the Blu-ray release, you have two choices.  One is a 2-Disc Combo Pack with the Blu-ray and DVD and then there is the 4-disc combo pack which those with a 3D-enabled television and Blu-ray player can enjoy the film in 3D and also get the regular Blu-ray, DVD and also digital copy of the film.  It's important to note that the 4-disc version also has a special exclusive feature in 3D.Overall, ""Mars Needs Moms"" was a lot better than I expected.  In fact, as a parent of a child who is also starting to back-talk with his mother, not eat his broccoli and also complaining about chores, I watched my son's reaction to the film, especially during its most emotional moment.  But realizing that while the film has plenty of action and adventure to keep children interested in the film, there is also a message for the children to also respect their mother.It's a situation I'm sure many mothers and their young children go through but I was glad to see how that message of mother/child bond was integrated into the film.While ""Mars Needs Mom"" may not have the typical Disney look for its CG animation, I still feel it was an enjoyable sci-fi, adventure family film.  I'm not saying its perfect, nor is it great but it is enjoyable, fun and a family film that parents and children can enjoy together.Recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: Very good film with awesome PQ/AQ,

The talent was there, with a fine cast, a seasoned group of artists behind the scenes and an interesting idea. I just wonder what might have happened had this been a CG or a live action movie.Motion capture, or as it is now insistently known, ""performance capture,"" records the actions of the actors and transfers them into what is more akin to the ""rotoscoping"" process in Gulliver's Travels (1939). It seems best used for non-human creatures, like Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, or to affect a total dreamlike feeling, as in The Polar Express. Somehow it is emerging more as a tool than a medium.When I saw Jim Carrey in A Christmas Carol, I really wanted to see his own face, since he was doing such an outstanding job. I felt the same way about Joan Cusack in Mars. Why cover such artistry with a plastic sheet? Kind of like my Aunt Sadie's couch. (Sorry, that was a little harsh.)The aliens are less disturbing and odd than the humans in Mars Needs Moms. Maybe this process will keep getting better each time, but who knows. What is a fact is that Disney is now taking the words ""of Mars"" off John Carter of Mars to avoid any comparison. They needn't have worried--it's not the word ""Mars"" that kept people away, though many of us might have thought of the B-grade sci-fi comedy ""Mars Needs Women"" when hearing the title ""Mars Needs Moms.""The Blu-ray looks marvelous--this is a very elaborate production, so I would not say to avoid it, actually-- and there are a few extras, including footage of the actors before the process was added, which only serves to show how much we should have seen their real faces rather than overlays.",3,"Mars may need moms, but this film really need total ""performance capture?""",1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,1751,"['What', 'Mars', 'Needs', 'Moms', 'unfortunate', 'misfire', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'what', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'talent', 'was', 'there', 'fine', 'cast', 'seasoned', 'group', 'artists', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'idea', 'just', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'been', 'CG', 'live', 'action', 'movie.Motion', 'capture', 'now', 'insistently', 'known', 'performance', 'capture', 'actions', 'actors', 'transfers', 'what', 'more', 'akin', 'rotoscoping', 'process', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', '1939', 'best', 'used', 'non-human', 'creatures', 'Gollum', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'affect', 'total', 'dreamlike', 'feeling', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Somehow', 'emerging', 'more', 'tool', 'medium.When', 'saw', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'own', 'face', 'was', 'doing', 'such', 'outstanding', 'job', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Mars', 'Why', 'cover', 'such', 'artistry', 'plastic', 'sheet', 'Kind', 'Aunt', 'Sadie', 'couch', 'Sorry', 'was', 'little', 'harsh', 'aliens', 'are', 'less', 'disturbing', 'odd', 'humans', 'Mars', 'Needs', 'Moms', 'Maybe', 'process', 'will', 'keep', 'getting', 'better', 'time', 'who', 'What', 'fact', 'Disney', 'now', 'taking', 'words', 'Mars', 'John', 'Carter', 'Mars', 'avoid', 'comparison', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'not', 'word', 'Mars', 'kept', 'people', 'away', 'many', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'B-grade', 'sci-fi', 'comedy', 'Mars', 'Needs', 'Women', 'when', 'hearing', 'title', 'Mars', 'Needs', 'Moms', 'Blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'very', 'elaborate', 'production', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'avoid', 'actually', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'including', 'footage', 'actors', 'process', 'was', 'added', 'only', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'real', 'rather', 'overlays']",N/A

1402780,A2N2S9PPHMW016,B004EPZ048,JDavid,"[21, 26]","""Mars Needs Moms"" relates the adventures of Milo, a boy who seeks to rescue his kidnapped mother from Martians .  Based on a children's book by the famous comic strip author Berkeley Breathed, this animated film, while uneven in certain respects, excels in its depiction of sacrificial family love.  Milo is truly heroic in his single-minded determination to free his mother despite insurmountable odds and even a powerful temptation to give up.  I also found the Martian settings to be artistically imaginative, fascinating, and impressive.The film's portrayal of the relationship between an American mother and her son was not only realistic but profoundly moving.  Young Milo attempts to deceive his mother.  Like all good mothers, she catches him out and holds him accountable.  Like all disobedient children (which covers most of the human race at one time or another), Milo angrily lashes out at her.  In a moment that rings true with my own childhood and with our own children on occasion, Milo's mother is reduced to tears by her son's cruel words.  Milo tries to go to sleep but the guilt over his response to his mother troubles him.  He gets up to apologize, only to discover that he is, in one sense, too late.  His mother has disappeared.  In another sense, he arrives in the nick of time, just able to follow after the strange beings who have kidnapped his mother.  Love for his mother stoked by his remorse for his meanness fuel an unquenchable determination in Milo to rescue her.  Within a fast-paced, wildly fantastic and carelessly implausible animated movie, this true-to-life family relationship comes as somewhat of a surprise.  But the film succeeds brilliantly because the filmmakers remain true throughout to the theme of love between a mother and son.Milo's mother has been kidnapped by a radical feminist Martian society that has all but destroyed maternal love in its elevation of power and technological progress.  The Martians abandon their males at their planetary dump and leave their females to be raised by robot nursemaids.  But little ones, even in a twisted society, need more than a robot to be cared for properly.  Presumably unable and/or unwilling to provide quality maternal nature themselves, the Martian supervisors spy out likely outstanding mothers on planet Earth and kidnap the best candidates in an evil plan to enrich the maternal behavior of the robots.In his quest, Milo meets Gribble, a fellow human stranded on Mars with his own tragic story and Ki, the Martian who has rebelled against the oppressive Martian society.  The events that bring Milo and his new friends to the film's final climax uncover Mars' own dark secrets about motherhood and the family.It is unfortunate that ""Mars Needs Moms"" was a dismal flop at the box office.  The film's odd mix of a relatively serious theme in a wacky action-adventure animation vehicle may have hurt its reach.  Some may have been repelled by its central theme of the importance of motherhood and the natural family.  Surveys at a leading film website indicate that this film splits its audience, with people either loving or hating ""Mars Needs Moms,"" with relatively few in between.  Such a divergence indicates that people's fundamental views on life dictated their response to the film, not less weighty matters such as the animation style, humor, music, or plot devices.It is my hope that the mostly brilliant folks at Disney made a few marketing errors and missed their target audience.  If you believe that the natural human family is a fundamental, even divinely ordained social unit with motherhood being one of its key components, please give this film and the dvd a chance.

1402800,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B004EPZ048,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[18, 48]","As you would expect there are aliens in Mars Needs Moms, and they speak Martian. The makers of this wretched film saw no need to translate and, to be fair, nor is there any: no matter how incoherent their gibberish is, you don't need to understand it to get the gist, and to try to would be to miss the point.And that about sums up this film: that it is largely incoherent makes no odds; so diligently is it structured by rote you know exactly what is going on, how it will end and each of the Stations of the Cross you'll pass through on the miserable journey that is sitting through it.Usually, I like bad films. There's a voyeuristic pleasure in observing public displays of ineptitude. It's fun reviewing them. It's challenging trying to unpick what went wrong. Badness, in its way, can be entertaining and stimulating. But not with this picture.There is much to admire but nothing at all to like about Mars Needs Moms.There undoubted artisanship (some of which is revealed during the closing credits) in the physical performances required of actors, trussed up in rubber suits, donning CGI headsets and with motion detectors up the wazoo. But these days, it's still ho-hum: we have ceased to be thrilled or even distracted by excellent digital rendering. Technological achievement is a given.But it gives not nearly enough to make this experience worthwhile. A bad trip in cinematic 3-D is still a bad trip. You do wonder if they wouldn't have been better just filming the blessed thing and painting in the background. At least, that way, we could see the real (and eminently admirable) Joan Cusack rather than her ugly, animated approximation.You also wonder whose bright idea the film's basic premise was. It's a stinker: Mars is short of mums - sorry, *moms* - to bring up the Martian young. This shortage they overcome by abducting earthling mothers, sucking their mothering skills out of them (naturally, by pointing a concentrated beam of pure sunlight at their brains and vaporising them) and infusing the extracted essence of motherhood into ""nannybots"" which the Martians use to raise their young. (How, you might ask? More to the point, why? Wouldn't an intensive week's course in parenting skills from the Earthlings be a better, less wasteful thing?)So to the action. The Martians target suburban mid west America (and not Cambodia, Italy or the Sudan) for their ideal mom. They kidnap Joan Cusack's ugly avatar while her child Milo (even uglier) frets in his bed that he hasn't appreciated his mom enough. Guiltily he hops out of bed, sees flashing lights under the door (you know, a la Close Encounters) and gives chase while the aliens whisk her away, yielding enough Oedipal innuendo to last a lifetime: Well, at least someone appreciates her. Cue adventure.The Martians, it turns out, are run by an humourless old bat apparently modelled on an elderly Japanese lady, a character lending the film a weak misogynistic current and a stronger xenophobic one. But whatever the underlying politics, the set-up is just stupid: could they really not think of anything better than that? Martians kidnapping moms? Is this what now passes for wit?Continuity errors and illogicalities abound: on Mars, the Martians walk around in space suits. Apparently they don't need them on Earth.So Milo, of course, stows away, planning to rescue his stupefied mother (Cusack, too, must have been stupefied to agree to this). On arrival on Mars the semblance of dramatic or narrative artistry is jettisoned and the computer whizzkids are allowed to take over. The pace explodes, we're galloping around assorted tableaux ripped off from other films (Tron,Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,WALL-E,Star Wars,Toy Story,Avatar, evenLabyrinth), meeting new characters none of whom are explained, contextualised or justified and all of whom act in unaccountable ways.Most frenetic, over excited and irritating is Gribble (Dan Fogler), an Earthling left over from a previous mission. (Yes: we've been here before. Did they run out of Earth mom serum to inject their robots with?) Gribble isn't at all funny, though that doesn't seem to be how Fogler sees it. His performance, and really the whole film, reminded me of a recent Charlie Sheen interview. For those who haven't seen one, think Dennis Hopper inApocalypse Now. In a bad way.It is possible to surf over this tidal wave of absurdity because, no matter how little anything makes sense on a micro-level, on a macro level so slavish is this film's devotion to formula we know who the good guy is (Milo - even if it's tremendously hard to like him), we know who the bad guy is, and we know who the selfish, flawed helper is who comes through in the end. As the film stampedes towards its ridiculous conclusion there is a breathtakingly cynical swipe at emotion that only Disney would dream of trying to get away with - a straight-red-card, two-footed lunge of a leg breaker that is so grim I can't find the fortitude to even tell you about it.I walked out of the theatre grumpier than I'd entered it, and as neither of my kids enjoyed the film much either (by consensus the best bit was when Cujo the cat threw up three minutes in - and you can see that on the trailer), I was only returned to good humour when I heard that this film has created a Martian-sized crater at the box office.Gribble-un-tastic.Olly Buxton",1,Earth needs this movie like it needs a hole in the head.,1301961600,"04 5, 2011",2011,5362,"['would', 'expect', 'are', 'aliens',

1402801,AHF97M45JFCB,B004EPZ048,ONENEO,"[4, 4]","If you are at all concerned with the computer animated film industry, you probably know a little bit about Robert Zemeckis' unique approach of motion capture to achieve an animated product that looks remarkably lifelike (a technique he has proven in films like The Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol and Monster House thus far).  The unique stylized look is back in Mars Needs Moms and this one managed to secure the promotion and backing by none other than Disney - who of course has been making a big push in the computer generated feature arena themselves since the absorption of Pixar.The plot of this one is certainly unique with a welcome science fiction flare not as thoroughly fleshed out since Pixar's own Wall-E.  The story follows nine-year-old Milo (played by Seth Green for the motion capture but voiced by child actor Seth Dusky) who, like most kids his age, is more interested in watching zombie movies than doing chores or eating his broccoli at dinner. When Milo's misconduct prompts his mother (Joan Cusack) to punish him with an early bedtime and no zombie pay-per-view, a moment straight out of Home Alone ensues: ""I wish I didn't have a mother!"" and hence the lesson of being careful what you wish for commences.When Milo wakes to discover his mother is being kidnapped by Martians, fear of being probed is put on the backburner as he stages a rescue attempt that results in his being accidentally dragged along on for a ride to the red planet itself. Once there, Milo is befriended by a fellow earthling refuge calling himself Gribble (Dan Fogler), an overly enthusiastic man-child who's decades-long absence from Earth has left him trapped in the cultural mindset of the 1980s.Surprisingly enough, this picture comes from a long line of CG-feature films inspired by children's books (a list that includes How to Train Your Dragon, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Meet the Robinsons to mention a few).  The screenplay is surprisingly competent and while the intended audience of the film will likely be too swept up in the grandeur of the visuals to be concerned with such things, diehard scifi fans will likely be a bit frustrated by several questions of Marian society that are never fully answered.However, the film juggles some pretty heavy themes- the dangers of suppressing free will in society, reliance upon technology, the universal power of love and why moms are more than simply nagging buzz-kills for example- it does so with that trademarked Zemeckis brand of humor that has made past efforts like Back to the Future so endearing.  There are references scattered about that younger kids probably won't appreciate, but adults who remember a thing or two about the 80s will surely get a rise from.  The humor in Monster House was certainly more universally appealing but it is nice that not all kid-oriented films rely upon slapstick for laughs.The visuals here are an interesting mix of elements.  On the one hand, the motion capture technique is capable of delivering facial expressions that are truly without rival (after all, this is essentially the tool James Cameron used to develop the aliens in Avatar).  On the flip side it does away with the exaggerated characterizations kids flock to in your average DreamWorks or Pixar piece.  In fact, at a glance, the human characters here can almost pass as live-action with just a hint of aberrance in their faces.In all, this is a solid family film that doesn't tread upon objective language or themes that is rife with interesting environments, and a nice brisk pace that seems even quicker than its one-hour 22-minte runtime.",4,An Underhyped Disney Film With The Zemeckis Touch,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,3621,"['are', 'concerned', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'industry', 'probably', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'unique', 'approach', 'motion', 'capture', 'achieve', 'animated', 'product', 'remarkably', 'lifelike', 'technique', 'proven', 'films', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Beowulf', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Monster', 'House', 'thus', 'far', 'unique', 'stylized', 'look', 'back', 'Mars', 'Needs', 'Moms', 'one', 'managed', 'secure', 'promotion', 'backing', 'none', 'other', 'Disney', 'who', 'course', 'been', 'making', 'big', 'push', 'computer', 'generated', 'feature', 'arena', 'absorption', 'Pixar.The', 'plot', 'one', 'certainly', 'unique', 'welcome', 'science', 'fiction', 'flare', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Pixar', 'own', 'Wall-E', 'story', 'nine-year-old', 'Milo', 'played', 'Seth', 'Green', 'motion', 'capture', 'voiced', 'child', 'actor', 'Seth', 'Dusky', 'who', 'most', 'kids', 'age', 'more', 'interested', 'watching', 'zombie', 'movies', 'doing', 'chores', 'eating', 'broccoli', 'dinner', 'When', 'Milo', 'misconduct', 'mother', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'punish', 'early', 'bedtime', 'zombie', 'pay-per-view', 'moment', 'straight', 'Home', 'Alone', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'mother', 'hence', 'lesson', 'being', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'commences.When', 'Milo', 'discover', 'mother', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'Martians', 'fear', 'being', 'probed', 'put', 'backburner', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'results', 'being', 'accidentally', 'dragged', 'along', 'ride', 'red', 'planet', 'Once', 'there', 'Milo', 'befriended', 'fellow', 'earthling', 'refuge', 'calling', 'Gribble', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'overly', 'enthusiastic', 'man-child', 'who', 'decades-long', 'absence', 'Earth', 'left', 'trapped', 'cultural', 'mindset', '1980s.Surprisingly', 'enough', 'picture', 'long', 'line', 'CG-feature', 'films', 'inspired', 'children', 'books', 'list', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragon', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'mention', 'few', 'screenplay', 'surprisingly', 'competent', 'intended', 'audience', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'too', 'swept', 'up', 'grandeur', 'visuals', 'be', 'concerned', 'such', 'things', 'diehard', 'scifi', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'bit', 'frustrated', 'several', 'questions', 'Marian', 'society', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'answered.However', 'film', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'themes-', 'dangers', 'suppressing', 'free', 'will', 'society', 'reliance', 'technology', 'universal', 'power', 'love', 'why', 'moms', 'are', 'more', 'simply', 'nagging', 'buzz-kills', 'example-', 'so', 'trademarked', 'Zemeckis', 'brand', 'humor', 'made', 'efforts', 'Back', 'Future', 'endearing', 'are', 'references', 'scattered', 'younger', 'kids', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'adults', 'who', 'remember', 'thing', 'two', '80s', 'will', 'surely', 'get', 'rise', 'humor', 'Monster', 'House', 'was', 'certainly', 'more', 'universally', 'appealing', 'nice', 'not', 'kid-oriented', 'films', 'rely', 'slapstick', 'laughs.The', 'visuals', 'here', 'are', 'interesting', 'mix', 'elements', 'one', 'hand', 'motion', 'capture', 'technique', 'capable', 'delivering', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'truly', 'rival', 'essentially', 'tool', 'James', 'Cameron', 'used', 'develop', 'aliens', 'Avatar', 'flip', 'side', 'away', 'exaggerated', 'characterizations', 'kids', 'flock', 'average', 'DreamWorks', 'Pixar', 'piece', 'fact', 'glance', 'human', 'characters', 'here', 'can', 'almost', 'pass', 'live-action', 'just', 'hint', 'aberrance', 'faces.In', 'solid', 'family', 'film', ""n't"", 'tread', 'objective', 'language', 'themes', 'rife', 'interesting', 'environments', 'nice', 'brisk', 'pace', 'even', 'quicker', 'one-hour', '22-minte', 'runtime']",N/A

Sometimes, I think you really need to send in a kid to do a kids' job - particularly in reviewing a movie made for kids. Adults just don't get it. Here are video reviews by 2 of our 8 -year-old youth film critics reviews and, believe me, they loved it!The DVD comes out this week so don't pass it by, give it the good old family try.""This movie is out of this world literally, because it takes place on Mars, A.K.A The Red Planet. The movie is about a little boy named Milo voiced by Seth Dusky, who says some pretty mean things to his mom. Before he has a chance to apologize, she is Martian-napped and taken to Mars. He has 6.93 earth hours until sun rise to save her. Does he make it in time!My favorite part is when Gribble, voiced by Dan Fogler, saves Milo's mom with the helmet that was meant for his mom. I thought that was very thoughtful. My favorite characters are Gribble, because he's just simply Gribbletastic. Ki, because she helps Milo, and she does something that no other Martain has ever done. She stands up to the supervisor. Head of all Martians, Milo, because he realizes that he needs his mom and is determined to do whatever he needs to save her.I rate this movie 4 out of 5 stars because the Martains are a little scary, especially the supervisor. So for this reason I recommend this movie to kids ages 7 and up."" Reviewed by Ny'Asia Bell, age 8, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic""I just finished watching an excellent movie called ""Mars Needs Moms."" The movie is about a boy named Milo who goes on a big adventure to help save his mom from aliens. The aliens that live on Mars are not very good mothers so they look to Earth to find good mothers to steal.My favorite characters are Milo, Milo's mom, and Gribble.  I liked Gribble because he helped Milo get his mother back and he helps Milo to see how important his mother truly is. My favorite part of the movie is when Milo has to save his new friend Gribble from the aliens. Gribble gets captured and the aliens are going to shoot him. Milo swings in to save the day and it is awesome.This movie does have some characters that are bad and try to stop Milo from saving his mom. The aliens in the uniforms are bad because they listen to the Supervisor. The Supervisor controls everyone and wants everyone to do what she says.I would recommend this movie for ages three and up. I think depending on what age you are is how you will see this movie. For example, my brother is 5 and he didn't think the movie was scary at all. I am 8 and I found the movie to be a little scary because it made me think about how sad I would be if I lost my own mother. But don't worry everything turns out ok in the end!

1402818,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004EPZ048,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0According to Wikipedia, 'Mars needs Moms', was the 5th biggest box office bomb in motion picture history. It cost about $150 million and the lifetime, world-wide gross was a little over $21 million. So where exactly did it go wrong? It's one of those films made using motion capture technology. The critics were split on the use of that technology: some dug it quite a bit and others found the characters to be like Madame Tussaud wax figures. Personally, I wasn't bothered by actors who had their movements and facial features, filled in by the magic of computer animation. And if you wait for the end credits, you'll see outtakes of just how the cast looked, when acting as 'motion capture' subjects.'Mars' is based on a sci-fi, black comedy picture book of the same name by Berkeley Breathed. The adaptation is geared much more for adults than kids as it has quite a bit of a dark sub-text, that perhaps is a bit too off-putting for many viewers. For starters, nine-year-old protagonist Milo's declaration during the film's opening scene, that he wished he never had a mother, is a bit jarring; this especially after his mother merely asks him to take out the garbage and punishes him for not eating his broccoli. The kid immediately regrets his harsh rejoinder and spends the entire time trying to make up for the faux pas. The heartbroken look on the mother's face stays with you despite the fact that such a harsh statement emanates from a kid's mouth.If there is a positive side to the film, it's in the action adventure component. Milo's adventures, as he manages to stow away on the ship that's his kidnapped Mom now finds herself on, and how he escapes initial capture on the Red Planet, are exciting moments indeed. The idea of Gribble, the man-child, who jokes how he's a secret astronaut from an 80s Reagan era program but is actually like Milo (a kid who tried to save his Mom), doesn't quite hit the mark, not only because he's a buffoon but the fact that he's been stranded on Mars since his childhood after his Mom was also kidnapped. What's worse is that he actually witnessed the Martians performing their own version of a lobotomy on his Mom and failed to save her, which I would think is a disturbing idea for young viewers to take.There's more noir to endure when we discover that the Martian world is a vast police state run by females only (the childlike, ineffectual males are beneath the surface, existing in a giant trash compactor). The females are headed by 'The Supervisor', the film's antagonist, a Lady MacBeth-like, crazed control freak, who resembles a shriveled up, Spielberg Extraterrestrial. The mad Supervisor is a fun character and is pitted against Ki, who adopts the language of Hippies from an early 70s TV sitcom, which she finds in some secret files, she's assigned to oversee. Ki is the Mar's version of a beatnik, who enjoys painting colorful graffiti on the drab Martian home world. My problem with the Ki character is why is she the only one to break away from the pack? There seems no explanation for it, in the context of the story.Milo only has a few hours to save his mother, and you probably can guess the film's denouement if you haven't seen the film yet. It's all rather predictable and the film's scenarists lost a big opportunity when they failed to develop Milo's mother as a fully developed character. Instead of having her disappear for most of the narrative, strapped to a gurney, wouldn't it have been better if the Martians made her a sentient overseer--directing the nannybots (who also could have interactional capabilities) in proper parenting techniques (a more animated Picard Locutus, is the character I'm thinking of).For sheer action, Mars needs Moms, has some clever action scenes. But essentially it's a rescue story, and most of the characters prove to be decidedly one-note.

It seems Simon Wells (the great grandson of H.G. Wells) can't escape his past or the subjects of his grandfather's writing; ""Mars"" makes the second time that Wells has worked on a project that is somehow tied into his great-grandfather's work (he also directed the recent live action version of ""The Time Machine"").It seems that good moms are being kidnapped by Martians and young hero Milo (Seth Dusky--motion capture performance by Seth Green)gets whisked away with his mom (Joan Cusack)to the Red Planet and he must figure out a way to get both of them back to Earth. With the assistance of Reagan era secret astronaut Gribble (Dan Fogler) Milo must stop the Martians from doing something evil and wrong to his mom.""Mars Needs Moms"" looks positively stunning in HD. Colors pop and there's a level of detail that the BD disc provides nice resolution for. Audio is presented in 7.1 DTS-HD and sounds terrific as well. It's too bad that the film didn't get a bigger audience but that had more to do with marketing and less with the quality of the film itself.The special features are quite nice as well. We get a commentary track featuring director Wells, Green and Fogler (clearly recorded before the film premiered because they seem quite optimistic about the future of the film as a Disney franchise).""Life on Mars"" focuses on the motion capture shooting that provided the basis for the animation.""Martian 101"" allows us to find out about the creation of the Martian language and culture for the film.""Fun with Seth"" takes us behind-the-scenes on the set letting us see the cast goof off a bit.We also get deleted scenes and an alternate beginning in various states of completion with an introduction by director Simon Wells.It's a pity that ""Mars Needs Moms"" met with public indifference--if it had been marketed better it might have found it's audience as it's an entertaining film although not quite in the class of the work that Pixar does (although it does have a much darker story element than we would normally see in a Pixar flick).",4,Entertaining and unfairly slammed family flick,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,2164,"['Mars', 'Moms', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'mistaken', 'Apocalpyse', 'Now', 'much', 'less', 'Toy', 'Story', 'entertaining', 'diversion', 'Simon', 'Wells', 'great', 'grandson', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'past', 'subjects', 'grandfather', 'writing', 'Mars', 'second', 'time', 'Wells', 'worked', 'project', 'somehow', 'tied', 'great-grandfather', 'work', 'also', 'directed', 'recent', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'Time', 'Machine', '.It', 'good', 'moms', 'are', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'Martians', 'young', 'hero', 'Milo', 'Seth', 'Dusky', 'motion', 'capture', 'performance', 'Seth', 'Green', 'whisked', 'away', 'mom', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Red', 'Planet', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'Earth', 'assistance', 'Reagan', 'era', 'secret', 'astronaut', 'Gribble', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'Milo', 'must', 'stop', 'Martians', 'doing', 'something', 'evil', 'wrong', 'mom', 'Mars', 'Needs', 'Moms', 'positively', 'stunning', 'HD', 'Colors', 'pop', 'level', 'detail', 'BD', 'disc', 'nice', 'resolution', 'Audio', 'presented', '7.1', 'DTS-HD', 'terrific', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bigger', 'audience', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'marketing', 'less', 'quality', 'film', 'itself.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'director', 'Wells', 'Green', 'Fogler', 'clearly', 'recorded', 'film', 'premiered', 'seem', 'quite', 'optimistic', 'future', 'film', 'Disney', 'franchise', 'Life', 'Mars', 'motion', 'capture', 'shooting', 'provided', 'basis', 'animation', 'Martian', '101', 'find', 'out', 'creation', 'Martian', 'language', 'culture', 'film', 'Fun', 'Seth', 'behind-the-scenes', 'set', 'letting', 'see', 'cast', 'goof', 'bit.We', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'beginning', 'various', 'states', 'completion', 'introduction', 'director', 'Simon', 'Wells.It', 'pity', 'Mars', 'Needs', 'Moms', 'met', 'public', 'indifference', 'had', 'been', 'marketed', 'better', 'might', 'have', 'found', 'audience', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'class', 'work', 'Pixar', 'have', 'much', 'darker', 'story', 'element', 'would', 'normally', 'see', 'Pixar', 'flick']",N/A

My only issue is that for some reason there appears to be a slight gap either side of the screen so it doesn't get flushed up to the screen edge fully. Have no idea why but my projector has a basic zoom feature so I can overcome this issue. Would still love to know why it's formatted that way though.
