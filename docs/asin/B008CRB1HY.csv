I understand now from watching this movie that I may have been trying to enjoy NCIS as serious plausible drama when, in fact, if it is seen for the comic farce it is might be quite entertaining.This movie is fun.  I find it endlessly entertaining how women half the cop's age can't wait to , ( self censored ) , with him etc.  Funny beyond words.The plot and characters might have made a serious movie except for the overacting, coincidences, and holes in the storyline.  Not to worry, this is a comedy not serious after all.The final scene ( no spoiler alert needed ) really sums up the tone of the entire movie.....a cult of personality.

But I watched the movie and it was awful.  Not just because Harmon is so not Lucas, but also because the acting, and I use the term loosely, was awful.  Even Harmon, whom I love in NCIS and never miss.  I almost could not make it through the movie and would never watch it again.  If you are a huge Harmon fan, and I really like him, and you were not familiar with the books, you might give this a 3 or 4. I cannot understand how anyone could give it a 5, but that is just my opinion and obviously different from some others.  What is so disappointing is that the company that made this movie owns the rights to ALL the Lucas Davenport movies.  I wish the movie-makers would realize that fans of books want their characters and stories to follow the books as closely as possible.  Otherwise, what's the point of basing a movie on a book?
