60292,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,0783227981,Cubist,"[3, 3]","For my money, Fletch is the best film Chevy Chase ever made. I can pop it in my player almost any time and still find the movie just as funny, no matter how many times I've seen it. And yet, the film is too often dismissed as just another dated piece of 1980s pop-culture. Or worse, it is deemed the sole highlight of Chase's career that subsequently went downhill over the years.So why does Fletch continue to inspire such a strong and loyal following after almost 20 years? Insanely quotable dialogue, a colorful assortment of character actors and, of course, Chevy Chase's inimitable, vintage smart-aleck mode.Chase shows a stellar range of physical comedy in this movie. His technique ranges from broader displays, such as the dream sequence when he imagines himself as the unusually aggressive L.A. Lakers star power forward, to more subtle bits such as when he bangs his nose into a door, posing as the accident-prone Mr. Poon.Capitalizing on the immensely popular action comedy, Beverly Hills Cop, Fletch adheres to the same formula: the maverick protagonist who has a problem with authority, the use of multiple disguises to get in and out of dicey situations for comedic effect, the obligatory car chase, and even the hopelessly dated synth-soundtrack by Harold Faltermeyer. Fletch deviates in one significant aspect: Chase's character never uses a gun (he also repeatedly gets the bejeezus kicked out of him).Fletch is essentially a vehicle tailor-made for Chevy Chase. It plays to Chase's strengths; in addition to his affinity for physical comedy, the movie is famous for showcasing his trademark deadpan delivery of dialogue and his knack for playing a wide variety of characters - abilities he perfected on Saturday Night Live. Chase expertly juggles Fletch's numerous aliases. From the likes of the absent-minded, Dr. Rosenrosen to Mr. Underhill's country club &quot;friend,&quot; John Cocktosten, Chase makes each one distinctive and hilariously memorable.Another aspect of Fletch that makes it so memorable is the strong supporting cast. The film features character actors like Joe Don Baker as the slimy Chief of Police Karlin (who brings a wonderfully scary intensity to his role), George Wendt as the amiable drug dealer Fat Sam, Tim Matheson as the double-dealing bigamist Alan Stanwyk, M. Emmet Walsh as the probing Dr. Dolan, and a young, pre-Thelma and Louise Geena Davis as Larry, Fletch's ever loyal co-worker. One of the joys of the movie is how Chase interacts with all these people and how they react to his flippant, off-handed remarks. Watch him in action in the hospital sequence as he confuses and befuddles the staff in order to get the information he wants -- it's not only what he says to them but, more importantly, how he delivers the dialogue that makes it so funny.More so than in any other film, Fletch is classic Chevy Chase. While he's in exceptional form in Caddyshack and National Lampoon's Vacation, they don't showcase his unique talents as befittingly as Fletch. In every scene, Chase does a fantastic job carrying the picture.",5,&quot;...put it on the Underhills' bill...&quot;,1057622400,"07 8, 2003",2003,3075,"['money', 'Fletch', 'best', 'film', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'ever', 'made', 'can', 'pop', 'player', 'almost', 'time', 'still', 'find', 'movie', 'just', 'funny', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'film', 'too', 'often', 'dismissed', 'as', 'just', 'dated', 'piece', '1980s', 'pop-culture', 'worse', 'deemed', 'sole', 'highlight', 'Chase', 'career', 'subsequently', 'went', 'downhill', 'years.So', 'why', 'Fletch', 'continue', 'inspire', 'strong', 'loyal', 'following', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'Insanely', 'quotable', 'dialogue', 'colorful', 'assortment', 'character', 'actors', 'course', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'inimitable', 'vintage', 'smart-aleck', 'mode.Chase', 'stellar', 'range', 'physical', 'comedy', 'movie', 'technique', 'broader', 'displays', 'such', 'dream', 'sequence', 'when', 'unusually', 'aggressive', 'L.A.', 'Lakers', 'star', 'power', 'forward', 'more', 'subtle', 'bits', 'such', 'when', 'nose', 'door', 'posing', 'accident-prone', 'Mr.', 'Poon.Capitalizing', 'immensely', 'popular', 'action', 'comedy', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'Fletch', 'same', 'formula', 'maverick', 'protagonist', 'who', 'problem', 'authority', 'use', 'multiple', 'disguises', 'get', 'dicey', 'situations', 'comedic', 'effect', 'obligatory', 'car', 'chase', 'even', 'hopelessly', 'dated', 'synth-soundtrack', 'Harold', 'Faltermeyer', 'Fletch', 'one', 'significant', 'aspect', 'Chase', 'character', 'never', 'gun', 'also', 'repeatedly', 'bejeezus', 'kicked', '.Fletch', 'essentially', 'vehicle', 'tailor-made', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Chase', 'strengths', 'addition', 'affinity', 'physical', 'comedy', 'movie', 'famous', 'showcasing', 'trademark', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'dialogue', 'knack', 'playing', 'wide', 'variety', 'characters', 'abilities', 'perfected', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Chase', 'expertly', 'Fletch', 'numerous', 'aliases', 'likes', 'absent-minded', 'Dr.', 'Rosenrosen', 'Mr.', 'Underhill', 'country', 'club', 'quot', 'friend', 'quot', 'John', 'Cocktosten', 'Chase', 'one', 'distinctive', 'hilariously', 'memorable.Another', 'aspect', 'Fletch', 'so', 'memorable', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'features', 'character', 'actors', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'slimy', 'Chief', 'Police', 'Karlin', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'scary', 'intensity', 'role', 'George', 'Wendt', 'amiable', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Fat', 'Sam', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'double-dealing', 'bigamist', 'Alan', 'Stanwyk', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'probing', 'Dr.', 'Dolan', 'young', 'pre-Thelma', 'Louise', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Larry', 'Fletch', 'ever', 'loyal', 'co-worker', 'One', 'joys', 'movie', 'how', 'Chase', 'interacts', 'people', 'how', 'react', 'flippant', 'off-handed', 'remarks', 'Watch', 'action', 'hospital', 'sequence', 'staff', 'order', 'get', 'information', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'dialogue', 'so', 'funny.More', 'so', 'other', 'film', 'Fletch', 'classic', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'exceptional', 'form', 'Caddyshack', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', 'do', ""n't"", 'showcase', 'unique', 'talents', 'as', 'befittingly', 'Fletch', 'scene', 'Chase', 'fantastic', 'job', 'carrying', 'picture']",N/A

Sure, I'm as big of a Chevy Chase fan as the next guy, but I honestly can't see why the first Fletch film is that highly regarded. While Chase films like Vacation, Caddyshack, and even Three Amigos showed what most enjoyed about him, being that quirky clumsy oaf that we saw on Saturday Night Live, it was Fletch that shown the clever, cool, and slick character of Chase that hinted humor ever so dryly with one liners that took a few seconds to get. In alot of ways this film, based on the popular novels, isn't really a comedy at all, more like a comedic drama. It's plot is simple, Fletch is a newspaper reporter while underground on a drug story stumbles upon another strange case that somehow intertwines with his first and it's up to his uncovering skills and cheap disguises to find out what's all behind it, mocking all involved along the way. Very 80's in style, but truly shows why Chase was SNL's first breakthru star. It ain't Vacation or Caddyshack in the laughter department, but with his undertone wisecracks every so often, it really makes for a different paced Chase flix. As for this 2007 DVD re-release, it now has a new documentary, featuring another member of my generation showing his love for the flix ad nauseum, a 5.1 update, and a montage or two. No new Chase involvement, but if you never bought it before and still want to, this would be a good purchase. Also, this disc is in the newer 2008 ""The Fletch Collection"" with the underperforming sequel Fletch Lives, made a whopping five years later and it shows, but the discs are exactly the same, and this time you don't get that cool lenticular cover as on the single.

Such was third grade.Many years later, I made the mistake of selling my VHS copy of Fletch in a bulk auction with about thirty-three other tapes.  I was moving, so it made sense, but I regretted losing my only copy -- and there was no DVD available to replace it!So now the movie has been released on DVD (a second time after a gap of a few years) in the ""Jane Doe Edition,"" so named for Irwin Fletcher's by-line.  And now that I am married, and my wife has seen the movie with me, I am aware of the movie's shortcomings.  In fact, if you don't like Chevy Chase, you might think this movie is just downright dumb.  But I find it so easy to identify with a character who uses his wits to get himself out of trouble that I can easily overlook some less-than-credible plot elements and the use of Geena Davis as a doormat.Here's how the story goes: Fletch is an investigative reporter pretending to be a junkie, blending in on the LA beach with many who are the real thing.  He is trying to find out the source behind the drugs so that he can make headlines in the newspaper he works for.  At the same time, he is offered $50,000 and a foolproof escape plan to kill a wealthy man named Alan Stanwyk, who says he is dying of bone cancer.Much of the story revolves around Fletch pretending to be other people while he gently pries information out of gullible and confused bystanders.  In a typical scene, Fletch passes for a government messenger (Mr. Poon) who has to collect information on allegations about the company Stanwyk has married into.  He interviews the CEO of Boyd Aviation, who also happens to be Alan Stanwyk's father-in-law, and finds out all kinds of information that helps get to the bottom of the unusual proposition.  Whether this seems credible or not is beside the point.  The characters Chase comes up with take center stage, as he wriggles his way into any subculture he pleases by using a few props and a quick wit.The ""Jane Doe Edition"" does have a few extras, of course, besides the external sleeve that reveals various Fletch identities, depending on perspective.  In the Special Features you will find a chuckleworthy mockumentary in which an amateur filmmaker does some interviews with people who worked on the movie.  There is also a brief bit in which the make-up artists and producers talk about the many disguises Fletch uses.  Besides the obligatory trailer, you will also find a clever montage piecing together some of the funniest moments of the movie, grouped loosely by category: foreign phrases, noises made with the mouth, et cetera.  It's fun for long-time fans in particular.One of my only misgivings about the DVD is the lack of any new Chevy Chase material.  There are no interviews with him, no commentaries, nothing more recent than what he did in the original movie.  His career is not exactly red-hot these days; would it have been so difficult to get him on board?  My guess is that his asking price was a bit too high, but there are legions of twenty- and thirty-something American men who make this movie a part of their own personal philosophy and religion.  It is this cult following which should keep the ""Jane Doe Edition"" sales strong for years to come.",4,"One of the best, if not the best, Chevy Chase role of all time",1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,3840,"['When', 'was', 'about', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'Fletch', 'was', 'released', 'movie', 'theaters', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Everything', 'was', 'cool', 'dorky', 'tall', 'guy', 'humor', 'car', 'chase', 'Alfa', 'Harold', 'Faltermeyer', 'soundtrack', 'Indeed', 'sat', 'top', 'list', 'withBeverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'detective-who-impersonates-people-with-hilarious-results', 'flick', 'Faltermeyer', 'score', 'Movies', 'Live', 'many', 'years', 'used', 'lines', 'such', 'Can', 'borrow', 'towel', 'just', 'hit', 'water', 'buffalo', 'classmates', 'drew', 'were', 'blank', 'stares', 'comments', ""'re"", 'weird', 'Such', 'was', 'third', 'grade.Many', 'years', 'later', 'made', 'mistake', 'selling', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Fletch', 'bulk', 'auction', 'thirty-three', 'other', 'tapes', 'was', 'moving', 'made', 'sense', 'regretted', 'losing', 'only', 'copy', 'was', 'DVD', 'available', 'replace', 'So', 'now', 'movie', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'second', 'time', 'gap', 'few', 'years', 'Jane', 'Doe', 'Edition', 'so', 'named', 'Irwin', 'Fletcher', 'by-line', 'now', 'am', 'married', 'wife', 'seen', 'movie', 'am', 'aware', 'movie', 'shortcomings', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'downright', 'dumb', 'find', 'so', 'easy', 'identify', 'character', 'who', 'wits', 'get', 'trouble', 'can', 'easily', 'overlook', 'less-than-credible', 'plot', 'elements', 'use', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'doormat.Here', 'how', 'story', 'Fletch', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'pretending', 'be', 'junkie', 'blending', 'LA', 'beach', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'thing', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'source', 'drugs', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'headlines', 'newspaper', 'same', 'time', 'offered', '50,000', 'foolproof', 'escape', 'plan', 'kill', 'wealthy', 'man', 'named', 'Alan', 'Stanwyk', 'who', 'dying', 'bone', 'cancer.Much', 'story', 'around', 'Fletch', 'pretending', 'be', 'other', 'people', 'gently', 'information', 'gullible', 'confused', 'bystanders', 'typical', 'scene', 'Fletch', 'government', 'messenger', 'Mr.', 'Poon', 'who', 'collect', 'information', 'allegations', 'company', 'Stanwyk', 'married', 'CEO', 'Boyd', 'Aviation', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Alan', 'Stanwyk', 'father-in-law', 'out', 'kinds', 'information', 'get', 'bottom', 'unusual', 'proposition', 'credible', 'not', 'point', 'characters', 'Chase', 'up', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'way', 'subculture', 'using', 'few', 'props', 'quick', 'wit.The', 'Jane', 'Doe', 'Edition', 'have', 'few', 'extras', 'course', 'external', 'sleeve', 'various', 'Fletch', 'identities', 'depending', 'perspective', 'Special', 'Features', 'will', 'find', 'chuckleworthy', 'mockumentary', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'movie', 'also', 'brief', 'bit', 'make-up', 'artists', 'producers', 'talk', 'many', 'disguises', 'Fletch', 'uses', 'obligatory', 'trailer', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'clever', 'montage', 'piecing', 'together', 'funniest', 'moments', 'movie', 'grouped', 'loosely', 'category', 'foreign', 'phrases', 'noises', 'made', 'mouth', 'cetera', 'fun', 'long-time', 'fans', 'particular.One', 'only', 'misgivings', 'DVD', 'lack', 'new', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'material', 'are', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'nothing', 'more', 'recent', 'what', 'did', 'original', 'movie', 'career', 'not', 'exactly', 'red-hot', 'days', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'difficult', 'get', 'board', 'guess', 'asking', 'price', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'high', 'are', 'legions', 'twenty-', 'thirty-something', 'American', 'men', 'who', 'make', 'movie', 'part', 'own', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'religion', 'cult', 'following', 'should', 'keep', 'Jane', 'Doe', 'Edition', 'sales', 'strong', 'years', 'come']",N/A

Fletch's misadventures are totally suspenseful and so totally hilarious at the same time. While hanging out on a California beach to learn stories from drug informants, Fletch meets a mysterious man with a totally unusual request. The man asks Fletch to murder him. Yes, that's right. Must be a mad man, you might think, until he makes his story sound totally believable. The man says he is dying from bone cancer and has only terrible suffering to look forward to for the remainder of his totally doomed life. He would be ready to kill himself and end his suffering, he says, except suicide would prevent his family from collecting his life insurance. So that is why he propositions Fletch to do the job. Fletch says yes, but goes on to proceed with skepticism, which is totally called-for as it turns out. Fletch goes through a series of misadventures as he visits the man's doctor to try to see if his grim prognosis is verifiable. More misadventures ensue as Fletch goes on to crash the man's country club, posing under a fictitious name that he improvises as he goes. When a woman there finds his assumed name curious and inquires of its nationally, Fletch replies that it is ""Scotch-Romanian"", part of his totally typical manner of improvising. Funny interludes occur as Fletch deals in a totally creative way with his ex-wife's divorce lawyer. And there are more twists and turns to his adventures that have him impersonating police officers, among other things, in the process of unraveling the truth about the man who has put a hit on himself, not to mention other secrets that Fletch uncovers in the process. I saw this with my three best friends, and a totally good time was had by all. Karen found it exciting and funny, even though we totally had to explain some parts to her.

It was easily accessible for a kid, but I was originally disappointed when I first saw Fletch because it was more serious and a lot of jokes just went over my head.As a result Fletch appeals to the adult in me while Fletch Lives appeals to the kid barely concealed inside. There's loads of great one-liners from our man Chase and even if that doesn't float your boat Harold Faltermeyer's score is just plain awesome. It's unfortunate that ""Irwin F"" never became as famous or iconic as ""Axel F"".I've read the book, and it's as different as it is similar to the plot of the movie, except for one major difference; Fletch's cases are not connected in the book but they are in the movie. Gregory MacDonald had the final say on who they cast as Fletch and rejected Burt Reynolds (no way) and Mick Jagger (say what???) before approving Chase. Along with Clark W. Griswold he's his most famous character (Ty Webb coming in at 3rd place).It's not aged so well though, the film is clearly very 80s, unlike the sequel which doesn't use any pop songs, But even if the pop tunes anchor this in 1985 it's still one of the best comedies of that decade and no one can call themselves a film buff without owning/watching.The Blu Ray features a 1080p 1.85:1 picture but since much of the film has a rather drab color pallet only a few nicely-shot scenes look good.

60312,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0783227981,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 4]","You really take your life in your hands every time you sit down with a Chevy Chase film. Let's face reality here: Chevy Chase is responsible for several of the worst movies ever made. Does it take more than a few minutes to see the mind numbing folly of ""Nothing But Trouble,"" ""The Three Amigos,"" and ""Spies Like Us""? Chase has sure had his truly embarrassing moments on the big screen. What redeems the guy is this 1985 classic, the truly great ""Fletch."" With the possible exception of the ""Vacation"" films and ""Fletch,"" Chase rarely found a vehicle that played up to his deadpan, smart alecky comedic delivery. In the role of newspaper reporter Irwin Fletcher, Chase makes the character all his own as he knocks it out of the ballpark in this ultra funny, well-crafted film based on a plot involving drug trafficking, bigamy, and murder. If I had to draw up a list of the top five films I have watched the most, ""Fletch"" would appear somewhere on that list. I've probably watched this movie forty or fifty times since it originally came out, and I never tire of his corny impressions and awesome lines. ""Fletch"" is an unmitigated classic.Fletch writes articles for a big Los Angeles newspaper under the pseudonym Jane Doe, and he's always on the lookout for a good story. After going undercover on a local beach where he poses as a drug addict and mixes with other users and dealers, Fletch finds himself in the middle of a murder for hire deal when a rich executive named Alan Stanwyck (Tim Matheson) wants Fletch to do him in for a stack of money. Further problems with more questions than answers follow: who is Alan Stanwyck, and why are the police acting suspicious on the beach where all that heroin is floating around? Fletch's investigations into Stanwyck's past uncover a plethora of dirty deals: bigamy, drug dealing, and possible links between the police department and the crooked executive. As Fletch narrows down the scope of these scams, he continually dukes it out with his indifferent editor who never believes anything the reporter says. The investigation takes Fletch to Utah, on high-speed car chases through the city, into a jail cell with a gun pointed at his head, and into the arms of Stanwyck's beautiful wife. Fletch never doubts he will crack the case wide open and get the scoop of the year at the paper, but sometimes it looks as though he won't get out of this one alive. One of the best things the movie has going for it is this multi-layered mystery story, which is loaded with great twists and turns all the way to the end.If ""Fletch"" was merely a murder/mystery story, it wouldn't achieve immortality; it's the comedy that makes this one an enduring cult classic. Fletch has a habit of using outrageously cheap disguises in order to pump people for information, and along with these costumes he always throws out a fake name to go along with it. At various times during the course of the film, Fletch claims his name is Harry S. Truman, Don Corleone, John Cocktosten, Dr. Rosenrosen, Ted Nugent, Mr. Babar, and Mr. Poon (a name that Fletch reveals is of ""Comanche Indian"" lineage). He gets away with such outrageous behavior because he talks fast and most people don't listen to everything he says. Most of Chase's lines in this movie are hilariously inappropriate, and it quickly becomes apparent that there are very few comedians/actors who could toss out this type of dialogue and get laughs. Chase does it easily and believably. It takes several viewings just to pick up on everything he says.The supporting cast in ""Fletch"" is stellar, with Richard Libertini as Fletch's editor Frank, Geena Davis in a small role as a newspaper employee who worships the ground Fletch walks on named Larry, Joe Don Baker as the psychotic Police Chief Karlin, George Wendt as the seedy heroin dealer Fat Sam, George Wyner as the relentless attorney of Fletch's ex-wife, and M. Emmet Walsh as the ""handy"" Doctor Dolan. Everyone does a great job serving as cannon fodder for Fletch's sharp barbs. These barbs are some of the best you will hear in a motion picture: ""Can I borrow your towel? My car just hit a water buffalo,"" and ""Oh. Do you have the Beatles White Album? Never mind, just bring me a cup of hot fat. And the head of Alfredo Garcia,"" and ""I would have been here sooner, but a manure-spreader jackknifed on the Santa Ana. You should see my shoes."" Anyone else trying to pull this off would fail miserably, but again, Chase does a wonderful job with the jokes.The DVD release is wickedly lackluster. We don't get anything in the way of extras except a trailer and some production notes, but at least the movie does come in a widescreen format. I've heard that some of the discs don't have ANYTHING but the movie on them, but I haven't seen one of these flawed discs personally. Either way, why is there no commentary from Chevy Chase on here? Could you imagine how great it would be to hear him wax philosophically about the G. Gordon Liddy segment, or his encounters with Gail Stanwyck at the resort? We desperately need a special edition version of ""Fletch"" in the near future. Just writing this review makes me want to watch the movie again, and I know I'll laugh at it as hard as I did the forty other times I've seen it. ""Fletch"" is simply a massively entertaining treat.",5,The Film Chevy Chase Will Be Remembered For,1062720000,"09 5, 2003",2003,5309,"['really', 'take', 'life', 'hands', 'time', 'sit', 'down',

Fletch being the curious guy he is decides to investigate the millionaire's claim.  When he discovers that his dying millionaire is not dying, but is in fact hiding a secret life as well as a second wife, the ""chase"" is on!This is one of Chevy Chase's finest performances!

60324,A1V5G1O9TRGO7M,0783227981,matt,"[23, 25]","Fletch is my personal favorite comedy and without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made.  Chevy Chase is perfectly cast as Irwin Fletcher, a wise cracking newspaper reporter working undercover on a beach to expose a drug running operation.  At the same time, he is mistaken for a junkie by  shady millionare Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) who asks Fletch to murder him.  Fletch agrees but launches an investigation into finding out why this man wants to be killed.  This isn't lowbrow humor, it's quick witted and very fast.  Fletch requires a few viewings before one is able to grab all the jokes, but it's well worth it.  I've seen this movie about 30 times and each and every time I watch, it remains as funny as the first time I saw it.  If you've liked Chevy Chase in Caddyshack or National Lampoon's Vacation, than you'll love him here.  The dialogue is witty and extremely quotable.  Chase's Fletch often disguises himself as he investigates the two mysteries, his cheap disguises and alias' (Ted Nugent, Don Corleone, Dr. Rosenpenis) are hysterical, Chase is a master of deadpan wisecracks, this movie is a perfect showcase for his talent.Aside from the brilliance of Fletch as a comedy, Fletch functions perfectly as a well made mystery movie.  I disagree with one reviewer who praised the movie as a comedy but said it wasn't a very good movie.  Fletch is a very good movie and aside from Chevy Chase, there are many other reasons for the success of this classic.  Screenwriter Andrew Bergman has written one of the trickiest scripts in Hollywood history, it manages to be flat out hilarious, and captivating in the same light.  Whenever I watch this film with a new viewer, they are always surprised as to how much the storyline grabbed them.  Another plus with this movie is Harold Faltermeyer's superb synthesizer score. It's similar to his earlier Beverly Hills Cop score, maybe even better, it helps set the tone of this movie perfectly.  Last but not least, we have the direction, all under the sure hand of Michael Ritchie.  He keeps things moving and maintains a comedic tone which occasionally borders on seriousness to help the story progress. Balancing tones isn't easy, in this film it's done so well, it's hardly even noticable.Fletch is all around, an excellent film, but before everything else, it's a VERY funny film.  A true cult classic.  For audiences whom have seen Beverly Hills Cop, think along those lines, I always thought it would be amusing to see what would happen if Chase's Fletch met with Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley of the Cop films.  If you've seen those than you have a good idea of what to expect with Fletch, a film loaded with belly laughs as long as you're willing to pick up on them.",5,&quot;I'm afraid I'm goona have to pull rank on you here...&quot;,971827200,"10 18, 2000",2000,2734,"['Fletch', 'personal', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'doubt', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Irwin', 'Fletcher', 'wise', 'cracking', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'working', 'undercover', 'beach', 'expose', 'drug', 'running', 'operation', 'same', 'time', 'mistaken', 'junkie', 'shady', 'millionare', 'Alan', 'Stanwyk', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'who', 'Fletch', 'murder', 'Fletch', 'investigation', 'finding', 'out', 'why', 'man', 'be', 'killed', ""n't"", 'lowbrow', 'humor', 'quick', 'witted', 'very', 'fast', 'Fletch', 'few', 'viewings', 'one', 'able', 'grab', 'jokes', 'well', 'worth', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', '30', 'times', 'time', 'watch', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'saw', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Caddyshack', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', ""'ll"", 'love', 'here', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'extremely', 'quotable', 'Chase', 'Fletch', 'often', 'two', 'mysteries', 'cheap', 'disguises', 'alias', 'Ted', 'Nugent', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'Dr.', 'Rosenpenis', 'are', 'hysterical', 'Chase', 'master', 'deadpan', 'wisecracks', 'movie', 'perfect', 'showcase', 'talent.Aside', 'brilliance', 'Fletch', 'comedy', 'Fletch', 'perfectly', 'well', 'made', 'mystery', 'movie', 'disagree', 'one', 'reviewer', 'who', 'praised', 'movie', 'comedy', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Fletch', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'aside', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'reasons', 'success', 'classic', 'Screenwriter', 'Andrew', 'Bergman', 'written', 'one', 'trickiest', 'scripts', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'be', 'flat', 'hilarious', 'captivating', 'same', 'light', 'Whenever', 'watch', 'film', 'new', 'viewer', 'are', 'always', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'storyline', 'grabbed', 'plus', 'movie', 'Harold', 'Faltermeyer', 'superb', 'synthesizer', 'score', 'similar', 'earlier', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'score', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'set', 'tone', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'have', 'direction', 'sure', 'hand', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'things', 'moving', 'comedic', 'tone', 'occasionally', 'borders', 'seriousness', 'help', 'story', 'progress', 'Balancing', 'tones', ""n't"", 'easy', 'film', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'hardly', 'even', 'noticable.Fletch', 'around', 'excellent', 'film', 'everything', 'else', 'VERY', 'funny', 'film', 'true', 'cult', 'classic', 'audiences', 'whom', 'have', 'seen', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'think', 'lines', 'always', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'amusing', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Chase', 'Fletch', 'met', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Axel', 'Foley', 'Cop', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Fletch', 'film', 'loaded', 'belly', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'willing', 'pick', 'up']",N/A

I saw this movie in the theater in 1985 (as a teenager) and have seen it over 100(!) times since then (no exaggeration!).  Needless to say, I know it so well, I don't have to watch it anymore.  It's become part of my consciousness.  Of all the movies with lotsa one liners, THIS IS #1--As another reviewer remarked, no matter how far apart my brother and I drift from one another, and it's become quite far these days, we always have 'Fletch'.  It's practically its own language, and for those of us who 'know it', you can converse with someone else in 'Fletch' without anyone else having a clue about what you're talking about.  My mom is always lost whenever my brother and I 'get into it'...  What's funny is that she laughs at some of it even though she has no clue what the hell we're talking about.  For those who haven't seen it or don't like it, this is the role Chevy Chase was born to play.  Nothing before (no, Caddyshack has its moments, but nothing like this) or after 'Fletch' even comes close (no, not even SNL).  This is the BIBLE for Chevy Chase.

Gregory McDonald's lightweight mystery novel about an undercover newspaper reporter cracking a police drug ring is transformed by screenwriter Andrew Bergman (Blazing Saddles, and writer/director of The Freshman and Honeymoon in Vegas) into a fairly sarcastic and occasionally very funny Chevy Chase vehicle. Enjoyment of the film pivots on whether you find Chase's flippant, smart-ass brand of verbal humor funny, or merely egocentric. If you don't like Chase, there's really no one else worth watching (Geena Davis is sadly underused). Chase seems born to play I.M. ""Fletch"" Fletcher, a disillusioned investigative reporter whose cynicism and detached view on life mirrors the actor's understated approach to comedy. Fletcher offers Chase the opportunity to adopt numerous personas, and is aloud to fire off hilarious 1 liners that'll have you laughing for days. Fletch becomes involved in the film's smart and self-mocking two-part mystery. As well as trying to gather drug smuggling evidence against the LAPD for a long-overdue newspaper story, a rich and apparently terminally ill stranger also offers Fletch a large payoff to kill him. While the film does a GREAT job juggling both of these plots, it also manages to toss in a love interest as well.

Law&quot; seduced thousands of college students into law school with the promise of riches, the novel &quot;Fletch&quot; seduced me into journalism school with the promise of adventure and mystery.  Sadly, I discovered that much of journalism is nothing like the  novel.That said, Gregory McDonald's &quot;Fletch&quot; remains one of my  all time favorite books.  When the novel was adapted into a movie, I was  skeptical.  The novel succeeds because Fletch is much smarter than everyone  else, and it moves along based on sharp witty dialogue.  How was Chevy  Chase going to play Fletch?  (Quite frankly, I had always envisioned Fletch  as someone like Dirk Benedict -- aka &quot;Faceman&quot; on &quot;The  A-Team,&quot; or perhaps you remember him as &quot;Starbuck&quot; on  &quot;Battlestar Galactica.&quot;)The producers of this movie wisely  recognized that they couldn't adapt Chevy Chase into the novel's Fletch, so  instead, they took what they could from the novel and adapted it to Chase's  strengths.  The result is wildly successful.  Chase's deadpan delivery and  physical klutziness makes the movie fun and funny, while the novel's  detailed plot keeps the viewer guessing.  This is one of the few times  where I've liked both the book and the movie equally.Now, on to the  technical aspects of the DVD.  The picture quality is fine, as with DVDs,  but the sound, particularly the end credit music sequence, is a bit flat  and monostereo at times.  Since I noticed this same problem with the  laserdisc version, I don't think it's a DVD defect, but rather a problem  with the original source, which is too bad.In summary, I highly  recommend this movie; when you're done, you might search for a copy of the  novel for a much different presentation of the plot.",5,Great adaption of a novel that I thought couldn't be adapted,957657600,"05 7, 2000",2000,1795,"['Much', 'quot', 'L.A.', 'Law', 'quot', 'seduced', 'thousands', 'college', 'students', 'law', 'school', 'promise', 'riches', 'novel', 'quot', 'Fletch', 'quot', 'seduced', 'journalism', 'school', 'promise', 'adventure', 'mystery', 'Sadly', 'discovered', 'much', 'journalism', 'nothing', 'said', 'Gregory', 'McDonald', 'quot', 'Fletch', 'quot', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'books', 'When', 'novel', 'was', 'adapted', 'movie', 'was', 'skeptical', 'novel', 'Fletch', 'much', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'else', 'along', 'based', 'sharp', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'How', 'was', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'going', 'play', 'Fletch', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'had', 'always', 'envisioned', 'Fletch', 'someone', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'aka', 'quot', 'Faceman', 'quot', 'quot', 'A-Team', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'remember', 'quot', 'Starbuck', 'quot', 'quot', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica.', 'quot', 'producers', 'movie', 'wisely', 'recognized', 'could', ""n't"", 'adapt', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'novel', 'Fletch', 'so', 'instead', 'took', 'what', 'could', 'novel', 'adapted', 'Chase', 'strengths', 'result', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Chase', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'physical', 'klutziness', 'movie', 'fun', 'funny', 'novel', 'detailed', 'plot', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'where', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'book', 'movie', 'equally.Now', 'technical', 'aspects', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'fine', 'DVDs', 'sound', 'particularly', 'end', 'credit', 'music', 'sequence', 'bit', 'flat', 'monostereo', 'times', 'noticed', 'same', 'problem', 'laserdisc', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'DVD', 'defect', 'rather', 'problem', 'original', 'source', 'too', 'bad.In', 'summary', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'might', 'search', 'copy', 'novel', 'much', 'different', 'presentation', 'plot']",N/A
