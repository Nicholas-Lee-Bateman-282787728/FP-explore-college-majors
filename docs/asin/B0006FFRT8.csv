They're nostalgic and often moving, especially the moment during ""Fool On The Hill"" when Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I Have A Dream"" speech is played during the instrumental break, nearly driving my tears whenver I watch it or listen to it on cd.If there's any complaints I have about this dvd, is that there are some great songs perfromed on this tour that could've been included, such as ""Jet"", ""Ebony & Ivory"", ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", ""Things We Said Today"" and ""My Brace Face"", all of which brought down the house as much as any of the numbers on this tape. No worries though, as all of these tracks are available on Paul's magnificent two disc live album from this tour, ""Tripping The Live Fantastic"".Overall, ""Get Back"" is an excellent representation of McCartney, and is one of the finest concert movies ever made.",5,One Of The Finest Concert Movies Ever Made.,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,2070,"['Pretty', 'much', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'concert', 'sicne', 'triumphant', 'return', 'stage', '1989', 'have', 'had', 'concert', 'movie', 'tv', 'special', 'made', 'conjunction', '1993', 'Paul', 'Live', '2002', 'Back', 'U.S.', '2005', 'Live', 'Red', 'Square', '2006', 'Space', 'Within', 'Us', 'are', 'excellent', 'energetic', 'undeniable', 'proof', 'Paul', 'amazing', 'showmanship', 'none', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'passion', 'vigor', 'energy', 'present', '1991', 'Get', 'Back', 'culled', 'Paul', '1989-1990', 'return', 'stage', '22', 'songs', 'performed', 'are', 'here', 'solid', 'mix', 'Beatles', 'classics', 'Got', 'Get', 'Into', 'My', 'Life', 'Long', 'Winding', 'Road', 'Let', 'Be', 'Hey', 'Jude', 'solo', 'hits', 'only', 'full', 'uninterrupted', 'start', 'finish', 'live', 'performance', 'Band', 'Run', 'Live', 'Let', 'Die', 'then', 'new', 'recordings', '1989', 'album', 'Flowers', 'Dirt', 'Rough', 'Ride', 'Put', 'One', '.With', 'youthful', 'vigor', 'as', 'well', 'eternally', 'boyish', 'charm', 'good', 'looks', 'Paul', 'oldise', 'sound', 'new', 'again', 'also', 'then', 'newer', 'tracks', 'hold', 'own', 'solid', 'ground', 'classics', 'everyone', 'knows.A', 'lot', 'people', 'complain', 'various', 'news', 'images', 'whatnot', 'being', 'present', 'many', 'songs', 'love', ""'re"", 'nostalgic', 'often', 'moving', 'especially', 'moment', 'Fool', 'Hill', 'when', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'Have', 'Dream', 'speech', 'played', 'instrumental', 'break', 'nearly', 'driving', 'tears', 'whenver', 'watch', 'listen', 'cd.If', 'complaints', 'have', 'dvd', 'are', 'great', 'songs', 'perfromed', 'tour', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'included', 'such', 'Jet', 'Ebony', 'Ivory', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'Amazed', 'Said', 'Today', 'Brace', 'Face', 'brought', 'down', 'house', 'as', 'much', 'numbers', 'tape', 'worries', 'though', 'tracks', 'are', 'available', 'Paul', 'magnificent', 'two', 'disc', 'live', 'album', 'tour', 'Tripping', 'Live', 'Fantastic', '.Overall', 'Get', 'Back', 'excellent', 'representation', 'McCartney', 'one', 'finest', 'concert', 'movies', 'ever', 'made']",N/A
865655,A1LACLRU1P4GTE,B0006FFRT8,Bill,"[2, 2]","Get Back is the filmed record of Paul's '89/'90 comeback tour and began a tradition of annoying concert films that continues through to today. This one was directed by Richard Lester, who made his name directing the Beatles' first two films and his eccentric style comes out in the concert film. We all know that these films are cut together from dozens of different shows, but unlike most others, Lester makes no attempt to disguise the fact. While it's a refreshingly honest approach, it can be irritating if not downright creepy to see Paul and band change clothes in the middle of a song. And while it's perfectly legitimate to illustrate The Long and Winding Road with news footage of the Beatles and the space race juxtaposed with vision of the Vietnam war, showing it all at full screen for the entire song is not what we paid to see.The concert itself is magnificent with heaps of Beatles songs that until then had never been performed live. But as with all the concert films that came after it, the film does not do justice to the show. Being shot on film makes it look more dated than it really is, and the cutaways to the audience become so constant that you sometimes feel like you're watching an audience film occasionally interrupted by a concert. The fact that the same mistake of overusing audience shots has been made by three very different directors over 15 years can only suggest that the order came from higher up the chain. Paul, we know you're famous, that's why we want to see YOU!Get Back, like just about everything that came after it until Good Evening New York City, merely teases us with a taste of what might have been.Highlight: The first live version of Hey Jude, closely followed by the Abbey Road medleyExtras: NoneAudio: Dolby Stereo",3,"Great concert, not so great film",1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,1768,"['Get', 'Back', 'filmed', 'record', 'Paul', ""'89/'90"", 'comeback', 'tour', 'began', 'tradition', 'annoying', 'concert', 'films', 'today', 'one', 'was', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'who', 'made', 'name', 'directing', 'Beatles', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'eccentric', 'style', 'out', 'concert', 'film', 'know', 'films', 'are', 'cut', 'together', 'dozens', 'different', 'shows', 'most', 'others', 'Lester', 'attempt', 'disguise', 'fact', 'refreshingly', 'honest', 'approach', 'can', 'be', 'irritating', 'not', 'downright', 'creepy', 'see', 'Paul', 'band', 'change', 'clothes', 'middle', 'song', 'perfectly', 'legitimate', 'illustrate', 'Long', 'Winding', 'Road', 'news', 'footage', 'Beatles', 'space', 'race', 'juxtaposed', 'vision', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'showing', 'full', 'screen', 'entire', 'song', 'not', 'what', 'paid', 'see.The', 'concert', 'magnificent', 'heaps', 'Beatles', 'songs', 'then', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'performed', 'live', 'concert', 'films', 'came', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'show', 'Being', 'shot', 'film', 'look', 'more', 'dated', 'really', 'cutaways', 'audience', 'become', 'so', 'constant', 'sometimes', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'audience', 'film', 'occasionally', 'interrupted', 'concert', 'fact', 'same', 'mistake', 'overusing', 'audience', 'shots', 'been', 'made', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'directors', '15', 'years', 'can', 'only', 'suggest', 'order', 'came', 'higher', 'chain', 'Paul', 'know', ""'re"", 'famous', 'why', 'want', 'see', 'YOU', 'Get', 'Back', 'just', 'everything', 'came', 'Good', 'Evening', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'merely', 'taste', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been.Highlight', 'first', 'live', 'version', 'Hey', 'Jude', 'closely', 'followed', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'medleyExtras', 'NoneAudio', 'Dolby', 'Stereo']",N/A

Footage is off several stops along the way on his big World Tour around 1990.Paul and his group perform many of the old Beatles songs, along with his solo efforts after the famous band had broken up. The lighting in here was outstanding. I couldn't help wondering how much Paul paid just to put on these concerts. He even added fireworks to one of the numbers!Like all good performers, McCartney has an excellent band backing him up, particularly a guitarist whose name I don't know but the guy looked like actor James Caan. Paul's wife Linda also was in the band. I didn't see her do much but it's sad to see her now knowing she died at such a young age.For me, the finale was the best on the tape with the title song ""Get Back,"" along with songs off the ""Abbey Road,"" album, all of which were some of my favorite Beatles tunes.Earlier in the concert, you see old film clips of the Beatles accompanying some of the songs, and that was nice to see. As with most concert tapes of any length, you'll get a few numbers you can skip but whatever your tastes, you'll get more than enough good rock 'n roll here.",4,Plenty Of Good Songs To Choose From,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,1210,"['***vhs', 'review***This', 'very', 'good', 'rock', 'video', 'solid', 'presentations', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'band', 'Footage', 'several', 'stops', 'way', 'big', 'World', 'Tour', '1990.Paul', 'group', 'perform', 'many', 'old', 'Beatles', 'songs', 'solo', 'efforts', 'famous', 'band', 'had', 'broken', 'up', 'lighting', 'here', 'was', 'outstanding', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'Paul', 'paid', 'just', 'put', 'concerts', 'even', 'added', 'fireworks', 'one', 'numbers', 'good', 'performers', 'McCartney', 'excellent', 'band', 'backing', 'up', 'particularly', 'guitarist', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guy', 'looked', 'actor', 'James', 'Caan', 'Paul', 'wife', 'Linda', 'also', 'was', 'band', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'do', 'much', 'sad', 'see', 'now', 'knowing', 'died', 'young', 'age.For', 'finale', 'was', 'best', 'tape', 'title', 'song', 'Get', 'Back', 'songs', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'album', 'were', 'favorite', 'Beatles', 'tunes.Earlier', 'concert', 'see', 'old', 'film', 'clips', 'Beatles', 'accompanying', 'songs', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'most', 'concert', 'tapes', 'length', ""'ll"", 'get', 'few', 'numbers', 'can', 'skip', 'tastes', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'enough', 'good', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'here']",N/A

Despite what anyone says about Sir Paul's post-Beatles music, when it comes to live performance, the man always gives 100 percent. He's as hard-working a showman as anyone in rock and always holds his own against virtually every live band. The guy cares about what he does, has a great voice, is a solid innovative bassist and one heck of a pianist. I am certain that almost everyone who attended the 1989 live shows filmed for this DVD ranks it as a night they will never forget.I wish this DVD were longer, because it focuses almost exclusively on Paul's Beatles hits. I know that many people love hearing McCartney sing the Beatles Greatest Hits, but I'd like to hear more of his solo and Wings material. (In concert at the time, McCartney did include a lot of post-1970 material, but little of it is here save for the beautiful 'Put it There,' 'Live and Let Die,' and 'Coming Up.')My major problem with the DVD comes from Richard Lester's decision to intercut newsfootage throughout many of the songs. 'The Long and Winding Road' is all but ruined by Vietnam imagery, for example, and by the time I reached the end of the DVD I was uncomfortably reminded of the movie version of 'Beatlemania' which used similar tricks. McCartney is the real deal and doesn't need such trickery. And, yes, that's the same Richard Lester who used to direct great popcorn flicks like 'Superman II' and 'The Three Musketeers' not to mention the Beatles own 'Hard Day's Night.' I've no idea why McCartney allowed Lester to ruin sections of this film with his heavy-handed social commentary.I'm still giving this 4 stars if only because we get the joy of Paul McCartney rediscovering himself in front of a worldwide audience.",4,Good concert overall,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,1772,"['ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'live', 'recordings', 'what', 'anyone', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'post-Beatles', 'music', 'when', 'live', 'performance', 'man', 'always', '100', 'percent', 'hard-working', 'showman', 'anyone', 'rock', 'always', 'own', 'virtually', 'live', 'band', 'guy', 'what', 'great', 'voice', 'solid', 'innovative', 'bassist', 'one', 'heck', 'pianist', 'am', 'certain', 'almost', 'everyone', 'who', 'attended', '1989', 'live', 'shows', 'filmed', 'DVD', 'night', 'will', 'never', 'forget.I', 'wish', 'DVD', 'were', 'longer', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Paul', 'Beatles', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'love', 'hearing', 'McCartney', 'sing', 'Beatles', 'Greatest', 'Hits', ""'d"", 'like', 'hear', 'more', 'solo', 'Wings', 'material', 'concert', 'time', 'McCartney', 'did', 'include', 'lot', 'post-1970', 'material', 'little', 'here', 'save', 'beautiful', ""'Live"", 'Let', 'Die', ""'Coming"", 'Up', 'major', 'problem', 'DVD', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'decision', 'intercut', 'newsfootage', 'many', 'songs', 'Long', 'Winding', 'Road', 'ruined', 'Vietnam', 'imagery', 'example', 'time', 'reached', 'end', 'DVD', 'was', 'uncomfortably', 'reminded', 'movie', 'version', ""'Beatlemania"", 'used', 'similar', 'tricks', 'McCartney', 'real', 'deal', ""n't"", 'need', 'such', 'trickery', 'yes', 'same', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'who', 'used', 'direct', 'great', 'popcorn', 'flicks', ""'Superman"", 'II', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'not', 'mention', 'Beatles', 'own', ""'Hard"", 'Day', 'Night', ""'ve"", 'idea', 'why', 'McCartney', 'allowed', 'Lester', 'ruin', 'sections', 'film', 'heavy-handed', 'social', 'commentary.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'only', 'get', 'joy', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'rediscovering', 'front', 'worldwide', 'audience']",N/A

But the performance out-weighs that fault. This concert is like a dream Paul McCartney concert. I mean, Back in the US and Red Square was good, but the musicians weren't as talented as his old band.
