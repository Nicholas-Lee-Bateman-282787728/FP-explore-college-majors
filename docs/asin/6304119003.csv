Disguised as a gunman he can'tbe killed until the Sheriff discovers his secret.Why this isn't on dvd I can't figure out. I havehad the dvd for years and watch often.

(There actually had been a few films in the Thirties which fit into this category, but they were forgotten by virtually everyone until being released on home video.)  Michael Pate (a sort of sinister James Coburn) is effective in the role of a vampire menacing folks on a ranch.

I was shocked that it is not available in and has never been released in a DVD version. This is a Spanish vampire, not the Eastern European variety most people are acquainted with. This vampire became one because he committed suicide, not because he was killed by one as in the Dracula series. In the Catholic faith, suicide is the ultimate sin and so he becomes one of the undead. There are many other peculiarities of this vampire-he can move around in daylight, for example. Dracula, on the other hand, is destroyed by sunlight. Eric Fleming, in a role he took shortly before the beginning of the western series, ""Rawhide,"" is excellent as a preacher. Michael Pate, that excellent Australian actor familiar to many baby boomers as a villain or Native American, is suitably menacing as the vampire. Universal!!!
