The premise fits a short-term show. It certainly deserves more time than a four-hour special movie event that would completely rip any depth from the idea.FlashForward is loosely based on the 1999 novel of the same name by Canadian SF/F author Robert J. Sawyer.For two minutes and seventeen seconds, the world falls into a mental blackout. In that time, people have visions of six months into the future - April 29, 2010. Those who don't have visions are called ""ghosts"" because many believe they will be dead.One FBI agent (Joseph Fiennes) uses his vision to find the perpetrators.FlashForward borrows heavily from the highly-successful LOST formula. There are a quick succession of scenes, details that lead to more questions than answers, and sequences out of chronological order. There is also a kangaroo that keeps showing up - like the LOST polar bear (or the monster) and two LOST alums -  Dominic Monaghan (Charlie) and Sonya Walger (Penny) - as part of the cast.Luckily, the show isn't a cookie cutter version of LOST, otherwise it would be a waste of time and obvious ratings grab by ABC. Still, as I realized just how much it borrowed from LOST, I wondered if ABC hoped to have a long-term replacement for the show, which had overstayed its welcome by the time the end came this year.FlashForward is a finite series that will be an incredible watch for fans if ABC doesn't stretch it out into infinity.The first 10 episodes of the show are available for free on the ABC Web site, or on a two-disc DVD set, which includes a few intriguing extras about how they created chaos after the global blackout. There is also a short flash into the future of the second half of season one - one that makes me want to watch, even though I am adamantly opposed to splitting up seasons for profit.",4,Good show.

1318247,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0031ZWZR2,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 4]","This series seems identical to Robert Sawyer's novel of the same name. As in the novel, most of the planet loses consciousness. While ""out"", they see what will happen to them in six months. There is, of course, a law and order aspect to the show with chiefly Joseph Fiennes and John Cho playing two FBI agents and their attempts to solve the mystery behind the flashforward. This was absent from the Sawyer work and is the least interesting aspect of the show. The most interesting aspect of the show is the individual stories of the people who experienced it and their lives unfolding after the experience. Number One story is a young surgeon who has advanced cancer yet sees himself in the flashforward falling for a young Japanese woman in a Japanese restaurant. Another story is of the scientist who comes forward to claim responsibility for the flashforward even while his autistic son is in the hospital. There he meets the married woman he saw himself being with six months from now, his son's doctor. Then there are the people who saw themselves nowhere doing nothing--presumably they are dead six months from now. These stories are very compelling, just like the novel was. I wish the whole law enforcement aspect of this could be jettisoned as it is such a cliche. I can see why Sawyer left it out of the novel. It was something that happened to the whole planet in the novel which had no law enforcement overtones. NO ONE could explain it in any way. If you want a real treat, READ Robert Sawyer's novel FLASHFORWARD. Note: I am still watching this show, after the episodes in this DVD and I am sad to report that the FBI aspect of the show has just about totally taken it over.  I am probably going to stop watching this show.",3,Law Enforcement Aspect Defeats Wonder of Sawyer's Novel,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1738,"['series', 'identical', 'Robert', 'Sawyer', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'novel', 'most', 'planet', 'consciousness', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'six', 'months', 'course', 'law', 'order', 'aspect', 'show', 'chiefly', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'John', 'Cho', 'playing', 'two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'attempts', 'solve', 'mystery', 'flashforward', 'was', 'absent', 'Sawyer', 'work', 'least', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'show', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'show', 'individual', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'experienced', 'lives', 'unfolding', 'experience', 'Number', 'One', 'story', 'young', 'surgeon', 'who', 'advanced', 'cancer', 'yet', 'flashforward', 'falling', 'young', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'Japanese', 'restaurant', 'story', 'scientist', 'who', 'forward', 'claim', 'responsibility', 'flashforward', 'even', 'autistic', 'son', 'hospital', 'married', 'woman', 'saw', 'being', 'six', 'months', 'now', 'son', 'doctor', 'Then', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'nowhere', 'doing', 'nothing', 'presumably', 'are', 'dead', 'six', 'months', 'now', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'compelling', 'just', 'novel', 'was', 'wish', 'whole', 'law', 'enforcement', 'aspect', 'could', 'be', 'jettisoned', 'such', 'cliche', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Sawyer', 'left', 'novel', 'was', 'something', 'happened', 'whole', 'planet', 'novel', 'had', 'law', 'enforcement', 'overtones', 'ONE', 'could', 'explain', 'way', 'want', 'real', 'treat', 'READ', 'Robert', 'Sawyer', 'novel', 'FLASHFORWARD', 'Note', 'am', 'still', 'watching', 'show', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'am', 'sad', 'report', 'FBI', 'aspect', 'show', 'just', 'about', 'totally', 'taken', 'am', 'probably', 'going', 'stop', 'watching', 'show']",N/A

1318250,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0031ZWZR2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","In 2009, as the popular drama series ""LOST"" was on hiatus until Feb. 2010 on ABC, many people were wondering what series ABC would have for viewers in the meantime. Fortunately, the network had a new sci-fi drama series titled ""FlashForward"" based on the 1999 novel by Canada sci-fi writer Robert J. Sawyer set for debut in Sept. 2009 and a total of ten episodes aired through December and set for a return in March 18th after the 2010 Winter Olympics.So, in order to get people prepared for the second half of the series, ABC is releasing ""Flash Forward - Part One, Season One"" on DVD featuring the first ten episodes and will be releasing the complete series on Blu-ray and DVD later in August. Fortunately, abc studios is including a $15 coupon with this DVD release, if people plan to upgrade to the complete series.The series revolves around a few main characters and what happens to them when every human in the planet loses consciousness for 2 minutes and 17 seconds. During that time, each person was given a glimpse of their future six months later. The FBI are trying to find out the source of why this happened, while everyone is trying to deal with what they learned of their visions of the future (good and bad).VIDEO:""FlashForward"" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 television. Picture quality is good and the fact that the series is filmed in a variety of locations gives you an idea that how beautiful and vibrant this series would look in HD on Blu-ray. So, for those who want enjoy the series and prefer it on Blu-ray, the complete series will be available on Blu-ray in August. For those who want the series on DVD should be happy that the picture quality is very good. There is little compression artifacting, especially since there are five episodes on each DVD disc.AUDIO:As for audio, ""FlashForward"" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series has quite a bit of action in the ten episodes from cars crashing, gun shots, glass breaking, tables being flipped over. As mentioned, ""FlashForward"" would probably sound much better via lossless on Blu-ray if you are an audiophile. As for the DVD, the series sounds good via Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven. I preferred to watch the series with stereo on all channels set on my receiver for a more immersive soundscape.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""FlashForward - The Complete Series"" comes with the following special features:DISC 5:* Architects of Destiny - (20:06) The cast and crew talk about their experience on working on the first day of ""FlashForward"" and talk about how they were cast for their role.* Flashforward on Set - Featuring five featurettes of ""FlashForward"" on set: Tempting Fate (5:19) - Featuring the scenes at the Blue Hand Club, When Nature Calls (2:13) - Featuring a reshoot of two scenes from the pilot and the building of a bathroom set, Emergency Operation (3:02) - Filming the scenes from the hospital during the FlashForward, A Day in the Park - The making of the bus crash scene (3:33) and Crash Forward (4:22) - Filming a car chase.* Meet Yuko - (5:49) An introduction to popular Japanese actress Yuko Takeuchi and her first day on the set and meeting with the cast and executive producers.* Interviews from the Mosaic Collective - The following features interviews with people about their FlashForward experiences.

I felt that ""Lost in Mars"" from 2008-2009 had so much potential but ABC ended the series after its first season and here we are with ""FlashForward"", a sci-fi drama series which features a few talent from ""LOST"" with a pretty cool concept and a lot of potential.I am enjoying the series thus far and have enjoyed the first ten episodes a lot. I like where the series is going but the big question is if this is the type of series that can continue for multiple years. One of the things that ""LOST"" has been successful is that with each hint given, there is more mystery also added in each episode. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't but nevertheless, it was enough to keep the series going for six years straight. With ""FlashForward"", the main premise is the investigations to why these FlashForwards are happening and people having to deal with their own visions from the future, good and bad.When the first DVD featuring the first 10 episodes was released, I wrote in my original review:So, far the series has done a good job by drawing the viewer in and I can imagine, if the series during its return followed ""Lost"" during the 10:00 p.m. Tuesday time slot, the series will do quite well. It's a very cool series with a good amount of sci-fi, action, mystery and also a series with a lot of potential. I really hope this series lasts more than a single season because it's very good!Unfortunately, ""FlashForward"" received news that it was being canceled and for those of us who did get into this series, knew that this series was planned for a five season run, not one.  To make things worst, the last episode was created as a cliffhanger for a second season which would never come and thus, we are left with this major build-up to a series that ends with a cliffhanger and no resolution. I wish ABC would have given the series a better timeslot and for the most part, a chance.I really hate when this happens.  And many were hoping that the series would go to a new network but with other cast members now on other shows and writer and director David Goyer working on the third ""Batman"" film, it looks like we're not going to get any closure with this series.  But fans are now hoping for the series to be picked up at a new network and many are hoping social media can help find this series a new home.Let me say that I enjoyed this series.  I will have to admit that perhaps there were too many characters that the series tried to focus on that some FlashForward storylines for supporting characters felt out of the blue at times but for the most part, I really enjoyed where this show was heading especially if the writers were able to get a second chance.The acting was well done and a big kudos to Joseph Fiennes and John Cho who did an awesome job in the series.  Also, it was great to see a really cool cast of former LOSTies such as Dominic Monaghan and Sony Walger and even a few ""Battlestar Galactic"" talents show up on the series as well.  This was a series that had a lot of characters and in many ways, it was very demanding that you had to watch each episode without missing one.  But for those who were loyal followers to the series, this first and final season was enjoyable.  In fact, I watch this series throughout my whole weekend, nearly non-stop because I enjoyed it so much.  I found the series to be compelling, entertaining and once again, a series with so much potential.  So, it's a little bittersweet to know that you enjoy a series so much and there is no closure.  I wished ABC would at least have given the series a chance for the writers to tie things up.  It's really unfortunate.As for the DVD release, fans of the series will like the fact that the series comes loaded with special features and easter eggs (not that hard to find).  Some with scenes that appeared in the last DVD but for the most part, plenty of new special features that will make fans happy with DVD box set.Also, if you purchased ""FlashForward, Season One, Part One"", you get the $15 coupon which can be applied to this set and also a manufacturer's coupon for $10 off additional if you purchase any other ABC related boxset that has been released in August-September.Overall, ""FlashForward"" has turned out to be quite a riveting series and definitely a series worth watching!  Many wonder if I can recommend a series box set knowing that at this time, there are no plans for  a second season, if you are a fan of the series, then yes.  But with the way the series ending on a cliffhanger with an expectancy that a second season would be coming and looks like it won't be happening ever,  it makes it even harder for me to recommend because this is actually an awesome DVD box set.But if I had to review this DVD based on its overall package and its first season alone, then I will have to say that it's definitely recommended and you get the bells and whistles that comes with this DVD box set.  So, for fans of the series, this DVD box set is recommended.  For those who are curious about the series, it's a great series that had a lot of potential, but a potential that will never be realized due to its cancellation and that is unfortunate.NOTE: There are reports that Starz is interested in giving ""FlashForward"" a second season.  Let's hope so!",5,"DVD: A series that deserved more and overall, a well-round DVD full of special features (esp. easter eggs)",1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,12364,"['2009', 'popular', 'drama',

1318253,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B0031ZWZR2,Gary P. Cohen,"[7, 18]","I looked forward to this show with some enthusiasm.  I enjoy ""Lost"" and this show was being billed as more of the same.  And I will admit that the first episode was fairly interesting.  However as the weeks went by, this show became less interesting.  I finally started DVRing it.  When I found it was time to watch the taped episodes, I could find no desire or enthusiasm to do so.  So I deleted them and gave up on this show.The main problem is that I just cannot stand the lead actor, Joseph Fiennes, or the annoying character he plays, an alcoholic FBI agent.  I did enjoy the actress who plays his wife, Sonya Walger, as ""Penny"" on ""Lost.""  Here she is almost as boring as the actor who plays her husband. (The series delights in showing her ""FlashForward"" where she is in bed with another man, they show it over and over.  Very sad and creates very little sympathy for her character.)  They did add another ""Lost"" actor, Dominic Monahan, in a villainous role.  However by that time I no longer cared.Before you get too attached to this series, you should be aware that the ratings dropped week by week, causing ABC to pull it.  It will be returning next month, I believe.  I sincerely hope that they finish the ""FlashForward"" storyline since there is a good chance ABC will not be renewing it for next season.  Nothing worse than wasting a lot of time on a series that ends with nothing being resolved.  So you should be aware of this before you get started on this series.And finally, if you do decide to purchase this set and get started watching this slow and unexciting series, just be sure to drink a lot of coffee beforehand so you will be able to stay awake.",2,Dreadfully Boring,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,1671,"['looked', 'forward', 'show', 'enthusiasm', 'enjoy', 'Lost', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'billed', 'more', 'same', 'will', 'admit', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'However', 'weeks', 'went', 'show', 'became', 'less', 'interesting', 'finally', 'started', 'DVRing', 'When', 'found', 'was', 'time', 'watch', 'taped', 'episodes', 'could', 'find', 'desire', 'enthusiasm', 'do', 'so', 'deleted', 'gave', 'up', 'show.The', 'main', 'problem', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'lead', 'actor', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'annoying', 'character', 'alcoholic', 'FBI', 'agent', 'did', 'enjoy', 'actress', 'who', 'wife', 'Sonya', 'Walger', 'Penny', 'Lost', 'Here', 'almost', 'as', 'boring', 'actor', 'who', 'husband', 'series', 'delights', 'showing', 'FlashForward', 'where', 'bed', 'man', 'show', 'Very', 'sad', 'very', 'little', 'sympathy', 'character', 'did', 'add', 'Lost', 'actor', 'Dominic', 'Monahan', 'villainous', 'role', 'However', 'time', 'no', 'longer', 'cared.Before', 'get', 'too', 'attached', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'ratings', 'dropped', 'week', 'week', 'causing', 'ABC', 'pull', 'will', 'be', 'returning', 'next', 'month', 'believe', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'finish', 'FlashForward', 'storyline', 'good', 'chance', 'ABC', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'renewing', 'next', 'season', 'Nothing', 'worse', 'wasting', 'lot', 'time', 'series', 'nothing', 'being', 'resolved', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'get', 'started', 'series.And', 'finally', 'do', 'decide', 'purchase', 'set', 'get', 'started', 'watching', 'slow', 'unexciting', 'series', 'just', 'be', 'sure', 'drink', 'lot', 'coffee', 'beforehand', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'stay', 'awake']",N/A

1318255,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B0031ZWZR2,GratedTopping,"[2, 2]","In just over 3 days, I watched the entire series. Here are my thoughts (with spoilers).- people's visions should have been all in first-person perspective (but, of course, we couldn't see all the actors then)- I liked how, in the last episode, the man's flashforward from October was rescuing that woman and he was always wondering if he succeeded. All the while, the woman was wondering who was going to be killing her and what she did wrong.Of course, her vision since the start was backwards. It showed her struggling and then sinking, but it was the other way around. Her vision was wrong. So...a flashforward itself may be remembered incorrectly.- Some people recall how they felt emotionally at the moment in the future. I don't think we'd be 'knowing' the fear/anxiety/etc. but those feelings would be coming from just expectations of future.- In the last episode, it was very cool to have that guy at the big party say that he had given up drinking and gave his liquour to Mark. Mark took a drink and I remember saying outloud ""Aw no, that's too bad."" So, it didn't show him drinking while in the building, like in his vision, but he really did get into it at a bar earlier...nevertheless, he was pretty clear-headed and good with that shotgun. I think it would have been more interesting if he wasnot as accurate at times from being as bit tipsy & even been shot at least once somewhere.- The completely least favourite character was that of Demitri's future wife. I didn't think her acting was that good and I thought she was irritating. She always seemed fake and I didn't like her character and manner at all. It's interesting that Dimitri's character, in an extra on a DVD, stated that he thought that many people were interested in the relationship between them. For me, he was quite wrong.- At the start of an episode, you get a quick-shot of a scene that's to be from that episode; like a little clue/flashforward. I'm pretty sure there was one episode where the shot didn't happen in that episode and had nothing to do with it; also, one was out of place from another episode.- We never really know of what was up with that Persian woman completely. She had her own bulletin board of information that was all about event, much like Mark's. We see her later speaking to the chess-playing dude and it was all confusing. Who was she really?- At the last episode's end, what does Charlie mean when she's looking out the window...some guy with an unrecognized voice asks what she sees...and she responds with a smile ""They found him."" Is that even Charlie? You can't really know.- I don't understand the character of 'Floss' one bit. He was an enemy of Simon but then he's in the place eating with the family and is some sort of relative? Confusing.- Well, I never could figure out why Al Gough commited suicide. The call to him in his flashforward was from an attorney saying that Celia was take off life-support and died. The attorney said it wasn't his fault and was an accident, but Al believed he killedher. So he ended his life so that she wouldn't die from an accident he thinks he caused? How does he know he did? He didn't see Celia in his vision. How did he know where she was to send a letter? I doubt people were really leaving full addresses at the Mosaic website. I guess we have to chalk it up to him using the FBI's resourses...but why her anyway? Why not any other person who didn't have a vision?Al killed himself out of guilt because he thought he caused someone's death in the future and Celia was way too happy.- They should have shown more birds falling from the sky during the second blackout. At least we got to see the kangaroo hopping around again and we'll never know what was up with him. In an extra on the DVD, one person involved with the show says she doesn't give away where or where not the kangaroo may be going, but she says that it's a symbol of how things went haywire. Another guy said that it could have just been from a zookeeper who blacked out when a cage was being shut.We saw a loose dog, too. And I remember from other episodes during a review of the blackout, other birds were still flying. Only certain birds and not all animals are affected in a blackout...but why not all birds, at least?- And then in the second blackout, that odd woman was wheeling Janis in the wheelchair. I forget that character's name, but she had on the ring that protected her from the blackout. Where were they going?- Who the heck planted bombs in an FBI building and how could that even be possible?- In one episode (the last one? I forget) That CIA guy said something like ""Mark Benford is dead. Ran into the building. Doesn't stand a chance."" I noticed that the person he was saying it to gave a quick smirk, like he was glad. I think the CIA wanted to destroy the Mosaic and is somewhat behind the conspiracty.- Notice that in the tachyon constant, GABA is mentioned. Some people with too little GABA have seizures. Remember when I spoke of the flashforwards not even being in the right order/mistakes? I predict that whatever caused the blackouts made everyone have aprolonged seizure -- a 'drop attack' as some are identified, where you just immediately lose consciousness.- In one of the extras on a DVD, you see Simon and Dimitri falling from the second blackout; not out of the chairs, like they are in during the last episode, but from standing (like it caught 'em by surprise).- The people actually had a 6 month and 23 day (not including April 29) glimpse into the future.- In the last episode, I see a March 14, 2011 and a Happy New Year 2015. So, this was a major flashforward where people saw different days.- The last scenes have Olivia and Charlie waking up....then the exterior of the FBI building...another second...and THEN it explodes. So, was time itself frozen? There was a little over 30seconds before a bomb was to go off and we saw it counting down. Then the flashforward took place before it went off.So, either time stopped when people were unconscious...or the bomb's timer was wrong and Mark was able to somehow make it out of the building before it went off after he regained consciousness.I'll go for the time stopping. The blackout was much more powerful than the October 6 one. While others were coming to, Mark escaped before the building exploded.- Bryce should have stayed with someone he was getting along with. By just giving up on her, he didn't even care at all -- even if as a friend -- that she was going to be drowning soon. I think that stunk and was a character flaw.- One person does question in an episode if there could be brain damage from the blackouts. They are reasured that everything is fine...but I think the blackouts are causing such problems (as I spoke of before).- In the ""COULD"" extra on the disc 2...* you see Dimitri's girlfriend/future wife walking on the beach and the word BY is engraved in the sand in big letters; it looks so fake, too; what does BY mean and why wasn't it in any real episode showing that scene?* there's a shot of Olivia kissing Mark in the mirror, but turning around it shows her kissing Lloyd; that was never in a real episode and was cool* most interesting, and also not in any episode, is when Mark's got Dimitri again the wall and Mark yells ""I should have killed you!""; I wonder what could have possibly led up to that happening- A sticker on the DVD box states over 100 minutes of extras; the longest extra would have been the only audio-commentary track on the two-part ""Revelation"" episode and the rest were rather short, totalling I'd say 20 minutes altogether.Oh....and I just read that disc 5 menu also has an Easter Egg that yields the nine-part 'Stories from the Mosaic', the documentary-series-within-the-series about individuals' experiences with the blackout. So that should take a bunch of time. I hate 'Easter Eggs'.Nothing should be hidden on a discs.- In the lone commentary with the actor who plays Simon and a female (producer?)...* the actor who plays Simon talks about the Bible a bit and that he specifically doubts the reality of the story of Jonah and the whale; I know that in the Bible, it is only stated that a 'big fish' swallowed Jonah and it wasn't a whale necessarilly; there are reports of people being swallowed and being rescued from such an animal; and, though we don't know, it is possible that Jonah died in the animal and, just like Jesus, was alive on the third day- I don't understand fully how Mark made the connection of the timing of the next flashfoward.- I don't buy Olivia and Mark's breakup; he didn't start drinking...she didn't cheat...they had a kid and should have trusted each other more. They must have already had problems of some kind. She didn't even fight to stay with mark, really. I was disappointed in her behaviour and think she was a terrible as a wife.- It's good that, even though the blackout happened again, there seemed to be less chaos. Well, at least, I would say, in the town. To think that the message of it coming again could have gotten everywhere in the world so quickly is pretty-much unbelievable.Well, all in all, there were too many mysterious things and the ending should have showed specifically what each character's flashforward was. An awesome season finale; a terrible series finale, with so many questions unanswered. The producers promised us they would solve the issues brought up by the flashforward by the end of season one and this didn't fully happen. That had nothing to do with whether the show was renewed or not. If they wanted to create a 2nd flashforward and more issues for next season, that's fine, but they promised a wrap-up by the end of season one and they failed to do as such.We don't know who caused the blackouts and we don't know why or even how exactly. Where were Zoey and Gabriel? What's the deal with Lita?Charlie's vision was too-cryptic. And was it REALLY Charlie? Just because you see her eyes open after the girl says ""they found him"" doesn't mean it really is so. The man who says something to her wasn't Mark or Lloyd.Where was Janis being taken?Will Demetri get back with his almost-wife? Or will he want to help raise his kid with traitor Janis? We see a glimpse of a black baby in the second flashforward. Is that Zoey's and Dimitri's? Or Dimitri's and Janis's?When and where DID Wedeck finally take his bowel movement???",3,good...but I felt let-down (spoilers included),1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,10371,"['just', '3', 'days',

The problem was you standard Hollywood ""that's not how it works"" issues though. To most it would go unnoticed but even my wife who has only been shooting a few times picked up on some glaring mistakes.

1318264,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B0031ZWZR2,Jon Thompson,"[2, 4]","I've noticed a growing trend in network television over the last few years and it bodes ill for both their revenues and the satisfaction of the viewing audience. ""Flash Forward"" is just another example of this trend but it isn't the first example of it.Does anyone remember that very breifly run series ""Vanished"" about the Senator's wife who gets kidnapped? It shares a problematic element with ""Flash Forward"" or the new series ""The Event"". And until the networks realize this element is a series killer, they will continue to pump out more and more of these type shows, only to watch them quickly wither and die.Most new dramatic tv series contain a few common elements, based on the success of certain existing shows that have grown, flourished and even become classics. Think of ""Lost"", ""Alias"", ""Supernatural"", ""Fringe"" among others. One element they all share is the ""season-long story arc"". While individual episodes might have a more or less complete story, they all feed into a single over-arching story arc that lasts for an entire season. Some mystery or danger is introduced in the first episode of the season and that element is developed slowly, episode by episode, right to the very end of the season where it is finally paid off. It may link to yet another mystery which can be left as a cliffhanger, preparing the audience for the next season but the primary questions about that particular tale are essentially answered.Shows that follow this structure run a grave risk, one that caused ""Flash Forward"" to suffer an unexpected demise.I believe the key to whether or not such shows survive is firmly rooted in whether or not that ""overall mystery"" is narrow or broad. If it is broad, as in the case of ""Lost"", ""Supernatural"" and others, it can pretty much go on forever. However if it is too narrow, such as ""Flash Forward"", it is essentially doomed.The thing that made ""Lost"", ""Supernatural"" and ""Fringe"" successful is that rather than a single narrow mystery they present an overall sense of the mystery, one that must first be clarified before it can be ""solved"". For example, with ""Lost"" the overall mystery was 'what is the island and what are those people doing there'. This is broad enough that new episodes can go off in a number of directions, provide hints at an answer that are really only hints about that particular season's specific mystery.""Flash Forward"", unfortunately, was based on a novel with a single clear throughline pointing toward a single solution. Certainly the tv series contained other elements, primarily the little mysteries that were all bits and pieces of that main question 'what was the flash foward, who caused it and why', but aside from those the only other focus was the relationships of the characters, and that sort of focus doesn't fit very well with a mystery show where the focus is the mystery itself. Do we really care if the tormented ex-alcoholic FBI agent is going to wind up having his doctor wife in another mans' bed? Not particularly. Do we care if the Asian FBI agent's fiance foresaw his wedding or his funeral? Naaaa. What we watch the show for, what we watch all mysteries for is 'what is the answer to the mystery'. And therein lies the problem.With so much choice for viewers at the touch of a fingertip we have grown a little picky, more focused on instant gratification than in the depth of any particular story. We want it now, not when the network feels like getting around to giving it to us. And when all you've got to offer is a single big mystery that shows no hint of being ""solved"" any time soon, viewers get bored and annoyed and tune out. The brand new series ""The Event"" seems to be following that same formula, and I predict its quick demise because of that.Because when all you've really got to offer is one big mystery, and everything you show is geared toward that mystery, then you are stuck. If the show is a success (i.e., making you lots of money) you want to keep it going as long as possible. But if all it has is that one big mystery, then you can't move straight toward it because the moment you provide that answer the show is over. Done. Finished. So instead you treat it like a sailboat. Instead of heading straight toward it, like you would have to do if it was a theatrical film, you tend to ""tack"", slowly moving toward the answer but at an angle, going to other places, other ideas. Then you tack back and move a bit further toward that answer but not directly, taking another path so you can visit another smaller mystery first. And you keep doing this, season by season, gaining a tiny bit of ground toward that big mystery but never enough so that you find yourself commited to moving straight toward it. And your audience sits there thinking ""are we THERE yet??"" and getting annoyed and bored.Unfortunately for ""Flash Forward"" it had little else to offer other than that one big mystery and audiences picked up on this very quickly and tuned out. Which is a shame because the novel on which it was based was actually quite interesting and I'm sure they could have squeezed a second season out of it in order to tell the entire story if they'd wanted to. But they'd have been wasting money because by that time the audience was long gone, moved on to other things that would supply their need for immediate gratification. (Watch for the same thing to happen with ""The Event"", if the mystery turns out to be too narrowly focused.)As for ""Flash Forward"" itself, it wasn't bad. Not outstanding, much of it following a tried and true tv fomula (the same momentary crises we've seen on tv a thousand times before) but it was well produced, very professionally done. But like those other ""one mystery"" shows, it only had a single thing to offer, and took far too long in giving the audience what it craved, the ""answer"". Too much time with the barker doing his ""hurry, hurry, hurry, see it on the inside!"" before they started letting the suckers into the tent. Most of them got tired of waiting and went off to get some cotton candy instead.Right now I'm concerned that one of my favorite new shows ""Fringe"", going into its third season, has decided to narrow down its focus to that ""one big mystery"" and will go the same way. Which would be a shame. X-Files managed to keep us on the hook for nine seasons, because it told us there was a mystery but then teasingly danced away from even defining what that mystery was. It kept us on the edge of our seats for a long time. ""Flash Forward"" totally lost us because they wouldn't ""get on with it"". And alas, they couldn't do that because that would have been the end for it. Instead it just ended because we got bored and wandered away. And I doubt it will be much missed. There's too much out there to capture our attention.Until tv networks learn the lessons of ""Lost"" and ""X-Files"" we'll see a lot more of these type shows, propelled along by one big mystery they don't dare pay out if they want to keep the show alive. And because of that, those shows will quickly strangle on their own inability to progress toward the big payoff.",3,TV sometimes just don't get it,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,7088,"[""'ve"",

They give the good slots to the crap reality shows, and people watch them because they are the only thing that's on. Then the networks use those numbers to justify keeping that garbage on the air. What's wrong with them?!?There are a lot of shows that were canceled long before they should have, but this was one of the worst.

1318285,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,B0031ZWZR2,Rons Reviews,"[7, 9]","Flash Forward: Season one-Part oneIts 11:00 a.m. Pacific Standard time, and everyone in the world passes out for exactly two minutes and seventeen seconds, during which, they all have a vision of their lives six months into the future.  Once everyone awakens, there are disasters everywhere.  Planes, helicopters, cars, and busses, have crashed, patients in surgery have died, swimmers have drowned, chaos reigns.  A team of FBI agents in LA are assigned to figure out what happened, how it happened, will it happen again, and can it be prevented.  John Q. Public tries to deal with their individual Flash Forwards (Visions).  Are they real, and can the future be changed.During the FBI investigation, video tapes are reviewed.  People are seen passing out at banks, grocery stores, malls, and sporting events.  One tape reveals a person walking around at a baseball game while everyone else in the world is passed out.  Intrigued? Welcome to ABC's newest science fiction anthology series ""Flash Forward"".""Flash Forward"" premiered on September 24th 2009, and after ten episodes, went on hiatus. With episode eleven scheduled to be broadcast on March 18th, ABC released the first ten episodes in a two Disc set on February 23rd.  This would appear to be a marketing ploy to allow people who have possibly missed some of the shows to get caught up, but more importantly to draw attention to a series that has been off the air since November. One can certainly wonder how effective this will be since the episodes are available online, and people who are interested in owning the series would wait for a full season release.Nonetheless, ""Flash Forward"" opens with two strong episodes that are sure to draw in the most skeptical and even those who don't consider themselves science fiction fans. The characters are generally easy to relate to, and the individual stories are told effectively considering the limited time available. The introduction of the mysterious figure at the end of episode one, the discovery of a second person who apparently also was immune to that which caused mankind to blackout, and the delivery of the line ""D. Gibbons is a bad man"" (Which needs to be on T-Shirts) by the young daughter (Lennon Wynn as Charlie Benford) of the lead F.B.I. agent (Joseph Fiennes as Mark Benford) on the case, make for some of the most enthralling writing for television in years.Unfortunately, when you start that strong, it is hard to sustain the momentum, and the writing for ""Flash Forward"" does begin to falter, as due some of the performances. Though it has only been ten episodes, there are still too many storylines that have gone no where and though they still may, from a purely investigative perspective it seems illogical that they have not thus far. The introduction of a possible explanation to the unusual event could easily be seen as a huge error in judgment by the writers, as it clearly seemed to suck the energy out of the episode in which it occurred. Certain characters have made choices and taken action that seem obviously inconsistent with that which has been established, and other actors are simply not up to the task of playing the roles in which they have been cast.  Sadly, one of the most obvious is Dominic Monaghan, who was so wonderful to watch as Charlie on ""Lost"", but is now miscast as Simon Campos, the arrogant Quantum Physics Genius who claims to have been responsible for the blackouts.Weather ""Flash Forward"" can regain the excitement and mystery established in the first two episodes remains to be seen. That and the answers to many other questions are forthcoming in the next six weeks. Regardless, it would seem that a release of the first ten episodes on DVD with bonus features that include a look ahead as well as an interesting and entertaining, though all too brief, feature on how the series opening scene was created, is going to be somewhat of a hard sell.Recommendation: ""Flash Forward"" has the potential to follow in the successful footsteps of the phenomenon that is ""Lost"". The writing needs to get back on track, allow the characters to be more consistent in their behavior, and some of the performances need to get better.  There is certainly enough pure energy and mystery in the first few episodes of the series to make them worth owning, but waiting for the entire first season to be available would seem to be a better choice in these tough economic times.",3,Flash Forward,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,4425,"['Flash', 'Forward', 'Season', 'one-Part', 'oneIts', '11:00', 'a.m.', 'Pacific', 'Standard', 'time', 'everyone', 'world', 'out', 'exactly', 'two', 'minutes', 'seventeen', 'seconds', 'have', 'vision', 'lives', 'six', 'months', 'future', 'Once', 'everyone', 'awakens', 'are', 'disasters', 'everywhere', 'Planes', 'helicopters', 'cars', 'busses', 'have', 'crashed', 'patients', 'surgery', 'have', 'died', 'swimmers', 'have', 'drowned', 'chaos', 'reigns', 'team', 'FBI', 'agents', 'LA', 'are', 'assigned', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'happened', 'will', 'happen', 'again', 'can', 'be', 'prevented', 'John', 'Q', 'Public', 'deal', 'individual', 'Flash', 'Forwards', 'Visions', 'Are', 'real', 'can', 'future', 'be', 'changed.During', 'FBI', 'investigation', 'video', 'tapes', 'are', 'reviewed', 'People', 'are', 'seen', 'passing', 'out', 'banks', 'grocery', 'stores', 'malls', 'sporting', 'events', 'One', 'tape', 'person', 'walking', 'around', 'baseball', 'game', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'passed', 'out', 'Intrigued', 'Welcome', 'ABC', 'newest', 'science', 'fiction', 'anthology', 'series', 'Flash', 'Forward', 'Flash', 'Forward', 'premiered', 'September', '24th', '2009', 'ten', 'episodes', 'went', 'hiatus', 'episode', 'eleven', 'scheduled', 'be', 'broadcast', 'March', '18th', 'ABC', 'released', 'first', 'ten', 'episodes', 'two', 'Disc', 'set', 'February', '23rd', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'allow', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'possibly', 'missed', 'shows', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'more', 'importantly', 'draw', 'attention', 'series', 'been', 'off', 'air', 'November', 'One', 'can', 'certainly', 'wonder', 'how', 'effective', 'will', 'be', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'online', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'owning', 'series', 'would', 'wait', 'full', 'season', 'release.Nonetheless', 'Flash', 'Forward', 'two', 'strong', 'episodes', 'are', 'sure', 'draw', 'most', 'skeptical', 'even', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'easy', 'relate', 'individual', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'effectively', 'considering', 'limited', 'time', 'available', 'introduction', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'end', 'episode', 'one', 'discovery', 'second', 'person', 'who', 'apparently', 'also', 'was', 'immune', 'caused', 'mankind', 'blackout', 'delivery', 'line', 'D.', 'Gibbons', 'bad', 'man', 'Which', 'be', 'T-Shirts', 'young', 'daughter', 'Lennon', 'Wynn', 'Charlie', 'Benford', 'lead', 'F.B.I', 'agent', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Mark', 'Benford', 'case', 'make', 'most', 'enthralling', 'writing', 'television', 'years.Unfortunately', 'when', 'start', 'strong', 'hard', 'sustain', 'momentum', 'writing', 'Flash', 'Forward', 'begin', 'falter', 'due', 'performances', 'only', 'been', 'ten', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'too', 'many', 'storylines', 'have', 'gone', 'where', 'still', 'may', 'purely', 'investigative', 'perspective', 'illogical', 'have', 'not', 'thus', 'far', 'introduction', 'possible', 'explanation', 'unusual', 'event', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'seen', 'huge', 'error', 'judgment', 'writers', 'clearly', 'seemed', 'suck', 'energy', 'episode', 'occurred', 'Certain', 'characters', 'have', 'made', 'choices', 'taken', 'action', 'seem', 'obviously', 'inconsistent', 'been', 'established', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'task', 'playing', 'roles', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'Sadly', 'one', 'most', 'obvious', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'Charlie', 'Lost', 'now', 'miscast', 'Simon', 'Campos', 'arrogant', 'Quantum', 'Physics', 'Genius', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'blackouts.Weather', 'Flash', 'Forward', 'can', 'regain', 'excitement', 'mystery', 'established', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'be', 'seen', 'answers', 'many', 'other', 'questions', 'are', 'forthcoming', 'next', 'six', 'weeks', 'Regardless', 'would', 'seem', 'release', 'first', 'ten', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'look', 'ahead', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'too', 'brief', 'feature', 'how', 'series', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'created', 'going', 'be', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'sell.Recommendation', 'Flash', 'Forward', 'potential', 'follow', 'successful', 'footsteps', 'phenomenon', 'Lost', 'writing', 'needs', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'allow', 'characters', 'be', 'more', 'consistent', 'behavior', 'performances', 'need', 'get', 'better', 'certainly', 'enough', 'pure', 'energy', 'mystery', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'series', 'make', 'worth', 'owning', 'waiting', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'available', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'better', 'choice', 'tough', 'economic', 'times']",N/A

1318287,AMP6LJ9WW3YC,B0031ZWZR2,sebastian crane,"[10, 18]","There is a premise that sounds at least promising, but the result ends up sounding like a Hallmark movie made on the cheap (and all the sappy music cues are right on target), and looking like one of those direct to dvd sci-fi flicks. This has the stink of Brannon Braga all over it--the same guy responsible for the execrable ""Threshold,"" as well as the sharp drop in the quality of ""24"" in the past couple of years, and the guy who's vision of Star Trek was to drive it into the ground (who knew that the crashing of the Starship Enterprise in ""Star Trek: Generations"" would be such an ideal metaphor for Braga's guardianship of the franchise?). Even though the premise of ""FlashForward"" doesn't exactly capture the imagination, it has the potential to turn into something good, but the premise alone can't hold up the show. The writing is utterly mundane, hackneyed, and cliche-ridden--the dialogue among characters is typical of low-budget cable made for tv movies. And, of course, there is the typical calculated effort to be ever-so-slightly edgy/scandalous in the graphic depiction of a lesbian relationship. Braga is trying to remain relevant during a time when guys with real ideas for freshness, like J.J. Abrams, Tim Kring, Damon Lindeloff, and Carlton Cuse, are really providing compelling sci-fi viewing. Braga's time has passed--he can't keep up with these guys. His ideas are like something pot-smoking college students might come up with during a night in their dorm room on the mary jane. ""Wouldn't it be cool, if, like, everybody passed out for a minute and saw a vision of themselves 6 months in the future."" ""Dude yeah, that would be insane."" I know the show is based on a novel, but it's just the kind of thing Braga would be associated with. ""Lost"" and ""Fringe"" are both built on premises that are actually challenging to the viewer; they are conceptualized in a way that is quite fresh, with depth that the viewer will find unpredictable. Even though ""Heroes"" has hit the skids, it started out pretty great too and was at least compelling even though the concept of superheroes is not new--Kring was able to inject some life into what could have been another flaccid genre show; too bad it ended up being turned over to people not as talented as Tim Kring. I predict this show, like other projects Braga has been associated with, will die a quick death, and end up being one of those ""The Complete Series"" sets that you can get used on Amazon for around (...), like ""Surface,"" and ""Point Pleasant,"" and ""Threshold.""Is the series horrible? No, but in a way, being utterly mediocre is worse because it just reaffirms how bereft of imagination some show creators and tv writers are (and how barren the creative landscape is). If someone really took a bold shot at something interesting, and it turned out bad, that would at least be more respectable than this repository of cliches and TV conventionalism. I will say this, however, the show was edgy enough to have a white male as president of the United States. I'm sure in the environment of network and cable tv, any arrangement that resembles the ""traditional"" social fabric is a tad odd. For that, I give them credit. The truly ""edgy"" thing one can do today is NOT to be edgy, because it would be totally unexpected. Remember when Madonna and Britney Spears kissed on stage during that performance--yeah, it was the least surprising thing I've ever seen. What WOULD have been truly unexpected would be for them NOT to have tried to do something scandalous, because everyone knows that they're going to. Putting on a professional show is all you need. If the show is organically conceived and intelligently written, that's where its quality lies; there's no need for ""edginess.""The above comments should not be construed to suggest that I object to a non-white male president (in fact, I think it's a cause for celebration), I just find it tiring that so many shows do avoid writing the president as a white male when you know they do it just because they're specifically trying to incorporate edginess or progressivism into the show. Battlestar Galactica did it, Prison Break, and 24 both according to race and gender (all before the election of Obama). And it would be great to see that change sometimes, if only the shows didn't reek of calculated edginess.Oh, and let me add that I agree with those who condemn the practice of releasing half-season sets so the company can squeeze more bucks out of us. I absolutely refuse to buy Eureka season 3.0, getting half a season for not much less than a full season costs. I understand that they don't plan to release the second half of ""FlashForward"" alone, they're just going to release the whole season. I think I read that, but I'm not absolutely sure it's true. If it is, the people who bought this set will essentially have to buy it again to get the full season. I think, however, in this case they're just trying to build more of an audience for the show when it resumes. It makes sense, but the only hard evidence I have is that the set comes with a (...) coupon for the full season when it is released.How do you do italics on this thing? It pains me to put titles in quotation marks when they should be italicized.Hmm, they took out my references to dollar amounts. Anybody know why?

1318288,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B0031ZWZR2,Steven Herring,"[73, 83]","Flashforward was the show to replace LOST. The networks promoted it as such and some of us even believed it could be as good as the television greatness benchmark. I never thought that it would replace LOST, but I had hoped it would fill the void after LOST went into the great beyond. The show from the start was disappointing. It was never bad just not up to the level of greatness that ABC had promoted it as. The story took a little long to develope and the characters themselves lacked depth for far too long. As the show reached it's hiatus though the stories and characters really kicked into gear. The plot twists we expected from the show finally started to appear. As the show entered hiatus it was really on a roll, and when it came back four months later it really amped up the action with amazing episodes. Some of the stories in the show never really interested me. Like Aaron and his dead daughter. It always seemed seperated from the central mythos and Aaron and Tracy themselves always seemed like they should have been left on the cutting room floor. Thankfully this deadly duo didn't recieve alot of screen time throughout the series and I was greatful. The actors themselves did a great job. They never missed a beat. Dominic Monoughan joining the cast after a few episodes was a welcome treat and was the real start of the story picking up.When Simon is introduced to the plot another side of the story is revealed. You finally start to see who was behind the blackout, but never to my satisfaction do you find out why they did it. There were some clues that Mark obtained that never seemed to pan out to real revelations, but I can assume that they would have been important to the plot had the show continued. The love triangle between Mark, Olivia, and Lloyd is very well done. Mark is the main character and he has to choose between saving the world and saving his marriage. Olivia Mark's wife sees herself with Lloyd in her flashforward. Though she is loyal to her husband it soon becomes apparent that the universe has other things in store. Mark has to try and maintain his life at home while trying to unravel the mysteries behind the global blackout. It adds a great depth and vulnerability to the protagonist. Another interesting plot is Mark's partner Domitri who saw nothing when he blacked out. He soon finds out that if you saw no future you will be dead by April 29th. It's really cool to see how this character deals with his mortality. The main plot and question to the series is the most interesting. Can the future be changed? How these characters fight the future or make sure it comes true is an interesting window into how these characters think and feel about their lives and who they really are.The show in the first few episodes was centered more on the overall plot of the blackout and less on the characters and their development. After a few episodes though they complimented themselves nicely and I started to really care about these people. As the series continued it added more character centric episodes that explained each character through flashbacks of their time before the blackout, or during it. This really helped the series to delve into what makes these characters tick and the series was way better for it. The show does have a sci fi element to it, but that shouldn't scare anyone away from this astounding series. The characters themselves root the plot in reality as they struggle to fight the future. A bit of a warning to those that buy this series on DVD or Blu Ray the show does not have a tidy ending. The final episode was shot as a season finale so there is a cliffhangar. It's nothing too serious and you can create your own ending based on what you learn, but it sure does leave you begging for more. This series ultimatly failed to capture the imagination of the audience and that is a shame. It may have been chosen as the sucessor to LOST, but what can really live up to that hype. Flashforward turned into one of the more enjoyable series this year, but unfortunatly there was no one left watching to experience it. I recommend it to fans of the serialized dramas like LOST or Fringe as it is a unique story thats worth your time.",5,What did you see?,1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,4209,"['Flashforward', 'was', 'show', 'replace', 'LOST', 'networks', 'promoted', 'such', 'even', 'believed', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'television', 'greatness', 'benchmark', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'replace', 'LOST', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'fill', 'void', 'LOST', 'went', 'great', 'show', 'start', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'never', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'level', 'greatness', 'ABC', 'had', 'promoted', 'story', 'took', 'little', 'long', 'develope', 'characters', 'lacked', 'depth', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'show', 'reached', 'hiatus', 'stories', 'characters', 'really', 'kicked', 'gear', 'plot', 'expected', 'show', 'finally', 'started', 'appear', 'show', 'entered', 'hiatus', 'was', 'really', 'roll', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'four', 'months', 'later', 'really', 'amped', 'up', 'action', 'amazing', 'episodes', 'stories', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'interested', 'Aaron', 'dead', 'daughter', 'always', 'seemed', 'seperated', 'central', 'mythos', 'Aaron', 'Tracy', 'always', 'seemed', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Thankfully', 'deadly', 'duo', 'did', ""n't"", 'recieve', 'alot', 'screen', 'time', 'series', 'was', 'greatful', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'never', 'missed', 'beat', 'Dominic', 'Monoughan', 'joining', 'cast', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'welcome', 'treat', 'was', 'real', 'start', 'story', 'picking', 'up.When', 'Simon', 'introduced', 'plot', 'side', 'story', 'revealed', 'finally', 'start', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'blackout', 'never', 'satisfaction', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'did', 'were', 'clues', 'Mark', 'obtained', 'never', 'seemed', 'pan', 'out', 'real', 'revelations', 'can', 'assume', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'important', 'plot', 'had', 'show', 'continued', 'love', 'triangle', 'Mark', 'Olivia', 'Lloyd', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Mark', 'main', 'character', 'choose', 'saving', 'world', 'saving', 'marriage', 'Olivia', 'Mark', 'wife', 'Lloyd', 'flashforward', 'loyal', 'husband', 'soon', 'apparent', 'universe', 'other', 'things', 'store', 'Mark', 'try', 'maintain', 'life', 'home', 'trying', 'unravel', 'mysteries', 'global', 'blackout', 'great', 'depth', 'vulnerability', 'protagonist', 'interesting', 'plot', 'Mark', 'partner', 'Domitri', 'who', 'saw', 'nothing', 'when', 'blacked', 'out', 'soon', 'out', 'saw', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'April', '29th', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'how', 'character', 'mortality', 'main', 'plot', 'question', 'series', 'most', 'interesting', 'Can', 'future', 'be', 'changed', 'How', 'characters', 'fight', 'future', 'make', 'sure', 'true', 'interesting', 'window', 'how', 'characters', 'think', 'feel', 'lives', 'who', 'really', 'are.The', 'show', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'centered', 'more', 'overall', 'plot', 'blackout', 'less', 'characters', 'development', 'few', 'episodes', 'complimented', 'nicely', 'started', 'really', 'care', 'people', 'series', 'continued', 'added', 'more', 'character', 'centric', 'episodes', 'explained', 'character', 'flashbacks', 'time', 'blackout', 'really', 'helped', 'series', 'delve', 'what', 'characters', 'tick', 'series', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'show', 'have', 'sci', 'fi', 'element', 'should', ""n't"", 'scare', 'anyone', 'away', 'astounding', 'series', 'characters', 'root', 'plot', 'reality', 'struggle', 'fight', 'future', 'bit', 'warning', 'buy', 'series', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'show', 'not', 'have', 'tidy', 'ending', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'shot', 'season', 'finale', 'cliffhangar', 'nothing', 'too', 'serious', 'can', 'create', 'own', 'ending', 'based', 'what', 'learn', 'sure', 'leave', 'begging', 'more', 'series', 'ultimatly', 'failed', 'capture', 'imagination', 'audience', 'shame', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'sucessor', 'LOST', 'what', 'can', 'really', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Flashforward', 'turned', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'year', 'unfortunatly', 'was', 'one', 'left', 'watching', 'experience', 'recommend', 'fans', 'serialized', 'dramas', 'LOST', 'Fringe', 'unique', 'story', 'thats', 'time']",N/A

1318291,A1B9ISLYYCHIVE,B0031ZWZR2,"The Curmudgeon ""Your life lacks purpose - my ...","[7, 18]","""The New Lost."" I wonder how often we'll hear that phrase in the future, every time the next ""High Concept"" sci-fi drivel comes along? Because even though it's meant as hopeful praise by over-eager critics, it's this albatross that only leads to disappointment with the show in the long run. ""Heroes"" was described as The New Lost, right before it held its nose and dive bombed into the toilet after its first season. And then, of course, Flashforward, another New Lost, with it's chin-stroking premise and flashy, expensive opening episode. Which, as is now tradition, ran out of steam after that episode and spent the next 21 torturous hours wrapping itself in knots and boring everyone senseless before being rightfully drop-kicked into TV oblivion.So that all important premise first; everyone on the planet collapses and loses consciousness for 137 seconds, at which point they see a glimpse of their life six months in the future. Ooooh, how about that, then? Some people see nothing (gasp! They're dead! But how?) Some people see themselves with a different partner (gasp! But how?) and our hero Mark (played by charisma-vacuum Joseph Fiennes) sees himself surrounded by a wall of clues he'd collected in those 6 months whilst someone with a gun tries to kill him (gasp! But.. yeah, you get the idea). The most crucial clue of all was something he missed though. Buried among the scraps of paper and Polaroid pictures was, in my handwriting, the words, ""ABSOLUTELY NO-ONE CARES.""And that is the killing blow to Flashforward. Original, intriguing premise aside, there is just nothing TO Flashforward. Everything that made Lost great, the reasons its the new benchmark for all future science fiction television, have all been, oh ho! ""lost"" in the production of FF. Interesting, believable, layered characters. Episodes packed with action, suspense, humour, sadness. Story arcs packed with twists, mis-direction and surprise. A need for in-depth knowledge of the show that rewards patient, dedicated fans. And, whatever you think of the finale of the show, Lost had all of these and more, and, crucially, Fast Forward has none of them.Like Heroes before it, things will happen in Flashforward. Buildings will explode, guns will fire, people will shout, people will throw themselves off buildings, that annoying smug idiot with the sick kid will be revealed as the guy behind it all, Joseph Fiennes will be tempted to, dun dun duuuuuun, DRINK AGAIN, causing him to, oh no, ACT A BIT), Joseph Fienne's wife will be as bland and boring as possible and.. oh God, it's a struggle even to write all of this. Like I said, things happen, but you will NOT care. Not a bit. You're only watching it because you've been told it's ""The New Lost"", you'll have been tricked into the (really pretty good) opening episode and you'll wonder why, deep down, you couldn't give a crap about any of it. Dominic Monaghan could devolve into Splinter, complete with pink bathrobe and walking stick, and you wouldn't even blink. You'll wonder why you can't remember any of these characters names. You'll be puzzled why you can't actually remember why certain people are doing certain things. You'll find yourself asking ""who's this guy again?"" And you'll wonder; maybe it's part of the overall Flashforward effect, the fact that the episodes last an hour and you curiously lose consciousness after the first 12 minutes, until you wake to the sound of the end credits rolling and another hour of your life gone up in smoke.Boring, 2D characters running around joylessly piecing together a puzzle that's not interesting in the first place. That's not great writing - that's just a waste of a good concept. With better writing, better characters and a pinch of a sense of humour could have made Flashforward another sci-fi triumph instead of yet another casualty. Still, never mind. I see that the 80s sci-fi classic ""V"" has been remade. Wow!

1318292,A96JD9312DHWC,B0031ZWZR2,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[3, 4]","About the Set:Barring the fact that this is only half a season of a show (you get 10 episodes - not exactly what I call happiness but a nice way to get a show fix), it is a nice little set to pick up. You can get an idea of what the show is about, if you like it or not, and if you want to continue with the season.The Show Idea:For a little over 2 minutes, the people experience a blackout that seems to impact everyone. During that time, 20 million people die, a number or injuries occur, and people are left wondering why. What's more, most people experience around 2 minutes and 17 seconds of a Flash Forward and see what will happen to them on a specific day in April. Some people see happiness, some see revelations and infidelity, and some see other things. Some see nothing, however, and quickly come to think that they may have no future. This action leads the government to wonder a lot of things, amely if we were attacked and if it will happen again. This leads us to our main cast of characters, to a group of people that seem to have some sinister reasons behind their actions, and to the revelation that a man was caught on video not blacked out.Thoughts:I personally found the first ten episodes captivating when reviewed on DVD, and can say that the next two episodes on TV keep up the action. The acting in the show is top notch and a lot of people - both known and unknown - appear here. This leads to some seasoned actors showing off some really great performances and keeping my attention. Even the kids in the show - two main ones thusfar - have been great. They show the correct emotions and one of them seems frightened by something she will not talk about.The idea of the show is great as well. The Flash Forwards themselves are like a gargantuan web and, when strung, they seem disconnected and odd. One epissode shows just how many that are reported, however, with a website being put up by the government and over 9 million postings being shown. When a lot of these are put together they give you an idea that something big is going on and that one man is the key to everything. It also shows you that the main people are not the saints they may want to be, that the future can be interesting for the FBI and others, and that people are confused by what happened. Combine this with the questions (1) will it happen again and (2)can the future be changed (you get an idea about both of these) and you have yourself a show.Would I buy this? Yes if you want it now. You know a bigger set will come later BUT having it now has been nice. I saw a number of things I wanted to revisit here on the DVD and, honestly, I like having it without interruption. I also like the show a lot, wondering about the people with no future, the crows, the thing that happened in 1991, and so on.Hopefully this review helps to explain things and tell you if you need the show or not.

Amazing concept, good actors,It could have been one of the best shows ever made on TV!The real downside comes from the stupid network-writing for the ""simple-minded"".I imagine the creators fighting with the ABC guys who demanded ""dumbing-down"" with the usualstorylines (""We need a mole, We need a double agent, We need more love-life issues......"")Of course the show was not really finished, but the ""End"" is not so bad..... Actually it would have been a greatending had they really focused on ONE SEASON and focused 100 % on finishing their plot.Still worth a buy!And my advice to the creators!
