167565,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,097673107X,D. Fowler,"[1, 1]","Years ago I had Marine Aquarium:  A Virtual Undersea Paradise loaded onto my computer.  Didn't everyone?  Now I simply use a select picture for my desktop.  I was very pleasantly surprised to watch and listen to the soothing, relaxing sounds and sights of Saltwater Reef.  It was a bit amusing to see a clownfish get ""stuck"" in a sea anemone.  I've been down to the bottom of the ocean and this is quite realistic as the fish swim around the coral and moving sea anemones.  I'd watch for a while and then listen.  It was fun to watch, but then I'd just listen to it.There are also two other clips to watch, an aquarium with goldfish and a mountain stream.  The sounds of the Aquarium for Your Home and the Saltwater Reef and very similar.  The aquarium is something small children would enjoy watching as the goldfish flit around the tank.  I know my son loved watching them in large restaurant tanks and the one we had at home.  The Cascade Mountain Stream, was actually filmed in Washington state.  The stream is not one that gurgles and trickles, but rather is that of a rushing stream.  All in all, I did enjoy watching and listening to all of them.SPECS:Video Format:  High DefinitionViewing Options:  Full screenMain Soundtrack:  Dolby DigitalDisc Format:  DVD VideoFormatting:  Region ZeroTotal Run Time:  1-hour 50 minutes and LoopablePlayable On:  All DVD Players in all CountriesLanguage:  EnglishSample provided for review.",5,"This is a very soothing sounding trio of a Saltwater Reef, Aquarium for Your Home, and the Cascade Mountain Stream ...",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1434,"['Years', 'ago', 'had', 'Marine', 'Aquarium', 'Virtual', 'Undersea', 'Paradise', 'loaded', 'computer', 'Did', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'Now', 'simply', 'use', 'select', 'picture', 'desktop', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'watch', 'listen', 'soothing', 'relaxing', 'sounds', 'sights', 'Saltwater', 'Reef', 'was', 'bit', 'amusing', 'see', 'clownfish', 'get', 'stuck', 'sea', 'anemone', ""'ve"", 'been', 'down', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'quite', 'realistic', 'fish', 'swim', 'coral', 'moving', 'sea', 'anemones', ""'d"", 'watch', 'while', 'then', 'listen', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'then', ""'d"", 'just', 'listen', 'it.There', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'other', 'clips', 'watch', 'aquarium', 'goldfish', 'mountain', 'stream', 'sounds', 'Aquarium', 'Your', 'Home', 'Saltwater', 'Reef', 'very', 'similar', 'aquarium', 'something', 'small', 'children', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'goldfish', 'flit', 'tank', 'know', 'son', 'loved', 'watching', 'large', 'restaurant', 'tanks', 'one', 'had', 'home', 'Cascade', 'Mountain', 'Stream', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Washington', 'state', 'stream', 'not', 'one', 'gurgles', 'trickles', 'rather', 'rushing', 'stream', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'listening', 'them.SPECS', 'Video', 'Format', 'High', 'DefinitionViewing', 'Options', 'Full', 'screenMain', 'Soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'DigitalDisc', 'Format', 'DVD', 'VideoFormatting', 'Region', 'ZeroTotal', 'Run', 'Time', '1-hour', '50', 'minutes', 'LoopablePlayable', 'DVD', 'Players', 'CountriesLanguage', 'EnglishSample', 'provided', 'review']",N/A

If I can do it, anyone can.  LOL! This was the perfect DVD to keep my four cats amused for  the better part of the day, since I kept playing it over and over for them.  They particularly loved the goldfish segment and did some nasty things to me and my living room rug, when I didn't replay it enough for their pleasure. (darn bossy cats!)Now when I sit down they start pawing at the remote.I, a mere human, loved the bonus of the  Cascade Mountain Stream.  It took my mind off of the horrible heat and humidity and allowed me to doze as the stream babbled in the background.At a playing time of 110 minutes that could be one heck of a nap.The colors a crisp and the pictures are clear even on my cheapish TV set.  The audio is just enough so it doesn't get on your nerves.I kind of think of this as something you would read about in one of J.R. Robb's books about the future - like a mood screen!

167568,AEC90GPFKLAAW,097673107X,"Lisa Kearns ""Lisa Kearns""","[1, 1]","I received Saltwater Reef free from the publisher, in exchange for writing an honest review.  This DVD contains three different videos - the saltwater reef, a goldfish aquarium, and a mountain stream.  All of them are colorful and relaxing, and look very real.  It will play on either a DVD player or a computer monitor.I was familiar with this type of DVD because our pediatrician has the goldfish aquarium one in his waiting room.  I see small children riveted by the fish, squealing and trying to catch them, every time we visit.I think the reef video should have been slowed down just a tiny bit - the plants waving look faster than I've ever seen ocean plants waving.  But the starfish, snail and many different fish are fun to watch.The goldfish aquarium is all the color and fun without the mess and maintenance of actual goldfish.  The bubbling sounds in the background are calming and sound like an actual aquarium.  If you have a wall-mounted flat screen TV, people will think you have a built-in aquarium.The mountain stream is wonderful for background white noise.  It's interesting to look at, and the water is mesmerizing, but the picture doesn't change a lot.  For anyone with insomnia or noisy neighbors, the sound of it is tranquil and would be great to help fall asleep.",5,"Colorful, calming, and two bonus videos",1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,1288,"['received', 'Saltwater', 'Reef', 'free', 'publisher', 'exchange', 'writing', 'honest', 'review', 'DVD', 'three', 'different', 'videos', 'saltwater', 'reef', 'goldfish', 'aquarium', 'mountain', 'stream', 'are', 'colorful', 'relaxing', 'look', 'very', 'real', 'will', 'play', 'DVD', 'player', 'computer', 'monitor.I', 'was', 'familiar', 'type', 'DVD', 'pediatrician', 'goldfish', 'aquarium', 'one', 'waiting', 'room', 'see', 'small', 'children', 'riveted', 'fish', 'squealing', 'trying', 'catch', 'time', 'visit.I', 'think', 'reef', 'video', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'slowed', 'down', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'plants', 'waving', 'look', 'faster', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'ocean', 'plants', 'waving', 'starfish', 'snail', 'many', 'different', 'fish', 'are', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'goldfish', 'aquarium', 'color', 'fun', 'mess', 'maintenance', 'actual', 'goldfish', 'bubbling', 'sounds', 'background', 'are', 'calming', 'sound', 'actual', 'aquarium', 'have', 'wall-mounted', 'flat', 'screen', 'TV', 'people', 'will', 'think', 'have', 'built-in', 'aquarium.The', 'mountain', 'stream', 'wonderful', 'background', 'white', 'noise', 'interesting', 'look', 'water', 'mesmerizing', 'picture', ""n't"", 'change', 'lot', 'anyone', 'insomnia', 'noisy', 'neighbors', 'sound', 'tranquil', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'help', 'fall', 'asleep']",N/A
167569,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,097673107X,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[0, 0]","I used to have many aquariums in my home - both saltwater and freshwater. I loved sitting and watching the fish swim around. It was incredibly restful. Even now, when I go into stores or restaurants with aquariums, I find myself drawn to them. So I was eager to give Aquarium For Your Home a try.Aquarium For Your Home The DVD has three tracks. Each one loops on itself to create a seamless view of that world. The first track is a saltwater aquarium with tropical fish. The second is a freshwater goldfish tank. The third is a rippling mountain stream.The first one - of the tropical aquarium - is my least favorite of the trio. It looks like they have the current set to ""tsunami mode"" - wildly blowing the plants all around. I definitely wouldn't have the current in any of my tanks set this high. I feel sorry for the fish at times, working against it. Also, the scene randomly changes just when you're watching something - and it will zoom in or zoom out. So I don't find this video to be restful. I suppose if it was somewhere that people were coming and going, like a waiting room, people might not mind. But as the DVD says it's for personal use only, I'm not sure that could work. Even the filter sound is odd, as if it was dubbed in afterward. Finally, the colors chosen for the tank are garishly bright. I adore tropical tanks, too, so I would have thought this would be my favorite.I'm sure some will really like the tropical tank and not mind the random changes and the fast current. For me, with all the other superb options out there for tropical fishtank DVDs, this one just doesn't measure up.The DVD shines in the goldfish tank, though. Here we have a much more natural background combination. I love the rock arch to the right. There are about five goldfish - one white with orange tops, a few traditional fancy tails, and then a darker one. They are slow and gentle in their movements - far more natural than the frenetic tropical fish. They go up to feed sometimes, sometimes they snuffle around in the rocks, and sometimes they're just content to swim. I enjoyed this track immensely, and can meditate to it with no issues. There are no ""cuts"" at all in this track. The only down side, again, is the filter audio track. I don't think any of my filters ever sounded like this. Still, you can turn it down or use your own music if you wish.The mountain stream is quite relaxing - and again there are no cuts or changes. In a way it is the best of the three. It's peaceful, serene, and the noise feels quite natural here. Occasionally you get a bird flitting overhead. It is ideal for meditation or background imagery. If there's any complaints with this track, it's that the video is overexposed. The background and some of the water areas are blindingly bright. That should easily have been remedied with some exposure settings in the camera, or even in the video processing software used afterward.So, to summarize. Certainly I agree with the concept of having a virtual aquarium or stream. There are many, many options for this both on Amazon as well as for free on YouTube. Many of those are in full high definition. So it's not a question of whether having this option is a good thing - it's a question of whether this particular option is superior to the many other choices out there.If it was just the tropical aquarium, I'd say no. I've seen many other tropical aquarium videos which are much more relaxing. It's a combination of many factors - the current speed, the lighting, and the noise.However, I give the DVD high marks for the goldfish tank and the mountain stream tracks. Those are both very well done. Not perfect, certainly, as mentioned. But still quite good, and well worth having in a library.I would like to see them come out with new versions that do a better job with lighting and sound. With modern equipment those should be easy enough to fix.I was sent a review copy of this DVD to evaluate.",4,Goldfish and Stream are good.

Daniel ""Alex""","[0, 0]","Aquarium For Your Home turns your television set into an aquarium -- the entire screen is covered with one of three environments: a saltwater reef, a goldfish tank, and a mountainside stream.  If you're familiar with Fireplace For Your Home (turns your television into a fireplace facsimile), this DVD works the same way.  All three of these environments showcase a fixed camera viewpoint while fish (or running water) travel across the screen in front of you.The saltwater reef changes setting every few minutes to offer another view with different sets of fish.  These changes are never abrupt, and they don't detract from the relaxation.  The fish are mostly pretty fun to watch too.  Throughout its duration, you will be able to hear the sounds of water slowly bubbling in the background.  If this is distracting to you, you can always turn your TV's volume down or throw it on mute.  The goldfish aquarium recreates a fish tank with a handful of goldfish that go back and forth on your television screen.  You'll be able to hear the water and filter going: the visuals and sounds make for a nice comforting combination.The mountainside stream is very relaxing, but it's a change of pace from the other two environments.  It doesn't turn your screen into anything (so to speak), but it offers a fixed shot of running water in a wooded area.  It's a pleasant show to look at, and because the water runs by pretty quickly, you can hear the splash and bubble of an active river.If you're ever wanted an aquarium, the Aquarium For Your Home DVD is a reasonable alternative.
