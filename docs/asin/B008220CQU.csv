Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are young police officers who bust a drug cache and make enemies south of the border. David Ayer has been writing about crooked cops for a while, he wrote Training Day and Harsh times about corrupt cops on the verge of insanity. However in this film, the cops are actually heroes - they are green, clean and brave. Brian Taylor (Gylenhall) and Mike ( Mike Zavala) are best friends and honest police officers. They love each other , their families and are brothers in every sense of the way. On their daily watch, they investigate different cases some involving fires, burglaries and warfare between black and hispanic gangs. Most of the footage in the film is found footage apparently on a camera that Taylor loves to carry with him through the film.

Add to that the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal is NOT a name that evokes any confidence in me as of late and you had this film that I didn't care if I saw or not.  Despite the acclaim it got and the great ink for the central performances and the critics and audiences reacting so favorably, I seriously had no interest in seeing this; at all.  So, to say that the biggest shock for me this year was my actual adoration of the film (and of Gyllenhaal's magnificent performance) would not be an understatement.  This movie was really, really good.Sharply written, edgy, steeped in a really slick sense of comradery and anchored by two beautifully fleshed out performances; `End of Watch' will keep you glued to every frame.The film is shot almost like a documentary, utilizing gritty camera angles to bolster audience reaction.  It follows the relationship between two cops, Brian and Mike.  They are reckless and childish and yet devoted to their jobs and the responsibility they have towards the people depending on them.  They joke around, indulge in inappropriate talk and bicker like kids, yet at the end of the day they are brothers at heart and are truly stand up guys.  As the film progresses we see them push themselves in order to get more out of their jobs.  They follow up on leads, do their own investigating and uncover some serious stuff.  In the meantime, they agitate some local deviants who don't take their intrusiveness lightly.Gyllenhaal and Pena make a great team here.  They capture every layer of these men and have an infectious chemistry with one another.  The rest of the cast is certainly up to par, but these two men form a great foundation for the film itself.It's a great change of pace for the average cop film.

1543961,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B008220CQU,"Been around this block, several times over","[1, 2]","Let me start out by saying in words what the four stars illustrate: I GENERALLY LIKED THIS FILM !!!!A commitment was made to use-- and perhaps it might even be fair to say OVERUSE-- the hand-held camera technique to give the film an edgy quality . . . yes, that's obviously true.  More to the point, however, it populated it's star roles with what seemed the enactment of truly believable personalities.  And, that these characters were doomed from the beginning, this did not emerge suddenly and irrevocably, but rather slowly and in a way calculated to get you to forget about it even after you were plainly warned to expect that.Having done street gang work myself, I was never able to forget about it at any time I was out there, because under those circumstances, if someone suggests to you JUST ONCE that you have somehow stepped into a special hair-trigger gun site, you never forget about it.  In that setting, it is just too easy to get blown away.  From that point of view, the film's effort to get you to forget about it did at times border on the silly.  Even at the end, for the Hispanic cop to get so wrapped up in the injuries to his partner that his back was an open invitation for the shooters to appear can only be naivite about working the mean streets in the course of a shootout.  No good war movie would suggest that hero figures get lost in fallen comrades in the middle of a firefight action; that occurs later, after the shooting stops and the enemy's whereabouts are accounted for.  But our guy stopped to weep while he was on the run.  It's in spots like that that the film started to get puzzling for me.  Were they willing to fracture reality to tell us how sad the guy was?  Also remember that this is the same guy who held his gun against the inside of the door of his car (out of sight) when he was talking to the Black gang member who was trying to repay him by pulling his coat about there being a contract out on them-- a demonstration of natural cautiousness learned through years of experienced that seemed suddenly to have disappeared. Moreover, professionals who have to work the warring street never react with the sort of bland confusion our heroes displayed to the notion of having a contract out on one's self.  This kind of what seemed slip ups from a Hollywood writer who's not really into that life seemed part of the I-don't-know-why efforts to keep much of the movie light-hearted.  Cops on NIGHT patrol, in particular, talk more about what they see around them as they drive through the streets than constantly distract teach other by blinding kidding with one another.  And, as if to compound the error, after what seemed completion of the film after the funereal, we get a message-- something like, ""earlier that day""-- and we see in morning light our boys-in-blue joking madly with each other in the car.  Uniformed cop's just don't work three consecutive tours (since the shootout occurred at night), and we get the wild laughter rubbed in our face again as a parting shot.  Why?  What was that supposed to mean?  Something came over the radio, but the guffaws made it impossible to hear what that was.  I still don't know what the audience was supposed to get out of that.  It left us with a final sour note, indicative of a strain of unrealistically stupid comic relief that was forced into and throughout the movie.  It's as if the people who made the movie insisted on getting their inner adolescent out by forcing a slightly ""animal house"" refrain throughout the movie.  That is a poor substitute for the kind of strained gallows humor that actually runs among professionals working the streets (what we saw instead in this movie was more the sort of ""hippie-cayay"" of Bruce Willis DIE HARD fame).  I also got the sense that the authors wanted us to see the two cops as somehow set up-- the green vision suggested observation by the ""big"" police authorities (who tried to warn our guys of the risky position they had gotten themselves into when they stumbled over human trafficking), and the way the black-and-whites had arrived so late (compared to all the other times it took so much less time to get there).  But nothing was explicitly  made of any of that.  That too was to me part of the movie's engagement in over-suggestiveness, in an excess of innuendo. JUST TELL THE DAMN STORY without ""vaguely"" suggesting all sorts of ill-fitting subplots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But, as I say, the movie was quite good, and I'm sure that it was because of how overall good it was that I felt so piqued by the silly and (at least to me) inexplicable parts of the movie.  Of course, when I read the one and two star comments, now they amounted to missing the barn wall by a mile.  I never realized people would come to a movie with such childish expectations.  The CONSTANT cursing was probably one of the most realistic things about the movie.  That's what men do in combat-- as well as women who must join them in that threateningly defeminizing context.  When the film showed the beat up woman cop who had become the victim of a man-on-man type crime (her ridding partner had been stabbed in the eye by the same man), that's when the sheer courage of these women-in-a-violent-man's-world came through most brilliantly.  That part of portraying modern sexually-integrated police was well done: constant cursing being the great equalizer for common sharing of extreme dangerousness (both sexes did it in that context).",4,Just what was it I was supposed to get from it?,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,5461,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'words', 'what', 'four', 'stars', 'illustrate', 'GENERALLY', 'LIKED',

The real crime show feel of his ""Training Day"" and ""End of Watch"" movies seem to be his niche because he's real good at it. With his police crime drama's, you don't get the typical Hollywood police movie, you get something that borders on real. You truly feel like you are on the beat in the middle of some of the worst Los Angeles neighborhood's possible.""End of Watch"" introduces us to Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) as they ride in their police cruiser. We see their world from a dash camera and a camera that Taylor carries with him to document his world, or basically to screw around with. I'm not a big fan of shaky-cam movies, but in this situation, it works because it lends to the effect of realism and adds to the tension you feel as they confront their work. Not to mention, the shaky cam isn't all the time, just when needed or it adds to the events.""End of Watch"" is a buddy movie that could be deemed a comedy if you wanted to, although truthfully, it is just real. As the officers ride around we experience real life. We experience what officers who spend day in and day out in a car together talk about. We get to know them this way. We get to know their intelligence, their home lives, their sense of humor and the conversations are frank and honest, just like the violence and the action throughout the film.As we watch Taylor and Zavala's bravery and learn who they are and who they have waiting for them at the end of their days, the events of the film become even more tense. Through a random course of events, they eventually pull the waging tail of a dangerous Mexican drug cartel that has leaked it's way into Southern California. It is at this point that Taylor and Zavala's lives change dramatically and it is the blood and bones of the movie.""End of Watch"" is a new kind of buddy movie and in it, you discover the love and bond that officers in the field have and form for each other. Dealing with extremely dangerous situations is just another day on the job. ""End of Watch"" is a great film, as was ""Training Day"". Both movies showed a grit and realism that took it above the typical buddy cop, crime movie. There's no faking the bond these two officers feel for each other.

Perhaps that is why it did not make a great deal of money in the theaters.  First, I will tell you what I liked about the film.  I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters played by Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal.  Also, the film showed their interaction with their families, Pena has a wife that he obviously loves greatly and Gyllenhaal meets the girl of his dreams and ends up marrying her in the movie.  The intensity of their relationships adds texture to the movie.  Also, Pena's character and his wife have their first child.I did not particularly care for the fact that Gyllenhaal's character was filming everything for a film class that he was taking.  It kind of made things a bit confusing and created a lot of undue tension between the other officers and his character.The film had a truly great amount of violence.  The most violent scene showed another officer getting stabbed in the eye.  Perhaps the violence did further the plot but it was really graphic.  There was also a scene of a woman being raped that was graphic as well.There are many stereotypes in the movie, but that just may be the way things are in Los Angeles.  The police in the movie are mostly white and they are trying to keep the neighborhoods around them from blowing up everyday.  Drugs are prevalent and guns are readily available to everyone.  As a matter of fact, it seems in this film, that the people on the streets, have more weapons than the police and of course, they also outnumber the officers.  This makes for continuing tension and some give and take between the street people and the authorities.The police are quick to honor the work that they do with awards and commendations. The characters are portrayed as heroes but one of them has to give up his life for the cause.All in all, I enjoyed the movie but I would caution others that if they feel squeamish about blood and gore, they should skip this movie.",3,A Gritty Near Documentary About Two L.

1543995,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008220CQU,C. Sawin,"[5, 8]","It seems like David Ayer has been making the same film over and over again since ""Training Day,"" doesn't it? While he didn't direct ""Training Day,"" every film he's directed since then has revolved around South Central and/or the LAPD. The intriguing aspect though is that Ayer tweaks a few things here and there to make whatever is his most recent film a bit stronger and a bit better than his previous works despite being similar in story and execution. ""End of Watch"" is certainly his strongest effort, but comes up short when it tries to jump into superb territory.Two LAPD police officers, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena), are partners and best friends. They're put on the fast track to success after they handle a car chase that ends in shots being fired completely by the book. Despite their constant joking and the way they kind of strut around the precinct, their job is extremely dangerous and everyone around them does their best to remind them of that. A routine stakeout turns out to be so much more when they find a pot of soup filled with stacks of cash along with a bejewelled pistol and a golden AK-47. The Mexican cartel are in Los Angeles and Brian and Mike have to watch where they step before they bite off more than they can chew.""End of Watch"" is filmed almost entirely in that handheld and almost documentary type of camera perspective. Gyllenhaal and Pena wear cameras on their pockets the entire time while Gyllenhaal carries around a camera. It isn't quite as shaky or as bad as you may think, but it's basically a slightly more HD step above what you'd see on ""Cops."" Considering the content of the film, it actually feels like it's throwing you right into the action which is more than likely the intent of the style. But it may still give you motion sickness if you've had issues with it in the past.The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena carries the film; their constant ribbing of one another and the way they confide in one another really makes it seem like their bond runs deep. Their friendship is built to pull you in for something that happens later on and even though you sense that coming a mile away the event still hits you like a bag of bricks when it finally does happen.It almost seems like ""End of Watch"" starts off very lighthearted and slowly snowballs into something darker and grittier before completely pulling the rug out from underneath you in its final moments. It begins with Brian and Mike constantly joking around and each call they have gets more and more serious. They're dealing with gang wars, but they spend their down time discussing the type of women they want to be with or telling ridiculous stories. Then they get the call to find the missing children, follow the lead on the guy that pulls a gun out on Mike after they pull him over, offer assistance to Van Hauser (David Harbour) and his partner, and eventually get baited into following that van that runs a red light. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of the shotgun cam perspective as it's incredibly effective and pretty awesome.""End of Watch"" contains a lot more moments that take your breath away or attempt to shock you than Ayer's other works. The scene with the house that's on fire is incredibly difficult to watch as is the Van Hauser rescue and the minivan tail. The film seems to chicken out at the end though. It has you in the palm of its hand and is all set to end on a really disheartening note, but then backtracks and has you laughing as you exit the theater. It makes sense as most people want to leave a film on a high note, but speaking as someone who thrives on edgier filmmaking and depressing conclusions the action drama kind of loses its nerve at the last minute and goes with something light and fluffy instead of something heavy and contemplative.""End of Watch"" pushes boundaries, is extremely gritty, and has this sense of realism that isn't usually found in films like this. The chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena is also incredibly strong, but the film almost seems to lose its testicles in its closing moments. It spends all this time showing you edgy content and pushing you towards the edge of your seat and then just kind of delivers this lukewarm conclusion even though it had all of the elements of leaving you with something great. Something that may get overlooked that you should keep an eye out for is Frank Grillo's performance. He has so little screen time, but has one scene with a huge amount of emotional impact.""End of Watch"" is an impressive action drama and easily David Ayer's most impressive film to date, but just loses its momentum in its final act to keep it from being really, really good.",3,"Feels genuine, but is mostly more of the same from David Ayer",1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,4716,"['David', 'Ayer', 'been', 'making', 'same', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'Training', 'Day', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'Training', 'Day', 'film', 'directed', 'then', 'revolved', 'South', 'Central', 'LAPD', 'intriguing', 'aspect', 'though', 'Ayer', 'few', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'make', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'bit', 'stronger', 'bit', 'better', 'previous', 'works', 'being', 'similar', 'story', 'execution', 'End', 'Watch', 'certainly', 'strongest', 'effort', 'up', 'short', 'when', 'jump', 'superb', 'territory.Two', 'LAPD', 'police', 'officers', 'Brian', 'Taylor', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Mike', 'Zavala', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'are', 'partners', 'best', 'friends', ""'re"", 'put', 'fast', 'track', 'success', 'handle', 'car', 'chase', 'shots', 'being', 'fired', 'completely', 'book', 'constant', 'joking', 'way', 'kind', 'strut', 'precinct', 'job', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'everyone', 'best', 'remind', 'routine', 'stakeout', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'when', 'find', 'pot', 'soup', 'filled', 'stacks', 'cash', 'bejewelled', 'pistol', 'golden', 'AK-47', 'Mexican', 'cartel', 'are', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Brian', 'Mike', 'have', 'watch', 'where', 'step', 'bite', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'End', 'Watch', 'filmed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'handheld', 'almost', 'documentary', 'type', 'camera', 'perspective', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Pena', 'wear', 'cameras', 'pockets', 'entire', 'time', 'Gyllenhaal', 'camera', ""n't"", 'quite', 'shaky', 'as', 'bad', 'may', 'think', 'basically', 'slightly', 'more', 'HD', 'step', 'what', ""'d"", 'see', 'Cops', 'Considering', 'content', 'film', 'actually', 'throwing', 'right', 'action', 'more', 'likely', 'intent', 'style', 'may', 'still', 'give', 'motion', 'sickness', ""'ve"", 'had', 'issues', 'past.The', 'chemistry', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Pena', 'film', 'constant', 'ribbing', 'one', 'way', 'confide', 'one', 'really', 'seem', 'bond', 'deep', 'friendship', 'built', 'pull', 'something', 'later', 'even', 'sense', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'event', 'still', 'bag', 'bricks', 'when', 'finally', 'happen.It', 'almost', 'End', 'Watch', 'off', 'very', 'lighthearted', 'slowly', 'snowballs', 'something', 'darker', 'grittier', 'completely', 'pulling', 'rug', 'underneath', 'final', 'moments', 'Brian', 'Mike', 'constantly', 'joking', 'around', 'call', 'have', 'more', 'more', 'serious', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'gang', 'wars', 'spend', 'down', 'time', 'discussing', 'type', 'women', 'want', 'be', 'telling', 'ridiculous', 'stories', 'Then', 'get', 'call', 'find', 'missing', 'children', 'follow', 'lead', 'guy', 'gun', 'out', 'Mike', 'pull', 'offer', 'assistance', 'Van', 'Hauser', 'David', 'Harbour', 'partner', 'eventually', 'get', 'baited', 'following', 'van', 'red', 'light', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'more', 'shotgun', 'cam', 'perspective', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'End', 'Watch', 'lot', 'more', 'moments', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'attempt', 'shock', 'Ayer', 'other', 'works', 'scene', 'house', 'fire', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Van', 'Hauser', 'rescue', 'minivan', 'tail', 'film', 'chicken', 'out', 'end', 'palm', 'hand', 'set', 'end', 'really', 'disheartening', 'note', 'then', 'backtracks', 'laughing', 'exit', 'theater', 'sense', 'most', 'people', 'want', 'leave', 'film', 'high', 'note', 'speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'edgier', 'filmmaking', 'depressing', 'conclusions', 'action', 'drama', 'kind', 'nerve', 'last', 'minute', 'something', 'light', 'fluffy', 'instead', 'something', 'heavy', 'contemplative', 'End', 'Watch', 'boundaries', 'extremely', 'gritty', 'sense', 'realism', ""n't"", 'usually', 'found', 'films', 'chemistry', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'also', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'film', 'almost', 'lose', 'testicles', 'closing', 'moments', 'time', 'showing', 'edgy', 'content', 'pushing', 'towards', 'edge', 'seat', 'then', 'just', 'kind', 'delivers', 'lukewarm', 'conclusion', 'even', 'had', 'elements', 'leaving', 'something', 'great', 'Something', 'may', 'get', 'overlooked', 'should', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'Frank', 'Grillo', 'performance', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'one', 'scene', 'huge', 'amount', 'emotional', 'impact', 'End', 'Watch', 'impressive', 'action', 'drama', 'easily', 'David', 'Ayer', 'most', 'impressive', 'film', 'date', 'just', 'momentum', 'final', 'act', 'keep', 'being', 'really', 'really', 'good']",End of Watch

There's also racist jokes told between the officers jabbing at each other but I didn't find anything offensive and only humorous.End of Watch is about two young Los Angeles police officers who stumble upon secrets of the Mexican drug cartel which leads them to become the cartel's targets. The leading roles are Officer Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Officer Mike Zavala (Michael Pena), who are partners in the LAPD. The villains of the movie come off as very evil, hateful people. One is even named 'Big Evil' because, well, as he put it, ""my evil is big.""Although this film is directed by the same man who did 'Training Day', it is nothing like that movie. This film led by Gyllenhaal and Pena shows qualities, between the two, that every officer should have; those being courage, loyalty, and integrity. There is no dirtiness or crookedness about them like with Denzel Washington in 'Training Day'. They are honorable and dedicated to their job and loyal to one another, you can feel the sense of brotherhood between them. I felt like both actors did exceptionally well and gave a realistic/ natural performance. Prior to seeing this I wasn't a Jake Gyllenhaal fan but he won me over in this performance.Throughout the movie you'll see them at the barracks, on the job, and off duty within their personal lives in an attempt to make you feel connected with them on a personal level. The majority of the film is shot from a first person perspective which allows you to see things not only from Officer Zavala and Taylor's POV but also the gang members POV. Different ways the film is recorded include cameras attached to each officer's shirt, handheld camcorders, a dash cam etc. I found it interesting but some people will not like this filming style at all.I'll be completely honest this movie is a tear jerker and it's also one of my all time favorite movies.

That motto was given new resonance years later in Dennis Hopper's underrated ""Colors"".  I didn't think anything new could be added to the cop movie drama and for the most part director-writer David Ayer succeeds in infusing a time tested genre with something fresh.  He does so by employing documentary style techniques such as hand held cameras that make you feel like you are in the car with real police officers.  For instance you think you are following the daily grind of Officer Brian Taylor and his partner Miguel Zavala instead of actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena.  Some have taken issue with the profane exchanges between the two which give  new definition to the term L.A.P.D. Blue and admittedly I found a tad excessive.  People curse Mr. Ayer.  We get the point.  Also, I thought the main subplot of a Mexican drug cartel putting a contract on the two a bit farfetched.

Jake Gyllenhaal was surprisingly good in the role as a cop. I would not have expected that prior to seeing the movie. Michael Pena did an outstanding job as well and he aced the back-and-forth insults/jokes that takes place between officers. They must have hung around some urban cops as part of their research for the roles.If you don't enjoy cop movies you might not ""get"" this comparison, but I put End of Watch as most similar to Narc (an very underappreciated cop movie). I am not talking about the storyline, but rather the directing, the general tone of the movie, and how it call came together. Simlar to 95+% of cop movies, you have to allow the director a LOT of suspended reality. Some of the absurdities are what make the movie interesting to watch.

The movie may have been made by the same people that brought us Training Day but there is no comparison as to the quality of the movies.This movie is seemingly a rah rah propaganda piece on the selfless all giving that police officers all supposedly lay on the line to help keep us all safe and secure. Reality is a different story. Police officers are nothing more than after the fact data collection clerks. There are VERY few crimes that police personnel prevent, very few. Mop up is about all they do and they get paid way too much for what they do. Are there casualties? Certainly. The same can be said for every other public employee involved in any physical activity. Garbagemen get injured far more frequently than police officers for example.The majority of a police officers time is involved in the very dangerous intervention in domestic disputes. That is one ""plus"" that the police are indeed needed for. Far too often policemens duty involves drug related offenses. These are generally victimless crimes, and yes I know the general retort about the damage done to the user. That is what God called ""free will"". The ongoing and never ending ""war on drugs"" has caused far more physical and property damage than the effects of the gamut of drugs out there ever would have.Do I feel sorry for police officers? Not at all. They made the choice when they applied. Many applicants can do little else that pays anywhere near what a policemans salary does. Far too many police officers abuse the power granted to them. Abuses which are very seldom addressed. When was the last time you heard of a policeman actually being punished for a ""questionable use of force""? Rarely.This movie is another flick shot by way of the ""Blair Witch Method"". PLEASE, lay off the hand held amatuerish technique. It is overused and covers a lack of real film making technique.Didnt like the movie at all, have no sympathy for police officers and would really like to return to the days when directors really had to do their job. Enough already with the shaky, handheld video B.S.. Also, please give some thought to saving some of the billions this country annually spends on the failed war on drugs.

It's a brutally realistic, super-violent, and gory film that, miraculously, shows just enough to avoid being cheaply gratuitous in any of these respects. While it's not Gyllenhaal's finest role, he's still quite good here as Officer Brian Taylor, and the acting in general is likewise. Many of the gangster-actors (some of whom apparently came from the background shown in this film) give especially strong performances.Taylor and his partner (similarly well-played by Michael Pe&ntilde;a) encounter violent rival gangs, drug cartels, house fires, mass murder, and human trafficking rings in an unusually rough section of South Central LA. The not-so-subtle hints that the top echelons of the LAPD (along with certain federal agencies) are bedfellows in some of the gangs' most appalling activities add an interesting twist. While the storyline is not perfect--e.g., some of the gangsters are amazingly bad shots --END of WATCH is better than any other film I've seen that portrays urban cops as soldiers in enemy territory. The two lead characters' family lives are also realistically shown, along with the sometimes friendly, sometimes not-so-friendly camaraderie and politics within the police division.

Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his partner Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) run a black and white in South Central L.A.. Brian is former military and recording video of their day to day on the job. He's obviously too smart for the job and will probably move up to detective. He has a great relationship with his partner Zavala. They can rib each other endlessly without taking offence. Most days are run of the mill, but they run into some situations that are awful and terrifying. What makes these situations so horror filled is that they are true to life. One thread begins to unravel a sweater too large for them to handle and it leads to a violent conclusion.What little I read of the movie before going in did not prepare me for what I was about to see. I expected more of a traditionally filmed narrative with a well written script and an A to B to C plot-line. Nope. What I got was all hand-held camera with nearly no plot-line at all. This is a slice o' lifer through and through. You do not feel as though you are watching a film. It's more as though you're with them on their daily routine. There is an immediacy to it all. You are seeing what they are seeing when they see it and at times it's unsettling. There are a lot of crazy, mean, degenerates out there that are drug heads, gang-bangers, and people who deal in the worst of businesses. These cops come across them in their day to day and you wonder how they keep their heads on straight. You come to love and respect these two as the movie rolls on. There were some nice touches as well. When you meet Gyllenhaal's girlfriend/fiance (Anna Kendrick) she's a hoot.  She has a masters degree in fluid dynamics but she's not a stick in the mud. She gets down, and when the two of them perform their dance routine at their wedding, it's something to see.I cannot say I'm the biggest fan of the police. I'm sure there is little doubt that some of the ills in society could not exist without their help. There are a lot of bad cops out there but here you get to see two guys who are just ""on the job"" and the stuff they have to put up with. I've gained a whole new respect for the good guys. There are some things that happen in the movie that run into the area of cliche, which is why I haven't given this the big 5 stars, but it has a tremendous amount of impact and will both frighten you and, at times, make your skin crawl. At a reported $7,000,000.00 budget the end far outweighs the dollars put in. If you're at all disposed to this kind of film, put this on your list.

This police drama is about the lives of two young police officers, on-and-off the streets of danger and crime. We follow Brian and Mike as the calls come in to the scenes of different situations. We are introduced to the risk good-clean police-officers must face on an everyday basis, the close encounters to putting their lives on the line, and how easy it is for them to become a victim. The viewer follows the calls to constant danger, regardless of the reason. It could be drugs, or any number of violent-evil scenes in which the two officers must also protect each other. The theme is the value of friendship, a bond between the officer and his partner, and the inside scenes of what type of life they live and how it could affect personal lives.

1544059,A328S9RN3U5M68,B008220CQU,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","David Ayer does not shy away from raw stories.  He is a facile writer and edgy director responsible for such impressive films as Harsh Times, Street Kings, Training Day, S.W.A.T., The Fast and the Furious, Dark Blue and Ten.  In END OF WATCH he steps into another arena of manipulating the camera technique to emphasize not only the speed with which the LAPD must react but also the in-between moments when boredom bonds officers tightly and some hilarious buddy talk is born. What he achieves in END OF WATCH is probably the most realistic (albeit heinously gory and terrifying) footage of what cops do and how they live and survive in a series of incidents that boggle the mind.Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) are cop partners who do their job in a amazingly skillful manner and at the same time demonstrate that they have formed a brotherly bond that makes us identify with them immediately: Brian learns the ins and outs of marriage from Mike who is completely committed to this wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) and Mike encourages Brian to commit to a relationship with his current love Janet (Anna Kendrick). In the midst of all of this bonding the two officers deal with car chases, child endangerment, drug cartels, human trafficking, and a horrendous confrontation with a Mexican drug cartel gang that leads to a brutal end to the story.To capture the immediacy of both the good and bad aspects of the endangered lives of Brian and Mike the entire film is shot with hand held cameras, and surveillance cameras -a technique that director Ayers even endears his audience by having Brian be an addict to hand held cameras shooting the fun parts of their lives as well as the terrifying parts. The dialogue sounds spontaneous and is overwhelmed by expletives that in previous years would have been bleeped, but now with social media absorbing everyone's life the words are simply common language and keep the story real.Gyllenhaal again serves notice that he is one of our more gifted actors on the screen today and Michael Pe&ntilde;a's performance is so astonishing fine that it is Oscar worthy as Supporting Actor.  The other LAPD personnel given screen time include excellent portrayals by David Harbour, Frank Grillo, America Ferrera, and Cody Horn.  Both Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez are strong as are the actors who portray the gangsters.The technique shooting this film, the dialogue, and the incessant picturing of horrendous scenes may be off putting to some, but it is good to see good cops doing what they do best - place their lives on the line to protect the citizenry. In all this is an outstanding film.

1544066,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008220CQU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Every decade or so we get treated to a cop film so gritty and hard-core it leaves an indelible mark on our pop culture consciousness. In the 1970s it wasThe French Connection. In the '80s,Colors. In the '90s,L.A. Confidential. In the early oughts,Training Day(I guessHot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)doesn't count, huh?). Heck, you can even go as far back as the 1940s and my pick would be Akira Kurosawa'sStray Dog (The Criterion Collection). In the 2010s it's this one.Today the barbershop chatter revolved around the best cinematic pairing of 2013, and I had a horse in the race. In END OF WATCH Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe&ntilde;a burrow into the skins of their characters so impressively, their characters present a friendship that feels so natural and vibes so organically, it punches you in the gut to watch the harrowing stuff they go thru deep into the film. END OF WATCH comes with bells and whistles. Writer/director David Ayer, whose dramatis personae habitually haunt L.A.'s grimy underbelly, flirts with the conceit of the found footage film but doesn't stay faithful to it. Still, there's a sense of immediacy whenever we're getting those first person perspectives, via assorted surveillance cameras, dash cams, cell phone cams, and those tiny Scorpion cameras the police pin on their uniform to record incidents. Ayer maintains a firm command of tone and pace, stringing you along and stringing you along and then sometimes pulling the rug out from under you.The film observes the daily grind of two LAPD patrol officers and partners, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pe&ntilde;a), as they try to keep the peace in South Central Los Angeles. The trailer fools you into thinking this is a straight-up, ba11s-to-the-wall cop thriller, but you got played. Yep, there are moments of abrupt violence sprinkled in when Taylor and Zavala spring into action, but there isn't a sustained thru arc in which they're on the run from the Mexican drug cartel. Mostly, END OF WATCH unfolds in leisurely, episodic fashion, with Taylor and Zavala responding to calls ranging from the mundane to the ridiculous to situations that occasionally do end up going sideways.Gracing the film are these character-building intervals that lend texture and depth and give us a peek into what's relevant in their personal lives (Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez are marvelous as their respective love interests). What the trailer also doesn't disclose is how funny the movie is. Gyllenhaal and Pe&ntilde;a muster up an incredible chemistry. Much of the humor stems from their naturalistic dialogue, ""naturalistic"" maybe because much of it was ad-libbed between them. The off-the-cuff patter, the smooth rhythms of their interplay provide many of the high points. It's almost impossible not to care for these guys. And when they get so successful with their street busts in ""Shootin' Newton"" that, in the third act, the Mexican drug cartel has no choice but to put a bounty on them, by then, you are firmly invested and very concerned and biting your nails. This deserves to be seen. It is visceral. It is moving. It is a slice of life. It puts you behind the scenes and in the front line with L.A.'s finest. END OF WATCH is one of those rare cop movies that doesn't exploit the badge but genuinely honors it. I was so taken by Gyllenhaal's opening voiceover monologue, I had to write it down. Boy, that was a lot of rewinding and playing back on the DVD, but worth it:""I am the police, and I'm here to arrest you. You've broken the law. I did not write the law. I may disagree with the law but I will enforce it. No matter how you plead, cajole, beg or attempt to stir my sympathy. Nothing you do will stop me from placing you in a steel cage with gray bars. If you run away I will chase you. If you fight me I will fight back. If you shoot at me I will shoot back. By law I am unable to walk away. I am a consequence. I am the unpaid bill. I am fate with a badge and a gun. Behind my badge is a heart like yours. I bleed, I think, I love, and yes I can be killed. And although I am but one man, I have thousands of brothers and sisters who are the same as me. They will lay down their lives for me and I them. We stand watch together. The thin-blue-line, protecting the prey from the predators, the good from the bad.

They are easy to believe as good friends, partners and cop buddies and certainly the dialog lends itself to creating an authentic relationship between the two.Unfortunately, the amateur-cam filming style is distracting and unnecessary and not even consistent throughout. It's never explained why all these separate parties are carrying video cameras and in certain scenes they revert back to an unknown third party camera presumably because they couldn't figure out how to put a camera in the scene (who's filming Gyllenhaal and Kendrick's love scenes?). All in all, it would have been a better film to shoot in a traditional way without having this distraction.The main plot is slow to start too. The first act is spent showing what great cops our duo are and while we get to witness some exciting action, when the bad guys decide to take them down, it all feels very rushed.

I really enjoyed Training Day, which director, David Ayer produced. So I figured End of Watch was going to be of the same ilk. Not so. Let's count 'em down:1. PRESENTATION: While the whole shaky camera thing was effective in some parts and quite nifty in others, on the whole, it became rather annoying, especially during the fight scenes. I mean, really? Someone in a brutal fight was holding a camera? I know that if I was in one of those confrontations, I would want BOTH of my hands. Just sayin'!2. DIRECTION: Considering the use of documentary-style filming, it was done quite well; cameras were literally everywhere. It must have been quite an uptaking for the editing department. Even though Mr. Ayer wrote the script, he didn't give himself much to work with. It took a long time before I could determine where the story was going ... close to 45 minutes. That's almost half the movie--ridiculous.3. ACTING: As everyone has noted in other reviews, the camaraderie and chemistry of the two leads was exceptional, some of it a bit tongue-in-cheek and ambiguous, but exceptional, nonetheless. The cartel members, especially ""Bad Evil"" and his girlfriend were WAY over-the-top with WAY too much overplay. I have been around people like that, and no one, NO ONE, says the F-Bomb that frequently. Sure, it comes up, but not with every other word as depicted here. The only time I have truly witnessed that type of repetitiveness concerning profane words in a purposeful situation was at a George Carlin concert back in the '80s.4. STORY: Weak, at best. As already alluded to, the story really didn't get going until the middle of Act 2. There was simply way to much time focused on back-story. It could have been presented in such a way that would speed up the whole ""get the audience to care about these characters"" process. That would have freed up more time to allow a more expansive focus on the primary narrative.5. OVERALL: Overrated. This movie is on par with being nothing more than a good episode of Southland. It is on par with every other ho-hum, so-so cop movie. Not bad, but not great. I liked some parts, and I had to suspend my belief system for others.

1544120,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B008220CQU,J. Richardson,"[0, 1]","Well color me impressed. Out of all the movies I've seen recently this was the one I was expecting to let me down. On the contrary, it was exactly what I was looking for and then some. End of Watch was a thrill ride from start to finish and I honestly couldn't have asked for anything more.End of Watch follows the story of two policemen, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) & Mike Zava (Michael Pena), as they do police work (shocking). The film opens with Brian and Mike in the middle of a chase while Gyllenhaal gives us some spiel about policemen and how they're important to keeping order, yada yada yada. The beginning of the film also shows off what I think is this film's biggest fault: the way it was filmed.As you watch End of Watch you'll see the camera switch from regular, steady recording to that of a home movie. This is because Brian is taking a film class and he's recording police activities for a project he's working on. Now this wouldn't be a big problem if it would have stayed within the police work, but it doesn't. Almost every scene has at least one person with a damn camera so this recording style follows you throughout the entire hour and 40 minutes. The Mexican gang had a video camera (because that makes sense), Brian carried the camera to a quinceanera, during his wedding someone had a camera, I mean it just never stops.With that said, I'm pretty impressed that this is the film's only fault. One of its biggest achievements, on the other hand, has to be just how well the story is written. I mean it is intense. It does a great job of sucking you in and keeping your attention throughout the entire thing. What's even better is that it's filled with characters that you both like and care for. You don't want to see Brian or Mike get hurt, you want them to succeed in whatever crazy task they accept while on the job, and you want to see their relationships work out. Sadly, we don't always get what we want as this film proves that not every story has a happy ending.This connection wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for the fantastic performances from Gyllenhaal and Pena. I've only seen these men in a handful of films, but they've given solid performances in everything I've seen from them. With that said, I think Gyllenhaal really stepped up in this and Pena might have given the performance of his career. It's some really powerful stuff and the ending is bound to leave you speechless.On top of the two main guys you have Natalie Martinez and Anna Kendrick playing Gabby (Mike's wife) and Janet (Brian's girlfriend), respectfully. Then you have David Harbour, Frank Grillo, and America Ferrera each playing someone working on the force. In the Mexican gang you have Big Evil played by Maurice Compte and La La played by Yahira Garcia. While I don't think any of these actors had enough screen time to go toe-to-toe with Gyllenhaal and Pena, everyone gave solid performances even if I didn't necessarily like their characters.Overall Score: 9/10 - End of Watch proves to be one of those films that delivers in what it sets out to do. It's not often that I leave a film blown away by what I saw, but End of Watch is one of those films. The story is gripping and the movie is driven forward by some fantastic leads. I'll give you a warning though, this is not for the squeamish. There's a few decapitated heads along with a male officer who has a knife stuck in his eye and a female officer with her face beaten in. If you think you can handle something like that then I can't recommend this movie enough.

The beginning is a very fast cut (quick jumps from scene to scene) that can make your head swim a bit. I like this kind of cinematography but the first 5-10 minutes was extreme. Either I adapted or the editing slowed down.. after that time it didn't bother me.Overall the movie was enjoyable. The comments about language: didn't phase me in this movie. The lack of plot: I don't agree. Its not deep by any stretch but I did feel the movie kept building. I guess what bothered me the most was the unrealistic camera angles thrown in. So both cops have a clip on cam, there is a handheld cam and the gang recorded its own footage. And somehow there was footage found from a Central American cartel. We'll even throw in the cruiser cam footage. So who filmed the rear of the vehicle and focused on the &#34;Interceptor&#34; emblem as both cops pulled up to a scene? This happens too many times during the movie (unrealistic angles) and it distracts from the found film genre that the movie was trying to achieve.Overall, a watchable flick. 3.5 stars out of five. Its not epic. Its not deep. Its not a family film. Its raw and taps into that dark side of life.

1544139,A2EP52TE6GH8OB,B008220CQU,Kevin Millward,"[1, 2]","Let me start by saying I completely changed my opinion of this film by the end of it. About 3 quarters of the way through, I was around a 2.5, but things really pick up in the film toward the end: emotionally and dramatically. There are a few things I really liked about this film, the biggest being the partnership of Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena's characters. Fantastic chemistry here. There's a perfect balance of arguments, ball-busting, and serious conversation to be had here. I feel safe saying this is one of the best buddy-cop match ups EVER. There are quite a few laughs in this movie, which is rare in such a dark film. I liked Anna Kendrick in this (mostly because she is my current Hollywood crush). There was also a healthy balance of work and personal life, which in turn contributed to the great character development in this film. I felt myself REALLY caring about what happens to these characters, which is a rare feeling when you watch as many movies as I do. I was also pleasantly surprised with how emotionally charged this film was, especially at the end. Great performances from Gyllenhaal and Pena make this film good.I won't elaborate on the many reasons why I am so opposed to the ""found footage"" approach, but I will say that one of those reasons is that it is so overused. Project X, Cloverfield, and Paranormal Activity are three films in recent memory that try and fail using this method. This film did a slightly better job at using this technique, but like all ""found footage"" films, I was left feeling dizzy nauseous. That is my biggest issue with this film. This easily could have been one of my favorite films of the year, but the use of this choppy, shaky shooting style takes away from the sophistication of the story. I can see how they were going for the ""Cops"" look, which could've been done better as TV show, but for film, this is a style that shouldn't be used. This also caused issues throughout the film because we were being beat over the head about where cameras were, and there were one too many ""get that camera out of my face"" moments. The documentary style seemed forced, and that definitely hurt the score for this film.In conclusion, if the shaky-cam doesn't bother you, this is a good buddy-cop film that has a serious take on the drug war and is very emotional. Great performances from the leads helps distract you from the aesthetic problems in this film, but you will still leave the theater wishing you watched a ""film"" rather than a bunch of splices of footage.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[1, 2]","End of Watch realistically portrays the reality of cop life on the rough streets of south central LA.It tells the story of two partners Brian (Jake Gyllenhal) and Mike (Michael Pena). At first it appears more like a documentary than a movie, and highlights the camaraderie between officers and rivalry within the dept.The opening scene featuring a high speed chase on a dash cam followed by a fatal encounter is all shot through the single cam with editing. I found this to be quite impressive giving a realistic feel.As the movie progresses it seems driven more by events than by story which I personally found to be a refreshing change from typical cop movies. As it lacks the slick production you typically get in a police procedural it invites us into a more realistic experience.Brian is the more introspective cop who used to be in the Armed Forces, and Michael the more gregarious one. There is great chemistry and humor between these two, as they discuss their dreams, first times and so forth.The story emerges when these two accidentally uncover a human trafficking operation and run foul of a Mexican drug cartel. Brian's curious nature leads him to ignore the advice of a DEA agent and follow up some leads himself, which has potentially fatal consequences for he and his partner.We explore the romantic relationships of these two, one married, the other just beginning a relationship with a girl played by Anna Kendrick (Up in the Air).We explore the interactions with different villains one of whom challenges Mike to put down his weapons and see if he can take him physically. A fight ensues. The ultimate outcome of this fight may save both cops lives.Brian carries a camera with him giving a cops eye view on several scenes. Sometimes this did seem impractical and a little dangerous and unrealistic, and sometimes I did find the shifting between perspectives a little jarring. Later though this does become interesting with the climactic scenes.I think the best way to watch this movie is not to know too much about it in advance and just experience it. I found the experience to be well worthwhile and was thankful to be able to see it while still in theaters. I think though there is little advantage to seeing it in theater compared to waiting for the dvd.It surpassed my expectations and I think it did portray the policemen as flawed but quintessentially good and also heroic.

It's fascinating to see their approaches to different situations. We realize that modern police work requires not just courage and strength, but a vast range of interpersonal and law enforcement skills, social work, and judgment.However, before we are through, &#34;End of Watch&#34; has descended far below the sunny surface of &#34;Adam-12.&#34; Taylor and Zavala work South Central LA, where poverty, drugs and vicious gangs have shredded the social fabric. They inadvertently stumble into a rat's nest of human and drug trafficking that's carried out by a Mexican drug cartel and under investigation by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement.agents. It's gruesome, nasty descent into a crime hell that's not for those with weak stomachs.&#34;End of Watch&#34; is shot mostly with hand-held cameras, which gives the viewer an &#34;in the action&#34; feel but may bother some people. I watched it on my computer screen so it did not annoy me too much, but had I seen it in a theater, I probably would have felt wobbly. The acting by the two leads is very good. The script carries you effectively into the workaday world of cops on a tough beat. But while you get to know and like Taylor and Zavala, this is accomplished in kind of a lazy way--they're honorable guys who love their families and friends and are fighting the good fight. It might have been more interesting if they had been subject to some moral ambiguity. The other problem with the script for me was the incessant F-bombs. I really don't object to &#34;bad language&#34; in movies if it fits the characters and situations (Joe Pesci in &#34;Goodfellas&#34;? No problem), but if you put an F-bomb in almost every sentence, and sometimes more than one per sentence, it starts to feel like monotonous, lazy writing. I heard that writer-director David Ayer finished the script in six days. A little rewriting might have been a good thing.I did not love &#34;End of Watch,&#34; but I liked it and appreciated the insight into the daily grind of police work it afforded.",4,Adam-12 Cruising Into the Heart of Darkness,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,2885,"['Watching', '34', 'End', 'Watch', '34', 'humorous', 'banter', 'LAPD', 'officers', 'Brian', 'Taylor', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Miguel', 'Zavala', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'cruising', 'along', 'patrol', 'car', 'responding', 'dispatch', 'calls', 'radio', 'reminded', 'watching', 'episodes', 'Jack', 'Webb', '34', 'Adam-12', '34', 'TV', 'series', 'mother', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'only', 'full', 'F-bombs', 'entertainment', '34', 'Adam-12', '34', 'portrayed', 'LAPD', 'such', 'favorable', 'light', '34', 'End', 'Watch', '34', ""'m"", 'not', 'aware', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'LAPD', 'full', 'support.Like', '34', 'Adam-12', '34', 'calls', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'respond', 'are', 'goofy', 'are', 'serious', 'tough', 'courageous', 'men', 'enthusiastically', 'embrace', 'often', 'difficult', 'dangerous', 'work', 'fighting', 'crime', 'savings', 'lives', 'revealing', 'deep', 'bonds', 'other', 'civilian', 'families', 'fascinating', 'see', 'approaches', 'different', 'situations', 'realize', 'modern', 'police', 'work', 'not', 'just', 'courage', 'strength', 'vast', 'range', 'interpersonal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'skills', 'social', 'work', 'judgment.However', 'are', '34', 'End', 'Watch', '34', 'descended', 'far', 'sunny', 'surface', '34', 'Adam-12.', '34', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'work', 'South', 'Central', 'LA', 'where', 'poverty', 'drugs', 'vicious', 'gangs', 'have', 'shredded', 'social', 'fabric', 'inadvertently', 'stumble', 'rat', 'nest', 'human', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'carried', 'out', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'cartel', 'investigation', 'federal', 'Immigration', 'Customs', 'Enforcement.agents', 'gruesome', 'nasty', 'descent', 'crime', 'hell', 'not', 'weak', 'stomachs.', '34', 'End', 'Watch', '34', 'shot', 'mostly', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'viewer', '34', 'action', '34', 'feel', 'may', 'bother', 'people', 'watched', 'computer', 'screen', 'did', 'not', 'annoy', 'too', 'much', 'had', 'seen', 'theater', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'wobbly', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'effectively', 'workaday', 'world', 'cops', 'tough', 'beat', 'get', 'know', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'accomplished', 'kind', 'lazy', 'way', ""'re"", 'honorable', 'guys', 'who', 'love', 'families', 'friends', 'are', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'been', 'subject', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'other', 'problem', 'script', 'was', 'incessant', 'F-bombs', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'object', '34', 'bad', 'language', '34', 'movies', 'characters', 'situations', 'Joe', 'Pesci', '34', 'Goodfellas', '34', 'problem', 'put', 'F-bomb', 'almost', 'sentence', 'sometimes', 'more', 'one', 'sentence', 'feel', 'monotonous', 'lazy', 'writing', 'heard', 'writer-director', 'David', 'Ayer', 'finished', 'script', 'six', 'days', 'little', 'rewriting', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'thing.I', 'did', 'not', 'love', '34', 'End', 'Watch', '34', 'liked', 'appreciated', 'insight', 'daily', 'grind', 'police', 'work', 'afforded']",End of Watch

1544185,A1A4BX7D2OY0D4,B008220CQU,Michael Garcia,"[0, 1]","This movie seemed like it would be interesting when it came out, I thought the story would be more interesting and possibly more action, instead its more of a cop buddy drama with some comedy thrown in.  The basic plot is Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are patrol cops working the east L.A. area, responding to dangerous situations and forming a bond in the process.End of Watch comes at a time when we the audience have already seen many, many movies with similar themes.  I suppose that when the producers were making this movie, they thought, we'll make a cop film that doesn't have corruption and just shows them trying to do job.  While I get the concept, the movie consistently felt lacking.  Where I thought there would be suspense and action, instead there's routine scenes of them following/interacting with dangerous gang members, as part of an investigation THEY AREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  They are not corrupt, but they definitely overstep their boundaries.The details of the criminals they're after aren't important, but there's a murder in the movie, both characters find the body report it, but take it further.  They decide to investigate themselves and go find the killers, something left to detectives.  There's one scene where they are hanging out at the house the person was killed it and a superior more or less warns both of them to stay away and don't take it further; of course they are good to not abuse their power and track down the killer themselves.I could only wonder what actual police officers think of this movie.  There's probably some movies that they think are absolutely ridiculous in their premise or the character's actions, but this movie probably has to be one of the of the worst offenders.  Early on Gyllenhall's character carries around a digital video camera around with him, filming other officers and the crime scenes they arrive on; everyone is annoyed with it, but he more or less carries on with this behavior.  I don't believe there's any universe where this scenario would take place.  Gyllenhall plays a wise-ass eager young cop, somebody who is loyal to force, but questions it in a way a slacker-civilian would.  Again, watch the movie and you'll agree with me that the other cops would have beat the s*** out of him for most of his antics on the film.Michael Pena's character is more of the 'straight' man to Gyllenhall's comic-relief.  Again though, you think that there will be something different or unique to these characters or story, but not really, they're relationship is copied from Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon.  The conversations in the car boil down due their differences in marriage and relationships.  Michael Pena's character is married, Gyllenhall is not, and he gives Gyllenhall an interesting piece of advice, ""you're the smartest guy I know, you'll never find the perfect one, just find one thats down to cook for you.""  Thoughtful advice, although it at times feels like I'm watch a tv movie.I gave this me 2 stars because its somewhat entertaining, but not too involving.  There's a scene where the cops are having a morning meeting to talk about writing tickets and you get the sense that at times their job is as useful as a meter maid and the movie at times wants to explore that idea, but it never really goes in that direction.  Instead what were treated to is typical formulaic police drama, without all the excitement.  At one point I thought the two main characters were going to high five.",2,"Average police drama, felt like a recruiting commercial at times",1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,3520,"['movie', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'possibly', 'more', 'action', 'instead', 'more', 'cop', 'buddy', 'drama', 'comedy', 'thrown', 'basic', 'plot', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'are', 'patrol', 'cops', 'working', 'east', 'L.A.', 'area', 'responding', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'forming', 'bond', 'process.End', 'Watch', 'time', 'when', 'audience', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'movies', 'similar', 'themes', 'suppose', 'when', 'producers', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'make', 'cop', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'corruption', 'just', 'trying', 'do', 'job', 'get', 'concept', 'movie', 'consistently', 'felt', 'lacking', 'Where', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'suspense', 'action', 'instead', 'routine', 'scenes', 'following/interacting', 'dangerous', 'gang', 'members', 'part', 'investigation', 'THEY', 'ARE', ""N'T"", 'EVEN', 'SUPPOSED', 'TO', 'BE', 'DOING', 'IN', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'PLACE', 'are', 'not', 'corrupt', 'definitely', 'overstep', 'boundaries.The', 'details', 'criminals', ""'re"", 'are', ""n't"", 'important', 'murder', 'movie', 'characters', 'find', 'body', 'report', 'take', 'further', 'decide', 'investigate', 'go', 'find', 'killers', 'something', 'left', 'detectives', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'hanging', 'out', 'house', 'person', 'was', 'killed', 'superior', 'more', 'less', 'warns', 'stay', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'further', 'course', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'abuse', 'power', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'themselves.I', 'could', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'actual', 'police', 'officers', 'think', 'movie', 'probably', 'movies', 'think', 'are', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'character', 'actions', 'movie', 'probably', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'offenders', 'Early', 'Gyllenhall', 'character', 'digital', 'video', 'camera', 'filming', 'other', 'officers', 'crime', 'arrive', 'everyone', 'annoyed', 'more', 'less', 'behavior', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'universe', 'where', 'scenario', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'Gyllenhall', 'wise-ass', 'eager', 'young', 'cop', 'somebody', 'who', 'loyal', 'force', 'questions', 'way', 'slacker-civilian', 'would', 'Again', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'other', 'cops', 'would', 'have', 'beat', 's***', 'most', 'antics', 'film.Michael', 'Pena', 'character', 'more', ""'straight"", 'man', 'Gyllenhall', 'comic-relief', 'Again', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'different', 'unique', 'characters', 'story', 'not', 'really', ""'re"", 'relationship', 'copied', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'conversations', 'car', 'boil', 'due', 'differences', 'marriage', 'relationships', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'character', 'married', 'Gyllenhall', 'not', 'Gyllenhall', 'interesting', 'piece', 'advice', ""'re"", 'smartest', 'guy', 'know', ""'ll"", 'never', 'find', 'perfect', 'one', 'just', 'find', 'one', 'down', 'cook', 'Thoughtful', 'advice', 'times', 'feels', ""'m"", 'watch', 'tv', 'movie.I', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'not', 'too', 'involving', 'scene', 'where', 'cops', 'are', 'having', 'morning', 'meeting', 'talk', 'writing', 'tickets', 'get', 'sense', 'times', 'job', 'as', 'useful', 'meter', 'maid', 'movie', 'times', 'explore', 'idea', 'never', 'really', 'direction', 'Instead', 'what', 'were', 'treated', 'typical', 'formulaic', 'police', 'drama', 'excitement', 'one', 'point', 'thought', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'going', 'high', 'five']",End of Watch

Shot in the overused ""found footage"" style, we get a tension filled action drama with excellent character development and sense of realism.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena give memorable performances as partners who are also best friends and confidants, each inviting the other into their extended families.Officers Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Pena) are hot shot cops who want to do more than make traffic arrests while patrolling a mixed gang section of L. A.  Sometimes heroic (rescuing children from a burning house or from an abusive home) and sometimes foolish (not waiting for backup) they manage to stumble upon an arm of a Mexican cartel involved in human trafficking.  Taylor is filming everything as a project for a class he is taking at a local college.  In addition to using a small traditional HD camera, he attaches mini cameras to himself and his partner.  The squad car is also enhanced with an inward focused camera in addition to the normal outbound dash-cam.This works most of the time.  The trick works best when it captures the two cops in their car talking to each other.  We get a real sense of their camaraderie and brotherly love for each other.  It also works well when they enter homes and buildings.  When we only get to see what they are seeing, there is a true sense of dread and concern.  The effect doesn't always work however.  Doesn't it seem a bit unusual to see a co-ed cluster of gang-bangers also shooting footage?  For what, their trial?  In the most flagrant use of the home video, who is taking those midrange shots of the cops while they chit chat in a convenience store?

Their lives become chaotic when they stumble upon a human smuggling ring which in turn makes them the targets of a very deadly mexican drug cartel.

The acting was excellent by all of those involved especially the two performances of Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhall [these two guys need to be nominated for oscars next year]. I also love how this movie has a great sense of humor throughout without it taking away from the overall feel of the movie. Over the course of the movie, You really begin to like and appreciate the efforts of the two main characters to fight crime in one of the most dangerous cities in America as the many scenes of the two main characters conversing in their squad car really provide some of the most entertaining scenes of the movie [as well as some of the funniest]. Also, the comedic scenes really do prepare your heart for the more disturbing events that occur as the film progresses [trust me, things get very ugly in the second half of the movie].

1544230,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B008220CQU,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[2, 3]","End of Watch is a forgettable title for a film which tries tremendously hard to be something more than it is: namely, a one-dimensional cop-buddy movie. Director David Ayer throws all sorts of modern lo-fi tricks at the screen to hustle up an authentic gritty vibe and achieves it, but then lets himself down with an orthodox and ultimately unambitious screenplay beset with cartoon villainy. The result is still an entertaining couple of hours, supported by strong performances from both leads and the supporting cast.Set in South Central Los Angeles, officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) are harness bulls with the LAPD who have a penchant for stumbling into situations beyond their pay grade: while Sarge (Frank Grillo) constantly exhorts them to be out there writing tickets, the boys can't help themselves: an opening sequence shows them pursuing then (justifiably) shooting dead armed offenders, and later, even a casual check in on a missing old lady turns up a huge cocaine shipment, a people smuggling operation and a mass of tortured and murdered immigrants.Cinema v&eacute;rit&eacute; is provided courtesy of a filming style which you'll love or hate: being an aspiring amateur filmmaker, Taylor carries about his person several product-placed Canon handycams and about four ""flip"" recorders, and so we mostly watch early exchanges through his own, and jerky, erratic camera work. When the camera needs to be still to dispatch with plot exposition and character establishment, the director contrives to mounted it on the dash of the boys' Black & White, and is not averse splicing in to aerial shots and other conventional cinematic frames, somewhat giving the lie to the ""found footage"" intent. In any case, after a nauseating ten minute spell at the beginning, the framing does settle down a bit.Now it is one thing having an aspiring film school police officer toting a camera World's-Scariest-Police-Chases style: it is another for the criminals he's pursuing to do the same thing. Both the not-so-bad African American gang and the baaad Mexican gang are obliged by this filming decision to be also compulsively filming themselves as they go about their gangster business. For a film which takes so many cues in its dialogue and attitude from The Wire, it well and truly missed this one: there's no way Omar or the boy Marlo would be seen dead on handycam; least of all in flagrante delicto shooting up the neighbourhood.Things trundle on: in candid in in-car conversations we better get to know the boys, who reveal themselves to be good, well-intentioned lads, if crime-prone, and with loving families, and or at least designs on them. And then, without really the dramatic impetus to suggest it, suddenly everything goes wrong. It seems the really, really baaaaaaad dudes down in Mexico are finally sick of these troublesome priests, and resolve through their local agents to do something about it: We have arrived at the final reel. Ayer does not disappoint, although he does then tack on a bizarre coda after the action is complete that I can't fathom, other than as a means of providing a stronger up-beat to the finale.This is an entertaining but, at its extremities, slightly potty film. Performances from the leads are all strong - Gyllenhaal and Pe&ntilde;a are excellent, but cracks are visible in its heavy reliance on style, and weakly scripted villains.Olly Buxton",4,Style overcomes substance in an entertaining match,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,3423,"['End', 'Watch', 'forgettable', 'title', 'film', 'tremendously', 'hard', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'namely', 'one-dimensional', 'cop-buddy', 'movie', 'Director', 'David', 'Ayer', 'sorts', 'modern', 'lo-fi', 'tricks', 'screen', 'hustle', 'up', 'authentic', 'gritty', 'vibe', 'then', 'down', 'orthodox', 'ultimately', 'unambitious', 'screenplay', 'beset', 'cartoon', 'villainy', 'result', 'still', 'entertaining', 'couple', 'hours', 'supported', 'strong', 'performances', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast.Set', 'South', 'Central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'officers', 'Taylor', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Zavala', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'are', 'harness', 'bulls', 'LAPD', 'who', 'have', 'penchant', 'stumbling', 'situations', 'pay', 'grade', 'Sarge', 'Frank', 'Grillo', 'constantly', 'be', 'there', 'writing', 'tickets', 'boys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'opening', 'sequence', 'pursuing', 'then', 'justifiably', 'shooting', 'dead', 'armed', 'offenders', 'later', 'even', 'casual', 'check', 'missing', 'old', 'lady', 'up', 'huge', 'cocaine', 'shipment', 'people', 'smuggling', 'operation', 'mass', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'immigrants.Cinema', 'v', 'eacute', 'rit', 'eacute', 'provided', 'courtesy', 'filming', 'style', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hate', 'being', 'aspiring', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'Taylor', 'person', 'several', 'product-placed', 'Canon', 'handycams', 'four', 'flip', 'recorders', 'so', 'mostly', 'watch', 'early', 'exchanges', 'own', 'jerky', 'erratic', 'camera', 'work', 'When', 'camera', 'be', 'still', 'dispatch', 'plot', 'exposition', 'character', 'establishment', 'director', 'mounted', 'dash', 'boys', 'Black', 'White', 'not', 'averse', 'splicing', 'aerial', 'shots', 'other', 'conventional', 'cinematic', 'frames', 'somewhat', 'giving', 'lie', 'found', 'footage', 'intent', 'case', 'nauseating', 'ten', 'minute', 'spell', 'beginning', 'framing', 'settle', 'down', 'bit.Now', 'one', 'thing', 'having', 'aspiring', 'film', 'school', 'police', 'officer', 'toting', 'camera', ""World's-Scariest-Police-Chases"", 'style', 'criminals', 'pursuing', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'not-so-bad', 'African', 'American', 'gang', 'baaad', 'Mexican', 'gang', 'are', 'obliged', 'filming', 'decision', 'be', 'also', 'compulsively', 'filming', 'go', 'gangster', 'business', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'cues', 'dialogue', 'attitude', 'Wire', 'well', 'truly', 'missed', 'one', 'way', 'Omar', 'boy', 'Marlo', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'dead', 'handycam', 'least', 'flagrante', 'delicto', 'shooting', 'up', 'neighbourhood.Things', 'trundle', 'candid', 'in-car', 'conversations', 'better', 'get', 'know', 'boys', 'who', 'reveal', 'be', 'good', 'well-intentioned', 'lads', 'crime-prone', 'loving', 'families', 'least', 'designs', 'then', 'really', 'dramatic', 'impetus', 'suggest', 'suddenly', 'everything', 'wrong', 'really', 'really', 'baaaaaaad', 'dudes', 'down', 'Mexico', 'are', 'finally', 'sick', 'troublesome', 'priests', 'resolve', 'local', 'agents', 'do', 'something', 'have', 'arrived', 'final', 'reel', 'Ayer', 'not', 'disappoint', 'then', 'tack', 'bizarre', 'coda', 'action', 'complete', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'other', 'means', 'providing', 'stronger', 'up-beat', 'finale.This', 'entertaining', 'extremities', 'slightly', 'potty', 'film', 'Performances', 'leads', 'are', 'strong', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'are', 'excellent', 'cracks', 'are', 'visible', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'style', 'weakly', 'scripted', 'villains.Olly', 'Buxton']",End of Watch

Also, if the somewhat goofy, out-of-control cop partners seem like a worn-out theme to you, avoid this movie.I found no fault in the acting and was rather surprised at the creative scriptwriting, since I had no idea a sentence could be constructing by simply stringing together F-words.  However, I disliked this movie for both technical and philosophical reasons.Technically, the movie is a camerawork disaster.  The movie unsuccessfully tries to merge cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; techniques with standard cinematography.  There are cameras everywhere, and the audience has no idea whose view of events it is seeing.  Is this the cop&#8217;s personal camcorder, his vest camera, or the patrol car camera?  Or have we reverted to the set camera, and we are now getting the cinematographer&#8217;s point of view?Philosophically, this movie raises a very serious social question, which it does not answer:  What is the purpose of LAPD?  When they are not trying to enjoy normal lives with friends and family, all we see in the film is our two beat cops rushing from one horrific, murderous scene to another.  Racial minorities rampage throughout the movie, taking and selling drugs, killing each other, killing cops, wrecking everything.  Our two hero cops seem to be making little or no progress.  The situation is hopeless.  The next question then arises, Why is the LAPD even wasting its time with these people?________________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category.

To give away more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, be aware that the movie is mostly shot in the style of  the TV shows ""Cops"", so if you have a hard time viewing hand-held camera photography, you'll probably want to sit this one out. Second, it appears that writer/director David ""Training Day"" Ayer is completely at home in the world of cop dramas; the movie feels as authentic as you've ever seen a cop movie, and in that vein it feels similar to ""training Day"". Third, this is as much a ""buddy"" movie than it is a cop drama, and the interaction between Gyllenhaal and Pena really carries the movie. Last, not surprisingly, the acting is mostly superb; besides the lead actors, check out also Anna ""Up In the Air"" Kendrick in a small but noticeable role as Taylor's girlfriend/eventual wife.

Dialogue is fast and electric, it's raw and it's real. As for the supporting cast there's not one hollow performance the entire cast must have known or felt this project was special - and special it is.There are no bad cops here and no super heroes, just men and women who represent the finest of a police force that sees more human devastation in a single day then most of their brothers and sisters in other parts of the country will see in the summation of their entire career.

I thought this was a pretty terrific movie. If The Wire captures what it means to be a police detective, End of Watch perfectly portrays the average completely crazy/totally boring day of patrolmen on a tough urban beat. The partnership between the two cops was fun to watch and very emotional at times. I'm not a rah-rah-rah police booster at all, but it's nice to see a film where cops aren't all portrayed as inept and/or corrupt a-holes, or as superhuman crime-stoppers, but regular people doing a hard job the best way they can. And be prepared to dry your eyes by the end.I'm taking note of some of these other reviews here. There are a bunch of 1 star reviews for ""too much bad language""... somebody actually said, ""you need to do a better job with your ratings!"" First off, this is not a one-star film by any means, no matter what the criteria (I took a star off because the director cheated a little too much with the first person POV shots). You give a movie one star because its not well made, because it's not a good film; you don't a give movie one star because it has some words you don't like. Second, it's a slice of life action drama about two young cops working South Central and East L.A., and it's RATED R.

1544268,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B008220CQU,Robert Badgley,"[0, 3]","End of Watch(released Sept/12)stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Brian Taylor,Michael Pe&ntilde;a as Mike Zavala,Natalie Martinez as Gabby and Anna Kendrick as Janet,among others.This film is one that tries its darnedest to portray a ""realism"" between a couple of cops patrolling the mean streets of south L.A.The directors use portable hand held cameras in a myriad of angles to give the viewer a you-are-there feeling.Also Officer Taylor is constantly carrying around a hand held camera for a ""project"" he is doing.Convenient.However,as inventive as the producers of this film thought that would be,it is something that we have all see dozens of times.And THAT in itself wouldn't be so bad,if the slow and meandering stop-start of a plot didn't rain down a-plenty on this cop fest parade.The story begins with a car chase,at the end of which our two protagonists,officers Taylor and Zavala,take down the occupants of a vehicle in short order.From here we become observers/flies on the wall,if you will,both visually and audially,into the officers banterings,thought processes and their friendship and careers,which bond them together.We also get a look into the regimentation and daily routine of a cop,as the two go from start of shift to end,answering various calls,some mundane,some not so.Things start getting a little tight as the two inadvertently discover a human trafficking ring in a house.The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency swoops in and takes control of the situation before they have a chance to say or do anything.On ICE agent tells them that this house is operated by a huge drug cartel and that they may have bitten off a little more than they can handle,and warns them to lay low.Time passes,Taylor gets married and the two,back out on the street,make another bust in a house.This time they discover a grisly scene with plenty of packed up drugs and body parts.This time the drug cartel sits up and takes notice and puts a hit out on the two.A local bandito by the name of Big Evil and his posse of hacks,are given the job.The trick is to get the cops alone.They do this by having one of their members make them chase him in a vehicle.They follow him into an open aired apartment complex and the posse open fires on them with automatic weaponry.The two are temporarily pinned down in an apartment and barely manage to escape.They make their way along an alleyway,praying for backup.At one point they are fired on and Taylor gets it in the neck,bleeds profusely and passes out.As his partner hovers over him we hear a click.The camera rises to reveal Mr.Evil and his posse right behind Zavala.They open fire and he collapses to the ground.Backup arrives soon after and the resultant exchange of gunfire takes the entire posse down.The film ends as Taylor attends his partners funeral and we see a flashback of the two in better times,riding in the patrol car.The opening scene is where the film goes downhill.For all the realism it tries to portray,the take down of the occupants of the vehicle is just TOO Hollywood-ish.The occupants of the chased vehicle get out and start shooting.The officers get out and coolly and methodically take them down as if they were walking into a doughnut shop.Then they high five each other afterwards.Between calls received,the plot is a meandering one as they introduce each main character and sub characters.After a while,actually quite quickly,this on again,off again roller coaster wears very thinly.Very early on you start clock watching and can't wait for this thing to end.Never a good thing with a film.No matter how good the acting cast was,they just cannot overcome the sedentary plot.I might also ask,why is the excessive use of foul language,heard to such a degree here,frequently used as a writers tool to reenforce that""realism"",when it needn't be?Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and s clear and crisp.There are no extras.All in all a disappointment.The film tries to portray the lives of two L.A.cops in a gritty and ""realistic"" fashion,but the meandering stop and go plot works against it throughout.Also the so called ""realism"" leaves alot to be desired.",2,A movie that goes downhill VERY quickly,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,4150,"['End', 'Watch', 'released', 'Sept/12', 'stars',

1544273,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B008220CQU,Robin Friedman,"[122, 130]","Directed by David Ayer, ""End of Watch"" is a police drama that celebrates the value of friendship and the all too frequently unsung efforts of police officers to try to keep the rest of us free from the violence and evil the officers constantly endure.  The movie is set on a rough police beat in South Central Los Angeles and follows the activities of two young officers, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhall) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) as they cruise the streets and fight crime. Some scenes of the movie take place in the police academy or the stationhouse and show the cameraderie among the men and the women in uniform.The movie is a mix of introspection and action. Brian and Mike depend upon each other for their lives, and they are fast friends. As they drive the streets they discuss their families, their respective ethnicities and backgrounds, their dreams and their women. Mike has been married to his high school sweetheart for eight years, while Brian has found a new romantic interest that develops in the course of the movie.  The two men are close in a macho sort of way.When not in their car, the movie depicts the life of violence and risk in the day-to-day world of the police in a crime-ridden area.  The movie shows a variety of calls, some serious some not, as Brian and Mike look for missing kids, investigate drugs in a sleazy bar, engage in fisticuffs with a small-time crook, rescue small children from a burning home, and much more. Not all the the situations are made clear.  As the movie develops, the action revolves around a large Mexican drug cartel that has its grip on the South Central LA Beat. Brian and Mike are drawn progressively deeper into investigating this cartel with scenes of human trafficking, among other things, leading to a escalating violent close.The movie captures grungy streets, shabby businesses, and derelict homes as well as a life of constant danger for the officers. One of the officers shoots videos of the passing scenery from the patrol car, giving much of the film a wavery feel to match the actions on the dangerous streets. The musical score of the film is loud, tension building, and pulsating.The dialogue, from both the police and the criminals, is raw and fully profane. The police in this movie are honest, dedicated to their calling, and willing to assume the frightening risks they take every day. They are tough individuals, both the men and the women, and not saints. Particularly as the violent cartel figures come to prominence towards the end, the movie is effective as an action drama. The stronger theme of the movie, however, lies in its development of the friendship between the two major characters.

At least it is in David Ayer's End of Watch, a movie so well made and shot in a semi-documentary style, that some have viewers have mistaken for ""found footage"" , that you never question it even when the violence reaches extreme proportions.It feels real there for in the mind's eye it is. An unflinching and edgy portal of  big city police life. At times it's a heroic look at police work, at others it is a violent thriller and a dark and depressing look at the daily evil hidden behind locked doors, at times it even feels like a horror story.With a bald and buffed bad ass Jake Gyllenhaal and the excellent character actor Michael Pena giving the performances of their respected careers, at least up to this point. Starring as two dedicated LAPD patrol men. They are best friends, brothers they say, they believe in the service that they offer to those in need.  They don't aim to be heroes, even after a heroic deed, they still say they do not feel like heroes. They are just average realistically portrayed guys.They find themselves in over there heads in the three major food groups: ""drugs, money and guns"". Just reinstated after a justified on-duty shooting, these ""ghetto gunfighters"" prove to be a more than a little reckless when they begin an unauthorized investigation that leads to Mexican drug cartels operating in L.A.End of Watch recalls the late Dennis Hopper's great, but largely forgotten Colors, which starred Robert Duvall and Sean Penn. Colors was to cop movies in the `80's what Platoon was to war films.So much of End of Watch depends on it's two leads, and fortunately they deliver. Gyllenhaal and Pena are two of our best actors working today, here you will see a different side of Gyllenhaal and a star making turn by Pena. They camaraderie and friendly banter make these characters seem more flesh and blood than in most movies.Written and directed by David Ayers, who's well known for his screenplays for movies like Training Day and, uh, the original Fast and the Furious movie. He has also directed two prior films, the reasonable Christian Bale-Freddy Rodriguez thriller Harsh Times and the dismal and dire Keanu Reeves and Chris Evan starrer Street Kings. Up to know Ayers has appeared to be somewhat overrated, even Training Day peters out in a terrible and obvious third act. But here with End of Watch Ayers really finds his niche and proves for once to be a first rate filmmaker, perhaps one coming into his own.This is also a change of direction for Ayers. Not an obvious one, at least not on first inspection, but it most certainly is. Instead of corruption in the department, he has good guys here, the new direction is a good one for him. Ayers seems fascinated by cops, LAPD ones precisely, but has never had the nerve to celebrate them before, he feels comfortable in doing so.I think a lot of people will be surprise by just how funny the sharply observed dialogue is, as two punctuate the grim realities in the film. A down and dirty gritty film for sure, but the amiable lead performances make it one of the most enjoyable.End of Watch doesn't offer much new and like a lot off movies these days it relies to much on shaky cam movements, but it does take us into the heart of darkness that is rarely explored in movies any more, the harsh realities of this world. Like all the best movies, it is more entertaining than you might suspect, and make no mistake this is one of the year's very best.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",5,being a cop is a scary way of life in south central LA,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,3551,"['Being', 'police', 'officer', 'south', 'central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'scary', 'thing', 'least', 'David', 'Ayer', 'End', 'Watch', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'shot', 'semi-documentary', 'style', 'have', 'viewers', 'have', 'mistaken', 'found', 'footage', 'never', 'question', 'even', 'when', 'violence', 'extreme', 'proportions.It', 'feels', 'real', 'there', 'mind', 'eye', 'unflinching', 'edgy', 'portal', 'big', 'city', 'police', 'life', 'times', 'heroic', 'look', 'police', 'work', 'others', 'violent', 'thriller', 'dark', 'depressing', 'look', 'daily', 'evil', 'hidden', 'locked', 'doors', 'times', 'even', 'horror', 'bald', 'buffed', 'bad', 'ass', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'excellent', 'character', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'giving', 'performances', 'respected', 'careers', 'least', 'up', 'point', 'Starring', 'two', 'dedicated', 'LAPD', 'patrol', 'men', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'brothers', 'say', 'believe', 'service', 'offer', 'need', 'do', ""n't"", 'aim', 'be', 'heroes', 'even', 'heroic', 'deed', 'still', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'heroes', 'are', 'just', 'average', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'guys.They', 'find', 'heads', 'three', 'major', 'food', 'groups', 'drugs', 'money', 'guns', 'Just', 'reinstated', 'justified', 'on-duty', 'shooting', 'ghetto', 'gunfighters', 'prove', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'reckless', 'when', 'begin', 'unauthorized', 'investigation', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'cartels', 'operating', 'L.A.End', 'Watch', 'late', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'great', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'Colors', 'starred', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Colors', 'was', 'cop', 'movies', '80', 'what', 'Platoon', 'was', 'war', 'films.So', 'much', 'End', 'Watch', 'two', 'leads', 'fortunately', 'deliver', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Pena', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'here', 'will', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'Gyllenhaal', 'star', 'making', 'turn', 'Pena', 'camaraderie', 'friendly', 'banter', 'make', 'characters', 'seem', 'more', 'flesh', 'blood', 'most', 'movies.Written', 'directed', 'David', 'Ayers', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'screenplays', 'movies', 'Training', 'Day', 'uh', 'original', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'movie', 'also', 'directed', 'two', 'prior', 'films', 'reasonable', 'Christian', 'Bale-Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'thriller', 'Harsh', 'Times', 'dismal', 'dire', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Chris', 'Evan', 'starrer', 'Street', 'Kings', 'Up', 'know', 'Ayers', 'appeared', 'be', 'somewhat', 'overrated', 'even', 'Training', 'Day', 'out', 'terrible', 'obvious', 'third', 'act', 'here', 'End', 'Watch', 'Ayers', 'really', 'niche', 'proves', 'once', 'be', 'first', 'rate', 'filmmaker', 'perhaps', 'one', 'coming', 'own.This', 'also', 'change', 'direction', 'Ayers', 'Not', 'obvious', 'one', 'least', 'not', 'first', 'inspection', 'most', 'certainly', 'Instead', 'corruption', 'department', 'good', 'guys', 'here', 'new', 'direction', 'good', 'one', 'Ayers', 'fascinated', 'cops', 'LAPD', 'ones', 'precisely', 'never', 'had', 'nerve', 'celebrate', 'before', 'comfortable', 'doing', 'so.I', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'surprise', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'sharply', 'observed', 'dialogue', 'two', 'punctuate', 'grim', 'realities', 'film', 'down', 'dirty', 'gritty', 'film', 'sure', 'amiable', 'lead', 'performances', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable.End', 'Watch', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'new', 'lot', 'movies', 'days', 'much', 'shaky', 'cam', 'movements', 'take', 'heart', 'darkness', 'rarely', 'explored', 'movies', 'more', 'harsh', 'realities', 'world', 'best', 'movies', 'more', 'entertaining', 'might', 'suspect', 'make', 'mistake', 'one', 'year', 'very', 'best.see', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",End of Watch

It was a weekly ritual.  Boys wanted to be cops back then, or firemen, or soldiers.  Men they looked up to.  And Adam 12 was, at the time, considered pretty realistic, or at least cops said it was the most like the bouts of the mundane with spurts of danger that was actual police work.  Any buddy cop show gets measured against it for me.  The issue, of course, is that Adam 12 was a product of its time, meaning that as much as it showed people at their worst, it never quite ground under its own weight in depravity and hopelessness.  At its center was the assurance that the police were doing something meaningful.End of Watch is Adam 12 on heroin, in an alley and being pissed on awake by the next knuckle-dragging lowlife that will brutalize it.  It's one of those movies that traffics in the worst of people and offers no answers nor hope.  The police might as well be zookeepers, or maybe landscapers who just keep coming to mow the lawn because they're paid, knowing full well it will grow back again next week for no other purpose than to keep them employed.  It's jazzed up with the standard macho, smart ass posturing that passes for depth, especially when we're young.  To make it topical and I guess cliched, the white and brown leads (a-series-of-triangles Jake Gyllenhaal and happy-scrappy-sappy Michael Pena) trade racially-tinged barbs with each other, you know, to be edgy but also show they really love each other as comrades in arms.  It uses the shaky cam both to keep the budget low and to give it verisimilitude, `cause we all go through life bobbing around or fliming ourselves.Insight never really appears.  Instead, we get smart ass quips or repackaged homilies about the meaing of life.  Lots of statements that end in ""bro"" and ""dude.""  Witness, when one  partner asks the other about how to know if he should marry his girlfirend:""My grandma  . . . was really deep, man.  She's seen it all. Know what I'm saying? . . . Can you live without her?Really?  That's it?  Can you live without her?  That's the best she could come up with after 50 or 60 years on planet Earth?Here's another gem.""Janet's pregnant.""""WHUUTTTTTTTTTTT?""The problem with End of Watch is that these moments of truth are as deep as anything gets.

Yeah?  A bowel movement is real too, but that doesn't mean I want to watch it for 90 minutes.  I expect a little more out of art than I do out of a bowel movement.Critics went nuts about this movie when it came up, so I suppose I had unrealistic expectations.  But, really, Southland does the same thing every week.  So did Colors.  So did Fort Apache, the Bronx.  Even then, I didn't feel stupider and like taking a shower after watching them.

1544330,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008220CQU,Turfseer,"[0, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'End of Watch' was written in six days by Writer/Director David Ayer. The story focuses on two LAPD cops, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyallanhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pe&ntilde;a), on patrol in their squad car in South Central Los Angeles. Taylor is shooting a film project (not sure why) and both officers wear miniature cameras on their lapels. The idea is to give the narrative a documentary feel. At other times, however, Taylor and Zavala are shot from a third party perspective--one wonders if this is supposed to be shot in a real-life documentary style (in real- time), who is supposed to be filming Taylor and Zavala, independent of Taylor's 'flim project'? Obviously filming the entire story from the two officers' perspectives, just wasn't working and Mr. Ayer was forced to adopt the more traditional third party viewpoint, for a good number of scenes.I assume that what Ayer did here was to take some of the more sensational 'inner city' real-life cop stories and condense them into a more fast-paced narrative. Hence, some of Taylor and Zavala's encounters are quite gripping. I'm thinking particularly of the scenes where they find the two children duct-taped in the closet while the parents waste away in a crack den, another scene where a whole group of human trafficking victims are found as well as the discovery of dismembered corpses, victims of a particularly vicious drug cartel.Not all of the police officers' machinations ring true. When Zavala decides to fight Tre, a Bloods gang member, and afterward refuses to charge him with assault, it's difficult to believe that a police officer, would put himself in harm's way, merely to earn a gang member's respect (the beat down could have resulted in serious injuries for Tre, along with a lawsuit--resulting in Zavala's job being placed in jeopardy).More unlikely is the idea that the drug cartel would go out of their way to target LAPD members on a number of occasions. Recall this happens twice in the film: the first time, one cop is stabbed in the eye and another one is severely beaten in the face. Then there is the film's climax, where the protagonists face the 'end of watch'. I realize that in Mexico, cops are targeted all the time by drug gangs and cartels but I have not heard that many stories about American law enforcement being directly challenged by these out of country lawbreakers. Would it really be in these cartel's best interest to directly target LAPD officers? After all, they're in a business where they don't want to call too much attention to themselves. And by assaulting and even murdering LAPD officers, that would lead to the enmity of an entire department. I realize that the cartel hire the local gang bangers to do their dirty work but such select targeting of LAPD by the cartels would result in vastly increased scrutiny as well as retaliation by law enforcement.'End of Watch' also covers the private lives of Taylor and Zavala. Most of the time, they rib one another but also display passionate displays of loyalty (particularly during the tragic climax). The ribbing gets a little tiresome as there's a little too much of it during the film. I particularly was annoyed by the little flashback that was tacked on after the funeral. Why was it necessary to serve up another scene with the partners once again busting on one another. The crudity of their jokes obviously is designed to show that they are 'ordinary' people but showing that directly following the solemnity of the funeral, diminishes their heroic stature.The 'End of Watch' climax is heart-pounding as the officers are cornered by gang member mercenaries, conscripted by the drug cartel seeking revenge. But the gang members themselves are so over the top, that we can't take them seriously. And the awkward way in which they are taken out, hardly seems realistic at all.'End of Watch' features two excellent performances by Gyallanhaal and Pe&ntilde;a. There are also a series of fairly shocking scenes involving what LAPD officers have encountered during their travails while on the 'beat'. I didn't buy everything, particularly the idea that drug cartels would invite trouble by specifically targeting LAPD officers. Still, there's enough here to keep your interest, despite the obvious exaggerations.",3,LAPD cop saga has moments of both heady and implausible verisimilitude,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,4317,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'End"", 'Watch', 'was', 'written', 'six', 'days', 'Writer/Director', 'David', 'Ayer', 'story', 'two', 'LAPD', 'cops', 'Brian', 'Taylor', 'Jake', 'Gyallanhaal', 'Mike', 'Zavala', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'patrol', 'squad', 'car', 'South', 'Central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Taylor', 'shooting', 'film', 'project', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'officers', 'wear', 'miniature', 'cameras', 'lapels', 'idea', 'give', 'narrative', 'documentary', 'feel', 'other', 'times', 'however', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'are', 'shot', 'third', 'party', 'perspective', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'shot', 'real-life', 'documentary', 'style', 'real-', 'time', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'filming', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'independent', 'Taylor', ""'flim"", 'project', 'Obviously', 'filming', 'entire', 'story', 'two', 'officers', 'perspectives', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'Mr.', 'Ayer', 'was', 'forced', 'adopt', 'more', 'traditional', 'third', 'party', 'viewpoint', 'good', 'number', 'scenes.I', 'assume', 'what', 'Ayer', 'did', 'here', 'was', 'take', 'more', 'sensational', ""'inner"", 'city', 'real-life', 'cop', 'stories', 'condense', 'more', 'fast-paced', 'narrative', 'Hence', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'encounters', 'are', 'quite', 'gripping', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'where', 'find', 'two', 'children', 'duct-taped', 'closet', 'parents', 'waste', 'away', 'crack', 'den', 'scene', 'where', 'whole', 'group', 'human', 'trafficking', 'victims', 'are', 'found', 'as', 'well', 'discovery', 'dismembered', 'corpses', 'victims', 'particularly', 'vicious', 'drug', 'cartel.Not', 'police', 'officers', 'machinations', 'ring', 'true', 'When', 'Zavala', 'fight', 'Tre', 'Bloods', 'gang', 'member', 'afterward', 'charge', 'assault', 'difficult', 'believe', 'police', 'officer', 'would', 'put', 'harm', 'way', 'merely', 'earn', 'gang', 'member', 'respect', 'beat', 'down', 'could', 'have', 'resulted', 'serious', 'injuries', 'Tre', 'lawsuit', 'resulting', 'Zavala', 'job', 'being', 'placed', 'jeopardy', '.More', 'unlikely', 'idea', 'drug', 'cartel', 'would', 'go', 'way', 'target', 'LAPD', 'members', 'number', 'occasions', 'Recall', 'twice', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'cop', 'stabbed', 'eye', 'one', 'severely', 'beaten', 'face', 'Then', 'film', 'climax', 'where', 'protagonists', 'face', ""'end"", 'watch', 'realize', 'Mexico', 'cops', 'are', 'targeted', 'time', 'drug', 'gangs', 'cartels', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'many', 'stories', 'American', 'law', 'enforcement', 'being', 'directly', 'challenged', 'country', 'lawbreakers', 'Would', 'really', 'be', 'cartel', 'best', 'interest', 'directly', 'target', 'LAPD', 'officers', ""'re"", 'business', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'call', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'assaulting', 'even', 'murdering', 'LAPD', 'officers', 'would', 'lead', 'enmity', 'entire', 'department', 'realize', 'cartel', 'hire', 'local', 'gang', 'bangers', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'such', 'select', 'targeting', 'LAPD', 'cartels', 'would', 'result', 'vastly', 'increased', 'scrutiny', 'as', 'well', 'retaliation', 'law', 'enforcement', ""'End"", 'Watch', 'also', 'private', 'lives', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'Most', 'time', 'rib', 'one', 'also', 'display', 'passionate', 'displays', 'loyalty', 'particularly', 'tragic', 'climax', 'ribbing', 'little', 'tiresome', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'particularly', 'was', 'annoyed', 'little', 'flashback', 'was', 'tacked', 'funeral', 'Why', 'was', 'necessary', 'serve', 'up', 'scene', 'partners', 'once', 'again', 'busting', 'one', 'crudity', 'jokes', 'obviously', 'designed', 'show', 'are', ""'ordinary"", 'people', 'showing', 'directly', 'following', 'solemnity', 'funeral', 'heroic', 'stature.The', ""'End"", 'Watch', 'climax', 'heart-pounding', 'officers', 'are', 'cornered', 'gang', 'member', 'mercenaries', 'conscripted', 'drug', 'cartel', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'gang', 'members', 'are', 'so', 'top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'awkward', 'way', 'are', 'taken', 'out', 'hardly', 'realistic', ""'End"", 'Watch', 'features', 'two', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Gyallanhaal', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'are', 'also', 'series', 'fairly', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'involving', 'what', 'LAPD', 'officers', 'have', 'encountered', 'travails', ""'beat"", 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'everything', 'particularly', 'idea', 'drug', 'cartels', 'would', 'invite', 'trouble', 'specifically', 'targeting', 'LAPD', 'officers', 'Still', 'enough', 'here', 'keep', 'interest', 'obvious', 'exaggerations']",End of Watch
