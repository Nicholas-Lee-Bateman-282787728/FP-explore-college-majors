Pooh and the others are frightened that their letter to Santa won't make it to the North Pole in time for the holiday, so the Silly Old Bear sets out to make things right (succeeding only in making things worse, but giving a great example of self-sacrifice).Never quite elevated to the level of being a ""classic"" but it's very good and deserves to be viewed annually.",4,Very good,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,449,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'cared', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Christmas', 'special', 'heartwarming', 'Pooh', 'others', 'are', 'frightened', 'letter', 'Santa', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'North', 'Pole', 'time', 'holiday', 'Silly', 'Old', 'Bear', 'out', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'succeeding', 'only', 'making', 'things', 'worse', 'giving', 'great', 'example', 'self-sacrifice', 'quite', 'elevated', 'level', 'being', 'classic', 'very', 'good', 'be', 'viewed', 'annually']",Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too VHS
359048,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,6303123244,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","This is one of the better Christmas specials for young kids and was a favorite of my teenager when he was little.  Pooh, Christopher Robin and the rest of the gang all write a letter to Santa Claus to tell him what they want for Christmas.  After mailing the letter, Pooh realizes he forgot to ask for a gift.  The gang then try and get the letter back and send it north but it just blows back. They soon realize it's Christmas Eve and it's too late.  Pooh then tries to disguise himself as Santa to give the gang a nice Christmas and eventually everything works out in the long run.A very good special with heart and laughs.  The animation is very good unlike the regular Pooh TV show of the 190's and the late Paul Winchell does the voice of Tigger.

I like Disney's incarnation of this universe (far removed from AA Milne's world), but the TV series is the best way to enjoy it.This 1991 Xmas Special finds Christopher Robin sending a letter to Santa Claus for himself and his animal friends.
