But I just absolutley felt depressed and down after watching it. True this is a true story and its based off of true events. But man it was so dark and somber and disturbing there just wasn't any light at the end of the tunnel. The main character I literly hated and I felt so sorry for the yound girl. And I just actually can't believe she will be getting out of jail next year. How ? How ? is this possible after she did such a horrilbe thing ? Watch at your own risk but I am warning you ..this will bring you down a few notches.

1427122,A1UOTG037037XY,B004SEUJ5A,Cleo,"[2, 2]","Ruth Bradley is even scarier skinny as she is inAlarmwhere she plays the Screaming Home Owner.  She frightened me so much in that film that watching In Her Skin feels like an extension of watching Alarm.When Ruth Bradley appears in this film, the victim's mother mistake is instantly recognizable: she got involved in a bad situation where the toxicity is innate and not due to external factors and allowed someone bearing ill-will as a default to know her daughter.  People with nice lives, nice people must stay away from chronically unhappy, inherently troubled families.  In other words, stay away from your opposite.  Their problems are their own doing and the murderer's pitying Rage Crying is spot on.  I've heard that kind of scream wailing before and it has nothing to do with someone who is injured - it is VERY different from someone who is being attacked.  It's about someone who wants something they don't have and feel entitled to it.  That's too bad for them but stay away from them.  This is a great cautionary tale as well as an instructive, indeed ILLUMINATING account of how an innocent wonderful children can be attacked in the most thought-out sadistic manner because someone CRAVES feeling superior to others to the point that they cannot allow anyone else to be happy and well.  Even if the killer was at the top of the pyramid, they still can't bear anyone else to be happy.  That is the Nature of the Beast.I would never have watched this film if Guy Pearce wasn't in the cast but I didn't find it hard to get through at all.  Ruth Bradley genuinely frightens me.About five minutes into this movie, it made me wish that loved ones were all implanted with a gps locator and it's going to make every parent wish they had escorted their children door-to-door because even waiting for them at the bus/tram stop isn't enough.One of the great things about this film is that it shows the excuses and self pity made by the killer who feels inferior and ugly.  You don't see other people becoming sadists and killers because they don't win beauty contests.  ILLUMINATING.It's not like these monsters will become angelic if only God would intervene and give them perfect skin and make them richer than everyone else - in other words, the Evil Queen is still Evil even after she gets her fondest wish and curses everyone to be her subjects and she becomes their Mayor in Storyville - evil is evil NOT because they're disadvantaged and have had a hard life.Right before she commits the planned murder, she makes a phone call creating excuses for herself.  She then used the method of killing that the Japanese and Germans used on rape victims i.e. repeated strangulation so that the rapists could feel the the sensation of life leaving a person AND to make the victim frightened and WISH that they were dead instead of enduring further - this repeated strangulation is also shown in Korean horror films and American Psycho also showed another Japanese nuance of STABBING the victim to death while you are raping her.In this film, the killer is a woman but she shares the same motivation as her male counterparts. HATRED and the sneaky desire of wanting to get away with it.",4,Fantastic character analysis of Evil,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,3186,"['Ruth', 'Bradley', 'even', 'scarier', 'skinny', 'inAlarmwhere', 'Screaming', 'Home', 'Owner', 'frightened', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'watching', 'Her', 'Skin', 'feels', 'extension', 'watching', 'Alarm.When', 'Ruth', 'Bradley', 'film', 'victim', 'mother', 'mistake', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'got', 'involved', 'bad', 'situation', 'where', 'toxicity', 'innate', 'not', 'due', 'external', 'factors', 'allowed', 'someone', 'bearing', 'ill-will', 'default', 'know', 'daughter', 'People', 'nice', 'lives', 'nice', 'people', 'must', 'stay', 'away', 'chronically', 'unhappy', 'inherently', 'troubled', 'families', 'other', 'words', 'stay', 'away', 'opposite', 'problems', 'are', 'own', 'doing', 'murderer', 'pitying', 'Rage', 'Crying', 'spot', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'kind', 'scream', 'wailing', 'nothing', 'do', 'someone', 'who', 'injured', 'VERY', 'different', 'someone', 'who', 'being', 'attacked', 'someone', 'who', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'entitled', 'too', 'bad', 'stay', 'away', 'great', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'as', 'well', 'instructive', 'indeed', 'ILLUMINATING', 'account', 'how', 'innocent', 'wonderful', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'attacked', 'most', 'thought-out', 'sadistic', 'manner', 'someone', 'CRAVES', 'feeling', 'superior', 'others', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'allow', 'anyone', 'else', 'be', 'happy', 'well', 'Even', 'killer', 'was', 'top', 'pyramid', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'anyone', 'else', 'be', 'happy', 'Nature', 'Beast.I', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'was', ""n't"", 'cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'hard', 'get', 'Ruth', 'Bradley', 'genuinely', 'me.About', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'made', 'wish', 'loved', 'ones', 'were', 'implanted', 'gps', 'locator', 'going', 'make', 'parent', 'wish', 'had', 'escorted', 'children', 'door-to-door', 'even', 'waiting', 'bus/tram', 'stop', ""n't"", 'enough.One', 'great', 'things', 'film', 'excuses', 'pity', 'made', 'killer', 'who', 'inferior', 'ugly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'people', 'becoming', 'sadists', 'killers', 'do', ""n't"", 'win', 'beauty', 'contests', 'ILLUMINATING.It', 'not', 'monsters', 'will', 'become', 'angelic', 'only', 'God', 'would', 'intervene', 'give', 'perfect', 'skin', 'make', 'richer', 'everyone', 'else', 'other', 'words', 'Evil', 'Queen', 'still', 'Evil', 'even', 'fondest', 'wish', 'everyone', 'be', 'subjects', 'Mayor', 'Storyville', 'evil', 'evil', 'NOT', ""'re"", 'disadvantaged', 'have', 'had', 'hard', 'life.Right', 'planned', 'murder', 'phone', 'call', 'creating', 'excuses', 'herself', 'then', 'used', 'method', 'killing', 'Japanese', 'Germans', 'used', 'rape', 'victims', 'i.e', 'repeated', 'strangulation', 'rapists', 'could', 'feel', 'sensation', 'life', 'leaving', 'person', 'make', 'victim', 'frightened', 'WISH', 'were', 'dead', 'instead', 'enduring', 'further', 'repeated', 'strangulation', 'also', 'shown', 'Korean', 'horror', 'films', 'American', 'Psycho', 'also', 'showed', 'Japanese', 'nuance', 'STABBING', 'victim', 'death', 'are', 'raping', 'her.In', 'film', 'killer', 'woman', 'shares', 'same', 'motivation', 'male', 'counterparts', 'HATRED', 'sneaky', 'desire', 'wanting', 'get', 'away']",N/A
1427123,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004SEUJ5A,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","In the beginning of this film they don't say it's based on a true story. They say it IS a true story. For the most part I can believe that. There are some parts though that I will question.Here's the scoop. Rachel Barber is a pretty, talented fifteen year old girl in Australia who goes missing with no real clue as to what happened. The parents know in their guts something is wrong. The police, of course, have seen too many of these type cases and aren't easily excited. We then meet a seriously disturbed, self pitying neighbor girl, Caroline, and the story takes on a whole new pallor.That this is a true story and told with little histrionics gives it all the more power and gravity. As other reviewers have noted, the neighbor girl, Caroline, is so screwed up she should have been institutionalized long before any of this happened. Ruth Bradley plays the Caroline role to the hilt. She is a scary individual. Her obsessive writing notes, planning, and refusal to take any responsibility for things about herself she doesn't like, but could easily change, makes it difficult to sympathize with her. Watching her spiral down into madness is uncomfortable. Her dad is too busy and, due to his divorce, not around to deal with her. Mom is simply incapable of the task. Guy Pearce and Miranda Otto play Rachel's parents. Both do a stand up job. You believe them and what they do to try and find their daughter. Though they say this is a true story, some of the scenes put the viewer alone with Caroline so, like ""In Cold Blood"", you know the writer must be guessing as to what was actually happening at those moments. I found it interesting that, like in ""Taxi Driver"" Caroline's actions act as a catharsis for her and she seems to be more calm after it all. The other roles are played to lend a sense of realism to things. John Butler handles the music score and it well compliments what happens on screen.This is a real good flick. It moves evenly and the directing is, for the most part, underplayed to not make things overwrought. If you like real crime stories, this is about as good as it gets.",4,The Spiral Down,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,2103,"['beginning', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'say', 'true', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'believe', 'are', 'parts', 'will', 'question.Here', 'scoop', 'Rachel', 'Barber', 'pretty', 'talented', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Australia', 'who', 'missing', 'real', 'clue', 'what', 'happened', 'parents', 'know', 'guts', 'something', 'wrong', 'police', 'course', 'have', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'type', 'cases', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'excited', 'then', 'meet', 'seriously', 'disturbed', 'pitying', 'neighbor', 'girl', 'Caroline', 'story', 'whole', 'new', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'little', 'histrionics', 'more', 'power', 'gravity', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'neighbor', 'girl', 'Caroline', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'institutionalized', 'long', 'happened', 'Ruth', 'Bradley', 'Caroline', 'role', 'hilt', 'scary', 'individual', 'obsessive', 'writing', 'notes', 'planning', 'refusal', 'take', 'responsibility', 'things', ""n't"", 'like', 'could', 'easily', 'change', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'Watching', 'spiral', 'down', 'madness', 'uncomfortable', 'dad', 'too', 'busy', 'due', 'divorce', 'not', 'deal', 'Mom', 'simply', 'incapable', 'task', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'play', 'Rachel', 'parents', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'job', 'believe', 'what', 'do', 'try', 'find', 'daughter', 'say', 'true', 'story', 'scenes', 'put', 'viewer', 'alone', 'Caroline', 'so', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'know', 'writer', 'must', 'be', 'guessing', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'happening', 'moments', 'found', 'interesting', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Caroline', 'actions', 'act', 'catharsis', 'be', 'more', 'calm', 'other', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'lend', 'sense', 'realism', 'things', 'John', 'Butler', 'music', 'score', 'well', 'what', 'screen.This', 'real', 'good', 'flick', 'evenly', 'directing', 'most', 'part', 'underplayed', 'not', 'make', 'things', 'overwrought', 'like', 'real', 'crime', 'stories', 'about', 'as', 'good']",N/A
1427124,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004SEUJ5A,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","Simone North has written and directed this film which opens with the statement `The is a true story' of a kidnapping and murder of a 15 year old girl in Australia. North tells her story quietly until the brutality intercepts the horror of the incident reported: the film at that point becomes a visual reenactment of a nightmare of a broken mind.The Barber family appears to be a tender loving ensemble. Mr Barber (Guy Pearce, in a very subdued role) and Mrs Barber (Miranda Otto) are the proud parents of Rachel (Kate Bell), a beautiful and talented dancer who is studying ballet with her boyfriend Manni (Khan Chittendon): the scenes of these two beautiful young people dancing are elegant and sensual at once.The story jumps backward five years where we meet the babysitter for the Barbers, a strange girl named Caroline Reid (Ruth Bradley) who has severe psychotic problems and is unable to be controlled by her father (Sam Neill).Back in the present Rachel and Manni have been at dance class but Rachel does not meet her father at the train, and soon it becomes obvious that Rachel is missing. Both the barbers panic and post signs of Rachel all over the city, doing their own detective work because the authorities refuse to treat the missing Rachel as anything but a runaway child. Slowly we discover the role of Caroline in the mystery. Caroline's psychosis includes self-mutilation and self loathing of her overweight body and clumsy appearance. She longs to look like and have the elegance of Rachel. How Caroline uses Rachel to achieve her dreams is the creepy ending to this forceful film.Each of the actors is excellent but it is a tour de force for Ruth Bradley who gives evidence of a talent to watch. Not a film for the weak of heart but definitely a film that explores the machinations of a sick mind longing for a different identity.

1427125,A11KSBJ3BZMEDQ,B004SEUJ5A,Lady Detektive,"[3, 12]","This is a brutal, disturbing and horrifying film with no redeeming value. I wish I hadn't watched it. I read an article where the parents of the murdered girl stated they were glad to have their daughter's story brought to attention, but the film is not really about the murdered teen.  She is only shown briefly, and we learn almost nothing about her. The story concentrates mostly on the psychotic woman who brutally murdered her- told with an empathetic slant toward the murderer. The only good I can see possibly coming from this frightening film, is that someone with a seriously mentally ill family member, who isn't getting the help they require, might reach out and get the person the help they need before tragedy strikes. I cannot understand why the parents of this psychopath, who, according to the film, showed psychotic behavior her entire life, did not get her the help she needed, nor can I understand why she was only given a sentence of twenty years for a confessed, cold-blooded, pre-meditated murder.

1427129,A2NA9CGPX4KJ1U,B004SEUJ5A,"R. Smith ""bookworm""","[1, 1]","I am intrigued by the story behind this film.  Ruth Bradley portrays Caroline Reed Robertson, a disturbed young woman who will go to any lengths to be somebody else.  Caroline wishes that her life could be perfect.  She wants a loving family, a slim body, clear skin, and lots of friends.  But in reality she is overweight with greasy hair, a troubled home life, a sullen disposition, and few friends.  She is also the target of bullies and she suffers from low self-esteem.She develops an obsessive fixation on Rachel, a girl that she babysat several years before.  Rachel is Caroline's polar opposite...a thin, pretty ballerina with a boyfriend and a family that dotes on her.  Caroline desperately wants to change her own life but she doesn't know how.  And thus Rachel becomes the object of Caroline's twisted fantasies, which is how the tragedy unfolds.Bradley depicts Caroline's rage and pain in a truly terrifying way.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for her, too, despite her evil actions.  ""In Her Skin"" is a glimpse into the mind of a person who is so unhappy with herself that she wants to live vicariously through another.This story reminds me of other stories where young girls have lost their lives to jealousy...""Death of a Cheerleader"", ""The Stalking of Laurie Show"", and ""A Killer Among Friends"" are some examples.  All of these are based on actual events.This film was brilliantly done, in my opinion.  It illustrates the complexity of one woman's longing for love and acceptance and her serious psychological issues.  It also shows how there is often a dichotomy between members of society...those who are considered beautiful and privileged, and those less fortunate.  By killing Rachel, Caroline is lashing out at the world.  She is getting back at all the bullies and the people who shunned her.  She is also hurting Rachel, the innocent victim, because she is wounded inside.Rachel is/was symbolic of the things that she can only hope to be.  She will never be a ""pretty"" girl.  She will never have Rachel's beauty or popularity or a family that cares about her.  Her desire to live Rachel's life, to be in Rachel's skin instead of her own, is what leads to this horror.  Bradley portrays Caroline as a psychopath but also as a rather pitiful figure.  She doesn't really hate her chosen victim.  She hates herself, her very existence, and her life.And it is striking to note that even after killing Rachel, she still isn't completely satisfied when she looks in the mirror.  She hasn't magically become prettier or thinner because Rachel is dead.  Her life hasn't transformed.  So I guess this story is a reminder to all of us that no matter what, we should try not to compare ourselves with others because we're all different.

We know how Hollywood likes to play fast and loose with that definition. Often, the movies actually have little in common with the truth. So whenever I watch a movie that is supposedly based on a true story, I often spend more time wondering just how much is real and how much is fiction.You don't have to worry about that with this film, which depicts the disappearance of a 15-year-old girl, Rachel Barber, who was eventually discovered to have been murdered by 20-year-old Caroline Reid/Caroline Reed Robertson, a former babysiter. The Barber family actually participated with the making of this film. I've read Elizabeth Barber's account of the crime (Perfect Victim, written under her pen name Elizabeth Southall), and the movie hews very closely to her story. Although the murder scene is disturbingly graphic, the film does not come off as some cheap lurid trashploitation film, the way a lot of ""true crime"" movies do. I felt like the filmmaker (Simone North) really does respect the Barbers and went out of her way to tell their story as best as she could.This movie is not perfect. I'm not sure how I feel about the movie's structure. I'm not against non-linear storytelling - I enjoyed the movie Elephant by Gus Van Sant - but I don't think North was entirely successful in how she did this. The movie starts off from Mike and Elizabeth's perspective. Then it loops back in time as we switch to Caroline's, then we switch to Rachel's, etc. I just don't think it flowed very well.The actors are all top-notch, especially Ruth Bradley. She really makes Caroline not come across as a one-note villain.As for the DVD itself... there are a number of extra features here that people might like. We get a few short deleted scenes, plus a couple of behind-the-scenes clips. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with Guy Pearce and Mirando Otto. (Side observation: Miranda chokes up a few times during her interview when she's talking about the real Rachel. It is strangely touching, maybe because it tells me that this wasn't simply a paycheck for her. She's clearly been affected by the story.) We get to see a number of photos of the real Rachel, as well, along with the rest of the Barber family. It's sobering and really drives home the fact that she was a real person, not simply a character in a movie.",4,"good movie, based on a true story",1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,2390,"[""'m"", 'always', 'skeptical', 'when', 'hear', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'know', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'definition', 'Often', 'movies', 'actually', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'truth', 'whenever', 'watch', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'often', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'wondering', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'real', 'how', 'much', 'fiction.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'film', 'disappearance', '15-year-old', 'girl', 'Rachel', 'Barber', 'who', 'was', 'eventually', 'discovered', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', '20-year-old', 'Caroline', 'Reid/Caroline', 'Reed', 'Robertson', 'former', 'babysiter', 'Barber', 'family', 'actually', 'participated', 'making', 'film', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Elizabeth', 'Barber', 'account', 'crime', 'Perfect', 'Victim', 'written', 'pen', 'name', 'Elizabeth', 'Southall', 'movie', 'very', 'closely', 'story', 'murder', 'scene', 'disturbingly', 'graphic', 'film', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'cheap', 'lurid', 'trashploitation', 'film', 'way', 'lot', 'true', 'crime', 'movies', 'do', 'felt', 'filmmaker', 'Simone', 'North', 'really', 'respect', 'Barbers', 'went', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'as', 'best', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'movie', 'structure', ""'m"", 'not', 'non-linear', 'storytelling', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Elephant', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'North', 'was', 'entirely', 'successful', 'how', 'did', 'movie', 'Mike', 'Elizabeth', 'perspective', 'Then', 'back', 'time', 'switch', 'Caroline', 'then', 'switch', 'Rachel', 'etc', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'flowed', 'very', 'well.The', 'actors', 'are', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'Ruth', 'Bradley', 'really', 'Caroline', 'not', 'come', 'one-note', 'villain.As', 'DVD', 'are', 'number', 'extra', 'features', 'here', 'people', 'might', 'like', 'get', 'few', 'short', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'couple', 'behind-the-scenes', 'clips', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'interviews', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Mirando', 'Otto', 'Side', 'observation', 'Miranda', 'up', 'few', 'times', 'interview', 'when', 'talking', 'real', 'Rachel', 'strangely', 'touching', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'simply', 'paycheck', 'clearly', 'been', 'affected', 'story', 'get', 'see', 'number', 'photos', 'real', 'Rachel', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'Barber', 'family', 'sobering', 'really', 'home', 'fact', 'was', 'real', 'person', 'not', 'simply', 'character', 'movie']",N/A

1427133,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B004SEUJ5A,titania86,"[0, 0]","In Her Skin tells the chilling true story of Caroline Reed Robertson and how she murdered fifteen year old Rachel Barber. The story shows three points of view: Rachel's, her family's, and finally, Caroline's. Rachel's life is pretty much perfect. Her family is affluent, loving, and happy. She's a talented dancer and has a loving, devoted boyfriend. Others find her beautiful and she's generally well liked. Of course, Rachel has things she hides from her parents such as sex, drinking, and general teenage mischief. Unfortunately, the film doesn't take the time to delve into Rachel's character as it does to Caroline's, so she remains a generic teen.Rachel's family pushes to find any clue after she goes missing. The police think they are in denial about their daughter running away and dismiss their constant theories and urging to do more. They knew something was wrong when Rachel wasn't at the train station and the case was solved due to their unwillingness to dismiss their daughter. I found the characterization of the parents to be a little weird. In one scene, the father completely breaks down, convinced Rachel is dead. The mother is also overwhelmed, but leaves the room, leaving their young daughter to comfort her husband. The scene just struck me as incredibly odd and possibly indicative of a deeper discordance in the family to be revealed later (which it wasn't). The other odd scene was when the family was told Rachel was dead. They didn't have any outward emotional reaction at all despite having their worst fears confirmed. I realize that everyone processes and grieves in their own way, but it was a jarring scene when they had been emotional at the very thought that it might have happened.That brings us to Caroline Reed Robertson. For most of her life, she's been miserable, full of self loathing, and dismissed or disliked by everyone she knows. Her father was largely absent from her life and when she tried to reach out him, he rejected her. Her mother grew tired of her continued abuse and gave up on her, dismissing her as a bad seed. At school, her classmates relentlessly tease and torment her. She internalizes their taunts and fuels her self loathing. Who knows how it started, but Caroline ended up with no one to turn to. Every support system out there failed her. You can't help but feel for her as she is rejected time and time again by those around her and in turn hates herself. Caroline sees Rachel's idyllic life from afar and wants it so badly. In a decision that defies reason and sanity, she decides to kidnap, murder, and assume the identity of Rachel Barber. The murder scene is quite brutal and raw and deservedly stood out from the rest of the film.Ruth Bradley performs amazingly as Caroline. Her mood swings, depression, self loathing, rage, and (short lived) smug surety are deftly portrayed and completely believable. It's her performance and Simone North's writing and direction that allows the audience to sympathize with her plight while still being disgusted and horrified by her crime and her lack of remorse afterwards. It's also the reason why the film piqued my interest and left me thinking about it for days. It would have been so easy to show Caroline to be a one dimensional monster, but to show she is a person unable to make a connection with others or herself takes effort and guts. Instead, there are a great many passionate responses and discussions about Simone North's approach to the story. I highly recommend this thought provoking film.",5,A nuanced portrayal of a real life murderer makes this film memorable and magnetic,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,3517,"['Skin', 'chilling', 'true', 'story', 'Caroline', 'Reed', 'Robertson', 'how', 'murdered', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'Rachel', 'Barber', 'story', 'three', 'points', 'view', 'Rachel', 'family', 'finally', 'Caroline', 'Rachel', 'life', 'pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'family', 'affluent', 'loving', 'happy', 'talented', 'dancer', 'loving', 'devoted', 'boyfriend', 'Others', 'find', 'beautiful', 'generally', 'well', 'liked', 'course', 'Rachel', 'things', 'parents', 'such', 'sex', 'drinking', 'general', 'teenage', 'mischief', 'Unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'delve', 'Rachel', 'character', 'Caroline', 'generic', 'teen.Rachel', 'family', 'pushes', 'find', 'clue', 'missing', 'police', 'think', 'are', 'denial', 'daughter', 'running', 'away', 'dismiss', 'constant', 'theories', 'urging', 'do', 'more', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'when', 'Rachel', 'was', ""n't"", 'train', 'station', 'case', 'was', 'solved', 'due', 'unwillingness', 'dismiss', 'daughter', 'found', 'characterization', 'parents', 'be', 'little', 'weird', 'one', 'scene', 'father', 'completely', 'down', 'convinced', 'Rachel', 'dead', 'mother', 'also', 'overwhelmed', 'room', 'leaving', 'young', 'daughter', 'comfort', 'husband', 'scene', 'just', 'struck', 'incredibly', 'odd', 'possibly', 'indicative', 'deeper', 'discordance', 'family', 'be', 'revealed', 'later', 'was', ""n't"", 'other', 'odd', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'family', 'was', 'told', 'Rachel', 'was', 'dead', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'outward', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'having', 'worst', 'fears', 'confirmed', 'realize', 'everyone', 'processes', 'grieves', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'jarring', 'scene', 'when', 'had', 'been', 'emotional', 'very', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'happened.That', 'Caroline', 'Reed', 'Robertson', 'most', 'life', 'been', 'miserable', 'full', 'self', 'loathing', 'dismissed', 'disliked', 'everyone', 'father', 'was', 'largely', 'absent', 'life', 'when', 'tried', 'reach', 'out', 'rejected', 'mother', 'grew', 'tired', 'continued', 'abuse', 'gave', 'up', 'dismissing', 'bad', 'seed', 'school', 'classmates', 'relentlessly', 'tease', 'torment', 'her', 'taunts', 'fuels', 'self', 'loathing', 'Who', 'how', 'started', 'Caroline', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'turn', 'Every', 'support', 'system', 'there', 'failed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'rejected', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'turn', 'hates', 'Caroline', 'Rachel', 'idyllic', 'life', 'afar', 'so', 'badly', 'decision', 'reason', 'sanity', 'kidnap', 'murder', 'assume', 'identity', 'Rachel', 'Barber', 'murder', 'scene', 'quite', 'brutal', 'raw', 'deservedly', 'stood', 'out', 'rest', 'film.Ruth', 'Bradley', 'amazingly', 'Caroline', 'mood', 'swings', 'depression', 'loathing', 'rage', 'short', 'lived', 'smug', 'surety', 'are', 'deftly', 'portrayed', 'completely', 'believable', 'performance', 'Simone', 'North', 'writing', 'direction', 'audience', 'sympathize', 'plight', 'still', 'being', 'disgusted', 'horrified', 'crime', 'lack', 'remorse', 'afterwards', 'also', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'piqued', 'interest', 'left', 'thinking', 'days', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easy', 'show', 'Caroline', 'be', 'one', 'dimensional', 'monster', 'show', 'person', 'unable', 'make', 'connection', 'others', 'effort', 'guts', 'Instead', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'passionate', 'responses', 'discussions', 'Simone', 'North', 'approach', 'story', 'highly', 'recommend', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film']",N/A
