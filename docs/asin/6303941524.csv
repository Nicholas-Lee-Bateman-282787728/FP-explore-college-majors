390784,A16GM9G38VTJMV,6303941524,RedConOne,"[0, 0]","Soldier Boyz, where to start? The plot of this movie isn't really believable at all.. It is about a humanitarian, Gabriel, who is captured by a post war north Vietnamese radical group. Oppose to what would really happen, a SEAL team sent to rescue her. It is decided that former Marine and Nam veteran (Micheal) will be contracted by the father of Gabriel whom is a millionaire. Micheal's character working in a correctional facility demands that he gets to take some of those prisoners with him and those who survive the mission get a full pardon.The movie seems like it wasn't thought out and was directed by someone who knew very little about the military and procedure. One small thing i noticed was Micheal's character is a former Marine yet the officer whom comes with Gabriel's father is in the uniform of a Army officer. While it is possible they did serve side by side in Nam it is unlikely that he would've be in direct command of Marine units which intern would be Micheal. That is one little thing i noticed about the film and how it delivered the story.This movie seems like someone watched The Dirty Dozen and decided to make a remake with a change in plot and setting. This movie is a lot of B-list acting and B-list action. It does have a few funny moments like when one of the guys was being questioned if he liked his MRE (Meal Ready to Eat which is military food used in the field).I cannot make myself waste more time talking about this movie. It was chalk full of inaccuracies, unrealistic fights, poor acting, mediocre action, and a completely unrealistic plot.Soldier Boyz is not a good movie it earns 2/5 stars.",2,Unbelieveable plot and bad acting,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,1635,"['Soldier', 'Boyz', 'where', 'start', 'plot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'believable', 'all..', 'humanitarian', 'Gabriel', 'who', 'captured', 'post', 'war', 'north', 'Vietnamese', 'radical', 'group', 'Oppose', 'what', 'would', 'really', 'happen', 'SEAL', 'team', 'sent', 'rescue', 'decided', 'former', 'Marine', 'Nam', 'veteran', 'Micheal', 'will', 'be', 'contracted', 'father', 'Gabriel', 'whom', 'millionaire', 'Micheal', 'character', 'working', 'correctional', 'facility', 'take', 'prisoners', 'who', 'survive', 'mission', 'get', 'full', 'pardon.The', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'thought', 'out', 'was', 'directed', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'military', 'procedure', 'One', 'small', 'thing', 'i', 'noticed', 'was', 'Micheal', 'character', 'former', 'Marine', 'yet', 'officer', 'whom', 'Gabriel', 'father', 'uniform', 'Army', 'officer', 'possible', 'did', 'serve', 'side', 'side', 'Nam', 'unlikely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'be', 'direct', 'command', 'Marine', 'units', 'intern', 'would', 'be', 'Micheal', 'one', 'little', 'thing', 'i', 'noticed', 'film', 'how', 'delivered', 'story.This', 'movie', 'someone', 'watched', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'decided', 'make', 'remake', 'change', 'plot', 'setting', 'movie', 'lot', 'B-list', 'acting', 'B-list', 'action', 'have', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'when', 'one', 'guys', 'was', 'being', 'questioned', 'liked', 'MRE', 'Meal', 'Ready', 'Eat', 'military', 'food', 'used', 'field', '.I', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'waste', 'more', 'time', 'talking', 'movie', 'was', 'chalk', 'full', 'inaccuracies', 'unrealistic', 'fights', 'poor', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'action', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'plot.Soldier', 'Boyz', 'not', 'good', 'movie', '2/5', 'stars']",Soldier Boyz VHS
