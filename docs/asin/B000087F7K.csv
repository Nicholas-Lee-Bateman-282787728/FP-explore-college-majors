(Of course, if you're reading this, you already know *that*...) So, getting released on DVD should be no surprise. But in sets like this? Please.Warner owns Rhino. And, if you've seen Rhino's cartoon DVD sets (which include Gigantor, G.I. Joe, the Transformers, and other shows), you *know* that that's a good thing. So, why doesn't Warner just pump out their own shows (and the other assorted cartoons they own) in deluxe box sets of about 25 eps apiece? It'd certainly be the best option, especially since this disc (which is, like the previous release, in production order) has four episodes that are fairly yawn-worthy.

Menta, Jr.","[9, 11]","Although I'm generally with the crowd that's clamoring for season-long box sets of this brooding, involving animated series, these single-disc offerings aren't all that bad.  In this case, for a few loose bills you get clean, sharp prints of episodes 6 to 9, a brief but interesting piece about the casting of the voice talent for the show, and nice intros to each episode by producer Bruce Timm.  Oh, yes-- you also get a little &quot;brain-teaser&quot; game to play, but even my forgiving self can't find it in his heart to praise THAT bit of byte-wasting silliness.Anyway, I imagine the suits at Warner Brothers figured that the low price would encourage lots of casual purchasing by the parents-throwing-it-in-their-cart-for-the-kids demographic, while rabid fans would STILL pick these DVDs up even though they're not the juicy, packed-to-the-gills-with-extras multi-disc collections they're climbing the walls for.  And I guess that strategy is working, 'cause I'M a serious fan and I'm buying these DVDs.  But maybe there's a better solution that can please everyone: namely, do both types of products.  Sell inexpensive single-disc offerings like this one AND season-long boxed sets with premium extras.  Put 'em both in the marketplace and let people buy what they want.But until that day comes, these DVDs could be worse.  At least the episodes are being released in chronological order, instead of being packaged in those horrible &quot;best of&quot; compilations that jump all over the map in time and leave huge gaps in your collection.",4,"Not the huge boxed set we all want, but still fun",1055376000,"06 12, 2003",2003,1549,"[""'m"", 'generally', 'crowd', 'clamoring', 'season-long', 'box', 'sets', 'brooding', 'involving', 'animated', 'series', 'single-disc', 'offerings', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'case', 'few', 'loose', 'bills', 'get', 'clean', 'sharp', 'prints', 'episodes', '6', '9', 'brief', 'interesting', 'piece', 'casting', 'voice', 'talent', 'show', 'nice', 'intros', 'episode', 'producer', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'Oh', 'yes', 'also', 'get', 'little', 'quot', 'brain-teaser', 'quot', 'game', 'play', 'even', 'forgiving', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'heart', 'praise', 'THAT', 'bit', 'byte-wasting', 'silliness.Anyway', 'imagine', 'suits', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'figured', 'low', 'price', 'would', 'encourage', 'lots', 'casual', 'purchasing', 'parents-throwing-it-in-their-cart-for-the-kids', 'demographic', 'rabid', 'fans', 'would', 'STILL', 'pick', 'DVDs', 'up', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'juicy', 'packed-to-the-gills-with-extras', 'multi-disc', 'collections', ""'re"", 'climbing', 'walls', 'guess', 'strategy', 'working', ""'M"", 'serious', 'fan', ""'m"", 'buying', 'DVDs', 'maybe', 'better', 'solution', 'can', 'please', 'everyone', 'namely', 'do', 'types', 'products', 'Sell', 'inexpensive', 'single-disc', 'offerings', 'one', 'season-long', 'boxed', 'sets', 'premium', 'extras', 'Put', 'marketplace', 'let', 'people', 'buy', 'what', 'want.But', 'day', 'DVDs', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'least', 'episodes', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'chronological', 'order', 'instead', 'being', 'packaged', 'horrible', 'quot', 'best', 'quot', 'compilations', 'jump', 'map', 'time', 'leave', 'huge', 'gaps', 'collection']",Batman - The Animated Series - Tales of the Dark Knight

I rate them right up there with lord of the rings and newsradio as best buys.If you don't want to dish out the money but still want to see a few great episodes from one of the top 5 shows in the history of earth, than I can barely recommend this, however 4 AWESOME shows.P.O.V.-A really differnt type of episode that seems a lot more like law and order.THE FORGOTTEN- A really touching episode that seems something like a western, but what am i doing trying to compare this show to something, it's an original.THE UNDERDWELLERS- Another very touching episode where Batman is helping out little kids froma man who like owns all of them.  Sort of a scary episode, but hey, it wouldn't be a show without a little suspense.BE A CLOWN- is one of the creepiest things I have seen since the movie the stepfather.

734990,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B000087F7K,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[8, 8]","""Batman - The Animated Series - Tales of the Dark Knight"" contains episodes 6 to 9. These are really good episodes that contain villains like The Joker and The Sewer King.The episodes are:6) The Underdwellers: This is a very Oliver Twist like tale, where children are made to work like slaves underground for the Sewer King. People think that leprechauns are stealing from them at night, but it is actually these homeless children. Batman captures a child and takes him to his mansion. He asks for information on the Sewer King, but the boy is unable to talk. Will Batman be able to find the Sewer King and save the kids in time?I really liked this episode because of the well balanced action (fight with the crocodiles) and comic relief (Alfred trying to take care of the boy). (5/5).7) P.O.V - This episode starts off with Officer Montoya and Officer Wilkes driving to an abandoned warehouse to meet Detective Bullock. Their operation is to catch a drug lord and his gang. However, by the time they reach there, the warehouse is on fire, and Bullock is outside, unconscious. Montoya and Wilkes go in to see if the gang is still in the warehouse. Afterwards, during the rest of the episode, the 2 officers and the detective narrate what they saw at the warehouse, but only one of them is telling the truth.This is a very different and interesting episode, not because of its storyline, but because of the way it is told, through three people. (4/5).8) Forgotten - Another wonderful episode! This episode starts with Bruce Wayne, working in a community center. He finds out that some of the volunteers and homeless people have been disappearing. Bruce wants to find out about the disappearance (because the police are not concerned about homeless people), so he disguises himself as a poor man and walks around the street corners. However, he is hit in the head by some thugs, and when he wakes up, he finds himself in some sort of a penitentiary headed by Boss Biggis, in the middle of nowhere. Even worse, he doesn't seem to remember who he is or where he's from!The main reason I found this episode so good was because we get to see how Bruce Wayne would defend himself and fight crime as himself and not as Batman (5/5).9) Be a Clown - Mayor Hill is holding a birthday party for his son, Jordan. However, Jordan feels disconnected with his father because his dad never spends time with him. He is interested in becoming a magician, but his father is too busy with his elections to know this. Meanwhile, The Joker has his own plans for ruining the Mayor's party. He dresses up as Jekko the Clown and comes to the party. Jordan is fascinated by Jekko and runs away with him to the circus. Will Batman be able to save Jordan from the Joker's evil schemes?This episode is once again the fight between Batman and the Joker, and is another amazing episode! The Joker always puts Batman in situations where it seems impossible for Batman to escape from. The scene where Batman is suspended inside the water-filled box, and the rollercoaster scenes were great! (5/5)Although these episodes are already in the volume seasonal box sets, if you are a fan of the show you can still buy this DVD. The quality of the episodes is, of course, in very good condition, except that they don't contain many extra features in them. Otherwise, if you would rather have all the episodes in one set, buy the 3 volumes released.",4,"4 stars for the episodes, not the DVD",1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,3407,"['Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Tales', 'Dark', 'Knight', '6', '9', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'contain', 'villains', 'Joker', 'Sewer', 'King.The', 'episodes', 'are:6', 'Underdwellers', 'very', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'tale', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'made', 'work', 'slaves', 'underground', 'Sewer', 'King', 'People', 'think', 'leprechauns', 'are', 'stealing', 'night', 'actually', 'homeless', 'children', 'Batman', 'child', 'mansion', 'information', 'Sewer', 'King', 'boy', 'unable', 'talk', 'Will', 'Batman', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'Sewer', 'King', 'save', 'kids', 'time', 'really', 'liked', 'episode', 'well', 'balanced', 'action', 'fight', 'crocodiles', 'comic', 'relief', 'Alfred', 'trying', 'take', 'care', 'boy', '5/5', '.7', 'P.O.V', 'episode', 'Officer', 'Montoya', 'Officer', 'Wilkes', 'driving', 'abandoned', 'warehouse', 'meet', 'Detective', 'Bullock', 'operation', 'catch', 'drug', 'lord', 'gang', 'However', 'time', 'reach', 'there', 'warehouse', 'fire', 'Bullock', 'outside', 'unconscious', 'Montoya', 'Wilkes', 'go', 'see', 'gang', 'still', 'warehouse', 'Afterwards', 'rest', 'episode', '2', 'officers', 'detective', 'narrate', 'what', 'saw', 'warehouse', 'only', 'one', 'telling', 'truth.This', 'very', 'different', 'interesting', 'episode', 'not', 'storyline', 'way', 'told', 'three', 'people', '4/5', '.8', 'Forgotten', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'episode', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'working', 'community', 'center', 'out', 'volunteers', 'homeless', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'disappearing', 'Bruce', 'find', 'out', 'disappearance', 'police', 'are', 'not', 'concerned', 'homeless', 'people', 'so', 'poor', 'man', 'walks', 'street', 'corners', 'However', 'hit', 'head', 'thugs', 'when', 'up', 'sort', 'penitentiary', 'headed', 'Boss', 'Biggis', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Even', 'worse', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'who', 'where', 'main', 'reason', 'found', 'episode', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'would', 'defend', 'fight', 'crime', 'not', 'Batman', '5/5', '.9', 'Be', 'Clown', 'Mayor', 'Hill', 'holding', 'birthday', 'party', 'son', 'Jordan', 'However', 'Jordan', 'feels', 'disconnected', 'father', 'dad', 'never', 'time', 'interested', 'becoming', 'magician', 'father', 'too', 'busy', 'elections', 'know', 'Meanwhile', 'Joker', 'own', 'plans', 'ruining', 'Mayor', 'party', 'up', 'Jekko', 'Clown', 'party', 'Jordan', 'fascinated', 'Jekko', 'away', 'circus', 'Will', 'Batman', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'Jordan', 'Joker', 'evil', 'schemes', 'episode', 'once', 'again', 'fight', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'amazing', 'episode', 'Joker', 'always', 'Batman', 'situations', 'where', 'impossible', 'Batman', 'escape', 'scene', 'where', 'Batman', 'suspended', 'water-filled', 'box', 'rollercoaster', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', '5/5', 'episodes', 'are', 'already', 'volume', 'seasonal', 'box', 'sets', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'can', 'still', 'buy', 'DVD', 'quality', 'episodes', 'course', 'very', 'good', 'condition', 'do', ""n't"", 'contain', 'many', 'extra', 'features', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'episodes', 'one', 'set', 'buy', '3', 'volumes', 'released']",Batman - The Animated Series - Tales of the Dark Knight
734991,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000087F7K,Simon,"[32, 35]","For those who willingly bought the first BTAS disc in hopes that WB would release more, and with better extras, be prepared for a big disappointment. First of all, it's been a year, and this is only the 2nd disc we've gotten. Another disc should arrive in the fall, but at this rate, we'll have to let our sons and daughters finish the collection for us. 2nd, this disc only has four episodes, not even the five that the first disc gave us, and not six, which is what a DVD disc is capable of holding (see WB's Batman Beyond DVD). 3rd...the episodes are only so-so. Only one major villain is featured, the Joker, but it's nowhere near his best outing. Another episode features the one-shot villain The Sewer King, who uses children to commit his crimes. Despite an interesting premise, it's easily at the bottom of the barrel compared to other episodes. The last two, POV and The Forgotten, are above-average and give us a nice look at Bruce Wayne and the Gotham Police force. However, overall, these episodes just weren't worth the year-long wait.And extras? Forget about any good extras. Anything remotely interesting, such as Bruce Timm's intros, will be butchered into little segments that feel more promotional than informative. If you're a die-hard BTAS fan, you might as well grab this disc, since some BTAS is better than none, but just remember that it's a no-win situation: Good sales will only encourage WB to keep churning out poor DVDs like this, and bad sales will just cause them to stop production altogether.
