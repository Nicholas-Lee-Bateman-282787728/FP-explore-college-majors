857723,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00062WUQY,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 2]","Eerie, Indiana is one of those glorious types of shows for the whole family that they just don't make anymore. It's also one of those cult-like shows that many people missed when it was originally on. I have to admit that I am one of those people. I saw one episode. With a weird time slot and not too much promotion from what I can remember, it was just something that bypassed me and I never gave it much thought. Like a lot of people. I recently came across it online a while ago, and I knew that this was a show that would be right up my alley. After ordering my set, I am glad I did. Eerie, Indiana is a show that lives up to it's cult status and the reviews from it's fan base who clearly love this show. It's easy to see why.""Eerie, Indiana"" was an NBC show that aired during the 1991-1992 season. The show was about teenager Marshall Teller(Omri Katz), who moved to the quaint little town with his parents and older sister from New Jersey. His only friend is a 9 year old named Simon. Marshall quickly learns that Eerie is not a normal town. Underneath the Leave It To Beaver/Norman Rockwell exterior is a town filled with odd, eccentric people, mysterious places, unexplained phenomena, and so on. No one else sees it. The only one who believes Marshall is Simon. It's up to the two of them to stand Eerie's weirdness, and maybe get the story out to everyone else.Director Joe Dante(""Gremlins"", ""The Burbs"", ""The Howling"") is a cretive consultant on the show and a frequent director. It shows. Dante's quirky sense of humor is all over the place, as is his use of familiar faces(Dick Miller, Henry Gibson). At first, the show may seem to be targeted directly at the younger crowd, who are part of it's audience, but don't let that fool you. It's great for younger kids, but it's really smart, clever, creative, and mature enough for everyone of all ages. There is something here for everyone to enjoy. Plenty of jokes and sight gags for the adults tht might go over the heads of a younger audience. Plus, if you grew up on Dante's films or the creative quirkiness of kid's shows past, this delivers. Like I said earlier, it's a show they just don't make anymore. Dante and the rest of the directors have a sharp eye, and keep every episode fun and interesting looking, but the scripts are just as strong and fun. You'll instantly like young Marshall and feel like your with him on every adventure. The cast is a lot of fun too. Some performances are heightened to accomodate the bizarre, oddball, fantasy nature of the show, but it's all in good fun. Mid-way thru the series, John Astin(""The Addams Family"")joins the cast, as does James Marsters as the mysterious Dash X. You'll also see some familiar faces here and there Ray Walston, Matt Frewer, Danielle Harris, and even a young Tobey Maguire.So, what are you getting by way of episodes?. The series starts off with ""Forever Ware"", probably the most well known episode. Mrs. Teller comes across a neighbor lady selling tupperware. Tupperware that keeps things, and people, extra fresh!. One of my favorites is ""Heart On A Chain"", a beautiful episode. It's a tragic, gothic-like love story for the teen set. It's a wonderful episode. Elsewhere, there is ""The Retainer"", where a local resident's retainer begins picking up signals; ""ATM With A Heart Of Gold"" is an episode that has a town ATM that every town wishes they had; ""The Losers"" has Henry Gibson overlooking a mysterious place where every lost or misplace thing in Eerie ends up; ""Scariest Home Videos"" is a fun Halloween episode that finds the boys accidentally releasing a mummy from a movie; ""Just Say No Fun"" finds the adults at school wanting to suck the fun out of the students; Tobey Maguire appears as a ghost who want a long lost letter delivered in ""The Dead Letter""; Marshall finds himself in an alternate Eerie when he refuses to set back his clocks in ""The Lost Hour""; A scary tornado in ""Tornado Days""; ""Mr. Chaney"" finds Marshall becoming the Harvest King, and having to face off with a local werewolf legend; ""Reality Takes A Holiday"" is a clever episode with Marshall finding himself on the set of 'Eerie Indiana' and everyone playing themselves. There's more episodes here, but no need to go over every one. Just get the set and discover the fun for youself.""Eerie, Indiana"" is a pleasure. It was a joy to watch. I wished I had paid more attention when it was on. Combined with a poor time slot and the network just not knowing what to do with such a show, the series only lasted 1 season and 19 episodes. The 19th of which never aired, but is here on the set. There is a lot of genuine fun and cleverness at work here, and it's all in this delightful and wonderful set for the kid in everyone.",5,"Now Entering Eerie, Indiana",1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,4733,"['Eerie', 'Indiana', 'one', 'glorious', 'types', 'shows', 'whole', 'family', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'also', 'one', 'cult-like', 'shows', 'many', 'people', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'have', 'admit', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'saw', 'one', 'episode', 'weird', 'time', 'slot', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'promotion', 'what', 'can', 'remember', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'bypassed', 'never', 'gave', 'much', 'thought', 'lot', 'people', 'recently', 'came', 'while', 'ago', 'knew', 'was', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'ordering', 'set', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'Eerie', 'Indiana', 'show', 'up', 'cult', 'status', 'reviews', 'fan', 'base', 'who', 'clearly', 'love', 'show', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Eerie', 'Indiana', 'was', 'NBC', 'show', 'aired', '1991-1992', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'teenager', 'Marshall', 'Teller', 'Omri', 'Katz', 'who', 'moved', 'quaint', 'little', 'town', 'parents', 'older', 'sister', 'New', 'Jersey', 'only', 'friend', '9', 'year', 'old', 'named', 'Simon', 'Marshall', 'quickly', 'Eerie', 'not', 'normal', 'town', 'Leave', 'Beaver/Norman', 'Rockwell', 'exterior', 'town', 'filled', 'odd', 'eccentric', 'people', 'mysterious', 'places', 'unexplained', 'phenomena', 'so', 'one', 'else', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Marshall', 'Simon', 'up', 'two', 'stand', 'Eerie', 'weirdness', 'maybe', 'get', 'story', 'everyone', 'else.Director', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Gremlins', 'Burbs', 'Howling', 'cretive', 'consultant', 'show', 'frequent', 'director', 'Dante', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'place', 'use', 'familiar', 'Dick', 'Miller', 'Henry', 'Gibson', 'first', 'show', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'targeted', 'directly', 'younger', 'crowd', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'great', 'younger', 'kids', 'really', 'smart', 'clever', 'creative', 'mature', 'enough', 'everyone', 'ages', 'something', 'here', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'Plenty', 'jokes', 'sight', 'gags', 'adults', 'tht', 'might', 'go', 'heads', 'younger', 'audience', 'grew', 'up', 'Dante', 'films', 'creative', 'quirkiness', 'kid', 'shows', 'delivers', 'said', 'earlier', 'show', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'Dante', 'rest', 'directors', 'have', 'sharp', 'eye', 'keep', 'episode', 'fun', 'interesting', 'looking', 'scripts', 'are', 'just', 'strong', 'fun', ""'ll"", 'instantly', 'young', 'Marshall', 'feel', 'adventure', 'cast', 'lot', 'fun', 'too', 'performances', 'are', 'heightened', 'accomodate', 'bizarre', 'oddball', 'fantasy', 'nature', 'show', 'good', 'fun', 'Mid-way', 'thru', 'series', 'John', 'Astin', 'Addams', 'Family', 'cast', 'James', 'Marsters', 'mysterious', 'Dash', 'X', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'familiar', 'here', 'there', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'even', 'young', 'Tobey', 'Maguire.So', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'way', 'episodes', 'series', 'Forever', 'Ware', 'probably', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'episode', 'Mrs.', 'Teller', 'neighbor', 'lady', 'selling', 'tupperware', 'Tupperware', 'things', 'people', 'extra', 'fresh', 'One', 'favorites', 'Heart', 'A', 'Chain', 'beautiful', 'episode', 'tragic', 'gothic-like', 'love', 'story', 'teen', 'set', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'Elsewhere', 'Retainer', 'where', 'local', 'resident', 'retainer', 'picking', 'up', 'signals', 'ATM', 'A', 'Heart', 'Gold', 'episode', 'town', 'ATM', 'town', 'had', 'Losers', 'Henry', 'Gibson', 'overlooking', 'mysterious', 'place', 'where', 'lost', 'misplace', 'thing', 'Eerie', 'up', 'Scariest', 'Home', 'Videos', 'fun', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'boys', 'accidentally', 'releasing', 'mummy', 'movie', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'Fun', 'adults', 'school', 'wanting', 'suck', 'fun', 'students', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'ghost', 'who', 'want', 'long', 'lost', 'letter', 'delivered', 'Dead', 'Letter', 'Marshall', 'alternate', 'Eerie', 'when', 'set', 'back', 'clocks', 'Lost', 'Hour', 'scary', 'tornado', 'Tornado', 'Days', 'Mr.', 'Chaney', 'Marshall', 'becoming', 'Harvest', 'King', 'having', 'face', 'off', 'local', 'werewolf', 'legend', 'Reality', 'Takes', 'Holiday', 'clever', 'episode', 'Marshall', 'finding', 'set', ""'Eerie"", 'Indiana', 'everyone', 'playing', 'more', 'episodes', 'here', 'need', 'go', 'over', 'one', 'Just', 'get', 'set', 'discover', 'fun', 'youself', 'Eerie', 'Indiana', 'pleasure', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'wished', 'had', 'paid', 'more', 'attention', 'when', 'was', 'Combined', 'poor', 'time', 'slot', 'network', 'just', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'show', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', '1', 'season', '19', 'episodes', '19th', 'never', 'aired', 'here', 'set', 'lot', 'genuine', 'fun', 'cleverness', 'work', 'here', 'delightful', 'wonderful', 'set', 'kid', 'everyone']","Eerie, Indiana"

857734,A2QS6Y2IWZNQZK,B00062WUQY,J. Wood,"[0, 0]","This was another great show that envisioned the world through the eyes of a child, but in a much spookier way. As another reviewer put it, ""a Twilight Zone for kids"" and in many ways the inspiration for another one of my favorite shows The Adventures Of Pete& Pete, mostly due to it's dark humor and mysterious nature. Although it should be noted that Eerie Indiana is somewhat darker and scarier than Pete & Pete, just so that concerned parents have fair warning. Marshall Teller and his friend Simon Holmes investigate the strange goings on in Eerie and record them in Marshall's journal along with a cabinet filled with actual artifacts from their weird adventures in hopes of someday revealing it to the world. Especially since they two are the only ones that know of the darker side of Eerie and no one else will beleive them. It's a great show but the DVD collection was unexpected since it was only 1.5 seasons long. It's lots of creepy fun though, I recomend it for those who are into this sort of thing. (Update 8/26/06) I noticed a fellow reviewer mensioned an unfilmed pirate episode. They would be correct. I just found out about it on a fan site, which will remain unnamed for legal reasons. The episode was listed as #20 and I wondered to myself ""What the heck are they talking about? There's no 20th episode, there were only nineteen"". Thanks to my fellow reviewer I now know the whole story. According to the fan site the episode was called ""The Jolly Rogers"" and was about a crew of pirates who return to Eerie after many years to reclaim their buried treasure. It must have been in pre-production when the show was cancelled. To bad, it sounds like it would have been a good one too. Also, and I know alot of my fellow Eerie fans are going to hate me for this, I would like to see The Other Dimension get it's own release. I know it was pretty bad but I would kind of like to revisit Mitchell Taylor and Stanley Hope. Hey, you have to admit with Marshal and Simon's guidance they were okay.

My name is Marshall Teller."" Very much in X-Files territory for kiddies (plus a little of 'Malcolm in the middle' type sitcom), this was an entertaining and 'different' series in its day (1991 to 1992).My son (10) likes to watch these episodes, although I have to sit with him as he knows they are a mildly spooky. A few of the jokes must go over his head, e.g. lines mentioning Elvis Presley and the Twin Peak's 'Log Lady', but he clearly identifies with the likeable young boy leads (Marshall is 15 and friend Simon is 11, although they look younger). This DVD set looks and sounds good on the small screen and the special effects haven't really dated (there aren't that many anyway) - they have high production values giving a similar feel to that of the 1960's classic ScFi series 'Lost in Space'. There aren't that many episodes on each DVD, so obviously the series didn't outstay its welcome. I assume the plug was pulled during season 2, as there was an episode 'The Jolly Roger' that was never filmed. This DVD set has the eighteen screened episodes, with titles such as 'Reality takes a holiday', 'Zombies in PJs', and 'Marshall's theory of believability', and also includes the extra 'unshown' nineteenth episode 'The unbroken record' - which wasn't screened in the US until late 1993, a year after the original series had finished. In 'Tornado days', obsessed 'Howard Raymer' was also 'Max Headroom' (one of my favourite TV characters from 1987). Plus it's great to see John Astin occasionally (Gomez from the classic 1960s Addams Family TV series) as Radford.The storylines range from 'Forever-ware' plastic storage containers (a good skit on the 60's 'Tupperware' parties for those who remember them) to a particularly disturbing one on a child's metal dental-work bridge picking up the dark thoughts of dogs like an aerial. My son particularly liked the 'ATM with a heart of gold' (and this is just the first 3 episodes). Typical series quote : 'A haunted toaster, cool !"". Probably this series will only be bought by those who have seen it in their youth, but it still seems to be watchable for today's youngsters (particularly boys). So good value and highly recommended.

857745,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00062WUQY,Monty Moonlight,"[8, 8]","Marshall Teller is a 13-year-old with a fascination for the strange and unusual. At least, ever since he moved to Eerie, Indiana, which he believes is the center of weirdness for the entire planet. Elvis lives on his paper route, Bigfoot eats out of his garbage, and his sister is a goddess. Well, actually, that bit about his sister is just my opinion. Along with his best-friend and partner, 10-year-old Simon, Marshall keeps track of everything strange that goes on in the seemingly quaint little town, and more often than not finds himself in the heart of the weirdness with nothing but his wits and his sidekick to get him out.""Eerie Indiana"" aired on NBC from '91 to '92. I was in high school at the time, one year older than the show's lead, Omri Katz (probably most recognized as the star of Disney's Halloween film ""Hocus Pocus""), and I was an instant fan, though I can't for the life of me recall the time slot the show was in. Sort of a junior version of ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" and a predecessor to Night Stalker-inspired ""The X-Files"", Eerie was noteworthy as a highly imaginative show for the whole family that wasn't dumbed-down. The writing was smart and fun, and the acting was excellent! The show boasted some fine guest-stars and great continuity. Omri Katz was a fabulous actor (a shame he didn't do much other stuff), as was everyone on the show. And, yeah, I was and am still totally in love with Julie Condra, who played Marshall's big sister Syndi. The final six episodes of the all too short-lived series involved a retooling that replaced ""World O' Stuff"" proprietor Archie Hahn with the original Addams Family's John Astin in a cleverly written twist and introduced the new character of Dash X, a weird, gray-haired, self-interested kid with no home or knowledge of his past, played by a longtime fave of mine who gets much more cartoon voice work than live-action work, Jason Marsden.This DVD set is a fine collection for loyal fans of the show or anyone interested in the weird and unusual. Definitely a ""must have"", though the picture and sound quality aren't really what one hopes for from DVD by any means, and there are no DVD extras. All 19 episodes are included here, including one that wasn't aired in the original run, which is probably the reason it appears as the final episode in the set, despite being set before the Dash X episodes. Here is my breakdown of the episodes.Disc OneForever Ware: Marshall and Simon try to help the oddball twin sons of a woman who is inducting Mrs. Teller into her cult of Forever Ware sellers, but Forever Ware holds a very strange secret.The Retainer: In his nervousness about a trip to the dentist for a retainer, Marshall relays to us the tale of a kid he and Simon new who had a tragic experience as a result of his own retainer, a bizarre invention of the local dentist with the unexpected ability to translate the voices of dogs.ATM With a Heart of Gold: Simon makes friends with Mr. Teller's latest invention, an ATM with a personality of its own. But the ATM is so eager to make friends that he begins shelling out the dough to Simon every time he comes by.Disc TwoThe Losers: Marshall has to make a trip to the Bureau of Lost when he decides that recovering his father's lost briefcase may be vital to keeping his parents together.Scariest Home Videos: It's Halloween, and things are as weird as ever when Marshall and Simon have to deal with a mummy from an old movie that has switched places with Simon's little brother, now trapped in the television.Just Say No Fun: Eerie is losing its since of humor thanks to a school nurse reprogramming everyone with a fun-removing eye-test and matching glasses.Heart on a Chain: Marshall's crush on a cute girl with a heart problem leads to trouble when she gets a transplant from their mutual friend.Disc ThreeThe Dead Letter: Guest starring Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire, Marshall and Simon encounter a ghost who insists that they deliver a letter for him to his lost love, but the now old woman isn't willing to accept the message.Who's Who: Marshall and Simon meet a distressed girl at the World O' Stuff whose family is simply unbearable. When Marshall sees the girl has a talent for drawing, he buys her an Eerie-made pencil that unleashes some amazing abilities.The Lost Hour: Setting his watch back an hour, even though Indiana doesn't do the Daylight Savings thing, throws things off bigtime for Marshall, landing him an hour behind everyone else in an Eerie nearly devoid of life. Nearly.Marshall's Theory of Believability: Marshall and Simon are psyched to meet their idol, Professor Zircon, a paranormal investigator who is in town with his traveling museum on a mission to experience an alien encounter and make a whole lotta money on his way out.Disc FourTornado Days: During a bizarre town festival, Marshall stays home and has a strange encounter with a tornado rider determined to join up with Eerie's own annual whirlwind. The great Matt Frewer guest stars!The Hole in the Head Gang: While investigating a haunted house, one of many in Eerie, the guys discover a strange, homeless, gray-haired kid around Marshall's age with markings on his hand and no name or memory of how he got to Eerie or anything before that. In addition, they discover the ghost of the worst bank robber ever, Grungy Bill.Mr. Chaney: It's time for the town to pick a Harvest King, and most everyone is excited about it, but Marshall and the gray-haired kid know something is weird about the whole thing. The Harvest King has a great day, but at the end he must go out into the woods till he sees the Eerie Wolf, and it does seem strange that there are no ex-Harvest Kings.No Brain, No Pain: Marshall and Simon try to help a homeless guy with a scrambled brain who is being pursued by a strange women with some high-tech gear. The weird gray-haired kid is helping the highest bidder though.Disc FiveThe Loyal Order of Corn: Marshall and Simon are investigating the local lodge that Marshall's father has joined. They have a reputation for being more than just a group of men having a good time, and the gray-haired kid, who now calls himself Dash X, is already working there, so something sinister must be up!Zombies in P.J.s: When Mr. Radford is concerned about a visit from the I.R.S., a visitor comes into town to help him increase sales 100 percent, but at what cost? No one seems to get anything from him without signing one of his many contracts.Reality Takes a Holiday: Marshall is thrown for a loop when his reality suddenly changes on him. After finding a script to everything he and his family just said, he finds himself in a world where Eerie Indiana is just a TV show, he and his family are just a bunch of actors, and Dash X is scheming to have him killed off and take over the show! Yep, this is the real final episode.The Broken Record: In an episode that didn't air till syndication, possibly because of the more serious subject matter, Marshall introduces a new friend to his favorite heavy metal band, the Pitbull Surfers, but he doesn't anticipate how deeply obsessed with the band the boy will become. A victim of verbal abuse from his father, the music soon becomes an outlet for the boys frustrations, and that's not all. This one was supposed to come between ""Tornado Days"" and ""The Hole in the Head Gang"".""Eerie Indiana"" is definitely one of my all-time faves, and it was a hoot watching it all over again in this DVD set. If you are a fan of shows like ""Kolchak the Night Stalker"", ""The X-Files"", ""Twilight Zone"", ""So Weird"", ""Goosebumps"", ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"", ""Smallville"", ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show"" or anything of that nature, you're sure to love this! I also recommend fans of the film ""Hocus Pocus"", the greatest Halloween movie ever made, give ""Eerie Indiana"" a look. With the same lead actor riding around town on his bike trying to save it from weird dangers, it clearly has its similarities. There was actually a spin-off series of ""Eerie Indiana"" called ""Eerie Indiana: The Other Dimension"" on Fox in 1998 that followed a replay of the original show. Unfortunately, while I remember the advertisements, I never caught that show, which was apparently set in a parallel dimension in which the situations were very much the same but the cast of characters (played by different actors, of course) had different but similarly sounding names. That show's Marshall Teller was named Mitchell Taylor. Instead of Simon Holmes, his sidekick was a Stanley Hope, and Mitchell's big sister was named Carrie instead of Syndi. I hear it didn't have the same spirit of the original. Probably was dumbed-down for kids, though that's just my guess. Knowing that, my biggest disappointment in not seeing that 15 episode series is that another actress I have a big crush on, Lindy Booth, played the big-sis this time around.Anyway, do yourself a favor and pick up the original show. It's currently at a pretty sweet price for a 5 disc set of such a great, complete series. You also get to enjoy the beauty of Julie Condra all over again, as I certainly have been enjoying over the past week or so. And, if you like it, there are some books out there that continue Marshall and Simon's adventures which came out back when the spin-off series did. I haven't checked them out, but they certainly look intriguing! Wish they'd start up a comic book series now too!",5,Another show that shouldn't have been canceled!,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,9411,"['Marshall', 'Teller', '13-year-old', 'fascination', 'strange',

Omri Katz plays 13 year old Marshall whose family uproots him from New Jersey to the seemingly normal town of Eerie, Indiana.  All manner of strangeness abounds there and only Marshall, and his ten-year old sidekick Simon seem to know about it.

Here are some of the best episodes:""Foreverware"" perhaps the most famous Episode.  A local woman sells ""foreverware"" kind of like Tupperware that keeps anything fresh...forever.  Marshall soon learns that the womans children have been kept children for decades by sleeping in giant foreverware beds!""America's SCariest Home"" - Stuck having to baby-sit Simon's younger brother on Halloween, Marshall and Simon fool around with their video camera. Unfortunately they end up trapping him in a monster movie, while a mummy runs wild in their house.""Dead Letter"" Guest stars Tobey maguire.  While browsing the basement of the local library, Marshall finds an old letter. He opens it and a young man appears who won't leave him alone until he delivers the letter in person.""The Lost Hour"" - Marshal doesn't like the Indiana practice of ignoring daylight savings time, and sets his clock back an hour anyway. When he wakes up the next day, nobody's around... except some very untalkative garbage men, intent on sending him though the trash compactor.""No Brain No Pain"" - A strange bum is assaulted by a woman with a ray gun. distracts her until the police arrive, and then Marshall decides to help out a bum after witnessing him being attacked by a woman with a ray gun. It is difficult though, because all he does is mumble nonsense, and reassemble electrical appliances into bizarre contraptions.""The Broken Record"" this was the unaired show.  Marshall tries to get a gloomy friend to lighten up by showing him an album from the heavy metal band Pitbull Surfers, but soon the Eerie weirdness kicks in and the quiet overachiever is turned into rebellious headbanger.The picture quality is average and there's no extras..it's a Gotham release, so what do you expect.

It is long overdue for a DVD release, but with mega-hits like Friends, Frasier and Seinfeld getting the lion's share of attention when they come to DVD, it's easy to see how this gem of a show got left off the studio's to-do list.Now that it has finally been released on DVD it's time for fans of the show to celebrate. You get all 18 episodes PLUS a 19th episode -- the one called ""Broken Record"" --which never aired!!Now the bad news:The box set is a decidely low budget affair. The packaging, what there is of it, is bland and flimsy. The DVD cases are slimline and there is no booklet to speak of. Episode titles and descriptions are found on the back of each individually shrink wrapped case. It is a hassle to have to tear open all five discs after having wrestled with the box itself -- they went way overboard on the plastic wrap here. But that's the least of the problems...THE VIDEO TRANSFER IS NOT DIGITALLY REMASTERED! The video source appears to be from a good one-inch master tape. It is a little grainy in spots, but overall very good. But it should have been remastered.The sound however is not that great. It's listenable, but some of Marshall Teller's narration is obscured by loud music in the muddy sound mix. I also noticed that some of the scene fades don't fade out completely before the next scene starts, and that's just sloppy mastering on BMG's part.There are no subtitles, and sadly, no audio commentary track featuring the creators or star(s) or anyone connected with the show that could have shed some light on what we were watching.But my nitpicking shouldn't stop you from purchasing this great show. It is doubtful we will ever see it again in any form unless there is a clamor by fans to purchase it now. Maybe BMG didn't think hardcore Eerie fans would want all the bells and whistles the more popular shows are getting when they finally come out on DVD. Of course, they were wrong. We want it all. We love this show.Support this show by buying this DVD set.
