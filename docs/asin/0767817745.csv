His character is cold and detached, but at the same time he questions why he stills goes into the jungle to kill. He is a tragic and flawed hero. Yet he is also likable in some ways.  Billy Zane was the weaker link in the film, and that surprised me as I find Billy Zane to be a pretty good actor. The big let down is a total lack of digital sound. This is the type of movie that warrants 5.1.  But that aside the movie is excellent and a very entertaining watch.

14011,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,0767817745,Israel Drazin,"[3, 3]","Tom Berenger is the best US Marines sniper. He is competent and careful, and cares for the man who serves as his spotter. He has little patience with incompetence. He has seen people die because of it. He carries several dog tags of his spotters who were killed. He frequently plays with the tags as Captain Queeg did with marbles in the Cain Mutiny Court Martial, but not because he has a psychological problem, but because he feels this shows respect to their memory. Berenger plays his part well.So, too, does Billy Zane, a civilian who is assigned the task of being Berenger's spotter after his prior one is killed. Zane is an expert shooter, but has no experience as a sniper or spotter. Unlike Berenger, he has a psychological problem. Despite his ability, he is unable to shoot and kill a person. He freezes. While flying to meet Berenger, his helicopter is attacked by an enemy sniper. Zane has an opportunity to kill the sniper, but freezes. The man he fails to kill will soon be hunting Berenger and him when they enter the jungle to fulfill their sniper mission. This freezing happens again. Berenger tells Zane to shoot a man, but he doesn't do so. And, again, as a result, this man reappears later and tries to kill them. Thus there is tension between the two men.This is a well-acted action film filled with suspense: will the sniper team be able to fulfill its mission despite the strife? Will Berenger be able to save Zane? Will Zane be able to change?

I THINK THE SELECTION OF TOM BERENGER WAS RIGHT-0N FOR THE PART OF BECKETT  WHILE BILLY ZANE LEFT ALOT TO BE DESIRED. I WISH THE MOVIE HAD GONE MORE  INTO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE SNIPER TRADE SUCH AS ALLOWING FOR WIND,  HEAT MIRAGES, AND MOVING TARGETS, ALONG WITHTHE ADJUSTMENT OF THE TARGET  KNOBS ON THE SCOPE AS MANY PEOPLE SITTING IN THE THEATER DID NOT UNDERSTAND  WHAT EXACTLY WAS GOING ON AT TIMES.  I THOUGHT THE FIRST KILL IN THE MOVIE  WHERE BECKETT SHOOTS CABRERO WHILE HIS SPOTTER GIVES HIM DIRECTION AND  RANGE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ACCURATE OF ALL THE SCENES IN THIS MOVIE. WHAT  THEY ONLY TOUCH UPON IN THE MOVIE IS THE TERRIBLE FEEL YOU GET FROM THE  FIRST TIME YOU TAKE A HUMAN BEINGS LIFE.

His mission is to ""take out"" Columbian drug lords and return alive.  With him on the mission is Miller (Billy Zane).  The duo form a team that is in conflict from the beginning, which almost proves to be their undoing and threatens to kill either of them rather than the intended target.The conflict between Berenger and Zane is what makes the movie work.  The film provides a window into the world of sniping and all the rigors that are involved involved.  There have been a few other sniper movies, but this one is the best.

Crawford,"[3, 3]","The first time I saw this was the night Bill Clinton lost both houses of congress, after a night of drinking in DC with political junkies like myself.  It got me totally out of myself - I was distraught at the election results - and stuck in my mind as a must-have. I did not buy it until now, largely because I thought it was too expensive (I got a region 2 for about $5).  At long last, I have watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed it, though did see plenty of weaknesses I didn't notice before.On the positive side, the characters and acting are truly excellent, both Berenger (the wizened, calloused lifer) and Zane (the brash young man on the move).  They head into the jungle of Central America in a state of high tension, with Berenger unsure of the cocky civilian who is not being honest about his inexperience.  Right off, Berenger is impressed with Zane's instincts, and in a way takes him under his wing as he undertakes what can only be described as a suicide mission.  They meet an array of characters along the way, including a wily local Indian and a wonderfully mysterious stalker whom Berenger once mentored.  As the characters pretensions melt away as they approach their kills, the two men begin to strongly bond, though Zane remains murderously angry towards his guide.  THe climax, with unexpected dangers and some brutal fights, is very realistic in my view and well worth the price of admission.  This is an excellent war film, the first sniper film that I thought was believable, even if a product of hollywood.On the negative side, it is difficult to understand the terrain and even what exactly it is they want to accomplish.  It also did not make sense to me that the National Security Council - a White House bureaucracy - would send down an inexperienced hot shot (a clear violation of the law) when it has cold professionals like Berenger.  Finally, the ending is rather abrupt and without resolution.REcommended warmly.  This is great fun and fascinating.

I might have preferred a different ending, but I didn't write the story and it is a slightly different twist from the usual.  The only real problem I had with it is the total lack of any sense of humor on anyone's part and the wooden acting from several supporting actors that didn't need Murphy's Oil to show the grain.  Take a movie like Red, with Bruce Willis, for instance.  Lots of violence, but a ton of spot-on humor in just the right dose to leave you with a grin on your face even as you watch another half dozen bad guys slump to the ground.  Even Arnold manages to force some stilted one-liners into his tough guy roles.  We are talking movie violence here that everyone can participate in without getting dirt under our nails or that tainted soul feeling--not real violence that the world could do with a lot less of.  There are violent movies out there that are just grim and seem to have the purpose to make every viewer abhor any kind of war and violence.  Those are like an hour and a half of preaching and I doubt if I am the only one who doesn't like them.  This isn't bad like that.

They are foisted together on a jungle mission, and while Zane's character is *supposed* to be the superior officer, he soon learns that he is out of his element. Berenger's character calls him &quot;son&quot; as he leads him through the jungle, being simultaniously irritated yet supportive over Zane's inexperience.I found myself caring about these characters, and appreciating the contrast between them. While this film had flaws (the ending, while adequate, lacked a little &quot;punch&quot;), I still enjoyed the movie overall. The performances of both actors was good -- particularly Berenger, who does the &quot;steely emotionless&quot; thing quite well. Zane was also good at looking a little queazy and out of his element.I found this movie to be a worthwhile viewing experience.
