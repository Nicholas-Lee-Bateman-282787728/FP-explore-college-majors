384215,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6303651879,Andrew Raker,"[5, 5]","I really enjoyed watching this film, ""The Cure."" The acting was very good, especially Brad Renfro (""The Client"" ""Tom and Huck"") as Erik and Joseph Mazzello (""Jurassic Park"" ""Simon Birch"") as Dexter. However, all the major actors and actresses played their parts well.The film was not cheezy. There were a few scenes I think were overdone, (ex: riding a shopping card down a very steep hill) and one or two that were non sequitur, but I won't complain too much. Compared with many U.S. films created since 1990, this film actually makes some sense.The theme of the film was remarkably well-conveyed, the friendship developed between Dexter and Erik heartwarminging, and use of symbols (esp. Erik's shoe) fairly creative.I don't want to give away any scenes in the major plot. However, I think this film is certainly one that children and adults alike can both enjoy (although the language of a few scenes might worry some conservative parents).More importantly, the film does not preach yet conveys a few major ideas that some people (especially teenagers) back in 1995 might not have been certain about.1. AIDS is not transferable through the air (i.e. it is not like smallpox or even the common cold but rather much more like tetnus - except with no cure or preventative shot).2. Anyone can contract AIDS, including children through blood transfusions with contaminated blood.3.

Eric (Renfro), a rebelious teenager who gets into a lot of trouble befriends Dexter one day and before they know it, they become best friends. When they are shopping for candy in a local grocerie store one day, they see on a magazine that a man has supposedly found the cure for AIDS in New Orleans, so they quickly set out alone to find the man and get the cure that can possibly save Dexter.

But they become friends in the ol' Tom and Huck sense of the word - they're real devoted friends - the kind of friends you only have when you're a kid.

The character Brad Renfo plays, Erik represents the very essence of a truly decent human being. But hes just like every other kid in the begining. Facing the same fears and misgivings that existed in the 80s and early 90s about AIDS. Back then people knew so little about it and how it could be contracted. Erik is just as misinformed as anyone, thinking at the onset that if this young boy who lives next door has the disease then he must be a homosexual, and that he him self could be in danger of contracting the disease even in a causal conversation through a fence between him self and the stricken and shunned boy next door. None the less they become very close friends and Erik learns to become a strong protector of his stricken friend at all costs. Their bond is deep and loving, and the two of them set out on an adventure across 1600 miles of forests, rivers and roads in the hopes of finding a cure for AIDS. This is a believable and touching story that will move you and open your heart. Its a wonderful experience to see what the bond of a loving friendship can do.

And his only friend is his single mother, Linda, played by Annabella Sciorra.Brad Renfro is Erik. Erik is a kid that is sort of a loner at school. All the other kids at the school call him bad names relating to homosexuals. They also walk on the other side of the hall when he's walking by because Dexter moved in behind his house. He has a drunk for a mother and his father lives in New Orleans with his 23-year-old girlfriend.When summer vacation starts Dexter and Erik start up a friendship and they soon become best friends. They do fun things together and Dexter starts living his childhood as it should be lived. In their playing around they come up with unique ways for how to cure Dexter, but of course none of them work. One day they were at the supermarket and find a tabloid that says the cure for AIDS was found by a backwoods doctor in New Orleans. They tell Dexter's mom about this but she doesn't believe it.Erik's mom Gail finds out that they two kids are playing with each other. She is misinformed about AIDS so she tells Erik that he is not to play with Dexter and that she is sending him to summer camp. So Erik got to thinking that he and Dexter could go and find the cure in New Orleans so he could be aloud to play with Dexter. They run away from their home of Stillwater, Minnesota and sail down the St. Croix and Mississippi rivers to find the cure.This is a wonderful tale of true friendship. Erik and Dexter have a friendship more powerful than most people will ever experience in their lifetime. ""The Cure"" touches you deep inside and just makes you want to do something for the real children who are suffering like Dexter.Joseph Mazzello is great in this movie.

The two kids are excellent in their emotionally-laden roles, which was a pleasant surprise.  All the actors put in A+  performances.However, I found the movie fairly predictable, including  the evolving relationship between the two boys.  Ho hum.  It's definitely  not &quot;one of the greatest movies ever made&quot; as some of the other  reviews would have it, nor is it even close.In spite of elements of plot  mediocrity, though, the movie does somehow manage to illuminate the  undefinable beauty of a child's life, and the undiluted tragedy of a  child's death, in a very authentic and moving manner.I will confess that  I never tire of &quot;happily-ever-after&quot; endings, and I was rather  expecting one for this movie.

384249,ABLBRUT8DALNN,6303651879,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","The Cure is a very unique and touching drama from Children of The Corn director, Peter Horton. The film takes plays early on in the AIDS crisis, before there were effective drugs, in a time when it was thought that only homosexuals and drug addicts had it. Dexter (Joe Mazzello) is picked on to the point where he can't go to school and the only one who will talk to him is Erik. (Brad Renfro) While the film wants you to see Erik as pure and open minded, the truth is he's a loner who I don't think really understood the origins of the disease and why the other kids picked on Dexter. Both Mazzello and Renfro give outstanding performance for what must of been a hard film to work on, especially at such a young age. Horton defiantly made the right choice in selecting two young actors, who had been in major films prior to The Cure. An inexperienced cast probably wouldn't have gotten as involved in the role as these two did. Overall, the story is strong, the acting is top notch, and it's definitely a tearjerker, that's well worth the price of admission.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,1059,"['Cure', 'very', 'unique', 'touching', 'drama', 'Children', 'Corn', 'director', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'film', 'plays', 'early', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'were', 'effective', 'drugs', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'thought', 'only', 'homosexuals', 'drug', 'addicts', 'had', 'Dexter', 'Joe', 'Mazzello', 'picked', 'point', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'school', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'talk', 'Erik', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'film', 'see', 'Erik', 'pure', 'open', 'minded', 'truth', 'loner', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'origins', 'disease', 'why', 'other', 'kids', 'picked', 'Dexter', 'Mazzello', 'Renfro', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'what', 'must', 'been', 'hard', 'film', 'work', 'especially', 'young', 'age', 'Horton', 'defiantly', 'made', 'right', 'choice', 'selecting', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'major', 'films', 'prior', 'Cure', 'inexperienced', 'cast', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'involved', 'role', 'two', 'did', 'Overall', 'story', 'strong', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'definitely', 'tearjerker', 'well', 'price', 'admission']",The Cure VHS

To the teacher who posted below about showing this film to her students, bravo to her!  Young people....especially school children (a lot of who tend to be bullies and teasers which leave lasting scars) should be made to watch this film about true loyalty, friendship and unyielding determination to fight without giving up!  The performances by Joseph Mazello and Brad Renfro are unparalleled and truly their chemistry is captivating.  The performances of Annabella Scoria as Joseph's (Dexter's) mother is a gem.  Diana Scarwid as Brad Renfro's(Eric's mother) mother is a bit shallow, but that's because her character is ignorantly evil.  ONe thing I never understand, though.  When the boys take off on their own for New Orleans, Dexter leaves a note for his mother but nothing is ever mentioned about Eric's mother and her dealing with the boy's leaving.  Was she so wrapped up in herself that she did not know where they went?  They were gone for a few days.  Did she not notice that her son was gone?  She was going to ship him off to camp the following Monday after she found out his best friend was a little boy with aids.  The next time we see her is right after Dexter has died and Eric and Dex's mother pull up in front of the house and Eric's mother pulls him out of the car and begins to hit him, which is when Dex's mother really lets her have it!!
