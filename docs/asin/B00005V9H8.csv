I wan never fortunate enough to see Midge live, but with this DVD, I do get a chance to view him live (beyond ""Live Aid"")... IMHO, Midge is very underrated and hopefully some day he will get the recognition he deserves... This show was wonderful and the band members are brilliant.. Fan or not, buy this DVD and enjoy yourself...",5,Ahhh Midge...,1224288000,"10 18, 2008",2008,389,"['Hi', ""'ve"", 'been', 'diehard', 'fan', 'Midge', 'Ure', '25+', 'years', 'wan', 'never', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'Midge', 'live', 'DVD', 'do', 'get', 'chance', 'view', 'live', 'Live', 'Aid', 'IMHO', 'Midge', 'very', 'underrated', 'hopefully', 'day', 'will', 'get', 'recognition', 'show', 'was', 'wonderful', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'brilliant..', 'Fan', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'enjoy']",N/A

This is one of those serendipitous discoveries you make when you take a risk.It is just a really great concert. Midge sings with great emotional expression and the music is really full-bodied and up to date - even those older hits he covers really well. His words are poetic and reminiscent to me of David Grey.It is well filmed and there is really not a weak song on it.It also has one of the strongest starts I've seen to a concert.I am now won over and will be keeping an eye on him in future.He is also someone who would appeal to a wide range of agegroups.This is a 'Wow' rating from me.,5,A surprising gem,1101772800,"11 30, 2004",2004,676,"['havent', 'been', 'Ultravox', 'fan', 'bought', 'revisiting', 'Live', 'Aid', 'one', 'serendipitous', 'discoveries', 'make', 'when', 'take', 'risk.It', 'just', 'really', 'great', 'concert', 'Midge', 'sings', 'great', 'emotional', 'expression', 'music', 'really', 'full-bodied', 'up', 'date', 'even', 'older', 'hits', 'really', 'well', 'words', 'are', 'poetic', 'reminiscent', 'David', 'Grey.It', 'well', 'filmed', 'really', 'not', 'weak', 'song', 'it.It', 'also', 'one', 'strongest', 'starts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'concert.I', 'am', 'now', 'won', 'will', 'be', 'keeping', 'eye', 'future.He', 'also', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'appeal', 'wide', 'range', 'agegroups.This', ""'Wow"", 'rating']",N/A

This DVD does not have great sound (a bit bassy), even with playing with the audio set up.  HOWEVER, it does have some very good live versions of the hits that Ultravox/Midge Ure fans will appreciate.  ""Lament"" - one of the most beautiful hauting songs ever made is WONDERFUL here.  Simply - more synthesizers where used (I think).  It is great watching Midge during this song, as with all his songs - he and his fans will FEEL his music!Will we see Midge running around the stage like a Garth Brooks-type?  No.  Any background dancers?  No.  How about a fancy light show?  Nope.  Just a great concert that I wish I saw (even though I did see him live in Los Angeles awhile back)in person.Even though I wished he sang ""Visions In Blue"" and ""Reap The Wild Wind"" I will settle for this for now and hope that a new improved DVD will provide these great songs for us.Special Features includes the video to the songs ""Beneath A Spielberg Sky"" & ""(You) Move Me"" - both are good songs.  Also has interviews with him in regards to some of his hit songs, interesting tidbits here for you fans.Buy it, you'll like it...it will just wet your appetite to buy his other CDs if you already do not have them, and also wishing for a better sounding DVD in the future.",4,Midge Ure - Great DVD!,1057017600,"07 1, 2003",2003,1326,"['When', 'buy', 'DVD', 'music', 'demand', 'great', 'sound', 'fun', 'visuals', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'sound', 'bit', 'bassy', 'even', 'playing', 'audio', 'set', 'up', 'HOWEVER', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'live', 'versions', 'hits', 'Ultravox/Midge', 'Ure', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Lament', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'hauting', 'songs', 'ever', 'made', 'WONDERFUL', 'here', 'Simply', 'more', 'synthesizers', 'where', 'used', 'think', 'great', 'watching', 'Midge', 'song', 'songs', 'fans', 'will', 'FEEL', 'music', 'Will', 'see', 'Midge', 'running', 'around', 'stage', 'Garth', 'Brooks-type', 'No', 'Any', 'background', 'dancers', 'How', 'fancy', 'light', 'show', 'Nope', 'Just', 'great', 'concert', 'wish', 'saw', 'even', 'did', 'see', 'live', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'back', 'person.Even', 'wished', 'sang', 'Visions', 'Blue', 'Reap', 'Wild', 'Wind', 'will', 'settle', 'now', 'hope', 'new', 'improved', 'DVD', 'will', 'provide', 'great', 'songs', 'us.Special', 'Features', 'video', 'songs', 'Spielberg', 'Sky', 'Move', 'Me', 'are', 'good', 'songs', 'Also', 'interviews', 'regards', 'hit', 'songs', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'here', 'fans.Buy', ""'ll"", 'like', 'will', 'just', 'wet', 'appetite', 'buy', 'other', 'CDs', 'already', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'also', 'wishing', 'better', 'sounding', 'DVD', 'future']",N/A

I thought his Breathe CD was absolutely fantastic and Move Me was even better! His music always fills me with emotion. Powerful stuff. He is a brilliant songwriter and talented performer. His whole band on this DVD is pretty impressive. The keyboardist is wonderful. Midge's guitar work is also great. My favorite tracks were most of the ones from the Move Me CD. Monster is the most powerful tune! Alone is also a favorite. If you are a fan of Midge's work, this DVD will not let you down, so buy it!
