1491746,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B005LAJ16I,,"[1, 3]","HOMELAND is beyond phenomenal. This is a superbly written series with an amazingly talented cast. I had heard so much about this show and was hooked after the first episode. I spent several nights watching as many episodes as I could. I couldn't get enough of Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) and  Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis)and Brody's family.What a fascinating story to tell and I appreciated that the show follows one story rather than a new story each week. Finally a drama where we can go into depth and detail on characters. HOMELAND is seriously addictive.Danes has found her perfect role in Carrie Mathison - the psychologically troubled yet dedicated CIA agent. She takes her job seriously but psychological problems are always lurking. From a contact in Iraq, she learns that an American POW has been ""turned"". He is now on the side of the extremists.Out of the blue, a missing and assumed lost soldier Sgt Nicholas Brody is rescued in a daring mission. He has been held for 8 years and now he is returning to his wife Jessica (played buy the stunningly beautiful Morena Baccarin and two kids. His son barely remembers him while his ""little girl"" is a troubled teenager.There is a story in itself of a family trying to rebuild itself after the father has been missing for 8 years years. What on earth would that be like? HOMELAND explores that on some level but I think they did miss the boat on exploring it even further and deeper. The Brody family has to rebuild itself.Mathison suspects that Brody is the POW who has been ""turned"" but she has no hard evidence. Enter her superior and mentor Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin)as the only person she trusts with her suspicions. Amazing that she does not tell her boss or coworkers what her contact in Iraq told her. She goes on a one woman mission to prove Brody is now a terrorist bent on major destruction. HOMELAND plays this suspicion very well. We're never quite sure what Brody's intentions are and clearly, anyone held in miserable conditions for 8 years is going to have ""issues."" This also brings up another point. It seems that Brody is debriefed before he arrives home and is never offered counseling or help. I would suspect that both he and his family would need some extensive counseling but it seems like Brody returns home and that is that.It took me awhile to warm up to Mandy Pantinkin's character Saul Berenson. Berenson doesn't often say much but it is his expressions that tell stories. At first, Berenson seemed like an unnecessary throw-away character but his importance grows and Mathison falls apart mentally.There are several twists and turns in HOMELAND. The writers keep the audience guessing and not everything is what it seems. The show does seem to follow stereotypes as far as Arabs are concerned. Obviously, HOMELAND is employing There are several Arab and Arab-American actors, but most are terrorists or wannabes. Although a couple struggle with their consciences, we don't see many normal everyday people trying to make a peaceful life in the US.One thing we learn quickly in HOMELAND is that if an agent (Mathison in this case) promises protection in exchange for information that will stop a terrorist again, be sure to run and run far. One thing will surely happen when a person agrees to cooperate.Overall, HOMELAND is an amazing show. The story and twists keep the view captivated. Danes and Lewis are at the top of their game as actors. Season 2 leaves us wanting more. Nothing is resolved so the story continues.",5,"POWERFUL, AMAZING, ENGROSSING & PHENOMENAL",1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,3513,"['HOMELAND', 'phenomenal', 'superbly', 'written', 'series', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'cast', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'was', 'hooked', 'first', 'episode', 'spent', 'several', 'nights', 'watching', 'many', 'episodes', 'could', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Carrie', 'Mathison', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Nicholas', 'Brody', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Brody', 'family.What', 'fascinating', 'story', 'tell', 'appreciated', 'show', 'one', 'story', 'rather', 'new', 'story', 'week', 'Finally', 'drama', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'depth', 'detail', 'characters', 'HOMELAND', 'seriously', 'addictive.Danes', 'found', 'perfect', 'role', 'Carrie', 'Mathison', 'psychologically', 'troubled', 'yet', 'dedicated', 'CIA', 'agent', 'job', 'seriously', 'psychological', 'problems', 'are', 'always', 'lurking', 'contact', 'Iraq', 'American', 'POW', 'been', 'turned', 'now', 'side', 'extremists.Out', 'blue', 'missing', 'assumed', 'lost', 'soldier', 'Sgt', 'Nicholas', 'Brody', 'rescued', 'daring', 'mission', 'been', 'held', '8', 'years', 'now', 'returning', 'wife', 'Jessica', 'played', 'buy', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'two', 'kids', 'son', 'barely', 'little', 'girl', 'troubled', 'teenager.There', 'story', 'family', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'father', 'been', 'missing', '8', 'years', 'years', 'What', 'earth', 'would', 'that', 'be', 'HOMELAND', 'level', 'think', 'did', 'miss', 'boat', 'exploring', 'even', 'further', 'deeper', 'Brody', 'family', 'rebuild', 'itself.Mathison', 'suspects', 'Brody', 'POW', 'who', 'been', 'turned', 'hard', 'evidence', 'Enter', 'superior', 'mentor', 'Saul', 'Berenson', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'only', 'person', 'suspicions', 'Amazing', 'not', 'tell', 'boss', 'coworkers', 'what', 'contact', 'Iraq', 'told', 'one', 'woman', 'mission', 'prove', 'Brody', 'now', 'terrorist', 'bent', 'major', 'destruction', 'HOMELAND', 'suspicion', 'very', 'well', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'Brody', 'intentions', 'are', 'clearly', 'anyone', 'held', 'miserable', 'conditions', '8', 'years', 'going', 'have', 'issues', 'also', 'up', 'point', 'Brody', 'debriefed', 'home', 'never', 'offered', 'counseling', 'help', 'would', 'suspect', 'family', 'would', 'need', 'extensive', 'counseling', 'Brody', 'home', 'that.It', 'took', 'awhile', 'warm', 'up', 'Mandy', 'Pantinkin', 'character', 'Saul', 'Berenson', 'Berenson', ""n't"", 'often', 'say', 'much', 'expressions', 'tell', 'stories', 'first', 'Berenson', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'throw-away', 'character', 'importance', 'grows', 'Mathison', 'apart', 'are', 'several', 'twists', 'turns', 'HOMELAND', 'writers', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'not', 'everything', 'what', 'show', 'seem', 'follow', 'stereotypes', 'as', 'far', 'Arabs', 'are', 'concerned', 'Obviously', 'HOMELAND', 'employing', 'are', 'several', 'Arab', 'Arab-American', 'actors', 'most', 'are', 'terrorists', 'wannabes', 'couple', 'struggle', 'consciences', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'normal', 'everyday', 'people', 'trying', 'make', 'peaceful', 'life', 'US.One', 'thing', 'learn', 'quickly', 'HOMELAND', 'agent', 'Mathison', 'case', 'protection', 'exchange', 'information', 'will', 'stop', 'terrorist', 'again', 'be', 'sure', 'run', 'run', 'far', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'surely', 'happen', 'when', 'person', 'cooperate.Overall', 'HOMELAND', 'amazing', 'show', 'story', 'twists', 'keep', 'view', 'captivated', 'Danes', 'Lewis', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'actors', 'Season', '2', 'wanting', 'more', 'Nothing', 'resolved', 'so', 'story']",N/A
1491747,A106016KSI0YQ,B005LAJ16I,,"[1, 3]","Howard Gordon, the co-creator of this series, was the show runner for 24 during its later years, and this show seems very much the inheritor of that earlier spy series that reaped all kinds of awards and seemed to convince an awful lot of people that its events had some sort of bearing on real life. HOMELAND is not quite as daft as 24, but in its own way it is every bit as silly. The plot depends upon a Marine (Damien Lewis) released by Al-Qaeda back to his country: no one except the series' protagonist, a bleached blonde CIA agent with bipolar disorder (!) played by Claire Danes, realizes he's secretly a sleeper agent for the other side. His mission, as we learn fairly quickly, involves a plot against the Vice-President, who in whatever alternate world in which this series takes place seems to be the most important person in the entire country (he even addresses the nation on television after a preemptive drone strike in the Mideast). The show's writers can clearly create the rhythms of suspense superlatively, but so little seems to be at stake (the Vice-President???) and the characters are so outlandish that it's hard to believe so many people have taken this series so seriously. It is gorgeously filmed, and features some of the best acting in American television in the lead roles. Although Danes still uses the same vocal tones to convey stridency as she did fifteen years ago to play Angela Chase, she's marvelous near the season's close when her character is asked to convey both mania and despondency; the unusual British actor Damien Lewis is even better as her antagonist, the tightly wound Marine with all kinds of conflicting motives. The series' worst flaw is (again like 24 before it) it seems to peddle in deeply conservative anxieties. We are presented with scenes of the Marine praying to Allah (hidden from his family's eyes) and of a Saudi married diplomat visiting a gay bathhouse (with salacious photos of him inside engaging in who-knows-what) pretty self-evidently for shock value.

And there is plenty of tinsel wrapped around the show to convince people that this is somehow a realistic look into the world of counter-terrorism. Its somewhat like 24 at a slower and less hysterical pace. They could have used the plot for another series of 24 if anyone had wanted one.The plot is silly and unrealistic. The scheme is too complicated to make any kind of sense. Dana Brody is one of the annoying characers I can remember in a long time.The series is so stuck in 2005 that we even have ""evil vice president"" running around. There is a minimum obligation in this sort of thing to at least keep it up to date.The evil arab behind it all seems to run and revise his elaborate plots in near real-time. Every time he gets near success, he comes up with an even more implausable plot to destroy America(tm). But he isn't all bad because the US government killed his son.And best of all, the lead character is a mentally ill CIA agent on serious anti-psychotic drugs. Her mental illness solves one problem these shows usually have. Anytime she gets close to figuring things out, they can have her forget about it through the magic of selective amnesia. Better yet, mental illness gives them an all-purpose excuse anytime her behavior (or the plot) leaves reason behind. The way things are going, I would not be shocked if she became a terrorist for a season and then came to her senses after a coconut falls on her head.She is in many ways less any sort of character and more of a massive plot device with a built-in excuse for doing anything. I can't wait until she falls in love with Abu the terrorist in (lets say) season three. I bet she has about seven ex-husbands and 15 children that she doesn't even remember because of her bipolar disorder.If you liked 24, you will probably like this.

It is taken for granted, at least on the surface, that ""we were attacked"" on 9/11 by some entity other than our own CIA*, and that we are waging a ""righteous"" war against shadowy ""Abu Nazir""-types who are deviously living among us, just waiting to open up a can of jihad on our a$$es. Of course, as Noam Chomsky and others have pointed out, our wars of aggression are crimes under international law and the primary reason ""Islamists"" oppose us is our very presence in their countries, not some garbage like ""they hate our freedoms"".*For those who give a hoot about truth and reality, it should be noted that the recent much-ballyhooed (and highly questionable) killing of OBL (a.k.a. ""Abu Nazir"") was some very sophisticated propaganda. OBL was NOT wanted by the FBI for anything to do with 9/11 (Google his FBI wanted poster).As Col. Fletcher Prouty wrote in 'The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World (Second Edition):""Like it or not, we now live in a new age of ""One World."" This is the age of global companies, of global communications and transport, of global food supply and finance and...just around the corner...global accommodation of political systems. In this sense, there are no home markets, no isolated markets and no markets outside the global network. It is time to face the fact that true national sovereignty no longer exists. We live in a world of big business, big lawyers, big bankers, even bigger moneymen and big politicians. It is the world of ""The Secret Team."" In such a world, the Secret Team is a dominant power. It is neither military nor police. It is covert, and the best (or worst) of both. It gets the job done whether it has political authorization and direction, or not. It is independent. It is lawless.""UPDATE 11/27/11:The more I watch this the less I like it, so I dropped another star. In addition to being basically unbelievable in terms of its presentation of the operation and methods of the CIA, we're served up a pantload of terrorist bogeyman propaganda -- along with occasional views of some wondrous female body parts. Sex and Terror, America's new diet, now that Sex and Communism are passe. That so many seem to be falling for this nonsense is a testament to the effectiveness of the government/mass media ""war on terror"" propaganda effort. ""Enemies hiding everywhere -- even among U.S. Marines! War without end! Give up your rights and we'll protect you! Submit to the police state!"" Eisenhower warned us about the encroachment of the military-industrial complex, whose hold on this society is now nearly total. Ike is doing somersaults in his grave.UPDATE 12/6/11:Wow, is this show really starting to stink. CIA agents acting effectively as street cops! Yeah, uh huh, sure. Naturally, they routinely disregard the law, which is about the only true thing this show has to say about the CIA. I recently watched Steven Seagal inAbove the Law [Blu-ray] and it actually had more to say of a truthful nature about the CIA than this steaming pile, which I have now knocked down to a one-star rating. You know that when a Steven Seagal script kicks your rear, you should be hiding your head in shame. Everyone involved with this travesty should be waterboarded, then spend a lovely weekend in a CIA black site prison.This show doesn't even work as a drama, because virtually none of the personal relationships and situations ring true. And Claire Danes constant histrionics would go over like a lead balloon in any professional setting, particularly the CIA. If she's a CIA agent, then I'm the King of Spain.UPDATE 1/18/12SHOW OF HANDS: How many here buy into Carrot Top being married to that uber-hot babe in the first place? And how many here buy into that uber-hot babe instantly dumping the guy she was stroking and planning to marry just because a now-spooky Carrot Top shows up again YEARS LATER?

It's a great premise, but as with BOSS, it's way too modern for my taste. It would be more palatable if it was set in the 1940's or something. I have no problem with the sex/nudity; hey, it's good.

It is at least 4 stars.This series only has two problems, which I suppose the viewer can simply grant artistic license for their being in here.  Because otherwise the series is excellent.  Problem One: When we open the series we learn that Danes suffers from schizophrenia and is taking anti psychotic medication.  I find it extremely unlikely that the CIA has in active service an agent who has been diagnosed as being schizophrenic.  In an episode closer to the end, she is diagnosed as bipolar instead.  I have often read that the diagnosis differential between the two conditions is extremely difficult but there is no question that she has one of the two diseases.Problem Two: Mandy Patinkin is the CIA agent in charge of her.  He sees her in a bipolar episode and he then leaves her in place as an operative!  How could the CIA risk this?Ok, so let's assume that the CIA has somehow completely missed her illness in doing its background checks and that a senior agent, like Patinkin, would cover for her because of their years on the job together.  It's possible. I don't know if it is probable but it is possible.Once we make that leap, there really are no further problems. In fact, the problems make the series more interesting for we have two mentally handicapped people who are diametrically opposed to one another. One is Claire Danes, the CIA agent with extensive experience in the Middle East.  The other is newly returned POW Damien Lewis, who spent eight years in the hands of middle eastern terrorists.  Danes suspects him of having been turned during his incarceration and that he has come back to the USA as a terrorist himself. We see flashback episodes to Lewis during that period and he certainly has returned with an awfully advanced case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at the very least.  So now we have two people who started out as American patriots who are now suffering from severe and largely untreated mental illness.  It is an imaginative premise.  You have got to give the creators that.Add to this premise that these two are unexpectedly attracted to one another while at the same time wholly mistrusting one another. At times it is hard to figure out which is the hunter and which is the prey because they are both circling one another all of the time.  They are both finding out one another's weaknesses.If all of this interests you and you can make the leap towards believing in this whole plot, you will have a very good time watching it.",4,Terror On the Home Front with Two People with Mental Problems,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,2543,"['may', 'be', '4.5', 'Amazon', 'only', 'allow', 'use', 'whole', 'stars', 'least', '4', 'stars.This', 'series', 'only', 'two', 'problems', 'suppose', 'viewer', 'can', 'simply', 'grant', 'artistic', 'license', 'being', 'here', 'otherwise', 'series', 'excellent', 'Problem', 'One', 'When', 'open', 'series', 'learn', 'Danes', 'suffers', 'schizophrenia', 'taking', 'anti', 'psychotic', 'medication', 'find', 'extremely', 'unlikely', 'CIA', 'active', 'service', 'agent', 'who', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'being', 'schizophrenic', 'episode', 'closer', 'end', 'diagnosed', 'bipolar', 'instead', 'have', 'often', 'read', 'diagnosis', 'differential', 'two', 'conditions', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'question', 'one', 'two', 'diseases.Problem', 'Two', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'CIA', 'agent', 'charge', 'bipolar', 'episode', 'then', 'place', 'operative', 'How', 'could', 'CIA', 'risk', 'Ok', 'let', 'assume', 'CIA', 'somehow', 'completely', 'missed', 'illness', 'doing', 'background', 'checks', 'senior', 'agent', 'Patinkin', 'would', 'cover', 'years', 'job', 'together', 'possible', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'probable', 'possible.Once', 'make', 'leap', 'really', 'are', 'further', 'problems', 'fact', 'problems', 'make', 'series', 'more', 'interesting', 'have', 'two', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'one', 'One', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'CIA', 'agent', 'extensive', 'experience', 'Middle', 'East', 'other', 'newly', 'returned', 'POW', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'who', 'spent', 'eight', 'years', 'hands', 'middle', 'eastern', 'terrorists', 'Danes', 'having', 'been', 'turned', 'incarceration', 'come', 'back', 'USA', 'terrorist', 'see', 'flashback', 'episodes', 'Lewis', 'period', 'certainly', 'returned', 'awfully', 'advanced', 'case', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'very', 'least', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'American', 'patriots', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'suffering', 'severe', 'largely', 'untreated', 'mental', 'illness', 'imaginative', 'premise', 'have', 'got', 'give', 'creators', 'that.Add', 'premise', 'two', 'are', 'unexpectedly', 'attracted', 'one', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'wholly', 'mistrusting', 'one', 'times', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'hunter', 'prey', 'are', 'circling', 'one', 'time', 'are', 'finding', 'out', 'one', 'weaknesses.If', 'interests', 'can', 'make', 'leap', 'towards', 'believing', 'whole', 'plot', 'will', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'time', 'watching']",N/A
1491775,APTDA7GU7SUBG,B005LAJ16I,,"[55, 96]","Here's a recurring red flag that I always ignore, to my detriment.  When a piece of entertainment is described as a thriller, particularly like this one, a political thriller, and then all the reviews discuss primarily how it's all about 'characters', their development, depth, etc, then I should always know the plot is either underdeveloped, written as they go with no direction, or is otherwise hackneyed.So in general, we should have known that this was not going to live up to our hopes.Here are a handful of the warning signs we should have spotted early on:1. ""From the creators of 24!"" I know, right? 24 was super stupid with thin plots stretched over 24 dragged out 40-minute blocks.  Entertaining as hell for brief stretches until you realize they're writing it on thr fly.  Here they have a narrative arc, but it sure would have been much better as a 2, 4, even 6 hour block with a resolution.2. Evil mastermind!: (SPOILERS) Abu Nazir sure managed a clockwork plot here, eh? He knew Brody would be back in town for just a few weeks and would be in a locked room with the VP, the SecDef, the joint chiefs! Fascinating.  Figured he'd be asked to run for Congress! Sure good fortune that the old lady with the apartment overlooking the VP site happened to head to a bingo game in the hinterlands the night before the announcement too!3. The daughter!: From the creators of Kim Bauer.  God she was omnipresent and you just knew down the stretch she'd be present in every key juncture of Brody's evil plan.  Pickin' up my bomb vest? Hey Dad, what's that!? Praying on my prayer mat? Hey Dad, here I am! Puttin' on my bomby vest! Hey Dad, why's the door locked? Pullin' the trigger on my bomby plot! Hey Dad, PROMISE ME YOU'RE COMING HOME! IT WAS SUPER EASY TO REACH YOU IN THE BUNKER THERE WITH EXACTLY ONE SECOND TO SPARE.  Dumb-da-dumb-dumb.  If I were the CIA head I would hire the daughter cause she's super stealthy and everywhere!  Speaking of the CIA....4. Cut rate Dennis Haysbert! Anyone belive this guy as head of the CIA? Anyone shocked he was in league with:5. Nefarious Vice President! In fairness, this came up later in the run.  Bad actor plus totally implausible VIDEO OF HIM ORDERING SCHOOLCHILDREN'S DEATH?! REALLY?!6. Claire Danes is Bipolar! So you knew the scenery chewing was coming! Every time she took the pill, you knew she was eventually not going to have her pills, huh?  I MUST HAVE A GREEN HIGHLIGHTER!  She's perfectly good in this, and will probably win an Emmy and that's probably fine.  It's about characters mind you.7. Mike! The new dude who was all over the place for half the eps and then got beat up and disappeared! By the way, what happened to that dumb couple who were setting up the sniper house? They sure subverted stereotypes there, eh?8. The whole Brody family! See here again, I should know.  When my taut political thriller is going to involve lots and lots of family-home-life I no longer care.  I have Mad Men for that.So when we got to the end and Brody chickens out and tells Abu Nazir some new crappy plan and Nazir's like: yeah, PERFECT, shoot my other guy there and let's totally change gears even though my SUPER TRICKY PLAN SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN, but I'm cool, I'm cool, that wasn't HARD OR ANYTHING GETTING YOU ALL BRAINWASHY AND INTO A ROOM WITH HALF THE POWER IN D.C. AND COORDINATING WITH A MARINE SNIPER ALSO ON THE PAYROLL, GO AHEAD AND JUST SCRAP THAT, WE'LL DO THIS ON THE FLY.Stupid, stupid plot.  I see all critics are giving it a pass becuase Claire Danes and whoever played Brody are just so deep and 'broken' and ... whatever.

1491777,AQLPABVVH2WF7,B005LAJ16I,,"[8, 15]","Fear not, this review of the first season of Homeland is largely spoiler free.I'm always weary of new programs on TV. Not that I'm afraid I won't like it, stuff I think I won't like I hardly spare a thought for, usually it's the opposite. I watch a fair amount of TV, I generally don't want to add more to that list as I sometimes find myself hard pressed to keep up with the shows I've already put a considerable time commitment into. Recently I've allowed two new shows into that stonemasonesque inner circle, and Homeland was the standout of the two.I never saw AMC's Rubicon. It looked like it may have been interesting, but I heard bad things about it before I ever got into it, so I just let it go. Seems like it may have been one of AMC's rare misses. That said, the spy thriller genre seems rarely represented in television. Could be that in order to write a compelling espionage story is hard to do. Seems that way anyhow. Especially in a weekly serial format.Homeland pulled it off admirably. It was well written and well acted. I was continually left guessing as to what would happen next, trying to sort through clues and red herrings. I always had suspicions but never knew for sure what the truth of Brody was. I was always oscillating between thoughts of if he was innocent or a bomb waiting to go off. Literally.In some ways I have to say the show was hurt by it's marketing campaign building anticipation for the premier. If you never saw any of the promos they essentially boiled down to showing Claire Danes as the CIA agent and Damian Lewis as the soldier and told you that one of these people are a terrorist. That idea really intrigued me and I signed up for that theory, expecting to watch a show where we were presented with deliberately limited information as the viewer tries to determine who's the hero and who's the threat. Sounds interesting right?It would have been. Problem is that theory is only half true. It seemed pretty clear to me early on that Carrie [Danes] has some definite issues which may make her unstable and possibly delusional, but was no threat. That promise did hold fairly true to the Brody [Lewis] side of the equation however. You never really knew what to make of him. You knew something was up, you knew he was lying about some things, but you never really knew why. You were constantly being given clues and glimpses which would either hint to innocence or guilt. The inconsistencies of his actions could have been the actions of a terrorist covering his tracks, or just as easily a POW going through some serious stuff as he tries to assimilate back into a country and family which have grown strange and foreign to him after 8 years of imprisonment and torture.One other aspect that sat a little odd with me is the continuing nature of the show. Through the entire season it seemed to me that things were building to an explosive finale, one that would make it very difficult, if not outright impossible, to continue the show into further seasons. That concept intrigued and excited me. That this may have been more of a mini-series than a continuing show is something that you don't see often. In my water cooler talks of the show I consistently said that with the show progressing as it is, I can't see it being able to have a second season. Well, minor spoiler, I was wrong.Things didn't end quite as I'd expected. That's not to say at all it ended poorly. There were moments in the season finale that were some of the most tense moments I've seen in a long time. The suspense was incredible. Suspense may be the hardest thing to cultivate in a television show.

1491778,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B005LAJ16I,,"[8, 26]","The main problem with this show is that the characters are totally cheesy.  And the premise on which it's based is ridiculous and far-fetched.  Why is our main protagonist Brody, or Tom Walker for that matter, the way they are?  A dozen flashbacks will try to explain that to you - they are FAR from convincing.  Really, it's laughable almost what the scriptwriters expect us to swallow..  but apparently everyone thinks it's pure genius.  Beyond being unconvincing however, and a worse fault at that, is that many of the episodes actually drag, especially in the first good half of the season.  This is the kind of show that if you start watching, it's helpful to have something to do in the background until something semi-important happens in the story again as there's a lot of overlong scenes, syrupy music, more syrupy characters, and general padding that make this season, in its first half especially, a far cry from riveting.  Last but not least, the characters and dialogue often seemed kind of cheap and cheesy.  I wasn't much impressed with Damian Lewis.. his worst flaw wasn't that he was a turned terrorist, but that he was annoying to watch in almost every scene he was in.This show is total cheese.  I'd call it Swiss cheese cause it's so full of holes, but I'm afraid this grade A cheddar is American.  Or is it Kraft singles, the kind you get in the plastic in individual slices?  That's a good way to describe this show: overly processed cheap cheese for the masses, most of whom will mistake it for a quality product as evidenced by some of the 5-star reviews here.(SPOILERS)The other possible reason the show gets good ratings is that the last episode is pretty intense proving once again that all's well that ends well.  Some of the last episodes more worthy lines include:Brody: ""What if I had detonated that vest.. what would be different?  They'd have just replaced Waldon with someone else.""Nazeer: ""Why kill a man when you can kill an idea?"" He then instructs him to kill a man.Etc.I almost raised my evaluation for the series based on the season finale alone. But in spite of a strongish finale there were too many tepid episodes before it. Plus, and more importantly, there is the basic flaw of the screenplay which is that we're never given a seriously credible or convincing reason as to why U.S. Marine Brody would do this in the first place.  Because he saw the son of his tormentor killed in a bomb raid?  It just doesn't convince, and nor did any of the scenes that were supposed to provide basis for A) his love for Nazeer or B) his love for his son (he taught him English and they became close..).We're supposed to believe that the turning point for Brody was when Issa (Nazeer's son) and 80 other chldren were killed in a blast by U.S. military.  We're supposed to believe that he cared to avenge that evil to the point of giving up his own children/family/country and finally his own life.  I'm sorry, I don't buy it.And what was it that turned Tom Walker, the buddy he supposedly killed?  Did he witness an American atrocity that made him turn as well?  Or was Nazeer just a good hypnotist?

Grandly compelling and brilliantly performed, ""Homeland"" - over the course of its 12 first-season episodes - profiles an an American POW (Damian Lewis) who returns home to the U.S. as a hero, but whose reappearance causes upheaval within the family he left behind and, more importantly, draws suspicions from a troubled CIA agent (Claire Danes) who believes he may have been turned while in captivity.""24"" producer Howard Gordon, along with Alex Gansa, developed this reportedly loose adaptation of an Israeli TV series and, after the project was sold to cable outlet Showtime, went about differentiating ""Homeland"" from the weekly adventures of Jack Bauer. This included an obvious upping of the ante in terms of sexual content and language, as well as making Danes' Carrie Mathison anything but a Bauer clone. Instead, Carrie's dogged pursuit of the truth is contrasted with her bi-polar disorder, which threatens not only her health but jeopardizes her job with the CIA. Her constant questioning of what she witnesses is amplified by her own self-doubts about her mental health, adding to the already powerful dramatic impact of the series.Danes has rightly been praised (and has already earned a Golden Globe with a possible Emmy on the horizon) for her performance here, and she's backed up by equally impressive work from Lewis, whose often placid exterior houses a turbulent, possibly villainous force within. His Nicholas Brody struggles to readjust to his wife (the lovely Morena Baccarin) and two children, while mysteriously vanishing to practice Islam outside of their view - but is his new faith the result of a spiritual reawakening that occurred while he was in captivity, or the fallout from Al Qaeda brainwashing? Brody's main motives are slowly unraveled throughout the first season, culminating in a fever pitch of tension and suspense in the season finale. Mandy Patinkin, meanwhile, is also outstanding as Carrie's father-figure boss, who tries to reconcile her brilliant methodology with a turbulent personal life that he hides from his superiors at the agency.I can't say enough about how entertaining, suspenseful, intelligent and compelling ""Homeland"" is - and now that the series is on Blu-Ray, there's no reason to miss it.Fox's three-disc BD set includes the first season of ""Homeland"" in excellent 1080p AVC encoded transfers with 5.1 DTS MA soundtracks. Extras include deleted scenes, commentary on the pilot and a half-hour behind-the-scenes featurette, plus an extended storyline integrated into the episodes.

There are no words to describe the exceptional quality of this superb drama.  It truly deserved to win the Emmy for Best Drama series.  Many say it is an alternative to the show 24 for viewers in need of an addictive action show.  This show is indeed addictive and also indeed an action tour de force.  But instead the story it tells is very timely and realistic to the current world problems.  It deals with terrorism and the CIA and provides an excellent backdrop into the subject matter that most viewers aren't aware of.The basic plot is that CIA agent Carrie Mathison (played by Claire Daines) suspects that returning resued American POW Nicholas Brody (played by Damian Lewis) is actually working for Al Qaeda and planning on assisting in another attack on the US.  This in itself is a heartsopping enthralling story but Homeland does something new and amazing here.  It deals with mental illness with the seriousness and the realism it deserves.  Carrie is Bipolar and her illness is a huge part of the show.  Bipolar is shown in exceptional dettail as to how its sufferers go from amazing manic highs to severe depressive lows and many spots in between.  The writers do a superb job on every aspect of this show but the true shining star is Claire Danes.  She brings an intelligent intensity to the character of Carrie and her performance is truly spellbinding.  She also brings true awareness to Bipolar as not just a plot twist but as an illness many don't understand.  She becomes Carrie and the Emmy she won was truly deserved.  Damian Lewis also won an Emmy and is also excellent.The blu ray indeed far surpasses the dvd in video and audio presentation.  The show provides excellent quality when viewed on tv in HD but the blu ray takes that and raises the bar by 100%.  The clarity of facial expressions, scenery and environment is great.  The black/white ratio is excellent and colors are pure and strong while flesh tones are realistic and crisp.  Close ups are amazing.  This show is dialogue driven and the audio is also excellent.  All dialogue is strong and clear and the surround speakers are utilized strong and realistically when action does happen.

It not only is my taste, it surpasses my desire for thrills and surprises. Claire Danes does an excellent job playing all three facets of her personality: manic, depressed and controlled by medication. Damian Lewis also expresses a huge range of emotions (and non-emotion) exceptionally well. The story lines are so interesting that I cannot wait for the new season.

Unfortunately the series went downhill fast from there. Where else the writers could have gone I am not sure, but what I do know is their choices took matters in the wrong direction. The acting in Homeland was superb, with some deft performances by professionals at the peak of their craft. Likewise the locations really looked like Iraq reduced to a war zone. Even the inner workings of the intelligence community were convincing. What went wrong was not about Homeland's visuals or cast, blame lies in its resolution, which squandered the brilliance of the show's beginning. The climax of season one was not only all wrong in terms of what we wanted to see unfold, but it mandated a degree of credulity that was almost insulting.

Suffice to say, I watched the first season in two days (would have been less if I didn't have to work!) and am so very addicted to this series.Enough can not be said about the two leads of the show, Claire Danes and Damian Lewis. The former plays a neurotic and off-the-rails intelligence analyst for the CIA, while Lewis, the focal point of the series, plays a U.S. Marine who returns home after being a POW for eight years. Both actors play their part with ferocious intensity and are more than deserving of the Emmy awards they took home. The show also boasts a very strong supporting cast, including Mandy Patinkin as Danes' boss and Morena Baccarin as Lewis' wife.In addition to great actors giving powerful performances, Homeland will keep you guessing all the way up until the season finale. It's very tense and there were multiple times I found myself on the edge of my couch. The show is so great because it works beyond being a tense thriller, and is a great narrative of how difficult it is for soldiers to return home. There is a great family dynamic that unfolds through the first season, and I hope to see it develop more in future episodes.The bottom line is that I can't say enough good things about Homeland.

And wow, am I glad I waited.  If I had to wait every week to see the next episode, I would have gone crazy!  This show is super intense, action-packed, and surprising.I was a little skeptical at first of Claire Danes as a CIA agent.  It felt odd to me and I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.  However, Danes gives a wonderful performance, and it's shown more and more throughout the season.  Her character, Carrie, has some mental issues, and Danes acting in these scenes is incredible.  She just gets better as the season progressives.The premise is simple enough.  A POW marine named Nick Brody who has been imprisoned for about seven years is found by the American government.  Carrie was told months earlier that there was a POW that turned.  Because his partner died during imprisonment and Brody is the only known POW, Danes assumes that he must be the terrorist.  The whole season is based on that.One of the main questions of the whole show is - Is Brody a terrorist or not?  Damian Lewis plays Brody, and I have to say, he is one creepy and amazing actor.  The dynamics of his family when he returns is also very interesting.  Can you imagine your spouse coming back to you after thinking he was dead, and your children practically don't remember him?This show has themes of country allegiance, loyalty, the importance of family, mental illness, and even love.  It is the perfect combination of suspense and relationships.  However, you will literally be waiting for every episode with bated breath.  It just gets better and better!  I watched all episodes in a row and was up until about 7 in the morning.  I just couldn't stop.Any downsides?  Well, I do wish a few more questions were answered.  I know we need to have things to look forward to, but I felt like the final episode was anti-climactic.  Also, I can't completely judge the show until those questions ARE answered, and we see how the writers choose to move the story along.  This season was so good, that it's going to be very difficult to top it.I'm not even really into the whole terrorist/CIA/government type of show, but I was totally drawn into this.

'Homeland' is the US version of an Israeli show, 'Prisoners of War.'  The US protagonist is a conflation of two Israelis (in 'POW'), and his nemesis is a conflation of multiple characters.  It is a good US series, but it pales by comparison to the Israeli, which shows the government's basic skepticism and mistrust of its own returnees (who have been held so long--17 years--that most consider them dead and are shocked when they are returned).  In this version, they are traded for Palestinians who have killed many Israelis (restaurant/bus bombings) and so their own people are divided about the sacrifice the country made to get them back (remember, this is land of only 6 Million--everyone is loosely connected to everyone else).  The relationships in the Israeli version are at once far more subtle and yet clearer cut.  The Israeli version also only had ten episodes (5 in US Hulu 'run').  Running off into 'Manchurian Candidate' mode may save 'Homeland'--or not.  I also have to admit that making the female lead an overanxious, somewhat paranoid and perhaps psychotic woman (one character in the Israeli version goes transiently psychotic over her brother's 'death') seemed misogynistic and a 'stretch'--would an agency really keep a woman like her?I'll wait and see how it plays out, but so far it seems another US version of a foreign movie/series which is doomed to be inferior to its original.",3,Disappointed,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,1526,"['started', 'great', 'anticipation', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'something', ""'d"", 'seen', 'checked', 'Yes', ""'Homeland"", 'US', 'version', 'Israeli', 'show', ""'Prisoners"", 'War', 'US', 'protagonist', 'conflation', 'two', 'Israelis', ""'POW"", 'nemesis', 'conflation', 'multiple', 'characters', 'good', 'US', 'series', 'comparison', 'Israeli', 'government', 'basic', 'skepticism', 'mistrust', 'own', 'returnees', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'held', 'so', 'long', '17', 'years', 'most', 'consider', 'dead', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', 'are', 'returned', 'version', 'are', 'traded', 'Palestinians', 'who', 'have', 'killed', 'many', 'Israelis', 'restaurant/bus', 'bombings', 'so', 'own', 'people', 'are', 'divided', 'sacrifice', 'country', 'made', 'get', 'back', 'remember', 'land', 'only', '6', 'Million', 'everyone', 'loosely', 'connected', 'everyone', 'else', 'relationships', 'Israeli', 'version', 'are', 'once', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'yet', 'clearer', 'cut', 'Israeli', 'version', 'also', 'only', 'had', 'ten', 'episodes', '5', 'US', 'Hulu', ""'run"", 'Running', 'off', ""'Manchurian"", 'Candidate', 'mode', 'may', 'save', ""'Homeland"", 'not', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'making', 'female', 'lead', 'overanxious', 'somewhat', 'paranoid', 'perhaps', 'psychotic', 'woman', 'one', 'character', 'Israeli', 'version', 'transiently', 'psychotic', 'brother', ""'death"", 'seemed', 'misogynistic', ""'stretch"", 'would', 'agency', 'really', 'keep', 'woman', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'so', 'far', 'US', 'version', 'foreign', 'movie/series', 'doomed', 'be', 'inferior', 'original']",N/A

It does draw you in, and you want to return to find out what will happen to these characters. Mission accomplished, then.Homeland is more realistic than 24, more human, more deliberately paced for the most part. The writing and acting are top notch. The first season is a solid success, and I surely hope the show won't go off the rails in seasons to come.I'm taking one star off for the basic premises behind the main characters -- the Marine Brody and the CIA gal Carrie Mathison. Could someone actually rise to that level in the CIA while keeping secret her mental condition and the drugs she had to take daily to keep it under suppression? Could a Marine actually contemplate an act of terrorist revenge at the cost of tearing his own family apart? I won't reveal the answer, but the audience is being asked to contemplate the possibility. We are kept guessing, of course, but this is what we're asked to buy. For me, it's a bridge too far. I can imagine some Marines being quite offended at the show even floating the concept. In this respect, maybe Brody and Mathison are at their core as unreal as the indestructible Jack Bauer in 24.Apart from that problem with the premise, everything proceeds on an even keel, deliberately building the story, the conflict, and the suspense. The plot is very clever. It's escapist entertainment at the peak of the spy genre.Perhaps I also balk at the show's hints of a moral equivalence between our military actions and the actions of terrorists like the Abu Nazir character in Homeland. This is to be expected from the entertainment industry these days, but you don't have to be some sort of jingoist to notice it and be at least a little put off.

1491886,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005LAJ16I,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Episode 1 of the second season of  HOMELAND has been aired and from the initial episode it appears that this will be an intensely interesting, psychological thriller. All of the ingredients seem to be present - fine writing (Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff), fast paced direction by Michael Cuesta, and a very strong cast including Claire Danes in one of her most challenging roles, Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin.The concept is very much in the public eye at this point - a study of how terrorists are followed and found and how the US Intelligence Service functions. The first episode introduces all of the main characters and fleshes out in a single episode the clues for all of the complicated substories and subplots that the series promises. After eight years absence Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) was thought MIA but is discovered in a filthy cell in Iraq ad brought back to the US in a Marine Victory parade. Brody had been captured with another Marine who was beaten to death and the reasons why Brody survived and his fellow Marine didn't makes CIA agent Carrie Anderson (Claire Danes) suspicious - could Brody have sold out to Iraqi bad guy Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) and that is how he survived torture and captivity? Anderson is driven to see if her concept is correct, gains the backing of her boss Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin, and successfully fills Brody's house with surveillance equipment so his every move can be observed. The sidebars include the fact that in Brody's absence his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) has fallen in love with Brody's best friend, and in the intense questioning and shock of being back home Brody begins to remember events of his capture and imprisonment including the fact that he was the one who beat his fellow Marine to death at the behest of Abu Nasir. Brody's physical condition and body language also give signs that perhaps Anderson's concepts that Brody sold out to Abu Nazir and is plotting an attack on America are viable. The stinger is that Carrie is discovered as being on antipsychotic medication since a young girl - making her contributions to intelligence under suspicion. She undergoes therapy including electroshock therapy, lives with her compassionate sister, and since she had stange and seemingly dangerous behaviors she has been let go from her work as an agent. Now with the second season we find a recuperated Carrie, a more convincing Brody who becomes a candidate for Vice President and  is now open with his wife and daughter about his conversion to Islam, and once again the numbers of events that occur in rapid fire sequence keep us glued to the story.It appears that this is another very strong season: the three main characters are exceptionally strong.

Guentert ""Christian Independent""","[0, 0]","Another lunatics running the asylum story making for good TV, and  pretty interesting for fiction, with the plot twists, but scary to think that these characters could be responsible for the fate of our country.If even based slightly on fact, it is no wonder that JFK was ready to divide up the CIA and place any significant sized operations (like the Bay of Pigs fiasco) under the military in the early 1960s.  His  mistake was not firing enough rogue operators like James Angleton and Howard Hunt along with Dulles, Cabbel, and Bissel.  It was probably a great idea to return some structure to an unaccountable agency that exploits people on all sides.The story shows that the people at the top levels of authority are the least trustworthy, all seem capable of betraying each other, the least trustworthy seem to be trusted the most, and there seems to be only a minimal counter-intelligence operation.  Moles like Hanson in the FBI and Pollard in the CIA do far more damage stealing secrets than a few assassins only removing political targets who are easily replaced with anothers willing to sell their soul to special interests.I am having a hard time understanding the agenda of this show, but I'm sure there is one, like losing individual rights and enforcement of the CIA charter is less important than ""national security"".  9/11/2001 reduced my trust in the government's ability to provide protection from attack by using all the defense assets and measures they already had in place, and to instead create a climate of fear and ""incompetance"".If you can enjoy the story as pure fiction, it is worth watching, but  I get the feeling we would be better off without the CIA illegally operating in the US and letting the FBI handle these cases.

1491902,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAJ16I,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[76, 90]","Howard Gordon, the co-showrunner of 24, and Alex Ganza, also a veteran of 24 as well as THE X-FILES and ENTOURAGE have crafted an extremely realistic, compelling, and tense journey into the hunt for a terrorist who may or may not have allies on US soil. There have been several comparisons to 24 in that both shows are about hunting terrorists, but that is where the comparisons end. 24 was an adrenaline blast of gunfights, car chases, explosions, conspiracy, super-technology and an indestructible government agent from a fake government agency named Jack Bauer. And while I miss Jack Bauer, I welcome the addition of CIA Case Officer Carrie Mathison (the INCREDIBLE Claire Danes) to the hunt. I also welcome the distinct lack of orgiastic violence (not knocking it, necessarily) and chases and ""action"". What THE WIRE is to most cop shows like SVU or CSI or NCIS, HOMELAND is to 24, but the main difference is while shows like SVU and CSI are lame and cliched procedurals, 24 was actually quite a powerful show. HOMELAND and 24 are both terrific shows, but for different reasons. We like 24 because it gives us that immediate sense of satisfaction of knowing that the bad guys are going to end up very dead just about every episode; we like HOMELAND because it takes the same concept to a much grittier, much smarter and MUCH more realistic conclusion.With this show, we have Mathison, informed years prior by someone on the inside of a terror network, that a U.S. soldier that is being held prisoner has been turned by master terrorist Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban, another veteran of 24) and intends an attack using this soldier. Years later, Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Masterfully played by Damian Lewis) is rescued from an Iraqi compound after eight years. Not only does this affect Carrie, who has kept her ear to the ground ever since, but it also affects the family of Brody, who some time ago were told that he was dead. Just recently, his wife Jessica (the talented and extraordinarily beautiful Morena Baccarin of FIREFLY fame) started dating Brody's best friend and comrade-in-arms Mike (Diego Klattenhoff). His kids Dana (an excellent Morgan Saylor) and Chris (Jackson Pace) have largely not even known him. Before he gets to see them, though, he has to be debriefed by the CIA, and naturally Carrie is there to confront him indirectly about his captors. She is certain that he is the lynchpin to Nazir's attack. So certain that she has her friend Virgil (THE SHIELD's David Marciano, great here too) install illegal surveillance in his home. Virgil discovers also that Carrie has been taking anti-psychotics because of her rather severe bi-polar disorder. She obsessively watches Brody and his family, and then her mentor/father figure/superior Saul Berenson (the always fantastic Mandy Patinkin) finds out about her illegal surveillance. She pleads with Saul to allow her to keep it but only for a short time since he had to blackmail a federal judge for the warrant. Carrie then begins her obsessive watch of Brody, looking for any clues about his behavior that might give him away as a sleeper agent while also avoiding her superior, the bureaucratic, scheming David Estes (excellent work by David Harewood).Meanwhile, Brody seems to be exhibiting all of the classic symptoms of a soldier released from years of captivity and torture, both physical and psychological. His behavior is erratic, and there are definitely things that he's hiding from his loving but guilt-ridden wife. He's trotted out in front of the cameras to present himself as some sort of recruitment poster-boy at first, but it soon becomes apparent that the government and the present administration have different plans for him. While all this comes at a surprise to the family, there may be a bigger scheme at work here. Really the question becomes: Has Brody truly turned, or is there simply nothing there other than a human being whose suffered a great ordeal?Seems simple enough from a plot perspective, and maybe a little reminiscent of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, and that actually works in its favor. The existence in the popular consciousness of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE causes people to look at this show and the character of Brody in one direction, but the show is really going somewhere else with Brody. Gordon and Garza are smart enough now to keep things mostly contained to the major plotlines, without allowing (as we saw several times in 24's run) several different and unrelated subplots to arise. They're also smart enough to contrive a situation in which Carrie and Brody have to meet with one another that seems totally organic and not just a total deus ex machina.The best episodes of the show and the best moments for Danes and Lewis are their characters in the outside world with one another. They're essentially reflections of one another: both living and lying to one another and the people around them, and they're both broken people. Danes plays Carrie as strong and confident in her work, fully aware of her abilities, but also is seriously damaged and isolated in every other aspect of her life. We're also briefly introduced to her family and particularly her father (the great James Rebhorn), who is also suffering from the same condition. After seeing people in manic states, I can honestly say that her portrayal of bi-polar disorder is absolutely flawless. I'd never been particularly enthusiastic about seeing Danes in anything due to her more teen-oriented roles, but after seeing her in HOMELAND, I can honestly say that her performance is genius. Lewis also plays Brody with an earnestness and believability that is almost unmatched in current television. Patinkin plays Saul with the kind of wisdom and world-weariness that you'd expect from someone who's been in the game for as many years as he has, but he refuses to ever become a cliche. Just when you think he's going to say or do one thing, he does the other and it's another great performance from him in a career full of them. The supporting cast, being particularly impressed with Baccarin and Saylor, is also excellent. By the end of this season, you really understand the characters and you get a real understanding of them as well aso sometimes feeling for them, which is a very fine line to walk when you're doing a show about terrorism.The directorial team behind the series with directors like Clark Johnson (who directed the feature film S.W.A.T., but also did some of the best episodes of THE WIRE as well), Michael Cuesta (who has worked on DEXTER, TRUE BLOOD and a terrific indie feature called L.I.E.) and Jeffrey Nachmanoff (who made a very similar feature film called TRAITOR with Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce) keep the show moving at a very good clip all throughout. Stylistically, this is a rather straightforward program with the exception of when it delves into Brody's period of captivity. Harsh lights and dull focus is used primarily, giving the viewer a good feel of disorientation.All in all, the only complaint that I could make about this excellent first season is that I think they could have really shaken things up in the finale, but it became more about preserving the narrative of the program rather than taking a real chance to do something that would cause even more interesting potential plot lines for the future. That's not necessarily a complaint, but more of a personal preference.HOMELAND is one of the strongest new shows on television and hopefully Season 2 will be, at the very least, on par with this season's excellent work.",5,Extremely Solid Storytelling and Character Overall.,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,7552,"['Howard', 'Gordon', 'co-showrunner', '24', 'Alex', 'Ganza', 'also', 'veteran',

1491904,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B005LAJ16I,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[0, 0]","&#34;Homeland, Season 1, is definitely the best film/TV production about a post 9/11 world. &#34;Homeland,&#34; (as one would imagine), refers to Homeland security, a US umbrella term formed to prevent terrorist attacks within and without the United States. &#34;Homeland&#34; premiered on October 2, 2011 on Showtime. The series is loosely based on the Israeli television series Hatufim, (&#34;Prisoners of War&#34;) created by Gideon Raff and developed for American television by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa. The first season follows Carrie Mathison, a CIA operations officer, who has come to believe that Nicholas Brody, an U.S. Marine Sergeant held captive by al-Qaeda as a prisoner of war for eight years, was turned by the enemy and now poses a significant risk to national securityWhat makes this particular show special is the quality of the acting and a shining cast: Claire Danes is Carrie Mathison, the above mentioned CIA operations officer assigned to the Counterterrorism Center.She has serious mental health issues; Damian Lewis gives a powerful performance as Nicholas Brody, a U.S. Marine platoon sergeant who was rescued by Delta Force after being held by al-Qaeda as a prisoner of war; Morena Baccarin is Jessica Brody, Nicholas Brody's beautiful and supportive wife. She holds a troubling secret;  Mandy Patinkin is Saul Berenson, the CIA's Middle-East Division Chief. He is Carrie's old boss and mentor. Mr. Potenkin can always be counted on to deliver a fine performance; David Harewood plays David Estes, the Director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. He is Carrie's boss and ex-lover; Diego Klattenhoff is Mike Faber, a U.S. Marine Captain. He was Nicholas' best friend who, assuming Brody was long dead, started an intense relationship with Jessica Brody. The two had intentions of marriage before Brody resurfaces; and last on the primary actor list are the Brody children- Jackson Pace is the young boy scout son, Chris Brody and Morgan Saylor is 16 year-old Dana Brody. Both adolescents give professional and believable performances, as do the supporting cast members.The writing and character development are also excellent. The show's most intriguing aspect rests on the rich topic area and the wide latitude afforded to its writers.One of my few problems with the storyline is that Sgt.  Brody seems kinda &#34;normal,&#34; (given his mind-boggling, excruciating experience), with nightmares and the erratic, paranoid behavior of PTSD, than most people would be after 8 years of being imprisoned in a bunker, tortured, etc. He seems to go right into considerable lift-off just a few weeks after being rescued. The reasoning for this over the top mental health, (he is deeply affected but, talking, walking, functioning with his family & the public), is that our government wants to use him as a hero/poster-boy. He is ment to represent the US victory against  al-Qaeda. Most people who have served in combat usually have nightmares and erratic behavior for a long while after deployment...and while on active duty. So, Brody's behavior stretches one's believability. However, because I really like the show's concept and the acting, I just &#34;believed.&#34;This show was well received by the public, (& definitely by me), to say the least, and won both the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series &#8211; Drama and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series for the season.",4,WARNING: Gripping and intriguing program.

1491931,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B005LAJ16I,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[2, 3]","I simply have to review Homeland. I'm sure most reviewers in here have already explained plot and excellence, I just want to add my voice here. I am an admitted TV and movie addict and watch mostly scripted shows. I know that a truly excellent almost historically perfect shows, the very few there are, take a village to make. I also know that for some, luck is part of it. Homeland must have a boatload of the former because it doesn't need the latter. Clare Danes shines brilliantly as Carrie, the bi-polar CIA agent who together with the equally brilliant Damian Lewis as Brody, the Ex-Al Quada prisoner (for eight years) who come together like two run away trains destined for destruction are the heart and soul of this unequalled series. However, the always amazing Mandy Patinkin as Saul, Carrie's biggest advocate and probably parental figure as well as Morena Baccarin, another tremendously talented actor who has finally found a worthy vehicle to stretch in, as Brody's wife, Jessica, deserve highest praise as well for equally brilliant performances. The rest of the village, the other supporting actors, including Brody and Jessica's daughter played by Morgan Saylor who is holding her own at such a young age against the powerhouse of talent that makes Homeland the exceptional thrill ride it is.We are now, I think, about halfway through the second season and it is to the credit of the entire cast and crew, directors, producers, Showrunner(s), camera, lighting, sound, other talented supporting actors and especially the writers, that in my humble opinion, it is better than the first season. Some say it, at times, comes a little too close to soap opera, but I totally disagree. This season could have played it safe and built horizontally upon Season 1. I think this season has seen tremendous growth and growing strength in Carrie. We also are seeing Brody's inevitable struggle with the psychosis developed after his harrowing years as prisoner and resulting brain washing. Every character this season has been realistically allowed to react to the developing crisis we know is looming on the show's horizon. I want to encourage this crew to continue the obvious hard work everyone is putting in to Homeland. I admit that also historically, such shows sometimes give in to playing it safe in the hopes of staying on top. Homeland's greatest strength is allowing it's characters to change and grow in ways most people can relate to. Staying real will bring us many seasons of a show so good, we, the people and not just the arty ""Intelligentsia"" benefit with something to look forward to in our sometimes otherwise mundane lives.I want to applaud everyone involved in this series and thank them for the weekly pleasure of having Homeland to look forward to. If you haven't seen this series or have been thinking about buying it and watching it because you don't get Showtime, I would encourage you to get this one, wait until the dregs of winter are upon us and allow this series to take you away with some of the highest quality entertainment offered today. I know money is tight all around these days all too well,  but Homeland is the sole reason I rent Showtime (honest disclosure - Dexter, Shameless - my guilty pleasure, and Nurse Jackie are why I continue through the rest of the year). If you can only afford to buy one series this year - Homeland is at the top of MY list. Everyone I know who watches it are about as big a fan as I am, so I think I can recommend this one without pause. I envy those of you who have not yet seen Homeland. Although this is one I will watch over again, there is nothing like the first time through!

1491935,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005LAJ16I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[15, 20]","As 2011 came to its conclusion, it was no big surprise (for anyone who was watching anyway) that Showtime's ""Homeland"" was being recognized with major award nominations and critics' group prizes as one of the best programs of the season. Sophisticated, intelligent, complex, and rewarding--I had hoped for a lot from this intriguing and contemporary spin on the Manchurian Candidate theme, but the show served up that and so much more as well. From the executive producers responsible for ""24,"" the show is a stunning and surprisingly realistic drama about family, an incisive look at modern terrorism, a bold political thriller, and a study of obsession all rolled into one gloriously produced entertainment. Add one of television's best ensemble casts, and ""Homeland"" easily earns its reputation as must-see TV. Showing up on numerous top ten lists, cited by TV Guide as the best show of the year, and getting Golden Globe nominations for Best Drama and for leads Claire Danes and Damian Lewis--this is only the beginning of the recognition and accolades that, I'm sure, will continue (Emmy nominations won't be announced for months).I won't do a disservice by digging into the specifics and plot points of ""Homeland."" This is a show that unravels at its own pace, much like a fine novel. Anyone who divulges too much is really just ruining the complexities of the ever-evolving narrative. Danes plays a CIA analyst in Iraq who receives an open-ended warning about a planned attack on American soil by a ""turned"" POW. When Lewis, as a marine thought dead for eight years, is rescued from an Iraqi military compound and is thrust into the limelight, Danes starts to feel that this vague warning might have real merit. The early episodes play out like a sophisticated game of cat-and-mouse as Danes becomes obsessed with the target of her rogue investigation. The first half of the season, in my opinion, is absolutely riveting as both of the deeply flawed protagonists have their share of issues. By necessity, the show develops a more complicated mythology for its central mystery as the season progresses--but it is never better than when Lewis and Danes are trying to figure one another out.In addition to the stellar work by Danes and Lewis, the show also features some great supporting roles in the side plots. Morena Baccarin, as Lewis' wife, is a compelling mix of strength and vulnerability. Her world, and that of their two kids, is completely upended by his return and the reformation of the family unit is filled with powerful and poignant moments. Mandy Patinkin scores as Danes' boss and mentor. Danes is suffering from a psychological condition (which, in reality, would be virtually impossible to hide in a top CIA position) and as Patinkin becomes apprised of her condition, it provides some of the best and most heartbreaking work he's done in years. The show expertly uses its cast to blend these elements of drama in with the escalating tensions of the main story thread. And as the episodes move forward, the stakes just keeping ratcheting higher until the ultimate goal is revealed in exciting fashion.Season One consists of 12 episodes of approximately an hour each with the finale of extended length. While it seems improbable that the show could match the intensity of this season, it has already been approved for another year. It used to be that HBO ruled the roost with premium cable drama, but Showtime keeps narrowing that margin with its expanding roster of smart adult shows. Season One of ""Homeland"" is easily one of their best efforts to date. After one episode, you'll be hooked. And every time you think you've got things figured out, the show takes another unexpected turn. I really loved this one!

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was originally an Israeli series about a returning POW.  That emphasis on the missing soldier Brody (Damian Lewis) returning after eight years was a set up for an American television series.  Add in Carrie (Claire Danes), a CIA officer pulled back to Langley to be an analyst for going ""too far"" in Baghdad trying to protect a 'burned' source who told her al Qaeda had turned an American.  That is the very beginning to get you assuming how things might go from the very beginning.  If that was all this series was it would be good for two maybe three hours of viewing.This series is so much more.  The soldier must deal with a family that believed he had died and moved on including a son who can't remember his father because he was an infant when the soldier left.  He also has to deal with his life in ""captivity"" and that he was captured with his sniper team mate, who was beaten to death, for whom he dug a grave for and saw buried.  The disconnect of what he has experienced effects how he can deal with freedom.  His torment leads him to lash out, whether fairly or not, at those he comes into contact with.Carrie on the other hand has been so wronged by the Agency that she will do anything to prove them wrong and now she has a chance to prove that she was right all along.  She of course ignores her mentor's advice and breaks the law in her pursuit coming up with a clue.  Up until here it is kind of stereotypical plot, but then when that clue doesn't lead to more and eventually pans out, she is fixated on Brody.  And of course if there is a sleeper terrorist then there is even that much more conflict for the series that could have been a two hour movie.This series however was just starting with this much.  Brody's family, the wife of his dead sniper mate, and old friends wouldn't have made it into a movie to cut time off of it.  Carrie's family and her condition wouldn't have made it into a movie either, extraneous subplots consuming too much time in a hunt / countdown thriller.  This series is made by including characters with believably motivated plotlines of their own.  It tries to show how the CIA operates (as well as anything in Hollywood or television can) rarely going into stereotypes.I could go into all the details, which make this a brilliant series, but I don't want to ruin it and I will probably find more as I watch it again.  Go out and get it.  You will find out that it is worth every cent and more for the hours of smart entertainment (and thought provoking) that it gives you.",5,Great series that looks at characters as much as plot,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,2680,"['had', 'been', 'told', 'would', 'like', 'was', 'reluctant', 'typical', 'stereotypes', 'put', 'such', 'shows', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'originally', 'Israeli', 'series', 'returning', 'POW', 'emphasis', 'missing', 'soldier', 'Brody', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'returning', 'eight', 'years', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'American', 'television', 'series', 'Add', 'Carrie', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'CIA', 'officer', 'pulled', 'back', 'Langley', 'be', 'analyst', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'Baghdad', 'trying', 'protect', ""'burned"", 'source', 'who', 'told', 'al', 'Qaeda', 'had', 'turned', 'American', 'very', 'beginning', 'get', 'assuming', 'how', 'things', 'might', 'go', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'two', 'maybe', 'three', 'hours', 'viewing.This', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'soldier', 'must', 'deal', 'family', 'believed', 'had', 'died', 'moved', 'including', 'son', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'father', 'was', 'infant', 'when', 'soldier', 'left', 'also', 'deal', 'life', 'captivity', 'was', 'captured', 'sniper', 'team', 'mate', 'who', 'was', 'beaten', 'death', 'whom', 'dug', 'grave', 'saw', 'buried', 'disconnect', 'what', 'experienced', 'effects', 'how', 'can', 'deal', 'freedom', 'torment', 'lash', 'out', 'fairly', 'not', 'contact', 'with.Carrie', 'other', 'hand', 'been', 'so', 'wronged', 'Agency', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'prove', 'wrong', 'now', 'chance', 'prove', 'was', 'right', 'all', 'along', 'course', 'mentor', 'advice', 'law', 'pursuit', 'coming', 'up', 'clue', 'here', 'kind', 'stereotypical', 'plot', 'then', 'when', 'clue', ""n't"", 'lead', 'more', 'eventually', 'out', 'fixated', 'Brody', 'course', 'sleeper', 'terrorist', 'then', 'even', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'conflict', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'hour', 'movie.This', 'series', 'however', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'much', 'Brody', 'family', 'wife', 'dead', 'sniper', 'mate', 'old', 'friends', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'cut', 'time', 'Carrie', 'family', 'condition', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'either', 'extraneous', 'subplots', 'consuming', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hunt', '/', 'countdown', 'thriller', 'series', 'made', 'including', 'characters', 'believably', 'motivated', 'plotlines', 'own', 'show', 'how', 'CIA', 'as', 'well', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'television', 'can', 'rarely', 'going', 'stereotypes.I', 'could', 'go', 'details', 'make', 'brilliant', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'more', 'watch', 'again', 'Go', 'out', 'get', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'worth', 'cent', 'more', 'hours', 'smart', 'entertainment', 'thought', 'provoking']",N/A

I'm on the edge of my seat during each episode. Claire Danes' plays a CIA agent (Carrie) who struggles with a psychological disorder,  which she has been hiding from the Agency otherwise she fears they will fire her from her position.  She suspects a recently saved POW (Sgt. Brody) has turned on the U.S.A. and is now working for the enemy.  Sgt. Brody is rescued from being imprisoned for 8 years and is decorated with praise and glory from his Country so her suspicions are not well received.  She takes matters into her own hands and hires ""outside help"" to bug Brody's house so that she can spy on him to ""prove"" her suspicions.  She watches him and his family through a Monitor which is set up at her house (keeping in mind, what she is doing is highly illegal).  As Brody becomes more popular she becomes more frustrated to prove her suspicions.  But are they suspicions or is Brody really hiding something? Is she just crazy or is there something very secretive going on that no one is aware of...except Carrie.  This show has so many twists and turns you will never know what to expect and just when you think you've figured it out - another twist comes along.  The show is written in such a way that it is easy to follow - not a crazy amount of dialogue where you get lost just trying to keep track of all the characters or details.  It is beautifully written, extremely well acted, and amazingly realistic. I highly recommend Homeland and am looking forward to Season 2.",5,AMAZING!

I watched the first episode just to give it a chance and less than a week later I am halfway into season 2.Cary (Clare Danes) works a lot of undercover missions for the CIA in the Middle East.  When the first episode opens she is told by an informant that a US POW has been turned by Al-Quida and is plotting an attack against the US.Next we see a US mission where a POW is found in an Al-Quida controlled prison.  The prisoner (Brody) was a marine sargeant held from the Iraq war for 8 years and presumed dead.  And just like John McCain, he returns to the US to a hero's welcome.Cary has her suspicions about Sargeant Brody and sets up illegal survellience in his house.  Through season 1 we are given teasers by the director as to whether or not Cary may be right as Brody tries to reconnect to a forgotten family who thought him dead and a politcal machine that wants him to go into politics.We learn that Cary is a loose cannon who takes mood controlling medication and was almost let go by the agency 10 years prior.  The only person who went to bat for her is her mentor Saul.  Cary is so embroiled in activities surrounding Brody that she cannot let Saul know what she is doing or she may lose her job.Two or three episodes into the series is all it takes to hook the viewer into it.  As good as Season 1 was, season 2 is shaping up to be just as good, if not better.  Clare Danes does a tremendous job in her role and is very convincing.

It tells a story of the 2011 war on terror, which is much different, but related to the 2001 war.  The story centers around two definitely ""broken"" people.  One a Marine who is rescued after being held captive by terrorists for 8 years, and the other a CIA analyst who is convinced that he has been turned and is now working for those same terrorists.The story has a lot of twists and turns, and at least for the first half the the season it takes you on a is he or isn't he ride.  You do find the answer before the end of the season, but there is still a lot of suspense in the final few episodes and the season ends on a cliff hanger. I will not go into any more detail than that, so as not to spoil those who have not seen it yet.  I think many shows where there is such a focus on a central mystery like that (see Twin Peaks) really fizzle once you know the answer.  At least in this season that did not happen.  I have not seen the second season yet, so I am not sure if that is still the case.The best part of the series is the great ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis and Claire Danes are definitely the focus of the series, but everyone from Mandy Patinkin, Morena Baccarin, to David Harewood do a great job in their roles.  Fans of the series Due South will also recognize David Marciano, who is an ex CIA officer that helps Danes' character run surveillance.

Well, think of this as a cliffhanger, a thousand times removed and more sophisticated and improved. I can almost guarantee that after watching one episode, you'll be hooked and that you'll wait with bated breath for the next one...just like we used to do as kids in the theater for serials, like &#34;The Adventures of Captain Marvel&#34;...and so many others. The exchange that begins this review pretty much encapsulates the plot of this serial. Carrie Mathison, is a smart, driven CIA agent who's been told by a highly reliable source that an American POW in Iraq has been turned by the terrorists. She puts no stock in it at the time, but when Marine, Nicholas Brody, is rescued after spending 8 years as a POW, she tells her mentor and superior, Saul Berenson...and the plot, as they say, thickens from there. Claire Danes as Carrie, delivers her most powerful performance on film...my opinion; and the fact she plays a smart driven CIA agent, who also has a mental illness, just adds to the power of her performance. Damien Lewis, except for &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;, also delivers his best performance on film...again my opinion. The third powerful performance is Mandy Patinken, as Saul Berenson, and believe me, his performance is just as riveting as the other two. There are of course many other support players who contribute greatly to the quality of this series, like Morena Baccarin as Jessica Brody, Nicholas Brody's wife; and David Harewood as David Estes, the director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center.

Homeland smart, and thrilling, with characters that sizzle with life on the small screen.  This is the kind of acting depth that movies just can't compete with as actors get hours of onscreen time and playback, to hone their characters to a knife's edge of perfection.  Created by the makers of 24, this is not just another 'let's go beat up our enemies' sort of thriller.Much of the action goes on in the characters heads putting this show in the same category as House.  You have to watch Homeland from the beginning, and after the first show, you're hooked.  Just when you think you have it figured out, the plot goes the opposite direction, and the viewer is forced out of the kind of lethargy that you get when thinking you know what's going to happen in your favorite show.  You WILL NOT know what's going to happen next in Homeland.The stars of the show do some of the finest acting I've ever seen.  I have winced at Claire Danes portrayal of Carrie Mathison, the CIA operative who's always just one pill away from someone putting her away for good.  The pilot starts off with Carrie bribing her way into an Iraqi prison to talk to a man who's going to be hung within the hour.  She promises him that she'll take care of his family if he gives up what he knows.  The condemned man whispers that an American POW has been turned in Carrie's ear just as she's being dragged away by the guards.  The tension is unbearable.With Carrie somehow back in the States, she hears that a man who's been imprisoned for 8 years has been rescued.  Nick Brody(Damian Lewis) is home now and a hero, and of course Carrie is sure that he's the POW her source told her about.So, that's basically the plot.  Carrie thinks Brody has turned against the U.S. and no one believes her.  Her boss and mentor, Sol(Mandy Patinkin) is amazing in his role.  He's high strung himself, but has all the discipline Carrie lacks to keep her under some sort of control.  The yin and yang of these two characters as they swirl around each other, is breathtaking.  Watching Sol reel his brilliant student back to earth is masterful.Carrie is one flawed woman, and it's her flaw that makes her so brilliant as she dances circles around her superiors and senses on some sort of animal level what Brody is all about.  Or is he?  Carrie battles to keep her sanity as her genius threatens to take her down.  She vacillates between being a control freak, and heartrendingly fragile.  It's a feast for the brain to watch this complicated character week after week.Brody's wife is that gorgeous actress from V, Morena Baccarin.  I find it more than ironic that she could pass for an Iraqi, and that she's married to Brody.  Did the writers do this on purpose to show that Brody night already be sympathetic to middle-easterners?  And Sol is married to an Indian woman, while his character is Jewish.  Again, we have the conflict of a man whose job it is to protect us from the violence of the Middle east while married to a woman who could be Middle eastern.Homeland is complex, exciting, and the kind of show where your brain never gets a chance to tune out.

There are several plotline variables that you are not sure about, which keeps it suspenseful. The cast is pretty good. Claire is excellent.

The writing, cinematography and often jazz-based (think Miles Davis) musical score all seem pretty well executed. The storyline is current and it is worthwhile viewing.

1492090,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B005LAJ16I,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","From the creators of 24, comes the thriller Homeland, a show that is much edgier than 24, but lacks the action we've come to expect from this team of writers. What this show lacks in action, it more than makes up for with an intriguing look inside the mysterious CIA.It's no secret that the CIA is the spy agency in America, that seems to have a hand in everything, but what exactly do they do and how do they do it? Can they arrest people? Do they carry guns? Are they really spies? These are all questions answered by the show Homeland, an edge of your seat thriller, that takes you deep inside the inner workings of the most mysterious government organization the world has ever known.Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is a CIA analyst, working in Iraq, when one of her contacts tells her that an American prisoner of war has been turned by Al-Qaeda. 6 months later, an American POW is discovered during a raid on an Al-Qaeda compound. The Marine discovered, Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damien Lewis) comes home to his family, after 8 years, to a heroes welcome, and everyone sees him as such, everyone except for Carrie.Mathison is immediately suspicious of Brody and puts her career on the line by deciding to stick to the man like glue, she even goes so far as to start a sexual relationship with him, in order to stay close to him. Brody is suffering from a severe case of post traumatic stress disorder, which leads him to do some very strange things. The big question is, whether he's acting this way because he's a terrorist or because he's been damaged by his time in captivity.I've never been a big Claire Danes fan, because she has a habit of being eccentric and way over the top, but quite ingeniously, the writers use her weaknesses as an actress as a strength for Carrie. Mathison is eccentric, over the top, and unconventional, it's what makes her a terrific agent and very entertaining to watch.Danes is paired with Damien Lewis who is just out of this world, leading to multiple awards and nominations. I've only seen Lewis playing bit parts in movies, but similar to Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad, he's one of these guys, who comes out of nowhere to land the perfect role. Nicholas Brody is one of the most complicated and intriguing characters I've ever seen and it's his chemistry with Danes that really makes this show as good as it is.It's rare for me to give a perfect rating, especially to a TV show, but the creators have taken the action and excitement of 24 and put it into a cable show, where they can get away with anything. It's edgier and extremely hard hitting, even though the action has been scaled back. 24 was about an impulsive man, who would do anything to stop terrorism, but Homeland, takes that same storyline and shows you what goes into discovering these acts of violence before they become a down to the second event, requiring the intervention of a Jack Bauer. It is smart, emotional, and will have you craving more. I literally watched the first two seasons in a week an a half, you'd think I'd have gotten sick of it by now, but all I want is for season three to be released, because this show really is that good.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,3154,"['creators', '24', 'thriller', 'Homeland', 'show', 'much', 'edgier', '24', 'action', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'team', 'writers', 'What', 'show', 'action', 'more', 'up', 'intriguing', 'look', 'mysterious', 'CIA.It', 'secret', 'CIA', 'spy', 'agency', 'America', 'have', 'hand', 'everything', 'what', 'exactly', 'do', 'do', 'how', 'do', 'do', 'Can', 'arrest', 'people', 'Do', 'carry', 'guns', 'Are', 'really', 'spies', 'are', 'questions', 'answered', 'show', 'Homeland', 'edge', 'seat', 'thriller', 'deep', 'inner', 'workings', 'most', 'mysterious', 'government', 'organization', 'world', 'ever', 'known.Carrie', 'Mathison', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'working', 'Iraq', 'when', 'one', 'contacts', 'American', 'prisoner', 'war', 'been', 'turned', 'Al-Qaeda', '6', 'months', 'later', 'American', 'POW', 'discovered', 'raid', 'Al-Qaeda', 'compound', 'Marine', 'discovered', 'Sgt', 'Nicholas', 'Brody', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'home', 'family', '8', 'years', 'heroes', 'welcome', 'everyone', 'such', 'everyone', 'Carrie.Mathison', 'immediately', 'suspicious', 'Brody', 'career', 'line', 'deciding', 'stick', 'man', 'glue', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'start', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'order', 'stay', 'close', 'Brody', 'suffering', 'severe', 'case', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'do', 'very', 'strange', 'things', 'big', 'question', 'acting', 'way', 'terrorist', 'been', 'damaged', 'time', 'captivity.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'fan', 'habit', 'being', 'eccentric', 'way', 'top', 'quite', 'ingeniously', 'writers', 'use', 'weaknesses', 'actress', 'strength', 'Carrie', 'Mathison', 'eccentric', 'top', 'unconventional', 'what', 'terrific', 'agent', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch.Danes', 'paired', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'who', 'just', 'out', 'world', 'leading', 'multiple', 'awards', 'nominations', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'Lewis', 'playing', 'bit', 'parts', 'movies', 'similar', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'nowhere', 'land', 'perfect', 'role', 'Brody', 'one', 'most', 'complicated', 'intriguing', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'chemistry', 'Danes', 'really', 'show', 'as', 'good', 'is.It', 'rare', 'give', 'perfect', 'rating', 'especially', 'TV', 'show', 'creators', 'have', 'taken', 'action', 'excitement', '24', 'put', 'cable', 'show', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'edgier', 'extremely', 'hard', 'hitting', 'even', 'action', 'been', 'scaled', 'back', '24', 'was', 'impulsive', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'stop', 'terrorism', 'Homeland', 'same', 'storyline', 'what', 'discovering', 'acts', 'violence', 'become', 'down', 'second', 'event', 'requiring', 'intervention', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'smart', 'emotional', 'will', 'have', 'craving', 'more', 'literally', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'week', 'half', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'gotten', 'sick', 'now', 'want', 'season', 'three', 'be', 'released', 'show', 'really', 'good']",N/A

If you're not prepared for that, you won't enjoy the show.SPOILERS:Based on an Israeli TV series, ""Homeland"" takes us into the life of a CIA operative Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes)who believes that a recently resurfaced American hostage from Afganistan Sgt.Nicholas Brody (Damien Lewis)may have been turned into a terrorist. Mathison who suffers from bipolar disorder and has kept it secret from her former boss Saul (Mandy Patinkin), believes that information she has from an informant points to Brody as the terrorist. She goes on a crusade to get surveillance on Brody with unintended consequences.END OF SPOILERS:Danes, Lewis and the rest of the cast give stellar performances in this intense drama. We get plenty of answers about what happened to Brody and what happened to him overseas.The DVD for the series looks quite nice with a sharp looking transfer.

Also included is an exceptional making-of documentary entitled ""Homeland Season One: Under Surveillance which features comments from the various production crew, writers and actors for the show.An exceptional series ""Homeland"" is well worth watching but it isn't appropriate for any youngsters and those easily offended by nudity, sex and bad language would be best advised to steer clear.",5,The creation of a terrorist and the agent determined to stop him,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,1997,"['Emmy', 'awards', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'guarantee', 'show', 'great', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'mediocre', 'shows', 'have', 'won', 'awards', 'years', 'Homeland', 'demonstrate', 'growth', 'dramatic', 'adult', 'programming', 'growth.A', 'warning', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'nudity', 'sex', 'violence', 'plenty', 'four', 'letter', 'words', ""'re"", 'not', 'prepared', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'show.SPOILERS', 'Based', 'Israeli', 'TV', 'series', 'Homeland', 'life', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Carrie', 'Mathison', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'who', 'recently', 'resurfaced', 'American', 'hostage', 'Afganistan', 'Sgt.Nicholas', 'Brody', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'terrorist', 'Mathison', 'who', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'kept', 'secret', 'former', 'boss', 'Saul', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'information', 'informant', 'points', 'Brody', 'terrorist', 'crusade', 'get', 'surveillance', 'Brody', 'unintended', 'consequences.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Danes', 'Lewis', 'rest', 'cast', 'give', 'stellar', 'performances', 'intense', 'drama', 'get', 'plenty', 'answers', 'what', 'happened', 'Brody', 'what', 'happened', 'overseas.The', 'DVD', 'series', 'quite', 'nice', 'sharp', 'looking', 'transfer', 'Presented', 'original', 'broadcast', 'ratio', '1.78:1', 'show', 'look', 'big', 'screen', 'production.We', 'get', 'English', 'subtitles', 'as', 'well', 'Spanish', 'French.Special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'extensive', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'expected', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'first', 'episode', 'also', 'get', 'prologue', 'second', 'season', 'started', 'September', 'Also', 'included', 'exceptional', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Homeland', 'Season', 'One', 'Surveillance', 'comments', 'various', 'production', 'crew', 'writers', 'actors', 'show.An', 'exceptional', 'series', 'Homeland', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'youngsters', 'easily', 'offended', 'nudity', 'sex', 'bad', 'language', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'advised', 'steer', 'clear']",N/A

1492105,AP3B615GM191G,B005LAJ16I,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","There are some (I would so so far as to say many) TV shows that start off in a meandering sort of format.  Because of renewal constraints or time schedules, the show producers just don't quite get into a groove until late in the first season or even beyond.  Likely due to its existence on pay cable (Showtime), however, ""Homeland"" starts off with a bang and doesn't waver a bit for all twelve episodes of this first season.For a basic plot summary, ""Homeland"" begins with government agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) investigating criminals of war in the Middle East.  One one specific occasion, Carrie is told that an American POW has been ""turned"", or converted into a sleeper agent for Al Queda.  At about the same time, U.S. soldier Nicholas Brody (Damien Lewis) is rescued after eight years of captivity.  Is he the ""turned"" agent?  As we (the viewers) are given closer looks at the lives of both Carrie and Nicholas, the mystery begins to unravel in tantalizing bits and pieces.The hallmark of this show is easily the fact that the storytelling is paced so well.  The show producers (much of the same team that contributed to ""24"", I believe) divulge everything so perfectly.  Relationships are nurtured along (not rushed or prolonged), key plot points are parceled out bit by bit, and the characters grow a little bit with each situation.  Only perhaps the very early season of ""LOST"" rival ""Homeland"" in terms of dramatic storytelling.The acting is also top-of-the-line.  Besides the two leads, great supporting performances are also turned in by Morena Baccarin, Mandy Patinkin, & Morgan Saylor, to name just a few.  Each character has a specific purpose within the show, and all the actors realize that purpose and know how to use it to great dramatic effect.Also, if (like me) you are a sucker for politically-themed dramas, then this will quickly rise up near the top of your ""favorite shows of all-time"" list.  It manages to speak to many different political issues and events without taking sides or getting preachy, which is always refreshing.Overall, I watched all twelve of these episodes in the span of days, not weeks.  Even in such a short time frame (relatively speaking compared to season-long broadcast shows), so much happens that you'll feel as if you've watched twice the amount of actual fare.  Suffice it to say that you'll be chomping at the bit for season two!",5,Confident In Storytelling From Beginning To End,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,2394,"['are', 'would', 'so', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'start', 'meandering', 'sort', 'format', 'renewal', 'constraints', 'time', 'schedules', 'show', 'producers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'groove', 'late', 'first', 'season', 'even', 'Likely', 'due', 'existence', 'pay', 'cable', 'Showtime', 'however', 'Homeland', 'bang', ""n't"", 'waver', 'bit', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'first', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Homeland', 'government', 'agent', 'Carrie', 'Mathison', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'investigating', 'criminals', 'war', 'Middle', 'East', 'One', 'one', 'specific', 'occasion', 'Carrie', 'told', 'American', 'POW', 'been', 'turned', 'converted', 'sleeper', 'agent', 'Al', 'Queda', 'same', 'time', 'U.S.', 'Nicholas', 'Brody', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'rescued', 'eight', 'years', 'captivity', 'turned', 'agent', 'viewers', 'are', 'given', 'closer', 'lives', 'Carrie', 'Nicholas', 'mystery', 'unravel', 'tantalizing', 'bits', 'pieces.The', 'hallmark', 'show', 'easily', 'fact', 'storytelling', 'paced', 'so', 'well', 'show', 'producers', 'much', 'same', 'team', 'contributed', '24', 'believe', 'divulge', 'everything', 'so', 'perfectly', 'Relationships', 'are', 'nurtured', 'not', 'rushed', 'prolonged', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'parceled', 'out', 'bit', 'bit', 'characters', 'grow', 'little', 'bit', 'situation', 'Only', 'perhaps', 'very', 'early', 'season', 'LOST', 'rival', 'Homeland', 'terms', 'dramatic', 'storytelling.The', 'acting', 'also', 'top-of-the-line', 'two', 'leads', 'great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'turned', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'Morgan', 'Saylor', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'character', 'specific', 'purpose', 'show', 'actors', 'realize', 'purpose', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'great', 'dramatic', 'effect.Also', 'are', 'sucker', 'politically-themed', 'dramas', 'then', 'will', 'quickly', 'rise', 'up', 'top', 'favorite', 'shows', 'all-time', 'list', 'speak', 'many', 'different', 'political', 'issues', 'events', 'taking', 'sides', 'getting', 'preachy', 'always', 'refreshing.Overall', 'watched', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'span', 'days', 'not', 'weeks', 'Even', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'compared', 'season-long', 'broadcast', 'shows', 'so', 'much', 'happens', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'amount', 'actual', 'fare', 'Suffice', 'say', ""'ll"", 'be', 'chomping', 'bit', 'season', 'two']",N/A
