And no, it's not even particularly sympathetic to the plight of conjoined twins, because it never takes that part of the story seriously and the twins are no longer conjoined at the end of the movie anyway.  What, you thought they lived happily ever after sharing a liver?  Two hours with these guys and I was reaching for a knife, to cut my OWN throat.  Matt Damon has done bad work before, but Greg Kinnear is usually watchable.  But in this film he looks like Jeff Fahey's stunt double from the execrable ""Lawnmower Man,"" a movie that isn't sympathetic to the plight of the mentally challenged.  And what are those bags under his eyes all about?  Is he suffering for his art?  Well fine, because I don't think the viewer should be the only one.  The best thing about this film were the cameos by Meryl Streep and Cher, especially Cher.  Am I the only one who noticed that ""Honey and the Bease"" is a parody of ""Moonlighting""? Which was itself a parody of the private eye genre, so I take it all back, especially when the Cher character softens.

I enjoy some of their comedies, love other and then despise a few.  `Stuck on You', much like `There's Something About Mary', gets enough right to keep me more than entertained, and more than willing to sit through it again and again.  It has the right balance of absurdity and sincerity to make it even a little heartwarming.The film tells of two conjoined twins, Bob and Walt.  They are joined at the hip, literally.  They are cooks at a burger place but soon find themselves uprooted and Walt decides he wants to be an actor.  So, off they go to Hollywood.  Bob and Walt are extremely supportive of each other and truly endeared to one another.  But, as the pressure mounts it becomes evident that living the same life can only get them so far.It may be time to cut the fat, so-to-speak.The film is a delightful mix of humor and heart, and the acting here really fills the screen.  Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear are wonderful as the conjoined brothers.  Damon manages to portray the wariness of Bob without making him weepy or annoying, and Kinnear is comedic gold as the self-absorbed yet completely likable Walt.  Cher gets major points for playing herself with sass and wit.  She has never been this hilarious, for she really gets the whole point behind her inclusion in the film.  Eva Mendes is also nice here (and pretty nice to look at too).In the end, while not perfect (it doesn't ALWAYS work), this is a comedy that most will readily enjoy.  It is one of those `stupid' comedies that embraces its genre and embellishes with charm, wit and memorable performances.So what if it is absurd, it's also a whole lot of fun!",4,Stuck on this movie!,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,1740,"['Sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'embrace', 'obvious', 'pun', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'enjoy', 'comedies', 'love', 'other', 'then', 'despise', 'few', 'Stuck', 'much', 'Something', 'Mary', 'enough', 'right', 'keep', 'more', 'entertained', 'more', 'willing', 'sit', 'again', 'again', 'right', 'balance', 'absurdity', 'sincerity', 'make', 'even', 'little', 'heartwarming.The', 'film', 'tells', 'two', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'Bob', 'Walt', 'are', 'joined', 'hip', 'literally', 'are', 'cooks', 'burger', 'place', 'soon', 'find', 'uprooted', 'Walt', 'be', 'actor', 'So', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'Bob', 'Walt', 'are', 'extremely', 'supportive', 'other', 'truly', 'endeared', 'one', 'pressure', 'evident', 'living', 'same', 'life', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'so', 'far.It', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'cut', 'fat', 'so-to-speak.The', 'film', 'delightful', 'mix', 'humor', 'heart', 'acting', 'here', 'really', 'screen', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'are', 'wonderful', 'conjoined', 'brothers', 'Damon', 'portray', 'wariness', 'Bob', 'making', 'weepy', 'annoying', 'Kinnear', 'comedic', 'gold', 'self-absorbed', 'yet', 'completely', 'likable', 'Walt', 'Cher', 'major', 'points', 'playing', 'sass', 'wit', 'never', 'been', 'hilarious', 'really', 'whole', 'point', 'inclusion', 'film', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'also', 'nice', 'here', 'pretty', 'nice', 'look', 'too', 'end', 'not', 'perfect', ""n't"", 'ALWAYS', 'work', 'comedy', 'most', 'will', 'readily', 'enjoy', 'one', 'stupid', 'comedies', 'genre', 'embellishes', 'charm', 'wit', 'memorable', 'performances.So', 'what', 'absurd', 'also', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun']",N/A
618785,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JMG8,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 1]","The Farrelly Brothers, Peter and Bobby, return to give film and cinema goers another dose of their special brand of humor. But while there are still moments of comedic lunacy that reek of classic Farrelly, this latest serving seems to not come full stocked with the Farrelly brand. They gave us moments that showcased the use of bodily fluids to give your hair that extra lift, and gave us the chicken in a very uncomfortable place in ""Me, Myself And Irene"", but there is no big wild aspect to this one. The movie takes place in Massachusettes, mainly Martha's Vineyard, a part of the country that a lot of there films take place. We meet siamese twins Bob and Walt Tenor, played by Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear. Attached at the hip, the brothers get along just fine and seem to not even think twice about their life situation. They work as cooks in their own restaraunt, The Quickie Burger. Walt(Kinnear) is a budding actor, having done work in the local theater, and dreams one day of doing a musical of Bonnie and Clyde. Bob(Damon)is the opposite, and is more than happy to stay right where they are, in the small town of seamen and lumberjacks. Bob then gives in to Walt's dream, and they head to Hollywood where Walt tries to make his dream of becoming a real actor come true. Naturally, this is where the film really gets going. Walt makes it big when he gets a TV show and co-stars opposite Cher, but the time of separating the twins comes too soon. What's surprising about the movie is how tame and calmer it is compared to the brothers' other films. It seems to try to be more tender and with more heart than the other works in their cannon. There is nothing wrong with that, but it was a surprise. With a concept that they had, it seemed that they pulled back a bit on the reins when they should have gone full steam ahead. It's not as laugh out loud as one accustomed to their films would think. The actors seem really game, and according to the bloopers in the special features section, it appeared to be a blast to make. Cher comes off as a real good sport. She's playing herself more or less, and she is game to spoof her image and her penchant for young boyfriends. There are a few other guest appearances in the movie, but I won't spoil it for you. However, I have to mention Meryl Streep, who does appear(uncredited)in the movie, and you have to give her points for being game. Damon and Kinnear are both engaging and fun to watch, although Kinnear is clearly the one with the fun role while Damon plays the straight man. It's fun casting, really, but Damon and Kinnear don't resemble each other to be twins, and the fact that Kinnear has to be 9 to 10 years older than Damon. Oh well. It's completely transparent and won't be remembered much after it's over. I will mention that Eva Mendes appears in all her beautiful glory and she is quite stunning. It won't be up there with ""Dumb And Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", but a silly comedy with no other point than to have fun and laugh is always welcome. In fact, it will always be wanted.",3,9 Inches,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,3068,"['Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'Peter', 'Bobby', 'return', 'give', 'film', 'cinema', 'goers', 'dose', 'special', 'brand', 'humor', 'are', 'still', 'moments', 'comedic', 'lunacy', 'reek', 'classic', 'Farrelly', 'latest', 'serving', 'not', 'come', 'full', 'stocked', 'Farrelly', 'brand', 'gave', 'moments', 'showcased', 'use', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'give', 'hair', 'extra', 'lift', 'gave', 'chicken', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'place', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'big', 'wild', 'aspect', 'one', 'movie', 'place', 'Massachusettes', 'mainly', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'part', 'country', 'lot', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'meet', 'siamese', 'twins', 'Bob', 'Walt', 'Tenor', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Attached', 'hip', 'brothers', 'get', 'along', 'just', 'fine', 'seem', 'not', 'even', 'think', 'twice', 'life', 'situation', 'work', 'cooks', 'own', 'restaraunt', 'Quickie', 'Burger', 'Walt', 'Kinnear', 'budding', 'actor', 'having', 'done', 'work', 'local', 'theater', 'one', 'day', 'doing', 'musical', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Bob', 'Damon', 'opposite', 'more', 'happy', 'stay', 'right', 'where', 'are', 'small', 'town', 'seamen', 'lumberjacks', 'Bob', 'then', 'Walt', 'dream', 'head', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'Walt', 'make', 'dream', 'becoming', 'real', 'actor', 'come', 'true', 'Naturally', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'going', 'Walt', 'big', 'when', 'TV', 'show', 'co-stars', 'opposite', 'Cher', 'time', 'separating', 'twins', 'too', 'soon', 'What', 'surprising', 'movie', 'how', 'tame', 'calmer', 'compared', 'brothers', 'other', 'films', 'try', 'be', 'more', 'tender', 'more', 'heart', 'other', 'works', 'cannon', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'was', 'surprise', 'concept', 'had', 'seemed', 'pulled', 'back', 'bit', 'reins', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'full', 'steam', 'ahead', 'not', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'one', 'accustomed', 'films', 'would', 'think', 'actors', 'seem', 'really', 'game', 'according', 'bloopers', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'appeared', 'be', 'blast', 'make', 'Cher', 'off', 'real', 'good', 'sport', 'playing', 'more', 'less', 'game', 'spoof', 'image', 'penchant', 'young', 'boyfriends', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'guest', 'appearances', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'However', 'have', 'mention', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'appear', 'uncredited', 'movie', 'have', 'give', 'points', 'being', 'game', 'Damon', 'Kinnear', 'are', 'engaging', 'fun', 'watch', 'Kinnear', 'clearly', 'one', 'fun', 'role', 'Damon', 'straight', 'man', 'fun', 'casting', 'really', 'Damon', 'Kinnear', 'do', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'other', 'be', 'twins', 'fact', 'Kinnear', 'be', '9', '10', 'years', 'older', 'Damon', 'Oh', 'well', 'completely', 'transparent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'remembered', 'much', 'will', 'mention', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'beautiful', 'glory', 'quite', 'stunning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'up', 'there', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Something', 'Mary', 'silly', 'comedy', 'other', 'point', 'have', 'fun', 'laugh', 'always', 'welcome', 'fact', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'wanted']",N/A

You'll enjoy it a LOT more.Most of the comedy comes from the fact that these conjoined twins are, well... conjoined, but yet they don't seem to realize that they can't lead a normal life.  Damon's character finally meets a girl he's been dating over the internet for three years, but somehow failed to mention he has a brother at all, say nothing about the fact that he's stuck to him.  And when the two finally meet it takes three or four dates for her to figure out why Kinner is always there.  Kinner himself wants to be a Hollywood actor but can't quit grasp why he's laughed out of ever audition he attends.A tasteful job is done of making their situations funny without being overly distasteful, but there are a few scenes that could have been left out and I would have been fine.  Just one example: Kinnner has sex with a girl he picked up in a bar while Damin is separated from them by a sheet. While this scene and a few others like it are more embarrassing then funny, overall the movie is good for a few solid chuckles.  But, I must say, if you're looking for non-stop side splitting laughter, you might want to look elsewhere.I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it, I'm only saying that you should not get your hopes up.

Joined at the hip - though technically at the torso - they live in Martha's Vineyard and own/operate a burger joint called Quickie Burger. Walt (Kinnear) wants to be an actor. Bob (Damon) has an on-line relationship with a beautiful Asian woman, named May (Wen Yann Shih), whom he hopes to meet someday.  The background of their lives is encapsulated in occasional quickie flasback segments showing all the crazy ways they deal with life as conjoined twins. They make the move to Hollywood so Walt can pursue his acting dream.  By chance, they meet Cher (playing herself) and get the chance to co-star in a new tv series she's doing.  Bob eventually meets May face-to-face and fumbles his way through their dates, somehow able to hide the fact that he is conjoined.  Walt meets April (Eva Mendes), an aspiring actress who accepts the conjoined twins with no qualms and falls for Walt. This is a touching, but very silly story made completely engaging and laugh-out-loud funny by the wonderful ensemble cast and characters. Many of the jokes and gags are related to their conjoined life.  It gets even funnier when they are surgically separated and have to adjust to walking and doing things alone. All in all, it's a very funny and entertaining movie.",5,Double the fun!,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1516,"['Double', 'fun', 'see', 'movie', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'are', 'funniest', 'playing', 'Bob', 'Walt', 'Tenor', 'pair', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'alike', 'barely', 'pass', 'brothers', 'overlooking', 'detail', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'Joined', 'hip', 'technically', 'torso', 'live', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'own/operate', 'burger', 'joint', 'called', 'Quickie', 'Burger', 'Walt', 'Kinnear', 'be', 'actor', 'Bob', 'Damon', 'on-line', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'Asian', 'woman', 'named', 'May', 'Wen', 'Yann', 'Shih', 'whom', 'meet', 'someday', 'background', 'lives', 'encapsulated', 'occasional', 'quickie', 'flasback', 'segments', 'showing', 'crazy', 'ways', 'deal', 'life', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'make', 'move', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'Walt', 'can', 'pursue', 'acting', 'dream', 'chance', 'meet', 'Cher', 'playing', 'get', 'chance', 'co-star', 'new', 'tv', 'series', 'doing', 'Bob', 'eventually', 'May', 'face-to-face', 'way', 'dates', 'somehow', 'able', 'hide', 'fact', 'conjoined', 'Walt', 'April', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'who', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'qualms', 'falls', 'Walt', 'touching', 'very', 'silly', 'story', 'made', 'completely', 'engaging', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'wonderful', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'characters', 'Many', 'jokes', 'gags', 'are', 'related', 'conjoined', 'life', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', 'are', 'surgically', 'separated', 'have', 'adjust', 'walking', 'doing', 'things', 'alone', 'very', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'movie']",N/A

618801,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JMG8,Eric,"[3, 4]","Well, it had to happen sooner or later. The Farrelly Brothers had to mature (somewhat) at some point and make a film that didn't rely on sex or gross-out jokes. That is apparently the case with Stuck On You, the Farrellys latest and tamest, but it's also one of their sweetest and funniest films to date.Bob and Walt Tenor (Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear) are conjoined twins who've spent their whole lives in Martha's Vineyard. Bob is the owner of a burger restaurant and Walt is an actor who performs plays for the town's audience, but he has bigger ambitions; he wants to be a Hollywood actor, much to the chagrin of Bob, who suffers from a distinct case of stagefright. But after some discussion and compromise, they agree to move to L.A. and start a new life for themselves.Upon arrival, Bob and Walt meet the friendly but ditzy April (Eva Mendes), one of their neighbors in the apartment they've just moved into. Bob even meets his internet pen-pal May (Wen Yann Shih), but because he's never told her he has a conjoined twin, he has to ""bring"" along Walt on their first date together. As for Walt's Hollywood dreams, after some initial lack of success, he's chosen by Cher herself to co-star with her on her new show, ""Honey and the Beaze,"" in an attempt by Cher to sabotage her own series. But the show is an unexpected success thanks to Walt's burgeoning popularity, which puts a crimp in his relationship with Bob.Reviewing comedies has always been a bit difficult for me, which is why I usually stick to the stuff that I find easier to write about (action/adventure, horror, drama, anything but comedy), but given all the knocks this film has taken (particularly the fact that barely anybody saw it in theaters) I felt a slight sense of obligation to mention that Stuck On You is the funniest and most touching comedy I've seen in recent memory.This is not to say that the film always had me choking with laughter (though a scene involving a guy in front of his typewriter did get the biggest laugh out of me all year), but rather that it consistently delivered smiles, chuckles, and solid laughs without ever bogging down, no easy feat for a movie that runs for just under two hours.Aside from the lack of sexual humor, there's a major difference between the style of comedy the Farrellys employ here than in some of their prior films. Whereas many their previous works have often made fun of the people that suffer from certain ""disorders,"" Stuck On You presents us with two friendly, easy-going guys who've grown accustomed to their situation and choose not to see their conjoined liver as a handicap. Rather, the film derives its humor from the way ""outsiders"" view their condition.In the film's two lead roles, Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear boast the kind of comic chemistry that most actors can only dream of. Damon, in particular, excels by taking the more ""straight man"" role, where he's not actually aiming for any laughs but still gets them anyway, maybe even more than the typically hilarious Kinnear. Watching these two guys stuck together reminds me why I find them two of the most likeable actors in Hollywood, even when most of Kinnear's characters are generally abrasive losers (but not in this case). It is, in fact, Damon and Kinnear that make the film as wonderfully entertaining as it is. Had not even half of the jokes worked as well as they did, their performances would still warrant this movie a passable recommendation.Stuck On You doesn't always juggle its various subplots perfectly; while Wen Yann Shih does play well into the film, a lot of brief cameos and a wide assortment of characters aren't meshed in as well. Worst of all is Cher, who's neither funny nor particularly convincing as the ""bitch"" she's made out to be. I have no idea if this says more about her personality or her acting skills.Most of the Farrellys comedies generally tend to dissipate in the last half-hour or so, replacing its humor with more sincere attempts at trying to make their irascible and/or ""cad-like"" protagonists learn a lesson or two. The magic of Stuck On You is that its protagonists are always the same throughout, making no genuine ""it's a miracle!"" revelations about themselves at the last minute; after all, brotherly love is still brotherly love.When the last twenty minutes threaten to devolve into sentimental clap-trap, the Farrellys punch in the necessary humor that defuses any of the building sap (spoiler:I think my favorite scene in the whole film is when Bob and Walt re-unite after parting their seperate ways, in a scene that's both hilarious and touching), making the film sweet without getting too sweet. The Farrellys have made a lot of funny movies, but this is the first of theirs I can recommend to just about anyone.**** 1/2 out of *****",4,Farrellys' best since There's Something About Mary.,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,4784,"['Well', 'had', 'happen', 'sooner', 'later', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'had', 'mature', 'somewhat', 'point', 'make', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'sex', 'gross-out', 'jokes', 'apparently', 'case', 'Stuck', 'Farrellys', 'latest', 'tamest', 'also', 'one', 'sweetest', 'funniest', 'films', 'date.Bob', 'Walt', 'Tenor', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'are', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'who', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'whole', 'lives', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'Bob', 'owner', 'burger', 'restaurant', 'Walt', 'actor', 'who', 'plays', 'town', 'audience', 'bigger', 'ambitions', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'much', 'chagrin', 'Bob', 'who', 'distinct', 'case', 'stagefright', 'discussion', 'compromise', 'agree', 'move', 'L.A.', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'themselves.Upon', 'arrival', 'Bob', 'Walt', 'meet', 'friendly', 'ditzy', 'April', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'one', 'neighbors', 'apartment', ""'ve"", 'just', 'moved', 'Bob', 'even', 'internet', 'pen-pal', 'May', 'Wen', 'Yann', 'Shih', 'never', 'told', 'conjoined', 'twin', 'bring', 'Walt', 'first', 'date', 'together', 'Walt', 'Hollywood', 'dreams', 'initial', 'lack', 'success', 'chosen', 'Cher', 'co-star', 'new', 'show', 'Honey', 'Beaze', 'attempt', 'Cher', 'sabotage', 'own', 'series', 'show', 'unexpected', 'success', 'thanks', 'Walt', 'burgeoning', 'popularity', 'crimp', 'relationship', 'Bob.Reviewing', 'comedies', 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'difficult', 'why', 'usually', 'stick', 'stuff', 'find', 'easier', 'write', 'action/adventure', 'horror', 'drama', 'anything', 'comedy', 'given', 'knocks', 'film', 'taken', 'particularly', 'fact', 'barely', 'anybody', 'saw', 'theaters', 'felt', 'slight', 'sense', 'obligation', 'mention', 'Stuck', 'funniest', 'most', 'touching', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory.This', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'always', 'had', 'choking', 'laughter', 'scene', 'involving', 'guy', 'front', 'typewriter', 'did', 'get', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'year', 'rather', 'consistently', 'delivered', 'smiles', 'chuckles', 'solid', 'laughs', 'ever', 'bogging', 'down', 'easy', 'feat', 'movie', 'just', 'two', 'hours.Aside', 'lack', 'sexual', 'humor', 'major', 'difference', 'style', 'comedy', 'Farrellys', 'employ', 'here', 'prior', 'films', 'Whereas', 'many', 'previous', 'works', 'have', 'often', 'made', 'fun', 'people', 'suffer', 'certain', 'disorders', 'Stuck', 'presents', 'two', 'friendly', 'easy-going', 'guys', 'who', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'accustomed', 'situation', 'choose', 'not', 'see', 'conjoined', 'liver', 'handicap', 'film', 'humor', 'way', 'outsiders', 'view', 'condition.In', 'film', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'boast', 'kind', 'comic', 'chemistry', 'most', 'actors', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'Damon', 'particular', 'excels', 'taking', 'more', 'straight', 'man', 'role', 'where', 'not', 'actually', 'aiming', 'laughs', 'still', 'anyway', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'typically', 'hilarious', 'Kinnear', 'Watching', 'two', 'guys', 'stuck', 'together', 'why', 'find', 'two', 'most', 'likeable', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'when', 'most', 'Kinnear', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'abrasive', 'losers', 'not', 'case', 'fact', 'Damon', 'Kinnear', 'make', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'Had', 'not', 'even', 'half', 'jokes', 'worked', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'performances', 'would', 'still', 'warrant', 'movie', 'passable', 'recommendation.Stuck', ""n't"", 'always', 'juggle', 'various', 'subplots', 'perfectly', 'Wen', 'Yann', 'Shih', 'play', 'well', 'film', 'lot', 'brief', 'cameos', 'wide', 'assortment', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'meshed', 'as', 'well', 'Worst', 'Cher', 'who', 'funny', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'bitch', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'have', 'idea', 'more', 'personality', 'acting', 'skills.Most', 'Farrellys', 'comedies', 'generally', 'tend', 'dissipate', 'last', 'half-hour', 'so', 'replacing', 'humor', 'more', 'sincere', 'attempts', 'trying', 'make', 'irascible', 'cad-like', 'protagonists', 'learn', 'lesson', 'two', 'magic', 'Stuck', 'protagonists', 'are', 'always', 'same', 'making', 'genuine', 'miracle', 'revelations', 'last', 'minute', 'brotherly', 'love', 'still', 'brotherly', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'threaten', 'devolve', 'sentimental', 'clap-trap', 'Farrellys', 'punch', 'necessary', 'humor', 'building', 'sap', 'spoiler', 'think', 'favorite', 'scene', 'whole', 'film', 'when', 'Bob', 'Walt', 're-unite', 'parting', 'seperate', 'ways', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'making', 'film', 'sweet', 'getting', 'too', 'sweet', 'Farrellys', 'have', 'made', 'lot', 'funny', 'movies', 'first', 'theirs', 'can', 'recommend', 'just', 'anyone', '****', '1/2', '*****']",N/A

The truth, however, is that this movie is at times hilarious and heart-warming at the same time.Walt (Greg Kinnear) and Bob (Matt Damon) are joined at the liver, living a semi-normal life in Martha's Vineyard.  They've ingratiated themselves to the community so much that they're seen as normal, accepted by all.  Equally independent (as much as possible anyway), Bob is the athlete and Walt is an aspiring actor, but both must deal with their linked limitations to gain happiness.  Along the way, of course, they consider separation, but regardless of the surgery they will never be apart.The funniest aspects of this film are the sporting competitions.  Seeing the twins pummel opponents boxing, strike out unaware batters, and lateral to one another in football is brilliant.  Their initial success, or lack thereof, in Hollywood is laugh out loud funny - especially their run-in with Rebecca Romijn Staymoist.  HA!  It doesn't end there; however, be on the look-out for the following scenes, which are all hilarious: the fight scene in a club, the Giant Teddy Bear dialogue with some serious tongue-in-cheek comedy, blue screen balancing acts, the obligatory gum sponsorship, and the rapid fire jailhouse puns.Eva Mendes plays a boob looking for acting stardom, providing the movie's ""heart,"" staying abreast of the brothers' difficulties and helping them get their secret of their chest(s).  She pets puppies in one scene and looks like a Hooter's waitress throughout the movie.  Also, tits.This isn't for everyone, but if you like stupid humor, the Farrelly brothers, or a collection of the absurd - including a Meryl Streep dance number - then this is worth the time.

It seems like one subject it would be impossible for them to walk their fine line being laughing with and laughing at.  However, after finally getting round to watching it i have to admit it was actually really good.  The Farrelly brothers always show an understanding and an eagerness to involve the plights of those less fortunate than themselves in their movies, which frankly must be a better way of treating the subject of disability than simply ignoring it like the rest of the movie industry.  In fact, South Park springs to mind as the only other vehicle brave enough to tackle the issues faced by conjoined persons on screen.I'll stop there before this becomes a call to award Trey, Matt, Bob or the other one a Nobel prize or anything, but it's something to think about.  &quot;Stuck on You&quot; is a very sweet film at heart.  The brother's bond with each other (slight pun intended) warms the heart, and there's plenty of sound relationship advice in there too (although if you're looking for relationship advice in a Farrelly brother's movie...).  Ultimately the plot serves more as a vehicle for stringing together a bunch of &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios that perhaps seemed a lot funnier when written down. Much of the humor does indeed derive from the brother's unfortunate predicament, but some of this is pure genius, for example in the opening scenes where the brothers are out jogging and a hot female jogger passes and says &quot;Hello&quot; to Greg Kinnear, but not to Matt Damon, who responds &quot;Wow, when did you meet her?!&quot;.  The bar fight scene is also pretty good, with Damon getting to show he hasn't forgotten the moves he learned for &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;.  Cher's acting is terrible and Meryl Steep looks out of place and embarrassed, but Damon is perfect and Kinnear gamely works with what he's given, although in the DVD extras he seemingly tries to disown the entire project.Finally, i thought the conclusion to the movie seemed both rushed and ill-considered - are we really to believe the boys had never fought and dreamed of separation before in their 32 years together?  And if the operation is so risky, why do Kinnear and Damon seem so unconcerned about it?  Still, thou shalt find better things to do with thy time and intellect than pick holes in the plot of Farrelly brothers movies.

Why cautious, you say?  For the simple fact that many will deem this film offensive before they even look at it, much like what happened to ""Shallow Hal.""  Instead of making fun of people with deformities or mental illnesses or other, they are glorified in this film.  Sure, it's done in a comedic way, but you have to give kudos to the Farrelly brothers for doing a film about dreamers like the Tenor brothers.  For one, they are attached at the hip.  Secondly, Matt Damon's character has panic attacks and, finally, Damon and Kinnear are completely oblivious to the fact that people see them as strange or different.  That's the  beauty of this film.  The Tenors try to be normal in a world where what is considered ""normal"" is actually more freakish and bizarre than their vision of reality.The film starts off near Martha's Vineyard where the Tenor brothers, attached since birth, work as a short order cook(Damon) and a local actor(Kinnear).  When Kinnear decides he wants to take a shot at the big time, he and his brother decide to head off to Hollywood to make it as a star....and his short order cook brother.  The two get along very well.  In fact, they act as if nothing is wrong with them, which is nice to see.  The only people pointing out differences are the ""normal"" folks.As the story rolls along, there are plenty of ups and downs, a cameo of Meryl Streep, and a run in with Cher, who turns in a solid supporting role as herself.  Eva Mendes plays the bubbly and hopeful friend of the Tenors.  She adds a wonderful spark to the film.  The rest of the cast are great as well, especially the guy who plays Moe.This is a fun film to watch.  It's full of great comedy, especially from Damon, who surprised me in his role.  Sure, there are a few jokes poked at the brothers' physical predicament, but in the end, we see this as a comedy about two brothers who really love one another and want only the best for each other.It seems that the only people who have real problems with films like this are the first ones to point out that the main characters have handicaps or are different in some way.  Why can't Siamese twins shoot for the stars?  Why should they be held back?  Just keep that in mind before blasting a film because one of the characters is a paraplegic, or autistic, or fat, or skinny, or black, or white, etc.....I think you get the idea.  Quit looking for the negative and just enjoy what's folding out in front of you:  A really good film.Highly recommmended to fans of the Farrelly's offbeat, yet unimaginably gentle at times, humor.

618814,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMG8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 14]","&quot;Stuck On You&quot; is a movie where half of the funniest parts are in the trailer.  But as is almost always the case in a Farrelly Brothers comedy, you come for the outrageous comedy and then get a healthy helping of heart because underneath all the &quot;hair gel&quot; and fat suits these guys are trying to make love stories.  The Farrelly Brothers might be two of the biggest romantics making movies today.  This is not one of their best films, but it does have its moments.In case you somehow missed the trailer &quot;Stuck On You&quot; is about Bo (Matt Damon) and Walter (Greg Kinnear) are a conjoined twins, what someone indelicately calls Siamese twins in the film despite the fact that the boys are American.  The fundamental gag here is that they being joined together like this makes them twice as good as anybody else.  You might be able to outrun a one legged man, but these guys have four legs so forget about it.  They run a burger joint at Martha's Vineyard, work crossword puzzles together, and play goalie for their amateur team.  About the only thing they do not do together is that Walter likes to act while Bo, who gets stage fright, has been e-mailing a girl in California for three years.  Walt wants to be an actor and talks Bo into heading for California, where people are not as accommodating towards the strange pair as they are back in Massachusetts.Once again the Farrelly Brothers are dealing with a subject that would not be considered politically correct, but after dealing with other personal afflictions and handicaps in their earlier films, this is hardly a surprise.  But they have such affection for their characters that you end up thinking that there is something wrong with people who do not find this humor funny.  Bo and Walter do not consider themselves handicapped and they are so proficient at everything they do it is hard to fault them for their sense of self-assuredness.The funniest bits in this film, as the trailer indicated, are when the boys play sports.  Baseball, football, hockey, or boxing, you do not want to mess with these boys, and when Walter wants to be an actor the stars align so that he gets to co-star with Cher in a television series.  The joke actually ends up being on Cher, who thought that acting with a conjoined twin would get her out of her contract.Meanwhile, Bo finally gets to meet his online pen pal, May (Wen Yann Shih), but he is too shy to tell her that there is a reason Walter is always there on his left.  Helping the boys keep their secret is April (Eva Mendes), who knows how things work in Southern California and who takes one look at the bridge of flesh joining the brothers and wants to know where they got it done.  But eventually the truth comes out and the boys are seriously considering having the surgery that will allow them to live separate lives.  Of course, we already know that not even surgery can really separate these two.Cher is not the only Oscar winning actress who shows she is a good sport in this film, because Meryl Streep is also along for the ride.  As is usually the case in a Farrelly Brothers film, they work in people they have met who are not stars like Jack Nicholson.

One unexpectedly rainy/hailing evening, a cookout at our friends house was postponed, so she popped in the DVD she had rented.  My husband and I laughed so hard.This movie was well-thought out and delightful.  Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear are great as conjoined twins who have lived their whole lives together, yet have very different personalities.  Kinnear is slick, who gets to bed the hotties, and Damon is shy and sweet.  Damon has been corresponding online with a woman for a long time, and yearns to meet her, but cannot bring himself to tell her the truth.  The two brothers run a successful diner in their small town in Maine, where they are loved and accepted for who they are.  Damon is happy to stay there, but Kinnear yearns for the bright lights of Hollywood.  So off they go so the brother can try his acting chops.While there, they are befriended by the owner of the cheap motel where they are staying, and a young lady whose heart is as big as her breast implants.  Much hilarity ensues, with some heart-warming moments as well, and a big musical finish with Meryl Streep.  Cher also has a fairly large role as a washed-up but bitchy movie star.

618817,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B00005JMG8,Marshall Lord,"[1, 1]","This is a touching and rather moving gentle comedy starring Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as Bob and Walt Tenor, a pair of conjoined twins who are determined to live normal lives to the full despite their condition and the consequent lengths they have to go to support each other's very different ambitions. Walt is the extrovert who wants to be an actor and comedian: Bob is introverted and shy, though a keen sportsman.As young children Walt and Bob had made each other a promise that neither of them would ever try to hold the other back, and the film is about the lengths they have to go to to keep that promise. At the start of the story they are running a successful fast food outlet in Martha's Vineyard, but early on Walt persuades Bob that they should move to Hollywood to follow Walt's ambition to become a film star. At first nobody takes them seriously, but through a ludicrous series of chances  Walt does get a chance at a TV role, and then the difficulties really start.While Walt is trying to build an acting career, Bob is trying to find romance with his internet pan pal, played by Wen Yann Shih, who is unaware of the fact that he is half of a set of conjoined twins.Although the film does not shy away from occasional, mostly gentle, jokes about the consequences of the twin's condition, I did not feel that this film was cruel about conjoined twins or people with disability generally. The film was far more scathing about people who saw the brothers as freaks. It presents them as a pair of regular guys who are coping heroically with an unusual set of circumstances.The rest of the cast was superb. Several Hollywood or TV personalities play themselves, including Cher, Meryl Streep, and Jay Leno - Cher in particular has some outrageous scenes taking the mickey out of herself. Eva Mendes, looking stunning, gives a lift to the film as a cheerful wannabee actress who becomes a supportive friend of the brothers.There are a few weak or embarrassing moments but overall this is a moving and entertaining film and I can recommend it.",4,Touching comedy,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,2053,"['touching', 'rather', 'moving', 'gentle', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Bob', 'Walt', 'Tenor', 'pair', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'live', 'normal', 'lives', 'full', 'condition', 'consequent', 'lengths', 'have', 'go', 'support', 'other', 'very', 'different', 'ambitions', 'Walt', 'extrovert', 'who', 'be', 'actor', 'comedian', 'Bob', 'introverted', 'shy', 'keen', 'sportsman.As', 'young', 'children', 'Walt', 'Bob', 'had', 'made', 'other', 'promise', 'would', 'ever', 'try', 'hold', 'other', 'back', 'film', 'lengths', 'have', 'go', 'keep', 'promise', 'start', 'story', 'are', 'running', 'successful', 'fast', 'food', 'outlet', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'early', 'Walt', 'persuades', 'Bob', 'should', 'move', 'Hollywood', 'follow', 'Walt', 'ambition', 'become', 'film', 'star', 'first', 'nobody', 'seriously', 'ludicrous', 'series', 'chances', 'Walt', 'get', 'chance', 'TV', 'role', 'then', 'difficulties', 'really', 'start.While', 'Walt', 'trying', 'build', 'acting', 'career', 'Bob', 'trying', 'find', 'romance', 'internet', 'pan', 'pal', 'played', 'Wen', 'Yann', 'Shih', 'who', 'unaware', 'fact', 'half', 'set', 'conjoined', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'occasional', 'mostly', 'gentle', 'jokes', 'consequences', 'twin', 'condition', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'cruel', 'about', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'people', 'disability', 'generally', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'scathing', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'brothers', 'freaks', 'pair', 'regular', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'coping', 'heroically', 'unusual', 'set', 'circumstances.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'superb', 'Several', 'Hollywood', 'TV', 'personalities', 'play', 'including', 'Cher', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Cher', 'particular', 'outrageous', 'scenes', 'taking', 'mickey', 'herself', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'looking', 'stunning', 'lift', 'film', 'cheerful', 'wannabee', 'actress', 'who', 'supportive', 'friend', 'are', 'few', 'weak', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'overall', 'moving', 'entertaining', 'film', 'can', 'recommend']",N/A

Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear play two thirty-something brothers who just happen to be joined at the hip...literally.  When Walt (Kinnear) decides he wants to go to Hollywood to make it big as an actor, Bob (Damon) agrees to go along for the ride (like he has much of a choice in the matter!).  Hilarity ensues when Walt lands a gig co-starring on a new television drama with Cher (who plays herself in the film).  Meanwhile, Bob attempts to establish a relationship with his longtime pen-pal (Wen Yann Shih), who somehow hasn't realized that she's dating a conjoined twin.There are a ton of funny moments in the film.  Obviously, Damon and Kinnear get to demonstrate a lot of physical comedy in their roles.  We see flashbacks of the brothers playing organized sports together in school, and there's a great scene where they manage to beat the crap out of half a dozen guys at a bar.  (They even get into a few brawls with each other.)  One of my favorite things about the movie is that after Walt and Bob get out of the hospital, Bob never fully regains his sense of balance since he's so used to leaning up against his brother.  (Walt doesn't seem to have that problem, though...I wonder why that is?) Meryl Streep also has a great cameo role as herself.  (The ""Bonnie and Clyde"" musical number at the end could be enough material in itself for a sequel, in my humble opinion.)""Stuck on You"" was much better than I had anticipated.

She is a very talented actress and the fact that she was playing herself in an almost self deprecating way as star who has seen better days, was very funny to watch. In addition to Cher,the film is loaded with cameos..always a sign that maybe..just maybe the filmmakers lacked inspiration:Having said all that, I am sure that many will still enjoy Stuck On You, but compared to what these very talented bothers have offered in the past, it will surely be very disappointing indeed.",3,Not What I Expected!,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,1878,"['Compared', 'such', 'hilarious', 'films', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Say', ""n't"", 'So', 'Stuck', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'latest', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'personal', 'expectations.The', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'problems', 'first', 'fact', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'duration', 'solely', 'based', 'one', 'gag', 'two', 'co-joined', 'twins', 'was', 'too', 'over', 'stretched', 'too', 'long', 'period', 'become', 'really', 'annoying', 'while.In', 'previous', 'Farrelly', 'Bros', 'films', 'gags', 'were', 'much', 'more', ""'disgustingly"", 'funny', 'varied', 'evenly', 'spread', 'most', 'characters..for', 'instance', 'Something', 'Mary', 'laughter', 'situation', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'slapstick', 'involved', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'as', 'well', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Lee', 'Evans', 'Chris', 'Elliott', 'others.In', 'short', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'possibilities', 'laughter', 'different', 'characters', 'was', 'absent', 'Stuck', 'You.The', 'second', 'problem', 'casting', 'lead', 'roles..No', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'are', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'not', 'comically', 'sweet', 'enough', 'Let', 'elaborate', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'had', 'helpless', 'endearing', 'expression', 'almost', ""'victim"", ""face'..not"", 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Clouseau', 'series', 'Francois', 'Pignon', 'Francis', 'Veber', 'films', 'something', 'created', 'lot', 'sympathy', 'enhanced', 'comedy', 'greatly.The', 'only', 'bright', 'moment', 'Stuck', 'was', 'Cher', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'fact', 'was', 'playing', 'almost', 'self', 'deprecating', 'way', 'star', 'who', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'watch', 'addition', 'Cher', 'film', 'loaded', 'cameos..always', 'sign', 'maybe', 'filmmakers', 'lacked', 'inspiration', 'Having', 'said', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Stuck', 'compared', 'what', 'very', 'talented', 'bothers', 'have', 'offered', 'past', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'very', 'disappointing', 'indeed']",N/A

618829,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,B00005JMG8,Patrick A. Hayden,"[7, 7]","The Farrelly brothers must be going soft in their middle age.  Despite the fact that they've never replicated the near-perfection of &quot;Kingpin&quot; and &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;, they don't seem to mind.  Their last two films, &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; and now &quot;Stuck On You&quot;, both deal with issues of family, love, and what we consider &quot;wierd&quot; in a person in honest and occasionally touching ways.  &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, however is much better than &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;.The film is about two conjoined twins, Walt(Greg Kinnear) and Bob(Matt Damon), who live in Martha's Vineyard where everyone sees them as normal.  They are conjoined at the waist, sharing a liver.  They could have been sperated with Walt being perfectly normal, but Walt would only of had a 50/50 chance at living.  Bob refused to let his brother take that chance.  They run a burger joint in town, and while Bob is the athelete, Walt is an aspiring actor.  Bob can't act and suffers from panic attacks.  What's great about this setup is that everyone knows Bob and Walt and knows that they're perfectly normal.  They're sensitive about being called &quot;freaks&quot; of course, but they are fiercely independent.  Walt, however, has a dream of being a real actor, and since they promised each other they would never hold the other back, they head to Hollywood to look for fame.Obviously, things don't come easy for the pair, and the film followd their various failures.  They have an agent who last worked in real Hollywood perhaps 30 years ago, hilariously played by Seymoure Cassell.  The first job he gets them is on a porn film.  Then, after a run-in with Cher, who wants out of a TV deal she has to make, Walt gets a break as her costar in &quot;Honey and the Beaze&quot;.  Walt really is a good actor, and as usual the brothers charm everyone they meet, and the show is a surprise hit, which infuriates Cher.The film is buoyed by the inherent humanity in all of the characters.  Hardly any one of them is portrayed in a put-down way.  Eva Mendes plays a silcone filled wannabe actress, and while she's kinda dumb, she's also sweet and never used by the Faralley's in the ovbious way other directors would.  Bob is in love with May, an internet sweerheart who doesn't know about his attachment to his brother.  She is played with some skill by Wen Yann Shih, and she strikes the perfect balance needed in the twisted world of teh Faralleys.  Walt and Bob are also very real.  They're human, they love each other, they just happen to share a liver.  The acting from Damon and Kinnear here is absurd.  The previews for this film seem to imply the two are dumb, which they aren't.  They're about as complex a pair that you'd find in a screwball comedy.The Faralley's have come a long way from the out and out grossness of &quot;Dumb &amp; Dumber&quot; which was just a gross-out comedy.  After a rocky start in &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;, they've successfully transitioned from full gross-out humor to a more PG-13 sensibility.  While sometimes their message of accepting those different from us is pounded a little to hard, &quot;Stuck on You&quot; manages to be both very funny and touching at the same time.  All this from the guys who gave us the zipper scene in &quot;Something About Mary&quot;.  What range.  I never would have guessed.  &quot;Stuck on You&quot; is mightily enterianing, endearing, and hilarious.",4,Surprisingly Funny &amp; Touching,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,3435,"['Farrelly', 'brothers', 'must', 'be', 'going', 'soft', 'middle', 'age', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'never', 'replicated', 'near-perfection', 'quot', 'Kingpin', 'quot', 'quot', 'Something', 'Mary', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'quot', 'Shallow', 'Hal', 'quot', 'now', 'quot', 'Stuck', 'quot', 'deal', 'issues', 'family', 'love', 'what', 'consider', 'quot', 'quot', 'person', 'honest', 'occasionally', 'touching', 'ways', 'quot', 'Stuck', 'quot', 'however', 'much', 'better', 'quot', 'Shallow', 'Hal', 'quot', '.The', 'film', 'two', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'Walt', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Bob', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'live', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'where', 'everyone', 'normal', 'are', 'conjoined', 'waist', 'sharing', 'liver', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sperated', 'Walt', 'being', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'Walt', 'would', 'only', 'had', '50/50', 'chance', 'living', 'Bob', 'refused', 'let', 'brother', 'take', 'chance', 'run', 'burger', 'joint', 'town', 'Bob', 'athelete', 'Walt', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'Bob', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'suffers', 'panic', 'attacks', 'What', 'great', 'setup', 'everyone', 'Bob', 'Walt', ""'re"", 'perfectly', 'normal', ""'re"", 'sensitive', 'being', 'called', 'quot', 'quot', 'course', 'are', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'Walt', 'however', 'dream', 'being', 'real', 'actor', 'promised', 'other', 'would', 'never', 'hold', 'other', 'back', 'head', 'Hollywood', 'look', 'fame.Obviously', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'easy', 'pair', 'film', 'followd', 'various', 'failures', 'have', 'agent', 'who', 'last', 'worked', 'real', 'Hollywood', 'perhaps', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'hilariously', 'played', 'Seymoure', 'Cassell', 'first', 'job', 'porn', 'film', 'Then', 'run-in', 'Cher', 'who', 'TV', 'deal', 'make', 'Walt', 'break', 'costar', 'quot', 'Honey', 'Beaze', 'quot', 'Walt', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'as', 'usual', 'brothers', 'charm', 'everyone', 'meet', 'show', 'surprise', 'hit', 'Cher.The', 'film', 'buoyed', 'inherent', 'humanity', 'characters', 'Hardly', 'one', 'portrayed', 'put-down', 'way', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'silcone', 'filled', 'wannabe', 'actress', 'kinda', 'dumb', 'also', 'sweet', 'never', 'used', 'Faralley', 'ovbious', 'way', 'other', 'directors', 'would', 'Bob', 'love', 'May', 'internet', 'sweerheart', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'attachment', 'brother', 'played', 'skill', 'Wen', 'Yann', 'Shih', 'perfect', 'balance', 'needed', 'twisted', 'world', 'teh', 'Faralleys', 'Walt', 'Bob', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'real', ""'re"", 'human', 'love', 'other', 'just', 'happen', 'share', 'liver', 'acting', 'Damon', 'Kinnear', 'here', 'absurd', 'previews', 'film', 'seem', 'imply', 'two', 'are', 'dumb', 'are', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'complex', 'pair', ""'d"", 'find', 'screwball', 'comedy.The', 'Faralley', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'out', 'grossness', 'quot', 'Dumb', 'amp', 'Dumber', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'gross-out', 'comedy', 'rocky', 'start', 'quot', 'Shallow', 'Hal', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'successfully', 'transitioned', 'full', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'more', 'PG-13', 'sensibility', 'sometimes', 'message', 'accepting', 'different', 'pounded', 'little', 'hard', 'quot', 'Stuck', 'quot', 'manages', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'touching', 'same', 'time', 'guys', 'who', 'gave', 'zipper', 'scene', 'quot', 'Something', 'Mary', 'quot', 'What', 'range', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'quot', 'Stuck', 'quot', 'mightily', 'enterianing', 'endearing', 'hilarious']",N/A

618834,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,B00005JMG8,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[1, 3]","It's fairly known that the Farrelly brothers's movies usually go for the gross-out jokes, the making fun of either disgusting situations or people's handicaps, or sometimes, both. To me this 'style' is hit or miss. Hits like There's something about Mary or Me, myself &amp; Irene, or misses like...well, pretty much everything else they've done. Including Stuck on you.Most people (including myself) thought Stuck on you would be one of the hits, since it starred Academy Award nominees Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as conjoined twins, and Academy Award winners Cher and Meryl Streep as well, themselves. However, upon watching the film it was clear that this was one of the misses. And if you take box-office gross as a measuring stick, this was THE MISS for the brothers.The basic premise is indeed funny, that of two conjoined brothers who excel at most everything they do while living in their little town near Martha's Vineyard, until they decide to move to L.A. so one of them can follow his dream of becoming an actor (you're following the crazy idea that only ONE of them is the actor, right?). Unfortunately, the whole thing falls flat in its face, and it's not because of Damon and Kinnear, who give pretty solid performances in what has to be a very difficult acting job (mainly for the logistics of it, not for the 'emotional depth' of the characters). It's just that most of the jokes are not funny, and the majority of those that work where shown in the trailers.In the other Farrelly films there's always one character (at least) that has some sort of handicap or disfiguration, in There's something about Mary it was the mentally challenged brother, in Me, myself &amp; Irene it was Charlie with his two personalities (and the albino guy), in Shallow Hal it was Walt, the friend with spina bifida and the hugely overweight Rosemary. In Stuck on you, the main characters are the ones with the handicap, and the jokes about they're condition stop being funny after a short while.That's not to say the film doesn't have its moments, like the filming of the TV show, or the teddy bear scene, or the first scenes after the separation. It's just that, as a whole, Stuck on you is not a very funny movie.

Either they could go for broke and make an over-the-top, no-holds-barred, totally tasteless slapstick comedy, or they could take a more realistic, low-keyed approach, emphasizing the sweetness and pathos inherent in the situation.  In the case of ""Stuck on You,"" the filmmakers clearly opted for the latter, and while I normally applaud any attempt at subtlety in a world cluttered with increasingly coarse cinematic offerings, in this case at least, the approach turns out to be entirely the wrong one.  This is a particular shock considering that the film is the brainchild of the Farrelly Brothers, who practically took out the patent on outrageous and insane ribald comedy.Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear star as twins, conjoined from birth, who leave their home in Martha's Vineyard to seek fame and fortune as actors in Hollywood.  On paper, this premise sounds tailor-made for the Farrelly Brothers, yet the boys strike out in their own ballpark.  Rather than pushing the envelope, the film settles for a cozy, comfy tone, never really exploiting the true absurdist potential of the material.  We keep expecting the writers to throw caution to the wind and to really go for the down-and-dirty, but instead, they keep giving us dewy-eyed sentiment and feel-good populism.  This is no denigration of either Damon or Kinnear who, beyond having the physical shtick down perfectly, manage to develop distinct personalities for their characters.  Playing herself, Cher deserves the Good Sport Award for allowing the writers to lampoon her without mercy, although their portraying her as practically a child molester may be going a bit too far.  Still, it is just that sort of iconoclastic outrageousness that is so lacking in the rest of the film.Yes, there a few funny moments in the course of the film, but, on the whole, the movie feels flat and uninspired, culminating in a truly wretched musical finale that is neither entertaining nor funny, but which seems to drone on for a minor eternity.  In fact, that pretty much describes the movie as a whole.  ""Stuck on You"" has a great comic premise and some clever visual gags, but it is slow, ponderous, sappy, and not nearly funny enough.  Maybe it's the Farrelly Brothers - and not the brothers on screen - who have been stuck together too long.",2,wrong way to play this material,1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,2433,"['way', 'see', 'makers', 'Stuck', 'had', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'viable', 'options', 'deciding', 'how', 'best', 'approach', 'material', 'could', 'go', 'broke', 'make', 'over-the-top', 'no-holds-barred', 'totally', 'tasteless', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'could', 'take', 'more', 'realistic', 'low-keyed', 'approach', 'emphasizing', 'sweetness', 'pathos', 'inherent', 'situation', 'case', 'Stuck', 'filmmakers', 'clearly', 'opted', 'latter', 'normally', 'applaud', 'attempt', 'subtlety', 'world', 'cluttered', 'increasingly', 'coarse', 'cinematic', 'offerings', 'case', 'least', 'approach', 'out', 'be', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'one', 'particular', 'shock', 'considering', 'film', 'brainchild', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'who', 'practically', 'took', 'out', 'patent', 'outrageous', 'insane', 'ribald', 'comedy.Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'star', 'twins', 'conjoined', 'birth', 'who', 'leave', 'home', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'seek', 'fame', 'fortune', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'paper', 'premise', 'tailor-made', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'yet', 'boys', 'strike', 'own', 'ballpark', 'Rather', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'film', 'settles', 'cozy', 'comfy', 'tone', 'never', 'really', 'exploiting', 'true', 'absurdist', 'potential', 'material', 'keep', 'expecting', 'writers', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'really', 'go', 'down-and-dirty', 'instead', 'keep', 'giving', 'dewy-eyed', 'sentiment', 'feel-good', 'populism', 'denigration', 'Damon', 'Kinnear', 'who', 'having', 'physical', 'shtick', 'down', 'perfectly', 'manage', 'develop', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'characters', 'Playing', 'Cher', 'Good', 'Sport', 'Award', 'allowing', 'writers', 'lampoon', 'mercy', 'portraying', 'practically', 'child', 'molester', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'Still', 'just', 'sort', 'iconoclastic', 'outrageousness', 'so', 'lacking', 'rest', 'film.Yes', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'course', 'film', 'whole', 'movie', 'feels', 'flat', 'uninspired', 'culminating', 'truly', 'wretched', 'musical', 'finale', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'drone', 'minor', 'eternity', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'whole', 'Stuck', 'great', 'comic', 'premise', 'clever', 'visual', 'gags', 'slow', 'ponderous', 'sappy', 'not', 'nearly', 'funny', 'enough', 'Maybe', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'not', 'brothers', 'screen', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'stuck', 'together', 'too', 'long']",N/A

I enjoy some of their work, but generally the crude humor and overall goofiness doesn't really strike a chord with me.  However, I was still curious to see this movie because I read some positive reviews and because Matt Damon isn't an overly goofy actor.  Thus, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this fairly light & easy film.For those who don't know, the basic premise of the movie is that Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt (Greg Kinnear) are Siamese, sorry ""conjoined,"" twins.  Though there's only a 9 inch long strip of flesh joining the two together, they have chosen for 32 years to NOT get separated because Bob has most of their one liver and Walt might not survive the surgery.  Instead, the odd pair grew up and thrived together in an isolated, nurturing community in Martha's  Vineyard.  With an incredibly optimistic outlook, they have decided that neither would hold the other back.  They own a hopping burger joint, play sports, have girlfriends and act - well, Walt acts while the stage-fright Bob is disguised as a prop.Everything changes when Walt - the stereotypical outgoing, fun-loving dreamer - wants to move to Hollywood to pursue acting.  Bob - the serious, practical, sensitive one - reluctantly leaves his comfortable home with the promise of meeting up with the woman he's had a 3 year relationship with over the Internet.  From there, the movie takes off on a journey through the ins and out of becoming famous and then winds down to a very predictable but satisfying conclusion.I think the reason why I like this movie so much is because much of the humor is very subtle and softly ironical.  First off, they make no attempt to get the two actors to look anything alike & never mention this, though by definition Siamese twins should be identical.  Then, the brothers often say and do things normal for us but ironic here; e.g., after he decks Walt, Bob tries to run away from him.  On top of this, there are many clever & humorous scenes playing on the Siamese nature to the utmost - the teddy bear scene is hilarious, as is the whole DUI scene.  Having Cher, Meryl Streep and Jay Leno play themselves added a level of ironic Hollywood humor that usually worked.  And Morty the agent is just randomly laughable.For those who care to know: although the Farrelly brothers restrain their most of their crude humor, there is some sexually suggestive material that might make viewers uncomfortable.  Otherwise, the movie was fairly clean.In the end, it was a satisfying movie with easy laughs.",4,Subtly Funny with a Mostly Predictable Plot,1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,2596,"['should', 'say', 'up', 'front', ""'m"", 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'typical', 'Farrelly', 'Brother', 'type', 'humor', 'enjoy', 'work', 'generally', 'crude', 'humor', 'overall', 'goofiness', ""n't"", 'really', 'strike', 'chord', 'However', 'was', 'still', 'curious', 'see', 'movie', 'read', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Matt', 'Damon', ""n't"", 'overly', 'goofy', 'actor', 'Thus', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'fairly', 'light', 'easy', 'film.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'Bob', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Walt', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'are', 'Siamese', 'sorry', 'conjoined', 'only', '9', 'inch', 'long', 'strip', 'flesh', 'joining', 'two', 'together', 'have', 'chosen', '32', 'years', 'NOT', 'get', 'separated', 'because', 'Bob', 'most', 'one', 'liver', 'Walt', 'might', 'not', 'survive', 'surgery', 'Instead', 'odd', 'pair', 'grew', 'up', 'thrived', 'together', 'isolated', 'nurturing', 'community', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'incredibly', 'optimistic', 'outlook', 'have', 'decided', 'would', 'hold', 'other', 'back', 'own', 'hopping', 'burger', 'joint', 'play', 'sports', 'have', 'girlfriends', 'act', 'well', 'Walt', 'stage-fright', 'Bob', 'disguised', 'prop.Everything', 'changes', 'when', 'Walt', 'stereotypical', 'outgoing', 'fun-loving', 'dreamer', 'move', 'Hollywood', 'pursue', 'acting', 'Bob', 'serious', 'practical', 'sensitive', 'one', 'reluctantly', 'comfortable', 'home', 'promise', 'meeting', 'up', 'woman', 'had', '3', 'year', 'relationship', 'Internet', 'there', 'movie', 'off', 'journey', 'ins', 'becoming', 'famous', 'then', 'down', 'very', 'predictable', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.I', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'like', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'because', 'much', 'humor', 'very', 'subtle', 'softly', 'ironical', 'First', 'off', 'make', 'attempt', 'get', 'two', 'actors', 'look', 'anything', 'alike', 'never', 'mention', 'definition', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'should', 'be', 'identical', 'Then', 'brothers', 'often', 'say', 'do', 'things', 'normal', 'ironic', 'here', 'Walt', 'Bob', 'run', 'away', 'top', 'are', 'many', 'clever', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'playing', 'Siamese', 'nature', 'utmost', 'teddy', 'bear', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'whole', 'DUI', 'scene', 'Having', 'Cher', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'play', 'added', 'level', 'ironic', 'Hollywood', 'humor', 'usually', 'worked', 'Morty', 'agent', 'just', 'randomly', 'laughable.For', 'who', 'care', 'know', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'restrain', 'most', 'crude', 'humor', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'material', 'might', 'make', 'viewers', 'uncomfortable', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'clean.In', 'end', 'was', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'easy', 'laughs']",N/A

The Farrelly's last two lackluster installments, Shallow Hal &amp; Stuck on You, barely raised a giggle.  For some reason, the Farrelly brothers have gone all sentimental and sensitive, and apart from the general absurdity of the premises of the story, Stuck on You just does not deliver the significant belly laughs of a Dumb and Dumber, for example.The Farrelly brothers seem to have lost their comedic edge, and even appearances by Meryl Streep and Cher cannot add enough interest to the weak storyline to keep it moving forward for nearly two hours.  Sadly, the blooper reel is funnier than the film (don't miss Greg Kinnear's extended Ted Koppel and Johnny Carson impressions), and the documentary about the Farrelly's seems to have more of a plot than the feature.I used to watch Farrelly films as a guilty pleasure.  The crude, sophomoric humor of Me, Myself, &amp; Irene, Dumb &amp; Dumber, and Something About Mary provided a release and escape without causing me to have to think too much, and that was the Farrelys' forte.  In making us sympathetic to the plight of their characters, the Farrelly brothers have also excised almost all the situational humor.  Sure, the visual of conjoined twins playing goalie is mildly amusing, but the big laughs just are not there.

When amateur stage actor Walt finally decides to travel to LA, and be a professional one, Bob also goes too ... rather reluctantly.  But in Hollywood their luck turns out good, maybe better than they expected, because of the unexpected success of TV series starring Cher.  Yes, that's her.Nobody would think of this idea, let alone try to make it a real Hollywood studio movie.  Farelly Brothers do, and moreover can get Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as the conjoined twins.  You would not only see them 'stuck' on each other (thanks to the special make-up division), but get some laughs from their gags, which are admittedly quite ... unique.  (Did you see the most 'unfair' boxing fighting in history?)The predictable nature of the film cannot be denied.  Shy Bob has been exchanging letters with a nice girl May, but cannot tell the truths about his body.  Can he tell?  Or Cher plays herself as very deliciously mean character, well, at first glance, of course.  Is she really so?  You get the answers before the film starts.Still, there are very funny moments (and many, I found), and many cameos are certainly delightful, which include Meryl Streep (as herself), Griffin Dunn (as himself), and, oh, did you know Cher (in this film, I mean) is dating with the star of 'Agent Cody Banks'?The story and the gags are not offensive as you might believe.  The real problem is that 'Stuck on You' nearly depends on the sentimental feelings, in the second half in particular.  And if you are seeking for body fluids here, Farrelly Bros. refused to us them this time.The film is too long (120 mins), and its premise about the conjoined twins is clearly streched too much, but you should wait for the best scene coming at the end.  The last musical section featuring Streep and Kennear is so fantastic that you may forget any flaws, or even that this movie is directed by the brothers who did 'Shallow Hal.'  Not great, but still entertaining and pretty funny thanks to the great comic timings of Damon and Kennear.",3,(3 1/2) Farrelly Bros Gone Soft; Still Great Comic Acting,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,2071,"['Conjoined', 'twins', 'Bob', 'Walt', 'are', 'living', 'Martha', 'Vinyard', 'When', 'amateur', 'stage', 'actor', 'Walt', 'finally', 'travel', 'LA', 'be', 'professional', 'one', 'Bob', 'also', 'too', 'rather', 'reluctantly', 'Hollywood', 'luck', 'out', 'good', 'maybe', 'better', 'expected', 'unexpected', 'success', 'TV', 'series', 'starring', 'Cher', 'Yes', 'her.Nobody', 'would', 'think', 'idea', 'let', 'alone', 'try', 'make', 'real', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'movie', 'Farelly', 'Brothers', 'do', 'moreover', 'can', 'get', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'other', 'thanks', 'special', 'make-up', 'division', 'get', 'laughs', 'gags', 'are', 'admittedly', 'quite', 'unique', 'Did', 'see', 'most', 'boxing', 'fighting', 'history', 'predictable', 'nature', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'Shy', 'Bob', 'been', 'exchanging', 'letters', 'nice', 'girl', 'May', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'truths', 'body', 'Can', 'tell', 'Cher', 'very', 'deliciously', 'mean', 'character', 'well', 'first', 'glance', 'course', 'really', 'so', 'get', 'answers', 'film', 'starts.Still', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'many', 'found', 'many', 'cameos', 'are', 'certainly', 'delightful', 'include', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'herself', 'Griffin', 'Dunn', 'oh', 'did', 'know', 'Cher', 'film', 'mean', 'dating', 'star', ""'Agent"", 'Cody', 'Banks', 'story', 'gags', 'are', 'not', 'offensive', 'might', 'believe', 'real', 'problem', 'nearly', 'sentimental', 'feelings', 'second', 'half', 'particular', 'are', 'seeking', 'body', 'fluids', 'here', 'Farrelly', 'Bros.', 'refused', 'time.The', 'film', 'too', 'long', '120', 'mins', 'premise', 'conjoined', 'twins', 'clearly', 'streched', 'too', 'much', 'should', 'wait', 'best', 'scene', 'coming', 'end', 'last', 'musical', 'section', 'featuring', 'Streep', 'Kennear', 'so', 'fantastic', 'may', 'forget', 'flaws', 'even', 'movie', 'directed', 'brothers', 'who', 'did', ""'Shallow"", 'Hal', 'Not', 'great', 'still', 'entertaining', 'pretty', 'funny', 'thanks', 'great', 'comic', 'timings', 'Damon', 'Kennear']",N/A
