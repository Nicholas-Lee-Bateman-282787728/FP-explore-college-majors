Noah McManus (Jesse Metcalfe) has just successfully got himself a job as aide to Senator William Hayden (Art Hindle). Noah's job, before he applied for the job with the Senator, was as aide to the Mayor of Boston, who is panicking as she is coming up for re-election. Noah quits his job with the mayor so Noah's assistant has to run the Mayor's campaign - with constant telephone advice from Noah. With his new-found success, Noah pops the question to his long-time fianc&eacute;e, planning to start their new life together in Washington, only to find that she has another lover. So, the wedding is off but Noah has ordered the ring to be delivered at a romantic inn in Fairfield Road, Harpswell, Cape Cod, so he has to go there to collect it. On the way, he hears that the Senator is to be charged with corruption and embezzlement - so that job is now out too. The proprietors of the inn, Sam and Lillian Peabody (Derek McGrath, Chick Reid) are very understanding and encourage young Noah to stay with them anyway, sans fianc&eacute;e. That very evening there is a Preservation Society dinner at which the redevelopment of the town to include a huge new shopping mall comes up. Sam is against it and Noah gets drawn into the argument. Noah makes a convincing case to approve the development - but another opponent is local bookstore owner Hailey Caldwell (Natalie Lisinska) who is a confirmed environmentalist. Hailey shows Noah why she opposes the development by taking him to the local beauty spots.

They were very cute together.  Although, I have to admit that I thought it weird that he became so attracted to her just hours after breaking off his engagement.

Obviously she didn't really love him or she wouldn't have been cheating on him.  I guess it turned out how it was supposed to though, because he met Hailey.

He ends up chasing a diamond ring up to scenic Cape Cod, off season, at the pretty little town of Harpswell.  It's simple bucolic existence threatened by development.He discovers love (or is he just on the rebound?) and begins to question his life's goals.  Will he stay here in Harpswell or bail out to the big city and big dreams?  Stay tuned.It's all very much done before. The actors are fine and likable, mostly.
