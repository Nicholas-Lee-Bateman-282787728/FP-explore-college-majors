Well, they didn't quite live up to his expectations.  The special effects were good enough for young children but the fighting scenes were badly done.  It looked like they were taking turns to swing their swords.Dragonquest storyline sounded interesting unfortunately the movie and actors couldn't deliver.  Nobody could act and the nude scene in the beginning was completely unnecessary.  The young keeper's adventures in finding the precious stones to complete his task were boring.  During one of his so-called adventures, the keeper stood in a cave motionless, just to let a giant spider (or some sort) walk by him.  That's all he needed to do to obtain a stone. How thrilling was that?  The ending of the movie was a bit better because there's not much acting, just a lot of special effects.The acting of the Merlin and The War of The Dragons was better compared to Dragonquest though some of the actors and actresses sounded more like reciting a school play.  Worst yet, the camera constantly zoomed in on people's faces as a result most of the beautiful Welsh scenes were wasted.  You can't really see what else was going on other than the close up expressions.  After a while it became annoying. The dragons in this movie looked a lot better than the good & evil transparent dragons in DragonQuest, but the story development was not well connected and remained unexplained.  My two boys sat through the movie simply because they thought I would be offended if they didn't finish it.For Merlin and The War of The Dragons, I give it 3 stars.  But for Dragonquest I give it only 1 star.  That averages 2 stars for this double feature.",2,One was all right while the other was pretty awful,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,1762,"['Good', 'thing', 'only', '6.99', '9-year-old', 'son', 'loves', 'dragons', 'so', 'thought', 'movies', 'would', 'least', 'entertain', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'young', 'children', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'were', 'badly', 'done', 'looked', 'were', 'taking', 'turns', 'swing', 'swords.Dragonquest', 'storyline', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'Nobody', 'could', 'act', 'nude', 'scene', 'beginning', 'was', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'young', 'keeper', 'adventures', 'finding', 'precious', 'stones', 'complete', 'task', 'were', 'boring', 'one', 'so-called', 'adventures', 'keeper', 'stood', 'cave', 'motionless', 'just', 'let', 'giant', 'spider', 'sort', 'walk', 'needed', 'do', 'obtain', 'stone', 'How', 'thrilling', 'was', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'better', 'not', 'much', 'acting', 'just', 'lot', 'special', 'effects.The', 'acting', 'Merlin', 'War', 'Dragons', 'was', 'better', 'compared', 'Dragonquest', 'actors', 'actresses', 'sounded', 'more', 'reciting', 'school', 'play', 'Worst', 'yet', 'camera', 'constantly', 'zoomed', 'people', 'result', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Welsh', 'scenes', 'were', 'wasted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'was', 'going', 'other', 'close', 'up', 'expressions', 'while', 'became', 'annoying', 'dragons', 'movie', 'looked', 'lot', 'better', 'good', 'evil', 'transparent', 'dragons', 'DragonQuest', 'story', 'development', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'connected', 'remained', 'unexplained', 'two', 'boys', 'sat', 'movie', 'simply', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'offended', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'it.For', 'Merlin', 'War', 'Dragons', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'Dragonquest', 'give', 'only', '1', 'star', '2', 'stars', 'double', 'feature']",Dragonquest
1226969,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B001PCOSV4,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","The Asylum is a film company best known for making low-budget affairs. Like Full Moon Films, most movies are filmed on location in countries and whatnot where pretty much the movies take place. For the most part, their movies are enjoyable. However, unlike Full Moon, instead of putting out movies based on original properties- they've earned a reputation of making their 'version' of others films. Course, if anyone cared to look, they have alot more original films to their credit than people realize. Thankfully, this collection is of the latter.Merlin & The War of the Dragons is a movie loosely based on the legends of King Arthur and Merlin. Whereas Dragonquest is about an evil wizard, wishing to conquer the world for his own, unleashes a dragon onto the world to terrorize the peasant folk into submission. A small resistance has formed to defeat him utilizing the strength of a dragon believed to be the only creature in the land that can match the fire dragon in strength, and so the vigilantes set out in their quest for the dragon to save the kingdom.Both movies are pretty decent efforts, in my opinion. If I had to pick a favorite out of the two, it would have to be Merlin & The War of the Dragons. Even though it takes some liberties with the story, it was played seriously and kept my interest all the way throughout. Dragonquest, on the other hand, was...well, strange. Was it supposed to be a campy movie or a more serious effort? I really couldn't tell with Marc Singer doing his best Popeye impression(lol).

1226970,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B001PCOSV4,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[0, 0]","""Daragonquest"" should have been a fairly good movie since it had a decent cast, a passable plot, and even a fair amount of CGI effects. I actually like even mostly bad Sword & Sorcery movies, so it's hard to say exactly when I noticed that getting through the entire 1 hour and 25 minutes was going to be rough.I'm not really sure at which market this straight to video movie was aimed at. The lead character (and ""Hero of Virtue"" I might add), Arkadi (Daniel Bonjour), besides being woefully passive, is fond of smoking mind altering magic ""weed"" and spying on partially undressed girls. There are several other ""real"" actors, including Marc Singer (who looks almost permanently annoyingly amused), Brian Thompson (seriously underutilized), Jason Connery (actually not too bad), and Jennifer Dorogi (really not action movie hero material). The supporting cast was wooden at best and gave almost laughable delivery of their lines.The plot follows a standard quest type format and should have been enough to hold the movie together, but sadly it was dragged down by the bad acting, a really bad script, and very bad, although plentiful, CGI effects. The cinematography was fairly good in most of the traveling scenes but was seriously marred by the bad and disjointed editing of the action scenes that was required to mask the poor hand to hand fighting skills of the actors. There are also a painful amount of continuity errors and lack of attention to detail; for example, I am fairly certain that a naked sword carried in rope belt would not make a ""metallic ringing"" sound when drawn.There really is very little to recommend about this movie, other than it is in Sword & Sorcery genre. Only if you have a driven desire (like me) to see all movies of this type would want to invest your time here, otherwise I would pass on this one (I only wish I could have).CFH",2,Uninspired,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,1865,"['Daragonquest', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'decent', 'cast', 'passable', 'plot', 'even', 'fair', 'amount', 'CGI', 'effects', 'actually', 'even', 'mostly', 'bad', 'Sword', 'Sorcery', 'movies', 'hard', 'say', 'exactly', 'when', 'noticed', 'getting', 'entire', '1', 'hour', '25', 'minutes', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'rough.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'market', 'straight', 'video', 'movie', 'was', 'aimed', 'lead', 'character', 'Hero', 'Virtue', 'might', 'add', 'Arkadi', 'Daniel', 'Bonjour', 'being', 'woefully', 'passive', 'fond', 'smoking', 'mind', 'altering', 'magic', 'weed', 'spying', 'partially', 'undressed', 'girls', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'real', 'actors', 'including', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'who', 'almost', 'permanently', 'annoyingly', 'amused', 'Brian', 'Thompson', 'seriously', 'underutilized', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'actually', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'Jennifer', 'Dorogi', 'really', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'hero', 'material', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'wooden', 'best', 'gave', 'almost', 'laughable', 'delivery', 'lines.The', 'plot', 'standard', 'quest', 'type', 'format', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'sadly', 'was', 'dragged', 'down', 'bad', 'acting', 'really', 'bad', 'script', 'very', 'bad', 'plentiful', 'CGI', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'most', 'traveling', 'scenes', 'was', 'seriously', 'marred', 'bad', 'disjointed', 'editing', 'action', 'scenes', 'was', 'required', 'mask', 'poor', 'hand', 'hand', 'fighting', 'skills', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'painful', 'amount', 'continuity', 'errors', 'lack', 'attention', 'detail', 'example', 'am', 'fairly', 'certain', 'naked', 'sword', 'carried', 'rope', 'belt', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'metallic', 'ringing', 'sound', 'when', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'recommend', 'movie', 'other', 'Sword', 'Sorcery', 'genre', 'Only', 'have', 'driven', 'desire', 'see', 'movies', 'type', 'would', 'want', 'invest', 'time', 'here', 'otherwise', 'would', 'pass', 'one', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', '.CFH']",Dragonquest

But they did a good job pulling it together and it is better than most low budget movies.  The story is sound, the actors are ok and did there job well.  The photography is nicely done, it is not epic, but it is good.  The special effects are very well done, modern CGI for the dragons.The story itself is a simple one, very much like the Star Wars movie, a farm boy is raised not knowing he is the chosen one who is suddenly thrust into an adventure.  One of the cut scenes in the special features on the DVD had the boy complaining to grandfather about not being able to go work in the mines that all of his friends had already started working there.  That would have been to much of a copy of Star Wars, good that they removed it.  Other scenes that they cut I wished that they left in, it would have made the movie flow better, that is to say easier to understand the story.The basic story is that the boy's caretaker, i.e. grandfather, undertook the quest himself and came near the end and failed.  So he raised the boy and schooled him in the values need to complete the quest.  However before the boy is fully trained the dragon is released and the boy has to begin the quest early.  What is the quest?  Well in the land there was a group of monks who were knights and had keep the land in a state of harmony, until one of the monks turned bad and drew power from the dark forces, creating a dragon.  So the boys quest and the quest that grandfather had failed at? It is to collect the seven stones of virtue and call a good dragon to battle the evil one.  The boy must learn the virtues of prudence, justice, restraint, fortitude, faith, hope and love.  If this sounds to Christian to some of you I might point out that the seven virtues come from Plato and Aristotle and were only adopted by early church fathers (they do not come from the Bible, what is in the Bible is the fruit of the Spirit and does over lap in some cases with the seven virtues).But it is a good story and well worth buying the DVD for to watch.

And the scene with the Giant Spider Which Does Nothing is worth the Netflix order alone.All in all, ""Dragonquest"" comes off as a bunch of renfaire friends who got together and made their own fantasy movie, with some bargain basement CGI spliced in. On that level, it's a pleasant enough bit of fun.Don't buy this one for full price; that would just be foolish.

Naturally, there is no room for any special features. There are no trailers, subtitles, alyrtnate languages, etc.  There is a menu, but after 10 seconds or so it simply plays the first film. With no intervention,the disc will cycle though menu and first film repeatedly.And the first film is rather silly. The hero wanders around gathering jewels to stuff in his pendant.  When the pendant is full, he can defeat the dragon.  Marc Singer is old warrior helping out the hero.  He really hams it up.  None of the other actors will win any awards either.  The CGI is not real bad, but it is second class.  I sat through the movie once, but I doubt that I will watch it again.The second film is better.  This is the story of the origin of Merlin, except that it takes quite a few liberties with the usual story. J&uuml;rgen Prochnow stars as Merlin's mentor.

Their just fun (even interesting) movies that aren't reaching for the stars, nonetheless can be good in their own way. DragonQuest (2009) is one of these.The story here is of a fabled world and a reluctant young man (Arkadi/Daniel Bonjour) who is more interested in the ladies yet nevertheless goes on a journey, the path of discovering the seven virtues which is ultimately an inner journey of self-discovery for him. It is a journey which brings victory and his well-being/maturity. And which includes here i might add, a reliable, solid, true companion Katya/Jennifer Dorogi - a strong and well played female part. Kind of a yin/yang thing which also plays into the whole Dragon theme of the story - dragon of light/truth and one of darkness/fear - the real and the unreal.This is done in a non-heavy handed way with a playful wise teacher Maxim/Marc Singer. The only real setback for this though is his ""death scene"", which is truly ridiculous, and mainly because the scene is so heavy-handed with his last speech being so self-important. It just didn't go well with the rest of his character. But i just looked passed it.Now besides that, the guys who put this together really put some thought into this movie - well made - just don't expect another movie like Lord of the Rings or make any comparison to anything else - just take it for what it is (don't look for perfection) and you might find something interesting and enjoy it.",5,The Yin and the Yang of Dragons,1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,1593,"[""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'are', 'small', 'budget', 'non-grandiose', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'CGI', 'even', 'so-called', 'academy', 'award', 'winning', 'acting', 'Their', 'just', 'fun', 'even', 'interesting', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'reaching', 'stars', 'nonetheless', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'DragonQuest', '2009', 'one', 'these.The', 'story', 'here', 'fabled', 'world', 'reluctant', 'young', 'man', 'Arkadi/Daniel', 'Bonjour', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'ladies', 'yet', 'nevertheless', 'journey', 'path', 'discovering', 'seven', 'virtues', 'ultimately', 'inner', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'journey', 'victory', 'well-being/maturity', 'here', 'i', 'might', 'add', 'reliable', 'solid', 'true', 'companion', 'Katya/Jennifer', 'Dorogi', 'strong', 'well', 'played', 'female', 'part', 'Kind', 'yin/yang', 'thing', 'also', 'whole', 'Dragon', 'theme', 'story', 'dragon', 'light/truth', 'one', 'darkness/fear', 'real', 'unreal.This', 'done', 'non-heavy', 'handed', 'way', 'playful', 'wise', 'teacher', 'Maxim/Marc', 'Singer', 'only', 'real', 'setback', 'though', 'death', 'scene', 'truly', 'ridiculous', 'mainly', 'scene', 'so', 'heavy-handed', 'last', 'speech', 'being', 'so', 'self-important', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'rest', 'character', 'i', 'just', 'looked', 'passed', 'it.Now', 'guys', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'really', 'put', 'thought', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'make', 'comparison', 'anything', 'else', 'just', 'take', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'perfection', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'interesting', 'enjoy']",Dragonquest
