1503005,A3E1F9WH37V7JL,B005SYZYZ4,"Bill Rednight ""60s Child""","[0, 0]","I walked into this movie about 45 minutes late as a middle schooler eagerly anticipating just another double bill a year or so after it was first released and enjoyed the hell out of it. Through the years, I'd felt a little hollow not knowing what I missed but was ecstatic to find it was recently released on DVD. Well, I bought the thing and wasn't exactly bowled over all these years later with the plotline I had missed way back when. Quite frankly, the first half of the movie drags, and little is given away as to who the three main characters are or why we should care. This negates any steam the film tries to muster in the remaining reels. A few comments in this forum have brought up a comparison to Bogart, but, no, George C. Scott aptly plays just another steady, thinking man's character while his career was in full swing on the heels of his Oscar win. And he's in fine form even if he doesn't have much of a role to settle into. The recently departed Tony Musante plays a flakey hitman whose a bit jumpy with his lines (sometimes Scott looks more preturbed with this actor's delivery than as the character reacting to it), and Trish Van Devere, Scott's soon-to-be real-life wife, is quaintly unruffled as the hitman's girl. It seems as if any young, attractive actress at the time could have played the part. That, coupled with a few widely scattered plot twists, one good explosion, and a too sudden finale that allows the wrong guy to get away can't save this modest actioner. At least Scott gave it a confident enough go.",4,Not as Fast-Paced as It Could Have Been,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,1539,"['walked', 'movie', '45', 'minutes', 'late', 'middle', 'schooler', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'just', 'double', 'bill', 'year', 'so', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'enjoyed', 'hell', 'years', ""'d"", 'felt', 'little', 'hollow', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'missed', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'find', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'Well', 'bought', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'bowled', 'over', 'years', 'later', 'plotline', 'had', 'missed', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'drags', 'little', 'given', 'away', 'who', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'steam', 'film', 'tries', 'muster', 'remaining', 'reels', 'few', 'comments', 'forum', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'comparison', 'Bogart', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'aptly', 'just', 'steady', 'thinking', 'man', 'character', 'career', 'was', 'full', 'swing', 'heels', 'Oscar', 'win', 'fine', 'form', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'role', 'settle', 'recently', 'departed', 'Tony', 'Musante', 'flakey', 'hitman', 'bit', 'jumpy', 'lines', 'sometimes', 'Scott', 'more', 'preturbed', 'actor', 'delivery', 'character', 'reacting', 'Trish', 'Van', 'Devere', 'Scott', 'soon-to-be', 'real-life', 'wife', 'quaintly', 'unruffled', 'hitman', 'girl', 'young', 'attractive', 'actress', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'coupled', 'few', 'widely', 'scattered', 'plot', 'twists', 'one', 'good', 'explosion', 'too', 'sudden', 'finale', 'wrong', 'guy', 'get', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'modest', 'actioner', 'least', 'Scott', 'gave', 'confident', 'enough', 'go']",The Last Run

Scott was interesting as the retired ""getaway driver"" living in Portugal going out for one last job.  A different take on that kind of Character than Ryan O'Neal in ""The Driver"".  Tony Musante was always a good Bad Guy and since he had just passed away, it was a nice tribute to him if one remembers him as the eternal mobster.  This film isn't a real crash and bang movie, although there are some good action scenes.  Driving especially, takes a front seat here.  Good if you want to see some classic actors in a rarely seen film from some time ago.
