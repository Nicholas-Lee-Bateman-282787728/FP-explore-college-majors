1053330,A58QBXO0HA2B4,B000N47PAQ,Fern,"[4, 7]","You would think the storyline had the makings of a great movie, but something was lost in translation here. For one thing, I don't think the Japanese culture has the same devoted dog-crazy tradition that America does. But more importantly, there was no character development here and this caused the movie to fall flat for me. The best part was the first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie where you see the adorable Quill as a puppy and his first set of loving, childless owners who treat him like a pampered toddler. But after that, Quill is sent to a training school for seeing eye dogs and is later placed with a gruff blind Japanese man.The problem here is that you develop no empathy or compassion for the blind owner or his family. There simply is no character development that offers details, insight or understanding into how this man came to be blind or the challenges he faces. He barks instructions to the dog (no pun intended) and insists on walking in the middle of a busy highway with the dog, creating a massive traffic backup (but no honking horns; those Japanese are so polite) leaving you as the viewer to wonder why.Some of the attempts at humor fell flat, mainly because of the director's lack of film-making skill. There's no lead up to it and it was only later that I realized oh, that was supposed to be funny.So overall, I was disappointed in this movie. Hollywood is so often formulaic, obvious and over the top, with the same old, tired faces (aka ""stars"") but this movie was just the opposite: it failed to engage me. While I loved the dog, the people in its life did not inspire any strong emotion except for a general disliking for the blind owner, which I'm sure was not the intended effect the director was looking for.",3,Disappointed,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,1746,"['would', 'think', 'storyline', 'had', 'makings', 'great', 'movie', 'something', 'was', 'lost', 'translation', 'here', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'same', 'devoted', 'dog-crazy', 'tradition', 'America', 'more', 'importantly', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'caused', 'movie', 'fall', 'flat', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'first', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'where', 'see', 'adorable', 'Quill', 'puppy', 'first', 'set', 'loving', 'childless', 'owners', 'who', 'treat', 'pampered', 'toddler', 'Quill', 'sent', 'training', 'school', 'seeing', 'eye', 'dogs', 'later', 'placed', 'gruff', 'Japanese', 'man.The', 'problem', 'here', 'develop', 'empathy', 'compassion', 'blind', 'owner', 'family', 'simply', 'character', 'development', 'details', 'insight', 'understanding', 'how', 'man', 'came', 'be', 'blind', 'challenges', 'instructions', 'dog', 'pun', 'intended', 'walking', 'middle', 'busy', 'highway', 'dog', 'creating', 'massive', 'traffic', 'backup', 'honking', 'Japanese', 'are', 'so', 'polite', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'why.Some', 'attempts', 'humor', 'fell', 'flat', 'mainly', 'director', 'lack', 'film-making', 'skill', 'lead', 'up', 'was', 'only', 'later', 'realized', 'oh', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny.So', 'overall', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'often', 'formulaic', 'obvious', 'top', 'same', 'old', 'tired', 'stars', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'opposite', 'failed', 'engage', 'loved', 'dog', 'people', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'inspire', 'strong', 'emotion', 'general', 'disliking', 'blind', 'owner', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'effect', 'director', 'was', 'looking']",Quill (Original Japanese with English Subtitles)

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[0, 2]","It's hard to realize the incredible amount of training and hard work required for a seeing-eye dog and its owner to succeed. Quill went through this, along with what had to be several traumatic changes in ownership over his lifetime. I was also surprised to learn that commands for these dogs are given in English - easier for the dog to understand than Japanese. Was also impressed with how Quill would work to dissuade his handler, a rather stubborn person, from proceeding into danger. Unfortunately, at first Quill's blind owner didn't treat the dog well, and Quill ran away. Worse yet, after being returned the owner died from complications of his diabetes and Quill wasted some seven years of his life at the training center - for unknown reasons he was not reassigned to a new person. Eventually Quill was returned to the family that cared for him during his first year - he remembered them, along with his toys, etc. But Quill didn't have long to live himself - a sad ending.",4,Impressive -,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,983,"['hard', 'realize', 'incredible', 'amount', 'training', 'hard', 'work', 'required', 'seeing-eye', 'dog', 'owner', 'succeed', 'Quill', 'went', 'what', 'had', 'be', 'several', 'traumatic', 'changes', 'ownership', 'lifetime', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'learn', 'dogs', 'are', 'given', 'English', 'easier', 'dog', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'Was', 'also', 'impressed', 'how', 'Quill', 'would', 'work', 'dissuade', 'handler', 'rather', 'stubborn', 'person', 'proceeding', 'danger', 'Unfortunately', 'first', 'Quill', 'blind', 'owner', 'did', ""n't"", 'treat', 'dog', 'well', 'Quill', 'ran', 'away', 'Worse', 'yet', 'being', 'returned', 'owner', 'died', 'complications', 'diabetes', 'Quill', 'wasted', 'seven', 'years', 'life', 'training', 'center', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'was', 'not', 'reassigned', 'new', 'person', 'Eventually', 'Quill', 'was', 'returned', 'family', 'cared', 'first', 'year', 'remembered', 'toys', 'etc', 'Quill', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'live', 'sad', 'ending']",Quill (Original Japanese with English Subtitles)

It's a Japanese movie.  It is about a pup who goes into guide dog training but it's really more about the love between the dog and the people he meets and their love of him than about him being a guide dog. There are some sad parts but the movie is very gentle.  I would have given it five stars but for it being confusing toward the end, where even though Quill's blind master dies he is kept at the Guide Dog Training Academy for many years where all he does is help with occasional guide dog demonstrations, and then returned to the loving couple who raised him when he grows old.  I don't understand why if they weren't going to use him for a guide dog anymore they didn't just let him return to them sooner.  That needed to be explained.

Any Japanese DVD shop will have a section devoted to it, and there are sometimes even cat movies as well.  Probably the most familiar to US audiences isThe Adventures of Milo & Otis, which was, shortened, re-edited and narration added for American audiences.Unlike most US dog movies, likeBenjiorLassie, the Japanese dog movie usually presents their animals as non-anthropomorphic, not performing super-feats or amazing tricks, but just showing loyalty and love and companionship, all the things a dog should do.  They rarely save the day or foil criminals.  They always bring a tear to the eye with their simple affection.""Quill"" is a quintessential Japanese dog movie.  A floppy little puppy, cute as they come and entirely poster-ready, is trained to be a seeing-eye dog.  A cantankerous blind person, assured that he doesn't need to be dragged around by a dog, is set to be proven wrong.  Bring out the hankies and open the floodgates!The story was adapted from a popular novel, ""The Life of Quill, the Seeing-Eye Dog"". The film is almost a documentary, showing Quill from his initial training up to his eventual bonding with his human companion to whom he will be both eyes and best friend.  The training is handled in a realistic fashion, without forced drama or silly situations.  While designed to be simple, and to educate children about the life of a seeing-eye dog, under the directorial hand of Yoichi Sai (A shock in and of itself, considering his next film was the brutalBlood and Bones.  Apparently he had enough of sweetness and needed to get dirty), ""Quill"" becomes an enjoyable and moving film.It is absolutely the kind of film that you could watch with little children, and still get something out of it yourself.  Be warned that the film is realistic, and that death is a major theme.
