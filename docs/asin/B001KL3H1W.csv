1208200,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B001KL3H1W,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[54, 78]","I do not penalize the series' score based on my own misunderstanding.  I was under the impression this was a historical documentary, but a good 90% of it is pure archaeology.  To a military historian like me, I simply DO NOT CARE about the angle of holes in skulls indicating how a person was killed in combat.  I just don't.  The documentary gives me far too many instances of this.The reviews complaining about this being too Rome/Latin-centered... what the hell do you want?  The Germanic tribes wrote nothing, drew nothing, sculpted nothing, anything and everything they did was purely contemporary, or else lost, destroyed, or too incoherent to be understood (like runes).Tacitus is cited frequently in the first two parts of the documentary because he's LITERALLY one of the only sources of information we have on the Germanic tribes in this period!But my problem is perhaps one that is indeed my fault; everything covered in this ""saga"" is absolutely 100% unremarkable, and has been covered far better and more thoroughly in other works, books, documentaries.  The entire second part is devoted SOLELY to Arminius and the Battle of Teutoberg Forest.  The vast majority of the first part is barely concerning the Germanic tribes until Caesar's contact with him during the Gallic Wars.As usual with ""pop history"", there is NO MENTION AT ALL of the Teutones, Cimbri, and Marcomannii, the three marauding Germanic tribes that flooded into Gaul in the early 100s BC, then attacked Rome in 107 BC and inflicted the heaviest amount of casualties Rome had ever suffered, more so even than the Battle of Cannae---80,000 at the Battle of Arausio minimum to the 50,000 at the Battle of Cannae minimum.And the amount of time it would have taken to cover these events could have easily been fit into the first part if they'd just NOT covered Caesar's Gallic Wars, which involved GAUL about 90% of the time.The rest essentially takes random artifacts, such as the head of a spear, or a bracelet, and creates a FICTIONAL CHARACTER out of it to journey around ancient Rome and Germania, telling a fully fictional story based on a real world, focused so much on archaeology that I was just plain BORED most of the time.It really bugs me intensely that they essentially make a historical fiction out of their documentary, doing what authors like Steven Saylor does so much better---creating a fictional character based in an entirely real place, on entirely real events, and placing him more or less alongside or at the center of these events.  One of the FICTIONAL CHARACTERS is even depicted as Arminius's closest bodyguard, who saved his life at the Battle of Teutoberg Forest.It doesn't hurt to try to characterize some random people, but it just bugged me, and it felt like the documentary could have done without this half-hearted attempt at a personalized narrative that always managed to fizzle out about 3/4ths of the way through some of the parts.And the vast majority of the archaeological things are presented as these SHOCKING and REVOLUTIONARY discoveries, and maybe it's because I'm not an archaeologist, but these discoveries amount to bits of metal or a necklace or a skull with a coin lodged in its teeth, and it tells us... nothing new.  Something discovered in 2005 is presented as though it's a wholly new discovery, and it's something I knew about from a book written years earlier.  Maybe it's PHYSICAL evidence of it, but it sure ain't presented as such half the time.Part 3 was probably the most vapid, blank, and just plain empty documentary I've ever seen on the subject of ""barbarians"" as it was literally filled with nothing but archaeological finds on Romanized Germanic artifacts, showing us that some Germanic tribes were Romanized around the 200s AD.  And in that sentence, I've summed up the entire 50 minute piece.  There was literally nothing to it except explaining that some Germanic tribes were Romanized, and adopting Roman style and custom and architecture.They went all out with production values but as a historical documentary, it's an empty and pointless replacement to a quick book.",1,"Nothing new, nothing insightful, Germanic tribes still a mystery",1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,4117,"['do', 'not', 'penalize', 'series', 'score', 'based', 'own', 'misunderstanding', 'was', 'impression', 'was', 'historical', 'documentary', 'good', '90', '%', 'pure', 'archaeology', 'military', 'historian', 'simply', 'DO', 'NOT', 'CARE', 'angle', 'holes', 'skulls', 'indicating', 'how', 'person', 'was', 'killed', 'combat', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'instances', 'this.The', 'reviews', 'complaining', 'being', 'too', 'Rome/Latin-centered', 'what', 'hell', 'do', 'want', 'Germanic', 'tribes', 'wrote', 'nothing', 'drew', 'nothing', 'sculpted', 'nothing', 'anything', 'everything', 'did', 'was', 'purely', 'contemporary', 'else', 'lost', 'destroyed', 'too', 'incoherent', 'be', 'understood', 'runes', '.Tacitus', 'cited', 'frequently', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'documentary', 'LITERALLY', 'one', 'only', 'sources', 'information', 'have', 'Germanic', 'tribes', 'period', 'problem', 'perhaps', 'one', 'indeed', 'fault', 'everything', 'covered', 'saga', 'absolutely', '100', '%', 'unremarkable', 'been', 'covered', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'other', 'works', 'books', 'documentaries', 'entire', 'second', 'part', 'devoted', 'SOLELY', 'Arminius', 'Battle', 'Teutoberg', 'Forest', 'vast', 'majority', 'first', 'part', 'barely', 'concerning', 'Germanic', 'tribes', 'Caesar', 'contact', 'Gallic', 'Wars.As', 'usual', 'pop', 'history', 'MENTION', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Teutones', 'Cimbri', 'Marcomannii', 'three', 'marauding', 'Germanic', 'tribes', 'flooded', 'Gaul', 'early', '100s', 'BC', 'then', 'attacked', 'Rome', '107', 'BC', 'inflicted', 'heaviest', 'amount', 'casualties', 'Rome', 'had', 'ever', 'suffered', 'more', 'so', 'even', 'Battle', 'Cannae', '-80,000', 'Battle', 'Arausio', 'minimum', '50,000', 'Battle', 'Cannae', 'minimum.And', 'amount', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'cover', 'events', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'fit', 'first', 'part', ""'d"", 'just', 'NOT', 'covered', 'Caesar', 'Gallic', 'Wars', 'involved', 'GAUL', '90', '%', 'time.The', 'rest', 'essentially', 'random', 'artifacts', 'such', 'head', 'spear', 'bracelet', 'FICTIONAL', 'CHARACTER', 'journey', 'around', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'Germania', 'telling', 'fully', 'fictional', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'world', 'focused', 'so', 'much', 'archaeology', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'BORED', 'most', 'time.It', 'really', 'bugs', 'intensely', 'essentially', 'make', 'historical', 'fiction', 'documentary', 'doing', 'what', 'authors', 'Steven', 'Saylor', 'so', 'much', 'better', '-creating', 'fictional', 'character', 'based', 'entirely', 'real', 'place', 'entirely', 'real', 'events', 'placing', 'more', 'less', 'alongside', 'center', 'events', 'One', 'FICTIONAL', 'CHARACTERS', 'even', 'depicted', 'Arminius', 'closest', 'bodyguard', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'Battle', 'Teutoberg', 'Forest.It', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'try', 'characterize', 'random', 'people', 'just', 'bugged', 'felt', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'personalized', 'narrative', 'always', 'managed', 'fizzle', 'out', '3/4ths', 'way', 'parts.And', 'vast', 'majority', 'archaeological', 'things', 'are', 'presented', 'SHOCKING', 'REVOLUTIONARY', 'discoveries', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'not', 'archaeologist', 'discoveries', 'amount', 'bits', 'metal', 'necklace', 'skull', 'coin', 'lodged', 'teeth', 'nothing', 'new', 'Something', 'discovered', '2005', 'presented', 'wholly', 'new', 'discovery', 'something', 'knew', 'about', 'book', 'written', 'years', 'earlier', 'Maybe', 'PHYSICAL', 'evidence', 'sure', 'ai', ""n't"", 'presented', 'such', 'time.Part', '3', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'vapid', 'blank', 'just', 'plain', 'empty', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'subject', 'barbarians', 'was', 'literally', 'filled', 'nothing', 'archaeological', 'finds', 'Romanized', 'Germanic', 'artifacts', 'showing', 'Germanic', 'tribes', 'were', 'Romanized', '200s', 'AD', 'sentence', ""'ve"", 'summed', 'up', 'entire', '50', 'minute', 'piece', 'was', 'literally', 'nothing', 'explaining', 'Germanic', 'tribes', 'were', 'Romanized', 'adopting', 'Roman', 'style', 'custom', 'architecture.They', 'went', 'out', 'production', 'values', 'historical', 'documentary', 'empty', 'pointless', 'replacement', 'quick', 'book']",Germanic Tribes: The Complete Four-Part Saga

This material means a lot to the German cast and crew, and that lack of objectivity may work against the finished product.

There is just something unseemly about a man who betrays men who trusted him and considered him a comrade and an friend. The Romans are not saints either,and perhaps the best way to look at the events,is to the judge the characters by the standards of that day.Attempting to characterize historical figures by modern codes of conduct,places an undue burden on the viewer.The long list of acknowledgements in the end credits,proves that this was a prestige production.Worth seeing for the points of view expressed.",3,"A workman effort,that just misses excellence.",1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,950,"['big', 'budget', 'production', 'just', 'excellence', 'material', 'lot', 'German', 'cast', 'crew', 'lack', 'objectivity', 'may', 'work', 'finished', 'product', 'German', 'Nationalist', 'point', 'view', 'probably', 'as', 'valid', 'other', 'good', 'sometimes', 'see', 'material', 'different', 'nations', 'point', 'view.But', 'film', 'view', 'Germanic', 'Prince', 'Arminius', 'almost', 'whitewash', 'very', 'complicated', 'human', 'being', 'just', 'something', 'unseemly', 'man', 'who', 'men', 'who', 'trusted', 'considered', 'comrade', 'friend', 'Romans', 'are', 'not', 'saints', 'perhaps', 'best', 'way', 'look', 'events', 'judge', 'characters', 'standards', 'day.Attempting', 'characterize', 'historical', 'figures', 'modern', 'codes', 'conduct', 'undue', 'burden', 'viewer.The', 'long', 'list', 'acknowledgements', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'prestige', 'production.Worth', 'seeing', 'points', 'view', 'expressed']",Germanic Tribes: The Complete Four-Part Saga

1208203,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B001KL3H1W,Jeffery Mingo,"[33, 58]","In watching this work, I could tell that all the experts interviewed were German, but it was only when the credits rolled that I learned that this was a German production.  Even though this was a German production about the German past for a German audience, it was not full of ""Ra! Ra! Ra!  We're so great!""  The computer graphics, reenactments, and fictional storylines were impressive and not annoying.  It was a challenge to sit through a documentary series more than three hours long, but many will find the viewing worthwhile and informative.Here's my concern.  Many accounts of dinosaurs act as if they were not important until that meteor hit the earth.  Many works on Native Americans only begin with their contact with Europeans; they problematically assume Native Americans had no story to tell before then.  I read a great book by Robert Aldrich called ""Colonialism and Homosexuality.""  The point of the book was to say that many Western men of the past did not recognize their sexual preferences until they were in the non-Western world.  Though the book is great, it was irritating to hear everything from the white men's perspective and never hear from the men of color with whom they got busy.  Then again, it was the Westerners who were consistently literate, so I didn't find the book purposely biased.  This documentary follows that same path:  this is Germanic history as told through Roman eyes.I guess the Romans were literate at much higher rates than the German tribes, so the work is not purposely skewed.  However, the work is more about contact between the two groups, rather than showing Germans as they saw themselves.  There's a big section on Germans in Roman coliseums.  The work says Romans thought Germans made for good bodyguards.  It was interesting to see how cultures connect and influence each other, but the work almost assumes there would have been no ancient Germans if it weren't for blessed Romans and that's just not true.  At one point, a Germanic figure prays to a god called Woten and I'm almost sure that might be a Germanization of the Norse god Odin.  So why not speak about the German tribes' relationships with Scandinavian ones, rather than just Rome?  I've seen works about ancient Brits that bring up Hadrian's Wall and the Romans, but they never act like the Brits were nothing without Roman contact.  So why make this false statement about Germans?If this were a French, Spanish, or Portuguese work, I could see how those nations see themselves as the descendants of Ancient Rome, but for a German documentary to imply that seems quite odd.  This work seemed very top-down.  Perhaps Dr. Spivak's contention that ""the subaltern has no voice"" is played out in this European and ancient context.",3,"Good, but too Roman-centric!",1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,2750,"['watching', 'work', 'could', 'tell', 'experts', 'interviewed', 'were', 'German', 'was', 'only', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'learned', 'was', 'German', 'production', 'Even', 'was', 'German', 'production', 'German', 'past', 'German', 'audience', 'was', 'not', 'full', 'Ra', 'Ra', 'Ra', ""'re"", 'so', 'great', 'computer', 'graphics', 'reenactments', 'fictional', 'storylines', 'were', 'impressive', 'not', 'annoying', 'was', 'challenge', 'sit', 'documentary', 'series', 'more', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'viewing', 'worthwhile', 'informative.Here', 'concern', 'Many', 'accounts', 'dinosaurs', 'act', 'were', 'not', 'important', 'meteor', 'hit', 'earth', 'Many', 'works', 'Native', 'Americans', 'only', 'begin', 'contact', 'Europeans', 'problematically', 'assume', 'Native', 'Americans', 'had', 'story', 'tell', 'then', 'read', 'great', 'book', 'Robert', 'Aldrich', 'called', 'Colonialism', 'Homosexuality', 'point', 'book', 'was', 'say', 'many', 'Western', 'men', 'past', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'sexual', 'preferences', 'were', 'non-Western', 'world', 'book', 'great', 'was', 'irritating', 'hear', 'everything', 'white', 'men', 'perspective', 'never', 'hear', 'men', 'color', 'whom', 'got', 'busy', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'Westerners', 'who', 'were', 'consistently', 'literate', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'book', 'purposely', 'biased', 'documentary', 'same', 'path', 'Germanic', 'history', 'told', 'Roman', 'guess', 'Romans', 'were', 'literate', 'much', 'higher', 'rates', 'German', 'tribes', 'work', 'not', 'purposely', 'skewed', 'However', 'work', 'more', 'contact', 'two', 'groups', 'rather', 'showing', 'Germans', 'saw', 'big', 'section', 'Germans', 'Roman', 'coliseums', 'work', 'Romans', 'thought', 'Germans', 'made', 'good', 'bodyguards', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'cultures', 'connect', 'influence', 'other', 'work', 'almost', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ancient', 'Germans', 'were', ""n't"", 'blessed', 'Romans', 'just', 'not', 'true', 'one', 'point', 'Germanic', 'figure', 'god', 'called', 'Woten', ""'m"", 'almost', 'sure', 'might', 'be', 'Germanization', 'Norse', 'god', 'Odin', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'speak', 'German', 'tribes', 'relationships', 'Scandinavian', 'ones', 'rather', 'just', 'Rome', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'works', 'ancient', 'Brits', 'bring', 'up', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'Romans', 'never', 'act', 'Brits', 'were', 'nothing', 'Roman', 'contact', 'why', 'make', 'false', 'statement', 'Germans', 'were', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'work', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'nations', 'see', 'descendants', 'Ancient', 'Rome', 'German', 'documentary', 'imply', 'quite', 'odd', 'work', 'seemed', 'very', 'top-down', 'Perhaps', 'Dr.', 'Spivak', 'contention', 'subaltern', 'voice', 'played', 'out', 'European', 'ancient', 'context']",Germanic Tribes: The Complete Four-Part Saga
