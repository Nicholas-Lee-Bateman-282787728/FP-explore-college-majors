1495620,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005NHZALE,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","I saw the original 1947 film a few years back.  I was not impressed.  It was slow in parts, disjointed and carried on the shoulders of a poorly asserted performance.There is really no difference between that film and this current adaptation.I had the same issue with this premise as with the original.  From my review of the '47 film: ""I found it a struggle to get on board with the films actual prose, which I found to be ineffectively constructed.  The idea of a hoodlum marrying a girl he loathes just to drive her to suicide so she can't squeal on him for bumping off a rival is far fetched and really needs serious innovation used to give it even the remotest air of honesty.  I mean, if he was so willing to kill a man why wouldn't he kill the girl?  It just doesn't make sense, and I don't get the impression from `Brighton Rock' that it wanted us to suspend disbelief.""  I feel the same about this version.  There is nothing here to make this seem plausible.  It just feels rather pointless.There is the same batch of positives here.  The cinematography is lush.  The supporting cast is mostly good.  Andrea Riseborough is stunning and captures the naivety of Rose beautifully.  The final scene, with the record, is nowhere near as effective as in the original, so she loses that big moment that Carol Marsh chewed up marvelously.  Helen Mirren, who knows how to chew, is uncomfortably reserved here (I wanted her to push this but she seemed almost bored) and Sam Riley is horrible, but I really hate the character of Pinky.  He makes no sense and I don't think it's possible to `act' this character without looking stupid.At least it's a pretty film.",2,Dull as a rock...,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,1659,"['saw', 'original', '1947', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'was', 'slow', 'parts', 'disjointed', 'carried', 'shoulders', 'poorly', 'asserted', 'performance.There', 'really', 'difference', 'film', 'current', 'adaptation.I', 'had', 'same', 'issue', 'premise', 'original', 'review', ""'47"", 'film', 'found', 'struggle', 'get', 'board', 'films', 'actual', 'prose', 'found', 'be', 'ineffectively', 'constructed', 'idea', 'hoodlum', 'marrying', 'girl', 'just', 'drive', 'suicide', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'squeal', 'bumping', 'off', 'rival', 'far', 'fetched', 'really', 'serious', 'innovation', 'used', 'give', 'even', 'remotest', 'air', 'honesty', 'mean', 'was', 'so', 'willing', 'kill', 'man', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'kill', 'girl', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'wanted', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'feel', 'same', 'version', 'nothing', 'here', 'make', 'seem', 'plausible', 'just', 'rather', 'same', 'batch', 'positives', 'here', 'cinematography', 'lush', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mostly', 'good', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'stunning', 'naivety', 'Rose', 'beautifully', 'final', 'scene', 'record', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'effective', 'original', 'big', 'moment', 'Carol', 'Marsh', 'chewed', 'up', 'marvelously', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'how', 'chew', 'uncomfortably', 'reserved', 'here', 'wanted', 'push', 'seemed', 'almost', 'bored', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'horrible', 'really', 'hate', 'character', 'Pinky', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'act', 'character', 'looking', 'stupid.At', 'least', 'pretty', 'film']",N/A

1495626,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005NHZALE,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","BRIGHTON ROCK  is a British remake of the 1947 brilliant film noir based on the novel by Graham Greene an adapted for the screen by Graham Greene and Terrance Rattigan. This BRIGHTON ROCK has been updated from the original 1930s setting to the 1960s and the screenplay is by Rowan Joffe (who also directs) - tough competition with the original writers!  The result is a dark film that relies on performances by some actors who are not up to the task and makes them seem even more weak by the presence of such brilliant actors in smaller roles as Helen Mirren,  John Hurt, Philip Davis and Andrea Riseborough.The story takes place in 1964 in Brighton, once a quiet seaside town, is suddenly overrun by gangs of sharp suited Mods and greasy Rockers looking for a riot. Looking to be the top Mod gangster, Pinkie Brown (Sam Riley) will stop at nothing to be the biggest name in the crime world - bigger than the competitor Colleoni (Andy Serkis). Pinkie witnesses the vicious death of fellow Mod Kite (Goeff Bell) and is determined to kill the perpetrator Hale (Sean Harris).  Pinkie's ruthless and violent ambition takes over his mission and when he discovers that a waitress named Rose (Andrea Riseborough) who works at Snows, a cafe run by Ida (Helen Mirren), is involved tangentially in the murders,  Pinkie decides to court the plain jane Rose, knowing that if he marries her she cannot testify against him should she discover Pinkie's guilt in the murders.  Ida had a 'connection' with Hale and sees through the veils of deceit Pinkie is placing on the innocent Rose, and she and her longtime friend Phil (John Hurt) undermine Pinkie's plans.  Pinkie marries Rose - a gesture that secures Rose's fascination and new love for Pinkie -  to keep her from testifying against him.  As factors around the conflicts between the two gangs tighten and Pinkie fears for his end, he convinces his new bride to take part in a mutual suicide, an act that has a surprising end.What is missing in this updated adaptation is Graham Greene's important emphasis on the theme of sin, guilt and Catholicism: there are attempts to bring these concepts into the script but they become of lesser importance than the action and dark evocation of a period piece.  There mood is well described by the cinematography of John Mathieson, but the single most effective aspect of this film is the brilliant music score by the gifted British composer Martin Phipps, godson of Benjamin Britten.  Were there not an original film for comparison the film would likely be better accepted. But for those who are ardent fans of the novels of Graham Greene this film adaptation will likely disappoint.  It is currently available On Demand and simultaneously in theaters before the DVD is released here.

1495627,A106016KSI0YQ,B005NHZALE,Jay Dickson,"[3, 4]","So many ideas went into Rowan Joff&eacute;'s adaptation of Graham Greene's 1938 novel about sin and damnation, and so many of them were bad ones. The major one is that he sets the story in 1964 rather than the original date, which might not be so terrible given that the famous John Boulting film version of this novel was set in its own present-day of 1948; however, Joff&eacute; had the absolutely horrible idea of inevitably accompanying this change by bringing in the riots of the Mods and the Rockers, and when the hordes of Mods in their Vespas start chanting ""We are Mods, we are mods"" during the killing of Spicer, it's impossible not to think of QUADROPHENIA--a jarring comparsion that is heightened even further by having several important scenes in this version take place (for no good reason) on the nearby cliffs of Dover. Joff&eacute; has been accused by some critics of having drained all of Greene's vision of Catholic guilt from his adaptation, but actually it's been cheapened rather than drained out. Instead of allowing much talk of Greene's Catholic themes, Joff&eacute; pours over the action a solemn and piping boy's chorale, that instantly makes everything seem depressing and portentous. You'd never know that Graham Greene originally classified the book (with its love of popular culture, beautifully evoked by the Boulting version) as an ""entertainment"": you feel instead you're at a dolorous requiem, and it goes on forever. There are some nice visual touches from time to time, but the film is pretty much a failure. As Pinkie, Sam Riley seems too much like Dickie Attenborough from the previous adaptation (and suffers in comparison with him), and the excellent Helen Mirren is too forceful and in charge to bring the element of surprise to the key role of Ida that Hermione Baddeley brought it.",2,Talking 'bout his degeneration,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,1825,"['So', 'many', 'ideas', 'went', 'Rowan', 'Joff', 'eacute', 'adaptation', 'Graham', 'Greene', '1938', 'novel', 'sin', 'damnation', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'bad', 'ones', 'major', 'one', 'story', '1964', 'rather', 'original', 'date', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'terrible', 'given', 'famous', 'John', 'Boulting', 'film', 'version', 'novel', 'was', 'set', 'own', 'present-day', '1948', 'however', 'Joff', 'eacute', 'had', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'idea', 'inevitably', 'accompanying', 'change', 'bringing', 'riots', 'Mods', 'Rockers', 'when', 'hordes', 'Mods', 'Vespas', 'start', 'chanting', 'are', 'Mods', 'are', 'mods', 'killing', 'Spicer', 'impossible', 'not', 'think', 'QUADROPHENIA', 'jarring', 'comparsion', 'heightened', 'even', 'further', 'having', 'several', 'important', 'scenes', 'version', 'take', 'place', 'good', 'reason', 'nearby', 'cliffs', 'Dover', 'Joff', 'eacute', 'been', 'accused', 'critics', 'having', 'drained', 'Greene', 'vision', 'Catholic', 'guilt', 'adaptation', 'actually', 'been', 'cheapened', 'rather', 'drained', 'out', 'Instead', 'allowing', 'much', 'talk', 'Greene', 'Catholic', 'themes', 'Joff', 'eacute', 'action', 'solemn', 'piping', 'boy', 'chorale', 'instantly', 'everything', 'seem', 'depressing', 'portentous', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'originally', 'classified', 'book', 'love', 'popular', 'culture', 'beautifully', 'evoked', 'Boulting', 'version', 'entertainment', 'feel', 'instead', ""'re"", 'dolorous', 'requiem', 'forever', 'are', 'nice', 'visual', 'touches', 'time', 'time', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'failure', 'Pinkie', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'too', 'much', 'Dickie', 'Attenborough', 'previous', 'adaptation', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'excellent', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'too', 'forceful', 'charge', 'bring', 'element', 'surprise', 'key', 'role', 'Ida', 'Hermione', 'Baddeley', 'brought']",N/A

1495630,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B005NHZALE,Luke Killion,"[1, 2]","""Brighton Rock"" is a 2010 IFC film about the British underworld. This cinematic version directed by Rowan Joffe is based on the 1938 novel by Graham Greene. Greene seemed a bit ahead of his time with his portrayal of secretive aspects of society. The 2002 picture ""The Quiet American"" was another adaptation of a Greene novel, set in Indochina during the French/Viet war. ""Quiet American"" was a direct expose on CIA covert operations in Vietnam during the end of French colonial rule.  Both stories have very intricate and comprehensive knowledge of shadow organizations and how they operate. It seems fairly amazing that Greene was able to cut to the heart of the sickness before it was brought to public attention beginning with the Kefauver Hearings on the mob in the US, as well as the Pentagon Papers which unearthed the scandalous nature of covert operations during the Vietnam war.In Joffe's 2010 version of ""Brighton Rock,"" the major originality was the decision to change the story's era from the 1930's to 60's. This updated addition gave the film an extra intensity, as the Mods vs. Rockers riots that flared up in England provided a more familiar and modern vibe. For any fan of the rock n' roll film ""Quadrophenia"", this picture is set in exactly the same milieu, only from the vantage point of a small time mob fighting for survival rather than the Mods themselves.The film's lead character is Pinkie Brown, played with great charisma by Sam Riley. I'm not all that familiar with stories about British mobsters; Guy Ritchie's movies are the only ones that come to mind. Riley's preformance really gave me a good sense of what could be described as a very British gangster. He certainly has the dapper appearance and slick persona attributed to most mobsters, but the way he carries himself seems particularly suited to his environs.In his character exists a two fold dilemma; there is the cocky up and coming teenage gangster ready to take on the world, but he also embodies alot of the ""live fast and die young"" style that proved problematic for the turbulent generation coming of age in the 1960's. There are several parallels to The Who's film ""Quadrophenia"", mainly  in the breathtaking cinematography around the cliffs of Dover.I thought this production did a great job in mixing several genres of cinema. The Mods vs. Rockers and British underworld are part of this film's magic, but it is advertised as a love story, and a very good one at that. Pinkie's love interest in the character of Rose (played by Andrea Riseborough) is timeless and in a sense tragic. The basic tension of the story, which is brought into play at the very beginning of the movie, is whether Pinkie can trust Rose with valuable information that could lead to his undoing, all the while he struggles to keep his head above water when the leader of his little crew (Kite) is hit. The ensuing gang war with the expanding Colleoni mob has all the hallmarks of a classic underworld drama, much in vein of the original ""Godfather"" film, only on a much smaller and specifically English setting.",4,Reworking of Graham Greene's British mob novel,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,3082,"['Brighton', 'Rock', '2010', 'IFC', 'film', 'British', 'underworld', 'cinematic', 'version', 'directed', 'Rowan', 'Joffe', 'based', '1938', 'novel', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Greene', 'seemed', 'bit', 'ahead', 'time', 'portrayal', 'secretive', 'aspects', 'society', '2002', 'picture', 'Quiet', 'American', 'was', 'adaptation', 'Greene', 'novel', 'set', 'Indochina', 'French/Viet', 'war', 'Quiet', 'American', 'was', 'direct', 'expose', 'CIA', 'covert', 'operations', 'Vietnam', 'end', 'French', 'colonial', 'rule', 'stories', 'have', 'very', 'intricate', 'comprehensive', 'knowledge', 'shadow', 'organizations', 'how', 'operate', 'fairly', 'amazing', 'Greene', 'was', 'able', 'cut', 'heart', 'sickness', 'was', 'brought', 'public', 'attention', 'beginning', 'Kefauver', 'Hearings', 'mob', 'US', 'as', 'well', 'Pentagon', 'Papers', 'unearthed', 'scandalous', 'nature', 'covert', 'operations', 'Vietnam', 'Joffe', '2010', 'version', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'major', 'originality', 'was', 'decision', 'change', 'story', 'era', '1930', '60', 'updated', 'addition', 'gave', 'film', 'extra', 'intensity', 'Mods', 'vs.', 'Rockers', 'flared', 'up', 'England', 'provided', 'more', 'familiar', 'modern', 'vibe', 'fan', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'film', 'Quadrophenia', 'picture', 'set', 'exactly', 'same', 'milieu', 'only', 'vantage', 'point', 'small', 'time', 'mob', 'fighting', 'survival', 'rather', 'Mods', 'themselves.The', 'film', 'lead', 'character', 'Pinkie', 'Brown', 'played', 'great', 'charisma', 'Sam', 'Riley', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'stories', 'British', 'mobsters', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'movies', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'come', 'mind', 'Riley', 'preformance', 'really', 'gave', 'good', 'sense', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'very', 'British', 'gangster', 'certainly', 'dapper', 'appearance', 'slick', 'persona', 'attributed', 'most', 'mobsters', 'way', 'particularly', 'suited', 'environs.In', 'character', 'two', 'fold', 'dilemma', 'cocky', 'up', 'coming', 'teenage', 'gangster', 'ready', 'take', 'world', 'also', 'alot', 'live', 'fast', 'die', 'young', 'style', 'proved', 'problematic', 'turbulent', 'generation', 'coming', 'age', '1960', 'are', 'several', 'parallels', 'Who', 'film', 'Quadrophenia', 'mainly', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'cliffs', 'Dover.I', 'thought', 'production', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'mixing', 'several', 'genres', 'cinema', 'Mods', 'vs.', 'Rockers', 'British', 'underworld', 'are', 'part', 'film', 'magic', 'advertised', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'Pinkie', 'love', 'interest', 'character', 'Rose', 'played', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'timeless', 'sense', 'tragic', 'basic', 'tension', 'story', 'brought', 'play', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Pinkie', 'can', 'trust', 'Rose', 'valuable', 'information', 'could', 'lead', 'undoing', 'while', 'keep', 'head', 'water', 'when', 'leader', 'little', 'crew', 'Kite', 'hit', 'ensuing', 'gang', 'war', 'expanding', 'Colleoni', 'mob', 'hallmarks', 'classic', 'underworld', 'drama', 'much', 'vein', 'original', 'Godfather', 'film', 'only', 'much', 'smaller', 'specifically', 'English', 'setting']",N/A
1495631,A374CXEFOOX5DU,B005NHZALE,M.C. Hewins,"[3, 3]","I was really surprised by how much I liked this production of Brighton Rock. As any Graham Greene fan knows, good adaptations of his novels are hard to come by. In film adaptations, the real marrow of what Greene fleshes out in the novel is missed. In his earlier novels, that usually is Greene's inextricable belief in God and his obsession with the power of belief, especially in regard to Catholicism. This production misses that in a general sense. Lip service is payed to the Catholic connection, yet the film manages to convey those themes of damnation and salvation all the same. Sam Riley's truly young and innocent looking baby face coupled with his bone chilling performance as the ruthless gangster Pinkie entirely steals the show from this production's formidable cast. Andrea Riseborough plays a splendid Rose. John Hurt and Helen Mirren support the film with flawless performances from both veteran artists.There are plot departures from the book. And not all are minor departures and these may upset you if your a purist. However, I feel the essence of what Greene intended with his novel was seen and brilliantly portrayed in this film.

I was clumsy and stupid, very mixed up about what it could mean to be a man, mean and careless. I knew about guilt because I'd been brought up as a Catholic, though I'd long since stopped going to confession. I felt that I understood Pinkie, his anger and frustration, and his conceit.When they made this movie they set it at the time when I read the book, among mods and rockers, at the beginnings of the sixties.Since reading Brighton Rock back then, I've read other books by Grahame Greene and have been amazed by his ability to burrow into a particular time and place and construct a rich narrative about characters and morality.So, I've been looking forward to watching this movie for a year or two.  The movie does reference Catholicism, does have a few things to say about what is right and wrong, and does touch on what it can mean to be an amoral young man. And there are Mods and Rockers.But it doesn't add up. Instead of looking to Grahame Greene who was able to knit all this together,the movie makers have borrowed everything they could lay their hands on from the genre of the modern British gangster movie.  If you like you can watch John Hurt and Helen Mirren, but all you will see is them doing a decent job, nothing more.The only reason to see this movie is to watch the actress who plays Rose. Andrea Riseborough has an impossible part, a sweet girl who falls in love with a psychopath.

1495636,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B005NHZALE,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 3]","""Brighton Rock,"" (2010) is, apparently a British television treatment, the second adaptation to be made, of outstanding British author Graham Greene's classic, early career, downbeat novel of the same name,Brighton Rock.  This 111 minute full-color romantic crime drama/thriller, for which I see a BBC Television production credit, was the film debut of Rowan Joffe (28 Weeks Later / 28 Days Later (2-Movie Box Set)), who both adapted for the screen and directed.  It draws upon film noir and gangster elements from its predecessor, and did receive a theatrical release.The production has been moved from the Depression 1930s, in which it was written and set, to the fraught 1960s, during which, in Britain, sharp-suited Mods and greasy Rockers were frequently at each others' throats.  It is, of course, still set in Brighton, once a quiet seaside resort town, with some historic artifacts and buildings from the days when it was a favorite royal resort.  Mod gangster Pinky Brown, survivor of a rough childhood, has witnessed the vicious death of fellow Mod gangster/surrogate father Kite at the hands of Hale, member of an opposing gang.  So Pinky makes it his business to execute Hale.  But the none-too-bright Rose, who waitresses at the local tea room, Snow's, has been immortalized in a shot by a boardwalk photographer of Hale and her that shows Pinky following Hale, just behind his prey.  Older and wiser heads in his gang advise him to romance and seduce the waitress, in hopes of preventing her telling the police what she saw.  So Pinky begins on this program, which he finds rather distasteful.  But, unfortunately, he has been destabilized by recent events; he will become more desperate and violent, and will begin to act out in ultimately self-destructive ways.The film is a little off-balance, as the young lovers are played by rather inexperienced actors, Sam Riley (Control), as Pinky, and Andrea Riseborough, (W.E.), as Rose.  Several older, stronger, more experienced actors are in smaller parts.  Oscar and Emmy winner Helen Mirren, (The Queen,Prime Suspect: The Complete Collection), plays Ida, Rose's boss at the tea shop.  John Hurt, (Alien), plays Phil Corkery, local publican.  Andy Serkis, (The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy), plays Colleoni, rival mob boss.  And solid supporting actor Phil Davis, (White Chapel: The Ripper Returns), plays Spicer, older member of Pinky's gang.And this 2010 adaptation is often compared, to its detriment, to the brilliant 1947 black and white adaption that starred a young Richard Attenborough.  That one was adapted for the screen by Greene himself, and noted playwright Terrance Rattigan, and is considered a film noir classic.  But the earlier film is hard to find.  Nevertheless, the more recent version is still a dark film that gives the viewer a good sense of Brighton at the time.  Its mood is well transmitted by cinematographer John Mathieson, and it receives enhancement by the atmospheric score by the gifted British composer Martin Phipps, godson of esteemed British composer Benjamin Britten.  The newer version is distinctly light on Greene's recurring themes of sin, guilt, and Catholicism, as compared to its print inspiration; it has also been given a happier Hollywood ending.  Still, it's likely this remake would have been better received if the 1947 version weren't available for comparison.
