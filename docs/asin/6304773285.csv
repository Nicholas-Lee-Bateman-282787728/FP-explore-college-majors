That's when I got that Good Burger was made more for people my age than theirs.  As they've gotten older, they've come to appreciate it more.I know it was an expansion of an All That skit, but it had one big difference.  On All That, the Good Burger skit was mostly about Ed, played by Kel Mitchell, and his goofy talk and attitude.  This movie also had Kenan Thompson, as Dexter.  That made all the difference, because Dexter actually had a story.  Ed is funny, innocent, and what not, but he didn't bring the story by himself.So, I'm watching this movie, wondering how Dexter's going to get out of his problem, when everyone somehow ends up in a mental institution.  And who's in the middle of the scene, but George Clinton, turning the dial on the radio to Knee Deep--one of my favorite songs of all time!  And when Kel leads the room in a rendition of the Thriller dance, I knew I'd found one of my new favorite movies.Kenan and Kel, George Clinton, Sinbad as a tacky, over-the-top 70s jive talking teacher--this movie was hilarious!

Nickelodeon's Films That Are Based on Thier Shows/Skits, Thay Don't Live Up To What Thier Show/Skit Was, or Sometimes It's Just Not Good at All, But ''Good Burger'' Lives Up To Fans of The Skit.

When Dexter tastes Ed's sauce for burgers, they open to the public, and they get the customers back. Soon, the manager at Mondo Burger named Kurt tries to steal Ed's recipe. Soon, they poison the sauce and send Ed and Dexter, and Otis to Demented Hills. They have until 10:00 in the morning to stop everyone from eating a Good Burger.
