281177,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,6301969588,AKN,"[2, 2]","I saw this once many years ago and was horrified at the ""freaks"", never having seen such deformities before. The end, where the freaks are chasing after the beautiful trapeze artist, who is at the end seen as a duck mutilated hideously and quacking in a cage at the circus after being attacked, was a true horror. In fact it was the most terrifyingthing I have ever seen in a movie to this day.This second time, I was deeply moved, tears in my eyes at the cruelty of nature, and the plot, so timeless.  Those who are less fortunate are often preyed upon by others.In this case, the tiny midget is in love with the normal sized beauty, who pretends to love him and marries him for his fortune while mocking him behind his back.As if nature was not cruel enough, human beings deliver the cruelest blows of all.This is a smorgasborg of deformity.  While it was titilating and still is, and indulges our base desire to stare and look down on (yes, we do, even if we will not admit it to ourselves) those who are less fortunate, there is something else here that is much deeper.While some of us have deformities that are physical and hideous, others of us have spiritual and moral deformities that are less obvious.  Sometimes hiding behind a beautiful face and body is a monster, ready to prey on others, ridicule, insult, debase and even kill.In this case, the beautiful face that was hiding a monster within was gratifyingly made into a physical monster.  There was a sense of finally seeing justice in the world.I felt terrible pity for some of the freaks in this movie.  These are some of the worst deformities I have ever seen.  Yet they were presented with dignity and shown to be humanand decent people.

281183,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,6301969588,Amy Lynn,"[1, 1]","A 1932 film directed by Tod Browning, who had major success with the film Dracula. He wanted to top Frankenstein. You can judge if he succeeded or not. This film was considered controversial and was banned in Britain for many years. It might today even be considered shocking to some because of the use of real sideshow performers as actors. Tod took a major risk when he made this film and I thank him for that, for its rare to find such a gem like this in the history of cinema.This is a tale of false love and revenge. A story about a beautiful woman who tries to con a midget and poison him for his money...but ends up very sorry for her actions. Her and her partner seem to think its funny to make fun of all the ''freaks'', until she goes too far one night at dinner then the Freaks later discover her ulterior motives against ''one of their own kind'' and she ends up paying the ultimate price.We get to know all of the Freaks quite well. We are introduced to Violet & Daisy Hilton, a pair of siamese twins, 2 brother and sister who are midgets, human skeletons, armless girl, a man with no arms or legs yet he can roll a cigarette with his mouth and many more interesting characters. The scene you will most likely never forget is when the freaks turn against the woman at the end and the storm chase scene.This is not an exploitation film. Browning treats them with great compassion. It presents them in human terms. He knew how to do that, he at one point, during his teenage years ran away to join the circus and got to know many of the people. Now they will be remembered forever in the history of cinema.The special features on the DVD are fascinating.The Film contains commentary by David J.

281184,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301969588,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","`Freaks' is one of those movies that just has to be seen, by everyone.  It is classified as a horror film but to me it is much more than that.  Much like the beautifully written (and adapted) `Of Mice and Men', `Freaks' broaches the horrors of mistreating and misjudging others based on their physical limitations.  There is no reason to simply cast this film aside as nothing more than a `scary movie' for `Freaks' is far too important a film to be typecast in such a way.Like the prologue explains, there was a time when ones with such drastic physical and mental deficiencies were cast aside as unworthy and left to die.  Those that survived were more often than not taking in as sideshow freaks and paraded about for the amusement of the `normal' people (much like `The Elephant Man').  Thus begins `Freaks'; a story about a group of these sideshow freaks who have simply had enough of being walked all over.  When Hans falls in love with the beautiful Cleopatra, a normal trapeze acrobat, the rest of Hans' friends and fellow freaks (including his one-time fianc&eacute;e Frieda) smell something wrong.  It so turns out that Cleopatra is using Hans for his good nature and money and that she plans to marry him and poison him in order to take his money and run off the Hercules.  When the freaks get word of this they take matters into their own hands to save Hans from his new wife's evil plan.It's obvious that we as the viewer are supposed to sympathize with the `freaks', for they are painted as the more normal of the lot exposed here.  Questions about our idea of real beauty and worth arise as we are able to examine our own vanity.  Even Hans is subject to his depiction of love and admiration for he leaves his wonderfully supportive and obviously infatuated fianc&eacute;e Frieda for the beautiful Cleopatra who herself exhibits no real likable or desirable qualities other than her surface beauty.Us `normal' humans (if that's your standard of normal) are given varying degrees of tolerance to examine within the close nit community.  You have Cleopatra and Hercules who are disgusted by and fancy using those different from them.  You have Venus who does not dislike or desire to abuse the freaks but is obviously not as comfortable around them as some (just watch her facial expressions in certain scenes); and then you have Phroso (as well as Madame Tetrallini) who defend the `freaks' and consider them equals.The question is; who are you?I actually found the acting within `Freaks' to be quite good, especially on the part of Wallace Ford and the Earles' siblings (Harry and Daisy Earles play Hans and Frieda).  I really enjoyed Daisy's performance, for it added so much genuine warmth and concern for her lover Hans.  She just wants him to be happy and you really believe that.As far as the `horror' aspect of this film is concerned, it really isn't all that horrifying in the sense that it isn't truly scary.  The fact does remain that these human beings are scary looking (I know that sounds mean but it is a fact) and that alone may send some shivers down your spine; especially when they start chanting ""one of us"" or when they are crawling towards you with knives in hand; but truthfully `Freaks' is horrifying in that it exposes a common thread of thought that is found in many people today, a line of thinking that is not only hurtful but, as we've seen here, very dangerous.",5,So much more than a mere horror film...,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,3404,"['Freaks', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'classified', 'horror', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'Much', 'beautifully', 'written', 'adapted', 'Mice', 'Men', 'Freaks', 'horrors', 'mistreating', 'misjudging', 'others', 'based', 'physical', 'limitations', 'reason', 'simply', 'cast', 'film', 'aside', 'nothing', 'more', 'scary', 'movie', 'Freaks', 'far', 'too', 'important', 'film', 'be', 'typecast', 'such', 'way.Like', 'prologue', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'ones', 'such', 'drastic', 'physical', 'mental', 'deficiencies', 'were', 'cast', 'aside', 'unworthy', 'left', 'die', 'survived', 'were', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'taking', 'sideshow', 'freaks', 'paraded', 'amusement', 'normal', 'people', 'much', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'Thus', 'Freaks', 'story', 'group', 'sideshow', 'freaks', 'who', 'have', 'simply', 'had', 'enough', 'being', 'walked', 'over', 'When', 'Hans', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Cleopatra', 'normal', 'trapeze', 'acrobat', 'rest', 'Hans', 'friends', 'fellow', 'freaks', 'including', 'one-time', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Frieda', 'smell', 'something', 'wrong', 'so', 'out', 'Cleopatra', 'using', 'Hans', 'good', 'nature', 'money', 'marry', 'poison', 'order', 'take', 'money', 'run', 'off', 'Hercules', 'When', 'freaks', 'get', 'word', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'save', 'Hans', 'new', 'wife', 'evil', 'plan.It', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'are', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'freaks', 'are', 'painted', 'more', 'normal', 'lot', 'exposed', 'here', 'Questions', 'idea', 'real', 'beauty', 'worth', 'arise', 'are', 'able', 'examine', 'own', 'vanity', 'Even', 'Hans', 'subject', 'depiction', 'love', 'admiration', 'wonderfully', 'supportive', 'obviously', 'infatuated', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Frieda', 'beautiful', 'Cleopatra', 'who', 'real', 'likable', 'desirable', 'qualities', 'other', 'surface', 'beauty.Us', 'normal', 'humans', 'standard', 'normal', 'are', 'given', 'varying', 'degrees', 'tolerance', 'examine', 'close', 'nit', 'community', 'have', 'Cleopatra', 'Hercules', 'who', 'are', 'disgusted', 'fancy', 'using', 'different', 'have', 'Venus', 'who', 'not', 'dislike', 'desire', 'abuse', 'freaks', 'obviously', 'not', 'comfortable', 'around', 'just', 'watch', 'facial', 'expressions', 'certain', 'scenes', 'then', 'have', 'Phroso', 'as', 'well', 'Madame', 'Tetrallini', 'who', 'defend', 'freaks', 'consider', 'question', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'found', 'acting', 'Freaks', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'part', 'Wallace', 'Ford', 'Earles', 'siblings', 'Harry', 'Daisy', 'Earles', 'play', 'Hans', 'Frieda', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Daisy', 'performance', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'concern', 'lover', 'Hans', 'just', 'be', 'happy', 'really', 'believe', 'that.As', 'far', 'horror', 'aspect', 'film', 'concerned', 'really', ""n't"", 'horrifying', 'sense', ""n't"", 'truly', 'scary', 'fact', 'remain', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'scary', 'looking', 'know', 'mean', 'fact', 'alone', 'may', 'send', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine', 'especially', 'when', 'start', 'chanting', 'one', 'when', 'are', 'crawling', 'knives', 'hand', 'truthfully', 'Freaks', 'horrifying', 'common', 'thread', 'thought', 'found', 'many', 'people', 'today', 'line', 'thinking', 'not', 'only', 'hurtful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'here', 'very', 'dangerous']",N/A

281188,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6301969588,Anyechka,"[4, 5]","This is one of those films that it's unfair to accurately judge after just one viewing, much like there are some albums that you just have to listen to a few times for them to fully sink in and make sense.  The plot of this film itself is little more than a soap opera set in a circus sideshow, and given the short length, there isn't much room for a very complex plot or a lot of character development apart from the top main characters.  It's kind of unfair that some films have such unquestioned reputations; naturally some people will feel let down or that the movie's overrated after they finally see it for themselves if it didn't blow their minds or keep them riveted throughout.  The film's greatness and classic status go deeper than the hype and its reputation (in large part due to having been banned in England and a number of other places for over 30 years and what a major box office bomb it was in many places).  It's a revolutionary concept not a lot of people were ready for in 1932, presenting the ""freaks"" as the normal ones, the good guys, and the ""normal"" people in the circus as the evil bad guys up to no good.  Today you also would probably never get away with making a movie like this, since it would be seen as cruel to the disabled.  As it's pointed out in the excellent documentary and the audio commentary, for most people who had physical abnormalities in those days (such as the quite sweet and charming microencephalitics, or ""pinheads,"" Prince Randion, the living torso, the dwarves, the armless young ladies, and the ""half-boy"" Johnny Eck, who was very charming and good-looking), a circus sideshow was really the only place they could make a living and feel like they belonged and were wanted somewhere.  They looked after their own, even if they were seen by most of the public as hideous horrific ""freaks.""Today the film doesn't seem quite so scary, since many people are used to seeing people with such physical conditions (dwarves, people missing a lower body, armless people, people with unusual physical characteristics but who have nothing physically wrong with them otherwise), even interacting with them, although the climax during the thunderstorm, the freaks crawling after Cleopatra in the mud, armed with weapons, is still some pretty creepy stuff.  It's also very unfortunate that it doesn't have as big an impact as Browning probably wanted it to have, since about 30 minutes of what he intended as footage are gone.  If there had been no strict censorship or Hays Code, this could have been that much more of a shocking compelling movie.  At times it also has that stilted feel a lot of early talkies do, such as how the camera isn't able to move around as much as it could just a few years back.  At times it's also hard to make out what some people are saying, due to some of the problems with early sound recording that hadn't been quite ironed out yet.  Besides having the feel of an early sound film (a medium, it's pointed out in the audio commentary, that Browning was never fully comfortable with or enamoured of), most of the actors also weren't trained professional actors.  Still, in spite of some technical problems, issues with censorship, and not having a fully professional cast, it does start to seem better when given more than just one viewing.",4,Gets better with repeated viewings,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,3313,"['one', 'films', 'unfair', 'accurately', 'judge', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', 'much', 'are', 'albums', 'just', 'have', 'listen', 'few', 'times', 'fully', 'sink', 'make', 'sense', 'plot', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'set', 'circus', 'sideshow', 'given', 'short', 'length', ""n't"", 'much', 'room', 'very', 'complex', 'plot', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'apart', 'top', 'main', 'characters', 'kind', 'unfair', 'films', 'have', 'such', 'unquestioned', 'reputations', 'naturally', 'people', 'will', 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'movie', 'overrated', 'finally', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'minds', 'keep', 'riveted', 'film', 'greatness', 'classic', 'status', 'go', 'deeper', 'hype', 'reputation', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'having', 'been', 'banned', 'England', 'number', 'other', 'places', '30', 'years', 'what', 'major', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'was', 'many', 'places', 'revolutionary', 'concept', 'not', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'ready', '1932', 'presenting', 'freaks', 'normal', 'ones', 'good', 'guys', 'normal', 'people', 'circus', 'evil', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'Today', 'also', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'cruel', 'disabled', 'pointed', 'out', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'audio', 'commentary', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'physical', 'abnormalities', 'days', 'such', 'quite', 'sweet', 'charming', 'microencephalitics', 'pinheads', 'Prince', 'Randion', 'living', 'torso', 'dwarves', 'armless', 'young', 'ladies', 'half-boy', 'Johnny', 'Eck', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'charming', 'good-looking', 'circus', 'sideshow', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'place', 'could', 'make', 'living', 'feel', 'belonged', 'were', 'wanted', 'somewhere', 'looked', 'own', 'even', 'were', 'seen', 'most', 'public', 'hideous', 'horrific', 'freaks', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'so', 'scary', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'people', 'such', 'physical', 'conditions', 'dwarves', 'people', 'missing', 'lower', 'body', 'armless', 'people', 'people', 'unusual', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'physically', 'wrong', 'otherwise', 'even', 'interacting', 'climax', 'thunderstorm', 'freaks', 'crawling', 'Cleopatra', 'mud', 'armed', 'weapons', 'still', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'stuff', 'also', 'very', 'unfortunate', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'big', 'impact', 'Browning', 'probably', 'wanted', 'have', '30', 'minutes', 'what', 'intended', 'footage', 'are', 'gone', 'had', 'been', 'no', 'strict', 'censorship', 'Hays', 'Code', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'shocking', 'compelling', 'movie', 'times', 'also', 'stilted', 'feel', 'lot', 'early', 'talkies', 'do', 'such', 'how', 'camera', ""n't"", 'able', 'move', 'around', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'times', 'also', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'due', 'problems', 'early', 'sound', 'recording', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'quite', 'ironed', 'out', 'yet', 'having', 'feel', 'early', 'sound', 'film', 'medium', 'pointed', 'out', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Browning', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'comfortable', 'enamoured', 'most', 'actors', 'also', 'were', ""n't"", 'trained', 'professional', 'actors', 'Still', 'spite', 'technical', 'problems', 'issues', 'censorship', 'not', 'having', 'fully', 'professional', 'cast', 'start', 'seem', 'better', 'when', 'given', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'viewing']",N/A

FREAKS is easily Tod Browning's crowning achievement. While his interpretation of DRACULA may have created some of the genre's most defining moments, his visual storytelling and stylism are far exceeded in this film. It is so rich in character, depicting the so-called ""freaks"" in such an endearing and human manner, while showing the most cruel and intolerable sides of the ""normal"" characters. Every single performance is genuine and sincere, transposing the viewer into a fly on the wall in what feels like an honest portrayal of true events. On top of the superb characterizations, the incredible carnival settings give the film even more authenticity, painting the backdrop in stimulating curves and High Gothic atmosphere. The final nightmarish sequence where the carnival folk stalk the vile Cleopatra through the mud and rain is the only moment of true horror, but while it stands out as the most frightening moment in the film, it also contradicts the positive portrayal of the freaks established throughout the rest of the plot.

281199,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6301969588,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 3]","Tod Browning's 1932 cult classic film Freaks is not what most people seem to think it is. It is neither a blatantly exploitative film nor a film of profound compassion. Of all of his films, silent or not, it is in many ways both his most artlessly produced yet also his most indelible- even more so than Dracula, which came out a year before. Most of all, though, it is not a horror film. Yes, it is horrifying to look at the poor freaks that are onscreen, and the film has the exterior trappings of a horror film, in terms of mood and sets, but the film is really about the human desire for love, and the often impotent pursuit of it. Even the normal sized people in the film are not able to achieve real love.The tale of the film is almost as well known as the tale within the film. The exterior story is how the film was critically lambasted, after MGM studio decisions led to its demotion from a film with A List MGM stars (Myrna Loy and Jean Harlow) to a B List film Irving Thalberg couldn't stand (reputedly exclaiming, `Well, I asked for a horror film, and this film is horrible!'). This drubbing by critics and lack of care by the studio led to the film's poor box office, and its being pulled from circulation for nearly thirty years, after being banned in many cities. However, it did enjoy more success in Europe, which fed its reputation, and a desire to be seen in its natal country by a newer, hipper generation. Then, in the early 1960s, it was pulled out of mothballs stateside and became a hit on the college and late night film circuit under many different titles, including Nature's Mistakes. In the 1980s, when videotapes of films became popular, rentals and sales cemented its niche as one of the greatest comeback films in Hollywood history. Not even the much documented travails of It's A Wonderful Life could compare with what Freaks had to endure to attain its status as a classic.But, classic does not always equal great, nor masterpiece- two terms that are now often associated with the film. That's because the interior story of the film, and its execution, simply do not hold up well. The basic tale is about a carnival full of human oddities, and how the strongman (Henry Victor) and female acrobat (Olga Baclanova) plot to steal the fortune of the star attraction- a midget named Hans (Harry Earles), by having her marry him, then killing him.... In short (no pun intended), Freaks is neither bad nor brilliant, nor does it carry any deep nor important message, but it is fascinating to watch, albeit in the way a festering sore, or one insect eating another, can be. Is its depiction of thwarted love, vengeance, and bigotry exploitative? Of course. Is it sympathetic? Yes.

K,"[1, 1]","Hans played by Harry Earles is getting married to Cleopatra played by Olga Baclanova who is a beautiful trapeze artist, but she is only marrying Hans for his inheritance, she plays him for a fool and once Hans' friend's finds out all hell breaks lose.Upon its release in 1932 Freaks caused quite an outrage; at the time Tod Browning was coming off Dracula, which gave him full creative control when he made Freaks. Using real sideshow performers, Freaks sparked outrage among the viewers. Even in this day and age a movie like Freaks would probably never get over in this PC world; actually it would probably never make it into production. So just imagine how it went back in the 1930s.Originally Freaks ran at about 90-minutes, but was chopped down to a little over an hour, but that didn't help much. The movie was still hated and still ripped a part by the critics; for the longest time Freaks was banned in several countries and as well as several states in the US.I enjoy a lot of Tod Browning's work, but a lot of the times I feel there is just something lacking from his movies. Some just sort of lack even though they are good movies. Some of the problem was Browning had a tough time making the transition from silent films to speaking films, but Freaks, though is his masterpiece. I would love to see the movie in its complete running time, but I think that might create some pacing problems. With the running time just over an hour there isn't really any slow moments and the character development is actually very solid.After Freaks, Tod Browning would never recover. He was one of the top horror filmmakers at the time of the release, but his career would take a massive nosedive and was on a very short leash by studios. He went from having creative control to having none. Freaks can almost be seen as the first exploitation flick, but the freaks are never exploited; we the audience, are able to identify with them, where as the so called normal characters are the most vile. The characters are interesting and like I said it's with the freaks we the audience will feel more comfortable with. All of them are excellent and really do a great job.As a director Tod Browning does a great job here; like I said as much as I like his work sometimes I feel it's just missing something and even the pacing can be a little off at times, but Freaks moves at a great pace, has great characters and just when it starts to slow down, it picks right up for the final stretch. The final act is simply wonderful and creepy. Freaks, is by no means a scary movie and I don't see how even back in 1932 this would scare people. But the final moments of the film is actually quite creepy and so amazingly set up.After Freaks, Tod Browning who was a very active filmmaker would only go on and direct 4 more films, one of them he was un-credited; Freaks though now a cult classic sadly ruined his career. Most people will cite Dracula as the defying moment in Tod Browning's career, but I'd go with Freaks anytime over it. Freaks, is easily one of the best horror pictures of the 1930s and to this day holds up as one of the horror genres very best.",4,"Gooble, Gobble, Gooble, Gobble we accept her one of us.",1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,3143,"['Hans', 'played', 'Harry', 'Earles', 'getting', 'married', 'Cleopatra', 'played', 'Olga', 'Baclanova', 'who', 'beautiful', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'only', 'marrying', 'Hans', 'inheritance', 'fool', 'once', 'Hans', 'friend', 'finds', 'out', 'hell', 'release', '1932', 'Freaks', 'caused', 'quite', 'outrage', 'time', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'Dracula', 'gave', 'full', 'creative', 'control', 'when', 'made', 'Freaks', 'Using', 'real', 'sideshow', 'performers', 'Freaks', 'sparked', 'outrage', 'viewers', 'Even', 'day', 'age', 'movie', 'Freaks', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'get', 'over', 'PC', 'world', 'actually', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'make', 'production', 'So', 'just', 'imagine', 'how', 'went', 'back', '1930s.Originally', 'Freaks', 'ran', '90-minutes', 'was', 'chopped', 'down', 'little', 'hour', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'hated', 'still', 'ripped', 'part', 'critics', 'longest', 'time', 'Freaks', 'was', 'banned', 'several', 'countries', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'states', 'US.I', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'work', 'lot', 'times', 'feel', 'just', 'something', 'lacking', 'movies', 'just', 'sort', 'lack', 'even', 'are', 'good', 'movies', 'problem', 'was', 'Browning', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'making', 'transition', 'silent', 'films', 'speaking', 'films', 'Freaks', 'though', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'complete', 'running', 'time', 'think', 'might', 'create', 'pacing', 'problems', 'running', 'time', 'just', 'hour', ""n't"", 'really', 'slow', 'moments', 'character', 'development', 'actually', 'very', 'solid.After', 'Freaks', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'would', 'never', 'recover', 'was', 'one', 'top', 'horror', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'release', 'career', 'would', 'take', 'massive', 'nosedive', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'leash', 'studios', 'went', 'having', 'creative', 'control', 'having', 'none', 'Freaks', 'can', 'almost', 'be', 'seen', 'first', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'freaks', 'are', 'never', 'exploited', 'audience', 'are', 'able', 'identify', 'where', 'so', 'called', 'normal', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'vile', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'said', 'freaks', 'audience', 'will', 'feel', 'more', 'comfortable', 'are', 'excellent', 'really', 'do', 'great', 'job.As', 'director', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'said', 'as', 'much', 'work', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'just', 'missing', 'something', 'even', 'pacing', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'off', 'times', 'Freaks', 'great', 'pace', 'great', 'characters', 'just', 'when', 'slow', 'down', 'right', 'up', 'final', 'stretch', 'final', 'act', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'creepy', 'Freaks', 'scary', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'even', 'back', '1932', 'would', 'scare', 'people', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'creepy', 'so', 'amazingly', 'set', 'up.After', 'Freaks', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'active', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'only', 'go', 'direct', '4', 'more', 'films', 'one', 'was', 'un-credited', 'Freaks', 'now', 'cult', 'classic', 'sadly', 'ruined', 'career', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'cite', 'Dracula', 'defying', 'moment', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'career', ""'d"", 'go', 'Freaks', 'anytime', 'Freaks', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'pictures', '1930s', 'day', 'up', 'one', 'horror', 'very', 'best']",N/A

It usually shows up on TV around Halloween, but every time I watch it, I ponder whether this movie should be considered a horror film.There are definately horrific elements here, the but it's not what you think upon first glance. How many times have you watched a horror film and felt that the wrong character was being portrayed as a ""monster""? Think ofFrankenstein (1931), through the ages it's Karloff's lumbering creature that is played for chills, but when you watch the film, and the superior sequelThe Bride of Frankenstein, you realize the real ""monster"" is the doctor, not his creation. Yet it's the monster that pays the price, hunted and murdered by a mob of towns people.If you watch a bunch of creature features, it's always those who fall outside the norm that are portrayed as ""monsters"", even if there is no bad or evil intent. Whether it'sKing Kong (1933) [HD],The Hunchback of Notre DameorIt Came from Outer Space, you feel badly for how these characters are treated, and you wish they would strike back at the people out to persecute them.Well with ""Freaks"" you get your wish. We see that the real freaks in this film are the ""pretty"" people who manipulate and use those around them. They have no loyalty, morals or faith. They scheme for money, for pleasure and plot murder, while the titular Freaks are shown to be caring, loving people who may be deformed in body, but not in spirit. We also are told that to offend one is to offend all, and that lesson is driven home in last 10-15 minutes of the movie. But it's not scary, riveting for sure, but not scary.

Based on the short story 'Spurs' by Tod Robbins, the movie tells the story of a circus midget who falls in love with a beautiful, 'normal' trapeze artist. When she and her strongman lover try to poison him for his money, the 'freaks' exact their revenge on them. Browning, a former circus performer himself, treats his unusual cast of real-life circus freaks with genuine sympathy. They are the true human element of the film. In most ways this is the first truely compassionate horror film ever made. But upon it's release, censors flipped, audiences ran in horror, and the film was yanked from the screen and banned in Europe for 40 years. A shame, indeed, as the film is a true triumph for Browning. A film that makes a convincing argument about our expectations of beauty and humanity. Sure, it's creepy and frightening. But it's also very sad. It shows you that it's not what we look like that makes us human or that we don't have to be beautiful to be respected. A strange argument for a 'horror' film to make. The only downside to this long-lost and vastly underappreciated film is that the sound can sometimes be rather muffled and a few of the actors have thick accents that sometimes make understanding the dialogue a chore. But it's a minor complaint and doesn't really distract from the wonder up on the screen. If you're in the mood for something a little... uh... different... definitely check this one out.

In every horror film, the movie goers had that ""net"" of saying to themselves, no matter how horrific the film was, ""this is only make-believe"".  One loses that in the provoking film by Tod Browning (who directed Lugosi in the original Dracula).  This is really uncharted territory, (though Nightmare Alley with Tyron Power, 1947 walked into this realm very effectively), the lives of the Circus Freaks.  By today's standard it's still having a hard time gaining respect in the politically correct consciousness where we would blanche at calling any human a freak.Still, Browning's tale is haunting, mermerizing.  It's a story of love, betrayal and the ultimate retribution acted out by the circus freaks themselves in an eye for an eye justice.  Evil trapeze artist, Olga Baclanova deliberately sets out to seduce and marry a midget in the circus sideshow, with a wicked eye on getting his money.  However, the perfectly gorgeous Olga has crossed the line with the tightly knit community of the very human and compassionate - just different - sideshow artists.  These people use their ""differences"" to make a living in the world.  They endure the harsh treatment and laughter at their expense, but they have a very supportive code amongst themselves.  And for Olga to see the little man as an easy target and cause his death, it is beyond the pale to them.  The sideshow people are a family, a clan, and when you do something to one of them, you do it to all of them.Browning set out with a very provocative premise - frankly, I am still amazed after all these years the film was made - because Browning did not go for the more ""acceptable"" sideshow denizens, he went for the most famous of the era.  It was a move that very nearly cost him his career.  And that is where the viewer loses the safety net.  This is real people displaying their sad and strange peculiarities.

These are real side-show ""freaks"" and no matter how distubing, using anything less would have produced a real travesty. Of course, watching this array of human deformity takes some getting used to-- the pin-heads, the human torso, the truncated man, the human toothpick, the dwarves, and all the others. But once you get past the revulsion,  there's fascination, then compassion, and finally (I think) normal acceptance. They are, after all, as human as the rest of us, and it's to Browning's everlasting credit that he leads us through such stages without pity or condescension. The real monsters, of course, are the two pretty people who show their inner deformity by abusing these human unfortunates.Not everything, however, is praiseworthy. Trapeze artist Baclanova and her strongman  overact shamelessly. Their hammed up gestures almost bring down the entire proceedings, and  I can't help wondering why Browning let them get so out of hand. Also, chronic stutterer Roscoe Ates, whose speech problem is not really so funny when you think about it, is put to dubious effect as comic relief. But these are small potatoes when contrasted with the unique overall effect.What really surprises me is that this movie curiosity comes from the unlikeliest of sources, Louis B. Mayer's MGM. This so-called Tiffany of studios always prided itself on pretty people, big rooms, and wholesome entertainment. No wonder they pulled the film and stripped off their logo after seeing the on-screen result. This is a long, long way from Andy Hardy and Carverville, USA. I gather it was Irving Thallberg, head of production, who pushed the project over Mayer's objections. Perhaps it was the precarious state of his own health that gave him the compassionate drive necessary to complete such a dubious oddity. Nonetheless, whatever the source or reason, this is truly a one-of-a-kind movie experience and not to be missed.",5,A Classic,1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,1998,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'grisly', 'climax', 'fool', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'humane', 'movies', 'record', 'are', 'real', 'side-show', 'freaks', 'matter', 'how', 'distubing', 'using', 'anything', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'produced', 'real', 'travesty', 'course', 'watching', 'array', 'human', 'deformity', 'getting', 'used', 'pin-heads', 'human', 'torso', 'truncated', 'man', 'human', 'toothpick', 'dwarves', 'others', 'once', 'get', 'revulsion', 'fascination', 'then', 'compassion', 'finally', 'think', 'normal', 'acceptance', 'are', 'as', 'human', 'rest', 'Browning', 'everlasting', 'credit', 'such', 'stages', 'pity', 'condescension', 'real', 'monsters', 'course', 'are', 'two', 'pretty', 'people', 'who', 'show', 'inner', 'deformity', 'abusing', 'human', 'unfortunates.Not', 'everything', 'however', 'praiseworthy', 'Trapeze', 'artist', 'Baclanova', 'strongman', 'overact', 'shamelessly', 'hammed', 'up', 'gestures', 'almost', 'bring', 'down', 'entire', 'proceedings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'why', 'Browning', 'let', 'get', 'so', 'hand', 'Also', 'chronic', 'stutterer', 'Roscoe', 'Ates', 'speech', 'problem', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'funny', 'when', 'think', 'put', 'dubious', 'effect', 'comic', 'relief', 'are', 'small', 'potatoes', 'when', 'contrasted', 'unique', 'overall', 'effect.What', 'really', 'movie', 'curiosity', 'unlikeliest', 'sources', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'MGM', 'so-called', 'Tiffany', 'studios', 'always', 'prided', 'pretty', 'people', 'big', 'rooms', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'wonder', 'pulled', 'film', 'stripped', 'off', 'logo', 'seeing', 'on-screen', 'result', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'Carverville', 'USA', 'gather', 'was', 'Irving', 'Thallberg', 'head', 'production', 'who', 'pushed', 'project', 'Mayer', 'objections', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'precarious', 'state', 'own', 'health', 'gave', 'compassionate', 'drive', 'necessary', 'complete', 'dubious', 'oddity', 'Nonetheless', 'source', 'reason', 'truly', 'one-of-a-kind', 'movie', 'experience', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

What they don't tell you is that this is not a horror movie.  This movie is actually intended to show real freaks in real life; the story plot is probably the most unrealistic part of the movie, even though it's standard soap opera and you might even watch this same plot on TV today.What makes this movie interesting isn't the plot, it's the actors, or I should say the people acting out the story.  Because most of them aren't really acting.  The leading villainess is probably an actor, I don't know.  And there are probably a few other real actors here.  But most of the ""actors"" are real freaks: the pinheads, the midgets, the siamese twins, the human torso.  The pinheads don't need to act out their confusion and inarticulation; it's real.  The midgets don't have to act out their social isolation.  The siamese twins don't have to act out their physical and mental fusion.  And the human torso doesn't have to practice lighting a cigarette with no arms and no legs to make it look real.Because these ""actors"" are real freaks.  And, more importantly, they are real human beings.  Which is why the title ""Freaks"" is so ironic; this is a movie about human beings who also happen to be freaks.Seventy years ago, people ran away screaming because they didn't want to believe it was real, and this movie was banned for a long time.  Today, I'd like to think that people watching this movie have more understanding about the real message in this movie, that a human freak is not just a freak, but a human being also.This is not a horror movie.  And it's not an exploitation movie.  It's in a category all by itself.

281211,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,6301969588,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[3, 6]","""Freaks"" was directed by Tod Browning, who also directed ""Dracula,"" and both of them are included on my Top 50 list. Of all the earlier movies that I have seen, this has to be the oddest, but it is brilliant in it's own way. Had this movie been made at this point in time, the freaks would have been all made with famous actors that have had computer's affecting the way they look, to make it look odd. The beauty of watching this version, which was made in 1932, was that all of the freaks were real. I don't use the term ""freaks"" to be mean, but I am trying to refer to the title of the movie. On the outside, these freaks are just people to make fun of, and you could laugh or be disturbed by their appearance, but they are people too, and this movie touches the emotions of them. This movie is not made great, but it is so odd, and so fun to watch that it's hard to hate it. The acting isn't so good, but it's not supposed to be. The sound could be a little shotty at time, but that grows over time. The point is, you should see this movie to experience this odd world. It's a world unlike anything we've ever seen, because this point in life you don't know what's real or not. This is the real thing. Harry Earles plays Tiny Hans, the ""main character."" He doesn't have a large credit list, but was in a few silent films, and his last movie was ""The Wizard of Oz."" If you have that, he's one of the lollipop guys, the one in blue. He's not a great actor, as this movie could prove, but he's such a likeable guy, that you have to feel sorry for him as you watch this.Tiny Hans in one of the circus freaks. Him and Frieda, who is played by his real life sister, are in love, and Hans claims that he will never stop loving her. That is, until a grown women by the name of Cleopatra is sweet to him, but she just has her eyes set on his fortune. She has a man in her life, and he is a normal one, and his name is Hercules. Cleopatra ""flirts"" with Hans, and Hans flirts with Cleopatra, until they finally end up getting married. Hans is in love, but Cleopatra is greedy. After getting married, she plans on killing him, but after she and Hercules get drunk at the wedding party, they end up embarressing him. The other freaks learn what she plans to do, so they end up hatching a plan. This plan is so violent, and horrifying, that it's just so amazing to see this.The most amazing thing about ""Freaks"" is the freaks themselves. The movie is kind to the freaks, and they never make fun of them. I like how they show all of these special talents that the freaks have. There is one freaks that doesn't have any arms or legs. When he walks, he has to crawl on his mid-section. There is one scene where he lights a cigarette, and it is amazing to watch. There is a man that has no legs, and he walks on his hands. The great thing is, is that he runs on his hands faster than all of the people that I know that run on their feet. There are two women that are stuck together, and when one of them kisses his boyfriend, the other one can feel it, and she smiles in pleasure. There was a women who ate with her foot, and a half women-half man. We get to see their special talents, and it is a message to the viewer that they are peopel too. The people that try to use their odd looks to hurt them. There is such a difference in all of these characters, that it's hard to understand the cruelness of man. ""Freaks"" is a horror movie, that was actually banned in many countries, and still in Sweden, until recently. It's so shocking because it's different. I'm sure at the time people saw this they feared these people. Half of the freaks just had odd shaped faces, and they are extremly different. This is one of my favorite movies, and I recommend you to see it just to see these talents that many people overlook just because they look a little different.ENJOY!Rated NR but I would actually rate it PG-13 for Strong Thematical Elements.",5,One of Us!,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,3927,"['Freaks', 'was', 'directed', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Dracula', 'are', 'included', 'Top', '50', 'list', 'earlier', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'be', 'oddest', 'brilliant', 'own', 'way', 'Had', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'point', 'time', 'freaks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'famous', 'actors', 'have', 'had', 'computer', 'affecting', 'way', 'look', 'make', 'look', 'odd', 'beauty', 'watching', 'version', 'was', 'made', '1932', 'was', 'freaks', 'were', 'real', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'term', 'freaks', 'be', 'mean', 'am', 'trying', 'refer', 'title', 'movie', 'outside', 'freaks', 'are', 'just', 'people', 'make', 'fun', 'could', 'laugh', 'be', 'disturbed', 'appearance', 'are', 'people', 'too', 'movie', 'emotions', 'movie', 'not', 'made', 'great', 'so', 'odd', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'hard', 'hate', 'acting', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'sound', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'shotty', 'time', 'time', 'point', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'experience', 'odd', 'world', 'world', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'point', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'real', 'not', 'real', 'thing', 'Harry', 'Earles', 'Tiny', 'Hans', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'credit', 'list', 'was', 'few', 'silent', 'films', 'last', 'movie', 'was', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'have', 'one', 'lollipop', 'guys', 'one', 'blue', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'movie', 'could', 'prove', 'such', 'likeable', 'guy', 'have', 'feel', 'sorry', 'watch', 'this.Tiny', 'Hans', 'one', 'circus', 'freaks', 'Him', 'Frieda', 'who', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'sister', 'are', 'love', 'Hans', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'loving', 'grown', 'women', 'name', 'Cleopatra', 'sweet', 'just', 'eyes', 'set', 'fortune', 'man', 'life', 'normal', 'one', 'name', 'Hercules', 'Cleopatra', 'flirts', 'Hans', 'flirts', 'Cleopatra', 'finally', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'married', 'Hans', 'love', 'Cleopatra', 'greedy', 'getting', 'married', 'killing', 'Hercules', 'get', 'drunk', 'wedding', 'party', 'end', 'up', 'embarressing', 'other', 'freaks', 'learn', 'what', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'hatching', 'plan', 'plan', 'so', 'violent', 'horrifying', 'just', 'so', 'amazing', 'see', 'this.The', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'Freaks', 'freaks', 'movie', 'kind', 'freaks', 'never', 'make', 'fun', 'like', 'how', 'show', 'special', 'talents', 'freaks', 'have', 'one', 'freaks', ""n't"", 'have', 'arms', 'legs', 'When', 'crawl', 'mid-section', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'cigarette', 'amazing', 'watch', 'man', 'legs', 'hands', 'great', 'thing', 'hands', 'faster', 'people', 'know', 'run', 'feet', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'stuck', 'together', 'when', 'one', 'boyfriend', 'other', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'pleasure', 'was', 'women', 'who', 'ate', 'foot', 'half', 'women-half', 'man', 'get', 'see', 'special', 'talents', 'message', 'viewer', 'are', 'peopel', 'too', 'people', 'try', 'use', 'odd', 'looks', 'hurt', 'such', 'difference', 'characters', 'hard', 'understand', 'cruelness', 'man', 'Freaks', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'banned', 'many', 'countries', 'still', 'Sweden', 'recently', 'so', 'shocking', 'different', ""'m"", 'sure', 'time', 'people', 'saw', 'feared', 'people', 'Half', 'freaks', 'just', 'had', 'odd', 'shaped', 'are', 'extremly', 'different', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'recommend', 'see', 'just', 'see', 'talents', 'many', 'people', 'overlook', 'just', 'look', 'little', 'different.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'NR', 'would', 'actually', 'rate', 'PG-13', 'Strong', 'Thematical', 'Elements']",N/A

As expected, many of my classmates were repulsed by it and left that class with a grimaced look on their faces. And I'm sure this reaction is common for many people who see ""Freaks"" for the first time. But if one puts all prejudices aside and looks at the movie objectively, they will see this film for the great achievement it really is.""Freaks"" is about a group of circus sideshow performers, all of whom are aberrations of some sort. We have the human torso, siamese twins, 2 microcephalics, etc. What they all have in common (besides their oddities) is a life of abuse and exploitation from their owners. Deciding to band together as a unit, they set out to get retribution and some respect. And the final scene is truly unforgettable in its own surreal and tragic way. You will ask yourself, who are the REAL freaks?As I said, this movie is not for everyone, but not only for the obvious reason. It forces us to look at ourselves and see our own flaws and admit that we have all rejected (and perhaps been on the receiving end of rejection) before. I doubt the movie's message is as cliche and corny as ""love thy neighbor and each other,"" but it's something along those lines. Perhaps the true message is that when people step on those who are different, they're only projecting their own insecurities and fears. But whatever message this movie has, it's a brilliant work of art that pushes the envelope and deals with a subject that few are comfortable looking at head-on. For that reason alone it should be seen at least once, and hopefully purchased.Finally, it's great that Warner Brothers has released this gem on DVD. I'm very impressed with the sound and audio quality. Bonus material is quite substantial considering how old this movie is. Among the features is an informative commentary by David Skal and 3 alternate endings. These other endings aren't as effective as the original IMO but are still interesting to see for novelty's sake. The only minor complaint I have is the absence of a chapter search card inside the DVD case, or at least some kind of booklet. I don't know, it makes the overall DVD presentation seem incomplete.

This is by far one of the worst DVD's to a film I have ever had, and the fact that there was an enhanced version of the film for cheaper on Amazon infuriates me to no end. This DVD has a terrible presentation of the film. The picture quality is crap, and so is the sound. You can barely hear what anyone is saying, which would be OK if they put subtitles, because I'm a person who doesn't really hear that well. They don't have subtitles, and the sound and picture is chopped and butchered to Hell and back. It's a rare feat to actually make a movie way less scary than it already is, but this DVD does it.

281218,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301969588,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[7, 11]","In one sense, FREAKS is not a greatly well-make film. The plot is little more than soap-opera, the script is weak, the performances are merely adequate, and the cinematography and sound are occasionally a bit less than adequate. Even so, it is a very memorable film.  The thing which makes the film memorable? Why, the &quot;Freaks,&quot; of course.Some of these so-called &quot;freaks,&quot; such as the famous Hilton sisters, were actually popular stage performers; others were from circuses, carnvials, and sideshows. Among the latter we find several performers who are very obviously mentally impaired. Their presence gives the film a certain aura of explotation that will likely make a modern viewer feel more than a little uncomfortable. The viewer's discomfort is further increased because, with the exception of a very few (again, the Hilton sisters come to mind), these performers do not actually perform at all. They simply exist, and director Browning uses them much as one would use a set device or a special effect. The the result can be profoundly disturbing indeed, particularly in the film's climax, when we watch the &quot;Freaks&quot; flop, slither, and crawl through the mud in a driving rain--and more disturbing still when one of the most obviously mentally impaired cheerfully picks up a knife with which to attack their victim.I generally tell people they should see the film at least once. After that--it rather depends on how you feel about it, whether or not you think the director is justified in the display. And that is no &quot;modern&quot; issue--it was the issue then as well. For myself, I have seen the film at least three times: once at a film festival; once, when it was rented by a friend who wished to see it; and once when it just happened to be the only going on cable tv at 2 in the morning. And my own feelings about it? I don't know. I bet you won't either.

281219,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6301969588,Get What We Give,"[19, 21]","Tod Browning, in 1932, created a film that in its time was considered so repugnant that it was quickly taken off the screen.  Great Britain banned its showing for over 30 years.  In the United States, it was not shown until it became available in the 1960's.  So why all the fuss?To appreciate this film (and most films and most books too), you need to create a visual time machine and travel to the period when the film was made.  In this case, in 1932, there was no television and there was no internet.  There most certainly weren't reality shows or ""talk shows"" of the Jerry Springer ilk.  In short, people who went out for entertainment, went to films, circuses, fairs, athletic events, etc.  It was a time when the ""televised news"" came as ""newsreels"" shown before a feature film.  Films such as ""Frankenstein,"" ""Dracula,"" etc. were considered truly horrifying.  When, in 1927, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" was released in all its silent glory - at Lon Chaney's unmasking, women fainted in theaters with regularity.  The world was a simpler place.  Actual murders, mutilations, etc. weren't shown in video over the cinema screens as happened with the repugnant ""Faces of Death"" films.  Jeffrey Dahmers and Ted Bundys didn't get worldwide press and have every disgusting detail of their crimes published.For frights people went to the horror films or they went to the circus side show.  That is when ""Freaks"" was made and this is the audience to whom the film was targeted.  It is with this knowledge that one must have to watch this film.""Freaks"" is a short film, coming in at just over an hour.  It would have been considered a ""short"" and shown on a double bill with another film.The premise of the film is that the denizens of a circus' sideshow encounter a possible murderer in their midst and they have a suspiscion of just who it is - the non-freak Olga, the trapeze artist - who has been seducing the resident male midget (who just happens to be from quite a wealthy European family).  She wants to get his money and to do so must convince him to drop the woman who truly loves him - and marry her.The plot is thin and the acting is marginal, at best.  However, what Browning was really doing was...yes, in part, exploiting the ""freaks""...showcasing real circus side show freaks.  You have a man born with no legs, who walks on his hands.  A man born with no arms, legs, shoulders, or hips (who is showcased as he demonstrates how he lights his own cigarettes).  There's the bearded lady, the pin heads, the strong man, the half man-half woman (who were in reality were hermaphrodites made up in halves for the general public, but for an extra amount would show you their privates to really demonstrate their uniqueness), and the aforementioned midgets to name a few.  These people weren't actors - they were real, honest-to-God circus sideshow freaks.  Each of these ""characters"" is given a brief showcase for their sideshow shtick, as it is worked into the story.""Freaks"" brought about a complete change in circuses throughout the United States.  It became all but illegal to have freak shows as the public became repulsed by such shameful displays of unfortunate humanity.  The feeling was that these people were not ""freaks,"" and shouldn't be exploited.  In reality, for the most part, these freaks had long ago realized their plight and decided to make a living from their disfigurement or deformity.  Frankly, most made a darn good living from the guilt off the ""normal"" folks and when that livlihood was taken away from them, they became destitute (but at least the normal folks could feel good about themselves for ""saving"" the poor pitiable ""freaks"" - HA).  It was one of the first of the ill-designed movements in the ""politically correct"" arena.However, time has a way of addressing injustices - even those well intentioned ones.  The circus ""freaks"" of the world spoke out and got angry with their livlihood having been taken away from them, without anyone asking them what they thought (When was the last time you heard of Barnum and Bailey's freak show?  There hasn't been one in over 60 years, because of all this fuss).  So, the public realized their concern was unnecessary and got off their high horse.So, watch ""Freaks"" for what it is:  a time capsule of a film that DOES have a very horrific scene in it (imagine yourself as a child seeing this film for the first time):  the angry freaks go after the person they believe is a murderer.  This takes place in the dark, during a driving rainstorm.Rent or buy this film and enjoy it without a bit of guilt!",5,"Wonderfully ""uncomfortable"" film shocks and thrills",1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,4584,"['Tod', 'Browning', '1932', 'created', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'considered', 'so', 'repugnant', 'was', 'quickly', 'taken', 'off', 'screen', 'Great', 'Britain', 'banned', 'showing', '30', 'years', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'became', 'available', '1960', 'why', 'fuss', 'appreciate', 'film', 'most', 'films', 'most', 'books', 'too', 'need', 'create', 'visual', 'time', 'machine', 'travel', 'period', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'case', '1932', 'was', 'television', 'was', 'internet', 'most', 'certainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'reality', 'talk', 'shows', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'ilk', 'short', 'people', 'who', 'went', 'out', 'entertainment', 'went', 'films', 'circuses', 'fairs', 'athletic', 'events', 'etc', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'televised', 'news', 'came', 'newsreels', 'shown', 'feature', 'film', 'Films', 'such', 'Frankenstein', 'Dracula', 'etc', 'were', 'considered', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'When', '1927', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'was', 'released', 'silent', 'glory', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'unmasking', 'women', 'fainted', 'theaters', 'regularity', 'world', 'was', 'simpler', 'place', 'Actual', 'murders', 'mutilations', 'etc', 'were', ""n't"", 'shown', 'video', 'cinema', 'screens', 'happened', 'repugnant', 'Faces', 'Death', 'films', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmers', 'Ted', 'Bundys', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'worldwide', 'press', 'have', 'disgusting', 'detail', 'crimes', 'published.For', 'frights', 'people', 'went', 'horror', 'films', 'went', 'circus', 'side', 'show', 'when', 'Freaks', 'was', 'made', 'audience', 'whom', 'film', 'was', 'targeted', 'knowledge', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'Freaks', 'short', 'film', 'coming', 'just', 'hour', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'short', 'shown', 'double', 'bill', 'film.The', 'premise', 'film', 'denizens', 'circus', 'sideshow', 'encounter', 'possible', 'murderer', 'midst', 'have', 'suspiscion', 'just', 'who', 'non-freak', 'Olga', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'who', 'been', 'seducing', 'resident', 'male', 'midget', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'European', 'family', 'get', 'money', 'do', 'so', 'must', 'convince', 'drop', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'marry', 'her.The', 'plot', 'thin', 'acting', 'marginal', 'best', 'However', 'what', 'Browning', 'was', 'really', 'doing', 'was', 'yes', 'part', 'exploiting', 'freaks', 'showcasing', 'real', 'circus', 'side', 'show', 'have', 'man', 'born', 'legs', 'who', 'hands', 'man', 'born', 'arms', 'legs', 'shoulders', 'hips', 'who', 'showcased', 'how', 'own', 'cigarettes', 'bearded', 'lady', 'pin', 'heads', 'strong', 'man', 'half', 'man-half', 'woman', 'who', 'were', 'reality', 'were', 'hermaphrodites', 'made', 'up', 'halves', 'general', 'public', 'extra', 'amount', 'would', 'show', 'privates', 'really', 'demonstrate', 'uniqueness', 'aforementioned', 'midgets', 'name', 'few', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'actors', 'were', 'real', 'honest-to-God', 'circus', 'sideshow', 'freaks', 'characters', 'given', 'brief', 'showcase', 'sideshow', 'shtick', 'worked', 'story', 'Freaks', 'brought', 'complete', 'change', 'circuses', 'United', 'States', 'became', 'illegal', 'have', 'freak', 'shows', 'public', 'became', 'repulsed', 'such', 'shameful', 'displays', 'unfortunate', 'humanity', 'feeling', 'was', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'freaks', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'exploited', 'reality', 'most', 'part', 'freaks', 'had', 'long', 'ago', 'realized', 'plight', 'decided', 'make', 'living', 'disfigurement', 'deformity', 'Frankly', 'most', 'made', 'darn', 'good', 'living', 'guilt', 'normal', 'folks', 'when', 'livlihood', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'became', 'destitute', 'least', 'normal', 'folks', 'could', 'feel', 'good', 'saving', 'poor', 'pitiable', 'freaks', 'HA', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'ill-designed', 'movements', 'politically', 'correct', 'arena.However', 'time', 'way', 'addressing', 'injustices', 'even', 'well', 'intentioned', 'ones', 'circus', 'freaks', 'world', 'spoke', 'out', 'got', 'angry', 'livlihood', 'having', 'been', 'taken', 'away', 'anyone', 'asking', 'what', 'thought', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'heard', 'Barnum', 'Bailey', 'freak', 'show', ""n't"", 'been', 'one', '60', 'years', 'fuss', 'So', 'public', 'realized', 'concern', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'got', 'off', 'high', 'horse.So', 'watch', 'Freaks', 'what', 'time', 'capsule', 'film', 'have', 'very', 'horrific', 'scene', 'imagine', 'child', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'angry', 'freaks', 'go', 'person', 'believe', 'murderer', 'place', 'dark', 'driving', 'rainstorm.Rent', 'buy', 'film', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'guilt']",N/A

281224,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6301969588,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 9]","Tod Browning's ""Freaks"" is most certainly an interesting movie.  Browning deserves a great deal of credit for bringing all of these different kinds of carnival characters together for this movie.  ""Freaks"" is a very effective drama that deals with the idea of vengeance.  This idea has been around since the beginning of time, but ""Freaks"" posits the freaks against the supposedly normal people.  Interestingly enough, it is the freaks that are the protagonists in this film, and the viewer feels and roots for the freaks.  However, this fact dilutes any horror associated with the film although the freaks are definitely creepy looking when they are coming after the trapeze artist and her strong man friend.  When I first watched this film, I was in awe of the freaks for what they were, and it's a powerful film from that standpoint alone.As unpopular as this may be, I think this movie is misinterpreted as a horror movie because there really is not any horror here other than the creepy scene with the freaks in the end.  Moreover, I find myself cheering for the freaks in the end to get their revenge, so there essentially is no horror there.  Indeed, ""Freaks"" is a drama, and it is unfair to the movie to be perceived as otherwise and I do not think that a horror movie was what Browning was after, certainly not one to stand the test of time.  I do believe what Browning was trying to do was to put the freaks in a more human and tight-knit family-oriented light.  After all, they are people and they have feelings just like any other people.  They love, they get angry, they get sad and they want revenge when they are wronged!  To me, this is what ""Freaks"" stands for, a very compassionate and empathetic drama about retribution for the less fortunate ones of the world.  The viewer becomes angry like the freaks when they are rejected by the trapeze artist and her lover at the wedding dinner.  Frankly, they're tired of being made fun of, and this is how Browning is able to place the freaks in a position to be justified in doing what they did to the trapeze artist and the strong man.  How they were able to pull off what they did to the trapeze artist is beyond me, but there's that Twighlight Zone feel to this movie for sure, and that's the best way I can explain it.In conclusion, ""Freaks"" is a pretty good movie that has gained a tremendous cult following, but how it got characterized as a great horror movie is truly beyond me because that is not what the movie is all about.

In 1931, MGM's head of production, Irving Thalberg, decided to take on the overwhelming success of competing studio Universal, and their success with such horror films as Dracula and Frankenstein, and create his own niche in that genre.  Drawing on a Tod Robbins novel called Spurs, screenwriter Willis Goldbeck created a world even more self-contained than that of Grand Hotel, the warped world of Freaks, the garish world of the circus sideshow, replete with bearded lady, vain acrobats, simpering pinheads, even a hermaphrodite. Thalberg's reaction to the script was: ""Well, I asked for something horrifying."" The film was shot in 36 days on the Culver City lot, using the same director from Dracula, Tod Browning, with real freaks brought in to populate this bizarre world. When the freaks were given the run of the lot and the MGM commissary, even the most hardened showbiz veterans were shocked! Upon its release in 1932, the film received so much bad press and created such ill will that MGM was forced to withdraw the release from circulation and suffered a loss of approximately $164,000 in Depression-era money.

It is sad to think that people would abuse and exploit other humans simply because they are handicapped.Todd Browning, who directed 1931`s ""Dracula,"" also directed this horror masterpiece which used real life ""circus freaks"" as actors.  Hans, a German midget, falls in love with a beautiful trapeze artist, Cleopatra.  Cleopatra pretends to love Hans while she and her secret lover, strongman Hercules, plan to kill him for his riches.  When they are caught in the act, the ""circus freaks"" exact a horrifying revenge.""Freaks"" made me feel more sympathetic towards those with handicaps.  They have feelings just like everyone else.  Hans insisted that he was a man despite his diminutive size.  Perhaps Todd Browning was trying to tell us that if you hurt one of these special people, then fate will take revenge upon you.  I never make fun of people who are overweight for fear that I might become overweight.  A horrible accident can easily take away the use of a limb or cause brain damage.  It's very easy to become a ""freak.""The ending of ""Freaks"" is very creepy and unsettling.  You won't soon forget it.  Do I feel sorry for Cleopatra?  Most certainly not.

281229,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,6301969588,J. Chambers,"[1, 1]","""Freaks"" is often listed as a horror film, but I don't think it really fits that genre. Actually, I'm not sure if it fits into any established genre. It's a unique film, one of the most bizarre yet spellbinding movies ever made. Almost all of the ""freaks"" were real, with no makeup or special effects used. One of them, the half-woman/half-man, was probably just a female impersonator and not a hermaphrodite, but the rest were shockingly real.After seeing the film, I found articles about most of the performers on Wikipedia. It was fascinating to read about the actors' lives. Daisy and Violet Hilton, the Siamese Twins, were for real, being born as twins joined at the pelvis. Frieda and Hans were actually sister and brother, played by Daisy and Harry Earles. The Human Skeleton was played by Peter Robinson, who was of average height but weighed less than 60 pounds. (Ironically, he married a circus fat lady who weighed 467 pounds.)As shocking as the film is, consider that the first audiences in 1932 found the film to be so disturbing that almost one-third of the film's length was eventually cut, and the ending changed, to make it more palatable to viewers. Even with that, the film was banned in the UK for thirty years. Unfortunately, the film of the original ending has been lost.Some reviewers have commented on the video and audio quality of the DVD. I think you have to consider that Freaks was made in 1932, in an era when ""talkies"" had only been made for about three years, and both film and audio recording technology was still fairly primitive.Check out the Freaks listing on IMDB for some bloopers that were pretty easy to spot.",5,Perhaps the most bizarre film ever made,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1649,"['Freaks', 'often', 'listed', 'horror', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'genre', 'Actually', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'established', 'genre', 'unique', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'spellbinding', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Almost', 'freaks', 'were', 'real', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'One', 'half-woman/half-man', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'female', 'impersonator', 'not', 'hermaphrodite', 'rest', 'were', 'shockingly', 'real.After', 'seeing', 'film', 'found', 'articles', 'most', 'performers', 'Wikipedia', 'was', 'fascinating', 'read', 'actors', 'lives', 'Daisy', 'Violet', 'Hilton', 'Siamese', 'Twins', 'were', 'real', 'being', 'born', 'twins', 'joined', 'pelvis', 'Frieda', 'Hans', 'were', 'actually', 'sister', 'brother', 'played', 'Daisy', 'Harry', 'Earles', 'Human', 'Skeleton', 'was', 'played', 'Peter', 'Robinson', 'who', 'was', 'average', 'height', 'weighed', 'less', '60', 'pounds', 'Ironically', 'married', 'circus', 'fat', 'lady', 'who', 'weighed', '467', 'pounds', 'shocking', 'film', 'consider', 'first', 'audiences', '1932', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'so', 'disturbing', 'almost', 'one-third', 'film', 'length', 'was', 'eventually', 'cut', 'ending', 'changed', 'make', 'more', 'palatable', 'viewers', 'Even', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'UK', 'thirty', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'original', 'ending', 'been', 'lost.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'DVD', 'think', 'have', 'consider', 'Freaks', 'was', 'made', '1932', 'era', 'when', 'talkies', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'made', 'three', 'years', 'film', 'audio', 'recording', 'technology', 'was', 'still', 'fairly', 'primitive.Check', 'out', 'Freaks', 'listing', 'IMDB', 'bloopers', 'were', 'pretty', 'easy', 'spot']",N/A

Browning definitely wanted to shock and unsettle his audience, and MGM wanted a horror film that would rival his earlier Dracula success; but what both eventually achieved was an exploitation styled B-Movie with flashes of brilliance that has entertained, insulted, and disgusted its audiences since its first showing in 1932.Beware...spoilers ahead.......................................The story of Hans (played by Harry Earles), and his futile infatuation with the considerably taller Cleopatra (played by Olga Baclanova), set against the backdrop of the sideshow and its singular denizens, still manages to make one ill at ease upon viewing; perhaps due in large part to the participation of those real-life freaks that Browning included in his film: Prince Randian, the Living Torso; Pete Robinson, the Living Skeleton; Olga Roderick, the Bearded Lady; Martha Morris, the Armless Wonder; Joseph/Josephine, the Half-Man, Half-Woman; the Pinheads; the Hilton Sisters; Johnny Eck, The Half-Boy; Angello Rossitto (you may recall him from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); and other performers whose countenances were well off the bell curve average. While Browning was indeed heading down a much less traveled cinematic road, with films like The Unholy Three and The Unknown, his penchant for the unconventional hit its zenith in Freaks.Taking Tod Robbins' story, Spurs, Browning (who had already used Robbins' novel The Unholy Three to critical and financial success), weaves a tale of intended murder and revenge that is visually stronger, and climactically more horrific than the original source material. Adding a sexual overtone that would undoubtedly offend just about everyone in his ""normal"" audience of the day, and portraying his performers as initially harmless people with dramatic life-altering physical characteristics, then turning them into demonic angels of vengeance when mistreated, he achieves a story and a mood that brings most viewers to an uncomfortable place they would rather avoid.The wedding scene is one of the highlights of the film. David J Skal has noted that this particular scene was shot by Browning using his silent film experience (his best work was done in silent films), and indeed, it is prefaced with a title card announcing The Wedding Feast. It is a pivotal point in the film, as Cleopatra humiliates Hans and all of his friends, thereby sealing her doom. Close-ups of the freaks enjoying the festivities is juxtaposed with Hans' growing realization that he has made a mistake as Cleopatra becomes more drunkenly brazen with Hercules, the sideshow's strongman, whom she has been seeing behind Hans' back. As Hans sits, humiliated and heart-broken, the freaks begin chanting ""gooble, gobble, gooble, gobble, we accept her, we accept her, one of us."" Angelo Rossitto jumps on the table and passes around a large goblet filled with wine, so that each of the freaks can sip from it. Cleopatra, alerted by Hercules as to what is transpiring, looks in horror as the cup comes closer and closer, eventually recoiling as the cup is held up to her. She takes the cup, but instead of sipping from it, yells ""No... dirty...slimy freaks!"" and tosses the wine into Rossitto's face. In his book, The Monster Show, Skal notes that the wedding feast was heavily censored, and one interesting element that would have intensified Cleopatra's horror at drinking from the communal goblet was removed: as the cup is being passed around, some freaks dribble into it.Foreshadowing the horror to come, Browning uses close-ups of Rossitto furtively peering into Hans' wagon, watching Cleopatra slowly poisoning him, and again as his scowling face peers into Hercules' wagon to see her and Hercules conspiring against Hans. What follows is one of horror cinema's more memorable series of scenes.As Tetrollini's Traveling Circus prepares to get under way during a dark and stormy night, we see Johnny Eck scampering beneath the wagons. As lightning and thunder play in the background, the camera follows him as he makes his way to the group of performers patiently waiting, away from prying eyes, for their moment of reckoning.Now under way, we cut to Hans' wagon, rolling along in the muddy road, where his friends watch as Cleopatra once again prepares her poisonous medication. Only this time, Hans confronts her, asking for the bottle of poison. His friends quietly pull out weapons and casually clean them, indicating their sinister intent. Cleopatra is understandably alarmed, and the spoon of poison drops from her fingers.We now cut to mighty Hercules, who is also having a bad night. A knife is thrown by one of the little people, and slides into Hercules' side, bringing him down to the muddy road, where he is relentlessly pursued by a swarm of freaks crawling through the mud and rain, brandishing knives. The scene is nightmarish and stands out as one of the most horrific visuals in horror cinema.As for Cleopatra, her wagon overturns and she briefly escapes the little monsters by running into the nearby woods. We see her screaming one last time as they close in on her. After her scream we cut to the sideshow where she appears as one of the freak attractions. Leaving how she arrived there up to the audience's imagination.",3,Zombos Closet Review,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,5320,"['What', 'were', 'Todd', 'Browning', 'MGM', 'thinking', 'when', 'made',

281237,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,6301969588,Joker,"[1, 1]","I just want to give a few thoughts on this classic.The plot:  A beautiful trapeze artist tricks a rich dwarf into marrying her.  She is after his money.  She has a lover, the circus strongman, and they work together to get their hands on this dwarf's fortune.  Can this sinister plot be stopped?When director Tod Browning made this bizarre and controversial movie, many people were shocked, disturbed, saddened, and found it distasteful and offensive.  The movie was even banned in some countries for a long time.  A shocking movie like this in 1932 was an example of art imitating life, whether this was acknowledged or not by the general public.  After all, freakshows existed in the typical carnival/circus of the day.  Not everybody embraced them, but back in the early part of the twentieth century such shows didn't offend nearly as many people as they do or would nowadays.  They were seen as fascinating, bizarre, yet disturbing and sad attractions.  Besides that, science and medicine hadn't advanced far enough to explain the freak-like appearance of some people, so there was a general lack of knowledge, and with that comes a lack of sensitivity.  Political correctness back then was almost nonexistent when it came to what attractions carnivals and circuses offered to patrons.  For example, back then people didn't squawk nearly as much about animals being used to entertain crowds and the ""cruelty"" shown toward them as they do nowadays, such as with the use of elephants, tigers, lions, etc.You no doubt will be affected by this movie when watching it (at least I THINK you will be).  You'll feel sadness, sympathy, and anger.  You'll also laugh, feel disturbed, and find yourself hoping for the demise of the greedy couple while rooting for the freaks.Overall, a classic film that will never be matched again.  They don't make them like this anymore, so I recommend seeing it for its historical significance.",5,"Bold, bizarre, and ahead of its time",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,1925,"['just', 'want', 'give', 'few', 'thoughts', 'classic.The', 'plot', 'beautiful', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'rich', 'dwarf', 'marrying', 'money', 'lover', 'circus', 'strongman', 'work', 'together', 'get', 'hands', 'dwarf', 'fortune', 'Can', 'sinister', 'plot', 'be', 'stopped', 'When', 'director', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'made', 'bizarre', 'controversial', 'movie', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'shocked', 'disturbed', 'saddened', 'found', 'distasteful', 'offensive', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'banned', 'countries', 'long', 'time', 'shocking', 'movie', '1932', 'was', 'example', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'was', 'acknowledged', 'not', 'general', 'public', 'freakshows', 'existed', 'typical', 'carnival/circus', 'day', 'Not', 'everybody', 'embraced', 'back', 'early', 'part', 'twentieth', 'century', 'such', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'offend', 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'would', 'nowadays', 'were', 'seen', 'fascinating', 'bizarre', 'disturbing', 'sad', 'attractions', 'science', 'medicine', 'had', ""n't"", 'advanced', 'far', 'enough', 'explain', 'freak-like', 'appearance', 'people', 'was', 'general', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'lack', 'sensitivity', 'Political', 'correctness', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'when', 'came', 'what', 'attractions', 'carnivals', 'circuses', 'offered', 'patrons', 'example', 'back', 'then', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'squawk', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'animals', 'being', 'used', 'entertain', 'crowds', 'cruelty', 'shown', 'do', 'nowadays', 'such', 'use', 'elephants', 'tigers', 'lions', 'etc.You', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'movie', 'when', 'watching', 'least', 'THINK', 'will', 'be', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'sadness', 'sympathy', 'anger', ""'ll"", 'also', 'laugh', 'feel', 'disturbed', 'find', 'hoping', 'demise', 'greedy', 'couple', 'rooting', 'freaks.Overall', 'classic', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'matched', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'historical', 'significance']",N/A

An evil trapeze artist seduces him away from his fianc&eacute;e and marries him.  Her plan is to poison him and take all his money.

The climatic chase at the end - where the freaks chase the bad guys through a rain storm - is disturbing because you can only imagine what they will do to them when they catch them.  The payoff left me disappointed however.  We know from the beginning that they somehow turn the villainess into a freak.  In my mind, her fate was too horrible to contemplate.  On screen, it earns a laugh.  It would be more frightening if we never see what happens to her.  The happy ending with the little couple reuniting feels tacked-on.This is a movie no one ever forgets watching.  It shows the direction horror would go in the future.

The story and plot is bad to mediocre, as well, [...]The cast is a remarkable who's who of what were at the time, sideshow performers or travelling acts, and in fact, the assembled collection is more numerous than any single group including Barnum and Bailey's circus.In addition to the movie, there is a nice commentary by author/historian David Skal, an hour-long documentary hosted by David Skal and others which gives a background biography of most of the performers. This includes:A man with only the upper half of his body. He obviously walked with his hands and scampered around quite well.A couple of women with no arms (at least one was quite adept and crocheted with her feet for fun (not shown))A pair of attractive English siamese twins (who were pretty successful in marketing themselves and got rich)A man without arms or legs, who in real life had 4 children, and could light his own smokesA human skeleton who weighed about 60 poundsA few midgets (one of which was in the Wizard of Oz)A couple ""bird women"" so named primarily for their facial characteristicsA bearded woman (who of all the cast, hated the movie the most) though or because, she had a small partA half-man/half-woman, although the evidence is a bit skimpyThree microcephalics (2 woman, 1 man - though he wears a dress for hygiene simplification) who are quite charming.There is also a collection of the multiple versions of the ending.Amid mostly critical boos, the movie was pulled from its limited release in 1932, but gained a cult following during the 1960's as the term ""freak"" (and ""hippie"") became more in use and people found the film again.All-in-all, this is somewhat like the traffic accident.

281243,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6301969588,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[12, 13]","Tod Browning, a former circus performer, displayed his vision when he directed Freaks in the early 30s, which was soon banned after its release in the United States.  The moral message of the film was apparently too much for the MPPA and The Catholic Legion of Decency in the 30s.  Freaks received cult status after it was banned and it was not allowed to be shown for decades.  However, Browning's Freaks received the honors it deserved when the National Film Registry decided to add it to it's archives in 1994.A small traveling circus has several performances by people with congenital birth defects of the most severe kind.  These men and women go through ruthless exploitation as people are attracted to these shows through their curiosity which is enhanced by imagination and tales.  One of these character's story is told as it surrounds a young prince of extremely short stature and a beautiful trapeze artist as they join in a treacherous love story.  This love story depicts the truth behind the truly grotesque as human behaviors and human appearances collide.Freaks is a brilliant film with a strong moral message, which should be pondered for as long as repugnant human behavior exists.  This means that Freaks has a timeless message that can measure up to any film made in our current society.  Ultimately, Freaks offers the audience an excellent cinematic event as the deformed characters chant, ""we accept her...one of us"".",5,Browning's Banned Cult Film - A True Character Study,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,1439,"['Tod', 'Browning', 'former', 'circus', 'performer', 'displayed', 'vision', 'when', 'directed', 'Freaks', 'early', '30s', 'was', 'soon', 'banned', 'release', 'United', 'States', 'moral', 'message', 'film', 'was', 'apparently', 'too', 'much', 'MPPA', 'Catholic', 'Legion', 'Decency', '30s', 'Freaks', 'received', 'cult', 'status', 'was', 'banned', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'be', 'shown', 'decades', 'However', 'Browning', 'Freaks', 'received', 'honors', 'deserved', 'when', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'decided', 'add', 'archives', '1994.A', 'small', 'traveling', 'circus', 'several', 'performances', 'people', 'congenital', 'birth', 'defects', 'most', 'severe', 'kind', 'men', 'women', 'go', 'ruthless', 'exploitation', 'people', 'are', 'attracted', 'shows', 'curiosity', 'enhanced', 'imagination', 'tales', 'One', 'character', 'story', 'told', 'young', 'prince', 'extremely', 'short', 'stature', 'beautiful', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'join', 'treacherous', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'story', 'truth', 'truly', 'grotesque', 'human', 'behaviors', 'human', 'appearances', 'collide.Freaks', 'brilliant', 'film', 'strong', 'moral', 'message', 'should', 'be', 'pondered', 'as', 'long', 'repugnant', 'human', 'behavior', 'exists', 'Freaks', 'timeless', 'message', 'can', 'measure', 'up', 'film', 'made', 'current', 'society', 'Ultimately', 'Freaks', 'audience', 'excellent', 'cinematic', 'event', 'deformed', 'characters', 'chant', 'accept', 'one']",N/A
281244,A2ICI500LRO01K,6301969588,Kyle Wells,"[6, 6]","Just what is it that makes a film a `cult-classic'? Why is it that a film such as ""Frankenstein"" can be declared a `classic,' while at the same time its, admittedly dissimilar, sequel ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" will forever be relegated to `cult-classic' status? The term `cult' suggests a limited but devoted fan base, but I believe that the term goes beyond this definition, if only for the reason that many cult-classics are decidedly more popular than several films decreed as classics (see Frankenstein example). Ultimately, the categorization of `cult-classic' is one of genre, dictating less the popularity of a film than certain aesthetic and narrative characteristics. Classic films are typically perceived as highly polished, rigidly acted studio affairs, whereas the cult film could be described as the slightly disturbed, often rough and unruly, step-sibling of the `classic' film. Cult-classics are usually strikingly amateur in quality, often poorly filmed on bad stock, hosting a cast of unknown actors, and driven by unusual plots and campy humour. It is often the amateurish quality of the film that is, whether intended or not, ultimately the appeal. Often the `cult-classic' is a film we enjoy at, rather than with, if you get my meaning.""Freaks"" is without a doubt a `cult-classic.' Its plot is unlike anything you would see in an `A' picture, its actors far from the usual Hollywood fare, and its technical achievements of a decidedly low grade. And yet the film is unabashed in its intentions and ultimately highly enjoyable in a good many ways. The movie is about a traveling circus and the troupe of `freaks' that are exhibited as its side-show attraction. These `freaks' are the stars of the film, and consist of people born with various abnormalities and deformities that today would be more likely politely ignored than gawked at. The story consists of one of the `normal' members of the circus, the acrobat Cleopatra, pretending to court and fall in love with one of the `freaks,' a little person named Hans, in order to gouge him for money. Cleopatra eventually marries Hans, upon learning of a secret fortune in his possession, but proceeds to spill the beans of her plot on their wedding night, and consequently incurs the wrath of Han's fellow freaks.The plot is not especially important and the first half of the film has honestly little to offer, aside from the display of the film's unique cast of characters. It is the latter portion of the film, wherein the freaks turn dark and menacing, that earns the film its cult-classic status. As to whether this segment is empowering, in the way director Tod Browning has his `freaks' rise up against their truly deformed oppressors, or exploitative, in its use of physically deformed people as creatures of horror, I have no answer. Once crossed, however, the exploited yet content freaks of the first half of the film turn into night-stalkers and shadowed foes worthy of any horror film. The cinematography takes on a new force at this point also, providing shots of the `freaks' creeping through rain-soaked darkness, exacting vengeance, that are among the most chilling I have seen. Again the `correctness' of this segment will pray on the minds of many viewers I am sure, but with that put aside (although a complete dismissal may not be appropriate) one can both route for and fear these pitied men, these `freaks,' who despite their own misfortunes in life have still a way to defend their own and to exact revenge against those who mock and abuse them.One thing that makes a cult-classic often so great is its complete lack of desire to be a classic. Films such as ""Freaks"" were never made to win Oscars, or even particularly large audiences, but they were made with the intention of shocking or disturbing the living hell out of the audiences they could find. And the best among them, the true cult-classics, of which ""Freaks"" is surely an example, continue to disturb, shock, and ultimately delight a similar minority of viewers to this day.",4,A Classic Cult-Classic,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,4030,"['Just', 'what', 'film', 'cult-classic', 'Why', 'film', 'such', 'Frankenstein', 'can', 'be', 'declared', 'classic', 'same', 'time', 'admittedly', 'dissimilar', 'sequel', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'relegated', 'cult-classic', 'status', 'term', 'cult', 'limited', 'devoted', 'fan', 'base', 'believe', 'term', 'definition', 'only', 'reason', 'many', 'cult-classics', 'are', 'decidedly', 'more', 'popular', 'several', 'films', 'decreed', 'classics', 'see', 'Frankenstein', 'example', 'Ultimately', 'categorization', 'cult-classic', 'one', 'genre', 'dictating', 'less', 'popularity', 'film', 'certain', 'aesthetic', 'narrative', 'characteristics', 'Classic', 'films', 'are', 'typically', 'perceived', 'highly', 'polished', 'rigidly', 'acted', 'studio', 'affairs', 'cult', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'slightly', 'disturbed', 'often', 'rough', 'unruly', 'step-sibling', 'classic', 'film', 'Cult-classics', 'are', 'usually', 'strikingly', 'amateur', 'quality', 'often', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'bad', 'stock', 'hosting', 'cast', 'unknown', 'actors', 'driven', 'unusual', 'plots', 'campy', 'humour', 'often', 'amateurish', 'quality', 'film', 'intended', 'not', 'ultimately', 'appeal', 'cult-classic', 'film', 'enjoy', 'rather', 'get', 'meaning', 'Freaks', 'doubt', 'cult-classic', 'plot', 'anything', 'would', 'see', 'A', 'picture', 'actors', 'far', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'technical', 'achievements', 'decidedly', 'low', 'grade', 'yet', 'film', 'unabashed', 'intentions', 'ultimately', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'traveling', 'circus', 'troupe', 'freaks', 'are', 'exhibited', 'side-show', 'attraction', 'freaks', 'are', 'stars', 'film', 'consist', 'people', 'born', 'various', 'abnormalities', 'deformities', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'politely', 'ignored', 'gawked', 'story', 'one', 'normal', 'members', 'circus', 'acrobat', 'Cleopatra', 'pretending', 'court', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'freaks', 'little', 'person', 'named', 'Hans', 'order', 'gouge', 'money', 'Cleopatra', 'eventually', 'Hans', 'learning', 'secret', 'fortune', 'possession', 'proceeds', 'spill', 'beans', 'plot', 'wedding', 'night', 'consequently', 'wrath', 'Han', 'fellow', 'freaks.The', 'plot', 'not', 'especially', 'important', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'honestly', 'little', 'offer', 'aside', 'display', 'film', 'unique', 'cast', 'characters', 'latter', 'portion', 'film', 'wherein', 'freaks', 'turn', 'dark', 'menacing', 'film', 'cult-classic', 'status', 'segment', 'empowering', 'way', 'director', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'freaks', 'rise', 'up', 'truly', 'deformed', 'oppressors', 'exploitative', 'use', 'physically', 'deformed', 'people', 'creatures', 'horror', 'have', 'answer', 'Once', 'crossed', 'however', 'exploited', 'yet', 'content', 'freaks', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'turn', 'night-stalkers', 'shadowed', 'foes', 'worthy', 'horror', 'film', 'cinematography', 'new', 'force', 'point', 'also', 'providing', 'shots', 'freaks', 'creeping', 'rain-soaked', 'darkness', 'exacting', 'vengeance', 'are', 'most', 'chilling', 'have', 'seen', 'Again', 'correctness', 'segment', 'will', 'pray', 'minds', 'many', 'viewers', 'am', 'sure', 'put', 'aside', 'complete', 'dismissal', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'appropriate', 'one', 'can', 'route', 'fear', 'pitied', 'men', 'freaks', 'who', 'own', 'misfortunes', 'life', 'have', 'still', 'way', 'defend', 'own', 'exact', 'revenge', 'who', 'mock', 'abuse', 'them.One', 'thing', 'cult-classic', 'often', 'so', 'great', 'complete', 'lack', 'desire', 'be', 'classic', 'Films', 'such', 'Freaks', 'were', 'never', 'made', 'win', 'Oscars', 'even', 'particularly', 'large', 'audiences', 'were', 'made', 'intention', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'living', 'hell', 'audiences', 'could', 'find', 'best', 'true', 'cult-classics', 'Freaks', 'surely', 'example', 'continue', 'disturb', 'shock', 'ultimately', 'delight', 'similar', 'minority', 'viewers', 'day']",N/A

281246,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6301969588,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 15]","For years I had heard about the legendary Tod Browning film &quot;Freaks&quot; that so upset audiences it was banned in Boston and Great Britain. I had read the short story &quot;Spurs&quot; on which it was based and when the film was finally screened on campus I talked my roommate into going with me. Most of the people sitting around us knew nothing about the film and when I told them about it everybody started to get nervous. Then the film began...and we all loved it! My roommate and I both had crushes on Daisy Earles who plays Frieda in the film, opposite her brother Harry as Hans (for years I thought they were really husband and wife; my mistake).The story is quite simple: Hans and Frieda are a pair of midgets in love, but Hans thinks that Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) the bareback rider is beautiful. Cleopatra plays with Hans' affections until she learns he has money. Over the objections of her boyfriend, Hercules (Henry Victor) the freak show strongman, she accepts Hans' proposal. During the wedding feast when the freaks accept her into their ranks, she makes it clear how much she despises them all. But when Hans starts to become ill because of the poison she is feeding him, the freaks decide it is time to take matters into their own hands. The film's climax, when the freaks chase Cleopatra and Hercules during a rainstorm, is truly chilling, although Cleopatra's final fate is as unreal as it is ironic and was supposed to be even worse. But the scene of Hercules singing soprano in Madame Tetralini's new sideshow because he had been castrated was found to be too intense for early audiences and was cut.All Browning really did to terrify audience was to include real freaks in his film, such as Daisy and Violet Hilton the Siamese Twins, Schlitze the Pinhead Girl, Josephine Joseph the Half-Woman/Half-Man, Johnny Eck the Half Boy, Frances O'Connor the Turtle Girl, Peter Robinson the Living Human Skeleton, Olga Roderick the Bearded Lady, Koo Koo the Bird Girl, Martha Morris the Armless Wonder, and Randion the Living Torso, who rolls his own cigarettes despite having neither arms nor legs. The original short story &quot;Spurs&quot; by Tod Robbins had a midget falling for a bareback rider who marries him for his money and at their wedding feast puts her husband on her shoulders and boasts that she will carry him across France. With the aid of his large, angry dog he forces her to do just that. Browning's film expands the scope of the story into something more complex and much more satisfying.However, the film clearly portrays the &quot;Freaks&quot; with dignity. As Madame Tetrallini (Rose Dione) tells someone, &quot;These are all God's children.&quot; The true monsters in this film are the &quot;normal&quot; human beings, who receive their just desserts. But when &quot;Freaks&quot; was relased it was banned in the United Kingdom for thirty years (and is still banned in Sweden). During that period Browning was blackballed in Hollywood. He had promised MGM the ultimate scary movie and given the reaction you have to conclude that he delivered. The film was originally intended to have what we would now consider an A-List cast with Victor McLaglen as Hercules, Myrna Loy as Cleopatra, and Jean Harlow as Venus. However, all of the stars reportedly balked at the prospect being in a film with &quot;sideshow exhibitions.&quot;This 1932 film is clearly Browning's best film, vastly superior to the more famous &quot;Dracula,&quot; which, after all, was basically a filmed stage play for the most part. It is not even close. You might screen this film for the first time because of its reputation, but you will watch it again because it is a pretty good film, especially given the time at which it was made.",5,"Banned in Boston, &quot;Freaks&quot; is Tod Browning's best film",1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,3750,"['years', 'had', 'heard', 'legendary', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'film', 'quot', 'Freaks', 'quot', 'so', 'upset', 'audiences', 'was', 'banned', 'Boston', 'Great', 'Britain', 'had', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'quot', 'Spurs', 'quot', 'was', 'based', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'finally', 'screened', 'campus', 'talked', 'roommate', 'going', 'Most', 'people', 'sitting', 'knew', 'nothing', 'film', 'when', 'told', 'everybody', 'started', 'get', 'nervous', 'Then', 'film', 'began', 'loved', 'My', 'roommate', 'had', 'crushes', 'Daisy', 'Earles', 'who', 'Frieda', 'film', 'brother', 'Harry', 'Hans', 'years', 'thought', 'were', 'really', 'husband', 'wife', 'mistake', '.The', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'Hans', 'Frieda', 'are', 'pair', 'midgets', 'love', 'Hans', 'Cleopatra', 'Olga', 'Baclanova', 'bareback', 'rider', 'beautiful', 'Cleopatra', 'Hans', 'affections', 'money', 'objections', 'boyfriend', 'Hercules', 'Henry', 'Victor', 'freak', 'show', 'strongman', 'Hans', 'proposal', 'wedding', 'feast', 'when', 'freaks', 'accept', 'ranks', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'when', 'Hans', 'become', 'ill', 'poison', 'feeding', 'freaks', 'decide', 'time', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'film', 'climax', 'when', 'freaks', 'chase', 'Cleopatra', 'Hercules', 'rainstorm', 'truly', 'chilling', 'Cleopatra', 'final', 'fate', 'as', 'unreal', 'ironic', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'scene', 'Hercules', 'singing', 'soprano', 'Madame', 'Tetralini', 'new', 'sideshow', 'had', 'been', 'castrated', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'early', 'audiences', 'was', 'cut.All', 'Browning', 'really', 'did', 'terrify', 'audience', 'was', 'include', 'real', 'freaks', 'film', 'such', 'Daisy', 'Violet', 'Hilton', 'Siamese', 'Twins', 'Schlitze', 'Pinhead', 'Girl', 'Josephine', 'Joseph', 'Half-Woman/Half-Man', 'Johnny', 'Eck', 'Half', 'Boy', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'Turtle', 'Girl', 'Peter', 'Robinson', 'Living', 'Human', 'Skeleton', 'Olga', 'Roderick', 'Bearded', 'Lady', 'Koo', 'Koo', 'Bird', 'Girl', 'Martha', 'Morris', 'Armless', 'Wonder', 'Randion', 'Living', 'Torso', 'who', 'own', 'cigarettes', 'having', 'arms', 'legs', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'quot', 'Spurs', 'quot', 'Tod', 'Robbins', 'had', 'midget', 'falling', 'bareback', 'rider', 'who', 'money', 'wedding', 'feast', 'husband', 'shoulders', 'will', 'carry', 'France', 'aid', 'large', 'angry', 'dog', 'do', 'just', 'Browning', 'film', 'scope', 'story', 'something', 'more', 'complex', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying.However', 'film', 'clearly', 'quot', 'Freaks', 'quot', 'dignity', 'Madame', 'Tetrallini', 'Rose', 'Dione', 'someone', 'quot', 'are', 'God', 'children.', 'quot', 'true', 'monsters', 'film', 'are', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'receive', 'just', 'desserts', 'when', 'quot', 'Freaks', 'quot', 'was', 'relased', 'was', 'banned', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'thirty', 'years', 'still', 'banned', 'Sweden', 'period', 'Browning', 'was', 'blackballed', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'promised', 'MGM', 'ultimate', 'scary', 'movie', 'given', 'reaction', 'have', 'conclude', 'delivered', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'have', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'consider', 'A-List', 'cast', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Hercules', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Cleopatra', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'Venus', 'However', 'stars', 'reportedly', 'balked', 'prospect', 'being', 'film', 'quot', 'exhibitions.', 'quot', '1932', 'film', 'clearly', 'Browning', 'best', 'film', 'vastly', 'superior', 'more', 'famous', 'quot', 'Dracula', 'quot', 'was', 'basically', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'might', 'screen', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'reputation', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'especially', 'given', 'time', 'was', 'made']",N/A

After too long a time, I finally watched it.I was stunned. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The writing, scenes, characters, and plot are mind-blowing. Even my 14 year old step-son was enamored with the film. It was brilliant.The characters were charming, humorous, cold, loving, etc.What really hit me was the fact that the movie was not accepted by society and that it was concidered the most 'horrific' movie at the time, which led to it being pulled from the few screens it was playing on. Three decades later - yes, thirty YEARS - the 'freak-out' phase in American society rediscovered the film and it had some success as an underground film.Amazingly, it wasn't until 1994 that the National Film Registry put the film in its archive of cinematic treasures. That's 62 years. A lot of people lived and died durring those years. That is a long time to gain recognition.This gives me hope, however.

Yes, the severe editing leaves many unanswered questions and the happy ending should have involved the ""freak"" troupe rather than the sugary focus on main characters.  Still, it is a movie that is hard to look away from.  Some would say fascinating and others would say a train wreck but it keeps my attention either way.Having watched this a couple of times with others, I am impressed with the fact that many get quickly bored and seek other entertainment (that is, walk out of the room).  The movie does start out very slowly.  In addition, several of the actors speak in a tinny voice that is difficult if not impossible to understand.  You can buy the script online for around $20 bucks if you are really interested in all of the dialogue.  I prefer to save the $20 and guess.My favorite characters are Henry Earles and Schlitze.  If you don't love these two guys, then you simply don't posses a heart.  Henry and his sister Daisy of course went on to appear in the Wizard of Oz as munchkins.This is a simple morality play with a simplified script.  It is always listed as a horror show but we know better. As previously noted, it has been alleged that most of the great scenes were clipped from the movie.  Too bad.  Nevertheless, the remaining scenes are still classic and everyone should take a turn at viewing this.  Maybe it is your cup or tea or maybe not.

Rather than use normal actors to remake unusual people with the help of makeup and costumes, Browning hired a cast of ""little people"" (called midgets, dwarfs in the film) as well as other physically and mentally ""challenged"" (deformed and worse in the movie) actors.  There are a couple full sized actors as well.I recognized long time character actor Wallace Ford in a leading role.

He marries the beautiful and unscrupulous Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) who is of normal size.Hans (Earles) runs the circus and is evidently financially loaded.  What makes the movie different and controversial is the cast of unusual accomplices.  For example, conjoined twins, a bearded lady, a skeleton man and an assortment of people without various limbs.  One guy is a dwarf with no arms or legs but gets from place to place by crawling on the ground similar to our reptilian friends.

281265,A3HI2HBUS8MITB,6301969588,Patrick Hall,"[2, 2]","FREAKSOne of the most unique films ever to be produced was Freaks.  It is quite possible that no other film in the history of horror provoked as much controversy as did Freaks.  It was cut to sheds by the studio, banned from many theaters, thrown into obscurity for decades, and was the catalyst for ending director Todd Browning's career.  Yet, the movie has not one monster, or murderer, or drop of blood.  No paranormal activities or demonic possession.  Instead, Browning cast real freaks in his movie side by side with supposedly normal people in what is a masterpiece of horror.The film takes place among the inhabitants of a carnival, particularly Hans and Frieda.  These two lovebirds are the star midgets of the carnival, but another star, beautiful Cleopatra--a big person--is after Hans' money and seduces him with the intention of acquiring some of that money.  When Cleopatra learns Hans' fortune is extremely vast, she devises a plan to marry and then poison Hans.The story is interesting, but the real story is with the freaks.  They are a varied group including a bearded lady, Siamese twins, human torsos lacking limbs, microcephalics, and more.  Society sees these people as freaks, invalids, mental defectives, better to be locked away from the eyes of good, honest citizens than allowed to travel freely.  Indeed, this attitude is the cause that has bound the freaks together into their own tightly knit community.  The outside world shuns and degrades them, and so, they have created their own society, one where loyalty, cooperation, and fraternity are of absolute importance.Even within the circus the freaks are ridiculed and taunted by most of the normal members.  Nobody takes them seriously and the freaks are frequently abused verbally.  The freaks take these injuries with a grain of salt.  They even make an exception and declare their intentions to accept Cleopatra as one of them when she weds Hans in the wedding feast scene that is easily the best part of the entire movie.  But when things go badly and Hans becomes ill, the freaks go into high gear.  They establish a surveillance of Hans and Cleo, and when their suspicions about her intentions turn true, they quickly go into action to protect Hans and punish Cleo and her lover, the strongman Hercules.Besides the fascinating scenes that showcase the individual freaks in the movie, scenes that explore not just the physical deformities they posses, there are also many scenes that spotlight the freaks special abilities and normalcies.  We see how Prince Randian, born without arms or legs, lights a cigarette.  Lacking arms doesn't stop one from eating and drinking just as one with arms would.  All enjoy lives that are considerably more normal than most.  Perhaps even more delightful is just how kind and helpful the freaks are to each other.The point the film makes is terrific.  The freaks display more human attributes than the normal folks of the circus.  Despite their limitations, they band together to fight back against Cleopatra and Hercules in order to protect Hans and enact revenge against these two despicable individuals.  By the end, the passive, almost laughable freaks transform into strong, fearsome beings.  Do not take them for granted, for once crossed, the freaks will exact terrible revenge.It sounds silly, but Freaks really got people going when it was released.  The film was cut from 90 minutes to 60.  Mot of the footage is lost, including the finale that was particularly gruesome.  People cringed when they saw this film.

The plot resembles an evil Gulliver attacking Lilliput and the Lilliputians win.  The film exploits the circus performers' deformities, and the deformed circus performers' group cohesiveness is the film's plot.  This classic film never has been remade.Historically the United States' strength has been that it was a 'melting pot' -- diverse peoples immigrated to the United States to become citizens of a prosperous and united country.  Recently the United States increasingly is a collection of societal groups defined by ethnicity, gender, religion and age.  Personal and family history are a strong and important foundation for personal development, but dissension among societal groups weakens United States' society.I believe that increased energy costs, security issues, and possibly epidemiological concerns will make future travel and mobility within the United States more expensive and less convenient.  Less travel and mobility will make United States' society increasingly regional, parochial and stagnant.  Less travel and mobility will make *devisive* regional and group identities (and contention for resources) increasingly important.  Nationwide broadcast entertainment will counter this devisive trend somewhat, but I believe the overall result will be further weakening of United States' society.",3,An exploitive classic film,1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,1418,"['Director', 'Tod', 'Browning', '1932', 'film', 'Freaks', 'centers', 'lives', 'actual', 'deformed', 'circus', 'performers', 'plot', 'evil', 'Gulliver', 'attacking', 'Lilliput', 'Lilliputians', 'win', 'film', 'circus', 'performers', 'deformities', 'deformed', 'circus', 'performers', 'group', 'cohesiveness', 'film', 'plot', 'classic', 'film', 'never', 'been', 'remade.Historically', 'United', 'States', 'strength', 'been', 'was', ""'melting"", 'pot', 'diverse', 'peoples', 'immigrated', 'United', 'States', 'become', 'citizens', 'prosperous', 'united', 'country', 'Recently', 'United', 'States', 'increasingly', 'collection', 'societal', 'groups', 'defined', 'ethnicity', 'gender', 'religion', 'age', 'Personal', 'family', 'history', 'are', 'strong', 'important', 'foundation', 'personal', 'development', 'dissension', 'societal', 'groups', 'weakens', 'United', 'States', 'society.I', 'believe', 'increased', 'energy', 'costs', 'security', 'issues', 'possibly', 'epidemiological', 'concerns', 'will', 'make', 'future', 'travel', 'mobility', 'United', 'States', 'more', 'expensive', 'less', 'convenient', 'Less', 'travel', 'mobility', 'will', 'make', 'United', 'States', 'society', 'increasingly', 'regional', 'parochial', 'stagnant', 'Less', 'travel', 'mobility', 'will', 'make', '*devisive*', 'regional', 'group', 'identities', 'contention', 'resources', 'increasingly', 'important', 'Nationwide', 'broadcast', 'entertainment', 'will', 'counter', 'devisive', 'trend', 'somewhat', 'believe', 'overall', 'result', 'will', 'be', 'further', 'weakening', 'United', 'States', 'society']",N/A

281272,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6301969588,Robert Badgley,"[4, 12]","Freaks,released in February 1932,was and is a title that says as much about itself as it does about its' subject matter.It was a curiosity then and remains so to this day.Judged on its' merits as a film,and all that that implies,it comes up far short of its'intended goals.Browning had previously worked with Lon Chaney who was THE master of grotesquery in his characterizations.He also had directed the horror hit Dracula the year previously.Mix this with the so called ""Great Depression"" and the studios desperation to keep their heads above water and looking for new ideas to intice patrons into the theatres,and you have the movie Freaks.The movies' centrepiece is two midgets,Hans and Frieda(Harry and Daisy Earles-real life brother and sister).Both are part of the ""freak"" section of the circus performers and are engaged to be married.Enter trapeze artist Cleopatra(Olga Baclanova)who catches the eye of little Hans.She humours and eggs him on by flirting openly with him,much to Frieda's chagrin and embarrassement.Cleopatra however goes for the circus strongman Hercules(Henry Victor) and they both take great delight in humiliating Hans and the other ""freaks"" frequently.When Cleopatra learns that Hans has alot of money she talks him into marrying her.Frieda tries to tell Hans it's a sham,but he won't listen and goes ahead with the marriage.During a reception it becomes apparent to Hans things aren't what they should be when Hercules kisses Cleopatra openly.And when the ""freaks"" in attendance chant that they ""accept her""(Cleopatra),she becomes enraged at the thought and tells them to take a hike.During the reception she had slipped a poison into Hans drink-starting early to get rid of him and collect on his money.She carries him back to the wagon and a doctor is summoned,as she feigns innocence.She convinces the doctor but the spurned""freaks"" are getting wise to the situation and keep a close watch.Sure enough when Cleopatra is alone she slips poison into Hans medicine.Hans however has gotten wise himself and spits out each dose when Cleo isn't looking.Hans has had it and decides,along with his friends,to take care of cheating/murdering Cleopatra and Hercules.When Hercules goes after his ex girlfriend Venus,who threatened to take what she knew about the two of them to the police,the ""freaks"" are right there.On a rain soaked,mud filled ground Hercules tries to crawl away with a knife in his side from the approaching threat,but he is eventually overtaken.At the same time Cleopatra runs screaming into the night from her wagon only to be followed by more ""freaks"",who get their woman.The movie ends as it had begun,with people standing around a large square enclosure,inside which is the former Cleopatra,now a ""freak"" and a much deformed ""duck woman"".This slight tale of revenge was banned in a few countries around the world due to its' graphic and exploitative subject matter.It was released ,pulled,re-released again and again(parred down),but it still received terrible reviews and bombed at the box office.Actual circus performers(""freaks"") as you can see were ""used"" heavily in the movie for authenticity.You have pinheads,a half woman-half man,more than one armless woman,siamese twins,the living torso,bird girl,a dwarf,a legless dwarf,and several others.What brings the movie down isn't so much the obviously contrived script of righting a wrong but the poor acting involved.Most of the ""freaks"" did fairly well all things considered,but Olga Baclanova as Cleo and her brutish boyfriend Hercules played by Henry Victor,troll for new depths in bad acting.Olga plays it way,way over the top and Victor comes along to push down them both down the slippery slope on the other side.You actually wonder what took them so long to do them in! On the other side of the coin is Venus(Leila Hyams) and Phroso(Wallace Ford),who save the film from total oblivion.Rose Dione as Madame Tetrallini also manages to make the most of her on screen time.Sure one feels an empathy towards these men and women,the underbelly of the circus world,but it is an empathy that Browning unnecessarily pounds home.Not only does he show fellow ""normal"" circus perfomers shunning them(not generally the case in real life)just to achieve a modicum of a plot,the re-issue prologue REALLY pounds home the sympathy message by its' sermonization.At the end of the day however there just is not enough good to overcome the bad in this film.It was a brave experiment on Browning's and MGM's parts,but it didn't come off.As you know the film we see today is a cut down version of the original.Unless some archive somewhere turns up a longer copy,this is the film posterity will be left with.Having said that though,I do not believe this film would have been helped by the extra footage.I think it would just have prolonged the agony and possibly made it even worse than what we have today.The film was revived some 30 years or more ago by a film enthusiast and caught on with other film devotees due to its' unsual subject matter,which caused MGM to eventually rustle through its' holdings,dig it out and dust off its' copies.It was re-released On VHS in 1990 and now it is on DVD.The DVD's print here is of good quality and sound.The sound in fact has been improved since its' 1990 release on tape.You can now understand most of the dialogue,though some spoken by the circus performers are still a little hard to catch.This release contains three alternate endings to the film,a re-issue prologue,a commentary and two featurettes,one on Tod Browning and one on the movie itself.In conclusion Freaks,an interesting curiosity-yes;an experiment not fulfilled or succesful-yes.An example of good film making?....definitely not.",2,"A curiosity in the history

281273,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301969588,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 6]","Freaks (Tod Browning, 1932)While Tod Browning directed sixty-two films, from the early days of silent movies until the beginning of World War II, the vast majority of filmgoers (even of the snob variety) remember Browning solely for Freaks, his groundbreaking 1932 picture about carnival life. (Browning also directed Lugosi's Dracula and Chaney in a number of films, but the stars tended to eclipse the director in those cases.)The plot of the film is one of the mothers of all urban legends: a ""normal"" woman, Cleopatra the trapeze artist (Olga Baclanova) romances a sideshow performer, Hans the midget (Harry Earles) away from his fiancee, fellow midget Freida (Harry's real-life sister, Daisy), in order to get his inheritance so she and her real love, Hercules (Henry Victor) can run off and live like king and queen. This, needless to say, disquiets the sideshow pooulace, who get revenge on Cleopatra in a rather unique way. The plot is also, as should be obvious, quite thin and silly. The acting, in many cases, is atrocious, aside from a few Hollywood veterans, notably Henry Victor and Roscoe Ates, both of whom were quite well-known in their day (Victor was the lead in the 1916 production of The Picture of Dorian Gray; Ates was a character actor with a resume that encompassed such films as Gone with the Wind, The Champ, King Kong, and the 1933 live-action version of Alice in Wonderland). In other words, if you're looking for your basic Hollywood blockbuster, you're going to be disappointed.What makes Freaks (based on Clarence Robbins' novel _Spurs_) a classic is that Browning cast actual sideshow performers in many roles, and then handed them a script that treated them as human beings rather than freaks; the beauty of the movie's title is in its irony (something missed by many over the years who would have had the film banned). Browning's movie should have ushered in a new era of tolerance and recognition that so-called accidents of birth are human, too; unfortunately, more recent exploitation flicks like _Freaks Uncensored!_ (1999) and the ever-popular Mondo Cane series (made between 1962 and 1988) provide pretty solid evidence that such is not the case. (It is another sad irony that the cast list for Freaks Uncensored! contains many of the same names as does Browning's film.) Still, Browning is certainly to be commended for trying, at least, and his amusing little peccadillo is certainly worth going out of your way to watch a time or two. **** 1/2",4,Too many comtemporary critics missed the irony.,1004918400,"11 5, 2001",2001,2487,"['Freaks', 'Tod', 'Browning', '1932', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'directed', 'sixty-two', 'films', 'early', 'days', 'silent', 'movies', 'beginning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'vast', 'majority', 'filmgoers', 'even', 'snob', 'variety', 'remember', 'Browning', 'solely', 'Freaks', 'groundbreaking', '1932', 'picture', 'carnival', 'life', 'Browning', 'also', 'directed', 'Lugosi', 'Dracula', 'Chaney', 'number', 'films', 'stars', 'tended', 'eclipse', 'director', 'cases', 'plot', 'film', 'one', 'mothers', 'urban', 'legends', 'normal', 'woman', 'Cleopatra', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'Olga', 'Baclanova', 'sideshow', 'performer', 'midget', 'Harry', 'Earles', 'away', 'fiancee', 'fellow', 'midget', 'Freida', 'Harry', 'real-life', 'sister', 'Daisy', 'order', 'get', 'inheritance', 'real', 'love', 'Hercules', 'Henry', 'Victor', 'can', 'run', 'off', 'live', 'king', 'queen', 'needless', 'say', 'sideshow', 'pooulace', 'who', 'get', 'revenge', 'Cleopatra', 'rather', 'unique', 'way', 'plot', 'also', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'quite', 'thin', 'silly', 'acting', 'many', 'cases', 'atrocious', 'aside', 'few', 'Hollywood', 'veterans', 'notably', 'Henry', 'Victor', 'Roscoe', 'Ates', 'whom', 'were', 'quite', 'well-known', 'day', 'Victor', 'was', 'lead', '1916', 'production', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Ates', 'was', 'character', 'actor', 'resume', 'encompassed', 'such', 'films', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Champ', 'King', 'Kong', '1933', 'live-action', 'version', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'other', 'words', ""'re"", 'looking', 'basic', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed.What', 'Freaks', 'based', 'Clarence', 'Robbins', 'novel', '_Spurs_', 'classic', 'Browning', 'cast', 'actual', 'sideshow', 'performers', 'many', 'roles', 'then', 'handed', 'script', 'treated', 'human', 'beings', 'rather', 'freaks', 'beauty', 'movie', 'title', 'irony', 'something', 'missed', 'many', 'years', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'film', 'banned', 'Browning', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'ushered', 'new', 'era', 'tolerance', 'recognition', 'so-called', 'accidents', 'birth', 'are', 'human', 'too', 'unfortunately', 'more', 'recent', 'exploitation', 'flicks', '_Freaks', 'Uncensored', '_', '1999', 'ever-popular', 'Mondo', 'Cane', 'series', 'made', '1962', '1988', 'provide', 'pretty', 'solid', 'evidence', 'such', 'not', 'case', 'sad', 'irony', 'cast', 'list', 'Freaks', 'Uncensored', 'many', 'same', 'names', 'Browning', 'film', 'Still', 'Browning', 'certainly', 'be', 'commended', 'trying', 'least', 'amusing', 'little', 'peccadillo', 'certainly', 'worth', 'going', 'way', 'watch', 'time', 'two', '****', '1/2']",N/A

But Freaks is much like any other movie with the goal of telling a mostly normal soap-opera-like story set in a circus environment. There are moments of lightness and drama. The film's most distinguishing characteristic is that the actors are circus freaks. Some of them are very strange to watch, many note the pinheads but the one that most fascinated me was an astoundingly agile boy with no legs. The story is about a beautiful trapeze artist who takes advantage of the affections of a wealthy circus midget and marries him as a ploy to inherit his wealth. The featured shocking conclusion is much more silly than jaw dropping but the rest of the film is pretty entertaining and fascinating to watch.

281276,A6FIAB28IS79,6301969588,Samuel Chell,"[9, 13]","Once a banned and controversial movie, now a cult classic, ""Freaks"" is misleadingly categorized as a ""horror"" film.  As a result, the average horror consumer is apt to be disappointed that watching the film today is anything but a scary experience.  On the other hand, the sensitive viewer is apt to discover that recognizing one's own commonality with ""freaks"" is far more rewarding than being repulsed or shocked by one's difference from them.Browning's film remains relevant because, unlike the carnival freak shows of the past or the Maury Povich-Jerry Springer television shows of the politically correct present, it makes no concessions to its subjects' abnormalities and deformities.  With the exception of the didactic, preachy written preface that the studio felt compelled to attach to later releases of the film, the camera represents freaks as ordinary human beings, not as unusual specimens.I see that the reviews appear to fall into two categories: 1. ""Freaks"" humanizes these marginalized and exploited human beings; 2. ""Freaks"" scares us to the degree that the revenge of the freaks takes on violence and mutilation beyond our expectations. How about a third possibiliity? The film is disturbing because it uses these little, practically invisible and therefore inconsequential, deformed creatures to expose the blindness, selfishness, and pride that deform ""normal"" human beings. (It's a paradox that would have been loved by Flannery O'Connor who, in ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find,"" uses a serial killer to expose the even greater evil of a foolish and ""proper"" old grandmother.)In fact, the narrative frame of the film lets the viewer in on the the film's ""real"" freak show--the once-beautiful trapeze artist who becomes deformed in proportion to her unwillingness to recognize the humanity she shares with freaks.  Browning's film asks us both to see freaks as human beings like ourselves and, even more importantly, to look to our own deformities.  The idea is not to take comfort in our difference from freaks but to ponder our similarity with them.  Any time we use someone else's bad fortune as a measure against which to compare our own good fortune, we blaspheme God's creation and deform our own souls.It's important to notice that the freaks are not shown as the victims of an exploitive society--the managers of the freak show and the paying customers--but of their supposed co-workers. Whereas the lines separating normal and abnormal, freak and non-freak, those ill-served and those favored by their Creator are explicit and accepted, it's the hypocritical behavior of the strong man and trapeze artist that offends and galvanizes the community of freaks. When the trapeze lady marries a freak, then recoils at the freaks' welcoming chorus-- ""one us us""--she reveals an inhumanity going far beyond the mere voyeurism of the supporters of freak shows. Hers is the evil that Dante places below even violence and murder: the lowest circles of hell are reserved for the deceitful and fraudulent.As long as human beings practice hypocrisy, remaining ignorant of the ties that bind us to each other more than the comparatively insignificant differences that separate us from each other, we have every right to fear the revenge of the freaks. As ""normal"" but undeniably flawed and limited individuals, we would all do well to keep before ourselves the ""code of the freaks,"" endeavoring not to violate it in thought, word, or deed.Finally, it's easy to understand how Browning's film became a favorite with midnight movie audiences in the sixties and seventies.  Certainly the countercultural crowd drawn to such ""alternative"" films must have sensed more than a little kinship with the freaks on the screen.  And if that weren't enough, it is the communal bonding and determined spirit of the freaks themselves, not the intervention of ""establishment"" social-moral forces, that prevails and triumphs in the end.",5,A Thing of Beauty,1010448000,"01 8, 2002",2002,3932,"['Once', 'banned', 'controversial', 'movie', 'now', 'cult', 'classic', 'Freaks', 'misleadingly', 'categorized', 'horror', 'film', 'result', 'average', 'horror', 'consumer', 'apt', 'be', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'film', 'today', 'anything', 'scary', 'experience', 'other', 'hand', 'sensitive', 'viewer', 'apt', 'discover', 'recognizing', 'one', 'own', 'commonality', 'freaks', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding', 'being', 'repulsed', 'shocked', 'one', 'difference', 'them.Browning', 'film', 'relevant', 'carnival', 'freak', 'shows', 'past', 'Maury', 'Povich-Jerry', 'Springer', 'television', 'shows', 'politically', 'correct', 'present', 'concessions', 'subjects', 'abnormalities', 'deformities', 'exception', 'didactic', 'preachy', 'written', 'preface', 'studio', 'felt', 'compelled', 'attach', 'later', 'releases', 'film', 'camera', 'freaks', 'ordinary', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'unusual', 'specimens.I', 'see', 'reviews', 'appear', 'fall', 'two', 'categories', '1', 'Freaks', 'marginalized', 'exploited', 'human', 'beings', '2', 'Freaks', 'degree', 'revenge', 'freaks', 'violence', 'mutilation', 'expectations', 'How', 'third', 'possibiliity', 'film', 'disturbing', 'little', 'practically', 'invisible', 'therefore', 'inconsequential', 'deformed', 'creatures', 'expose', 'blindness', 'selfishness', 'pride', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'paradox', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'loved', 'Flannery', ""O'Connor"", 'who', 'A', 'Good', 'Man', 'Hard', 'Find', 'serial', 'killer', 'expose', 'even', 'greater', 'evil', 'foolish', 'proper', 'old', 'grandmother', 'fact', 'narrative', 'frame', 'film', 'viewer', 'film', 'real', 'freak', 'show', 'once-beautiful', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'who', 'deformed', 'proportion', 'unwillingness', 'recognize', 'humanity', 'shares', 'freaks', 'Browning', 'film', 'see', 'freaks', 'human', 'beings', 'ourselves', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'look', 'own', 'deformities', 'idea', 'not', 'take', 'comfort', 'difference', 'freaks', 'ponder', 'similarity', 'Any', 'time', 'use', 'someone', 'else', 'bad', 'fortune', 'measure', 'compare', 'own', 'good', 'fortune', 'blaspheme', 'God', 'creation', 'deform', 'own', 'souls.It', 'important', 'notice', 'freaks', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'victims', 'exploitive', 'society', 'managers', 'freak', 'show', 'paying', 'customers', 'supposed', 'co-workers', 'lines', 'separating', 'normal', 'abnormal', 'freak', 'non-freak', 'ill-served', 'favored', 'Creator', 'are', 'explicit', 'accepted', 'hypocritical', 'behavior', 'strong', 'man', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'community', 'freaks', 'When', 'trapeze', 'lady', 'freak', 'then', 'freaks', 'welcoming', 'chorus', 'one', 'inhumanity', 'going', 'far', 'mere', 'voyeurism', 'supporters', 'freak', 'shows', 'Hers', 'evil', 'Dante', 'even', 'violence', 'murder', 'lowest', 'circles', 'hell', 'are', 'reserved', 'deceitful', 'fraudulent.As', 'long', 'human', 'beings', 'practice', 'hypocrisy', 'remaining', 'ignorant', 'ties', 'bind', 'other', 'more', 'comparatively', 'insignificant', 'differences', 'separate', 'other', 'have', 'right', 'fear', 'revenge', 'freaks', 'normal', 'undeniably', 'flawed', 'limited', 'individuals', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'keep', 'code', 'freaks', 'endeavoring', 'not', 'violate', 'thought', 'word', 'deed.Finally', 'easy', 'understand', 'how', 'Browning', 'film', 'became', 'favorite', 'midnight', 'movie', 'audiences', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'Certainly', 'countercultural', 'crowd', 'drawn', 'such', 'alternative', 'films', 'must', 'have', 'sensed', 'more', 'little', 'kinship', 'freaks', 'screen', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'communal', 'bonding', 'determined', 'spirit', 'freaks', 'not', 'intervention', 'establishment', 'social-moral', 'forces', 'prevails', 'triumphs', 'end']",N/A

Attractions were more and more preposterous, but many of the performers in &quot;Freaks&quot; were memories of sideshows past. Sideshows were one of the few options for the severly deformed, a chance to make money while developing &quot;family&quot; ties with other sideshow performers. Politically correct it was not, but it was an alternative to life in an instititution.TLC did a two-hour program called &quot;Sideshow&quot; narrated by Jason Alexander that chronicles the history of sideshows in the United States. There is footage of &quot;Freaks&quot; that is discussed as well as interviews with many surviving sideshow attractions such as Jeanie the Half Girl.&quot;Freaks&quot; was made by Dracula director Tod Browning on a seemingly low budget. The electrical equipment on the set was so badly grounded that crew members were frequently shocked. Here are several interesting trivia tidbits surrounding the film: the film's original ending showed Hercules singing soprano in Madame Tetralini's new sideshow, but due to intense test audience reactions this scene was cut. Randion, the man with no arms or legs, developed a habit of lurking in dark corners and frightening passers-by with a blood-curdling yell. And during filming, the director was plagued with dreams in which Johnny Eck and a pinhead would keep bringing a cow in backward through a doorway in the middle of shoots.This film was so disturbing to the public that it was banned in Britain for thirty years. It went under alternate titles including &quot;Forbidden Love,&quot; &quot;The Monster Show,&quot; and &quot;Nature's Mistakes.&quot; The &quot;freaks&quot; are still just as unsettling as they must have been to the sideshow and film public in 1932: a Half-Woman Half Man, a Half Boy, The Living Human Skeleton, The Bearded Lady, the Bird Girl, the Living Torso, the Armless Wonder, Pinheads, a Bird Girl and a Turtle Girl. Some are obviously mentally impared (pinheads and the bird girl)and their uninhibited bizzare performances are even scarier than the other acts.&quot;Freaks&quot; still gives me the chills years after the first time I saw it. It is a testament to mankind's everlasting attraction to the bizarre, the scream-inducing, and the macabre. It is a remembrance of the once-booming sideshow business with its ragtag collection of &quot;human oddities.&quot; And it's a pretty creepy horror film as well. I wouldn't recommend this to young children...it is not gory or violent but the images ARE disturbing even to me.

Large crowds eagerly paid five or ten cents to witness those with birth abnormalities on stage. Directed by Tod Browning and originally released in 1932, FREAKS provides a unique peek into the goings-on of the sideshow performers after hours. Devoid of any special effects no actors were recruited to play the various freaks in this film; each performer is authentic and truly existed in real life. Understandably, this aspect startled the cinema patrons of the early 1930's and continues to cause curiosity and unease today.FREAKS speaks volumes of how society viewed those who are different from us in the past and present. The prevalence of social taboos and superstitions dictated that if a baby was born with any physical abnormality a bad omen has been delivered to the family. As highlighted in this film's introduction these children were often abandoned and ignored by society. Thankfully the advent of medical knowledge today has demonstrated how biology and genetics play a superceding role in these physical abnormalities resulting in the lifting of social taboos and superstitions and arrival of understanding.There is little doubt that FREAKS is a groundbreaking film in cinematic history and it rightly deserves its recent re-release to DVD. Admittedly its length is short at only 61 minutes but it packs a punch. This is one of the few films that warrant immediate repeat viewings.

The gold-digging Cleopatra, together with boyfriend/strongman Hercules (Henry Victor) plots to capture Hans' little heart and steal him away from fianc&eacute; Frieda (Daisy Earles).Cleopatra achieves her goal, capturing the sweet and gullible Hans into marriage, but at their wedding feast among the circus' more peculiar acts, Cleopatra becomes drunk and her malicious nature explodes.  The freaks, alerted to Cleopatra's snaky underbelly, ally themselves with Hans who has mysteriously fallen ill.Coming to Hans' aid, the circus freaks corner Cleopatra in her schemes, catching her red-handed with poison in her hand, and chase her out into a bitter rainstorm to her doom.Let's face it, the real attraction to Freaks is the abnormal conformation of the human actors involved.  Prince Randian, the Living Torso; Daisy and Violet Hilton, the Siamese Twins; Johnny Eck, the half-man; Frances O'Connor and Martha Morris, the armless girls; Peter Robinson, the Human Skeleton; Elvira and Jenny Lee Snow, the microcephalics, or ""Pinheads""; Elizabeth Green, the Bird Girl, and of course Schlitze, the happy-go-lucky ""pinhead"" who lived until 80 years of age in real life.Not being professional actors, these performances are slightly wooden, but the group works so well together that you should be able to overlook the amateur acting.  For what little Browning had to work with in regards to sets, the scenery and background was carried out quite well.  The photography is not top quality, even for 1932, but overall the film is more ""good"" than it is ""bad"".  I feel that it is an important film, especially to anyone who enjoys modern day horror.  Freaks, after all, was the birth of abnormality in horror, bringing in the human condition rather than werewolves and vampires.Once you have watched the movie, turn to the Special Features.  I do not usually tout special features on DVD's, but the ones with Freaks are must see.First is the Special Message Prologue, that should have played before the movie also.  Next, the movie with commentary by author David Skal.  Third is the best feature, called Freaks: The Sideshow Cinema.  This is an interview type commentary with author David Skal, Sideshow Performer/Historian/Author Todd Robbins, Sideshow Performer/Historian Johnny Meah, Actor and Little Person Mark Povinelli, and Actor and Little Person Jerry Maren.  This special feature is as entertaining as the movie itself, and is a ""not to be missed"" feature.  It includes segments revealing the private lives of some of the sideshow actors involved in the film.As a side note, during one of the still shots, take a look at the size of that 1930's movie camera.  It's the size of a compact car...almost!Freaks is a DVD that every horror aficionado should own, and watch more than once.  The subtleties of horror are all there in their embryonic stages, made available by presenting real flesh rather than skin bondo.  And yet, these people were portrayed as happy individuals, living a communal lifestyle inside the warm comfort of each other.  A real community, not remotely like Hillary Clinton's ""grasping at election straws"" communities.Lots to study in this piece, but lots to enjoy also.  Pop some old fashioned popcorn in oil on your gas stove, get yourself a coke and put some maraschino cherries in it, then sit back and enjoy this long lost treasure.

It is a classic cult film, as its subject matter (circus freaks) could be seen as controversial, and the mainstream audience surely wouldn't find it to be entertaining.

I think that it was not accepted at the time because of people's extremely tight morals and religious beliefs. In today's world, where people have come to their senses and have begun to enjoy life, the movie is quite tame (though still disturbing to see the many deformities of nature).

The rich man, of course, is the only one blind to the beautiful woman's duplicity, and when he finally finds out there's all heck to pay.This time around, though, the woman is a towering 5'4"", the man is a midget and his friends include the Human Torso, the Human Skeleton, and an assortment of microcephali (a.k.a. `pinheads').  Tod Browning's FREAKS (1932) started its career as a critical and box-office disaster, was resurrected in the 1960s and by the 1990s was added to the National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board in 1994. Very few movies start out so despised and end up so revered.  But then, FREAKS is like no other movie ever made.Even today, with my senses dulled beyond repair from years of exposure to outrageous special effects and incredible cgi animation - even though I've seen this movie three or four times over the years - it still seems shocking and unsettling.  The special hour long `making of' special included on the disk, featuring David Skal and a host of circus side-show historians, provides plenty of background on many of the `freaks' in the movie.  Skal also provides a commentary track, in which he discusses the many hurdles FREAKS had to overcome during its troubled early history.  Better yet, he provides the viewer with information on the many deleted and edited scenes.On one level, FREAKS isn't a very good movie.  Some of the acting is terribly wooden, the A-List original cast (Myrna Loy, Victor McLaglen, Jean Harlow) begged off the project and considering their replacements and the film's short running time of 62 minutes it's obvious that MGM quickly decided that this was a b-picture.

281287,A2D63RN5LF14R2,6301969588,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[9, 10]","There used to be a theory in art college that many of the professors blandly bandied about like religious dogma. It was the theory of ""aesthetics only.""  This theory maintained that it did not matter whether a painting was of a landscape, a penis, or non-representational. A work of art could only be judged by aesthetic criteria.The biggest problem with that theory is that it rarely holds true. A good example of this would be in comparing the work of Diego Riveria to the work of his wife, Frida Kahlo. Riveria was clearly a better painter aesthetically. He had a far better sense of composition, and a keener sense of color than Kahlo.  However, Riveria lacked Kahlo's obsessive vision, and it is her vision that remains far more memorably etched in our conscience.Another example which blows the ""aesthetics only"" theory out of the water would be in comparing D.W. Griffith to his one-time assistant Tod Browning. There is no doubt that, aesthetically, Griffith was a far more innovative and fluid director.  However, Griffith lacked two important qualities which Browning had in spades; obsessive vision and pronounced human empathy. It is the latter of these two vivid Browning qualities that renders Griffith a grossly inferior artist when compared to the inimitable Tod Browning.Browning was consistently drawn to and connected with the social outcast, while Griffith espoused his racial superiority and reprehensibly tidied that up in his protruding ""aesthetics"" chest.  That Griffith was ( and still is) celebrated, smacks of American and Hollywood hypocrisy and superficiality at its most blatant.Of course, this is nothing new, nor is it confined to the film community.  Conductor Rafael Kubelik was mercilessly attacked and driven out of Chicago by Tribune critic Claudia Cassidy because he programmed ethnic and contemporary music.  How is the late Ms. Cassidy remembered?  Chicago named a theater after her.Celebrated New York Times Music critic Olin Downes publicly ridiculed Dimitri Mitropoulos for his not so secret sexual preference. The freak Dimitri left the New York Philharmonic and succumbed to a fatal heart attack shortly after.Browning remains yet another outcast artist, who is critically compared in unfavorable standing next to the likes of Griffith and fellow ""horror"" director James Whale. Yet, Tod Browning defines the word auteur far more than these, or any director of his time, and he has had a far more impactful influence on the generation of auteur directors who followed him (including David Lynch, David Cronenberg, John Waters, Alejandro Jodorowksy, and Tim Burton [well, early Tim Burton]).After the 1931 box office success of Browning's Dracula and Whale's Frankenstein, MGM second in command Irving Thalberg approached Browning and asked him to come up with something to outdo both of those films. Browning responded with his manifesto, Freaks.From the beginning of Freaks` genesis, there were problems aplenty. Thalberg's fascistic boss, Louis B. Mayer, was vehemently opposed to it even at the conceptual stage, and his objections only intensified.  During filming, many on the MGM lot found the sight of the freaks so disturbing that they sought to have the production stopped.  Fortunately, Thalberg came to Browning's aid and saved filming from being sabotaged on numerous occasions.Then there is Thalberg himself, who remains one of Hollywood's most interesting paradoxes.  Unlike Mayer, Thalberg loved movies and knowing his bad heart would doom him to an early grave, he worked diligently on projects he believed in, securing his legacy, albeit anonymously since he always refused screen credit.  The Marx Brothers were a pet project. The brothers really did create as much surreal havoc off-screen as they did on and many at MGM wanted them gone, but Thalberg took them under his wing amd lavished their productions with so much professionalism, craftsmanship and care that the Marx Brothers films following Thalberg's death are substantially weaker.As much as Thalberg loved movies, he loved them for their entertainment value alone and he had no understanding of film as art. It was Thalberg, with Mayer, who butchered Stroheim's Greed.  When Browning finished Freaks, Thalberg, who had previously defended Browning, did not hesitate to cut nearly a half hour of footage from the film (and, as was the norm at that time, burned the excised footage).It was not even box office whiplash, since the film opened to huge crowds in San Diego, but rather it was critical and audience reactions that prompted Thalberg to hand Browning over to the wolves .  While Thalberg did give Browning the green light to proceed with the inferior Mark of the Vampire (1935) three years later, Freaks, in effect, ended Browning's career. He would only be given two more films, one of which, The Devil Doll (1936) he did not even receive screen credit for. Browning's career came to a whimpering close in 1939.  He died an obscure, alcoholic recluse in 1962.Browning, the perennial outsider, could have cared less. He had run away from an affluent home at the age of 16 to join a carnival side show and the dancer he had fallen in love with.  He began acting in his thirties, assisted Griffith, began making his own films and had been moving towards Freaks for years, stamping almost everything he touched with his own unique personality.  Many of his films are lost, or exist only in truncated condition and very few of those have ever been released in any format whatsoever for the video market.The Unholy Three (1925),The Blackbird (1926),The Road to Mandalay (1926) the unjustly neglected, compelling The Show (1927)--with its own parade of freak characters, and soon to be labeled freak star, John Gilbert--the masterful The Unknown(1927,the lost London after Midnight (1927), West of Zanzibar (1928)and Where East is East (1929) are all unmistakably the hand of Browning.  Not coincidentally, all languish in obscurity.  Browning himself continues to be dismissed by less insightful critics, who evaluate the man and his work by contemporary entertainment standards or even accuse the great empathetic artist of exploitation. Browning's standing still remains low. Neither he, nor any of his films have received a single honor by a major film recognition/preservation institution.Despite Freaks strong American box office opening, it was soon yanked (after two weeks) and banned pretty much worldwide for the next fifty years. Freaks was much written about throughout the 1960s and 1970s. With the advent of the video market in the 1980s, the time was ripe for rediscovery.Does Freaks live up to its reputation? That depends solely on perspective. That it is a masterful vision and labor of love from the most authentically unusual artist to emerge from the Hollywood system is of little doubt. If one approaches Freaks expecting it to be in line with the ""classic horror"" mold films of the 1930's, however,then one is apt to be disappointed. Despite the misguided marketing strategies of the studio, or Blockbuster styled category labeling, Freaks is not a ""horror"" film in the normal understanding of the word. Aptly, it is a horrifying film in the abnormal sense, for it is the horrifying, normal people who intend to murder for money.  Freaks is an unsettling vision and that is the only description one can give to it, genres be damned.That Browning used actual carnival freaks, as opposed to ""real"" actors, certainly killed what little chance the film had for box office potential. Myrna Loy and Jena Harlow were among the actresses MGM attempted to obtain for the lead. Not surprisingly, neither of these tinsel town types would touch it.The most unsettling thing about Freaks is in its unflinching turning of the table. For Browning it is the beautiful ones who are the freaks and the freaks who are the beautiful ones. That the freaks are not professional actors is blatantly obvious from the outset, yet they ring far more authentic than the professionals in the film and, indeed many Hollywood actors of the period. The glamorous acting of countless actors in the thirties rings far more false, and is far less memorable. Of course, little has changed.  The pinheads exude a unique substance and spiritual ethos that one could never gleam from Hollywood's fashion plate, which has consistently confused fashion with style.As in Browning's Dracula, it is clear that the director's interest lies in developing the perennial outsider.  The ""normal"" characters in Freaks seem under-developed, which may have been Browning's choice, or character development may have been lost in Thalberg's merciless excising of nearly a half hour of footage.  The tacked on happy ending has been debated since its release. It does not work and comes off as a diluted afterthought.Olga Baclanova plays Cleopatra, the beautiful trapeze artist who dwarf Hans, played by Henry Earles, falls in love with.  We know her fate from the outset, which mutes the potential for much needed suspense. Cleopatra is merely using Hans for his wealth while she carries on a not so secretive affair with Henry Victor's Hercules.  Frieda, Hans' pre-Cleopatra fianc&eacute;e, is played by Harry's sister, Daisy Earles, and she sees through the scheming of Cleopatra and Hercules.This is a very slow moving build up. Ironically, Browning, having been accused of exploiting the freaks by critics who simply don't have the guts to readily admit that they just don't want to see them, only shows the freaks in their natural, behind the scene, daily environment.  Browning never resorts to showing the freaks on stage or in performance. Instead, he shows these physical mishaps in reality checks, doing everyday things we would do, such as smoking a cigarette.Foolishly, Hans does not listen to Frieda's warnings and marries Cleopatra.  The wedding banquet scene is still among the most discussed moments of Freaks.  The freaks chant ""Gooble, gobble. We accept her, we accept her. One of us.""  They lift their bowl of wine in acceptance of Cleopatra as a fellow freak and Cleopatra does a freak out. She douses them with the wine, calls them filthy freaks and, with Hercules, mocks her new husband.Cleopatra is slowly poisoning Hans.  Hans and his community know it, and plan retaliation. The sequence is beautifully filmed by Browning.  The culprits are exposed in the back of a wagon, deep in the night, during a thunderstorm. Browning's critics have accused him of demonizing the freaks here. Quite the contrary, Browning empowers his misfits and, in communal effort, they exact a terrifying revenge on an abusive, hostile and normal society who forever has branded them as freaks.Theologian Hans Kung rightly has said that visionary John XXIII will never be canonized by the institution.  Visionaries never are canonized by institutions or institutional types. Kung adds that this matters little since those who appreciate and understand vision have already canonized him.The same could be said for Tod Browning. It matters little if the Academy Awards,the American Film Institute or by-the-numbers critics pay him due or not. The visionaries canonized him a long time ago.* MY REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIES",5,TOD BROWNING'S FREAKS,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,11240,"['used', 'be', 'theory', 'art',

Dracula, Frankenstein, the Mummy, and many other monsters like them were huge at the box office.  At the time, Tod Browning was a hugely successful silent film director who had a major film hit with DRACULA.  Browning had been trying for several years to adapt a short story, Tod Robbins' ""Spurs"", into a feature film with Lon Chaney scheduled to appear.  However, it took the success of DRACULA before Browning was finally given the go.FREAKS was a huge success at it's initial screening in San Diego, but the movie was so unusual for its time (instead of fictional monsters the film was filled with real-life human oddities) that many found it squeamish and frightening and the studio pulled the film and had it re-edited.  The movie found some critical success and was very popular in some cities, but overall the film was critically panned.  Critics and many viewers found the sideshow setting of the film, with Siamese twins, armless women, pinheads, bearded ladies, dwarves, and a limbless man to be just too unnatural.  It was banned in many cities across the U.S. as well as in Britain and Australia and MGM pulled the film from circulation.  Fueled by a spirit of rebellion, the movie had a renaissance in the 1960s which continued for over thirty years until the film being added to the National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board in 1994.The basic plot of the film revolves around the dwarf Hans (Harry Earles) and his serious infatuation for a regular-sized female trapeze artist named Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova).  Hans is engaged to a female dwarf, Frieda (Daisy Earles--Harry's sister in real life), but when Cleo joins their circus, he becomes obsessed with her beauty.  Cleo encourages Hans' advances, but really just thinks of him as a toy to play with, even making fun of him with other ""normal"" people at the circus behind his back.  Cleo's real lover is the strong man Hercules (Henry Victor), who makes his living lousing upon wealthy women.  Though Cleo isn't rich, Hans treats her like a queen and when she learns that Hans has inherited a fortune she and Hercules plan a way to get all of Hans' money.  She marries Hans with the intention of slowly poisoning him over time until he dies.  But the ""freaks"" at the circus learn of Cleo and Hercules' plan and set into motion a plan of revenge of their very own.At the time of its initial release, many people found FREAKS horrifying because of the human oddities.  Some would argue that we are now too desensitized by all the graphic and horrifying things we've been exposed to over the past two generations to find the film as frightening as it once must have seen.  I would like to think it's more because we've become more sensitive and compassionate about all people (of course, a movie like FREAKS would never get made today).  Whatever the case, the unusual people in FREAKS aren't disturbing and shocking.  With our modern lens, audiences can see beyond the ""freaks"" and see them as the people they really were (as they movie says, ""They are all God's children) and see the movie for the excellent film it is.The official DVD version includes an audio commentary with film historian David Skal, an almost hour-long ""making-of"" featurette, and alternative endings to the movie (however, the original ending of the movie that shows what happens to Hercules seems to have been lost forever).  I really enjoyed all of the special features. They are filled with all kinds of information about the movie, the performers, and the history of cinema.",5,Brilliant and Daring Cinematic Masterpiece,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,3643,"['early', '1930s', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'discovered', 'monster', 'movie', 'monster', 'movie', 'was', 'rage', 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Mummy', 'many', 'other', 'monsters', 'were', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'time', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'was', 'hugely', 'successful', 'silent', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'had', 'major', 'film', 'hit', 'DRACULA', 'Browning', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'several', 'years', 'adapt', 'short', 'story', 'Tod', 'Robbins', 'Spurs', 'feature', 'film', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'scheduled', 'appear', 'However', 'took', 'success', 'DRACULA', 'Browning', 'was', 'finally', 'given', 'go.FREAKS', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'initial', 'screening', 'San', 'Diego', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'unusual', 'time', 'instead', 'fictional', 'monsters', 'film', 'was', 'filled', 'real-life', 'human', 'oddities', 'many', 'found', 'squeamish', 'frightening', 'studio', 'pulled', 'film', 'had', 're-edited', 'movie', 'found', 'critical', 'success', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'cities', 'film', 'was', 'critically', 'panned', 'Critics', 'many', 'viewers', 'found', 'sideshow', 'setting', 'film', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'armless', 'women', 'pinheads', 'bearded', 'ladies', 'dwarves', 'limbless', 'man', 'be', 'just', 'too', 'unnatural', 'was', 'banned', 'many', 'cities', 'U.S.', 'as', 'well', 'Britain', 'Australia', 'MGM', 'pulled', 'film', 'circulation', 'Fueled', 'spirit', 'rebellion', 'movie', 'had', 'renaissance', '1960s', 'continued', 'thirty', 'years', 'film', 'being', 'added', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'National', 'Film', 'Preservation', 'Board', '1994.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'dwarf', 'Hans', 'Harry', 'Earles', 'serious', 'infatuation', 'regular-sized', 'female', 'trapeze', 'artist', 'named', 'Cleopatra', 'Olga', 'Baclanova', 'Hans', 'engaged', 'female', 'dwarf', 'Frieda', 'Daisy', 'Earles', 'Harry', 'sister', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'Cleo', 'circus', 'obsessed', 'beauty', 'Cleo', 'Hans', 'advances', 'really', 'just', 'thinks', 'toy', 'play', 'even', 'making', 'fun', 'other', 'normal', 'people', 'circus', 'back', 'Cleo', 'real', 'lover', 'strong', 'man', 'Hercules', 'Henry', 'Victor', 'who', 'living', 'lousing', 'wealthy', 'women', 'Cleo', ""n't"", 'rich', 'Hans', 'queen', 'when', 'Hans', 'inherited', 'fortune', 'Hercules', 'plan', 'way', 'get', 'Hans', 'money', 'Hans', 'intention', 'slowly', 'poisoning', 'time', 'freaks', 'circus', 'learn', 'Cleo', 'Hercules', 'plan', 'set', 'motion', 'plan', 'revenge', 'very', 'time', 'initial', 'release', 'many', 'people', 'found', 'FREAKS', 'horrifying', 'human', 'oddities', 'would', 'argue', 'are', 'now', 'too', 'desensitized', 'graphic', 'horrifying', 'things', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exposed', 'past', 'two', 'generations', 'find', 'film', 'as', 'frightening', 'once', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'more', ""'ve"", 'become', 'more', 'sensitive', 'compassionate', 'people', 'course', 'movie', 'FREAKS', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'made', 'today', 'case', 'unusual', 'people', 'FREAKS', 'are', ""n't"", 'disturbing', 'shocking', 'modern', 'lens', 'audiences', 'can', 'see', 'freaks', 'see', 'people', 'really', 'were', 'movie', 'are', 'God', 'children', 'see', 'movie', 'excellent', 'film', 'official', 'DVD', 'version', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'historian', 'David', 'Skal', 'almost', 'hour-long', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'alternative', 'endings', 'movie', 'however', 'original', 'ending', 'movie', 'what', 'Hercules', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'forever', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'filled', 'kinds', 'information', 'movie', 'performers', 'history', 'cinema']",N/A

All of Tod Browning's films seem to deal with the darker side of the human psyche using complex metaphor and engrossong story telling. Freaks is his masterpiece. He was a visionary film maker who knew how to get under the skin, crawl up the spine and bury thoughts in our brains that would never go away. In this film, he weaves a tale of sloth and greed where the &#34;normal&#34; ones are the real abhorations. It is a classic morality story where the underdog wins in the end and the viewer is left to walk away with  nightmarish images of people crawling through mud in the rain. knives between clinched teeth, on a mission, not for revenge, but to put an end to evil, and wondering if we, ourselves, are also deserving such a fate for our prejudices towards those we refuse to try and understand let alone empathise with.

Also, there is an hour long documentary about ""freaks"" with interviews which give fascinating insight into the the life of the whole carny culture.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED but definately not for the weak and sensitive.",5,One of a kind movie...,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,960,"['cult', 'classic', 'reputation', 'being', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'unnerving', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'agree', 'reputation', 'highly', 'deserved', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'even', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'images', 'film', 'will', 'haunt', 'rest', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'saying', 'things', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'fun', 'people', 'fortuante', 'deformities', 'Freaks', 'highly', 'respectful', 'deformities', 'so', 'called', 'normal', 'people', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'monsters.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'nice', 'presensation', 'clear', 'picture', 'nice', 'sound', 'especially', 'considering', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1932', 'Also', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'freaks', 'interviews', 'give', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'life', 'whole', 'carny', 'culture.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'definately', 'not', 'weak', 'sensitive']",N/A
281292,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,6301969588,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[1, 2]","Freaks is surprisingly still intriguing and unique 75 years after it's original release. The story is interesting and the acting fairly believable. The short running time (66 minutes) is actually not much of a hindrance either, as it simply allows the film to get down to business quickly.All the characters are amazing to see on screen as most of them are real circus performers: The Human Torso, the ""pinheads"", two women with no arms, a bearded woman, the human skeleton, and the list goes on.  Even in this day and age, seeing these people on scren is mesmerizing.The DVD includes a great amount of special features, including an hour long feauturette where several historians and circus performers discuss the impact of the movie, and the give background on several characters in the film. With the special features and the film itself combined, this DVD is unmissable. Definitely worth checking out.",4,A horror movie that strives for something more,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,905,"['Freaks', 'surprisingly', 'still', 'intriguing', 'unique', '75', 'years', 'original', 'release', 'story', 'interesting', 'acting', 'fairly', 'believable', 'short', 'running', 'time', '66', 'minutes', 'actually', 'not', 'much', 'hindrance', 'either', 'simply', 'film', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'characters', 'are', 'amazing', 'see', 'screen', 'most', 'are', 'real', 'circus', 'performers', 'Human', 'Torso', 'pinheads', 'two', 'women', 'arms', 'bearded', 'woman', 'human', 'skeleton', 'list', 'Even', 'day', 'age', 'seeing', 'people', 'scren', 'mesmerizing.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'amount', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'hour', 'long', 'feauturette', 'where', 'several', 'historians', 'circus', 'performers', 'discuss', 'impact', 'movie', 'give', 'background', 'several', 'characters', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'combined', 'DVD', 'unmissable', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
