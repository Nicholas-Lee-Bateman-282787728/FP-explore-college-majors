As it typical, the music program is the first slated to go.

1479562,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAII1W,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I love Kevin James.  His movies don't always pan out like I want them to, thanks to his friendship with Adam Sandler, but for the most part he tends to elevate everything he touches.  The idea of him starring in a family friendly `Warrior' type film just seemed like too much fun to pass on.  For the most part, this film delivers in a big way, with smart laughs and a real heart at its center.`Here Comes the Boom' is the latest in that long line of inspirational `teacher' stories, except this one is clearly a comedy going for less assertive schmaltz (or more comedic schmaltz) and is laced with the sudden interest in that crazy world of UFC fighting.  In the film, James plays Scott, a disillusioned biology teacher who has become rather lazy thanks to the school's overall lack of enthusiasm about teaching.  When budget cuts threaten to cost the music teacher his job, Scott steps up to the plate to try and raise the HUGE sum of money needed to keep the man employed.  When teaching night school isn't cutting it, he turns to the world of mixed martial arts and becomes the school's hero as he fights his way to the top, quite literally.James is a very likable guy.  Even in horrible movies like `Zookeeper' and `Chuck and Larry' he's a lovable presence.  You can't help but want to watch him.  Here, he takes that everyman routine to another level and really nails both sides of the spectrum.  When the film starts he's an outspoken oaf who is late to his job, obviously uninspired and kind of apathetic.  By the film's end his heart is on his sleeve and all the goodness that was below the surface comes out in spades.  The film's handling of that golden center is really well done to.  Yes, I was teary eyed by the time it was all over.  It is saccharine and yet not in that overtly sentimental kind of way.But this brings me to a major concern I have with this movie; it is REALLY VIOLENT.  For a PG rated film, I expected the violence and fighting to be in a more slapstick nature, and so I allowed my daughter to watch it.  Sure, the scenes are set up to be funny, but they are very aggressive.  I was shocked it was PG, for the violence is no less extreme than seen in films like `Warrior'.  I have a problem with this because while the film itself teaches a positive message, I don't really think kids need to see grown men beating each other to a pulp.That said, for the adults this one works.  The humor is nicely developed for a film produced by Adam Sandler (who just isn't funny anymore).  Salma Hayek is not a good actress, but she kind of makes a sweet love interest here.

(I suppose it's easier to be good if you have low expectations to begin with, but that's beside the point.)  It was actually enjoyable, with a good number of &#34;warm, fuzzy moments&#34; that made the movie an overall good experience.I don't do spoilers, per se, but this next part is about as close to spoilers as I get, so be warned. Kevin James' character is the typical burned-out teacher trope that we've all seen before, but he does it with enough enthusiasm that it's enjoyable. He's always trying to get the girl, and she's always rebuffing his advances, but they make it work (if you can get past the fact that there's no apparent reason why Salma Hayek would be attracted to Kevin James, both physically and mentally, in the first place). And there's the whole MMA thing; you have to be willing to believe that a 42 year old overweight teacher is going to be able to compete with well-trained athletes half his age in MMA cage fights. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief, than this movie will work for you.The casting is good, and the action flows. The scenarios in the movie, which we've seen so many times before (remember &#34;Summer School&#34; or &#34;The Principal&#34;?) are done well enough so that they don't seem too musty.

The film looks fantastic on Blu-ray as close-ups show amazing detail of the characters faces.  Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep but the film looks fantastic with no compression artifacts or any visual problems at all.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Here Comes the Boom"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French, Spanish and Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven with plenty of music, so front and center-channel driven.  Good use of surrounds for crowd ambiance, especially during Scott Voss' entry to the ring.  Good use of surrounds during the more action intense sequences but for the most part, lossless audio is very good!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin Traditional), Korean and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Here Comes the Boom "" come with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - Featuring a total of 17 deleted scenes including the original ending.Gag-Reel - (2:26) A short gag reel featuring the outtakes from ""Here Comes the Boom"".Here Comes the Cast - (6:24) Director Frank Coraci and the cast talk about various cast members and working together.Gino vs. Ritchie - (3:49) The Associate Producer vs. Kevin James Stand-in in a MMA sparring match.Back to School - (4:27) Finding a closed down school in Boston to film ""Here Comes the Boom"".Learning How to Fight - (8:48) Joe Rogan and Kevin James discuss their interest in MMA a long time ago and how Kevin has been training for years.  Also how the trial and error of filming the fight scenes with real fighters and more.Three Amigos - (5:39) A featurette of Henry Winkler, Bas Rutten and Mark BellaGrotte working together.The Pros - (3:00) Interviews with the professional MMA fighters who starred in ""Here Comes the Boom"".Disco Street Fighting - (2:05) A training video by Nico (Bas Rutten) on ""Disco Street Fighting"".EXTRAS:""Here Comes the Boom"" comes with an Ultraviolet code which allows one to download the film to their computer and select Apple and Android devices and the ability to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:After the disappointing ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"", I have to admit that I was not sure if I wanted to see ""Here Comes the Boom"", that is until I reminded myself of the many chances I have given Adam Sandler films and realized that actor Kevin Smith is part of the same crew of actor/comedians and you have to give them the benefit of the doubt.  But also, you have Frank Coraci as director, and so I figured that I should give the film a chance.And after watching Smith's latest film ""Here Comes the Boom"", I have to say that I enjoyed this film a lot!A film about an overweight man having to compete in the UFC, I'm sure is going to be a source of laughs for a lot of people but for this film, what makes it work is the fact that Kevin James is a big fan and follower of mixed martial arts (MMA) and the UFC.  He has trained not to fight but trained in MMA for his workout in the past several years and for this role, he dedicated himself to a regiment to get fit.While we are not going to see anything drastic such as Tom Hanks ""Castaway"" of seeing a man with pounds transform to a rail thin individual, Kevin Smith is seen to go through some changes within the body and eventually see some muscle definition.You also get a cast of unlikely ""three amigos"" joining in on the film with ""Happy Days"" actor Henry Winkler being put together with the loud and talkative former UFC heavyweight champion fighter Bas Rutten and the famous Boston Muay Thai trainer Mark DellaGrotte.  You really don't know what to expect when you have these three as part of Team Scott Voss and suffice to say, hilarity ensues from the moment this film starts to the way it ends.Add in the beautiful Salma Hayek and the singer with the beautiful voice, Charice and you have an entertaining action/comedy film.While not exactly a Rocky-style of film, as a viewer, whether or not you enjoy MMA or not, you sympathize with the character of Scott Voss, the teacher and underdog who is doing all he can to rescue the music program at his school and his friend, Marty's job.  But it's that friendship that is developed in the storyline that ultimately becomes entertaining.Henry Winkler as Marty, the timid musician who is softspoken but tries to help Scott in unusual ways, Niko who is trying to become a US citizen but also a bit jealous that Scott is getting a chance to fight in the UFC and his career ended after a significant injury and Mark DellaGrotte who puts Scott through a test by sicking three of his best fighters to see if Scott deserves to be trained.The fight choreography is fantastic and you actually learn through the special features that some of these fighters that had to fight against Scott are still competing in the UFC and it's not easy to train a fighter to pull their punches, because it works against their training.  So, actor Kevin James took a pounding in several scenes and he also dished it back as well against the fighters in the film.But for the most part, everything comes together and I have to say that it's Kevin James best film yet!  And it helps when the actor is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject, and in this case, mixed martial arts.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and lossless audio is fantastic.  There are are good amount of special features included and for the most part, a solid Blu-ray release overall.If you are a fan of Kevin James, may it be from television via ""The King of Queens"" or his past films, ""Here Comes the Boom"" is an exciting and hilarious film and his best one yet!  ""Here Comes the Boom"" is recommended!",4,"""Here Comes the Boom"" is an enjoyable and hilarious film!",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,7031,"['Frank', 'Coraci', 'director', 'Waterboy', 'Wedding',

Look, I'm a huge MMA fan, enough to quickly recognize cameos from professional fighters like Mayhem Miller, Chael Sonnen, Romolo Barral, Mark Munoz, and Krzysztof Soszynski. Unfortunately, that just wasn't enough to save this film for me and make this comedy funny or entertaining. Henry Winkler and Bas Rutten do provide some comic relief, but sparingly. Unfortunately, the whole is far less than the sum of its' parts, and proves that a quality cast, good direction and cinematography, and potentially interesting script do not necessarily equal entertainment. It it appears that Kevin James' career path is on the same trajectory as Adam Sandler, which is to churn out hit-or-miss comedies that may kill at the box office but are actually low on comedic value.As an undercurrent, I know Kevin James is a huge MMA/UFC fan, and this is certainly his attempt to help make the sport more mainstream, but not sure it does so successfully.  There is really no reason to detail all the parts that don't make sense, but there are quite a few.  Understanding there is a lot of Hollywood license here related to MMA is an understatement. I'm not sure if the target audience was MMA fans, because if it was, it is blatantly absurd, and even insulting to guys that actually train and put the time in to be professional fighters. If it was targeted at non-MMA fans or those on the fence, I'm not sure it peaks their curiosity or just vindicates the fact they already think MMA is pointless. Either way, not sure it helps the cause.I'll give it credit for taking perhaps the only sport that hasn't been bastardized in comedy yet.

Kevin James plays Scott Voss a relatively burnt-out teacher who finally gets enthusiastic again when he sees the one teacher (played by Henry Winkler) at his inner-city school who was still enthusiastic about his work facing the budgetary axe.Not knowing exactly what to do, Voss simply tries everything to fund-raise to save his imperiled colleague's job, including, finally, submitting to simply getting beaten-up for money at MMA prize fights.  Now Voss, we're told had been ""a wrestler in high school/college.""  So he's not completely defenseless.  However, when he first takes up this idea of entering into MMA prize fights, he does just get beat-upon.  However, Voss' renewed enthusiasm proves contagious.  And since this is a Hollywood movie, most could guess how the story ends... ;-)The story argues a counter point to those who'd argue that one ""needs a plan"" before seeking to right a wrong.

1479637,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005LAII1W,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[9, 13]","HERE COMES THE BOOM (2012, 100 minutes) delivers on my hoped-for promise from Kevin James and his future in film. The Gentle Giant (as I call him) plays Mr. Scott Voss, a disillusioned, lazy biology teacher in Massachusetts. This film was charmingly filmed on location in Quincy, Massachusetts and in Boston.When the school and its nasty weasel of a principal (Greg Germann) decide to completely cut the music program (directed by Mr. Streb, played by Henry Winkler in his best film role yet) everyone is up in arms. Mr. Voss and Mr. Streb are somewhat close, but then Mr. Voss notes Mr. Streb's deep devotion to his teaching. It doesn't help when you have the hots for the school nurse who happens to be Salma Hayek in an incredibly goofy, comic turn.Mr. Voss decides on a way to get the money the school will need to keep the music program.  He decides to fight UFC. Bas Rutten plays Nico, ex-UFC fighter and trainer who Mr. Voss teaches in his night job as English-as-a-second-language class. The exuberantly hyper, hilarious and childlike Nico agrees to train Mr. Voss, but only in defense.The kind of hilarity and heartstring-pulling is not a surprise from Kevin James, but it also shows James maturing in his comic timing, delivery and the film is a few pegs up from his usual work. Though I deplored the lack of any concentration on the school kids, because after all this is about how our generation is betraying our kids, I enjoyed what little there was. After all, this is more importantly a character-driven comedy.There is a special comic timing, a delivery and a laid-back style of performing that is natural and hilarious. I don't know if James is responsible for this obvious on-set attitude, but it works wonders. Kevin James in one of his comic films is a treat for me anytime, because he reminds me of the great film comedians of the 1930s, when this talkie-style comedy was perfected by people like Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel, Harold Lloyd, Adolphe Menjou and Buster Keaton.When Mr. Streb accosts Mr. Voss in the hall for some small talk, and whispers that Ravel liked to cross-dress, let's just say it doesn't really look funny reading it in my review. Watch the film: Winkler and James will have you rolling on the floor. And the improvised rough-housing between James and Hayek is equally funny.I happen to have a distaste for UFC, but have a feeling I'd get hooked if I started watching it. So you will see some famous fighters herein, people I totally do not recognize except, of course, for martial arts master/actor Master Kru Mark DellaGrotte, who has a cameo as himself.The violence is one thing I'd warn about, if you think of this as a family film. It is, because it is about the teaching spirit combined with the spirit of tenacity. But it is still fighting violence, and I do not approve of Middle School kids getting the message that it is just dandy. It may become necessary for self defense, but I still do not approve. This cost the film one star in my estimation.There is a stunning performance here by Gary Valentine who looks exactly like James, only a bit stranger-looking. He plays Mr. Voss' brother, and I could still swear he is James' brother in real life.

I kept saying I couldn't wait to see what he'd accomplish after I first saw him inPaul Blart: Mall Cop(see my review).

Kevin James was absolutely hilarious, and so was the entire cast, except for the school Principal, who had one of those mean personalities that most people would just tolerate if they had to. Kevin James is a Biology Teacher, who desperately tried to help his school, his students, and the music Teacher keep his job. The school was on a tight-budget, cutting back on everything from supplies to music class, and to make matters worse, a school official was stealing school funds.  Kevin James steps in as he becomes the hero of the school, by wrestling in the ring in Las Vegas, and other places. The acting performance of the entire cast was superb, music was great, romance was in the air, and the moral of the story was excellent. From 'The King Of Queens' comedy to the wrestling match made Kevin James outstanding in every respect. This is not only one of the funniest movies of the year, but one of the best for Kevin James. Some situations were laugh-out-loud fun and enjoyment. Other situations, where a teacher took many challenges to help his students were heartwarming. This is a must-see for family entertainment, and for me a must-have for my DVD collection.

1479651,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B005LAII1W,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[2, 14]","I have loved Kevin James ever since the Queen of Kings sitcom, even though it was really controversial due to its excesses of foul language, sex and violence. Even though I thought that I Now Pronounce you Larry and Milton was not as funny as James could be, I still decided to take a few friends of mine from my Alcoholics Anonymous classes to go see Here Comes the Boom, and, boy, did we ever leave not disappointed at all! You could say that this was the most fun we have ever had totally sober.The story of this film is pretty basic so that even the densest audience members understand the plot; this is no surprise since it is a Kevin James movie after all. James plays Scott Voss, who is a 50-something home ec teacher who desirously wants to become a WWE superstar after he learns that the funding for his middle school's sex education class (bananas and all) will be cut without any mercy. Now, while some would argue that that would be good because kids will likely have less sex due to no sex education classes, Voss is not happy at all since he thinks that the sex education program should not be cut because he thinks that kids should be shown how to meticulously and correctly place a c/o/n/do/m on a Chiquita banana. All he needs is $69,000.He then goes to the WWE's developmental territory to audition to become a WWE superstar, and he is promptly offered some steroids by Vince McMahon (doesn't he look great for 85?). Hilarious, comedic laughs ensue! After dropping some pounds and bulking up by drinking lots of protein shakes, Voss finally gets accepted into the WWE, but only as a low-card jobber, losing to the likes of Kofi Kingston, Epico and Primo and Barry Horowitz. The climax of the film occurs when Voss has to fill in for an injured John Cena at Wrestlemania X/X/X. Though Vince McMahon wants him to lose to a surprisingly returning Stone Cold Steve Austin (who by now wears several leg braces and has put on a lot of weight around his love handles), Voss rejects this proposition. As a result, he goes on to Wrestlemania X/X/X and exposes to the world just how fa/k/e ""professional"" wrasslin' really is in a pre-match promo. Everyone gets really shocked and angry at Vince McMahon that the world of wrasslin' is really f/a/k/e because they had no idea at all. Soon thereafter, WWE goes bankrupt, and all that Vince McMahon has left is his sports yacht called the S/e/x/y B/e/y/o/t/ch.Deflated and still out of the $69,000 he requires to save his middle school's sex ed program--by the way, Voss' middle school is called Bill Clinton Middle School--Voss watches as the sex ed program is canned. Realizing that this is a sure sign that most Americans really do not want sex ed taught in schools and instead want parents to teach their kids about sex, Voss undergoes a transformative change. He becomes a televangelist who works for Pat Robertson's TV network. Even his illegal alien maid, played by Selma Hayak, follows him to his new gig.I thought the way the movie wrapped up was brilliantly touching and funny at the same time. It was not predictable or derivative in any way, but, rather, very original and of a very high caliber of entertainment, almost as good as Suburban Commando and Mr. Nanny.

I walked out of the theater grinning. HERE COMES THE BOOM follows convention, does it ever. There's no earthshaking plot twist. But the film's expert execution of those tropes and Kevin James' warm, committed performance won me over. And there are enough laughs. And I'm a devoted enough sports fan. And I'll always root for endeavors that promote educators and expose the disadvantages that hinder them from doing their job. That Salma Hayek is in the movie doesn't suck, either. Her character's name is Bella, and I'd be hard pressed to think of something else more appropriate to call her.Once upon a time, 42-year-old high school biology teacher Scott Voss (James) won the Teacher of the Year honors. But that was a decade ago, and he's since lost his spark. Today Scott Voss is an indifferent cog in Boston's educational system. But when budget cutbacks threaten to eliminate the school's extracurricular activities - including his friend Marty's (Henry Winkler) music department - Scott Voss is galvanized impetuously into action. Except how do you now raise $48,000, especially in the face of a looming deadline?Once upon a time, Scott Voss was a Division One collegiate wrestler, a pretty good one, never mind that that was two decades ago. Scott arrives at the deranged idea of competing in the mixed martial arts circuit to drum up money for his school. You'd think the fact that he doesn't know much about the MMA sport would give him pause... Anyway, early on, anticipate scenes of Scott's getting harshly beat down.By the way, I like that his ring walks are serenaded by a Neil Diamond track. Makes me smile.Oh, most critics will hate this film. They won't take into the equation that there's a sweetness to this story, that there's heart and warm sentiment nestled in that gauntlet of cliches. Thankfully, the story isn't too sanitized. There's some bite to it. There's even a moment in which a debate surfaces regarding the validity and morality of resorting to violence, even if it's only in a sporting venue, in order to resolve a school's financial dilemma. I'm not sure that the film adequately addresses that. But let's not get too mired in deep moralizing. This movie isn't trying to change the world. It's trying to entertain you. There's a time and place and a mood for these kinds of films. There's a time for navel-gazing, and a time for popcorn and twizzlers.To my surprise, Kevin James and Salma Hayak manage to ignite a few sparks. I'm not saying they replicate that heat between Richard Gere and Debra Winger, but, after a while, I bought into James' character actually having a shot with Hayak's school nurse, never mind that she'd already rejected him the fifteen times he'd asked her out. But there's a nice, easy rapport in their interactions. Note that, this time, Hayak's sexy nurse isn't singing back-up or possessed by a malevolent creature from outer space.I suppose the presence of MMA fighters and personalities lends credibility. Fight commentators Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg play themselves. MMA fighter Krzysztof Soszynski (not playing himself) squares up with Scott in the Octagon. But Bas Rutten turns in one of the best performances, playing Nico, an outlandish, scene-stealing former MMA fighter who trains Scott in exchange for getting tutored as he bones up for his coming U.S. citizenship exam.I don't know if, like I heard in a Bas Rutten interview, Kevin James had trained for 14 months going into this film, but I'm happy to say that he doesn't embarass himself. Kevin has got that unsvelte, bearish figure, but he did get into a decent enough shape, considering. And it's not like his character is playing this elite gladiator, anyway. Scott Voss's clumsy, amateurish style is based on his playing defense and getting lucky with a strike. His chances of winning rely more on his perseverence thru sheer gumption and an ability to absorb punches and a stone-cold reluctance to disappoint his students. It makes you root for him all the more. So set aside the artsy-fartsy mindset, assemble the homies, and check out this feel-good show. In the face of impending ridicule, I'm rating HERE COMES THE BOOM 4 out of 5 stars.

I've liked Kevin James, but his movies have been mediocre so this I thought was a welcome entry for sure. I can't think of a funnier Kevin James movie. The humor was more grounded in character and reality rather than slapstick. James performance was completely true to the character. In fact, for me, this movie works on just about every level and I think it succeeds in what it was intended to be - clean family entertainment.  They even made it feel plausible (somewhat) that Kevin James could compete at the sport.  The fight scenes were intense - almost Warrior quality and I'm surprized it came away with just a PG for that reason.So - I'm giving this (somewhat predictable) family drama, comedy, sports film a hearty recommendation.

1479669,A10H47FMW8NHII,B005LAII1W,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[2, 3]","Attention! Kevin James fans (and you are legion): this time he's a high-school biology teacher turned reluctant Mixed Martial Arts contestant in a frantic attempt to raise money for the music program in his financially strapped school. The lesson we take away is the value of perseverance, honesty and hard work.We see:* Kevin James (""Zookeeper"") is Scott Voss, a weary, uninspired high-school biology teacher. He was a college wrestler, but now just wants to put in his time. Oh yes, he also lusts after the school nurse. James seems to have successfully made the transition from TV's long-running The King of Queens to a movie career.* Salma Hayek (""Savages"") is Bella Flores, the school nurse who insists that anyone who courts her shows respect and good manners. I love how she shoves that loudmouth MMA fan at the final bout! Hayek seems to alternate between light-hearted comedies and tough dramas.* Henry Winkler (""Royal Pains"") is Marty Streb, the gentle music teacher who is devastated to learn that he will be unemployed when his music program is axed. Winkler is enjoying a full, rich actor's life, despite his iconic role years ago as The Fonz.* Greg Germann (""Ally McBeal"" and lots of TV) is Mr. Belcher, the high-school principal who decides to discontinue the music program but keep the football team. Germann seems to specialize in characters who are morally compromised.* Gary Valentine (""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"") is Marty Voss, our hero's brother. His passion is cooking, despite evidence to the contrary.... Mr. Valentine is a stand-up comic who has appeared in a number of Kevin James' projects; they're brothers, so it makes sense.* Reggie Lee (""Safe"") is Mr. De La Cruz, the father of a high-school musician. He has a restaurant to run and wants his daughter to help. This is a nice change of pace for Mr. Lee: he often plays cold-blooded Asian killers!* Joe Rogan is a Mixed Martial Arts commentator and a stand-up comic who holds black belts and other achievements in martial arts, including a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He is one of many MMA competitors who appear in this movie.* Charice who played Malia De La Cruz (Dubbed by Oprah as ""The most talented girl in the world"" and an amazing international singer) This is an addition provided by another Amazon reader. Thanks!To me, this film was notable for a couple of moments: 1) During an American studies evening class for immigrants studying for their citizenship, our hero pauses to allow the AA group in an adjacent classroom to complete their prayer; 2) Before his bout, our four guys form a circle, join hands and have a moment of silence. Both of these moments are unusual in their consideration for religious beliefs. I'm not a religious person, but I found on-screen respect for those who are, to be refreshing.Despite the brutality of MMA bouts, our hero is a decent, kind and mildly selfish fellow, who matures as he embraces a purpose larger than himself. Not a bad thing.... (Spoiler Alert!)

Kevin James plays the perfect part of a 42 year-old biology teacher who dives into MMA fighting in order to raise money for his school, so that the music department (headed by Henry Winkler) won't be shut down.  In this day of ubiquitous profanity, gratuitous violence and sexual references, it's ALMOST a film that the whole family can see.  The rough guys of the UFC are also portrayed as down-to-earth, likeable, and they even pray before a match.  This gives the film a good vibe.  James' character also leads a kind of a resurgence in people's lives, including his brother (who would rather be a chef than a painter), the oddball music teacher (Winkler, in a great role), his trainer Niko (a charismatic and physical character) and the father of one of his students (a restaurant owner).  For such a bunch of tough guys, there's little profanity (usually centered on a guy saying he's going to kick another guy's a**).  There is the violence around UFC fighting though, some graphic blood, and one very gross yet funny scene where James's character throws up on a downed opponent.  ALMOST family-friendly - for the jaded movie environment these days, that's about as close as you're going to get!

While not all were hit with the critics, he has managed to garner a following. The trailer for his latest Here Comes The Boom looked like a mix of the same old fair that he normally delivers, but does it have any chance of working to deliver a funny comedy or will it end up being just another forced goofy addition to his resume.Here Comes The Boom follows a biology teacher who is determine to save the music program from being cut in their school by becoming a mixed-martial arts fighter. While the premise is a bit out there and some of the scenarios are a bit far-fetched this movie works surprisingly well. There are plenty of laughs here that work on numerous levels, but depending on how big a fan of James you are will determine how funny they are. The real surprise here was the fact that there was so much more here than just a stupid comedy. The story is a typical underdog tale with comedy, but enough heart to keep you rooting for James throughout the whole film. Gone is the usual over the top bumbling funny fat guy, in its place was a cooler everyman that works perfectly for this story. James steps up to really deliver more than he has to date. He shows not only a good range with some different emotions, but is pretty impressive with his ability to carry the fight scenes. It was nice to see that while this was a comedy, they still took the fighting side of it seriously to deliver something not only believable but entertaining and will suck you right into the action. The rest of the cast do a great job of bringing everything together, with the real highlights being Henry Winkler who is a spitting image of the band teacher in the Simpsons and former MMA legend Bas Rutten. Both of these guys never take themselves seriously and deliver some funny memorable and likable characters.This movie was a real surprise on almost every level. It delivers an almost Rocky like underdog tale with some over the top funny moments to create something completely unexpected.

1479720,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAII1W,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I love a feel good movie that's supposed to be based on a real life story. The only problem is when I hear that I want to know more about the actual story so that I can find out just how much is real and how much is fiction. You won't get that information here but you will get a very entertaining film if you watch HERE COMES THE BOOM.Kevin James stars as Scott Voss, a teacher who's seen better days and for whom work is nothing more than a job to pass time. At one time Voss was a dedicated teacher and even won teacher of the year but that was ten years earlier. That time has come and gone.Voss is the close friend of Marty Streb (Henry Winkler), the school music teacher who never lost his desire to inspire and encourage his students. As the pair head to a staff meeting, Marty tells Voss that his wife is expecting, an amazing achievement considering his age. Problems kick in when during the meeting the staff is told that due to lack of funding several departments are going to be cut next year beginning with the music department. When Voss argues against the cuts he's told that unless they can come up with the funding, $48, 000, the program is gone.Voss calls for a meeting of teachers to find out how they can raise the funds but the only ones to show are himself, Marty and the school nurse Bella (Selma Hayek) that he has the hots for but who turns him down with each request for a date. Bella is only interested in someone who had dedication and the desire to teach and she's missed that in Voss by ten years. Other than Bella doing a bake sale, Voss' only other option is to teach a night school course in citizenship. It doesn't add up to much but it's a start.One night Voss watches an MMA (mixed martial arts) fight with his brother and thinks he can do that. Having been a collegiate wrestler he knows he can do at least enough to survive. When one of his students, an ex MMA fighter named Niko (real MMA star Bas Rutten) tells him how much he can earn in losing a fight, Voss decides that even if he loses 30 fights over the next year he can make enough to keep the music program running. Now to keep everyone in the dark (except Marty who is helping him) about the subject.Voss soon learns that being in an MMA bout isn't quite as easy as he expected. But with some help from his friends he begins to get better with each fight. A problem with some bad apple sauce results in the kids at school finding out about what he's trying to do and he soon gets their support as well.Voss' training goes into gear when he gets professional help from one if Niko's friends. Not only that but the training as well as the encouragement from the students help Voss to find his passion for teaching again. He rises not only to the challenge of the ring but to that of his students as well and with that comes the chance for romance with Bella.Of course the usual film storyline comes into play here with Voss suddenly having the opportunity to fight in a professional UFC fight where he can earn enough money to get the program funded for the next year plus. A twist in the story kicks in the night before the match and suddenly everything that has come before finds Voss doing the right thing not for himself but for those of everyone around him that he cares for.Yes, the story line here reads like ROCKY or other sports films of this sort where the underdog has the chance to save the day. So what? The movie moves along at a steady pace and entertains along the way. It doesn't feel like there is a moment wasted but at the same time doesn't feel rushed either. What it does do is have you rooting for the little guy from start to finish and that finish will have you on the edge of your seat until the final bell rings.The best thing in this movie though is the performances with one small exception. Hayek does a great job but her part is far too small here. She's more window dressing and supporting role than star which is sad. The amazing acting here comes from the three male stars. Kevin James looks like he got into better shape for this film and not only does he handle the comedy scenes well he actually turns in a great performance while he's at it. For me he's always been a good actor but relied too often on comedy. Here he has a chance to shine.Having grown up with the Fonz years ago I've witnessed Winkler do some good roles and some bad ones. This movie gives him a chance to stretch as well. Unlike James he does a good job with the dramatic part his role gives him but does even better with the comedy. Alongside Winkler in Voss' corner is Bas Rutten who does an amazing job for this being his first real major role. He offers a tender character but has some hilarious moments as well.I guess the best thing this film has going for it is that it entertains. There are a lot of movies out there these days that don't seem to do that, ones that struggle to be funny but aren't or that try to touch your heart but don't come close. This is one movie that does both. I know it's one that will find a place on my shelf which means it will be watched more than once. While we may not know the real story this was based on everyone will have a chance to root for the little guy and to enjoy the story that's told.",4,A TRUE HERO,1362614400,"03 7,

If you saw the trailer and thought this movie is about a guy who teaches, and needs to raise some money, so he risks his body to join the UFC to raise the dough, then you would be right. He wins over the love of a woman, as well as the class he teaches... there is not really anymore to say about the plot... what you thought it would be, is exactly what you get.The acting is what you expect. If you like Kevin James, Salma Hayek & The Fonz in a a typical movie like a PG Rated Happy Madison family movie, then by all means, see it if you haven't. If that isn't something you would watch, then you probably have already decided not to see it by now anyway.Personally I thought the comedy was something that was just present. It was there, nothing that made me burst out laughing, but you won't mistake this as a drama or anything else, there is nothing you will kick yourself for missing out on from this film. However, like all movies like this, it rams as much heart into it as it possibly can to make a typical Disney fairy-tale ending, and I dunno if it's just because I have seen a million movies where the underdog comes out on top and lives happily ever after, but I thought it was just another done-it-before, done-to-death plot that this time changes the sport to UFC.Look I'm not saying it's a terrible movie, I watched it from start to finish and wasn't yawning away and wanting to turn it off... but once it was over, I have no ambition to see it ever again. It is was it is, and personally I don't think it is anything special, nor something I would want to own my very own copy of.Overall: Worthy of an overnight rental, but to purchase it?

So, I think I understand why some folks can write one star review of this film. However, I suspect it has to do more with them than the film itself. More on that in a bit.Why I like this film:* This film was soft-core Capra at is best* Redemption and simple heroics at its core* Henry Winkler, who I will watch any day anywhere - even that lousy Viet Nam flick from the 70's.* Bas Rutten - Who is simultaneously Goofy and Dangerous. I hate cameos by athletes that can't act. Bas rocks in this film. The stuff between him and Henry is really fun.* Krzysztof Soszynski - who was willing to get his **** kicked on film by a comedian that could clearly not kick his ass.* This simplicity of the storyline* Selma Hayek - Always beautiful, and this may be the first time I have ever seen her teeth when she smiles* And finally, I am a bit envious of the fact that Kevin was able to make a film that allowed him to get in such good shape. Paid to play.Back to the naysayers; you cannot expect every film with a comedian in it to make you laugh. On one side you have films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or The Number 23 that have no laughs with one of the funniest men in the world. Films clearly meant to show that Jim Carrey can act.Here comes the Boom on the other hand, is an attempt to show there is irony and comedy even in the most intense situations. This is the classic `one man against the system' film showing that it takes effort and you can pay a price for doing the right thing.Some people want Kevin to be a clown. This film would have been bad if he had played it for laughs. Instead he played it like a hero; the common man that, in a time of crisis, rises to the occasion.This film will make you laugh occasionally.

The biology teacher points his shoes to the principal in staff meeting, attends the school with jeans, dressing like a construction worker, standing on top of lab desk to teach biology. All extreme, improper conducts that disseminate terrible values among the already troubled urban students.Standing for another teacher, altruistic commitment to save fellow's tenure, were all exceptional endeavors seldom encountered within the doggy-bent mentality of educators-administrators culture, where administrators must kiss up to noisy, influential parents, teachers crushed by troubled kids, boards of education dominated by irrelevant political hacks. But this biology teacher, of course in movies alone, found his way into marshal art as a way to raise the $48K needed to keep the music teacher employed.Wresting lessons played a distractive element as the viewer learns about defensive fighting when not prepared to attack, which might turn lethal. The biology teacher fighting to lose, for the sole purpose of raising money must learn to balance his desire to attack versus staying alive in a dangerous sport. The climax of the story summed by the music teacher came beautifully succinct: Learning is about struggle to overcome surmounting obstacles.The two-hour long movie was fun to watch, with the heavily muscular wresting coach learning to become naturalized citizen, extremely funny biology teacher conveying the New Yorkers' style of easy going sociable demeanor, and the docile music teacher conveying the sense of hopelessness of a gifted educator.Mohamed F.

The opening scenes really confirmed my opinion about the rest of the movie.  The character played by Kevin James of King of Queens fame is a biology teacher who is a slacker.  He shows up late for his class and proceeds to read the newspaper in front of the kids and as we must concur, he is ""burned out"", hasn't had a vacation in awhile so he takes it out on the students.  He also teaches a citizenship class at night and spends most of it insulting the immigrants who are trying to learn about how the US works.  He suddenly gets inspired to become a ""good guy"" when his buddy, the music teacher played by Henry Winkler is about to lose his job because of budget cuts.  We've all heard that budget story before in the schools!  Yawn!  Aside from Kevin James the cast was stellar, like Henry Winkler and Salma Hayek.  Their scripts were not.  There are so many good films out there about teachers who made a difference that this movie just pales in comparison.  Most of the movies are based on true stories like Music From The Heart, Knights Of The South Bronx, Take The Lead, Mr. Holland's Opus, and many more. This story was just so unbelievable, and in my opinion, didn't even have any funny moments.

I had heard Joe Rogan say that the movie was very good when it came out but I thought he was just following the company line. I was mistaken! This is truly a funny movie, that anyone that follows MMA will have a great time watching.Several UFC stars make an appearance, including Chael Sonnen, Wanderlei Silva and Mayhem Miller among other fighters, Joe Rogan, Stitch, Herb Dean and the well-known coach Mark DellaGrotte. Now, don't expect this movie to show you some nice MMA action; that is not the point. It is all about finding something that matters in life and putting your mind to it. Talking about that, Kevin James, who plays Scott Voss, a high school biology teacher that has lost the fire and starts to get it back when he decides to help save the music program in the school, took some time in building himself up in terms of his physique. There is a markedly huge difference vs. his King of Queens character.Of course as in most comedies there is some romance, and it is done in just the right amount. The story has enough of a touchy-feely too and strikes a nice balance in this sense. They do a decent job with trying to jerk a few tears from the touch UFC fan crowd.The part I am not sure I understand is that one of the main fights is with Krzysztof Soszyinski, but instead of appearing in the movie with his real name, like the others do, he goes by Ken Dietrich. He still maintains the characteristics of the real UFC fighter, but not sure why they chose to change the name. There are also some references than only UFC fans will get, such as ""Showtime kick"", but I think that people that do not follow MMA still can have a good time with this movie.",4,"""Without music, life would be a mistake""",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1780,"['am', 'huge', 'UFC', 'fan', 'even', 'being', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'had', 'heard', 'Joe', 'Rogan', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'following', 'company', 'line', 'was', 'mistaken', 'truly', 'funny', 'movie', 'anyone', 'MMA', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'watching.Several', 'UFC', 'stars', 'make', 'appearance', 'including', 'Chael', 'Sonnen', 'Wanderlei', 'Silva', 'Mayhem', 'Miller', 'other', 'fighters', 'Joe', 'Rogan', 'Stitch', 'Herb', 'Dean', 'well-known', 'coach', 'Mark', 'DellaGrotte', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'show', 'nice', 'MMA', 'action', 'not', 'point', 'finding', 'something', 'matters', 'life', 'putting', 'mind', 'Talking', 'Kevin', 'James', 'who', 'Scott', 'Voss', 'high', 'school', 'biology', 'teacher', 'lost', 'fire', 'get', 'back', 'when', 'help', 'save', 'music', 'program', 'school', 'took', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'terms', 'physique', 'markedly', 'huge', 'difference', 'vs.', 'King', 'Queens', 'character.Of', 'course', 'most', 'comedies', 'romance', 'done', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'story', 'enough', 'touchy-feely', 'too', 'nice', 'balance', 'sense', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'trying', 'jerk', 'few', 'tears', 'touch', 'UFC', 'fan', 'crowd.The', 'part', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'understand', 'one', 'main', 'fights', 'Krzysztof', 'Soszyinski', 'instead', 'appearing', 'movie', 'real', 'name', 'others', 'do', 'Ken', 'Dietrich', 'still', 'characteristics', 'real', 'UFC', 'fighter', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'chose', 'change', 'name', 'are', 'also', 'references', 'only', 'UFC', 'fans', 'will', 'get', 'such', 'Showtime', 'kick', 'think', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'follow', 'MMA', 'still', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'movie']",Here Comes the Boom

It was mildly amusing at times, but unfortunately it wasn't great. Here's the pros and cons:PROS:1. The actors are good - Kevin James is so likable and he's got great comic ability. We've seen him live at a comedy club and we laughed until it hurt. In this movie there were some moments that were pretty funny, but most of them were in the trailer.Salma Heyak is always beautiful and a great actress, and Henry Winkler was great as always.2. The message - Some of the message of the movie was decent, but some of it wasn't what I'd want to teach my kids.Cons:1. A poor script - It was totally unbelievable on so many levels, which is fine if it's a very funny movie, but unfortunately it usually wasn't. The character development was not only thin, but the things Kevin James character did was utterly out of character. It kind of made me tune out.2. GRAPHIC VIOLENCE - I couldn't believe all the children in the theater given the level of graphic violence and blood. I found Hunger Games to be far less violent. I was cringing and covering my eyes at times. This took up a large portion of the movie. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR PRE-TEENS.So for those older than pre-teens this movie might be worth watching on cable if there's nothing else better to watch, or if you're a huge mixed martial arts fan.Sorry Kevin James - we love you, but Hitch is the best movie you've made and I hope you find others as good.

Then you hear the news that someone who's been doing the job even longer and still makes an effort is about to be fired. Do you let it happen?Scott Voss (played by Kevin James) is a 42 year-old biology teacher. Ten years ago, he was given a Teacher of the Year award but when we join the story, he's sleeping late, making little or no effort in the classroom and seen as an embarrassment by the principal, Mr. Betcher (played by Greg Germann).  When Betcher (Germann) catches him sneaking into class late via the classroom window, he gives Voss parking lot duty and strips him of a vacation day. Rather than accept more work that he's in no way interested in doing, he tries to find someone to fill in for him. His colleague, Marty, the music teacher (played by Henry Winkler) is more than willing to assume the responsibility but also a little shaken by the news that his wife is pregnant. Later, at a school board budget meeting, he's given the even more troubling news that thanks to budget problems, the music program is in jeopardy. Voss, despite his long-standing apathy, offers to raise money to save the music program and his colleague's job. He resumes the job of teaching citizenship classes in night school but sees that the wages would make it near-impossible to earn the money in time. One of his students, Niko (played by Bas Rutten) asks for additional tutoring and Voss agrees, reluctantly. It is during a tutoring session at Niko's apartment that Voss, who wrestled in college, sees a mixed martial arts match, learns that the loser was paid $10,000, and decides he can raise the money by joining this very punishing sport.Now, the last Kevin James movie that I saw in theaters was Zookeeper. I wasn't impressed. I won't say that Here Comes the Boom was impressive, but it was easily a step up from Zookeeper. Also, naming the movie after what would eventually become the main character's theme song isn't particularly creative. Still, I was entertained. Watching an overweight 42 year-old enter the ring and take serious punishment over and over...and over was hilarious and watching the effect his decision to make an effort had, not just on him but on the entire cast of characters, was bizarrely uplifting.

1479840,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B005LAII1W,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[8, 13]","Judging by the general premise - comical underdog goes up against impossible odds to save school program and get the girl - Here Comes the Boom was probably intended to be a B-grade Hollywood formula movie.  And to be honest, about half of it is just that and nothing more.  But the other half of Here Comes the Boom will surprise you with some outstanding performances and moments of pure grace that make the film definitely worth the price of admission.Scott Voss (Kevin James) is a 42-year-old biology high school teacher who was voted Teacher of the Year... ten years ago.  Nowadays Scott can barely motivate himself to show up, let alone motivate his students.  Or the school nurse, Bella Flores (Salma Hayek) who keeps shooting him down every time he tries to ask her out.  This abruptly changes however at a staff meeting where Principal Betcher (Greg Germann) announces that, due to a $48K budget shortfall, all extracurricular programs at the school are being cut, including the music program taught by Scott's friend Marty (Henry Winkler), an older teacher who's just learned that his wife is about to have another baby.  Knowing what the loss of his job would mean to Marty, Scott stands up and to everyone's surprise, including his own, vows to find some way to raise the needed money to save the music program and Marty's job.Actually coming up with the money however - which Scott has to do by the end of the semester - proves to be a seemingly impossible challenge.  He takes a second job teaching a night-school class helping immigrants prepare for their citizenship examination, but the extra money isn't going to be anywhere near enough to reach the $48K needed.  The class does however bring him into contact with an eager immigrant from Holland named Niko (a marvelous scene-stealing Bas Rutten) who needs some extra tutoring for the exam. When Scott goes over to Niko's place for a tutoring session, he is drawn by Niko and a couple of his buddies into watching a UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) match that's already underway on the TV.  He learns that Niko used to be an MMA (mixed martial arts) fighter himself before injuries sidelined him.  More importantly, he learns that the loser in a UFC match receives $10K for the fight.  And suddenly Scott sees a way he can get the money he needs for the school.  After all, he used to be on the wrestling team in college.  And how hard could losing be, right?A lot harder than he was expecting, Scott discovers, when Niko reluctantly agrees to train him.  Aside from the grueling effort required for an out of shape 42-year-old trying to get back into the kind of shape he was in twenty years earlier, there's the matter of his having to take a serious beating on a daily basis in the process.  After the first couple of sessions Scott is ready to throw in the towel.  But he soon finds he's got too many people in his corner to even think of quitting.  Besides good-natured Niko and his fighting buddies, there's one of his students, Malia (Charice) to whom Marty's music program really matters and who pitches in by helping Niko study for his citizenship exam while Scott's busy training.  Bella, though she thinks Scott is crazy, does her part by helping to patch him up, gradually warming up to him in the process.  And Marty himself is helping out in his well-meaning but frequently clueless way, but it is Marty who ends up making one of the most significant contributions to Scott's effort.  When another fighter steals the walk-in song Scott was using - P.O.D.'s ""Boom"" - Marty ends up substituting Neal Diamond's ""Holy, Holy"", which becomes Scott's signature theme when he ends up unexpectedly winning the match.  And when the video of his win goes viral - mainly because Scott throws up on his opponent - he finds that the whole student body is suddenly rooting for him.  Bout by punishing bout, Scott slowly but steadily raises the money for the school, and soon his underdog rise gets him the attention of the UFC and he finds himself on the undercard for the UFC's big night in Las Vegas.  But just when it looks like Scott's win-by-losing plan is going to be able to save the school's music program, an unexpected development throws his entire effort off the rails and suddenly he's faced with the impossible prospect that he now must actually win his fight - and the $50K prize - in order to save the day.The basic plot, as you can see, is very familiar thematic ground, a mash-up of Rocky and Mr. Holland's Opus and a hundred similar movies that have been standard Hollywood fare for decades.  In addition to the not overly imaginative script, which also suffers from subplots that distract rather than really contribute, the film also suffers from Frank Coraci's somewhat erratic direction.  Coraci's record as a comedy director is mixed.  His biggest successes were the films he with Adam Sandler - The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer (both 1998) and Click (2006).  The rest of his record is less stellar, consisting of the middling Zookeeper (2011) and the outright bomb Around the World in 80 Days (2004).  In Here Comes the Boom, Coraci's biggest weakness as a director is that there are far too many what I call ""dead fish"" moments where a scene clearly isn't working but the film lingers on it, as if hoping that it will somehow get funny if given more time.  Which it invariably doesn't, causing the film to really drag in places.But all that said, two things make Here Comes the Boom rise above what one would usually expect of this kind of film:  the performances and the fight scenes.  Kevin James makes his Scott Voss character believable as the improbable hero, the likeable but seemingly apathetic shlub who surprises himself by stepping up when no one else does.  Who time and again wants to quit but can't bring himself to let the people who depend on him down.  And in the key moments, James convinces you that, for all of his goofiness, Scott does indeed have what it takes to put himself through considerable pain for a cause he's committed himself to.  Salma Hayek is somewhat miscast as Bella - seriously, did anyone ever have a school nurse that stunningly gorgeous? -  but does a creditable job of being the down to earth no-nonsense object of Scott's romantic interest, particularly in one comic scene where she proceeds to take him down like a practice dummy - having grown up with four older brothers, she's clearly learned a thing or two - trying to show him that he doesn't know what he's getting into with the MMA plan.  Henry Winkler shines as the music teacher Marty, showing a man who truly loves what he does and who cares deeply about his work and his students - you can easily see why Scott would go to bat for him - but who is clearly out of his depth on anything else, always well-meaning but frequently clueless.  Winkler is surprisingly deft with comedy, turning the most ordinary lines into delightfully comic moments simply by the voice and facial expressions he uses to deliver them.Two other excellent performances are Charice's Malia, the student who has Scott as her biology teacher and Marty as her music teacher, and Bas Rutten's roughly genial Niko, the former MMA fighter who now teaches yoga and jazzercise classes at the community college.  Charice, whom most people would only know from the Sunshine Corazon character she played in three episodes of the TV series Glee, is infectiously appealing, projecting worry and upbeat optimism as the scene requires.  One of the movie's best scenes involves Malia coaching and encouraging Niko for his citizenship exam, and another is when she and the other music students unexpectedly turn up at Scott's climactic bout to cheer - and sing - him on.  But it is Bas Rutten's Niko who brings the most natural humor to the film, shamelessly playing his role to the hilt and stealing virtually every scene he's in.  A former MMA fighter himself, Rutten is perfect for the role, but in addition to having the background, Rutten is gifted with one of those faces that, when he grins at you, you feel an overwhelming compulsion to grin back.  He just radiates a kind of empathy that draws you in.  So you completely buy into the comedic situation of this rough-looking guy who used to fight for a living now getting up in spandex to lead classes of women in burning fat away by working out on stationary bikes with a disco ball sparkling overhead.  The man has a brilliant future as a character actor if he wants it, which I hope he does as I'd love to see more of him in future films.Another really well-done feature of the film is the way the fight scenes - and the martial arts scene in general - were done, in no small part due to the involvement of a lot of actual MMA fighters and personalities.  Some are in the film playing themselves, like UFC announcers Joe Rogan, Mike Goldberg and Bruce Buffer, MMA referee Herb Dean, and Muay Thai trainer Mark DellaGrotta.  Actual UFC fighters Wanderlei Silva, Chael Sonnen, Brian Stann and Rich Franklin make appearances.  And UFC fighter Krzysztof Soszynski has a key role as Ken ""The Executioner"" Dietrich, the inhumanly scary-looking fighter Scott finds himself up against in the climactic fight in Las Vegas.  The actual involvement of so many prominent people from the UFC and MMA world gives Here Comes the Boom a level of realism that it could not otherwise have achieved, and I'm sure that their input is the reason that the fight scenes come across as realistic as they do. You really do feel like Kevin James is going through some real smack-downs in the course of the film.Recommended for anyone who likes Kevin James and/or a feel-good underdog-against-the-odds comedy which manages to be better than you'd expect.  And in particular for Bas Rutten's unexpectedly delightful performance.",4,Better than expected comedy with good performances and lots of MMA action,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,9821,"['Judging',
