Bloodrayne is bad but this one is worse.The only thing that is accurate is the tunnels. Most of the sections are just big enough to fit one person. And he must crawl. He can't stand or sit in it. Only when he arrives at the main compartment, then it will become as big as a room. That room can hold many people. That's exactly what the tunnels are in reality. They're amazing achievements. They can withstand bombings from air raids. You can read more about them in ""The Tunnels of Cu Chi"" by Tom Mangold and John Penycate. The ISBN is 0425089517.All the other aspects of this movie are bad and inaccurate.For example, the helmets of the Viet Cong soldiers in the films are completely different with the real ones. You can see the real ones in films like ""Hamburger Hill"". Viet Cong's helmets in this movie look like Thai soldiers' or some other countries'.The acting and the fighting scenes are terribly bad and boring.

No matter how many universally panned films he makes, he just keeps going, and keeps churning them out one right after the other, and we still keep watching them.  Personally, there's nothing I like better than to have a laugh at one of a number of Uwe's trainwrecks (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne; c'mon, you know the list), but lately, the master of error has churned out some flicks that actually haven't been half bad with Postal and Seed.  Tunnel Rats falls into this category as well, as this time around Uwe steps away from the video game adaptation world and focuses on a too often forgotten part of the Vietnam war, of which tunnel digging played a pivotal role in.  Boll favorite Michael Pare stars as the lieutenant of a group of these soldiers, as Boll offers a bleak and unflinching look at the Vietnam war.  What it lacks in terms of characterizations, Tunnel Rats more than makes up for in keeping the viewer compelled, which is a small miracle in itself.  Not to mention that Boll has a keen eye for carnage here, even if the camerawork and editing isn't always as good as one may hope.  Still, by the time the end credits roll, you'll probably be left thinking just what was the point of the whole thing, but at the same time, Tunnel Rats remains a surprisingly solid, violent, and gritty war flick that is worth giving a shot.",3,Uwe Boll goes to Vietnam,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,1435,"['Uwe', 'Boll', 'kind', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'hate', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'universally', 'panned', 'films', 'just', 'going', 'churning', 'out', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'still', 'keep', 'watching', 'Personally', 'nothing', 'like', 'better', 'have', 'laugh', 'one', 'number', 'Uwe', 'trainwrecks', 'House', 'Dead', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'BloodRayne', ""c'mon"", 'know', 'list', 'lately', 'master', 'error', 'churned', 'out', 'flicks', 'actually', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'half', 'bad', 'Postal', 'Seed', 'Tunnel', 'Rats', 'category', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'Uwe', 'away', 'video', 'game', 'adaptation', 'world', 'focuses', 'too', 'often', 'forgotten', 'part', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'tunnel', 'digging', 'played', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Boll', 'favorite', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'lieutenant', 'group', 'soldiers', 'Boll', 'bleak', 'unflinching', 'look', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'What', 'terms', 'characterizations', 'Tunnel', 'Rats', 'more', 'up', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'compelled', 'small', 'miracle', 'Not', 'mention', 'Boll', 'keen', 'eye', 'carnage', 'here', 'even', 'camerawork', 'editing', ""n't"", 'always', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'may', 'hope', 'Still', 'time', 'end', 'roll', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'left', 'thinking', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'whole', 'thing', 'same', 'time', 'Tunnel', 'Rats', 'surprisingly', 'solid', 'violent', 'gritty', 'war', 'flick', 'worth', 'giving', 'shot']",Tunnel Rats

And to some extent I agree with that assessment; ""gratuitous"" is a word that puts me in mind of the judicial definition of ""obscene"" in that the strictures one must adhere to when using the term are well-nigh impossible to achieve. And yet there is the work of Uwe Boll, which defines gratuitous in every possible way. With Tunnel Rats, Boll has sunk to a new low, even for him. I had hoped that, when directing something that wasn't a videogame adaptation, he might improve a bit. And Seed wasn't completely terrible. But this time, Boll and lead actor Michael Pare team up for the worst movie each has done to date. And that's saying something for both of them.Tunnel Rats follows a platoon in Vietnam (headed by Pare's insane sergeant). You'll recognize a lot of what they go through from Platoon, from which Tunnel Rats borrows liberally. I'm sure it will come as no surprise to the discerning Uwe Boll fan, however, that these characters pack absolutely none of the emotional punch of Platoon, as ham-handed as Oliver Stone was throughout most of its length. The script isn't just stupid, it's aggressively stupid; during the interminable opening half-hour, in which nothing of consequence occurs, there's a scene during which two veterans spend five minutes talking about how people who spend too much time talking in Vietnam get killed. I'm sure that in Uwe Boll's world, that's some subtle form of foreshadowing. Hopefully everyone else recognizes it for the stupidity it really is.It's rare that I find myself offended that I actually spent the entire length of a movie watching it; if it's really that bad, I'll turn it off at whatever point it starts to make my head ache. I've done that no more than a dozen times in my life. And I didn't do it with Tunnel Rats, though I can't for the life of me imagine why. This is the worst movie I've seen in years.

1239111,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B001ULAUF8,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[18, 24]","I do not jump on the bandwagon either way on Uwe's work, if there is a good film I will review it accordingly. Simply, this was a painfully tedious tunnel film, beginning to end. Will try cover in this two sections: film and features.As far as the film goes, there was an earnest attempt at recreating the tunnels, jungle isolation and military equipment. The tedious amount of character discussion leading up to the tunnel infiltration can be a killer (32 minutes of it before the first lid is popped), then you have to stomach over 48 minutes of crawling, digging, repetitively bad writing and a non-existent command structure. There are several outdoor battle scenes quite reminiscent of Predator in the amount of M-60s being swung around one-handed, with believability made even more absent as soldiers stand by as they are blown up by their own planes (for a couple minutes mind you - I figure they should have run after the 1st bomb, or maybe the 20th, but anyway...).The special features contain some nice tidbits for Uwe fans. There is a 14 minute interview of Uwe stating his reasons why the US lost the war in Vietnam and why the film exists. A 10 minute making-of details the thinking and locations of this film (the tunnels were actually all on a stage - not in the jungle as stated by another reviewer here). The best material comes in the form of Uwe and the other actors admitting there was no script - they all wrote their own parts and winged the whole thing. 6 minutes of rightfully deleted scenes rounds out the last feature.A couple more things - Uwe states that the soldiers are ""responsible for the war"" and on more than one occasion stands by his questionable feeling that the main reason the US lost the war was because of the tunnels only...hmmm. BIG SPOILER: the worst part of this whole mess was the entire film becomes pointless when every single person from both sides is killed - makes you feel like the whole time investment in any character was moot.Once more - I am not a hater of Uwe, but this was a very long, boring, poorly written production.",1,"Not a UB hater, just a tedious and bad film",1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,2079,"['do', 'not', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'way', 'Uwe', 'work', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'review', 'accordingly', 'Simply', 'was', 'painfully', 'tedious', 'tunnel', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'Will', 'try', 'cover', 'two', 'sections', 'film', 'features.As', 'far', 'film', 'was', 'earnest', 'attempt', 'recreating', 'tunnels', 'jungle', 'isolation', 'military', 'equipment', 'tedious', 'amount', 'character', 'discussion', 'leading', 'up', 'tunnel', 'infiltration', 'can', 'be', 'killer', '32', 'minutes', 'first', 'lid', 'popped', 'then', 'have', 'stomach', '48', 'minutes', 'crawling', 'digging', 'repetitively', 'bad', 'writing', 'non-existent', 'command', 'structure', 'are', 'several', 'outdoor', 'battle', 'scenes', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'Predator', 'amount', 'M-60s', 'being', 'swung', 'one-handed', 'believability', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'absent', 'soldiers', 'stand', 'are', 'blown', 'up', 'own', 'planes', 'couple', 'minutes', 'mind', 'figure', 'should', 'have', 'run', '1st', 'bomb', 'maybe', '20th', 'anyway', '.The', 'special', 'features', 'contain', 'nice', 'tidbits', 'Uwe', 'fans', '14', 'minute', 'interview', 'Uwe', 'stating', 'reasons', 'why', 'US', 'lost', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'why', 'film', '10', 'minute', 'making-of', 'details', 'thinking', 'locations', 'film', 'tunnels', 'were', 'actually', 'stage', 'not', 'jungle', 'stated', 'reviewer', 'here', 'best', 'material', 'form', 'Uwe', 'other', 'actors', 'admitting', 'was', 'script', 'wrote', 'own', 'parts', 'winged', 'whole', 'thing', '6', 'minutes', 'rightfully', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'out', 'last', 'feature.A', 'couple', 'more', 'things', 'Uwe', 'soldiers', 'are', 'responsible', 'war', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'questionable', 'feeling', 'main', 'reason', 'US', 'lost', 'war', 'was', 'tunnels', 'only', 'hmmm', 'BIG', 'SPOILER', 'worst', 'part', 'whole', 'mess', 'was', 'entire', 'film', 'becomes', 'pointless', 'when', 'single', 'person', 'sides', 'killed', 'feel', 'whole', 'time', 'investment', 'character', 'was', 'moot.Once', 'more', 'am', 'not', 'hater', 'Uwe', 'was', 'very', 'long', 'boring', 'poorly', 'written', 'production']",Tunnel Rats

1239113,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001ULAUF8,trebe,"[7, 7]","In 1968 Tunnel Rats (2008), director Uwe Boll shines a light on a facet of the Viet Nam conflict that is not generally recognized, the tunnel systems in the Cu Chi district of Saigon, Viet Nam, and the ""tunnel rats"", soldiers whose mission was to investigate tunnels, and clear them of any enemy personnel.  Though actual conditions were much worse, the film does a reasonably good job of conveying some sense of what this terrifying duty may have involved.  Taking you into close fitting tunnels, where soldiers with just a flashlight, a knife, and a pistol, face the possibility of horrific death deep underground.Tunnel systems apparently began in Viet Nam in the 1940's, and became more sophisticated, after the Americans arrived and the conflict intensified.  The complex tunnels at Cu Chi, were used by the Viet Cong as places of refuge, and also by the civilian populace, as places to live.  Following circuitous routes, tunnels systems could be very complicated, and were often booby trapped.  Large caverns where people could stand upright were also constructed.  Usually deep below the surface, these spaces served as living areas, medical treatment areas, and even schools.  1968 Tunnel Rats features some of these aspects, but really provides just a tip of an iceberg's view, of how elaborate some of these systems really were.The bulk of the action takes place during a single day, as a squad of tunnel rats is deployed from their jungle basecamp, and finds a tunnel opening while on patrol.  The squad proceeds to investigate, and very shortly encounters a strong enemy presence, when a soldier is graphically skewered with a bamboo pole.  After being attacked by the enemy, what remains of the squad takes refuge in the tunnels.  What happens below ground may seem a little surreal, as the brutal gut level tunnel warfare is not what most are accustomed to, as when one soldier trapped between two dead bodies, must cut his way out.  While the ""rats"" are exploring the tunnels, the US camp is under a full scale attack.  The wild scenes of conventional battle, contrasts with the in close fighting underground.Among many things discussed in the director's commentary track, Boll was seeking to make a statement about the futility of war.  The film was set in 1968 because he believes it was an extremely significant period in time.  And the enemy's use the tunnels was a key factor in the US failing to achieve victory, thus making this an important subject to examine.Uwe Boll is a much maligned filmmaker, which may lead some to dismiss any project he is associated with.  While his view regarding the nature of war may not be entirely cogent, he does deserve some credit for exploring this subject, and incorporating realistic elements.  While the film is graphic and at times extreme, Boll could easily have made things even more gory or brutal.  With a cast of mostly unknowns (save for Michael Pare), and often working from an improvised script, the film doesn't escape being clich&eacute;d or manipulative in some respects, however there is still much about it that is thought provoking, impactful, and insightful.  Conflict at its most basic level, is about survival, not ideology.Boll's commentary with director of photography Mathias Neumann, is a little rambling, but covers many key points.  It is evident that due to past criticism, Boll is a little defensive at times, and hoping that people will give this film a chance.  War isn't about happy endings, and even the ""victors"" usually suffer great losses.  That sometimes there are no winners, would seem to be one of the key points of the film.Parts of the Cu Chi tunnels are today, popular tourist attractions.

He released a promotional title to go along with it, but this was one of his original ideas. This shows, because like most of his 'originals', it's a good premise with poor execution. Really, calling it, 'bad', is almost pointless, because unless otherwise noted, one can just assume and Uwe movie is bad. The question? Is it entertaining?First, this is one of Boll's earlier experiment with the 'Improvisation Method'. This is a film-making technique where a plot outline and character outline is given to each actor, and they improvise all dialogue. In some Boll movies like 'Rampage', this works very well. In '1968: Tunnel Rats'? Not so much. Michael Pare is very good for a B-list actor, and he pulls it off. Almost everyone else however, is a stuttering mess.The action is decent as far as Uwe's movies go, but it's very sub-par if you don't know what to expect. If action or story is what you're going in for, I'd back away from this one, but if what you want is an over-the-top exploitation film, dive right in.Basically, it's an Uwe Boll movie. It's not especially bad, nor is it surprisingly good. Boll fans? give it a watch.
