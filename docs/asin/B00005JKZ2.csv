I mean the plot is even the same. Instead of training Will Smith as an agent, they're training (or re-training) Tommy Lee Jones as a agent.

592845,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JKZ2,A. Estes,"[5, 9]","I loved the first Men in Black. It was so much fun and it was something new and different. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were an unmatchable team and had a great script and superb special effects behind them. The movie was a hit by all means. So naturally there was going to be a sequel. I walked into the theater enthusiastic about this movie and left the theater wondering where I had been during the past 90 minutes. Men In Black 2 is simply the first movie with all of the exciting and interesting plot points deleted. I honestly don't remember much of what happened in this movie, even though I somehow managed to keep awake and endure what was a disaster within it's first 15 minutes. Will Smith's charm and Tommy Lee Jones' subtle sarcasm cannot, and do not carry this movie. The introduction of new characters is completely irrelevant. Lara Flynn Boyle (Stacy from Wayne's World!) plays an alien disguised as a supermodel and Johnny Knoxville (from MTV's Jackass) plays her sidekick with two heads, who I'm sure had a name. I'm not quite sure of what the plot is, but I do know that the aliens are looking for something that would help them completely destroy Earth. (Sounds familiar) All in all, MIB2 is a very horrible film. I got absolutely nothing out of it, but I'm sure there will be many other dim sequels to follow.

It's not only pure commercialism and a cynical quest for extra megabucks on the studios' side or the viewers' urge for more of the same good stuff - even if it's very likely to turn out not as good as it was. What moves me is this joint effort to defy and deny the very concept of finality, unwillingness to say: - Yeah, it was fun while it lasted - let's remember it fondly for what it was. -I remember the excitement and awe that met the initial MIB in the summer of 1997, lots of magazine covers with these two dressed-as-undertakers guys in black neutralizer-proof sunglasses, ready to blast the misbehaving alien visitors and residents to the green goo condition. The concept, the design - in was so fresh, so overwhelmingly new and convincingly detailed, not an imitation nor it seemed imitable.It seems that very freshness of the original made the second helping just barely chewable.Was it the director's fault? Or screenwriters' fault? Or actors'?Surely it was a way downhill for Barry Sonnenfeld after his great success of '97: the planned-as-hilarious but ultimately disappointing Wild Wild West, the other film which name I can't remember - the revisiting of his greatest hit seemed the thing to do. Could he be more inventive? More selective when it came to jokes? More restrained when deciding how many and what kind of monsters this movie needs? Not craving for cheap laughs so much, able to throw in a basket the guy's with the balls under his chin sketch?Will Smith is not as cocky and bristling as he was, he is surrounded by the surprisingly incompetent colleagues whose acts and appearance make you think the MIB's personnel department was eliminated by one of these successful alien raids and now the McDonalds sends them the recruits they consider underqualified to serve the Golden Arches.Tommy Lee Jones looks resurrected, he is very tired - first of and above all, not happy to participate.Earthly Linda Fiorentino is replaced with Lara Flynn Boyle, the female Michael Jackson with ridiculously pushed up mammae - I could feel how they hurt from the strain.It all looks like the once happy TV family is paid handsomely to reunite in the recreated settings to live in front of cameras, to tell the old jokes and try to invent the new ones to the viewers' satisfaction, to endear the audience once more but the resulting show is very strained, unconvincing - and it's so painfully evident.",3,Sad.,1026172800,"07 9, 2002",2002,2517,"['something', 'nearly', 'endearing', 'public', 'studios', 'readiness', 'succumb', 'sequelitis', 'not', 'only', 'pure', 'commercialism', 'cynical', 'quest', 'extra', 'megabucks', 'studios', 'side', 'viewers', 'urge', 'more', 'same', 'good', 'stuff', 'even', 'very', 'likely', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'What', 'joint', 'effort', 'defy', 'deny', 'very', 'concept', 'finality', 'unwillingness', 'say', 'Yeah', 'was', 'fun', 'lasted', 'let', 'remember', 'fondly', 'what', 'was', '-I', 'remember', 'excitement', 'awe', 'met', 'initial', 'MIB', 'summer', '1997', 'lots', 'magazine', 'covers', 'two', 'dressed-as-undertakers', 'guys', 'black', 'neutralizer-proof', 'sunglasses', 'ready', 'blast', 'misbehaving', 'alien', 'visitors', 'residents', 'green', 'goo', 'condition', 'concept', 'design', 'was', 'so', 'fresh', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'new', 'convincingly', 'detailed', 'not', 'imitation', 'seemed', 'imitable.It', 'very', 'freshness', 'original', 'made', 'second', 'helping', 'just', 'barely', 'chewable.Was', 'director', 'fault', 'screenwriters', 'fault', 'actors', 'Surely', 'was', 'way', 'downhill', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'great', 'success', ""'97"", 'planned-as-hilarious', 'ultimately', 'disappointing', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'other', 'film', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'revisiting', 'greatest', 'hit', 'seemed', 'thing', 'do', 'Could', 'be', 'more', 'inventive', 'More', 'selective', 'when', 'came', 'jokes', 'More', 'restrained', 'when', 'deciding', 'how', 'many', 'what', 'kind', 'monsters', 'movie', 'Not', 'craving', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'so', 'much', 'able', 'throw', 'basket', 'guy', 'balls', 'chin', 'sketch', 'Will', 'Smith', 'not', 'cocky', 'bristling', 'was', 'surrounded', 'surprisingly', 'incompetent', 'colleagues', 'acts', 'appearance', 'make', 'think', 'MIB', 'personnel', 'department', 'was', 'eliminated', 'one', 'successful', 'alien', 'raids', 'now', 'McDonalds', 'recruits', 'consider', 'underqualified', 'serve', 'Golden', 'Arches.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'resurrected', 'very', 'tired', 'first', 'not', 'happy', 'participate.Earthly', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'replaced', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'female', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'ridiculously', 'pushed', 'up', 'mammae', 'could', 'feel', 'how', 'hurt', 'strain.It', 'once', 'happy', 'TV', 'family', 'paid', 'handsomely', 'reunite', 'recreated', 'settings', 'live', 'front', 'cameras', 'tell', 'old', 'jokes', 'try', 'invent', 'new', 'ones', 'viewers', 'satisfaction', 'endear', 'audience', 'once', 'more', 'resulting', 'show', 'very', 'strained', 'unconvincing', 'so', 'painfully', 'evident']",N/A

There is a trailer; a teaser; an ad for the MIB Deluxe edition; trailers for Spider Man, Ghostbusters and Mask of Zorro; a fun animated short, The Chubb Chubbs; and a Crossfire game demo (which didn't work on my computer).

592861,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JKZ2,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 3]","It has been five years since we last saw the adventures of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as the men in black. Has it been worth the wait?. The answer is a definite 'yes'. Is it a new, fresh concept that has evolved from the original film?. No. In fact, it follows pretty much the same style as the first. As if the makers looked over the first film's blue prints and added this and that, but kept the overall shape of it. Does this matter in any way?. Not in the least. What we get here is a fun ride that knows it's a fun ride and doesn't pretend to be anything but just that. Why should we expect anything else?. Will returns as Agent J, who is now assigned to another partner(Played by the always watchable Patrick Warburton). After the first few minutes, this new partner is out of the picture and Will is left without a partner. In the meantime, an alien has landed on earth and has taken the form of a Victoria's Secret model(Played by Lara Flynn Boyle). This alien is looking for the light, which is just a flimsy plot idea that'll cause the complete destruction of earth or something rather. Does it really matter?. The whole idea of this and the details towards the end are sketchy and don't pan out. Oh well. The gorgeous Rosario Dawson(""Josie And The Pussycats"")plays Laura Vasquez, an eye witness to an encounter with Boyle. Will immediatley takes a liking to her and doesn't alter her mind with the zapper. Rip Torn is back and orders Will to go and recruit Agent K(Jones), whom he zapped at the end of the original. K is now head postal worker at a post office in Massachussettes. J comes to get him and it is a good scene. He brings K back and puts him thru a deneuralyzer to regain his memory. Slowly but surely, he does. The movie is a big cartoon. It does what it does and makes no apologies for it. It doesn't need too. Once again, the whole film lies on the on screen chemistry between Jones and Smith. Like in the first, the duo are perfect together. There is just something that works between them. It's nice seeing them together. The make-up for all of the monsters are fantastic. It's the work of make-up genius Rick Baker. Do we expect anything less than magnificent from him?. The effects are all quite good, but the make-up is better. The cast is good. Johnny Knoxville(who I am no fan of by any means)was actually funny. Lara Flynn is no Vincent D'Onofrio, but she does the best with what she is given. She is not bad at all. Tony Shalhoub returns from the original in a very good segment. Rosario Dawson is a find. She seems like a good actress, nice person, and she is beautiful. Comedian David Cross pops up in a funny cameo, as does Peter Graves. There is one other involving a certain Mr. J that I won't tell. Frank The Pug and the worm guys are hilarious. They should have their own movie. The movie runs fast and smooth. It clocks in at only 88 minutes or so, much shorter than the original, and it feels like it. It just takes off and keeps going, zipping by at a nice pace. In the end, ""MIB II"" is not gonna win an award at the Cannes Film Festival, or be entered in the Sundance Film Festival, but it is great fun. It is what it is and no one should expect anything more. It delivers.

This flick smells of Hollywood executives having a bit of extra money lying around and itching to make a few more bucks off this premise.

592880,A3A7CBLO6JGY4F,B00005JKZ2,"Daniel Garris ""YoSoyTylerDurden""","[2, 4]","Men in Black II begins with a delightful opening sequence that plays as a parody of the first film. In what also serves as a precursor to the story to come, the Men in Black concept is made fun of through the presentation of an over-the-top underground video that consists of poorly constructed special effects and a story that would be rejected by even the least known science-fiction television serial. When the sequence reappears at a later point in the film, the comment is made that it must be something from Spielberg. Had the rest of the film captured the playful mood of this opening sequence, Men in Black II would have been right on par with its predecessor. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen.The biggest problem with Men in Black II is that it simply isn't very entertaining as nothing much happens throughout the majority of the film (a quality that makes the film feel much longer than its 88 minute running time suggests). Given the summer-popcorn nature of the film this would have been somewhat forgivable had the problem only plagued the plot. But the same problem also plagues the film's action sequences, special effects and jokes (a problem that is compounded for anybody who has seen the film's trailer before seeing the film). There isn't enough of the devices that made the first film so much fun, and when such devices do appear, they often feel recycled from the first film and or were already revealed in this film's marketing campaign. Its almost as if the film is running on cruise control.So what does happen in Men in Black II? Mostly just a lot of Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) traveling back and forth throughout New York City in an attempt to stop the evil alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) from destroying the planet. Every now and then there is a plot twist that comes out of the blue, with such twist usually revolving around the romance between Agent J and Rita (the only witness to a murder committed by Serleena early in the film). The character development of Rita (Rosario Dawson) is developed to a much lesser extent than the character of Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino) in the first film. This feels highly awkward given the importance Rita plays in both the love story and eventually, the narrative as a whole. The end result is a love story that makes the something-to-be-desired love stories of both Spider-Man and Attack of the Clones look much more impressive in comparison. At least both of those films tried.One area of Men in Black II that still works, at least to a certain extent, is its use of aliens for comedic value. While many of the non-alien based jokes fall flat, the film's use of alien-based jokes is the one aspect that comes closest to duplicating the enjoyable nature of the first film. Return appearances by the worms, Fred the talking dog, and especially the appearance of a new alien-race who live inside of a locker, provide some of the film's better moments. But such moments are too few in between, and for every moment that does work in this regard, there seems to be an equally unfunny moment just around the corner (with many of them involving the two-headed alien played by Johnny Knoxville).In any area of comparison, Men in Black II doesn't live up to its predecessor. The first film succeeded in being a strong piece of summer entertainment, that stood out from the rest of the summer crowd at the same time. Men in Black II does neither, when it could have and should have done both.*1/2, (4.5/10)",2,A Sequel that Never Should have Seen the Light of Day,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,3500,"['Men', 'Black', 'II', 'delightful', 'opening', 'sequence', 'parody', 'first', 'film', 'what', 'also', 'precursor', 'story', 'come', 'Men', 'Black', 'concept', 'made', 'fun', 'presentation', 'over-the-top', 'underground', 'video', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'rejected', 'even', 'least', 'known', 'science-fiction', 'television', 'serial', 'When', 'sequence', 'reappears', 'later', 'point', 'film', 'comment', 'made', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'Spielberg', 'Had', 'rest', 'film', 'captured', 'playful', 'mood', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'par', 'predecessor', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'happen.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'entertaining', 'nothing', 'much', 'majority', 'film', 'quality', 'film', 'feel', 'much', 'longer', '88', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'Given', 'summer-popcorn', 'nature', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'forgivable', 'had', 'problem', 'only', 'plagued', 'plot', 'same', 'problem', 'also', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'jokes', 'problem', 'compounded', 'anybody', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'trailer', 'seeing', 'film', ""n't"", 'enough', 'devices', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'when', 'such', 'devices', 'do', 'appear', 'often', 'feel', 'recycled', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'already', 'revealed', 'film', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'almost', 'film', 'running', 'cruise', 'control.So', 'what', 'happen', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'Mostly', 'just', 'lot', 'Agent', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Agent', 'K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'traveling', 'back', 'forth', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'attempt', 'stop', 'evil', 'alien', 'Serleena', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'destroying', 'planet', 'now', 'then', 'plot', 'twist', 'blue', 'such', 'twist', 'usually', 'revolving', 'romance', 'Agent', 'J', 'Rita', 'only', 'witness', 'murder', 'committed', 'Serleena', 'early', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'Rita', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'developed', 'much', 'lesser', 'extent', 'character', 'Laurel', 'Weaver', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'first', 'film', 'highly', 'awkward', 'given', 'importance', 'Rita', 'love', 'story', 'eventually', 'narrative', 'whole', 'end', 'result', 'love', 'story', 'something-to-be-desired', 'love', 'stories', 'Spider-Man', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'comparison', 'least', 'films', 'tried.One', 'area', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'still', 'least', 'certain', 'extent', 'use', 'aliens', 'comedic', 'value', 'many', 'non-alien', 'based', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'film', 'use', 'alien-based', 'jokes', 'one', 'aspect', 'closest', 'duplicating', 'enjoyable', 'nature', 'first', 'film', 'Return', 'appearances', 'worms', 'Fred', 'talking', 'dog', 'especially', 'appearance', 'new', 'alien-race', 'who', 'live', 'locker', 'provide', 'film', 'better', 'moments', 'such', 'moments', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'moment', 'work', 'regard', 'be', 'equally', 'unfunny', 'moment', 'just', 'corner', 'many', 'involving', 'two-headed', 'alien', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', '.In', 'area', 'comparison', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'predecessor', 'first', 'film', 'succeeded', 'being', 'strong', 'piece', 'summer', 'entertainment', 'stood', 'out', 'rest', 'summer', 'crowd', 'same', 'time', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'done', '*1/2', '4.5/10']",N/A

Tommy plays a wonderful straight man to Smith's zaniness.I went to see Men in Black II last week, and I found that it fit like a thoroughly used, but still kind of comfortable glove.  It's nowhere near as good as the first one, and it suffers from recycling too many of the jokes as well.  The talking dog returns in a much more prominent role, the worms are back as well and have more to do.  While funny (listening to the dog sing Gloria Gaynor is hilarious), ultimately they don't work as well in expanded roles.  It feels almost like running the joke into the ground.  A much more successful return is the ever-wonderful Tony Shalhoub as Jeebs.  He's in for one scene, but he's still great.Lara Flynn Boyle completely fails, in my opinion, as Serleena.  First, she doesn't play menacing very well.  Secondly, she doesn't seem to handle the wry humour and the quips that a villain in a picture like this requires.  She comes across as very flat.  Thankfully, Rip Torn is wonderful, and Jones and Smith slip into their comfortable roles very easily.  They really make the movie.The film is very short (88 minutes), which also tends to make it seem rushed.  The characters jump from place to place without much reason.  When reason is given, it's usually very quickly so as to move the plot along to the next set piece.It was a funny film.  No doubt about that.  It was worth the [money] that I paid for it.

This film lacked the humor and innovation of part one, and the character development style was just plain goofy.

Serleena, the Victoria's-Secret-model enemy, was non-threatening, no matter how invincible they attempted to make her (she died at least 3 times).

Will Smith as the cackling braggadacio clashes with the deadpan jaded Tommy Lee Jones elicit a raucous comic riot. Boyle as the man-eating Serleena adds to the good fun - what along with old-time nostalgics like Jeebs (Tony Shalboub), The worm Guys and Frank The Pug to complement the new interlopers such as the two-headed bozo minion Scrad/Charlie (Johnny Knoxville).That aside, Men In Black II isn't as fresh nor funny as its predecessor in 1997, a spin-off of a Malibu Comics title to emerge surprisingly as a sleeper hit that became a stellar phenomenonal blockbuster chalking up earnings of 587 million dollars.

I couldn't even laugh at the line about the 'black dude getting pulled over' as I must of heard this line five times previous.

Different groups would laugh at different times while the rest of the audience sat in silience at the comedy.

Will Smith was charming and funny as usual, as was Tommy Lee Jones; however, the plotline lacked punch and flavor. The standard Plague of the Sequel (using likeable cameo characters from the first film far too much) of course rears its ugly head here; the worm guys are more prevalent, as is Frank the Pug dog, and (unsurprisingly) they lose a lot of their amusement factor when they're shoved into larger roles than they were originally created for.Lara Flynn Boyle definitely didn't carry her role off as well as Vincent D'Onofrio carried his - she seemed more like a passive part of the film, whereas Vincent just blew me out of the water with how totally *into* his role he went. The banter between Smith & Jones is probably the highlight of the film, as the love story doesn't develop too deeply, and the other characters are largely very superficial. Even Tony Shaloub's reprise of his role didn't work as well this time around. It's like everything in the film just lost some of it's ""oomph,"" somehow.""MIB II"" isn't a *bad* film, but the first was sooo much fun, and this one can't hold a candle to it; I'm amazed that the same writer is responsible for the second installment. The first film was clever and unusual and full of wonderful and hysterical surprises, whereas this one seems to struggle a bit; they go for a lot of obvious, ""gimme"" laughs, and not much made me grin that big, happy grin of being pleasantly surprised by a film's creativity.

592913,A342AZPTC0QE57,B00005JKZ2,Gaz,"[13, 19]","There is a sad fact about movies: If it makes money, it'll likely get a cashin sequel. Even remakes like Doctor Dolittle manage it - anything to bring in a few extra bucks. But when 5 years exist between original and sequel, surely it's not a case of acute cashin sequilitis?Alas, yes. This movie took similar time to materialise to Star Wars Episode I... yet somehow, it still managed to add so very little to the excellent film that was Men In Black. Now there was a class act of a blockbuster. Decent effects, yes, but it boasted Tommy Lee Jones' fantastic restrained-yet-hilarious performance, delivering excellent lines with perfect speed; it had a decent script; and obviously it offered a new slant on the alien conspiracy theory idea. It was great, even ending with a lovely unnecessary but really effective existencial visual.MIB2 falls flat on its face because, instead of saying ""Hey, what more could happen with the Men in Black,"" they simply re-do the original film, albeit with less impact and a far-too-great sense of self mockery. The list of problems is as follows: The story is a virtual rewrite. ""The Galaxy"" is substituted for ""The Light"" (quite what said Light is, we are not told); The Bug is substituted for Serleena; The new/old agent theme is still present, albeit the roles are reversed; the story takes similar turns, though slower, with a similar (admittadly effective) ending visual of a similarly perspective-setting nature.Next, Tommy Lee Jones. Before he was restrained and sardonic, for me the highlight of Men in Black... here, he simply looks bored for the duration of his scenes. Clearly just roped in for the cash, and to rescue an already bleak so-called ""plot,"" he seems incapable of that lightning-fast delivery we were so gifted with last time. Will Smith dumbs down his character to seem ever inferior to Jones, which doesn't help his already ""love him or hate him"" fan status.Then, there's the humour. Yes, there's one or two decent lines - the majority of them from Smith after neuralising someone - but there's simply too much of it. Everyone's playing for laughs, even Rip Torn's Z (in a cringe-inducingly awful karate scene), and there are pointless cameos from the likes of Michael Jackson (a wasted oppertunity) and Tony Shalhoub's Jeeves (who simply rehashes the head-shooting joke from the first movie). It tries so hard to amuse, it ends up a simple mockery of the whole concept. The other agents are feeble, one bursting into tears for no reason, the others cowering at the sight of Tommy Lee Jones' character. Humour is a good thing, but constant?Lastly, there's the fact that it could actually have been really good. The film's only decent ideas (Jeffrey the Subway Worm; A super-fast multi-limbed postal worker; The Statue of Liberty neuraliser, etc) are ignored, forgotten or plain wasted. This is in line with various plot mistakes (the guy with two heads disappeared between scenes, not to be seen again) and just acts to annoy us that this film was so nearly a riot.Why did it take 5 years to produce something we'd expect them to take 2 years to do? It's a tired cashin. Even Danny Elfman's music doesn't inspire, and armed with some hefty visuals (one or two actually coming off well, particularly the hilarious ""race who live in a locker"" scenes) it has the look of what it is: The ""bigger, louder sequel"" that accompanies ANY film these days.It's a let down. Worse than that, it's so short that the action slugs along and takes a final mad dash in the closing reel.

The sun is high in the sky beaming that heat down, the grills are going full blast cooking the hotdogs and hamburgers, the fireworks are just about to go off, and Will Smith has a movie out for the 4th of July.  This time it is a sequel to that surprise hit, Men In Black.The story finds Will as Agent Jay, the top agent for the MIB, constantly searching for a replacement for Agent Kay, Tommy Lee Jones, who he had to neuralyze at the end of the previous movie.  Unfortunately Jay is beginning to get a reputation as someone who will use his ""flashy-thing"" at the first problem and most of the other personal at MIB are scared of him.  Even worse an extremely dangerous alien by the name of Serleena, Lara Flynn Boyle, has traveled to earth searching for the Light of Zartha.  Naturally if she gets she will be able to rule the universe.  Even worse than we previously thought, the only person who knows where this Light of Zartha is, is Agent Kay who, since his neuralyzation, has been working as the postmaster of a small town.Jay is sent to retrieve Kay, de-neuralyze him so that he will get his memory back, find the Light of Zartha, and defeat Serleena.  Not bad for a 90 minute movie.OK.  This is MIB ll.  You obviously aren't coming in to see this for serious drama.  You probably aren't coming to see this for serious character development either.  You probably are coming because you are a fan of light action/comedies and are a fan of Will Smith and/or Tommy Lee Jones.  With that groundrule stated, does this movie work?  Yes.The plot is basically superfluous to the movie.  It seems hastily thrown together and comes across more as the plot for an ongoing television series (sequel anyone?) than for a major motion picture.  What moves this along is the acting of the two leads and the relationship between them.I have often said that there is a great lack of chemistry in many romantic movies out there today.  That doesn't apply here at all.  Smith and Jones work perfectly together.  The chemistry that flows between the two is easy and established quite well.  Smith, as Jay, is the gung-ho top guy at MIB until he brings Kay back and then he easily slips right back into the student role.

The plot sounded funny enough, but I felt like a lot of potential humour was lost in the ""Will trying to convince Kay that he was a former agent"" that could have been there.  And, quite frankly, there were many times that it was just too obvious that there was a place where Barry Sonnefeld was going for a laugh but wasn't succeeding.But then something funny happend (no pun intended).  I watched the DVD again, and started to find it at least somewhat humourus, and then after a while longer, flat out hilarious.  Not every part, mind you; but this movie has hilarious subtleties than most of the other reviewers never bothered to notice in their haste to be overly-critical of this movie.  So where the movie tried to be obviously funny, it failed (like when Will goes flying from Jeff the Worm into the subway car and we get a shot of his screaming facial expression).  But the subtle guestures make the whole movie worth while (like the twitch in the mouth and suprise on the face of the alien mail-sorter).So yeah, not the best script in the world.

A movie like MIB (1) deserved a 1000 times better sequel than this turkey Mr. Sonnenfeld has delivered (or thrown?) to us. It started ok, nice chick, great body, funny scene. But as agent J comes to stage everything goes down the drain like the flush scene in the deneuralizer room. I mean, Will Smith was supposed to make us laugh as much as he did in the first one or even more (as everyone was expecting after seeing the trailer which shows the sole funny parts of the entire movie!). Instead his acting is so cheap. bi-dimensional. and ultimately bad that after the scene with the worm thing in the subway I could just predict that the whole movie wasn't going to get any better. I was sort of praying for Tommy Lee Jones to save the ranch, as he is a serious, more experienced and better actor than Smith. Instead, he was acting like shaving on a Monday morning! Spirit-less, like just making it for the paycheck and the pressure over him to pull out a sequel. Any of his lines in the movie are even close to funny whatsoever. And of course, let's skip Jonnhy Knoxville part! I'm just gonna say that he indeed proved what he is, a Jackass! I think that the only savable acting among this bunch of disasters is the dog which had the best lines and gave a sort of relief to the pain coused by the rest of the cast.  Besides this, the special effects are not even close to good, the only acceptable ones where Frank the dog and maybe the flying car, The rest of it....oh boy!! who did this???? same crew as MIB?? what happened to you guys?? had a glitch in the budget and had to change your Silicon Graphics for Comodores 64 to cover it??? I can't believe that in 2002 and with a similar budget to the first movie (made 5 years ago) you can pull off (not even accidentally) such bad special effects like for instance, the Ivy alien, the Worm alien, Jonnhy knowville second head and so many other cheap, close to B-movie SFX that would be only impressive if they had been done 15 years ago! Specially that part when the pod thing mounts fly on the sky in the last part...GEEZ you could even see the residual blue border around the figure of the black girl inside the pod like in movies from the 80's! Unacceptable. period.  This movie sucks, from head to toes. It killed the first movie likewise The Lost World did with Jurassic Park (or even worse). You guys (crew) should put the MIB saga to sleep forever for good. This kind of trash is what I call 'let's forget about art and let's make it just for the money.

This movie had 5 years (and some false-starts) to refine and for the filmmakers to really make it something special for the fans and to pay tribute to the brilliant Men in Black. It never happened.Instead we have a plot (that doesn't even make sense) so wafer thin it's almost invisible and repeats of old scenes. Always, always, always a bad, bad, bad mistake for a sequel. NEVER homage or try to be smart by repeating scenes. John Carpenter did this with Escape from LA and that was lost on almost all audiences. Just like what has happened with MIB II. I did expect this to be a huge hit. But it's gone largely unnoticed because it's asking for money for old rope.David Cross (who played the morgue attendant in the original) has the only funny scene and I swear any other laughs will be no more than exagerated smiles. You'll want to enjoy, but won't. Lara Flynn Boyle is not the uber-[female] her character should have been. And Rosario Dawson has NOTHING to do in her role at all. I don't want to say that she is a bad actress because the part offered her so little to do. Not even so little. It was nothing. Never before in my life have I seen such a pointless character. All she did was stand around with her eyes open in amazement. That's it. Had her character been called Laura MacGuffin instead of Laura Vasquez it would have been a tiny bit acceptable. What IS the deal with that silly 'light' nonsense?Plus the chemistry between Smith and Jones is gone. It's simply not there and there is no spark. Jones originally didn't even want to do this film (Linda Fiorentino was supposed to return) and he seems like someone totally different. First time round he was wise and crafty. Here he is just a gear in the machine. There's no magic. No comic timing.MIB II should have been one of those surprising sequels that blows the original out of the water. Like Gremlins 2 for example. Spielberg was producer on that movie too. It came 6 years after the first. MIB II had 5. And it seems like they just hastily threw it together in a couple of weeks. It is so puzzling.

I was very disappointed in Men In Black II.  I somewhat enjoyed the first film.  Will Smith just seems to be playing the same smart-aleck character in every film he does.  In this one, he is cutting people off in mid-sentence wanting them to shut up.  Being rude and insulting to white people in this film was really a turn off.  Bad writing.  I did not feel there was enough screen time for Mr. Tommy Lee Jones.  Is there even a plot in this film?  Interesting was the cameo appearance of singer/actor/entertainer Michael Jackson.  Perhaps Michael Jackson would  have been better than Will Smith. (Michael Jackson was good in THE WIZ [1978]). The outtakes were of just Will Smith taking up valuable time just to be silly and get attention.  The Blooper reel shows just how unprofessional  Will Smith can be whereas Tommy Lee Jones can prove how much of a consummate actor he is.  Tommy Lee Jones can be serious and jump right back into character when the director needs it.  The sequel just might have killed the entire Men In Black franchise once and for all.  Will Smith and Special Effects  doesn't always work for a film.  They say in Hollywood, that if a film needs unnecessary, unrelated cameo appearances and then a shot of the Statue of Liberty, it's probably a bad film in trouble. Men In Black means ""black suit"" not ""ethnic"".  I would like to see Tommy Lee Jones do a Men In Black without Will Smith.  I like the alternate ending when Will Smith was put in the egg pod.

While the movie was OK, I was still quite disappointed.While MIB was a fairly original movie, MIB II is a regurgitated version of the original.  In MIB II, Agent J (Will Smith) is now the overzealous agent of MIB.  The evil alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) is scouring the earth for the Light of Zartha, which is not even supposed to be on the planet.  Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is the only person who has the pieces to the puzzle, but he is now a ""neutral"" after being neurolized at the end of the first movie.  The remainder of the movie is a race to see who finds the light of Zartha first.Just as with the first movie, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are an excellent pair.  However, the movie has a weak story line.  This is compounded by the fact that I could not take Lara Flynn Boyle seriously as a villain.  However, I think the biggest problem is that the plot behind the first MIB does not allow the writers to create a sequel with an original plot.  It seems to me that MIB II was just an attempt to capitalize on the momentum created by MIB I.  In my opinion, the acting was ""flat"", it seemed to lack enthusiasm (but that is just my opinion).This is a movie that I would recommend renting instead of buying.

My biggest problem with the film is it's pace. At times, it just moves too damn fast. Characters say and do things so quickly that it's hard to keep track of everything. Second problem: Johnny Knoxville is absolutely awesome, but he just kind of disappears. He's in the whole movie till about three quarters of the way through, and then he's just gone, and it's never explained what happens to him. Third problem, Because of the pace being so fast, alot of the action scenes fall flat due to you wondering why the hell it's happening. For all these bad points I've brought up, there are some good things aobut the film. It has that same fun, upbeat feeling of the first movie.

592950,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JKZ2,Joe Sherry,"[1, 1]","A film by Barry SonnenfeldAfter 1997's wildly successful ""Men in Black"" film, someone apparently decided that it would be a good idea to make a sequel.  After all, the director and the two stars are returning, what could possibly go wrong?  A great deal, as it turns out.  The first film covered a good deal of ground and a good deal of story points.  The second film had the opportunity to really build on that as well as becoming a movie that is just as entertaining as the first.  ""Men in Black II"" fails to measure up to the first film.  What felt fresh in the first movie feels tired and just recycled in the sequel.  There are some good moments, but if you've seen the trailer, you have seen most of the good moments.The basic plot is that there is an alien named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) who is searching for something called the Light of Zartha.  It would be very dangerous for the Earth, as well as several other planets if Serleena is able to acquire the Light, whatever it may be.  When Serleena holds up a pizza place and leaves a witness, one of the Men in Black is called in to investigate.  Agent J (Will Smith) meets the witness, an attractive young woman, and finds out what went down.  But Agent J can't solve this case on his own, he needs Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).  Viewers of the first movie will remember that K retired, had his memory wiped and is now working at a post office in some small town.  Of course there is a way to reverse this and the partners are reunited and are fighting the evil aliens of the universe.There are some funny parts to this movie.  I loved the talking/singing dog/alien/agent.  There were several funny gags and funny lines, but taken as a whole I didn't care for the movie all that much.  It passed the time.

Which is probably why Columbia Pictures felt the need to bring more intergalactic action and hilarity to the masses with a sequel to the highly popular film with the hopes of starting a franchise. So, 5 years after their first big screen adventure, Agent's K and J (Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith) are back again to save mankind from the worst scum of the universe, in Barry Sonnenfeld's ""Men in Black 2"".""Men in Black 2"" finds Agent J (Will Smith) having a difficult time keeping partners while protecting the Earth from alien threats. After he de-neuralized his former partner/mentor Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), J feels he's better as loner agent than partnered up. However, when a deadly new threat comes to Earth in the guise of a lingerie model (Lara Flynn Boyle), J and 'MIB' must bring in the one agent who will stand a chance of stopping this threat and saving humanity once again, Agent K. The only problem is, he doesn't remember anything about his life in 'MIB'.What happens when a movie is so successful that it makes tons of money, turns its young lead actor into a mega-star, and catches audiences completely by surprise with how good and unique of a movie it was? Well, the obvious answer would be to make a sequel and cash in on the original film's success, which is exactly what Columbia Pictures did. However, there is a slight problem with this plan, how do you top what's already been done? The surprise factor is gone, the freshness has worn off, and it's possible that due to the mediocre animated series that was spawned from the original movie has diminished people's interest in the series.To solve their possible problems Columbia Pictures brought on two writers that can handle the type of material needed for this type of movie, meaning plenty of action, humor, and sci-fi fun. Next, the powers-that-be managed to convince the main cast to reprise their roles from the first film, and lastly bring back the director that made them successful in the first place. So, did Columbia's plan of action work for this film or was it to fall prey to being yet another inferior sequel in an already long list? The answer, mostly yes, but there were some issues with the movie.The cast was excellent, which isn't surprising given the talent assembled here, but as much as I enjoy Will Smith in most movies he makes, at times he actually felt boring to me here. I understand that the goal was having his character in the place of Tommy Lee Jones' at the beginning of the movie, being the serious career agent, no longer the care free rookie, but he came off like he was bored, leaving his performance feeling stiff. Now, I will say that once Tommy Lee Jones' character was back in play, Will Smith lightened up and the movie quickly picked up and felt more like the original, but the early part of his performance does put a bit of a damper on things. Tommy Lee Jones returns to playing the role that he does best, and apparently it's the only role he knows how to do, the no-nonsense serious man with a mission and a really dry, subtle sense of humor. Though the schtick is the same as before, it's still fun to see these two characters interact on screen, easily erasing the crappiness of the children's animated series. The supporting cast was solid throughout, I did grow tired of Johnny Knoxville's character, but he did provide some humorous moments. The rest of the cast was fun, and giving more screen time to Frank the Pug and the 'Worm' guys was a nice touch.The story was a good follow-up to the original, with plenty of humor, though not as much as I'd hoped for before Agent K returns, but still the jokes were funny. The action was energetic like before, though a little more over-the-top in places than even the previous film had done, and the sci-fi elements were inventive. However, with all that being said, the story did suffer some from the fact that it had lost its freshness and originality since the first one was so much of a surprise and audiences didn't know what to expect, but this time we had a pretty good idea. Honestly it didn't matter what anyone did in this movie, no matter what was tried they just couldn't match the original, which is unfortunate since the characters are so fun and story potential is everywhere, but in the end you still can't do better than what's come before. This is actually one of those rare cases when the potential for a sequel is there, but the studio should avoid going through with it for the simple fact that you most likely won't be able to do better than what you already have done.""Men in Black 2"" is still a fun movie, though not as good as the original, but that doesn't mean the movie's not worth seeing or owning. Yes, there are some problems with this movie in some areas, but most are overcome early on, leaving audiences with a rather enjoyable movie experience.""Men in Black 2"" is rated PG-13 for violence,

Sure, it's 'okay' and it might make you temporarily forget you didn't get the promotion. But the special effects aren't worth foregoing a nice evening at home with your VCR and your favorite beverage. The movie will throw you for a few giggles (postal service jokes- again) and it's a nice neat little story, but don't expect a twisting, turning roller coaster ride of cinematic pleasure. There are no surprises in the newest Men In Black movie. If you go, you will see a lot of Wil Smith, which is generally a laugh-til-it-hurts good time... but his wise-cracks are fewer and less spontaneous than usual. The movie must have been like a vacation for Tommy Lee Jones... he's there but without any personality. At some point you almost hope the aliens do destroy earth so that something exciting will actually happen.

592961,A2I3G2FCCA3BE5,B00005JKZ2,Karl Hamm,"[3, 4]","OK, I broke down and saw this film, despite all of the reviews.  Like everyone else, I like the first film, thought it was fresh and new, etc.  Well, this second film was off.The main problem I had was that all of the funny gags were used in the preview trailer.  Rodger Ebert calls this a ""Coming and Going Attraction: If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie."" (Ebert's Movie Glossary, 43)  So there was really no point in suing this movie, since we already saw all of the comedy.Secondly, the first film was funny because the humor was fresh.  The problem is that the humor was not taken to the next level, but the same types of jokes were repeated.  Seeing Jack Jeebs' head get shot off was funny the first time, but seeing it get shot twice was no longer funny.  There is a difference between telling a joke and merely repeating a joke.To improve the story, first I would have begun with Jay and Elle as partners for continuity's sake.  She could have been an anal partner, or a bully, or what ever.  I would have Jay neutralize her, and send her back to the morgue.Next, I would have T take Elles' place, and have Jay neuralize him after a misadventure, and then have Frank the Dog be the partner, but use it for juts one shot.  I thought the scenes with Frank were a bit overdone, and there was no chemistry between Smith and Blaney.  And the little black suite was more of a curtsy visual gag, but not really funny.I thought it was interesting that Jay had two personalities.  When he was the senior agent, he acted responsible and decisive, but when he went back to being Kay's partner Smith started playing him as a buffoon again.  I'm thinking of the scene in the pizza shop where they puzzle over the old picture of Kay.What is interesting is that people actually act like this: split personalities depending on who is around.  Orson Scott Card in his preface to ""Speaker For The Dead"" mentioned he had this problem in describing the Brazilian family with all the children:  he had to create about three personalities for each child depending on who was around.Zed could have pointed out the difference in Jay's behavior at the end, and not have the weird locker-room scene at the end, which was really a retelling of the same joke that they ended MIB 1 with.  The point could have been that Jay and Kay need each other, or something like that.I thought they had several subplots, such as the romance with Jay and the Light, but nothing really went anywhere.  This film is really an action comedy, and adding a romance element was just too much",4,More like a made for TV movie,1037059200,"11 12, 2002",2002,2565,"['OK', 'broke', 'down', 'saw', 'film', 'reviews', 'everyone', 'else', 'like', 'first', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'fresh', 'new', 'etc', 'Well', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'off.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'funny', 'gags', 'were', 'used', 'preview', 'trailer', 'Rodger', 'Ebert', 'Coming', 'Going', 'Attraction', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Ebert', 'Movie', 'Glossary', '43', 'So', 'was', 'really', 'point', 'suing', 'movie', 'already', 'saw', 'comedy.Secondly', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'funny', 'humor', 'was', 'fresh', 'problem', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'taken', 'next', 'level', 'same', 'types', 'jokes', 'were', 'repeated', 'Seeing', 'Jack', 'Jeebs', 'head', 'get', 'shot', 'off', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'get', 'shot', 'twice', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'funny', 'difference', 'telling', 'joke', 'merely', 'repeating', 'joke.To', 'improve', 'story', 'first', 'would', 'have', 'begun', 'Jay', 'Elle', 'partners', 'continuity', 'sake', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anal', 'partner', 'bully', 'what', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'Jay', 'neutralize', 'send', 'back', 'morgue.Next', 'would', 'have', 'T', 'take', 'Elles', 'place', 'have', 'Jay', 'neuralize', 'misadventure', 'then', 'have', 'Frank', 'Dog', 'be', 'partner', 'use', 'juts', 'one', 'shot', 'thought', 'scenes', 'Frank', 'were', 'bit', 'overdone', 'was', 'chemistry', 'Smith', 'Blaney', 'little', 'black', 'suite', 'was', 'more', 'curtsy', 'visual', 'gag', 'not', 'really', 'funny.I', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'Jay', 'had', 'two', 'personalities', 'When', 'was', 'senior', 'agent', 'acted', 'responsible', 'decisive', 'when', 'went', 'back', 'being', 'Kay', 'partner', 'Smith', 'started', 'playing', 'buffoon', 'again', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'scene', 'pizza', 'shop', 'where', 'puzzle', 'old', 'picture', 'Kay.What', 'interesting', 'people', 'actually', 'act', 'split', 'personalities', 'depending', 'who', 'around', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'preface', 'Speaker', 'Dead', 'mentioned', 'had', 'problem', 'describing', 'Brazilian', 'family', 'children', 'had', 'create', 'three', 'personalities', 'child', 'depending', 'who', 'was', 'around.Zed', 'could', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'difference', 'Jay', 'behavior', 'end', 'not', 'have', 'weird', 'locker-room', 'scene', 'end', 'was', 'really', 'retelling', 'same', 'joke', 'ended', 'MIB', '1', 'point', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Jay', 'Kay', 'need', 'other', 'something', 'that.I', 'thought', 'had', 'several', 'subplots', 'such', 'romance', 'Jay', 'Light', 'nothing', 'really', 'went', 'anywhere', 'film', 'really', 'action', 'comedy', 'adding', 'romance', 'element', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much']",N/A

He then gets Tommy Lee Jones' character out of retirement, and they team up to fight the aliens just like in MIB.Director Barry Sonnenfeld also directed MIB... the formula wasn't changed much for MIB2, either.  The team must have realized that the less they change, the better.  It's an action/sci-fi/comedy extravaganza that promises a lot, and if you've seen the trailers, you know what I mean.  Well, MIB2 lives up to that promise.Are there any differences between MIB2 and the original?  Sure.  Lara Flynn Boyle plays a mean villain.  She's gorgeous, but she pulls the part off well.  Her beautiful exterior is a cunning cover for a grotesque alien character, which outdoes the villains in MIB, the original.  Also this film is more cutesy; it's a movie which advertises itself as a movie end to end, and you never quite forget you're watching a movie-- it's self-referential to the point of self-parody, at times.  You'll laugh along with it, even though it doesn't really envelop you in the movie experience.  Smith, Jones, and Sonnenfeld clearly had a lot of fun making MIB2-- but not as much fun as the audience has.I think MIB2 apparently tries to be funnier than the original, if that makes any sense.

But the pairing of Will Smith, a genuinely likeable guy and Tommie Lee Jones, one of the best actors in the past 20 years was intriging.  They had great chemistry and the movie was mildly entertaining.MIB2 is a classic ""How can we make more money?  Hire Jones and Smith again and get around to writing a script for a sequel.""  Great special effects, but absolutely no interesting story to follow.  Smith and Jones have the ""we're still getting paid millions of dollars to do this movie, right?"" faces on throughout and what chemistry they had in the first movie has gone away.I like Lara Flynn Boyle and here she is just an alien form of her character on the ""Practice"", but she doesn't bring much to the table.

592973,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JKZ2,Lawyeraau,"[11, 15]","A funny and enjoyable sequel, MiB 2 is a film to be taken at face value. What you see is what you get. There are a lot of sight gags and jokes, most of which are funny. This is a simple, upbeat movie with some great special effects.The premise of the film is simple. In 1978, Laranna, Queen of the Universe, landed on this planet, wanting to leave the Light of Zartha here on Earth, The villainous and totally evil, shape changing alien, Serleena, vowed to destroy any planet that would give safe harbor to the Light of Zartha. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) was then the agent in charge of the operation that was to ensure that Queen Laranna would depart Earth, taking the Light of Zartha with her, with Serleena in hot pursuit, thus saving the Earth from destruction.Enter present day Earth, MiB Agent J (Will Smith), having come into his own since the retirement of his mentor and former partner, Agent K, has neuralized yet another unsatisfactory partner, Agent T (Patrick Warburton). Summoned to MiB headquarters, J meets with the head honcho for MiB, Zed (Rip Torn), and discovers that his new partner is Frank the Pug. Together they are to investigate an unusual occurrence and debrief Rita (Rosario Dawson), the witness. He does so and discovers not only love at first sight when he meets Rita, but also that Serleena (in the form of Lara Flynn Boyle) is back on Earth, once more searching for the Light of Zartha and vowing not to leave Earth without it. Working with a pretty stupid, two headed alien, Scard and Charlie, hilariously played by Johnny Knoxville, Serleena is on the prowl. She must not, however, get her mitts on the LIght of Zartha, or all is lost.It turns out that Agent K must be brought back from the obscurity of Maine, where he is the postmaster, and de-neuralized, as it is he who carries with him the secret of what really happened to the Light of Zartha. Only Agents K and J, working together again, can stop Serleena from getting the Light of Zartha. In the intervening years since they last worked together, Agent J has matured, while Agent K finds himself flummoxed by the technological advances that the MiB have made in the  years during his absence. Together again, Agents K and J are just as funny as they were the first time around, and the aliens are better than ever. The locker colony of miniature aliens that worship Agent K is my own personal favorite, though the swinging worm guys, who have their own stereotypic batchelor pad, give them a run for their money in the funny department.Terrific performances are given by the entire cast. Look for a lot of fast paced action, as well as funny, though sometimes sophomoric, repartee, a lot of sight gags, wonderful alien creatures courtesy of the magic of special effects, and cameo appearances by Peter Graves and Michael Jackson. If you are willing to sit back, kick off your shoes, and take the film at face value, you will, undoubtedly, enjoy MiB 2.",4,FUNNY AND IRREVERENT...,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,2942,"['funny', 'enjoyable', 'sequel', 'MiB', '2', 'film', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'What', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'are', 'lot', 'sight', 'gags', 'jokes', 'most', 'are', 'funny', 'simple', 'upbeat', 'movie', 'great', 'special', 'effects.The', 'premise', 'film', 'simple', '1978', 'Laranna', 'Queen', 'Universe', 'landed', 'planet', 'wanting', 'leave', 'Light', 'Zartha', 'here', 'Earth', 'villainous', 'totally', 'evil', 'shape', 'changing', 'alien', 'Serleena', 'vowed', 'destroy', 'planet', 'would', 'give', 'safe', 'harbor', 'Light', 'Zartha', 'Agent', 'K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'was', 'then', 'agent', 'charge', 'operation', 'was', 'ensure', 'Queen', 'Laranna', 'would', 'depart', 'Earth', 'taking', 'Light', 'Zartha', 'Serleena', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'thus', 'saving', 'Earth', 'destruction.Enter', 'present', 'day', 'Earth', 'MiB', 'Agent', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'having', 'come', 'own', 'retirement', 'mentor', 'former', 'partner', 'Agent', 'K', 'neuralized', 'yet', 'unsatisfactory', 'partner', 'Agent', 'T', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Summoned', 'MiB', 'headquarters', 'J', 'head', 'honcho', 'MiB', 'Zed', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'discovers', 'new', 'partner', 'Frank', 'Pug', 'Together', 'are', 'investigate', 'unusual', 'occurrence', 'debrief', 'Rita', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'witness', 'so', 'discovers', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'when', 'Rita', 'also', 'Serleena', 'form', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'back', 'Earth', 'once', 'more', 'searching', 'Light', 'Zartha', 'vowing', 'not', 'leave', 'Earth', 'Working', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'two', 'headed', 'alien', 'Scard', 'Charlie', 'hilariously', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Serleena', 'prowl', 'must', 'not', 'however', 'get', 'mitts', 'LIght', 'Zartha', 'lost.It', 'out', 'Agent', 'K', 'must', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'obscurity', 'Maine', 'where', 'postmaster', 'de-neuralized', 'who', 'secret', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Light', 'Zartha', 'Only', 'Agents', 'K', 'J', 'working', 'together', 'again', 'can', 'stop', 'Serleena', 'getting', 'Light', 'Zartha', 'intervening', 'years', 'last', 'worked', 'together', 'Agent', 'J', 'matured', 'Agent', 'K', 'flummoxed', 'technological', 'advances', 'MiB', 'have', 'made', 'years', 'absence', 'Together', 'again', 'Agents', 'K', 'J', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'were', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'aliens', 'are', 'better', 'ever', 'locker', 'colony', 'miniature', 'aliens', 'worship', 'Agent', 'K', 'own', 'personal', 'favorite', 'swinging', 'worm', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'stereotypic', 'batchelor', 'pad', 'give', 'run', 'money', 'funny', 'department.Terrific', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'entire', 'cast', 'Look', 'lot', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'sophomoric', 'repartee', 'lot', 'sight', 'gags', 'wonderful', 'alien', 'creatures', 'courtesy', 'magic', 'special', 'effects', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'are', 'willing', 'sit', 'back', 'kick', 'off', 'shoes', 'take', 'film', 'face', 'value', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'enjoy', 'MiB', '2']",N/A

The MIB need to stop 'em and Agent Jay (Will SMith) is assigned. But the only one who can help is former MIB Agent and partner Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), who has been deneuralised and works at a postal office. So now Jay must tell him about his past in order to fight Serleena and save the planet.THE CAST: Will Smith and Tommy-Lee Jones definately had chemistry in the first part but in this one I couldn't help feeling they had been forced to act because they seem rather stiff and do not interact as great as they did 5 years ago. The supporting cast has little to do because they all have so underwritten parts no really cares about them. Especially annoying: Johnny Noxville with two heads and nothing but worn out gags...THE FILM: I've seen lots of stuff that was supposed to be funny and wasn't but this one really takes the cake. Not only does it replicate the story of the original, it makes the big sequel mistakes and tries to put in as many effects as it can, making it more like a child's birthday than a movie. Sure the effects people does create cool alien but in MIIB it was just too much. Stylisticly the sequel has the same cold look as the original. Just as pretty much everything is the same, only without any energy. Then there's the running time of 88 minutes, which means, we only get about 40 minutes of Tommy Lee Jones, which is far too little. IT's just that I can't find anything good about this movie except the music by Danny Elfman and the Aliens in the locker but they're not really worth sitting through this stale film.

It's not better, but it's not worse either. Will Smith &amp; Tommy Lee Jones reteam as Agent Jay, and Agent Kay respectively, and are joined by Lara Flynn Boyle (super anorexic chick who used to date Jack Nicholson).What I found with this movie is that the roles of Will and Tommy have been reversed. Now &quot;Kevin&quot; is the one who doesn't have a clue what he is doing.You've got the same old aliens, some of which are really funny if you look out for them. Frank the pug is back, with a bigger and better role, and a hilarious scene where he sings &quot;I Will Surive&quot; the Gloria Gaynor classic. I nearly had an accident after watching that! It's so funny.There are quite a few cameos in this, and you need to keep your eyes peeled for them. There is one rather obvious one, which will have you guessing - MICHAEL JACKSON appears as an agent in this. I found it very hard to believe it was actually him. Barry Sonnenfeld is the husband in the family watching TV when Jay, Kay and the Worm Dudes walk in to collect some guns; Tommy Lee Jones' daughter (as the daughter in K's old apartment) and Will Smith's sons (the two boys who look up as J and K fly overhead) - and I'm also sure one of his sons appears in the video for &quot;Nod Ya Head&quot;. Rick Baker is the alien makeup effects master who appears in the MIB Headquarters at the Alien Registration counter, his trademark hair gives him away. The little bratty girl who wants Rugrats stamps in the post office is Chloe Sonnenfeld, daughter of director Barry Sonnenfeld. And last but not least, the film's special effects supervisor, John Andrew Berton Jr appears as the split alien guy at the mail post.There are a lot of extras on this DVD. Most of them are good, and if you wanna hear all about the technical stuff, you'll be in your element. If you're someone like me, who couldn't really give a damn, then watch the &quot;Nod Ya Head&quot; video and be happy. The extras include an audio commentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld with optional telestrator diagrams; an alien broadcast, by Agent Tee (which features celebrity &quot;aliens&quot; - on this DVD it's mainly British stars, Richard Madeley, Caprice and Vernon Kay, but it is quite funny); a special animated short film, which you will find in the trailers, called &quot;The Chubb Chubbs!&quot; It's quite weird, and I thought it was a trailer. The other trailers featured are Stuart Little 2, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Ghostbusters (OK, that looks good) and trailers for the Men In Black games. Then you have all the exclusive featurettes: Looping MIB II, Alien esoterica, Serleena animatica, 'Rick Baker' (Special make up effects), Danny Elfman (Original Score), Bo Welch (Art/Production Design), Foley Artists, Frank the Pug, Jarra, Jeebs, Jeff the Worm, Scrad/Charlie, Serleena, The Worms, Barry Sonnenfeld's Intergalactic Guide to Comedy and finally the video for &quot;Nod Ya Head&quot;.

While ""Men and Black"" was a very amusing and entertaining film, this sequel proves to be just another movie made only with the motive of cashing in more money.  Everything that was in the first film has been recycled into this sequel with very unimpressive results.Once again the world is in danger and it is up to the Men and Black to save it.  Jay (Will Smith) has to bring back Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) out of retirement, for he is possibly the only person with the answers and is the only guy who can help him.  Using the same tired formula and ridiculously forced jokes, the two are back together again ready to face the alien scum of the earth.Now, there are some pros to the movie.  There are some amusing moments and jokes that do tend to get a laugh or two.  The picture quality is great and there are some really cool special effects.  However, there are far more cons than pros.  Tommy Lee Jones is great at being funny through his seriousness, but it is nothing we haven't seen in the first one.  Will Smith seems even more desperate to be the center of attention in this one.  There is hardly any lines that come out of his mouth that isn't a joke or a wisecrack.  I did like Johnny Knoxville's character and thought he didn't do too bad.  However, the rest of the acting in the movie just wasn't there for the most part.  The film also is very short, proving that they couldn't even think of a lot of new things to put in this one.  It's not even an hour and a half if I'm correct.If you've seen the first ""Men in Black,"" then you have seen this one.  I loved the first film and I think they should've just left it alone.  Now, they decided to make a new sequel that is nothing more but a forced product to cash in more money from the moviegoers.  This is nothing new, of course, but this one seems a lot more desperate than the rest.  While it is amusing at some points, it's just a tired movie that is running out of punch lines.  It's that unfunny joke that your buddy keeps telling you over and over again with hope that one day you'll finally laugh and find it funny.

Most of the characters from the first film return to great effect.  Agent Jay (Will Smith) is having trouble finding a suitable partner after the retirement of Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones).  Agent Jay is eventually partnered up with Frank the Pug, the talking dog briefly seen in the first film.  The worms, seen in the coffee room in the first film, are also back.  We get to see them living it up in their swinging bachelor pad.  Lara Flynn Boyle plays Serleena, an alien who lands on earth and assumes the form of a Victoria's Secrets lingerie model.  She is an intergalactic dominatrix intent on destroying the earth.  The head of the MIB agency, Agent Zed (Rip Torn), decides that Agent Kay must be brought out of retirement to help thwart Serleena and her group of outlaw aliens.Once Tommy Lee Jones' transformation from postmaster Kevin Brown back to Agent Kay is completed, the movie kicks into high gear.  He immediately intimidates Agent Jay into letting him drive the new company car.  The chemistry between the by-the-book veteran and his renegade partner is even more effective than in the original movie, now that they know each other so well.  The  plot twists multiply until the movie reaches it spectacular conclusion.  The special edition has a second disc which includes an alternate ending, behind the scenes footage and a hilarious blooper reel.

In fact, he fully lives down to the weak script.In fact, films with Smith seem to play to the easy side of his characterisation -- the strutting blowhard who isn't nearly as competent -- or as funny -- as he likes to believe.Add to that that this film is pretty much a rehash of the first, and that the basic McGuffin is instantly obvious to fans of either the Tom Baker-era &quot;Doctor Who&quot; or the fifth season of &quot;Buffy&quot;, and you have a recipe for a film that is fun to watch for the special effects, not particularly offensive, and i'm really glad i didn't pay for a ticket to see it.On teevee, as is often the case, some of the special effects that probably looked Really Kewl up on the big screen come across as not particularly impressive, particularly some of the opening subway sequence.The best thing on the DVD is a short feature entitled &quot;The Chubb Chubbs&quot; -- a shaggy dog story akin to the old joke about &quot;Big John's a-comin'!&quot;, in which a crummy bar on some cheesy planet is populated by characters like ET, Darth Vader, Robbie the Robot, the Robot from &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and so on.

Some of the jokes just seem to be recycled, and the whole story (while entertaining) was just lacking a little something.  MIB II does have its funny moments, and witty remarks.  As with the original MIB, the special effects really blew everyone away.  I wasn't sure that they would be able to keep up with the industry this time, but it seems that they pulled some new tricks and the visual effects look great.  As always, it looks superb in DVD format.-SPECIAL FEATURES-Well, basically it's take-it-or-leave-it, folks.

Carnegie,"[8, 10]","Okay, so this may not be a patch on the original movie and a may have a weak plot that would struggle to fill a half hour TV show but it's also nowhere near as bad as most people have made it out to be and still has it's high points and amusing moments.Five years after the original hit movie Men in Black took movie theatres across the world by storm, the world eagerly awaited Barry Sonnenfield's follow up which reunited the hit pairing of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. What the world expected was another hour and a halves worth of comedy and kickin'...action. What we get is a plot that, much like the original, has an alien villain, Serleena  (Lara Flynn Boyle) endangering Earth's population and the future of our planet, in her quest for the Light of Zartha. As it so happens, the only person who knows where the light is hidden is Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) but he's now working in a Maine post office and completely unaware of his MIB past, having been neuralized at the end of the first movie, leaving Agent J (Will Smith) to set about retrieving both K and his memory before it's too late. Cue a glorious laugh riot and lots of fun action. Well, you would hope so but....One of the problems with sequels is that they invariably have so much weight of expectation but with the very odd exception (Godfather II, Empire Strikes Back etc.), they nearly always fail to be a match for the original and in some cases, such as Escape From LA, Highlander 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, they can be just plain awful. Many sequels just try to copy the successful formula of the original, missing out all the talent, originality, wit and imagination that went into making the original movie such a hit in the first place. Unfortunately to a great extent is the case with MIB 2, with many of the scenes and much of the plot being too similar to the original movie.MIB II is in the end all action and FX but it is also generally uninspired and less entertaining than the original. I also think it missed Linda Fiorentino's presence but having said that, it does have its moments and it does have some good laughs: The high point of the movie is perhaps seeing Agent K as a militant postmaster complete with comedy shorts and long socks, as opposed to the cool black suit and shades of he usually wears and some of the scenes with Frank (the dog) are also amusing. However, that's about as good as it gets and seldom does it rise above average. Don't get me wrong though, this is not a bad movie, I did find it entertaining and it's hardly going to damage anybody's career. Most kids will love this regardless of its faults BUT although entertained my overwhelming memory of this movie is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.",3,*** D&Eacute;J&Agrave; VU ***,1035849600,"10 29, 2002",2002,2724,"['Okay', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'patch', 'original', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'weak', 'plot', 'would', 'struggle', 'fill', 'half', 'hour', 'TV', 'show', 'also', 'nowhere', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'still', 'high', 'points', 'amusing', 'moments.Five', 'years', 'original', 'hit', 'movie', 'Men', 'Black', 'took', 'movie', 'theatres', 'world', 'storm', 'world', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfield', 'follow', 'up', 'reunited', 'hit', 'pairing', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Will', 'Smith', 'What', 'world', 'expected', 'was', 'hour', 'halves', 'comedy', 'kickin', 'action', 'What', 'get', 'plot', 'much', 'original', 'alien', 'villain', 'Serleena', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'endangering', 'Earth', 'population', 'future', 'planet', 'quest', 'Light', 'Zartha', 'so', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'where', 'light', 'hidden', 'Agent', 'K', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'now', 'working', 'Maine', 'post', 'office', 'completely', 'unaware', 'MIB', 'past', 'having', 'been', 'neuralized', 'end', 'first', 'movie', 'leaving', 'Agent', 'J', 'Will', 'Smith', 'set', 'retrieving', 'K', 'memory', 'too', 'late', 'Cue', 'glorious', 'laugh', 'riot', 'lots', 'fun', 'action', 'Well', 'would', 'hope', 'so', '.One', 'problems', 'sequels', 'invariably', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'weight', 'expectation', 'very', 'odd', 'exception', 'Godfather', 'II', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'etc', 'nearly', 'always', 'fail', 'be', 'match', 'original', 'cases', 'such', 'Escape', 'LA', 'Highlander', '2', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', '2', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'Many', 'sequels', 'just', 'try', 'copy', 'successful', 'formula', 'original', 'missing', 'out', 'talent', 'originality', 'wit', 'imagination', 'went', 'making', 'original', 'movie', 'hit', 'first', 'place', 'Unfortunately', 'great', 'extent', 'case', 'MIB', '2', 'many', 'scenes', 'much', 'plot', 'being', 'too', 'similar', 'original', 'movie.MIB', 'II', 'end', 'action', 'FX', 'also', 'generally', 'uninspired', 'less', 'entertaining', 'original', 'also', 'think', 'missed', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'presence', 'having', 'said', 'have', 'moments', 'have', 'good', 'laughs', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'seeing', 'Agent', 'K', 'militant', 'postmaster', 'complete', 'comedy', 'shorts', 'long', 'socks', 'opposed', 'cool', 'black', 'suit', 'shades', 'usually', 'scenes', 'Frank', 'dog', 'are', 'also', 'amusing', 'However', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'seldom', 'rise', 'above', 'average', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'though', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'did', 'find', 'entertaining', 'hardly', 'going', 'damage', 'anybody', 'career', 'Most', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'regardless', 'faults', 'BUT', 'entertained', 'overwhelming', 'memory', 'movie', 'sense', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu']",N/A

593016,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JKZ2,Patrick L. Randall,"[0, 0]","The first ""Men In Black"" film was an inventive piece of science-fiction/comedy confectionary.  It was a tongue-in-cheek introduction to the most `underground' of underground government agencies, whose task was to monitor and handle alien (space alien, not illegal alien) immigration on planet Earth.  As refreshing the first film was, its sequel, ""Men In Black 2"" was just as plodding and incoherent.At the end of the first film, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) decided to leave the life and was neuralized by Agent J (Will Smith) and returned back to the world he left decades before to join MIB.  Of course, a new threat posed by the alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) and her witless henchman, Scrad & Charlie (Johnny Knoxville), requires that K being brought back on duty and the neuralization reversed.  It has something to do with an unrealized secret possessed by Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson).All this sounds well and good, but the movie just feels like a bunch of nothing.  It relies on the familiarity with the original characters to pass for a plot line; and parts of this film feel like they were just an excuse to put `man of the moment' Johnny Knoxville on the big screen, as well as give Michael Jackson a cameo.Beyond this, there is nothing memorable about the plot or the resolution.

Jack Jeebs's whole look seemed very different (for the worse) from the first film.  Things were handled in a much too comical and corny manner, though the alien-believer at the video rental place was properly amusing.  Some of the aliens weren't believible at all, having been clearly inserted for some comically reason (said reason is lost on me.)  Mr. Tommy Lee Jones played a retired and neuralized Kay very well, allowing for a fine transition back into the black suit.  I, being of sound mind and a red-blooded male, certainly enjoyed Lara Flynn Boyle's wordrobe choices and her technique of distracting the MIB agents at customs.

593027,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JKZ2,Reviewer,"[3, 5]","Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are back as (respectively) Agents ""K"" and ""J,"" to once again save the world and keep the universe in order, in ""Men In Black II,"" directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, a Sci-Fi/comedy/action film that confirms something we've all suspected for a long time-- that most of the people who work at the Post Office are really aliens in human form (and doesn't that go for the DMV, as well?).  And rest assured, it all comes with plenty of alien activity and is served up with a healthy dose of wry humor and ""new hotness.""  In short, if you've seen the original and/or the trailers for this one, you end up getting exactly what you expect-- and you'll sleep better at night knowing that the Men in Black are out there keeping us safe.Agent K has been ""retired"" for some time, but recent alien activity involving a particularly ruthless alien by the name of Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) necessitates bringing K back into service, as it appears that Serleena is seeking something called the ""Light of Zartha,"" and if she succeeds in her quest it will spell disaster for the world.  And buried in K's memory is information vital to the MIB effort to thwart Serleena.  So J is dispatched to bring K back and deneuralize him, so together they can attempt to stave off the evil Serleena and save the world.  It won't be easy, however, because Serleena is already a step ahead of them, and right out of the chute they encounter a couple of obstacles:  A young woman named Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson) needs their help and protection because of something she's seen; and to get K back into action, J has to engage the help of Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), who demurs, afraid of ""losing"" his head again with K around.  And that hurts.  J prevails, however, and soon K is back in the last suit he'll ever own-- again.Sonnenfeld relies heavily on the visual aspects of this one, which is wise in light of the fact that there is more by way of F/X available to him than story this time around.  And he uses it all to great effect; the bottom line is, this movie is about one thing-- entertainment.  And that's what you get.  There's enough story to keep the audience involved, but it's nothing that's going to strain the brain cells.  It may seem contradictory, but the originality and imagination Sonnenfeld employs here is nothing new-- it's there, but it's really just an extension of all that was generated in the original ""Men In Black.""  Still, it's used well, and Sonnenfeld keeps it all moving along at a brisk pace that keeps it fun and engaging.  What really sells it, though, are the performances-- especially those of Smith and Jones.Will Smith steps right back into his character with facility, and he has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence that make him fun to watch.  Smith draws heavily upon his own winning personality in bringing J to life, and he has the timing and a way of delivering his lines that make his character extremely personable.  And that's exactly what a movie like this needs.  This isn't a project that calls for any in-depth character analysis; still, Smith develops J enough to make him well rounded and credible-- and that's enough.  It works.  Most importantly, Smith holds his own with the F/X, and the lack of pretense in his performance is refreshing.As K, Tommy Lee Jones gives Smith the perfect straight-man to play off of, and right from the beginning he so perfectly captures that lethargic Postal Worker countenance, giving new definition to the word ""droll.""  And while J be-bops around (or is that hip-hops?), you get the feeling that as soon as K is back, he's the guy in charge.  And leading up to K's deneuralization, Jones does a good job of affecting a believable sense of hesitancy, of maintaining ""observation"" mode until he gets to the bottom of whatever it is that's going on with this ""J"" character.  You can always depend on Jones to deliver, no matter what role he's playing, and he certainly does here.  And the casting is inspired:  Smith and Jones make a great team on screen.Rip Torn is also perfect as MIB director Zed, the guy responsible for keeping tabs on all of this alien business.  His character is inherently stereotypical, but Torn at least adds a personal touch and plays him quite well, putting some real life into his portrayal.  It's a good performance inasmuch as Torn lends some zest and personality to a character that could have served little purpose other than that of being a vehicle by which to move the plot along.  And it demonstrates how much a great character actor like Rip Torn can bring to any film.Lara Flynn Boyle does a good job in the less-than-challenging role of Serleena, a character which affords her little opportunity to do more than look good and generate a sense of evil, both of which she succeeds in doing effectively.  The main thing is, she manages to establish who Serleena is, which is pivotal to the success of the film.The supporting cast includes Johnny Knoxville (Scrad/Charlie), Patrick Warburton (Agent T), Jack Kehler (Ben), David Cross (Newton) and Jeremy Howard (Bird Guy Postal Sorting Alien).  Like the man said, ""There's nothing new under the sun,"" which is certainly the case with ""Men In Black II,"" which in essence is a continuation of the original, a kind of ""Further Adventures Of"" the MIB.  But it's well done, fun and entertaining-- it's a kick just being able to spend some more time with these guys.  And if you're a fan of the original and you go into this one expecting more of the same, rather than hoping to be dazzled by something entirely new, it'll be a satisfying, worthwhile experience.",4,The MIB are Back,1027641600,"07 26, 2002",2002,5647,"['Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Will', 'Smith', 'are', 'back', 'respectively', 'K', 'J', 'once', 'again', 'save', 'world', 'keep',

Fortunately, it wasn't bad at all. Great? No. Horrible? No.The only way that MEN IN BLACK II can be considered a bad movie is in direct comparison with the original. If one were to see this one, never having seen the first, I think the experience would be a very pleasurable one. Will Smith is as likable in this one as in the first, and I enjoyed a lot of the accoutrements from the original are back. Tony Shaloub, one of my favorite character actors, reprises his role as Jack Jeebs, and provides some funny moments. Rosario Dawson was fine in her role, though it could have been a expanded with ease. And Lara Flynn Boyle made a believable and successful villainous. My one disappointment was with Tommy Lee Jones, who I almost always love. His performance was fine, but the script doesn't do nearly as much with his memory loss as they might have, and the completely sudden way he gets his memory back makes for a rough transition.

In 1997, the original ""Men in Black"" struck a nerve with movie audiences by showing that even a big budget blockbuster, heavily loaded down with state-of-the-art, computer-generated special effects, could still manage to seem light on its feet.  The makers of that film pulled off this feat of gravitational legerdemain by coming up with a concept and a script overflowing with creativity, wit, imagination and a cachet of ""hipness"" to go along with its tone of anarchic playfulness.Well, five years have passed and we now have ""Men in Black II"" to confirm what most of us suspected all along:  that works that rely on ""uniqueness"" as their prime selling point are rarely ever able to duplicate their success a second time around.  Five years can be a lifetime in pop culture and what seemed ""cool"" one summer can appear decidedly ""old hat"" the next.  Without that aura of cutting edge newness that defined the original, ""Men in Black II"" seems like just another loud, over-the-top summertime blockbuster.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back playing Jay and Kay, agents for the government's top secret organization whose job it is to monitor the activities of the thousands of aliens who have secretly infiltrated earth's societies and to help protect the planet from any possible threat from interstellar space.  Smith and Jones still appear to be quite comfortable in their roles and they are aided by Lara Flynn Boyle, as Serleena, the baddest alien this side of Darth Vader, and Rip Torn, delightful as Zed, the slightly cracked head of the Men in Black agency.Although the special effects in this film are, as one would expect in this day and age, astonishing and virtually seamless, the same can definitely NOT be said for the film's screenplay.  The story moves along at a fairly fast clip, but it rarely makes us laugh.  In fact, the script comes across as undisciplined nonsense, lacking both logic and coherence.  Unlike in the earlier film, we get the sense that literally everything here has been placed at the service of the special effects.  There's an awful lot of running and bouncing around but rarely to any point or purpose.  Indeed, we end up feeling at the end somehow more exhausted and drained than exhilarated and euphoric.  It would appear that director Barry Sonnenfeld thought that if he could just keep the thing MOVING we wouldn't notice that he had nothing new to offer in this retread.  It doesn't work.  In fact, if ""Men in Black II"" shows us anything, it is that just because something MOVES doesn't mean that it can't bore us at the same time.",2,bland sequel,1026777600,"07 16, 2002",2002,2647,"['**1/2', 'Originality', 'almost', 'definition', 'one-time', 'thing', '1997', 'original', 'Men', 'Black', 'struck', 'nerve', 'movie', 'audiences', 'showing', 'even', 'big', 'budget', 'blockbuster', 'heavily', 'loaded', 'down', 'state-of-the-art', 'computer-generated', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'still', 'manage', 'seem', 'light', 'feet', 'makers', 'film', 'pulled', 'off', 'feat', 'gravitational', 'legerdemain', 'coming', 'up', 'concept', 'script', 'overflowing', 'creativity', 'wit', 'imagination', 'cachet', 'hipness', 'go', 'along', 'tone', 'anarchic', 'playfulness.Well', 'five', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'now', 'have', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'confirm', 'what', 'most', 'suspected', 'rely', 'uniqueness', 'prime', 'selling', 'point', 'are', 'rarely', 'ever', 'able', 'duplicate', 'success', 'second', 'time', 'Five', 'years', 'can', 'be', 'lifetime', 'pop', 'culture', 'what', 'seemed', 'cool', 'one', 'summer', 'can', 'appear', 'decidedly', 'old', 'hat', 'next', 'aura', 'cutting', 'edge', 'newness', 'defined', 'original', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'just', 'loud', 'over-the-top', 'summertime', 'blockbuster.Will', 'Smith', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'are', 'back', 'playing', 'Jay', 'Kay', 'agents', 'government', 'top', 'secret', 'organization', 'job', 'monitor', 'activities', 'thousands', 'aliens', 'who', 'have', 'secretly', 'infiltrated', 'earth', 'societies', 'help', 'protect', 'planet', 'possible', 'threat', 'interstellar', 'space', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'still', 'appear', 'be', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'are', 'aided', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Serleena', 'baddest', 'alien', 'side', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'delightful', 'Zed', 'slightly', 'cracked', 'head', 'Men', 'Black', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'day', 'age', 'astonishing', 'virtually', 'seamless', 'same', 'can', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'screenplay', 'story', 'along', 'fairly', 'fast', 'clip', 'rarely', 'laugh', 'fact', 'script', 'undisciplined', 'nonsense', 'lacking', 'logic', 'coherence', 'earlier', 'film', 'get', 'sense', 'literally', 'everything', 'here', 'been', 'placed', 'service', 'special', 'effects', 'awful', 'lot', 'running', 'bouncing', 'around', 'rarely', 'point', 'purpose', 'Indeed', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'end', 'somehow', 'more', 'exhausted', 'drained', 'exhilarated', 'euphoric', 'would', 'appear', 'director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'thought', 'could', 'just', 'keep', 'thing', 'MOVING', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'had', 'nothing', 'new', 'offer', 'retread', ""n't"", 'work', 'fact', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'anything', 'just', 'something', 'MOVES', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bore', 'same', 'time']",N/A

Still, Men in Black II, or as the marketing hype would have it, MIIB, has its own diversions and perversions - just enough to keep you laughing on the same frequency with the designs of director Barry Sonnenfeld.The villain this time is not some ugly bug played by Vincent D'Onofrio, vacationing from Lawn Order, but the beautiful temptress Serleena, played by the beautiful temptress Lara Flynn Boyle. She's really a Kylothian monster who had been tricked into looking elsewhere for something she wants to steal, but which Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) hid from her before he was ""neuralized"" and took the identity of lowly postmaster Kevin Brown, lacking the memories that could save the planet. His trainee from last episode, Agent J (Will Smith), is now a full MIB and must restore K's memory and save the day. He isn't helped this time by sexy coroner Linda Fiorentino (did I really just write ""sexy coroner""?), but enlists Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), an employee at a pizza parlor. The action gets cracking when K is de-neuralized with the help of returning alien/citizen, and pawn shop procurer, Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), although Jack loses and grows back a couple of heads in the process.Having directed the original MIB, Sonnenfeld has a sure hand on this sequel. The performances by Smith and Jones were equal to their previous efforts. It was good to see Rip Torn in his role as Zed, and the aliens, including the expanded presence of the ""worms,"" and the rather annoying Frank (a dog/alien voiced by Tim Blaney), were well used. Ms. Boyle is believable both as a villain and as a Victoria's Secret model (way too thin!). As sequels run, this is one of the better models.My favorite line comes from Lara Flynn Boyle as Serleena: ""Silly little planet.

593041,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JKZ2,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 2]","MiB2 was fun to watch, but when it's over, it's hard to separate the flick from the first movie which it follows in just about every way - with the painful exception of just how edgy its premise was at first. For anybody who forgot (or has been ""neuralized""), the MiB are a hyper-secret bureaucracy that monitors aliens on Earth, while preventing any other Earthlings from doing the same. The joke is 2-fold: while hidden, the aliens themselves are so prevalent among us that there's no mystery to them at all, and the fact that Earth is surrounded by myriads of powerful and oft hostile alien civilizations is an acceptable fact of life, as long as nobody on Earth finds out about it. The punch-line of each joke is that, if you think somebody's either an alien or one of the Men in Black, you're probably right (pop-stars, mail men, politicians...) The other joke is that MiB is the latest in a short line of films that combine the esoteric (alien civilizations) with the mundane (a huge government bureaucracy with no oversight) - the other great example was ""Ghostbusters"", with pre-modern demigods and the legions of the dead having to battle a blue-collar exterminators.As in the first flick, the joke works too well - if aliens are Earth's worst secret, why bother to keep it secret at all? (The joke might work if the script gave our heroes more inventive ways to keep spectacular extra-terrestrials secret, instead of merely wiping clean the minds of witnesses using handheld flash-bulbs called ""neuralizers"") As in the first flick (deja-vu?) Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) must prevent an evil alien from obtaining a powerful weapon with which to conquer the universe. Only Agent K knows the location of ""The Light"" - which was thought to have been launched into space by K years ago (in an incident comparable to an interstellar Potstdam, and immortalized in a cheesy amateur documentary by underground UFO watchers; apparently, the makers of the documentary weren't neuralized - which only raises the question of why anybody bothers to even try wiping clean those ridiculous and unbelievable memories). Seerlana (Lara Flynn Boyle) - an evil alien who manages to stay sultry even when she's got tendrils sprouting from everywhere - wants the light, and moves to conquer MiB HQ in her bid to extract its location from K's mind. (The ease with which she overruns HQ is only one more sign of the script's lameness).Unfortunately, as in the last film, the script's conceit works against itself: the MiB work so hard to convince you there's no alien menace, that you begin to believe them - and soon forget the story. Spectacular FX are undermined by our everybody's' unwillingness to be bowled over by anything. The script does make great use of Tommy Lee Jones as the perfect interstellar bureaucrat and Will Smith as the ""new hotness"". The story could have used more of Rip Torn, and whatever Linda Fiorentino asked for, they should have paid.

It saddens me that people in this society would want to make money when an actor or actress' career can end up being ruined.Continuing with the latter, many accomplished actors' and actresses' talents were not put to use to their full potential. Take, for example, famous people like Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, and Lara Flynn Boyle. Jones is a veteran actor and it is terrible to see such a great actor have to act in such a marred film. Will Smith has great skill in this business but not many of the films that he was in were ever able to show his skill. Smith gives a stunted performance because of the terrible script and storyline. For those of you that are familiar with the television show, ""The Practice,"" you know how Lara Flynn Boyle gives a great performance. Her acting skills in this movie are not even used to their full potential because of the script and story. The previous was just a small example of the people that had great acting talent but couldn't use it to their full potential in this movie.You must be asking yourself where the funny and entertaining parts come in. Unfortunately, there is not much of it. The rare, funny moments are from characters like the dog and some other smalle roles; nothing hysterical is from the main characters. Developing on the dog, he basically stole the show. His jokes, songs, and witty remarks to everything are the funniest things in this film. If there is one reason to see this movie then this is the reason why.The plot and the characters in this movie are not developed whatsoever and you will be baffled by the monotonous and boring storyline. The characters are one dimensional and you will won't care whether they are living or dead by the end of this film.The only thing that I liked about the movie was the dog, and just for him, I tacked on an extra star. If the movie came without the addition of the great little canine the movie would have deserved one star. If you feel that you must see this film, I suggest that you wait for it to come out on video and DVD. Otherwise, the movie should be skipped.Happy Viewing!",2,This Comedy is Nothing But Dumb,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,2698,"['decided', 'sequel', 'Men', 'Black', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'nuts', 'film', 'being', 'listed', 'family', 'comedy', 'movie', 'only', 'handful', 'laughs', 'come', 'dry', 'boring', 'humor', 'plot', 'ridiculously', 'dumb', 'highly', 'doubt', 'will', 'care', 'what', 'plot', 'extremely', 'underdeveloped', 'same', 'characters.While', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'wonder', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'entertainment', 'reasons', 'be', 'answer', 'obvious', 'reason', 'was', 'cash', 'sequel', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'people', 'society', 'would', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'when', 'actor', 'actress', 'career', 'can', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'ruined.Continuing', 'latter', 'many', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'actresses', 'talents', 'were', 'not', 'put', 'use', 'full', 'potential', 'Take', 'example', 'famous', 'people', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Jones', 'veteran', 'actor', 'terrible', 'see', 'such', 'great', 'actor', 'have', 'act', 'such', 'marred', 'film', 'Will', 'Smith', 'great', 'skill', 'business', 'not', 'many', 'films', 'was', 'were', 'ever', 'able', 'show', 'skill', 'Smith', 'stunted', 'performance', 'terrible', 'script', 'storyline', 'are', 'familiar', 'television', 'show', 'Practice', 'know', 'how', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'great', 'performance', 'acting', 'skills', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'used', 'full', 'potential', 'script', 'story', 'previous', 'was', 'just', 'small', 'example', 'people', 'had', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'full', 'potential', 'movie.You', 'must', 'be', 'asking', 'where', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'come', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'much', 'rare', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'characters', 'dog', 'other', 'smalle', 'roles', 'nothing', 'hysterical', 'main', 'characters', 'Developing', 'dog', 'basically', 'stole', 'show', 'jokes', 'songs', 'witty', 'remarks', 'everything', 'are', 'funniest', 'things', 'film', 'one', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'then', 'reason', 'why.The', 'plot', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'whatsoever', 'will', 'be', 'baffled', 'monotonous', 'boring', 'storyline', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'living', 'dead', 'end', 'only', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'dog', 'just', 'tacked', 'extra', 'star', 'movie', 'came', 'addition', 'great', 'little', 'canine', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'deserved', 'one', 'star', 'feel', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'suggest', 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'video', 'DVD', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'skipped.Happy', 'Viewing']",N/A

593064,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKZ2,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","As everybody expected, ""Men in Black"" came back.  Welcome back, I would like to say, but Colimbia pictures surely think that they came back with a wrong timing, right between ""Episode 2"" and before ""Stuart Little 2.""  This may not be an impressive entry in our mind.But wait, ""Men in Black 2"" starts in a very impressive way, with Peter Graves as himself on TV, introducing a knowingly cheezy and cony episode about activities of MIB, which no one but Tim Burton would take seriously.  Then you witness an oval spaceship far from this galaxy destroying the planets of the solar system one after another, and a big, nasty bug eating the subway of NYC away.The real story begins when sexy Lara Flynn Boyle appears as Serieene, whose real identity soon is revealed.  Yeah, she  is another emeny to humans, taking over the headquarter of MIB, seeking for something on earth.  Agents are all captured except Agents J and K, but the latter's memory, which is a key of the secret the alien needs, has been erased as you saw in the original.  So, what should they do?That is a story of this long-awaited sequel, but the script is, I must say, very weak.  You will find that ""MIB 2"" treads too predictable way with less humor, and its short running time of less than 90 minutes is a wise and inevitable decision for moviemakers.  I admit that as the sequel must follow the original settings, its director's hands are rather tied, preserving the original characters with original cast.  Considering this fact, ""MIB 2"" is doing a good job, but there is little surprise waiting for us, which was in the work 5 years ago.As Agents K and J, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith again appear.  Though there is no problem with their acting, I thought there are fewer moments of hilarious chemistry between them, which made ""MIB"" a real treat.  This is, I think, because the original relations between super-cool, all knowing Jones and hot-shot Smith is reversed here.  Sometimes Agent J's attitude looks slightly arrogant while it takes too much time for us to see Agent K back in good old shape.  Consequently, director Sonnenfeld's usual dead-pan humor, though it is certainly funny to watch some of them (especailly a locker scene at station), often seems to slow down the process of re-uniting them, and Smith's love-story with Rosario Dawson (""Josie and the Pussycats"") is too unconvincing, and only drags too long.  Perhaps faster pace would have made the film more effective in drawing out attentions into the film's world.The special effects are first-rate, as usual, and Rick Baker (himself briefly appearing, try to spot him) did a fabulous job with alien creature designs.  But you all agree with me when I say that among the big-budget movies with special-effects (like very recent ""Episode 2"") you may find yourself less impressed with the CGI images of ""MIB 2.""So you probably find the many cameo appearances most interesting.

A pity as Men In Black offered alot more potential than this anemic by the numbers sequel could deliver. The plot? It doesn't really matter but Lara Flynn Boyle plays an morphing alien that comes to earth looking for a device that will enable her to rule the Universe. Will Smith has to recruit his old partner Tommy Lee Jones to help save the world again because he's the only one who knows where it is and how to get to it.Nobody's going to strain an acting muscle in this type of picture. All the actors live up to our expectations of what we've come to expect from Hollywood drivel. The most amusing (and best) part of the film is the first fifteen or twenty minutes as Smith must get rid of a new partner and break in an old one. The sequence in the post office is the most inspired bit in the whole movie. The rest of the plot is as transparent as a newly cleaned pane of glass.The science fiction elements of this visual comic book are props. This film (like it's parent)has enough holes in the science to drive a truck through. On the other hand, as a comic book it's not bad just uninspired. Sonnefeld's direction has more in common with connect the dots than actual film making. As a popcorn film, Men In Black 2 isn't bad just an underachiever. It's an enjoyable way to spent a mindless afternoon. A pity that Sonnefeld elected to remake the first film vs. trying something new. I doubt that he'll do another sequel with the original cast.

593072,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JKZ2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","In terms of plot, ""Men in Black II"" is vastly inferior to the original, as it is pretty much just the same song-and-dance, but this time without the ""wow"" factor of things being so new and inventive.  However, director Barry Sonnenfield realizes this time around that the humor of Will Smith (and especially his interactions with Tommy Lee Jones) need to carry the show.For a basic plot summary, ""MIB II"" sees Agent J (Smith) now the lead agent of MIB.  However, when an evil alien named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) takes over MIB headquarters, J must retrieve the only agent who might know how to resolve the situation: Agent K (Jones).Though the first ""MIB"" effort was a 5-star flick because of its inventiveness, this one is a similar success because of the humor from beginning to end.  When thinking back on the entire ""MIB Trilogy"", some scenes in this movie rank up there with the best of the whole series, such as J's interactions with ""Frank the Pug"", and the scenes in which J must re-acclimate K to the MIB life.  Oh, and let's not forget the Worms, either (""Twister!"").The filmmakers even manage to weave a bit of a human-interest story into this one, and the actors are all good enough to make it interesting and believable.Overall, then, while containing a much weaker villain and a meandering plot, ""MIB II"" is still a classic effort due to its sight gags and hilarious interactions between the two leads.
