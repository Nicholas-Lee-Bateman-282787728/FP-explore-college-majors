365820,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6303257224,Brian E. Erland,"[10, 12]","Synopsis: A small plane headed for Tahiti carrying three convicts makes a layover on a small, volcanic South Pacific Island named Kalaua. The local Catholic priest Father Doonan (Spencer Tracy) convinces the local authorities to allow him to borrow the incarcerated trio to help with repairs at a secluded hospital for lepers during their stay. When the volcano begins to awaken the island residents are forced to evacuate Father Doonan and the convicts are the only ones brave enough to attempt a rescue of the lepers and hospital staff. Will they be able to escape the dangerous eruptions and lava and get to the docks before the schooner leaves at four o'clock? Only God knows.Critique: The '61 film `Devil At 4 O'Clock' is one of the lesser classics of the early `60's. Spencer Tracy delivers one of his usual strong performances as the ill-tempered, disillusioned Catholic priest and Frank Sinatra rises to the occasion with one of his best on-screen performances as the hard-nosed convict Harry.This is a surprisingly good film; the cast is superior, the dialogue intelligent and believable, the scenery breathtaking, the soundtrack memorable and the volcano magnificent. If that's not enough the film also co-stars the beautiful Barbara Luna in the role of Camille, unquestionably one of the most beautiful Hispanic actresses to ever grace the silver screen.Footnote: Here's a little something that might be of interest to all you trivia collectors out there. Take note of the first couple of minutes of the film when the plane comes in for a landing. Did you catch the island boy running into Father Duggin's office shouting ""the plane, the plane!""

365829,A3LYLMNCN0JPQH,6303257224,J. Woodward,"[1, 1]","It can often be difficult to put  special effects for older films into their proper context.  As modern viewers, we cannot help but compare them to the digital effects used today. The Devil at 4 o'clock was released in 1961 and was an early pre-cursor to the ""disaster genre"" films that became so popular in the late 60's and early 70's Although featuring popular stars Spencer Tracey and Frank Sinatra, this movie fell below the radar at the time for all but the most ardent movie buffs. When it was released, the special effects which involve a volcanic eruption on a fictional tropical island, were hailed by critics. (They were shot on a California farm utilizing extensive modeling.) For years afterwards, scenes involving lava flows were used as stock footage for other movies depicting eruptions.Filmed on Maui when that island was still mainly a pineapple plantation, the plot is standard fare for disaster films. Tracy plays a crusty old priest who has become cynical and questions his faith. Sinatra plays a young convict who is basically a good man, but has become cynical and never had much faith to begin with. Together, they must help rescue the children of a missionary clinic/school founded by Tracey's character for victims of leprosy. Who lives and who dies, who behaves heroically are all the standard questions raised by a film of this genre. Both Tracey and Sinatra give solid, if not outstanding performances. A youg Barbara Luna does a nice job as the love interest. It is fun to see how movies of this type were crafted nearly 50 years ago. For people who have been lucky enough to visit Maui, it is fun to see how the village of Lahaina looked back before the commercial growth that took place there starting in the 1970's.
