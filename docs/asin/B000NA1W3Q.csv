The cast was still into it and the writing still funny week after week.

I'm sorry, but I don't particularly care to watch two people yell and scream at each other for a half hour.And did they really think they were being ""cutting edge"" by having the character spout the word ""frigging"" or ""frickin"" ten times an episode?
