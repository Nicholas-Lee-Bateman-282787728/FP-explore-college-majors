There were other moving performances but this is the one that affected me, and the one that I remember - not only is the version on this DVD better than what was recorded on their CD ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"", the lyrics summed up the whole experience perfectly for me, and it was obvious that U2 as a band was deeply moved by the experience themselves.  The montage set to their song ""One"" also greatly affected me, although this was not a live performance.As a tribute, this is probably the best that anyone could have done - the music is varied and the performances generally very good, and the tone is right given how close it was to 9/11.
