It is such a patient film, and its characters are so believably wrought, I'm still a bit shocked that it ever got made.It's telling that the son of Anthony LePaglia's character has a hard time waking up in the morning, because this film seems to be perpetually in the moment between dream and reality... which of course, makes sense, given the title. The theme here is crossing over to a new state, which of course, exacts a toll and shakes up the status quo.I'd like to salute writer/director Josh Sternfeld for so vividly bringing to life the relationships between his characters at his own pace, and not feeling the need to juice up the plot with Hollywood histrionics.

Pilcher novel, set in the U.K.I should have read the info on this product more carefully. It's a slow moving, quiet story with some decent acting but little character development and even less tension or plot. The basic premise is a somewhat vague conflict between the widower-father and his sons, mainly the older one. Anthony Paglia is fine but unimpressive and we get to know very little about him as the movie progresses, other than he has bursts of anger with his sons and that's he the grieving widower (but it takes a long while to even find that much out). The lady-neighbor is cheerfully played and also just okay; she's not given much of a change to develop as person, either.But the movie wasn't a complete waste of my time (I used a credit to purchase it for cheap). As a parent, I totally connected with the father's frustration and the sense of loss when the older son wants to leave home, the changes that occur in a family and relationships, esp after a tragedy happens.But much is left hanging and not well framed; the older son's issue with his loving longtime GF seems strange since we them spend time together, very chipper and intimate - yet he wants to leave her since she is the ""problem"" but we never find out what that means. Lady-neighbor mentions needing a ""change of address"" but we never find out why she does.At least, in the end, there is a sense that things will - or may - work out for this family, and that the sadness that pervades this film will eventually lift as the family members heal and move on.

It seems that many movie-makers take quite a dim view of the value of the patriarchal structure, preferring the tender mercies of the so-called ""village"" instead.Not this film. Based on the slimmest of ideas, Sternfeld's film depicts the remnants of a family emerging from loss. The father (LaPaglia) struggles to right his two suns even as he himself totters. Sternfeld's direction is effective and visually graceful, belying his brief resume. Slight green shoots appear in the landscape (the Janney and Livingston characters), helping the family regain its footing and human-ness.For an example of the vitriolic reaction to this film from the left-wing press, read the ""review"" from the SF Chronicle, calling it ""counterfeit, antiseptic, uninformed, trite and unreal"".

917620,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000A0GOMS,Grady Harp,"[6, 9]","Josh Sternfeld has done the unthinkable. He has elected to tell a story merely by allowing the viewer to overhear the minimal dialogue of the characters without supplying a linear plot or explanation of how a little family fell apart.Landscaper Jim Winters (Anthony LaPaglia is a brilliant role) is the single father of two sons - Gabe (Aaron Stanford) who is the older and looking for ways to move away from his boring little small town home to find breathing space in Florida, and Pete (Mark Webber) a confused kid who wears a hearing aide and only sporadically seems to tune in to life and school.  The three men live a fairly orderly life since the death 5 years ago of the wife/mother in a car accident which Pete survived.  Jim tries to maintain some semblance of family but just cannot quite step out of his ill-defined grief to get a perspective on life. Obviously some forces of change are needed to heal this family of men.Into the neighborhood moves Molly Ripkin (Allison Janney) who is house sitting for friends while she breaks away from being a paralegal to try her hand at making unique jewelry.  She connects with Jim, tries to connect with his sons, but at the least she introduces a figure of gentle concern and focused presence.  Pete finds some understanding from a summer school teacher (Ron Livingston) and begins to see some concept of meaning to his life.  Gabe's decision to leave for Florida's promise of better life means he also must say goodbye to his only rock of realism - his girlfriend Stacey (Michelle Monaghan). With all of these elements of change in the air the story just ends.  What will happen now is left to us to decide.Yes, the film is slow moving, relying on minimal dialogue and more on silences and gazes.  But Sternfeld opens this little family drama in such a tender way that we find ourselves wholly committed to the plight of each character.  He makes us care.  And that is the true beauty of minimalist art in filmmaking.  The acting is first rate, with LaPaglia and Janney giving performances that deserve attention come awards time.  Highly recommended for those who appreciate quiet sensitive films.

917621,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000A0GOMS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 18]","When Anthony LaPaglia first broke onto the scene, the inevitable comparisons began.  Almost immediately his look and intensity was correlated with a young DeNiro.  And while that assessment is apt, he has chosen an alternate career path.  While DeNiro's acting has become a lot broader (tending lately to caricatures of his former persona), LaPaglia has become a lot more introspective.  ""Winter Solstice"" is a small movie that LaPaglia helped produce, an incisive look at a family in the aftermath of the mother's death.Set five years after the incident, LaPaglia is a widower with one grown son and one son still in high school.  The three of them have formed a matter-of-fact living arrangement.  Going about daily routines, there is little real communication or joy within the family.  They just exist.  The older son, played by Aaron Stanford, longs to live a life for himself away from the obligations that have held him stagnant.  The younger son, Mark Webber, is aimless--a smart kid who doesn't bother to apply himself to school or much of anything.  The family dynamic is very observant and true.  The brothers, in particular, have an extremely realistic relationship.  When Stanford wants to move away, there is a subtle shift in the family--and without a lot of high drama, the threesome starts to accept that it is OK to move on.""Winter Solstice"" isn't a movie about plot.  In truth, it's a slight (but emotionally resonant) story.  Stanford, after announcing himself with ""Tadpole"" and surviving the ""X Men"" franchise and ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" proves himself a capable dramatic actor.  Webber is also startlingly good.  The detailed performances are what set this film apart--while the sons are not always likable, they are inherently believable.  Add LaPaglia's lived-in pathos and Alison Janney as a new life-force, and you've got one stellar quartet.Small and quiet, ""Winter Solstice"" still touched me.  Deceptively simple, it's a rare film that just feels true.  Recommended for those that favor character studies, it might be a little too slight for those looking for blockbuster entertainment.

Any info I give you would be a spoiler.Even to say the father owns a landscaping company---I'm giving away a lot there---that's 20% of the movie, watching him drive to work, talk to his customers, and care for landscapes with almost no conversation.  Or outstanding visuals.  Or anything.I have never seen a movie like this with statements of critical acclaim all over the DVD cover and then inside---literally no plot at all.  If someone appreciative of what this movie offers can write about what I'm missing, I'd appreciate it.Basically a family and a family friend go about their lives in a small town.  And more happens to you in a day than these folks in this whole movie! You can watch the expressions on the excellent actors faces as they go about their lives.

Everyone five years later is still grieving, but not really openly or directly or explicitly---they just have very sad and empty lives.If that intrigues you, then you will love this movie.  I should say that I do enjoy deep psychological movies that are slow moving, but this is way beyond what I can tolerate.**",2,Two Stars for the Acting,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,1641,"['**The', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'said', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'much', 'plot', 'so', 'sparse', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'slow-paced', 'loved', 'actors', 'so', 'kept', 'watching', 'watching', 'waiting', 'something', '-anything', '-to', 'happen', 'never', 'did', 'whole', 'movie', 'info', 'give', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler.Even', 'say', 'father', 'landscaping', 'company', '-I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'away', 'lot', 'there', '-that', '20', '%', 'movie', 'watching', 'drive', 'work', 'talk', 'customers', 'care', 'landscapes', 'almost', 'conversation', 'outstanding', 'visuals', 'anything.I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'statements', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'DVD', 'cover', 'then', 'inside', '-literally', 'plot', 'someone', 'appreciative', 'what', 'movie', 'can', 'write', 'what', ""'m"", 'missing', ""'d"", 'appreciate', 'it.Basically', 'family', 'family', 'friend', 'go', 'lives', 'small', 'town', 'more', 'happens', 'day', 'folks', 'whole', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'expressions', 'excellent', 'actors', 'go', 'lives', 'hear', 'small', 'talk', 'nothing', 'big', 'DVD', 'cover', 'wife', 'family', 'died', 'indeed', 'did', 'only', 'mentioned', 'once', 'one', 'ever', 'other', 'point', 'Everyone', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'grieving', 'not', 'really', 'openly', 'directly', 'explicitly', '-they', 'just', 'have', 'very', 'sad', 'empty', 'lives.If', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'should', 'say', 'do', 'enjoy', 'deep', 'psychological', 'movies', 'are', 'slow', 'moving', 'way', 'what', 'can', 'tolerate', '**']",Winter Solstice

I thought the story was great, the landscaper meets the new woman in town and something might blossom. Pete, the younger sibling, finds a teacher that might understand him in Ron Livingston (Office Space). And the older brother hopes to leave town to find something new.  The rest of this review is kind of a spoiler so stop if you want to know nothing of the outcome right now.  The truth is that we really don't know the outcome of anything because nothing is ever resolved.  It is like this movie is just a glimpse into the lives of these people.  It teaches us something about what it is like to be in the situation the characters are in, and for this I give it 3 stars, but there is not much more than that to the movie.  The movie ends abruptly and leaves you wondering about what is going to happen to these people, it is entirely too short.  I could have sat through another 30 minutes to find out what happens, because it is a good film.Watch this movie if you find nothing better on the shelves, it is worth a watch.

Anthony LaPaglia gave a credible performance as a hardworking and grieve stricken father of two sons. The story simply depicts how these 3 men deal with life and with each other after their wife/mother died in an automobile accident 5 years back. The two sons are a handful in their own right, as the oldest is just out of school and working full time at a dead end job while trying to gather enough money to move to Florida and make his own way. The youngest son, who is still in high school and struggling, is some what of a rebel, but yet a good kid just fighting puberty. The Father is left to deal with each of his son's circumstances, while trying to overcome his own mourning, loneliness, and uncertainty.From beginning to end the movie left me interested and entertained. It's not a fast paced movie with to much going on. It's a simple movie with a good story to tell. I will not say how it ends and what happens to these 3 men, however, I will say that I thought the movie ended well. To some interpretations, how it ends could leave you wanting to know more, which is completely understandable. However for me personally, I thought the movie ending was on the money. Sometimes instead of living happily ever after and/or finishing with tragedy, the story is better left undetermined.

He has no job to go to, he's leaving his girlfriend behind and he tells his father he can't help how he feels, he just needs to get away, experience something different. His pending departure causes great anguish for his father Jim, and we are left in the final scene with father and younger son waving to the departing Gabe.Whilst Winter Solstice can claim to be realistic, and well written in parts, and well acted, it lacks pep,zip.I read a review of Winter Solstice where it was likened to Ordinary People.I can only say that Director Robert Redford's film was a lot more character driven than this, which stalls quite a lot along the way. Winter Solstice moves so slowly that it's story could have been told in an hour.It's a pity because it's subject matter was interesting, but the story lacked meat.",3,La Paglia Shines,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,1954,"['Winter', 'must', 'be', 'cold', 'warm', 'memories', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'it.This', 'story', 'man', 'LaPaglia', 'struggling', 'communicate', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'following', 'death', 'mother', 'car', 'accident.Both', 'sons', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'direction', 'concerned', 'father', 'non', 'plussed', 'guide', 'sons', 'overcome', 'resistance.This', 'story', 'great', 'emotion', 'hidden', 'just', 'surface.None', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'grief', 'seem', 'flounder', 'day', 'day.The', 'arrival', 'Molly', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'neighbourhood', 'friendship', 'Jim', 'LaPaglia', 'chance', 'finally', 'move', 'emotionally.She', 'family', 'dinner', 'two', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'occur', 'indifference', 'rudeness', 'younger', 'son', 'Pete', 'awkwardness', 'very', 'realistic', 'adult', 'watching', 'could', 'have', 'strangled', 'later', 'when', 'Jim', 'alone', 'Molly', 'son', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'up.We', ""'ve"", 'been', 'there', 'was', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'Janney', 'LaPaglia.Finally', 'emotional', 'wrench', 'elder', 'son', 'Gabe', 'decision', 'leave', 'home', 'job', 'go', 'leaving', 'girlfriend', 'behind', 'father', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'how', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'experience', 'something', 'different', 'pending', 'departure', 'great', 'anguish', 'father', 'Jim', 'are', 'left', 'final', 'scene', 'father', 'younger', 'son', 'waving', 'departing', 'Gabe.Whilst', 'Winter', 'Solstice', 'can', 'claim', 'be', 'realistic', 'well', 'written', 'parts', 'well', 'acted', 'pep', 'zip.I', 'read', 'review', 'Winter', 'Solstice', 'where', 'was', 'likened', 'Ordinary', 'People.I', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'film', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'quite', 'lot', 'way', 'Winter', 'Solstice', 'so', 'slowly', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'hour.It', 'pity', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'interesting', 'story', 'lacked', 'meat']",Winter Solstice
917628,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000A0GOMS,Timothy Kearney,"[2, 3]","WINTER SOLSTICE is a film that moves somewhat slowly but in a purposeful way that has impact. Anthony La Paglia plays Jim Winters, a widower who owns a landscaping business. He's trying to raise two sons, Gabe (Aaron  Stanford), a produce clerk at a supermarket who is wandering somewhat aimlessly through early adulthood, and Pete (Mark Webber), a high school slacker. The three move about, but barely say more than a sentence to each other. We get a sense of conflict and unresolved grief, but for most of the film we don't see it. We expect it to erupt when Gabe  decides to move to Florida, knowing nothing about the state except it's warm, or why he wants to move, yet very little happens. We do get a sense of the bond between the two brothers and Jim begins to open up a bit when he meets Molly Pipkin (Allison Janey), a woman who is house-sitting for some friends and the two begin a friendship.For some people the film is too slow and bland, but it works. We see grief from a different point of view. Some could see it as male inability to express grief, but I think if anything it shows how long it can take to heal, if we ever do heal from life's hurts. We also see a film where the writers could have taken a sentimental route but choose consistency instead which for this story is the better choice. There are some ways the film could have been expanded a bit. Pete has a new teacher who seems to be able to at least begin to get through to him, but we never see what happens and we want more. There also could be at a bit more interaction between Jim and Molly, and perhaps Molly and the boys. Still the film does work and it is a good effort.",4,A Different Look at Grief,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,1657,"['WINTER', 'SOLSTICE', 'film', 'somewhat', 'slowly', 'purposeful', 'way', 'impact', 'Anthony', 'La', 'Paglia', 'Jim', 'Winters', 'widower', 'who', 'landscaping', 'business', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'sons', 'Gabe', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'produce', 'clerk', 'supermarket', 'who', 'wandering', 'somewhat', 'aimlessly', 'early', 'adulthood', 'Pete', 'Mark', 'Webber', 'high', 'school', 'slacker', 'three', 'move', 'barely', 'say', 'more', 'sentence', 'other', 'get', 'sense', 'conflict', 'unresolved', 'grief', 'most', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'expect', 'erupt', 'when', 'Gabe', 'move', 'Florida', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'state', 'warm', 'why', 'move', 'yet', 'very', 'little', 'happens', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'bond', 'two', 'brothers', 'Jim', 'open', 'up', 'bit', 'when', 'Molly', 'Pipkin', 'Allison', 'Janey', 'woman', 'who', 'house-sitting', 'friends', 'two', 'begin', 'friendship.For', 'people', 'film', 'too', 'slow', 'bland', 'see', 'grief', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'could', 'see', 'male', 'inability', 'express', 'grief', 'think', 'anything', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'take', 'heal', 'ever', 'do', 'heal', 'life', 'hurts', 'also', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'sentimental', 'route', 'choose', 'consistency', 'instead', 'story', 'better', 'choice', 'are', 'ways', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'bit', 'Pete', 'new', 'teacher', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'least', 'begin', 'get', 'never', 'see', 'what', 'want', 'more', 'also', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'interaction', 'Jim', 'Molly', 'perhaps', 'Molly', 'boys', 'Still', 'film', 'work', 'good', 'effort']",Winter Solstice
