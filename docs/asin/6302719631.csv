Having seen them all, I must say that this movie is above all the least true to her book. However, I fell immediately in love with the odd little quirks and enchanting surprises that this film possessed. They caught me off-guard and brought sudden smiles to my face (and I will have you know that I smile least of any body I know.)  For instance - the strange dream sequences, running through the church cemetery, the blue moth in Mrs. Tilney's chamber, the little French servants cartwheels, Peter Firth's unique gestures and facial expressions, the eerie, fluty music - and ah, I could go on and on..... And by the way, I thought the acting was very good - Catherine was unassuming & looked the part. Peter Firth cut a fine figure as Mr. Tilney. Boy! Has this movie been beat up here or what! I don't care - I suppose I can see some of the point in it, as it totally missed the irony &, well, point, that Jane Austen had intended -- yet do not doubt for a second that it suited this vampire's fiendishly-refined tastes just fine!",4,Oddly Enchanting to Watch,949622400,"02 4, 2000",2000,1146,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'one', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'watching', 'adaptations', 'work', 'been', 'pleasure', 'Having', 'seen', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'least', 'true', 'book', 'However', 'fell', 'immediately', 'love', 'odd', 'little', 'quirks', 'enchanting', 'surprises', 'film', 'possessed', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'brought', 'sudden', 'smiles', 'face', 'will', 'have', 'know', 'smile', 'least', 'body', 'know', 'instance', 'strange', 'dream', 'sequences', 'running', 'church', 'cemetery', 'blue', 'moth', 'Mrs.', 'Tilney', 'chamber', 'little', 'French', 'servants', 'cartwheels', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'unique', 'gestures', 'facial', 'expressions', 'eerie', 'fluty', 'music', 'ah', 'could', 'go', '..', 'way', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Catherine', 'was', 'unassuming', 'looked', 'part', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'cut', 'fine', 'figure', 'Mr.', 'Tilney', 'Boy', 'Has', 'movie', 'been', 'beat', 'up', 'here', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'suppose', 'can', 'see', 'point', 'totally', 'missed', 'irony', 'well', 'point', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'had', 'intended', 'yet', 'do', 'not', 'doubt', 'second', 'suited', 'vampire', 'fiendishly-refined', 'tastes', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

It is very clear that it was made at the height of the slasher flick craze and it shoehorned it into the plot of a Jane Austen novel.Horror novels of the late eighteenth, early nineteenth centuries were more about atmosphere and melodrama than fingers being sewn together (yuck) The fantasies of Catherine were completely out of place and gave no indicator of how a girl of her time period really felt. In fact, none of the preformances convinced me that these were regency people and not modern actors wandering around sets.This is also what I call a &quot;staring&quot; movie. That is, to build up suspense, the characters flash one another meaningful glances as though that is supposed to make us gasp at their emotional intensity. To me, it just looked like indigestion.I am not a stickler for historically accurate music (if I were, I would never enjoy ANY movie) but I found the soundtrack annoying in the extreme.

329256,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6302719631,Andrew Raker,"[1, 2]","First off, I would like to say that this film might be mildly entertaining for someone who has never read the book, Northanger Abbey, by Jane Austen. However, having read the book, I find this BBC adaptation a poor substitute. The film cuts out so much of the plot and action. The action it does not cut out, it changes or summarizes. For the BBC to have done the book justice would have required at least 200 minutes. Instead,the film is compacted into about 90 minutes.In fact, I enjoyed the Wishbone children's television 30 minute edition more than this one. The emphasis of this BBC film seemed to be into making General Tilney a villain with horrible habits rather than merely a villain in Catherine's eyes. Furthermore, the film makes Catherine too gothic in my opinion. The music and seens all appear too hastily create, with poor action and an extremely modern-gothic setting.Futhermore, many of the secondary characters are hardly even developed. While I generally enjoy the BBC versions of Charles Dickens' and Jane Austen's works, this BBC work is flawed. Unlike many BBC productions, (ex: Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, Emma)I would not want to show this to a class of students for fear of them coming away with the wrong themes and motifs.",1,Poorly created,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,1283,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'However', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'find', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'poor', 'substitute', 'film', 'cuts', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'action', 'action', 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'BBC', 'have', 'done', 'book', 'justice', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'least', '200', 'minutes', 'Instead', 'film', 'compacted', 'about', '90', 'minutes.In', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'Wishbone', 'children', 'television', '30', 'minute', 'edition', 'more', 'one', 'emphasis', 'BBC', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'making', 'General', 'Tilney', 'villain', 'horrible', 'habits', 'rather', 'merely', 'villain', 'Catherine', 'eyes', 'Furthermore', 'film', 'Catherine', 'too', 'gothic', 'opinion', 'music', 'appear', 'too', 'hastily', 'create', 'poor', 'action', 'extremely', 'modern-gothic', 'setting.Futhermore', 'many', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'hardly', 'even', 'developed', 'generally', 'enjoy', 'BBC', 'versions', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'works', 'BBC', 'work', 'flawed', 'many', 'BBC', 'productions', 'ex', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Bleak', 'House', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Emma', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'show', 'class', 'students', 'fear', 'coming', 'away', 'wrong', 'themes', 'motifs']",N/A

Tinley (played by the same guy who played the older doctor in ""All Creatures Great and Small"") is positively creepy, his son, Henry Tilney, smirks instead of smiles, the Thorpe sister is just plain ugly (I should say she's just plain plain) and the Tilney sister is a stiff.

329261,AUY7L0SJNUM95,6302719631,"C. Sahu ""Cathy Sahu""","[9, 16]","I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."" This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I've watched it 7 or 8 times so far. The acting, to my mind, is incredible. The way I notice good acting is when I find myself looking up from whatever I'm doing (sewing, though not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling or whatever) in order to watch the character deliver his lines. It's the turn of expression, the cast of posture, that make the words come alive -- that's what makes good acting, as far as I'm concerned.Well, I watch almost every part of ""Northanger Abbey"" because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of Bathian fop and real, masculine hero - you're not sure until the end whether he's after Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of (Welsh?) accent. Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors - especially Mr. Richards' high voice, lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them so real. General Tilney as the hard-hearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating, too. And Captain Tilney, the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself... and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names I can't currently remember - the two of them are so perfectly, at once, smart and smarmy.The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the Jane Austen adaptations. I know this was one of Austen's weak points (well, it is as far as I am concerned): even though all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they're aren't really in love, then what's the point? All the other adaptations I've seen (other than the early Olivier/Garson one) have pretty cold-fish kisses at the end, if they kiss at all. I don't at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. And the ending kiss in Northanger is a doozy.The over-the-top approach to costumes, music, and lighting work very well as far as I'm concerned. And the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about Gothic romance, highlife in Bath, Cathy's normal country upbringing, etc., is very well done, as they usually are in BBC productions. Also, I like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels. And the Marchionesse, I think, was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device.Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey - she meant to make fun of Gothic romance, not promote it. But I don't think she meant to put ""Mysteries of Udolpho,"" etc., down. She was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney chides Catherine in his mother's room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, albeit a prosaic one. That point was meant to be made, surely.",5,The Most Romantic of the Jane Austen Adaptations,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,3464,"['got', 'movie', 'BBC', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Collection', '5', 'DVDs', 'old', 'BBC', 'adaptations', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'completely', 'different', 'others', 'so', 'thought', 'one', 'qualities', 'enjoy', 'other', 'Austen', 'movies', 'cheerful', 'common', 'sense', 'nightmare', 'scene', 'Mrs.', 'Richards', 'apparently', 'fingers', 'together', 'was', 'especially', 'upsetting.I', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'watch', 'finger-sewing', 'scene', 'do', 'love', 'hearing', 'Mrs.', 'R.', 'saying', 'dreamily', 'only', 'acquaintance', 'tore', 'gown', 'movie', 'now', 'current', 'Austen', 'favorite', ""'ve"", 'watched', '7', '8', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'acting', 'mind', 'incredible', 'way', 'notice', 'good', 'acting', 'when', 'find', 'looking', 'up', ""'m"", 'doing', 'sewing', 'not', 'fingers', 'together', 'hopefully', 'boondoggling', 'order', 'watch', 'character', 'deliver', 'lines', 'turn', 'expression', 'cast', 'posture', 'make', 'words', 'come', 'alive', 'what', 'good', 'acting', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned.Well', 'watch', 'almost', 'part', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'almost', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'such', 'charisma', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'amazing', 'Mr.', 'Tilney', 'perfect', 'blend', 'Bathian', 'fop', 'real', 'masculine', 'hero', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'end', 'Catherine', 'money', 'not', 'love', 'touch', 'Welsh', 'accent', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Richards', 'are', 'charming', 'combination', 'behaviors', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Richards', 'high', 'voice', 'lending', 'counterpoint', 'wit', 'wisdom', 'so', 'real', 'General', 'Tilney', 'hard-hearted', 'father', 'who', 'may', 'possibly', 'be', 'murderer', 'fascinating', 'too', 'Captain', 'Tilney', 'grinning', 'rake', 'who', 'so', 'clearly', 'enjoying', 'moneygrubbing', 'sister', 'brother', 'names', 'ca', ""n't"", 'currently', 'remember', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'perfectly', 'once', 'smart', 'other', 'reason', 'love', 'adaptation', 'most', 'romantic', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'know', 'was', 'one', 'Austen', 'weak', 'points', 'well', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'even', 'novels', 'are', 'love', 'stories', 'hard', 'feel', 'heroes', 'heroines', 'are', 'really', 'love', 'end', ""'re"", 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'then', 'what', 'point', 'other', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'early', 'Olivier/Garson', 'one', 'have', 'pretty', 'cold-fish', 'kisses', 'end', 'kiss', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sex', 'movies', 'really', 'necessary', 'have', 'heartfelt', 'kiss', 'end', 'ending', 'kiss', 'Northanger', 'doozy.The', 'over-the-top', 'approach', 'costumes', 'music', 'lighting', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'script', 'extremely', 'clever', 'way', 'are', 'educated', 'Gothic', 'romance', 'highlife', 'Bath', 'Cathy', 'normal', 'country', 'upbringing', 'etc.', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'usually', 'are', 'BBC', 'productions', 'Also', 'like', 'part', 'when', 'little', 'black', 'page', 'cartwheels', 'Marchionesse', 'think', 'was', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'very', 'clever', 'expository', 'device.Some', 'people', 'have', 'objected', 'version', 'opposite', 'what', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'intended', 'do', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'meant', 'make', 'fun', 'Gothic', 'romance', 'not', 'promote', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'meant', 'put', 'Mysteries', 'Udolpho', 'etc.', 'down', 'was', 'just', 'making', 'point', 'need', 'distinguish', 'reality', 'fiction', 'point', 'made', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Tilney', 'Catherine', 'mother', 'room', 'Besides', 'General', 'Tilney', 'was', 'villain', 'prosaic', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'made', 'surely']",N/A
329262,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6302719631,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[6, 11]","NORTHANGER ABBEY by Jane Austin was written when she was very young (late teens?) and I believe it was her first novel. My understanding from a college course I took on Austen was that NA was the least polished of her six novels (EMMA held first place). However, many of the artistic elements and themes found Austen's later novels can be found in incipient form in NA so for that reason alone it is important and worthwhile to view and read NORTHANGER ABBEY. It amazes me that the very young daughter of a country vicar in 18th Century England could have written such a thoughtful, clever, and provocative book.Catherine Moreland, Austen's heroine in NA is a very good and natural girl, without guile but not a fool either, probably somewhat like Jane Austen herself although we know Austen was a bit more sophisticated about Gothic novels than Catherine as she soundly criticizes them through the voice of Henry Tilney. However, like Fanny Price, the heroine of MANSEFIELD PARK, Catherine Morland can detect &quot;ne'er do well&quot; young men and their sisters when they attempt to subvert her. And, like Fanny, Catherine recognizes goodness when she sees it in Henry Tilney and his sister.As in Austen's other novels, civility, propriety, sense, sensiblity, honesty, and forthrightness are important themes. Austen had a strong distaste for 18th Century Bath with it's false manners and insinuating habits. Her dislike is evident in the depiction of Bath society apparent on young Catherine's visit. The aged widow of the French Marquis (guilliotined) reminds one of the Elliot's relatives in PERSUASION.Austen was fond of politics (albeit from a drawing room perspective in NA) and her political sympathies are somewhat revealed in refernces to Whigs (she probably sympathized with them), the French Revolution, neoclassical garden design and architecture, clothing, nature versus artifice, and the rational versus the irrational.NORTHANGER ABBEY is beautifully depicted in this DVD. The film was part of a set of BBC productions made in the late 1970s and 1980s and although many of the films based on Austen's other books have been reworked (some more than once) since then, NORHTHANGER ABBEY has not been redone. I own the VHS version, and am happy to say the DVD is much better. Although this film was originally made for tv viewing, my DVD copy is clear as a bell. The settings for the film are scrumptious and those who have visited Bath (and like it) will not be disappointed by the beautiful cinematography showing the city and the surrounding area.

Thurlow,"[1, 1]","Jane Austen's ""Northanger Abbey"" was one of her earliest novels, but one she was perhaps never entirely satisfied with; it was only published after her death.  It is quite different from her usual work and a challenge to translate to film.  The BBC's 1986 version does a reasonable job of capturing both its broad gothic parody and the embedded schoolgirl romance.Catherine Morland is a naive young girl, much addicted to gothic novels, who is offered the opportunity to visit the resort city of Bath with wealthy friends of her family.  There, she falls into company with Isabella and John Thorpe, who will prove to be rather unreliable friends, and with Henry and Eleanor Tilney, steadier companions who are however members of the dangerous Tilney clan.  Catherine will be offered the opportunity to visit the Tilney ancestral home of Northanger Abbey, where a dark mystery, and a real world tragedy, will be unveiled before her eyes.This BBC version is faithful to period dress and locations, and provides suitably atmospheric context.  Katherine Schlesinger as Catherince Morland and Peter Firth as Henry Tilney do a nice job of carrying the story.  Robert Hardy is superb as the forbidding General Tilney. ""Northanger Abbey"" is highly recommended as a very servicable dramatization of Jane Austen's novel.",4,The Romance of the Abbey...,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,1310,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'was', 'one', 'earliest', 'novels', 'one', 'was', 'perhaps', 'never', 'entirely', 'satisfied', 'was', 'only', 'published', 'death', 'quite', 'different', 'usual', 'work', 'challenge', 'translate', 'film', 'BBC', '1986', 'version', 'reasonable', 'job', 'capturing', 'broad', 'gothic', 'parody', 'embedded', 'schoolgirl', 'romance.Catherine', 'Morland', 'naive', 'young', 'girl', 'much', 'addicted', 'gothic', 'novels', 'who', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'visit', 'resort', 'city', 'Bath', 'wealthy', 'friends', 'family', 'company', 'Isabella', 'John', 'Thorpe', 'who', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'rather', 'unreliable', 'friends', 'Henry', 'Eleanor', 'Tilney', 'steadier', 'companions', 'who', 'are', 'however', 'members', 'dangerous', 'Tilney', 'clan', 'Catherine', 'will', 'be', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'visit', 'Tilney', 'ancestral', 'home', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'where', 'dark', 'mystery', 'real', 'world', 'tragedy', 'will', 'be', 'unveiled', 'eyes.This', 'BBC', 'version', 'faithful', 'period', 'dress', 'locations', 'suitably', 'atmospheric', 'context', 'Katherine', 'Schlesinger', 'Catherince', 'Morland', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'carrying', 'story', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'superb', 'forbidding', 'General', 'Tilney', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'highly', 'recommended', 'very', 'servicable', 'dramatization', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel']",N/A
329266,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6302719631,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[214, 240]","I'm not certain why this movie is so low-rated. Is it a movie in the same manner as &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;? No. Is it a good movie? Yes.The movie follows young Catherine Morland, an addict of early gothic novels, with a vivid imagination. When the kindly, wealthy, childless Allens take her on a trip with them to Bath, Catherine is overjoyed. She soon befriends gushing Isabella Thorpe and her vulgar brother John, who appear to be fortune-hunters. Catherine also befriends the kindly, wealthy Tilney brother and sister, Eleanor and Henry. There is also a brother, Frederick (who is VERY interested in the newly-engaged Isabella) and their eerie, falsely-enthusiastic father General Tilney.Eleanor invites Catherine to their eerie family estate, Northanger Abbey. In the mysterious castlelike building, with a death harkening back many years, Catherine's imagination soon disrupts reality, and her slowly growing affection for Henry.I must contradict the people who said that you need to read the book to understand the movie: I haven't, and I did. This movie contains the staples often found in a Jane Austen story: witty repartee, a flurry of manners and morals, dancing and dresses, creeps and nice people, and a chastely tense romance wherein at least one of the people involved must learn a lesson. While in &quot;Pride&quot; it was learning about pride and prejudice, and in &quot;Emma&quot; it was meddling; in this particular movie, it is learning about distinguishing reality from fantasy.Katherine Schlesinger is perfect as Catherine Morland, smaller and wider-eyed than the usual blonde girls in this film. Peter Firth is sexy and sweet as Henry Tilney, who occasionally launches into monologues that both insult and compliment (&quot;She is a disgrace to her sex... and it is a quality I will be sad to see her lose&quot;) and Ingrid Lacey is delightful as the haunted Eleanor Tilney. Cassie Stuart is good as gushy fortune-hunter Isabella Thorpe, whose constant effusion hides a mercenary little excuse for a soul; Jonathan Coy is also good, in his relatively brief role, as the rotten John Thorpe.This movie is filmed in a slightly different manner than most Jane Austen films. Reality is interspersed with Gothic fantasies and nightmares of Catherine's; however, this will be entertaining if you have even a passing knowledge of books like the &quot;Mysteries of Udolpho.&quot; The soundtrack is relentlessly, over-the-top Gothic in a way that is downright funny. We also get to see more of Bath than in movies like &quot;Persuasion&quot;--I thought those gardens were extremely pretty. The movie is shot in a misty sort of way, with looming decaying buildings and white-clad heroines--it seems to be half spoof, half serious story. And as Jane Austen was a master of satire, I imagine she'd be highly amused.I'm a little surprised that the travesty of Mansfield Park is rated higher than this (watch the BBC version, where they care about the original story) as this is a darn good movie. It's not exactly like Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility; however, it's still very good.",5,Highly enjoyable--what is it with people?,995155200,"07 15, 2001",2001,3155,"[""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'low-rated', 'movie', 'same', 'manner', 'quot', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'good', 'movie', 'Yes.The', 'movie', 'young', 'Catherine', 'Morland', 'addict', 'early', 'gothic', 'novels', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'When', 'kindly', 'wealthy', 'childless', 'Allens', 'take', 'trip', 'Bath', 'Catherine', 'overjoyed', 'soon', 'gushing', 'Isabella', 'Thorpe', 'vulgar', 'brother', 'John', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'fortune-hunters', 'Catherine', 'also', 'kindly', 'wealthy', 'Tilney', 'brother', 'sister', 'Eleanor', 'Henry', 'also', 'brother', 'Frederick', 'who', 'VERY', 'interested', 'newly-engaged', 'Isabella', 'eerie', 'falsely-enthusiastic', 'father', 'General', 'Tilney.Eleanor', 'Catherine', 'eerie', 'family', 'estate', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'mysterious', 'castlelike', 'building', 'death', 'harkening', 'back', 'many', 'years', 'Catherine', 'imagination', 'soon', 'disrupts', 'reality', 'slowly', 'growing', 'affection', 'Henry.I', 'must', 'contradict', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'understand', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'did', 'movie', 'staples', 'often', 'found', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'story', 'witty', 'repartee', 'flurry', 'manners', 'morals', 'dancing', 'dresses', 'creeps', 'nice', 'people', 'chastely', 'tense', 'romance', 'wherein', 'least', 'one', 'people', 'involved', 'must', 'learn', 'lesson', 'quot', 'Pride', 'quot', 'was', 'learning', 'pride', 'prejudice', 'quot', 'Emma', 'quot', 'was', 'meddling', 'particular', 'movie', 'learning', 'distinguishing', 'reality', 'fantasy.Katherine', 'Schlesinger', 'perfect', 'Catherine', 'Morland', 'smaller', 'wider-eyed', 'usual', 'blonde', 'girls', 'film', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'sexy', 'sweet', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'who', 'occasionally', 'monologues', 'insult', 'compliment', 'quot', 'disgrace', 'sex', 'quality', 'will', 'be', 'sad', 'see', 'lose', 'quot', 'Ingrid', 'Lacey', 'delightful', 'haunted', 'Eleanor', 'Tilney', 'Cassie', 'Stuart', 'good', 'gushy', 'fortune-hunter', 'Isabella', 'Thorpe', 'constant', 'effusion', 'mercenary', 'little', 'excuse', 'soul', 'Jonathan', 'Coy', 'also', 'good', 'relatively', 'brief', 'role', 'rotten', 'John', 'Thorpe.This', 'movie', 'filmed', 'slightly', 'different', 'manner', 'most', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'films', 'Reality', 'interspersed', 'Gothic', 'fantasies', 'nightmares', 'Catherine', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'entertaining', 'have', 'even', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'books', 'quot', 'Mysteries', 'Udolpho.', 'quot', 'soundtrack', 'relentlessly', 'over-the-top', 'Gothic', 'way', 'downright', 'funny', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Bath', 'movies', 'quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'thought', 'gardens', 'were', 'extremely', 'pretty', 'movie', 'shot', 'misty', 'sort', 'way', 'looming', 'decaying', 'buildings', 'white-clad', 'heroines', 'be', 'half', 'spoof', 'half', 'serious', 'story', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'was', 'master', 'satire', 'imagine', ""'d"", 'be', 'highly', 'amused.I', ""'m"", 'little', 'surprised', 'travesty', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'rated', 'higher', 'watch', 'BBC', 'version', 'where', 'care', 'original', 'story', 'darn', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'Emma', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'however', 'still', 'very', 'good']",N/A
329267,A1X7FPXATCADL0,6302719631,"Elizabeth Darcy ""egyptsqueen""","[9, 12]","We all know that the BBC, with some funding from A&E;, could do a great adaptation of this film (hint, hint)!  But since they don't seem to be interested in doing that, fans of the Jane Austen novel this film is based on, will have to refer to this made-for-British-TV version for a quick Northanger Abbey 'fix'.Which is not a bad way to describe the nature of this film.  Its screenplay is the bare bones of JA's classic novel, which leaves much of her satire, -- not to mention her witty dialogue,-- out.  What was an intriguing and entertaining satire on the popular Gothic novels of its time, was made into a dreamlike, slightly creepy, light romance.  Entertaining for what it is; deeply satisfying it is not. However, there are good things about this film, that JA fans will enjoy.The biggest of these is the strength of the film's cast.  The acting is superb, and the actors well suited to their roles.  Peter Firth is perfectly charming as Henry Tilney, and though deprived of some of JA's better lines from the novel, conveys those he has with just the right passion for a romantic hero.  And the heroine, played wonderfully by Katharine Schlesinger, is just as the novel imagined, innocent and eager to greet the world, all wide eyes and innocence.  The supporting cast is also fine, especially Googie Withers as Mrs. Allen, and the Thorpe siblings.Other high points are the lush and colorful costumes, and the vivid and romantic setting.  All the opulence of dress from the 1790's, the novel's timeframe, is preserved, including piles of curls on the head, and garrish make-up.  The Roman bath scene is a unique and interesting look at what one of the popular health spas of yesterday were like.  And in spite of the inappropriateness of substituting a castle for an abbey, who wouldn't want to be a guest in one like this, or think it a likely place for adventure and romance for the heroine of a Gothic tale, which Catherine Morland so wants to be?There have been just complaints about this film.  The soundtrack is a departure from the JA film norm, and takes some getting used to.  John Thorpe is a leering villian, instead of a bumbling fool, as in the novel.  The Gothic daydream scenes are sometimes jarring and even disturbing, different from the novel's lighter, satirical tone.  But overall these little quirks, along with others, seem to work, within the peculiar context of the film's truncated, but still Gothic and romantic, world.  Even the Marchioness's strange appearance adds a pinch of dream flavor to this Gothic soup.This film is probably best viewed as its own entity, and not as an adaptation of the novel.  For JA fans, a more faithful version is needed (please!) but this has strong parts enough for occasional viewing as a curiosity (or just to give the Pride and Prejudice dvd a rest)!  Like the Gothic romance novels of Mrs. Radcliffe, which this film in part satirizes, it should be enjoyed by quick consumption, and like that list of laundry bills in a mysterious, old trunk, not too seriously.",3,Worth a perusal,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,3035,"['know', 'BBC', 'funding', 'A', 'E', 'could', 'do', 'great', 'adaptation', 'film', 'hint', 'hint', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'interested', 'doing', 'fans', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'will', 'have', 'refer', 'made-for-British-TV', 'version', 'quick', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', ""'fix'.Which"", 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'describe', 'nature', 'film', 'screenplay', 'bare', 'bones', 'JA', 'classic', 'novel', 'much', 'satire', 'not', 'mention', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'What', 'was', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'satire', 'popular', 'Gothic', 'novels', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'dreamlike', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'light', 'romance', 'Entertaining', 'what', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'not', 'However', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'JA', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy.The', 'biggest', 'strength', 'film', 'cast', 'acting', 'superb', 'actors', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'deprived', 'JA', 'better', 'lines', 'novel', 'conveys', 'just', 'right', 'passion', 'romantic', 'hero', 'heroine', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Katharine', 'Schlesinger', 'just', 'novel', 'imagined', 'innocent', 'eager', 'greet', 'world', 'wide', 'eyes', 'innocence', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'fine', 'especially', 'Googie', 'Withers', 'Mrs.', 'Allen', 'Thorpe', 'siblings.Other', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'lush', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'vivid', 'romantic', 'setting', 'opulence', 'dress', '1790', 'novel', 'timeframe', 'preserved', 'including', 'piles', 'curls', 'head', 'garrish', 'make-up', 'Roman', 'bath', 'scene', 'unique', 'interesting', 'look', 'what', 'one', 'popular', 'health', 'spas', 'yesterday', 'were', 'like', 'spite', 'inappropriateness', 'substituting', 'castle', 'abbey', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'guest', 'one', 'think', 'likely', 'place', 'adventure', 'romance', 'heroine', 'Gothic', 'tale', 'Catherine', 'Morland', 'so', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'complaints', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'departure', 'JA', 'film', 'norm', 'getting', 'used', 'John', 'Thorpe', 'leering', 'villian', 'instead', 'bumbling', 'fool', 'novel', 'Gothic', 'daydream', 'scenes', 'are', 'sometimes', 'jarring', 'even', 'disturbing', 'different', 'novel', 'lighter', 'satirical', 'tone', 'overall', 'little', 'quirks', 'others', 'seem', 'work', 'peculiar', 'context', 'film', 'truncated', 'still', 'Gothic', 'romantic', 'world', 'Even', 'Marchioness', 'strange', 'appearance', 'pinch', 'dream', 'flavor', 'Gothic', 'soup.This', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'viewed', 'own', 'entity', 'not', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'JA', 'fans', 'more', 'faithful', 'version', 'needed', 'please', 'strong', 'parts', 'enough', 'occasional', 'viewing', 'curiosity', 'just', 'give', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'dvd', 'rest', 'Gothic', 'romance', 'novels', 'Mrs.', 'Radcliffe', 'film', 'part', 'satirizes', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'quick', 'consumption', 'list', 'laundry', 'bills', 'mysterious', 'old', 'trunk', 'not', 'too', 'seriously']",N/A
329268,AGZEF6W4ASE49,6302719631,Eliza Green,"[2, 4]","For those who have in fact read the book, you can find some redeeming qualities in this movie - most of them found with Katherine Schlesinger, who along with Peter Firth, pull of their characters most true to what one would envision.However, it does in fact neglect the many nuances of the story which make Catherine the true heroine at the end of the novel, and the 'daydreams' she has of the Mysteries of Udolpho are really far and away over the top.  While John Thorpe is cast well, I have to agree with other reviewers that 1) his part is definitely underused, and 2) that he comes off as being mean spirited, instead of goofy and bumbling...  Isabella is horribly cast, and, while you aren't supposed to love her from the beginning in the novel, in the movie you definitely can't even understand why Catherine would become friends with this young woman, and it thus implies a love for her brother that is willing to overlook such vulgarity, instead of showing that she is really and truly the dupe of Isabella and her 'sincere' regard for her and her brother...Also, I didn't think that the introduction of a 'gambling' problem and financial troubles in the life of General Tilney was necessary, since it is the pride of his character which causes him to act towards Catherine as he does....And I must confess, that with the way that the 'daydream' sequences were interspersed throughout the film, I honestly did not realize that the end of the movie was supposed to be the reality of Catherine's life, and not a daydream....  It made me laugh out loud instead of feeling the justice of the ending...Overall, if it hadn't been for the acting of Katherine Schlesinger and Peter Firth, it really would have been disappointing to have actually paid for this movie.... As it is, it is so far over the top and barely stays true to the book that, if you are a Jane Austin purist, this movie will revolt you to your core.

I can never figure out why directors & screenwriters think they can improve on the work of literary masters--they almost always come up with something more or less like this.Anyone who has read Jane Austen knows the delight of her dialogue. This version pretty much just throws it out altogether. It's more a trashing of ""Northanger Abbey"" than a dramatization.Here are some of the ways in which it fails:- It concentrates on the gothic horror aspect of the novel, which was really a secondary plot.- The REAL theme of NA is about how Catherine, naive & genuine, gains maturity by learning from her social blunders. This was essentially lost in this production.- Catherine's cute and funny personality, so strong in the book, doesn't appear here.- Henry's humor is also lost.- In fact, most of the humor is lost. (It IS a very funny book--really.)- Isabella and John Thorpe are depicted as cunning, calculating plotters. In the novel, they are opportunists, but just aren't that smart. They only succeed because the Morlands are so naive.)- Robert Hardy is made to play a ridiculous General Tilney. I resent the indignity to Robert Hardy.WHY, WHY, WHY can't the producers, directors, etc. just follow the novel and use what Jane Austen wrote? If I could understand it at age 13, don't you think most adults could?A true dramatization of the novel would be a delight. NA has the same light, bright, sparkling quality of Pride & Prejudice, and a loveable heroine both comic and nervy, for her time. It's a shame that there is nothing out there to represent NA but this disrespectful, unenjoyable production.The only thing I can praise about it is the fact that the story and costumes are set in the 1790s, when Jane Austen originally wrote its ur version, ""Susan"". There are several subtle points in the novel that make more sense in the context of 1790s Bath.(Please, BBC, do another version of this great novel, and do it more like the 1985 ""Mansfield Park"", where most of the language was Miss Austen's own.)",1,NOT Jane Austen,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,2049,"['production', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'can', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'directors', 'screenwriters', 'think', 'can', 'improve', 'work', 'literary', 'masters', 'almost', 'always', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'more', 'less', 'this.Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'delight', 'dialogue', 'version', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'out', 'altogether', 'more', 'trashing', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'are', 'ways', 'gothic', 'horror', 'aspect', 'novel', 'was', 'really', 'secondary', 'plot.-', 'REAL', 'theme', 'NA', 'how', 'Catherine', 'naive', 'genuine', 'gains', 'maturity', 'learning', 'social', 'blunders', 'was', 'essentially', 'lost', 'production.-', 'Catherine', 'cute', 'funny', 'personality', 'so', 'strong', 'book', ""n't"", 'appear', 'here.-', 'Henry', 'humor', 'also', 'lost.-', 'fact', 'most', 'humor', 'lost', 'very', 'funny', 'book', 'really', 'Isabella', 'John', 'Thorpe', 'are', 'depicted', 'cunning', 'calculating', 'plotters', 'novel', 'are', 'opportunists', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'smart', 'only', 'succeed', 'Morlands', 'are', 'so', 'naive', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'made', 'play', 'ridiculous', 'General', 'Tilney', 'resent', 'indignity', 'Robert', 'Hardy.WHY', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'ca', ""n't"", 'producers', 'directors', 'etc', 'just', 'follow', 'novel', 'use', 'what', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'could', 'understand', 'age', '13', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'adults', 'could', 'true', 'dramatization', 'novel', 'would', 'be', 'delight', 'NA', 'same', 'light', 'bright', 'sparkling', 'quality', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'loveable', 'heroine', 'comic', 'nervy', 'time', 'shame', 'nothing', 'out', 'there', 'represent', 'NA', 'disrespectful', 'unenjoyable', 'production.The', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'praise', 'fact', 'story', 'costumes', 'are', 'set', '1790s', 'when', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'originally', 'wrote', 'ur', 'version', 'Susan', 'are', 'several', 'subtle', 'points', 'novel', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'context', '1790s', 'Bath', 'Please', 'BBC', 'do', 'version', 'great', 'novel', 'do', 'more', '1985', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'where', 'most', 'language', 'was', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'own']",N/A

329272,A1R7TXCKWDZNOQ,6302719631,"Gwyn Gwyrdd ""geek""","[123, 136]","Though below the standard of any other Austen film I've seen (I haven't yet seen Persuasion) in terms of quality and acting, this film version of Northanger Abbey is strangely satisfying - or perhaps I should say - not completely dissatisfying. After hearing so many terrible things said of the music and dream sequences I was expecting something far worse - something entirely laughable. What I've found is that with such low expectations the film did alright.Before one watches or reads Northanger Abbey it is almost vital that one reads Anne Radcliffe's masterpiece, The Mysteries of Udolpho. The reason for this is that NA is consistently referring to the book and is often a direct parody. What was obvious from this film, is that the filmakers had never read Udolpho and didn't understand Austen's jokes. What made it quite clear that Udolpho had not been read were the strange fantasy sequences, as they did not have anything to do with the book or Radcliffe's style at all. What is portrayed in the film is far more graphic and horrific than the book Catherine makes reference to. As a result, the fantasy sequences are over the top and even make Catherine seem a bit mashochistic, which is completely different from Austen's intent. If you haven't read Udolpho, you shouldn't notice these issues at all, however if you have, the filmmaker's approach will seem rather bizarre.Aside from that, one of my main complaintd is that the music does not fit the film whatsoever and did at times become a distraction. The chanting celtic sounding voice may have sounded better without the synthesizers and St. Elmo's Fire saxophone playing with it. The rock guitar that occasionally flared up was much easier to stomach than the lusty saxophone that played at the most unusual times. On top of this, there were some unnecessary changes made to explain the character of Major Tilney and further create the Gothic suspicions that Catherine harbors. I thought this actually lent her actions more credence instead of making them more ridiculous (and hilariously stupid) as they are in the book. The filmaker's need to validate Catherine in this way really removed hilarity from many of the greatest scenes. It was strange to see the BBC and A&amp;E of all people, do this to a piece of literature. However, the changes were not so strong as to entirely change the story.Casting also plays a key role in the quality of this film. Isabella is twice as annoying, maybe thrice, as in the book. The actress who plays her smiles in such a large and ghastly way that her attractiveness to men is entirely unbelievable. Her brother, Catherine's unwelcome courter, is better cast, however the scriptwriters portray him as more of a scary abuser than an awkward baffoon as he is supposed to be. Mr. Tilney, our hero, is at times perfect in his role, and then awkward, but in the most important moments, pulls off his character perfectly. Northanger Abbey itself is an historical inaccuracy, as they use a castle - and assume we don't know what an Abbey is. Major Tilney is perfect, and one of the better actors in the film. However, it is Catherine herself that made the film worth watching for me. She was the embodiment of everything Austen described her to be and I can't imagine another actress in the role who could have done better. She had the awkwardness of Catherine, yet at times could be unbelievably beautiful, and at all times maintained the innocence you would expect her to have. I would very much like to see a remake with this same girl in the role, however, I'm sure she's much older now.Oh, and one more thing, this may be the only film in which the filmmaker's were ever allowed to use the actual waters at bath built originally by the Romans. It is remarkable to see how they were used. Men and women actually climbed into the waters fully clothed, hats and all, and stood around and talked. In this film, the showed the actors with some sort of floating plate tied around their necks. It looked like the plate was covered with flowers or something that was possibly an aromatherapy type treatment. Very interesting for history buffs and likely never to be done again.In summary, this film is worth watching if you are a true Austen fan. However, if you aren't, the whole thing may come off as some strange Saturday afternoon made for tv movie gone wrong. If you aren't familiar with Jane Austen or films of her books, don't start with this one. However, if you are getting to the bottom of the pile for Austen things to read or watch, this is worth the effort.",3,An unusual offering from the BBC - but okay.,1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,4567,"['standard', 'other', 'Austen', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'Persuasion', 'terms', 'quality', 'acting', 'film', 'version', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'strangely', 'satisfying', 'perhaps', 'should', 'say', 'not', 'completely', 'dissatisfying', 'hearing', 'so', 'many', 'terrible', 'things', 'said', 'music', 'dream', 'sequences', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'far', 'worse', 'something', 'entirely', 'laughable', 'What', ""'ve"", 'found', 'such', 'low', 'expectations', 'film', 'did', 'alright.Before', 'one', 'watches', 'reads', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'almost', 'vital', 'one', 'Anne', 'Radcliffe', 'masterpiece', 'Mysteries', 'Udolpho', 'reason', 'NA', 'consistently', 'referring', 'book', 'often', 'direct', 'parody', 'What', 'was', 'obvious', 'film', 'filmakers', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'Udolpho', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Austen', 'jokes', 'What', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'Udolpho', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'read', 'were', 'strange', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'book', 'Radcliffe', 'style', 'What', 'portrayed', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'graphic', 'horrific', 'book', 'Catherine', 'reference', 'result', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'are', 'top', 'even', 'make', 'Catherine', 'seem', 'bit', 'mashochistic', 'completely', 'different', 'Austen', 'intent', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Udolpho', 'should', ""n't"", 'notice', 'issues', 'however', 'have', 'filmmaker', 'approach', 'will', 'seem', 'rather', 'bizarre.Aside', 'one', 'main', 'complaintd', 'music', 'not', 'fit', 'film', 'whatsoever', 'did', 'times', 'become', 'distraction', 'chanting', 'celtic', 'sounding', 'voice', 'may', 'have', 'sounded', 'better', 'synthesizers', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'saxophone', 'playing', 'rock', 'guitar', 'occasionally', 'flared', 'up', 'was', 'much', 'easier', 'stomach', 'lusty', 'saxophone', 'played', 'most', 'unusual', 'times', 'top', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'made', 'explain', 'character', 'Major', 'Tilney', 'further', 'create', 'Gothic', 'suspicions', 'Catherine', 'harbors', 'thought', 'actually', 'actions', 'more', 'credence', 'instead', 'making', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'hilariously', 'stupid', 'are', 'book', 'filmaker', 'need', 'validate', 'Catherine', 'way', 'really', 'removed', 'hilarity', 'many', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'was', 'strange', 'see', 'BBC', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'people', 'do', 'piece', 'literature', 'However', 'changes', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'strong', 'entirely', 'change', 'story.Casting', 'also', 'key', 'role', 'quality', 'film', 'Isabella', 'twice', 'annoying', 'maybe', 'thrice', 'book', 'actress', 'who', 'smiles', 'large', 'ghastly', 'way', 'attractiveness', 'men', 'entirely', 'unbelievable', 'brother', 'Catherine', 'unwelcome', 'courter', 'better', 'cast', 'however', 'scriptwriters', 'portray', 'more', 'scary', 'abuser', 'awkward', 'baffoon', 'supposed', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Tilney', 'hero', 'times', 'perfect', 'role', 'then', 'awkward', 'most', 'important', 'moments', 'pulls', 'character', 'perfectly', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'use', 'castle', 'assume', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Abbey', 'Major', 'Tilney', 'perfect', 'one', 'better', 'actors', 'film', 'However', 'Catherine', 'made', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'embodiment', 'everything', 'Austen', 'described', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'actress', 'role', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'had', 'awkwardness', 'Catherine', 'yet', 'times', 'could', 'be', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'times', 'maintained', 'innocence', 'would', 'expect', 'have', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'see', 'remake', 'same', 'girl', 'role', 'however', ""'m"", 'sure', 'much', 'older', 'now.Oh', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'film', 'filmmaker', 'were', 'ever', 'allowed', 'use', 'actual', 'waters', 'bath', 'built', 'originally', 'Romans', 'remarkable', 'see', 'how', 'were', 'used', 'Men', 'women', 'actually', 'climbed', 'waters', 'fully', 'clothed', 'hats', 'stood', 'around', 'talked', 'film', 'showed', 'actors', 'sort', 'floating', 'plate', 'tied', 'necks', 'looked', 'plate', 'was', 'covered', 'flowers', 'something', 'was', 'possibly', 'aromatherapy', 'type', 'treatment', 'Very', 'interesting', 'history', 'buffs', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'again.In', 'summary', 'film', 'watching', 'are', 'true', 'Austen', 'fan', 'However', 'are', ""n't"", 'whole', 'thing', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'strange', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'made', 'tv', 'movie', 'gone', 'wrong', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'films', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'one', 'However', 'are', 'getting', 'bottom', 'pile', 'Austen', 'things', 'read', 'watch', 'effort']",N/A

It's on a par with Peter Ustinov playing Charlie Chan, 30, or more, years ago.  That movie was funny where it shouldn't have been and sad where it was supposed to be funny.  Gosh, it was bad--did anyone see us leaving the theater?  This version of Northanger Abbey is every bit as bad or worse.Lately, my wife and I have been going over Jane Austen DVD's and videotapes we've acquired or made.  Included were DVD's we'd rate as follows: ""Persuasion,"" 4 stars; ""Pride and Prejudice,"" the 1979, BBC production, 5 stars; the 1995 A&E; production of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" 5+ stars; and ""Sense and Sensibility,"" 5 stars.  Then, we saw ""Emma,"" another A&E; production we videotaped from the mid-90's and found it charming and entertaining.  ""Emma"" might be considered lighter fare than P&P; and S&S;, but it's still very good, 4+ stars.So we kept looking for more Jane Austen and found ""Northanger Abbey,"" something we'd taped off A&E; and never had time to watch.  In short, this 1986 production bears no comparison with the others mentioned and would warrant less than 1 star, if we could give it.When we saw that Robert Hardy was featured in this production of ""Northanger Abbey,"" we felt encouraged that it should be good.  We admired his work in the long-running BBC series, ""All Creatures Great and Small.""  More so, he was great in his portrayal of Winston Churchill in another BBC series, ""The Wilderness Years.""  But in Northanger he is poor, at best.  His character struts around in a red coat most of the time, making snide remarks.  He and the other characters are all without redeeming features and we couldn't care less what happened to them in the end.  They were either foppish or self-important, or just ridiculous.As to the female lead, Catherine Schlesinger, we had to throw up our hands, lest our dinner.  Just a short time into the show we could see how miscast she was for the part and how poorly the director had handled her.  She's all bug-eyes-and-mouth open, at the drop of a hat.  One had to wonder if there were cue cards being flashed behind the camera: Bug Eyes; Open Mouth.  It was very irritating.Background music was weird and very poor.  It sounded like saxophones and synthesizer--a recipe for disaster.  If the music were playing while the director and screenwriter were doing their work it might explain why the story was so disjointed and chaotic.Lessons learned from the time wasted on this dreadful piece include the fact that the BBC doesn't automatically mean high quality.  Similarly, a Jane Austen adaptation doesn't always mean a good, coherent story.  Then, if you're planning to pay good money for a DVD, check the reviews posted on Amazon.com, before buying. If we'd paid for the DVD, we'd be really peeved.  Giles Foster was the director of Northanger and we'll be watching out for him in future.  Same for the screenwriter, Maggie Wadey.We've read what others have to say about ""Northanger Abbey"" and have no interest in reading the book or seeing a re-make.  In essence, we've heard that Jane Austen intended this piece to be a satire on gothic novels of her time.  But there's no satire here.  The screenwriter and director seem to have taken the story line straight and totally lost the point.  Although we'd agree that Jane Austen could never have intended for the story to be so messed up, we don't want to be reminded of what it was like to endure this tripe. Nevertheless, we did get a few laughs reading the Amazon reviews after viewing the show.

Two of those that befriend her are Henry Tilney (Peter Firth) and his sister Eleanor (Ingrid Lacey), who eventually invite her to sleep over at the family manor, NORTHANGER ABBEY, presided over by their widowed father, General Tilney (Robert Hardy). This is where the satire comes in.Catherine and her impressionable girlfriends are absorbed in one particular Gothic novel - a contemporary best seller, so to speak - that has an illustration of the heroine at the mercy of the ogreish master of a gloomy estate. Anyway, Catherine has delicious nightmares of being in a similar situation extrapolated to the point where the peril to her virtue seems at hand after the dreamworld villain carries her upstairs during a violent storm, then leers suggestively after tossing her onto a bed. These dreams work on Catherine's overwrought imagination such that, while at NORTHANGER ABBEY, she begins to suspect that the creepy general had something to do with the sudden death of his wife. The connection between the two scenarios seems dodgy, but the point of Ms. Austen's satire was ""Oh, puhleeze!"" That, at least, I can agree with.For me, the main problem with this film was that absolutely none of the characters were engaging or particularly interesting. Miss Morland is the epitome of the wide-eyed Silly Girl whose foolishness knows no limits. Moreover, the screenplay was borrrring from beginning to end, the soundtrack was melodramatic to the point of campiness, and the ending was so low key as to be almost invisible. (I didn't realize the conclusion had arrived until the credits rolled. A nice surprise, in retrospect.) Good heavens, what was the BBC thinking when it produced this drivel? It makes the cinematic versions of Austen's other works released in the 1990s, more clever by far, look comparatively like the greatest films ever made. The only positive note was the use of the romantically moated, 14th century Bodiam Castle in Kent for the exterior shots of Northanger Abbey.",2,Regency drivel,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,2829,"['understand', 'book', 'NORTHANGER', 'ABBEY', 'was', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'one', 'attempt', 'Gothic', 'satire', 'vastly', 'different', 'comedic', 'novels', 'built', 'Regency', 'polite', 'society', 'period', 'manners', 'notions', 'courtship', 'romance', 'film', 'version', 'British', 'telly', 'NORTHANGER', 'ABBEY', 'accurate', 'indicator', 'Jane', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'day', 'job.Katherine', 'Schlesinger', 'Catherine', 'Morland', 'genteel', 'adolescent', 'sent', 'off', 'spa', 'city', 'Bath', 'tarry', 'good', 'friends', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Allen', 'Geoffrey', 'Chater', 'Googie', 'Withers', 'respectively', 'course', 'right', 'off', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'difference', 'NA', 'PRIDE', 'PREJUDICE', 'SENSE', 'SENSIBILITY', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'EMMA', 'where', 'storylines', 'evolve', 'principally', 'rural', 'manor', 'houses', 'Bath', 'Allen', 'make', 'effort', 'introduce', 'Catherine', 'society', 'Two', 'befriend', 'are', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'sister', 'Eleanor', 'Ingrid', 'Lacey', 'who', 'eventually', 'invite', 'sleep', 'family', 'manor', 'NORTHANGER', 'ABBEY', 'presided', 'widowed', 'father', 'General', 'Tilney', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'where', 'satire', 'in.Catherine', 'impressionable', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'absorbed', 'one', 'particular', 'Gothic', 'novel', 'contemporary', 'best', 'seller', 'so', 'speak', 'illustration', 'heroine', 'mercy', 'ogreish', 'master', 'gloomy', 'estate', 'Anyway', 'Catherine', 'delicious', 'nightmares', 'being', 'similar', 'situation', 'extrapolated', 'point', 'where', 'peril', 'virtue', 'hand', 'dreamworld', 'villain', 'upstairs', 'violent', 'storm', 'then', 'leers', 'suggestively', 'tossing', 'bed', 'dreams', 'work', 'Catherine', 'overwrought', 'imagination', 'such', 'NORTHANGER', 'ABBEY', 'suspect', 'creepy', 'general', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'sudden', 'death', 'wife', 'connection', 'two', 'scenarios', 'dodgy', 'point', 'Ms.', 'Austen', 'satire', 'was', 'Oh', 'puhleeze', 'least', 'can', 'agree', 'with.For', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'none', 'characters', 'were', 'engaging', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'Miss', 'Morland', 'epitome', 'wide-eyed', 'Silly', 'Girl', 'foolishness', 'limits', 'Moreover', 'screenplay', 'was', 'borrrring', 'beginning', 'end', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'melodramatic', 'point', 'campiness', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'be', 'almost', 'invisible', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'conclusion', 'had', 'arrived', 'credits', 'rolled', 'nice', 'surprise', 'retrospect', 'Good', 'heavens', 'what', 'was', 'BBC', 'thinking', 'when', 'produced', 'drivel', 'cinematic', 'versions', 'Austen', 'other', 'works', 'released', '1990s', 'more', 'clever', 'far', 'look', 'comparatively', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'only', 'positive', 'note', 'was', 'use', 'romantically', 'moated', '14th', 'century', 'Bodiam', 'Castle', 'Kent', 'exterior', 'shots', 'Northanger', 'Abbey']",N/A

Miss Morland, a great novel reader, is especially fond of gothic thrillers (and would today probably be a great fan of the TWILIGHT series).Katharine Schlesinger is perfect as the innocent, wide-eyed Miss Morland and I loved the movie's poetic device of showing us her romantic and slightly creepy reveries.  The rest of the cast was also superb, including the witty Henry Tilney.This edition gets a little too fluffy by not depicting the economic circumstances of the people involved.  It glosses over the fact that both Miss Morland's father and Henry Tilney are clergymen, albeit on opposite ends of the economic spectrum.  It plays fast and loose with the character of General Tilney, inventing a weird Frenchwoman companion and endowing him with gambling debts in defiance of Jane Austen's depiction of him as a very stern and proper father.  Such divergence from the ""sacred texts"" forces me to knock off a star.However, this movie shines in the portrayal of the main theme: the need to keep fact and fiction in their proper spheres.  For fun, romance and a gentle but effective spoof of a type of literature that never completely goes out of style, I heartily recommend this movie edition of NORTHANGER ABBEY!",4,A Sparkling Spoof For all Seasons,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,1508,"['PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'most', 'dramatized', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'NORTHANGER', 'ABBEY', 'probably', 'least', 'story', 'young', 'Catherine', 'Morland', 'who', 'rustic', 'country', 'home', 'cosmopolitan', 'tourist', 'town', 'Bath', 'protection', 'family', 'friend', 'Mrs', 'Allen', 'Miss', 'Morland', 'great', 'novel', 'reader', 'especially', 'fond', 'gothic', 'thrillers', 'would', 'today', 'probably', 'be', 'great', 'fan', 'TWILIGHT', 'series', '.Katharine', 'Schlesinger', 'perfect', 'innocent', 'wide-eyed', 'Miss', 'Morland', 'loved', 'movie', 'poetic', 'device', 'showing', 'romantic', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'reveries', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'superb', 'including', 'witty', 'Henry', 'Tilney.This', 'edition', 'little', 'too', 'fluffy', 'not', 'depicting', 'economic', 'circumstances', 'people', 'involved', 'fact', 'Miss', 'Morland', 'father', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'are', 'clergymen', 'albeit', 'opposite', 'ends', 'economic', 'spectrum', 'fast', 'loose', 'character', 'General', 'Tilney', 'inventing', 'weird', 'Frenchwoman', 'companion', 'endowing', 'gambling', 'debts', 'defiance', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'depiction', 'very', 'stern', 'proper', 'father', 'Such', 'divergence', 'sacred', 'texts', 'forces', 'knock', 'off', 'star.However', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'main', 'theme', 'need', 'keep', 'fact', 'fiction', 'proper', 'spheres', 'fun', 'romance', 'gentle', 'effective', 'spoof', 'type', 'literature', 'never', 'completely', 'style', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'movie', 'edition', 'NORTHANGER', 'ABBEY']",N/A

329307,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6302719631,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 10]","After the tremendous success of Jane Austen films and TV programs made in the 90s, such as ""Pride and Prejudice"" ""Sense and Sensibilities"" ""Emma"" ""Persuation"" and ""Clueless"" (as the modernized ""Emma""), you may expect much fun from this adaptation of ""Northanger Abbey.""  But the reviewers, so far, are not so kind, it seems, and they are some good reasons.  Sure, this one is not good.The story follows Catherine Morland, merry and good-natured, but a little naive girl who is overjoyed to have a chance to visit Bath, a famous spa where she is going to enter the society.  Dazzled by dancing, music, and new friends, Catherine is too happy to know that the society is full of unpleasant things which she soon must learn.And Catherine, who devours the popular books of Gothic novels (like Radcliffe's ""The Mysteries of Udolpho""), is invited to live at ""Northanger Abbey"" for a while by the sophisticated Henry Tilney and his kind sister Eleanor.  Catherine is all too happy to accept the offer, dreaming of experiencing an old castle, some intrigues, secret passages and so on, which are basics of the Gothic novels she loves.  And she thinks she finds a deadly secret among the Tilneys, and especially with its eccentric father in mind, she imagines she is to find something horrible among the place.Here you must remember this: Austen wrote the original book as  a spoof of those Gothic novels and their extraordinary situations -- villains, castles, and confined heroines etc. -- so, you have to take the film in that way.  However, the film fails to convey this playful mood, taking itself rather seriously, or, presenting the heroine in a too clumsy way.  At one scene, she sees General Tilney (father of Henry and Eleanor) grinning and laughing like a big bad wolf in her dream.  It is simply misguided and embarrasing, particularly when you hear a strange jazzy soundtrack with that.There are some romantic aspects in the film, and Catherine naturally falls for a gentleman, but the love story is too short, or looks abbreviated.  What intrigued us in ""Pride and Prejudice"" -- like Darcy's witty remarks -- is all missing, and above all, everything is underdeveloped.  The heroine is not joyfully meddling like Emma (or Alicia Silverstone for that matter); her history is not as touching as that of Anne Elliot, the heroine of ""Persuation.""Probably there is a reason for that.  The original book of ""Northanger Abbey"" was the first to be written by Austen, but the last one to be published after her death.  This complicated history has been the topic of discussion for academic people, but it is not what we should know.  We should know that it is written before those masterpieces which made her name.  ""Northanger Abbey"" is just a blueprint, or a prototype  of what is to come later, even though it has many elements to be found in her great works.In short, ""Northanger Abbey"" is not definitely Austen's  best, and they should have known that.  And they should have made its film something different than the book.
