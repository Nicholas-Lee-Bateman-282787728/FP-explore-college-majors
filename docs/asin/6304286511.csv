In any case, this one works, and manages to be funny all the way through, when it almost doesn't seem like it should be funny at all. It's light-hearted and low-brow. A poverty-stricken carpenter is determined to get his just payment from a rich and very snobby woman, who is amnesiac after an accident, and installs her in his shabby house as his supposed wife and mother to his large brood of brats. As nasty as she was, we can't help but feel sorry for her, and perhaps we find the story uplifting because although she really does land in an awful situation, she muddles through, right on to a happy ending. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn appear to be having a great time as the mismatched couple, and the story and humour feel fresh.",5,Good-Natured Comedy,973296000,"11 4, 2000",2000,850,"['Maybe', 'movie', 'better', 'actually', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'comedies', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'case', 'one', 'works', 'be', 'funny', 'way', 'when', 'almost', ""n't"", 'seem', 'should', 'be', 'funny', 'light-hearted', 'low-brow', 'poverty-stricken', 'carpenter', 'determined', 'get', 'just', 'payment', 'rich', 'very', 'snobby', 'woman', 'who', 'amnesiac', 'accident', 'shabby', 'house', 'supposed', 'wife', 'mother', 'large', 'brood', 'brats', 'As', 'nasty', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'perhaps', 'find', 'story', 'uplifting', 'really', 'land', 'awful', 'situation', 'right', 'happy', 'ending', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'appear', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'mismatched', 'couple', 'story', 'humour', 'feel', 'fresh']",N/A

FULL OF OFF-THE-WALL JOKES AND VERY FUNNY PREFORMANCES!Oscar winner Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell team up for this laugh-out-loud romantic comedy. While her yacht&#8217;s stuck for repairs in a small Oregon town, spoiled socialite Joanna Stayton [Goldie Hawn] hires local carpenter Dean Proffitt [Kurt Russell] to remodel her closet... but then refuses to pay him. So when she accidentally falls overboard and loses her memory, Dean takes his one chance for revenge. Claiming she&#8217;s &#8220;Annie,&#8221; his old ball and chain, the hunky widower makes her work off her debt by taking care of his house and four unruly children in this laugh-out-loud funny, riches-to-rags romance!Cast: Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn, Edward Herrmann, Katherine Helmond, Roddy McDowall, Mike Hagerty, Jared Rushton, Brian Price, Jeffrey Wiseman, Jamie Wild, Frank Campanella, Henry Alan Miller, Frank Buxton, Carol Williard and Doris HessDirector: Gary MarshallProducers: Anthea Sylbert and Alexandra RoseWriter: Leslie DixonComposer: Alan SilvestriCinematography: John A. LonzoResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.85:1Audio: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish: Mono and French: 2.0 Dolby SurroundSubtitles: English SDH, Spanish and FrenchRunning Time: 112 minutesRegion: All RegionsNumber of discs: 1Studio: 20th Century Fox Home EntertainmentAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray review &#8211; The 1987 screwball comedy &#34;Overboard&#34; is an incredible study of star power, displaying how a few seasoned professionals can take a limp script and turn it into something unremarkable, yet completely palatable. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn are truly the only reasons to keep watching this otherwise flaccid comedy, which feels static when it should zing and oppressive when it should soar.Trapped in Elk Cove, Oregon while her yacht is docked for repairs, spoiled heiress Joanna [Goldie Hawn] hires strapping carpenter Dean [Kurt Russell] to construct a new closet for her shoe collection. On-board, Dean bears witness to Joanna's bully behaviour, a shrill routine of snobbery soon turned on him. When Joanna is knocked off the boat late one night, she awakens in a local hospital, unable to recall the details of her life due to trauma. Dean, sensing an opportunity to take back what's owed him, convinces Joanna that he's her husband and his squalid home with four children is her family. Unsure, but unable to protest, Joanna is introduced to the ways of housewifery, while Dean works to keep the scam going while tending to a few professional opportunities.&#34;Overboard&#34; is a gentle romantic comedy, directed by Garry Marshall in passive, unfunny manner that would come to define his career. The filmmaker is searching for a classic Hollywood feel for the material (scripted by Leslie Dixon), arranging a battle of wills between Joanna and Dean, set loose inside an amnesia premise that's only moderately tended to. In fact, there's barely a reason for Joanna's misfortune at all, but who am I to stop the progress of monkey business.The majority of the feature is devoted to Joanna's domestic deliverance, spotlighting her attempts to tame this family of undomesticated rapscallions while working inside a dilapidated home, a filthy backwoods abode Dean almost seems proud of. Fed lies by the un-showered clan, Joanna is shoved into a life she doesn't recognize, faintly recalling her time with privilege, yet confronted with doctored photos of her life with Dean, while facing four horrifying reminders of her once potent sexual prowess.The comedy emerges from Joanna's mortified reactions and Dean's frantic scheming, yet Marshall is only interested in the surface elements of the sneaky imprisonment, turning rural Oregon into deep Kentucky to display a redneck wonderland of beer consumption, water barrel dunks, and working-class dreams of miniature golf. &#34;Overboard&#34; moves along like it has somewhere to go, yet halfway through the picture, it suddenly dawns that this is it. Just some mild animosity, playful fibbing, and the slow dance of love, as the lead characters gradually move from shock to romance, with Joanna creating a home Dean and boys grow to adore, finally receiving a sense of discipline that's been absent for far too long. With Russell and Hawn out front and centre, &#34;Overboard&#34; enjoys their easy chemistry and amusing comedic timing. Playing stereotypes, the actors serve up pronounced behaviour and bug-eyed reactions superbly. Russell alone is a convincing jumble of ambition and anxiety as Dean nervously covers his tracks to keep Joanna disoriented. He's terribly fun in the role, finding the right he-man tenor to best accentuate Hawn's articulation of confusion. Her bookend scenes as a spoiled brat are colourful, creating a perceptible arc to the character and her frazzled sense of location.Blu-ray Video Quality - The 1080p image (1.85:1 aspect ratio) presentation works for this hazily shot motion picture, yet the Blu-ray doesn't provide a rich sense of cinematic feel to the visual elements. The picture is soft with a heavy feel for grain. While a step up from any DVD release, the Blu-ray displays slightly washed-out colours and unconvincing skin tones, with faces lacking their pink appeal. Clarity isn't robust, displaying unconvincing details and weak textures, lacking a direct kick of clean imagery, while print defects are detected. Shadow detail isn't sturdy, losing hold on evening encounters and dense hairstyles. It's not a hideous Blu-ray viewing experience, but the film hasn't been subjected to a vigorous re-mastering to take full advantage of the Blu-ray opportunity.Blu-ray Audio Quality - The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix is a competent blend of music and dialogue exchanges, with a frontal push for voices, though the actors sound on the thin side, lacking a substantial weight to reinforce their comedic efforts. Soundtrack cuts and scoring cues sound bright and eager, providing depth to the track and supporting mood when called upon. Atmospherics are detectable for outdoor encounters and bar scenes, but are limited by design. Low-end is minimal.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Theatrical Trailer [2 minutes] It is such a shame that they could only come up with this Trailer, I would of thought with these two main major stars, they could have had some behind-the-scene documentary or better still, been able to interview Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, especially as they are a couple.Finally, &#8220;Overboard&#8221; is enjoyable enough if taken on its own unambitious terms. Hawn is a hoot, especially in the opening scenes, and she and Russell have great on screen chemistry. The film itself is a mishmash, a sort of warmed over sitcom that has just a hint of the smarmy in its main conceit. This Blu-ray image is not brilliant, but very passable, but fans of the film will probably delight that at least it's framed correctly in its aspect ratio presentation. The performances of (particularly) Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell make the best reason for watching &#8220;Overboard&#8221; and you will have endless hours of fun with repeat viewing, but it's certainly no masterpiece, but despite this I personally think it is a definite classic screwball comedy and Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell work so brilliant together and I have loved this film ever since its cinema release and I am so pleased I waited for the Blu-ray release, as both these actors are up there with my massive List of favourite actors and so happy and pleased to add it to me ever expanding Blu-ray Collection.

The usual convention is that, in the end, Dean Proffitt, played by Kurt Russell, would have been arrested for kidnapping and other more serious offenses. So, I'll have to suspend my disbelief this time. The film is more of a drama than a comedy, and Overboard isn't too bad in its pacing as it flows nicely. There isn't anything wrong with acting, but there is a lot wrong with the poorly attempted gag jokes throughout the film. Cutting them out, Overboard would simply have been better.

Both Kurt Russell and the wonderful Goldie Hawn deliver fine performances that will have you in stitches.  The movie moves at a steady pace and has enough clever twists to keep you completely enthralled.Goldie Hawn is pure perfection as the spoiled ""Joanna"" who is thrust into the domestic life and forced to be a mother to four unruly children and wife to ""Dean"" (Kurt Russell).  Although she has amnesia, Joanna, knows that her life is somehow different - wrong, ""I didn't marry well"" she says and she dreams of the good life (her real life).It's gags and guffaws galore as Joanna slowly remembers who she is, but not before she's completely rocked Dean's entire world.  When he drivers her home (with her in the back of his truck) I almost peed my pants.  Like any good romantic comedy, you'll be rooting for this couple and lose yourself entirely in the fantasy of these two worlds colliding.Besides being funny, this movie has heart.  The lead characters are multi-layered with depth and emotion - and both are easy on the eyes.  Immersed in a battle of wits - sparks fly and tempers flare and the outcome is nothing short of magic.  The directing/editing is superb and seamless, the writing is excellent and the cast is flawless.  This is a Hollywood movie at its finest.

411688,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,6304286511,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","Somewhat of a cult comedy classic, Overboard features the comedic talents of true-life married couple Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell on full display. With an unusual plot, but a tried and true romantic device, Overboard remains an interesting and entertaining movie. If you like watching movies for fun, and not for symbolism or to find something that 'speaks' to you, then Overboard will fit in nicely with your plans...Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn) is a spoiled and arrogant elitist who basks in the pampered lifestyle her wealth affords her. Taking a sabbatical on her yacht, she hires a carpenter, Dean Proffitt (Kurt Russell), to build her a customized closet on the oversized boat. But when Dean and Joanna get into argument over the cost of the transaction, she gets angry, refuses to pay, and sets sail for the big blue. However, when Joanna falls overboard at sea, she injures her head and washes ashore with amnesia...Still steaming from their earlier encounter, Dean finds Joanna and quickly realizes what has happened. Out of a sense of revenge (or vigilante justice), he tells Joanna that she's his wife - and the mother of his four children, Charlie (Jared Rushton), Joey (Jeffrey Wiseman), Travis (Brian Price), and Greg (Jamie Wild). In exchange for being stiffed earlier, Dean works Joanna silly in order to make up for his monetary loss. Eventually, though, Joanna discovers her true identity - but things aren't so simple when she realizes that she's now in love with Dean...Hilarious and fun in a family-oriented way, Overboard is one of those films you either love or hate. If you're into dramas and reality-based plots, Overboard isn't for you. Like the Seinfeld pilot Jerry and George create (where a judge sentences a man to be Jerry's butler), Overboard has a similar plot about a carpenter who gets stiffed for the money he's owed, so he unilaterally 'sentences' the woman to be his wife (butler in this case). In short, it's a bit loony. But in this instance it works.With standout comedic performances by Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Edward Herrmann, and various others, Overboard is a memorable and light-hearted romantic comedy you won't want to miss. Most of the humor derives from the circumstances (plus people's emotional inclination to want to see rich snobs get what's coming to them). Regardless of what aspects a viewer most prefers, Overboard has a little bit of something for everybody, and that's probably why it's built such a large following. Due to the fact that it's a really funny movie and quite a few people count it among their favorites, Overboard ranks as a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",4,"You'll either love it, or hate it...",1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2643,"['Somewhat', 'cult', 'comedy', 'classic', 'Overboard', 'comedic', 'talents', 'true-life', 'married', 'couple', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'full', 'display', 'unusual', 'plot', 'tried', 'true', 'romantic', 'device', 'Overboard', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'like', 'watching', 'movies', 'fun', 'not', 'symbolism', 'find', 'something', 'then', 'Overboard', 'will', 'fit', 'nicely', 'plans', 'Joanna', 'Stayton', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'spoiled', 'arrogant', 'elitist', 'who', 'pampered', 'lifestyle', 'wealth', 'Taking', 'sabbatical', 'yacht', 'carpenter', 'Dean', 'Proffitt', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'build', 'customized', 'closet', 'oversized', 'boat', 'when', 'Dean', 'Joanna', 'get', 'argument', 'cost', 'transaction', 'angry', 'pay', 'sets', 'sail', 'big', 'blue', 'However', 'when', 'Joanna', 'overboard', 'sea', 'head', 'washes', 'ashore', 'amnesia', 'Still', 'steaming', 'earlier', 'encounter', 'Dean', 'Joanna', 'quickly', 'realizes', 'what', 'happened', 'sense', 'revenge', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'Joanna', 'wife', 'mother', 'four', 'children', 'Charlie', 'Jared', 'Rushton', 'Joey', 'Jeffrey', 'Wiseman', 'Travis', 'Brian', 'Price', 'Greg', 'Jamie', 'Wild', 'exchange', 'being', 'stiffed', 'earlier', 'Dean', 'Joanna', 'silly', 'order', 'make', 'up', 'monetary', 'loss', 'Eventually', 'Joanna', 'true', 'identity', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'simple', 'when', 'now', 'love', 'Dean', 'Hilarious', 'fun', 'family-oriented', 'way', 'Overboard', 'one', 'films', 'either', 'love', 'hate', ""'re"", 'dramas', 'reality-based', 'plots', 'Overboard', ""n't"", 'Seinfeld', 'pilot', 'Jerry', 'George', 'create', 'where', 'judge', 'man', 'be', 'Jerry', 'butler', 'Overboard', 'similar', 'plot', 'carpenter', 'who', 'stiffed', 'money', 'owed', 'unilaterally', 'woman', 'be', 'wife', 'butler', 'case', 'short', 'bit', 'loony', 'instance', 'standout', 'comedic', 'performances', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'various', 'others', 'Overboard', 'memorable', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'Most', 'humor', 'circumstances', 'people', 'emotional', 'inclination', 'want', 'see', 'rich', 'snobs', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'Regardless', 'what', 'viewer', 'most', 'prefers', 'Overboard', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'everybody', 'probably', 'why', 'built', 'large', 'following', 'Due', 'fact', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'count', 'favorites', 'Overboard', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

He's a handyman hired to do work on her husband's boat and they totally clash. She gets into an argument with him refusing to pay him and shoves him off the boat with his tools and orders the captain to leave the harbor.That night as the boat is traveling out to sea she accidentally falls off the boat. A fishing boat picks her up and is taken to a nearby hospital with amnesia. Her husband (a womanizing jerk) sees his chance for freedom & leaves her there. Kurt Russell sees on the local news that her husband is seen leaving the hospital denying he knows her. He realizes he has a chance to get back at Goldie for the rude way she treated him plus he wants the money she owes him for the work he did on the boat.A friend of his fakes some wedding photos & he talks his sons into pretending she's their mom. (His real wife died and he has no way to take care of the children on his own. He's hired several housekeepers but none last long with his wild kids.) His plan is for her to work off what she owes him by taking care of his kids for a month, cleaning the house which is a war zone & doing yard work.He claims her at the hospital and she comes home with him then the fun begins! The kids torment her with normal kid stuff (super glue on the plates, turtles in the bathtub, problems at school, fighting, etc.) Since he's working 2 jobs Kurt isn't around much and too tired to take advantage of her. They have a chance to get to know each other and end up falling in love.Just when it seems like everything is going to workout & he's going to tell her the truth the horrible husband shows up to claim her (only because her mother threatens to hire a mass of mercenaries to hunt him down & cut off his private part!) When she realizes she's been lied to she leaves with her husband but is miserable. Kurt goes after her with the kids when he find out the boat is in the harbor & there is a very funny ending - happy of course! This is a great movie and well worth watching!

411713,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304286511,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[18, 20]","Among the films I can easily remember growing up as a teen and seeing it played over and over on HBO, it was the 1987 film ""Overboard"" starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.  And with a lot of talk about the upcoming remake starring Jennifer Lopez and Will Smith, it doesn't surprise me that the film is now being released on Blu-ray.""Overboard"" is one of Director Gary Marshall's (""Pretty Woman"", ""Beaches"", ""Runaway Bride"") earlier films, written by Leslie Dixon (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Hairspray"", Limitless"") that was a flop in the box office but pretty much became a cult film because of its popularity on cable and even 25-years-later, I still see this film while channel surfing late at night and I have no doubt in my mind that people of today's generation are enjoying this late '80s film.VIDEO:""Overboard"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  First, its important for me to mention that a lot of  late '80s and also early '90s films were not shot with great film stock.  In fact, more than likely you will noticed certain catalog titles looking its age in HD.  For ""Overboard"", you will notice that there is a good amount of grain but also a lot of noise and also a look that is not exactly the most pristine and shows its age.With that being possibly the bad news, the good news is that the film looks much better than what one would see on television, on VHS and on DVD.  The other good news is that there are many scenes that actually do look good and brings out the detail of the film.  While the opening title sequence may look its age, as the film progresses, it actually looks much better.  Granted, you will see white speckles from time-to-time but one thing where this film is fortunate is that most of it is shot outdoors and thus the sunlight really makes certain scenes come out vibrant.So, if you really love this film, Blu-ray is the way to go!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Overboard"" is presented in English 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Dolby Surround.  The soundtrack is front-channel driven.  Dialogue and even the '80s synth music comes out quite clear.  Overall, it's a good lossless soundtrack but I chose to watch this film with stereo on all channels (set on my receiver) for a more immersive soundscape.Subtitles are in English, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Overboard"" comes with the original theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:One thing that I remember about this film is when I was a teenager was that I felt that Goldie Hawn was a hot actress and with her and Kurt Russell being a real-life couple, that the two had amazing chemistry.Watching it in 2011, Goldie Hawn looks beautiful in the film and interesting to see how Goldie back then and her daughter Kate Hudson (today) look so much alike and yes, she and Kurt Russell have amazing chemistry and for the most part, despite the film is a popcorn romantic comedy and as many critics have called it an updated ""screwball comedy"" with a redneck attitude.Some love it, some hate it but at the time, when one of the younger children spoke like Pee-Wee Herman, maybe today it seems a bit overplayed but heck, even back then...everyone tried to speak and laugh like Pee-Wee Herman.  Granted, parents probably may have not liked the stereotypical portrayal of the redneck family, especially with the young kids talking about a woman's bodyparts and looking at nudie magazines but the sex jokes and overall comedy was not for the refined movie-goer.And probably that is why this film had so much success on cable.  At the time, Americans were more in-tune of what was coming out from the more younger crowd ala the Brat Pack talents during the late '80s and Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell were not an exciting box office pairing (their previous film ""Swing Shift"" back in 1984 also didn't do that well).  But like many Americans, once this film started showing up on cable TV, it was watched many times.And the intriguing thing about this film is that if you bypass the critic reviews for this film, you will see so many people who actually gave the film high ratings within the last 25-years.  And personally, I don't think this film can be remade it today's society, especially with the kids talk about T&A; so freely.  It's not going to happen.  So, I can only imagine the remake being tailored for modern sensibilities and it'll be interesting to see how far the remake will go.But most importantly, what made this film work is because both Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn have great chemistry and the fact that they were a real life couple, the characters seemed real and convincing.  Because these two talents are in love, you can tell on film that the characters that they play are really in love.  It's all in the details and the emotions and it made this film quite enjoyable.For parents who watched the trailer, bare in mind,  this is definitely not a family film.  Granted, the banality of naughty or misbehaved children has been overdone in movies but in the case of this film alone, these kids like to talk about women's boobs and their butt and read nudie magazines and speak profanity.  It was rated PG back in 1987 but wouldn't be surprised if a film like this would receive a rated-R in today's movie rating system (as one or two words of profanity easily gets a film an ""R"" rating).As for the Blu-ray release, this is a barebones release and the PQ is not the greatest but its probably the better of any video version that has been released thus far.  If you are passionate about the film and still have that old VHS copy, then definitely upgrade to Blu-ray!Overall, ""Overboard"" is a romantic comedy with likeable characters, a fun story and a typical happy ending.  By no means is it the best when it comes to romantic comedies but it is a cheerful romantic comedy with that '80s style and if you loved the film back then, no doubt you will love the film today!",3,"While I enjoyed the film, the overall Blu-ray release is barebones.

I had never even heard of such a movie but upon seeing that it starred Kurt Russell (One of my favorite actors. See ""Backdraft"" as well) and the movie had a very eccentric feel that I felt it was worth giving a watch. I was so incredibly suprised as ""Overboard"" turned out to be a really funny and absolutely hilarious classic comedy movie. ""Overboard"" is one of my favorite movies of Kurt Russell's and is a movie to rent.Starring Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, it all happens when the heiress of a British aristocratic empire suffers amnesia after a boating accident and is lost at sea. A man however rescues her from the sea and 'rescues' her and brings her to his house where his four dysfunctional kids raise hell in her life and she tries to adapt to her 'new life' and a romance blossoms between the woman and handyman but a conman who is part of the aristicratic business is out to bring her back to her 'previous life' and as she recalls what she lost before the accident, she has to choose whether to go for the handyman (Russell) or her traditional aristocratic family business.I was completely suprised at how great this movie really was even when taking into account that Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors. I'm not discounting Goldie Hawn either but it's just that I haven't seen enough of her movies to really have an opinion but she gives a great performance on ""Overboard"".I don't know if it is on the scale of being a must-have movie but it sure is great enough to warrant giving this movie a watch.

Three because of predictability and contrivance; the four child actors get downright annoying; and (yet) another stereotypical depiction of the filthy rich.  (If you go by Hollywood all evil one percenters never work a day of their lives and exist in a setting of outrageous luxury while saying insensitive and silly things.)  So trying to decide how many stars to give OVERBOARD presented an interesting dilemma for moi.  Hawn's looks tip the scale.Russell should do more comedy and Russell and Hawn should work together more; again, the chemistry is terrific and believable and fluid and natural.

She has an obnoxiously wimpy husband played by Edward Herrmann and a mother who would have been a perfect fit as Mrs. Howell on ""Gilligan's Island.""  While she is lording over the crew she decides that she needs her closet remodeled and asks local carpenter and real-life husband Kurt Russell, playing Dean Proffitt, to do the remodeling.  Kurt plays a rather down-to-earth fellow who quickly learns to dislike Joanna Stayton (Hawn) as she complains about every single detail.  The encounter ends with Proffitt's tools and Proffitt himself in the ocean, and the yacht sailing away.In a moment of movie irony Joanna falls off the yacht, hits her head and loses her memory.  Initially she continues to be obnoxious until Dean Proffitt identifies her as his wife Annie Proffitt.  When Proffitt initially brings Annie home she is unable to believe she ever lived in the messy, rustic Proffitt home.  At first Dean and his four children almost treat Joanna/Annie almost as a slave.  But as time progresses Annie slowly takes charge of Dean and the children, and Dean realizes that he is falling for Annie.Of course we know there is a point where Annie will wake up to the fact that the tumbledown shack is not her true home and neither is she Annie Proffitt.  I knew the relationship could come to no good end as long as Annie did not know the truth, and the point where she learns the truth is one of the best, though saddest, scenes in the movie.  Of course there is a measure of predictability in how the movie ends, but it is all fun.The pleasure in this movie is that it is entertaining from beginning to end.  Garry Marshall, who also directed ""Pretty Woman,"" has a knack for creating movies about characters that are just a bit larger than life, but close enough to be believable.  His sense of irony and humor border on the absurd, but keep far enough away that you continue to buy the fantasy.  The end result is a movie that is frequently funny and often touching, and at the end you realize you have come to like the characters and wish them well.Also appearing are the always marvelous Hector Elizondo and Roddy McDowall, adding spice to the characters.  Even the lesser known actors get a chance to provide some very funny moments, such as the Coast Guard crewmen near the end of the movie.This movie is a popcorn winner!",4,Funny and Entertaining,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,2414,"['Imagine', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'stuck-up', 'millionaire', 'boating', 'coast', 'yacht', 'obnoxiously', 'wimpy', 'husband', 'played', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'mother', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Mrs.', 'Howell', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'lording', 'crew', 'closet', 'remodeled', 'local', 'carpenter', 'real-life', 'husband', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'playing', 'Dean', 'Proffitt', 'do', 'remodeling', 'Kurt', 'rather', 'down-to-earth', 'fellow', 'who', 'quickly', 'dislike', 'Joanna', 'Stayton', 'Hawn', 'single', 'detail', 'encounter', 'Proffitt', 'tools', 'Proffitt', 'ocean', 'yacht', 'sailing', 'away.In', 'moment', 'movie', 'irony', 'Joanna', 'yacht', 'head', 'memory', 'Initially', 'be', 'obnoxious', 'Dean', 'Proffitt', 'wife', 'Annie', 'Proffitt', 'When', 'Proffitt', 'initially', 'Annie', 'home', 'unable', 'believe', 'ever', 'lived', 'messy', 'rustic', 'Proffitt', 'home', 'first', 'Dean', 'four', 'children', 'almost', 'treat', 'Joanna/Annie', 'almost', 'slave', 'time', 'Annie', 'slowly', 'charge', 'Dean', 'children', 'Dean', 'falling', 'Annie.Of', 'course', 'know', 'point', 'where', 'Annie', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'fact', 'tumbledown', 'shack', 'not', 'true', 'home', 'Annie', 'Proffitt', 'knew', 'relationship', 'could', 'come', 'good', 'end', 'as', 'long', 'Annie', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'truth', 'point', 'where', 'truth', 'one', 'best', 'though', 'saddest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'course', 'measure', 'predictability', 'how', 'movie', 'fun.The', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'end', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'knack', 'creating', 'movies', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'bit', 'larger', 'life', 'close', 'enough', 'be', 'believable', 'sense', 'irony', 'humor', 'border', 'absurd', 'keep', 'far', 'enough', 'away', 'continue', 'buy', 'fantasy', 'end', 'result', 'movie', 'frequently', 'funny', 'often', 'touching', 'end', 'realize', 'have', 'come', 'characters', 'wish', 'well.Also', 'appearing', 'are', 'always', 'marvelous', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'adding', 'spice', 'characters', 'Even', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'get', 'chance', 'provide', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'crewmen', 'end', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'popcorn', 'winner']",N/A

(I don't tend to notice these things.) I've had a bit of a thing for Kurt Russell recently, since watching both Escape From LA/New York, and hey, Goldie Hawn plays the ultimate ditzy blonde a lot of the time. My favourite kind of character quite frankly.Overboard is a pretty simplistic storyline, but it definitely has that Garry Marshall magic (including Hector Elizondo appearing albeit very briefly and with a dodgy accent). Goldie, playing Joanna, is a rich snooty woman, who's married to a man obviously for his money. He wants kids, she does everything she can to not get pregnant. On their yacht, she wants her walk-in wardrobe done up it's just not up to her standards, so she hires a carpenter. Enter Kurt, playing Dean, a distinctly lower class, who gives Joanna every reason to look down her nose at him. He makes her new shoe racks out of the wrong wood, she throws him off the yacht, along with his tools.She falls off the boat while looking for her precious wedding rings, gets amnesia, and wakes up in hospital/psychiatric ward, annoying every staff member until they want her off their hands as quick as possible. Along comes Dean, to regain the $600+ money she owed him, and quickly comes up with the idea she's his wife. She has no choice but to go along with this, as she has no recollection of anything, and he takes her back to his shack. Four unruly kids, and lots of chores, you can see the rest coming!It's quite a sweet film, especially when 'Annie' (her new name) begins to settle in, and even begins to love the kids, and take care of them. There's the usual hilarious scenes, especially when she's been used to having everything done for her before.Goldie and Kurt make an absolutely lovely couple in this.

411815,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6304286511,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[8, 15]","Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell bring their real-life chemistry to this movie. It should however be rated R for all the sparks flying all over the place!While I enjoyed this movie, I do not recommend it for kids of any age! A few scenes are a bit much and they go a bit overboard on some issues. A la Goldie bending over in a very revealing bathing suit or the kids talking about issues far above their age level.There are some hysterically funny scenes in which I almost cried from laughing so much.To understand why it is SO funny, you just have to imagine how a rich woman would feel if she was dropped off in the worst hell she could imagine.The basic story is that Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn) is a demanding and pampered wife who stops off in a tiny Oregon town. She employs carpenter Dean Proffitt (who doesn't make any profit...), to revamp her yacht closets. When he completes the job, Dean asks to be paid and is told the job is not good enough (she wants cedar and he made them in oak!) and therefore he must ""eat"" the costs.At a convenient moment, Joanna tosses Dean (Kurt Russell) overboard along with his tools and work belt. Then, Joanna falls overboard later when looking for her wedding ring and gets amnesia.Dean finds a way for her to ""pay up"" for his carpentry work and the result is a hillarious story even a feminist would have to laugh at! The reason we don't feel sorry for Joanna is because she was so mean to Dean and didn't pay him for his work when he needed the money for his family.This movie has the best last scene of any movie I have ever seen! No lies. I adore the ending.The reason I like some movies so much is that they take items from the start of the movie and weave then so nicely into other parts of the story line.Similar to ""Captain Ron"" in humor, but this was way more funny! I guess I didn't appreciate the swearing and other items that they threw in here and there, but the overall story was a hoot! This movie could have been a family movie if they had taken out various aspects.The kids in the movie are a wild bunch to start with and change throughout the movie. Parents will relate well to this movie. However, I didn't like how Joanna treated the teacher although we can just say she was true to her character in that part of the movie.One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Rebecca Review",5,The funniest Goldie Hawn movie I have ever seen...,995932800,"07 24, 2001",2001,2346,"['Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'bring', 'real-life', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'should', 'however', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'sparks', 'flying', 'place', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'kids', 'age', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'much', 'go', 'bit', 'overboard', 'issues', 'la', 'Goldie', 'bending', 'over', 'very', 'revealing', 'bathing', 'suit', 'kids', 'talking', 'issues', 'far', 'age', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'scenes', 'almost', 'cried', 'laughing', 'so', 'much.To', 'understand', 'why', 'SO', 'funny', 'just', 'have', 'imagine', 'how', 'rich', 'woman', 'would', 'feel', 'was', 'dropped', 'off', 'worst', 'hell', 'could', 'imagine.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Joanna', 'Stayton', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'demanding', 'pampered', 'wife', 'who', 'off', 'tiny', 'Oregon', 'town', 'carpenter', 'Dean', 'Proffitt', 'who', ""n't"", 'make', 'profit', 'revamp', 'yacht', 'closets', 'When', 'job', 'Dean', 'be', 'paid', 'told', 'job', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'cedar', 'made', 'oak', 'therefore', 'must', 'eat', 'costs.At', 'convenient', 'moment', 'Joanna', 'Dean', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'overboard', 'tools', 'work', 'belt', 'Then', 'Joanna', 'overboard', 'later', 'when', 'looking', 'wedding', 'ring', 'amnesia.Dean', 'finds', 'way', 'pay', 'up', 'carpentry', 'work', 'result', 'hillarious', 'story', 'even', 'feminist', 'would', 'have', 'laugh', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'Joanna', 'was', 'so', 'mean', 'Dean', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'work', 'when', 'needed', 'money', 'family.This', 'movie', 'best', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'lies', 'adore', 'ending.The', 'reason', 'like', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'take', 'items', 'start', 'movie', 'weave', 'then', 'so', 'nicely', 'other', 'parts', 'story', 'line.Similar', 'Captain', 'Ron', 'humor', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'funny', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'swearing', 'other', 'items', 'threw', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'story', 'was', 'hoot', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'family', 'movie', 'had', 'taken', 'out', 'various', 'aspects.The', 'kids', 'movie', 'are', 'wild', 'bunch', 'start', 'change', 'movie', 'Parents', 'will', 'relate', 'well', 'movie', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'Joanna', 'treated', 'teacher', 'can', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'true', 'character', 'part', 'movie.One', 'funniest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

It is just another run-of-the-mill &quot;comedy&quot; that is boring and not funny at all.  The movie is very predictable throughout the whole film.  The premise is good but the way the director and the cast carry out with it is horrible.  Kurt Russel is trying to play a different role in this movie and I think he should just stick with his usual.  Goldie Hawn does the best that she can with her role but I don't think anybody could make it great.
