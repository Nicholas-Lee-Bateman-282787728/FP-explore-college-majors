However, a lot of the plot is what Hitchcock would call the ""maguffin"" -- the 'whatever' on which to hang the script.The real center of this series is the contrast of class.  The two central characters have an unexpressed love for each other which subtly supercedes and cancels out any other relationships that they try to form.  It is not a love of bump and grind, but rather a deep respect, a reaching out past class distinctions, and a primary need to see each other every day.

But they are only behaviours that we have learned from our society, and there are times to act in defiance of them, to fly in the face of their conventions because it is right to do so.""- Inspector Lynley  (Well Schooled in Murder)The setting of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley mysteries is England and this story is set at a private boys school called Bredgar Chambers School.  The code of silence may be reminiscent of the military; but it is alive and well at this boys school where a murder of a 13 year old boy takes place.  Why was a boy from a working class family murdered and who was culpable is the case that Inspector Thomas (Tommy) Lynley of Scotland Yard is called by his former boyhood friend to solve.  Lynley is played by Nathanial Parker; and is a rather posh inspector who is also an earl.  His sidekick is played by Sharon Small (Sergeant Havers) and she is from a diametrically opposed background from a working class family.  She is not terribly good with authority and has a bit of a chip on her shoulder.Some of the same actors from The History Boys are cast in some of the roles and the acting is very well done.Though only boys, there is the grim undercurrent of rules being broken and bad behavior being covered up leading to the ultimate cover up -  a murder of a 13 year old boy.The cover ups unravel and more than one death occurs in the sinister image conscious environment of this upper class English boarding school; possibly more concerned with its image, reputation and funding versus uncovering the cause of death of one of its students; who as it turned out marched to a different drummer and followed his principles and conscience; because these were his standards and his personal codes.Interesting character study of Lynley created by American mystery writer Elizabeth George.Recommended B+Bentley 2008",4,Code of Silence,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,1989,"['live', 'codes', 'Lynley', 'thought', 'call', 'morals', 'standards', 'values', 'ethics', 'were', 'part', 'genetic', 'make', 'up', 'are', 'only', 'behaviours', 'have', 'learned', 'society', 'are', 'times', 'act', 'defiance', 'fly', 'face', 'conventions', 'right', 'do', 'so', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Well', 'Schooled', 'Murder', 'setting', 'Elizabeth', 'George', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'mysteries', 'England', 'story', 'set', 'private', 'boys', 'school', 'called', 'Bredgar', 'Chambers', 'School', 'code', 'silence', 'may', 'be', 'reminiscent', 'military', 'alive', 'well', 'boys', 'school', 'where', 'murder', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'place', 'Why', 'was', 'boy', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'murdered', 'who', 'was', 'culpable', 'case', 'Inspector', 'Thomas', 'Tommy', 'Lynley', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'called', 'former', 'boyhood', 'friend', 'solve', 'Lynley', 'played', 'Nathanial', 'Parker', 'rather', 'posh', 'inspector', 'who', 'also', 'earl', 'sidekick', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'Sergeant', 'Havers', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'background', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'not', 'terribly', 'good', 'authority', 'bit', 'chip', 'shoulder.Some', 'same', 'actors', 'History', 'Boys', 'are', 'cast', 'roles', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'grim', 'undercurrent', 'rules', 'being', 'broken', 'bad', 'behavior', 'being', 'covered', 'up', 'leading', 'ultimate', 'cover', 'up', 'murder', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy.The', 'cover', 'ups', 'unravel', 'more', 'one', 'death', 'sinister', 'image', 'conscious', 'environment', 'upper', 'class', 'English', 'boarding', 'school', 'possibly', 'more', 'concerned', 'image', 'reputation', 'funding', 'versus', 'uncovering', 'cause', 'death', 'one', 'students', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'marched', 'different', 'drummer', 'followed', 'principles', 'conscience', 'were', 'standards', 'personal', 'codes.Interesting', 'character', 'study', 'Lynley', 'created', 'American', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Elizabeth', 'George.Recommended', 'B+Bentley', '2008']",N/A

There is something I liked about the series from the start, so I kept trying, and it got better with each episode.That being said, the mysteries themselves seem to be a little contrived at times. Also, it seems that the story time gets close to the end, and they have to hurry and solve the case. That can be a little disorienting.Lynley is an Earl, and so some of the characters dislike him solely on that basis, and this does seem very unfair as he is very ""democratic"". His partner, Havers, is a lady cop with an attitude of sorts and ribs Lynley about being an Earl at times. Must be a British thing. Seems like Havers and others think that Lynley needs to apologize for having that ""stately home"" in the country.Don't get the wrong idea, the series has grown on me, and I will continue with it.

ALL video adaptations of books go through the requisite editing in order to conform to time constraints, but I feel that, in this case, the screenplays are well written, and, above all, well acted.Nathaniel Parker comes to the series with very impressive credentials, from previous sterling portrayals of historic and biblical figures, and of characters from classic literature.  In this series, he once again proves his versatility, with top-notch performances as Inspector Lynley.Sharon Small is an absolute delight as Sgt. Havers -- the polar opposite of Lynley, in upbringing and in attitude.  The developing rapport, humorous banter, and verbal sparring between the two characters provides added interest and enjoyment to the plot.I do not interpret their relationship as ""romantic,"" but there is certainly a developing closeness, sensitivity, and mutual respect which they exhibit toward one another, and which is not uncommon between partners working together daily in a stressful profession. He naturally feels empathy toward her, in her trials and tribulations of caring for her mentally and physically handicapped elderly parents -- he would rightly be termed a ""cad,"" if he turned a blind eye to her suffering -- and she is sensitive toward his feelings of hurt and betrayal, in his unhappy and unsatisfying relationships with the opposite sex, even going so far as to ""make herself scarce"" when they unexpectedly come across the object of his affection --i.e., ""Helen"" -- in one episode of the series.I look forward to future episodes in this series, and highly recommend them to anyone seeking quality entertainment.

Thurlow,"[1, 1]","""The Inspector Lynley Mysteries-Set 1"" picks up where the pilot movie ""A Great Deliverance"" left off, as aristocratic New Scotland Yard Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and working class Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers combine their unique skills and intriguing relationship to solve crimes in four excellent 90 minute episodes.""Well-Schooled in Murder"" takes Lynley and Havers to an elite boarding school to investigate the seemingly ritualistic murder of a student.  They uncover a web of deceit and an array of suspects.  Their investigation is complicated by Lynley's old friendship with one of the teachers, and turns into a race against time to save another student's life.""Payment in Blood"" is a closed house murder mystery, except that the suspects are the cast of a play, and one of them is Lynley's long-lost love Helen.  Havers must keep Lynley on task as they sort through the complicated past of the suspects to identify the killer and save the surviving cast members.""For the Sake of Elena"" brings the two detectives to Cambridge to solve the murder of a young deaf girl, whose parents and associates all seem to have motive.  Havers is distracted by the care of her ailing mother, while Lynley again encounters his old friend Helen.""Missing Joseph"" takes the two dectectives to a visually stunning Peak District parish to solve the mysterious poisoning of a vicar by one of several likely suspects.  This episode highlights Lynley's affection for Helen while expanding his relationship with Havers. Lynley's attempt to help Havers with the refurbishing of her apartment leads to an argument pregnant with nuances about their relationship.The mysteries are presented in a realistic fashion; the viewer only rarely knows more than our two detectives.  Clues must be sorted through and solutions are often complicated and messy.  Splendid location shooting adds to the fun.  However, the heart of the series is the slowly evolving relationship between Lynley and Havers.  Their differing backgrounds are a frequent source of friction; yet the two bicker with a sense of restraint based on mutual respect.  The intuitive Lynley offers Havers professional respect and basic decency she doesn't get from other officers; Havers is a good and loyal subordinate but has no qualms about bringing Lynley up short in private when he gets overbearing.  The episodes reinforce the subtle sense that this partnership has lots of growth in front of it.""The Inspector Lynley Mysteries-Set 1"" is very highly recommended as good entertainment to fans of Masterpiece Mysteries, who will enjoy a second look at these episodes and perhaps a first look at the one they missed.",5,Partnership in Crime...,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,2671,"['Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries-Set', '1', 'up', 'where', 'pilot', 'movie', 'Great', 'Deliverance', 'left', 'off', 'aristocratic', 'New', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Thomas', 'Lynley', 'working', 'class', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Barbara', 'Havers', 'combine', 'unique', 'skills', 'intriguing', 'relationship', 'solve', 'crimes', 'four', 'excellent', '90', 'minute', 'episodes', 'Well-Schooled', 'Murder', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'elite', 'boarding', 'school', 'investigate', 'seemingly', 'ritualistic', 'murder', 'student', 'uncover', 'web', 'deceit', 'array', 'suspects', 'investigation', 'complicated', 'Lynley', 'old', 'friendship', 'one', 'teachers', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'student', 'life', 'Payment', 'Blood', 'closed', 'house', 'murder', 'mystery', 'suspects', 'are', 'cast', 'play', 'one', 'Lynley', 'long-lost', 'love', 'Helen', 'Havers', 'must', 'keep', 'Lynley', 'task', 'sort', 'complicated', 'past', 'suspects', 'identify', 'killer', 'save', 'surviving', 'cast', 'members', 'Sake', 'Elena', 'two', 'detectives', 'Cambridge', 'solve', 'murder', 'young', 'deaf', 'girl', 'parents', 'seem', 'have', 'motive', 'Havers', 'distracted', 'care', 'ailing', 'mother', 'Lynley', 'again', 'old', 'friend', 'Helen', 'Missing', 'Joseph', 'two', 'dectectives', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Peak', 'District', 'parish', 'solve', 'mysterious', 'poisoning', 'vicar', 'one', 'several', 'likely', 'suspects', 'episode', 'Lynley', 'affection', 'Helen', 'expanding', 'relationship', 'Havers', 'Lynley', 'attempt', 'help', 'Havers', 'refurbishing', 'apartment', 'argument', 'pregnant', 'nuances', 'relationship.The', 'mysteries', 'are', 'presented', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'viewer', 'only', 'rarely', 'more', 'two', 'detectives', 'Clues', 'must', 'be', 'sorted', 'solutions', 'are', 'often', 'complicated', 'messy', 'Splendid', 'location', 'shooting', 'fun', 'However', 'heart', 'series', 'slowly', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'differing', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'frequent', 'source', 'friction', 'two', 'bicker', 'sense', 'restraint', 'based', 'mutual', 'respect', 'intuitive', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'professional', 'respect', 'basic', 'decency', ""n't"", 'get', 'other', 'officers', 'Havers', 'good', 'loyal', 'subordinate', 'qualms', 'bringing', 'Lynley', 'up', 'short', 'private', 'when', 'overbearing', 'episodes', 'reinforce', 'subtle', 'sense', 'partnership', 'lots', 'growth', 'front', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries-Set', '1', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'good', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'Masterpiece', 'Mysteries', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'second', 'look', 'episodes', 'perhaps', 'first', 'look', 'one', 'missed']",N/A

If you are not a EG fan, or if you can shut the books out of your mind while you watch television, you may enjoy these.  Friends of mine who have never read Elizabeth George liked them a lot.I am well aware that visual media are completely different from written media and that a book may require significant adaptation and simplification.  EG's characters often spend a lot of time musing, and that just can't transfer to film very well.What is annoying is that the spirit is lost.  The characters seem to bear little resemblance to their written counterparts in ways that completely throw off their personalities.  It's not so bad that Lynley doesn't look at all as described, the characterization could still work.  Barbara Havers, on the other hand, is struggling with being an irredeemably homely and dowdy woman, she's not a cute little pixie who goes in for a casual look.  It's a major part of her personality, her whole worldview and her interactions with other people are affected by her self-image.

Aside from John Thaw's superb acting, Morse was a far more interesting character than Lynley.  Lynley is just a bit too perfect to really identify with.  Nathaniel Parker is a pretty good actor - it's his character that's the problem.  Lynley would be an upper-class ""twit"" if it weren't that underneath all his good breeding he is basically a decent human being.Sharon Small does an excellent job as Inspector Sergeant Havers,  I think better than Kevin Whately in the Morse series.  In fact, the Lynley series gets most of its dramatic strength from the slight lunacy Havers brings to her relationship with Lynley.  Havers is highly IMperfect, to the point that no one will work with her but Lynley.  Yet she somehow muddles through, sometimes in a big way, which is a big surprise to everyone, including Havers.Lesley Vickerage does an excellent job as Lynley's love interest, a brilliant and neurotic psychologist and criminal profiler.  In the later series she provides additional human complexity to offset Lynley's superb and gentlemanly perfection.The plots in this first series are not as good as those in the later ones.  Still, the view of England and English society is interesting, even if it's just TV.  The cultural divergeance between America and England continues, to the point that Havers' accent is often completely incomprehensible, at least to my ear.  It's somewhat surprising that an American could write novels about England and English society that are so well-accepted by the English.Enjoyable viewing for fans of English mysteries.",4,"Entertaining, but not as good as Morse.",1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,1856,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novels', 'Elizabeth', 'George', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'film', 'versions', 'novels', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'originals.The', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'dramas', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'superior', 'ways', 'Aside', 'John', 'Thaw', 'superb', 'acting', 'Morse', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'Lynley', 'Lynley', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'perfect', 'really', 'identify', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'character', 'problem', 'Lynley', 'would', 'be', 'upper-class', 'twit', 'were', ""n't"", 'underneath', 'good', 'breeding', 'basically', 'decent', 'human', 'being.Sharon', 'Small', 'excellent', 'job', 'Inspector', 'Sergeant', 'Havers', 'think', 'better', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'Morse', 'series', 'fact', 'Lynley', 'series', 'most', 'dramatic', 'strength', 'slight', 'lunacy', 'Havers', 'relationship', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'highly', 'IMperfect', 'point', 'one', 'will', 'work', 'Lynley', 'somehow', 'muddles', 'sometimes', 'big', 'way', 'big', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'including', 'Havers.Lesley', 'Vickerage', 'excellent', 'job', 'Lynley', 'love', 'interest', 'brilliant', 'neurotic', 'psychologist', 'criminal', 'profiler', 'later', 'series', 'additional', 'human', 'complexity', 'offset', 'Lynley', 'superb', 'gentlemanly', 'perfection.The', 'plots', 'first', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'later', 'ones', 'Still', 'view', 'England', 'English', 'society', 'interesting', 'even', 'just', 'TV', 'cultural', 'divergeance', 'America', 'England', 'point', 'Havers', 'accent', 'often', 'completely', 'incomprehensible', 'least', 'ear', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'American', 'could', 'write', 'novels', 'England', 'English', 'society', 'are', 'so', 'well-accepted', 'English.Enjoyable', 'viewing', 'fans', 'English', 'mysteries']",N/A

Nathaniel Parker is superb as the Oxford educated detective Lynley (in other words ""Upper Class"".) and Sharon Small is wonderful as the working class cop Havers.

Can't believe they dropped the actress who played Lady Helen in the Pilot.  This woman is not only very plain, makes Havers look like a great beauty but she is wearing no make up, hair looks like she just crawled out of bed, huge nose, wrinkles and bears no more resemblance to the character in the books than I do.  Horrible casting.  Every time she comes on screen I just cringe.  If she is in all the other episodes of this series I'll be very disappointed.  Hope they haven't changed any of the other actors.  The actor cast as Rys is just as bad.  Where do they get these people. Later:  I have now seen the episode WELL SCHOOLED IN MURDER and am more than ever convinced that these books cannot be translated well to the screen in 90 minutes.  The stories are too complicated.  Racing through it, just throwing in anything here and there, does nothing but confuse people. Of course I know that they have to leave out the darkest parts of the books and substitute something not so horrific but they needed to do a better job of writing the scripts so that they include more of the actual story.  Frankly, I had read Well Schooled in Murder again recently and still this episode hardly made any sense at all to me. Re: Helen, if this series continues till she is shot, I doubt if anyone will care.  What a boring unpleasant frump. Ruins every scene she is in.  If Ms George had a problem with the casting of Havers I can't imagine what she thought of the casting of Helen after the pilot of the series. Have just looked at FOR THE SAKE OF ELENA and it is a much better adaptation of the book. They dropped one of the main characters but it didn't matter to the story.  Other than that they adhered to the book pretty well. However, they did not include the real reason the murder was committed opting for something more bland.

To do so, George's intricate, nuanced plots were butchered, and her complex character interactions reduced to mind-numbing simplicity.

Nathaniel Parker plays Lynley, and while he seems a good fit, he just doesn't fit the bill. Sharon Small plays Barbara Havers,and she is superb. The television version is not as good or solid as the book, but it is a pleasant series.The  career of playwright Joy Sinclair comes to an end on an estate in the Scottish Highlands, when she is found dead. Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner, Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, are requested by his superior to look into the death.  a famous London theatrical producer has high prestige and this murder must be handled withnaplomb. What makes this film unbelievable is that Lynley's sometime paramour,  Helen Clyde isca guestnat the estate and must be considered a suspect until cleated. the DI Lynley I know would have excused himself atbthe ouset because of conflict of interest. if this case ever went to court, it would be thrown out. The list of suspects is long and time is not on their side. Many  of the guests seem nefarious and it takes awhile to single the mystery out.  Lynley and Havers must tread carefully through the complicated mass of relationships while they work to solve the case. Havers is always someone rooting for the lower caste and the class distinction is something she finds trying.Of note, Idris Ela has a small part in this episode.

750373,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00008YLV0,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","If you're on the lookout for a British detective series starring acclaimed actors as steadfast colleges despite being total opposites, then here's the show for you. Though each episode encompasses an investigative drama, the real appeal of ""Inspector Lynley"" lies in watching its lead characters trying to overcome the fact that there couldn't be two more different human beings on the planet.Inspector Tommy Lynley is the eighth Earl of Asherton and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers is strictly working-class, meaning that they butt heads on practically opinion that it's possible to have. Their superiors decide to throw them together for a murder investigation, hoping that their personalities will prove too much for them to cope with, thereby giving them the perfect excuse to demote the antagonistic Havers into insignificance. Yet the combination of his charm and her instincts leads to a mutually beneficial partnership - one that works better than either could have ever foreseen.And so begins one of the greatest teams in police procedural dramas. As it turns out, the one thing they have in common is what makes them so compatible: personal integrity.Based on the books by Elizabeth George, Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small may not be a perfect physical match for the literary Lynley and Havers, but each captures the spirit of their characters to perfection. Parker's Lynley is well-spoken, fair-minded, and clearly the product of an Oxford education, whilst Small's Havers is short-tempered, quick-tongued and lower class.With his baritone voice and rugged good looks, Parker was a shoe-in for the role of Lynley (despite being described as a blonde Adonis-like figure in the books), but apparently Elizabeth George was a little concerned at the slender and rather pretty Small playing the unattractive and rotund Havers. However, Small's performance won her over, for the actress's take on Barbara Havers perfectly captures the character's sharpness, vulnerability, gruffness and wit. She's a joy to watch, especially paired with Parker.To say they've both got personal problems is an understatement. Havers struggles with elderly parents suffering from dementia, whilst Lynley has just watched his best friend marry the woman he's still in love with - though after the two-part premiere, this is dropped entirely for the sake of a subplot that involves his pursuit of a long-time friend and college Helen Clyde. (Unfortunately, it's Helen's characterization that proves to be the weak spot in an otherwise sterling show: though she's played with elegance and grace by Emma Fielding in the pilot, her replacement Lesley Vickerage's take on the character is generally considered unpleasant and dull. It's difficult to see what on earth Lynley sees in her).Season one is comprised of six ninety-minute episodes, including the two-part premiere. Episodes include:""A Great Deliverance"": A Yorkshire farmer is found beheaded in his barn, his blood-stained daughter sitting catatonically beside him, staring into nothing. In a small town that's full of secrets, the duo find ways to wheedle, coax, threaten and demand information from the close-lipped locals, as well as stand up to the area's openly hostile police force.""Well Schooled in Murder"": The death of a twelve year old boy at a private boarding school puts Lynley back in touch with an old school chum who might well be involved in the death.""Payment in Blood"": After a playwright is found murdered on a country estate filled with actors (and suspects), Lynley and Havers begin to suspect that some last-minute changes to the screenplay might have been the reason for her death. Not helping is the fact that Helen (Lynley's would-be love interest) is one of those staying at the house.""For the Sake of Elena"": A deaf but apparently promiscuous college student is shot on an early-morning jog. It turns out that she was fourteen weeks pregnant, meaning that the killer might be one of several young men trying to protect their reputations - or else the answer lies closer to home, with parents that were strangely ashamed of their daughter's disability.""Missing Joseph"": A priest is poisoned after a meal at a friend's house, even though the host was a trained herbalist and should have known the difference between parsnip and water-hemlock (the cause of death). But what if someone else managed to slip the hemlock into the food? Who was really the intended victim?None of these mysteries quite fits into the ""cozy"" category, as the subject matter and tone is rather too bleak for that (at least in my opinion), though each crimes comes complete with the requisite red herrings, range of suspects, and psychological profiling. There are some amusing glimpses back into the early 2000s, what with the giant laptops and cell-phones, as well as some beautiful rural townships and countryside vistas on display. You're also never quite sure who's going to pop up in these types of shows, and you'll be surprised at how many familiar faces appear prior to their big breaks. Look out for Idris Elba, James McAvoy and Henry Cavill pre-Hollywood careers.But it's really Parker and Small as Lynley and Havers that you should tune in to see. Both have appeared in plenty of other projects over the course of their separate careers, but I think there can be no doubt that Lynley and Havers will be their defining roles. And this is just the beginning - the series ran for seven seasons and can be purchased separately, or as acomplete boxed set.",5,"""You Resign, I Resign...""",1396224000,"03 31,

750377,A2MK9WHALPQ5AY,B00008YLV0,"skytwo ""skytwo""","[68, 72]","I've been catching episodes of Mystery for well over a decade, and to be honest, most of the time it just bores me to tears.  I was always attracted to Chandler, Hammett, and John D. MacDonald, when it came to reading mysteries.  On the other hand, I've really enjoyed some Dorothy L. Sayers and some Conan Doyle efforts.So the curious can see how I might have been turned off by the BBC's more quaint efforts, like the annoyingly effete Poirot, or even the overly-PC Heat of the Sun, or whatever it was called.  The series just seems to try too hard sometimes.  Then again, I was crazy about the Cadfael series.  So I'm always willing to give take another chance.And man, did I hit the jackpot when I caught the second half of 'A Great Deliverance' here in Boston a couple of years ago.  I was astonished, but soon forgot about the project, thinking that it was over and done with.  Then I caught part of 'For the Sake of Elena.'  Again impressed.  Finally, a few weeks ago, I happened to catch 'Playing for the Ashes,' and once again I was floored.  I decided that I had to own them all.  Immediately.Here's the deal:1) The shows are cast to perfection.  Lynley and Havers are utterly believable in their roles, and manage to achieve that most impressive feat of acting-- conveying in a glance more than is actually said.  The most emotionally intense moments are those where little is actually said.2) The mysteries are solid.  While they do make some use of 'trendy' issues (animal rights) and sometimes take another trip to the well of British stereotypes (the lovely hamlet with a dark secret, or the exclusive boys' school with... a dark secret), the stories are so sensitively handled, and so consistently avoid cliches (even in such familiar settings), that they never come across as exploitative or schlocky.3) The inner lives of the detectives are handled brilliantly.  As with the settings, they could easily be hackneyed, but always remain a cut or two above.  Havers is a hard-bitten gal with a damn hard life and a grudge against the privileged, while Lynley's an upper-crusty type who always has to prove that he's not a corrupt glory-hound or a stuffed shirt-- and his personal struggle is every bit as intense as the personal crusades of Philip Marlowe.  Then there's his rocky personal life, which is diametrically opposed to the classic 40's PI experience.  Whew!It all sounds like a mismatched cop buddy-movie, but the episodes are directed with such confidence, and with such a de-emphasis of these potential pitfalls, that we're able to experience the emotional impact without ever yawning at the premise.Apart from all that, the Inspector Lynley Myesteries belie their TV roots every step of the way.  The photography is stunning, the production design is outstanding, the stories are wonderfully complex, the dialogue is sharp (and in a nod to noir, missing a single line of dialogue can mean that you lose track of the narrative-- listen carefully, and rewind as necessary), and best of all the actors are talented and wonderfully suited to their roles.I have a collection of about 200 DVDs, but these are the first TV offerings to grace my collection.  And I continue to announce that fact with pride to any (fellow?) movie snobs I encounter.One complaint-- the DVDs present the episodes in just the same format you would see on PBS.  Same sponsor ads, minimal menu options (forget about extras-- I was particularly amused by the teaser of 'web access to the Mystery site' offering on the case, which is nothing more than an ad for pbs.org-- shame on you guys!), and a generally half-baked presentation.  Nice packaging, though, and the picture quality of the videos is top-notch.  Highly recommended.Finally, I haven't read the books.  And I'm not sure I want to at this point.  This series has created such an intensely believable tableaux that I'm afraid the more detailed world of George's fiction would detract from my own interaction with the series.  That's a first for me.  I'm a 'book purist,' so I'm still fairly shocked myself.",4,"Boy, there's just something about this series....",1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,4065,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'catching', 'episodes', 'Mystery', 'well', 'decade', 'be', 'honest', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'tears', 'was', 'always', 'attracted', 'Chandler', 'Hammett', 'John', 'D.', 'MacDonald', 'when', 'came', 'reading', 'mysteries', 'other', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Dorothy', 'L.', 'Sayers', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'curious', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'off', 'BBC', 'more', 'quaint', 'efforts', 'annoyingly', 'effete', 'Poirot', 'even', 'overly-PC', 'Heat', 'Sun', 'whatever', 'was', 'called', 'series', 'just', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'crazy', 'Cadfael', 'series', ""'m"", 'always', 'willing', 'give', 'take', 'chance.And', 'man', 'did', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'when', 'caught', 'second', 'half', 'A', 'Great', 'Deliverance', 'here', 'Boston', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'astonished', 'soon', 'forgot', 'project', 'thinking', 'was', 'over', 'done', 'Then', 'caught', 'part', 'Sake', 'Elena', 'Again', 'impressed', 'Finally', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'happened', 'catch', ""'Playing"", 'Ashes', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'floored', 'decided', 'had', 'own', 'Immediately.Here', 'deal:1', 'shows', 'are', 'cast', 'perfection', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'are', 'utterly', 'believable', 'roles', 'manage', 'achieve', 'most', 'impressive', 'feat', 'acting', 'conveying', 'glance', 'more', 'actually', 'said', 'most', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'moments', 'are', 'where', 'little', 'actually', 'said.2', 'mysteries', 'are', 'solid', 'do', 'make', 'use', ""'trendy"", 'issues', 'animal', 'rights', 'sometimes', 'take', 'trip', 'well', 'British', 'stereotypes', 'lovely', 'hamlet', 'dark', 'secret', 'exclusive', 'boys', 'school', 'dark', 'secret', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'sensitively', 'handled', 'so', 'consistently', 'avoid', 'cliches', 'even', 'such', 'familiar', 'settings', 'never', 'come', 'exploitative', 'schlocky.3', 'inner', 'lives', 'detectives', 'are', 'handled', 'brilliantly', 'settings', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'hackneyed', 'always', 'remain', 'cut', 'two', 'Havers', 'hard-bitten', 'gal', 'damn', 'hard', 'life', 'grudge', 'privileged', 'Lynley', 'upper-crusty', 'type', 'who', 'always', 'prove', 'not', 'corrupt', 'glory-hound', 'stuffed', 'shirt', 'personal', 'struggle', 'bit', 'as', 'intense', 'personal', 'crusades', 'Philip', 'Marlowe', 'Then', 'rocky', 'personal', 'life', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'classic', '40', 'PI', 'experience', 'Whew', 'mismatched', 'cop', 'buddy-movie', 'episodes', 'are', 'directed', 'such', 'confidence', 'such', 'de-emphasis', 'potential', 'pitfalls', ""'re"", 'able', 'experience', 'emotional', 'impact', 'ever', 'yawning', 'premise.Apart', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Myesteries', 'belie', 'TV', 'roots', 'step', 'way', 'photography', 'stunning', 'production', 'design', 'outstanding', 'stories', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'complex', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'nod', 'noir', 'missing', 'single', 'line', 'dialogue', 'can', 'mean', 'lose', 'track', 'narrative', 'listen', 'carefully', 'rewind', 'necessary', 'best', 'actors', 'are', 'talented', 'wonderfully', 'suited', 'roles.I', 'have', 'collection', '200', 'DVDs', 'are', 'first', 'TV', 'offerings', 'grace', 'collection', 'continue', 'announce', 'fact', 'pride', 'fellow', 'movie', 'snobs', 'encounter.One', 'complaint', 'DVDs', 'present', 'episodes', 'just', 'same', 'format', 'would', 'see', 'PBS', 'Same', 'sponsor', 'ads', 'minimal', 'menu', 'options', 'forget', 'extras', 'was', 'particularly', 'amused', 'teaser', ""'web"", 'access', 'Mystery', 'site', 'offering', 'case', 'nothing', 'more', 'ad', 'pbs.org', 'shame', 'guys', 'generally', 'half-baked', 'presentation', 'Nice', 'packaging', 'picture', 'quality', 'videos', 'top-notch', 'Highly', 'recommended.Finally', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'want', 'point', 'series', 'created', 'intensely', 'believable', 'tableaux', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'more', 'detailed', 'world', 'George', 'fiction', 'would', 'detract', 'own', 'interaction', 'series', 'first', ""'m"", ""'book"", 'purist', ""'m"", 'still', 'fairly', 'shocked']",N/A

I was not overly impressed with the book, to be honest, and was a bit wary about watching the show.  But all of the issues I had with the books were neatly and wonderfully resolved with the magic of television.I never had a problem with the storyline or plot of the book - the mysteries are good and solid and translate well into television.  My issues were with the writing (descriptive, not dialogue) and mostly with the character of Havers.  I think you're supposed to like her in the books, or at least not hate her, but the mental image the descriptions brought to my mind were revolting.  She just seems completely unlikeable and annoying, and I really could not understand her interactions with a lot of the other characters.  Even her physical description was hard for me to wrap my head around.In the series, though, the questions about her appearance are put to rest and she seems a lot less irritating.  The character on the show is a little offbeat and prickly, but in a likable way.  Perhaps if I've kept reading the books I would have eventually come to like her character, but from the first episode of the show I enjoyed her and Lynley and their interactions.I still probably won't read any more of the books, but will definitely be checking out the rest of the series.

750380,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00008YLV0,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","The Inspector Lynley Mysteries is a superior production, with an intelligent script, and excellent acting talent. Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small make a formidable investigative duo as DI Tommy Lynley and DS Barbara Havers. Part of the show's charm lies in the banter between the aristocratic Lynley and the more humble Havers. Both of these characters grow with the show through the series, and it is such a wonderful treat to see two dignified people with the utmost respect for each other who develop a deep and genuine friendship over the course of the show.In Series 1, there are four episodes (running about 1.5 hours each):Well-Schooled in Murder - When a young student at the prestigious private boys' school, Bredger Hall is found murdered, DI Lynley and DS Havers have their work cut out for them. The headmaster, teachers, and boys are tight-lipped, refusing to divulge any hidden secrets at the school. Havers finds the situation awkward given her own humble beginnings and the posh nature of the school. But there are dark secrets within the walls of the school, and both Lynley and Havers gradually unmask the killer.Payment in Blood - Lynley and Havers go to a Scottish mansion owned by a renowned playwright, and Lynley finds himself flummoxed when Lady Helen (the criminal profiler) to whom he is attracted, is part of the group of suspects in the murder of a publisher.For the Sake of Elena- When the beautiful, deaf daughter of a Cambridge professor is found murdered, Lynley and Havers find out that the victim, Elena, led a wild and promiscuous life. But is that what led to her death, or are there darker motives at work?Missing Joseph - Lynley and Havers travel to a bucolic Lancashire village, where the local vicar has been found murdered. Looks like the sleepy hamlet may be hiding a killer.Part of what makes this series fascinating is the setting. Often the backdrop to the stories appear to be peaceful, serene places which makes the crimes seem all the more ghastly. The series also explores the human psyche, and the way seemingly ordinary humans can be driven to terrible acts out of desperation. I'd recommend all six seasons of this amazing show to any fan of intelligent, well-acted British crime dramas. This series is also low on the gore factor, unlike another excellent crime drama, The Wire in the Blood series (which is not for the faint of heart).",5,"Engaging ""cozy"" mysteries",1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,2391,"['Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'superior', 'production', 'intelligent', 'script', 'excellent', 'acting', 'talent', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'make', 'formidable', 'investigative', 'duo', 'DI', 'Tommy', 'Lynley', 'DS', 'Barbara', 'Havers', 'Part', 'show', 'charm', 'banter', 'aristocratic', 'Lynley', 'more', 'humble', 'Havers', 'characters', 'grow', 'show', 'series', 'such', 'wonderful', 'treat', 'see', 'two', 'dignified', 'people', 'utmost', 'respect', 'other', 'who', 'develop', 'deep', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'course', 'show.In', 'Series', '1', 'are', 'four', 'episodes', 'running', 'about', '1.5', 'hours', 'Well-Schooled', 'Murder', 'When', 'young', 'student', 'prestigious', 'private', 'boys', 'school', 'Bredger', 'Hall', 'found', 'murdered', 'DI', 'Lynley', 'DS', 'Havers', 'have', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'headmaster', 'teachers', 'boys', 'are', 'tight-lipped', 'refusing', 'divulge', 'hidden', 'secrets', 'school', 'Havers', 'situation', 'awkward', 'given', 'own', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'posh', 'nature', 'school', 'are', 'dark', 'secrets', 'walls', 'school', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'gradually', 'killer.Payment', 'Blood', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'go', 'Scottish', 'mansion', 'owned', 'renowned', 'playwright', 'Lynley', 'flummoxed', 'when', 'Lady', 'Helen', 'criminal', 'profiler', 'whom', 'attracted', 'part', 'group', 'suspects', 'murder', 'publisher.For', 'Sake', 'Elena-', 'When', 'beautiful', 'deaf', 'daughter', 'Cambridge', 'professor', 'found', 'murdered', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'find', 'out', 'victim', 'Elena', 'led', 'wild', 'promiscuous', 'life', 'what', 'led', 'death', 'are', 'there', 'darker', 'motives', 'work', 'Missing', 'Joseph', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'travel', 'bucolic', 'Lancashire', 'village', 'where', 'local', 'vicar', 'been', 'found', 'murdered', 'sleepy', 'hamlet', 'may', 'be', 'hiding', 'killer.Part', 'what', 'series', 'fascinating', 'setting', 'backdrop', 'stories', 'appear', 'be', 'peaceful', 'serene', 'places', 'crimes', 'seem', 'more', 'ghastly', 'series', 'also', 'human', 'psyche', 'way', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'humans', 'can', 'be', 'driven', 'terrible', 'acts', 'desperation', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'six', 'seasons', 'amazing', 'show', 'fan', 'intelligent', 'well-acted', 'British', 'crime', 'dramas', 'series', 'also', 'low', 'gore', 'factor', 'excellent', 'crime', 'drama', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'series', 'not', 'faint', 'heart']",N/A
