Cyborg creates a Mad Max like setting in a gloomy atmosphere as Gibson(Van Damme) fights to save a female Cyborg who holds the information vital to finding the cure for the plague (which has run amok once again.) Gibson is in a desperate race to get to Atlanta (Georgia)on roads that are left in ruins to deliver the cure before Fender and his evil band of pirates obtain it first for their own wants and greeds. Cyborg displays Van Damme shooting guns, some hand to hand combat martial arts action, and the sense of suspense and Gibson is never safe and always on the run.

This movie is horrible. But, it is typical for a Van Damme flick. Horrible acting, over-produced with that cheesy waxy feel to it, non-existent storyline and the usual idiotic ending. I have to admit though, that I have most of Van Damme's movies. He is a decent Martial Artist. In my opinion his best movies are ""Kickboxer"" and ""Bloodsport"". These are his only movies that are actually enjoyable to watch and somewhat inspiring. I have a few observations / comments / questions to make that should be humorous for the seasoned Van Damme fan: Isn't it funny that with all his millions of dollars that Van Damme can't find a plastic surgeon who can hide that silly bump on his forehead... Why must every character Van Damme plays speak with a French accent? He tries to play a wide variety of different action hero roles but always the character must in some way originate from France. Isn't this preposterous? You'd think if Van Damme was serious about his ""acting"" career he would have attempted to remedy this flaw. I mean, it's not like his acting roles are all that challenging but it would be nice if he was even partially believable in his roles... Why does Van Damme always have to show his bare rear-end so much? Does he think WOMEN are watching his silly movies? You'd think someone would realize that mostly men watch action films and the majority of men have no desire to see his naked backside so WHY SHOW IT? ... Is it me or does Van Damme need a good hair stylist? His hair is especially stupid in CYBORG. He looks like he should be in the cast for ""Revenge of the Nerds""... Speaking of style, was it Van Damme himself who invented that stupid tucked in shirt with pleated Dockers pulled up way too high over the waist with a snazzy belt 80's look? If so, for this deed alone he should be reprimanded... Why was Van Damme such a huge action hero? He is so friggin' short that if you saw him in line behind you at a convenience store I don't think he would look all that intimidating. At least Steven Seagal is tall and tough looking although Van Damme is definitely in better shape. You never see Seagal showing his muscles.... Lastly, even though I can laugh about Van Damme I am definitely a fan. That being said, I wonder if any of his other fans share my sentiments about the producers, directors and just about everyone else involved with most of his many films. I think they should be ashamed of the way they have done their work. Van Damme has alot of heart, maybe not so much as Stallone, but more heart than most action heroes like Shwarzenegger, etc. The people involved with most of Van Damme films have truly done a disservice to him and to action film fans everywhere. They should have taken pride in their work. It's not like they weren't paid handsomely for their services.",1,typical van damme,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,2920,"['THE', 'ROCK', 'who', 'movie', 'looking', 'malnourished', 'rotted', 'teeth', 'sinister', 'contact', 'make-up', 'movie', 'horrible', 'typical', 'Van', 'Damme', 'flick', 'Horrible', 'acting', 'over-produced', 'cheesy', 'waxy', 'feel', 'non-existent', 'storyline', 'usual', 'idiotic', 'ending', 'have', 'admit', 'have', 'most', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movies', 'decent', 'Martial', 'Artist', 'opinion', 'best', 'movies', 'are', 'Kickboxer', 'Bloodsport', 'are', 'only', 'movies', 'are', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'somewhat', 'inspiring', 'have', 'few', 'observations', '/', 'comments', '/', 'questions', 'make', 'should', 'be', 'humorous', 'seasoned', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fan', ""n't"", 'funny', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Van', 'Damme', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'who', 'can', 'hide', 'silly', 'bump', 'forehead', 'Why', 'must', 'character', 'Van', 'Damme', 'speak', 'French', 'accent', 'play', 'wide', 'variety', 'different', 'action', 'hero', 'roles', 'always', 'character', 'must', 'way', 'originate', 'France', ""n't"", 'preposterous', ""'d"", 'think', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'serious', 'acting', 'career', 'would', 'have', 'attempted', 'remedy', 'flaw', 'mean', 'not', 'acting', 'roles', 'are', 'challenging', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'was', 'even', 'partially', 'believable', 'roles', 'Why', 'Van', 'Damme', 'always', 'have', 'show', 'bare', 'rear-end', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'WOMEN', 'are', 'watching', 'silly', 'movies', ""'d"", 'think', 'someone', 'would', 'realize', 'mostly', 'men', 'watch', 'action', 'films', 'majority', 'men', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'naked', 'backside', 'so', 'WHY', 'SHOW', 'IT', 'Van', 'Damme', 'need', 'good', 'hair', 'stylist', 'hair', 'especially', 'stupid', 'CYBORG', 'should', 'be', 'cast', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'Speaking', 'style', 'was', 'Van', 'Damme', 'who', 'invented', 'stupid', 'tucked', 'shirt', 'pleated', 'Dockers', 'pulled', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'waist', 'snazzy', 'belt', '80', 'look', 'so', 'deed', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'reprimanded', 'Why', 'was', 'Van', 'Damme', 'huge', 'action', 'hero', 'so', 'friggin', 'short', 'saw', 'line', 'convenience', 'store', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'look', 'intimidating', 'least', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'tall', 'tough', 'looking', 'Van', 'Damme', 'definitely', 'better', 'shape', 'never', 'see', 'Seagal', 'showing', 'muscles', 'Lastly', 'even', 'can', 'laugh', 'Van', 'Damme', 'am', 'definitely', 'fan', 'being', 'said', 'wonder', 'other', 'fans', 'share', 'sentiments', 'producers', 'directors', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'most', 'many', 'films', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'way', 'have', 'done', 'work', 'Van', 'Damme', 'alot', 'heart', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Stallone', 'more', 'heart', 'most', 'action', 'heroes', 'Shwarzenegger', 'etc', 'people', 'involved', 'most', 'Van', 'Damme', 'films', 'have', 'truly', 'done', 'disservice', 'action', 'film', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'pride', 'work', 'not', 'were', ""n't"", 'paid', 'handsomely', 'services']",N/A

Yes, in the rain.4.Does he have sex with a C-List actress? Yes, some cute brunette (Dayle Hadden)5.Is there a tournament? No, just a battle for survival6.Is training needed for this tournament? No tournament here, but judging by how badly he beats down the enemy lackeys, it doesn't appear that training is needed.7.Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? Several times8.Does he punch someone in the balls?  No, but he engages in a little five-on-two grab move during one fight9.Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Constantly10.Is his enemy unbeatable? Fender Tremolo (Vincent Klyn) is a cyborg who has nearly glowing eyes and a robotic voicebox similar to that of a tracheotomy patient.  He also has a gang of cyborgs at his disposal.11.Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Yes, at one point he literally gets crucified12.Does he win? Despite the fact that he's absolutely pummeled by Fender, and a car door, he somehow manages to win via meat hook.Perhaps the most violent of JCVD's flicks, the action in this one is pretty good.  The fight sequences are a little choppy at times, with the mega-pause between hits, but overall the choreography is solid.

136551,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0792835735,Jeffrey Leach,"[18, 20]","I hope you will forgive me when I tell you I have a crushing headache as I write this review. Why? Because I devoted several hours of this sunny day thinking about not one, but two, of Albert Pyun's films. Pondering the importance of &quot;Ticker&quot; and &quot;Cyborg&quot; to the cinematic world wore me out in ways I would not think possible. Pyun, if you are not familiar with his oeuvre, constructed his B movie credentials by releasing such classics as &quot;The Sword and The Sorcerer,&quot; &quot;Nemesis,&quot; &quot;Mean Guns,&quot; and &quot;Postmortem.&quot; He's a hack's hack in the hack world of zero budget schlock. Not to pound you over the head with it, but watching a Pyun film often resembles in no little way craning your head out the window to see that car accident on the freeway. Initially, you are intrigued by what you might see only to realize later how low you feel as a human being for looking at scenes of abject horror. Ok, I am exaggerating slightly. &quot;Cyborg,&quot; the 1989 film that launched the dubious career of Jean-Claude Van Damme, is one of Pyun's better efforts. In fact, it is one of the few movies in his canon I can watch on a regular basis and not feel too badly about it the next day.Here's another film dealing with life in a post-apocalyptic world. Gibson Rickenbacker (Van Damme) arises from the ruins to play the part of a Good Samaritan. He tries to help survivors of a plague flee from the ruined cities to the countryside, hopefully so they can reconstruct some semblance of a normal life. Rickenbacker, as the hero, of course has an unpleasant memory of one of his missions. He tried to save a family and ended up falling in love with a woman. You don't need me to spell out what happened next. Ever since this unfortunate incident, Gibson struggles with what he should do next. When he runs into a woman named Pearl Prophet (Dale Haddon), a cyborg attempting to carry a cure for the plague back to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, he must decide whether to resume the role of hero. Why not take part in helping Pearl carry the antidote? This mission could turn Rickenbacker into the savior of the world. Unfortunately for Rickenbacker and Pearl, Fender Tremolo (Vincent Klyn), a scary looking dude with weird eyes and a mechanical voice, and his gang of like-minded cyborgs have their own ideas. They think if they can capture Pearl and get her to Atlanta, they will control the future of the world.When Prophet falls into the hands of Tremolo's gang, Rickenbacker decides to get her back. With the help of a mouthy young lady he picks up along the way named Nady Simmons (Deborah Richter), Gibson lurches from one violent confrontation to another. Thugs fall to the ground like leaves as the two pursue Tremolo with malevolent intent. Numerous showdowns in burnt out and broken down buildings provide Pyun and Van Damme with plenty of opportunities to showcase martial arts madness. Kicks, punches, and blunt and sharp instruments-anything you can think of that will cause damage to a human or cyborg body finds a use in this movie. And for the most part Pyun carries off the action well, much better than he has in many of his other movies. You are surprised that you actually root for this guy who speaks English like he just walked off a boat. Before feelings of giddiness carry you away, however, you need to reconcile yourself with a few of the cheesy aspects of the movie. Nearly all of the characters are named after musical instruments, the outfits look like the film crew robbed a New Wave band's wardrobe closet, and the dialogue tends towards the insipid. Still, &quot;Cyborg&quot; entertains as few Pyun films do.&quot;Cyborg&quot; works largely due to the gritty, blasted urban background that the characters move through. It is here, in the ruins of civilization, where most of the action takes place. Moreover, the picture quality of the film (probably as a result of poor film stock) has a dirty look to it, which actually gives the movie a better, more realistic atmosphere. I even thought Pyun tried to inject a philosophical statement in the film (yeah, right) when we see Rickenbacker staked to that ship's mast. Is Gibson a Christ figure &quot;rising&quot; from the grave to help save the world? Maybe, but I'm probably reading more into &quot;Cyborg&quot; than the director intended. Sure, the acting could be better-lots better-and the fight scenes are a little over the top, but why else would you watch this movie? You don't expect Oscar performances and you don't get them. What you do get is an entertaining way to spend eighty plus minutes (the movie doesn't run for even an hour and a half).The DVD version is strictly bare bones. If memory serves me correctly, the only extra on this disc was a trailer. Too bad, but a bit surprising considering this is officially a cult classic. It's interesting to note that none other than Cannon, the company that released TONS of low budget action flicks in the 1980s, helped fund this effort. Charles Bronson benefited from Cannon's attentions back then, so why not Van Damme? I recommend &quot;Cyborg&quot; not only to fans of action films, but even to fans of science fiction since the movie takes a stab at incorporating both elements under one umbrella. Is it intelligent cinema? Nope, but who says it needs to be?",4,One of Pyun's best,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,5361,"['hope', 'will', 'forgive', 'when', 'tell', 'have', 'crushing', 'headache', 'write', 'review', 'Why',

If you like Van Damme, that stuff will sustain you through the film.The postapocalyptic stuff is cartoonish and strained. Everybody, including the hero, is named after musical instruments and sound equipment. Thus the film's central dramatic conflict is between 'Gibson Rickenbacker' and his arch-nemesis 'Fender Tremolo'.But if you can stop snickering at such WWF-quality comedy, you'll find a film that actually succeeds pretty well in spite of its low budget.

Now that I think of it, Van Damme movies generally suck as a rule: only exceptions coming to mind right now are Blood Sport and Kickboxer. Did anyone see ""In Hell""?

The Living Death, quickly closing it's fist over the entire planet. Then we heard the rumors. That the last Scientist's were working on a cure that would end the plague & restore the world. Restore it? Why? I like the death! I like the misery! I like this WORLD!"" That's the opening lines spoken by Vincent Klyn the villain in the criminally underrated 1989 post apocalyptic movie Cyborg. Before I do my review for my 20 years ago series for Cyborg 2 I decided to review the original cause I am a big Jean Claude Van Damme fan & I really like this movie. I like Van Damme's work from the late 80's to the mid 90's he also has put out some really good movies on the direct to video marker  from 01 to 08. I am not a fan of Universal Soldier Regeneration or Day Of Reckoning. I thought Van Damme was in the way in Assassination Games I liked Scott Adkins I thought his story with his wife was fine I think Scott Adkins is an up & coming action star & if Assassination Games just stared him then I think it would have been better. If you don't know this about this movie the sets for Cyborg were intended to be used for Master's Of The Universe 2 & Cannon also had a deal with Marvel to make a Spider Man movie I guess Albert Pyun was going to film them back to back for Cannon Films. But Cannon was in financial trouble so Marvel backed out of the deal & Mattel backed out so Cannon took a shoe string budget & we got Cyborg. BTW how would the sets for Cyborg work for Spider Man although Jean Claude Van Damme would've been a better Peter Parker & Spider Man than Tobey Macguire & Vincent Klyn would've been ahe'  l  l of a lot more intimidating than Thopher Grace. It would've been bad but so bad it's good is more satisfying than Spiderman 3 or any of The Spider Man movies for that matter. I know there is a workprint which is Albert Pyun's Director's Edit. But I won't pay $25 for a workprint Albert Pyun was removed from editing & Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich took over. If I could buy the workprint of Cyborg for a reasonable price yeah I would buy it. Now I'll get to this review the movie was made for $500,000 made $10 million again they didn't $250 million like The Lone Ranger did. $500,000 & it looks like it was made for more. Directed by Albert Pyun he directed the 1990 Captain America which I thought that was actually pretty good. He also directed Kickboxer 2 which I didn't care for & Nemesis & all it's sequels. This is probably his best movie. The movie stars Jean Claude Van Damme as Gibson, Vincent Klyn as Fender, Dayle Haddon as Pearl Prophet, Deborah Richter as Nady, Haley Peterson as Haley. The story is this cyborg named Pearl Prophet she has the formula to cure The Plague she has this body guard with they're being chased by this real intimidating SOB named Fender along with his Pirates. Pearl's Bodyguard is outnumbered by them basically Fender wants Pearl cause she has the formula to cure The Plague & with that he could have a lot of power over the world. The Bodyguard is killed then you're introduced to Gibson who is after Fender & his Pirates where he runs into Pearl she tells him to that she needs to get to Atlanta she shows him that she is a Cyborg. Fender & his group show up & shoot at Gibson he makes it look like they got him. Fender tells Pearl that he will take her to Atlanta & she will give the cure to The Plague or he will give her a horror show Fender holds up the head of her Bodyguard. Which it is a good practical effect as well as for The Cyborg movement for The Pearl character. Then you have this scene where Fender & his Pirates are ravaging this village to get a ship & they're just killing these poor people cutting heads off. 1 thing I have to say is you know how fans of Universal Soldier Regeneration say it's no holds barred take no prisoners & it's dark & it's gritty to me this scene is more powerful than anything in USR. You have Fender bothering this brother & sister I think anyway they looked young he takes this girl slits her throat then snaps her neck then he takes this big wooden staff & rams it right through that boys mouth. You have Gibson on Fender's trail this young woman named Nady tries to jump Gibson but she is knocked out then you have some flashbacks about Gibson that helps make this a strong movie imo where Gibson is protecting this family & he becomes close to the family & gives up his life as a Slinger. Nady awakes she tells him that she thought he was a Pirate she wants to get Pearl to Atlanta to get the cure. Gibson & Nady form a bond since he wants to go after Fender & she wants to get the cure to The Plague. They encounter some bandits later on Gibson goes into the woods takes these guys down. Nady finds her way into this dilapidated building where these bandits go after her Gibson goes into the building he shoots this 1 guy fights this other guy off who has chain a blade pops out of Gibson's boot he does a spin kick & cut that guys neck open. These fights are really good done in wideshots with no shakey cam. This big guy holding Nady Gibson throws a knife at the big guy while he has her on the ground Nady goes & knocks him off the building. Skipping ahead Gibson knows Fender will come through the area you also find out how Pearl came to be. You have this great action scene Gibson encounters Fender's gang in an abandoned building you have this Pirate charge at Gibson with a machete & knife there is this great scene where Gibson is hanging on these pipes & this Pirate is going to throw a knife at Gibson's head Gibson is trying to break the pipes trying to survive again to me these fights are gritty. When he swings from the pipes he encounters some more Pirates & some dudes dressed as ninja's he guns them down Fender has knocked out Nady & Gibson is trying to go after Fender but is dealing with all these Pirates Gibson is shot in the shoulder by Fender 1 of The Pirates looks familiar this young lady named Haley I'll get to that. Gibson leads them on a chase he finds the unconscious Nady being guarding by these 2 Pirates Pearl is there & he tells her to come with him but she tells him no she'll get to Atlanta & lead Fender into a trap. Gibson goes through the sewers carrying the unconscious Nady where he is being chased by that crazy Pirate & you have The Pirate look up where he sees Gibson above him Van Damme is doing the splits to hold himself in place which yes I saw the new Volvo commercial which is hilarious I thought it was better than Universal Soldier Regeneration & A Day Of Reckoning. Anyway he kills that Pirate. He gets to the surface where Nady comes to they're chased by Fender's Gang in this Salt Marsh Gibson fights this Pirate with a metal staff. Then you have this crazy chick try to fight Nady & Deborah Richter isn't a good fighter but she does an ok job holding her own against she cuts that crazy lady's hand off & then kills her. Just as Gibson is done with The Pirate with the staff another 1 shows up just as he gets the upperhand he's outnumbered he tries his best to fend them off. Fender shows up beats Gibson up badly he has him tied to a cross. That Haley character shows concern for Gibson. Then we get a flashback why Gibson became a Slinger again the family he was with was killed by Fender he had Gibson this woman & her little brother tied up with barbed wire & is going to drown them in a well. but he has this little girl named Haley who was that woman's little sister Fender has her hold the end Fender tells her ""It's up to you, honey. If you can hold on they'll live."" Which is a creepy scene how Vincent Klyn says it especially his eyes. I don't know if they're real or not but they help with this character. BTW if you don't know Vincent Klyn is a surfer which I don't see a surfer when I look at Vincent Klyn I don't know what happened to him but I would rather have him be the villain in Expendables 3 than Mel Gibson. Anyway you have Van Damme trying to break free from the cross which he does a great job in that scene. I am not saying that this movie is oscar worthy but you feel sorry for Haley cause Fender made her kill her family. Plus I am rooting for Van Damme cause I feel his rage when he's struggling to break free from the cross. You know the backstory helps me like this movie more & more. Nady finds Gibson which I wish her reaction was more serious instead of I told you that you needed my help. Anyway you get to the finish in Atlanta where Gibson kills the remaining Pirates Nady protects Pearl where again Deborah Richter fights them off to the best of her ability. Gibson finishes off the last Pirate he kicks the guy into a open fire he then kicks him into this barrel with gas or something in it where you get a nice explosion. Then you have this down & dirty fight with Van Damme & Vincent Klyn. Van Damme is thrown into a car Fender bash's Gibson head with a car door. Haley begs for Fender to stop which I do have my theories on what Fender did to Haley since he kidnapped her when she was little. I know someone will say this is a dumb action movie & I am reading too much into it but people read too much into Rob Zombie's Halloween II. Anyway Gibson kicks through the car door window & kicks Fender in the back. Nady comes out she is killed by Fender & Van Damme P O ed gets out of the car & yells ""FENDER!"" Fender yells""FV  ***R!"" They just go at it I like when Van Damme thinks he's killed Fender. after he stabbed him in the chest only to get back up the fight continues & into a barn where Van Damme roundhouses Fender into a hook killing him. This was a good fight scene not on the level of Van Damme & Lundgren in the 1st Universal Soldier but I could watch this over the fight in Van Damme & Lundgren had in USR. He gets Pearl to The Doctor. Pearl asks Gibson & Haley to stay but he tells her that they need us out there. Pearl says she thinks that Gibson is the real cure for this world. Final thoughts are you have a movie that looks like it was made on a bigger budget than $500,000. You had a really good villain that's up there with Dolph Lundgren from the 1st Universal Soldier, Ron Silver from Timecop & Michel Qussi from Kickboxer. Very good to great action scenes characters you care about along with a backstory for the main character that works in favor for the movie. Albert Pyun did a really good job directing. Jean Claude Van Damme was great. Vincent Klyn didn't say much it worked he was intimidating & sometimes that's all you need for a really good villain. Deborah Richter was good. Dayle Haddon was good. Haley Peterson was good. If you want to see this movie The DVD is cheap. There's even a Blu Ray of Cyborg which I might get. If you know where I can workprint leave me a comment.

136559,A2E1QTFS01GT4P,0792835735,"J. Urban ""U2fan4ever76""","[5, 6]","Funny how people write and say how aweful this movie is--they apparently aren't fans. This movie is exactly what a fan would expect to seen--lots and lots of martial arts and fighting. Think of this movie as a post-apocalyptic Bloodsport. This movie is a pure '80's cult movie. If you are looking for Oscar caliber acting and screenwriting, you are looking in the wrong place--Van Damme movies have never been intended for that and never will be.Plot - CA very overused post-apocalyptic plot is used where most of society is dying (or is already dead) from a plague and those that aren't dying are either searching for a cure or have resorted to barbarian-like creatures who rape and pillage every little town or city they come to. Enter Van Damme. He plays Gibson who is a freelance mercenary type who is payed to escort people through the city. He encounters the Flesh Pirates who are lead by a menacing leader named Fender. The cure to the plague has been placed into a cyborg (hence the name) and through a chance encounter, Gibson must escort her to Atlanta (which is apparently the headquarters of humanity--at least for the U.S.). Along the way, Gibson meets a female mercenary and they have a brief interlude. She claims to be a able to help Gibson, but really interfers with his progress (the typical damsel in distress). As he jouneys with the Cyborg, he has flashbacks of the life he used to lead before his life was shattered by a tragedy. With the Flesh Pirates after the cyborg (because apparently they don't want humanity cured) and Van Damme protecting her, it is a constant struggle to get the cyborg to Atlanta.Van Damme is actually very convincing as the reluctant hero. He has hardly any dialogue in the movie, yet is able to express a range of emotions through expressions and actions (something very good for someone who is always being accused of having no acting ability). The fights are very well choreographed and all of the martial arts you would expect can be found in the movie. Perhaps the best fight is at the end in the rain with Gibson versus Fender. This is pure '80's Van Damme.Acting - CVan Damme is surprisingly good as Gibson. Though virtually no dialogue, his actions seem to mean more anyways. As for the rest of the cast, I can't say much. Most of it is either very underplayed or overplayed--no happy medium. But if you wanted a drama you wouldn't be watching this movie anyways, right?Music/Soundtrack - BIt is basically techno-like music, but interestingly enough, it works quite well in this movie and embarrassingly I have to admit to owning the soundtrack.Cinematography - CVery bleak and apocalyptic. There are lots of deserted locales and marshes and warehouses (filmed in Wilmington, NC--as a NC resident, I can tell you that NC does not look anything like that for the most part). The lighting and camera work for the last fight is very good (it is night time and raining).DVD - CNo real extras. It has the original trailer and some bio information.

It is a showcase for Van Damme's considerable Martial Arts talent. It shows a world totally devoid of the concept of mercy. Since no one in this film can act their way out of a paper bag, the lack of dialog doesn't hurt it either.Back before his run-in with Cocaine, Van Damme was trying to tap into the Martial Arts film genre as Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris did. He almost succeeded, were it not for the Coke. Since then, he has been seen in a number of films that only die-hard Martial Arts fans would know, or care about. The last film I saw him in that had very little to nothing of Martial Arts in it was ""Legionaire"".""Cyborg"" is a tale set in the somewhat near future, where a plague has decimated the Earth's population down to a few scattered camps of humanity. Albert Pyun inserted a bit of unorthodoxy, in the form of character names. Van Damme's moniker is Gibson Rickenbacker, and his nemesis goes by the moniker of Fender Stratocaster, played by Vince Klyn, who's only claim to fame is this film.A cure has been found by a group of Scientists in an underground bunker. It is worthless, however, unless they can get it to another lab located in Atlanta, Georgia. A woman (Dayle Haddon) who, by all intents and purposes, is another Scientist, volunteers to undergo a transformation to turn her into a ""Cyborg"", hence, the title of the film. Presumably this is done so she cannot contract the plague, and possibly die before reaching Atlanta.Gibson Rickenbacker is a loner with a dark past. He plays a ""Slinger"", or hifalutin' future-talk for mercenary. He meets ""Pearl"" (the Cyborg), while fighting off ""Flesh Pirates"" (catchy, huh?). She tells Gibson of her plan to go to Atlanta, but Fender has other ideas. He is the BMOC of the ""Flesh Pirates"", and He's not diggin' that Gibson or Pearl wants to save the world, so he goes to Atlanta to destroy the cure, and the Scientists with it.During this period in Hollywood, there was a small contingent of filmmakers who contracted Custom Knifemakers to create some of the most beautiful knives ever seen in film (these were not dime-store specials, but real custom collector pieces). The film ""First Blood"" started the craze with ""Survival Knives"", and the trend just took off. You still continue to see them, they're just not the center of attention as they were before.

136570,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0792835735,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","""Cyborg"" is an entry into Jean-Claude Van Damme's filmography that could not be made a second time. Only the second starring role in Van Damme's career, it was likely only during this desperate part of his Hollywood life that he would have willingly submitted himself to the creative whims of infamous director Albert Pyun. However, in all fairness, this is definitely one of the best features Pyun would ever make, and if nothing else, it's fun seeing the Muscles from Brussels in something as trashy and creatively reckless like this. This isn't one of Van Damme's more lauded pictures, but fans who can find beauty in imperfections ought to be entertained by this.The story: in a dystopian future, a mercenary for hire (Van Damme,Bloodsport) tracks down a ruthless pirate leader (Vincent Klyn,Point Break) attempting to destroy the last hope for humanity.I like to compare ""Cyborg"" here to the stylistically similarNemesis, another action vehicle Pyun directed some three years later. While the latter had better action content and had more fun with the concept of artificial humans, ""Cyborg"" is infinitely better made with stronger production values. Indeed, whereas most of ol' Albert's movies look like they've been shot on abandoned property or out in the wilderness, ""Cyborg"" benefits from sets that had famously been prepared for ""He-Man"" and ""Spider-Man"" films which were never produced. There's a good deal of color to the world, despite its post-apocalyptic state, so it's rarely dull to look at like a lot of the director's stuff. The acting really isn't great, particularly Vincent Klyn's, but there are a couple examples of effective silent acting between Van Damme and Deborah Richter (Promised Land).Again in comparison to ""Nemesis"", ""Cyborg"" has less action but that doesn't mean it's an insufficient amount. Additionally, the fight scenes are nicely varied: karate, knife-fighting, shootouts, and a couple explosions make for a well-rounded spectacle. All of the hand-to-hand scenes could definitely have been shot better and Van Damme is in definite need of more opponents to fight one-on-one, but the choreography is occasionally inventive, like when he performs a jumping reverse roundhouse to slice open a thug's neck with a nail protruding from his boot. Speaking of the need for more one-on-one villains, I was disappointed by how all of the creative-looking henchmen are automatically relegated to bit status: they include Ralf Moeller (Gladiator) and Stefanos Miltsakakis (Maximum Risk) among other weirdoes, but they're all virtual nobodies and crumble before Van Damme's kicks.I wish there could have been more of that cheesy, retro stop-motion you see early in the film and less slow motion, but with Pyun you can't ask for everything.

Here we have JCVD in top-shape as a Slinger, helping people out of the plague ridden cities. And we follow him in a post-apocalyptic east coast USA to Atlanda with a Cyborg that must reach CDC with a cure. And we of course has someone who needs that cure more to ""become god!"" the real life surfer Vincent Klyn as Fender (yes all characters are named after guitars and stuff) his lines are few but funny, mostly his narration in the beginning explaining the current state of the world...""restore this world? why?!

But besides that we see more details of the world of Cyborg, runned down streets, factories, plague-ridden camps and boats that still run (on coal?) This is what i liked most of the Bluray, its sharp picture quality. I made out several new interesting things beacause of this.The sound quality of the Bluray version is a DTS-HD MA 2.0 track, wich is fine if you have a never reciever you can actually get pretty decent surround out of this track.

136575,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0792835735,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","Cyborg,released April/89,was his second film after the groundbreaking film Bloodsport,released a year earlier.It's a futuristic potboiler and Van Damme's character of an intense,gunslinger for hire,shows alot of depth and is much more than just a one dimensional figure.Directed by the eclectic Albert Pyun,the movie at times has a ""The Good,The Bad and the Ugly"" feel to it,while the sound effects(punches especially)sound like they're straight out of a 70s Hong Kong movie.The story involves one Gibson Rickenbacker(Van Damme)who is called a ""slinger"",someone who basically is protection for hire,in this post apocalyptic world.The reigning band of no good-nicks is head by Fender Tremelo(Vincent Klyn)who wants this warped world to stay like it is so he can reign supreme.However an underground group implants a cyborg(Dayle Haddon)with the formula for a cure to the plague that stains the land,and she heads to Atlanta where a like-group of individuals is awaiting her arrival to perfect the cure.When the cyborg's protection is taken out Gibson agrees to take her to Atlanta.Fender and his gang are not far behind though and they capture the cyborg and take her to Atlanta themselves so they can control the cure and thus become demi-gods of sorts.Gibson recovers from his clash with Fender and meets up with another young lady named Nady(Deborah Richter)who implores him to follow the cyborg to Atlanta and to protect her.Off they go but Gibson has other thoughts than just protection on his mind.It seems that Gibson at one point some years earlier had had a family of his own.It had started out as just a slinger protection job of a mom and two children.However once Gibson had gotten them out of the city and to a seemingly safe area,they fell in love and it looked like Gibson was giving up slinging and settling down.However enter Fender and his boys and girls and they tied Gibson,the mom and one child up with barbed wire,and dangled them in a well.The mom's other child stood by the well with the gang where she was given the end of the barbed wire to hold onto.She tried to hold them up but the weight was too much and the three plunged into the well.The child and mom perished while Gibson barely made it out alive.Fender took the remaining child with him.With vengeance burning in his heart Gibson and Nady are hot on Fender's trail.Gibson catches up to Fender in an old abandoned factory where Nady is captured and injured.Gibson is forced to confront the gang but the odds are against him and he is forced to flee,carrying Nady.Gibson goes underground through a sewer and comes out into an open swampy area.Nady eventually comes to but Gibson cannot fight the onslaught of Fender's numerous gang members.He is captured,beaten and is crucified(nailed to a cross-actually a plank across a mast of a ship).Fender continues to Atlanta but Gibson,while down is not out.Still surviving until the next morning the continuous pelting of bad memories of the family he lost give him reason to live.He is able to topple the mast and Nady reappears to help him out the rest of the way.Gibson and Fender,in a rainy night in Georgia,have their final showdown.It's High Noon but at night and it is one spectacular fight scene.Fender dominates most of the fight until finally Gibson gets the upper hand and stabs him.It is now revealed that one of the young girls with Fender is none other than the daughter who survived the death of her mother and sister in that well years before.They hug but Fender suddenly arises again to wreak more havoc.Gibson with all his remaining strength sends Fender airborne with a flying kick which propels him backwards and onto a hook.While Gibson is reunited with the girl he hadn't seen for years,they both mourn the loss of Nady who died trying to intervene with Fender.Gibson escorts the cyborg to the labs where he is asked to join them.He refuses and off he and his new charge go to new adventures.Director Pyun like visuals in his films and this one is no different.His placement of his actors is very important to convey a strong sense of menace and evil.The only person who knows of Gibson's past is Gibson himself and reminds one very much of the Man with no Name.Pyun is well known to be an admirer of Sergio Leone.And of course there are Pyun's symbolic touches(no holds barred or apologies) as in the scene of Gibson crucified.Like Christ himself you know Gibson will arise again to cleanse the sins of the world;in the form of Fender.Pyun also makes great use of lighting and its contrasts.Watch for the scene in the sewer where Gibson flees through.There is a beautifully framed shot of Van Damme with legs spread horizontally between two concrete abutments above the sewer bottom;this predates by four years his famous ""splits"" on the kitchen counter in Time Cop.With subtle lighting above Van Damme his pursuer unknowingly passes right underneath him and he dispatches the bad guy in an instant.The plot may be thin at times but Pyun's direction,the editing and the bigger-than-life nature of the characters carries the film to a satisfactory conclusion.I found myself yelling out loud at Van Damme during the finale as if I was at a live event.Not something I do too often.Technically the film has been transferred well and is in a 1:85:1 a/r,along with a fullscreen version. This is a one sided DVD and comes in a thick keepcase.Other than the theatrical trailer there are no special features at all.As Van Damme films go this one(one of his earlier efforts with his star on the rise)is a good one which his fans especially will enjoy.You will notice the names of the good and bad guy are those of brands of guitars,but they could have been called Mickey and Minny for all that it mattered;the names are an identification mark and nothing more.The director makes the characters larger than life and it is they,rather than the plot,that really carry the picture.Pyun utilizes many interesting influences here not the least of which are the Hong Kong quickies and the westerns influence of the Man with No Name films.Recommended.",4,3 1/2 -4 stars for this Van Damme

Well the answer for us is quite simple, Cyborg on DVD is the gift that keeps on giving all year round especially for the office Secret Santa. That woman that seems to call out every week, boom CYBORG for you. What about the annoying guy that stands way too close to you when he talks, bam CYBORG. It's even perfect for the manager that gets paid 4 times the amount you do yet only works like 28 hours a week, we say BAM Cyborg for you! As you can tell the brothers Sid were quite moved by the film in such a way we'd risk being viewed as complete mental patients by our co-workers.Hey at least if they hate the gift they'll think you're so strange you'll never be invited to one of their stupid personal functions.Just a year away from the glorious B decade of the 90's the film Cyborg made it's first appearance with a budget of a simple 500k. Our estimate is the budget was blow through the first half with some top rate explosions and springboards. Oh yeah who doesn't love that? Van Damme plays post apocalyptic street tough Gibson Rickenbacker (guess someone likes the Beatles) as he eeks his way through a life infested with maniacs. Somehow he comes across a cyborg woman, saves her life, then has to save her again from a group of pirates led by that guy Warchild from Point Break. Gibson aka I'm Adam Gibson is bent on revenge from years back when Warchild killed his family. As we all know once you tick off Van Damme no amount of guns, grenades, or manpower can stop the beat down you'll be sure to receive.Cyborgs, pirates, early Van Damme??? With all that packed into one low budget B fest how could it possibly earn anything under a five star rating. Also the fact that it was on like 11:00 pm on an action movie channel added quite a bit of sentimental value from our mid 90's childhood days. That's something that just can't be topped. It would easily be one of those films we'd watch in search of some nudity only to be left with non stop laughter from horrid acting and even worse action.

One thing I like about the movie is the ruthless Fender.  It was kind of messed up when those people were getting married and Fender  and his maruaders killed the newly weds with no intention of giving them  mercy however, I think that was an interesting part because it emphasized  the fact that Fender is RUTHLESS. This is one of the only movies I have  ever seen where the main villian is truely careless about the lives of his  foes. Excellent! The only thing I wish was different was Van Damme's  fighting style in movies. In the past, I thought they were great but, that  was before I started seeing martial arts movies with faster and more active  fight scenes. Still, it's pretty cool that they sometimes put some moves in  slow motion. Overall, this was a great movie with a good enough storyline.

136579,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,0792835735,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[8, 9]","Post apocalyptic movies always tend to be a mixed bag for several reasons. Since you can build the sets on a low budget it seems just about everyone has tried to make a movie set in a wasteland, and end up making a weak film. So here's another post apocalyptic film. Now this one seems to have a look and feel that's a cut above most of them, however it ends up having not much more to offer. It has the good stuff technically, but the script is rather basic, the characters are two dimensional, and there just isn't enough to truly stand out as one of the great wasteland movies.The premise is interesting enough and it does get the movie started on the right direction. The problem is it doesn't really get any deeper than what you find out in the first 20 minutes or so. All the movie does is have Rickenbacker (Van Damme) run around chasing after the bad guys, getting into fights with them repeatedly. Sure they try to put an emotional slant with Rickenbacker's past and how it ties together with what's going on, and yes it does offer some depth to the story. But ultimately it doesn't do much to really be considered a strong back story. Even more disappointing is the fact the cyborg the movie is named after hardly does a thing at all besides being the hostage everybody wants. Kind of misleading if you ask me.What gives Cyborg its graces are two things: some of the directing and some of the fight scenes. Jean Claude Van Damme is of course known for his martial arts movies so of course you get some pretty impressive fight scenes. Though none of it would be considered a strong caliber of choreography you still get some decent action. I will give director Albert Pyun some credit for taking what he had and giving it a polished look. Cinematography, camera angles, lighting, they all definitely set Cyborg apart from your standard B-movie type post apocalypse movie and kick it up to A-caliber status on production values alone. Unfortunately the rest of the movie wasn't as well done.The acting is serviceable and works well enough, but isn't anything to write home about. The main bad guy looks really awesome and intimidating. I was hoping he was a cyborg too just because of the fact he looked so cool and was so amoral. The problem is the character doesn't go anywhere aside from wanting everybody to suffer. This sort of limited character depth hurts the movie's virtues. If they did more with these characters other than have them fight all the time there could have been a better movie coming out of this.This new Blu-Ray release does sport the best visual quality I have seen for this movie, but don't expect a crystal clear an perfect picture. You don't get the really deep blacks that you see in more recent releases. I don't know if that's because of the nature of the cinmatography at the time or if not enough effort was spent on the remastering. Still this is as clear a picture as I have ever seen for this movie. The apect ratio is 1.85:1, and I hear you may or may not get the black bars depending on your set up. It's one of those disks that, for lack of a better term, I call semi-animorphic (looked fine on my 52""). The best I can say for the audio is that it's clean, and that's worth something. You have a 2 channel stereo 24 bit DTS-HD master track, which is the best sound you will ever get. I'm glad they didn't try to convert the audio into 5.1 surround and stuck with the original audio channels. That's the English track, but there is also a monophonic dolby digital track in French (subtitles in English and Spanish).Martial arts fans might like this movie as long as they expect merely good fight scenes and not great ones. Van Damme fans will definitely like this one as he does get a chance to play a character different than any other he has done before or since. If you like post apocalyptic movies I supposed it's 50/50 for you. The wasteland concept is there and they establish it, but it doesn't fill you with that atmosphere like The Road Warrior or The Postman. To be honest this is a 50/50 shot for most of you. It really depends on what how good you want a movie before you turn away.

The film takes place in a future United States that has been decimated by a plague and internal violence. The film begins in New York City. A female cyborg named Pearl Prophet (Dale Haddon) has retrieved information stored within her memory that when brought back to Atlanta (former headquarters of Centers for Disease Control) should bring about a cure for the plague that has killed and is killing so many others. Unfortunately, Pearl runs into a group of pirates led by Fender Tremolo (Vincent Kyln) a big and ugly villain who grunts a lot and who has scary-looking eyes. While running away from Fender, Pearl runs into Gibson Rickenbacker (Van Damme). Gibson is a wandering do-gooder who has spent the last several years of his life training for the day when he would meet Fender again and get his revenge for killing his loved ones. In their first encounter, Gibson is left for dead. Of course, he's not dead but is just unconscious under a pile of rubble. After crawling his way out, Gibson follows the path of Fender, determined to save Pearl and get his revenge. Also, while following Fender's path, Gibson rescues a young woman named Nady Simmons (Deborah Richter). Gibson eventually meets up with Fender again and battle and mayhem ensue.CYBORG was directed by Albert Pyun. Pyun has gained a reputation as being a modern Ed Wood. He's directed over forty movies, usually on a shoestring, and will probably be forever infamously known as the man who directed the CAPTAIN AMERICA movie that was never released in U.S. theatres. There are some people who are huge Pyun fans. If you know what you are getting into and are in the right mindset, then a Pyun film can be bearable to watch. But there's a reason besides the huge amount of projects and cheap budgets that Pyun is compared to Ed Wood. His movies have terribly written scripts with bad dialogue and nonsensical plots, usually full of holes. His films usually also have a huge amount of violence. CYBORG has all of those elements as well as a cast of characters named after guitars and other musical instruments.There's only one reason that I watched CYBORG. Several years ago while flipping through the channels late at night I came across the most memorable scene in the movie. I won't give that scene away, but I was so mesmerized by what I saw that I decided to rent the movie and watch the whole thing. The rest of the movie pales in comparison to that scene, but the scene is worth watching.CYBORG isn't a good movie. It's a bad movie, but not quite bad enough to be campy. If you enjoy fighting movies and can get past the weak plot, cheesy costumes, musical instrument-named characters, and terrible dialogue, then you might enjoy CYBORG.
