1549433,A32U6577WUD9L5,B008B49EGS,"Donald James. Parker ""Author""","[9, 9]","This is not your typical three act drama. If you're lost without the concept of a setup, turning points, heightened tension and suspense, and a climax, then you'll probably not like this movie. This story is a journey, reminiscent of Cheaper by the Dozen, documenting the story of a man's life as told by his daughter. It's a roller coaster ride of family moments intermingled with entertaining vignettes of song, mostly provided by the father, but occasionally by the other members of this extraordinary family.The cast was outstanding in this film. The kids (nine of them) were delightful. The father, played ably by Jarin Stevens in his only IMDB movie credit, reveals an eclectic mixture of a tough disciplinarian like Captain Von Trapp and a quixotic, musical, fun loving dreamer. The mother, portrayed admirably by Jennica Schwartzman, brought a character to the screen that possessed all of the attributes of the perfect wife. She touched my heartstrings, as I'm guessing her male counterpart does to the female viewers.This was not a blatantly Christian film. There were not a lot of references to God but the aura of faith surrounded the story. It is definitely a keeper in my estimation, a peek into the family as God intended it to be. I wish I'd have seen this movie when my kids were infants.",5,The Measure of a Movie,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,1305,"['not', 'typical', 'three', 'act', 'drama', ""'re"", 'lost', 'concept', 'setup', 'turning', 'points', 'heightened', 'tension', 'suspense', 'climax', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'story', 'journey', 'reminiscent', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'documenting', 'story', 'man', 'life', 'told', 'daughter', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'family', 'moments', 'intermingled', 'entertaining', 'vignettes', 'song', 'mostly', 'provided', 'father', 'occasionally', 'other', 'members', 'extraordinary', 'family.The', 'cast', 'was', 'outstanding', 'film', 'kids', 'nine', 'were', 'delightful', 'father', 'played', 'ably', 'Jarin', 'Stevens', 'only', 'IMDB', 'movie', 'credit', 'eclectic', 'mixture', 'tough', 'disciplinarian', 'Captain', 'Von', 'Trapp', 'quixotic', 'musical', 'fun', 'loving', 'dreamer', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'admirably', 'Jennica', 'Schwartzman', 'brought', 'character', 'screen', 'possessed', 'attributes', 'perfect', 'wife', 'touched', 'heartstrings', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'male', 'counterpart', 'female', 'viewers.This', 'was', 'not', 'blatantly', 'Christian', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'lot', 'references', 'God', 'aura', 'faith', 'surrounded', 'story', 'definitely', 'keeper', 'estimation', 'peek', 'family', 'God', 'intended', 'be', 'wish', ""'d"", 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'when', 'kids', 'were', 'infants']",N/A
