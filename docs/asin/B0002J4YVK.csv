836805,A8SCX6VUTE05H,B0002J4YVK,,"[3, 4]","Okay, Im not an easily offended person with a vendetta against this  movie but it stinks. Look, I like comedies even when they are offensive but Soul Plane is offensive without being funny. Its like some dateless jerk that that drinks heavily and believes everything he says in his drunken stupor is endlessly amusing. You know that type of guy. He thinks his boorishness makes him funny and not some gasbag that needs to shut it before he gets knocked out.The story details Nashawn(played by Kevin Hart)that sues an airplane company after an unfortunate accident kills his dog. He gets an idea from his cousin to open his own airline and he acts up on it. He hires and inexperienced pilot with a fear heights to fly the plane and hijinks ensue.I only chuckled one: the stupid scene where Sommore thought that Snoop was whacking off to her getting funnylinguis. Every other joke fails miserably because the screenwriters think that being offensive equates with humor. No. Offensive humor works when its well-timed. For instance in Borat, where Borat gets kicked out of a hotel for walking with his pants sagging while speaking urban slang was hilarious as it was offensive. Snoop telling Godfrey to turn off that African mumbo-jumbo is offensive,ignorant and is also far from funny. The screenwriters of this rubbish have no comic talent because they believe that all it takes to be funny is to be boorish as possible. No, you have to time in it a situation or in the form a joke for it to work. This movie has a real mean streak and really glories in its unabashed crudeness. Dont support this mintrel show or you'll only encourage untalented hacks to continue to be all the hack they can be. As a matter of fact you reviewers that praise this movie are responsible for the onslaught of Seltzer and Freidberg so we have no one else to thank but you for the the undeserved success of the worst filmmakers to disgrace Hollywood. Thank you very much for nothing.

Basically, the movie is about a regular guy, Dakwon (Kevin Hart), who gets injured on an airplane; then he sues and wins a big cash settlement, and he decided to start his own airline, NWA Airlines, with the money.Like I said in the title, there ARE some funny moments in here, like when Snoop Dogg, who plays the pilot, says he's afraid of heights. But the movie starts to get really crazy when you see what's going on in different parts of the plane. Not that the craziness isn't funny, but it's like this: in one wing you see passengers riding in the seats; then in another wing you see a bar; then in ANOTHER wing there's a strip club; and in STILL another wing there's a casino, and I'm like, ""How big IS this plane?""As far as the cast goes, I have no idea how Tom Arnold got in this movie. And the idea of his wife, son and daughter catching ""jungle fever"" (the son discovering hip-hop music and style; the wife and daughter picking up black men) is kind of played out -- especially since the way in which each of these things happen is semi-funny rather than COMPLETELY funny. And Method Man's acting performance in this movie was about as interesting as his performance in Belly.Speaking of Belly, this seems like another instance where a hip-hop video director tried to make a movie look like a lengthened version of one of his/her videos (it was directed by Jessy Terrero). That probably explains all the cameos, like D.L. Hughley as the bathroom attendant and John Witherspoon (what would a Black movie be without him?) as the blind man.

But I don't want to get all deep and analytical. This movie's primary purpose is to be a comedy and boy, does it serve its purpose well.

836822,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0002J4YVK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","Sure, it's lewd, crude, and basically ridiculous, but Soul Plane is also a very funny movie, and that is what really matters.  Certainly, it could be better - it starts out with an actual plot, but that pretty much falls to the way side once Flight 69 is airborne on its maiden flight, and the film doesn't end so much as it just stops playing.  It's also full of clich&eacute;s and toilet humor, and those without a sense of humor when it comes to this sort of thing will probably deride the racial stereotypes put in play here.It's a pretty simple story idea.  Nashawn (Kevin Hart) turns a toilet-related in-flight mishap (along with the horrible death of his dog) into a lawsuit-garnered one hundred million dollar windfall.  Having seen firsthand how an airplane passenger should not be treated, he decides to take his money and start his own airline - and thus NWA Airlines, the first all-black airline, is born.  The radical transformation begins in the terminal, but the pink hip-hop plane with its bootylicious flight attendants, drastically different passenger compartments, onboard bar and dance floor, and overall atmosphere is unbelievably over-the-top.  Then you throw in Snoop Dogg as the plane's captain and inject a white family headed by Tom Arnold into the mix, and you've got one crazy movie.  A few things don't work very well, especially the white boy who instantly transforms into a hip-hop video director and, to some degree, the incredibly gay male flight attendant, but most of the jokes, no matter how crude or obscenity-laced, are quite funny.  The two female security guards deserve special recognition for their hilarious efforts.Most people should already know whether or not they are likely to enjoy Soul Plane before watching it; making Airplane look like lofty, sophisticated humor, this film seemingly takes great joy in seeing just how low and far it can push the envelope of humor.  If you think every film should have a point other than simple entertainment, you should not book a flight on the Soul Plane.",4,A one-way trip to crude hilarity,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,2043,"['Sure', 'lewd', 'crude', 'basically', 'ridiculous', 'Soul', 'Plane', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'Certainly', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'out', 'actual', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'side', 'once', 'Flight', '69', 'airborne', 'maiden', 'flight', 'film', ""n't"", 'end', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'playing', 'also', 'full', 'clich', 'eacute', 'toilet', 'humor', 'sense', 'humor', 'when', 'sort', 'thing', 'will', 'probably', 'deride', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'put', 'play', 'here.It', 'pretty', 'simple', 'story', 'idea', 'Nashawn', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'toilet-related', 'in-flight', 'mishap', 'horrible', 'death', 'dog', 'lawsuit-garnered', 'one', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollar', 'windfall', 'Having', 'seen', 'firsthand', 'how', 'airplane', 'passenger', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'treated', 'take', 'money', 'start', 'own', 'airline', 'thus', 'NWA', 'Airlines', 'first', 'all-black', 'airline', 'born', 'radical', 'transformation', 'terminal', 'pink', 'hip-hop', 'plane', 'bootylicious', 'flight', 'attendants', 'drastically', 'different', 'passenger', 'compartments', 'onboard', 'bar', 'dance', 'floor', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'unbelievably', 'over-the-top', 'Then', 'throw', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'plane', 'captain', 'inject', 'white', 'family', 'headed', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'mix', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'crazy', 'movie', 'few', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'white', 'boy', 'who', 'instantly', 'hip-hop', 'video', 'director', 'degree', 'incredibly', 'gay', 'male', 'flight', 'attendant', 'most', 'jokes', 'matter', 'how', 'crude', 'obscenity-laced', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'two', 'female', 'security', 'guards', 'deserve', 'special', 'recognition', 'hilarious', 'efforts.Most', 'people', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'not', 'are', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'Soul', 'Plane', 'watching', 'making', 'Airplane', 'look', 'lofty', 'sophisticated', 'humor', 'film', 'seemingly', 'great', 'joy', 'seeing', 'just', 'how', 'low', 'far', 'can', 'push', 'envelope', 'humor', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'point', 'other', 'simple', 'entertainment', 'should', 'not', 'book', 'flight', 'Soul', 'Plane']",N/A

Terrero may use the excuse that he's simply refusing to be politically correct.  This line of reasoning, though, is merely a pathetic attempt at rationalization.  Soul Plane is a story about a young black man who wins a hundred million dollars in a lawsuit and decides to start his own airline.  We observe a flight where everything that could go wrong does indeed do so.  The characters are dumb and obscene.  No one appears to possess an IQ over the level of moron.

836825,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0002J4YVK,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 4]","Just by the beginning of the film did it bother me.  It had Kevin Hart's character, an 'entrepreneur', going on a plane filled with ineptitude, prejudice people.  He had a dog with him, which he should've caged in the first place, but it was poorly handled by the crewmen, and while on flight, the turbulence and stewardess goof-offs had the caged dog flown out of the baggage hatch and into a crappy green-screen effect; from there, the dog got sucked into a jet engine.  He took this to court, and he won the airplane misconduct case for $100,000,000; okay, I don't know how much you actual receive in these airplane-related settlements, but it sure isn't a hundred mil.  But that entire bit is just a simple contrivance, it's only when the guy invested in his own airline service has ""Soul Plane"" gone terribly, horribly, no good, very badly messed up.It's easy to describe the many negative constructs about this urban flight of comedy (gross, idiotic, offensive), but there's something about the actual soul plane itself that's begging to be deconstructed.  By the simple concept of design and functionality, this plane is unethical, not to mention illogical; they way it works broke all the rules of safety and conduct.  It has an hydraulic suspension system, which is impractical to use since it won't work on a large vehicle, and even if does work, the landing gears would've been destroyed; not even the shock absorbers can handle the sudden shift in pressure and gravity once the plane's lifted from the ground.  Interior-wise, it has dance clubs, casinos, luxury suites, all that use an incredible amount of electricity to power them, such electrical current would've interfered with the radar, gauges, and navigational switches.  And using so much of this power would easily stall the jet engine; forget the cell phone scene, everything inside the plane would've shut this plane down.  I know there are planes that have excessive electrical devices for entertainment, but they're usually small private jets that hold 20 or so people, not commercial aircrafts that carry hundreds!  And with such large amount of rooms and equipment, they would exceed the weight limit of this jet, making it too heavy to liftoff, let alone fly; if it does fly, it would suddenly drop down and crash into the ground, killing its passengers.There are other nitpicks about the plane deserved mentioned.  If the plane isn't a hazard for passengers, it certainly inconveniences them, andpeople thought Southwest Airlines mistreats its customers.  They have to pay to use the lockers, their only selection of food is chicken (what, no grits or collard greens?) and they only serve malt liquor; why not include grape soda, it may be a racist drink, but it's non-alcoholic.  Family-friendly plane, my butt.  And to go off subject, there's that one scene where the couple were making love in a landing gear OUTSIDE when the plane's about to land.  Why didn't the heavy wind from the accelerated plane push the couple from the landing gear and fall to their death?  This whole plane is impossible!  Who in their right mind let Method Man design the plane?  Nothing about this flight is feasible! This is movie is so ridiculous, there's too much disbelief to suspend; it makes ""Airplane"" seem logical.The plot doesn't seem to exist once the plane takes off, it's just one insipid moment after another.  The plane got Snoop Dogg to fly a plane but he's afraid of heights, it has a Destiny's Child-knockoff music video as a safety instruction guide with no actual on-screen facts, an african co-pilot named 'Gayman', a Latina harlot who showed the crew how the flight controls by imitating her 'time' with a previous pilot, and it ends with a pointless dance party which has an Arab yelling 'it's da bomb'...and everyone overreacts.  Do I really have to explain how stupid ""Soul Plane"" is?  The only thing remotely plot-related is a sub-plot with Kevin Harp trying to get back with his former woman...and despite being boring and predictable, I would rather watch that than a series of lowbrow wisecracks.It's getting redundant for me to criticize another toilet and gay joke, so I'll just explain why I have a problem with them in this film. There's two occasions in the bathroom where a guy is squatting, shaking around and making farts; hey, I took a dookie and there's nothing funny about that; it's embarrassing.  Movies like this don't bother to take flatulence humor to any creative degree, instead hoping that if it's loud enough, it would be funny; that's now how it works.  Think of the ""Family Guy"" clip where Peter Griffin made a symphony from his farts, or the slow-motion scene ""Dave Chapelle Show"" where Dave farted so slowly in the toilet, the pressure of the gas propelled him away from the screen; those were funny fart jokes, they don't just make them vulgar, they make them ingenious.  And while I already discussed about the gay jokes in ""Boat Trip"", it seems as though movies like this think a gay character is funny just because he's gay.  Not because he has weird tastes in things, having ironic opinions, or has a peculiar personality that is unlike him, but because of the way he acts and dresses that defines his orientation.  I mean, dang, there's that one scene where the pilot mistakenly asked for homosexuals, and the village people and priests were running against the area; there's nothing relevant in that scene, it's just one obnoxious callout.  You can't just make a gay character blatant for laughs, there has to be other factions about him to be amusing; Mr. Garrison and that dude from ""True Blood"" aren't amusing because of their taste for men.Not only is ""Soul Plane"" awful, I'm just ashamed of it.  It really set the bar low for comedy in general, nothing is tasteful or dignified.  The stereotypical nature of this film goes too far, it actually insults its own audience.  Why should anyone want to give this movie a shot?

If I were black I'd be screaming at the top of my lungs for real entertainment instead of endless black culture parody films and over-the-top caricatures.What ruins this movie for me is the way whites are portrayed as buffoons; white men as hopeless geeks (or worse, ebonics spewing wannabes) and white women that suddenly want a black man (one simply because of large genitalia).  Most jokes in this movie are nothing new and have been played out in countless other black culture films.  The only saving grace for this movie is a few genuine laughs, but it's not enough to pull it out of the rut it's stuck in.Unless you're a hip-hop/rap fan and a fan of sensationalism black culture steer clear of this movie.

Thomas ""Gman777""","[2, 4]","The basic concept of the movie was great-A young Black American man, Nashawn Wade, wins a multi-million law suit from an Airline and decides to not listen to his older cousin's advice on questionable enterpreneurial persuits, but to invest his money into starting up his own airline service called Nashawn Wade Airlines or called by its official flying logo as ""NWA""-Which is funny because we all know what those initials stand for in the world of Hip-Hop music.  Nashawn (Kevin Hart) reminds his cousin (Method Man) of his bad idea of investing their money in a Strip Club/Day Care center, which only saw them loose all their money invested within a month. {That's funny}  The parts of the movie that were bad and just not funny are too numerous to list here, but suffice it say that the toilet humor scenes were not funny, people having sex on the landing gear while a plane is on decent to a landing field is so far-fetch.  An airplance has certain deminsions so a Boeing 747 should not appear to have a size that would suggest it is 40' wide and over 300' long- I mean to have a first-class section, a ""Low Class"" section, a hot tub swimming pool, a night club, plus all the galleys, etc. is just a bit much.I'll keep the movie only because it is shot well.  As with most films that star a lot of Blacks, you can depend on them for at least looking good with good color, good contrast, good shadow detail, and good sound. The color is vibrant-no sepia tone or weak-kneed color here.

(He got his buttocks stuck on a toilet seat while his plane was lifting off and saw his beloved dog get sucked into an engine.)  He buys his own airline, NWA, which caters to African Americans.  The plane is painted purple, its wheels have large silver chromed hub caps, and it bounces up and down on the runway.  A disco and strip bar are on board.  Also, the passengers are segregated into either a plush high class or a subway-like, no thrills low class.  However, everyone is having fun until the pilot (Snoop Dogg) overdoses on drugs and dies.I laughed from beginning to end.  I laughed until my ribs hurt.  Despite the laughter, my heart was warmed by the romantic story that unfolded in the background when Nashawn has a chance encounter with his ex-girlfriend Giselle.  He realizes that love is more important than money.However, for a few dollars, you can buy ""Soul Plane"" and have a few hours of non-stop laughter.

I'm not easily offended, either. `Soul plane' is just down right stupid!, You'll probably never see another movie quite like this! Some would say that's a good thing, but as I watched this I caught a few laughs. I've seen some pimped out rides, but a pimped out plane? I think people are taking this movie a bit too seriously, or they don't know how, when or why to laugh at this specific type of cultural humor, this is very obviously a FUBU movie. This is another movie that just pokes fun at everything & everybody.Racial stereotypes and black/white culture are embraced rather than dispelled. Some of the jokes are forced and other's had there awkward moments. Tom Arnold can be fun to watch, although he has not made anything like that since 'True Lies' but in this movie he was just average. Snoop Dogg can be a lot of fun, even in bad films, but here he is one of the worst things on board even though he had some funny lines. Monique was her usual self in her role. Dwayne Adway is a bit weak in the leading role he needed to stick to being the straight man. Stewardess Sofia Vergara has landed in this film from being pictured on a footballer's arm. And like Francine Dee (who plays the Chinese stripper here) is another one of the models and women that have appeared as portraits by the GB artist and psychic Stephen Armourae. This film tries to be an Airplane spoof. But that in itself was a spoof. Double negatives don't work well.I'm sort of scared to even recommend this movie for purchase, I rather say rent it out first, just to be on the safe side.

Director Jessy Terrero is now TRYING to defend this movie, but its no use. This movie relies heavily on sex, bathroom and race jokes that are offensive, of bad taste and -worst of all- unfunny. For example, when a blind man feels up a baked potato and orgasms based on what he thinks he is experiencing, I winced in embarrassment for the actor. Not only does the film offer ridiculous stereotypes (of Blacks, Middle Easterners, Gays, Whites etc.), the film insults the intelligence of the audience. Example, NWA's concourse is named X (after Malcolm). It comes complete with a basketball court, 99 cent store, and the terminal restaurant is Roscoe's Chicken n' Waffles. The plane is equipped with a dance club and a studio for making hip-hop music videos, the bathroom is equipped with a fold-out table for wannabe mile high clubbers, and the choice of drink for coach class is malt liquor.

I'm not a big fan of slapstick or toilet humor, and in this film, toilet humor abounds.Overall, I felt Tom Arnold, and Snoop Dogg gave good performances, but their performances were overshadowed by too much raunch and not enough plot. I give this film a D+ for the occasional humorous scenes, but I cannot honestly recommend it....

You feel embarassed for the characters on the set. Not for the actors, as they dug their own graves by signing onto this plane crash of a film, but for the characters. You ask yourself: why the hell are you doing something so stupid? Why on earth did you just say that ridiculous piece of dialogue? Why are you on a purple plane and so on.That being said, doesn't that plane look a lot like Barney?What I was most dissapointed with is just the low level of satire in this film. Well, I actually did find it to be more intellectually stimulating than the standard Carlos Mencia skit, but I still found it to be on a very low level. I mean, there were so many sterotypes that they missed completely. I think that the white people can't dance stereotype went almost completely untouched and they had all the components right in front of them.  And what about the inexcusable way in which watermelon was completely omitted from the film? Where the hell were the barbecques? Why wasn't anybody robbed at knifepoint? Why were there no jokes about Mexicans seeing the virgin mary in airplane food? Why did the Arab lack bombs strapped to his body? Why were there no dead goldfish in the player's boots?Now that I have pointed out all of these inexcusable omissions, I have to ask: why was the movie so short? Racial stereotyping provides more material than a thousand talented writers.That being said, the movie provides a few laughs, but they are not enough to make this movie passable or more appealling than a Colt 45 and some Popeyes. Smoke a blunt and watch this, I know I did, but it will still not be enough to make humour of a man sticking his fingers into mashed potatos and thinking that it is a female sexual organ.",2,Come on its not as bad as everyone says it is...,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,1827,"['yeah', 'well', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'still', 'quite', 'bad.Soul', 'Plane', 'movie', 'watch', 'cringe', 'feel', 'embarassed', 'characters', 'set', 'Not', 'actors', 'dug', 'own', 'graves', 'signing', 'plane', 'crash', 'film', 'characters', 'ask', 'why', 'hell', 'are', 'doing', 'something', 'so', 'stupid', 'Why', 'earth', 'did', 'just', 'say', 'ridiculous', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'Why', 'are', 'purple', 'plane', 'so', 'being', 'said', ""n't"", 'plane', 'look', 'lot', 'Barney', 'What', 'was', 'most', 'dissapointed', 'just', 'low', 'level', 'satire', 'film', 'Well', 'actually', 'did', 'find', 'be', 'more', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'standard', 'Carlos', 'Mencia', 'skit', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'low', 'level', 'mean', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'sterotypes', 'missed', 'completely', 'think', 'white', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'stereotype', 'went', 'almost', 'completely', 'untouched', 'had', 'components', 'right', 'front', 'what', 'inexcusable', 'way', 'watermelon', 'was', 'completely', 'omitted', 'film', 'Where', 'hell', 'were', 'barbecques', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'robbed', 'knifepoint', 'Why', 'were', 'jokes', 'Mexicans', 'seeing', 'virgin', 'mary', 'airplane', 'food', 'Why', 'did', 'Arab', 'lack', 'bombs', 'strapped', 'body', 'Why', 'were', 'dead', 'goldfish', 'player', 'boots', 'Now', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'inexcusable', 'omissions', 'have', 'ask', 'why', 'was', 'movie', 'so', 'short', 'Racial', 'stereotyping', 'more', 'material', 'thousand', 'talented', 'writers.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'few', 'laughs', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'passable', 'more', 'appealling', 'Colt', '45', 'Popeyes', 'Smoke', 'blunt', 'watch', 'know', 'did', 'will', 'still', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'humour', 'man', 'sticking', 'fingers', 'mashed', 'potatos', 'thinking', 'female', 'sexual', 'organ']",N/A

836862,A15MLF38WROSWU,B0002J4YVK,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[3, 5]","I kept hearing all the negative reviews for Soul Plane, but wanted to see the movie for myself.  I'm not going to deny there were some pretty funny parts in the film, but they were overshadowed by the stereotypical nonsense which is why I'm giving this movie a low rating.  I saw the unrated version of the DVD.The movie starts out with a little baby Nashawn staring up at the sky looking at planes.  Cut to him rushing to catch his flight with his pooch in tow.  Nashawn is riding a plane and his dog has to go with the baggage.  After reacting to some beef stroganoff, and a hilarious scene in the bathroom, he sees his beloved dog get killed.  He sues and he wins a huge settlement which he uses to start his own airlines.  NWA (Nashawn Wade Airlines) is born.  To me this is where things get a little to ghettofied for me.  I mean a purple pimped out plane with rims and hydraulics?  Security (Monique and & Loni Love) are too busy dancing and rapping to check each passenger before they go through the checkpoint.  That is until Monique's character comes across a rather handsome passenger that she feels she must check a little more thoroughly (Richard T. Jones from Judging Amy, but he did not receive a film credit.....probably a good thing).Mr. Honkee (Tom Arnold) is traveling with his son, daughter and girlfriend, and after their flight is cancelled, they are put on NWA airlines.  The only white family on the plane.  The girlfriend sees all the black folks and gets nervous, son has an identity crisis and trying to be ""gangsta"", Mr. Honkee is drooling over all the black women he sees.  The fast daughter of his talks about turning 18, and some sexual situations she should have been smacked for even saying she would do.  When his girlfriend sees the cover of Black and Proud magazine with a guy that's very, very, very gifted, and she is intrigued.  Later we find out she suffered vocal cord damage and can't speak.  Yeah okay.As passengers get on the plane they are either put in First Class, Business Class or Low Class.  In Low Class the seats are close together, it's loud, it looks a little dingy.  To use the overhead compartment, you have to pay for it.  The drinks offered are Colt 45 or Alize.  The smart mouthed daughter steals the little bottles of liquor when the cart is near her.  There is a safety video where the three of the flight attendants (a Latina who flings her hair a lot, Flame the flamboyant gay attendant(Smart Brother from Undercover Brother), and Tamika(Angel Conwell The Wash, Baby Boy)) sing to the tune of Survivor.  First class is very spaceious and well lit and just plain nice.  The Pilot of the plane is Captain Mack, an ex-con who is afraid of heights, never flew before, and spends his flight getting as high as possible.  I'm not talking plane altitude.  In low class the meal of choice is Popeye's Chicken.  They also have to share napkins ""sharing is caring,"" is what the flight attendant says.Other cast of characters in the film include John Witherspoon who gets freaky with a baked potato thinking it's the female passenger next to him.  I will never look at a baked potato the same again.  DJ & Cherry(Brian Hooks and Sommore) are the couple trying to join the mile high club.  Gaeman (Godfrey - 7 up guy) the co-pilot who feels he should be a pilot.  Method Man running the Business side of the plane had gambling, then of course what's a black movie without the strippers?  Why was there a video being filmed on the plane?  I really could have done without Lil Jon and the Ying Yang twins.Side plot (if you can call it that) is Nashawn seeing his ex love Gisselle on the flight.  Captain Mack eats one African Mushroom too many and dies.  Nashawn has to figure out how to fly, and land the plane.  That part of the film was kind of worthy of a chuckle.The issue I had with the movie is the overuse of black stereotypes.  As a black woman I'm really tired of the chicken eating, getting high, and getting drunk, over sexed mentality that some black movies seem to like to joke about.  It's old, tired and unfunny.  Also what grown man says ""I have to boo boo?""After seeing this movie I can understand all the negative press this movie received.  It was warranted.  If you watch the extras Monique says she did not want to do the movie originally. Perhaps she should have stuck with her first instinct.",2,Stereotype overload,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,4364,"['kept', 'hearing', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Soul', 'Plane', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'deny', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'stereotypical', 'nonsense', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', 'low', 'rating', 'saw', 'unrated', 'version', 'DVD.The', 'movie', 'out', 'little', 'baby', 'Nashawn', 'staring', 'up', 'sky', 'looking', 'planes', 'Cut', 'rushing', 'catch', 'flight', 'pooch', 'tow', 'Nashawn', 'riding', 'plane', 'dog', 'go', 'baggage', 'reacting', 'beef', 'stroganoff', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'beloved', 'dog', 'get', 'killed', 'huge', 'settlement', 'start', 'own', 'airlines', 'NWA', 'Nashawn', 'Wade', 'Airlines', 'born', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'ghettofied', 'mean', 'purple', 'pimped', 'out', 'plane', 'rims', 'hydraulics', 'Security', 'Monique', 'Loni', 'Love', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'dancing', 'rapping', 'check', 'passenger', 'go', 'checkpoint', 'Monique', 'character', 'rather', 'handsome', 'passenger', 'must', 'check', 'little', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'Richard', 'T.', 'Jones', 'Judging', 'Amy', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'film', 'credit', '..probably', 'good', 'thing', '.Mr', 'Honkee', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'traveling', 'son', 'daughter', 'girlfriend', 'flight', 'cancelled', 'are', 'put', 'NWA', 'airlines', 'only', 'white', 'family', 'plane', 'girlfriend', 'black', 'folks', 'nervous', 'son', 'identity', 'crisis', 'trying', 'be', 'gangsta', 'Mr.', 'Honkee', 'drooling', 'black', 'women', 'fast', 'daughter', 'talks', 'turning', '18', 'sexual', 'situations', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'smacked', 'even', 'saying', 'would', 'do', 'When', 'girlfriend', 'cover', 'Black', 'Proud', 'magazine', 'guy', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'gifted', 'intrigued', 'Later', 'find', 'out', 'suffered', 'vocal', 'cord', 'damage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Yeah', 'okay.As', 'passengers', 'get', 'plane', 'are', 'put', 'First', 'Class', 'Business', 'Class', 'Low', 'Class', 'Low', 'Class', 'seats', 'are', 'close', 'together', 'loud', 'little', 'dingy', 'use', 'overhead', 'compartment', 'have', 'pay', 'drinks', 'offered', 'are', 'Colt', '45', 'Alize', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'daughter', 'steals', 'little', 'bottles', 'liquor', 'when', 'cart', 'safety', 'video', 'where', 'three', 'flight', 'attendants', 'Latina', 'who', 'hair', 'lot', 'Flame', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'attendant', 'Smart', 'Brother', 'Undercover', 'Brother', 'Tamika', 'Angel', 'Conwell', 'Wash', 'Baby', 'Boy', 'sing', 'tune', 'Survivor', 'First', 'class', 'very', 'spaceious', 'well', 'lit', 'just', 'plain', 'nice', 'Pilot', 'plane', 'Captain', 'Mack', 'ex-con', 'who', 'afraid', 'heights', 'never', 'flew', 'flight', 'getting', 'as', 'high', 'possible', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'plane', 'altitude', 'low', 'class', 'meal', 'choice', 'Popeye', 'Chicken', 'also', 'have', 'share', 'napkins', 'sharing', 'caring', 'what', 'flight', 'attendant', 'says.Other', 'cast', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'John', 'Witherspoon', 'who', 'freaky', 'baked', 'potato', 'thinking', 'female', 'passenger', 'next', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'baked', 'potato', 'same', 'again', 'DJ', 'Cherry', 'Brian', 'Hooks', 'Sommore', 'are', 'couple', 'trying', 'join', 'mile', 'high', 'club', 'Gaeman', 'Godfrey', '7', 'guy', 'co-pilot', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'pilot', 'Method', 'Man', 'running', 'Business', 'side', 'plane', 'had', 'gambling', 'then', 'course', 'what', 'black', 'movie', 'strippers', 'Why', 'was', 'video', 'being', 'filmed', 'plane', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Lil', 'Jon', 'Ying', 'Yang', 'twins.Side', 'plot', 'can', 'call', 'Nashawn', 'seeing', 'ex', 'love', 'Gisselle', 'flight', 'Captain', 'Mack', 'one', 'African', 'Mushroom', 'too', 'many', 'dies', 'Nashawn', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'fly', 'land', 'plane', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'worthy', 'chuckle.The', 'issue', 'had', 'movie', 'overuse', 'black', 'stereotypes', 'black', 'woman', ""'m"", 'really', 'tired', 'chicken', 'eating', 'getting', 'high', 'getting', 'drunk', 'sexed', 'mentality', 'black', 'movies', 'seem', 'like', 'joke', 'old', 'tired', 'unfunny', 'Also', 'what', 'grown', 'man', 'have', 'boo', 'boo', 'seeing', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'negative', 'press', 'movie', 'received', 'was', 'warranted', 'watch', 'extras', 'Monique', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'movie', 'originally', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'first', 'instinct']",N/A

I'd recommend that if you want to watch this then dont expect it to be a great comedy - instead get a real comedy like School of Rock of How High instead! the film tried to copy the excellent and witty Airplane films - but definetly didnt work.,1,Absolute waste of time,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,683,"['film', 'definetly', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'was', 'surrounding', 'really', 'boring', 'towards', 'end', 'ending', 'btw', 'so', 'general', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'let', 'down', 'too', 'full', 'racial', 'sterotypes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ALOT', 'funnier', 'jokes', 'are', 'quite', 'lame', 'storyline', 'predictable', 'annoying', 'thing', 'was', 'Method', 'Man', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'minor', 'roles', 'play', 'film', 'almost', 'guest', 'appearances', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'want', 'watch', 'then', 'expect', 'be', 'great', 'comedy', 'instead', 'get', 'real', 'comedy', 'School', 'Rock', 'How', 'High', 'instead', 'film', 'tried', 'copy', 'excellent', 'witty', 'Airplane', 'films', 'definetly', 'didnt', 'work']",N/A
836871,A2UVJD6OOLKEBR,B0002J4YVK,yaremar,"[2, 5]","Critics have lambasted SOUL PLANE for being lowbrow and tasteless. Lowbrow? A movie that awards Tom Arnold top billing? Tasteless? With all those standup comics from DEF COMEDY JAM , that Peabody Award-worthy showcase for understated humor and dry wit? How could this possibly be? Man, talk about selling consumers a phony bill of goods!I'm not trying to make a case that SOUL PLANE is a comedic gem (it most certainly is not) but I'm puzzled by the indignation expressed by many reviewers. What were they expecting from a film that gives employment to Snoop Dogg, Mo'nique, Method Man, and John Witherspoon? An adaptation of THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST? Doesn't the very nature of this project scream BAWDY BATHROOM HUMOR?In a nutshell, this is AIRPLANE! for the UPN crowd, with Kevin Hart as the owner of an airline that caters to African-American clientele. Jokes about body parts and body functions fly fast and free, along with the kind of earthy humor that makes a lot of enlightened people squirm. I don't represent the target audience for a film like SOUL PLANE, and I wish that some of the folks who regularly review movies would admit the same. So take a close look at the cover art. Then consider the film's concept. It's entirely your decision whether or not to see this movie.

836872,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,B0002J4YVK,Zack H.,"[2, 5]","Soul Plane is about Nashawn Wade, who decides to sue an airline after experiencing a horrible mishap on one of their flights. He wins the case, and decides to establish an airplane company of his own, N.W.A. Airlines, and his dreams are fulfilled. His planes are accompanied with sexy stewardesses, a dance club, and even a bathroom attendant. I chuckled only once, and it was at the scene where Mr. Hunkee (played by Tom Arnold) interacts with the bathroom attendant (played by D.L. Hughley).This has to be one of the most cliched filled films I've ever seen, as it is filled with a bunch of stereotypes, lame jokes that have been rehashed countless times, rap star cameos, racist and sexist undertones, and bad acting. This is DEFINITELY one of the worst films I've ever seen. It currently sits on IMDB's bottom 100 list. If that isn't convincing enough, even two of the film's stars, D.L. Hughley and Snoop Dogg, apologized for it. In the end: Soul Plane crashes before it even takes off.
