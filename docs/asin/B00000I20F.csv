Of course, when they sell the complete blue ray set as a complete season 1-5 set, that is when I'll upgrade, maybe, I do collect blue ray tv shows selectively so far.  Bought an older dvd set off ebay with this disc, knowing that the later definitive edition had more special features, on fewer discs of course, mainly since there isn't as much digital compression per disc per episode.

502068,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B00000I20F,Frederick Baptist,"[1, 1]","Folks there's a good reason why this dvd is described as ""Treasures"" and not ""Best of"" or other similar title.  The 3 episodes here are truly treasures in the sense that they are hard to find and relatively rare episodes.  These are not the very best episodes in the franchise and currently you'll need to get the complete set at an incredibly exhorbitant price to get these at least until they decide to release a best of dvd for those of us who can't afford or really don't want to see every single episode from all 5 seasons.The first episode is literally the first and as such, one doesn't or at least shouldn't expect perfection at least relative to later works as Rod Serling is just cutting his teeth here and is trying to get a feel for what his ob markers or boundaries are with respect sponsor and censor tolerance.  As a result, we get for new fans and those curious about what Twilight Zone is all about the debut episode and a chance to see how far the quality of the episodes develop over time to what we now know and love.The second episode is also a rarity in that it isn't shown anymore or at least rarely because of the huge controversy it stirred regarding its topic of racial discrimination, bigotry and tolerance.  Unlike most TZ episodes, this one I felt was very good as the supernatural element isn't as important and in fact is barely noticeable while the real intent of the episode is to educate and force us to face an unpleasant aspect of our flawed humanity.  Many people are ashamed to admit that they are closet racists because they somehow know and feel that it is wrong and yet it is by talking it out, admitting to a problem intead of denial is probably the best way to lick it and come to think of it any problem.I actually felt sorry for Fenton as it seemed especially at the end that he was actually trying to reach out to someone to admit his problems seeking a solution but his pride and in his clumsy way, he only managed to infuriate the very person he was looking at getting some help and healing from.  Both Fenton and Takamuri were dealing with deep seated guilt problems that they had buried deep within themselves and ironically when they came close to healing by bringing these feelings out to the surface to confront them, they actually end up destroying each other.  For this reason, I believe that this is truly a treasure of TZ in that it is a very deep and special episode that lifts the 30 minute feature into the realms of artform which I believe is what Rod Serling intended as well.In the very good and informative interview included among the bonus features we hear Rod speaking about his frustrations at censorship and about how he wanted to address important social issues in his work but had been frustrated until he decided to try doing this with the Twilight Zone.  In my opinion, he achieved this very well with ""The Encounter.""  A very good metaphor showing how society sometimes causes the destruction of people by refusing those who need healing to come clean by insisting on punishing the symptoms instead of allowing the root cause to be cured.  We focus on the racist and discriminatory themes instead of seeing the bigger message that this is really a story of two people crying out for help which for them never comes.The jewel in the crown of this dvd is ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" which would be spoiled if anyone told you anything about it.  Just like Agatha Christie's ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" you'll need to see it totally unprepared to enjoy this masterpiece.  This and the previous episode come very close to being described as short film art.If you are looking for true treasures from the whole TZ franchise you have in these 3 episodes jewels for the reasons described above.  Unfortunately though the sound quality although decent by Dolby Digital Mono standards should have added the 5.1 or DTS surround audio options although if your system has Pro Logic capabilities, it does somewhat help to make up for this deficiency.  The picture quality isn't very good though but judging from the quality of the Mike Wallace interview and the Advertiser Pitch, you can tell that a lot has been restored and that it's a great improvement but you still see lots of white specks here and there on all 3 episodes.For this reason, if you don't mind the hefty price tag, you should get the complete franchise on dvd which I believe has been much better restored.  If you are looking at a sampler, this is it but if you are looking for something a little more but not the full set than like me you'll have to wait.  Otherwise, a nice dvd of different but still very good Twilight Zone episodes.",4,Very Apt Name Indeed for This DVD!,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,4675,"['Folks', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'dvd', 'described', 'Treasures', 'not', 'Best', 'other', 'similar', 'title', '3', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'truly', 'treasures', 'sense', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'relatively', 'rare', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'franchise', 'currently', ""'ll"", 'need', 'get', 'complete', 'set', 'incredibly', 'exhorbitant', 'price', 'get', 'least', 'decide', 'release', 'best', 'dvd', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'single', 'episode', '5', 'seasons.The', 'first', 'episode', 'literally', 'first', 'such', 'one', ""n't"", 'least', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'perfection', 'least', 'relative', 'later', 'works', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'just', 'cutting', 'teeth', 'here', 'trying', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'ob', 'markers', 'boundaries', 'are', 'respect', 'sponsor', 'censor', 'tolerance', 'result', 'get', 'new', 'fans', 'curious', 'what', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'debut', 'episode', 'chance', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'quality', 'episodes', 'develop', 'time', 'what', 'now', 'know', 'love.The', 'second', 'episode', 'also', 'rarity', ""n't"", 'shown', 'anymore', 'least', 'rarely', 'huge', 'controversy', 'stirred', 'regarding', 'topic', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'bigotry', 'tolerance', 'most', 'TZ', 'one', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'supernatural', 'element', ""n't"", 'important', 'fact', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'real', 'intent', 'episode', 'educate', 'force', 'face', 'unpleasant', 'aspect', 'flawed', 'humanity', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'are', 'closet', 'racists', 'somehow', 'know', 'feel', 'wrong', 'yet', 'talking', 'out', 'admitting', 'problem', 'intead', 'denial', 'probably', 'best', 'way', 'lick', 'come', 'think', 'problem.I', 'actually', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Fenton', 'seemed', 'especially', 'end', 'was', 'actually', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'someone', 'admit', 'problems', 'seeking', 'solution', 'pride', 'clumsy', 'way', 'only', 'managed', 'infuriate', 'very', 'person', 'was', 'looking', 'getting', 'help', 'healing', 'Fenton', 'Takamuri', 'were', 'dealing', 'deep', 'seated', 'guilt', 'problems', 'had', 'buried', 'deep', 'ironically', 'when', 'came', 'close', 'healing', 'bringing', 'feelings', 'out', 'surface', 'confront', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'destroying', 'other', 'reason', 'believe', 'truly', 'treasure', 'TZ', 'very', 'deep', 'special', 'episode', '30', 'minute', 'feature', 'realms', 'artform', 'believe', 'what', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'intended', 'well.In', 'very', 'good', 'informative', 'interview', 'included', 'bonus', 'hear', 'Rod', 'speaking', 'frustrations', 'censorship', 'how', 'wanted', 'address', 'important', 'social', 'issues', 'work', 'had', 'been', 'frustrated', 'decided', 'try', 'doing', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'opinion', 'achieved', 'very', 'well', 'Encounter', 'very', 'good', 'metaphor', 'showing', 'how', 'society', 'sometimes', 'destruction', 'people', 'refusing', 'who', 'need', 'healing', 'come', 'clean', 'insisting', 'punishing', 'symptoms', 'instead', 'allowing', 'root', 'cause', 'be', 'cured', 'focus', 'racist', 'discriminatory', 'themes', 'instead', 'seeing', 'bigger', 'message', 'really', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'crying', 'out', 'help', 'never', 'comes.The', 'jewel', 'crown', 'dvd', 'Occurrence', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge', 'would', 'be', 'spoiled', 'anyone', 'told', 'anything', 'Just', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Murder', 'Roger', 'Ackroyd', ""'ll"", 'need', 'see', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'enjoy', 'masterpiece', 'previous', 'episode', 'come', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'described', 'short', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'true', 'treasures', 'whole', 'TZ', 'franchise', 'have', '3', 'episodes', 'jewels', 'reasons', 'described', 'above', 'Unfortunately', 'sound', 'quality', 'decent', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Mono', 'standards', 'should', 'have', 'added', '5.1', 'DTS', 'surround', 'audio', 'options', 'system', 'Pro', 'Logic', 'capabilities', 'somewhat', 'help', 'make', 'up', 'deficiency', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'judging', 'quality', 'Mike', 'Wallace', 'interview', 'Advertiser', 'Pitch', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'been', 'restored', 'great', 'improvement', 'still', 'see', 'lots', 'white', 'specks', 'here', 'there', '3', 'episodes.For', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'hefty', 'price', 'tag', 'should', 'get', 'complete', 'franchise', 'dvd', 'believe', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'restored', 'are', 'looking', 'sampler', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'not', 'full', 'set', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'Otherwise', 'nice', 'dvd', 'different', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'Twilight', 'Zone']",Treasures of The Twilight Zone

This two-man play is a tour-de-force of acting and drama that is possible and rarely seen from this medium. Some men bury their guilt by making their own prejudices while others carry it as an inherited burden. How do men cope with guilt be it real or imagined and can ordinary circumstances set those emotions off in an unexpected explosion of violence? Neville Brand and George Takei find out.WHERE IS EVERYBODY? endearingly introduces the running theme, the very spirit, of what defines the Twilight Zone. A man alone (Earl Holliman) finds himself totally isolated in an unfamiliar town, yet with very familiar surroundings found in any ""Hometown America"" setting. But, who is he, where is he and why is he there? Written by Rod Serling and directed by Rober Stevens.AN OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE was a French film, based on the short story by Ambrose Bierce. It won first prize for short subjects at Cannes in 1962 at was sparingly re-edited for the Twilight Zone. It was written and directed by Robert Enrico, it is one of the most memorable episodes shown on the Twilight Zone.

502070,A2VLM3Z7KYN98P,B00000I20F,H R Kuehne,"[29, 32]","&quot;An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; (the original English name for this French film which was presented as Episode 142 of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; on 2/28/64) is this DVD's ONLY raison d'tre. The other two TZ episodes (&quot;Where Is Everybody?&quot; and &quot;The Encounter&quot;) appear on DVD volumes 43 and 33, respectively, and the fillers (The '59 Serling/Wallace interview and &quot;Inside the Twilight Zone&quot;) are shamelessly (or perhaps shamefully) duplicated on &quot;More Treasures From the Twilight Zone.&quot; So, is this DVD worth its price just for this one feature? Probably. In the first place, it is based on an Ambrose Bierce short story. Bierce is best known for his acidly satiric aphorisms in _The Devil's Dictionary_, but, more to the point here, he was also a consummate (arguably America's best) short story writer, and this story in particular has achieved near legendary status in literary circles. In its French video version, it won best short subject in the '62 Cannes and '63 BAFTA (British Academy Awards) competitions. Somewhere along the line, Rod Serling saw it, and when William Froung (the series' producer for its final episodes) told him that the 36-episode budget had been exceeded after only 35 episodes, Serling suggested acquiring US TV rights to the French film. For a paltry $10,000, which saved the 5th season's budget, but not the series, the deal was done. Later that year, probably as a result of the exposure it received on TZ, the film completed its hat trick by winning the '64 Academy Award for best short subject. Although I'm not positive on this point, I believe it to be the least expensive and most highly honored half-hour-long film in the history of US television. The original film (with a few minutes of footage that was cut for the TZ version and sans the Serling narration) is available as a VHS cassette, but, for the few dollars extra, I recommend that you go ahead and buy this DVD -- especially if you don't already have one or more of its other features.",4,La Rivire du hibou,998352000,"08 21, 2001",2001,2041,"['quot', 'Occurance', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge', 'quot', 'original', 'English', 'name', 'French', 'film', 'was', 'presented', 'Episode', '142', 'quot', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'quot', '2/28/64', 'DVD', 'ONLY', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'other', 'two', 'TZ', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Where', 'Everybody', 'quot', 'quot', 'Encounter', 'quot', 'appear', 'DVD', 'volumes', '43', '33', 'respectively', 'fillers', ""'59"", 'Serling/Wallace', 'interview', 'quot', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'quot', 'are', 'shamelessly', 'perhaps', 'shamefully', 'duplicated', 'quot', 'More', 'Treasures', 'Twilight', 'Zone.', 'quot', 'So', 'DVD', 'price', 'just', 'one', 'feature', 'Probably', 'first', 'place', 'based', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'short', 'story', 'Bierce', 'best', 'known', 'acidly', 'satiric', 'aphorisms', '_The', 'Devil', 'Dictionary_', 'more', 'point', 'here', 'was', 'also', 'consummate', 'arguably', 'America', 'best', 'short', 'story', 'writer', 'story', 'particular', 'achieved', 'legendary', 'status', 'literary', 'circles', 'French', 'video', 'version', 'won', 'best', 'short', 'subject', ""'62"", 'Cannes', ""'63"", 'BAFTA', 'British', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'competitions', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'saw', 'when', 'William', 'Froung', 'series', 'producer', 'final', 'episodes', 'told', '36-episode', 'budget', 'had', 'been', 'exceeded', 'only', '35', 'episodes', 'Serling', 'suggested', 'acquiring', 'US', 'TV', 'rights', 'French', 'film', 'paltry', '10,000', 'saved', '5th', 'season', 'budget', 'not', 'series', 'deal', 'was', 'done', 'Later', 'year', 'probably', 'result', 'exposure', 'received', 'TZ', 'film', 'completed', 'hat', 'trick', 'winning', ""'64"", 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'short', 'subject', ""'m"", 'not', 'positive', 'point', 'believe', 'be', 'least', 'expensive', 'most', 'highly', 'honored', 'half-hour-long', 'film', 'history', 'US', 'television', 'original', 'film', 'few', 'minutes', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'TZ', 'version', 'Serling', 'narration', 'available', 'VHS', 'cassette', 'few', 'dollars', 'extra', 'recommend', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'DVD', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'other', 'features']",Treasures of The Twilight Zone
502071,A366S12KCZ280V,B00000I20F,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","""Treasures Of The Twilight Zone"" is just that for any fan of the original ""Twilight Zone"" series, a treasure to have. It is a special DVD with three important episodes from the series. In all three cases these episodes appeared only once on television then never shown again, not even making it into syndication. The  first of the three episodes is ""Where Is Everybody?"". This is a very important episode because it was the premiere episode that helped to start ""Twilight Zone"". Starring Earl Holliman the bulk of the story is just him wondering around a town with nobody anywhere to be seen. Even so Mike Ferris (Holliman) can't shake this feeling that he is being watched. To further frustrate things he can't remember his name or why or how he ended up there.The second episode was considered a controversial episode which is why it was only shown once and never appeared on the air again. It is titled ""The Encounter"" starring Neville Brand and George Takei. A couple of years later George Takei would become well known to everyone as Mr. Sulu on ""Star Trek"". Brand is a World War II veteran who fought against the Japanese. He hires Arthur Takamuri (Takei) to mow his lawn then then invites Takamuri to have a beer and shows off a samurai sword he took from a captured Japanese soldier. When he holds the sword Takamuri suddenly has a feeling come over him that he must kill this WW II vet. During their conversation both men admit to holding a deep shame from events that occurred in their lives. The story is an excellent look at racism and how it effects logic and reason.The final episode is the last episode that would appear on the show before ""Twilight Zone would be cancelled by CBS. It is in fact the only episode that wasn't made for ""Twilight Zone"". It is called ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"". Based on a short story by 19th century writer Ambrose Bierce it was made in France as a short film. The story goes that as the fifth season was winding down ""Twilight Zone"" was in danger of going over budget for the season. Apparently it may have been Serling who had seen this short film and thought why not buy the rights to the film and show it on TZ. The idea worked. They bought the rights to the film for something like $10,000. It brought the series for the year under budget and at the same time provided a great program that while not made for ""Twilight Zone"" still fit right in to the spirit of the show. ""Owl Creek"" would in fact go on to win the Academy Award for best short Film of 1963.If you are a fan of the original ""Twilight Zone"" then there is no doubt this is a must have DVD to add to your collection. These three stories represent some of the best work ever shown during the 5 year run of the show. This is one treasure that is priceless to have.

Bernabo,"[5, 6]","&quot;Treasures of The Twilight Zone&quot; offers three episodes that are not seen in syndication for various reasons.  &quot;Where is Everybody?&quot; was the pilot episode for &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot;  Written by Rod Serling, it stars Earl Holliman as Mike Ferris, apparently a member of the U.S. Air Force since he is wearing a jumpsuit, but who is suffering from amnesia.  Finding himself in a town where all the people have disappeared, Ferris still has the feeling he is being watched.  An average episode, it does set the tone for future Twilight Zone twists.  &quot;The Encounter,&quot; written by Martin Goldsmith, pits a bigoted World War II veteran named Fenton (Neville Brand) against a young Japanese-American gardener named Taro (George Takei).  Things come to a head when the samurai sword Fenton claims to have taken off a Japanese solider apparently inspires the two men to confess their worst sins when trapped in an attic.  Ironically, Brand was the fourth-most decorated U.S. Army soldier from World War II.  &quot;The Encounter&quot; is another episode that is not shown in syndication, presumably because of its fairly overt racism (for the time) and its somewhat offensive suggestion there was a Japanese-American traitor who was directing enemy plans at Pearl Harbor.Finally, we have &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,&quot; which was a French film that had won first prize for short subjects at Cannes in 1962.  Written and Directed by Robert Enrico, it is based on the short story by Ambrose Bierce.  Since the film only had a half-dozen lines in it, dubbing an &quot;English version&quot; was relatively easy.  A few minutes were cut and Serling's opening and closing narration (which made it clear this was a French film) were added.  Robert Jacquet stars as a Confederate about to be hung for being a spy with Anne Cornaly as the wife he desperately wants to return home to see.  This short film went on to win an Oscar in 1964 for Best Short Subject, Live Action Subjects.  This collection of episodes is actually better than I remember from way back when, although none of them qualify as classics from the celebrated television series.",4,What was lost has now been found in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;,994204800,"07 4, 2001",2001,2179,"['quot', 'Treasures', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'quot', 'offers', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'seen', 'syndication', 'various', 'reasons', 'quot', 'Where', 'Everybody', 'quot', 'was', 'pilot', 'episode', 'quot', 'Twilight', 'Zone.', 'quot', 'Written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Earl', 'Holliman', 'Mike', 'Ferris', 'apparently', 'member', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'wearing', 'jumpsuit', 'who', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'Finding', 'town', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'disappeared', 'Ferris', 'still', 'feeling', 'being', 'watched', 'average', 'episode', 'set', 'tone', 'future', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'quot', 'Encounter', 'quot', 'written', 'Martin', 'Goldsmith', 'bigoted', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veteran', 'named', 'Fenton', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'young', 'Japanese-American', 'gardener', 'named', 'Taro', 'George', 'Takei', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'samurai', 'sword', 'Fenton', 'have', 'taken', 'off', 'Japanese', 'solider', 'apparently', 'two', 'men', 'confess', 'worst', 'sins', 'when', 'trapped', 'attic', 'Ironically', 'Brand', 'was', 'fourth-most', 'decorated', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'soldier', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'quot', 'Encounter', 'quot', 'episode', 'not', 'shown', 'syndication', 'presumably', 'fairly', 'overt', 'racism', 'time', 'somewhat', 'offensive', 'suggestion', 'was', 'Japanese-American', 'traitor', 'who', 'was', 'directing', 'enemy', 'plans', 'Pearl', 'Harbor.Finally', 'have', 'quot', 'Occurrence', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge', 'quot', 'was', 'French', 'film', 'had', 'won', 'first', 'prize', 'short', 'subjects', 'Cannes', '1962', 'Written', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Enrico', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'film', 'only', 'had', 'half-dozen', 'lines', 'dubbing', 'quot', 'English', 'version', 'quot', 'was', 'relatively', 'easy', 'few', 'minutes', 'were', 'cut', 'Serling', 'opening', 'closing', 'narration', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'French', 'film', 'were', 'added', 'Robert', 'Jacquet', 'Confederate', 'be', 'hung', 'being', 'spy', 'Anne', 'Cornaly', 'wife', 'desperately', 'return', 'home', 'see', 'short', 'film', 'went', 'win', 'Oscar', '1964', 'Best', 'Short', 'Subject', 'Live', 'Action', 'Subjects', 'collection', 'episodes', 'actually', 'better', 'remember', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'none', 'qualify', 'classics', 'celebrated', 'television', 'series']",Treasures of The Twilight Zone
