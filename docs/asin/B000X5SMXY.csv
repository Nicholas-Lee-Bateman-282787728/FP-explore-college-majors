It is one of the best Superman shows ever.  The special effects on Superman Returns were great, but the story was not so great.  What they should have done is wait for the show to conclude and then do a Superman movie with the Smallville cast.  The latest I hear on the next Superman movie is that they are going to reboot it, just like they did with the Incredible Hulk. That means somebody else besides Brandon Routh will be wearing the tights.  I say they wait for the reboot until after Smallville wraps and then do a Superman movie with Tom Welling and crew.Getting back to season 7, I like how Kara is introduced.  I also like how other superheros have been portrayed here.  My favortie is the Martian Manhunter (John Jonzz).Nothing against Amazon, but occasionally check out Best Buy' s Sunday ad.

This season earns four stars for two big reasons.1) Shorten Season/Writer's Strike: We were given a rushed and often times confusing arc this season. Episodes sometimes felt hurried and uncomplete, leaving far more questions than answsers. The cohesiveness of this season is not as strong as seasons prior, say last season, which re-invigrorated my initial love for the show. However some weak story arcs and writing can't take away from the amazing acting this season. Tom and Michael show their acting muscles. I never thought that the writers would go that evil with Lex, but they finally went there and it was great. The introduction of Laura Vandervoort/Supergirl was an added treat. Her interactions with Clark made for some instant classics.2) Despite a shortened season and a same old DVD special features, we are expected to a pay a regular season price for a this set. Absurb! Foul! Give us loyal fans a little more than that. Free comic booklet? Sneak Peek into next season? Making of Season 7 commentary? Candy?However, the strengths of this seasons (i.e.: getting rid of Lana (thank god), Supergirl, the descent into Lex's evil, and the return and introduction of several DC heros and villians) make it impossible for me to say no to buying this season's box set.

1113361,A3QDALCWH5OB80,B000X5SMXY,Andreas,"[0, 2]","The best about this seventh season of Smallville is the score music by Mark Snow/Louis Febre, who composed some beautiful emotional music for this season, too good for the story and specific scenes of the show.This season is disappointing (almost as bad as Season 4):- there's no consistency in the storyline: in the first half of the season it revolves around Lana and Clark, their relationship, how they could overcome their trust issues. And in the second half of the season Lana is almost completely out of the picture. This is poor writing and leaves Lana/Clark fans (contrary to some comments, there are still some of them out there) frustrated. Regardless of writers strike or whatever, they writers can do a lot better than this.- to end the relationship between Clark and Lana (and her appearance on the show) through some video tape message is just TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE. Come on! They could at least have created one last scene between them to placate fans.- the whole story goes too far: brain interactive construct, time travels to Krypton, some device to control Kal-el, this stupid character of Kara. That's just ridiculous. I think the fortress and the voice of Jor-El, maybe some evil Kryptonians is credible in this context, but that should be enough.- if people complain about the Clark and Lana relationship, well the story about Chloe and Jimmy is far more annoying.---Yes, it is difficult to keep up the level after so many season, but Season 5 and 6 were, in my opinion, great seasons, if not the best ones.Now with only two of the main cast remaining, real Smallville fans might turn their back on the show. Instead, they should have made this 7th season the last one, with all actors still under contract, and come up with a better story to end this.Goodbye Smallville!",2,Sadly rather disappointing...,1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,1794,"['best', 'seventh', 'season', 'Smallville', 'score', 'music', 'Mark', 'Snow/Louis', 'Febre', 'who', 'composed', 'beautiful', 'emotional', 'music', 'season', 'too', 'good', 'story', 'specific', 'scenes', 'show.This', 'season', 'disappointing', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'Season', '4', 'consistency', 'storyline', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'Lana', 'Clark', 'relationship', 'how', 'could', 'overcome', 'trust', 'issues', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'Lana', 'almost', 'completely', 'picture', 'poor', 'writing', 'Lana/Clark', 'fans', 'contrary', 'comments', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'frustrated', 'Regardless', 'writers', 'strike', 'whatever', 'writers', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'better', 'this.-', 'end', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'appearance', 'show', 'video', 'tape', 'message', 'just', 'TOTALLY', 'INAPPROPRIATE', 'Come', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'created', 'one', 'last', 'scene', 'placate', 'fans.-', 'whole', 'story', 'too', 'far', 'brain', 'interactive', 'construct', 'time', 'travels', 'Krypton', 'device', 'control', 'Kal-el', 'stupid', 'character', 'Kara', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'think', 'fortress', 'voice', 'Jor-El', 'maybe', 'evil', 'Kryptonians', 'credible', 'context', 'should', 'be', 'enough.-', 'people', 'complain', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'relationship', 'well', 'story', 'Chloe', 'Jimmy', 'far', 'more', 'annoying.', '-Yes', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'level', 'so', 'many', 'season', 'Season', '5', '6', 'were', 'opinion', 'great', 'seasons', 'not', 'best', 'ones.Now', 'only', 'two', 'main', 'cast', 'remaining', 'real', 'Smallville', 'fans', 'might', 'turn', 'back', 'show', 'Instead', 'should', 'have', 'made', '7th', 'season', 'last', 'one', 'actors', 'still', 'contract', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'story', 'end', 'this.Goodbye', 'Smallville']",N/A

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","Kicking the season off, Clark fights a bizarro version of himself, picking up the cliffhanger from the previous season. Great start. Then things get even more cool with the emergence of a super . . . girl? Yup, you guessed it, Supergirl herself has arrived on Earth. Her name is Kara. She is Clark's cousin from Krypton and Laura Vandervoort does a fantastic job as the Girl of Steel, who not only proves that blood runs thicker than water, but also has no fear of heights like her farmboy cousin and does plenty of flying to prove it.Not only is there one Supergirl in this season, but two. Kinda. Helen Slater, who played Supergirl in the 1984 movie of the same name, made an appearance as Clark's Kryptonian mother, Lara, in the episode that shared her namesake.Season Seven was a load of fun and was one of the best ones of the series so far.The only episode I didn't really like was ""Wrath,"" where Lana gets Clarks powers and uses them to get her revenge on Lex. Again, this kind of thing was done before in Lois and Clark (the power transfer), and I was getting tired of seeing these repeat ideas as they had done Lois and Clark-type episodes in the past. Speaking of which, the Dean Cain episode, ""Cure,"" made me feel like I was watching Lois and Clark all over again and though this episode was more filler than moved the Season Seven story arc along, it was cool to see Dean Cain back in the Superman universe. They even called his character Curtis Knox (see the initials?).The last thing that bothered me about this season, more specifically the episode, ""Quest,"" was the major playing up of Clark being some sort of messiah. I'm a Christian, so this probably bothered me more than most, but that aside, it still was overdone. Okay. We get it. Clark's going to save the world one day.

""Bizarro"" wasn't the strong season opener that I was expecting like ""Zod"" in season 6.Season 7's highlights include the arrival of Kara (Supergirl), Clark meeting his biological mother Lara (Helen Slater who played Supergirl in the movie), the introduction of blue kryptonite, a showdown between Bizarro and Clark, the return of Pete Ross, and my favorite part: the return of Milton Fine.In the comics, blue kryptonite doesn't affect Clark at all. But it weakens Bizarro the way that green K affects Clark. So I was confused when I saw that blue K took away Clark's powers. Then later I learned that blue K destroyed Bizarro. (Everything affects them in opposite ways. If blue K takes away Clark's abilities, it will increase Bizarro's powers exponentially until he explodes.)My favorite part of season 7 was the return of Milton Fine. I first read about this on a Smallville fansite. I couldn't figure out how it was possible since every copy of him was destroyed. But I forgot about the black box that Zod was going to use. It turned into a pile of ashes in season 6 (long story), then it liquified and evolved back into Fine.Here are the episodes in season 7:1. Bizarro2. Kara3. Fierce4. Cure5. Action6. Lara7. Wrath8.

1113371,A370IMNDMNP54G,B000X5SMXY,bytheway,"[7, 31]","I made the mistake of buying all the first six seasons on DVD because I watched a few random inconsecutive episodes at someone else's house and thought that I'd like it since I normally like Superhero movies. I wish I'd never bought them. First of all, almost every single character on Smallville has ethical problems. Clark Kent is so determined to keep his powers secret that he becomes a compulsive liar and goes as far as to hurt all the people closest to him, including the love of his life, Lana Lang. Lana starts out in the earlier seasons as a character who is more honest and sincere than Clark, and by season six she turns into the money grubbing opportunistic and shallow wife of evil sadist Lex Luthor. Lex starts out the earlier seasons trying to be good, and is initally Clark Kent's best freind. Clark's freindship with Lex frequently compromises his moral judgement and often the so-called ""hero"" Clark even goes as far as engaging in actions that empower Lex and his father Lionel to do evil things, and the worst part is, he knows it but claims it's not his place to stop Lex or his father from the broader evil agenda they have- but rather only intervene in indivdual acts of evil without addressing Lex and Lionel's broader pattern of behavior or the threat thier actions have to society at large. Lionel Luther at one point captures Clark Kent and puts him in a tub of liquid kryptonite, at another point hires a mobster to take Clark and his entire family hostage- and yet Martha Kent finds it in her heart not only to forgive Lionel for these things in later episodes- but to go beyond that and have an affair with him after her husband Jonathan dies of a heart attack that takes place as a direct result of a conversation with guess who? Lionel. Virtually all of the characters of Smallville at some point in time do something evil- even the so-called ""good guys"", which makes it a bad show in my opinion. A superhero show is supposed to be designed to teach the audience the difference between right and wrong. Smallville does not accomplish that goal. Clark's lies alienate not only Lana, but they seem to be part of the series of events that turns Lex Luthor from a person who wants to be a good person but tends to fail in that goal, to a person who chooses not to be good and revels in his evil. From watching all the first six seasons this transition from a ""morally challenged"" Lex to a downright evil and sadistic Lex unravels simultaneously as the trust between Clark and Lex unravels. Lex lies to Clark for years as he has Clark investigated, followed, and practically stalked. But throughout the series it is apparent that Clark is as much to blame for this as Lex since, if they were supposedly true freinds at any point, Clark could have been honest with Lex, Chloe, Lana, and his other inner circle friends and then none of them would have had anything to wonder about in the first place. So it's clear that although Lex is definitely the most evil character in the series, Clark has almost as much culpability in Lex's evolution into an evil character as Lex's father, Lionel has for his role in turning his son into a monster. Lionel of course is the person who taught Lex to be ruthless and vengeful, and though in later episodes he seems at points to be regretful of that, he never really does much to change Lex's direction in life, other than to occasionally help people who are trying to stop Lex from doing evil things. But it would have been better if Lionel could've just convinced Lex to stop being evil or done whatever it took to neutralize Lex if changing Lex was impossible. One of the more ludicrous moments in the show is when Clark faces an evil alien plant-woman who escaped from a prison planet she'd been sent to by Jor-El because she had destroyed entire planets. After she tells Clark her goal is to wipe out the human race and all civilization as we know it- Clark politely asks her to leave Earth voluntarily. Of course she refuses and the fight with Clark that ensues leads to her demise, but what made that scene so ridiculous is that the alien plant woman had already murdered innocent people and expressed her intention to destroy the earth- and Clark thought politely asking her to leave would get to her to go away voluntarily. There is a big difference between innocent naivety and blatant stupidity. Clark has lots of moments like these in Smallville, and often those moments work to the advantage of Lex Luthor and some of the other villians who emerge in the show. Instead of developing a Superman character people can respect and admire, Smallville portrays Superman as a selfish liar whose choices frequently lead to disasters. Many of his so-called heroics are in the context of cleaning up situations of his own making, and though he is willing to put himself at risk at times to help people, he makes protecting his secret identity as important a priority as saving lives. I'm sorry, but Spiderman puts saving people first, even ahead of protecting his identity. That is what a superhero should do, and the Clark Kent of Smallville is nowhere near as selfless as Spider Man (going by the Spider Man movies since I've never read the comics). In Spider Man 2, Spider Man allows his identity to be seen by an entire subway car full of people in order to save their lives- but after watching 6 seasons of Smallville, I don't think the Smallville Clark Kent would do the same. Which makes the series Smallville a total dissapointment. I would not reccomend watching this series because the disappointing choices made by its characters show only that NONE of them know the difference between right and wrong, and NONE of them are as selfless as the superheroes we expect in movies or comics. It's one thing for a superhero to be flawed, and to sometimes make mistakes. But on Smallville, everyone from Clark Kent and his family to Lex Luthor and his family is not just flawed- they all have a very warped sense of what justice is and what their obligatons to their loved ones as well as the world around them are. I grew up on old-school superhero cartoons in the 80s where all the ""good guys"" really had something to teach the audience about the difference between right and wrong, and I've come to expect the superhero genre to do that, and this show doesn't do that. All of the characters are as deceptive as any soap opera, so this show is I guess, more of a soap opera, than a superhero show.",1,I thought I'd like this series but I was wrong,1215302400,"07 6,

I love this show! But over all this season was a disappointment, and there are some episodes I'd like to forget.Lana and Clark's story, whether you like it or not, has been a major part (and draw) of the series and this year it took a very anti-climatic, bizarre, and out of character turn. Fans and detractors of the relationship alike were bitterly disappointed.The addition of Kara (Laura Vandervoort) may have thrilled some comic book fans (and those who enjoy a lot of cleavage) but her story added very little to Smallville and actually distracted from other more interesting plot-lines. The WEAKEST episodes of the season featured Kara. Vandervoort is no doubt cute in her short shorts, but her acting skills really left something to be desired.However, the most irritating thing about the addition of ""Super-Barbie"" was that she came in and FLEW before Clark. That had to have been one of the STUPIDEST decisions every made by TPTB on this show. Clark flying some day is a highly anticipated HUGE event... which has now been totally diluted.Smallville over all has been an amazing show and given what has come before, I guess I have high expectations. But, even though this season was not up to par, I never once considered missing it, and will certainly buy the DVDs of season 7 to add to my collection.On another note, Supernatural, which follows Smallville on the CW, absolutely ROCKED this season.

Ekstrom ""dgekstrom""","[8, 12]","Anyone who bothers to read this review pertaining to Smallville, will no doubt notice how I tend to nit pick at the moments within this season that had failed to meet my expectations. While I will certainly touch on such subject matters, overall the seventh season has managed to rekindle that fire that I had once thought I lost.Now most people(including me)will argue that Smallville probably should have wrapped things up a few seasons ago. Throughout the course of the past six seasons, I was most agitated over how the writers would find Clark excuse after excuse on why he shouldn't leave Smallville.  Unfortunately, the seventh season is no stranger to that rule.Just when we think there couldn't possibly be anything else in Smallville for Clark to cling to, we find that Kara(Supergirl)has joined the cast. And it just so happens that Jor-El's first assignment for Clark is for him to look after Kara whom just so happened to be residing in(wait for it..........................................................)Smallville.Nagging issues aside, let's get to the good stuff. While it was certainly entertaining to see the return of Brainiac, I would like to think that most people will agree with me when I say that it was watching Lex Luthor FINALLY achieve #1 villain status that was by far the season's best highlight.  It's just too bad that this will be Michael Rosenbaum's last season. But alas it makes sense since this now established ""villainous"" Lex Luthor belongs in Metropolis.Another actor, or should I say actress, to part ways this season will be Kristen Kreuk(Lana Lang). Now I'm not overjoyed by any means, but I certainly won't be shedding a tear over the loss of this character. Because quite frankly, the writers seemed to run out of ideas for Lana after season three(maybe two?). She was on/off again too many times with Clark to remember. One season she was a witch, and another she's marrying Lex. Her entire tale was rather confusing(or dare I say ridiculous?). It was just unfortunate that the character Lana Lang never really had an established niche within the seriesThis season's most pressing issue however, is that Lex may have the means to control Clark with a device that could lead to humanity's destruction. But those concerns diminish rather quickly when Brainiac kidnaps Kara and attacks Lana. So it's understandable(though not entirely acceptable)that a Clark hell bent on revenge would allow the dangers that Lex posses fall by the wayside.Also in typical Smallville fashion, you will find plenty of episodes that are sprinkled throughout the season that completely detract from the overall plot.  Being a fan of such shows as ""24"", ""Lost"", ""Prison Break"" etc, I've been rather spoiled in expecting every episode to touch base on the overall goal of that particular season.  With the writer's strike looming over the course of the seventh season, it was understandable how certain story arcs never really took off(""Gabriel"" for example), but no less makes it excusable.With season eight ""supposedly"" being Smallville's last, the most prevalent questions will(hopefully)be answered. The most notable being(at least for me), ""How will those that know Clark as he is now, still manage to confuse him for Superman?"" I mean, does he go around ""frenching"" everyone with that amnesia kiss of his?Either way, I'm looking forward to season eight. I just hope the writers are able to wrap up the loose ends they have created for themselves in this alternate tale of Superman.",5,A return to form,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,3510,"['Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'review', 'pertaining', 'Smallville', 'will', 'doubt', 'how', 'tend', 'nit', 'pick', 'moments', 'season', 'had', 'failed', 'meet', 'expectations', 'will', 'certainly', 'touch', 'such', 'subject', 'matters', 'seventh', 'season', 'managed', 'rekindle', 'fire', 'had', 'once', 'thought', 'lost.Now', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'will', 'argue', 'Smallville', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'wrapped', 'things', 'up', 'few', 'seasons', 'ago', 'course', 'past', 'six', 'seasons', 'was', 'most', 'agitated', 'how', 'writers', 'would', 'find', 'Clark', 'excuse', 'excuse', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Smallville', 'Unfortunately', 'seventh', 'season', 'stranger', 'rule.Just', 'when', 'think', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'anything', 'else', 'Smallville', 'Clark', 'cling', 'find', 'Kara', 'Supergirl', 'joined', 'cast', 'just', 'so', 'Jor-El', 'first', 'assignment', 'Clark', 'look', 'Kara', 'whom', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'be', 'residing', 'wait', 'Smallville.Nagging', 'issues', 'aside', 'let', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'was', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'see', 'return', 'Brainiac', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'agree', 'when', 'say', 'was', 'watching', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'FINALLY', 'achieve', '1', 'villain', 'status', 'was', 'far', 'season', 'best', 'highlight', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'will', 'be', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'last', 'season', 'sense', 'now', 'established', 'villainous', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Metropolis.Another', 'actor', 'should', 'say', 'actress', 'part', 'ways', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'overjoyed', 'means', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'shedding', 'tear', 'loss', 'character', 'quite', 'frankly', 'writers', 'seemed', 'run', 'out', 'ideas', 'Lana', 'season', 'three', 'maybe', 'two', 'was', 'on/off', 'again', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Clark', 'remember', 'One', 'season', 'was', 'witch', 'marrying', 'Lex', 'entire', 'tale', 'was', 'rather', 'confusing', 'dare', 'say', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'character', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'established', 'niche', 'seriesThis', 'season', 'most', 'pressing', 'issue', 'however', 'Lex', 'may', 'have', 'means', 'control', 'Clark', 'device', 'could', 'lead', 'humanity', 'destruction', 'concerns', 'diminish', 'rather', 'quickly', 'when', 'Brainiac', 'Kara', 'attacks', 'Lana', 'understandable', 'not', 'entirely', 'acceptable', 'Clark', 'hell', 'bent', 'revenge', 'would', 'allow', 'dangers', 'Lex', 'fall', 'wayside.Also', 'typical', 'Smallville', 'fashion', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'episodes', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'season', 'completely', 'detract', 'overall', 'plot', 'Being', 'fan', 'such', 'shows', '24', 'Lost', 'Prison', 'Break', 'etc', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rather', 'spoiled', 'expecting', 'episode', 'touch', 'base', 'overall', 'goal', 'particular', 'season', 'writer', 'strike', 'looming', 'course', 'seventh', 'season', 'was', 'understandable', 'how', 'certain', 'story', 'arcs', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'Gabriel', 'example', 'less', 'season', 'eight', 'supposedly', 'being', 'Smallville', 'last', 'most', 'prevalent', 'questions', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'answered', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'least', 'How', 'will', 'know', 'Clark', 'now', 'still', 'manage', 'confuse', 'Superman', 'mean', 'go', 'frenching', 'everyone', 'amnesia', 'kiss', 'way', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'season', 'eight', 'just', 'hope', 'writers', 'are', 'able', 'wrap', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'have', 'created', 'alternate', 'tale', 'Superman']",N/A

To me, the show peaked with the seventh season episode ""Apocalypse"" where we saw the world without Superman and peeked into the world of the modern Superman comic books.I suppose there's no point in going through the episode details because if you're buying this you surely know most of that.  So, focusing on the Blu-Ray version... the menu system is gone.  We've seen this on Blu-Ray movies where it just plays the movie upon loading the disc.  Same here.  Loading the disc just starts playing the episodes.  Pressing the menu button does not bring up the list of episodes, and is used only to allow access to special features.Since the episodes themselves do not contain title cards and the printed insert does not include a chapter key - you're on your own trying to use the skip buttons to find episodes on the disc.Part of why I buy the box sets is to be able to find a particular favorite episode to watch - not to watch the whole series in chronological order again.  So, needless to say the menu design is severely flawed for a box set of this type.Also, there are just three discs in the box for the entire season of 20 episodes.  Therefore the HD, although still good looking, by necessity is at a lower bit rate quality than the Blu-Ray format can deliver.  The season six set had 22 episodes on four discs.I'm hoping that Clark will actually fly in season 8.

This is a thoroughly enjoyable season, for all its wildness.  The characters and associating actors are wonderful and comfortable in their roles (as well they should be by now) and there seems to be no end to the possible storylines.  Even the recycling of characters and plot twists are appreciated, just because they are done with so much heart.  Indeed, there is a good blend of fun/silly and absolute drama here. It's a fine blend.Frankly, if madcap superhero drama/melodrama/angst/goofiness bothers you, you probably would not be this far into the series.

1113391,A212BN81DP6FRI,B000X5SMXY,freelancer26,"[1, 1]","I am completely baffled by fans who keep whining about the departure of Lana Lang from this show and the actress who played her. And, I am annoyed by those same fans who keep harping about Erica Durance. To those, I simply say: Get a life! This show was reborn for the better in season 4 when Erica Durance joined the cast as Lois Lane. She has chemistry with every guy she's been paired up with on the show - especially, Tom Welling. Need I remind anyone of the depressing darkness of the first three seasons - especially the third season?! This is supposed to be the coming of age story of Superman - not some Marvel Comics creation or even Batman! Superman is supposed to be lighter and more ethereal - he is the greatest male superhero that's ever been created. Warner Bros. TV President Peter Roth made a mistake when he hired Gough/Millar to helm his idea for a Superman series. Their vision (or lack there of) for the show was foolishly limited. They rigidly hung on to the stupidity that Clark's true love is lana and to them, Lois is just a rebound, an afterthought, someone Clark ends up with only because lana leaves him. About 60% of the time, their handeling of the stories was amateur, idiotic and boring. Further examples of their moronic thinking was creating a shrumpy, meddling geek to serve as Clark's brain (because the last son of the most advanced civilization in the universe can't put two and two together if his life depended on it) and turning the one voice of pure reason, Jor-El (Superman's brilliant, loving father who sacrificed everything to save him) into the villain of all villains. Lana Lang was NEVER supposed to be this huge of a part in Clark's life. And, sorry, but the actress who played this insanely obnoxious character and Tom Welling's interaction with each other, though acceptable enough, was feeble and very pale in comparison to his wild fire calibered chemistry with Durance. Lang should have been phased out in season 6 and only been in a few episodes of season 7 - and not returned at all for season 8. Erica Durance should have been in all 22 episodes of the last two seasons. It's absolutely ridiculous that this show in the stage that's in is still not granting Lois Lane leading lady status and yet for another long season, granting the fabricated chloe sullivan(allison mack) more money and a bigger part in the Superman lore. Loyalty is a good thing but not at the very considerable expense of sacrificing the excellence of the classic Superman story. I loved that they introduced Lois Lane when they did but once they intoduced her, they should given her her rightful place second only to Clark Kent within the storyline. Instead, they settled for hum drum ratings in keeping the story stagnant and every time they took one step forward, they'd take two steps backward. The only reason why I keep watching this show is because of Erica Durance. She seems to be the only genuine Superman fan among anyone involved with this show. Laura Vandervoort who played Supergirl also deserves kudos - and an apology from the producers for totally underutilizing her  - she was yet another tragic casualty of the Lana/Chloe imposition. Mr. Roth finally came to his senses when he fired the Goughlar beast. Tragically though, the beast's disciples were left in charge and they unleashed the mother of all assanine craploads right in the middle of season 8 after lulling Superman fans into thinking Smallville's Clark had finally grown a pair. Oh, how I hope that with the shedding of all but two of the show's producers, the two remaining will man up and just go for it, lift the series out of its dulldrums for season 9, kill off chloe, give Erica/Lois her rightful place and make Clark finally stop whining like a Hamlet on drugs!!DVD Features:1.

1113392,A23ZTX5UAU59TF,B000X5SMXY,game lover,"[0, 0]","As a lifelong aficionado of all things Superman, I was greatly intrigued by this series from the very beginning, but often puzzled by the dichotomy between the traditional tales from the old DC comic books and this new re-imagining of that universe. Some things, although somewhat different, seem right on the money to me, or more or less so, while others make me feel like I need to step back and take a deep breath for them to make sense to me. For example, in the old comics, Clark Kent's life had a beginning chapter in Smallville, where he was involved with the demure, cornfed, all-American blonde Lana Lang. Later his destiny beckoned him to Metropolis, where he was to meet the more sophisticated city girl named Lois Lane, who would become his new main squeeze. This, until now, was the gospel.Now, however, both phases of his life become more intricately intermeshed without any clean break between the two, and we have both Lana Lang and Lois Lane in Clark's life at the same time. Furthermore, it can't be denied that we have a deep emotional investment in the love between Clark and Lana after watching it slowly unfold over seven seasons. For crying out loud, she even got seemingly killed off at one point and then was miraculously resurrected! After all that, do we really want to see them break up just so he can fulfill his supposed, traditional destiny with Lois Lane? This appears to be what the writers are pushing, but frankly the romantic chemistry between Clark and Lois seems rather contrived at best.Over all 7 past seasons, we have seen this Lana Lang evolve into something altogether new -- a swashbuckling, butt-kicking, Lex-Luthor-marrying firebrand vixen! (Thank goodness, she dumped Luthor.) Yet she still seems just as delicate and feminine, with the same cute, girlish pout. In my opinion, it would be nice if Clark and Lana's relationship continues to develop, since, ahem, one fantasizes (OK, I fantasize) about, well, BEING Clark Kent and having the love of such a beautiful and interesting woman, even if she is a bit headstrong and impulsive. That just adds to her charm! [Is it hot in here? Ladies and gentlemen, I'm blushing!  :-)]Say, while we're at it, why not get Lois Lane and Oliver Queen (aka Green Arrow) back together? She seems to think he's a hunk and let's face it -- they looked pretty happy together, so why fight it? Just a thought...I do read other reviews, so I am well aware that not everyone who watches this show is as crazy for the Lana Lang character as I am! Some tend to be put off by her occasional whining and melodramatic tantrums. Others, like me, am okay with that but feel a bit disappointed by the fact that when Clark and Lana are in bed together, it looks almost like they're just having some sort of a pajama party! [We've come a long way to get to this point, so some of us want very badly to see what kind of a wildcat she is in the sack! ;-)]  However, I believe her popularity is such that when fans heard about her imminent departure at the end of Season 7, they rose up as one and demanded that the producers do whatever it might take to persuade the lovely Kristin Kreuk to reprise her role (even if it meant tripling her salary, heh heh).But seriously folks, I'm sure we can all agree that it's nice to see the series expand its horizons and explore some new uncharted territory. What is really going on at the fortress anyway exactly, and what happened to Jor-El? Is Lex Luthor still out there, and if so, what new evil deeds could he have up his sleeve that could possibly top the ones he has already committed? In the meantime, we just have to be satisfied with his apparent stand-in of the moment, the redoubtable Tess Mercer, who also can be quite chilling herself but does not seem to be quite in the same league as Lex when it comes to pure unadulterated evil (er, just kidding Tess, heh heh).While we are on this topic, the Lex Luthor we have come to know here is definitely a far more complex animal than the one we knew in the comics or the movies, or in ""Lois & Clark"". Here we actually see him as a friend of Clark's for quite some time, until things gradually begin to sour, mainly due to Lex's insatiable lust for power (and perhaps his rivalry with Clark for the affections of Lana Lang). Michael Rosenbaum's impersonation of Lex has to be the most chilling we have ever known. So will we have the dubious pleasure of seeing him again after his disappearance at the conclusion of Season 7? (He certainly made a grand exit, vanishing after a titanic confrontation with Clark at the fortress, where he was trying to usurp Clark's powers.)It appears that with the reins of the show now totally in the hands of the writers, all hell has broken loose and we have some really suspenseful plotlines going on, for better or worse.  Although some of the latest plot developments may be quite unsettling and unpredictable, we are never bored, and sometimes life is indeed just like that. Some really original things are being presented to us, including some dark dimensions that were never explored in the ""Lois & Clark"" series from the 90s, which was more faithful to the original saga but also much more predictable. We may feel a bit unnerved by all this at times, but there never is a dull moment.EPILOGUE (July 2009)The writers are really trying to pull it together without Lana Lang or even Lex Luthor, and they seem to be doing quite a bit of tap dancing, limping along in fits and starts. The most fun characters in the whole show are basically gone! And what happened to that hot Supergirl character (Kara)? Instead, what do we have-- just the villainess Tess Mercer as a rather lame stand-in for Lex, and this incredibly dreary ""Zod"" character, who is far too one-dimensional in his behavior to really be of much interest. Honestly, he reminds me of the ""Geico gecko"" having a bad hair day! In the old Superman comics from which this show was supposedly derived, the Kandorians, Zor-El, and so on were smart, fun people and not the nasty, psychopathic villains this show turns them into -- in fact they were heroes who tried to save their planet's people from destruction! Frankly, I am not too sure where things are headed for this show -- it's becoming a little too dark in tone even for my taste, and I like weird shows! We will have to see what develops...P.S. Now if I want to get my dose of Kristin Kreuk's pretty pout, I have to watch lame episodes of ""Chuck"".

There were new characters & mini arcs this season that were actually to do with the mithos & although some worked (Veritas, Bizzaro, BRAINiac) others didn't (Laura-Zor-El). Although the worst of them has to be the Julian clone plot which rightfully was finished as soon as it started & was never mentioned by anyone again (Even Lois eventhough he was her ex-boyfriend?)What really dragged this season down was the unnecessary soap opera romance rubbish the obvious Clark/Lana. I was actually looking forward to an actual honest to God talk between these two characters this season but all be learned was that Lana has the personality of a cardboard cutout & Clark is an idiot & that wasn't something we already didn't know.But worse of all (yes worser than Clana) was the Jimmy & Chloe relationship that's basically been forced upon us so much that I'm actually starting to hate Jimmy with the same verocity as I do Lana. And if you want to see how easy it is to hate Jimmy just check out Sleeper cos that is what the title says.But unlike Season 6 which was mainly Soap Opera rubbish, Season 7 at least as I stated earlier tried to offer some alternatives but these were either poorly executed (Laura, Zor-El) stupid (Lex gets shot in the head & survives via a device that you'd also see on the cartoon Superfriends) and dissapointing (Brainiac, it admittingly had its moments but at the end crashed to a dissapointing end, but more on that later).The Season did start of well though Bizzaro & Kara were excellent episodes but Kara the character herself didn't really serve no real purpose to the show alot of the time except for looking nice & the next few were just riducilous & pointless episodes about this fact. Although she was awesome when she came back in Traveller.Jor-El is still an a-hole & freezes Clark for no real reason before Bizzaro comes back makes love to Lana dies in the most stupid way before we get for a change some decent drama from Clark & Lana although a few episodes later they are all lovey dovey, until...VERITASThis is one of the best episodes of this season & one of Smallville's best for ages. It follows on from the excellent Traveller episode where we learn than Lionel & a few others knew of Clark's arrival & years before he landed on Earth were waiting for him. This episodes makes some compelling discoveries about characters & motivations, especially Lionel & I'll admit the episode he dies in Descent although dissapointing wasn't bad at all but this was enough to actually convince that after 3 & a half years Smallville was back on track but low & behold...THE ENDINGDiscluding Apocolypse which was an ok episode but still had nothing to do with anything except false forshadowing & fan service. The episodes Sleeper, Quest & Arctic have to go down as some of the worst Smallville episodes ever.First there's Sleeper, which I've already explained earlier, then there's Quest where Robert Picardo of Star Trek Voyager fame plays Jason Teague who for some reason wants to kill Clark cos he didn't kill Lex even though Clark according to him is our last hope??? Oh whatever.But then there's Arctic which wraps up all the great stuff that was started off in the Traveller, Veritas & Descent trilogy in one of the most ugliest & terrible yet stupid ways possible. I was most tempted to cut those 3 earlier episodes grades just cos of the mess it caused but making these out to not be great because of some hack writers (Strike or no Strike) just wouldn't be fair.",2,Well at least it's a BIT better than Season 6.,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,4217,"['Please', 'feel', 'free', 'leave', 'comment', 'review', 'will', 'respond', 'well', 'interlectual', 'course', 'start', 'review', ""'m"", 'just', 'gon', 'na', 'give', 'episode', 'grade', '1', 'being', 'lowest', '5', 'highest.Bizzaro', '5Kara', '5Fierce', '1Cure', '1Action', '1Lara', '2Wrath', '2Blue', '2Gemini', '2Persona', '3Siren', '1Fracture', '1Hero', '1Traveler', '4', '1/2Veritas', '5Descent', '3Sleeper', '1Apocolypse', '3Quest', '1Arctic', '1or', ""that's5x34"", '1/2', 'x13x32x41x9Season', 'Average=', '2.275OK', 'begin', 'season', 'was', 'better', 'Season', '6', 'just', 'what', 'let', 'down', 'big', 'time', 'was', 'way', 'season', 'ended', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'not', 'only', 'Smallville', 'worst', 'ever', 'season', 'finales', 'one', 'worst', 'television', 'ever', 'more', 'later.First', 'good', 'were', 'new', 'characters', 'mini', 'arcs', 'season', 'were', 'actually', 'do', 'mithos', 'worked', 'Veritas', 'Bizzaro', 'BRAINiac', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'Laura-Zor-El', 'worst', 'be', 'Julian', 'clone', 'plot', 'rightfully', 'was', 'finished', 'as', 'soon', 'started', 'was', 'never', 'mentioned', 'anyone', 'again', 'Even', 'Lois', 'was', 'ex-boyfriend', 'What', 'really', 'dragged', 'season', 'down', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'soap', 'opera', 'romance', 'rubbish', 'obvious', 'Clark/Lana', 'was', 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'actual', 'honest', 'God', 'talk', 'two', 'characters', 'season', 'be', 'learned', 'was', 'Lana', 'personality', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'Clark', 'idiot', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'already', 'did', ""n't"", 'know.But', 'worse', 'yes', 'worser', 'Clana', 'was', 'Jimmy', 'Chloe', 'relationship', 'basically', 'been', 'forced', 'so', 'much', ""'m"", 'actually', 'starting', 'hate', 'Jimmy', 'same', 'verocity', 'do', 'Lana', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'easy', 'hate', 'Jimmy', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'Sleeper', 'cos', 'what', 'title', 'says.But', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'mainly', 'Soap', 'Opera', 'rubbish', 'Season', '7', 'least', 'stated', 'earlier', 'tried', 'offer', 'alternatives', 'were', 'either', 'poorly', 'executed', 'Laura', 'Zor-El', 'stupid', 'Lex', 'shot', 'head', 'device', ""'d"", 'also', 'see', 'cartoon', 'Superfriends', 'dissapointing', 'Brainiac', 'admittingly', 'had', 'moments', 'end', 'crashed', 'dissapointing', 'end', 'more', 'later', '.The', 'Season', 'did', 'start', 'well', 'Bizzaro', 'Kara', 'were', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'Kara', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'serve', 'real', 'purpose', 'show', 'alot', 'time', 'looking', 'nice', 'next', 'few', 'were', 'just', 'riducilous', 'pointless', 'episodes', 'fact', 'was', 'awesome', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'Traveller.Jor-El', 'still', 'a-hole', 'Clark', 'real', 'reason', 'Bizzaro', 'back', 'love', 'Lana', 'dies', 'most', 'stupid', 'way', 'get', 'change', 'decent', 'drama', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'few', 'episodes', 'later', 'are', 'lovey', 'dovey', 'VERITASThis', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'Smallville', 'best', 'ages', 'excellent', 'Traveller', 'episode', 'where', 'learn', 'Lionel', 'few', 'others', 'knew', 'Clark', 'arrival', 'years', 'landed', 'Earth', 'were', 'waiting', 'compelling', 'discoveries', 'characters', 'motivations', 'especially', 'Lionel', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'episode', 'Descent', 'dissapointing', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', 'enough', 'actually', 'convince', '3', 'half', 'years', 'Smallville', 'was', 'back', 'track', 'low', 'behold', 'THE', 'ENDINGDiscluding', 'Apocolypse', 'was', 'ok', 'episode', 'still', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'false', 'forshadowing', 'fan', 'service', 'episodes', 'Sleeper', 'Quest', 'Arctic', 'have', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'worst', 'Smallville', 'ever.First', 'Sleeper', ""'ve"", 'already', 'explained', 'earlier', 'then', 'Quest', 'where', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'fame', 'Jason', 'Teague', 'who', 'reason', 'kill', 'Clark', 'cos', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Lex', 'even', 'Clark', 'according', 'last', 'hope', 'Oh', 'whatever.But', 'then', 'Arctic', 'up', 'great', 'stuff', 'was', 'started', 'off', 'Traveller', 'Veritas', 'Descent', 'trilogy', 'one', 'most', 'ugliest', 'terrible', 'yet', 'stupid', 'ways', 'possible', 'was', 'most', 'tempted', 'cut', '3', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'grades', 'just', 'cos', 'mess', 'caused', 'making', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'hack', 'writers', 'Strike', 'Strike', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair']",N/A
1113394,A1D7H91Q4WAHIM,B000X5SMXY,Ghostman,"[0, 0]","As entertaining as I found Season 7, the writing just isn't as tight and cohesive as Season 6.Granted, Smallville's a science fiction series, and such genre is afforded some leeway when it comes to loose ends and plot holes, but no other season has come off so blatant and clumsy with its execution.I'm not gonna gripe about everything, as it would take forever. Rather, I'll just touch up on some of the season's stumbles that really weaken the quality of the series.The first criticism I wished to address is the return of Sam Jones aka Pete Ross. I don't know why he left the show to start, but I assumed he was the token black actor, and when the demographic studies weren't drawing the desired urban fan following, they dropped him with reckless abandon. The way he exited from the show was nothing short of hysterical.And what'ya know, his return was on par with the absurdity of his exit. When Pete reemerged, I thought, ""Wow, they brought back Sam Jones."" That fanboy excitement was shortlived however, and I was disappointed to find that it was just a special guest appearance. On top of that, Clark seemed more surprised, than elated by Pete's return, and Chloe was not particulary jumping for joy either. Despite the fact that they used to be Smallville's version of the Three Musketeers, the script and acting just didn't sell it. These were not the reactions conducive of a titanic reunion. The episode's delivery failed to match the level of fans' salivation and anticipation of Pete's grand return.Another issue I wished to address, was Lana's degeneration of innocence and eventual departure from the show. If I had known how they would phase her out of the series, I would've preferred that she had just died in the vehicular explosion. That could've at least left us fans lamenting, ""What if?"" and ""That relationship was too good to be true.""Unfortunately, the writers took a different route. It was almost like they didn't want to reject us fans of the Clark/Lana romance that no longer posed any obstacles in between them. Instead, they corrupted Lana and compromised her character with deceit and darkness. The writers had metamorphosized Lana into a shell of her former self, with Clark drowning himself with the thematic Frankenstein guilt trip of feeling responsible for the creation of the reinvented Lana. Furthermore, the relationship between Clark and Lana that had been brewing for seven exhilarating seasons, went out with not so much as a bang, but a whimper. Deep, poetic, tragic, of all the adjectives it could've been used to describe their love story, the most fitting would be anti-climactic. An atrocious cop-out to what should've been an epic finale.Besides those two arcs, the season was mired by devastating plot holes. For instance, whatever happened to the Justice League? When Clark seemed to be in trouble, you had to wonder why he was not seeking the help of the anti-Lex Oliver Queen. And while Lex is devising a plan to take over the world, where on Earth is Oliver anyway? Not only has he swore to protect the greater cause of the world, but he's the only person with the resources to stop his arch-nemesis Lex. What could rank higher on Oliver's checklist of humanitarian priorities, than say, thwarting the next Holocaust?Equally significant are the countless instances, where the characters behave contrived and lead you to wonder, ""Why would he/she do that?"" For example, when Clark strangely refuses to jog Kara's amnesic memory with her Krytonian ancestry, and in turn, endangers his secret and Kara's safety, as Lex lures her into his trap.Other moments include Clark's furious refusal to take Lionel's locket, which essentially sets up the season finale with a cliffhanger that could've otherwise been averted. Additionally, when Clark is informed of the two keys that unlock the Smallville equivalent of the ""One Ring,"" he does little to search for them.This leads to another problem - the loss of personality in Clark Kent. Granted, he never had much personality to begin with, but in this season, he was like an android going through the motions, or an artificial plot tool to serve the bigger picture.Finally, the DDS episode, where Jimmy Olsen cooperated with the government to unleash his inner Bond, was kind of fun from a popcorn-entertainment standpoint, but truly a terror from a quality-of-writing perspective. I honestly can't think of another episode, where the script was that goofy. I don't know who was the Brainiac behind that one, but it was just one of many remnants, of a slapdashed season.Of course, Season 7 is still tons of fun. It's as fastpaced as Season 6. The amount of ideas and angles they conjured up for this season, is quite astonishing. Unfortunately, it's not about the quantity for me, so much as it's the quality of the script. The season simply felt rushed. When the writers thought they had a novel idea, they failed to evaluate its competence or consequences, and instead just ran with it and hoped everything would come together in the end. Smallville is known for its clever reinvention to the Superman mythology, but it's also known for its execution of these concepts. And in Season 7, what could've turned out deep and brilliant, is relegated to nothing more than a superficial, cheap thrill.",4,"Entertaining, but too many plot holes",1235952000,"03 2,

Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe seventh season of ""Smallville"" is not quite all over the place in terms of quality, but it still does not quite have the same spark as many previous seasons.  This season was also truncated by the writers' strike of a few years ago.  Despite all of this, there are some golden nuggets in this set.One of these is ""Persona,"" in which James Marsters makes a return to the series as Milton Fine/Brainiac.  The episode also features Marc McClure, Jimmy Olsen from Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"" films, as a de-powered former Kryptonian scientist trying to live a normal life as a human being.  The concept works surprisingly well.  I was impressed with Mr. McClure's acting, and was happy to see him on ""Smallville.""  Another amazing episode is ""Traveler,"" in which a secret strike team captures Clark and places him in a kryptonite-lined cell with a sadistic sentry standing watch.Episodes which do not work as well include ""Fracture,"" in which Clark takes a trip into Lex's mind.  Episodes with similar themes had been done much more successfully, in Season Three's ""Shattered"" and ""Memoria."" Additionally, ""Fierce"" redefines boredom, a nonsensical episode involving superpowered beauty pageant contestants.Also featuring the debut of Supergirl on the show, played by Laura Vandervoort, and the departure of key regulars, the seventh season of ""Smallville"" is probably better than it has a right to be because of the sheer creative momentum of the series.",4,"Hot and cold season of ""Smallville"" still pulls a rabbit out of the hat",1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,1472,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThe', 'seventh', 'season', 'Smallville', 'not', 'quite', 'place', 'terms', 'quality', 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'have', 'same', 'spark', 'many', 'previous', 'seasons', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'truncated', 'writers', 'strike', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'golden', 'nuggets', 'set.One', 'Persona', 'James', 'Marsters', 'return', 'series', 'Milton', 'Fine/Brainiac', 'episode', 'also', 'Marc', 'McClure', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'films', 'de-powered', 'former', 'Kryptonian', 'scientist', 'trying', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'human', 'being', 'concept', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'was', 'impressed', 'Mr.', 'McClure', 'acting', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'Smallville', 'amazing', 'episode', 'Traveler', 'secret', 'strike', 'team', 'Clark', 'places', 'kryptonite-lined', 'cell', 'sadistic', 'sentry', 'standing', 'watch.Episodes', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'include', 'Fracture', 'Clark', 'trip', 'Lex', 'mind', 'Episodes', 'similar', 'themes', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'successfully', 'Season', 'Three', 'Shattered', 'Memoria', 'Additionally', 'Fierce', 'redefines', 'boredom', 'nonsensical', 'episode', 'involving', 'superpowered', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'contestants.Also', 'featuring', 'debut', 'Supergirl', 'show', 'played', 'Laura', 'Vandervoort', 'departure', 'key', 'regulars', 'seventh', 'season', 'Smallville', 'probably', 'better', 'right', 'be', 'sheer', 'creative', 'momentum', 'series']",N/A

Not so great episode14. Traverler: Start of Veritas here, good episode but choppy in parts15. Veritas: Should have been the finale, because things start to crumble here16. Decent: Great episode, but the role of a major character dies too early in the episode, not enough build up17. Sleeper: Worst episode of the season, Jimmy Olsen enough said18. Apocolyse: Good, but takes away some of the Smallville background19. Quest: Decent, but that is it20. Artic: Good episode, but not a strong finaleThat is my thoughts on the episodes for Season 7.

Well once the season picks up anyway. In the beginning of the season is where I had some problems with it. I mean if I remember correctly Lana faked her death by using a clone of herself that Lex had. If Lex had the technology to clone, why wouldn't he just try to clone Clark and try to uncover his secrets. So yes, the writers are so obsessed with trying to do new things with her that they actually cloned her! lol. I also had problems with how she hates secrets yet she had...a secret room this season that she used to spy on Lex and that she didn't tell Clark about. Close to the end of the season though, they finally learn to not shove her in our faces and we actually get episodes without her.Her being over-used was never the only problem with the show though of course. Another problem is that Clark defeats big comic book villians in the show....before he's even Superman! Zod for example and 2 others that I won't mention if you haven't seen this season. One spoiler I will give away though that I had a problem with is Lois falling for new boss in the beginning of the season. Then when he dies and it's in the papers the writers don't even give her a reaction to it. She doesn't even mention his death once.I forgot to mention one problem I had with the season towards the end though. The problem is....that the writers have either read too much Dan Brown or have seen the DaVinci Code movie too many times. There's some corny stuff with a secret group who hold the secrets to Clark who they refer to as ""the Traveler"". While DaVinci Code like music plays Lex trys to uncover all the mysteries of the group. But hey at least they didn't give us a secret group that worships Lana; oh wait there is a secret group and the writers belong to it.Now on to the good things about the season. Kara/Supergirl (Laura Vandervoort) is introduced and she's pretty hot. I think she's used in smart and engaging ways through-out the season. She's so good that I wouldn't mind a spin-off series with her. The death of a main character is well done as well even if comes it sudden. The episode is at least done right is one of the best I've ever seen from the show. Tom Welling even does some of his best work in the episode when he finally tells off someone that I've been waiting for him to tell off for a long time. No...it's not Lana lol. We also finally get the return of Pete in an episode which is also one of the better ones in awhile. There's also one  where Clark's mom and Kara's father make an appearance. That may sound lame but even that episode turnt out to be pretty good. The return of Brainiac (James Marsters) is another strong point in the season.There's even some other good moments that I can think of that I don't want to give away. I will say though that it's about time that there's been an almost solid season. I even liked that Clark and Lois started to get closer this season friendship wise and that there was more of her and less Lana.",4,"Finally, a Season That's Almost as Good as the First 3!

1113414,APDUCWHP5J905,B000X5SMXY,Julia S.,"[0, 0]","For me, the highlight of season 7 was the final break up between Clark and Lana. The writers took Lana's character way out of its role in the Superman universe, which was insignificant in the series to start with. Sure, she was his childhood or a highschool crush. But their constant drama, break ups and getting back together, constant appologies and mistrust made that relationship detestable. I cannot stand Lana Lang anymore. Personally, i think they should've removed her or given her a lesser role after season 4.Season 7 also has a very dark atmosphere. Lex goes through some interesting ""adjustments"" that make him a real villain. But Clark, unfortunatelly, doesn't turn into a potential hero. He whines and cries throughout the majority of episodes. I think i can write a thesis on how many times he appologized and said ""this is all my fault"". Season 8 needs to make a man out of him AND start working on the Clark/Lois relationship. They don't even look like a potential couple, more like buddies who occasionally engage in friendly rivalry.

1113416,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B000X5SMXY,Kyle Slayzar,"[4, 5]","After watching the season finale of season 6 with the introduction of Bizarro, I was excited believing the CW writers would step-up and transform Clark Kent from the not-so mild-mannered farm boy (that is more in tune with John Byrne's adaptation that Siegel and Shusters) into the caped Man of Steel that we've all been waiting for.  Instead, the writers went on strike.  When they came back, they put-together a mis-match bundle of episodes that made myself and other comic fans and scholars cringe.To myself and others, season six was the pinnacle of the series, especially with the ""Justice League"" episode where the team walks away from the ruble with serious expressions knowing their work has just begun.  THAT was awesome and, to me, it should have been where Clark Kent began to develop into the Man of Steel.  Instead, season seven went in complete reverse and brought the franchise back to it's roots; teen drama.  Granted that is what the WB (Now CW) is known for but the original four seasons were to show Clark Kent's high school years; when that theme ran it's course the producers decided to explore the early transformation of Clark Kent into the Man of Steel but that theme has gone on and on... and on for about three seasons and now season seven retrogresses back into teen drama once again.The teen-drama begins with Kara (AKA Supergirl), Clark's cousin from Krypton.  Now, Supergirl was introduced in the 1950s to entice younger readers with what historian Bradford Wright calls ""silly stories.""  In this regard, the CW sticks true to the comics as Kara's stories right from the start are exactly that starting with a Miss Smallville beauty contest.  The distrust and arguments from Clark to Kara are somewhat true to the comics although their back and forth badgering spanning several episodes got annoying and her character development seemed to be more on her revealing outfits.  It's obvious they didn't hire Laura Vandervort (Kara) for her good acting or bright ideas.  Then again, with the exception of Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor), the same can be said of the entire cast.The next element of annoying teen drama was the back-and-forth love story of Clark and Lana Lang.  Now, anyone remotely familiar with the Superman mythos knows Superman is destined to be with Lois Lane and Lana was more of a childhood crush to help with the back story rather than be a recurring character.  For the sake of the first four Smallville seasons, this meant Lana had to stay and rightfully so.  Problem is, even with Clark Kent ""maturing"" after his graduation from high school, Lana wouldn't leave, the drama intensified, and she actually became a detested character.  Lana's constant trust then mistrust of Clark was more akin to a bad soap opera than intriguing drama.  Thank GOD she's gone!On top of that, without Clark Kent even dreaming of becoming the Man of Steel, he has fought several primary villains from the Superman franchise such as General Zod (which was poorly done), Brainiac, and Bizarro.  Now I hear Clark Kent, not Superman, will face Doomsday in season 7 the villain that ""killed"" Superman in 1993.To compensate for a lack of Superman development, the writers decided to use some creative liberties and introduced a group called ""Veritas,"" a secret society that knows a ""secret"" on how to control ""the traveler"" AKA Clark Kent.  Now, I loved that they brought Robert Picardo (known as The Doctor on Star Trek: Voyager) as a guest star on an episode or two, but the Veritas conspiracy essentially seemed more of the same trust/mistrust style story that just had a Latin name.To me, however, the largest complaints of the series is the horrible insertions of commercial advertisements into the show.  The episode ""Hero"" was nothing but a 42-minute long advertisement for Stride Gum under the guise of bringing back the 'beloved' character Pete Ross.  Ross even goes as far as to hold up a container of Stride Gum with a smile on his face.  Last time I saw something that blatant was a parody of advertising in Wayne's World.  The show also inserted numerous Toyota references, especially to the Yaris.  Granted in one episode in season six Chloe gives Clark her keys and says, ""Take the Yaris,"" not realizing the head space in one of those cars would not be sufficient to allow actor Thomas Welling (who is easily over six feet tall) to drive comfortably.  Believe me, I've sat in one and I'm 6'5.Now, despite all my criticisms I do have some compliments on season seven and these pluses will push me to purchase the series!The episode ""Apocalypse"" where Clark witnesses a world without him, while being an obvious rip-off of It's a Wonderful Life, has an interesting yet subtle message embedded into it.  It shows Clark Kent trying to blend in by being bumbly, wearing a traditional dark suit with thick glasses, and showing affection for Lois.  To me, this shows what Smallville would look like if they went from what they are to what many critics are demanding they become and I gotta tell ya, aside from the nuclear missiles I liked what I saw.  This was Thomas Welling's debut as a director and I thought he did an excellent job portraying himself as what Clark Kent SHOULD be.  I think the CW writers should move towards this mindset minus the nuclear Armageddon.The next episode I really liked was ""Action"" where an action film purposefully made to look like the Superman franchise is being filmed in Smallville.  This episode was made in response to various fans, such as myself, criticizing Lana Lang's character as antiquated and unnecessary demanding that she be booted off the show.  While this episode makes a strong reference to the disaster on the set of The Crow, it still takes an almost humorous jab at it's critics, so kudos to the writers for that episode.After all is said and done, I can barely recommend this season to Smallville fans; it retrogresses back to teen drama and bores the audience with back and forth drama that resembles a cheesy soap opera than a comic-based show.  However, it does have some quality points that fairly redeem it in my eyes and I hope the writers, now back from the strike, will shape up or ship out as I will watch season eight with a heightened sense of scrutiny.",3,The Return to the WB/CW Teen-Drama Formula With Some Highlights,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,6254,"['watching', 'season', 'finale', 'season', '6', 'introduction', 'Bizarro',

1113417,A2S9P70216QC2H,B000X5SMXY,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[0, 2]","Season Review-After six seasons, Smallville continues move forward with its seventh season. But when I mean move forward, I mean producing episodes with little thought about actually taking the overall series forward.  What felt like the writers trying to improve the series with Season 6, Season 7 almost feels like a slap in the face!  Season 7 opens with yet another strong opener with ""Bizarro"" when Tom Welling plays both hero and villain as Bizarro plans to take Clark's life away from him and Chloe is left for dead after using her meteor freak ability for the first time.  While not even close to his comic counterpart, Bizarro is still a solid villain for Clark, and it seems the actor had fun playing him.  Yet, there is little fun throughout the rest of the season.  Pryor to the beginning of the 7th season, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar announced that Kara Zor-El aka Supergirl would be making her debut in the season.  Such a promising introduction left viewers wondering where the arrival of Clark's cousin would take the series, but once Kara hits the screen, all promise is lost.  Laura Vandervoort is a mediocre actress at best, but her portrayal of the character is not why Kara didn't work.  The writing for the character is simply all over the place! By the end of the season, you realize the writers had no idea what they were doing with Kara.  Not to mention, the times where Kara was on screen, the character seemed more powerful than Clark since she could fly.  Not that Clark flying is should be the main focus of the character, but it does make his character look impudent in comparison.  If that wasn't bad enough, the second half of the season introduces the Veritas storyline.  Starting out as possibly one of the best storylines of the series, the Veritas storyline brought more plot holes to the series then actually delivering an exciting plot.  Veritas was a secret cult formed by four rich families: The Luthors, The Teagues, The Queens and Dr. Swann, where they anticipated the arrival of the Traveler aka Clark.  But you realize as the storyline goes on, how exactly could Veritas be possible? It's doesn't makes sense that these characters could have known each other, when it's clear in the earlier seasons that they were just meeting? Also, the development of a weapon that could control Clark, which seemed intriguing at first, was reduced to none sense during the season finale. Even the anticipated the return of James Masters' Brainiac left me disappointed.  While James Masters is as menacing as ever, the character is once again underused and defeated in the most anti-climatic way.Season 7 also adds to the collection of Smallville's worst with episodes like the sub-par Supergirl debut ""Kara"", the beyond ridiculous ""Fierce"", the abysmal conclusion of the House of El storyline in  ""Blue"", the lackluster ""Fracture"", the anti-climatic return of Pete Ross in ""Hero"", The horrible Bond knock off that is ""Sleeper"" and The Da Vinici drivel ""Quest"".  Not to mention, the disappointment of some anticipated episodes: both the 150th episode (Apocalypse) and the season finale (Arctic) left me in awe at how average they were, as usually Smallville delivers with such occasions. The character development, once again, seemed to have been thrown out the window. Let's just say you know the series is in trouble when you start hating the lead character.  Clark is at an ultimate low as a character.  It seems like with every episode the character grows more careless and immature, dare I even say stupid!  All the development that Lana has went through last season is touch upon in ""Wrath"", but after that, Lana is pointless once again as a series regular.  All she does is whine, moan and complain for the majority of the season.  It doesn't help matters that the Clark and Lana try to have a relationship for a third time! The Clana relationship is at its worst and never have I wanted to change the channel with these 2 all lovey dovey around each other.  When will the writers understand that this relationship has always been doomed and they way they seem to keep forcing these 2 together are ridiculous at this point?  The character of Lana Lang has always angered fans simply because the writers glorify the character to the point where it literally holds Clark back from continuing his journey toward his destiny.  In episode ""Action"", Lana mentions that the world needs him more than she does, but Clark tells her that all he needs is right here in front of him...what! That doesn't sound like a character that has been developing for seven years, let alone a character who is going to be Superman! The Jimmy and Chloe's relationship has also lost its steam, especially with Jimmy developing into a jealous boyfriend with obvious insecurities.  Chloe remains pretty much the same, with her meteor freak ability only being touched upon in certain episodes.  Lois finally becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, but before you get excited, the reason she gets the job is by having an affair with the new editor, Grant Gabriel.  Not only is this a forced relationship, but the way Lois begins her Daily Planet career is a pathetic development for such an iconic character. Grant Gabriel himself is a misused, underwritten and poorly casted character who only serves as a plot device to show how crazier Lex is becoming.Speaking of Lex, Michael Rosenbaum as well as John Glover are the only saving graces this season.  The rivalry between both Lex and Lionel comes to a shocking conclusion in the season's only real gem ""Descent"".  ""Descent"" tells a classic storyline of good vs. evil with Clark and Lex finds themselves as finally mortal enemies at the episode's end when another beloved character meets their end.  The only other episodes I recommend seeing are the season opener ""Bizarro"", Dean Cain (Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman) portrays of a psychotic immortal in ""Cure"", Helen Slater (Supergirl: the Movie) appears as Clark's real mother in ""Lara"", the shocking twists of ""Gemini"", Marc McClure (Superman: the Movie's Jimmy Olson) plays a Kryptonian scientist in ""Persona"", The Green Arrow/Black Canary episode ""Siren"" and the thrill ride ""Traveler.  All of the rest of the episodes are average or plain awful. It's kinda bittersweet watching this season as it's the last season for many of the cast and crew.  Kristin Kreuk, Michael Rosenbaum, and John Glover make their final appearances as cast regulars this season before making their exits.  Also creators, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar make their exit, leaving the series in the hands of their writing staff.  On one hand, I'm kinda sad that Lex Luthor left in such an anti-climatic way.  The finale scene between Clark and Lex in ""Arctic"" was a poorly written scene that just didn't sum up they're journey from friends to foes well enough.  But on the other hand, the current season that's running (Season 8) is shaping up to be the best season since Season 3!  It's almost seems like a blessing that Alfred and Miles left! But as their final season as the series' show runners, Season 7 is a sorry excuse of a season with poorly written storylines, horrible character development and terrible exits for some of our beloved characters.  Some fans debate that the poor quality of Season 7 was due to the writers' strike during the 2007-2008 television season.  As a result, Season 7 has only 20 episodes, making it the shortest season of the series, but that was no excuse to rush storylines and developments to satisfy the fans! It just shows how unoriginal and uncreative they are as what could have been one of their strongest seasons turned out to be one of the worst yet!Season Rating: 4/10Video and Audio-All 20 Season 7 episodes look nice in this widescreen showing.  The audio is good as always.Video and Audio Rating: 8/10Extras-With a disappointing season comes the most disappointing box set with some uneven extras.  The audio commentaries return after their absence on the Season 6 set but the episode chosen are random, ""Person"" and ""Siren"". Why not more important episodes like ""Bizarro"" or ""Descent""? The deleted extras are ultimately forgettable for the most part. Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton Modisodes are mediocre at best.  Smallville Visions Web Comic is average. The only worthy extras are the 2 documentaries on Supergirl and Jimmy Olsen.Extras Rating: 6.5/10Overall Rating: 5/10",3,Supergirl Arrives and The Mystery of Veritas-Smallville's Complete Seventh

1113424,AQC4FLH1BQ04C,B000X5SMXY,Mikey Mike,"[0, 0]","Although I did not get into Smallville until its fifth season I have seen every episode more than once and it has become one of my very favorite shows.  I actually didn't know when I watched this season during its first television run that it would be Michael Rosenbaum's last, and that Kristin Kreuk would only return for five episodes in season eight.  Although I have missed Rosenbaum in the nearly three years since his departure, I have not missed Kreuk as I never really cared for Lana until season six.  While the writer's strike knocked the episode count down from 22 to 20, Smallville fared much better in this respect than many other shows that year.  If I recall correctly, Supernatural's third season only got 16 or 17 episodes.The seventh season of Smallville was great in many respects.  Lex Luthor's continued fall into darkness was epic, culminating in the episode ""Descent,"" where he ruthlessly murdered his own father over the secrets of Veritas and the identity of the mysterious Traveler.  John Glover's presence, just like Annette O'Toole and John Schneider, was sorely missed once he left, but his death scene was quite awesome.  Lex's final (?) confrontation with Clark in the Fortress in ""Arctic"" felt a bit short, leaving me with a ""that's it?"" feeling when it was over.  For all his past dastardly deeds, I enjoyed that Lionel Luthor went down as one of the good guys, albeit one whose methods were still questionable.  I enjoyed how Lionel's need to protect Clark and his secret (even after Jor-El quit using him as a vessel) and his affections for Martha Kent filled Lex with even more bitter resentment toward Clark and Lionel.The growing, yet continually problematic relationship between Chloe and Jimmy was fun to watch.  Allison Mack and Aaron Ashmore had great chemistry, although it was obvious while watching that it would be a relationship that doesn't last.  Even if Jimmy (spoiler alert) didn't die at the end of Season Eight, I still feel like he and Chloe wouldn't have worked out in the long run.  Out of all the seasons Smallville has been on, I feel like Chloe Sullivan has become one of the most dynamic characters, mostly owing to Allison Mack hitting it out of the park time and time again.  Here is a young woman who has sacrificed over and over again for the greater good: her feelings for Clark, often her friendship with Clark, her relationship with Jimmy, her job at the Daily Planet, her freedom, sometimes her sanity all in the name of protecting the super heroes.Lois was fun to watch this season, and for the first time I actually felt like Erica Durance was growing into the role of Lois Lane.  Her relationship this season with Grant Gabriel was a nice twist.  Kara Kent (Supergirl) did not make that much of an impression on me, either way.  I liked her episodes in the second half of the season much better than the first half.  Given that she was only a series regular for one season I do not fault Laura Vandervoot for this.Finally, I was supremely happy that the Clark/Lana storyline came to a close, despite a brief return in Season Eight.  This set the stage for Clark to fall in love with Lois.  After years and years of watching Lana fall for other people, reject him for other men (Jason, Lex), I found it annoying that Clark continued to indulge Lana.  I mean, given her turn to the dark side in season six, is it really plausible that Clark would still believe Lana incapable of any deception at all?

A principal one is the death of Lionel Luthor, a character unseen in the Superman movies, leaving Lex alone as the chief of the Luthor empire.  A second lead-in is the departure of Lana, and Clark's growing friendship with Lois.  Third, we have Clark's victory over Braniac.  Last, and most importantly, Lex finally discovers who Clark is, and the season ends with their climatic confrontation.Like other seasons, season 7 has its fair share of ludicrous episodes.  A good example is when Jimmy is conned into spying on Chloe.  His newfound ability to penetrate Luthorcorp security is totally out of character and wholly unbelievable.  The most important thread of the show is Lex's obsession of Veritas, and fully half the episodes deal with this theme.

Love the whole idea of how she was launched out to earth at the same time Kal-El was sent so that she could raise him but something happened on her way! Supergirl cracked me up at first! Especially in her first few episodes like when she lifts up that little kid into the air and asks ""Who are you and what is your name"" (I think that's what she says)! :-)  LOVED it!This version of Lois Lane is still the best Lois Lane ever, for me!  Erica Durance delivers such a refreshing nod to the Reeve/Kidder films.  She's the main reason I still keep watching.  If Erica Durance were to leave, then I will stop watching all together.  I LOVE her comedic timing when she delivers her lines! :-)  What a shame these lazy writers got this well known character in to the Daily Planet like they did.I would LOVE to see Lynda Carter added to the cast as a series regular!  How cool is that...our former Wonder Woman on the show of our future Superman? She was awesome as Chloe's Mom last season!Season 6 had so much potential but then the writers went and had Clark obsess on Lang, AGAIN! Why wont the writers give this version of Clark Kent some back-bone? Why do they make him so pride-less and pathetic?  This Clark Kent's moto is pine pine pine and whine whine whine.  (Poor Tom Welling) Who knows, maybe Supergirl will slap some Kryptonian pride into him.  Why oh why are the writers STILL trying to make Clark and L. Lang an epic couple? In the Superman mythology, Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane are the epic couple! Lois Lane is his future and his destiny! Enough already with the obsession over Lana Lang! I am really psyched about season 8 coming this Fall but if these writers write another season of the nauseating to death, nails on a chalk board obsession with Clark and Lana, Lois Lane or no Lois Lane, Supergirl or no Supergirl, I'm changing the station to Ugly Betty.

It's amazing how, with little to no promotion, Smallville has managed to stay on the airwaves for 8 seasons. I think that's a testament to the subject matter. This story about a SUPERMAN in training may have fun toying around with the mythology, but at the end of the day it's still all about Clark Kent's journey to become the most famous superheroe in the world. The seventh season picks up exactly where the sixth left off, quickly informing us about what happened with Lex, Clark, and his evil twin Bizzaro! They were all in danger of certain death after Reeves Dam collapsed, did they survive? When Lana's car exploded, did she manage to get out in time? Will Lois Lane manage to return the favor and save her cousin Chloe's life? Along with answering all these questions we are also introduced to a mysterious blonde who can fly. Who is she? Is she evil or some kind of Super girl? New mysteries are introduced as we learn about a secret organization named Veritas in search of ""the traveler."" What are their motives, and how will they affect Clark's life?As you may already know, last year's writer's strike forced the writers to tweak and alter story lines in order to speed some things up and others were simply slowed down. This causes some of the episodes to feel rushed or sometimes even a little incomplete. However, it's great to witness Clark inch closer to his destiny and his nemesis, Lex, cross the line into iniquity. Many people disliked the introduction of Clark's kryptonian cousin, but I personally didn't mind. I understand wny many fans felt that she made Clark look weak, but I don't feel it was Laura Vandervoort's fault, I just think the writers did what the producers asked and unfortunately the character of Clark suffered due to it. I feel Laura's work was very understated and also underappreciated. She did a splendid job and I hope to see more of her in the future. Alison Mack is great as Chloe, Tom Welling is capable as Clark, although sometimes I wish he'd give us more. Kristin Kreuk is great as Lana, and a lovely young woman who has also blossomed the most as an actress, however, I have to say that they've been dragging the Clark & Lana storyline way past it's expiration date. Luckily, the last few episodes make sure that their dynamic changes, and we the viewer, know that there are better storylines to come.For those of you who aren't fans and have no idea what I'm talking about, let me just say that this show is action-packed, it's like watching a mini-movie every episode and I hope you're not turned off just because it's sci-fi.

Brainiac (James Marsters) returns to once again threaten Clark and the planet Earth. The seventh season of ""Smallville"" isn't one of the most memorable of the entire series. Many storylines felt mediocre and the season-long story arc was rather flawed. Despite its flaws, the seventh season still offers some enjoyment and a few standout episodes like ""Bizarro"", ""Descent"", ""Siren"" and ""Gemini"". The season also features the brief return of Sam Jones III as Pete Ross, and guest appearances by Helen Slater (Supergirl), Dean Cain (Lois & Clark) and Marc McClure (Superman: The Movie).""Smallville: The Complete Seventh Season"" arrives on DVD just in time for the start of its eighth season. All twenty episodes of the seventh season are presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is the same as the previous DVD sets but it's still a very good video transfer.

1113436,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000X5SMXY,Robert Moore,"[10, 14]","Warning! Several spoilers!I have long had a conflicted reaction to SMALLVILLE. On the one hand I really like a lot of the main characters -- the reconception of Lex Luthor and the invention of the character of Chloe Sullivan are two major contributions to the Superman mythology -- and there are in each season at least a few exceptionally good episodes. On the other hand, SMALLVILLE narratively remains one of the most timid shows on TV, barely moving the overall story along from one season to the next. Fans of LOST became unhappy with the series both in Season Two and at the very beginning of Season Three because the show seemed to go into something of a holding pattern. Instead of moving the story along, it seemed to be standing still (luckily LOST dramatically picked up the pace in the last 16 episodes of Season Three and all of Season Four). But compared to SMALLVILLE, even at its slowest LOST seemed to be moving along at a jacket rabbit pace. Both shows seem slow compared to BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, which has moved its story along at a refreshingly brisk pace.So, all in all, not much happened in Season Seven of SMALLVILLE, much like all previous seasons. The goal of the show seems to be to stretch it out as long as possible, not to make the best show that they can. Four or five episodes can pass with virtually nothing of significance having happened, and then you get an exception one like ""Descent,"" in which Lex kills his own father Lionel, and Lex is transformed into something approximating the utterly evil Lex Luthor of traditional Superman.But the timidity of the writers/producers dominates the show. Only at the end of the season do we finally see what appears to be the genuine end of the Lana/Clark romance. Lois was introduced seasons ago, yet it is hard to imagine her and Clark having much chemistry (that will be the great challenge for Season Eight, making the eventual romance between the two of them seem not merely possible but plausible). They seem more than anything like non-kissing cousins. New plot wrinkles were introduced in Season Seven, like Clark's cousin Kara arriving and the emergence of the Veritas organization, but these mainly seemed to be ways of postponing the real story. And what is that? How a mild-mannered farm boy (as Lois puts it) can be transformed into the world's greatest super hero. In Season Six we seemed to be moving a bit in that direction with Oliver Queen urging to use his abilities for some greater purpose, but in Season Seven Clark seems to have regressed. He seems -- to be blunt -- to be clueless about what he should be doing with his life.The biggest story surrounding Season Seven really is about what it portends for Season Eight. There is absolutely no question, the changes from Season Seven to Eight will be enormous. Michael Rosenbaum (Lex) and Kristin Kreuk (Lana) both will be more or less leaving the show. Lex should be present in at least the first episode of Season Eight, but while both are supposed to return in guest roles, neither is expected to play a major role next season. Also gone is John Glover as Lionel Luthor. It could have been worse. After these three major characters were acknowledged by the studio to be leaving, Allison Mack's agent demanded a substantial raise, since Chloe would be the only major remaining character besides Clark from Season One. After a few days of posturing and an enormous outcry of outrage by fans, it was announced that Chloe would indeed returning (I hope her raise was a good one -- she deserves it). This good news was tempered with reports that Laura Vandervoort, who had been excellent in Season Seven as Kara (aka Supergirl), might not be returning in Season Eight. I hope they bring her back. This show has lost an exceptional number of familiar faces in recent years. They ought to try and keep any good, new one. There are rumors that Oliver Queen aka The Green Arrow might be back for at least part of Season Eight.But my major concerns with Season Eight return to questions of narrative. Speed it up, guys! They really need this season to deal with two major issues and then bring the series to an end. First, they really need to make this particular Clark and this particular Lois believable as a romantically destined couple. Second, they need to give Clark the backbone to face up to the significance of his having the powers that he does and what that entails. In other words, Clark needs to become heroic on a truly super level. As far as the romance goes, there have been other shows that have successfully replaced one epic romantic couple with another. The love of Buffy's life was Angel, but her romance with Spike was engrossing in its own way. And while for three years the great romantic couple on THE O.C. was Ryan and Marissa (though I personally preferred Summer and Seth), Season Four made us forget all about R&M; by unexpectedly pairing Ryan with Taylor, a character he had had absolutely no romantic vibes with in Season Three. The show needs to hit the ground running in Season Eight pushing the whole Lois and Clark thing. We have to believe that they might have a future together by the time the series ends. Right now it takes a heck of a lot of imagination to imagine them together.Update (July):  The people taking over the production of the show apparently are having some of the same feelings about the need to develop the Lois and Clark connection as I mentioned above.  Multiple leaks indicate the Season 8 will show a definite racheting up of the relationship between those two, though initially it will be more comedic than dramatic.  I think that could be wise.  It is easier to imagine them developing feelings through comic situations than heavy emotionally ones.  But the leaks definitely have me looking forward to what comes next.  Also, confirmation that Oliver Queen will be very close to a full time character and the announcement that Doomsday will be played by Sam Witmer (best known as Crashdown from Season One of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA).",4,An excellent season for a show that has been on for seven years,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,6034,"['Warning', 'Several', 'spoilers', 'have', 'long', 'had', 'conflicted', 'reaction',

1113438,AU57H1B8J6SCV,B000X5SMXY,sarajade,"[0, 0]","This is more a comment on Season 7 rather than Bizarro.  I think this is the season I like the least. I was not a big fan of how much Kara Kent dominated this season.  I didn't like her story line and would have preferred something else.  I don't know much about the Superman mythos so I don't know what other character they could have brought it but Kara was just weak as a character.  Lex and Lana also seemed to have lost the wind in their sails after their relationship failed...as if it were ever going to be a success.  They were both shadows of their former selves.  And I didn't get to see enough of Lois Lane.  It's funny that in season 4, as a ""recurring"" character, she seemed to be more in Clark Kent's life than what we saw in this season 7. They were barely in the same room together and I ""missed"" that chemistry that they'd been building since Lois entered the scene.  The Lana storyline went on too long for my taste.  Is it realistic to believe that Clark Kent would have taken back Lana after she'd been with his enemy ""Lex"". Like I said, I don't know the Superman mythos but it just seem so unrealistic to me...especially given how much Lana tended to berate and ""hate-on"" Clark in season 5 and 6.  So...I don't get what season 7 was all about except to show us the ""final"" downfall of Lex and Lana in Clark Kent's life.  I wish they'd could go back and re-do this season.

1113439,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000X5SMXY,Sean Pasek,"[194, 203]","**I'm going to SPOILER tag this review for anyone who hasn't seen this season yet.  Some of the problems that I have with this season, I'll need to reference specific details**The 7th Season of Smallville, unfortunately, has two fewer episodes due to the writer's strike.  Some of the problems in this season could be a direct result of this.  Another issue is that the CW renewed the show for an 8th season, but most of the contracts for the cast had ended, except for Tom Welling.  In some ways, it seemed that the writers were struggling to come up with a good way to transition into Season 8 while finding a way to make plausible exits for those cast members who will not be returning to the show.  Unfortunately, this hurt Season 7 of Smallville to a degree.  The show loses some of its cohesiveness that they've enjoyed, especially in comparison to Seasons 5 & 6, which in my opinion, are the show's best seasons.Of course, most people don't realize how difficult it is to be a show running for 7 years and maintain that high level of quality that Smallville has been.  Most shows tend to lose something the longer they are on the air.  Stories change, cast members come and go, and it can be very difficult to maintain the show's quality with so many changes.Okay Smallville fans, we're finally treated to what many people had been waiting for: Lana finding out Clark's secret, AND Clark finding out that Lana knows.  Many people, myself included, were expecting something big for this occasion, since, for some people, they had been waiting for this moment for 7 years.  The emotional climax is dry.  One is almost forced to ask, ""Is that it?  Is this as excited as they can get?  Clark FINALLY gets what he wants, and yet, he doesn't seem as excited as he should be.""  Okay, we all know that Clark will eventually end up with Lois.  But in that moment with Lana, I felt that there needed to be more than what they showed.  I would think that Clark would be ecstatic!  I would think that Lana would have a ton of questions to ask him, especially given their history.Exit Martha Kent from the show, enter cousin Kara (aka, Supergirl).  At first, I was extremely apprehensive about this addition.  And yet, newcomer, Laura Vandervroot does a credible job with the limited amount of time that she is on the show.  It's difficult to do a proper character development on a character who is only in a handful of episodes.  Purists may find a distaste that Supergirl demonstrates more powers than Clark, at this point, as he is still unable AND unwilling to learn to fly.Kristin Kreuk is also in the show for a limited time, and she even drops down to third billing in the opening credits behind Tom and Michael.  She's barely in the last five episodes as Kristin was in Thailand shooting a movie.  While it's not her fault, the final moment between Clark and Lana, via videotape is stale and leaves the viewer feeling cheated.  Many fans who already seem to despise the character of Lana were given further ammunition when Lana breaks up with Clark via videotape.James Marsters returns as Brainiac, and he's still as good as ever.  I was glad to see them bring the character back.Chloe is still Clark's faithful sidekick but now she's a ""meteor freak;"" a type of person that she has spent much of her time trying to expose.  Now she's faced with her own dilema of whether or not to tell boyfriend, Jimmy Olson that she now possesses the power to heal.  While interesting, one still can't help but wonder how and when Chloe suddenly came upon this power.  We are given no explanation or even possible theories.Lois is as headstrong as ever, but toward the end of the season, her character begins to soften a bit, especially toward Clark.  You can't help but think that the writers are laying some groundwork for the future couple.  I still think Erica is the best Lois to play the part, and Lois has some great moments with Clark at the end of the season.Michael Rosenbaum is always fantastic, even though Lex still can't seem to avoid getting shot.  The only problem is that Lex doesn't seem to be around as much.  There are stretches where you miss him.  I certainly did, considering he's one of the strongest actors of the cast.  There is a classic moment when Lex finally rids himself of the last trace of good that is left.  The scene after he has killed Lionel, and he throws ""Alexander"" on the fire shouting, ""You make me weak!"" is classic, vintage Lex, and Michael Rosenbaum has the character nailed cold.Tom Welling is excellent as Clark.  If he has one ""weakness"" it's his difficulty in showing real, genuine emotion.  There are scenes were he appears to be trying too hard, and it loses some punch because it doesn't appear natural enough.  His range as an actor has only grown with each season, but I'd love to see him lose his fear of expanding his emotional range to include complete sadness and the sense of loss.  He showed real glimpses of this during the time when Jonathan Kent died.  He's also still a fantastic director as shown in ""Apocalypse"" where Clark is given a chance to see how things would be if he never came to Earth.  It's sort of a Smallville version of ""It's a Wonderful Life.""This season still has some great and memorable episodes.  Lana briefly possesses Clark's powers (though at no loss of his own) in ""Wrath.""  It's a great episode, and you really understand why no one but Clark can handle that much power; not just physically but psychologically.""Descent"" may be the season's best episode as Lex and Lionel have their final confrontation that leads to tragic results for Lionel.  The final scene with Lex and Clark standing on either side of Lionel's coffin is a classic and powerful Smallville moment that is not to be missed.As good as many episodes were, the season finale, ""Arctic"" is bit of a let down, especially when you compare it to past finales that always had dazzling cliffhangers that made you dread the 5 months until you find out what happens!  The problem with ""Arctic"" as well as with the main storyline leading to it, is that it feels rushed.  It was as if the writers were trying to quickly get through it as fast as possible (especially with 2 fewer episodes to work with) in order to get things set-up for the next season.  Unfortunately, the finale and main storyline suffer as a consequence.Things might have improved greatly if they had done what other shows have done in the past: shoot a 90 minute finale.  This gives them more time for better plot development, and it would not have felt rushed.  You have the final confrontation with Brainiac.  You have Clark and Lana dealing with their final moments.  You have Clark trying to get to Lex to prevent him from using a device that will somehow control Clark (a fairly weak idea on the writer's part.  It still seems unlikely from a character standpoint that Jor-El would actually create some device to control Clark that could be used by humans even if they had to find the clues to acquire it.  Here Smallville went a little ""Da Vinci Code"" on us.  Besides, I didn't see any concern on Jor-El's part when Clark was on red kryptonite and wreaking havoc in Metropolis).Because past seasons of Smallville have all been great or beyond great, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing from this season.  It felt rushed.  It lacked the emotional depth that Smallville has utilized in the past, and the storyline turned out to be only satisfactory when compared to past seasons.I still love this show and have since the first season.  Since the show has been picked up for another season, I'm really hoping that with a full 22-episode season, Smallville can bounce back and end the series with the efficient capability that the writers have shown in the past.  After all, Smallville is about Clark becoming Superman, and I for one, want them to go out in a blaze of glory as Clark finally accepts his destiny and becomes the iconic hero that we all know and love.",4,"Smallville Loses Some Punch This Season, But It Is Still Worth Watching!",1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,7989,"['**I', ""'m"", 'going', 'SPOILER', 'tag', 'review', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"",

1113443,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000X5SMXY,Simon,"[6, 7]","I've been a longtime follower of Smallville, and every year there's always fans (myself included) who finger the current year as ""Jumping the shark"". If you browse my profile you'll find my reviews of the older seasons start enthusiastic and become more critical as the years pass. While I won't comment on the currently airing season 8, the trend seems to hold true when you compare season 7 to the six that came before it - they're pure genius compared to this mess.There's way too much going on this year. Smallville always has great comic book-esque storylines, but lacks development and internal logic within its own world. The writers jump from plot to plot with no pacing, so you get seemingly dramatic life-changing events that are completely forgotten by the next episode. There's a shocking twist involving the new Daily Planet Editor that's cut short right when it gets interesting; the return of Clark's biological mom Lara barely lasts an episode; Bizzaro appears and is promptly defeated - twice; Clark travels through time and space to save his infant self on Krypton in all of five minutes. Sam Jones finally returns as Pete Ross and is wasted in horrible product placement. Supergirl is introduced and barely developed before she's saddled with the amnesia cliche and disappears for most of the season. Why not settle on 2 or 3 storylines and develop them properly? And don't blame the writer's strike, which cuts this season by 2 episodes - the problems were obvious before the strike happened.Speaking of outside influences, quite a few characters leave the show this year. Kristen Kreuk's sudden  departure to film Street Fighter leaves her already weak character a rather anemic farewell - luckily she'll be back briefly in season 8 to tie up loose ends. Another character that I won't spoil dies a noble death, and will be missed. It's Rosenbaum's departure that's the real kicker, though. Not only is Smallville's best actor not coming back, but he's left with an ambiguous and unsatisfying ending. Hardly a great capper to 7 years of amazing work.There are some things Smallville does right this year - the return of Brainiac and the 'Veritas' storyline bring a sense of continuity that the show has been sorely lacking. But overall, there's a lack of coherency that seasons 5 and 6 tried to have, and the show has no heart now that the Kent parents are gone. Whether or not you need this season depends on if you bought the first six and absolutely want the complete collection.",2,The low point of the series?,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,2503,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'longtime', 'follower', 'Smallville', 'year', 'always', 'fans', 'included', 'who', 'finger', 'current', 'year', 'Jumping', 'shark', 'browse', 'profile', ""'ll"", 'find', 'reviews', 'older', 'seasons', 'start', 'enthusiastic', 'become', 'more', 'critical', 'years', 'pass', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'currently', 'airing', 'season', '8', 'trend', 'hold', 'true', 'when', 'compare', 'season', '7', 'six', 'came', ""'re"", 'pure', 'genius', 'compared', 'mess.There', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'year', 'Smallville', 'always', 'great', 'comic', 'book-esque', 'storylines', 'development', 'internal', 'logic', 'own', 'world', 'writers', 'jump', 'plot', 'plot', 'pacing', 'get', 'seemingly', 'dramatic', 'life-changing', 'events', 'are', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'next', 'episode', 'shocking', 'twist', 'involving', 'new', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'Editor', 'cut', 'short', 'right', 'when', 'interesting', 'return', 'Clark', 'biological', 'mom', 'Lara', 'barely', 'episode', 'Bizzaro', 'promptly', 'defeated', 'twice', 'Clark', 'time', 'space', 'save', 'infant', 'self', 'Krypton', 'five', 'minutes', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'finally', 'Pete', 'Ross', 'wasted', 'horrible', 'product', 'placement', 'Supergirl', 'introduced', 'barely', 'developed', 'saddled', 'amnesia', 'cliche', 'disappears', 'most', 'season', 'Why', 'not', 'settle', '2', '3', 'storylines', 'develop', 'properly', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'writer', 'strike', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'problems', 'were', 'obvious', 'strike', 'happened.Speaking', 'outside', 'influences', 'quite', 'few', 'characters', 'leave', 'show', 'year', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'sudden', 'departure', 'film', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'already', 'weak', 'character', 'rather', 'anemic', 'farewell', 'luckily', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'briefly', 'season', '8', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'character', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'noble', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'Rosenbaum', 'departure', 'real', 'kicker', 'though', 'Not', 'only', 'Smallville', 'best', 'actor', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'left', 'ambiguous', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'Hardly', 'great', 'capper', '7', 'years', 'amazing', 'are', 'things', 'Smallville', 'right', 'year', 'return', 'Brainiac', ""'Veritas"", 'storyline', 'bring', 'sense', 'continuity', 'show', 'been', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'overall', 'lack', 'coherency', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'tried', 'have', 'show', 'heart', 'now', 'Kent', 'parents', 'are', 'gone', 'not', 'need', 'season', 'bought', 'first', 'six', 'absolutely', 'want', 'complete', 'collection']",N/A

1113449,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000X5SMXY,Tom Benton,"[65, 74]","*NOTE: Spoilers within.*I've been in love with ""Smallville"" since the first day I saw the pilot.  I've grown up with this show, literally, and I'll stick with it no matter what.  That said, I stopped expecting great or even good writing from the show a long time ago.  Maybe Joss Whedon has spoiled me.  When I watch television now, I expect something great.  Fortunately, ""Smallville"" has enough going for it to make up for the crap writing, but with good writing, it could really be something great.  Though most other fans will call me crazy, I stand by Season One as the best season of the show, because even if the storylines themselves were nothing special, the writing and style of the show was superb.  After Season One, though, things loosened up a bit, and when we hit Season Five, I figured that was probably as good as the show would ever be.But then came Season Six.  Wow.  Season Six was not just a great season of ""Smallville"": it was a great season of television!  The directing tightened up, the writing became clever and began moving the storylines along at a much faster pace - even Mark Snow's previously unremarkable music suddenly became intense, dark, and atmospheric.  The show as a whole improved dramatically, and for that one season, the series soared like it hadn't in years.  The show hadn't changed any of its personnel.  It was just a sudden and inexplicable change.So now we've come out of the series' seventh season.  Who ever thought the show would last this long?  Considering that it has lasted this long, Season Seven is not so bad.  What it is, though, is bland.  Most people would agree that Season Four was the low point of the series.  For all its shortcomings, though, Season Four was colorful.  Season Four was fun.  Though Season Seven may be a little sturdier than Season Four as far as its storylines, it's bland as hell.  In fact, this may be the most bland season of any series I've ever seen.  The writing usually just cuts it.  The directing just cuts it.  The story moves at such a slow pace that a story arc which should be resolved over two or three episodes runs on for nine or more.  To their credit, the actors are trying their best, but the material is too lackluster for them to really strut their stuff - and thus, the acting just cuts it.  Everything just cuts it, and that doesn't make for the most exciting season.The season's strongest point is the introduction of Kara, a.k.a. Supergirl, the other last survivor of Krypton.  Laura Vandernoot is a fine bit of casting.  She's got the Supergirl look in her eyes.  And guess what else?  She can fly.  As early as the second episode of the season, the writers drop hints that Kara's going to teach Clark to fly.  In fact, the selling point of ""Veritas"" -- which begins the final arc of the season and my personal least-favorite arc of the entire show -- is that Clark needs to learn how to fly to defeat the resurrected Braniac (once more played by the peerless James Marsters).  But Clark doesn't learn to fly, and there's never any reason given for why he doesn't.  He just doesn't.  By the end of Season Seven, Clark still has not flown.  That's a little ridiculous.The long-anticipated return of James Marsters as Braniac is one of the more appealing parts of the season.  But despite a promising re-introduction, Braniac winds up as little more than a background figure.  He doesn't even feel like much of a menace.  He crops up and now and then to give the storylines a little push, and then he's gone.  It's really a bad way to Marsters and a misuse of the series' finest non-Luthor villain.Speaking of the Luthors, this season is a big one for the devilish duo.  Lex takes his final steps toward becoming the mega-bad-guy he is in the comic books.  Despite this, the character only shines thrice through the season.  The first time is in ""Fracture,"" an interesting little headtrip in which Lex is shot and Clark must go inside his mind.  I'm not sure why, and I don't think the writers were that certain either.  This final glimpse into the mind of Lex Luthor reminds us of how kind he was when the show began -- and how not-so-kind he is now.  The second time is a moment in ""Hero,"" when Lex decides he needs to torture someone for information.  Rosenbaum has rarely been better.  In that scene, a cloud of absolute blackness surrounds Lex, and we recognize just how evil he has become.  The third time is in the season finale, ""Arctic,"" in a scene which ""Smallville"" fans have been dreaming of for some time.  Tempting as it is, I won't reveal what happens.  Suffice to say I'll be very interested to see how the writers try to work that little twist into the mythology.As for Lionel, well ... things don't go so well for him.  Through this season, Lionel doesn't serve much of a purpose.  John Glover, arguably the most talented actor ever to feature on the show, is left unable to do much of anything.  So in ""Descent,"" Lionel dies.  And the worst part?  I didn't even care.  I've always loved Lionel, but the writers had done such a poor job of fleshing him out recently that he seemed more like a cardboard cut-out tossed into a scene here and there.  When that happens, something is wrong.That's really the way most of the season is, though.  It does have a few very good episodes.  The season premiere, ""Bizarro,"" stays true to the ""Smallville"" tradition of excellent premieres.  Playing Bizarro is the only chance Tom Welling gets to shine anymore.  The third episode, ""Fierce,"" is not going to rank highly in the pantheon of great ""Smallville"" episodes.  The episode revolves around three contestants in Smallville's annual beauty pageant who decide to take advantage of Kara when she decides to compete in the pageant.  It doesn't sound that good, and it isn't, but I really enjoyed it.  It reminded me of the earlier episodes of the show, when, even if the stories weren't that good, the writing was strong as the Man of Steel, there was an incessant soundtrack loaded with today's most popular music, and there was color -- lots and lots of color.  You don't get that in a season filled mostly with cold purples and metallic blues.In ""Cure,"" Dean Cain (of ""Lois & Clark"") finally guest stars.  Oliver Queen, alias the Green Arrow, returns in ""Siren.""  Queen was the best part of Season Six, because Justin Hartley is a terrific actor.  Beside being one of the most attractive men to ever appear on ""Smallville,"" Hartley can turn even the most droll writing into something cracking and witty.  It's a pity he only shows up for one episode.  Also in ""Siren"": Black Canary makes her first appearance.  Nice.The best episode of the season, surprisingly, is the one that looked like it was going to be the worst.  ""Apocalypse,"" directed by Tom Welling, is the inevitable Capra episode, in which Clark is shown what the world would be like if he had never arrived on Earth.  Sound ridiculous?  It sure does.  But it's not.  It's a blast.  The writing is strong and even clever, the acting is great, and the execution of the premise is surprisingly fun.  A lot of this fun comes from seeing some real sparks fly between Clark and Lois.  Given the focus on Clark's relationship with Lana, one might wonder if it would be convincing for Clark and Lois to ever have a relationship on ""Smallville.""  But this episode proves it would be, because the chemistry between Welling and Erica Durance is absolutely wonderful.  The final treat: for two minutes, we get to see Clark in his disguise as a mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet.Those are the better episodes of Season Seven.  Now for the bad ones.""Gemini,"" in which one of Lex's former experiments plants a bomb on Lois Lane, is ridiculous and pointless.  But ""Hero"" is a massive disappointment.  It features the very, very long-anticipated return of Pete Ross (and Sam Jones III) to the show, and it sure as hell wasn't worth the wait.  It's fairly obvious that the episode was written for another character to return; when that actor wasn't available, they re-wrote it just enough so it could fit Pete.  But it doesn't: Pete doesn't feel like Pete.  Additionally, Clark doesn't seem to really care that Pete's back.  Wasn't Pete's best friend since they were in kindergarten?  He comes back and Clark doesn't give a hoot?  Come on!Let's not forget ""Sleeper,"" either, an episode which lives up to its title.  The increasingly contempt-worthy Jimmy Olsen is hired by the F.B.I. as a superspy to keep track of Chloe, who somehow has managed to hack in to the government's computers.  It's foolish, it's painful, it's embarrassing - it's ""Sleeper.""The real stinkers of the season are the final episodes.  The season was cut down to 20 episodes thanks to the writers' strike -- and I mean THANKS to the writers' strike.  Anything more than 20 episodes would have been pushing it.  The final few episodes feature the stupidest, most pointless, and most absurd storyline the writers have ever concocted.  Apparently, Lionel and his old rich pals were part of a secret group called ""Veritas"" -- Latin for ""truth"" -- which believed that some day, the ""Traveler"" would come to Earth and save its people.  Guess who the ""Traveler"" is?  Yep, it's Clark.  The penultimate episode of the arc, ""Quest,"" which features a painful guest appearance by Robert Picardo, is absolutely the worst episode of the entire show.Finally, the season concludes with ""Arctic.""  It is the weakest finale the show has had, but considering the consistently high quality of the series' finales, that's not a bad thing at all.  The ending scene, with the aforementioned twistiness and all, is one of the most spectacular scenes of the entire series.So what's next?  Well, shockingly, toward the end of the season, creators and executive producers Al Gough and Miles Millar announced they were leaving the series.  That leaves Season Eight in someone else's hands, which is definitely a good thing.  I've heard about some new characters and storylines being introduced in Season Eight, and so far, they sound great.  The show really needs to get going if they're going to tie this all together.  The absence of Michael Rosenbaum next year will take some getting used to, but I think it was a wise move.  The absence of Kristin Kreuk is a wiser move, because, though she seems like a good person in real life and I like her, Kreuk's character is immensely irritating.  Besides -- shouldn't Clark and Lois get together?  Let's hope so.  And let's hope the writers get it together too.",3,Tiptoe-ing over kryptonite,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,10526,"['*NOTE', 'Spoilers', '*I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'love', 'Smallville', 'first', 'day',

How many times do we have to see him make the same errors and mistakes that he has made in judgment for the past 7 seasons before the lesson sinks in to kryptonian brain that his father jor-el is right.2. we are up to season 7 and Clark still cannot fly. They teased it during the season but unrealized give me a break he's invulnerable yet he's scared of trying to leap from the barn to fly.3. lara aka ""supergirl"" breaks from the original comic mythos about her origin. I liked how they reinvented her origin for tv but the way the re imagined her origin she should have been a guide for Clark coming into his destiny not having her being bossed around by a Clark that still after 7 years can't make the hard decisions. I know comic purists wont agree but in theory if you are going to make lara older and as a sort of guardian for Clark does it not make sense that because of his still naive minded approach to making choices that with her intact knowledge of krypton she could guide him.4.jor-el should have played a bigger role in this season and taught his son more lessons then trapping him in ice. Like giving Clark some common sense and the ability to fly since Clark is to scared to that big leap for krypton.final synopsisWhoever wrote this season should be fired. the stories did not flow and mesh well at all and showed no progression and evolving of Clark from going from boy to a Superman. By the end of the season I was rooting for lex and brainiac to kill him. Superman was always a boyscout yes, but  he always was very intelligent and had common sense in making his decisions. He also would learn from his mistakes I can see maybe 4 seasons of him  finding his feet on earth and learning. But this last 3 seasons should have been him having his footing and learning to fly.",2,Enough Already,1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,2063,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'season', 'started', 'out', 'good', 'fell', 'flat', 'face', 'here', 'are', 'reasons', 'then', 'final', 'synopsis.Spoilers', '1', 'enough', 'already', 'Clark', 'naive', 'attitude', 'yes', 'boyscout', '7', 'seasons', 'Clark', 'pity', 'party', 'too', 'stop', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'do', 'have', 'see', 'make', 'same', 'errors', 'mistakes', 'made', 'judgment', 'past', '7', 'seasons', 'lesson', 'sinks', 'kryptonian', 'brain', 'father', 'jor-el', 'right.2', 'are', 'up', 'season', '7', 'Clark', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'fly', 'teased', 'season', 'unrealized', 'give', 'break', 'invulnerable', 'yet', 'scared', 'trying', 'leap', 'barn', 'fly.3', 'lara', 'supergirl', 'breaks', 'original', 'comic', 'mythos', 'origin', 'liked', 'how', 'reinvented', 'origin', 'tv', 'way', 're', 'imagined', 'origin', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'guide', 'Clark', 'coming', 'destiny', 'not', 'having', 'being', 'bossed', 'Clark', 'still', '7', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'hard', 'decisions', 'know', 'comic', 'purists', 'wont', 'agree', 'theory', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'lara', 'older', 'sort', 'guardian', 'Clark', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'still', 'naive', 'minded', 'approach', 'making', 'choices', 'intact', 'knowledge', 'krypton', 'could', 'guide', 'him.4.jor-el', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'bigger', 'role', 'season', 'taught', 'son', 'more', 'lessons', 'then', 'trapping', 'ice', 'giving', 'Clark', 'common', 'sense', 'ability', 'fly', 'Clark', 'scared', 'big', 'leap', 'krypton.final', 'synopsisWhoever', 'wrote', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'fired', 'stories', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'mesh', 'well', 'showed', 'progression', 'evolving', 'Clark', 'going', 'boy', 'Superman', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'rooting', 'lex', 'brainiac', 'kill', 'Superman', 'was', 'always', 'boyscout', 'yes', 'always', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'had', 'common', 'sense', 'making', 'decisions', 'also', 'would', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'can', 'see', 'maybe', '4', 'seasons', 'finding', 'feet', 'earth', 'learning', 'last', '3', 'seasons', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'footing', 'learning', 'fly']",N/A

1113456,AP3B615GM191G,B000X5SMXY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[20, 21]","Smallville's Seventh Season can easily be categorized into three distinct parts, each containing their own strenghts and weaknesses:1. At the beginning of this season, Kara Jor-El (better known as Supergirl) is introduced. The developement of her character is a welcome breathe of fresh air to the show, while the description of her Kryptonian parents' relationship to Clark's Kryptonian family provides some intriguing backstory into the politics of Krypton. At the same time, however, the Clark/Lana soap opera continues, milking that relationship for all it is worth (a would-be touching moment in the finale is rendered midly emotional as a result).2. The middle of the season struggled to find it's footing. On one (positive) hand, Clark takes a very interesting romp through Lex's twisted mind in ""Fracture"", while Braniac (always a well-acted, interesting character) returns to wreak more havoc on the House of El. On the other (negative) hand, the Grant Gabriel character arc completely fails, the much-hyped ""Gemini"" episode fails to deliver its potential, while the return of an old friend in ""Hero"" proves to be anti-climatic and contrived.3. The final portion of the season, however, is what boosts my rating from three stars to four. The final seven episodes of the series deal with the mysterious ""Veritas"" society (of which Lionel Luthor is intimately involved in) that know of Clark's Kryptonian heritage. The quest to decipher ""Veritas"" leads Lex Luthor to take the final step (in a chilling scene) towards obsessive madness, puts Lana, Chloe, and Kara in mortal danger, and ultimately sets up a long-awaited Clark/Lex showdown.To conclude, though the opening portions of the Smallville's Seventh Season were average at best, the ""Veritas"" angle brings back the intense drama that Smallville fans are used to. As the show progresses into what may be it's final (eighth) season minus a few long-time cast members, the look of the show may be quite different than ever before. In recent seasons, Smallville creators Al Gough and Miles Millar have been heavily criticed for tampering with the heralded Superman cannon.
