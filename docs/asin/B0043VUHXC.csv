I expected it to be about as good as the series, and content-wise, it's ok.  3d is another story.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the 3D graphics are cheesy.  Not only that, but many of them have horrible 3D errors.  One example is when asteroids are shown, and the depths are all wrong; many of the asteroids are further into the screen than the stars.  Images of the planets in another recurring clip are drastically different between the left & right eye; Uranus or Neptune are blue for one eye, but virtually black for the other.  Even the live action 3D is screwed up.  The video of the guy int he field has one eye's view higher than the other, so unless you're watching with your head tilted about 45 degrees to one side, the 3D is going to be uncomfortable at best.  This is something that you can spot being wrong without even using 3D glasses (you'll see two images superimposed on one another, and instead of seeing a horizontal shift, you'll see an angled one), so how it got past the editors before going to disc, I have no idea.Skip the 3D version and go for the 2D one.",1,Pathetic 3D,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,1200,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'series', 'TV', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'grabbed', 'copy', 'local', 'store', 'town', 'expected', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'content-wise', 'ok.', '3d', 'story', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', '3D', 'graphics', 'are', 'cheesy', 'Not', 'only', 'many', 'have', 'horrible', '3D', 'errors', 'One', 'example', 'when', 'asteroids', 'are', 'shown', 'depths', 'are', 'wrong', 'many', 'asteroids', 'are', 'further', 'screen', 'stars', 'Images', 'planets', 'recurring', 'clip', 'are', 'drastically', 'different', 'left', 'right', 'eye', 'Uranus', 'Neptune', 'are', 'blue', 'one', 'eye', 'virtually', 'black', 'other', 'Even', 'live', 'action', '3D', 'screwed', 'up', 'video', 'guy', 'int', 'field', 'one', 'eye', 'view', 'higher', 'other', ""'re"", 'watching', 'head', 'tilted', '45', 'degrees', 'one', 'side', '3D', 'going', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'best', 'something', 'can', 'spot', 'being', 'wrong', 'even', 'using', '3D', 'glasses', ""'ll"", 'see', 'two', 'images', 'superimposed', 'one', 'instead', 'seeing', 'horizontal', 'shift', ""'ll"", 'see', 'angled', 'one', 'how', 'got', 'editors', 'going', 'disc', 'have', 'idea.Skip', '3D', 'version', 'go', '2D', 'one']",The Universe: 7 Wonders of the Solar System

In October I bought a top of the line Panasonic 3D TV & Panasonic 3D Blu-Ray player. The other 7 3D discs I own display great 3D images with the shutter glasses. That's what I was expecting for this disc. However when I popped it into the player and picked 3D from the PLAY menu, NO 3D. Usually on this TV when you hit PLAY you get a momentary box in the upper right hand corner of the screen that says PLAY and under it FULL 3D. This time only says PLAY. Tried all the options in the 3D setup menu to no avail. Last resort figured maybe the PLAY menu was mislabeled so picked 2D. No matter whether I picked 2D or 3D, the picture was EXACTLY the same. Very disappointed to pay this price for a short documentary and not get the 3D. It's going back to Amazon.

I have seen better, more informative programs, but this wasn't bad.  It was written for an audience with a moderate understanding of the solar system, no more, so I think there was bound to be some overlap with past programs or knowledge.My primary ""complaint"", if you can call it that, with the show was that it felt gimmicky.  The space ship (which was, as some have said, prooly animated) felt cheesey, and the constant reminders that it was a 3D program were silly.  Furthermore, one of the scientists was quite cheesey in his explanations.  I also felt the choice of Earth as the #1 wonder was cliched and predictable; I assumed Earth or Life would be the #1 and I was disappointed that they didn't surprise me.All that said, I learned things I didn't know before, so I got what I wanted out of it.  It was entertaining and interesting, and I don't feel that I was cheated out of my $10...and more importantly, it answered my question as to whether I might want to buy the Universe series (which I think I will).
