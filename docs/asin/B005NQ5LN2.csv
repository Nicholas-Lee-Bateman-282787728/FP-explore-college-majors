And when they did one of the major action scenes they got lazy with the animation. The story could have done a lot more and some questions did go unanswered. Would I recommend this show?

In a battle trying to recover it, Birdy accidentally kills a young man named Senkawa. In order to save his life, Birdy merges with him. Now they share her body until his can be regenerated. Together they search for the Ryunka, and try to save the planet. During their time together, they both meet someone and fall in love. But the Ryunka has a way of tearing people apart. Will either of them be able to be with the one they love? Or will they all meet a tragic fate?This anime is very well done. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. It took a few episodesto get into it, but a very serious and emotional story unfolds. Love and loss are major themes in this series. The characters have depth and are very likable. There is a lot of action, drama, suspense, romance, and a little comedy. It's a very well rounded show. The animation style reminds me a bit of K-On; at least in the character designs. It's rated TV MA. I assume it's for violence. The violence can get pretty heavy. There is nothing that I would consider nudity in this series. There is an occasional bare rear end scene in the bath tub, but that's it. There is a lot to love about this series. It has everything an anime needs to be great.
