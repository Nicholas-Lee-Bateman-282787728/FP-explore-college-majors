Written by stunt man/quasi-director Mike Gunther and his partner Mike Behrman, it is a wonder the film found funding to make it to DVD at least.  Not only is the 'story' derivative at best, bu tit is acted by a group of actors how should know better.Three crime-addicted friends (Ryan Phillippe, Brett Granstaff, and 50 Cent) have a crime gig that is a diamond heist that goes wrong because Phillippe makes it a set up to get all the money for himself: his father (James Remar from 'Dexter') is a violent prisoner who is marked for killing in the prison unless Phillippe can get the money for is protection.  Phillippe kills Granstaff and shoots 50 Cent (who survives).  50 cent then aligns with crime boss Bruce Willis to get back the money from the heist, chases Phillippe interminably, Phillippe's father is killed, and 50 Cent must make some crucial decision about how to make this story end.Fortunately, most of the 'dialogue' is covered by an obnoxiously loud music score.  Everyone gives phone-in acting style performances except incredibly miscast and talentless actor Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson.

This movie fell flat in a lot of ways.  Of course I drooled over Curtis Jackson and Bruce Willis, and yes, even Randy Couture.  This movie is all testosterone, and some of the characters made stupid mistakes.  ""Life is about choice[s]""; choose wisely.  The only redeeming story line was the parts when Sonny was searching for answers in a church.  The priest's advice was both poignant and a foreshadowing of things to come if certain trajectories were played out.Some spots were predictable; some spots were dull.  From a philosophical perspective, playing with guns has consequences, which is clearly displayed when Sonny goes to his friend's house for drugs.  You can't help but think what if Sonny said, ""I'm cool with the drugs; let's just deliver the money.""  Alternatively, what if Petey listened and put the gun down?  But then again, would there be any interest if there was this type of violence in the movie?""Setup"" seemed like it was a mashup between the Sopranos and something like Rambo.  It could have even been a mashup of part of 50's life from when he was shot in real life and survived.  I see that the movie was co-produced by him, so his handiwork is in this movie.  It's my understanding that this went straight to DVD and it pulled in $2 million. What a waste!  Hopefully this won't be a black mark on Jackson's pretty much stellar record of kick ass projects.  Willis kind of went downhill when he did his last Die Hard movie, ""It's a Good Day to Die Hard (2013).  Maybe this movie was a foreshadowing of things to come.

1447725,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0058ZPNBI,MadMacs,"[3, 3]","This is the third Curtis Jackson film I've screened and he's gotten a little better. Improved, but I'm now of the opinion that he may have peaked. Again, may have. The range is limited and his presence often takes on a cardboard stiffness. The natural acceptance we give to performer excellence is only grudgingly given to his character, Sonny. Primarily because the role is already custom-fit to his strengths and natural personage, there's not a lot of stretch or reach in this outing.Still, I'm not yet walking away. The spark that I saw in the abominable ""Streets of Blood"" is still there. But I'm tempering my expectations from this point going forward. I see on his IMDb profile that he has three other films either in the can or in post-production, with another two in pre-production. So at the very least - it'll be interesting for the next couple of years.What I appreciate the most is that he hasn't filled his resum&eacute; with too many gansta roles. As a career move, it's a bold and scary choice for any actor attempting to do characters outside his or her real-life experience or natural comfort zone.Overall, an average effort made watchable only by the brief inclusion of Bruce Willis' mob boss, the always enjoyable James Remar as the convict, and Shaun Toub as the hitman.I'm speculating that Willis' saw this as a paycheck gig at some point - because he doesn't drop or sublimate that smarmy smartass jive that's been his bread-n-butter since 'Moonlighting'; his portrayal didn't make for a very believable stone cold killer. But to be fair, it's also possible, however unlikely, that his character was written that way. In either case, there wasn't enough of him and/or he didn't put enough into it to make this a more engaging film.James Remar has always done the bad guy well. It's difficult to imagine, but he also does an amazing good guy when given the chance. Hope he gets more opportunities to showcase that aspect of his skillset. And speaking of amazing - Shaun Toub. He really impressed me as the hitman - cool, professional and inhumanely disconnected. Loved it. A huge part of me wishes they would do a prequel film with just his character as the focus. But producers rarely, if ever, give movies to character actors - which is both sad and wrong.'SetUp' is an otherwise pedestrian plot that follows a very well-worn script. And I have to be honest, I don't really appreciate the Guy Ritchie Effect of adding titles to characters as they appear, not unless you're doing a blood-soaked comedy. Just my opinion.Movie Notes:- You can always spot 'budget conscious' in the little things. One such example in SetUp was Bruce's hair. After a while you notice it's growing out. Kinda funny actually.- One aspect to the girlfriend role I found odd was the 'stuffed bear' scene. She opened the delivered box with a combat knife. How weird was that? Are scissors no longer utilized in non-thief homes anymore? &lt;g>- Loved seeing best friends and professional poker players Antonio 'The Magician' Esfandiari and Phil 'Unabomber' Laak in cameo roles. You always hear them talk story about messed up tables involving guns, goombahs, and angry gamblers - it was interesting to see an example. I like to think they advised the director and writers on a real-life experience. :-D",3,"Predictable Crime Drama, Fiddy Improvement",1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,3298,"['third', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'film', ""'ve"", 'screened', 'gotten', 'little', 'better', 'Improved', ""'m"", 'now', 'opinion', 'may', 'have', 'peaked', 'Again', 'may', 'have', 'range', 'limited', 'presence', 'often', 'cardboard', 'stiffness', 'natural', 'acceptance', 'give', 'performer', 'excellence', 'only', 'grudgingly', 'given', 'character', 'Sonny', 'Primarily', 'role', 'already', 'custom-fit', 'strengths', 'natural', 'personage', 'not', 'lot', 'stretch', 'reach', 'outing.Still', ""'m"", 'not', 'yet', 'walking', 'away', 'spark', 'saw', 'abominable', 'Streets', 'Blood', 'still', 'there', ""'m"", 'tempering', 'expectations', 'point', 'going', 'forward', 'see', 'IMDb', 'profile', 'three', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'post-production', 'two', 'pre-production', 'So', 'very', 'least', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'next', 'couple', 'years.What', 'appreciate', 'most', ""n't"", 'filled', 'resum', 'eacute', 'too', 'many', 'gansta', 'roles', 'career', 'move', 'bold', 'scary', 'choice', 'actor', 'attempting', 'do', 'characters', 'outside', 'real-life', 'experience', 'natural', 'comfort', 'zone.Overall', 'average', 'effort', 'made', 'watchable', 'only', 'brief', 'inclusion', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'mob', 'boss', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'James', 'Remar', 'convict', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'hitman.I', ""'m"", 'speculating', 'Willis', 'saw', 'paycheck', 'gig', 'point', ""n't"", 'drop', 'sublimate', 'smarmy', 'smartass', 'jive', 'been', 'bread-n-butter', ""'Moonlighting"", 'portrayal', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'believable', 'stone', 'cold', 'killer', 'be', 'fair', 'also', 'possible', 'however', 'unlikely', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'way', 'case', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'enough', 'make', 'more', 'engaging', 'film.James', 'Remar', 'always', 'done', 'bad', 'guy', 'well', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'also', 'amazing', 'good', 'guy', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'more', 'opportunities', 'showcase', 'aspect', 'skillset', 'speaking', 'amazing', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'really', 'impressed', 'hitman', 'cool', 'professional', 'inhumanely', 'disconnected', 'Loved', 'huge', 'part', 'would', 'do', 'prequel', 'film', 'just', 'character', 'focus', 'producers', 'rarely', 'ever', 'give', 'movies', 'character', 'actors', 'sad', 'wrong', 'otherwise', 'pedestrian', 'plot', 'very', 'well-worn', 'script', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'appreciate', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Effect', 'adding', 'titles', 'characters', 'appear', 'not', ""'re"", 'doing', 'blood-soaked', 'comedy', 'Just', 'opinion.Movie', 'Notes', 'can', 'always', 'spot', ""'budget"", 'conscious', 'little', 'things', 'One', 'such', 'example', 'SetUp', 'was', 'Bruce', 'hair', 'while', 'notice', 'growing', 'out', 'Kinda', 'funny', 'actually.-', 'One', 'aspect', 'girlfriend', 'role', 'found', 'odd', 'was', ""'stuffed"", 'bear', 'scene', 'opened', 'delivered', 'box', 'combat', 'knife', 'How', 'weird', 'was', 'Are', 'no', 'longer', 'utilized', 'non-thief', 'homes', 'anymore', 'lt', '>', 'Loved', 'seeing', 'best', 'friends', 'professional', 'poker', 'players', 'Antonio', ""'The"", 'Magician', 'Esfandiari', 'Phil', ""'Unabomber"", 'Laak', 'cameo', 'roles', 'always', 'hear', 'talk', 'story', 'messed', 'up', 'tables', 'involving', 'guns', 'goombahs', 'angry', 'gamblers', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'example', 'like', 'think', 'advised', 'director', 'writers', 'real-life', 'experience', '-D']",Set Up
1447726,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0058ZPNBI,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I've watched a few movies starring rap star Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in the past few years. Some have been good, some mediocre. But his new direct to DVD film SETUP is one that you should look at the cover of and then rent something else. Forget that Bruce Willis and Ryan Phillipe are on the front, just pass it by.Along with another friend, Jackson and Phillipe hold up a limo carrying a diamond merchant in broad daylight in the middle of a busy street. Everyone scatters and no one calls the police. Not only that there are no police in sight which seemed odd to me this being Detroit. Then again maybe Detroit is so bad off since there seem to be no police. Anyway, they rob the merchant and then drive off in a logo covered white van to the docks.At the docks they are finally met by the money man there to get the goods. Except that this is when Phillipe pulls out his gun and shoots both his friends. Of course Jackson isn't dead though. If he were this would be one short movie. Instead he gets away, finds help and sets out to find his traitorous friend.Unfortunately the diamonds they heisted were owned by people not to be messed with. A hit man begins tracking down the thieves to get the merchandise back. At the same time they pulled off the heist without the approval of the local mob boss (Willis) who isn't happy either. He meets with Jackson and orders him to help steal money from the Russians in order to clear his debt. He orders his man Petey (Randy Coutre) to go along.Afterwards the man he sends with Jackson suggests they celebrate with some cocaine. They go to Jackson's dealer friend who also has a slew of guns on display, one of which Petey twirls around and accidentally blows his brains out with. Rather than explain what happened, they toss the body in the trunk and Jackson starts to use some of the money to track down Phillipe.Sound complicated? It gets worse. We also get to meet another character, Phillipe's father (James Remar) who's in jail. It turns out ***spoiler*** that Phillipe stole the money to pay off the warden to insure that his father never got killed while in jail. But that's just not enough. A woman is involved in this whole thing as well and...well I won't say who she ends up being other than to say the whole thing doesn't hold up.Willis does fine with the small role he has (10-20 minutes tops), Phillipe does fine except that in making films like this his chances of stardom slip away one movie at a time and Jackson proves that he's much more suited for supporting roles than leading ones. His acting skills are limited at best and it seems that every movie has similar plots or situations.The worst part of this film is the script. It jumps around from here to their, has enough plot holes to sink an ocean liner and features so many characters that you just don't care about that you simply wish it would end soon. Why would Willis do a movie like this? My guess would be he either owed someone a favor or they just offered too much money for him to turn down. Let's just hope he doesn't offer this as a shining moment on his resume.",1,SET BACK,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3098,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'few', 'movies', 'starring', 'rap', 'star', 'Curtis', '50', 'Cent', 'Jackson', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'mediocre', 'new', 'direct', 'DVD', 'film', 'SETUP', 'one', 'should', 'look', 'cover', 'then', 'rent', 'something', 'else', 'Forget', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'are', 'front', 'just', 'pass', 'friend', 'Jackson', 'Phillipe', 'hold', 'up', 'limo', 'carrying', 'diamond', 'merchant', 'broad', 'daylight', 'middle', 'busy', 'street', 'Everyone', 'scatters', 'one', 'police', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'police', 'sight', 'seemed', 'odd', 'being', 'Detroit', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'Detroit', 'so', 'bad', 'off', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'police', 'Anyway', 'rob', 'merchant', 'then', 'drive', 'off', 'logo', 'covered', 'white', 'van', 'docks.At', 'docks', 'are', 'finally', 'met', 'money', 'man', 'there', 'get', 'goods', 'when', 'Phillipe', 'out', 'gun', 'shoots', 'friends', 'course', 'Jackson', ""n't"", 'dead', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'short', 'movie', 'Instead', 'away', 'help', 'out', 'find', 'traitorous', 'friend.Unfortunately', 'diamonds', 'heisted', 'were', 'owned', 'people', 'not', 'be', 'messed', 'hit', 'man', 'tracking', 'down', 'thieves', 'get', 'merchandise', 'back', 'same', 'time', 'pulled', 'off', 'heist', 'approval', 'local', 'mob', 'boss', 'Willis', 'who', ""n't"", 'happy', 'either', 'Jackson', 'orders', 'help', 'steal', 'money', 'Russians', 'order', 'clear', 'debt', 'orders', 'man', 'Petey', 'Randy', 'Coutre', 'go', 'along.Afterwards', 'man', 'Jackson', 'celebrate', 'cocaine', 'go', 'Jackson', 'dealer', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'slew', 'guns', 'display', 'one', 'Petey', 'twirls', 'around', 'accidentally', 'brains', 'out', 'Rather', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'toss', 'body', 'trunk', 'Jackson', 'use', 'money', 'track', 'down', 'Phillipe.Sound', 'complicated', 'worse', 'also', 'get', 'meet', 'character', 'Phillipe', 'father', 'James', 'Remar', 'who', 'jail', 'out', '***spoiler***', 'Phillipe', 'stole', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'warden', 'insure', 'father', 'never', 'got', 'killed', 'jail', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'woman', 'involved', 'whole', 'thing', 'as', 'well', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'other', 'say', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up.Willis', 'fine', 'small', 'role', '10-20', 'minutes', 'tops', 'Phillipe', 'fine', 'making', 'films', 'chances', 'stardom', 'slip', 'away', 'one', 'movie', 'time', 'Jackson', 'much', 'more', 'suited', 'supporting', 'roles', 'leading', 'ones', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'limited', 'best', 'movie', 'similar', 'plots', 'situations.The', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'script', 'here', 'enough', 'plot', 'holes', 'sink', 'ocean', 'liner', 'features', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'simply', 'wish', 'would', 'end', 'soon', 'Why', 'would', 'Willis', 'do', 'movie', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'either', 'owed', 'someone', 'favor', 'just', 'offered', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'turn', 'down', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', ""n't"", 'offer', 'shining', 'moment', 'resume']",Set Up

1447732,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0058ZPNBI,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Setup(released Sept/11)stars some really good talent:Bruce Willis as Mob Boss Mr Biggs,Ryan Phillippe as Vincent Long,James Remar as Long's father Bill,Randy Couture as Mr Biggs enforcer,Petey and 50 Cent as Sonny.Bruce Willis is the crown jewel of this production,putting in a solid performance along with his co stars Phillippe and Remar.Couture does his thing well and I like the way his career is coming along.The weak link in all of this is 50 Cent himself,or should I be saying Curtis Jackson? He takes on the majority of screen time,but it is a load taken on by a relatively inexperienced thespian,who needs MUCH more training to get his acting chops up to speed.Mr Jackson should follow Mr Couture's lead:taking small roles,step by step working up and developing oneself and learning the craft along the way.Many more running-before-you-can-walk stunts like this and his acting time will,by others dictates,be spent in bit parts for a long,long time to come.And something that caught my attention,was in the opening credits;eight,count 'em,EIGHT executive producers!I cannot recall in recent memory that many producers on the job all at once.How many producers does it take to make a moving starring 50-Cent?...I'll let you add he punch line.This movie used the city of Grand Rapids,Michigan as its back drop,subbing for Detroit,just down the road.That's a good thing,as Grand Rapids could use an influx of movie production like this.The story involves three lifetime friends,two of which are Phillippe and 50 Cent.Phillippe gets wind of a job that sounds really good.It's the stealing of some diamonds from a merchant.Well the job goes down,and the person transporting the diamonds gets shot and killed by Phillippe.The female limo driver is spared by 50 Cent,who doesn't have Phillippe's killer instinct,it seems.While perusing the ""ice"",their buyer or fence comes by to get the merchandise.However it is the movie-titled setup,as Phillippe turns on his two friends and kills them....almost.He flees,but 50 Cent lives.With revenge on his mind 50 Cent busts in on a gambling session with some folks who have heavy mob connections,wanting to know where to find his betraying friend.In the process he relieves the men of some petty cash.However this act gets the attention of local mobster Willis,who is less than pleased.To make up for his ""sins"",50 Cent,along with Willis' right hand man Couture as the driver,will relieve some Russians of $2 million dollars at a graveyard.The job goes off and on the way back Couture and 50 Cent stop off at a drug/arms dealer's house to pick up some pot.Before they can get down to business Couture accidentally pops a cap in his own head,killing himself.50 Cent cleanly disposes of his body but keeps the $2 million on account.He tracks down the female limo driver and asks her where his friend may be hiding,to which she answers in the negative.50 Cent in fact scours the town looking under every rock he can find and in the process stirs up alot of trouble in the process.Add into this mix the owners of the diamonds who have sent a French hit man to retrieve the stones.Also it turns out it was Phillippes sister who was the limo driver and in on things all along.The hit man reaches her and she gets herself killed.50 cent has taken a large part of the $2 million and sewed it into a bear which will be sent to his friend who was successfully killed by Phillippe in the original heist/setup.50 cent then finally goes back to Willis to say that Phillippe took the money from him and killed Couture in the process.50 cent and Willis arrange a meeting with Phillippe but a gun fight ensues with most getting killed or severely wounded.Phillippe flees back home and is departing with what loot he has when the hit man shows up.Phillippe catches him off guard and kills him.50 cent finally tracks Phillippe down planning to kill him,but in the end can't and he leaves Phillippe to fend for himself.The film's plot has some virtues.The idea is a strong one but the execution of it was a little on the weak side.The moments after Couture gets killed and is taken and disposed of should have been the time we were let in on what 50 Cent was going to do with the $2 million,but the film goes onto a few more things before later coming back to that point.In the meantime one is left scratching ones head as to what was going to happen to it.There is much made of the fact that Phillippe's sister was in on the heist from the start and that 50 Cent tracks her down and confronts her twice.Well if Phillippe,50 cent and the other man knew each other since school days,isn't it very probable 50 Cent would have known the limo driver was Phillipe's sister from the get go? Another point is that the group of three seemed to have been just some petty crooks for a long time,never involved in anything major,especially never getting into the realm of the more successful mobsters in the area.If they had Willis would have been more than familiar with 50 Cent and his ex partners.No,they were just petty crooks with petty takes.The question is,is where did Phillippe ever come up with the money for 15 years to keep his father,who was in prison,away from the general population(he was a snitch of sorts,why we are never told)? Phillippe's last money figure to keep his father out of danger in prison,was $100,000.It had gone up from a year earlier but I just had to ask.The film appears to have been directed relatively well and the supporting cast,especially Willis' associates,the stereo typical mob crowd,all do well and sure convinces me not to mess with them.Phillippe is good as a petty rook getting in over his head and paying the price and Remar,as his father in the pen,is quite menacing in his role.Willis,as I said,is the numero uno bad butt in this film and he plays his role with a wonderful elan and intensity only Willis can deliver.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette on its making,interviews with some of the cast,a look at the guns of the film and some commentary.All in all a movie with a good premise/promise,but filled with some extraneous holes that leave the viewer scratching ones head.It also has a lead man(50 Cent)who just can't take on lead roles at this time in his career.A good supporting cast on hand but they can only do so much with what they have.Nice try though.Barely three stars.",3,"An average heist gone

Three Detroit men rob a man of diamonds, however during the robbery one of the robbers kills the original owner of the diamonds, which wasn't part of the plan. Later as they go to fence the diamonds, the killer (Vincent) double crosses his partners in crime and shoots them. 50 Cent is saved because he is religious and wears a cross.Of course now 50 Cent is looking for the man who shot him. The other owners of the diamonds want him too. In 50 Cent's quest for knowledge he steps on the toes of crime boss, Bruce Willis, who strikes a deal with him. But as fate would have it, things never go as planned. Sonny (50 Cent) as an ""honorable"" bad guy is the wild card.The movie has some good twists. The slow religious scenes involving 50 Cent should have been left on the cutting room floor. They seemed awkward and forced. There are scenes with 50 Cent where his non-acting ability are far to obvious such as those religious scenes, his scene riding in the car with Willis and his final scene with Vincent. I can't imagine those being the best take.

After being double-crossed by his friend Vincent (Phillipe) Sonny (Jackson) ends up shot and bleeding on the ground. Looking for his revenge he comes up with a plan that involves the mob.  This is a movie I was really looking forward to.  Everything Bruce Willis is in is usually good.  The scenes he was in were very good and he brought the movie up when he was in it.  The big problem is that he was in the movie for a total of 5 minutes.  50 Cent is not a good enough actor to be able to carry a movie like he tried in this, and when you are out acted by Randy Couture that is not a good thing.  Besides the fact that I couldn't get into the movie because of Jackson's acting, the movie was very slow and seemed to go nowhere. Very disapointed.

The three guys pull it off successfully in downtown Detroit (though the uninspired robbery sequence does not explain much about how). The heist is, as you expect, followed by double-crossing.

It starts out a revenge story of someone who is betrayed and nearly killed. Then, that someone suddenly forgets what he sets out to do and gets involved in another bloody mess. In the meanwhile, a hitman is sent out to retrieve what is missing to the rightful owner. That hitman looks and speaks exactly like a cliche character stereotype does.Second-billed Bruce Willis plays a mobster boss Biggs. It is nothing but a forgettable cameo role, something he has done in ""Catch .44.""The 85 minute film feels so long with no character to root for.
