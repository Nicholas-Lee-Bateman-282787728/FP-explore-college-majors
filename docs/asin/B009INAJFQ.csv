In this series that was out back in 2008 (and even now in the movies), I have to say that this cartoon series was a favorite of mine back when it was originally out and now that the series is coming out on DVD I was excited to share it with my own daughters. The reason I always liked this series was the fact that it was very well written and give you a better insight into the character of Tony Stark and will his alter ego Iron Man. I love the and the mix of interaction with villains, while at the same time to get an insight into his ability to run Stark Enterprises. This is another great season and though not all of the season 2 episodes are on one DVD, this collection was again another strong asset to the series as a whole. If you are a fan of the Iron Man series, or the Iron Man comics, you will appreciate the artistry behind this television series as well as the strong writing that I always felt was a part of the series as well.",5,Another Great Addition to the Already Released Season 2 Episodes,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,1031,"['someone', 'been', 'fan', 'Iron', 'Man', 'quite', 'time', 'comic', 'book', 'form', 'series', 'was', 'out', 'back', '2008', 'even', 'now', 'movies', 'have', 'say', 'cartoon', 'series', 'was', 'favorite', 'mine', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'now', 'series', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'excited', 'share', 'own', 'daughters', 'reason', 'always', 'liked', 'series', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'give', 'better', 'insight', 'character', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'will', 'alter', 'ego', 'Iron', 'Man', 'love', 'mix', 'interaction', 'villains', 'same', 'time', 'get', 'insight', 'ability', 'run', 'Stark', 'Enterprises', 'great', 'season', 'not', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'are', 'one', 'DVD', 'collection', 'was', 'again', 'strong', 'asset', 'series', 'whole', 'are', 'fan', 'Iron', 'Man', 'series', 'Iron', 'Man', 'comics', 'will', 'appreciate', 'artistry', 'television', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'strong', 'writing', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'part', 'series', 'as', 'well']",Iron Man: Armored Adventures: Season 2 Volume 3

They are fans of all things super heros so were perfect reviewers for this movie.  They loved this and are looking forward to watching more of it on Nicktoons. They loved it! My husband thinks the graphics and storyline are awesome and said he wishes the toons were this killer when he was a kid.  He also loved that this Ironman is a kid which he believes Handsome liked it too.  It was nice to see the boys watching something together that doesn't include two teams running into each other with a pigskin in their arms. We love the animation used for these which reminded us of our childhood,5,Ironman & Super Hero Fans Will Love this,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,698,"['am', 'not', 'certain', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'starting', 'watch', 'so', 'called', 'boys', 'left', 'room', 'are', 'fans', 'things', 'super', 'heros', 'so', 'were', 'perfect', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'loved', 'are', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'more', 'Nicktoons', 'loved', 'husband', 'graphics', 'storyline', 'are', 'awesome', 'said', 'toons', 'were', 'killer', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'also', 'loved', 'Ironman', 'kid', 'Handsome', 'liked', 'too', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'boys', 'watching', 'something', 'together', ""n't"", 'include', 'two', 'teams', 'running', 'other', 'pigskin', 'arms', 'love', 'animation', 'used', 'reminded', 'childhood']",Iron Man: Armored Adventures: Season 2 Volume 3

Over the past 5-10 several fan-loved and critically acclaimed animated series have been cancelled after at most 2 seasons for various reasons. These series include: Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes, Spectacular Spider-Man, Wolverine and the X-Men, Young Justice, Green Lantern: the Animated Series, Thundercats (officially on hiatus according to Wikipedia), and Iron Man: Armored Adventures. I wish all of these shows would either be revived or allowed to continue airing, but hope springs eternal as the saying goes.",5,Great series,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,659,"['Iron', 'Man', 'Armored', 'Adventures', 'been', 'great', 'series', 'feel', 'victim', 'what', 'call', '34', '2-Season', '34', 'curse', 'past', '5-10', 'several', 'fan-loved', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'animated', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'cancelled', 'most', '2', 'seasons', 'various', 'reasons', 'series', 'include', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Heroes', 'Spectacular', 'Spider-Man', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'Young', 'Justice', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Thundercats', 'officially', 'hiatus', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Armored', 'Adventures', 'wish', 'shows', 'would', 'either', 'be', 'revived', 'allowed', 'continue', 'airing', 'hope', 'springs', 'eternal', 'saying']",Iron Man: Armored Adventures: Season 2 Volume 3
1596928,A30X9M0J5WOVAS,B009INAJFQ,The IEMommy,"[0, 1]","My husband is a HUGE Ironman fan so he was pretty ridiculously excited to see this Armored Adventures!  We grew up on Ironman and loved him long before the blockbuster movies started. Now we get to watch our children enjoy the same shows we watched as kids with characters from the comic books we collected.  It makes me feel young and old all at the same time!  My daughter Paige is actually a bigger fan of the superhero's than my son so this is something she gets to share with her Daddy.This DVD has six episodes from season two plus a few bonus features.  I have to say, it bothers me a little bit that there is more than one DVD of the same season.  Most shows have an entire season on one disc so you don't have to buy more than one.  I'm pretty sure that Ironman fans won't mind paying the price but my frugal side doesn't agree.The graphics are interesting because they are clearly up to today's technology but at the same time have the visual effect of the superhero shoes from the eighties.  It's smart to keep the classic look for all of the diehard fans out there but also make it more believable by taking advantage of the technology of today.I love that this was something we could enjoy as a family.  For whatever reason, my kids aren't scared of the bad guys or fighting.  Sensitive children or really young ones might be a little bit afraid.  This is definitely for older children but my kids are really into superhero's right now so I let them watch it with us. I know a lot of my friends with little boys don't want them watching anything with violence or playing with guns.  Ironman has both so this is something that should be viewed before letting your kids watch if you have issues with these things.If you are an Ironman fan, you will for sure enjoy Armored Adventures  now available on DVD and new generations of fans will fall in love with Ironman!",4,Visually Similar to the Classic,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,1875,"['husband', 'HUGE', 'Ironman', 'fan', 'so', 'was', 'pretty', 'ridiculously', 'excited', 'see', 'Armored', 'Adventures', 'grew', 'up', 'Ironman', 'loved', 'long', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'started', 'Now', 'get', 'watch', 'children', 'enjoy', 'same', 'watched', 'kids', 'characters', 'comic', 'books', 'collected', 'feel', 'young', 'old', 'same', 'time', 'daughter', 'Paige', 'actually', 'bigger', 'fan', 'superhero', 'son', 'so', 'something', 'share', 'Daddy.This', 'DVD', 'six', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'have', 'say', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'one', 'DVD', 'same', 'season', 'Most', 'shows', 'have', 'entire', 'season', 'one', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'buy', 'more', 'one', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Ironman', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paying', 'price', 'frugal', 'side', ""n't"", 'agree.The', 'graphics', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'clearly', 'up', 'today', 'technology', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'visual', 'effect', 'superhero', 'shoes', 'eighties', 'smart', 'keep', 'classic', 'look', 'diehard', 'out', 'there', 'also', 'make', 'more', 'believable', 'taking', 'advantage', 'technology', 'today.I', 'love', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'enjoy', 'family', 'reason', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'scared', 'bad', 'guys', 'fighting', 'Sensitive', 'children', 'really', 'young', 'ones', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'afraid', 'definitely', 'older', 'children', 'kids', 'are', 'really', 'superhero', 'right', 'now', 'so', 'let', 'watch', 'know', 'lot', 'friends', 'little', 'boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watching', 'anything', 'violence', 'playing', 'guns', 'Ironman', 'so', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'letting', 'kids', 'watch', 'have', 'issues', 'things.If', 'are', 'Ironman', 'fan', 'will', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'Armored', 'Adventures', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'new', 'generations', 'fans', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'Ironman']",Iron Man: Armored Adventures: Season 2 Volume 3
