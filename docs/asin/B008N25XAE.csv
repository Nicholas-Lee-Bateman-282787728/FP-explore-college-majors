There was no language, The only violence was where a man grabs a girl by the arm and another man punches him.  The only other things are a woman plots against and steals from someone else; a man is arrested for fraud; a man lies to his girlfriend several times; it is learned that a man got another woman pregnant; a woman lies about her real last name; and a driver yells &#34;Nice coconuts&#34; to a girl dressed in a gorilla suit with a coconut bra.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for 12+.I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Lifetime Channel and then bought the DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know Iwill be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.  Also, a lot of people don't like it because since it is supposed to be an adaption of the Jane Austin Novel, Sense and Sensibility, it doesn't really follow the original story at all; however, I didn't buy it because it was adapted from the novel, I bought it because it was a cute movie.  If you want a truer adaption, buy the movie with Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant.Anyway, I liked the two sisters, Elinor (the sensible one) and Marianne.  They get into funny situations as they look for ways to pay the bills.  Marianne has a difficult time adjusting to their new lifestyle (old truck and tv, budget meals).  Because of the scandal when their father was arrested for fraud, many people judge them and don't trust them.  The two males characters, Edward and Brandon, do a great job too.  Edward, who knows who Elinor really is, falls for her immediately and even defends her to his sister/Elinor's employer.  Brandon is a little arrogant at first, but apologizes nicely and is very understanding when he finds out she lied about who she is.  They all work together against Edward's sister who steals from the girls to get herself out of debt because she won't deprive herself of the luxuries she wants.  Everything ends happily ever after for everyone (except Edwards sister and Marianne old boyfriend).Overall, I love this movie and will watch it again.",5,Scents and Sensibility - Would Watch Again,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,2393,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Scents', 'Sensibility', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'clean', 'was', 'language', 'only', 'violence', 'was', 'where', 'man', 'girl', 'arm', 'man', 'only', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'woman', 'plots', 'steals', 'someone', 'else', 'man', 'arrested', 'fraud', 'man', 'girlfriend', 'several', 'times', 'learned', 'man', 'got', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'real', 'last', 'name', 'driver', 'yells', '34', 'Nice', '34', 'girl', 'dressed', 'gorilla', 'suit', 'coconut', 'bra', 'not', 'rated', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'gave', 'four', 'star', 'approved', '12+.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again', 'originally', 'saw', 'movie', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'then', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'Iwill', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', 'Also', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'supposed', 'be', 'adaption', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'Novel', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'original', 'story', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', 'bought', 'was', 'cute', 'movie', 'want', 'truer', 'adaption', 'buy', 'movie', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Hugh', 'Grant.Anyway', 'liked', 'two', 'sisters', 'Elinor', 'sensible', 'one', 'Marianne', 'get', 'funny', 'situations', 'look', 'ways', 'pay', 'bills', 'Marianne', 'difficult', 'time', 'adjusting', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'old', 'truck', 'tv', 'budget', 'meals', 'scandal', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'arrested', 'fraud', 'many', 'people', 'judge', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'two', 'males', 'characters', 'Edward', 'Brandon', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'Edward', 'who', 'who', 'Elinor', 'really', 'immediately', 'even', 'sister/Elinor', 'employer', 'Brandon', 'little', 'arrogant', 'first', 'nicely', 'very', 'understanding', 'when', 'out', 'lied', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'Edward', 'sister', 'who', 'girls', 'get', 'debt', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deprive', 'herself', 'luxuries', 'Everything', 'ends', 'happily', 'ever', 'everyone', 'Edwards', 'sister', 'Marianne', 'old', 'boyfriend', '.Overall', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

Elinor and Marianne find desperate employment cleaning toilets and such at a spa and working as a copy girl, respectively.  Marianne has a gift for making lotions from flowers that the no good Fran Ferrars(sister of kindly Edward) steals.  Their little sister needs medicine for her leukemia, and mother is rarely seen.-End Alert-  It sounds worst than it is for there is romance in the air, and overall, everything is mostly lighthearted with a few dramatic moments.Of course, Elinor is the more responsible one, but surpresses her angst and Marianne is bound to make stupid romantic choices with the ever worthless John Willoughby over the heroic, and in this tale, young, handsome Brandon.  It's only about hour and a half, so things really have to move along and character development is limited.The actors do alright.  Marla Sokoloff is the queen of this genre(Christmas in Boston, The Chateau Meroux, et al.) and is good at it even in a fairly low budget flick. The music bounces along nicely; most of the shots are at their apartment, spa, or workplace and are pretty meager, but there are a couple outdoor scenes that are beautiful and romantic.The ending is sweet.
